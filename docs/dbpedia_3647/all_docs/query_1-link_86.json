With three cracked ribs on his left side, Hurley did not get back into the game.\n\nFlorida State's striking defensive performance appeared to be led by linebacker Paul Piurowski, end Willie Jones and nose guard Ron Simmons. In limiting the Orangemen to just five first downs, the Seminoles allowed only three following the game-opening series in which Hurley was hurt.\n\nClinging to a 7-0 lead early in the last quarter, the Seminoles were backed to their three. It was third down. Quarterback Jimmy Jordan hit his old Tallahassee Leon teammate, Kurt Unglaub, with a short pass at about the 20, and Unglaub managed 20 more yards out of the catch.\n\nThe Orangeman were never the same after that. Florida State moved to three lightning-like touchdowns in the first eight minutes of that final quarter.\n\nJordan capped a 98-yard drive with a surprise 4-yard scoring pass to Grady King, and with a 14-0 lead, Jordan retired for the afternoon.\n\nHe had personally scored a second-quarter touchdown, with a sneak from inches away, after setting it up with a 41-yard bomb to Jackie Flowers, whose catch on the play was extraordinary.\n\nMoments after Jordan left the game, Wally Woodham directed a 43-yard touchdown push, throwing 15 yards to Flowers for the payoff. And just a little later Woodham was in the saddle for a 45-yard movement that saw Gator Cherry score from the nine.\n\nSyracuse, really, never came close to scoring.\n\nGoing in, FSU Coach Bobby Bowden said it would be a game that would be won or lost on the defensive and offensive lines of scrimmage. He was altogether correct. Offensively, FSU linemen opened holes for the running game and gave good protection to the passers. Defensively, FSU linemen were in Syracuse's hair all afternoon.\n\nOn a sunny, windy and quite chilly afternoon, with the temperature in the low 70's, 24,272 fans in Archbold Stadium watched the Seminoles roll up a whopping 587 yards while restricting the home team to 148. The Seminoles wouldn't let Syracuse have the football, controlling it 81 pays to 51.\n\nSyracuse made just five first downs all day while FSU was stacking up 28.\n\nAnd if Florida State did not find another Larry Key on this day, Homes Johnson will do for the time being.\n\nThe swift sophomore - who got a bigger chance than he otherwise would have because fellow tailback Greg Ramsey was hurt - scampered for 135 yards in 17 carries. (Ramsey who saw a bit of action, damaged some ribs returning kicks in a Thursday practice.)\n\nMark Lyles churned for 67 yards on 14 runs as the Seminoles ran up a pleasing total of 304 on the ground.\n\nAs Jordan hit 16 of 25 passes, and Woodham four of seven, Flowers snared five for 94 yards. Three other FSU receivers - Johnson among them caught three each.\n\nRohn Stark, the freshman, punted like a veteran. Though his average was only 35.7, it was cut by efforts to angle 'em out of bounds inside the 20. His first effort was a nifty 57-yarder.\n\nWith Hurley out, Syracuse could neither run nor pass with any consistency, though backup Ron Farneski did manage to complete eight of 16 for minimal yardage.\n\nIt was a game that saw Florida State frustrated much of the time. In the second quarter, after taking that 7-0 lead, the Seminoles drove to a first down at the Syracuse nine, only to have a Jordan pass intercepted.\n\nAnd in the third quarter a 47-yard try for a field goal by Bill Capece was blocked, presenting Syracuse with the ball at FSU's 40.\n\n\"It was the most frustrated I've been in a long time,\" remarked Bowden of some of those early efforts.\n\nBut overall?\n\n\"We did much better,\" he said, \"than I expected.\"\n\nThe youthful Seminoles, with just three seniors making this trip, had entered the game amid high concern from coaches and followers. A handful of key injuries had cropped up in preseason. And this Syracuse team was supposed to have been one of the school's best in recent history.\n\n\"When Hurley got hurt,\" said Bowden, \"they stayed right with us - until that last quarter. Their losing Hurley was about like out losing Jordan and Woodham.\n\n\"We had two things going for us - attitude and conditioning.\"\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 0 7 0 21 28 Syracuse 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2nd 7- 0 Jimmy Jordan, 1, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 13:42 7- 0 Dave Cappelen, 41, field goal failed 3rd 7- 0 Bill Capece, 47, field goal blocked 7- 0 Opp, 54, field goal failed 4th 14- 0 Grady King, 4, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick), 11:54 21- 0 Jackie Flowers, 15, pass from Wally Woodham (Dave Cappelen, kick), 10:04 28- 0 Gator Cherry, 9, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 7:01\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 28 5 Rushes-yards 49-304 34-72 Passing 283 76 Att-Comp-Int 32-20-1 17-9-0 Total Yards 81-587 51-148 Punt Returns 2--6 0-0 Kickoff Returns 1-18 4-118 Interception Ret. 0-0 1-3 Fumble Returns 0-0 0-0 Punts 7-35.7 11-30.1 Fumbles-Lost 1-0 3-0 Penalties-Yds 9-75 4-40 Attendance 24,272 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Homes Johnson 19 135 0 27 Mark Lyles 14 66 0 17 Sam Platt 2 42 0 27 Keith Kennedy 4 28 0 23 Gator Cherry 2 18 1 9t Wade Wallace 2 15 0 15 Greg Ramsey 2 7 0 6 Jimmy Jordan 3 -2 1 1t Wally Woodham 1 -5 0 -5 --------------------------------------------- FSU 49 304 2 27 Opp 34 72 0 9 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Jackie Flowers 5 94 1 40 Kurt Unglaub 3 59 0 37 Bill Keck 2 38 0 27 Homes Johnson 3 30 0 18 Grady King 3 28 1 16 Mark Lyles 2 20 0 13 Milton Raysor 1 9 0 9 Keith Kennedy 1 5 0 5 --------------------------------------------- FSU 20 283 2 40 Opp 9 76 0 15 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Jimmy Jordan 16 25 1 209 1 40 Wally Woodham 4 7 0 74 1 27 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 20 32 1 283 2 40 Opp 9 17 0 76 0 15 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Keith Jones 2 -6 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 -6 0 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Homes Johnson 1 18 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 18 0 Opp 4 118 0 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Rohn Stark 7 250 57 ---------------------------------------- FSU 7 250 57 Opp 11 331 45 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arthur Scott 4 2 6 . . . . . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nFlorida State 38, Oklahoma State 20\n\n09/16/1978, Renegade and Osceola led the team onto the field for the first time, Tallahassee\n\nFrom the Tallahassee Democrat, September 17, 1978, page 29, by Bill McGrotha.\n\nFSU lightning strikes, 38-20.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, FL - On a sweltering Saturday night, Jimmy Jordan was sudden lightning.\n\nAnd with his uncanny passing, Florida State's football team cut out a 38-20 victory over Oklahoma State in a rather messy game that was as difficult as Coach Bobby Bowden had feared it might be.\n\nJordan struck on 17 of 28 passes for 231 yards and three touchdowns, and the Tallahassee junior had none intercepted.\n\nTrailing 6-3, Florida State scored two touchdowns within a 19-second playing span shortly before halftime, and took a 17-6 lead.\n\nWhen Oklahoma State fumbled away the football at its 35, Jordan required just one play - a pass to Homes Johnson - to get on the boards.\n\nAnd when the Cowboys fumbled on their next play from scrimmage, with FSU grabbing the ball at the Cowboy 32, Jordan again needed just one play - a pass to Kurt Unglaub.\n\nIncredibly, Oklahoma State lost the ball on fumbles four of five possessions - two just before halftime, two just after. The Seminoles got 21 points out of that, and had it not been for that flawed stretch, those 40,338 fans in Campbell Stadium might have witnessed a different outcome.\n\nBut in highly humid circumstances, Florida State also lost some fumbles - three of 'em. In the early going the Seminoles lost the ball at Oklahoma State's seven. Just after intermission they turned one over at the Cowboy 12. Late in the action FSU fumbled away a punt at its seven, setting up the visitors' last touchdown.\n\nIt was a spectacular return to action for strong safety Mike Kincaid, who had not expected to play this season but gained eligibility under a new NCAA rule because he did not participate as a freshman - and who had missed the opener with Syracuse because of a curfew violation and an injury. Kincaid recovered two fumbles that set up touchdowns, intercepting a pass that paved a third.\n\nBowden was not elated.\n\n\"If we play too many more games like this one,\" he said, \"I'm going to be gray. We made just enough mistakes to keep us in trouble.\n\n\"There is no killer instinct in this football team.\n\n\"Same thing happened to Syracuse last week - we just can't put anybody away.\n\n\"But the most important thing about the game is that we won.\"\n\nIt was another most interesting game for sophomore tailback Holmes Johnson, who scored three touchdowns. He ran 20 times for 78 yards, and caught four passes for 59 more.\n\nRolling up 406 yards, with 268 of it passing, Florida State may again be the nation's No. 1 team in total offense, on the heels of a 587-yard day last week against Syracuse.\n\nBut the Seminoles' defense yielded a surprising and worrisome 261 to the running game of Oklahoma State as the Cowboys managed a 307-yard total.\n\nPerhaps the most stunning happening of the evening was Oklahoma State's driving 93 yards to a touchdown and a 6-0 lead the second time it got its hands on the football. And in the third quarter, just after FSU had gone ahead 24-6, the Cowboys went 75 yards - all on the ground - and made it look kind of easy as they scored to cut it to 24-14.\n\nHere's how it went:\n\n(1) After recovering the FSU fumble at its seven, OSU knocked off 93 yards in 12 plays, scoring on an odd two-yard play that saw Steve Hammond fumble as he went into the end zone and tight end Steve Stephens recover the ball for a touchdown.\n\n(2) FSU moved 62 yards early in the second quarter, and Dave Cappelen kicked a 32-yard field goal.\n\n(3) Kincaid pounced on a fumble of OSU quarterback Harold Bailey at the Cowboy 35. Jordan popped a pass of about 15 yards to Johnson, who cut back and raced into the end zone for the TD.\n\n(4) Willie Jones claimed a Worley Taylor fumble at OSU's 32. Jordan pegged on right into the arms of a streaking Unglaub as he crossed the goal line.\n\n(5) Kincaid claimed another Taylor fumble, just after halftime, at the OSU eight. Johnson ran it in for the TD on a first-down play.\n\n(6) OSU marched 75 yards, Taylor scoring from the one.\n\n(7) The Seminoles moved 74 yards, mixing passes with runs in their best drive of the night. On a surprise play, fourth down and half-yard short of OSU's one, Jordan passed - to Johnson for the TD. (Jordan then retired for the evening.)\n\n(8) With Wally Woodham in at quarterback, FSU moved 47 yards on the heels of Kincaid's interception. Jackie Flowers caught two big passes in the movement. Mark Lyles, who ran 15 times for 45 yards, scored from the two.\n\n(9) OSU scored on Bailey's 6-yard run following recovery of the fumbled punt.\n\nWith all the fumbling, OSU punted just twice, FSU three times - freshman Rohn Stark averaging 43.3 on his boots.\n\nFlorida State was unable to hog the football, as it had last week against Syracuse. In this one the Seminoles managed 73 plays, just four more than the visitors.\n\nJim Stanley, the OSU coach, said Florida State was a team with a lot of character.\n\n\"You have to give them credit,\" he said. \"They are well coached. We went the distance against a fine football team. I'm disappointed in the loss but I'm not disappointed in these young men.\"\n\nSeminoles find themselves heap big horse.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, FL - A few months ago Bobby Bowden had a notion, and he spoke to some supporters about going out and finding a mascot of some sort for his Florida State football team.\n\nThe head coach remembered his time with the West Virginia Mountaineers when there was student competition for a mascot. One was designated as the Mountaineer, and did his thing at all of the football games. He remembered his earlier time ar Florida State when there was Sammy Seminole - often a student gymnast - who cavorted in his Indian makeup and did all sorts of acrobatic tricks.\n\nSo it was on Saturday, as Florida State opened its home football season, that a rider in Seminole dress suddenly appeared astride a horse - leading the football Seminoles onto the field for the game with Oklahoma State.\n\nIt was the first of a hoped-for-traditional bit that will continue, if not for evermore, then for many, many moons.\n\nBill Durham, assisted by others that included Bobby's wife Ann, was the supporter who put it all together.\n\nThe horse is a big one, 16 hands high, a chestnut Appaloosa with a white blanket on his rump, a gelding valued at about $3500. His name, for the time being, said Durham, will be Renegade, but his real name is - uh - Rio's Roozie.\n\nHe is on loan from Dr. Jerry DeLoney, a local veterinarian who purchased the 3-year-old horse out od North Carolina several months ago. A fan of the Seminoles for several years, Dr. DeLoney - and the rest of his family, for he insists that the horse belongs to all of the family - will donate him to Florida State next year \"if he is compatible, and it all works out.\"\n\nDr. DeLoney further describes the horse: \"He is Mr. Personality, absolutely no bad habits. Responds to love and affection with love and affection. He is distinguished, well marked, racey, long-legged, bigger than most Appaloosas, not yet fully mature. Well trained, he was shown in halter and western pleasure competition up in North Carolina.\"\n\nLeo Crutchfield donated a trailer to transport the horse at Florida State, and Dean Chenweth is presently caring for him.\n\nBut do horses fit in the tradition of the real Seminole Indians?\n\nDurham checked that out with Howard Tommie, chief of the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The chief said horses did fit in his tribe's tradition, that the Seminoles once had horses but the white man stole some and ran others off into the swamps. Chief Tommie not only approved of Florida State's project, but is having his people make a real Seminole outfit for the rider.\n\nThe rider is Jim Kidder, a junior, a criminology major from Pompano Beach. He was chosen from 180 student applicants. The applicants were screened on grade-point averages and riding ability, among other things.\n\nDuring home games the horse and rider will be between the 30 and goal line on the student side of the field.\n\nDurham has taken care of such details as liability insurance and made arrangements for prompt on-the-field attention if Renegade turns out not always to be as mannerly as he's supposed to be.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Oklahoma State 6 0 8 6 20 Florida State 0 17 7 14 38\n\n1st 0- 6 Opp, 0, fumble recovery/return (kick failed), 4:24 Note: Oklahoma State running back fumbled in the end zone; a teammate recovered the ball. 2nd 3- 6 Dave Cappelen, 32, field goal, 7:46 3- 6 Opp, 46, field goal failed, 3:12 10- 6 Homes Johnson, 35, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick), 1:31 17- 6 Kurt Unglaub, 32, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick), 1:12 3rd 17- 6 Opp, 53, field goal failed, 0:00 24- 6 Homes Johnson, 8, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 12:58 24-14 Opp, 1, run (run), 4:15 4th 31-14 Homes Johnson, 2, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick), 13:52 38-14 Mark Lyles, 1, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 8:43 38-20 Opp, 6, run (run failed), 3:14\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 22 20 Rushes-yards 39-138 55-240 Passing 268 67 Att-Comp-Int 34-21-0 14-5-1 Total Yards 73-406 69-307 Punt Returns 1--2 0-0 Kickoff Returns 3-28 5-111 Interception Ret. 1-5 0-0 Fumble Returns 5-0 3-0 Punts 3-43.3 2-37.0 Fumbles-Lost 3-3 6-5 Penalties-Yds 5-41 0-0 Attendance 40,338 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Homes Johnson 20 78 1 13 Mark Lyles 15 45 1 10 Ernie Sims 2 9 0 6 Keith Kennedy 1 4 0 4 Jimmy Jordan 1 2 0 2 --------------------------------------------- FSU 39 138 2 13 Opp 55 240 2 34 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Jackie Flowers 5 75 0 20 Kurt Unglaub 2 61 1 32t Homes Johnson 4 57 2 35t Mark Lyles 3 29 0 13 Grady King 3 24 0 11 Bill Keck 2 16 0 9 Keith Kennedy 1 6 0 6 Gator Cherry 1 0 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 21 268 3 35t Opp 5 67 0 37 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Jimmy Jordan 17 28 0 231 3 35t Wally Woodham 4 6 0 37 0 15 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 21 34 0 268 3 35t Opp 5 14 1 67 0 37 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Ivory Joe Hunter 1 -2 0 -2 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 -2 0 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Homes Johnson 3 28 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 3 28 0 Opp 5 111 0 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Rohn Stark 3 130 53 ---------------------------------------- FSU 3 130 53 Opp 2 74 40 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul Piurowski 7 8 15 . . . . . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nFlorida State 31, Miami 21\n\n09/23/1978, Miami\n\nFrom the Tallahassee Democrat, September 24, 1978, page 31, by Bill McGrotha.\n\nFSU recovers for 31-21 win.\n\nMIAMI, FL - Autumn arrived Saturday, and so did Ron Simmons.\n\nFrustrated by double-team blocking plus traps and draws in Florida State's first two football games, the sophomore nose guard was suddenly a dominating factor again.\n\nAnd the Seminoles, coming from behind twice, hung on to whip Miami in a strange, error-ridden game 31-21.\n\nSimmons blocked a Miami punt, and sophomore tackle Mark Macek (it is pronounced Mod-sic) picked up the bouncing football and rambled 48 yards for a Seminole touchdown. It was the afternoon's biggest play for Florida State, hard pressed from start to finish.\n\nThe blocked punt was one of seven turnovers for Miami, which also lost three fumbles and had three passes intercepted. Those turnovers made a decisive difference.\n\nBut Simmons caused other turnovers besides the blocked punt, precipitating at least one fumble and perhaps two with his bruising tackles. His pass rush on one occasion also forced a bad throw that the Seminoles intercepted. He recovered one big fumble, made several key tackles. ABC, which televised the game regionally, acclaimed him top defensive player for the afternoon and a $1,000 scholarship will go to Florida State in his name.\n\nIronically, Ottis Anderson, a strong and swift Miami running back, escaped from Simmons when he appeared to have him stopped cold, spun to the outside and raced 80 yards to a touchdown on Miami's first play from scrimmage. That was the first of several strange plays.\n\nAfter Florida State tied it 7-7 on the blocked-punt runback early in the second quarter, Miami went up 14-7 on a 48-yard flanker reverse by James Joiner. That one was strange because Joiner eluded cornerback Bobby Butler after the latter seemed to have him hemmed in for a loss.\n\nButler made amends. He intercepted two passes late in the action.\n\nWith the help of a pass-interference call that provided a first down at the Miami five, Florida State drove right back to the tie again (14-14). Jimmy Jordan passed three yards to Jackie Flowers for the touchdown.\n\nThat one was strange because cornerback cornerback Fred Azrak did not appear to be interfering with the Seminoles' Kurt Unglaub on the pass that brought the penalty. Unglaub said after the game Arzak had not touched him.\n\nGene Coleman, the Miami safety, had intercepted that Jordan pass. But instead of Miami getting the ball, Florida State got it - at the six.\n\n\"I'm just happy with the win,\" said Coach Bobby Bowden later. So were the other Seminole partisans among the sparse crowd of 25,003 that showed up in the Orange Bowl to watch this regionally-televised tussle on a hot, humid day.\n\n\"It was a struggle,\" said a depressed Lou Saban, coach of Miami. \"The big mistake (blocked punt) took the stuffing out of us.\n\n\"We can't afford mistakes because we are not strong enough offensively to hang onto the football. Most of the time we were in the hole. But you have to give them credit. They had two experienced quarterbacks, and we didn't.\"\n\nThe Seminoles went with Jordan all of the first half, with Wally Woodham in all of the winning last half.\n\nWoodham directed the Seminoles 41 yards to a touchdown that put them in front to stay early in the last quarter after a Rohn Stark punt had backed Miami to its 10 and the defense had held.\n\nStark, a freshman, had a memorable afternoon, punting eight times for a 46.8 yard average - including one 72-yarder.\n\nOn that go-ahead drive, the Seminoles twice called timeouts because of faulty communication. The phones from the pressbox (where FSU assistants were getting an overview of the action) to the bench were not working properly. And Florida State was signaling plays from the bench.\n\nAnyhow, Florida State stuck to the ground in the drive, with Mark Lyles and Homes Johnson running hard. On fourth-and-one Woodham sneaked across from the one, making it 21-14.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, the Seminoles failed to make it on a fourth-and-one run from the Miami 12. But after a punting exchange, Anderson fumbled and Simmons leaped on the ball for FSU at the Miami 5.\n\nA first-down run lost four yards, however. Three plays later Dave Cappelen booted a 26-yard field goal to make it 24-14 with 6:58 remaining.\n\nBut it wasn't over. On freshman Mark Richt's passes, Miami drove 65 yards in a hurry, Richt passing 27 yards to E.J. Baker for a TD that narrowed it to 24-21 with 4:27 left.\n\nOn top of that, Florida State mishandled the kickoff and had to start at its six. Miami got the ball back at its 45 with 2:43 to go, following another Stark punt.\n\nThen Butler picked off a third-down Richt pass and returned it 40 yards to Miami's 31. On fourth down at the 22, Woodham hit Lyles with a short swing pass, and the big fullback churned down the sidelines for a touchdown that made it a final 31-21 with a bit over a minute remaining.\n\nThere was time for Butler to intercept one more, at the FSU 34. Woodham fell on the ball three straight times as the clock ran out.\n\nAs the 13th-ranked Seminoles moved to 3-0, they were surprisingly out-gained by Miami, 325 yards to 263. Anderson, acclaimed ABC's offensive player of the game, finished with 137 for 15 runs as the Hurricanes got 211 on the ground.\n\nInterestingly, Florida State managed to control the ball, 75 plays to 51. Johnson bagged 90 yards running on 23 trips. Jordan was 8-for-12 with his passes but threw an interception that paved Miami's second touchdown. Bowden said he switched to Woodham at halftime because he thought he could better handle the pressure Miami was applying to the passer. Woodham was 6-for-12 on his throwing. Miami covered FSU's wide receivers well, and the backs caught most of FSU's passes - Lyles five and Johnson four.\n\nThe Seminoles pounced on three of five Miami fumbles, lost none of their two.\n\nTwo Miami players with Tallahassee ties, running back Chris Hobbs and quarterback Mike Rodrigue, did not play. Hobbs had an injury. Saban chose to go with two other quarterbacks after starting freshman Rodrigue a week ago.\n\nFSU returns home to play Houston next Saturday.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 0 14 7 10 31 Miami 7 7 0 7 21\n\n1st 0- 7 Opp, 80, run (kick), 9:27 2nd 7- 7 Mark Macek, 48, punt return/blocked punt (Dave Cappelen, kick), 2:03 Ron Simmons blocked a punt, Macek picked the ball up at the 48 and scored 7-14 Opp, 48, run (kick), 9:25 14-14 Jackie Flowers, 4, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick), 2:49 3rd 21-14 Wally Woodham, 1, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 8:15 4th 24-14 Dave Cappelen, 26, field goal, 7:02 24-21 Opp, 27, pass (kick), 4:27 31-21 Mark Lyles, 22, pass from Wally Woodham (Dave Cappelen, kick), 1:14\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 12 10 Rushes-yards 51-130 31-211 Passing 133 114 Att-Comp-Int 24-14-1 20-9-3 Total Yards 75-263 51-325 Punt Returns 2-64 2-12 Kickoff Returns 1-13 2-29 Interception Ret. 3-44 1-11 Fumble Returns 2-0 0-0 Punts 8-46.9 7-33.9 Sacks By-Yds 1- 2- Fumbles-Lost 2-0 5-2 Penalties-Yds 3-34 3-39 Time of Posession 37:26 22:34 Attendance 25,002 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Homes Johnson 23 90 0 26 Mark Lyles 16 61 0 15 Sam Platt 1 6 0 6 Keith Kennedy 1 4 0 4 Wally Woodham 6 0 1 8 Jimmy Jordan 4 -31 0 2 --------------------------------------------- FSU 51 130 1 26 Opp 31 211 2 80t Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mark Lyles 5 58 1 22t Kurt Unglaub 2 27 0 15 Homes Johnson 4 26 0 9 Jackie Flowers 2 14 1 11 Grady King 1 8 0 8 --------------------------------------------- FSU 14 133 2 22t Opp 9 114 1 27t Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Jimmy Jordan 8 12 1 83 1 17 Wally Woodham 6 12 0 50 1 22t ----------------------------------------------- FSU 14 24 1 133 2 22t Opp 9 20 3 114 1 27t Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mark Macek 0 48 1 48t Ron Simmons 1 15 0 15 Gary Henry 1 1 0 1 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 64 1 48t Opp 2 12 0 9 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Gator Cherry 1 13 0 13 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 13 0 13 Opp 2 29 0 24 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Rohn Stark 8 375 72 ---------------------------------------- FSU 8 375 72 Opp 7 237 77 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Walter Carter 7 1 8 . 1.0- . . . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nHouston 27, Florida State 21\n\n09/30/1978, Tallahassee\n\nFrom the Tallahassee Democrat, October 1, 1978, page 29, by Bill McGrotha.\n\n'Noles die by a penalty, 27-21.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, FL - Almost.\n\nBehind 27-0 after the first 20 minutes of play, Florida State's football team came within one penalty of registering the most astounding comeback in its history.\n\nHouston won the game 27-21 before a saddened Saturday night assembly of 41,142 in Campbell Stadium.\n\nWith 2:55 left in the game, Wally Woodham passed 22 yards to Jackie Flowers for an apparent touchdown - a touchdown that would have tied the game, and with the extra-point kick put Florida State in front 28-27.\n\nBut a Southwest Conference official's flag had fallen upfield. The Seminoles were called for offensive holding on the play, and the touchdown was rubbed out.\n\nAnd with that, Florida State's five-game winning streak, its unbeaten record this year, its top-10 rank came to an end as Houston's dominance of a series continued.\n\nNever, in seven tries, has Florida State beaten the Cougars in Tallahassee. In 16 games the Seminoles have managed two victories and two ties.\n\nFlorida State coaches were not sure who the holding penalty which killed that would-be touchdown was called on, but apparently senior tackle Nate Henderson was the one flagged.\n\n\"Yes sir,\" said 250-pound Leonard Mitchell of Houston, laughing in the Cougar locker room. \"That big Number 78 was grabbing my arm all night and spinning me around. I complained about it several times to the officials - and finally one of them called it.\"\n\nDespite the Seminoles' dramatic rally behind Woodham, Houston on this night was clearly the better team. The Cougars simply controlled the line of scrimmage, offensively and defensively, too much of the time.\n\nTaking over for Jimmy Jordan just after the score became 27-0, Woodham guided Florida State to touchdowns on three of the next four series - not counting the one when Florida State got the football at its 20 with just five seconds left in that half.\n\nMark Lyles, the big fullback, was another hero in defeat, running nine times for 64 yards, catching four big passes for 44 and scoring twice.\n\nHaving his best night, Flowers snared six passes for 165 yards.\n\nWoodham finished with 12 strikes in 18 attempts for 249 yards as the Seminoles totaled 304 yards of offense, compared with 411 for Houston - which got 307 in the first half.\n\nScoring the first four times it got its hands on the football, Houston initially moved 65 yards after the opening kickoff. Quarterback Danny Davis - a slippery dandy - passed 13 yards to Garrett Jurgajtis for the touchdown.\n\nThen the Cougars intercepted Jimmy Jordan's pass on FSU's first play from scrimmage, and were in business at FSU's 41. Emmett King scored the TD from 3 yards out.\n\nIn the first moment of the second quarter Houston made it 21-0, capping a 27-yard drive with a 4-yard payoff run by Randy Love.\n\nJust minutes later John Newhouse, on his only run of the night, broke tackles and skipped 56 yards for a final Houston touchdown.\n\nFSU defensive back Bobby Butler blocked the ensuing extra-point attempt - a feat that seemed to signal a turnaround in the Seminoles' manner of play.\n\nRight away Woodham came in and moved the team 60 yards. Lyles scored on a 19-yard romp up the middle and it was 27-7 at halftime.\n\nOn the Seminoles' second possession of the third quarter, Woodham hit Flowers with a 72-yard scoring bomb.\n\nA little later an interception by Monk Bonasorte set up the Seminoles at Houston's 44.\n\nLyles got to the 16 on a 26-yard pass, and soon scored on a 14-yard run off the ancient statue-of-liberty play. So it became 27-21 with plenty of time left.\n\nRight after that, FSU defenders backed Houston to its seven, forcing a punt. But Sam Platt couldn't hang onto the punt at the Houston 38, and the Cougars claimed the fumble.\n\nMoments later, as the fourth quarter unfolded, Willie Jones fell on an errant Houston pitchout at the Cougar 33. But three plays later Woodham's deep pass was intercepted.\n\nFlorida State's only other threat culminated in the pass to Flowers for the \"touchdown\" that was erased by the holding penalty.\n\nLed by King's 142 yards in 26 carries, Houston rolled to 25 first downs - 18 in the first half alone - and controlled the ball, 78 plays to 56. For a long while, FSU defenders seemed unable to cope with Houston's dazzling option offense.\n\nLate Friday, with clouds threatening, Florida State covered Campbell Stadium's turf with a tarpaulin, and the field was bone dry for action despite Saturday's steady rain that stopped in mid-afternoon. That dry field may have proved more to Houston's advantage than FSU's. The visitors seemed the faster, quicker team.\n\n\"There wasn't anything sinister about what we did,\" Houston Coach Bill Yeoman said.\n\n\"We just had to rear back and attack. We've been timid in our first couple of games, because we're so young.\n\n\"I'll tell you, Florida State is one fine football team, friend. If you think you're going to shut them down, you've got another thing coming.\"\n\nFSU Coach Bobby Bowden said he couldn't figure out how his players managed to stop Houston in the second half after the Cougar's clear dominance in the first.\n\n\"Our kids played a great second half,\" he said. \"This game was really something.\n\n\"That option veer is tough to defense when you don't run it yourself. Nobody runs it better than Houston.\"\n\nBefore the game Bowden had reckoned that Houston would score at least 28 points unless it fumbled. The Cougars lost one fumble, had one pass swiped. FSU had three turnovers, including two interceptions.\n\nRohn Stark punted three times for the Seminoles, averaging 46.3.\n\n\"This game did give me a lot of personal confidence,\" said Woodham. \"I still wasn't really happy. My job was to bring the team back and win. And I didn't.\"\n\nFlorida State plays another game in Campbell Stadium next Saturday, against Cincinnati.alf\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Houston 14 13 0 0 27 Florida State 0 7 14 0 21\n\n1st 0- 7 Opp, 13, pass (kick), 11:34 0-14 Opp, 3, run (kick), 8:49 0-14 Dave Cappelen, 43, field goal failed, 3:20 2nd 0-21 Opp, 4, run (kick), 14:18 0-27 Opp, 56, run (kick blocked by Bobby Butler), 10:15 7-27 Mark Lyles, 19, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 6:50 7-27 Opp, 35, field goal failed, 0:05 3rd 14-27 Jackie Flowers, 72, pass from Wally Woodham (Dave Cappelen, kick), 7:15 21-27 Mark Lyles, 14, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 1:10\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 20 25 Rushes-yards 24-79 67-332 Passing 305 79 Att-Comp-Int 32-20-2 11-7-1 Total Yards 56-384 78-411 Punt Returns 3-12 1-9 Kickoff Returns 5-67 4-63 Interception Ret. 1-1 2-32 Fumble Returns 1-0 1-0 Punts 3-46.3 4-37.0 Fumbles-Lost 1-1 2-1 Penalties-Yds 5-45 8-48 Attendance 41,142 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mark Lyles 9 64 2 19t Homes Johnson 13 42 0 10 Jimmy Jordan 1 -13 0 -13 Wally Woodham 1 -14 0 -14 --------------------------------------------- FSU 24 79 2 19t Opp 67 332 3 56t Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Jackie Flowers 6 165 1 72t Mark Lyles 4 44 0 26 Grady King 5 40 0 25 Sam Platt 2 38 0 20 Kurt Unglaub 1 16 0 16 Homes Johnson 2 2 0 4 --------------------------------------------- FSU 20 305 1 72t Opp 7 79 1 15 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Wally Woodham 12 18 1 249 1 72t Jimmy Jordan 8 14 1 56 0 16 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 20 32 2 305 1 72t Opp 7 11 1 79 1 15 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Keith Jones 2 7 0 Sam Platt 1 5 0 5 --------------------------------------------- FSU 3 12 0 5 Opp 1 9 0 9 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Keith Kennedy 2 26 0 Homes Johnson 2 23 0 Michael Whiting 1 18 0 18 --------------------------------------------- FSU 5 67 0 18 Opp 4 63 0 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Rohn Stark 3 139 55 ---------------------------------------- FSU 3 139 55 Opp 4 148 37 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paul Piurowski 3 14 17 . . . . . . . . .

Last chance for the Seminoles. And Jimmy Jordan hit Sam Platt with a pass that the sophomore speedster converted into a 54-yard scoring play with 1:29 left, providing a dramatic 26-21 victory over a stubborn Cincinnati football team here Saturday night.\n\nFor struggling FSU, it was trouble all the way.\n\nCincinnati got first turn with the football, starting at its 27 following the game's opening kickoff. Six straight runs - freshman Allen Harvin on four of them - led to the Cincy 48. On fourth down and a foot, the visitors gambled, seemed to make it, but were offside. A punt left FSU at its 29.\n\nWide receiver Kurt Unglaub was sidelined after injuring his knee in a pre-game warmup and Sam Platt started for him. Wally Woodham, opening at quarterback, overshot receivers on a couple of passes, and Rohn Stark punted to the Cincinnati 38.\n\nBehind Harvin's running and a Tony Kapetanis keeper for a key first down, the Bearcats pushed to a first down at FSU's 35. But on a third-and-2 at the 27, Scott Warren nailed Kapetanis for no gain. Then, on fourth-and-2, the quarterback was inches short on another keeper.\n\nWoodham missed on three more passes, and a penalty cost FSU 5. Stark's 31-yard punt gave Cincinnati a start from its 40.\n\nA 16-yard pass to Mike Frisina gained the 36. Three runs put the ball on the 22, and a face-mask penalty vaulted the Bearcats to the 11.\n\nMoving to his right, Kapetanis was trapped - but pulled out and sliced the other way, to the 1. Aaron Hagans raced wide for the touchdown, and a point kick made it 7-0.\n\nFrom the 20, four straight Mark Lyles runs gained the 36. Then Woodham passed over the middle to Lyles, who dug to the Cincinnati 39. On a keeper, Woodham got eight to the 31, as the quarter ended.\n\nAfter a first down at the 29, the Seminoles probed on - helped by a penalty - to another at the 18. From there Woodham passed to Jackie Flowers for a touchdown. Dave Cappelen tied it 7-7 with a kick.\n\nAfter holding Cincinnati at its 27, Florida State forced a punt and began at its 43. Flowers soon snared a 29-yard pass at the Bearcat 24. Three plays later Flowers grabbed a 17-yarder at the 1. Woodham sneaked across for the TD and Cappelen's boot brought it to 14-7.\n\nAgain the defense limited Cincinnati's offense to three downs, and again FSU got the ball at its 43 following a punt.\n\nThen they swapped fumbles. On first down, Lyles lost the ball, and Bob Prats got it for Cincinnati at FSU's 40. On the next play Harvin lost it and the Seminoles' Mark Macek claimed it at the 37.\n\nSoon Ernie Sims popped on a wide run, 16 to the Cincinnati 40. But the Seminoles got no further. Stark punted out of bounds at the 8.\n\nOn third down, Kapetanis, slipping wide, scooted 25 yards to the 36. Two Seminoles - Scott Warren, Bobby Butler - were hurt on the play.\n\nThird down at the 38 saw Kapetanis apparently trapped by a safety blitz, but he eluded Monk Bonasorte, stepped forward, and fired long to split end Mike Cusumano, who had gotten behind Mike Smith and Mike Kincaid. It was a 62-yard scoring play, and a kick by Steve Schultz tied it 14-14.\n\nA kickoff left FSU at its 16. The Seminoles struggled to the 24 before Stark punted 36 yards to the Cincinnati 40 with 1:30 left.\n\nWith 28 seconds left the visitors reached FSU's 37 on a 19-yard pass to Frisina. But Bonasorte intercepted at the 2 with 19 seconds left, and Woodham killed the clock.\n\nAt this point Cincinnati had outyarded FSU, 230 to 160. Woodham had hit only six of 14 passes.\n\nFlorida State moved from its 20 following the third-quarter kickoff. Short passes to Bill Keck and Flowers reached the 37. Homes Johnson broke for 15 to the Bearcat 48. But Woodham was hit hard as he missed on a pass. Two plays later Mike Brookins intercepted a Woodham throw over the middle, at the Cincinnati 42.\n\nHarvin raced for 17 yards, then 9. Kapetanis passed to Joe Eilerman at the 20. Harvin went wide to the 7. Three plays later Ellis Johnson scored from the two, and a point put Cincinnati back on top 21-14.\n\nTediously, the Seminoles drove from their 20. On third down at the 27, Lyles caught a pass for 10. Short gainers led on to a first down at the Cincinnati 42. Flowers caught a third-down pass for 11 at the 30, to keep it going. On fourth down at the 27 a pass to Ernie Sims gained the 20. On a reverse, Sam Platt made the 14. But that was all. A fourth-down pass missed, and Cincinnati took over.\n\nBut soon, on the first play of the last quarter, Cincinnati had to punt out of that hole. FSU got the ball at the visitors' 47.\n\nIn came Jimmy Jordan - only to throw a first-down pass that Dan Vete intercepted at the Cincinnati 45.\n\nA 13-yard pass provided a first down at FSU's 30. But Seminole defenders held. A punt left FSU at its 9.\n\nOn a fake reverse, Johnson swept to the 22. Johnson ran twice more, to the 30. Then Flowers pulled in a 15-yard Jordan pass at the 45. Johnson knocked off 9. Flowers couldn't quite hang on to a bomb, the ball rolling out of his arms as he fell into the end zone.\n\nBut after Johnson ran for a first down at the 40, Flowers caught one at the 26 - and soon grabbed another at the 12. Two runs left the Seminoles at the three, but Johnson was caught for a 2-yard loss at the five.\n\nOn fourth down, Jordan found Grady King in the end zone for a touchdown. With 6:09 remaining, Cappelen lined up for a point try - but it was a fake, with Woodham, down to hold, roaring up and throwing in vain.\n\nFrom its 20, Cincinnati managed a first down, but got no further. With 4:14 to go, FSU got the ball after a punt at its 44.\n\nLyles caught a short one, at the 50. A pass missed, and a fumble on a handoff was reclaimed by Johnson. On fourth down, Flowers kept it going with a catch at Cincinnati's 42. Howie Kurnick, two plays later, sacked Jordan for a loss of 12.\n\nBut on 4th-and-22, Jordan found Platt at the 35, and the Jacksonville sophomore cut swiftly to the sideline and stepped down it to score on a 54-yard play.\n\nThe Seminoles went for two. A pass missed, but Cincinnati was offsides.\n\nThen Johnson was stopped short on a wide run, leaving it 26-21 with 1:29 left.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Cincinnati 7 7 7 0 21 Florida State 0 14 0 12 26\n\n1st 0- 7 Opp, 2, run (kick), 3:42 2nd 7- 7 Jackie Flowers, 18, pass from Wally Woodham (Dave Cappelen, kick), 13:40 14- 7 Wally Woodham, 1, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 9:03 14-14 Opp, 62, pass (kick), 2:50 3rd 14-21 Opp, 2, run (kick), 9:07 4th 20-21 Grady King, 5, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Wally Woodham, pass failed), 6:09 26-21 Sam Platt, 54, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Mark Lyles, run failed), 1:29\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 22 16 Rushes-yards 46-155 45-196 Passing 249 165 Att-Comp-Int 40-18-2 22-12-1 Total Yards 86-404 67-361 Punt Returns 2-11 1-7 Kickoff Returns 2-36 2-41 Interception Ret. 1-0 1-0 Fumble Returns 1-0 1-0 Punts 4-34.5 6-30.7 Fumbles-Lost 3-1 1-1 Penalties-Yds 3-21 5-25 Attendance 39,599 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Homes Johnson 18 71 0 14 Mark Lyles 14 46 0 8 Ernie Sims 5 25 0 16 Wally Woodham 6 19 1 8 Sam Platt 1 6 0 6 Jimmy Jordan 2 -12 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 46 155 1 16 Opp 45 196 2 25 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Jackie Flowers 9 134 1 29 Sam Platt 1 54 1 54t Mark Lyles 5 41 0 23 Bill Keck 1 8 0 8 Ernie Sims 1 7 0 7 Grady King 1 5 1 5t --------------------------------------------- FSU 18 249 3 54t Opp 12 165 1 62t Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Wally Woodham 11 27 1 135 1 29 Jimmy Jordan 7 13 1 114 2 54t ----------------------------------------------- FSU 18 40 2 249 3 54t Opp 12 22 1 165 1 62t Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Keith Jones 2 11 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 11 0 Opp 1 7 0 7 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Sam Platt 2 36 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 36 0 Opp 2 41 0 25 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Rohn Stark 4 138 38 ---------------------------------------- FSU 4 138 38 Opp 6 184 36 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Reggie Herring 4 7 11 . . . . . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nMississippi State 55, Florida State 27\n\n10/14/1978, Starkville, Miss.\n\nFrom the Tallahassee Democrat, October 15, 1978, page 27, by Bill McGrotha.\n\nOffensive blitz rips FSU 55-27.\n\nSTARKVILLE, MS - Live by the sword, die by the sword.\n\nBusting loose for three touchdowns within a third-quarter playing span of 3 minutes and 24 seconds, Mississippi State came from behind and mauled Florida State's football team 55-27 here Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe forward pass - a weapon employed so effectively for so long by the Seminoles - was the instrument of Florida State's destruction.\n\nAnd the scope of that destruction on this sunny, windy and cool afternoon is reflected in that never before in a 32-year history had any team run up as many total yards against Florida State, nor had an opponent passed for as many yards.\n\nMississippi State gained 378 yards passing, 596 total. (Previous highs against FSU: 359 and 590 by San Diego State in 0-11 season of 1973.)\n\nInterestingly, FSU coaches had guessed correctly prior to the game that Mississippi State would throw the ball all over the field. The Seminoles expected it. It was just that an injury-riddled secondary and an overall inexperienced defense - seven sophomores are starting - could not do anything about it.\n\nJames Jones, a 5-10, 200-pound tailback from Vicksburg, scored four touchdowns for the Bulldogs and passed for another as a Homecoming crowd, liberally estimated at 35,000, whooped it up.\n\nMore damaging, however, was the throwing of 6-2 senior quarterback Dave Marler, a former walk-on who got his big chance because he also can kick the football - extra points, field goals, kickoffs.\n\n\"We just got the heck beat out of us,\" said FSU Coach Bobby Bowden, \"I thought their quarterback was the difference.\"\n\nAn 18-mile-per-hour wind, blowing strong through wide-open end zones, also was a factor.\n\nFSU had that wind going its way in the second quarter, when it scored three touchdowns, and in the last quarter, when it did not matter. Mississippi State had the wind with it in the first quarter, when it jumped in front 14-0, and in the third, when it got 21 more points - and was at FSU's 1, about to score seven more, when that quarter ended.\n\nThat wind played havoc with the punting games of both teams in the early going. Mississippi State was not forced to punt in the last half..\n\nWhile the home team was stacking up 596 yards of offense, Florida State was cutting out 427, with 297 passing. The Bulldogs got 27 first downs, FSU 25.\n\nIt was a day when Florida State might have scored 55 points itself, for it was no day for defense on either side.\n\nMarler hit 17 of 31 throws for 307 yards and three of the five touchdowns that the Bulldogs got passing. Reserve tailback Len Copeland tossed for one, James for the other. Mardye McDole, a talented sophomore wide receiver, hauled in 9 passes for a whopping 175 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nJimmy Jordan went all the way at quarterback for FSU, after early indication that Wally Woodham would start. Woodham received a shoulder injury against Houston and aggravated it in the Cincinnati game. He had looked okay Friday, but he wasn't okay in Saturday warmups.\n\nJordan had favored a sprained ankle much of the practice week, but it seemed not to bother him during the game. He hurt his hip slightly in the first half, and that may have bothered him, for he was not as sharp. He finished with 20 completions in 43 attempts for 297 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nHere's how the scoring went:\n\nMarler pass to Jones for 27 yards, capping a 60-yard drive.\n\nMarler pass to Jones for 11 yards, climaxing a 47-yard movement that started with a recovery of a Florida State fumbled pitchout.\n\nJordan pass to Jackie Flowers (who caught 9 in the game for 116 yards) for 8, coming early in the second quarter after a 70-yard drive highlighted by the ball-carrying of Homes Johnson, cutting the score to 14-7.\n\nJordan pass to Sam Platt for 10 yards on the heels of a 52-yard push following a 10-yard Mississippi State punt into the wind, tying the game 14-14.\n\nJohnson's 1-yard run after Mike Kincaid blocked a punt at the Mississippi State 16 and a pass-interference call gave FSU a first down at the one, coming 20 seconds before halftime and providing the Seminoles with a 21-14 lead.\n\nJones' 12-yard touchdown run, after a drive of 84 yards highlighted by a 41-yard Marler pass to Bo Myrick, but with Marler missing the extra-point attempt, leaving FSU in front 21-20.\n\nJames Otis Doss' 29-yard run up the middle following a 70-yard punt ignited by a 28-yard Marler pass to Copeland, with Marler throwing to Jones for two points, making it 28-21.\n\nA 34-yard Jones pass to McDole on the play after Richard Blackmore intercepted a Jordan pass.\n\nJones' 1-yard plunge on the first play of the last quarter, after passes had covered most of the distance in a 68-yard drive, jumping the score to 42-21.\n\nCopeland pass to McDole for 36 as M-State moved 84 yards, Marler setting it up with a 32-yard throw to Jones.\n\nMarler pass to Mill Maxey for two, after recovery of a fumbled kickoff at FSU's 29, bringing it to 55-21 with 8:28 remaining in the game.\n\nJordan's 52-yard pass to Gator Cherry with about six minutes remaining.\n\nOnly twice in history have opponents scored more than 55 points on Florida State. Auburn won 57-21 in 1960, Virginia Tech 56-21 in 1974.\n\nNow 4-2, same as Mississippi State, the Seminoles play at Pittsburgh next Saturday afternoon.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 0 21 0 6 27 Mississippi State 14 0 21 20 55\n\n1st 0- 7 Opp, 27, pass (kick), 12:40 0-14 Opp, 11, pass (kick), 4:24 0-14 Opp, 47, field goal failed, 1:43 2nd 7-14 Jackie Flowers, 8, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick), 14:43 14-14 Sam Platt, 10, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick), 8:10 14-14 Dave Cappelen, 42, field goal failed, 2:05 21-14 Homes Johnson, 1, run (Dave Cappelen, kick), 0:20 3rd 21-20 Opp, 12, run (kick failed), 8:55 21-28 Opp, 29, run (pass), 6:22 21-35 Opp, 34, pass (kick), 5:31 4th 21-42 Opp, 1, run (kick), 14:57 21-49 Opp, 37, pass (kick), 9:59 21-55 Opp, 2, pass (kick failed), 8:28 27-55 Gator Cherry, 52, pass from Jimmy Jordan (Dave Cappelen, kick failed), 6:41\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 25 27 Rushes-yards 45-130 40-218 Passing 297 378 Att-Comp-Int 43-20-2 34-19-1 Total Yards 88-427 74-596 Punt Returns 1--1 1-2 Kickoff Returns 2-25 2-44 Interception Ret. 1-2 2-16 Fumble Returns 0-0 1-0 Punts 5-27.0 3-13.3 Fumbles-Lost 1-1 0-0 Penalties-Yds 5-24 4-45 Attendance 35,000 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Homes Johnson 15 79 1 19 Ernie Sims 7 55 0 21 Mark Lyles 6 21 0 4 Greg Ramsey 9 3 0 11 Sam Platt 1 -4 0 -4 Jimmy Jordan 7 -24 0 3 --------------------------------------------- FSU 45 130 1 21 Opp 40 218 3 29t Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Jackie Flowers 9 116 1 16 Gator Cherry 2 55 1 52t Mark Lyles 3 50 0 24 Homes Johnson 2 34 0 27 Sam Platt 2 25 1 15 Greg Ramsey 1 14 0 14 Ernie Sims 1 3 0 3 --------------------------------------------- FSU 20 297 3 52t Opp 19 378 5 41 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Jimmy Jordan 20 43 2 297 3 52t ----------------------------------------------- FSU 20 43 2 297 3 52t Opp 19 34 1 378 5 41 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Keith Jones 1 -1 0 -1 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 -1 0 Opp 1 2 0 2 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Keith Kennedy 1 19 0 19 Gator Cherry 1 6 0 6 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 25 0 19 Opp 2 44 0 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Rohn Stark 5 135 48 ---------------------------------------- FSU 5 135 48 Opp 3 40 40 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Keith Jones 6 2 8 1.0- 2.0 . . . . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nPittsburgh 7, Florida State 3\n\n10/21/1978, Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\nFrom the Tallahassee Democrat, October 22, 1978, page 29, by Bill McGrotha.\n\nFSU defense shines in 7-3 loss.\n\nPITTSBURGH, PA - Those pussycats of a week prior turned into tigers.\n\nAnd swarming Florida State defenders, led by sophomores Monk Bonasorte, Reggie Herring and Ron Simmons, out-played Pittsburgh at its own prideful game.\n\nBur, in a stinging twist of irony, Florida State's offense failed to score a touchdown for the first time in 28 games, and the Seminoles lost a football game 7-3 before a homecoming crowd of 55,104 on a pleasant, sunny Saturday afternoon.\n\nEarly and late, the Seminoles had their chances, but could not cut it in a hard-knocking duel marred by rusty officiating.\n\nThe officials, among other things, appeared hesitant. They threw late flags, ignored what looked like repeated motion in the Pitt backfield, and made several debatable calls.\n\nOne call - beyond and reasonable question a wrong one - perhaps cost the Seminoles an upset victory.\n\nWith Florida State leading 3-0 early in the second quarter, Sam Platt pulled in a bomb from Jimmy Jordan at about the 50 and cruising on into the end zone, appearing to score on an 89-yard play. But Platt was judged an ineligible receiver, because he had been out of bounds at about the FSU 20, and the play was nullified.\n\nNew college rules, which went into effect this year, permit a receiver to come back in and catch a pass If he is pushed of forced out of bounds by a defender. Platt declared, after the game, that he was forced out of bounds by crowding defensive back, and FSU coaches concurred.\n\nCoach Bobby Bowden said he talked to officials at halftime, but got no satisfaction.\n\n\"I didn't talk to the one who called that play,\" he said. \"Couldn't find him.\"\n\nWith 1:44 left in the game, FSU's last realistic chance to win went down the drain when Mark Lyles was ruled to have fumbled at the Pitt 21. Florida State folks thought Lyles - who had his best running day with an even 100 yards in 17 carries - had been stopped cold, and that the play should have been blown dead.\n\nOnly minutes prior to that Jordan had passed the Seminoles to a first down at the Pitt 19. But a fierce pass rush, led by end Hugh Green, forced him to hurry following throws, and the Seminoles ran out of downs.\n\nThe tone of the game - reflecting Florida State frustration - was set early, however.\n\nTwice the Seminoles got the football inside Pitt territory, at the 27 and 49, in those early minutes, following fumble recoveries by Arthur Scott and Keith Jones.\n\nOn the first opportunity FSU pushed to the 4, but Dave Cappelen missed a 21-yard try for a field goal on fourth down. On the second chance, the Seminoles got as far as the 10. This time Cappelen put through a 26-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead that broke FSU's first-quarter scoring drought.\n\nBoth field-goal attempts were from difficult angles, the right hash-mark.\n\nIn the second quarter, a 58-yard punt by Joe Gasparovic put the Seminoles in a hole at their 19. When Rohn Stark punted back, Pitt got the ball at the 50.\n\nEight plays - all on the ground - brought the game's only touchdown, Rooster Jones scoring on a 14-yard option sweep, putting the final score of 7-3 on the board with 3:29 left in the half.\n\nBonasorte, the Seminoles' free safety from Pittsburgh, played like a madman.\n\nA pressbox count credited him in on 18 tackles, including seven outright - but it seemed like more. He appeared to cause two of Pitt's early fumbles. During one series, Bonasorte made three straight tackles.\n\nSimmons, the nose guard, also seemed to be all over the field, though the pressbox statistician had him in on only 11 tackles, five outright. Linebacker Herring was credited with involvement in 17 tackles, six outright.\n\nGoing most of the way at quarterback, Jordan hit on 15 of 32 passed for 154 yards but had three interceptions. Wally Woodham, playing only in two third-quarter series, completed six of 10 for 66. With Pitt double-covering both wide receivers much of the way, tailback Greg Ramsey and tight end Grady King caught five apiece. Wide receivers speared only five of FSU's 21 completions.\n\nThough Gordon Jones - highly gifted receiver of Pitt - pulled in seven passes for 86 yards, quarterback Rick Trocano had only two other completions in 19 shots and got just 99 yards out of the whole.\n\nAnd this was the same FSU defense that had been riddled for five touchdown passes and a school-record number of yards by Mississippi State the week previous.\n\nThe Seminoles out-gained Pitt, 331 yards to 297. Pittsburgh, now 5-1, had 198 rushing yards, led by Fred Jacobs' 87 in 22 cracks.\n\n\"Their secondary was very tough,\" said Jones, the Pitt receiver. \"I'm glad it's over.\"\n\nJones caught most of his passes over the middle, often one of the tougher areas.\n\nEach team had four turnovers - three of FSU's on interceptions, three of Pitt's on fumbles. Pitt drew 60 penalty yards, the Seminoles 52.\n\nIn the third quarter, with Woodham, the Seminoles penetrated to first downs at Pitt's 37 and 35, but got no further.\n\nBacked to its 3 by a third-quarter Stark punt, Pitt got out of the hole when Keith Jones fumbled a punt at the Panther 45, Pitt recovering. Earlier, Jones had recovered a Pitt fumble and intercepted a pass.\n\nEarly in the last quarter Pitt drove to FSU's 19, but the defense called a halt on the fourth-and-1 run.\n\nNow 4-3, Florida State plays its third successive homecoming game Saturday afternoon at Southern Mississippi.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 3 0 0 0 3 Pittsburgh 0 7 0 0 7\n\n1st 0- 0 Dave Cappelen, 21, field goal failed, 12:20 3- 0 Dave Cappelen, 26, field goal, 4:33 2nd 3- 7 Opp, 13, run (kick), 3:29\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 19 17 Rushes-yards 33-111 57-198 Passing 220 99 Att-Comp-Int 42-21-3 20-9-1 Total Yards 75-331 77-297 Punt Returns 3-3 1-1 Kickoff Returns 1-16 0-0 Interception Ret. 1-21 3-12 Fumble Returns 3-0 2-0 Punts 7-39.4 9-41.2 Fumbles-Lost 3-0 4-3 Penalties-Yds 6-52 8-60 Attendance 55,104 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Mark Lyles 17 100 0 22 Greg Ramsey 9 32 0 8 Gator Cherry 2 11 0 8 Wally Woodham 2 -14 0 -5 Jimmy Jordan 3 -18 0 -4 --------------------------------------------- FSU 33 111 0 22 Opp 57 198 1 20 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Grady King 5 55 0 14 Jackie Flowers 3 48 0 19 Greg Ramsey 5 36 0 16 Kurt Unglaub 1 23 0 23 Mark Lyles 4 17 0 14 Sam Platt 1 17 0 17 Bill Keck 1 12 0 12 Gator Cherry 1 12 0 12 --------------------------------------------- FSU 21 220 0 23 Opp 9 99 0 18 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Jimmy Jordan 15 32 3 154 0 19 Wally Woodham 6 10 0 66 0 23 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 21 42 3 220 0 23 Opp 9 20 1 99 0 18 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Keith Jones 3 3 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 3 3 0 Opp 1 1 0 1 Kic"
