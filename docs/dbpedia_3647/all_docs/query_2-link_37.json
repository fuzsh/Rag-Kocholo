        "text": "As the 2024 season is upon us, Alabama will need players to step up. Two players that will be vital for the Crimson Tide are Malachi Moore and Jalen Milroe. Both players were named to the Walter Camp Award Watchlist, an award that highlights the most outstanding player in college football.\n\nMalachi Moore will be one of the leaders of this year's defense. A former four-star prospect out of Hewitt-Trussville High School, Moore had a career 156 tackles, 5 tackles for loss, and 5 interceptions (2 of those for touchdowns). Last season for the Crimson Tide, Moore was selected as one of the Crimson Tide's team captains. Moore had 30 solo tackles, assisted 22 tackles, which totaled 52 tackles, and broke 5 passes. Moore was selected to the watchlist for the Lott and Nagurski trophies as the nation's top defender. Moore was also selected for the Wuerffel Trophy Watchlist for his community service.\n\nEntering his junior season, Jalen Milore will continue from last season as he will lead this year's offense. Milroe is the highest-ranking returning player from the 2023 season who garnered a Heisman vote. He finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy race last season. Milroe completed 65.8% of his passes in 2023, totaling 2,834 yards with a 23-6 touchdown/interception ratio. Milroe also ran for 531 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground. Milroe earned second-team All-SEC recognition from the Associated Press and was a finalist for the Manning Award.\n\nThe Walter Camp Award is named after Walter Camp, the \"Father of American Football.\" Camp was instrumental in changing rugby football into today's American game.\n\nCamp participated in the first Yale-Harvard rugby game in 1876 and later served as captain of Yale's varsity squad from 1877 to 1882. Yale's record under his leadership was excellent, with 25 wins, one loss, and six draws.Camp's original contributions include the play from scrimmage, the numerical scoring of goals and tries, and the reduction of team size to eleven players.\n\nHis influence went beyond the game; he helped pick the inaugural All-America squad, emphasizing the importance of recognizing excellent players.\n\nOther players on this year's watchlist are:\n\nWR Elic Ayomanor, Stanford\n\nQB Carson Beck, Georgia\n\nWR/KR Zachariah Branch, USC\n\nRB Tahj Brooks, Texas Tech\n\nRB Antario Brown, NIU\n\nQB Byrum Brown, South Florida\n\nWR Luther Burden III, Missouri\n\nDE Abdul Carter, Penn State\n\nDT Howard Cross III, Notre Dame\n\nQB Jalon Daniels, Kansas\n\nQB Jaxson Dart, Ole Miss\n\nRB Donovan Edwards, Michigan\n\nWR Emeka Egbuka, Ohio State\n\nQB Quinn Ewers, Texas\n\nQB Noah Fifita, Arizona\n\nQB TJ Finley, WKU\n\nQB Dillon Gabriel, Oregon\n\nRB Ollie Gordon II, Oklahoma State\n\nQB Garrett Greene, West Virginia\n\nRB Omarion Hampton, North Carolina\n\nRB Jamal Haynes, Georgia Tech\n\nQB Seth Henigan, Memphis\n\nQB Will Howard, Ohio State\n\nWR Tory Horton, Colorado State\n\nWR/DB Travis Hunter, Colorado\n\nRB Ashton Jeanty, Boise State\n\nRB Quinshon Judkins, Ohio State\n\nQB Riley Leonard, Notre Dame\n\nTE Colston Loveland, Michigan\n\nQB Grayson McCall, NC State\n\nQB Kyle McCord, Syracuse\n\nQB Jordan McCloud, Texas State\n\nWR Tetairoa McMillan, Arizona\n\nQB Jalen Milroe, Alabama\n\nDB Malachi Moore, Alabama\n\nDT Walter Nolen, Ole Miss\n\nEDGE James Pearce Jr., Tennessee\n\nLB Harold Perkins Jr., LSU\n\nQB Cameron Rising, Utah\n\nQB Kaidon Salter, Liberty\n\nQB Shedeur Sanders, Colorado\n\nRB Nicholas Singleton, Penn State\n\nDB Malaki Starks, DB, Georgia\n\nRB Terion Stewart, Bowling Green\n\nLB Danny Stutsman, Oklahoma\n\nQB D.J. Uiagalelei, Florida State\n\nQB Cam Ward, Miami\n\nDB Xavier Watts, Notre Dame\n\nQB Conner Weigman, Texas A&M\n\nWR Ricky White, UNLV\n\nAlabama opens its 2024 season on Aug. 31 at home against Western Kentucky.
