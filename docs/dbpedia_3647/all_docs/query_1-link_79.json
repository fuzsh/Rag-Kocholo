        "text": "GREENSBORO – The Guilford County Sports Hall of Fame added 12 new members with the Class of 2023 announced Wednesday.\n\nThere are 10 laureates plus two members of the Legends Class for those deceased.\n\nThis is the 18th class of athletes, coaches and contributors to be inducted into the Hall, which was created in 2005. It increases the membership to 197.\n\nThe newest inductees were introduced at a press conference at the Greensboro Coliseum. GCSHOF Board Chairman Bryan Norris presented a check for $1,000 to Beyond Sports, a Greensboro nonprofit. Norris also announced the creation of a scholarship fund which will award graduating student-athlete seniors with $1,000 towards their college tuition. The GCSHOF will begin taking applications in August.\n\nThe induction reception and banquet will be held on Tuesday, Sept. 19, at the Coliseum. Tickets for the reception and banquet are $90 and tables for 10 are $900. They will be available online at the GCSHOF website (gcshof.org).\n\nBiographies of the Class of 2023 follow in alphabetical order:\n\nKenny Carter\n\nThe basketball court at High Point Central is named in Kenny Carter’s honor following a 24-year coaching career in which his girls teams compiled an overall record of 573-125 and won five NCHSAA state titles (1993, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2002). His resume also includes 14 conference championships, 15 tournament championships and 10 undefeated seasons in conference play. He was selected as the North Carolina Associated Press Coach of the Year in 1997 and 2002. His teams posted four 30-win seasons, 20 seasons of 20 wins or more, and 41 of his high school players were awarded college scholarships. Carter is also the founder and director of Xpress Travel Ball, which has sent more than 100 players to the college ranks. A native of High Point, Carter played multiple prep sports and went on to star in baseball at High Point College. A four-year starting Panthers infielder, he twice earned All-Carolinas Conference honors and was named NAIA second-team All-America as a senior in 1982. He earned all-tournament honors at the 1979 NAIA National Championships, where he helped High Point to a second-place finish. Carter’s HPC teams posted an overall record of 110-61-1 while winning three Carolinas Conference titles. He played one year of minor league baseball with the St. Louis Cardinals organization before embarking on his successful career as an educator and coach. Carter was inducted into the High Point Central Hall of Fame in 2017.\n\nDr. Snow Brenner Daws\n\nSnow Brenner ranked among the region’s top female soccer and basketball players during her high school days at High Point Central, but many in Guilford County remember her best as a trailblazer on the gridiron. One of the first female athletes to play high school football in North Carolina, she achieved all-conference honors as a placekicker in her senior year, when she kicked the game-winning field goal in the Regional Championship to advance the Bison to the State Finals. She became the first female in North Carolina to play in a state championship football game. Brenner set a national record for points scored by a female and became the first female to win a National Football Foundation College Hall of Fame Scholarship. In 2012 – more than 15 years after her graduation – she was rated the fourth-best female kicker in high school history. As a five-sport athlete at High Point Central, Brenner also put up staggering numbers on the soccer field, where she was twice all-conference and all-region, and earned all-region honors in basketball. A two-time soccer team MVP and captain at Central, she went on to play soccer for four years at Duke University, earned her medical degree from the Wake Forest University Bowman Gray School of Medicine and is now a practicing orthopedic surgeon at Orthopedic Surgery Foot and Ankle Fellowship at UC-Davis/Reno Orthopedic Clinic. She was inducted into the George Whitfield Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nPam Doggett\n\nStarring at Dudley High and as a Junior Olympian, Pam Doggett established herself as one of the nation’s top teenage sprinters of the 1980s. An eight-time high school state champion who set six meet records, she was named the North Carolina High School Athletic Association Female Athlete of the Year in 1986 (for all sports), as well as the North Carolina Gatorade Track & Field Girls Athlete of the Year. The MVP of the 1986 3A/4A Championships, Doggett’s state records included an all-class record in the 300-meter hurdles that stood for 25 years and a 1986 USATF National Junior Olympic 4x100 relay mark with three Dudley teammates that stood for two decades. She was also the in the Junior Olympic 100-meter hurdles in 1983 and 1986 and in the 1983 heptathlon. Doggett also made her mark at the international level in 1984 when she finished second at the USATF Juniors in the heptathlon, which qualified her for Team USA in the Pan American Junior Championships. That made her the first-ever Guilford County USATF athlete to qualify and compete in international competition. She placed third at the 1984 Pan Am Juniors Championship. Doggett was honored as one of “100 to Remember” at the NCHSAA Centennial Celebration in 2013 and inducted into the North Carolina High School Track and Field Hall of Fame Class of 2023.

He earned honorable mention All-State from the Greensboro News and Record that senior season and chose nearby Wake Forest to continue his collegiate academic and athletic careers. Elkins started three years at quarterback for the Demon Deacons and graduated as the program’s all-time leading passer with 7,304 yards and 43 touchdowns. His name remains among the top 10 of most Wake Forest career passing records. Elkins was voted the 1986 North Carolina College Football Player of the Year by the Raleigh Sports Club.

The High Point native made her mark as one of the state’s premier high school basketball players at Andrews in the late ‘90s, continued to star as a collegian at Wake Forest and then parlayed her love for the game into a successful career as a coach and administrator. Harris earned all-conference honors each of her four years at Andrews and was a two-time conference player of the year. An All-State player as senior, she was named the Guilford County Player of the Year in 1998 and earned MVP honors at the North Carolina East-West All-Star Game. Harris finished her high school career with 1,746 points. But her well-rounded game consisted of more than scoring, as Harris twice handed out a Joel Coliseum-record 10 assists while at Wake Forest and ranked 10th on the Demon Deacons’ all-time assist list upon graduation. Harris served as head coach at Tusculum from 2009-12, where she compiled a 61-30 record over three seasons and led her team to the NCAA Division II tournament each year.

She graduated from High Point Central in 1955, at a time when women’s sports were not a universal part of every curriculum, but she was able to participate in volleyball, basketball, softball and track and field. She played basketball for four years at High Point College before beginning a remarkable coaching career at her high school alma mater that spanned more than three decades. Between 1960 and 1982, Hester guided her basketball teams to a cumulative 250-79 record. Her volleyball teams stood 96-62 over 14 seasons, and her softball teams were 149-64 over 13 years (according to limited records that were kept at the time). When girls’ sports became organized during the 1970s, Hester’s basketball teams won multiple conference championships and three regional titles. Hester also made huge contributions behind the scenes when she guided High Point Central through its compliance with Title IX, providing input and writing many policies, procedures and regulations. She created a Women’s Sports Day in High Point that was replicated by many other schools and communities. Inducted into High Point Central’s inaugural sports hall of fame class of 2013, Hester now devotes much of her time to volunteering with Mobile Meals, Open Door Ministries and the Red Cross.\n\nDr. William E. Moran\n\nIn 1979, UNC Greensboro faced an uncertain future in athletics. Then Dr. William E. (Bill) Moran accepted an appointment as the chancellor and the uncertainty became a vision. Under his guidance, a strong Division III program was put into place as an athletics foundation, leading to national championships in men's soccer and an excellent women's basketball program. When Nelson Bobb was hired as athletics director, Moran convinced him that the school should pursue Division I status. Distinguished coaches were hired, including Mike Berticelli and Michael Parker in men's soccer and Lynne Agee in women's basketball. The Spartans completed the transition to Division I in 1991 and athletics have flourished ever since, including hosting the NCAA Division I women's soccer championships in 1997 and 1998. Moran was born in White Plains, NY, of Irish immigrants. He earned degrees from Princeton, Harvard and Michigan, served on a destroyer in the Navy and had a long career in academics before serving UNCG from 1979-94.\n\nShannon Pope\n\nAt High Point Andrews, the name Shannon Pope became synonymous with state championship.

Individually, he won the pole vault, both indoors and outdoors, in 1991 and 1992. In the 1992 outdoor State Meet, Pope set a then-state record vault of 15 feet, 3 inches and was a member of the Andrews teams that won the 4x100 meter and 4x400 meter relays.

He never met a challenge he couldn't conquer, competing in marathons, cycling, softball and basketball as a Special Olympics athlete. He served on its Board of Directors on the state and national levels. He traveled the world as a Special Olympics ambassador and speaker, including Greece, China and the Netherlands.

He went on to play at Brevard, was an graduate assistant at Appalachian and UNCG, and became head coach at Wesleyan Christian Academy in High Point in 1983.

He won many conference and regional coaching awards and was named National Coach of the Year for private and parochial schools in 1994.

His work has led to travels to 20 countries helping to train coaches to instruct and assist at-risk youth through soccer.\n\nJohn Wesley Wright Sr. (Legends Class)\n\nJohn Wesley Wright Sr. was one of those drawn to coaching young people. He graduated from Dudley High School and later served in World War II, winning numerous medals. Beginning in 1965, he began a 30-year association coaching the Bluford Blues youth baseball program.

Alston was also an outstanding player with the Goshen Red Wings, an all-Black semi-pro team in the Greensboro area, playing while a high school and college student against barnstorming Negro League teams. After graduation from A&T, he signed a professional contract in 1952 to play for San Diego in the Pacific Coast League. In 1953 he hit .298 with 20 home runs. That caught the eye of the Cardinals, who bought his contract for $100,000 and four players and promoted him to the major leagues. During his rookie year he played in 66 games, hitting .246 with 4 homers and 34 RBIs. The following three years saw his playing time reduced as he struggled with undiagnosed mental illness. He was described by one sportswriter as “having a sweet swing and a troubled soul.” After the 1957 season, Alston was released by the Cardinals and he returned to Greensboro, where he lived for many years in mental institutions.

He was 82.\n\nSteele played basketball at Wake Forest from 1958-1961 where he was a captain and twice a member of the ACC All-Academic team. Steele was the head coach at Guilford College from 1964-1971, he then coached the ABA's Carolina Cougars for a season in 1970-1971. In 1972, he became the head coach at High Point where he stayed until retiring in 2003.\n\nHe was the school's athletic director from 1972-1998. Steele guided the school to six conference tournament titles in NAIA and NCAA Division II. He was a basketball icon which is a status that was solidified with inductions to five halls of fame: NAIA Hall of Fame, North Carolina Hall of Fame, Guilford County Sports Hall of Fame, Wake Forest Sports Hall of Fame, and was in the inaugural class of the High Point University Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\"Jerry Steele represented the best of HPU,\" High Point University President Nido Qubein said. \"I've known him for three decades and always admired his spirited commitment to the university. We will certainly miss him. His legacy lives on.\"\n\nSteele took HPU through every level of college athletics (NAIA- Division I) while experiencing success in each division. Steele spent 31 years as the head coach of the Panthers, 16 of which were winning seasons.\n\n\"Jerry Steele was an icon of High Point University Athletics and his impact on HPU will live on forever,\" Athletic Director Dan Hauser said. \"Jerry was both a Hall of Fame basketball coach and a championship administrator. His induction into five Halls of Fame is an indication of the admiration and respect so many people had for his legacy of work. Jerry was a mentor, educator, and coach to hundreds of HPU alumni over his career. His influence and life lessons will carry on for generations to come. Our thoughts and prayers are with Kitty and the entire Steele family.\"\n\nSteele was a five-time NAIA conference tournament champion with The Purple & White.\n\nHPU only spent six years in Division II, but that did not slow down Steele who led High Point to four CVAC Tournament Championship games. Steele and The Panthers won the CVAC Championship in 1996-97. Steele led the Panthers to two consecutive DII Second Round appearances in 1995-96 and 1996-97.\n\n\"Coach Steele has been a pillar in this community and in this state, Coach Tubby Smith said of his former coach. \"He is a Hall of Famer in every sense of the term. What I loved about playing for Coach Steele is that he was a man of principles. He was fair, he always kept things light he always someone I could count on and call on when I made a decision. He is one of those men once you knew him whether you played for him or knew him at all, he left an impression on you. He had great wit and wisdom. He was like a John Wooden he had many ways to motivate players that made it fun. I never worked for him but I know guys who were assistants for him really appreciated what he stood for and honest and sincere he was. I was always impressed with how he stood the test of time, when you spend as much time as he did in this business he did a remarkable job, his legacy will last forever. I believe his wife Kitty was a big key to his success and his longevity in this profession and in life and he would say that as well. He is someone that the coaching profession and High Point University can be very proud of.\n\nHe is certainly going to be missed, he was a real fighter he competed in all areas of life. Donna and I will always love Coach Steele he meant so much to our family.\"\n\nIn 1999, Steele helped High Point University Basketball transition into Division I play in the Big South. After not being eligible for the Big South Tournament in their first two seasons Steele guided the Panthers to the Big South Championship game in 2001-02 in their tournament debut. Their wild run to the Championship game is best encapsulated in this excerpt from the High Point University Athletics recap story of the 2002 Big South Championship game against Winthrop where HPU finished runner-up.\n\n\"High Point's first-ever Big South Tournament appearance was a successful one by any stretch of the imagination. The Panthers knocked off two of the league's three highest-ranked teams, and became the first No. 7-seed in the history of the tournament to advance to the finals.\"\n\nSteele played such a critical role in the development of High Point Athletics and the transition to Division I. His contributions can be best seen through his four Division I seasons with the Panthers. A look back at Coach Steele's non-conference games once the team became Division I showed a clear willingness to learn, and test his teams as they competed against some of the best in the nation. He did not shy away from the game's giants even with his Panthers just two years removed from Division II. The first four Power-5 opponents in the Division I era under Steele were #22 Wake Forest, #8 Florida, Kentucky, and Auburn.\n\nAgainst Auburn on November 16th, 2001 HPU took the tigers the distance as the Panthers nearly shocked AU on their home floor 63-59.\n\nSteele is survived by his wife Kitty Steele who spent many years alongside him at High Point University as a hall of fame coach in her own right.\n\nThe flags at the Steele Athletic Center will be lowered in honor of Jerry's legacy.\n\nJerry Steel's service this Thursday, July 15th (10:00 AM visitation and 11:00 AM service).\n\nAddress: Forbis & Dick Funeral Service (Guilford College location) – 5926 West Friendly Avenue, Greensboro, NC 27410\n\nBy Eddie Wooten: eddie.wooten@greensboro.com\n\nGREENSBORO — Eddie Bridges dedicated his life to the outdoors, wildlife and land conservation. He helped raise millions of dollars for those causes and for his university, Elon.\n\nBut that work was about the people, too.\n\n“It’s about the thousands of people who are members of my foundation and other interested folk who have embraced my cause,” Bridges told the News & Record’s Jeff Mills in 2019. “It’s about the 1 million men, women and children who hunt and fish in North Carolina, people who have generated $2.3 billion a year for our state’s economy. No other sport has done that.”\n\nBridges, a Greensboro resident whose work earned him places in the Guilford County Sports Hall of Fame and the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame, died Tuesday at age 87.\n\nBridges, who grew up near Morganton and is a 1957 graduate of Elon, pitched the idea to the state Wildlife Resources Commission that selling lifetime hunting and fishing licenses would help provide for the enforcement of hunting regulations and for habitat for animals.\n\nIn 1992 he founded the nonprofit North Carolina Wildlife Habitat Foundation, an organization that has helped preserve land, fund studies and even restore an old barn that became the Frank A. Sharpe Jr. Wildlife Education Center at Greensboro’s Bur-Mil Park.\n\nTwo years ago, Bridges estimated that he had raised more than $200 million for endowments for nonprofits, state programs and Elon.\n\n“If I go to a deer stand or a duck blind and stay there all day and don’t shoot my gun, it’s worth it,” Bridges told the News & Record’s Richard M. Barron in 2015. “Nobody sees it but me and the Lord. It’s private.\n\n“I have turkeys walk past me, bobcats, bears. It bothers me that mankind is destroying all that.”\n\nThe honors that came his way included being selected as the state’s conservationist of the year in 1993, the national conservationist of the year in 2004 and the Field & Stream Conservation Hero of the Year in 2012.\n\n“It’s also crucial to keep kids interested,” he told Field & Stream in 2012. “I’ve been hunting and fishing since I was 6 years old, and I’m still kind of addicted to it. ... I just turned 79, I don’t wear glasses and I don’t need a walker or false teeth, so I think it’s done me some good.”\n\nBridges was chosen for the state sports hall in 2019, and the former college football and baseball player who found fame in the outdoors was inducted with a class that included former N.C. A&T football coach Rod Broadway, former ACC commissioner Gene Corrigan, the PGA Tour’s Davis Love and NASCAR’s Dale Earnhardt Jr.\n\nThat’s good company.\n\n“It’s something I never expected to be part of my life’s journey,” he said in 2019. “I’ve gotten a lot of awards from a lot of places over the years, a lot of publicity. But going into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame is about a lot more than Eddie Bridges.”\n\nBridges won admiration from those he touched. Among them:\n\nNASCAR’s Richard Childress, in 2015: “I’ve watched him with what he’s done and use him as a role model for the great outdoors, not only for me but for many, many people.”\n\nThe artist Bob Timberlake, in 2015: “I try to emulate him all the time. I’ve never seen him upset or tired of talking to someone or go hide in a corner. I feed off his energy and excitement. Everybody around him does.”\n\nAnd News & Record editorial page editor Allen Johnson, in a 2018 column about his heroes: “At a very youngish 85, the executive director of the N.C. Wildlife Habitat Foundation will outhustle people half his age. He also is an alchemist of sorts ... every cause he touches seems to turn to gold, including a recent funding drive to build oyster reefs in the polluted New River in Onslow County. I still think his idea to mint commemorative coins to benefit the International Civil Rights Center & Museum was brilliant; too bad it bogged down in red tape and politics.”\n\nHe leaves behind a large legacy, one that will be long-lasting, for sure. His truck is emblazoned with not only Wildlife Habitat Foundation branding but a sign reading, “Don’t Let the Dream Die.” Upon being selected by the News & Record for its inaugural 7 Over Seventy Awards in August 2020, he explained what his life had given him.\n\n“Divine order has taken care of a lot of stuff for me,” he said. “The Lord has blessed me in a multitude of ways. Lots of great things have happened to me, including the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. I feel really honored and grateful, and to be 87 years old and still get those nice blessings is pretty remarkable.”\n\nGREENSBORO – Ten members have been added to the Guilford County Sports Hall of Fame with the Class of 2019 announced Wednesday.\n\nThe new members include a pair of golfers who made their marks locally and nationally, Joe Inman and Robert Linville.\n\nAlso in the laureates class are coaching standouts Mickie Tuttle and Michael Porter, volleyball star Katie Smith Davis, soccer player and coach Ronnie Coveleskie Woodward, former NFL player Mark Dixon and baseball player Billy Sorrell.\n\nTwo other selections are members of the Legends Class, created in 2010 for posthumous induction.
