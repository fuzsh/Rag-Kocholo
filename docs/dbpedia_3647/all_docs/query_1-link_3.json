        "text": "A friend threw a pub quiz-style question at me today: “How many sets of brothers can you name who have both played football in the English First Division (or Premier League)?” It’s a good one, and I have to admit my answer was quite pathetic, drying up at around two or three. Later, I went online to try to find some more, and was amazed to find that there are dozens, possibly hundreds. One list gave over 20 pairs of brothers who both played for England!. There were also good references from the Daily Mirror and The Times.\n\nIf you have any corrections or additions to this list, I’d be delighted to read your comments at the bottom.\n\nSo here we go, not in any particular order, but perhaps starting with the greatest sets of brothers of all, and a few sets of more than two brothers!\n\nBobby and Jack Charlton\n\nNearly 1,600 club appearances between them, and a World Cup Final for good measure.\n\nDenis and Leslie Compton\n\nDenis may have been one of the greatest all-rounders in sporting history, but Leslie made 253 Arsenal appearances to Denis’s 54.\n\nDanny and Jackie Blanchflower\n\nJackie’s career for Manchester United was cut short by injuries from the team’s Munich air crash, while elder brother Danny is widely regarded as Spurs’ greatest ever player.\n\nAllan, Frank, Derek and Wayne Clarke\n\nAllan scored over 100 goals for Leeds, Frank appeared in Division One for Ipswich, Derek made five top-flight appearances for Wolves, and Wayne was in the championship-winning Everton team of 1987. A fifth brother, Kelvin, appeared for Walsall but never played at the top level.\n\nBob, Peter and Dave Latchford\n\nPeter and Dave were both goalkeepers, playing in Division One for WBA and Birmingham City respectively, while middle brother Bob scored over 200 goals in hais career, notably for Birmingham City and Everton.\n\nDanny, Ray and Rod Wallace\n\nActually played in the Southampton team together in 1988.\n\nJacky, William and George Carr\n\nAll played in the same team, Middlesbrough, in 1920.\n\nJohn and Justin Fashanu\n\nJustin was the one remembered for his goal of the season and for being Britain’s first million-pound black footballer, but John got the England caps.\n\nGary and Phil Neville\n\nTheir 800 club appearances and over 140 England caps seem great in this modern age, but I guess they ain’t no Bobby and Jack.\n\nXabi and Mikel Alonso\n\nA pairing who scrape in thanks to Mikel’s 7 appearances for Bolton.\n\nRio and Anton Ferdinand\n\nBoth started at West Ham, but Rio moved on to greater things.\n\nShaun and Bradley Wright-Phillips\n\nHalf-brothers; Bradley managed about 40 appearances for Manchester City in the mid-noughties.\n\nFabio and Rafael Da Silva\n\nOnly 30 appearances for Manchester United so far between them, but time is on their side.\n\nJohn and Charles Sutcliffe\n\nJohn was the goalkeeper for Bolton Wanderers in the 1894 FA Cup Final, and Charles turned out for Sheffield United an incredible 31 years later.\n\nClive and Bradley Allen\n\nBradley played for several seasons in the top flight for QPR, while Clive famously played for almost every club in England. Cousins Paul and Martin also played in Division One, but weren’t brothers.\n\nKolo and Yaya Toure\n\nYaya came to Manchester City to join his brother Kolo in 2010.\n\nLuke and Stefan Moore\n\nBoth played Premier League football for Aston Villa, Stefan only making 22 appearances.\n\nPaul and Ron Futcher\n\nDivision One appearances with Luton and Manchester City in the seventies for the twins.\n\nMark and Brian Stein\n\nNot the only pairing to start out at Luton.\n\nRon and Peter Springett\n\nSuccessive Sheffield Wednesday goalkeepers as one swapped for the other in a transfer deal in 1967.\n\nRay and Dean Wilkins?\n\nI’m not sure whether any of Dean’s appearances for QPR or Brighton were in the First Division.\n\nJimmy and Brian Greenhoff\n\nJimmy made nearly 300 appearances for Manchester United and Leeds United, and Brian made nearly 500 appearances at the top level, with the two playing in the same Manchester United team for three years in the late 70s.\n\nStephen and Gary Caldwell\n\nBoth players began their careers at Newcastle United and have ended up with each other again at Wigan Athletic.\n\nDean and David Holdsworth\n\nThe twins who have managed against each other also played a single game in the same Bolton Wanderers side in 2002, as well as making top-level appearances for other sides."
