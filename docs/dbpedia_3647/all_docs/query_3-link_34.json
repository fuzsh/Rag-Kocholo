George received his degree in 2001 from Maryland — so needless to say — the Terrapins are like his family. Born and raised in Maryland, he’s had a Redskin football in his hand from day one.\n\nWorking for Westwood One/CBS Radio, George covered the Summer Olympics in Athens,Greece and the Winter games in Torino,Italy. He’s also covered the Masters for Westwood One since 2009.\n\nYou can email George at gwallace@wtop.com or follow him on Twitter @gwallaceWTOP."
