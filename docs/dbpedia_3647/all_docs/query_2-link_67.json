        "text": "Though it was inexperienced in a lot of key spots last season, Lycoming’s offense still managed to finish as the Landmark’s third-highest scoring unit. Many Warriors dazzled throughout their first years as starters, showing flashes of potential, improving by the week and contributing heavily to the team’s late success.\n\nFrom a flashy, consistent freshman running back tandem, a deep receiving room consisting of four guys that finished over 250 receiving yards to a quarterback that improved considerably down the stretch, they gave fans a lot to be excited about in regard to their future.\n\nThat future is now upon us, with the start of the 2024-25 season a month away. And with most of last year’s unit returning, expectations are high to say the least.\n\n“We are as skilled at the receiver position as we’ve been since ’18 when we had Nick Costello, Brock Zollicoffer and Mike Mulvihill – that was a really good group for us. We’re better at tailback than we’ve been since at least the Blake Bowman, Craig Needhammer days – which is ten years ago,” said Lycoming football coach Mike Clark during Lycoming’s media presser last Thursday. “It’s exciting, and we’ll have to produce.”\n\nWhen discussing its offense’s strong suits, Clark was quick to namedrop running backs Quasim Benson and Terrence Oliver and wide receiver Dawson Debebe as guys to watch out for, with good reason.\n\n“Our most explosive guys, the guys that are going to scare people, are Dawson, Terrence and Quasim,” said Clark. “Those guys can score touchdowns for us.”\n\nAs freshmen, Benson and Oliver put the Landmark conference on notice from the jump.\n\nThe pair combined for over 1,300 rushing yards and really came alive once conference play began. Oliver led that effort with 757, logging five 100-yard games and doing enough to garner second-team all-Landmark honors. And though Benson wasn’t featured on the All-Landmark team, it’s likely due to them only being able to nominate one player per position, as he surpassed 550 yards despite missing two games with injury.\n\n“Quasim and Terrence are dudes that would undoubtably be second team if you could nominate two and I’m excited to see what they can do,” said Lycoming tight end Brendan Clark on the tandem. “You’ll be hearing their names a lot.”\n\n“Those two kids are just really good. They’re electric,” said coach Clark on Benson and Oliver. “And they’ve both worked very hard this summer, both bigger and stronger. So, we’re excited for those guys.”\n\nAnd after catching just three balls as a freshman, Dawson Debebe emerged as a consistent deep threat to be wary of on the outside.\n\nOn top of leading the team in receiving yards (569) and touchdowns (7), he also caught a touchdown in each of his last four outings and had four performances where he finished with over 70 yards and a touchdown.\n\nHe displayed improvements down the stretch and made a consistent impact despite the depth within the room. And alongside two backs that are also familiar with making big plays, this offense could produce a lot of exciting moments and performances.\n\n“We’re explosive. On offense, our motto is TDC, which means ‘To Da Crib,’ which means every time we touch the ball, we have the mentality that we have a chance to score and want to score,” said Lycoming quarter Will Fish on that aspect of their offense.\n\n“Pretty much everybody has that mentality,” Lycoming quarterback Will Fish said. Our guys want to make plays, guys want to get clips and guys want to win games, so it all works together.”\n\nDebebe headlines a promising room of returners. Apart from Brandon Timothy, Lycoming’s leader in receptions and second leader in yards from last season, their receiving core returns two guys fresh off breakout seasons in Billy Coppock and Ross Eyer.\n\nCoppock finished second on the team in receptions and receiving touchdowns (5) and third on the team in receiving yards, becoming a pillar of consistency for the team as the season progressed. And Eyer kicked off his Lyco career by catching 22 passes for 277 yards, logging a catch in ten straight games and proving to be a reliable target thanks to his hands and 6-foot, 4-inch frame.\n\nWith quarterback Will Fish and tight end Brendan Clark also looking to build off their first seasons as starters, this group heads into the season in a much better spot than last year.\n\nLast year’s offense was more “new look” and had a lot of guys working to find their footing and get used to their roles. This year’s unit has a year of experience to build from, a better idea of what to expect, and added and shared confidence. Its players recognize their roles and more importantly, know what they’re capable of after last season’s conclusion.\n\n“I think the most impressive part and the reason I’m so optimistic is that our best offensive skill players are now two seniors, three juniors and two sophomores, which is way better than two juniors, three sophomores and two freshmen,” said Brendan Clark on that experience. “I’m excited for our offense and my individual goal is 35 points per game as a team. That’s the goal because we’re more than capable of doing it.”"
