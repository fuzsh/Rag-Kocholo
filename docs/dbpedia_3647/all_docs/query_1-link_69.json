He is Samford’s all-time winningest coach, with a record of 57-43 with the Bulldogs. In his time at Samford, his teams have consistently been among the Southern Conference and FCS leaders in several categories.\n\nThe 2023 team produced seven All-SoCon honorees, with Jay Stanton, Jabari Brooks and Noah Martin on the first team,Michael Hiers and Chandler Smith on the second team, and Brendan Jenkins and Makhi Gilbert on the All-Freshman team. Jenkins was also tabbed as the SoCon’s Freshman of the Year.\n\nIn addition to the All-SoCon honors, Martin was namedsecond team All-American by FCS Football Central, and third team by the Associated Press.The 2023 season also saw running back Jay Stantonset the school record for rushing touchdowns, and he led the SoCon in rushing yards.\n\nDuring the 2022 season, Hatcher led the Bulldogs to the program’s best season in over 30 years. Samford posted a final record of 11-2 overall and a perfect 8-0 mark in Southern Conference play, winning the program’s fi rst outright SoCon title. The team also reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA Division I-FCS Playoff s for the first time since 1991. Samford’s 10 regular season wins were tied for the most in program history, and the eight conference wins were the most ever for the program. The 11 total wins were the second most in Samford football history.\n\nFollowing the 2022 season, Hatcher was named the SoCon Coach of the Year, and he also earned Region 2 Coach of the Year honors from the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA). In addition to Hatcher’s awards, quarterback Michael Hiers was named the SoCon Offensive Player of the Year, the fi fth time in Hatcher’s fi rst eight seasons that the Samford quarterback earned the award.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, Hatcher’s offense produced the FCS’ all-purpose yards leader in Montrell Washington (176.18 ypg.). Quarterback Liam Welch also put up impressive numbers, ranking seventh in the nation in passing yards per game (306.0 ypg.).\n\nAs a team last fall, the Bulldogs ranked 10th in the nation in total offense (448.7 ypg.), ninth in passing offense (307.5 ypg.) and sixth in scoring offense (37.9 ppg.).\n\nHatcher led his team in the first-ever spring season in the spring of 2021, after the 2020 fall season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the spring season, the Samford offense led the Southern Conference in scoring offense (40.3 ppg.), total offense (513.9 ypg.), passing offense (353.1 ypg.) and pass efficiency (148.1). On the other side of the ball, the Bulldog defense led the league in opponent third-down conversions (31.0%) and turnovers caused (18).\n\nIndividually, Welch was named the SoCon’s Co-Offenive Player of the Year for the spring season. Welch and safety Chris Edmonds were both named All-Americans following the season.\n\nIn 2019, the Bulldogs led all of FCS football in punt return average (19.41 ypr.), and the team ranked second nationally in fewest penalties per game (3.58). Samford also led the SoCon in first downs (22.6 pg.), and the team ranked second in the league in scoring offense (32.2 ppg.) and passing offense (239.2 ypg.).\n\nHatcher’s 2018 team posted the program’s eighth-straight winning season, the longest streak in program history. Also during the season, quarterback Devlin Hodges became the FCS’ all-time leader in career passing yards. Hodges also earned the highest individual honor at the FCS level, the highest individual honor at the FCS level, winning the Walter Payton Award. Additionally, he was named the Southern Conference’s Offensive Player of the Year for a third-straight season.\n\nAlso in 2018, Hodges set school records for single-season completions (388), attempts (550), passing yards (4,283). Hodges was named the SoCon’s Offensive Player of the Year and a third team All-American at the conclusion of the season.\n\nIn 2017, Hatcher led the team to an 8-4 record and a spot in the NCAA Division I-FCS Playoffs for a second-straight season for the first time since 1992.\n\nAs a unit, the 2016 Samford offense ranked third among all FCS schools in passing offense, averaging 349.4 passing yards per game. The offense also ranked sixth in the nation in red zone offense (90.2%), 11th in team passing efficiency (155.24), 12th in scoring offense (35.1 ppg.) and 14th in total offense (446.2 ypg.).\n\nIn his first season at Samford in 2015, Hatcher put his stamp on the Bulldog program. Samford finished the season third in the nation in passing offense (332.9 ypg.), seventh in the nation in total offense (479.7 ypg.) and seventh in fourth down conversions (66.7%). Hatcher’s special teams also stood out, ranking fifth nationally in kickoff return average (24.34 ypr.).\n\nHatcher led the Bulldogs to a 6-5 record that first season, ending the season with a pair of impressive Southern Conference road wins at Wofford and Mercer. The 2015 team also produced a pair of All-Americans in cornerback James Bradberry and place-kicker Anthony Pistelli.\n\nHatcher came to Samford after serving as the head coach at Murray State University from 2010 to 2014. In five seasons as the head coach of the Racers, Hatcher’s teams employed the high-powered “Hatch Attack” offense to top the Division I-FCS football charts. In 2014, the Racers ranked second in the nation in passing offense, averaging 327.2 yards per game. The team also ranked 15th in total offense at 468.3 yards per contest.\n\nMSU used a balanced attack in 2013. The Racers rushed the ball 424 times, while throwing it 458, in averaging 398.6 yards of offense. The offense was spearheaded by All-America wide receiver Walter Powell, who hauled in 66 passes for 837 yards and 13 touchdowns in just 10 games.\n\nThe 2012 Murray State offense led the Ohio Valley Conference for the third-straight season. MSU averaged a school-record 484.4 yards of offense per game, while also setting a new single-season record by averaging 348.9 yards through the air.\n\nThe 2011 season saw the Racers go 7-4 and post back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since the 1999-2000 seasons. MSU closed the season winning five of its final six games, including going on the road and knocking off nationally-ranked Tennessee Tech.\n\nThe Racer offense was among the most prolific in the nation as MSU ranked third in scoring offense, fourth in total offense and seventh in passing offense. The 5,070 yards of total offense marked just the fifth time in school history MSU amassed over 5,000 yards, while the 460.9 yards per game were the third-most all time. The Racers also rushed for 152.27 yards per game.\n\nThe defense was not to be outdone as the Racers recorded their first shutout in seven years with a 39-0 victory over Mississippi Valley State. It also marked the first shutout on the road since 1986, and the first non-conference road shutout since the 1979 season.\n\nIn 2010, the Racer offense led the OVC in passing offense, total offense and scoring offense, while ranking fourth nationally in passing offense, fifth in total offense and fifth in scoring offense.\n\nHatcher is no stranger to the Southern Conference, as he served as the head coach at Georgia Southern from 2007 to 2009.\n\nIn his first season with the Eagles in 2007, Hatcher led GSU to the second-best regular season turnaround in program history, a plus-4 improvement from 2006. The Eagles ranked among the national leaders in various categories on offense, defense and special teams.\n\nHe also coached five All-America players, including quarterback Jayson Foster, the second Walter Payton Award winner at GSU.\n\nThe Eagles returned to the national rankings after a 14-week hiatus as the Hatcher era got off to a 4-1 start. GSU climbed as high as No. 11, after the Eagles recorded three-straight victories at No. 5 Appalachian State, ending the Mountaineers 30-game home winning streak, at home against No. 25 The Citadel and at No. 10 Wofford.\n\nThe prolific offense ranked first in rushing, eighth in total offense, eighth in scoring offense and 23rd in sacks allowed. The defense was 14th in turnover margin and 17th in fumbles recovered, while the special teams ranked 25th in net punting.\n\nThe 2008 season saw Hatcher guide the Eagles to the program’s 25th winning season in 27 years.\n\nIn late October, the Eagles set an NCAA record for the largest fourth-quarter comeback as GSU erased a 31-3 deficit for a thrilling 38-31 overtime victory at Western Carolina. The OT contest was just the first of an NCAA record four overtime games played by the Eagles in 2008.\n\nHatcher’s team provided impressive numbers in all three phases. The offense ranked 20th nationally in passing and scoring, while the defense ranked 26th in sacks and 22nd in tackles-for-loss. The special teams units finished 14th in punt returns and 36th in kickoff returns.\n\nAll of this was done as Hatcher and his staff were forced to play close to 30 freshmen on a consistent basis throughout the season. In all, five Eagles received All-SoCon honors and seven freshmen representing offense, defense and special teams were named to the inaugural SoCon All-Freshman Team.\n\nPrior to his time at GSU, Hatcher molded Valdosta State into one of the most dominant teams in Division II.\n\nThe winningest coach in Blazers’ history, Hatcher was 76-12 at his alma mater. In his first year back at VSU, Hatcher took a 4-7 squad the previous year and produced a 10-2 overall record (8-1 in GSC action) and a berth in the Division II playoffs. He coached quarterback Dusty Bonner, who was a two-time winner of the Harlon Hill Trophy as the NCAA Division II Player of the Year, an award Hatcher won himself in 1994.\n\nHis 2001 and 2002 teams posted back-to-back undefeated records during the regular season, part of a Gulf South Conference record 35 straight victories during the regular season.\n\nDuring the 2004 championship season, the Blazers lost their season-opener before rattling off 13 consecutive victories, capped by a 36-31 victory over Pittsburg State in the title game. Hatcher was named National Coach of the Year by the American Football Coaches Association and was the offensive coordinator for the East squad at the Hula Bowl.\n\nIn 2005, Valdosta opened the season ranked No. 1 for four-straight weeks and saw the season culminate with a sixth-straight NCAA postseason appearance. Despite an 8-2 record in 2006, the 10th-ranked Blazers did not receive an invitation to the playoffs, marking the first time that occurred in the Hatcher era.\n\nThe 2006 team finished sixth nationally in passing offense (283 yards per game), 12th in scoring offense (34.9 ppg.) and 19th in total offense (389.9 ypg.). In addition to the offensive success, the 2006 defense ranked 27th nationally in scoring defense (15.7 ppg.) while the special teams ranked third in punt returns (17.3 ypr.) and blocked seven kicks.\n\nThe Macon, Ga., native spent one year as quarterbacks/tight ends coach at the University of Central Florida where he worked with future NFL quarterback Daunte Culpepper. He then spent three years working with the quarterbacks at the University of Kentucky where he worked under former VSU head coach Hal Mumme. During his time with the Wildcats, he coached the No. 1 NFL draft pick, All-America quarterback Tim Couch.\n\nWhile at UK, Hatcher and the Wildcats played in the 1999 Outback Bowl, the program’s first New Year’s Day Bowl in 47 years, then followed that the following year with a berth in the ’99 Music City Bowl. It marked the first time the Wildcats had consecutive bowl appearances in 15 years.\n\nHatcher carried his success on the playing field to help him develop into one of the nation’s winningest coaches. A two-time All-American quarterback at VSU (1993 and 1994), Hatcher threw for 11,363 yards and 121 touchdowns during his stellar career. During his senior year in 1994, he led the Blazers to their first postseason berth, advancing to the quarterfinals, and when it was all said and done set 29 VSU passing and total offense records.\n\nAmong the national records he once set were a 68.5 career completion percentage and a streak of 20-straight completions in a game against New Haven. Hatcher held 14 Valdosta State, 13 Gulf South Conference and 17 Division II national records. He also started 41 consecutive games, posting a 29-10-2 record.\n\nNot only did Hatcher excel on the field, he was just as successful in the classroom. Twice he received the Gulf South Conference’s Commissioner’s Trophy which is awarded to the league’s Most Outstanding Student-Athlete. He finished his senior year by winning several national honors including: the NCAA Top Eight Award, the CoSIDA Academic All-America National Player of the Year and a postgraduate scholarship from the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAt the time when Hatcher won the Harlon Hill Trophy, he won by the second-largest voting margin in the then-19-year history of the award. Hatcher was also voted to the GSC Football team of the 1990s.\n\nThe honors continued to add up even after his playing days. Hatcher was named to the Valdosta State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001, in his first year of eligibility. He was also elected into the Macon Sports Hall of Fame the same year.\n\nIn 2005, Hatcher was inducted into the Division II Hall of Fame. Hatcher was also inducted into the inaugural class of the GSC Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nHatcher graduated from Valdosta State in 1995 with a bachelor’s degree in health and physical education.\n\nHe and his wife, Lori, also a graduate of VSU, are the parents of a son, Ty, and daughter, Talley. Ty was a quarterback on the Samford football team the last four seasons.\n\nTHE HATCHER FILE\n\nPERSONAL\n\nBirthdate: Feb. 18, 1973\n\nHometown: Macon, Ga.\n\nFamily: wife, Lori; son, Ty; daughter, Talley\n\nEDUCATION\n\nHigh School: Mount de Sales Academy\n\nCollege: Valdosta State (1995)\n\nDegree: B.S./Health and Physical Education\n\nPLAYING EXPERIENCE\n\n1991-94: Valdosta State\n\nCOACHING EXPERIENCE\n\n2010-14: Murray State, Head Coach\n\n2007-09: Georgia Southern, Head Coach\n\n2000-06: Valdosta State, Head Coach\n\n1999: Kentucky, Assistant Coach\n\nQuarterbacks/Wide Receivers\n\n1997-98: Kentucky, Graduate Assistant\n\nQuarterbacks\n\n1996: Central Florida, Assistant Coach\n\nQuarterbacks/Tight Ends\n\n1995: Valdosta State, Student Assistant\n\nQuarterbacks\n\nAWARDS/ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nInducted into the Division II Hall of Fame in 2005\n\nInducted into the Gulf South Conference Hall of Fame in 2014\n\nMember of the Valdosta State Hall of Fame\n\n2004 American Football Coaches Association National Coach of the Year\n\nLed Valdosta State to the 2004 Division II National Championship\n\nFour-time Atlanta Touchdown Club Coach of the Year\n\n1994 CoSIDA Academic All-America of the Year\n\nLed teams to six playoff appearances, including two appearances in the National Championship game\n\nServed as the offensive coordinator for the East\n\nsquad in the 2004 Hula Bowl\n\n1994 recipient of the Harlon Hill Trophy (Division II Heisman)\n\nTwo-time All-American quarterback at Valdosta State (1993-94)\n\nSet 29 passing records as the quarterback at Valdosta State"
