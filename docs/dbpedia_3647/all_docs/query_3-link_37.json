        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers return home for Games 3 and 4 of their Round 1 series with the New York Knicks trailing 2-0. The Sixers had a tough loss in Game 1 before suffering a heartbreaker in Game 2 where things didn’t go their way down the stretch.\n\nThrough the first two games, Tyrese Maxey and Joel Embiid are doing their jobs to lead the way. However, the supporting cast has not been great.\n\nTobias Harris drew the ire of NBA champion, and Philadelphia native, Rashed Wallace. Through two games, Harris is averaging 8.5 points and 9.5 rebounds while shooting 38.9% from the floor and 33.3% from deep. He had 10 points on 4-for-11 shooting in Game 2 and didn’t score in the second half.\n\nThat didn’t sit well with Wallace:\n\nPlease be advised that the clip below contains language that some might consider offensive.\n\nHarris has not had the greatest shooting performance just yet in this series, but his defense against Knicks star Jalen Brunson has been phenomenal. That has been his big contribution to the Sixers thus far in this series."
