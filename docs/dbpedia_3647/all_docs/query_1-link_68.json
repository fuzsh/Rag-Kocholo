        "text": "James “Jim” Horace Geer, 84 years old, passed away peacefully on Wednesday May 22, 2024, at home in Parkland, Florida where he lived with the love of his life and wife of 62 years, Kathleen “Kathy” (Huffman) Geer.\n\nJim was born in Sparta, Tennessee on August 20, 1939, and was raised there in a loving home with his parents and beloved dog Buddy, graduating from White County High School on April 26, 1957. Jim was always very proud of an early job he had in Sparta running a Tastee-Freeze together with a close friend.\n\nHe attended Tennessee Technological University (formerly Tennessee Polytechnic Institute) in Cookeville, Tennessee, graduating in June of 1961 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration with a major in Finance. He was very involved in class government and was student body president at the time of his graduation. It was during his time at Tennessee Tech that he met Kathy whom he later married on May 26, 1962.\n\nJim received his commission in November 1961 in the U.S. Army through Tennessee Tech’s ROTC program and, following graduation, served as a 2nd Lieutenant.\n\nHe worked for a short time at the Commerce Union Bank in Nashville, Tennessee until the Army assigned him to Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, North Carolina. During his time at Fort Bragg, he met several FBI agents who suggested he consider a career with the FBI, which he ultimately did, and it was there he found his passion.\n\nJim joined the FBI in May 1964 and attended several months of training in Quantico, Virginia after which he was given his first assignment as a Special Agent in Springfield, Illinois. He was transferred to the San Francisco division in 1965 to attend the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California where he learned Serbo-Croation which he continued to be able to speak all his life. Upon completion of his language training, he was transferred to the Washington, DC Field Office in July 1966. In Washington he held various roles including in 1972 when he was placed on “loan” to the House Appropriations Committee and spent approximately 2 years reviewing various military appropriations. In February of 1978 he was transferred to the Dallas, Texas office as Assistant Agent in Charge until September 1979 when he was transferred back to Washington as a Section Chief in the Intelligence Division.\n\nIn 1982 Jim was appointed Assistant Director of the FBI’s Laboratory Division and served in that role until August 1985 when he took the position of Assistant Director of Foreign Counterintelligence. In this role Jim was responsible for the executive management of all FBI counterintelligence programs and operations and in charge of the FBI’s efforts to “identify and neutralize the threat posed by foreign intelligence services and their agents in the United States and by nations, groups and individuals which constitute the sources of international terrorism.” He served in this position until his retirement from the FBI on November 30, 1989.\n\nJim joined the DuPont Company in December 1989 as Director of Corporate Security for the company’s worldwide operations and held that position until his retirement on December 31, 2000. He was responsible for the security of DuPont’s physical locations around the world and for security issues relating to the nearly 100,000 DuPont employees around the world at that time.\n\nOn May 5, 1986, the mayor of his hometown of Sparta, Tennessee proclaimed Jim “A Most Illustrious Citizen of Sparta Tennessee” and “Jimmy Geer Day” was celebrated at his alma mater, White County High School, during which time Jim spoke and answered questions from the students.\n\nHe also received in 1986 the Louis Johnson Outstanding Alumni Award from the College of Business Administration Foundation at Tennessee Tech which honors special achievements an alumnus has accomplished in his/her profession or for participation in civic, cultural, educational, political, or other activities worthwhile to society.\n\nFor his service in the FBI Jim received both the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal on December 4, 1990, and the Distinguished Service Award of the FBI Executive Service. The CIA director noted as part of the award presentation that Jim’s career with the FBI would have “overreaching importance to U.S. national security for years to come.”\n\nJim was a loving husband, devoted father, and proud grandfather and great grandfather. He was known by all for his southern charm, sense of humor, and kindness. He was a highly respected leader in the international intelligence community and a mentor to many.\n\nJim is survived by his wife Kathleen Geer, three children: James H. Geer Jr., Kelly M. Geer, and Jeffrey Geer; three children-in-law: Sheri Geer, Michael Horton, and Renee Maurer; six grandchildren: Matthew Geer, Kelsey Daiber, Joshua Geer; Danielle California, Alex Horton-Geer; and Samuel Geer; one granddaughter-in-law: Fabiola Geer; and two great grandchildren: Ezra Daiber and Grace Geer.\n\nJim was preceded in death by his parents Mr. Horace Greeley Geer and Mrs. Velma Clyde (Bain) Geer and grandson-in-law Alexander Daiber.\n\nHe will be greatly missed by his family, friends, and all those that had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nA service will be held on June 8, 2024, at 10 am at North Creek Presbyterian Church, 4601 NW 71st St, Coconut Creek, FL 33073.\n\nMemorial gifts may be directed to Former Agents of the FBI Foundarion or Tennessee Tech:\n\nMake a gift to tennessee tech\n\nEmail from Tennessee Tech President Phil Oldham to Faculty and Staff:\n\nIt is with a heavy heart I share the news of the passing of our colleague, friend, and alumna Michelle Huddleston, associate director of residential life and service learning at Tech.\n\nMichelle's connection to our campus spans 20 years, dating back to when she first arrived as a college freshman in 2003. As a student, Michelle immersed herself in all that Tech had to offer. She took part in National Honor Society, volunteered at Window on the World and was vice president of the Criminal Justice and Sociology Club. For her accomplishments, character and tireless service to others, Michelle earned the Tennessee Higher Education Commission's Herold Love Outstanding Community Service Award as well as Tech's Mookherjee Sociology Senior Award Endowment, among others. Fortunately, that would not be the end of Michelle's contributions to our community. Michelle worked at Tech in various capacities since 2010, including as coordinator for the service learning center and later as assistant director of service learning and community engagement, culminating in her most recent position with residential life and service learning.\n\nA hallmark of Michelle's service to Tech will always be her leadership overseeing the university food pantry, including during the aftermath of the March 2020 tornadoes and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen Tech students began needing to isolate due to positive COVID-19 diagnoses, Michelle teamed up with Residential Life, Health Services and Chartwells to make sure no one on our campus went without meals while in quarantine. She helped build a system to ensure students had meals and snacks for their dorm rooms or off-campus apartments, calling the program \"Meals on Wings.\"\n\nLater, Michelle went on to help facilitate the placement of \"Butterfly Blessing Boxes\" in the community, which allows passers-by to take items they need for themselves or pay it forward by leaving canned goods or other pantry items behind. Fittingly, Michelle was a 2021 recipient of Tech's Wings of Kindness award and was presented with an honorary key to the city by former Cookeville Mayor Ricky Shelton.\n\nFuneral services for Michelle will be at 11 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 26 at the Cookeville Chapel of Hooper Huddleston and Horner Funeral Home. The family will receive friends this Tuesday (tomorrow) from 4 to 8 p.m., Wednesday from 3 to 8 p.m., and Thursday from 10 a.m. until the service time. Additional details can be found here.\n\nThose wishing to make a contribution to Tech's food pantry in Michelle's memory can do so at this link. Please select \"food pantry\" as the gift designation and follow the prompt for giving in someone's memory.\n\nPlease join me in keeping Michelle's husband, Ray, who works here at Tech in our facilities department, as well as their children and all who loved and knew Michelle close in our hearts during this difficult time.\n\nBy Laura Clemons\n\nMichael E. “Birdie” Birdwell wasn’t done yet.\n\nWhen he passed away Sunday night, March 20, Tennessee Tech and Cookeville lost their best storyteller and historian -- a man with a questing mind and catholic tastes, a man who could bring history to people and leave them wanting more. You have to work hard, he would say, to make history boring.\n\nBorn March 8, 1957, Birdie grew up working on farms. His first passion was art, followed by reading; his father told Birdie and his sisters that if they had time to watch TV, they had time to read a book. Their father, Birdie said, brought them up to be hard workers and to make a mark.\n\nHis Tech lineage dates back to 1915, when his great-grandfather, master mason for Scott and Smoot bricklayers, helped construct the first buildings on campus. He earned two degrees at Tennessee Tech and went on to finish a Ph.D. at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville in 1996, coming home to Cookeville as an adjunct faculty member at Tech before accepting a tenure-track position in 2000.\n\nBirdie's breadth of knowledge was astonishing, he had enough energy for 10, he loved collecting stories and was as happy to hear them as to tell them. He could be impatient, abrupt, outspoken. Ask him a question, and you had to be prepared to sit awhile. Ask for information about any particular topic, and he would hand you a stack of paper. He was irreverent, witty. His lectures and presentations were animated and unabashedly opinionated.\n\nPeople outside of Tech and Cookeville began paying closer attention as he began publishing his research on WWI hero Sgt. Alvin C. York of nearby Fentress County. He curated the York papers, serving as archivist since 1997. That work opened the door to research on another American icon, Harry Warner of Warner Bros. Studio, which produced the 1941 Gary Cooper biopic Sgt. York. Its archives held invaluable information about his principal topic, York, and led to his first published book, Celluloid Soldiers: Warner Bros. Campaign Against Nazism in 1999, with a German edition released the next year.\n\nAlongside History Prof. Calvin Dickinson and English Prof. Homer Kemp, Birdie co-edited the 2002 Hillsboro Press book Historic Architecture of the Upper Cumberland. With Dickinson, he edited and contributed to Rural Life and Culture, published by the University of Kentucky Press in 2004, as well as People of the Upper Cumberland, a 2015 University of Tennessee Press release which won the Tennessee Library Association's Best History Book of the Year award.\n\nAs a cultural historian, Birdie emphasized the importance of public history. He co-directed a $941,000 project for high school history teachers. He worked on nearly 30 documentaries and historical series, including Everybody's Welcome: John's Place with WCTE-TV. In 2016, he won Tech's highest academic honor, the Caplenor Award.\n\nHe presented at 100 conferences, wrote more than 30 articles and chapters -- all told, in his 26 years as a member of the Tennessee Tech faculty, he produced well over 250 scholarly and popular works. Between 2016 and 2019, he chaired the Tennessee State Review Board for the National Register of Historic Places, the Tennessee Preservation Trust, and the Tennessee Great War Commission. At the time of his death, he had five books in the works.\n\nThe man just did not know how to sit still.\n\nNext to history and literature, Birdie's greatest passion was the stage. He took part in productions at Tennessee Tech's Backdoor Playhouse beginning in the 1970s. He was interim director of the Tech Players during the 1986-87 season; over the years, he directed 20 productions there and at the Cookeville Performing Arts Center.\n\nBut of all his work, nothing stirred him like injustice. Birdie was in first grade when Darwin School, the only local school for African American students, burned. As part of the first integrated class in Cookeville, he was furious and horrified by incidents of overt prejudice. When the owner of Cookeville's treasured African American tavern, Mary Alice McClellan, asked him to write a National Register nomination for her establishment, he said yes, focusing on the tavern's role in race relations, and the two received a standing ovation from the review board when it approved the nomination in 2011. He said the greatest honor of his life was participating in a symposium on film and media at Yad Vashem, the International Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem; he was the only American presenter.\n\nFor the past 16 years, cancer was his foe, and he approached that very intimate cause with as much determination as he had shown his scholarly achievements and cultural accomplishments. His drive and ambitions were relentless ... he just couldn't realize them all in the scant 65 years he had. He was never completely satisfied, never convinced he lived up to his father's dictum to make a mark.\n\nThere will never be another Birdie, but thanks to Birdie, there are thousands of students across the globe who are inspired by him and aspire to goals as worthy. He once described Sgt. York \"as a fascinating, complex character who didn't think what he did was extraordinary.\" He could have been describing himself.\n\nSheila Ann Sullivan Green, age 72, passed away Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022, at her home in Knoxville. Prior to coming to TTU, she taught at the Baptist Hospital School of Nursing, Memphis, TN and received two Master’s degrees prior to completing her PhD in Nursing at the University of Tennessee, Health Sciences Center, Memphis, TN.\n\nDr. Sheila Green taught in the TTU School of Nursing from 1996 to 2004 and served as both the Director (2004-2005) and Dean (2005-2010). After choosing to step down in 2010, she taught until her retirement in 2011 but continued to teach for several years in the TN eCampus MSN program. During her career as a faculty member and administrator, Dr. Green led the School through multiple accreditations and, as a member of the Nursing Curriculum Committee of the six TBR universities, collaborated with other state leaders to develop the TN eCampus (formerly RODP) Master of Science in Nursing consortium (2003-2004). A conscientious and detailed-oriented administrator, she visited numerous colleges of nursing and researched the latest structure needs for a new building layout—eventually leading to what is now Bell Hall. Once it was finished, she played a key role in the transition into the new building. Notably, at its completion, enrollment doubled as the school transitioned from annual upper division admissions to admission twice per year.\n\nIn 1996, with the exception of the Dean at the time, Dr. Green was the only faculty member in the School with a doctorate. She initiated and led the School on its journey to “grow your own” doctoral-prepared faculty. She encouraged, mentored, and supported faculty in their pursuit of a doctoral education. In addition, her clinical expertise in mental health was an asset to the community as she was one of the first Clinical Nurse Specialists in Adult Psychiatric and Mental Health to have a private practice in Cookeville.\n\nAs Dean/Director, she maintained high standards for the school. For example, she kept abreast of current best practices in nursing and led the faculty in endorsing an NCLEX benchmark of 95 percent. The school has maintained that standard to this date, posting an NCLEX average above 95 percent since 2008.\n\nAfter retirement, Dr. Green continued to serve as an adjunct in the MSN program until 2019 when her health became compromised. She taught almost every semester including summers in the Scholarly Synthesis Course in which students complete a scholarly state of the science paper (course is in lieu of a thesis).\n\nAs evidenced by faculty quality, alumni excellence, and high caliber of the student body, Dr. Green made a significant impact on the School as both a faculty member and leader.\n\nShe is survived by her mother, Frances (Darrell) Penick; daughters, DeeAnn Green (Eric) Climer and Sarah Green (Lendale) Smith; five grandchildren, Grace Haynes, Lucas Haynes, Mathew Climer, Logan Climer and Andrew Climer. She was preceded in death by her father, T.L. Sullivan; husbands, Arthur Donald Green and Robert Francia; and a brother, Keith Sullivan.\n\nA private Celebration of Life is planned to be at a future date.\n\nThe Sheila Green Professor Emeritus of Nursing Scholarship has been established to honor her memory. Gifts may be made by mailing a check to University Advancement, Tennessee Tech University, Campus Box 1915, Cookeville, TN 38505. Gifts may be online at www.tntech.edu/giving. Please indicate that this is for the Shelia Green Nursing Scholarship fund.\n\nEternally youthful in attitude, infinitely curious about many things, and gracious to a fault, Dr. William Calvin Dickinson died peacefully at his home on Aug. 30, almost four months to the day after his wife Charlene shuffled off this mortal coil. The two of them lived life to the fullest; they loved to travel and to entertain.\n\nBorn on March 30, 1938, and raised in Atlanta, Texas, Calvin graduated with his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Baylor and completed his doctorate at UNC Chapel Hill. He began his academic career as a scholar of English History and published his first book (based on his dissertation) on the career of Sidney Godolphin, the first Lord of the Treasury — and arguably the first Prime Minister of England — in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. He initially taught at Chowan College before moving to Cookeville in 1973.\n\nAt Tech Calvin earned a reputation as a beloved lecturer, gifted scholar and mentor to his students. He earned the Outstanding Teaching Award among many other honors. Researching English history at Tech proved more difficult as the years passed and Calvin turned his attention to local history. Together with Homer Kemp of the English Department, they created the Upper Cumberland Institute to conduct research into the history and culture of the plateau region of Kentucky and Tennessee. The Institute provided resources for continued research and offered students the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, including architectural surveys of the region, interpretive material for state parks and local museums, and much more. Dickinson and Kemp worked together to add materials to enrich the TTU Archives. They produced a book based on the architectural surveys for the Tennessee Historical Commission entitled \"Upper Cumberland Historic Architecture.\"\n\nAs a scholar, Calvin published dozens of articles and books. In addition to his biography of Godolphin, Calvin wrote the history of Cumberland and Morgan counties in Tennessee. He and Dr. Larry Whiteaker published two anthologies devoted to Tennessee history, a volume on the Upper Cumberland entitled \"Lend an Ear: Heritage of the Tennessee Upper Cumberland\" and a book about the Civil War correspondence of Cornelius Tenure. Dickinson, Whiteaker and Dr. Kent Dollar published two books dedicated to the Civil War in Kentucky and Tennessee. With Eloise Hitchcock, Calvin published two book-length bibliographies; one devoted to the history of Tennessee and the other concerning the War of Spanish Succession. He worked with Jennie Ivey on two volumes of Tennessee history targeted at high school students and developed pedagogical tools to accompany them. Dickinson and Dr. Michael Birdwell edited two anthologies about the Upper Cumberland region (and had plans to write two more books on the region before his unexpected passing). Both of those books included scholarship by former students.\n\nOne of Calvin’s last books was an investigation of the Walton Road, one of the oldest east-west thoroughfares in Tennessee. His interest in public history led Gov. Phil Bredesen to appoint Calvin to the Tennessee Historical Commission where he lent his expertise to statewide historic appreciation and preservation.\n\nDr. Dickinson was dedicated to the Cookeville community and supported local arts, the Bryan Symphony Orchestra, WCTE-TV, and was a founding member of the Friends of White Plains. He believed in community service and was an exemplar Rotarian, past president of that organization and a multiple Paul Harris Fellow. A faithful member of the Cookeville United Methodist Church, he enjoyed singing in the choir.\n\nCalvin had a tremendous sense of humor and an infectious hearty laugh. He liked trekking through the Upper Cumberland “in search of history.” On numerous occasions he remarked, “Hey fellas, I wonder where this road goes.” More than once the roads were dead ends, but that did not matter. It was the company of friends and sense of adventure that amused him. Travel on my friend.\n\nby Michael Birdwell\n\nOriginally published in the Herald-Citizen\n\nread full obituary\n\nLifting up generations: The legacy of Dr. Leo McGee\n\nBy Laura Clemons\n\nOriginally published in the Herald-Citizen on April 2, 2021\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that well before he retired from Tennessee Tech in 2007, Dr. Leo McGee had become the most distinguished and beloved administrator on campus. His wit was legendary. His grace and diplomacy taught by example; there are countless students, faculty and staff who are the beneficiaries of his mentoring.\n\nDr. McGee would tell you that he, too, was the beneficiary of mentors who taught him how to excel in an academic setting throughout his 30 years at the university. But he would never have made it that far if not for his family, who taught him how to navigate an environment rarely favorable to African Americans.\n\nThe son of Robert and Willie B. McGee, Leo was one of 10 children in a household reliant on low-income jobs in Crossett, a small rural town in Arkansas. Alongside his mother, he worked in the homes and yards of white people throughout his childhood. For a time, he worked in the cotton fields as well to make enough money to buy school clothes; he has said that his greatest ambition then was to out-chop even the most experienced men and women.\n\nAs a child and as a young man, Leo was the target of racism, facing the indignities of both personal prejudices and Jim Crow, the institutionalized form of racism prevalent in the South. He marched for racial equality in downtown Little Rock in 1962, joining thousands of other young people across the country demanding social and economic justice. There were times he feared for his life.\n\nBut what hurt more deeply than incidents aimed at him personally were the times, as a child, that he witnessed injustices suffered by his grandfather, Dan Lowe, the son of enslaved workers on an Arkansas plantation. Dan Lowe managed to survive by his wits, because he'd learned to gauge situations accurately, how to \"read the tea leaves,\" as his grandson would say, when facing potential danger and escape, if not unscathed, then at least with his life.\n\nLeo McGee often said that his success was due almost entirely to that lesson.\n\nIn 1959, McGee enrolled at Philander Smith College in Little Rock, where he met the love of his life, Gloria, now also a retired Tennessee Tech faculty member. They moved north after graduation to Chicago, and from there, east for graduate studies at Ohio State, where Leo earned master's and doctoral degrees. He met a young administrator there, Arliss Roaden, who would influence the McGees' lives in ways they could only imagine. When Dr. Roaden left Ohio State for the presidency at Tennessee Tech, he kept after McGee to join him in Cookeville, and McGee -- now Dr. McGee -- finally said yes, heading back south, first to Tennessee State University from 1973 to 1977, then to Tennessee Tech.\n\nDr. McGee joined the Tennessee Tech faculty as assistant dean of extended services and associate professor of education. In 1986, he was promoted to assistant vice president for academic affairs, and then associate vice president, serving two years as interim vice president -- the rank second only to the president. Of all his professional achievements, he valued most the respect he felt from the faculty. Year after year, as faculty evaluated administrators, Dr. McGee's scores stayed at or near the top.\n\nNo one worked harder or put in longer hours. He understood the absolute necessity of trying harder than the next guy if he wanted to excel.\n\n\"Most people can’t imagine what kind of mental gymnastics one has to go through in order to succeed in a situation where you’re very much the minority,\" he said. \"How do you continue to grow professionally in an environment like that and coming from a meager background as we did? We simply never, never ever thought of giving up. I just never gave up. A person who didn’t have a newspaper or book in his home. Father couldn’t read. That I would be associate vice president emeritus and associate professor of education, published author ... who would have thunk it.\"\n\nHe also understood that regardless of professional satisfaction, nothing will hold you up and give you a stronger foundation than family. He said that the single most important achievement of his life was being able to maintain a strong sense of family in a challenging environment.\n\n\"I had to understand what it took to make me happy,\" he said. \"It’s not the money, it’s about how successful I can be in the job and whether or not my family is going to be okay.\"\n\nDr. McGee appreciated the value of asking for and offering help. Over the years, he helped steer the careers of his beloved daughters, Jennifer and Cassandra, and countless others in big ways and small -- knowing that while it's not possible to be sure of the impact, it's always worth the effort. In the past 10 years, he stayed in touch with a small group of young faculty and staff on campus in whom he saw potential. If he was ever boastful, it was about the men and women who \"made good,\" who he was able to help professionally and personally -- knowing that because he had overcome, others could as well, with the right kind of support.\n\n\"The key to success,\" he said, \"is getting as many mentors as you can, and that comes from being able to get along with people, from being collegial. Those who think they can do it by themselves are probably not going to survive very long. You've got to have help from other people. I learned that from my grandfather teaching me how to negotiate situations during Jim Crow, that you can't stand alone.\"\n\nDuring his career, Dr. McGee published five scholarly books and, the closer he got to retirement, began to write and publish more personal essays and books. One of those was about the lessons learned from his grandfather Dan Lowe, who he called \"Papa.\"\n\n\"Papa had lots of stories and wisdom to pass on,\" Leo wrote. \"He made me feel like a complete person, a dearly loved person, a person who was being coached and admonished at the same time about the dangers that lurked around the corner for a young Negro man in the South -- the habitat of that wicked beast, Jim Crow. Dan Lowe has been my hero for all these years. Heroes in our lives are individuals that stand high above the masses simply because of who they are. They have the unique ability to inspire us to pursue mountainous goals. I was fortunate enough to be at the side of my hero for many years.\"\n\nMen and women throughout this community and much farther afield have said precisely the same thing about Dr. Leo McGee.\n\nDr. Carl A Ventrice, Sr. passed away on Sunday morning, December 27, 2020, at the age of 90. He had served as a faculty member at Tennessee Tech for over 45 years, retiring from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2011.\n\nHe was born on August 7, 1930 in York, Pennsylvania. During his high school years, he had trained as a machinist, but soon realized after graduating from high school that it would be difficult to find a job in that field with so many men returning from service from World War II. Therefore, he decided to join the Navy in 1948 because he felt that this would give him a great opportunity to explore the world and learn a new profession. Since WWII had just ended, he believed that the chance of seeing any armed conflict would be low. He was trained as an electrician and the first ship he served on was the USS Chehalis, a tanker ship that supplied air fields in the Pacific theater. While off-loading aviation fuel in Samoa in 1949, his ship exploded, resulting in the loss of six of his fellow seamen. His next ship was a rocket vessel. While stationed in Japan, the Korean War broke out, and he ended up seeing service in the defense of the Pusan Perimeter, the Inchon Invasion, and the evacuation of the Chosin Reservoir. He was then assigned to a troop transport ship and was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1952.\n\nFollowing his Navy service, he was hired as an electrician in his hometown of York, Pennsylvania. Shortly after he was hired, the GI Bill was extended to Korean War veterans. Although he had a well-paid secure job, he decided to attend college and was the first Korean War veteran to apply for the GI bill in York county. He started his undergraduate studies in electrical engineering at Pennsylvania State University in 1952. He obtained a B.S. degree in electrical engineering in 1956 and then went on to graduate school in physics at Penn State. The research for his M.S. degree was in the area of electromagnetic wave scattering from the Earth’s ionosphere. His research for his Ph.D. was in nuclear physics. Just after he started his Ph.D. research, the lab director informed all of the students that there would be cuts in the number of positions being funded due to a reduction in federal funding because President Eisenhower had decided to put a bigger emphasis on applied research over basic research. Shortly after this, Sputnik was launched (October 1957), and the federal government made an abrupt change in funding priorities for research, prioritizing basic research over applied research. As a result of this, the nuclear physics lab at Penn State had more funding than they knew how to spend. Therefore, he no longer had to worry about his funding during the rest of his tenure as a graduate student. While studying at Penn State, he met his future wife, Marie Busck. The two were married on January 25, 1960.\n\nAs he was finishing his graduate studies, he began searching for a job. His dream job was to be a researcher at General Electric’s research center in Schenectady, New York, which was one of the top corporate research laboratories in the world at that time. He landed an interview with them but did not hear back from them by the time that he graduated with his Ph.D. in December 1962. Since his wife Marie was pregnant with their second child, he decided to accept a job offer from Analytic Services, which is a defense contractor in Washington, DC. About two weeks after starting this job, he got a job offer from GE, but since he had already started the job at Analytic Services, he declined the offer. Although the work at Analytic Services was interesting, it was not possible to publish his research since it was classified. In addition, he had developed a passion for teaching while he was a graduate student at Penn State. While attending an American Physical Society meeting in 1964, he was recruited for a faculty position in the Physics Department at Tennessee Tech, which was known as Tennessee Polytechnic Institute at that time. He started as a faculty member at Tech in the fall of 1964. During this time, his wife Marie studied to earn her B.S. degree in engineering science and mechanics. Although he enjoyed teaching in the Physics Department, the university did not have any Ph.D. programs at that time. Therefore, his research opportunities were limited at Tech. In 1966, he accepted a position as a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Auburn University. While at Auburn, his wife obtained an M.S. degree in mechanical engineering. In 1968, Tennessee Tech obtained approval from the State of Tennessee for a Ph.D. program in Engineering. Dr. Wallace Prescott, who was the Dean of Faculties at Tech at that time (and later became provost, and then president of Tech), contacted Dr. Ventrice to let him know of the new Ph.D. program and convinced him to return back to Tech. Dr. Ventrice returned to Cookeville in the summer of 1968 to become a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering. Shortly after returning to Tech, his wife Marie began her Ph.D. studies in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. She graduated with the first Ph.D. degree awarded at Tennessee Tech in 1974 and then began as a faculty member in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. She eventually became the Associate Dean of Engineering.\n\nDr. Ventrice had a very productive career at Tech, teaching electrical engineering and physics students and doing research in the areas of plasma science, laser technology, and electromagnetic field propagation and scattering. He was honored with Tennessee Tech’s Outstanding Faculty Award in Teaching and the Brown-Henderson Outstanding Engineering Faculty Award. During his tenure at Tech, he directed the research of over 30 graduate students. At the age of 81, he decided to officially retire from Tennessee Tech because of he no longer had the stamina to teach a full load of classes. He then continued to teach one class per semester as a service to the university until he had to stop teaching in 2013 because of failing health. He passed away on December 27, 2020. He was preceded in death by his wife, who died from cancer in 2003."
