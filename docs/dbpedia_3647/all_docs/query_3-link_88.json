        "text": "EAST CHICAGO - Surrounded by a multitude of well-wishers, Lew Wallace head\n\ncoach John Hoover basked in the light of victory. Standing in the middle of the\n\nE.C. Central gym, his smile was like a beacon.\n\nHis Hornets had just survived Hammond in a regional title thriller, 68-64.\n\nIn just his first full season as a head coach, Hoover watched a dream\n\ncrystalize.\n\nLike a square dance in a cemetery, Hoover found a way to dance in the shadow\n\nof certain death. With Hammond's Keith Herron sticking the shovel in the soil\n\nfor most of the second half, the Hornets found extended life.\n\nSurvival came in the name of Jamil Harris. After a first half in which\n\nWallace was 0 for 11 from 3-point land - a place they'd succeeded all year -\n\nHoover made the adjustment and took the ball inside. Harris, a senior center,\n\nscored a game-high 27 points.\n\nLew Wallace (18-6) had survived the Gary Sectional. It had endured a tough\n\nMerrillville team in Saturday's first semifinal. And barely breathing against\n\nthe upset-minded Wildcats, the Hornets simply found a way.\n\n\"God, they (Hammond) scared me to death,\" Hoover said with a fearful smile.\n\n\"They have improved so much. (Herron) is so quick I wasn't sure if we could\n\ncontain him.\n\n\"We had to make an adjustment at the half. I raised holy hell and told my\n\nguys to stop shooting the 3-pointer. Maybe playing two games in one day our\n\nkids' arms were tired. I don't know. But our perimeter shooting killed us in\n\nthe first half.\"\n\nHammond (17-7) led 33-31 at the break. Heady guard play by Herring -\n\nsteadily trying to slow the game's pace - and tough, blue-collar paint play by\n\nCharles Robinson, 10 first half points, inspired the 'Cats.\n\nAnd in a second half that was far from a \"flatliner,\" the Wildcats extended\n\ntheir lead to 51-47 going into the fourth and fateful quarter. There were four\n\nties and eight lead changes in the last quarter.\n\nAnd the final wasn't resolved until a game-tying Herring 3-pointer with 3\n\nseconds left caromed off the rim and was corraled by Wallace's Terrence Hayes.\n\n\"Their big kids really hurt us,\" Hammond coach George Green said. \"In a game\n\nlike this you try and defend certain things. You have to give Coach Hoover and\n\nhis kids some credit. They made the adjustments at the half and started\n\npounding the ball inside.\n\n\"We tried to control the tempo, but their kids did a great job of picking\n\nthe game up.\"\n\nWith twin Torrence Hayes in foul trouble for much of the second half,\n\nTerrence made it hard to miss him. And without a program, who could tell anyway?\n\nTerrence Hayes finished with 21 points for the Hornets, who'll make their\n\nfirst trip to Lafayette since 1986. He too joined in the second-life\n\ncelebration at game's end.\n\n\"We love playing in front of a crowd like this,\" Terrence Hayes said. \"This\n\nis the best feeling in the world. We've said all year, 'Never say die.' And\n\nthat's how we played tonight. We'll never give up.\n\n\"So everyone from Lew Wallace can gas up their cars because we're going to\n\nLafayette.\"\n\nHammond was led by Herron's 16 points. Robinson finished with 14 and Bob\n\nDelano played big in the middle with 13 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nBut despite the valiant play of the 'Cats - who haven't won a regional since\n\n1954 - it was the Hornets who once again avoided the Reaper.\n\n\"I'm just happy to get out of here alive,\" Hoover said before being carried\n\naway by a throng of happy fans.\n\nHAMMOND (64)\n\nJermaine Boyette 3 2-2 10, Batiste Haywood 4 1-3 9, Keith Herron 7 1-3 16,\n\nBob Delano 5 3-3 13, Charles Robinson 7 0-1 14, Christopher Moore 1 0-0 2, Dan\n\nSnyder 0 0-0 0, Damon Brown 0 0-0 0.
