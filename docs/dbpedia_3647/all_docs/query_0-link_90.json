And Sky Sports claims Blues are trying to sign 19-year-old Welshman Harris.\n\nHarris spent the second half of last season on loan at Exeter City, making 21 appearances in League One and scoring four times for the Grecians. Harris featured once for Fulham in the Premier League last term as a 16th minute substitute in a 5-1 defeat to Manchester City.\n\nThe Wales under-21 international is likely to head out on loan to continue his development and Blues have spaces in their squad. All eight signings Blues have made this summer have been permanent, meaning the club have five spaces in their match day squad for loan players.\n\nREAD: Blues transfer state of play - James and Dembele latest, plus Stansfield realism\n\nREAD: Davies set to make key Birmingham City decision before West Brom friendly\n\nBlues’ midfield options currently consist of Paik Seung-ho, Jordan James and Marc Leonard. Alfie Chang is still working his way back to fitness from a long-term knee injury."
