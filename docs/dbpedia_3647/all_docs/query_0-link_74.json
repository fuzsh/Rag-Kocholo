He tuned up for that assignment with four carries for 18 yards and a touchdown and a 16-yard reception in Pittsburgh’s 24-0 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in its preseason finale.\n\nMORE NFL:\n\n· RAIDERS GM DECLINES TO ADDRESS JOSH JACOBS-TRADE SPECULATION\n\n· JALEN HURTS SPORTS JERSEY FROM DEFUNCT BIRMINGHAM TEAM\n\n· FORMER ALABAMA DEFENSIVE BACK’S COMEBACK RUNS INTO NEW INJURY\n\nHarris ended the Steelers’ opening possession with a 1-yard touchdown plunge with 10:56 left in the first quarter.\n\nWith his fifth team in five seasons, Drake is competing for a spot on the Indianapolis Colts’ regular-season roster. With Jonathan Taylor, the Colts’ top running back, seeking to be traded and his projected backup, Zack Moss, out with a broken arm, Indianapolis’ depth chart at running back is full of question marks with the deadline to reduce the 90-player preseason roster to 53 looming at 3 p.m. CDT Tuesday.\n\nDrake ran for 21 yards on five carries and had two receptions for 22 yards and one touchdown in the Colts’ 27-13 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nDrake caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Gardner Minshew as Indianapolis took a 24-13 lead with 9:05 to play.\n\nRELATED: PRESEASON WEEK 3: SCHEDULE, TV, ODDS\n\nIn addition to Harris and Drake, 26 other players from Alabama high schools and colleges are on the rosters of the NFL teams in action on Thursday night:\n\nPittsburgh Steelers 24, Atlanta Falcons 0\n\n· Montravius Adams (Auburn) started at defensive tackle for the Steelers.

Pickens had a one-handed, 35-yard reception at the Atlanta 1-yard line that set up Pittsburgh’s first touchdown.\n\n· Levi Wallace (Alabama) started at cornerback for the Steelers. Wallace made one tackle.\n\nIndianapolis Colts 27, Philadelphia Eagles 13\n\n· Eagles safety Reed Blankenship (West Limestone) did not play.\n\n· Eagles cornerback James Bradberry (Pleasant Grove, Samford) did not play.\n\n· Colts cornerback Tony Brown (Alabama) made two tackles.\n\n· Eagles linebacker Zach Cunningham (Pinson Valley) did not play.\n\n· Eagles guard Landon Dickerson (Alabama) did not play.\n\n· Eagles offensive tackle Jack Driscoll (Auburn) did not play.\n\n· Colts guard Emil Ekiyor (Alabama) did not record any stats.\n\n· Colts safety Ronnie Harrison (Alabama) did not record any stats.\n\n· Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts (Alabama) did not play.\n\n· Eagles cornerback Josh Jobe (Alabama) did not play.\n\n· Colts center Ryan Kelly (Alabama) did not play.\n\n· Nicholas Morrow (Huntsville) started at linebacker for the Eagles.
