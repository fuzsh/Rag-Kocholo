        "text": "A legend paying tribute to another legend.\n\nOne of my favourite Dickie Moore stories is when he played for the St. Louis Blues. After a game one of his young teammates was mad and threw his sweater on the floor of the dressing room. Dickie Moore, a guy full of pride, grabbed the player by the throat and put him up against the wall, his feet dangling over the floor.\n\nDickie Moore ment business and squeezed his hand hard around the throat and hissed “That sweater never hits the floor, you got that? That crest never touched the floor in Montreal. That Bluenote, that crest, is your life, your livelihood. You always take pride in it.” I love that kind of mentality and I wish players today had an ounce of that.\n\nI remember reading about Glen Sather doing that during his time as a Montreal Canadien and Jean Beliveau (by then an executive with the club) caught the incident and politely, but very firmly, told Sather much the same sort of thing. When he ran the Edmonton Oilers during the glory years, Sather very much adopted the \"sweater never touches the floor rule\". In turn, Dave Semenko continued that habit near the end of his playing days when he was a Toronto Maple Leaf in 1987-88. Semenko commented on that that was one of the many not particularly nice things he saw in Toronto, with players casually tossing sweaters off (quite often onto the dressing room floor) after a game and he began hanging them up so that they didn't. BTW, Dickie Moore was my dad's boyhood hero, so RIP.\n\nThe 1399th pick in the all-time drafts in 2015 (on the ATD sub-board here at HfBoards) was mine and I proudly chose:\n\nchecking line center Rudy Migay, the offensive star of two Memorial Cups in 1947 and 1948 and an AHL co-MVP all-star in 1959, but inbetween he found himself playing 418 NHL games in the heart of the Original Six era on a defensive-oriented line with Ron Murphy on his wing. Known most for his penalty killing at the NHL level, the Leafs alternate captain did score 20+ points per season for five consecutive seasons between 1953-54 and 1957-58, including back-to-back seasons 4th in Leafs scoring. He brings a good basic skillset, defensive responsibility, hustle, grit and opportunistic secondary scoring to a great checking line.\n\nRudy Migay was a defensive player with the Toronto Maple Leafs and known as an elite penalty killer. He was nicknamed â€œToy Terrierâ€ because of puny size â€“ 5′6″ , 150 lbs and that he played the game with a ubiquitous and tenacious style of play.\n\nhttp://awinninghabit.com/2010/11/22/toronto-maple-leafs-hockeys-rudy/\n\nParkhurst said:\n\nRudy is often referred to as 'the honest workman' because he gives everything he has in every game. He plays center but is used mainly on penalty killing at which he excels.\n\nhttp://www.bradyscards.com/hockey/1...cards/1957-58_Parkhurst_6_Rudy_Migay_back.jpg\n\nRudy Migay was a spectacular player at the minor league level, but primarily a defensive player with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was best known as a penalty killer along with usual partner Ron Stewart.\n\nThe Fort William, Ontario native made quite a name for himself at the junior and AHL levels as a playmaking center. He was adoringly nicknamed \"Toy Terrier\" because of puny size (he stood just 5'6\" and 150 pounds) combined with his tenacious style of play.\n\nHowever the Leafs were a powerful team in the late 1940s, especially at center ice. Names like Max Bentley and Teeder Kennedy made it next to impossible to get much ice time. Migay was resigned to play with the Pittsburgh Hornets for 4 years before finally cracking the Leafs lineup.\n\nNeedless to say, Migay was definitely excited to join the Leafs, although he had to reinvent his game. It took him nearly three years to score as many points as he did in his last year of junior. Migay was content to play in a checking role for nearly 6 complete seasons with the Maple Leafs.\n\nBy the end of the 1957-58 season Migay's days in Toronto were coming to a close. He had finished the year in the minor leagues, and aside from the 20 more big league games, he wound up his career in the minor leagues both as player and as a playing coach.\n\nIt was a bitter ending for Migay, who felt he could have played at the NHL level over those final years of his career.\n\n\"I thought I might have a chance at coming back. I was hoping for a trade,\" said Migay, who along with Stan Mikita and Elmer Vasko was one of the few players of Slovak descent in the NHL's younger years.\n\nThe trade never materialized, of course. It was a different time back in the 1950s and 1960s. Teams could easily bury a player in the minor leagues and hope that the exiled players would tear up the minor leagues and possibly command more from in a trade. Migay held up his part of the deal - he went down without complaint and worked his butt off - scoring 82 points in just 51 games and shared the AHL's Most Valuable Player award (along with Bill Hicke)\n\nhttp://mapleleafslegends.blogspot.com/2009/06/rudy-migay.html\n\nRudy Migay I remember from the very early years of Hockey Night in Canada, which I began watching in 1953-54, its second year of existence. Viewers couldn't tell his diminutive physical stature from the telecast, the picture coming from on high with no close-ups like today's. But he was indeed tenacious both on and off the penalty kill. Commentator Foster Hewitt, from up on high in the Gondola at Maple Leaf Gardens, would remind us of his size from time to time.\n\nYes, the stronger teams back in the Original Six days stocked up NHL-quality players and put those they didn't need on a minor league team when they could still have been of value to one of the weaker NHL teams. Migay was one of those in the later years of his career. That was one of the ways the stronger teams maintained their strength.\n\nThe players from the 1950s are going very quickly now, and those from the 1960s are also going pretty regularly. How sad that is to those of us who grew up watching them play--and a stark reminder that some of us haven't too long to go, either.\n\nCondolences to Rudy Migay's family and friends.\n\nYes, the stronger teams back in the Original Six days stocked up NHL-quality players and put those they didn't need on a minor league team when they could still have been of value to one of the weaker NHL teams.

Boston or NY, the weaker clubs who couldve used the help. Really rather ruthless (and duplicitous) when you understand as well that in Imlachs case, he owned a big chunk of the minor pro teams to which he was assigning Leaf \"property\". Be it Rochester or Vancouver of the WHL.\n\nAware that Expansion was on the horizon, Punch part of the failed Vancouver bid (partners included Foster Hewitt) Imlach had been stocking the Amerks' & Canucks rosters with NHL caliber players for several years in order to insure that an NHL Canucks franchise would be competitive right out of the box. At the same time, having guys like Migay on those AHL/WHL/CHL franchises insured their success on the ice and at the gate, Mentors & Teachers to the younger & more promising rookies who couldnt quite crack the Leaf line-up.\n\nSo many of them, of Migays generation, absolutely NHL caliber. Their bad luck to be caught in the webs being spun however.... made the best of it, won Calders, perennial All Stars, honored members of the AHL Hall of Fame, and in Rudy Migays case as well of the Rochester Americans Hall of Fame.... and yes, death, always a reminder of our own mortality, how fleeting life really is. Seems like just yesterday we were watching any number of these guys flying down the wing, brilliantly stopping a 2 on 1, making a spectacular save, standing behind the bench....\n\nWhile he has no direct connection to the NHL he certainly had a huge impact on hockey in the US.\n\nJack Riley, who coached US hockey team to gold in 1960, dies at 95\n\nJack Rileyâ€™s hockey journey began at Medford High and led him through Dartmouth College, the 1948 US Olympic team, and the 1949 World Championships, when he led the US squad as a player-coach.\n\nBut nothing compared to Feb. 28, 1960, at the Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, Calif., when as head coach of the US team he watched the Americans score six unanswered goals in the third period to defeat Czechoslovakia, 9-4, and win the countryâ€™s first hockey gold medal.\n\nWhen Mr. Riley, who was head coach of the Army team, arrived home at West Point the next evening, he and his wife, Maureen, were welcomed with a 21-gun salute fired from seven cannons. They were symbolic of the seven teams the US team defeated, including consecutive upsets over Canada and the Soviet Union.\n\nâ€œIt wasnâ€™t always brotherly love, but this extraordinary group pulled together where it really counted â€¦ on the ice,â€ he wrote in a foreword to the 2009 book â€œ1960: Miracle at Squaw Valley.â€\n\nMr. Riley, who coached at the US Military Academy from 1950 to 1986 and who is enshrined in the United States and International Hockey halls of fame, died Wednesday in Decatur House in Sandwich. He was 95 and lived in Marstons Mills.\n\nâ€œOf all his memorabilia, and there were many, his Olympic gold medal was the one he treasured the most,â€ said his son Rob, who succeeded Mr. Riley as Armyâ€™s head coach and is now athletic director at Regis College.\n\nRochester\n\nYa, the Leafs, Imlach in particular did indeed \"bury\" guys like Migay in the minors rather than trading them to say...

All the aging former Leafs playing at Rochester could live in southern Ontario, Niagara Peninsula, with their families, some employment, save money. Not possible if they were traded to teams like Boston, Chicago or New York which entailed extra living expenses, no in season employment, displacing school aged children and wife etc."
