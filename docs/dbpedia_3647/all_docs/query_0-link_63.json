        "text": "My goal is to continue to improve as a player and as a student so that I can achieve my dream of playing soccer after High School.\n\nI am very coach-able and have a strong desire to continually improve my game - I started playing recreational soccer in a small town league, won a state championship at the Division 2 level, played on the only Division 1 team in the Trussville United Soccer Association and am now transferring to Vestavia Hills Soccer Club to continue my growth at either the RPL or D-1 level there. Even though I am a good listener, I am also a good leader. I have been my captain of my club teams over the years as well as co-captain of the Junior Varsity team at Hewitt-Trussville my freshman year. I will also not be outworked on and off the field. I take all workouts serious and treat all practices as game prep. I was able to gain a starting Center Back position on my Varsity team my Sophmore year (this Spring) on a team which had none returning Seniors in a highly competitive Region at the 7-A level. I then moved to Attacking Midfielder my Junior Season and earned Honorable Mention All Metro Team.\n\nI am a good student and would like to think I am pretty responsible. I like to have fun both on the field and off. I truly think I would be a benefit to any team I play with as I put the team goals ahead of my own. Soccer is my favorite thing and I can't imagine my life without it. I plan to study physical therapy/exercise science in college in hopes to move into the business of soccer after school - as a player or otherwise."
