Birmingham City have reportedly made an offer to take Fulham midfielder Luke Harris on loan.

Blues are scouring the market for midfielders and plan to sign at least one more to bolster Chris Davies’ ranks. And Sky Sports claims Blues are trying to sign 19-year-old Welshman Harris.

Harris spent the second half of last season on loan at Exeter City, making 21 appearances in League One and scoring four times for the Grecians. Harris featured once for Fulham in the Premier League last term as a 16th minute substitute in a 5-1 defeat to Manchester City.

The Wales under-21 international is likely to head out on loan to continue his development and Blues have spaces in their squad. All eight signings Blues have made this summer have been permanent, meaning the club have five spaces in their match day squad for loan players.
