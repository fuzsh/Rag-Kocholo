Harris comes to ‘Cuse after spending the 2022 season at Northwestern State as the wide receivers coach, where he led two all-conference wide receivers as well as the conference player of the year. Two of his wideouts recorded over 60 catches through 11 games at Northwestern State, which produced the nation’s No. 18 passing offense in the FCS in his season there.

He also spent the 2020 and 2021 seasons at Incarnate Word as a graduate assistant on the offensive side of the ball, assisting with quarterbacks, running backs, tight ends and offensive line. While there, the Cardinals posted one of the best offensive seasons in the FCS in 2021. They ranked near the top of the NCAA in scoring offense (2nd), total offense (2nd) and passing offense (2nd). Quarterback Cameron Ward averaged 410 yards per game through the air, was named a second team All-American and a Walter Payton Award finalist in Harris’ second season on staff.

A former college quarterback, he completed his playing career at Arkansas Tech in 2019 as a team captain, where he threw for 1,373 yards and five touchdowns while adding 125 yards and a score on the ground. Prior to his time in Russellville, he was a second team All-Southwest Junior College Football Conference quarterback at Cisco Junior College, where he led the NJCAA in passing yardage before a season-ending injury.

He began his college career at UTSA, where he was part of the Roadrunners’ first bowl appearance in program history. An All-State quarterback at Copperas Cove (Texas) High School, Harris is a 2018 graduate of UTSA in multidisciplinary studies and earned his Master of Education in teacher leading and learning from Arkansas Tech in 2020.
