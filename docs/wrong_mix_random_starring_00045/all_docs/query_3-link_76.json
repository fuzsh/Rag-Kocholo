        "text": "The New Florida Majority is based in Miami Florida. It is closely allied to the Miami Workers Center and the Freedom Road Socialist Organization, and New Florida Vision PAC.\n\nImpact\n\nThrough street-level organizing The New Florida Majority is overcoming the dark days of racism and divisiveness in the Sunshine State to bring the new light of fairness and equity to all residents.\n\nIn 2012, The New Florida Majority’s mobilization efforts resulted in the election of ten new progressive Federal and State legislators in Florida. Through our Breakthrough campaign, we reached more than 250,000 voters across the state, 76% of which turned out on election day.\n\nThis year, The New Florida Majority organizers are mobilizing leaders to significantly expand democratic rights for communities that have been historically marginalized, excluded and silenced. The key components of the campaign are: voting rights, immigration reform, fighting mass incarceration and standing up for women and our young people.\n\nWe are moving from the margins to the center of power by working together, taking ownership of our government and becoming the change we want to see we will help transform Florida.[1]\n\nElection 2020\n\nLeftRoots is just one of many groups work­ing to sup­port Seed the Vote​’s cam­paign effort in swing states, par­tic­u­lar­ly Penn­syl­va­nia, Flori­da and Arizona.\n\nThis year’s mis­sion is to fill the gap in the Biden campaign’s out­reach, which appears to be neglect­ing to reach some mar­gin­al­ized com­mu­ni­ties with a pow­er­ful vot­ing pool. In acti­vat­ing those peo­ple who have tra­di­tion­al­ly been left out, Seed the Vote hopes to nur­ture and build onto its exist­ing base of vot­ers and vol­un­teers, cre­at­ing a move­ment inde­pen­dent of the Demo­c­ra­t­ic Par­ty that can be acti­vat­ed for change.\n\n“We don’t know what the next weeks of the cam­paign will bring, but one thing is clear,” wrote Emily Lee of Seed the Vote and Peter Hogness of Water for Grassroots in New York in a recent Guardian op-ed. ​“Defeat­ing Don­ald Trump is too impor­tant to leave up to the Biden campaign.”\n\nThe solu­tion, they argue, lies in sup­port­ing estab­lished grass­roots orga­niz­ers who already have con­nec­tions to com­mu­ni­ties that are at risk of vot­er sup­pres­sion, or who aren’t yet reg­is­tered to vote.\n\n“In con­ver­sa­tions with dis­en­chant­ed vot­ers, a group doing long-term orga­niz­ing can have more cred­i­bil­i­ty than a candidate’s cam­paign,” state Lee and Hog­ness. ​“They’re work­ing in the com­mu­ni­ty 12 months a year, not just appear­ing at elec­tion time, extract­ing a vote, and then vanishing.”\n\nThese on-the-ground orga­ni­za­tions, how­ev­er, don’t always have the staff or vol­un­teer base avail­able to run oper­a­tions for a major cam­paign, par­tic­u­lar­ly in dense urban areas. Seed the Vote draws from a nation­al pool of vol­un­teers, trains them on the needs of each geo­graph­ic area, and deploys them to can­vass or phone bank for small orga­ni­za­tions. Often, com­mu­ni­ty-based non­prof­its or neigh­bor­hood groups are a way to start a con­ver­sa­tion with poten­tial vot­ers who the Biden cam­paign may over­look, or not be cul­tur­al­ly adept to talk to. For exam­ple, the Biden cam­paign didn’t ramp up efforts to tar­get Puer­to Rican vot­ers in Flori­da until mid-Sep­tem­ber. Seed the Vote has been mak­ing Span­ish-lan­guage calls in Flori­da since at least August.\n\nIn Flori­da, which Trump won by 112,911 votes in 2016, Seed the Vote part­ners with The New Florida Majority, which fights for inclu­sion of mar­gin­al­ized com­mu­ni­ties in the elec­toral process, and Mijente, which advo­cates for Lat­inx rights.\n\nFlori­da is a vital state to watch in the upcom­ing elec­tion. As the third most pop­u­lous state in the coun­try, it has 29 seats in the elec­toral col­lege, and has his­tor­i­cal­ly gone Republican.\n\nIt’s not impos­si­ble to flip. The pop­u­la­tion of peo­ple of col­or in Flori­da has grown 25% since 2010. Flori­da now has the third largest Lat­inx elec­torate in the coun­try, with 3.1 mil­lion eli­gi­ble to vote. But race does not always con­note a polit­i­cal stance. As Seed the Vote states on its web­site, ​“we can expect that Trump’s cam­paign will aggres­sive­ly pur­sue Lat­inx peo­ple and oth­er key groups in Flori­da through anti-abor­tion and anti-social­ist fearmongering.”\n\n\"Progressive\" victories\n\nSouth Florida Democratic candidates who had no reason to expect victory are preparing to be sworn in to office now thanks to the votes of people whom the pollsters largely ignored: unlikely voters.\n\nOne election post-mortem from the liberal nonprofit America Votes suggests unlikely voters cast 34 percent of the early and mail-in absentee votes during this election, propelling liberal Democrats such as Jose Javier Rodriguez of Miami and State Senator Maria Sachs of Boca Raton unexpectedly to the winners' circle.\n\nAn unlikely voter, says America Votes Florida director Josh Geise, is one who scores below 80 on a zero-to-100 scale of voting history, age, ethnicity, neighborhood and other factors that measure the propensity for voting. The likely voter model in use by several polling organizations uses only three elements: voting history, the voter's self-described intention to vote and his or her enthusiasm for the campaign.\n\nThe task for Democratic ground-gamers was to goad the unlikelys out of their torpor and campaigners say Republican legislators and Gov. Rick Scott made that easy with the voting law they passed in 2011.\n\n\"The (voter roll) purges, the crackdown on early voting -- all those things that were an attempt to make those voters even less likely to vote -- those things really ticked people off,\" says Gihan Perera, who runs the political nonprofit New Florida Majority. FNM staff and volunteers made calls and knocked on doors for Rodriguez, Sachs and other Democrats around the state.\n\nFNM also contributed manpower and data to winning Democratic Senate candidates Dwight Bullard of Miami and Darren Soto of Orlando.[2]\n\n\"Power in Miami-Dade County\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2016, New Florida Majority hosted a panel discussion on money, politics and power in Miami-Dade County. Featured local panelists include State Senator Dwight Bullard, Rev. Dr. R. Joaquin Willis of Church of the Open Door, and Elaine Black of Liberty City Trust.\n\nA recent study by the civil rights advocacy group Demos pinpoints a huge government-access problem in South Florida—while black people make up one-fifth of the county’s population, they represent only two percent of donors to mayoral campaigns. “Black people,” the study says, “can’t keep up with the deluge of campaign money coming from Miami’s cadre of rich lawyers, lobbyists, and real-estate tycoons.” Emmanuel Caicedo of Demos will join the panel to discuss the findings of the report and how campaign finance reform can begin to address some of these inequities.\n\nNew Florida Majority joined Accountable Miami-Dade at the Elections Department to drop drop off over 125,000 signed petitions in efforts to put a campaign finance reform measure on the November ballot. New Florida Majority collected over 16,000 of the petitions.\n\nThe panel is part of New Florida Majority’s RunMIA effort to engage traditionally underrepresented communities in local politics and tackle the problem of corruption and big money in county and municipal elections.\n\nWHAT: “Can we Run MIA?” #BlackDollarsMatter panel discussion on Money, Politics and Power in Miami-Dade\n\nWHO: State Senator Dwight Bullard, Rev. Dr. R. Joaquin Willis of Church of the Open Door, Elaine Black of Liberty City Trust, Emmanuel Caicedo of Demos, and Ginna Green of ReThink Media; moderated by New Florida Majority Executive Director Gihan Perera.[3]\n\nEducate\n\nOne of New Florida Majority’s main goals is to educate communities that have historically faced obstacles in participating in our political system. Most of this work is done through partners like Wellstone Action, and our 501c3 organization, New Florida Majority Education Fund (NFM-EF).[4]\n\nStaff retreat\n\nJackie Jahosky December 7, 2018 · Fort Lauderdale, FL ·\n\nThe New Florida Majority staff retreat.\n\n— with Monalisa Weber and Nancy Metayer, Bertisha Jones, Paola Montenegro, Easton K. Harrison, Serena Perez, Mike Todd, Carlos Naranjo, Jacob Coker-Dukowitz, Kelli Ann, Andrea Mercado at Conrad Fort Lauderdale Beach (Fort Lauderdale, FL).\n\nMedicare for All National Day of Action\n\nMiami Democratic Socialists of America April 22, 2018.\n\nMembers of The New Florida Majority, United We Dream, National Nurses United, & YDSA FIU participated in today’s Democratic Socialists of America Townhall at Second Baptist Church in Richmond Hights as part of the Democratic Socialists for Medicare for All National Day of Action. Shout out to Annette Taddeo and Michael Hepburn for coming through to support #MedicareForAll. 🌹#DSAm4a — with Dwight Bullard, Religious Socialism and FLIC Votes.\n\nBlack Votes Matter\n\nThe New Florida Majority October 27, 2014.\n\nJoin Florida New Majority, Senator Audrey Gibson, Senator Chris Smith, President of United Teachers of Dade - Fedrick Ingram, and Political Director of SEIU 1199 - Roxey Nelson for a townhall with thousands of black voters discussing the issues of the Governors' race, education, healthcare, and the criminal justice system.\n\nRoxey Nelson was replaced by SEIU 1199 President Monica Russo.\n\nStatewide Alliance Group\n\nFrom JoHanna Thompson writing on the Freedom Road Socialist Organization's website:\n\nDespite his position on anti-BDS legislation, Gillum seemed like someone who comrades could work with in office.\n\nFalling in line with the New Confederacy, DeSantis was less concerned with changing liberal minds than attacking liberal ideologies, making inaccurate associations of his opponent, and getting conservative voters to the polls.\n\nOne door hanger asked the question, “Does this sound familiar?” It depicted a picture of a street mural, by a local artist, of Andrew Gillum. Underneath the picture were the words, “Andrew Gillum: Another Big Government, Socialist Dictator” followed by three more street murals of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Fidel Castro, and Hugo Chavez. It boldly proclaimed, “Don’t let the socialists take over Florida! Republicans must vote, there’s too much at stake.”\n\nOn one hand, the door hanger was laughable, while on the other, it spoke to the intentional decision of grassroots organizations and a union to work collectively as Statewide Alliance Group. SWAG specifically consists of: The New Florida Majority, Dream Defenders, Organize Florida, Florida Immigrant Coalition, SEIU, Faith in Florida, and Central Florida Jobs with Justice.\n\nThe Dream Defenders (DD) took a deep dive in community to create an ideology reminiscent of the Black Panther Party Ten Point Program with seven freedoms. DD launched the #freedompapers, claiming #thisistheyear, focusing on building with community to target private prison corporations, like GEO Group, and transform the Florida political landscape.\n\nFlorida Immigrant Coalition (FLIC) along with Black Alliance for Just Immigration (BAJI) and United We Dream focused on immigrant rights and abolishing ICE. The New Florida Majority (NFM), SEIU, Faith in Florida, Jobs with Justice, and the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) Electoral Justice Project appealed to their vast membership bases.\n\nIn addition, the Miami Workers Center (MWC) centered the Movement for Black Women and Girls with Soul Sista’s. Power U Center for Social Change continues to inform youth. Community Justice Project (CJP) supported Poetry for the People’s, Maroon Poetry Festival, which amplified the Black Arts Movement and use of art in activism.\n\nThe age old social justice organizations such as NAACP, ACLU, Faith in Florida, PACT, and the likes, also joined the effort to get Amendment 4 passed. All used the same messaging in their conversations which advocated for a Yes Vote on Amendment 4. The strategy was to restore the rights of over 1.4 million voters as freedom voters.\n\nIt was a brilliant, coordinated strategy in alignment and consistent communication that is beginning to consolidate a united front against the New Confederacy in Florida.[5]\n\nPersonnel\n\nAs of December 2020:\n\nAndrea Cristina Mercado EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nVictricia Simmons CHIEF OF STAFF\n\nMone Holder SENIOR PROGRAM DIRECTOR – POLICY, ADVOCACY & RESEARCH\n\nDanielle Goodman DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR\n\nCheryl R.

Rick Scott hasn't set a date for a special election yet and a spokeswoman didn't indicate his timeline Thursday. Artiles resigned earlier this month after using racist and sexist language toward African-American senators.[11]\n\nCAIR connection\n\nFlorida Immigrant Coalition October 13 2018:\n\nGood conversation tonight with CAIR - Florida, The New Florida Majority and the ACLU of Florida on what advocacy means in these difficult times. — with Tomas Kennedy and Dwight Bullard at Islamic Center of Greater Miami-Masjid Miami Gardens.\n\nSupporting Gillum\n\nThe New Florida Majority, April 27 2017.\n\nWith Gihan Perera, Valencia Gunder, Andrew Gillum, Renee Mowatt and Dwight Bullard.\n\nGillum endorsement\n\nJune 12 2018– The New Florida Majority , enthusiastically announced Tuesday their endorsement of Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is running to become the Democratic nominee for Governor of Florida.\n\nThe organization’s Ad Hoc Committee for Political Endorsements delivered its decision to the NewFM board just hours after Gillum and his fellow Democratic primary candidates participated in the Florida Freedom Forum Gubernatorial Debate in Miramar, in front of a packed audience of over 800 people. Tuesday morning, the board unanimously ratified the committee’s recommendation to endorse Mayor Gillum.\n\n“We looked at the candidates, their answers to our survey and their performance at tonight’s debate and determined that Andrew Gillum is the leader Florida needs to guide the state towards a more equitable future,” said NewFM Executive Director Andrea Mercado. “His performance today and his campaign so far has proven that he is willing to be bold and unapologetic in standing up for our communities.”\n\nGillum was the clear favorite among the Spanish and English speaking The New Florida Majority endorsement committee who assembled Monday night. Candidates fielded questions on issues that reflected the concerns of the diverse audience that assembled at the Miramar Cultural Center. Those concerns included affordable housing, gun violence, criminal justice reform, education, immigration, climate change, and an economy that supports working class Floridians.\n\n“I think we all thought that Mayor Gillum responded the best and showed a deep understanding of politics and the problems of Florida,”said Claudia Toboada of Broward.\n\n“Gillum is the candidate that showed a deeper understanding of the life of working class people and marginalized communities,” said Andres Leon from Miami. “Now we need to organize our communities to get him into office.”\n\n“His answers were the most clear, sharp and concise out of all the candidates present in the debate,” said Dario Zapata, from Broward. “He had a way of connecting with the audience that is very important for a campaign.”\n\nOd’Juan Whitfield from Jacksonville agreed that Mayor Gillum was the clear winner Monday evening and should be NewFM’s choice for Governor. “He spoke directly to the people, which made him easy to relate to.” said Whitfield. “I was impressed.”\n\nWalking away from the debate, several members were already eager to hit the streets and mobilize community members to vote for Gillum in the August primary. Close to 13 million people are currently registered in Florida, including 4.8 million registered Democrats, 4.6 million Republicans and 3.5 million No Party Affiliation (NPA). While 75% of all registered voters came out for the 2016 elections, only 51% came out in the 2014 midterm elections that saw incumbent Gov. Rick Scott beat former Gov. Charlie Crist by one percent or 64,145 folks.[12]\n\n\"Beyond Resistance: Reclaiming our Progressive Future\"\n\nBeyond Resistance: Reclaiming our Progressive Future was a November 15, 2017 gathering of the Democracy Alliance.
