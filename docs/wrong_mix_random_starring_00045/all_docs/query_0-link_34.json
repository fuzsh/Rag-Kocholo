Building upon his adverse experiences during more than six and a half years of captivity in North Vietnam, Ed conveys a positive message for personal growth. After hearing his presentation, you will feel good about your country, yourself, and your own ability. A product of the Midwest, Ed spent his childhood in the Kansas City area. At age seventeen, he joined the Air Force Reserve and in 1962, entered active duty where he received his navigator wings and commission through the Aviation Cadet program. Ed culminated a twenty-eight-year, active duty, military career in August, 1990, of which almost 25% (six years, seven months, and 12 days) were spent as a prisoner of war. It was an experience that truly changed his life, and as a result, the lives of countless others. Following his release from prison in 1973, Ed completed five college degrees in seven years, in his spare time and at night. In 1976, his concept-after only eight days of implementation -increased the productivity of a $350 million resource by 50%. He later inherited an organization designated \"...the worst managed...\" among fifty-eight units by an Air Force audit. Within four month, he turned the unit around and demonstrated statistically significant improvement in 96% of the audited areas. During ten years as head of the largest safety organization in the Air Force, they shattered all records. The unit achieved 30% to 70% improvements in all categories, where a 3% improvement had long been the norm. His organization was recognized as \"best in the Air Force\" for ten consecutive years, and a previously accepted, multi-million dollar loss rate per year was reduced to lee than fifty-thousand dollars per year. In 1985, Ed began motivational speaking. Following his Air Force retirement in 1990, Ed formed Positive Vectors, Inc. in order to share the lessons he learned during captivity and authenticated by his Air Force results. Since, he has spoken to thousands of members of corporate America, government agencies, and non-profit groups. Ed's desire to change the attitudes of individuals through a better understanding of true, human potential remains his number one goal in life. Today, Ed is an acknowledged motivational speaker, management consultant, artist, and author. His book, \"Escape from the box: The wonder of Human Potential\" was published in January, 1994.\n\nSylvester Oliver(Sly), lives and works in one of the most fascinating places on Earth - McMurdo Base in Antarctica.

Her name is Margherita Bertola Fray. As a young girl she was raised in a determinedly anti-Fascist family who suffered some deprivations because of this opposition. In her teen years she and her family, as with all Italians, suffered and were witness to the horrors of bombings, executions, and other brutalities perpetrated by home-grown and foreign aggressors. She became a member of the “Resistenza” as a partisan, belonging to a group called the Garibaldi Brigade around her home city of Turin and participated in dangerous missions to support the fighters in the underground for several years. More than once, she put herself in harm’s way for the good of others and for her country. Fortunately, she lived to tell about her experiences even though she is still emotionally distraught over memories of this horrific time. In 1946 she came to America as a War Bride, marrying a man she had briefly met only a year earlier. He promised to return to Italy to marry her, which he did. Her early years as a young woman and mother in a foreign land, married to a deeply flawed man she really didn’t know at all, were unhappy and presented her with many challenges that might have subdued a lesser person. Thanks in part to the strengths from her upbringing and experiences in Italy, she endured and is contented living in Scottsdale, Arizona — except for the fact that her story had remained untold.\n\nCaptain Mykel Hawke is a retired U.S. Army Special Forces officer, author, and television and film personality.
