Delve into the neurotic New York family dynamic of Island City Stage’s newest comedy, Skintight by Joshua Harmon, running May 30 through June 23.\n\nInitially premiering Off-Broadway in 2018 at the Roundabout Theater in New York City, Skintight examines the nature of love, the power of attraction, and the ways in which a superficial culture persists in teaching its children that all that matters is what’s on the inside.\n\nReeling from her ex-husband’s engagement to a much younger woman, Jodi Isaac turns to her famous fashion-designer dad for support. Instead, she finds him wrapped-up in his West Village townhouse with Trey. Who’s 20. And not necessarily gay. But probably an adult film star. At least, according to Jodi’s son. Who’s also 20. And definitely gay.\n\nPlaywright Joshua Harmon brings neurotic family drama and comedy to the forefront as father and daughter contend with the age-old questions of how to age gracefully in a world obsessed with youth and where love fits into it all.\n\nHarmon’s other plays include Bad Jews, Significant Other, Admissions, and Prayer for the French Republic. He and Sarah Silverman co-wrote the libretto for The Bedwetter based on her memoir. His plays have been produced on Broadway and the West End; off-Broadway at Roundabout Theatre Company, Lincoln Center Theater, Manhattan Theater Club and Atlantic Theater Company; across the country at Geffen Playhouse, Speakeasy, Studio Theatre, Theater Wit, About Face, Actor’s Express, and The Magic, among others; and internationally in a dozen countries. He is a two-time MacDowell fellow and an associate artist at Roundabout. He is a Juilliard graduate.\n\nSkintight is directed by Rogow and stars Suzanne Ankrum, Laura Argo, Jeff Brackett, Daniel Barrett, Louis Pedraza and Steve Schroko.\n\nSkintight is sponsored by Thel Boylette and David Page. Costume Sponsors are DC Allen and Ken Flick and Sound Sponsor is Scott Bennett. Additional funding provided by the following: The Our Fund Foundation, The Schubert Foundation Inc., The SHS Foundation, The Maval Foundation, the Warten Foundation, the Broward County Board of County Commissioners as recommended by the Broward Cultural Council, and by the Department of State, Division of Cultural Affairs, the Florida Council of Arts and Culture and the State of Florida.\n\nIsland City Stage’s 12th Season closing production will be Die! Mommie Die! by Charles Busch (Aug. 29 – Sept. 22).\n\nTickets for Skintight start at $40. A Mimosa Sunday performance sponsored by Deborah Floyd will take place on June 9 with tickets at $55. The show runs for 2 hours 15 minutes including intermission.\n\nFor more information and to purchase tickets, visit www.islandcitystage.org, call (954) 928-9800 or email boxoffice@islandcitystage.org.

Renowned for his adept craftsmanship, Grennan brings forth endearing and authentic characters, crafting moments that blend humor with genuine human experiences.\n\nIn A Rock Sails By, Dr. Lynn Cummings, an astrophysicist, tries to bring science and faith into balance while grappling with personal questions, reconnecting with her daughter, and mourning the loss of her husband. When an unidentified object is discovered heading toward Earth, a less-than-reputable online magazine misquotes her, casting doubt on her credibility. Dr. Cummings hopes to witness nothing remarkable and thus save her reputation, but there is no telling what she will discover beyond the stars.\n\nUnder the direction of David Arisco, A Rock Sails By stars Laura Turnbull as Dr. Lynn Cummings, marking her third Sean Grennan play following acclaimed performances in Now and Then and The Tin Woman at Actors’ Playhouse. Turnbull was recently seen in Cabaret at Zoetic Stage, Rooted at Theatre Lab, and Murder On the Orient Express at the Maltz Jupiter Theatre.

Condados en los que sus habitantes, en su gran mayoría inmigrantes, comparten un objetivo común y lo arriesgan todo para lograr sus sueños.\n\n“Ambas obras son espectáculos que tienen la virtud de llegar al corazón del espectador porque divierten y al mismo tiempo emocionan. Creo que esa es la llave de lo que ocurre con su éxito, generando ese deseo de repetir las funciones, y convirtiéndose para la gente en algo más que entretenimiento”, dijo Mauricio Dayub.\n\nSOBRE ‘EL AMATEUR’:\n\nPieza consolidada como una de las obras más emblemáticas del teatro independiente de Argentina.

Experience the emotional journey of returning to a place of origin and the challenges of cultural integration through a captivating live performance.\n\n“Bajan” is a term for Barbadian. Can one return home to a place that has never been home? Will the young ones in the family flourish coming of age as Bajans, or will their “Yankee” culture hurt friends and family? What cultural and colonial baggage does one bring to such an experience? In the process, Yankee Bajan examines the circumstances in the United States that would drive a family to consider becoming expatriates.\n\nYankee Bajan takes the audience back to the wisdom of the Barbadian Heroes, a select group including freedom fighters, trade union pioneers, and defenders of human rights. It takes us through the expatriate experience, and ultimately, the return to an independent Caribbean island.\n\nMiami New Drama y Tectonic Theater Project presentan: “Las Aventuras De Juan Planchard” 10/17/23\n\nMiami New Drama y Tectonic Theater Project presentan: “Las Aventuras De Juan Planchard”\n\nSunday, 10/17/2023-11/12/2023, 08:00 pm-10:00 pm\n\nColony Theater\n\n1040 Lincoln Road,\n\nMiami Beach, Florida, 33139\n\nWebsite\n\nCost: 46.50\n\nMIAMI, Miami New Drama y Tectonic Theater Project quieren presentar el excepcional elenco de artistas del estreno mundial Las Aventuras de Juan Planchard, una cautivadora obra escrita y dirigida por el aclamado Moisés Kaufman, adaptada de la exitosa novela de Jonathan Jakubowicz.\n\nDel 17 de octubre al 12 de noviembre de 2023, Las Aventuras de Juan Planchard promete ser una experiencia cautivadora para los amantes del teatro, representada en español con supertítulos en inglés, garantizando así la accesibilidad para todos.\n\nEncabezando la producción se encuentra el versátil actor venezolano Christian McGaffney, quien encarna el papel de Juan Planchard, un apasionado joven venezolano creyente inquebrantable en la ideología del Presidente Hugo Chávez, igualada solo por su búsqueda de ganancias personales.

Dixie Highway,\n\nWilton Manors, Florida, 33305\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nCost: $40 – $55\n\nLove! Valour! Compassion! – Terrence McNally’s most honored and celebrated play about eight gay friends who spend the holidays over one summer at one’s beautiful hundred-year-old house in upstate New York, kicks off Island City Stage’s 12th thrilling season. The show runs from October 12 – November 5.\n\nAt a lakeside summer vacation house in Dutchess County, two hours north of New York City, eight gay friends spend the three major holiday weekends of one summer together for Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. The house belongs to Gregory, a successful Broadway choreographer now approaching middle age, who fears he is losing his creativity; and his twenty-something lover, Bobby, a legal assistant who is blind. Each of the guests at their house is connected to Gregory’s work in one way or another – Arthur and longtime partner Perry are business consultants; John Jeckyll, a sour Englishman, is a dance accompanist; die-hard musical theater fanatic Buzz Hauser is a costume designer and the most stereotypically gay man in the group. Only John’s summer lover, Ramon, and John’s twin brother James are outside the circle of friends. But Ramon is outgoing and eventually makes a place for himself in the group, and James is such a gentle soul that he is quickly welcomed.\n\nFlorida-born Terrence McNally is considered one of the most prolific and highly lauded playwrights, librettists and screenwriters in the last 50 years. His decades of works explored human relationships – frequently those of gay men. In addition to Love! Valour! Compassion!, McNally’s works include Bad Habits, The Ritz, Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune, Masterclass, and Mothers and Sons, among many others. McNally’s librettos for Kiss of the Spider Woman and Ragtime won him Tony Awards in 1993 and 1998, respectively. Additional credits as a librettist included The Full Monty, Catch Me if You Can, and The Visit. He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1996, and he also received the Dramatists Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. In 2018, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the highest recognition of artistic merit in the United States. In 2019, he won a Lifetime Achievement Tony award. His other accolades included an Emmy Award, two Guggenheim Fellowships, a Rockefeller Grant, four Drama Desk Awards, two Lucille Lortel Awards, two Obie Awards, and three Hull-Warriner Awards.\n\nThe Love! Valour! Compassion!, ensemble cast features theatre veterans Chad Darnell, Robert Koutras, Bruce Linser, Saul Mendoza, Christoper Michaels, Matthew Salas, and Michael Scott Ross.\n\nLove! Valour! Compassion! is directed by Michael Leeds and co-produced by Robert Korn and Alvaro Menendez. Set sponsor is Glenn Goldberg and Lighting Sponsor is Scott Bennett.\n\nIsland City Stage’s 12th Season will also feature Which Way to the Stage by Ana Nogueira (Jan. 18 – Feb. 11); Pulp by Patricia Kane; Music by Amy Warren & Andre Pluess with lyrics by Patricia Kane (Apr. 11 – May 5); Skintight by Joshua Harmon (May 30 – Jun. 23) and Die! Mommie Die! by Charles Busch (Aug. 29 – Sept. 22).\n\nTickets for Love! Valour! Compassion! start at $40.

In Island City Stage’s newest comedy production, “Tracy Jones” by Stephen Kaplan, the lonely eponymous character throws a party inviting every other woman with the same name to join her for chicken wings and beer! Part of National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere in three different cities, this touching story of individual connection in an increasingly complicated world hits the South Florida stage from May 18 – June 18.\n\nTracy Jones is having a major life crisis. Her job at the bank is taking her nowhere, her panic attacks are getting worse and having such a common name is giving her an identity crisis. With everything spiraling out of control around her, it’s time to find something she can take control of. That’s when it hits her; she’s going to throw a party to celebrate every woman named Tracy Jones. After an extensive marketing campaign that included tracking down others by the same name, posters and a Facebook event, the party is finally here. The Funtime Party Zone at the Jones Street Bar & Grill is all set up and Tracy is eagerly awaiting her guests.\n\nStephen Kaplan is an award-winning playwright with productions off-Broadway and in regional theaters, nationally. “Tracy Jones” is a National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere playing simultaneously at Williamston Theatre in Williamston, Michigan and CenterStage in Rochester, New York, in addition to Island City Stage in Wilton Manors, Florida.
