        "text": "Abdelaziz Bouteflika's ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) party has called for the ailing president to step down, following similar calls from its coalition partner the National Rally for Democracy (RND).\n\nIn a party statement released Wednesday, the FLN announced their support for the army's call for the invocation of Article 102 of Algeria's constitution, which will essentially remove Bouteflika from power.\n\n\"We announce our support for the initiative as a start to a constitutional plan that will allow us to protect our country from dangers,\" the statement read.\n\nThe FLN party led Algeria's independence war against France in 1954 and has been in power ever since.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Seddik Chihab, a spokesman for Algeria's coalition RND party, called his president's administration a 'cancer' on Wednesday morning.\n\nChihab was talking to Algerian channel Echorouk TV.\n\nThis follows former Algerian prime minister and RND leader Ahmed Ouyahia encouraging Bouteflika to resign, according to a party statement.\n\nFormer Ally, Ouyahia's message was yet another blow to Bouteflika's withering leadership after Algeria's army chief withdrew support for the embattled president on Tuesday.\n\nAhmed Gaid Salah, a long-time ally, has called for his dismissal under a part of the constitution that allows for a head of state to be removed if they are seriously unwell and unable to carry out their functions.\n\nBouteflika had a stroke five years ago and is rarely seen in public.\n\nHe dropped plans to run for a fifth presidential term in the face of widespread protests.\n\nBut he remained in office and demonstrations have resumed.\n\nGaid Salah, speaking on Tuesday, praised the maturity of Algerians and their peaceful protests.\n\n“In order to protect our country from any hazardous situation, everybody needs to show selflessness and to take into consideration the higher interests of our home country in order to find an immediate solution to this crisis,” he said.\n\n“A solution in accordance to the constitution that is the only guarantee of a stable situation.\n\n“In this regard, we urge and have to adopt a solution that guarantees a crisis exit and responds to the legitimate demands of the Algerian people.\n\n“This solution ensures the respect of the constitution and the rule of law. It will also guarantee consensus among all parties. Such a solution is stipulated by article 102 of the constitution.\""
