        "text": "ALGIERS — The corruption trial for two former Algerian prime ministers, prominent politicians and automotive industry tycoons started on Wednesday in Algiers, with defense lawyers boycotting the proceedings.\n\nThe trial is the first resulting from sweeping investigations into graft allegations launched after the resignation of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in the face of mass protests in April.\n\nThe accused face charges ranging from money laundering to abuse of office and granting undue privileges in the vehicle assembly industry.\n\nThe trial had been adjourned on Monday and the defense vowed to boycott further hearings, criticizing the case as \"politicized\" and marred by a climate of \"settling accounts\".\n\nLawyer Mohamed Madjdoub, speaking on behalf of the defense, told the judge that \"conditions... do not allow for lawyers to accomplish their mission and therefore, I inform you that the defense has decided to boycott the trial\".\n\nThe judge asked the lawyers to leave the small, crowded courtroom and said the proceedings would continue.\n\nThe nascent Algerian automotive sector got its start in 2014, via partnerships between foreign groups and large Algerian corporations, often owned by businessmen linked to Bouteflika's entourage.\n\nTwo former prime ministers who served under Bouteflika appeared as defendants on Wednesday: Ahmed Ouyahia, an unpopular four-time former government head, and Abdelmalek Sellal, who was premier from 2014 to 2017.\n\nIt is the first time since Algeria's independence from France in 1962 that former prime ministers have been put on trial.\n\nThe two men argued that the court was not competent to try them, the constitution stipulating that crimes and infractions committed by prime ministers while in office fell under a \"High Court of State\".\n\nBut the organic law to establish this court was not passed and the prosecutor responded that they had to answer for their actions before the ordinary court.\n\nCalled first to the stand, Ouyahia was accused of \"misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office, granting undue privileges, conflict of interest, corruption, money laundering and false statements\".\n\nHe was charged with favoring certain manufacturers in the automotive sector — even if they did not fulfill brief specifications — to the detriment of competitors.\n\n\"There is no misappropriation (of public funds) and the choice... was based on the market. These manufacturers were already present and we wanted to keep them\", the former prime minister said in his defense.\n\nSellal also flatly denied all the charges against him, saying he had had \"no authority\" over his ministers but only a \"coordination\" role as premier.\n\nFormer ministers Bedda Mahdjoub (industry and mines), Youcef Yousfi, who succeeded him in the post, and Abdelghani Zaalane (public works and transport) are other defendants in the case.\n\nZaalane was questioned over charges related to \"secret\" financing of Bouteflika's campaigns.\n\nThe former minister said that while he was Bouteflika's campaign manager for nine days in March 2019, he was aware of donations from five businessmen amounting to 750 million dinars ($6.2 million), well above the legal campaign spending cap.\n\nAlso standing trial was Ali Haddad, former head of the main Algerian employer organisation, the Forum of Business Leaders (FCE).\n\nThe 54-year-old businessman is also the founder and CEO of private construction firm ETRHB.\n\nAmong the other businessmen being tried is former FCE vice president Mohamed Bairi, CEO of the Ival group, which owns industrial vehicle plant Iveco.\n\nAhmed Mazouz, president of the eponymous group that assembles and distributes Chinese-brand vehicles in Algeria, and Hassane Arbaoui, head of Global Group which runs an Algerian factory for South Korean company Kia, are also defendants.\n\nThe trial is set to continue on Thursday. — AFP"
