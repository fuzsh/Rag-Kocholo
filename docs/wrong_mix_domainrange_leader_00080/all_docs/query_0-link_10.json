        "text": "Algerian authorities have arrested five billionaires as part of an anti-corruption investigation, State TV reported.\n\nIssad Rebrab, the founder and chairman of Cevital, Algeria‘s biggest privately held company, was arrested on Monday alongside four brothers from the Kouninef family.\n\nReda, Abdelkader, Karim and Tarek Kouninef are believed to be part of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika‘s inner circle while Rebrab, owner of the critical Liberte newspaper, opposed the president’s 2014 re-election.\n\nRebrab denied the arrest in a tweet shortly after the announcement was made, saying he voluntarily answered the police’s call to give evidence on a case involving industrial equipment which authorities had seized from him in June 2018.\n\nBut private Ennahar TV channel reported later on Monday the five individuals seized by authorities had been taken to court to face the charges levelled by the general prosecutor’s office. Further details were not immediately available.\n\n190403094806880\n\nThe move came after Algeria’s army chief, Lieutenant General Gaid Salah, announced last week that members of the ruling elite in the major oil and natural gas-producing country would be prosecuted for corruption.\n\nAn Algerian court has already summoned former Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia and current Finance Minister Mohamed Loukal, two close associates of Bouteflika, in an investigation into suspected misuse of public money, state TV said on Saturday.\n\nAuthorities also arrested prominent businessman Ali Haddad in early April.\n\nOne of the country’s richest men, Haddad was caught trying to cross into neighbouring Tunisia with large sums of money.\n\nCalls for political overhaul\n\nBouteflika stepped down two weeks ago after 20 years in power, bowing to pressure from the army and weeks of demonstrations by mainly younger Algerians seeking change.\n\nDemonstrators in the North African country want a new generation of leaders to replace a ruling elite seen by many ordinary Algerians as out of touch and unable to jump-start a faltering economy hampered by cronyism.\n\nBouteflika has been replaced by Abdelkader Bensalah, head of the upper house of parliament, as interim president for 90 days until a presidential election is held on July 4.\n\nHundreds of thousands protested on Friday to demand the resignation of Bensalah and a complete political overhaul. The protests marked the ninth consecutive week of demonstrations.\n\nSalah said on April 16 the military was considering all options to resolve the ongoing political crisis, but also warned: “Time is running out”.\n\nHe did not specify what measures the army could take, though said military leaders “have no ambition but to protect our nation”.\n\nThe army has largely patiently monitored the mostly peaceful protests that at times swelled to hundreds of thousands of people."
