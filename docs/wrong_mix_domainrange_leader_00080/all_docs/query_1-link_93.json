They fear Islamist revolutionaries and are offering a small share of power to selected critics of their own regimes. They think this necessary to win friends abroad, to help stability at home and to promote economic reform - without unduly upsetting vested interests. Their real, radical opponents remain tightly restricted or outlawed.",
