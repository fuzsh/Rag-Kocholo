In Nov. 1954 the Front de Libération Nationale (FLN), representing the Muslim majority, declared open warfare against the French administration. Fierce fighting continued unabated until March 1962 when a ceasefire was agreed between the French government and the nationalists. Against the wishes of the French in Algeria, Gen. de Gaulle conceded Algerian independence on 3 July 1962."
