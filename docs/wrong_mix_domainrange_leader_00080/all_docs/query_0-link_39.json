        "text": "Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has postponed the 18 April presidential elections and said he will not seek a fifth term in office.\n\nPresident Bouteflika's candidacy had provoked mass protests across Algeria over the past few weeks.\n\nHe has led Algeria for 20 years but has been rarely seen in public since he suffered a stroke in 2013.\n\nNo new date for the election was set. A cabinet reshuffle will happen soon, a statement in Mr Bouteflika's name said.\n\nThere was no suggestion in the announcement that the president intends to step down before a rescheduled election.\n\nMeanwhile, Algeria's Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia announced his resignation and was replaced by Interior Minister Noureddine Bedoui, who has been tasked with forming a new government, the official APS news agency reported.\n\nPressure mounted on Mr Bouteflika to withdraw when more than 1,000 judges said on Monday they would refuse to oversee the planned general election were he a candidate.\n\nThen the military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Gaed Salah, said the military and the people had a united vision of the future - the strongest indication so far that the armed forces were sympathetic to the protests.\n\nTop clerics had already criticised pressure on them to issue pro-government sermons. \"Leave us to do our job, don't interfere,\" cleric Imam Djamel Ghoul, leader of an independent group of clerics, told journalists.\n\nRana Jawad, BBC North Africa correspondent\n\nThis will be seen as a partial victory for those who have been on the streets for weeks. While it is a guarantee from Mr Bouteflika that he will not seek a fifth term, the absence of a new election date potentially leaves the process frustratingly open-ended.\n\nThe reaction on social media was swift, and questions are already being asked over the legality of prolonging Mr Bouteflika's term in office beyond the constitutional mandate.\n\nThe delay could help to ensure a peaceful transition of power - allowing all candidates to campaign properly while addressing the public's core demand of removing Mr Bouteflika from office.\n\nBut key to satisfying the protesters' demand will be a timetable for his departure. And the legitimacy of an election does not stop at the ballot box - the ruling elite, the country's judges, and its electoral bodies will need to demonstrate a genuine will to ensure a free and fair poll.\n\nAlgerians have shown they are no longer willing to accept the status quo, and that will undoubtedly extend to close scrutiny of how the next election plays out."
