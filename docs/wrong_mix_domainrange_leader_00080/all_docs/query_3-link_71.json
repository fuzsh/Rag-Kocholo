        "text": "ALGIERS, April 30: Algeria’s ex-Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia appeared in court as part of a corruption probe, private channel Ennahar TV reported on Tuesday.\n\nHe joined a list of powerful figures including the finance minister and several oligarchs to face judicial investigations since mass protests forced the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika this month.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from him or his lawyers. It is up to the court to decide whether there is enough evidence for him to face a formal charge and trial.\n\n“Put Ouyahia in prison,” read a banner held up as tens of protesters gathered near the court.\n\nOn Monday, Finance Minister Mohamed Loukal - a former central bank governor who only got the job from Bouteflika last month - appeared at a court as part of an investigation into suspected misuse of public funds, state TV reported.\n\nFormer police chief Abdelghani Hamel - who was sacked last year by Bouteflika for undisclosed reasons - and his son also appeared in court in Tipaza, west of the capital, as part of an investigation into “illegal activities, influence peddling, misappropriation of land and abuse of office”, state TV said.\n\nProtesters have taken to the streets since February, calling for the ousting of Bouteflika and the dismantling of the political elite that surrounded his 20-year rule.\n\nBouteflika resigned on April 2 under pressure from the army, but the protests have continued with calls for a handover to a new civilian-led government.\n\nAt least five tycoons, some of them close to Bouteflika, have been placed in custody accused of involvement in corruption scandals.\n\nAbdelkader Bensalah, head of the upper house of parliament, became interim president after Bouteflika’s departure. Presidential elections are scheduled for July 4."
