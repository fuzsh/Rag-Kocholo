The Founders

Jim Clark and Marc Andreessen developed the idea for Mosaic Communications Corporation in early 1994. They founded the company in April, and have since built a team of more than 50 employees -- half of whom are engineers. The company, which is privately held, is based in Mountain View, California -- in the heart of Silicon Valley.

Jim Clark is chairman and chief executive officer of Mosaic Communications Corporation. Prior to founding the company, Clark was chairman of Silicon Graphics, Inc., a computer systems company he founded in 1982 that now has annual revenues of $1.5 billion and is among the Fortune 500's fastest growing companies. Prior to founding Silicon Graphics, Clark was an associate professor at Stanford University, where he and a team of graduate students developed the initial technology on which Silicon Graphics was built.

Clark resigned as chairman of Silicon Graphics in February 1994 to undertake a new venture with the young programming team that created the widely-used Mosaic graphical user interface. Clark holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Utah.

Marc Andreessen is vice president of technology for Mosaic Communications. Andreessen developed the idea for the Mosaic graphical user interface in the fall of 1992 while he was an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois and a staff member at the university's National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Champaign, Illinois. He created the friendly, easy-to-use navigational tool for the Internet with a team of students and staff at NCSA in early 1993.

In his role at Mosaic Communications, Marc sets and oversees the technical direction of the company. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of Illinois in 1993.
