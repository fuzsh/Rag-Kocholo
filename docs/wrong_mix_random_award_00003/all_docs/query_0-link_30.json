My cardmaking journey started 4 years ago when I wanted to create some cards to give them to our friends when my son was born. Since then I started to search and learn more about cardmaking and I discovered the interactive cards and the lights up cards and I started to combine them to create some special cards that can make everyone’s day better. l always love to try new things and new techniques on my handmade projects and I like to introduce my engineering skills into it.

Her recent series “I❤U” combines craft and technology to explores contemporary courtship, technology, and historical signs and signifiers connected to dating and romance. Housego’s artwork often offers an invitation for interactivity, encouraging viewers to shift from passive observers to active co-producers as they engage with the digital media, experiencing other points of view, and ultimately forming their own individual meanings. Housego holds an MFA from the University of Calgary and a BFA from the Alberta University of the Arts. She has exhibited her art nationally and internationally, notably at the Art Gallery of Alberta, Edmonton, CURRENTS festival, Santa Fe New Mexico, and Curiosity Festival, Dublin, Ireland.\n\nInstagram\n\nYouTube\n\nBlog\n\nYukiko Inami\n\nHi, everyone! I’m Yukiko Inami. I live in Japan. I have three daughters and a husband. I have loved crafts, stationery goods and writing letters to friends since I was little. I started card making about 12 years ago at a volunteer group. It’s the best combination of my favorite things!! After that, I focused on it. Card making has brought many new friends and the Instagram world to me. If you have some experiences that you tried to use Chibitronics in your project and it didn’t work, we are similar. I’ll show you not only my beautiful work but also examples from my failed experiences to learn from!\n\nInstagram\n\nYouTube\n\nBlog\n\nSally Kong\n\nSally is a software engineer, artist, and educator based in Brooklyn, NY.

My name is Jessica Lin. I am a crafty gal in my late twenties, but my passion for cardmaking started a long time ago when I was 9. I was introduced to wooden stamps and I haven’t stopped stamping since. Some of my other hobbies include sewing, washi tape collaging, and I hope one day I’ll learn how to crochet, too. I grew up in Taiwan and speak Mandarin as my mother tongue, so my YouTube channel is mostly filmed in Chinese. This year, I decided to create a bilingual Instagram account. If you are inspired by bold, vibrant colors and enjoy detailed projects with lots of layers, come have a visit! I look forward to meeting and crafting with all of you!\n\nInstagram\n\nYouTube\n\nChristy Matte\n\nI’m Christy.

I am a passionate lifelong learner and creative dabbler, but I am particularly enamored with paper arts like bookbinding and marbling. I hold an M.Ed. in Technology in Education, which may help explain my habit of bringing people together to connect, learn, create, and play. I live in Massachusetts with my husband, two teens, a clingy cat, and a revolving door of foster pets.\n\nInstagram\n\nBlog\n\nMonica Moody\n\nHi, I’m Monica Moody; an artist and graphic designer living in Dallas, Texas with my husband, a couple of kids, a couple of pets, and way more than a couple of crafty interests. For me, the magic is in combining concepts and materials from multiple disciplines – the more included, the better! I especially enjoy mixing techniques and elements that may seem unusual together. For the past several years, I have worked mostly with fiber and textiles. It was actually a sewing project that led me to Chibitronics! Now I am having a blast lighting up my makes with paper (and plastic, and fabric!) circuits and LED lights. I’m excited to add more interactivity to my projects and to share ideas with you!\n\nInstagram\n\nTiktok\n\nLaura Nistal\n\nHello!
