        "text": "Number Nine Visual Technology Corp has released what it claims is the first high-resolution digital monitor and graphics accelerator aimed at the PC market. The Lexington, Massachusetts-based firm has bundled Silicon Graphics Incâ€™s 1600SW Digital Flat Panel LCD Monitor and with its Revolution IV-FP board with 32Mb of memory. The board pushes out a digitally-pure video signal that drives the 17.3-inch monitor to resolutions of up to 1600 x 1024 pixels with 16.7 million colors. Number Nine claims that competitors can only muster resolutions of around 1024 x 768. The monitor is available now, priced at $2,795. Number Nine is aiming the product at users such as financial traders and has signed up Bernard Madoff Investments as its first customer."
