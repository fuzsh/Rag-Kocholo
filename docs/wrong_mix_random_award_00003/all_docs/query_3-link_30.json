        "text": "Silicon Graphics Inc. -- known as the BMW of the computer industry for its high-quality and high-priced workstations -- is set to introduce dramatically cheaper machines Monday in an effort to reclaim business from its bargain-minded competitors.\n\nThe new line will be the first visible fruit of SGI's yearlong effort to turn around its ailing business and shake its image as a computermaker for the exclusive few.\n\nFor its customers, Silicon Graphics promises to deliver state-of-the-art graphics and design capabilities in ordinary desktop computers. The new machines -- to cost between US$3,000 and $6,000 -- will perform many of the same functions previously reserved for its $25,000 models.\n\n\"We're going to spawn a whole new set of customers who will say, 'Wow, I didn't know I could do that,'\" explained Murali Dharan, vice president of marketing at Silicon Graphics' workstation division.\n\nAlong with offering lower prices, the company hopes to attract more customers by conforming for the first time to the industry standard. The new workstations will run on Intel chips and Microsoft's Windows NT operating system.\n\n\"SGI's installed base of customers is foaming at the mouth for these things,\" said Jay Moore, an analyst for Aberdeen Group. \"It is a real coming-out party for Silicon Graphics. They've really faded into the background over the last few years.\"\n\nYears ago, the Silicon Graphics' name was synonymous with special effects and computer-generated visualization. Its workstations are still used by engineers, scientists, and artists for all sorts of simulation such as automobile design and crash tests, urban planning, animation, and other special effects.\n\nSilicon Graphics' technology was used in such films as Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump, A Bug's Life, Antz, and Prince of Egypt. But over the years, more computer makers like IBM and Hewlett-Packard figured out ways to deliver many of the same functions in far more affordable boxes."
