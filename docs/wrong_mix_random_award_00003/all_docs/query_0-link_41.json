        "text": "01\n\nMinor headwinds contributed to the mixed outcomes at premium wineries\n\nDirect-to-consumer volume and value sales were lower in 2023 and tasting room visitation dropped for the second straight year. However, strong 2023 holiday sales should improve the outlook for both.\n\n02\n\nConsumer demand for the total wine category continues its decline\n\nAs reported over the last several years, fewer U.S. consumers have been drinking wine. Instead, they have selected alternatives such as RTDs, spirits, cannabis or have been abstaining all together.\n\n03\n\nThere is an oversupply of planted vineyards given current sales volumes\n\nConditions are present for overproduction, which may lead to inventory excess, discounting and price reductions. Pressure starting from the grower will create inventory bulges and drive higher-than-needed inventory turns in 2024."
