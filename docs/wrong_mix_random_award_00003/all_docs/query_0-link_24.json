        "text": "Senior Design Clinic\n\nIn their senior year, engineering teams take part in a two-semester capstone in which they use their knowledge from engineering and liberal arts courses to solve important problems. Multi-disciplinary teams are given the opportunity to demonstrate the designs they developed in partnership with industry sponsors, non-profits and community partners. From small start-ups to the largest companies in the Twin Cities, all find value in the unique solutions and our students shine while seeing their ideas come to fruition. Outcomes for students include networking with industry organizations and professionals, practical experience through the design cycle, the confidence that comes with real experience, and sometimes even job offers or their names included on patents.\n\nThe Design Clinic culminates with the Senior Design Show a great opportunity to showcase each teamâ€™s work to family, friends, peers and industry leaders.\n\nFrom Problem to Solution\n\nOur Senior Design Clinic offers an outstanding capstone opportunity for students to communicate and interact with clients who have real needs that requires use of their skills to go from concept to design and test.\n\nSponsor a senior design project\n\nThis is an outstanding educational experience for these graduating engineers, and provides many benefits for local businesses and organizations.\n\nAll inventions and patents resulting from projects are the sole property of the sponsor. This favorable intellectual property policy brings many of our partners back year after year for fresh student ideas on their innovative project needs.\n\nTo find out more about how companies or non-profit organizations can get involved with the Senior Design Clinic at St. Thomas, reach out to Dr. Tiffany Ling (Lead Instructor) at ling1596@stthomas.edu or call our main office at (651) 962-5750."
