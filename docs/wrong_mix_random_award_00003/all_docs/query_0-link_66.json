        "text": "Rising Wildlife Leaders Manager\n\nNina Attias\n\nNina is passionate about animal conservation, with a special appreciation for armadillos, and other species considered less charismatic. She decided to become a biologist when, at 9, she learned there were people whose job was to be around animals.\n\nBorn and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Nina has a Ph.D. in Ecology and Conservation from the Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul and a master’s degree in Ecology from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. With over 15 years of experience in ecological studies and conservation initiatives, Nina has worked in most Brazilian biomes, from the Atlantic Forest to the Pantanal wetlands passing through the Cerrado savanna and the Amazon.\n\nHer post-doctoral studies at the University of Florida were focused on understanding how field ecology courses could be restructured to increase diversity among future ecologists. She transferred this knowledge to her previous role with the Giant Armadillo Conservation Program at ICAS, where she helped build a bridge between academic research and conservation practice, and developed training programs for future conservationists.\n\nDevelopment Writer\n\nEvan Burkin\n\nEvan’s two greatest passions are books and animals, which were tightly woven together in a childhood filled with Wildlife Fact-Files and works by Jack London. Since earning his BFA in Creative Writing, he has been consistently working with words for over a decade. Throughout his professional career, he has held various roles, including grant writer, copywriter, proofreader, and editor. He joins WCN after serving Chapman University for four years in a development writing role and is excited to be part of an organization actively involved in conservation efforts. While a California native, he only recently moved to the Bay Area from the southern half of the state. If he’s not reading or writing in a bookstore or coffee shop, you’ll likely find him running in Golden Gate Park.\n\nSenior Director of Marketing and Communications\n\nStephanie Carnow\n\nStephanie’s two biggest passions are telling great stories and helping animals. In 2003 she was able to bring these passions together by managing communications projects for WildAid, an organization focused on ending illegal wildlife trafficking. Inspired by this experience she went on to get her M.A. in geography, studying human-wildlife interactions in marine mammal rescue and rehabilitation. Before WCN, Stephanie was a Communications Officer at The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation where she worked on communications strategy and developed print and digital content on a variety of issues—including climate change, education, women’s empowerment, and the arts. Stephanie leads WCN’s Communications Department and is thrilled to be using her marketing and communications skills to help protect wildlife.\n\nStaff Accountant\n\nJulie Carrasco\n\nJulie has been passionate about the natural world since childhood. She grew up raising birds and cats in Michigan and has been integrating wildlife into her glass sculpture and textile pieces as a fine artist in the Bay Area and Washington state. She joined WCN in September, 2022, bringing experience as a bookkeeper for independent artists and an accountant in the nonprofit sector.
