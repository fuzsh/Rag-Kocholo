We consider alumni from our Center as past students of OSU who contributed to our community spending time in our spaces as graduate research assistants, as team members on ACCAD projects, taking courses, and/ or doing creative research as part of their masters thesis or doctoral dissertation studies. Many of these alumni completed graduate degrees in affiliated programs such as Design, Dance, Theatre, Art, Computer Science Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and more.\n\nBelow is an alphabetical listing of alumni. Many below were involved in the earliest days of ACCAD's history (e.g. CGRG). Read more about the history of ACCAD's early years.
