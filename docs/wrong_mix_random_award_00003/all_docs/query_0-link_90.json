Her passion for working with the officers and professionals who dedicate their lives to serving their communities stems from a deep family history of service in law enforcement, public safety, and the military.\n\nAfter serving as Director of Programs in Executive Education at Stanford University, and then as a consultant to business and education organizations, in 2015, she took a leap of faith–quitting her job to take a year off, recover from Silicon Valley-style burnout, and a 20-year career in strategy, marketing, communications, and business development, working alongside executives from leading global technology companies, and start-ups. Her first action was to attend Compassion Cultivation Training™ at Stanford; it was transformational, and she was hooked! And so began a career redirection to align with her personal passion to be of service to those who serve.\n\nIn parallel, Julie has pursued contemplative studies and healing practices for more than 20 years. She completed a year of French and Italian at University College London, then with an eye towards entrepreneurship, switched to earn a B.A. Business Studies and French from the University of Westminster.\n\nJulie is grateful to fulfill her dream to focus on supporting the well-being of people who endure high-stress workplaces.

Among the many great roles over the years, she had the pleasure of managing grants and programming at the American Medical Student Association (AMSA) Foundation in support of medical and pre-medical students across the globe who sought out supplementary learning and leadership opportunities outside of their medical schools. For ten years before joining Compassion Institute, Shari served as a regional director of operations in a state government Department of Social Services leading and supporting hundreds of employees working to assist families. Prior to her current role as program director, Shari served as CI’s senior program manager, Health and Systems Transformation.\n\nShari holds her Bachelor of Arts from the University of California, Berkeley with a double major in social welfare and dramatic arts and her Master of Business Administration from George Mason University.
