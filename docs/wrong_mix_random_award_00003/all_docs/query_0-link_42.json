With lots of love, training and hard work, he has grown into a very calm and mature dog - though he does still like to be a bit mischievous.\n\nPhryne\n\nChief Engineer, Adventures\n\nPhryne, named for a character from Australian television, is a cattle dog/Catahoula mix who enjoys ADVENTURES. At Khan Academy, she heads up our Washington Bureau, leading teammates on long excursions into Rock Creek Park, from the Capitol Ruins to Peirce Mill. Possessed of inexhaustible energy, she always wants to explore, encouraging our learners and her reports to push themselves to discover new things and places.\n\nIn addition to running through the woods, exploring D.C., and barking at lobbyists, Phryne enjoys the art of the snug, and is learning to play what she thinks is football. She would love to meet you.\n\nShadow\n\nPurr Programmer\n\nShadow works with Nick at Khan Academy as a purr programmer. Shadow also ensures sustainable working practices through investing in breaks that involve lots of petting or playing a game of chase the laser.\n\nShadow models excellent sustainable behavior by thinking through hard problems with a good nap followed by a casual stroll around the house.\n\nSmokey\n\nChief Purrformance Analyst\n\nSmokey is Khan Academy’s Chief Purrformance Analyst, making sure that laps stay warm and treats get eaten. When he’s not making conference call cameos, he’s sleeping on the bed, sleeping on the window seat, or sitting perfectly still in Lilli’s lap as she’s working, happy to keep her company as she codes.\n\nIn his spare time, he likes to chase strings and beg for snacks. If he’s feeling ultra-mellow, you can find him sitting quietly, keeping an ever-watchful, unflagging eye on the snack drawer. A stoic fella in his older years, he will gladly welcome pets from anyone, any time, hardly moving an inch from wherever he may be lazing, and never, ever scratching or biting.\n\nZacy\n\nZacian Valdez\n\nTrainer\n\nZacy, Napper and Foot Warmer. Zacy is a master of snoozing and snuggling, and never misses a chance to join Elly, our content creator, at her desk. She is also a fan of Pokemon, and was named after the legendary Zacian. She enjoys long walks, car rides, and exploring new places, like Pikes Peak, where she posed for this epic photo."
