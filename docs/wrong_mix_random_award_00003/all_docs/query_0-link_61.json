To illustrate, I will describe the work I have been doing in the life sciences, and in the defense and intelligence world, helping people glue their data and machines together. One key ingredient is to build good definitions (good for people, good for machines). Examples: How to define system? Or engineered system? Or cyberphysical system? And then what, finally, are the Implications for the manufacturing industry?\n\nBiography:\n\nBarry Smith is a prominent contributor to both theoretical and applied research in ontology. He is SUNY Distinguished Professor of Philosophy in the University at Buffalo, with joint appointments in the Departments of Biomedical Informatics, Neurology, and Computer Science and Engineering. He is also Director of the National Center for Ontological Research.\n\nSmith is the author of some 300 peer-reviewed publications on ontology and related topics, with over 29,500 citations. His research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the US, Swiss and Austrian National Science Foundations, the Volkswagen Foundation, the European Union, and the US Department of Defense. He received the $2.7 million Wolfgang Paul Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 2002.

The remarkable capabilities of responsiveness, reconfigurability, and sustainability of seru production are introduced. We present production systems with a focus on the relationships between product supply and customer demand in the context of Industry 2.0-4.0. One driver of production evolution is changes in customer demand over time, which is categorised into several dimensions. Major production systems - flow line, Toyota production system (TPS), job shop, cell flexible manufacturing system and seru - have been developed and applied to supplies to match different demand dimensions over time. Comparisons between seru with TPS and cell are given. The possibilities of a future smart factory equipped with internet of things (IoT) are discussed. The demand dimensions of Industy 4.0, the product architecture change in the automobile industry (e.g., from integral to modular), and the impact of 3D printing are elaborated. The research opportunities of seru production in the context of Industry 4.0 are presented.\n\nBiography:\n\nYong Yin is a professor of Graduate School of Business, Doshisha University, Japan.
