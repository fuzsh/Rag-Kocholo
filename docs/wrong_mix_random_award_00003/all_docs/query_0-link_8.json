        "text": "This week marks the beginning of a thrilling family adventure as we set out to climb Mount Olympus. Excited to introduce the kids to their first taste of technical climbing and I cannot wait to see their smiling faces when they reach the summit. A year ago, I embarked on another personal 'mountain' challenge - launching a company aimed at revolutionizing the industry. With just two weeks until the big launch, I am proud to lead an exceptional 'A Team' driven by expertise and a profound sense of social responsibility. As we gear up for our US launch, we are seeking Sales and Marketing leaders based in Colorado to join our mission. If you align with our values and vision, please reach out to me or Julia Vaninger for more details. At DioniLife, we are committed to becoming the global leader in adult alcohol-free drinks that are not only better for you, but also for the world. Our team embodies diversity, innovation, and a deep passion for making a positive impact. Join us on this extraordinary journey as we redefine the industry together. #DioniLife #NowHiring #SalesandMarketing #ColoradoOpportunity\n\nTime away from work and, more importantly, time with family is always a period of reflection for me. This year’s trip to the Northern Amazon was no different. Fortunately, the time was filled with laughter, gratitude, and appreciation despite some expected challenges. Thanks to my Royal Marine Commando training, I can’t help but want to expose my children to the elements. My exposure to difficult situations has shaped me and helped me through life’s many tribulations. Therefore, I want to give them the gift of resiliency that can only be earned through experience. To that end, we embarked on an epic journey through the Northern Amazon that brought rain, mud, hunger, blisters, and a few dicey situations. While I may have questioned my decision once or twice, what struck me was that my children never did. They remained focused and determined with belief in our mission. Of course, this led me to reflect on business leadership. I am more certain than ever that what matters is mission led leadership, that is cause related and steeped in gratitude. Gratitude for the privilege of being in a position to lead and create change; gratitude for the organisations that work to positively impact the world; and gratitude for the employees that get us there. On a personal level, I am grateful for the privilege of exciting travel experiences, for my children’s faith in our mission and of course, my wife, Krissi, who holds us all together. The trip was one for the memory books that I know will stay with us. Now, it’s time to put these lessons to work, without any compromises."
