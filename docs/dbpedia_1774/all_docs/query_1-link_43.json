His energy, his history as a university presi- dent, and his extensive range of Washington-based experience augured well. But GW was a large and complex university with a daunting array of schools and constituen- cies - from the President of the United States to the most impoverished city residents. To say that President Trachtenberg has validated our hopes is to understate. The report that follows highlights a range of accomplishments that would justify a life- time of effort, but in fact represents a single decade of heartfelt dedication. It is diffi- cult for any member or friend of our University community not to be gratified - indeed, thrilled - by these triumphs. Not the least of President Trachtenberg’s accomplishments has been to demon- strate, over and over again, that intelligence and hard work can operate in tandem with humor and fun. He can make a room laugh in the midst of discussing the most difficult and serious issue. He is a role model for the notion that work and play need not be antitheses. And who can fail to smile - and be educated - when a brief note to our president draws a three- or four-page reply that is nothing less than a “grand tour of the subject,” filled with humor and insight? It is typical of GW’s leader that he has turned a bronze hippopotamus into a symbol of the academy. We thank you, Stephen Joel Trachtenberg, and look forward to lots, lots more. John D. Zeglis Chairman, The Board of Trustees The George Washington University 2 The George Washington University The University We Have In Common J ohn Zeglis’ overly generous appreciation moved me deeply when I read it - and was closely followed by some moments of self-scrutiny. Since my arrival on campus in the summer of 1988, I have been so immersed in the interactive position of University President that I have seldom had time to con- sider whether I was in fact a “leader” or a “follower.” What I saw around me then was a school whose formidable presence testi- fied to the devotion of those who founded it, those who nurtured it in its progress through the 19th century, and those who built it, literally and figura- tively, as it moved through the dramatic years of the 20th century. Events of global magnitude, as they impacted on Washington, impacted - it goes without saying - on GW as well. The work of my predecessor, President Lloyd H. Elliott, had brought the University to a level of stature and stability that many other schools of higher education could envy. But as I began my systematic exploration of the campus, a thought kept nagging at my inward spirit: “This place looks, this place feels, as if it’s just about to take off.” The energies I sensed among GW’s faculty, its administra- tors, its staff members, and its students seemed to cry out for a new expression of some kind. And slowly but surely the conclusion took shape in my mind: The devoted labors of more than a century had built a university infrastructure whose peak was nowhere in sight. As much as any other university I had ever scrutinized, GW was an emblem of possibility, and a dramatic channel for ambition. So my “grand strategy” as GW’s president quickly became one of attentive and responsive enthusiasm. I saw myself, if you will, as a gardener of sorts, clearing the way for impulses of growth, and for the flowering of my academic 1997 President's Report 3 and administrative colleagues. And I, most of all, was astonished by the results. Enthusiasm soon developed into deserved confidence. As those at GW grew accustomed to its new levels of national and international recognition, good ideas multiplied on a campus-wide basis. And at a time when all academic insti- tutions were becoming increasingly cost-conscious, the need to fully justify even a modest expenditure of funds seemed not to interfere with individual creativity and the power of innovation. Today, we have grown used to the idea that GW is a role model for American higher education. Its concern for its community - the District of Columbia - smoothly coexists with its mission of intellectual and scholarly accomplishment. The University welcomes students from every part of our country and nearly every nation of our planet. Even a glance at our achieve- ments suggests that those affiliated with GW perceive the University as a medium for their own careers and their own endeavors. In the pages that follow, you will find more than “a glance.” We offer for your review a portfolio that commemorates GW’s present moment, as we all approach a new century and a new millennium. What GW will grow into as this new period in human history develops is in some ways uncertain. What seems definite, however, is that its future growth will be even more impressive than its past development. To turn each new ceiling into a platform, to rethink all past accomplishments in the quest for new ones, to remain sensitive to global needs without losing sight of regional and local responsibilities - this can be called, without exaggeration, the spirit of The George Washington University. I am very proud to be its president and to serve in that office as GW moves toward the ful- fillment of its destiny. { concluded on page 24} 4 The George Washington University STUDENT LIFE To say that students come first in all of our thinking at GW may seem like a truism. But in a nation so deeply con- cerned with postsecondary education, and with classroom teaching in particu- The \"student cycle\" never seems more complete to me than at the time when our upperclassmen play their roles in the admissions process as Student Admissions Representatives. Here we see one of them phoning congratulations to a newly admitted high school senior. lar, that which is obvious may also need articulation. I myself cannot cross the GW campus without noticing the enthusiasm on the faces of the students I pass. Meanwhile, the steady growth in the number of applications received by GW from potential students suggests that the relentlessness of our attention to student life is receiving a more- than-ample reward. Architecture \"makes\" a campus in one sense, but students bring architecture to life as well as life to architecture. Together, they are the \"GW scene.\" GW's Solar Car has ranked as a student accomplishment of the first order ever since it won the 1996 World Solar Rally in Akita, Japan, defeating world-class competition. GW's Colonial Inauguration has earned high praise as an orienta- tion experience for new students and their families. I regularly get mail telling me how valuable it is. 1997 President's Report 5 The University's powerful commitment to the District of Columbia is summed up by the 21st Century Scholars Program, which provides full, four-year scholarships to out- standing graduates of Washington's public high schools. Joy + warmth + smiles 4- occasional enthusiastic shouts = Commencement Day, of course. Turning the GW campus into a garden of flowers can be justified in all kinds of ways. But for me, the sight of a student drinking in knowledge amid an explosion of color and fragrance is a sight that's self-sustaining! These law students started out in Eastern Europe and ended up at The George Washington University. Programs like the one that brought them here are among the reasons our name is known around the globe. 6 The George Washington University FACULTY ACCOMPLISHMENTS When a university faculty reaches out in as many directions as GW's, and its achievements are regularly noted in the print and electronic as well as the scholarly media, a presi- dent can indeed be proud. Yes, our faculty members are per- vasively active and committed people. Yes, they take both teaching and research with the highest degree of serious- ness. And yes, they make good use of their Washington base — not least in studying the District of Columbia itself, which sums up so many of the challenges facing urban America today. Above all, GW's faculty is characterized by a strong commitment to scholarship and teaching. The caps and gowns are eternally quaint. But among the characteristics that distinguish GW's faculty mem- bers is their immersion in the scholarly here-and-now as well as their dedication to University service. Former history professor and associate dean Peter Hill, now the University Historian, was recognized for this with the Trachtenberg Prize for University Service in 1995. Lilien Robinson (left) represents the study of art history at GW. She also represents her fellow teachers and scholars in her role as chairperson of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee. James M. Clark is GW's Ronald B. Weintraub Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences. The number of endowed chairs and professorships at GW has risen since 1 988 from 30 to 60. 1997 President's Report 7 Steve Roberts, formerly a senior editor at U.S. News & World Report, started out at GW as a visiting pro- fessor. He is now our J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Professor of Media and Public Affairs. W. Burlette Carter is an associate professor of law who teaches Evidence and Civil Procedure. She is also the chair-elect of the Association of American Law Schools' section on Law and Sports. A common remark heard from visi- tors to GW is that they \"see all these famous people on the cam- pus.\" Many of them are teaching here. A recent example was former South Dakota Senator George McGovern. Carl Stern, when he was my fellow student at Columbia, seemed des- tined to accomplish some notable things in his life. One of them turned out to be the position of J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Professor of Journalism at GW! The George Washington University James O. Horton, professor of American history and civilization at GW, has been awarded a Trachtenberg Prize in recogni- tion of his excellent teaching, and has been selected by the Carnegie Foundation as CASE Professor of the Year for the District of Columbia. FACULTY ACCOMPLISHMENTS James Starrs is a professor of law and forensic sciences. His specialty is that of a \"detective.\" He uses modern technology and personal skill to uncover literally buried facts relating to previously unsolved investigations. In addition to serving as an associate profes- sor in GW's School of Engineering and Applied Science, C. Dianne Martin is presi- dent of the Recreational Software Advisory Council. In terms of nationwide professorial pay scales, GW now ranks with \"Research I\" universities, enabling us to attract and retain the best scholars and teachers. Susan Tolchin is a professor of pub- lic administration in the School of Business and Public Management. In addition to publishing her most recent, well-received book, The Angry American, she is an expert on global markets. 1997 President's Report 9 The electronic influence in modern higher education is neatly symbol- ized by the GWizard Kiosks on campus, which enable students to call up, instantly, all kinds of infor- mation that is relevant to their status and studies. TECHNOLOGY'S GROWING INFLUENCE There is a sense in which all of our schools of higher edu- cation, and many primary and secondary schools as well, are engaged in a kind of \"technology race.\" Increasingly, they base much of their appeal on references to fiber-optic cable and computer terminals. But as the internal deliber- GW now routinely attracts its \"first choice\" in faculty searches. Having been drawn to GW by a search of this kind, Dean Harry Harding of the Elliott School of International Affairs now helps to administer comparable procedures for those seeking faculty positions. Alison Brooks' renown as an anthropologist has earned her a Trachtenberg Prize in Scholarship as well as a fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies. One response to our nation's growing interest in distance education: GW's Distance Learning Lab. Here, Assistant Vice President Ted Christensen demonstrates this state-of-the-art multimedia studio. The lab permits students and guests from around the world to interact — live — with students and fac- ulty on campus. ations of such schools make clear, the profoundest techno- logical effort is the struggle for balance rather than an effort to simply \"add\" technology. 10 The George Washington University GW's Institute for Magnetics Research regularly makes use of laser technology. THE PURSUIT OF KNOWLEDGE Quite a few books and articles have been writ- ten on the relationship between good teaching and good research. What they boil down to is that a teacher who communicates with students on the subject of the \"knowledge frontier\" in his or her field should be well-acquainted with that frontier. This presumes that he or she is actively digging into the tumultuous world of Katherine Kennedy, professor of pharmacology in the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, specializes in cancer research. possibility just beyond current settled wisdom on the subjects being taught in the classroom. There is much about the District of Columbia that favors the dialectical relationship between teaching and research. Billions of dollars in federal appropriations or federal cutbacks may be rooted in what scholars have determined to be a new and sometimes unexpected truth. GW's Virginia Campus houses high-tech research equipment used by University faculty and students. The test shown above is being con- ducted in the campus' Center for Structural Dynamics Research. Team members doing National Crash Analysis Center research demonstrate how they digitize vehicles in order to prepare them for computer modeling and simu- lation of crash tests. 1997 President's Report 11 At GW, our concern with student life and faculty accom- plishments dovetails with our determination to sustain GW's traditional book-centered libraries. They must be places that are easily available at convenient hours — and places that use information technology to make their hold- ings as accessible as possible. LIBRARIES One of our proudest additions to Gelman Library is its 24-Hour Reading Room, which can meet the needs of even those students whose minds work best between three and four in the morning. An enduring legacy from GW benefactor Jacob Burns is the Law School library named in his honor. As a university president, I am eternally torn between two thoughts on the subject of GW's capital endowment: How hard we all must work in order to keep it growing (which in turn enables the University to keep developing), and how grateful we are to the donors who have facilitated \"the GW miracle.\" THE SUBJECT IS MONEY As a GW student and later as a faculty member, Robert L. Weintraub dedicated his career and his life to the University. Endowments from him and his wife, Frances — who also graduated from GW — have had an enormous impact on the advancement of our Biological Sciences Department. The trustees of the J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Trust, when they gathered for this photograph, were smiling with good reason. The Shapiro Trust is one of the largest bene- factors in the University's history. When I had my picture taken with the late Jacob Burns, my pleased expression was a comment on his significant contributions to the development of the University, and our law school in particular. His benevolence included the Jacob Burns Law Library, the Jacob Burns Fellowships, and the Jacob Burns Legal Clinics. 12 The George Washington University lt # s not enough to say that GW is in Washington, and that it's concerned about Washington. During the past decade, we've made a major effort to bring Washington into GW — our Ambassadors Lecture Series being just one example. In this photograph, Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador to the United States, converses with GW faculty and students. The presence of world-renowned figures like First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton draws GW students into the Washington scene. Students thus are able to see a meaningful connection between their classroom work and the world stage on which they will be pursuing their own careers. GLOBAL FOR SUBSTANCE NTERSECTION AND STYLE When U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala appears on campus, her remarks influence those teaching and studying in every field from medicine and law to public management and communications. The ancient and now outmoded concept of the \"Ivory Tower\" was a way of summing up a university's removal from mundane concerns. Today at GW we are far more aware of just how complex a relationship there is between aca- demic concerns and \"the world out there.\" This point is made on an everyday basis by the many national and international figures who appear in our classrooms and lecture halls. The sheer liveliness of the University owes much to their presence. Distinguished Visiting Scholar Marvin Kalb, seen here in GW's Dorothy Betts Marvin Theatre as he conducts a televised \"Kalb Report,\" is one of the major journalists/scholars who has formed an ongoing connection with GW. 1997 President's Report 13 President Bill Clinton came to GW's Lisner Auditorium in August 1996 to deliver a speech decrying terrorism and announcing new measures to reduce its threat. We shared a moment of good humor when I was in the process of introducing him. GW has served as the host site for major policy addresses, including one by Vice President Al Gore at the Conference on Climate Action in 1994. The George Washington University Hospital received global attention when it helped to save President Ronald Reagan's life follow- ing an assassination attempt. On the tenth anniversary of that occasion, the former president and Mrs. Reagan returned to the GW campus. Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic received the University's first President's Medal in 1993. We created the President's Medal to honor the achievements of outstanding individuals. 14 The George Washington University GW's 175th Anniversary Convocation featured, among others, tennis great Martina Navratilova, who received an honorary degree. When the Bush-Gorbachev Summit was held in 1 990, GW served as the Press Center for the occasion, with the Charles E. Smith Center transformed into its headquarters. Secretary of State James Baker, seen in this photograph, was one of those who addressed the assembled journalists. When Abba Eban, former Ambassador of Israel and J.B. and Maurice C. Shapiro Professor of International Affairs at GW, held a dialogue with Walter Cronkite, it exemplified what soon became a \"typical GW occasion.\" Among those who have taken part in GW's Ambassadors Lecture Series was Ambassador Eduardo MacGillycuddy of Uruguay, who spoke in 1993. 1997 President's Report 15 Having done so well as the Press Center for the Bush-Gorbachev Summit, GW was cho- sen to serve as the Press Center for the 1 992 Clinton/Gore Inauguration. George Stephanopoulos is shown answering ques- tions from reporters. GLOBAL INTERSECTION FOR SUBSTANCE AND STYLE More recently, Bill Cosby addressed the University's graduating students on Commencement Day, 1997. He is shown here embracing our Graduate School of Education and Human Development Dean Mary Hatwood Futrell. True to its reputation as a school that creatively blends historical with contemporary perspectives, GW bestowed an honorary degree on Larry King at its 175th Anniversary Convocation. When Mikhail Gorbachev delivered an address at GW in 1997, our stu- dents crowded into Lisner Auditorium to hear him. I am very proud of the University's reputation as a school where history truly comes alive. 16 The George Washington University At GW, our program of maintenance, renova- tion, and new construction has been one of the most ambitious in American higher edu- cation. If we think of the campus as a plat- form for the launching of intellectual accom- plishment, we will understand why so much effort has gone into making that platform as solid and as beautiful as possible. THE BLOOMING OF AN URBAN CAMPUS Where the University's physi- cal facilities are concerned, an ambitious program of maintenance and improve- ment is now the order of the day. It has made GW a more attractive place while also serving the needs of both fac- ulty members and students. Seen in the photograph is Lisner Auditorium, a major, newly renovated facility for campus events. GW's new residence hall is often described in terms of \"unexpected glory.\" Not only does it reverse a current axiom about American higher education — that \"the days of new residence halls ended half a century ago\" — but it has added to the campus a handsome and beautifully proportioned building whose interior spaces are equally attractive. Where exactly to have lunch or din- ner is a question that confronts not only students and faculty members but every visitor to the GW campus. One solution: the Marvin Center's J Street cafes. And for those living in the new GW residence hall, fully equipped kitchens will be as tempting as any restaurant. 1997 President's Report 17 Here's a challenge that many people would find rather daunting: Take a university that prides itself on being in the very center of our nation's capital and provide it with its own sense of geographical identity. Well, we're trying! This photograph shows the new University gateway at Washington Circle, completed in 1997. Members of the GW family sometimes need help with their families. This, in turn, has led the University to arrange for the presence near campus of a Bright Horizons Children's Center. Other corners of the campus fea- ture dramatic busts of George Washington, like this one. Visitors to GW, as they approach the nearby Metro station, just happen to pass through the University's Eye Street Park. We hope that GW will be associated in their minds forever with flowers and trees. In 1996, a historic move broad- ened the scope of the University and its campus when GW and Mount Vernon College for Women announced their affiliation. 18 The George Washington University Professors Gate is a very recent addition to the GW campus. It has symbolic as well as literal value, summing up the transitions through which students pass at the University. THE BLOOMING OF AN URBAN CAMPUS One of our goals at GW has been to give it the kinds of landmarks that help to organize one's perceptions of the campus. The Gelman Clock is a good example. Facilities like the outdoor basketball courts help our students lead balanced and satisfying lives. The computer lab at the Law School is one example of the University's electronic facili- ties. A program now under way is aimed at developing a digital infrastructure that will meet our students' needs well into the 21st century. 1997 President's Report 19 \"Outreach\" has several meanings at GW, resulting from University programs at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Seen in this photograph: Yolanda King addressing the Martin Luther King Convocation in 1994. REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY \"Outreach\" also connotes GW's ongoing efforts to develop posi- tive relationships with its Foggy Bottom neighbors. Here, Vice President Louis Katz and I are seen conversing with neighbor- hood residents one evening after a community meeting. Since 1988, GW has enhanced its longstanding relation- ship with the Washington, D.C., community. Students par- ticipate in outreach efforts, through internship programs, community legal and medical clinics, and individual involvement on the part of scores of students who clean up neighborhoods, plant trees, build houses, and other- wise volunteer their time to make their temporary home- town a better place for all the residents of the capital city. The University's United Way cam- paign has achieved a sterling repu- tation. For more than 10 years, GW has received the United Way University Award for being \"at the top of the class\" among District of Columbia universities. When GW became a \"Green University,\" our agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency expressed GW's concern with regard to our planet and its future. This photograph shows me listening to remarks by EPA Administrator Carol Browner. This visit with Maudine Cooper of the Washington Urban League, where I serve on the board of directors, reflects GW's keen involvement in all aspects of the District's life. 20 The George Washington University SPIRIT GW's men's basketball teams have enjoyed winning seasons for the past six years. Students are pleased and sometimes exhilarated as GW — now a \"player\" in intercollegiate athletics — continues to work toward winning championships. Those who visit GW often comment on the great enthusi- asm they encounter. And — why not? Those who work and study at GW are, arguably, in one of the world's loveliest cities. World-class art, music, and sports of all kinds are always close at hand. Luminaries from the worlds of politics, entertainment, and the arts are frequent visitors to campus. Then there is the almost miracle rebirth of GW sports. Finally, a student's GW experience is capped on commencement day with a festive celebration on the Ellipse between the White House and the Washington Monument. It just doesn't get any better than this. Coach Mike Jarvis tunes up his team. Men's basketball, is shown here in a photo that sums up the \"sense of striving\" that has become synonymous with GW itself. 1997 President's Report 21 School spirit received a major boost from our 175th Anniversary cele- bration, which brought home to us that GW is the product of efforts dating back to the presidency of James Monroe. In this photograph, taken at the anniversary year's Opening Convocation, I join in applauding our splendid school. When I found myself sitting beside the Clintons at a GW basketball game, I couldn't escape the thought: \"This would be a nice one to win.\" We did! It's becoming harder and harder to remember a time when GW students had less to cheer about than these basketball fans. As women's basketball takes on greater national prominence, GW's team is ready for attention. In the past year, the Colonial women went to the NCAA \"Elite Eight.\" 22 The George Washington University SPIRIT When GW held its 1 75th Anniversary party, a birthday cake was, of course, part of the festivities. Union Station is big enough for the biggest GW parties — and a setting worthy of the University's present stature. Union Station in Washington is a monument that often strikes people as reminiscent of ancient Rome. It has also become the site for monumental GW events like our night-before- Commencement celebration. When I donated it to the University, I didn't expect the buzz that would be created by our new bronze Hippo. Even the Washington Post took notice of this new addition to our campus. Meanwhile, the Hippo seems to be finding its way into \"campus culture.\" The University's connections with George Washington represent a \"force in their own right.\" In addi- tion to its name and its bronze busts, GW keeps up the connec- tion on special occasions like its 175th Anniversary. Here, a lantern lighted at Washington's home — Mount Vernon — begins its trip to the campus. 1997 President's Report 23 When I'm not shoveling out my in-box and answering my phone-calls, I try hard to \"get myself out.\" Students, I learn again and again, have a lot to teach me. THE PRESIDENT AS UNIVERSITY EVERYMAN GW's new campus in Northern Virginia has added an enormous amount to the life of the University, including several programs that are unique to its campus. Half a century ago, university presidents often looked like distant captains on the bridge of an ocean liner. You knew they were there, but it wasn't often that you met them in the boiler room. Today, the job has undergone a sea change. University presidents are highly visible and mobile, both on campus and, indeed, around the world — looking after the University's interests at home and abroad. When a newspaper or TV station wants to sum GW up in a single image, the camera's lens is sometimes aimed at me. But that, thank heaven, is only an image. The job of a university president requires teamwork on the part of a university-wide staff. I'm aided, advised, and supported by such people as Vice President Walter Bortz (left) and Mike Peller (center), then director of the Smith Center. The three of us are seen here as we inspect the Bush-Gorbachev Press Center at GW's Smith Center. The theme appears more and more often in the academic media: today's member of a university's board of trustees is expected to be an activist and a participator rather than a figurehead. In this photo, I am on the Ellipse celebrating our Commencement with the chairman of our Board of Trustees, John Zeglis, (right) and D.C. Councilman Frank Smith. A question that every school of higher education must face: Are alumni children and grandchildren coming? Which in turn explains my pleasure at conversing with alumna Sandra Holley, whose son is now a GW undergraduate. 24 The George Washington University In the preceeding pages, my own running commentary has been kept to a minimum, so as to interfere as little as possible with what adds up to a “vision” of GW today. I hope that vision provides you with as much pleasure as it has given me! The city of Washington is too seldom thought of as a “university town,” though it contains - and is surrounded by - its share of academic institutions. But what this year’s annual report conveys, I hope, is that GW has created, just a few blocks from the White House, a campus that is fully urban and yet the very opposite of ugly. In care of design, in assiduity of main- tenance, it makes the very best of its location. Meanwhile, everything that meets the eye is in the service of an “academic engine” that continues to pro- vide the world with first-rate education, first-rate research, and a spectrum of important services. In my private moments, I often think of GW as a kind of symphony. So many separate instruments still collude in the creation of an overriding musical idea. We are part of it. We help to shape it. And what we have shaped then plays a role in what we ourselves become. May this marriage of architecture and function continue to work for centuries to come! Stephen Joel Trachtenberg President and Professor of Public Administration 1997 President's Report 25 STUDENT AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT SERVICES There is no question that GW today, through the investment of significant human and finan- cial resources, has energized itself into a more mature, preferred, and dynamic institution than had been in place in 1988. The George Washington University has had an insatiable desire during the Trachtenberg era to reach its full potential. Student and Academic Support Services has contributed to improving GW’s external reputation and the quality of the overall life expe- rience of our students. Our unit is making headway by increasing productivity, expanding pro- grams and services, and reshaping the priority of work and focus within student affairs, enrollment management, and athletics to sustain the momentum of instilling pride, quality, and satisfaction within the University community. The following is a look at where we are now, contrasted at times with our status in 1988, to show how far we have come. ADMISSIONS For the first time in the University’s history, the admit rate will be 49 percent — finally breaking the 50 percent barrier. Our acceptance rate for the entering class of 2001 is significantly lower than the admit rate of 78 percent in 1988. Furthermore, our freshman class represents all 50 states and is comprised of 50 valedictorians. Not to be overlooked was the most fortunate occurrence, which happened late in September 1996 when students were selecting schools to which they wanted to apply. In LJ.S. News & World Report’s 1996 college ranking edition, GW moved upward to the number 46 slot in the first tier rankings for national universities. ADMISSIONS FY 1988 FY 1997 High School Visits: States visited 18 40 Schools visited 249 1,176 Students seen 1,782 5,982 College Programs: States covered 22 40 Programs attended 171 359 Students seen 10,193 27,797 Notes: • Interestingly, during the last 10 years, the average number of students seen at a high school visit declined from seven students per visit in 1988 to five students per visit in 1997. This decrease has been influenced by the attempt of high schools to restrict students from being excused from class for such visits. High schools have, therefore, relied more heavily on college pro- grams in order for students to meet with college repre- sentatives. Thus, we have seen an increase in the aver- age number of students we see at college programs from 60 in 1988 to 78 in 1997. The Alumni Admissions Program has been in existence for more than 10 years. In 1988, we had 291 partici- pants in 35 states, in 1997, we had over 900 participants in 45 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as in 12 countries outside the United States. FY 1988 FY 1997 Inquiries 33,687 80,969 Applications 6,389 12,408* Percentage of applicants accepted 78% 49% Registered full-time freshmen 1,056 1,690 Notes: • Prior to the opening of the Visitor’s Center in 1989, group information sessions and tours were conducted from the second floor of Rice Hall. Because of limited space, visitors were required to schedule their appoint- ments and would be turned away during peak periods. Since the opening of the Visitor’s Center, we have been able to do away with the scheduling of appointments, have expanded our visitor capacity to 100 students per group session, and have increased the number of Sat- urdays that we welcome visitors. \" Reflects applications received in 1977 for Fall 1977 admittance. ( continued on following page) 26 The George Washington University Climbing into the rankings of the nation’s top 50 universities certainly has been the proper exclamation point to a banner year in the University’s history. A record number of applications (more than 12,400) were received during the past year, which will result in a freshman class of approximately 1,700 students. This is quite an increase from 1988, when we received 6,389 applications. The freshman applicant pool, as well as the committed pool, represents a more diverse popu- lation. To date, it appears that 23 percent of GW’s population will be made up of students from ethnic minority groups, an increase of 11 percent from 1988. A portion of the increase in applications was a result of an elevation in international applications. This growth allowed us to admit higher quality international students. The freshman applicant pool was also of a stronger caliber, which ultimately resulted in the highest quality ever for the entering freshman class. The percentage of freshmen in the top 10 percent of their class increased from 22 percent in 1988 to 45 percent in 1997, and students in the top 20 percent of their class rose from 41 percent in 1988 to 77 percent in 1997. The combined SAT average increased, and the number of national merit finalists, national achievement finalists, and national Hispanic scholars climbed from six in 1988 to 59 in 1997. STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GW’s ability to be a “hot” school enabled us to control the student financial aid expenditures while reaching our enrollment goals. Since the 1994-95 academic year when our discount rate was running 41.1 percent, preliminary indications are that we will end this fiscal year slightly below 36.5 percent. Our efforts have been successful in bringing the discount rate below the recommendations set by the Board of Trustees, while at the same time experiencing an increase in the academic quality of our freshman class. Total financial aid expenditures, including federal funds, were $21.6 million in 1988, and $95.2 million in 1997. The average GW merit award this year was $7,455, compared with $4,423 in 1988, and the average need-based award was $9,965, compared with 1988’s $4,984. In 1988, we had 2,899 freshman visitors, compared to 13,678 in 1997. These numbers do not include the number of special groups that visit us each year. • The Student Admissions Representative (STAR) Pro- gram has been of great assistance in helping the Uni- versity to manage the increased admissions activity. In 1988, the number of students volunteering for the STAR Program numbered 60; in 1997, the number of volunteers increased to 120. • We continued to offer a special spring visit program for admitted students. In 1988, we saw 673 students of which 65 percent deposited. In 1997, 924 students attended (an all-time high), with a yield continuing to be 65 percent. • Interviews for freshmen, both on and off campus, were first offered in 1995. In 1997, we interviewed 1,079 students. Also, we hosted 117 applicants in our overnight host program. • In 1988, we were on a rolling admission schedule with an application deadline of February 1. Most application files were completed in March and April. In 1997, we had a two-part application and a single decision date; and most freshman files were completed by February 1. Also, early decision was not offered in 1988. In 1997, early decision accounted for approxi- mately 15 percent of our projected entering class.

More students were accommodated in the residence halls than ever before. New Hall, our new “ground-up” apartment-style residence hall, houses approximately 440 students, allowing GW to accommodate 56.9 percent of our undergraduate students in residence halls. For those students who make the choice to live off campus, GW provides the Off-Campus Housing Resource Center, which in 1988 was a modest walk-in service providing maps and a list of apartments. The center’s services have expanded and include 10 computer terminals foi students to conduct computerized searches for off-campus accommodations. During the last aca- demic year at the time of the writing of this report, students made 2,542 contacts for off-campus rentals. Student and Academic Support Services continued taking a leadership role in efforts to develop a sense of campus community among students, and to visibly demonstrate the University s commitment to being a “good neighbor” in the District of Columbia. The Office of Commu- nity Service in 1997 involved more than 575 students each semester who participated in 95 projects. Their volunteerism amounted to more than 75,000 hours of service to more than 25,000 District of Columbia residents. Campus Life has also been more aggressive in gaining grants to support outreach efforts. In 1997, more than $210,000 in grants had been awarded to support community service and acad- emic service-learning programs on campus. The Office of Community Service currently engages 20 faculty members in six colleges of the University in community service-learning projects. The University remains committed to creating and maintaining a coherent institutional policy regarding parental issues. During the past year, the number of active members in the Parents’ Association grew to more than 600 families, with many members becoming actively involved in a variety of University programs and services such as Colonial Inauguration, admissions recruiting, move-in day into the residence halls, and Family Weekend. Colonial Inauguration, initiated in 1989, became a national award-winning freshman orientation program for stu- dents and their families. Last year, we had an attendance of more than 3,000.

The unit’s Office of Enrollment Research and Retention expanded its research efforts to learn more about our undergraduate students’ involvement in experiential learning activities (internships, cooperative education, or voluntary service) or paid employment during their undergraduate careers. This research showed that four out of five undergraduates have been involved in at least one experiential learning activity or paid employment. Only 16 percent have not worked nor participated in any of these activities. Survey results also revealed the fact that involvement in work, internships, or voluntary service appear to have a beneficial effect on student grade point averages. Those stu- dents involved in at least one experience earned significantly higher grades than those who were not involved in any job or experiential learning activity. Students seeking involvement in these activities can consult the Career Center. The center, which provides comprehensive one-stop shopping for students, alumni, and employers by inte- grating student employment, cooperative education, and career services, has seen students use more than double since 1988. In 1997, the Career Center conducted more than 3,000 scheduled and drop-in consulting sessions, compared with 1,031 in 1988. Attendance at 103 special career-related programs numbered 6,274, and more than 8,000 visits were recorded in the career resource room, which houses 1,300 directories and texts. In 1997, 206,259 full- time jobs, 3,606 summer and part-time jobs, and 7,221 internships were listed with the Career Center. The Colonial Connection, the alumni career network, numbered more than 1,000 participants. The office coordinated a record 657 cooperative education placements. Students collectively earned more than $4 million while working for 243 employers, including Bell Atlantic, GE Information Services, IBM, MCI, Mobil Corporation, and the U.S. Department of State. In the student employment area, 284 work-study employers listed 1,342 jobs for eligible stu- dents, 867 work-study students accepted positions earning the group slightly more than $1.3 million. The student employment staff also interacted with 1,525 part-time employers who hired 1,380 students, earning them $3.1 million. On the technology side, the Career Center’s World Wide Web site received more than 77,700 hits; and 23,053 visits were recorded on JOBTRAK, an online 24-hour job listing service operated in partnership with more than 650 universities nationwide. Another opportunity for graduating seniors wishing to continue their education at GW and earn professional experience is the Presidential Administrative Fellows Program. In 1989, Presi- dent Trachtenberg, initiated this program to provide professional opportunities for graduating seniors while they continue their graduate-level studies. In addition to an increasing number of applicants, the program is also experiencing greater demand from University departments to host a fellow. For the first time in the program’s history, more offices expressed interest in host- ing a fellow than we had students selected for the program. Additionally, for the first time, a Presidential Administrative Fellow will be interning off campus, in the office of District of Columbia Councilmember Jack Evans.

In 1997, 497 students with disabilities were served, compared with 159 in 1988 Those served include students with disabilities in mobility/dexterity, vision, and hearing impairments, as well as non-visible disabilities such as learning disabilities/cognitive disorders, attention deficit disorders, medical/psychological impairments, and diagnostic referrals. ATHLETICS The 17 men’s and women’s intercollegiate athletic teams had increasingly outstanding years, both athletically and academically. This year, our women’s soccer program made its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance, while the women’s basketball program made it to the “Elite 8” in the NCAA basketball tournament— the best showing for a GW team ever in an NCAA tournament. The women’s gymnastic team also earned a spot at the NCAA regionals with a sixth-place finish. GW was well represented among league academic honors by placing 105 student athletes on the 1996-97 Atlantic 10 Commissioner’s Honor Roll (minimum 3.0 yearly GPA). Additionally, 63 percent of the 298 students who participated in intercollegiate athletics made the athletic director’s honor roll (3.0 minimum GPA per semester). Attendance at GW games has increased over the years. An average of 4,365 fans attended each of the men’s basketball home games, almost a full-house! Attendance at women’s bas- ketball home games has increased as well. In 1988, attendance averaged 331— it’s now up to 1,334. When our students aren’t watching the games live in the Smith Center, they can catch many of them on television. In 1997, a total of 20 GW men’s and women s basketball games were televised — 1 1 nationally. Robert A.

The University made impressive advances in the areas of student quality and diversity, student services, faculty scholarship, curriculum, infrastructure, and external affairs. All of this is inextricably linked with the increase in positive national recognition that led to GW’s inclusion in the top 50 col- leges and universities as reported by U.S. News and World Report in 1996. The impact that better qualified students have on curriculum is illustrated by more rigorous and innovative course offerings. Improvements in technology infrastructure further enhance the learning environment as modern software approaches to learning are incorporated into the classroom experience. To give students the opportunity to take full advantage of the course offerings available, student advising and first-year introductory courses have taken on a whole new dimension at GW. The increasing value of generating and maintaining relationships with the external community is fully recognized, and schools have increased their efforts in this area. The regular interaction among the deans and administrators within Academic Affairs allows for collaborative planning. The Council of Deans and the Graduate Enrollment Management Committee are examples of forums that facilitate a cooperative approach to common goals. Our administrative units are working with the schools to meet the changing needs of our students and society, while main- taining the integrity of our traditional academic programs. From instructional technology to off- campus programs to increased research activity, we are changing and growing in ways that will help us continue attracting quality students and preparing those students for a lifetime of learning. Total Sponsored Research Expenditures 60 1997 President's Report 31 The tremendous improvements made in Gelman Library are essential to student and faculty recruiting and satisfaction, and the improvements made in facilities over the past few years are also viewed as critical to school identity, efficiency, collegiality, and strength. GW continues to not only draw from, but to contribute to, intellectual life in the nation’s capital. The Honors Program and University Seminars Program have made very positive con- tributions. At the same time, GW stretched the boundaries of its strategic location by creating a strong presence in the high technology corridor of Northern Virginia. The Loudoun County campus has contributed greatly to GW’s research enterprise, as well as to relationships with Virginia institutions. The increasing quality of GW students has been complemented by the improved quality of our faculty. We have enjoyed increasing success with the recruitment of first-choice faculty at all ranks. Additionally, the faculty recruited are, as a group, oriented toward our overall goal of raising the level and quality of research scholarship at GW. Achievements are highlighted by the faculty awards and honors listed in this report. RESEARCH Substantial efforts have been made since 1988 to strengthen creativity, scholarship, and research at GW. In 1989, we created a new position of associate vice president for academic affairs and research (now titled associate vice president for research and graduate studies) to serve as the central advocate and coordinator for programs that support research. Under this leadership, three advisory committees guide the research enterprise: • The Advisory Council on Academic Research shapes research policy, charters, and monitors scholarly centers and institutes, and advises on the allocation of Research Enhancement Awards. These funds have been awarded since 1990 to highly productive research centers and institutes with the potential to attain “world class” status, as well as to promising ones that can achieve excellence with a base of support. Some 58 institutes and centers, representing every school in the University, are officially chartered now. The centers and institutes that received Research Enhancement Awards for 1997-98 are: The Center for the Study of Combustion and the Environment; the Center for Nuclear Studies; the Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies; the Institute for Materials Science; the Institute for MEMS and VLSI Tech- nologies; the Laboratory for Advanced Computer Applications in Medicine; the Neuroscience Program; and the Robert Weintraub Research Program in Systematics and Evolution. • The Council on Doctoral Programs reviews proposals for new doctoral degrees. The relation- ship between research and graduate education is a close and symbiotic one. Involvement in fac- ulty research and scholarship enhances the student’s learning experience; well-trained graduate students improve the quality of research. • The University Committee on Research reviews applications to the University Facilitating Fund, a fund to support faculty scholarship in areas in which outside funding is difficult to obtain and to provide seed money so that faculty can do the preliminary studies often required to obtain major external funding. This committee annually reviews 70-80 faculty research proposals and funds about 20. Next year’s award recipients will study such diverse topics as life in the 19th-century slums, the evolution of spiders, women’s contributions to the rock music industry, and Islamic constitutional law. Deans provide additional support for the research of their faculty — for example, by purchasing equipment for new faculty mem- bers’ laboratories and providing summer support for junior faculty research. Other significant milestones in GW’s quest to become a top-tier research university include the following: • In 1991, GW expanded its research space with the building of the Virginia campus. The University allocated some $750,000 for equipment and wired the building to handle the latest information technology. In addition to providing research space to several School of Engi- neering and Applied Science faculty, the Virginia campus houses the GW Transportation Institute (including the National Crash Analysis Center), research run by the Department of Physics, and other projects. 32 The George Washington University • In 1993, a new associate vice president for research and graduate studies worked with advisory committees to write the University’s first mission statement and strategic plan for research. The guiding goals, which still steer research planning, call for strengthening GW as a research-oriented University and enriching both undergraduate and graduate education in the process. • The Office of Sponsored Research expanded its staff so that it could provide more and better support services to investigators seeking outside funding — everything from information about available funding sources, to help with budget and contract preparation, to advice on how to hire research staff and purchase equipment when the grant or contract is in hand. The University created the position of pre-award development coordinator in 1995 to help inves- tigators prepare proposals for funding; meanwhile, the Office of Sponsored Research has been providing more information to faculty through its Web page, grant-writing seminars, and individual consultation. The Office of Medical Center Research serves similar functions for medical school faculty. • Starting in FY 1993, the University began to return a percentage of the money brought to the University through sponsored research back to the investigators who obtained it, their departments, and their schools. These Research Enhancement Incentive Awards are reinvested in research, further strengthening GW’s research capabilities. • GW has increased recognition of its leading scholars. Since 1992, the Oscar and Shoshana Trachtenberg Prize for Research Scholarship has been awarded yearly to a distinguished scholar in an effort to recognize and reward excellence in scholarship. Award recipients to date have been Nozer Singpurwalla of operations research, Alfred Hiltebeitel of religion, Alison Brooks of anthropology, David Ramaker of chemistry, Fred Abramson of pharmacology, and Akbar Montaser of chemistry. • In March 1997, the University celebrated its scholarly accomplishments by holding its first University-wide research fair, the Scholars Showcase. The purpose was to allow students, fac- ulty, and the broader community to see for themselves the impressive range of scholarly activity at GW. More than 300 faculty research posters, demonstrations, and presentations were featured, and faculty had many opportunities to talk across disciplinary lines about their common research interests. These many investments in strengthening research at GW are paying off handsomely. GW is attracting more and more capable faculty members because they can see that it is a university that cares about research and seeks to become a top research university. Meanwhile, faculty HIGHLIGHTS BY SCHOOL COLUMBIAN SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCES A Freshman Advising Workshop Program has been initiated, and is complemented by advising awards given to faculty nominated by students. Awards are given in the categories of freshman, major, and graduate student advising to help illustrate the importance that the school places on the involvement of faculty in high quality advising. Columbian School faculty are increasingly working across disciplinary boundaries as evi- denced by exciting new interdisciplinary pro- grams in human origins and Judaic studies. In part to facilitate academic cooperation among faculty, a number of departments have been relo- cated for closer proximity to disciplinary neigh- bors. For example, most of the social science departments are now located in Funger Hall, while most of the humanities departments are in the Academic Center. SCHOOL OF BUSINESS AND PUBLIC MANAGEMENT Designed to enhance the academic and personal learning processes of undergraduate students, the School of Business and Public Management developmental program has been successfully combined with curricular revisions to attract more qualified applicants and to increase retention. The creation of what is now called the F. David Fowler Career Center provides increased career assistance to graduate students with expansions expected to support all School of Business and Public Management students. Cooperative educa- tion placements have increased from 91 in 1990- 91 to 215 in 1996-97. 1997 President's Report 33 attract more and more research funding from government agencies, foundations, and industry each year. Between 1988 and 1997, the University increased its total sponsored research expen- ditures from $33 million to more than $59 million. The Medical Center accounted for more than $24 million of the FY 1997 research dollars, about 41 percent of the total — and this does not count some research by medical school faculty based at the Children s National Medical Center and the Holland Laboratories. The importance of off-campus facilities, such as GW’s Biostatis- tics Center in Rockville, Md., and the laboratories at the Virginia campus, is clear, in that much of the funded research was carried out away from the downtown campus. Among other things, GW’s faculty have been studying the effects of alternative drug treatments on individuals with HIV infection, techniques of diagnosing cancer, the prevention of diabetes, the genetic heritage of endangered species, decision making on the Supreme Court, the earliest human civilizations, the chemistry of newly synthesized materials, nuclear physics, the management of national parks, the effects of unemployment on the family, the education of emotionally disturbed children, policy issues in sending humans into space, the prevention of international conflict, violations of environmental law, high-speed computer technology, the effects of automobile accidents on both cars and passengers, and the economics and management of tourism. FACULTY AWARDS AND HONORS One indicator of a faculty’s strength is its receipt of prestigious awards and honors. These awards represent recognition, nationally and internationally, of the quality of the faculty s scholarly activities and research. For example, many GW faculty — more than 40 — have earned the honor of being elected fellows or members of major professional organizations, among them, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Acad- emy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine, the Ameri- can Bar Foundation, the American Law Institute, the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Physical Society, the National Academy of Public Administration, the International Statistical Institute, and the Geological Society of America. Since 1988, faculty have received 41 Fulbright scholar awards to conduct their research and/or teach abroad. Faculty have received many other prestigious fellowships to support their scholarship: five from the Guggenheim Foundation; five from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; five from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foun- dation; seven from the National Endowment for the Humanities; three from the American Council of Learned Societies; one from the Rockefeller Foundation; two from the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences; and eight other fellowships. To illustrate, in 1996-97 alone, Fulbright fellowships allowed Nancy Benco of anthropology to travel to Morocco, and Bernard Mergen of American studies to go to Mongolia. Jerry Wiener of psychiatry was a guest scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, and Alison Brooks of anthropology received a fellowship from the American Council of Learned GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Formerly located in several buildings on campus, the vast majority of faculty and staff have been relocated to the totally renovated former George Washington University Inn, thereby creating a stronger sense of identity and belonging among the faculty, students, and staff. Recognized for its innovative programs, research orientation, and visionary faculty, the Graduate School of Education and Human Development was cited among the top 50 graduate schools of education in the nation in 1996 and 1997, as reported in U.S. News & World Report. SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCE Sponsored research activity within the School of Engineering and Applied Science has increased greatly, with research expenditures increasing from $53,000 per faculty member in 1987-88, to $100,000 per faculty member in 1995-96. Twelve research institutes and 10 research and instruc- tional use labs were created during that time. The school initiated an Introduction to Engineering course as a means of bringing all students together for instruction on engineering basics and adjustment to university life. It also established a program whereby carefully selected faculty members per- form the regular undergraduate academic advising. 34 The George Washington University The faculty of our University continuously demonstrate that it is possible to sustain GW's longstanding commitment to excellence in teaching while attaining the highest levels of distinction in research as well. Societies. In addition, James Horton of American studies was selected CASE Professor of the Year for the District of Columbia by the Carnegie Foundation, and Melani McAlister of American studies received the Ralph Gabriel Dissertation Prize from the American Studies Association. GW faculty also held positions of leadership in national organizations in 1996-97. For exam- ple, Gene Cohen of health care sciences was elected president of the Gerontology Society of America, and Harry Harding, dean of the Elliott School of International Affairs, was chosen president of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs. From anthropol- ogy, Douglas Ubelaker will complete his term as president of the American Board of Forensic Anthropology, and Roy Grinker will round out his presidency of the American Anthropology Association’s Korean Studies Section. C. Dianne Martin of Electrical Engineering and Com- puter Science will remain president of the Recreational Software Advisory Council. GW faculty also won important book awards in 1996-97. For example, Howard Gillette of American studies earned the National Award of Merit from the American Association for State and Local History for Washington Seen: A Photographic History. Michael Marquardt of human resource development won the 1996 Book of the Year award from the Academy of Human Resource Development, and Marc Saperstein, newly hired head of Judaic studies and professor of history, received the National Jewish Book Award. Finally, several faculty have the honor and responsibility of editing professional journals and book series. These faculty include, William Becker of history for Business , Society, and the State , Jean Folkerts of media and public affairs for Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly , Rachelle Heller of electrical engineering and computer science for Computer and Education Journal , James Herschberg of history for the Bulletin of the Cold War International History Pro- ject, Teresa Murphy of American studies for American Quarterly , Peter Roll berg of Germanic and Slavic languages for The Modern Encyclopedia of East Slavic, Baltic, and Eurasian Litera- tures , David Shambaugh of political science for The China Quarterly, and Christopher Sterling of media and public affairs and the Columbian School of Arts and Sciences for Communications Booknotes. All things considered, it was a productive and rewarding year for the faculty. ELLIOTT SCHOOL OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS The school’s research centers have had significant success in attracting government and foundation funds. The U.S. Department of Education has named the Elliott School a National Resource Center for International Studies, which will gen- erate both programmatic support and graduate fellowships. The number, quality, and diversity of master’s degree students has increased significantly since 1988. At the same time, the curriculum has become more diverse and, at the graduate level, more professional in orientation. A new one-year master’s degree program, the Master of Interna- tional Policy and Practice, reflects a focus on the needs of mid-career students. LAW SCHOOL With only 23 of the 47 tenured or tenure-track faculty remaining from among those here in 1987- 88, the Law School has hired 42 new faculty members. Outstanding, nationally known faculty members and deans from other law schools have been added to the faculty, as well as less senior faculty who have clerked for justices of the United States Supreme Court and published in prestigious law journals. Faculty diversity has also improved during this time. The Law School has expanded its curriculum by 45 courses since 1987-88, created three new clin- ical offerings, and substantially enhanced the four existing programs specializing in intellectual property, international law, government contract law, and environmental law, which are now nationally recognized. 1997 President's Report 35 This year is off to a good start. In 1997-1998, Fulbrights will send Young-Key Kim-Renaund of East Asian languages to Korea, Janet Steele of media and public affairs to Indonesia, and Steven Tuch of sociology to Poland. Dina Khoury of history will enjoy a National Endow- ment for the Humanities fellowship to work at the American Research Center in Turkey, and Nadia Abu El-Haj of anthropology will benefit from a research and writing grant from the MacArthur Foundation. Finally, Caroline Long of Gelman Library will become the 1997- 1998 president of the Reference and User Services Association. More good news lies ahead, no doubt. GW faculty continue to look for new opportunities to join forces with government agencies and with business and industry to develop solutions to society’s problems and to see that these solutions are made known and are implemented. And all the while, both undergraduate and graduate students are learning how knowledge in their fields is acquired by working with their faculty mentors on scholarly projects, both funded and unfunded. The future looks bright as GW continues to attract capable scholars and to offer them more of the support they need in order to make contributions to their disciplines, to the education of their stu- dents, and to society at large. The faculty of our University continuously demonstrate that it is possible to sustain GW’s longstanding commitment to excellence in teaching while attaining the highest levels of dis- tinction in research as well. The bibliography that follows is prima facie evidence of the scholarly productivity of our faculty. Because the volume of the research reports, learned essays, and creative performances presented by our faculty colleagues during 1996-97 could in itself fill this entire report, we have had to be selective. Each faculty member was asked to name his or her most outstanding work. This year’s selections not only include published articles and books, but also papers presented at national meetings, works of art and music, performances, and, as a testament to the times, there are even a few Internet addresses referenced. The compilation of scholarly products that results is impressive by any measure, and further reveals the texture of GW’s academic life. Donald R. Lehman Vice President for Academic Affairs SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCES Research funding is increasing, particularly in the areas of foundation funding for health policy research and pharmaceutical support for drug trials and clinical research. In order to facilitate continued growth and interdisciplinary endeav- ors, the University created three institutes: the Institute for Biomedical Sciences; the Institute for Clinical Research and Clinical Trials; and the Institute for Health Policy Outcomes and Human Values. The revolution in the health system has encour- aged the creation of innovative new programs in health professions education. As the school makes additions to the curricula, it is also exploring new ways of teaching, including problem-based learning, community-based clinical experiences, and computer simulations. SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH SERVICES The progressive growth of public health pro- grams led to the creation of the new School of Public Health and Health Services, established July 1, 1997. The school combines the public health programs from the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, the health services manage- ment and policy programs of the School of Busi- ness and Public Management, and the exercise science program of the Graduate School of Edu- cation and Human Development. The school brings together more than 600 students and 3,500 alumni. Education and service programs will be the focus of the five departments of the school. These departments are environmental-occupa- tional health; epidemiology-biostatistics; health services management and policy; international public health; and prevention and community health. Expansion activities underway include continuing education programs, an emphasis on distance learning, an undergraduate minor, and new initiatives in health law, long-term care, school health, and management of care. 36 The George Washington University UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS Peter Caws: “Jusqu’au moment de la mort, tout le monde est immortel.” [In French] La Vie et la mort , M.
