CHRISTMAS CARDS FOR THE BLIND. Sliere, at the foot of Box Hill, is one of the prettiest of Surrey villages, and two festivals are observed there. The Festival of Spring is kept with a Maypole dance and Burial of Winter; while Christmas is kept by the issue of Christmas cards and calendars for the blind. They are issued by the editor of the \" Weekly Summary\" for the blind. We have received samples of the calendars and Christmas cards in Braille type. The calendar is entitled \"The Way They have in the Navy,'- and present.5 a quotation from the classics on '-Duty \" fOr each month January is favoured with a picture, in relief, ot a modern battleship, with Nelson's signal, ^ Eng- land expects every man to do his duty. VVe do not pretend to he able to read Braille cha- racters, but the editor is good enough to put typewritten transcriptions between the sheets There is a Christmas card with a group ot buds at the head which bears the following verse : A JOYFUL CHRISTMAS. With angels therefore sing again, To G-od on high all glory be. For pea.ee on earth bestoweth He, And showeth favour unto man. Another and smaller card represents a lyre with the appropriate motto, \" Kind words arc the music of the world. MANCHESTER GUARDIAN, NOVEMBER 3, 1904. HENSHAW'S BLIND ASYLUM, A MUNIFICENT GIFT. The minutes read at yesterday's meeting of Henshaw's Blind Asylum, held in the offices in Deansgate, contained the interesting announce- 1 ment that the trustees under the will of the late Mr. James Holden, of Rochdale, have presented the institution with £10,000, under certain con- ditions. It was stated that Mr. W. H. Illing- worth, head master of the Kuj ...i Blind Asylum and School, Edinburgh, had been selected to fill the vacant post of superintendent ofr the Asylum. The appointment was afterwards formally made. Mr. Illingworth will receive a salary of £400, and will not reside in the A.sylum. The previous superintendent and matron were paid £240, but in their case they svere maintained at the cost of the institution. Mr. Platt-Higgins, M.P., who presided, -noved the adoption of the minutes of the Board ^f Management, and expressed the deep in- debtedness of the supporters of the institution ,o the trustees of the late Mr. James Holden, -•f Rochdale, for the munificent contribution of £10,000. He said that no institution was in greater need of funds, and none deserved more help. Mr. Platt-Higgins emphasised a remark made by Dr. Campbell, of the Royal Normal College for the Blind, as to the importance of discriminating between skilled and unskilled olind workers. It often happened that when a ->lind man did a piece of work badly all blind workers as a class were condemned, although he fault lay in the inefficiency of the particular worker, and not in his blindness. Mr. Royle, in seconding the resolution, said that they hoped that under the new superintendent the Asylum would make a better record in the future than in the past. The Statements by Archdeacon Wilson. Mr. Hodgson asked how it was that no atten- tion had been paid to Archdeacon Wilson's letters in the \" Manchester Guardian \" in which ' Archdeacon Wilson asked for an explanation I of the statement that the workshops were in a ' profitable condition. It had always been un- derstood that the workshops were conducted at a loss. It was highly desirable that the public should know to what extent the labour of the blind was profitable. To what extent were the goods sold in the shop of the institu- tion made by the blind, and to what extent te they bought elsewhere? The accounts a3 now printed did not show what the blind really cost and what sums were derived from tl Inge which were sold but were not made by the blind. The expenditure of the institution had been growing without a proportionate in- crease in the number of inmates. VI r. I' • explained thai in copk&z the statement referred to he did not intend to say that the workshops were making a profit. He was pointing out that, while for the last year the workshops had been carried on at a loss of only £355, in the previous year the loss had been £500. He was comparing losses, not an nouncing a profit. He believed that the out- look at present was considerably brighter than it had been. Captain Hobbs . accused Archdeacon Wilson of being not a well-wisher to the institution — of being, indeed, \" inimical \" to it. He did not think that Archdeacon Wilson had ever taken the trouble to inquire what the rules and re- gulations were under which the Board were obliged to act. If he had done so he would not have made such remarks. The minutes were adopted. COLORADO INDEX. NOVEMBER 3, 1904. The Medical Convention. Mr. Argo attended one of the sessions oi the recent convention of tht State Medical As< sociation, taking with him three of the pupils in order to refute certain charges not infre- quently made by medical practitioners againsl the School. It sometimes occurs that a child has its hearing impaired by disease or some accidental causes when the physician is consulted as to the advisability of sending the child to the School, the advice is given to keep him at home with the comforting assurance that he would in time \"outgrow the infirmity,\" and that on the other hand if he were sent he would lose the speech and hearing yet left from associa- tion with the rest of the pupils. Where the advice was followed, in nine cases out of ten, deafness, so far from disappearing, became more and more pronounced, and not only this, but the child through difficulty or inability to attend the common school was deprived of the education that was its due and which might have been acquired here. To convince the doctors of the error of their premises Mr. Argo exhibited the three pupils mentioned, each of them representing a dis- tinct class of such children as the School receives. One, our deaf-blind boy, Ralph Wooden, was unable to speak a word (Ralph lost sight totally and hearing partially at four years of age) except \"papa,\"or \"mamma,\" when first entered and was unable to understand speech though he could hear the sound of the voice. Now, after four years of aural and oral training, he speaks readily and distinctly and also carries on conversation by the ear and we have every reason to hope that in time he can be designated as simply blind, and not bliud deaf with all the term implies. Mr. Argo used Ralph to demonstrate what the School is doing in the development of latent or impaired hearing. The Colorado and Utah Schools. It was our pleasure this summer to pay a visit to the Utah and Colorado Schools for the Deaf and Blind. A little over a year ago we visited the Colorado School while in session and at that time spoke of the impressions made upon us. We believe it has no superior in this western country and it has few superiors, if any, in the east. Mr. Argo is an ideal super- intendent and everything about the school up- to-date. Though the Utah School is our nearest neighbor we have never had the pleasure of visiting it until this summer. The school was not in session, but we got a good idea of the quality of the work carried on, and from the appearance of everything we saw and our pre- vious knowledge of the school we can safely assert that no school in the United States has made such a rapid stride forward in the past three years as this school has under the wise management of Supt. Driggs. Although Supt. Driirgs is the youngest superintendent of any school for the deaf in this country, he is also one of the most progressive. The grounds of the Utah School are cer- tainly beautiful and the school has the finest system or systems of irrigation we have ever saw. Both schools are very fortunate in having for the presidents of their boards of trustees men who take a special pride in equipping the schools with the best that can be had, and Messrs. Driggs and Argo speak highly of this fact and the service it has been in bringing their schools to the front rank. — Montana Leader. The Ohio Chronicle.

The food was better ! , k after that and then it became so bad again that the pupils declare they are forced to complain. They submit sample menus in support of the charges they make. In addition it Is charged that the meat the pupils are given is often spoiled and unfit to eat. They claim that the superintendent has saved money out of food they should have had to build new greenhouses and icehouses, and that the pupils are often compelled to buy food for themselves of neighbors that they may have enough to live on. J. C. Bogaz-dus, the night engineer, who has been at the school for nearly three years, con- firms the stories of an insufficient food supply in every particular. The pupils think a pub- lic investigation should be made in justice to them. A One of the blind boys at the state ^rhool says that he can vote a split ticket on the machine in 10 seconds. A man with sight ought to be able to do as well. There is nothing com- X plicated about it. *£NT7N££ WIS BLIND BOY LET OUT Entered at the postoffice at Columbus as second class mail matter. Saturday, November 5, 1904 Gold Med^l for Mr. Wade We take pleasure in announcing that Mr. William Wade of Oakmont, Pennsylvania, the friend of the doaf- blind, has been awarded a gold medal at the Louisiana PurchaseExposition \"for his benefactions to deaf-blind children and for untiring zeal in finding out and providing education for such children in the United States.\" This medal was worthily bestowed and we rejoice with his many friends in it. Showalter Dismisses One of the Signers of Better Food Petition. LEGAL STEPS WILL BE TAKEN BLIND WARDS SAY irfEY STARVE Demand Investigation in Wisconsin of Food in State School. Pupils Complain That Superintendent Gives Them Spoiled Meat. [Special Telegram.] Janesville, Wis., Nov. 4.— Twenty-four students of the state school for the blind have oined In a demand for an investigation of their charges that they are being starved. They made a complaint several weeks ago to the board of control. Harvey Clark, vice- president of the board, came here to investi- Special Dispatch to The Sentinel. JANESVILLE, Wis., Nov. 6.— Dismissed with dishonor from his home for the last ten years because he signed the petition to the public asking that the state institute for the blind be investigated, is the fate that was meted out to Arthur Corry, by Supt. C R. Showalter t}iis morning. Further, Mr. Showalter refused to listen to a peti- tion signed by twenty-six of the students asking for his reinstatement or to dis- cuss the food question with a massmeeting of students this evening. The school is in a state of panic. None of the boys who signed the petition knows who is to go next. Several of them have consulted legal authority with the idea of securing an injunction restraining Supt. Showalter from sending Corry away. Today being Sunday, no legal steps were taken, but the papers will be drawn up the first thing in the morning. It is not considered a political matter here, as La Follette supporters and con- servatives are interested in seeing the wrong righted as speedily as possible. How- ever, the fact remains that Supt. Showalter is an appointee of the governor, having re- placed Mr. Hutton, who, ten months ago, was sent to Waukesha. Arthur Corry, the dismissed student, has been an Inmate of the school for ten years. He came from Viroqua, where he made his home with his grandmother. Except what little he receives from his mother, he is entirely dependent upon what he can earn outside study hours tuning pianos. His case is exceedingly sad, owing to the fact that in a few weeks he would have finished a complete course in piano tuning and would then be able to earn his living. He is in delicate health, having recently recovered from a serious illness which com- pelled him to employ a trained nurse. His dismissal came as a shock to him this morning. He was in a student's room when told that he was wanted across the hall in a teachers' room. Here he found Supt. Showalter and two teachers. In curt lan- guage Mr. Showalter informed Corry that he must leave the school by Monday night. No definite reason was given for the dis- missal, beyond the fact that he was told ho had completed his course of work, had received a certificate to this effect, and he was a trouble disturber and ringleader of the boys who objected to the food. This evening Mr. Showalter was requested to meet with the twenty-six boys who signed the petition Friday night, and the following petition was presented to him: \"Owing to the fact that Arthur Corry's future success largely depends upon wheth- er he goes houorably or dishonorably from this school, we, the undersigned, respect- fully petition you to recall his dismissal, for we think he has done nothing to war- rant it. His action taken with regard to the food is indorsed by all of us.\" This was signed by the following Milwau- kee boys: John Baer, 419 Sherman street; Otto Bauer, 2515 Walnut street; Bert John ston, 1312 Vine street; William Quade, 7P,-- Forest Homo avenue; Frank Siegel, 049 Robinson avenue, and Aloysius Tyczkowski, 570 Fifth avenue. The remainder of the signers are the signers of the petition pub- lished on- Saturday. Mr. Showalter curtly refused to listen to the petition, to accept it, or to discuss the food question. He stated that the boys had good food, and of sufficient quantity, and he did not intend to explain bis actions or allow Corry to re- main in the school. He then announced the meeting was at an end and left the room. The boys are determined to stand by their fellow student and, if his dismissal remains in force, many of them may ask their parents to remove them. «•»!, ■™ ™» - NN^coTiS\\x\\.\\\\oV. sr,\\^V ^^JTGonia of this city who is a student at the State Institute for the Blind is one of a number of students in that institution who have signed a public protest against the character and in- sufficiency of the food furnished them.

BH nil Institute Held Attempts to Refute Charges. Pioneer Press Special Service. ' Janesville. Wis., Nov. 9.— Suprt. Sho- walter of the State Institute for the Blind is out with some new statements showing: that the bill of fare from Oct. 30 to Xov 5 was much more elaborate than that which the twenty-six dissatis- fied students sent to the board of con- trol as a sample. The students who pro- tested acknowledge that the menu is cor- rect, but maintain that it lacked both in quantity and quality. Mr. Showalter also gives out a finan- cial statement which shows that ex- penses during his term and during those of Hutton and Bliss was approximately SS.000 a year.

About a year and a half ago, an or- ganizaion, known as the Maine Asso- ciation for the Blind, was farmed for the purpose of promoting the general interests of the blind of this state. Realizing that direct financial aid conld only assist those to whom it was given tor p brief time at the most, the society decided to fellow the lead of one ot its members, V J Ryan, who had previously been agitating the es- tablishing of an industrial school for the adnlts of this state who were without sight. Mr Ryan knew, from actual epxerience, that lack of 6ight need not debar any person from earn- [g a livelihood, if given the necessary lining. It was for this reason that he gave his attention to the object above mentioned, and the society wisely followed his example But the success of this movement, to a great extent, rests with the citi- zens of Maine; and it is to them that those who are working for this object appeal for aid and support. The peo- ple of this state cannot justly ignore this appeal ; they cannot justly de- prive nearly 1,600 oitizens of an edu- cation which will enable them to be- come self-supporting ; and yet this is exactly what will be done if they fail to aid this movement. Th3 blind ask to be given an opportunity to make their own way in life; only this, ard no more. Is not such a request jast? Is it not worthy of the support of every fair-minded person iu this state? It is a duty which should no? be shirked ; and Mr Ryan and his as- sociates ask that the citizens of Maine shall not fail to fulfil this obligation. William Lynch, President. BATH (ME.)

About a year and a half ago, an or- ganization, known as the Maine Asso- ciation for th« Blind, was formed for the purpose of promoting the gen- eral interests of the blind of this state. Realizing that direct financial aid could only assist those to whom it was given for a brief time at the most, the 60oiety decided to follow the lead of one of its members, Mr. W. J. Ryan, who had previously been agitating the establishing of an indus- trial schoo' for the adult of this state who were without sight. Mr. Ryan knew, from aotual experienoe, |that lack of sight need not debar any per- son from earning a livelihood, if given the necessary training. It was for this reason that he gave his attention to the objeot mentioned above ; and the society wisely followed his exam- ple. But the suooess of this movement rests, to a great extent with the citi- zens of Maine, and it is to them that those who are working for this object appeal for aid and support. The peo- ple of this state cannot justly ignore this appeal; they cannot justly de- prive nearly 1,600 citizens of an edu- cation whioh will enable theji to be- come self-supporting ; and yet this is exactly what will be done if they fail to aid this movement. The blind ask to be given [an opportunity to make their own way in life; only this, and no more. Is not suoh a request just?! Is it not worthy of the support of every fair-minded oitizen of this sate? It is a duty which should not be shirked, and Mr. Ryan and his as- sociates ask that the people of Maine shall not fail to fullfil this obligation. William Lynch, Pres.

Recent Charges That Pupils Were Starved Not Substan- tiated by Facts. Citizens Censure Attempt to Make Political Capital by Attacking. Superintendent. — [Special Correspondence.] Janesvti.j.e, Wis., Nov. 12— Regret is free- ly expressed here by citizens of all shades of political belief that in the heat of the recent political campaign the state institution for the blind was made the object of an attack Which II Is generally believed grew solely out Olitlcal and spite motives. It is true that ■ liiion was framed and forwarded to the e board Of control early in October which ed by twenty-five boys of the school which attacked Superintendent C. H. Showalti r on the grounds thut the food the Inmates oi the Institul |n- I and of poor quality. Shortly after the petition was j. resented Harvey ('lark, board of i ontrol, in the course of a regular visit, such as I nt- S- ■« ■^CAODZ ./S^ v^ZL&«Z3. C^sLrtzr or^ASE^r. iy made by the members of the board ot con- trol to all state institutions, investigated the charges, but found them to be based upon so little foundation that he paid no attention to tin m. In the closing days of the campaign an- other appeal was made by the same boys who signed the first. The second appeal was made through the newspapers, rather than to the board of control, and it is significant of the conditions as they appear to a disin- ted observer that the newspapers which used the appeal first and which made the most of It, both in their news and editorial (olumi -. wore newspapers which have, while carrying the republican ticket at the head of their editorial page, openly and actively fought the reelection of Governor La Fol- S iperintendent Showalter of the blind school, who is accredited by the people of Janesville with \"stalwart\" predilections, but who has had the good sense to refrain Hom political aggressiveness during ;,'js incurn. bency of the office of sujj^otenderit, himself ■expresses the belie? that the attack was - made not ^o rr.'uch against himself as against the bo°rcl of control, through which La Fol- k'cte would be more directly attacked. To a representative of The Sunday Chron- icle Superintendent Showalter freely ac- corded the privilege of examining the books and records of the institution. The news] per representative was cordially invited to inspect the larder of the institution, to re- main to dinner and lunch and to talk freely with any of the inmates of the institution that he wished. The boys'who had signed the protest who were interviewed \"stood pat\" In the assertion that the food was insufficient. But of the remaining two-thirds of the pupils who did not sign the protest not one was found who did \",ci express himself as en- Mresij satisfied with the treatment he was receiving in every particular. Books Show Increased Expenditure. Much capital was made of the statement of J. C. Bogardus, night engineer at the insti- tution, that under the regime of Mr. Showal- ter the food supply for the institution had been cut to less than half what it was under Superintendent Hutton, who preceded Mr. Showalter. The carefully kept records of the institution amply refute this allegation. The motive of Engineer Bogardus in championing the attack upon the management of the in- stitution is found in the assertion of Superin- tendent Showalter that Oct. 1, owing to some dissatisf action with his services, Mr. Bo- gardus was told that his resignation would be accepted. It is said by the superintendent that after this notice was given the night en- gineer the first attack came. The seed of dissatisfaction having been once sown, the politicians opposed to the La Follette administration seized upon the open- ing with avidity. A newspaper man who had been removed from the position of superin- tendent of the institution by Governor La Follette was active in the attacks. All the boys who signed the petition were seen to emerge together from this gentleman's office on the day previous to the last attack. One of the boys, Arthur Corrcy, who signed a personal statement of the grievances of the students, told Mr. Showalter when questioned that \"they\" had demanded the signature of -Z2^gfc5*S?*gy -^O CZZXDAC CZCZjZ'2~UZZ>Zr C^JZ<4S^ at least one of the students to the attack, as Correy had received his diploma in the regu- | lar course of the institution last June and a diploma in piano-tuning but a day or two ire the charges appeared, he felt free to sign the statement. Correy had been read- m it ted to the institution to learn piano-tun- ing by Superintendent Showalter as an espe- cial favor. Whatever the motives, the fact remains that the books of the institution show that for the year ending July 1, 1904, over $1,000 more: was spent for subsistence for the same number of pupils and employes as for the previous year, half of which was under the Buperintendency of Mr. Hutton and half un- der thai of Mr llbowalter. Mr. Showalter makes the statement, and agrees to back it UP, that the food given the inmates of the institution is much L-tter and has been dur- ing his incumbency of the office of superin- tendent than that which may be provided by a man earning a salary of $1,000 a year with a family of five lor which to provide. The rec- ords of the institution would appear to bear out the assertion fully. That the institution was brought into the political muddle is iff; retted by probably the great majority of the citizens of Janesville. One prominent democrat remarked that it was too bad that an institution of the charac- ter of the blind school should be dragged into political conflicts. He voiced the similar expression of other democrats and republic- ans that food conditions might be better at the school for the blind. \"If,\" he said, \"this attack had not come at the time it did and emanated from the source it did I would say there might be something to it, although not to the extent suggested by the petitions of the students. Under the circumstances, however, I believe the pro- test to l»e entirely a political move, and I say it is a shame to bring a state institution. ( S) e- cially of this character, into a political fight.\" The board of control has ordered no Ihvefi- nd it is not believed that one will be ma i As a matt< r of fact, the stale school for the blind at Janesville is one of the best of the w< 11 d institutions of the state. Su- perintend! nt Showalter is one of the best m,i>: of the state and it would be Impossible to talk with him for any con- able time and not to arrive at the con- clusion that his heart is thoroughly in the work : the condition of his un- fortunate wards. He has introduced, in the less than two years of his incumbency of the office, several innovations which all have a tendency to place the institution on a more solid and permanent basis. He has been criticised for some of his expenditures of money. It was asserted that he had saved money from the subsistence department that he might build a new icehouse, a greenhouse, buy a herd of Jersey cattle and experiment in poultry-raising. With the exception of having saved the money from the subsistence department all the allegations are true. Mr. Showalter has caused to be built a new ice- house, which is practically a necessity to the' institution. He is having built a green- house. A place was needed for the roots kept by the institution. Hitherto they have been kept in an underground cellar that was not only unsanitary but destructive to the roots. A properly constructed cellar was necessary for them. By a small additional expense the greenhouse facilities were added. The blind enjoy, by some subtle instinct, the beauties of nature as well as those who have the God-given benefit of good eyesight. The herd of Jersey cattle reduces expenses and at the same time gives the pupils and em- ployes a better quality of milk than they could possibly purchase. The herd gives ban M<t quarts of milk ''iiiij ml this milk is used entirely in the Institution. It provides ;i quart of milk daily '«»' ■• ■ h pupil and employe <>f the institution.

Incident to the establishment of the poultry business at the school for the blind is the > rectlon of a chicken-house. The work was all done by blind pupils of the school. The uprights were erected by them, the lumber sawed and the nails driven. While it might n a more finished product, it is a most serviceable one, and probably as few \"tradi show where the blind boys nail head and drove their ham- mers against the lumber than may be seen in an average building similarly constructed. .Manual training is an innovation intro- duced by Mr. Showalter. The blind, by the sense of touch exclusively, are able to per- form wonders in the use of lathes, saws an! other paraphernalia used in this depart- ment. They use the same tools and work at ime kind of benches as do their broth- ers who are gifted with sight. And much of their work is well-nigh perfect. ther innovation introduced by Superin- tendent Showalter is basket-weaving. This is just being started and has been taken up in cooperation with another state institu- tion, the employment bureau in Milwaukee. There provision has been made for the em- ploj ment of blind persons in basket-weaving. Room, light and heat are furnished. The material is provided and contracts secured. All that is necessary is for a needy blind person who has mastered the business of basket-weaving to present himself to this institution and secure sufficient work to more than keep him from want. The prod- uct of the work is sold, the cost of the mate- rial deducted and the balance paid to the workmen. This has proven one of the most ble forms of self-support that have been undertaken. Through its means the in- curably blind are rendered self-supporting and to that extent are aided to become good citizens. The entire object of the blind school under its present management is to make the blind self-supporting. Practicallv all the ex- is are borne by the state. Where the applicant for admission or his family is financially able it is required of them that they pay their own railway fare and provide their own clothing. Medical or surgical at- tendance is also supposed to be ijjaid for by the individual. All other expenses are paid by the state. When conditions are such that the applicant for admission can not pay the other expenses an ex cj 'ion is made and • receive addit : from the state. A',1 the branches taught at the institution are obligatory upon tjjie pupils. They re- i ceive the same common school training as pupils of the public The course runs up to the aca< i stress is placed upon musical education and p>ano.-tunl:ig, music being one branch in which the blind excel. Kindergarten classes are maintained for the little ones and the courses range from that up to the academic. Culinary art and science receive thorough attention. Sewing and typewriting are well taught. Many of pupils become proficient in the use of machines. The girls who learn sewing and allied trades can operate sewing ma- chines better than many of their more lortu- who can see. The girls in the sewing department are taught to cut gar- ments as well a them. They knit well, another favorite pastime for the blind, and many handsome pieces of embroidery a.s well as garm< , xhibition at the in- stitution. Much attention is devoted to physical cul- ture on the top floor of the institution is a large hall devoted to this work. It is here also semblies are held. At least once a we. tally on Saturday night, all the pupils gather hen Dancing is indulged in. both ,. . permitted to commingle in the pastime, which is at vi . with the custom usual to such institu- tions. Great care is exercised to keep pu] of the opposite s.x within proper resti tlons. The dormitories for the male pupils are separated from those of the females, but Superintendent Showalter is not a believer In the entire isolation of the different sexes. His polity has thus far been successful. Dancing is one of the forms of amusement which the blind thoroughly enjoy. Tench Physical Culture. Regular classes in physical culture are maintained and many of the pupils become proficient in most athletic exercises. They have in the assembly-room, which also serves as a gymnasium, horizontal bars and much other machinery for physical development. In the assembly hall is also located the pipe organ. Many of the music students become proficient on this instrument and the institu- tion ha\"s graduated a few organists of much more than ordinary ability. The dormitories for the pupils are kept in the neatest order. In such an institution special attention to lighting facilities are not, of course, necessary. But great atten- tion is paid in all parts of the buildings of the institution to ventilation and sanitary condi- tions. One of the reforms brought about by Mr. Showalter, and one in which much ex- pense has been entailed, has been the re- modeling of the sewerage and toilet facilities 1 of the buildings. These are now in the high- est possible stage of sanitary perfection, a change that was greatly needed when Mr. Showalter assumed charge of the institution. In the dining halls and kitchen every pos- sible convenience is installed. All the rooms of the buildings are exceedingly cleanly, the provisions are carefully kept in ice coolers and seemingly no effort possible has been spared for the sanitary comfort of the in- mates. Great attention is devoted to piano-tuning. The accommodations for this department are entirely too meager at present, but a bill has been prepared and will be introduced before the next legislature asking for an appropria- tion whereby this excellent work may be carried on under more convenient circum- stances. Print imil Edit Newspaper. A paper is printed by the school, being is- sued twice each month. The point type of the blind is used in its production, the type being set by a graduate of the school who is but partially blind. The point alphabet is taught, from the kindergartens up to those who graduate, and the proficiency which many of the pupils attain at reading the \"blind\" writing is nothing short of mar- velous. Many of them attain such precision and accuracy of touch that they can read an essay, written in \"points,\" almost as rapidly as a person gifted with the raised lett' which appear not different to a telegraph code. One of the interesting, if grewsome, sights of the institution is to witness a class of pupils seated at their school desks \"read- In\" their lessons. Because their method of \"seeing\" is different from that of the ma- jority of human beings it may not be said that the blind can not see. They have a method of sight that is very effective. In the home life of the institution the pupils are surrounded with every comfort that is possible in an institution under state control. The superintendent and his family and all , the members of the faculty live with the pupils. In the long evenings the matrons en- tertain the little folk by reading to them. The older pupils are allowed every liberty possible to good discipline. They walk a! the handsome grounds, singing, many of them; they play games, romp with one an- other and save for the sightless eyes and the common look of the totally blind are not unlike other children. They have their dif- ferences in common, and, like other children at other schools, indulge occasionally in fisti- cuffs and have to be reprimanded. Every attention is given to religious train- ing. A part of the faculty is Protestant and a part Catholic. The superintendent in- sists on religious teaching according to the beliefs of the pupil or the pupil's family. Six or seven religious societies such as the Christian Endeavor and the Epworth league, hold regular services in the main building on Sunday and on Sunday evenings religious services are provided, the 'superintendent most of the time giving the assembled pupils practical talks along moral and religious be number of pupils at present at me institution is eighty-eight. Tl enrollment, for the forty v irse Is a little over 100. . Pupils, teachers and other employes bring the average number who live at the institution up to about j4u. The sum expended in food for this number of persons during the last fiscal year amount- ed to well over $<!00 each month. The faculty consists of sixteen teachers. it is the rule of the school to admit only pupils of school age and of those none under 8 years old. Applicants are required to be of sound mind, good moral ,,,.]y good health.

The little folk had, as usual, milk to drink. Of the proportion of duck and chicken allotted to the pupils there was forty-nine pounds, more than a half pound of meat for each pupil. The bread and butter is purchased, the butter used being Elgin creamery and the bread of the finest quality. From ninety to 100 pounds of butter are used each week. Four bushels of potatoes are cooked each day, the institution raising in its own garden a large portion of the vegetables used for food. The regular meat bill for the week includes half of a beef, veal, mutton and smoked meats. In addition to these twelve or fifteen hogs have been killed and used during the past year. The total amount expended on subsistence for the last fiscal year, ending July 1, was $8,9S6.0<i. For the previous year, half of which was under the superintendency of Mr. Showalter anu half under that of his predecessor, the total amount was $7,503.49. Prices for foodstuff.* were about the same last year as the year before, save that last year potatoes and but- ter were higher in price. Mr. Showalter ac- counts for the money expended in buildings by the fact that during the last two years the appropriation for the school has been $7,000 more than in former years. The blind school at Janesville is; a credit to the state. It may be added, in absoiute fairness, that the whole attitude of the pres- ent superintendent indicates him to boa mar possessed of more than ordinary interest his work and enthusiasm for the welfarjro his wards. IN DEEP CAVERNS Eyeless Creatures That Inhabit Light- less Depths of Earth's Greatest Caves. CAVERN BEETLE IS RARITY Discovered in 1834, Few Companion Specimens Have Since Been Found. BLIND SPIDERS BEAUTIFUL Ivory White and of Large Size They Prey Constantly on Beetles — Rats of Pvlammoth Cave. \"ih< cavern beetle was first discovered some seventy years ago in an Au- , the grot to of Adel men only was caught, and, though its .li? coverer offered a prize of £5 for another. it wars fourteen years before a se was found. The cavern beetle has a little round; body, * ry long legs and absolutely noj eyes at all. Brought out from its gloomy haunts into the light of the sun it die- almost immediately. Vet in its pitch-dark home far beneath the surface of the earth it moves with as great rapidity and cer- tainty as any of its eyed relatives on the upper soil. To make up for its lack, or sight, it is provided with antennae of extraordinary length and delicacy. By means of these It feels its way over the rough surface ot the stone and hunts its pray— other small- er blind insects— with great rapidity and absolute certainty. The cavern beetle has its enemies. The blothrus (a species of scorpion) and the great eyeless spider hunt it remorselessly. Prince Khevenhuller, who thoroughly ex- plored these eaves some years ago, de- scribes it as a most extraordinary sight to watch by the light of a candle a scor- pion, absolutely eyeless, hunting a beetle, equally blind, along the cavern wall. Al- though the beetle was several feet in front of the scorpion, and divided from it by a fissure in the rock, yet the scorpion tracked it with absolute and almost ap- palling certainty. The spider found in these caves is of a lovely ivory white, and is able, like the other insects which inhabit the same sub- terranean depths, to run very rapidly, and find its way with as positive cer- tainty as if it had eyes and light to use j them. Like several of the others, it, too, l perishes if taken out of the cave. Sun- I light seems to wither and shrivel up these ' insects just as though they had been placed in front of a hot fire. Yet, in spite- of this fact, it is known that the blind cave creatures are descend- ed from others which originally lived in the light of clay. An extraordinary proof of this is that, though no faintest ray marks the differ- ence between day and darkness in the depths they live in, yet it has been ascer- tained beyond shadow of doubt that those whose ancestors were nocturnal in their habits still prefer to move about during those hours when the surface of the earth is in darkness. The cavern rat, found in the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, is of a soft, bluish color, with white neck and feet. It has enormous eyes, black as night, but quite unprovided with iris. These eyes are perfectly insensible <•• light, and when the experiment has been made of catching a cavern rat and turn- ing it loose in bright sunlight, it blunders about, striking itself against everything is unable to provide itself with food and finally falls down and dies. ; In its native depths, however, it is able to lead a comfortable enough existence. as its enormously long whiskers are so extremely sensitive that they enable it to find its way rapidly through the dark- ness The principal food of the cavern i rat consists' of a kind of large cricket of a pale yellow color, and, like most care dwellers, itself perfectly blind. Numbers of different kinds of fish are known to live in the gloomy rivers and lakes which exist in all large caves. At San Marcos, Texas, borings were re- cently made to provide a water supply tor some new fresh hatcheries. At a depth of 1SS feet a great stream of water war struck, which shot up at the rate of 1,300 gallons a minute.

He carries a lantern when he travels at night, but this is simply to warn others and prevent them from running into him. JOHN E. BORDEN is 67 years old. Many years ago cataracts closed his eyes, as they had those of his father before him. Although totally blind, he has con- tinued in active business and has supported himself and his wife, declining repeated offers of aid from a wealthy sister. Mr. Borden was reared on a farm and received a fair country school education. When a young man he en- tered the general store of Samuel D. Wetherill, at Jobstown. and soon made himself popular with the pa- trons of that establishment. In a little while his eye- sight began to fail and he JOHN E. BORDEN realized that blindness was to be his fate, just as it had been that of his father. He began carefully study- ing his surroundings and im- pressed them upon his mind. He also developed the sense of touch and hearing to a remarkable degree. During his long and sightless service with Mr. Weth- erill Borden cared for the horses, opened and closed the store, drove about the country soliciting trade, and, upon returning to the store, would put up the orders with the accuracy of a person possessing full sight. Later the business changed hands, and for the past eight years the blind man has been employed in the gen- eral implement store of O. H. Allinson. He is said to be an excellent salesman. He quotes prices, on all .cinds of machines, explains their mechanism and conducts patrons throughout the warehouse as though he were laboring under no disadvantages. When he was first employed by Mr. Allinson the latter was Collector of Taxes in Springfield township, and so great was his confidence in Mr. Borden that he would send large deposits to tank in Mount Holly by the blind man. The latter never went armed and never met a mishap. .Air. Borden readily recognizes an approaching friend. In this he seems to be guided by an instinct, as he will frequently call the correct name before a word is spoken. He can count specie with accuracy, but has some uncertainty in handling bank notes. He declines to retire from business and accept the hospitality of his sister in another town. \"This place is my home,\" he says in reply to such proposals, \"and 1 do not wish to leave it. In no other place could I have so much freedom, which carries with it a vast amount of enjoyment.\" „ INDORSE MISS A. B. FELLOWS 3oard of Directors of School for Blind Re- fuse Her Resignation.

It is the design of the institution to ar- ford \"complete and satisfactory occu- pation for the hands and minds of those blind people of Michigan who feel the need of such assistance.\" The state provides for a three years sojourn in the institution, during which time some trade is learned, and after that employment will be furnished at the institute, whereby the laborer will be enabled to pay his hoard and pur- chase his own clothes. If the laborer Is married he will be allowed to main- tain a home for his family in the city, outside the institution, coming there to oerform his work, the same as other workmen go to their places of .employ- ment. A library and reading circle will be maintained at the Institute.

For the women, housework laundry work fancy work and certain branches of the trades that the men will be taught. What the institution needs now is the names of all blind persons in the state, with their postofflce addresses. These mav be sent to J. Perrine Hamilton, superintendent, Saginaw, Mich.

They Ask the Opportunity to Make Their Own Way in Life. oiation for the Blind-, was formed for the purpose of promoting the general interests of the blind of this state. Realizing that direct financial aid could only assist those to whom it was given for a brief time at the most, the society decided to follow the lead of one of its members, W. J. Ryan, who had previously been agitating the es- tablishing of an industrial school for the adult of this state who were with- out sight. Mr. Ryan knew, from actual experience, that lack of sight need not debar any person from earn- ing a livelihood, if given the necessary training. It was for this reason that he gave his attention to the object above mentioned; and the society wisely followed his example. But the success of this movement rests, to a great extent, with the citi- zens of Maine; and it is to them that tJbose who are working for this object appeal for aid and support. The peo- ple of Maine cannot justly ignore this appeal; tlhey cannot justly deprive nearly 1,600 citizens of an education which will enable them, to become self- supporting; and yet this is exactly what will be done if they fail to aid this movement. The blind ask to be given an opportunity to make their own way in life; only this, and no i more. Is not such a request just? Is it not worthy of the siupport of every fair-minded person in this state? It is a duty Which should not be shirked, and Mr. Ryan and his associates ask that the citizens of Maine shall not fail to fulfil this obligation. William Lynch, President. BOSTON (MASS.) EVE.

Editor of The Courier-Gazette: — About a year and a half ago, an or- ganization, known as the Maine Asso- Experlment Station in Cambridge Where Afflicted Ones May Learn to Make a Living. The experiment station of the Mas- sachusetts association for promoting the interests of the adult blind, recently en- gaged at 34S Broadway. Cambridge, was thrown .open for inspection by the pub- lic this morning for the first time. There was a large attendance, consid- erably more interest being shown in the proje t than the most sanguine antici- oated. From 10 this morning until dark there was a constant stream of visitors. The association intends to provide for blind persons over 19 years of age. who are too old to be omitted to the Per- kins institution, and who need some- thing that the home teaching cannot SUFory'the aged and infirm a friendly visitor has been engaged. The principal object, however, is to attend to the wants of the able-bodied blind, and it is for them that the experiment station has principally been established. Testa with several handlooms are now being made. Competition with machine- made goods is not attempted. Articles which have value because they are hand-made and of individual design, have been successfully produced, such 'as dress goods, material for embroidery, coverings for sideboards, chiffoniers, sofa pillows, also center pieces, dollies, rag mats, -etc. While rag carpets have u°n made before by the blind, as far ad is known, this is the first time In the United States that the finer articles of have weaving have been tried. At pres- ent in the United States, broom and ma'tress making are the only shop in- dustries open to the bhnu. xn Massa- chusetts \"here are said to be 8400 blind adults! Of this number, a goodly pro- portion now work, but oil cannot earn a Pivlns by the limited occupations open o , them. There is one good shop for the blind in this state, but it employs only i5 blind workers. The real need is an ,'ncr< ased field of occupations.

William J. Ryan of Portland, the secretary of the Maine Association of the Blind, was in Waterville, this week, and furnished a copy of the petition ,or address which the society will pre- sent, to the next governor and mem- bers of the legislature. In comment- ing upon the matter, Mr. Ryan said: \"There are now three bills pending before the Legislature, for the blind, the consumptives' sanatorium and for the feeble-minded, all referred from the last Legislature. The bill for the blind ought to come first, because, if given the chance for an education 85 per cent, or 90 per cent, of^the blind will become able to earn their own liv- ing as well as the people who see. If the bill does not pass nearly all of the blind people will become public charges, or dependent upon charity, and the expense upon the cities and towns will be more for their support than is asked for their education. The institution is planned to be conducted N>along the lines of manual training, and is intended to benefit the present adults and others in the future as they arrive at the age to learn a trade. \"On my route through the State of Maine I have interviewed several of •he senators and representatives, and they express themselves as favoring he movement. I hope that the politi- cians will take these facts into consid- eration and pass this bill, as it will he a benefit to those who are in need.\" The address is as follows: \\ To Hon. William T. Cobb, governor- elect, and the members of the next Senate and House of Representa- tives of the State of Maine: A petition is pending before the Legislature of .Maine for the establish- ment of an industrial school for the blind of the State. The petition is very largely signed by citizens of this State interested in the proper care and education of the blind. There are at the present time in the State of Maine about 900 people who are totally blind, and about 600 others' who are so far deprived of their sight that they cannot see to perform man- ual labor of any kind, the most of whom are now at the time of life when an institution of this kind would enable i them to fit themselves for such kinds : of manual labor as would enable them to be independent and self-supporting. An institution like the one proposed would be valuable for all in the State who are blind and in need of such training and education as can be given only in an institution for that purpose. Many kinds of manual labor could be taught to advantage in an institution equipped for that purpose with com- petent instructors of experience. The city of Portland has offered to donate a lot in a very desirable and accessible location on the line of the electrics within the city limits. The proposition to establish an in- dustrial school is not a new proposi- tion. There are already 15 such insti- tutions in this country.

It is specially gratifying to those who know him, that Mr. William Wade, of Oakmont, Penna., was awarded a gold medal by officers of the Louisiana Pur- chase Exposition in recognition of what he has done as a humanitarian. Specifically, he is a benefactor of the deaf and the blind. Broadly speaking, he is the soul of kind- ness and generosity. Many are those whose hearts have been warmed by his goodness, and to tlie deaf-blind he has been a most loyal friend. We propose the following toast : Friends, here's to the health of William Wade, Whose life, of goodness is truly made. He has helped the needy, cheered the blind, Scattering love and kindness to all mankind. Altruist, benefactor, is William Wade; May his name and glory never fade. HEAD OF BUND SCHOOL M^EhfliTEMENT Says Students Are Properly Fed and Invites Public to Inspect Institutions. \\ SPECIAL DISPATCH TO THE FREE PRESS. JANESVILLE, Nov. 5.— In reply to the charges that the students of the state school for the blind were furnished poor food, that was unfit to eat and were not given enough to satisfy hunger, and in reply to the allegations of the stalwarts who have made the matter material for attacking the administration, Supt. Showalter makes the following public statement regarding the condition of af- fairs of the institution: \"So much has been said in the press recently about the state school for the blind that I desire to assure the friends of the school that our pupils are gen- erously supplied with good, wholesome and palatable food. We buy the best the market affords. \"I have neither motive nor desire to furnish insufficient or improper foods. \"This is a public institution. Its doors are open to, visitation and inspection at all hours of the day, and every day in the week except Sunday. Relatives and friends of the pupils, as most of them know, are cordially welcome to visit us, and satisfy themselves concerning the care and treatment of their children in all particulars, the quality, quantity and variety of the food supply Included. \"Newspaper reporters are especially invited to visit us, and write us up. I know they are always hungry for news. We will give them a good, square meal at the students' table, or at the super- intendent's table or at both. \"We will show them things about the process of educating the blind that will furnish food for reflection, as well as ma- terial for interesting writeups which will help fill the aching void in the col- umns of their papers where politics now hold high revel.\" The Ohio Harp A MAGAZINE PITHLISHGD MONTHLY AT THE: OHIO STATE SCHOOL FOR BLIND I,E01'0L1) DUHOV, BwiOB IN Omar BRNBST ROUTSON, 1IU9INE8S Manager ELLA M.

STKATTON BLANCHE CLEAVENGER CDMA GRAF-TON ALLEN MOORE EDITORIAL Perhaps no question pertaining to the interests of the blind is so important, or has been more generally neglected, than the question of the attitude of the \"Seeing\" world towards that fortunately small factor of our race which is deprived of light. Every year sees the departure from our schools of hun- dreds of blind students of both sexes, and their entrance into that seething whirlpool, called the world. Every year witnesses the unconditional surrender to a seemingly unkind Providence of, these ill-prepared combatants ; though a few, more fortunately equipped, do appear above the conflict, masters of the situation. That the latter are in a sad minority, it needs no statistics to prove. But it is not of these we would at present speak. Nor is it to all the causes which are responsible for the ultimate failure of the more numerous vanquished ones that we would call our readers' attention. One link alone in the chain of cause and effect will suffice for our present purpose : It is upon our reception by the \"Seeing\" world, that we would offer a Few, we trust, not inappropriate observations. It would seem strange, and at first thought almost incred- ible, that in our present age of enlightenment, there should exist alongside of our deservedly claimed cosmopolitanism, an ignor- ance upon many vital questions that is as profound as it is glar- ingly conspicuous. It would appear as though the capacity of the average man for obtaining and retaining knowledge is un- avoidably limited ; or, rather, that his desire to drink from the ever sparkling fountain of knowledge is continually brought into conflict with other less worthy, but to him more congenial appetites. How many of the eighty millions of good Americans who are enjoying the blessings of peace and plenty under the protecting shadow of \"The Grandest Republic the world has ever seen,\" are familiar with the operations of the machinery or its government? And yet every component part is openly exposed to the- light of day for the inspection of all. We might, if we chose, multiply indefinitely instances which would con- firm without question the truth of the proposition stated above. But we anticipate the just censure of our readers for a too length}- digression, so we refrain, being content with the sug- i for thought we have already made. To return to our theme — W e would state plainly, as we have hinted in the outset, that we believe, and believe confidently, that not a few of the many failures of our sisters and brothers in affliction, are di- rectly traceable to the sort of reception given us by the rest of the community. Some near-sighted but well-meaning souls re- gard us as especially created for the worthy end of assisting them, when their course upon this earth is run, to gain an easy admittance into Heaven. Thev bestow their charity upon us whom it degrades, with a view to their spiritual elevation. They would rob us of our self-respect, which is, fundamentally, the only distinction between man and the brute creation. Quite a large number of our neighbors take the more material view, and believe us to be an encumbrance upon society which it would be well to remove, if means were at hand. But whatever the opinions held concerning us, all, or nearly all, agree upon this, that we are strange beings, requiring other treatment than the rest of mankind. Need we, in this twentieth century, repeat, on our own behalf, Shylock's eloquent plea for racial equality? Do we in reality presume too much, when we would be treated according to individual merit, and upon the same plane with our more fortunate brethren, rather than be judged collectively by the ancient and time-honored principle of caste? We do indeed depend on others for a start on the road of life, and for some assistance at the many crossings of that rugged and thorny path ; but is not the plan of our entire social system as also of the universe, sustained by the principle of dependence ? In all the various phases of life and physical phenomena, the law is unalterable. One force or agency is dependent upon the other for the maintenance and preservation of a happy equi- librium. Isolation and independence are opposed to life in the fullest sense of the word. Of man, the viceroy of the deity upon earth, it is emphatically true. For his physical and ethical subsistence he depends upon his fellow man. Let not then the fortunate become proud and arrogant. Let not they whose enjoyment of greater blessings should increase their sense of responsibility, look down from what they conceive to be an unattainable eminence, upon their afflicted brother. But rather, let them extend and clasp the hand of perfect fellowship ; assisting, not hindering, the pro- gressive march of our race to an era. of the fullest development of all our nobler faculties, and the fullest eradication of all our baser tendencies. In conclusion, we would suggest the remedy for what we believe to be a social evil that is the more pernicious because so generally unheeded. The public mind must be educated to abandon ancient prejudices; to appreciate individual merit wher- ever found, independent of race or circumstance ; and, finally, to awaken to the full sense of the sanctity of the fair-play spirit, the richest product of our modern civilization. ■ > N>alo am adi an- \\\\L Ma ±t tht the :ia er« a 1 s : ti u w a tl o t ! ( f e Food for Thought. HOMAS K. BATES of Chicago has made the following compila- tion which should be read by every workingman and woman of America. In his pamphlet entitled \"Prisoners, Paupers, Prostitutes land Parasites,\" he makes a showing which almost staggers belief, and (yet his pamphlet is based upon statistics gathered from the most re- liable sources. The pamphlet reads as follows: The figures in this pamphlet are taken from the United States census, iBliss' Encyclopedia and Socialist publications. The statistics will be found to be as correct as it is possible to make them, and they stand as silent -witnesses in judgment over our present system of commercial cannibalise. I These conditions prevail wherever there is Christianity, education and civil- ization. The capitalist talks very little of the facts enumerated below, not that he does not know of their existence, but that the abolition of these con- ditions will prevent him from further exploitation of the working class. By taking the powers of government from the capitalist class, the work- ing class will then abolish our present system of commercial piracy and restore to their class the tools of production and distribution, eliminate rent, profit and interest and guarantee to the workers the full product of their labor. If you believe in this program as laid down by the Socialists, read the statements and conditions as enumerated below and assist us in our fight for their permanent eradication. When not otherwise stated, the figures are for the fiscal year, ending June, 1900. PRISONERS. In our penitentiaries there are 102,329 prisoners, and in our juvenile institutes there are 23,786 children. In 1850 there were 260 prisoners to each million inhabitants, and in 1900 there were 1,515 to each million inhabi- tants. In 300 years every one of us will be locked up if this ratio of increase continues. Eighty per cent, of all crime is chargeable to the conditions under which the victim lives. ' For the year ending January 1, 1903, there were 11,781 murders, 8,291 suicides, 144 hangings and 96 lynchings. In 1902 our embezzlements amounted to $6,769,125, in addition to what the capitalist exploited us of directly. Criminal arrest and maintenance cost one-ninth of our entire burden of taxation. PAUPERS. Paupers in the United States in state institutions, 83,145; in benevolent institutions, 116,836; total, 199,981. Three million of our pauperized citizens apply to charity institutions for assistance each year. We have 2,500,000 pro- fessional tramps aged from seven to seventy; fifty-seven per cent, are skilled mechanics, sixty-three per cent, are habitual drunkards, eighty-two per cent. are under forty years of age, and sixty-one per cent, embrace some kind of religion. Seventy-four per cent, of poverty is traceable to causes over which the man has no control. PROSTITUTES. We have 500,000 prostitutes and 100,000 of them die each year of dis- eases peculiar to their profession. ILLEGITIMATES. There are 63,801 illegitimate children in the United States. INSANE. Our insane asylums contain 101,009 and our feeble-minded institutes con- tain 7G.895 inmates. There was an increase of six hundred per cent, in insanity in the last fifty years. DEAF, DUMB AND BLIND. There are 33,878 inmates in our deaf - a,utl \"ffflmb asylums and 48,982 in our institutions for the blind. With the application of known medical science and surgical skill sixty-eight per cent, of the deaf and dumb could be made to hear and talk and seventy-three per cent, of the blind could be made to see. We have twenty-nine schools for feeble-minded children, with 11,217 pupils. LIQUORS We have 6,749 distilleries and wholesale liquor houses, 271,186 saloons, 191,463 bartenders and 84,752 inn and grocery dealers. Last year we con- sumed 1,140,764,716 gallons of liquors, and we paid $1,000,062,000 for doing so. We have 321 Keeley cure institutes, bi-chloride of gold institutions ana inebriate homes that have cured 710,000 drunkards.

In presenting the annual report of the Mackay institution few- the Pro- testant Blind and Deaf Mutes, the superintendent, Mrs. Harriet Ashcroft, at the annual meeting yesterday, said that there were seventy pupils an at- tendance, thirty-eight boys and thirty- two girls, of whom fourteen were blind, thirty-nine totally deaf, and seventeen partially deaf, with defective speech. The scholastic work accomplished during the term was eminently satis- factory and has been the subject of a gratifying report by the examiners. Particular attention is paid to the teaching of speech, each child enter- ing the school is given\" an opportunity of acquiring articulate language. The course of study approaches aa nearly as possible that of public schools. The trades taught are carpentry, cabinet-making, chair-caning and wood carving. The teaching of print- ing has been discontinued for the pre- sent, but may be rsumed later when there is a sufficient number of boys eligible for instruction. The girls are taught plain sewing, knitting, etc., by the housekeeper, who also gives them a knowledge of cookery. The following, constituting the hon- orary medical staff, were especially thanked for their services: — Dr. How- ard M. Church, Dr. C. H. Church, Dr. F. G. Finley, Dr. J. M. Jack, Dr. F. Buller, Dr. H. S. Birkett, J. S. NichoJ, H. J. S. and F. C. Nichol. The following list of officers is now in force: President, Charles Alexander; vice- presidents, Hon.

The Sixty-sevent* Report of the Ohio hist, for the Blind for the year ended last November, but which lias just strayed my way, is before me and 1 have read it with my usual de- light in such studies. Mr. Smead writes well, and with his fine subject, be is entirely entertaining, as well as instructive. His board of Trustees have aU» an excellent report in the little pamph- let, in which they discuss matters, from a purely business standpoint, but make very attractive reading. They show a deep and philosophical interest ill the work, and write as if they loved to do the arduous service that their stale has devolved upon thein. They refer for the fuller ac- count of their charge to the Super- intendent's report and commend the work with cordial good will to the authorities with an audacious bold- ness that almost turns one's head. What do you think of it? They ask for only Two Hundred l'hree Thous- and Dollars for this presenl year, and Ninety-li -e Thousand for oexl year. When we get the latter 8Um for two years, we think we have been liberally treated, and so we have been. We are not so rich or populous as Ohio, and still have all we need from the liberality of our dear Mountain State, and no Legis- lature has ever withheld what was needful. But to the Report again. They have installed the electric light and heating plants, in contemplation in the last preceding report, and are enjoying the comforts that such ad- ditions alone can confer. But they want more new boilers, and ask for $4500 to provide them. They want a new building for school purposes, that they may surrender the old one to the uses of living, administration, and the other necessities of a large school of the kind, and they propose to spend eighty thousand for it. They want Ave thousand dollars for each year of their biennial period for furniture and carpets, and such like conveniences. How nice it is that Ohio can nurse its institutions so well! they are allowed to want for nothing that they can use with ad- vantage to the work. I have notic- ed in another place the growth of the school in numbers. It does not appear that they use their library with as much effectiveness as they might, as no reference is made to that department of their work; but thep do not, perhaps, talk of all they do. I notice that Mr. Smead still relies very largely on the broom trade for an available means of live- lihood for his boys. It is slipping from under the feet of the sightless in consequence of machine made wares, which it is thought the blind will have to buy at wholesale instead of making, if they would engage in trade. In fact, the sentiment is strongly tending to a consensus that the prin- cipal value of any of the handicrafts lies in the training thev ffive to the hand. Manual training in the east- ern schools and in many other places, is being emphasized as never before, and with a show of propriety greater than I had been willing to think a few years ago. They teach the trades, if they teach them at all, as a means of education, rather than as a com- mercial asset . This practice is sup- ported by the best strength of the profession, and QUEEN, THE LADY'S NEWSPAPER -VJXH. Nov. 12. 1904. CHRISTMAS CARDS FOR THE BLIND.
