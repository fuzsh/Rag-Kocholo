        "text": "101ST AIRBORNE DIVISION\n\nITS MISSION: The 17,000 troops of the storied “Screaming Eagles” are scheduled to use their massive Apache helicopter firepower to help destroy the Republican Guard units protecting Baghdad. They’re helping to protect the 3rd Infantry Division as both units move across the southern Iraqi desert bound for the capital. Units from the division may get orders to seize biological- or chemical-weapons stockpiles.\n\nTHE COMMANDER: Major General David H. Petraeus, 50, a 1974 West Point grad who holds a doctorate in international relations from Princeton, has led the 101st since July. The son of a World War II Liberty-Ship captain, he has also led troops in Bosnia and Haiti. The great unknown in this war, he says, is the Iraqi will to fight.\n\n173RD AIRBORNE BRIGADE\n\nITS MISSION: Based in Italy, the troops of the 173rd are trained to parachute into hot spots—and seize them. Still at their home base, they may be called on to jump into northern Iraq to keep the peace between the Kurds and the Turks and to protect oil fields.\n\nTHE COMMANDER: Colonel William C. Mayville Jr., 42, who leads America’s only European-based airborne force, went to the 173rd after being with the Joint Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, N.C. Mayville, who hails from Springfield, Va., has a master’s in aerospace engineering. Of his 1,800 troops, he says, “Victory is our only course.”\n\n1ST MARINE EXPEDITIONARY\n\nITS MISSION: The 1st Marines, based at Camp Pendleton, Calif., are best known for winning World War II’s Battle of Guadalcanal. The force can call on its more than 100 F-18 and AV-8B warplanes and 50 AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships to soften up the Iraqis before ground troops advance. The first U.S. soldier to die in Gulf War II was a 1st Marine, who was shot while approaching an oil station in southern Iraq.\n\nTHE COMMANDER: Colonel Lieut. General James T. Conway, 55, served in Desert Storm, ran the Marine Corps University at Quantico, Va., and recently held one of the military’s top terrorism-fighting jobs. He commands more than 85,000 troops and told his soldiers, “This isn’t a fair fight. We didn’t intend it to be.” The U.S. mission, he said, is to depose Saddam, “not to lay waste to this place.”\n\n3RD INFANTRY DIVISION\n\nITS MISSION: Known as the “Rock of the Marne” for its exploits in France during World War I, the 3rd Infantry consists of 20,000 troops, some 200 M-1 tanks and 260 Bradley fighting vehicles. The unit, which saw heavy action in Kuwait during the first Gulf War, is slated to play a key role in fighting the Republican Guard after crossing the Euphrates River on its way to Baghdad.\n\nTHE COMMANDER: Major General Buford C. Blount III, a 32-year Army veteran, assumed control of the 3rd Infantry shortly after 9/11. A Texas native who graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi, he spent four years in Saudi Arabia, advising the kingdom on its military. Though concerned about chemical and biological weapons, he said before the war, “If we go to Baghdad, we are prepared.”\n\n82ND AIRBORNE DIVISION\n\nITS MISSION: The days of massive invasions by parachute ended after World War II. The 82nd’s 21st century mission is to have smaller forces quickly seize targets like airfields and secure them for reinforcements with greater firepower. In such cases, the 82nd is inserted at night by blacked-out C-130s, along with humvees and howitzers. The 4,000 troops of the 82nd’s 2nd Brigade are poised to rush into hot spots inside Iraq within hours of getting the order.\n\nTHE COMMANDER: Major General Charles H. Swannack Jr., 54, leads the “All-American Division” of the 82nd Airborne, which is based at Fort Bragg, N.C. Swannack, a West Point grad who has taught engineering, has led troops in Bosnia, Haiti and Panama. Swannack says if the 82nd is ordered to take an objective inside Iraq, he will be parachuting in himself out of the first plane.\n\nCOMBINED BRITISH FORCES\n\nITS MISSION: The British have deployed 26,000 Royal Army troops, including the famed “Desert Rats” of the 7th Armored Brigade, on the ground in the region, along with 4,000 Royal Marines. Britain’s 1st Armored Division is accompanying the U.S. Marines’ 1st Expeditionary Force in the siege of Basra. The British suffered one of the allies’ first major losses of the war, when eight Royal Marine commandos were killed in a helicopter crash in Kuwait\n\nTHE COMMANDER: Major General Robin Brims, 51, who leads Britain’s 1st Armored Division, is commander of all the British land forces in the region. Commissioned into the light infantry in 1970, he has served in Bosnia, Germany and Northern Ireland. His hope, he said before the war began, is that Iraqi troops will “join the coalition” against Saddam Hussein."
