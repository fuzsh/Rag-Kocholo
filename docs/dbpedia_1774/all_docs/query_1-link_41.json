        "text": "SYMP: Symposia should consist <strong>of</strong> focused, integrated presentations assessing current understanding regarding a particular research problem, concept, application, or educational theme. Generally, symposia should have broad appeal within the ecological community or involve integration across sub-disciplines. Symposia focused within particular areas <strong>of</strong> ecology may be considered if these are areas <strong>of</strong> particularly active research, or if the symposia <strong>of</strong>fer important new insights. Symposia may integrate historical perspectives explicitly, but this should generally be in the context <strong>of</strong> understanding current research and research questions. Presentations should <strong>of</strong>fer new results and syntheses; speakers should not simply review previous work and results. No more than 24 symposia can be accepted for an Annual Meeting. OOS: Organized oral sessions allow a wider range <strong>of</strong> thematic and conceptual options than symposia. Presentations included in an OOS must be topically coherent, but explicit synthetic overview is not required, and sessions need not have broad disciplinary or cross-disciplinary appeal. OOS’s are particularly well suited for sets <strong>of</strong> related case studies, for specialized themes, or for presenting new work that does not yet admit <strong>of</strong> the synthesis called for in a symposium. <strong>Sessions</strong> may focus, for example, on a particular conceptual question, management problem, ecological process, or other unifying theme. A strong OOS proposal will provide a broad sampling <strong>of</strong> research in the topical area. OOS’s may generate ideas for subsequent symposia. Up to (but no more than) eight speakers should be invited by session organizers and listed in the proposal; at least two speakers will be added subsequently by the Program Chair from the contributed abstracts. There is no limit on the number <strong>of</strong> OOS’s that may be accepted each year. OPS: Organized poster sessions are thematically and conceptually equivalent to organized oral sessions. Each OPS consists <strong>of</strong> a set <strong>of</strong> posters in multiples <strong>of</strong> 5. A strong OPS proposal will provide a broad sampling <strong>of</strong> research in the topical area. OPS’s may generate ideas for subsequent symposia. There is no limit on the Thursday, August 4 1 pm-5 pm CANCELED FT 1 - Big Bend National Park - Chihuahuan Desert Diversity (4 days 3 overnights) Trinity Street Lobby Field Trip Pick Up, Austin Convention Center Organized by: DJ Leavitt (dlea886@tamu.edu) Saturday, August 6 6:30 am-5:30 pm CANCELED FT 2 - The Balcones Canyonlands Preserve: Managing for Multiple Endangered Species in an Urban Preserve System Trinity Street Lobby Field Trip Pick Up, Austin Convention Center Organized by: L O’Donnell, L Laack <strong>Schedule</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Sessions</strong> Earth Stewardship: Preserving and enhancing earth’s life support systems number <strong>of</strong> OPS’s that may be accepted each year. Organized poster sessions are scheduled concurrently with the regular poster sessions on specially marked boards. COS: Contributed oral sessions are collections <strong>of</strong> submitted abstracts each organized around a common study taxon, ecosystem, subdiscipline, concept/process, or tool/application. Contributed abstracts are reviewed and organized by the Program Chairs and Program Coordinator. WK: Workshops are intended to convey specific knowledge or skills; they are not intended for the presentation <strong>of</strong> research papers. Workshops are frequently more interactive and informal than sessions within the formal scientific program, and are not scheduled concurrently with symposia, organized oral, contributed oral, or poster sessions. Workshops may involve one or several teachers/presenters, and may include computer-based or other ‘hands-on’ training. Weekend workshops may be linked with a scientific field trip. Workshop proposals should make clear what participants might expect to gain. Limits <strong>of</strong> space and time may make it impossible to accommodate all worthy submissions. SS: The ESA Annual Meetings include a wide range <strong>of</strong> events that do not conform to the criteria for the scientific sessions, workshops, or field trips. These ‘special sessions’ have included, for example, panel discussions, open discussions, lectures, and film screenings. Special sessions can permit extended dialogue, and may be vehicles for planning future events or organizations. Whatever its format, a special session should have some bearing on ecological science or education, broadly construed. Special sessions are open to all meeting registrants, although a ticket may be required for food or beverages. PS: Poster sessions are collections <strong>of</strong> submitted abstracts each organized around a common study taxon, ecosystem, subdiscipline, concept/process, or tool/application. Contributed abstracts are reviewed and organized by the Program Chairs and Program Coordinator. 7 am-6 pm CANCELED FT 3 - Endangered Species and the Military: Management <strong>of</strong> Sensitive Natural Resources on Fort Hood, Texas Trinity Street Lobby Field Trip Pick Up, Austin Convention Center Organized by: G Eckrich (gil.eckrich@us.army.mil), TJ Hayden (timothy.j.hayden@usace.army.mil) 8 am-1 pm FT 5 - A Day on the Blackland Prairie: Changes Wrought by Rising Atmospheric CO2 Concentration, the Proliferation <strong>of</strong> Exotic Plants, and Land Use Changes Trinity Street Lobby Field Trip Pick Up, Austin Convention Center Organized by: HW Polley, PA Fay (Philip.Fay@ars.usda.gov), BJ Wilsey (bwilsey@iastate.edu) 33 THURSDAY SATURDAY"
