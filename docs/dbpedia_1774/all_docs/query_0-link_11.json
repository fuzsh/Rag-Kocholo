The chief purpose of this publication is to distribute information on aero- nautics to the flying personnel in the Regular Army, Reserve Corps, T'^tional Guard, and others connected with aviation. oOo /' \\. GRTJETINOS mclA THE CHIEF 0? THE AIR CORPS It gives me grea,t pleasure to extend to every officer, enlisted man and civilian employee in the Air Corps iry earnost wishes for their health, happiness and success in the New Year. The past year has seen many marked changes and innovations in our branch of the service. \"Events across the Atlantic have brought home to the people of our nation the absolute necessity of adeqioate preparedness on all possible fiponts - man power, military equipment and military bases from which to oper- ate for the proper protection of our shores. Our :nilitary exriansion rjrograra has been launched, but it v/ill require the whole-hearted, energetic and utmost devotion of every loyal American citizen to speed this program to a successf-ul conclusion. j]ach passing day has emphasized the potency of adequate air power. We have witnessed the havoc the air arm has wrought, with consequent desolation and ruin to cities and countless casxaalties to noncombatants. V/e have been bystanders of a mode of warfare by aggressor nations where the air arm was utilized as the spearhead of attack uoon one small country after another v.dth invariably successful results. Along with this tj'pe of warfare urjon civilian popul.ations , we have seen the Air Force of Britain valiantly warding off invasion of its shores. vVe have gained many valuable lessons from the air operations of the warring nations, lessons which have made it necessary for us to modify and modernize our equipment in order to stay at the forefront of development in the matter of combat v/eaTions. I feel confident that the traditional American ingenuity, coupled with the iniative, industrious and energetic spirit charac- teristic of our people, vjill keep us at the head of the paraxle of progress. Gratifying progress has been made by the Air Corps in the training of new pilots and of enlisted men whose duty it is to keep the airplane in the air. Many new Air Corns units have been formed, and this \"nlaces a heavy burden on our pilot and mechanics schools in order to turn out the required number of trained men to fill their ranks. Many new air bases have also been established, and the coming year will call for a tremendous amount of effort to complete their construction so as adequately to house these new units . In closing, may I express my sincere appreciation and commendation for your efforts in the past. I feel s-'ore that in your loyalty and devotion to our beloved country you will redouble your efforts in this new year to insure for it a scale of defense which will prove adequate in all respects. H. H. ARWOLD, Major General, Air Corps, Chief of the Air Corps. CANTOIMENT CITY. AT HAMILTON. FIELD Construction of the sixty wooden bxxildings at the Ife.iiilton Field Army air \"base is rapidly nearing comple- tion, according to an announcement hy Captain J.H. Beal, Construction Qparter- master, and the barracks are expected to be ready for occupancy by January 15th. Included in tne pro-am are 22 barracks, each providing living facili- ties for 63 men; 3 hospital barracks,. . 4 administration buildings, 6 recrea- tion rooms, a schoolhouse, post ex- change, 5 mess halls, 5 officers' quar- ters, storerooms, and an. officers' 'mess. ' .'. A feature of the construction is the use of California redwood for frames and Ponderosa rustic pine for sidings, due to- a lack of the normally utilized Douglas fir in this vicinity. A forced hot air heating system, fed by a- central heating plant in each building, provides comfortable warmth whenever required. There are complete modem shower and toilet facilities in each barracks • • Great attention has been given to fire prevention, both in regard to lo- cation and spacing of the building and in the construction itself. A fire ■ • shield of 24 ga-u^e galvanized -iron sheet s , combined v^tn asbestos board, lines each wall. Termite shields have also been placed between all structural' framing and foundation 'walls. All roofs will be of asphalt. An, average of 200 civilian carpenters a day has been worlcing on the project , and the total estimated cost is, $343,000. . The new- installations, being built in the area south of the permanent base, will provide living, administra- tit!6 and training facilities for 15,000 men, thus increasing the present strength of the garrison by approximate- ly 50 percent . This increase is requir- ed not only to bring the tatctical Pur- suit organizations up to full strength but also to man the various echelons of the. 10th Pursuit Wing, headquarters of which have been estabM.shed at the Marin County Base. — oOo LOWRY FIELD AOTIVArsS SIX NEW SCJJADRONS Activation of six new squadrons at Lowry Field, Denver, Colo., each with a strength of 200 men, was ordered on De- cember 3, 1940, by the War Department. ■ The new organizations are to be desig- nated the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 41st and 42nd School Squadrons. Cadres of enlisted men upon which to build and administer the new squadrons are being I organized at once. I This expansion completes activation iOf the remaining Air Corps units under i the 54 Group .Program . and affects the 1 majority of the Air Corps stations j throughout the United States. ! The addition of the ]Eiew squadrons at I Lowry Field is resulting in certain or- iganization changes f Or adjninistrative I purposes and the reorganization of the i existing and new squ.aarons into four f roups. They are the First Provisional , roup, or operating group; the Second 'Provisional Group and the Third Provi- I sional Group, or the tv;o school groups; land the 21st Air Base Group (Special;, lor the administrative group. There are mow stationed at Lowry Field 16 squad- jrons, plus attached Medical, Qiarter- I master, Signal Corps , Finance and Lowry Field headquarters\" detachments and the 346th Ordnance (Aviation) Company. The four Groups are to be commanded, respectively, by Ma.jors Leo H. Dav/son, iRoscoe C. Wristoh, fiov W. Caoblin and : Captain Donald B. Smith, Air Corps, ac- I cording to a recent- announcement by j Lieut . 'Colonel Early E.W. Duncan, Com- imanding Officer of Lowry Field. A gen- I eral shalreup of commands and assign- iments necessarily will follow because j of the expansion. ; •. ■ — oOo— OFFICERS OF AIR RESERVE ASSOCIATION i.

TUfiNSPSR OF AIR COHPS UNITS An. azmouncement \"by the War Department under date of Decemoer 18', 1940, was to the effect that the o6th Pursuit Group , (Interceptor) is \"being transferred from Langley Field, Va. , to Puerto Rico for permanent station, and that the 90th and 92nd Air Corps School Sq-uadrons are t)eing transferred from Selma, Ala. , to Barksdale Field, La. , for tenporary duty. The 36th Pursuit Group (less the Air Echelon) was scheduled to move \"by motor and marching to Newport News, Va. , at such time as to enable the unit to sail on the U.S. Transport CHATEAU THIERRY leaving Bewport News, on or about Janu- ary 2, 1941. The Air Echelon, 36th Pursuit Group, will leave Langley Field so as to arrive in Puerto Rico not earlier than Jan-uary 7, 1941. The 90th and 92nd School Squadrons are \"being transferred as soon as prac- ticable to Barksdale Field, La. , for the purpose of obtaining training on Pursuit type aircraft . Upon the com- pletion of this training, a\"bout May 1, 1941, these Squadrons will return to their permanent station at Selma, Ala. Movement is to he accomplished \"by motor. The War Department made a recent an- nouncement to the effect that the 80th and 81st School Squadrons and the 68th Air Base Group (Special) will \"be per- manently transferred from Moff ett Field, Calif. J to Stockton, Calif., as soon as practicable. The three units have a total strength of about 1,000 officers, student flyers and enlisted men. Movement will be by rail and motor. The field at Stockton is a branch of Moffett Field. Student flyers in the school squadrons will be given addi- tional flying instruction at Stockton. In a War Department announcement m- der date of December 31, 1940, it was stated that on or about January 6, 1941, the following Air Corps units, totaling approximately 650 officers and men, will be transferred from McChord Field, Washington, to Fort George Wright, Spokane, Washington, for per- manent change of station: Headquarters and Headquarters Squad- ron, Northwest Air District. Headquarters and Headquarters Squad- ron, 5tli Bombardment Wing 310th Sigial Aviation Company 314th Signal Aviation Company Movement will be made by motor and rail, motor vehicles traveling in con- voy and caaiping ovemi^t on Army res- I ervations liflierever practicable. Offi- cers and enlisted men who are noi; re- quired to accompany troops by rail or motor convoy may travel by privately owned motor vehicle. — oOo I EXPANSION OF CAL-AERO ACADU^Ty The expansion of Cal-Aero Academy' s primary \"trainir^ center at Ontario, Calif., to triple its original size has 'been launched by i%jor C.C. Moseley, owner of the big field which was creat- ed last August for the exclusive pur- Sose of training Army Air Corps Flying adet s . New facilities, which will be com- Eleted by late January, include ten new arracks buildings, two new hangars, a j million more square feet of paved ran- i way, an overhaul building, and miscel- laneous smaller structures, ''ii/hen com- pleted, the huge plant will be able to accommodate 672 Cadets and 526 Cal- Aero employees. The cost of the addi- tional structures is estimated at $400,000. j A total of 231 new Flying Cadets, by 1 far the largest class yet to be sent j to the Cal-Aero Academy for primary i training, comprise Class 41-E at its three fields m California. Of the above total, 145 men were as- sigied to the new model training center at Ontario, 49 to Oxnard and 37 to Glendale . oOo GUNNERY RANG\"3 FOR BOILING FIELD Boiling Field, D,C,, recently acquired an aerial gunnery range, sit-uated north of Rheoboth Beacn, Delaware, on Cape Henlopen. The de-commissioned U.S. Coast Guard Station at Cape Henlopen was loaned to Boiling Field by the U.S. Coast Guard, and the surrounding area was loaned by the State of Delaware. The gunnery range at present is for the use of the Boiling Field officers and is under the supervision of the Post Operations Officer. Master Serge- ant A.H. Holtzman is in charge of the maintenance of equipment. Pour men are at present detailed from Boiling Field as caretakers. The former Coast Guard Station is being used for quar- ters. The Boiling Field officers have ^re- ceived considerable gunnery practice since this range has been maae avail- eible. — oOo 3- V-8680, A.C. THE IXPiNSION OF By the' News Letter SCOTT FIELD Correspondent On the Looking-G-lass prairie of Southern Illinois a new kind of a city is teing huilt. It is a city of com- ■ ' ?arative permanence for a multitude of ransients. Within its gates is quar- tered the Radio Comrnunications School of the Arnry Air Corps, an enormous feeder of the rapidly e:;5)anding ^dr Corps. . 'Years ago, Charles Dickens, the Eng- lish novelist , visited the Looking- &lass country, so named because of its flatness, heard something of the ridi- ness of its Indian lore, and wrote his impressions in his Jtoerican nptes. None then, of course, could have divined the future mission of the prairie; none could have foreseen the critical hour making necessary the building of cities such as this. At dawn the' mists lay over the field, and the land 'round about seemed •actu- ally to have been chaziged but little since those days nov/ driven deep into the past. But ivhen the softening fo^ lifts and the men in uniform hasten m. military patterns to their duties, and the tools of hundreds of worlcnen beat out a symphony, nothing reirjains of the^ old but illusions and nostalgia. You ride over the field one day and have difficulty making passage from one place to another m the areas of ' new construction; you return the next day and observe to your amazement that a road between those points has been completed. You visit the expanding precints and .are told that every day two new bar- racks buildings .are. added to this com- ■ munity of wooa and metal, of technology and disciplined man power. The smell of lumber and soil and sweat is in the air. ■ Heavy trucks bog down in sticlcy top dirt, lurch free and are driven away successfully despite other ob- stacles. So, rapidly does this city trow. So scornful of impediment is he effort toward total preparedness. ■. Shortly after the first of the year, Scott Field will have 10,000 men or more, and the cantoniTients for the 5,000 newcomers mast be ready by that time. Barra.cks, mess halls, school build- • ings, theaters, service clubs. Men , instrum.ents , parachutes , air- planes. If the government ' s ambitious plans\" are realised, the Air Corps will be three times as large as the entire present standing Army. That will mean b00,000 men for 50,000 planes, for be- hind every plane are t-wo pilots and 10 enlisted men. Scott Field's function is one of the ioost vital in the service, but the char- acter of its performance is new. Be- fore and.dxiring the first World VJar, Scott Field was a base for li^ter-than- air cre^t,,and it was to have been the General Headauarters for. the Air Corps. The nature of the reservation changed gradually in the past seven or eight years, the complete alteration talcing place v/hen the National Tlef ense prograTi was inaugurated a yeex and. a half ago. At that time $11,000,000 was authorized for a reconstruction \"orogram at Scott Field, 'now becoming the liadio •Communica- tions training cen^Eer. The old build- ings of the World War days were to be torn doii/n and to be replaced by perman- ent quarters and, in addition, tne pro- gram called for •the construction of a new hangar and officers' quarters. For barracks alone, ^1,500,000 has been snent . For a mess hall which will seat 6,000 men, Jp209,000 has been allocated; a heating unit for this building, which officers^say will be the largest of its kind in the Army, is costing another fco.ooo. . The expansion schedules required ad- ditional land; therefore, the reserva- tion spread still further into the Looldng-Glass prairies. Nearly 4,000 men are engaged in carrying out the reconstruction and snlargement pro-am, and some 1,500 workers in priva-te in- dustry are employed on the new canton- ment project, while 2,300 W.P.A. men are used on foimdation, road, and land- scaping work. The W.P.A.' crews are from, Madison and St. Glair counties and come to Scott Field by various means of transportation, one group traveling back and forth daj.iy in a hearse. It is a motley sight , the curious con- trasting vehicles of the W.P.A. workers; ■the lumbering trucks and the govern- ment's neat olive drab cars; the array of automobiles, bearing licenses from most of the 'States, ovmed by officers and enlisted men a>.t the post. It is the strange, almost fantastic, new destiny of the Looking-Glass prairie. — oOo . The 25th Bombardment Group, which re- cently arrived in Rierto Rico, flew a formation for Miajor General Franl: M. Andrews, who was aboard the TransTDOrt - AlvERICM LEGION as it arrived off \" San Juan. General .Andrews conducted an in- spection of Borinquen Field lorior to leaving aboard the transport for a tour of duty in Panama. 4- V-8680, A.C. INSURANCE By Waddell The December 15, 1940, issue of the News Letter published rates and facts about the new National Service Life Insurance v;hich is now obtainable by those in the service or who subsequent- ly enter the service. This is a re- minder that a time limit of 120 days has been imposed, after which ap'olica- tion for the insurance v/ill not be considered. As the Act was signed by the President on October 8, 1940, then the time limit for those who vrere in the service on October 8, 1940, ivill expire on February 8, 1941. Those who entered the service since October 8, 1940, or who .nay enter subsequently, will have 120 days from date of entry within which to avolv. This insurance is written at absolute cost by the Government, as the entire overhead, is assumed by the Veterans Administration. Also, the Act which authorized the in- surance provided for the creation of a separate fmd out of which all claims will be paid when such claims can be traced to the extra hazards of the ser- vice. No extra premiums are charged to cover the extra hazard of aviation. The Office of the Chief of the Air Corps is very desirous that everyone in the Air- Corps, Reserves on active duty and avi- ation trainees shall have this ins'ur- ance. This inf orrra.bion. should be tho- roughly disseminated to' all individuals now on foreign service, and any appli- cations which are postmarked withm the 120 days will be acted on. Any indi- viduals v;ho may buy this insurance may be assured that when they return to civil life they may continue their in- surance, and the premiums they pay will not be used to Toay any claims arising from the extra Hazards of the service. The unusual value of this insurance should be instantly appreciated, as the policies cover death from any cause, peace time or war time, in or out of service. Many individuals have for many years regretted not having had the old U.S. Government Insurance. They now can buy this new National Service Insurance. The time limit of 120 days is positive, and no exceptions can be made, and so it is urged that all post commanders and organization commanders continue to stress the value of this insurance to the officers and men of their command. Many of the war- time officers have 20-year endowment policies written soon after the war, and viiich will soon be maturing for their face value, vittien P. Smith 1 this money is received from the Veter- i ans Administration it must be reported I as income for tax pairposes, but the \\ amount so received is\" exempt from tax. I A test case was ruled on, and it estab- ' lished its nontaxability. For refer- ence, this case may be found in the In- ternal Revenue Bulletins and is knoi-m as I.T. - 3924, Bulletin 1939-2, page i 151. This is an interpretation of a I case under Section 3, Act of 1935. Any i Internal Revenue agent will be able to ; find this ruling, and it should be cited j in making out Federal income tax re- , ports. i \" This paxagraph is to call to the at- i tention of holders of U.S. Government I Insurance policies (not the new Nation- j al Service Insurance) that they have I the right to add a special disability I clause to their policies by making ap- i plication, passing satisfactory physical j ejcamination and paying the extra premi- ! urns required. Apiolication maybe made j at any time to the Veterans Administra- I tion, but it should not be dela^'^ed. The ! velue of this additional protection is ! considerably in excess oithe premiums I charged. ! Any disability arising from aircraft ! accident or from war service is fully I covered, in addition to disabilities \\ from health causes or accidents. In j general, its provisions are wa-iver of I all future premiums on the policy and I payment of %.75 per month per $1,000 ! of insurance without dissipating any i of the principal of the loolicy, this upon woof of disability from anv cause v'hich\" is total and e:d.sts for 120 days or more. One need not be retired from service to collect this disability, as cases are on record where disability payments have been made during disability with- out the individual having been retired. However, just the fact that an officer is retired from service d.oes not mean that he will autoinatically qualify for . this disability benefit . It is pos- sible for individuals to be retired with disabilities i^hich are insufficient to qualify, even though they may be of such a nature that they may last more than 120 days. The disability clause is of great value and should be had by all holders of U. S . Gcvemment Insurance policies. Full information, rates and application forms may be had by address- ing an inquiry to the Veterans Adminis- tration, Washington, D.C., or any of its branches. Most supply rooms at army posts have these forms m stock. V-8680, A.C. CHANGING M EHGIN3 IN NOTHING I!LAT By the Kelly Field Corresixindent During the past six months it has been the custom for engine change crews of various Air Corps fields to claw and fight each other v/ith every type of lit erature available. Our crew is ri^t in the middle of all this turmoil, and so far as records go we still lead the pack. Ilais all started a few months back vfoen ffitchel Field crew changed an engine in Wtoat they claimed to be a record time of 3:25. After reading the articles printed about this change, oiir crew decided that Mitchel Field oidn't have snything on them, except a few more experienced men. So, one hot, sultry, summer dixy they decided to set up an example of now an engine change shotild be made in the shortest time possible. This they did in the unusual time of 2:45. This only tended to throw more kind- ling on the fire, resulting in a feud that would make A. & H. College and Texas University look for the nearest exit. Two or three ti.iies in the 1^^-st three months, the 61st Squadron Sngine Change Crew had to go into high gear to hold the prestige or being the fastest crew in the country, but each time have emerged with a smile on their faces, signifying that they had knodced off a few minutes from the time set by some other organization. Now comes the climax of what we be- lieve to be one of the most bitter feuds known to this country, - a feud not fought with guns, \"out with wrenches and hard labor. This climax arrived \\hen an article was -orinted in the San Antonio EXPRESS this* past week about a crexi; at Randolph Field changing an en- gine in 1:25. After reading the ar- ticle, our crev/ could only blink their eyes and whistle for, indeed, this v/as truly a remarkable feat . But each re- solved that this was no time to admit defeat. At least, there v;ould be no harm in trying to hold their title. Monday, JJecomber 9, 1940, with the assurance of the Engineering Officer that he would be waiting to test the plane the moment the change v/as complet- ed, they fell to work. One hour and twenty minutes later, to the surprise Of all viio had been watching the deft- ness and teamwork of this crew, saw the plane take off on its routine test flight , with the new motor firmly in place and ready for many hours of fly- ing. The crew, who had predicted they could make the change in :50, was sligtitly disappointed, due to the fact that it took thera so long to change such a little thing as a motor in a BC-1 airplane, but, having one of their more experienced men absent , they were satisfied over having Icnocked :0o off the tim.e set by the Randolph Field crew. This record may not hold up for long, but they v/ill just sit back and wait for someone to say they have changed one in a shorter time. The only thing that has them stumped now is. just hov/ long it will be beiore they have to change an engine while the plane is in fli^t. If many more miniites are laiocked off the present record, this will have to be done, and so to cope vath this problem we have just ordered a large supply of helium. The crew changing this engine con- sisted of one Staff Sergeant, two Ser- geants and two Privates, only one of them havin.^ more than one year's expe- rience in e3ngine change work. The mem- bers of this crev; do not Icnow their ovrti speed, but some day, if the present pace keerjs up, witn a snap of their fingers the old motor vd.ll be out of the plans end. the new one in place. After all, they still call Kelly Field TI-IE AIR CORPS ADVAITOSD FLYING SCHOOL, so naturallv we have to keep our little brother Randolph in its ! place , and v/e are sure that none of our ; officers will have to eat any part of a I plaiie to get a motor change m short : order. Tne 61st Sigine Change Crew is, ! and will be CHAi^FS for &ome time to ! come. I — oOo — - I COWm.

WBtf CONSTHJCTKB PROJECTS FOR AIR CORPS Bowman Field, Louisville, \"Ky, Under date of December 27, 1940, the War Department announced that it has authorized the construction of an Air Corps shop hangar at Bowman Field, Louisville, Ky., costing $120,000. Con- struction projects totaling $1,178,150 are now under way at this field. The selection of Bovnnan Field as an Air Corps station was announced by the War. Department on October 4, 1940. When present construction activities, vfcich include temporary housing and other fa- cilities, are completed, the 16th Bom- bardment Wing Headquarters, the 46th Bombardja^nt Group (Light) and the 28th Air Base G-roup will be stationed there- Randolph Field, Texas. Construction was be^un on December ; 10th by the Constructing Qp-arterinaster , \\ San Antonio, Texas, and vicinity, of a I Compass Swinging Base at the southwest i comer of the building area, Randolph ' Field, Texas, at an approximate cost of ; $6,000. Under the new system, vifoereby : basic training only is given at this ■ field, the installation of the Base now! under construction will obviate the ne- i cessity of taxying all airplanes from \\ the west side of the field to the south-j east comer in order to make the neces- ; sary compass adjustments. \\ iffi. extensive surveying and mapping | ? reject, sTJonsoredby the Air Corps i raining Center and financed by a '7. P. A. I grant of $45,000 and sponsor's contri- bution of $14,000, is m progress at the four air fields in the San Aatonio area. The project was started on Octo- ber 15th, and entails the making of ca- dastral and topographic maps of Kelly, Randolph, Duncan and Brooks Fields, saaE being schedijled to be corrrpleted in ten months. r4aps are to be dra.wn on coor- dinate grid system to scales of one inch equals forty feet and one inch equals 400 feet. Contours are to be shown in certain areas to a one foot contour interval. All sewer, gas, water and other utility lines are to be shown . In addition to the mapping program, the floor plans of existing buildings and structures are being redrawn to show additions as made. The structural history of all buildings is being checked and brought up to date. About 90 men - surveyors, draftsmen, research- ers, etc., are employed. Mobile, Alabama Additional construction costing $294,341, at the Southeast Air Depot, I'fobile, Ala. , was authorized by the War Department on December 20, 1940. A total of more than $4,250,000 has now been announced for construction at this establishment . Units to occupy the new facilities will include the Air Depot Headouarters , the 63rd Transport Group,\" con^irising ■. Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron, and the 6th and 9th Transport Squadrons, and necessary service troops. About 1,000 officers and men will be stationed at the depot. Among the additional facilities to be built are 7 enlisted men's barracks, two day rooms, one officers' mess, one cafeteria-type enlisted men' s mess , one bachelor officers' quarters, two supply rooms (organization), one hospital, one warehouse and one theater. Contracts totaling $4,075,000 for con- struction of repair shops, supply build- ings, officers '' quarters, hangars and other facilities at the Southeast Air Depot have been let during the last fovir months by the War Department .

A qpSSTION OF MESS FACILITIES By the C3ianute Field Correspondent In the November 15th issue of the Air Corps News Letter, the Chanute Field Correspondoit noted the mess-hall story- written the Hickom Field Correspond- ent . Undouhtedly, they have a fine estab- lishment there, hut we of Chanute Field are inclined to thinlc that \"if you haven't seen the mess facilities at this station, you 'ain't seen nothing! \"' Now this is a strong statement to make; however, so firm are we in our convictions that we camot hut regard Hickam Field's hoast as a challenge. No longer will we hide our light under a hushel; we present this art^icle to prove that the efforts of Major Edgar T. Noyes, Mess Officer, and his staff, would make the Hickam place look like a comer lunch-stand! First, let's contrast feeding 11,000 men (Chanute Field) against that of feeding 2,800 men. At present, this station has two mess-halls, each feed- ing approximately half of the men, at the rate of 60 men per minute and ac- complishing this gigantic task in less than two hours! An average Sunday dinner, when a large portion of the men are not eating at Chanute Field, v\\/ould tip the scales at better than seven tons, if weighed ?rior to serving. In place of the\"mere on of meat,\" mentioned in the article referred to, the \"butchery staff feels fortunate, indeed, if called upon to prepare less than two tons of oeef (or whail have you) for a single dinner! And 1,500 pies, prepared by our ovai \"bakery, are usuelly served, too. Instead of the 750 quarts of milk, (Hickam' s quota for a single meal; nust imagine!), about 4,150 quarts of milk are used for suprjer each night, ^/i/hat's more, the men are receiving a quart of milk per day. The General Mess at Chanute Field was established as such in the early twen- ties, and up until the spring of 1939 was messing a total of anywhere from 500 to 1,000 men. Plate service had been the method used. An old, shabby wooden World War I hangar with a lean- to on eaxjh side served for the dining hall, the kitchen and service rooms. In the spring of 1939, and because of the prospective increase in the strength of command, the mess was converted to cafe- teria-style, with two steam tables and serving coiinters, both of local manu- facture, made out of salvaged aluminum which had been found unfit for airplane use. From thie meager beginning the principle of rapid feeding was evolved. By the fall of 1939, the General Mess had been expanded to a six-line cafe- teria, the length of the building and lean-to's increased to 240 feet. Items of mess equipment for the mass prepara- tion of food were introduced into the kitchen. Many problems not found in the comoany- size mess were encountered, met, and solved. These problems are too extensive to dwell on at any length ihere. The Ifejor told us that he plans i to cover it all in a book some day! i Suffice it to say that the key-note I problem was one of organization. This I was solved by organizing the Mess into .three sections: Tl) Administrative j (Personnel) Section; (2) Messing Sec- 1 tion; (3) Mess Supply Section, with I commissioned and noncommissioned staff \\ over each section. ' The system of feeding and the organi- ! zation so progressed that by September I 21st of this year the Old Mess, as we ; know it nowr, with only 840 seats, reach- i ed a peak of satisfactorily feeding I 8600 men each meal in sli,^tly more I than tv.'0 hours. Loyal cooperation, ! surport , and the enthusiasm of every- i body- concerned had made such a thing i possible. I On' September 21st, the New Mess, seat- j ing 1,200 men at one time, was opened i in 'the new permanent barracks . mny changes in original design and equip- : ment , based upon the recommendation and .experience of the Mess Officer and ! otxiers v/ho were constantly studying the 1 problems , had been incorporated into I the physical layout of the dining hall { and the kitchen of the new Mess. These j changes were the result of the day-to- I day experience obtained in the expan- ,j sion and operation of the Old Mess. ; Also vri-thin the New Mess building, a ■ balcery having two large evens ana all ! auxiliary equipment for mekiing bread : was installed. The capacity of the 1 balcery, as designed, was only for the 'number of \"oersonnel, 2250, to occupy \\ the permanent barracks . As operated I at present , this limited capacity re- i quires that white bread be purchased i and the bakery used to bake rye, raisin ! and v-heat bread and the pastries only. ! Both a pie machine, such as the one at ! Hickam Field, and a doughnut machine j are badly needed. The bakery is operat- ed by the General Mess Supply Section. The two messes (Old and New) were then incorporated into one General Mess, the ration strength of each mess as of this date being: For the New Mess ap- proximately 7,000 men, and for the Old Mess approximately 4,000 men. Many innovations have been incorpo- rated. For instance, two School Mess Squadrons, with an aiithorized strength of 200 men each, with appropriate grades and ratings, have been constituted to -9- V-8680, A.C. aximinister the permanent mess personnel. Daily details from organizations eating in the yiess in the ratio of one daily to each two permanent men are assigied to each Mess. All of the Mministraticn and Supply for \"both Messes are centralized imder the General Mess of- ficer with three assistant officers, one of these for the mess administration and two for mess supply. In addition, the .fess Administrative Officer is also the Commanding Officer of one of the mess sguadrons, and the Mess Supply Officer is Commanding Offi- cer of the other mess squadron. One additional officer is assigned to each mess. This latter officer, the noncom- missioned officers and all mess person- nel axe relieved of all supply and overhead administrative matters, and . are thereby ahle to devote themselves exclusively to the operation of the Mess proper. . The General Mess Steward, vfaose fTonc- tion is that of menu planning and pre- garation, is solely res'ponsiole to the eneral Mess Officer. He, too, is re- lieved of all personnel and supply mat- ters, except to plan quantities\" and de- livery dates on all meat, fish and dairy products. He informs Sirjply of his menu requirements. Menus are comiiion for each Mess, and copies of the menu, vdiich also show quantities of items to be prepared and seirved, are furnished the Mess Supply for issvie pur-ooses. The method of accounting is so devel- oped that the emct standing of the Mess is instantly available to the Mess Officer at all times. Two additional Isxge messes are now under construction at Chanute Field and are expected to bo ready by Maxch 15, 1941. Each of them will be 325 feet long, with ten serving lines, and will be capable of feeding a capacity of 9,000 men each. Thus, with all four messes in operation, approximately 30,000 men can be satisfactorily fed at Chanute Field. These new messes will seat 1500 men each at one time. They will be equipped with the latest and most modern type of kitchens, serving and dining hall equipment . Their de- siai and planning were the result of intensive study of the needs for the efficient operation of large messes. When placed in operation, these two new messes will also be incorporated into the General Mess. Menus will then be common for all four messes. The -remendous advantages in the economy of Supply and of operating personnel are self evident. Another advantage, and by no means the least, is that the quan- tity and quality of food which may be served for like value of the ration is considerably higher than in the company- size mess. The economy of the permenanb operating personnel is v/orthy or note, only three percent of the total person- nel fed being required for the opera- tion of the 10,00D-man mess, as against a much higlier percente^e for the com- pany-sized mess. Some idea of the supply problem- .may be gained v.'hen it is realized that ap- proximately nine pounds of food contain- ers, etc. ; mast be handled and account- ed for daily for each man fed. This is approximately equal to 45 tons, or two freight car loads, daily at present. We were particularly anxious to ascer- tain the outstanding characteristic of the large cafeteria mess. This we dis- covered to be its flexibility. A glance at the schedules for feeding thoroijghly convinced us of this. With two shifts of classes in the School, the feeding is virtually continuous from 5:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. daily on all week da^ except Saturc3ays. Another innovation in the Chanute Field General Mess might be of general interest, this being the system'used for encouraging and receiving ideas, suggestions and complaints regarding the mess. All personnel are encouraged to make constructive written ideas, suggestions, and complaints, signing them or hot, as they see fit. These are confidential and, where practical, are incorporated into the operation of the Mess. ^ifhile we acknowledge that Hickam Field has the largest mess hall in the Hawaiian Islands, we ask you, how cOTxLd they even remotely approach being \"probably the largest in Uncle Sam's far reacning domain\" when there is Chanute Field to reckon with? — oOo FILIOTG OF »\\ams OF STEEL.\" The Air Corps Training Detachment at Cal-Aero Academy, Ontario, Calif., was teinporarily turned into a motion pic- ture studio .

High Altitude and Its Effect on the Human Body, r WALTER M. BOOTHBY, W. RANDOLPH LOVELACE, H, AND OTIS O. BENSON The Mayo Clinic Baprinted by permiasioga of the Lostiivte of tbe Asxonsufclcal. Scieoce^, lac. Summary This paper is a report of the experimental data, mainly physi- ologic, concerning high altitude flying (up to 40,000 feet) obtained during the last two years in the Laboratory for Research in Avi- ation Medicine of the Section on Metabolic Research of the Mayo Clinic. The work has centered in the main around two subjects (1) anoxia (insufficient oxygen) caused by low barometric pressure and practical methods of its prevention, and (2) the dangers of aeroembolism and methods of avoiding the same. Training methods for aviation personnel in these subjects, and the neces- sity therefore, have been mentioned briefly. During tbe last five years, as the growth of aviation has been nore and more rapid, physiologic and medical probleas bsAre developed, irtiich are definitely dependent on and associated nitb the fact that aaa is no longer linited to the land and sea and that the ailitaiy avis)- tor soars in the air to a height of miles; he now goes higher and goes longer distances at greater speed than any other living creature. Uedical science, there- fore, ms confronted with innumerable new physiologic and medical problems and, as a result, two and a half years ago the Board of (joremors of tbe Mayo Clinic In conjunction with tbe Mayo Foundation, Ubiversity of I&nnssota, established tbe laboratozy for Besearch in ▲▼iation Medicine as part of the Section on Uetabollc Research of the Mayo Clinic. In this paper tbe authors present tbe results of thai: isiv«stig»tians with tbe hope that th^ will prove of assistaiaoe in maintaining aviators, as human machines, fuoctionlng normally 19 to 35,000 feet and with little departure from normality 19 to 40,000 feet. Kecessity for a Komal of Qiygen to Prevent Altitude Sickness To keep tbe human macblne woildng normally It must have an adequate and normal svipply of oxygen delivered at an essentially normal peirtial pressure. * Tbe ef- fect of a decreasing pressure of oiqrgen on the huoan body is well illtutrated in Figs, la to f by photogrephs taken of a burning candle at barometric pressures cor^ responding to those at elevations of 1000, 5000, 10,000, 15,000, 20,000, azid 25,000 feet. Obviously there is a marked decrease in tbe size and brilliance of the flame at increasing cdtitules. Hot only does the brilliance become less with increasing altitude, but the flame it- self beoomss onjch weaker and therefore in greater danger of being blown out. This corresponds to the weakness of * Gases are effective in the body, as in other chemical reactions, according to the gas pressure which they exert. When more than one gas is present, its fraction of the total pressure is referred to as its partial pressure. At all altitudes the air contains in round numbers 21 per cent oxygen, 78 per cent nitrogen, and 1 per cent of rare inert gases of which the chief is argon. It contains only traces of carbon dioxide, 0.03 per cent, which is the gas exhaled by the body as a result of combustion of food. -11- FiG. 1.

With ascending elevations note decrease in both the brilliance and strength of the flame ; at 25,000 feet (f ) the flame is just able to burn, and went out before the barometric pressure was decreased to that corre- sponding to 26,000 feet. the human flame and the danger of sudden collepse at altitudes in the region of 20,000 feet. It is absolutely necessary, therefore, to mftlntain a normal simply or partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs because the energy iMch rvaas the brain as well as the moving parts of this human machine is ac- tivated entirely by tbe burning or combustion of food by the oxygen ceirried by the blood stream to every cell of tbe body{ therefore each cell, even those in the more distant parts of the body, must re- ceive its regular supply of oxygen, and, what is more, the oif^gen must be delivered to tbe'^e cells es- sentially at tbe normal oxygen pressure. Ubfortu- oately it is not stafficiently well realized that the effect produced by a decrease in tbe partial pressure of oxygen in the human body is a function of both time and intensity. This point is illustrated by two exanplesi (l; At 28,800 feet the barometric pressure is 238.1 mm., of which approximately 21 per cent or 50 tm. represents the partial presstire of oxygen in the outside air - i.e., the edr to be inspired.

Tha theoretical partial preaaure of oxygen in the alveoli of the luoga can be calculated by the formulat = KB - V.P.) X 0,J - (CO,)JR.Q. where V.P. * R.Q. = Respiratory quotient which is the ratio between the volume of carbon dioxide expired and the volume of oxygen in- spired. The R.Q. varies, fundamentally, with the proportion of each type of food being burnt, fat having an R.Q. of 0.71, protein of 0.80, and carbohydrate of 1.00; however, for short periods of time, factors other than food may influence the observed R.Q. ** Acapnia is a condition of diminished carbon dioxide in the blood and is produced by hyperventilation (excessively deep and fast breathing). As carbon dioxide is one of the most important r< y.nratory stimulants, normal automatic breathing is likely to stop si'ddt-nly if too much carbon dioxide is washed out of the blood. -13- pressure of oxygen in alveoli of lungs vapor pressure saturation at body temperature (37°C.) = 47 mm. barometric pressure relative concentration of oxygen in air = 0.21 or, more exactly, 0.2093 average pressure of carbon dioxide in alveoli of lungs = 40 mm. respiratory quotient and where all pressure values are expressed in milli- meters of mercury.

Body reserves of carbofay drates aore soall as conpeored with somal reserves of fat{ therefore, within an hour after eating, the starts to e^roeush that of fat and at the end of 12 hours will usually be around 0.8. Incidentally, these curves suggest that a high carbogydrate diet nay add 1000 or 2000 feet to an aviator's ceiling; therefore, the possible advantages of supplying pilots and coi»- mercial oizplane passengers with candy (bard candy or chocolate bars) as well as with gum should be consid- ered. 7he observatloiis shown in curve B, Tig. 3, were ce»- ried out shortly after breakfast, at a time liben. the B.Q. would, on the average, fall between 0.9 and 1.0. This is to be contxasted with the results obtained by McStoland^ and his associates, idiich are shown in curve C. Bis ea^eriments were carried out under basal conditions; that is, without breakfast, and at least twelve hours after eating. Xherefore the R.Q. of his subjects would average close to 0.8, and his results, curve C, were definitely lower than those given here (curve B) and were in close agreeaent with the theo- retical curve B calculated for an B.(^ of 0.8. The possible Influience of three other factors, however, must be considered in atten^ting to interpret the slight difference in level between the authors' data and those obtained by McFarland. One of these factors is that his eoiperinents were carried out in Boston, at sea level, while those reported here were ceurried out on subjects acclinatlzed to an elevation of 1000 feet; a second factor, the influence of liiich has not yet been determined, is that Uc3tolaad used hij^ nitrogen andlow aygen mixtures to simulate altitvdes wbereas the author's soqperiments were actually carried out in a low pressure ehaaiberi a third factor, which possibly accotnts for. evidence in his curve of a cospensatoxy factor begisning at a lowar level thsn in tSw author's es^eriments is that e^arantly his subjects were \"taken more slowly and that the tine factor or a more prolcooged exposure to an increeused elevation play^ ed a role in piroducing an eeurlier recognizable coi^enp- sation by increased rate and depth of respiration. The veiy fact that the uaco^tensated curve for R.Q. of 0.8 is lower may stiomlate an eeurlier atteiqpt at coqpensar tion and as the direction of the coiqpensating crirves in both ea^eriments indicate, the final consensated partial oxygen pressure may be within practical limits identical for any B.Q. It is in|)ortant to note in Ilg. 3 that the atverages of the deterndnation of the alveolar csygen at ascend- ing altitudes made in the low pressure obambar, curve B, correspond very closely to the theoretical curve A to about 12,000 feet. Above this elevation the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli becomes inr> creasingly higher than the theoretical curve; the lat- ter is based on the MSUB{)tlan that the bo^ does not coa^ensate. Sowever, the fact that there is a corres- ponding decreeise in the alveolar ceobon dioxide pres- sure, Curve B^ indicates that the body actually is able to ooBpeosate to a certain linited degree by byw perventilatlon. A slodlar tendency for the body to to cospensate is evident in the carbon dioxide curve in liolkrlaiid's data as shown by Curve C' However, while the possible significance of the sli^t differences between the ea^erimental data given here and those of IfBtRulaad hatre been stressed, it is ioport- ant tbat the mala foots brox^ out by the two series of eoperiaants be not obscured; namely, (l) that both positively indicate a progressive ai^ essentially simi- lay decrease in alveolar oxygen pressure with ascending altitude; (2) that this relationship of barometric pres- sure to alveolar oxygen pressure is linear up to about 12,000 feet and that above this elevation pl^iologie conpensation is evident. However, as both series of eoqperiments were carried out with msticulotis care xaoder their respective oonditians, it is, for the present at least, permissible to draw attention to the possible significance of the dissimilarity in the data fr(» tha two laboratories, especially as the oagnlttde of the divergence referred to seems to be in accord with theo- ry, dependent en the differences in conditians. The average alTSolar oxygen pressure in the lungs con be increased definitely by slow deep breathing, as shown in Tig. 4 and the snriaior's \"ceiling\" increased tenporarily Iqr as much as 1000 or 2000 feet. It must pressure 5 lb Altitude - thousands Fig. 4. The effects of slow deep breathing of air as opposed to normal breathing on alveolar oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures at various altitudes, be obeerved.faowerer, that the alveolar oxygen increas- es and alveole,r iai-bun decreases with deeper respiraf tion. The decrease in carbon dioxide is dangerous be- cause through its effect on the lydrogen-ion concen- traticn of the blood it is a direct respiratory stlBi>- lant and is the chief factor in rendering breathing antooatic. Whan the alveolar carbon dioxide is de- creased, if the aviator is absorbed in fighting ha nay forget to breathe voluntarily and beoosM uoconaoi- ous from lack of oiygtn before there is an automatic stioAilatian of respiration by reaccumulation of car- bon dioxide. flying at or above 16,000 feet for any consideiable time causes fatigue - more fatigue, increasing both with an increase in elevation end with an increase in l«gth of time, than results from correspondingly se- vere mental and physical work at sea level.

The fail- ure to use osygeo wbaa flying above 10,000 feet aggr wall shorten the active flying life of en abator and octy ground his nany vears earlier than would be nseessasy provided that (l; he always had an adequate nggly of oxygaa ewailable, and (2) h« alwys pr«ipsrly used sueh equipMBt. Pilots and crews should act ascend to hei^^ts in ex- cess of 15,000 feet (or in excess of 10,000 feet for aiore than short periods) without adequate oxygon equlp- Bent to maintain a nonsal pressure of oxygen in the lungs. It is now possible to ascend to 33,000 feet with proper equipmeat and training and to hove an absolutely nonnal ozygan pressure in the lungs, brain and nuseles. By the use of appropriate oxygen inhalation epparatus the rates of oxyF<n flow required are reasonable froa ths point of view of anriation eoonoi^. However, 30,000 feet is about the vggmr practical limit physiologically speakiag for coamercial acviation becanse of the danger of rapidly developing ooooasclouaaess if the aviator shoxild ranovo the ooygan aaak. in elevation of 40,000 feet is the tsper pxaeticahle limit that oaa he atteiyt- ed in militsoy aviation even with the aid of the inhal»> tion of absolutely pure oxygan, perfect equipment, and advanoed trainljaa . beoause at altitudes above 33,000 feet the sum of the partial pressures of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vipor becomes the total pressure in the lungs and progressively nd rapidly decreases below normal even if no air with its hi^ (80 per cent) nitro- gen content is permitted to leak in.' Although the par- tial pressure of oxygen in ths alveoli at an adtit\\^ of 40,000 feet, when pure oxygen is being breathed, corres- ponds to that at 11,000 feet idMn air is breathed, yet the altitude of 41,000 feet and especially of 42.000 feet is aoctremely dangerous as con be seen from the steepness of curve B (Tig< 5) because there is no leeway or margin of safety, and collapse and uaconsciouaness would develcp rapidly at an elevation of 43,000 feet or even at 41,000 feet if a trace of air leaked in.

Uethods of Prevantiag iaoada (Oannwn lasuffioiepcy) There are three differant principles on idxich methods of coapansatlng for the decrease in partial pressure of ozygn at hig^ altitudes aay be basedi Tl) the styerchargad cahin using air under pressure, (2; the closed circuit osyg«i systaa, and (s) the opan circuit oocygan systaau Supercharged Cabin. Sxyerdharged cabins ia whicb ths air pressure iasida is tacreased to 1 or more pooods per square indl above tha aoAemal atmo^horie pressure are, of oourse, ideal from all polats of view for long distanoe laad and tranaoeeaaio aoanor- oial flying. Sueh planes ham been developed aad proved ooanereially praotical. Whether or not ths extra construction weight (with loss of pay load) as well as increased oost of canstraetlan and maintain aaoe can be reduced ao that this method oan be ex- tensively used on snail t^^es of aircraft remains to be seen. Closed Circuit System. The most eoonomical priiw oiple for the administration of oxygen is, of course, the closed circuit systeau By auch a aystem is neeat a closed, circuitous pipe line approxlaately 1 iaoL inside diameter, with an Ki^aasible chamber or bag of a oqpaoity of not less than 5 liters for a siQgla ii^ dividual althou^ this ratio wnild aot have to he mlTitalTvad for multiple vnits) a contaiaar for soda lias or similar substance for absorhiag oorboa dio»> id«{ a dreulating puop if the system is multiple, or a properly placed Inspiratory-ei^izatoxy valve whan the system is constructed for use by only one individnali aad an absolutely airtight faoe mask, large reducing valves and autoaatic controls must be fuRiished to regulate the s\\pply of oxygan. Both in tha lahosatoiy and level flying, this type of spp«^ ratus is paxtieularljr eoooaoalcal, aa tbeorwtically the total amovnt of osygega xtaeded sbould not exceed the amovaat of oxygen each ixadlTidual actually bxixns, nhieh is approxiaately 0.25 liter at standard temperature sod pressure dry (S.T.P.S.) per minute for a pilot 1630 is relatively inactlTe vp to 0.7 liter (S.T.F.S.) per min^ ute for an actiye neisber of the er«« nozldxtg or soving about in the plane. The practical objection to the closed circuit system is thai air can easily leak into the system arotxid the ■ask or oany other places causing a dangerous accuaittl»- tlon of aitrogea. For this reason the netbod is not used in oonBercial aviation and also has prored too daoF- garooa for artenaiva aiUtaxy use. Turthamora, the acomoiigr the use of oxygen is not as great in anriation as one would at first suspect fron theory because of losses oceurriag during rapidly alternating ascent and descent. During descant the oxygen in the system will be ooopressed and the yoluaie decreased, thxis autonatic- ally activating the oxygen sv^tply -valves. On the fol- lowing ascent, the oxygen would nrpmA with the de- crease in baxooietric pressure, and the oxygen would be lost throu^ the escape or pressure safety valves. Sa- pid alteroation of such procedure vnuld be very wasteful of the oxygen reserves. Open Circuit Apparatus. The other t>pe of e^aratus is kxiown in the physiologic lehoratories as an \"open circuit epparatust\" that is, the air is inspired with the addition of an appropriate asotat of txt^m. and then e:9ired directly into the surrounding air with only a very siaall, incidental aaowtt of rebreathiag. In the open circuit tjfpe of appaxatua no atteopt is nada to X9- Bove the oarbui dioxide so that no aora than a vary saall aaount of tba eopirad air with ita anriehad oxygen content can be uaad again. However, such a systen, to be eoonoadcally of praetio- al val\\ie in aviation or in clinical RMdiciae for adoizt- istration of oxygwi, oust contain a reservoir bag, in order to collect, save and have ready for use on the next inspiration, the oxygan that has been flowing from the tank during eopiration. As the oajor part of the inspiratory phase of respiration is only from a third to a fifth of the respiratory cycle, it is obvious that uo- less n-jch provision is nade, only a third to a fifth of the oxygan s\\)pplied can be utilised. We wish to ei^ba^- sixe this point because aany wonder about the necessity of a reservoir bag. IVdlure to use niore than a third to a fifth of the oxygan flow is one of the sanay reasons wi^^ the oldi-faahioned '^ipesten^ nathod was so ineffici- ent and ia now little used. Eowaver, to prevent tba accunulation of an axcaaaive and unbearable aaomt of oarbon dioxide in auoh a reaer- voir bag, one auat use aithar a aaall bag with a capaci- ty soowi^t leas than an average noroal ei^iration (450 c.c. ) or else prevent, by other rather coiqplioated means, the aoqpired air from entering a larger baig. This reservoir bag is preferably placed close to the nask. However, it can be placed at the end of a long corrugat- ed rubber tube (l inch in diameter) provided (l) that the bag does not exceed a capacity of 450 c.c, (2) that the fresh oxygea intake is led directly into the bag,and (3) that the automatic spoBge rubber air regulator or ex- piratory valve is close to the mask. Tor most purposes, both in aviation and in therapy, it is preferable to hsere the bag attached directly to the mask. B.I1.B. Oxygen Inhalation Apparatus As the original apparatus desisted by Boothby, Lov»- lace, and Bulbulian ^•^•^•''tdhas been described els^. i^re in detail, only the recent ioproveaents will be mentioned here. 9 She chief of these is that a sponge rubber, automatic air regulator haa bean substituted for the rather conplioated natal connecting-regulating de- vice. At low altitudes mixtures of air and oxygen are used{ at altituies of more than 30,000 feet prao- tically nothing but pure oxygan from the tank is used. By a proper setting of the oxygen flow the amount of additional air required is svpplied auto- matically through the sponge rubber disc. The sponge rubber disc causes just sufficient resistance so that no appreciable air enters the bag on inspiration uo- til the reservoir bag is coapletely collepsed; con- versely no appreciable amount of air passes out through the sponge rubber disc until the reservoir bag is eoi^letely distenied. After the bag is ex- tended or distended completely the air paaaea through the aponge rubber diao with acarcely noticeable re- aiatance. Fig. 6. Nasal type of B.L.B. oxygen inhalation appa- ratus for coiniiKTcial aviation and for oxygen therapy; a, mask and bag; b, diagram showing direction of air current during brcalhinst. The nasal type of assk (Fig. 6a and b) with the mouth free for talking or eating is preferable for use on connercial airlines both for crew and passen- gers as the elevations to which they go rarely exceed 15,000 feet and at the most 20,000 feet. For militaiy aviation, the oronasad type of nask (?ig. 7) is preferable for two reasons t First, dur- ing the aacciteaent of combat the flyer night need to breathe through his mouth, and aecond, he would often go to nuoh greater altitudea (35,000 to 40,000 feet). In order to be able to uaa the radio microphana ef- ficiently, a little turret waa constructed directly opposite the mouth to hold the sponge rubber disc and aigainst which the mierophone may be closely e^- plied. There is little or no interference with the transmission of sound waves if the sponge rubber au- tomatic adr regulator is placed in a specially coi>- etructed groove at the outer end of the turret; in fact at high altitudea increased efficiency is ob- tained in part by exclusion of extraneous noise. Furthermore, this is an ideal situation for the 8ipong( rubber disc because it is so close to the mouth that a greater part of the expired air with its moisture oantent will pass out through the sponge rubber with- out freezing even if the tenperature is very low. In fact, tests have shown theit oot enough moisture will accunulate and freeze to render the apparatus inef- ficient in aa hour even if the tenperature is as low as -30°C. (-22'*r.). This time can be prolonged by squeezing the turret end reservoir bag to \"de-ice\" them or break tp any ice that may be collecting. In the ailitaxy model, arctic rubber is used i^ch will 15- aot bMoae stiff for at least an hour ak •>40°C.(-40ar.)l It Is absolutely essential, of course, that the rese:>- volr hag he aade of ruhher vbich nnlntalns lis flezlhll- lt7 at low taq^azaiures.

EFFECTS OF HIGH ALTITUDES ON OIL POMP OPERATION By the Materiel Division Correspondent With Air Corps pilots flying their planes at higher levels these days, the increased operation at high altitude has resulted in new engine problems to \"be solved. The Power Plant Laboratory of Wri^t Field has just completed a series or tests growing out of reports received from several pilots, operating at hi^ altitude, v4io' observed a loss of engine power, accompaaied by a loss of oil through the breather outlets. In all of the cases it was noted that the al- t it-ode was 25,000 feet or more. The tests have indicated that the dif- ficulty is that of inadequate oil scav- enging, so that the various parts of the engine \"load up\" with oil, thereby decreasing the power output . In some cases when oil is thrown out of the breather pipes, subsequent engine fail- ures have been reported, due to insuf- ficient lubrication. The Power Plant Laboratory of the Materiel Division has investigated and studied this subject quite thoroughly by conducting bench tests and multi- cylinder engine tests in an effort to solve the problem. The bench test was performed by mount- ing an aircraft engine oil pump on a test stand and driving it with an elec- tric dynamometer, using equipment for measuring oil flow through the pump. Altitude conditions were simulated by means of vacuum attachments to the pump. This type of test is very effective in studying the operating characterist- ics of the pu.np alone. However, when the pump is installed on an engine there are restrictions to oil flow which are not enco-untered in a bench test. In order to reproduce actual airplane installation conditions, as far as possible, a molticylinder engine test was made. After the engine was installed on the test stand, oil was admitted to the en- gine until it flowed from the breather outlets. Xiider these conditions the test was started, observations made, and conclusions dra-'n.. From these experir.iental tests, and observations of^ actual conditions in airplane installations, it v/as found that there was deciaed similarity in many instances under both conditions of observation. Fro.n these observrtions and tests it has been possible to con- clude that the oil scavenge capacities of engines in which this difficulty oc- curred are not great enough and require oil scavenge pumps with greater capaxii- ties, as it has been shown that success- ful operation of an oil pump can be had only when the minimum capacity of the scavex^ing side of the pump is greater than the maximum flow of the pressure side for any given speed, teinperature, pressure and altitude. Althoogh steps have been taken to remedy the above-mentioned difficulties. Air Corps personnel iiay experience trouble until the lohysical changes have actvially been made. — oOc N.A.C.A.

The class i':iraediately assumed its responsibility in creating customs, traditions and standards to pass on to the many classes to come, an attitude all the more commendable in the absence of an upper class. Arriving on Tuesday, the class com- menced its flying on Thursday, after an intensive' period of military indoctrina- tion, ilying has continued hours ahead of schedule, and the Flying Cadets were looking forward to a few days' Christ- inas leave.

The Southeast Air Corps Training Cen- ter authorities ore already perfecting arrangements for the occasion and hope to malce it a gala affair. The gradua- tion will be the first held at Maxvrell Field since last July, vAien it was con- verted from an Air Corps Tactical School. The program will include an address by a ranking officer of the Air iorps, the presentation of \"Wings,\" di- Slomas and commissions in the TITS. Army ir Corps. Reserve. All sEvo two of the 102 Flying Cadets are eligible for commissions as second lieutenants in the Air Reserve. The two excerited Cadets are below the pre- scribed age of 21, and they will remain at Maxwelx Field - one until January 2Sth and the other until February 17th , when they will reach the age of 21 , and they will then be commissioned. Two members of the class, who are of- ficers in the Regular Anny - Captain Stanley T. Wray, Corps of Engineers, and Lieut. John W. liTatt, Jr., Field Artillery, are to be transferred to the Air Corps in their respective grades. Just recently the students began their fifth week of training and, fol- lowing several days of inactivity caus- ed by low clouds and rainy weather, again took to the air. While grounded V-8680, A.C. by weather conditions the students con- centrated on ground school activities. Along the middle of December the Cadets at the Advanced Slying Sdiool were scheduled to begin six-plane for- mation flying in ad.dition to continuing the three-plane formations inaugurated ten days previously, as well as parti- cipating m night cross-country flights, rad-io code practice and attending lec- tures on Pursiiit Aviation, squadron du- ties of junior officers and military training. Cadets at the Basic Flying School, commanded by Lieut. Colonel Aubrey Homsby, are also ahead of schedule. This School expects to enroll its fourth class of Cadets and student officers about January 1, 194D. Six more Basic Training airplanes recently arrived at the Municipal Air- port , Montgomery, Ala. , piloted by of- ficers who ferried them from the v-ultee Aircraft Pactory at Los Angeles, Calif. 'Captains George Schlatter and Robert E.L. Choate were in charge of the pilot detail . Beginning their cross-country and night flying missions, students at the Advanced Flying School, Maxv/ell Field, are inaking Iheir cross-country flights to Troy; Dothan; Sofaula; Lawson Field, Ga. \", Wetumpka and back to I'texwell Field, with Lawson Field as the only landing point on the itinerary. These flints are made in three-ship forma- tions with rotating leadership. Ni^t flying is local, conducted from 1730 hours to 24 hours (5:30 p.m. to 12:00 midni^t) from Tuesday to Friday, in- clusive. Basic combat training planes, known as BC-lA's, are used on the cross- comtry and night flying missions. This class commenced training at the Advanc- ed School on November Ibth. A recent anno\\mcement by Colonel Galloway was to the effect that 32 ad- ditional flying instructors were to be detailed to Maxwell Field for Class SE 41-B, scheduled to commence about December 28th.

The transfer of about 700 officers and men from Maxwell Field, Ala. , to the Specialized Flying School at Selma, Ala. , was accomplished along about the middle of December, the men being trans- ported by motor convoy. Units moved to the Specialized School were the 90th and 92nd School Squadrons and the 67th Air Base Group, less the Second Materiel Squadron. Most of these men have been in training at Maxwell Field for the last few months. Bombardier and Pursuit training mil be given at the Air Corps Specialized Flying School at Selma, which is one of several large units \"under the Jurisdic- tion of the Southeast Air Corps Train- ing Center, Maxwell Field. FROM PRIVATE TO \"TOP KICK\" IN TM MONTHS Lawrence B. Halter enlisted in the Army at Canton, Ohio, on January 1.7, 1940. Prior to enlisting, he had been employed in a storage battery plant and was malting a very excellent salary. Halter, however, believed that the Army offered a pretty good career to a fel- low who really wants to go places, so he Joined up. He was sent to Langley Field, Va. , and on May 6, 1940, after five months of service, he was made a Corporal. Three months later, on August 27th, he was made a Sergeant. On September 21st , he was transferred to Mitchel Field, N.Y. , and on October 4th was made a First Sergeant .
