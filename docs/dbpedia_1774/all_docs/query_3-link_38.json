        "text": "Despite plans for massive anti-war protests during President Bush's visit to London this week, an ICM poll published in the Guardian newspaper suggest more Britons support the visit than don't, few think America is dangerous, and support for the Iraq war is rising.\n\nThe air activity Tuesday was centered around Baqouba, 30 miles northeast of Baghdad. U.S. jets and Apache helicopter gunships blasted abandoned buildings, walls and trees along a road where attacks have been so common that troops nicknamed it \"RPG Alley\" after the rocket-propelled grenades used by insurgents.\n\nFighter-bombers dropped 500-pound bombs and battle tanks fired their 120mm guns at suspected ambush sites, the military said.\n\nElsewhere, F-16 fighter aircraft bombed insurgent targets near the town of Samara, about 60 miles north of Baghdad, the military said.\n\nThe stepped-up military operations followed an escalation in insurgent attacks over the past three weeks. In response, the U.S. military announced \"Operation Iron Hammer\" aimed at striking at suspected rebel targets before insurgents have the chance to attack.\n\nThe strategy appeared aimed at showing U.S. resolve as Washington prepares to hand over political power to a new Iraqi provisional government by the end of June. However, the heavy hand risks further alienating an Iraqi population already chafing under foreign military occupation.\n\nDuring a news conference in Baghdad, Swannack, whose division is responsible for Anbar province, said the robust tactic \"demonstrates our resolve.\"\n\n\"We will use force, overwhelming combat power when it's necessary,\" he added.\n\nSwannack, whose troops patrol such hotspots as Fallujah, Ramadi and the borders with Syria and Saudi Arabia, said he believes most of the insurgents are Iraqis.\n\n\"Ninety percent of the cases are from regime loyalists and (Iraqi) Wahhabis,\" he said. Wahhabis are members of a strict Islamic sect that dominates Saudi Arabia and has followers in Iraq.\n\nHe said 13 foreign fighters were recently captured in Anbar province and seven were killed. He did not have their nationalities nor other details.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. forces are pulling out of some hotspot towns to hand over security powers to Iraqis.\n\nSwannack said he will withdraw his troops from the center of Ramadi, capital of Anbar province, by the first of the year, following a pullout from the town of Samara the past weekend.\n\nSwannack said the Americans would be able to move in quickly in Ramadi if problems arose, an assurance also made by officials in Samara. But the Iraqi civil defense chief in Samara pleaded for the Americans' return.\n\n\"We cannot handle this on our own,\" Capt. Ihsan Aziz told The Associated Press, saying looters and pro-Saddam guerrillas could move in to fill the vacuum.\n\nParatroopers searched neighborhoods in Ramadi late Monday, detained about a dozen people and seized explosives and other materials for making roadside bombs, a major threat to American troops, the 82nd Airborne Division said.\n\nThe statement said one man was arrested after troops found \"jihad signup sheets\" in his house. The man, who was not identified, was suspected of financing and supervising the placement of roadside bombs around the city, the division said."
