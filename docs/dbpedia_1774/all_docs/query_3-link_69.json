Chairman Tom Davis. Good afternoon. We are going to go through two opening statements before we get to our witnesses, so take your time getting to your seats, the witnesses. A quorum being present, the committee will come to order. We meet today to look into the complex task of coordinating contracts amid the chaos and challenges of rebuilding Iraq. Even before the conclusion of major military actions, there were plans for a major effort to rebuild Iraq's infrastructure and government. Emergency supplemental appropriations bills for both fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 have provided more than $20 billion to rebuild postwar Iraq. Many Federal departments and agencies have already awarded or soon will award contracts for the sustainment and reconstruction efforts. The rebuilding of Iraq is a monumental task. Saddam Hussein spent decades frittering away his nation's vast wealth on himself and his Baath party cronies, while little to nothing was spent to meet the urgent needs of the Iraqi people. Decades of neglect and inaction have turned this once great nation into a country where the majority of people live in poverty and despair. However, with Saddam's ouster, we are witnessing a rebirth of Iraq. Freedom and liberation have brought a new sense of urgency to the Iraqi people. They understand what is at stake; and we, as part of the coalition of the willing, must do our part to sustain freedom by rebuilding their nation. Twenty days ago, I, along with other members of this committee, returned from Iraq where we witnessed the enormity of the reconstruction effort. This was my second trip, and in the 6 months since my last visit to the region I saw significant progress in our reconstruction efforts. The task at hand is enormous. It will be years before we are able to get Iraq running on its own. Yet each day Iraqis are getting a better life, thanks to the dedicated American soldiers and civilians working there. Our reconstruction efforts are being completed under even life-threatening conditions. Our military is nothing short of superb. Besides ensuring the safety of the country, they have become master builders and diplomats. The use of funds from the Commanders Emergency Relief Program paves the way for local and regional stabilization by allowing for small rebuilding projects that have an immediate impact on the local population. For example, we recently met with General Odierno, Commander of the 4th Infantry Division, who told us how he used his CERP funds to build a water treatment facility in Tikrit and a sewage treatment facility in Baji. In many ways, the Commanders Emergency Relief Program is meeting the immediate needs until our larger construction projects are completed. The positive offshoots of the Iraqi rebuilding effort are beginning to take shape. Entrepreneurialism is sprouting; and unemployment, which was once a major problem, is coming under control. Our efforts are paying off. Reconstruction, together with an interim constitution, locally elected leaders and a functioning, better-trained security force all add up to a stable and more peaceful Iraq. Today we meet to specifically discuss the complexity of coordinating our rebuilding of Iraq, primarily as it pertains to the larger construction projects and sustainment efforts. Currently, there are many U.S. Government agencies working to improve conditions in Iraq. For example, the Department of Defense, including the U.S. Army of Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Agency for International Development, are both working to rebuild Iraq. Both DOD and USAID have their own procurement shop, their own management team, and their own audit mechanisms. The committee is interested in the efforts made by each agency to manage and coordinate acquisition activities to ensure that taxpayer money is spent both effectively and efficiently. In addition, enormous amounts of money have already or are about to be expended in the efforts to rebuild Iraq. We need to make sure that acquisition rules are being followed. Congress has spent years streamlining complex government rules and regulations to make it easier for businesses to sell to the Federal Government, but did so in a way that carefully balances affordability, accountability, and accessibility to make sure taxpayer dollars are protected. It's our job to make sure that these things are happening in Iraq. We hope to learn today how our acquisition system and the professionals who run it have responded to the challenges raised in Iraq. No one doubts that the circumstances are extremely difficult. I've seen the chaos on the ground there. The security situation is tenuous at best. Our servicemen and women are being killed and wounded. A number of contractor employees have also been killed and wounded. Large-scale procurements are complex and difficult to understand in and of themselves. When it comes to procurement, if you're not confused, you're not paying attention. Add in the urgency and inherent dangers of contracting in a war zone, and the challenge of acquiring urgently needed goods and services becomes quite daunting. Through this hearing we hope to separate fact from fiction, truth from rhetoric, and in turn help make sure we are coordinating contract processes in Iraq in a way that ensures success and safety. Fortunately, our acquisition laws have been carefully crafted by Congress to provide enough flexibility for the government to quickly get the goods and services it needs in emergency situations. There are provisions in the acquisition laws that allow for carefully circumscribed exceptions to our standard for full and open competition to provide for a more limited, less time-consuming award of contracts for urgently needed supplies and services. I frankly cannot think of a situation that would better fit within these flexibilities than what we faced on the ground when we came into Iraq. Sometimes we just don't have time to take our time. I find it ironic that those who are complaining that the government doesn't have sufficient people on the ground to oversee and administer the current contracts in Iraq would foster contracting strategies that would increase substantially the need for contract administration. For every complex problem, there is a simple solution that doesn't work. I recognize that there have been mistakes. The contract oversight process is not always pretty, and the decisions made under the pressures of combat are not as always as lucid as those made under less-threatening conditions. I commend my ranking member and others who have raised some important questions pertaining to the reconstruction process. Today I hope we can differentiate between real issues worthy of serious inquiry and those with little or no basis in fact that are raised solely to create a whiff of scandal. There are some who have disagreements with contractors overpayments, and it should come as no surprise to anybody who's familiar with the administration of complex contracts in difficult circumstances. These difficulties should be viewed within the context of the wartime environment in Iraq. Many of the disputes that have been made public show that the contract oversight process is indeed working. This hearing is part and parcel of a functioning oversight process. Make no mistake, I have no patience for fraud or abuse. I expect that any such instances that are proven will result in harsh punishment for the perpetrators. I also expect that, as the conditions on the ground improve, the next generation of contracts will be awarded and administered in accordance with our standard acquisition procedures. Emergency procedures are for emergencies only. This is a monumental task, and there is no room for error. Nor is there room for partisan sniping aimed merely at undermining the overall reconstruction efforts. We are interested in the truth, not rhetorical calisthenics. We are interested in helping coordinate the many important contracts in place today or planned for the future. In short, we are interested in moving forward with a contracting framework that benefits our reconstruction goals. We are not interested in simply repeating disingenuous sound bites. Now, pursuant to committee rule 14, following the witnesses' opening statements, the ranking minority member and I shall each control 20 minutes in order to permit some important but complex lines of questioning and allow adequate time for full responses. Following the 40-minute questions, we will continue under the 5-minute rule. Mr. Waxman and I have agreed that we don't expect any votes today at this point. He has asked--requested of us that a number of documents be released from this committee. I understand that DOD has gone on their own volition and that these documents have been released. We are also joining with him in a request for more documentation from the Department of Defense reiterating an earlier request for some of these documents, and we join him in this. If when we get the responses back, they are not adequate, we will then address what further avenues we may wish to pursue. In the interests of time and given the 20-minute block agreement I have made with Mr. Waxman, we are limiting opening statements to the ranking member and myself. But statements will be included in the record, and you will have 10 calendar days to do so. I also want to thank all of our witnesses for appearing before the committee, and I look forward to their testimony. I also want to recognize a new member of the committee, the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Tiberi. We have had a couple of vacancies on this committee, and we are very happy to have him here. We understand he is going to be here for the entire hearing, and we appreciate it. Thank you. At this time, I will yield for Mr. Waxman's opening statement. [The prepared statement of Chairman Tom Davis follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.001 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.002 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.003 Mr. Waxman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this hearing today. The subject we are going to consider, contracting in Iraq, urgently needs congressional oversight. It is an issue that has crucial implications for the success of our efforts in Iraq and for U.S. taxpayers. Usually I keep my remarks short at committee hearings, but today I am going to speak at some length in this opening statement. I have been investigating contracting in Iraq for many months and I believe few of my colleagues understand just how big a mess this administration has created. I want to explain to the members of this committee and the public what is going wrong and why. The problem starts with the procurement strategy that the administration is using in Iraq. It is profoundly flawed. I have a chart that I want to display. It is over there. The chart shows two numbers, the first, 2,300; 2,300 is the number of discrete reconstruction projects that the coalition provisional authority is planning to do in Iraq. The second, zero, is the number of projects that will be subject to competitive bidding. Instead of promoting competition, the administration is giving contractors monopolies over huge sectors of the reconstruction effort. One company, Halliburton, gets all work related to oil reconstruction in southern Iraq. Another company, Parsons, gets all work related to oil reconstruction in northern Iraq. And they never have to bid against each other for any specific project. The administration has a procurement strategy that intentionally shields contractors from competition. Think about this: For nearly a year both Halliburton and Bechtel have had enormous operations in Iraq. Both companies can do virtually the same work. But never once have they had to compete against each other for a specific project. This is a great deal for Bechtel and Halliburton, but it is an absolutely horrendous deal for the taxpayers. These problems are compounded by the fact that many of the contracts that are being issued are cost-plus contracts. Under a cost-plus contract, the more the contractor bills, the more money the contractor makes. That is why cost-plus contracts are notoriously prone to abuse. In the absence of competition to discipline the process and to hold down prices, the taxpayer has to rely on contracting officers working for the Defense Department to keep prices reasonable. These officials are supposed to scrutinize the proposals submitted by Halliburton and other contractors and reject those that are loaded up with unnecessary expenses. But they are inexperienced and overworked. Representative John Dingell and I asked GAO to investigate what kind of job the Defense Department is doing managing the largest contract in Iraq, Halliburton's LOGCAP contract. The contract alone is worth over $4 billion to Halliburton. GAO told us that the Army Central Command in Kuwait has not made cost control a priority. GAO found that the Army does not have the expertise or the personnel in Kuwait needed to ensure that taxpayers are not being overcharged. According to the General Accounting Office, inexperienced reservists are being sent to Kuwait and given key oversight responsibilities. A 2- week training course on contract management is the only preparation they receive. GAO told us that in one instance the Army approved a LOGCAP contract worth $587 million to Halliburton in just 10 minutes. The documentation for this mammoth contract was just six pages long. In essence, this administration's approach to contractors like Halliburton is ``trust but don't verify.'' Auditors like the Defense Contract Audit Agency and criminal investigators with the Inspector General and the Justice Department can try to catch waste, fraud and abuse after it occurs, but there are few mechanisms in place to prevent overcharges from occurring in the first place. We are now learning that the administration's approach is an enormous mistake. This week, the committee received two recent audits of Halliburton by DCAA. At the appropriate time--well, I won't need to move to have the committee release these documents publicly because I understand that we have all agreed and the DCAA has agreed to make these documents public, so they will be available. These audits are a scathing indictment of Halliburton. According to DCAA, Halliburton's cost accounting system has, ``significant deficiencies'' and the company has repeatedly violated Federal acquisition regulations. Well, anybody who has followed this issue has heard Halliburton say over and over again that any violations or overcharges are isolated occurrences. This is what it said when it was revealed that Halliburton sought fees for millions of meals it never served, and it is what Halliburton said when it disclosed that company procurement officials participated in a $6 million kickback scheme, and this is also what Halliburton said to the DCAA. When the audit agency gave Halliburton a chance to respond to its preliminary findings, Halliburton wrote, ``this issue is not a significant estimating system deficiency as stated in the DCAA reports. Rather, this was a unique situation.'' The problem with Halliburton's response is that it is not true. According to the DCAA, ``The estimating deficiency is not a one-time occurrence. It is systemic.'' Now here is a stunning fact that is revealed in the DCAA audit documents. The DCAA brought these systemic problems to the attention of the Army Corps of Engineers on January 13. Three days later, on January 16, the Army Corps gave Halliburton another $1.2 billion contract. It was as if the decisionmakers simply didn't care. Yesterday, I sent my colleagues a briefing memorandum that went through some of these issues in detail, and I'd like to ask unanimous consent that it be made part of the hearing record. Chairman Tom Davis. Hearing no objection, I would note that there are parts of the briefing memorandum that we take issue with on the factual side, Mr. Waxman. We will get to that in our questions, but with that understanding, without objection, it will be entered into the record. [The information referred to follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.004 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.005 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.006 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.007 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.008 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.009 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.010 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.011 Mr. Waxman. It is not just the government auditors who are complaining about Halliburton's practices. Halliburton's own internal auditors have said that the company procedures are, ``antiquated'' and that it has, ``weak internal controls.'' Last month, my staff was contacted by two former Halliburton procurement officers. They described company practices that systematically overcharge the taxpayer on hundreds of routine requisitions every day. When they tried to protest, they were ignored. They said that the company's motto was ``Don't worry about price. It's cost-plus.'' Well, it's very hard to get details from the administration about the specific amounts Halliburton is charging for particular projects. The White House, Secretary of Defense, and the USAID all have an aversion to any form of oversight. When Representative Dingell and I wrote letters raising significant issues, they were almost always ignored. But we have been able to penetrate one particular contract, Halliburton's contract to import fuel from Kuwait into Iraq; and what we have learned is that Halliburton and its obscure subcontractor, Altanmia, have been gouging the taxpayer. I have another chart, and I want to show this to everyone here. Halliburton imports gasoline from Kuwait into Iraq for Iraqis to use. The Defense Energy Support Center imports gasoline from Kuwait into Iraq for the military to use. The chart simply compares the prices the government pays with those that Halliburton pays. The differences are astounding. Gasoline in the Middle East is a commodity. Everyone should be able to get it at essentially the same price, but Halliburton is paying over 20 cents more per gallon than the Energy Support Center just to purchase the fuel. Both Halliburton and the Energy Support Center have to transport the fuel through dangerous conditions into Iraq, both entities are using private contractors to handle the transportation, and both entities receive, military protection for convoys. But it costs the Energy Support Center just 36 cents per gallon compared to $1.21 for Halliburton, and then Halliburton adds on a markup for itself of 24 cents per gallon and another category called ``other'' charge of 2 cents per gallon. The end result is that it costs the taxpayer twice as much when Halliburton imports the fuel as it would cost the government to do it. Representative Dingell and I first raised this issue on October 15. Since then, all I have been hearing from the Army Corps of Engineers, which is the agency responsible for the fuel contract, is a string of denials and platitudes. As recently as February 1, the Corps spokesman said, ``We have our own internal audit process, and we haven't turned up any serious wrongdoing or major problems.'' When you get to the bottom of this, that is the real problem. The policymakers in this administration don't seem to care about the pattern of waste, fraud and abuse that is coming to light. Fifty years ago, the CEO of General Motors said, what is good for the country is good for General Motors and what is good for General Motors is good for America. Well, I have a message to this administration: What is good for Halliburton is not always good for America. Iraq is a dangerous country. All of us in Congress want to do whatever is necessary to make sure our troops have the equipment and protection they need, and Americans are a generous people. They are willing to spend billions to help Iraqis rebuild their nation and establish democracy. But gouging and profiteering is heinous and should never be tolerated. I firmly believe that Congress has an important oversight roll to play in ensuring the wise expenditure of taxpayers' dollars. Part of the problems that we are experiencing can be attributed to the lack of vigorous congressional oversight. But I'm encouraged by the recent steps that Chairman Davis has taken. He has joined me in requesting the DCAA audit documents. He scheduled this hearing, and he has promised to hold another hearing hopefully by the end of April. This is not easy for him to do, and I am sure it will alienate many in the administration, but I commend him for the steps that he is taking, even as I will be pressing him to take more. In closing, let me say that I look forward to today's hearing and the opportunity to hear from and question the distinguished witnesses before us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Hon. Henry A.

Thank you very much, Mr. Waxman. We have our panel today. We have Major General Carl Strock, who is the Director of Civil Works, Army Corps of Engineers; General Paul Kern, Commanding General, U.S. Army Materiel Command, Department of Defense; Major General Wade McManus, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Field Support Command; Ms. Tina Ballard, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Policy and Procurement, U.S. Department of Defense; Lewis Lucke, Deputy Assistant Administrator, USAID; Honorable Dov Zakheim, the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, and Chief Financial Officer, Department of Defense. We have Mr. William Reed, the Director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency [DCAA]; and Rear Admiral David Nash, the director of Iraq Program Management Office, Coalition Provisional Authority. It is our committee's policy that all witnesses be sworn before you testify. So if you would rise with me. [Witnesses sworn.] Chairman Tom Davis. I think I went over with everybody that we try to keep a 5-minute rule. Mr. Waxman and I didn't observe it. So we understand. Your total statement will be in the record. Obviously, there are a lot of allegations and things going out there. We want to give you adequate time to make your statements. We have a distinguished panel that I think for most of you are career military or civil servants, served under administrations of both parties. We appreciate your taking the time to be here. I am going to start with General Strock and work our way down. General Strock. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Tom Davis. I also need to recognize that Dr. Zakheim will be retiring on April 15. I want to extend my gratitude for your many years of service to our country and best wishes as you move forward and thank you for being with us today. Mr. Zakheim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Tom Davis. The others will be here for our next hearing, but this may be our last bite at you. Dr. Zakheim do you want to start off. Mr. Zakheim. I think if you would like to go in that order, just in terms of the flow, of how this is all seen in terms of oversight, then probably starting with General Strock is the right way to go. I will be talking specifically about contract performance oversight, and to start there is almost like starting a story in the middle. So with your permission I think we will start at---- Chairman Tom Davis. We will then thank you. Again General Strock, thank you for being with us. STATEMENTS OF MAJOR GENERAL CARL A.

REED, DIRECTOR, DEFENSE CONTRACT AUDIT AGENCY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE; AND REAR ADMIRAL DAVID NASH, USN (RET.), DIRECTOR, IRAQ PROGRAM MANAGEMENT OFFICE, COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY General Strock. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for allowing us to testify today. It really is an honor to be here to tell you a bit about what we faced in Iraq. As you mentioned, I am the Director of Civil Works for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, but from March to September I served with ORHA and later CPA in a number of capacities, culminating as the Deputy Director for Infrastructure in the CPA. What I would like to do today is give you a limited description of the operating environment that was faced by coalition military forces and civil authorities as we went into Baghdad. Sir, ORHA was established in January 2003--that's the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance--and we deployed to Kuwait on March 15, 2003. ORHA consisted of three pillars: reconstruction, led by the U.S. Agency for International Development [USAID]; civil administration, led by the Department of Defense; humanitarian assistance, led by the Department of State; and three regional coordinators for north, central and south Iraq headed by two retired general officers and one former Ambassador. The priority of effort for ORHA initially was the planning for an expected humanitarian crisis. Significant effort went into planning for food, water, shelter and medical support. The reconstruction focus was to repair damaged infrastructure to prewar conditions. We understood that the future of Iraq relied on the integrity of the infrastructure, so careful efforts were made to use precision weapons to minimize impacts on infrastructure. The ground forces were also sensitive to the need to limit damage to infrastructure. The U.S. Agency for International Development was given a $680 million effort to apply to all sectors of infrastructure, and oil was handled separately through a contract under a task force to restore Iraqi oil from the Corps of Engineers that reported directly to coalition forces land component commander. The third element of ORHA was civil administration, and that was aimed at the reestablishment of government functions in the liberated country. This consisted of senior advisors for each of the 23 ministries in teams from one to five. We expected that the leadership would flee but that ministry work force and facilities would be intact on our arrival. Lieutenant General Gardner and his leadership really concentrated on creation of a guiding coalition for the future of Iraq. The first elements deployed to the port of Umm Qasr in late March, shortly after the commencement of the hostilities, and the main body began deployment to Baghdad in mid-April. When we arrived, we found a country roughly the size of California in terms of population and geography where virtually every element of government did not exist. There was relatively little damage due to combat operations, with the exception of the communications infrastructure which was deliberately targeted. We anticipated some looting but not as significant as it turned out to be. It was extremely difficult for our forces to control, and it was especially bad in government facilities. We also anticipated some level of sabotage, but again this exceeded our expectations, not as much as expected in the oil infrastructure, where very few fires were set, but much more in other elements of infrastructure. Virtually every public building was burned, with its records, its equipment and supplies all destroyed. The most challenging aspect we found in the infrastructure was really not about the damage caused by the war and its aftermath but by 30 years of neglect under the Saddam regime. We found an infrastructure that was fragile and antiquated, that was really on its last legs. It was only to the credit of the Iraqi public servants that this infrastructure worked at all, largely as we understand it through threat that they produce for the country. Saddam also used basic services and infrastructure to reward those who favored him and to punish those who did not. In the electricity sector, there was no generation of electricity when it arrived in Baghdad, a tremendous challenge. There was no water treatment. There was no sewage flowing. All the irrigation in the country had ceased. Fuel supplies were far more limited than we anticipated. The hospitals were in darkness and closed down. Schools were not operating. The work force will be expected to take advantage of. As expected, the key leaders were absent. They either fled or had been removed from debaathification. But the remaining civil servants we found were competent, committed and courageous. However, they really lacked a sense of initiative that is so important in a self-performing government and virtually had to be told to do everything that was necessary. They also lacked facilities, tools, and equipment and supplies and money to get their job done. Finally, the security situation that all of us faced was a tremendous challenge for everyone. I might add that ORHA, those civil servants who went in with General Gardner, faced exactly the same living conditions as the Iraqis--no food, no fuel, no power, no transportation, everything the same. Sir, when we got on the ground we first established a regional presence through our regional coordinators to include Baghdad. We relied very heavily on the military forces in the early stages. Their civil affairs and line units really carried the weight of the reconstruction and establishment of government, utilizing seized and invested assets and their own capabilities. General McKiernan, who commanded the Combined Forces Land Component Command, recognized the need early on to get electricity flowing in the country, so he convened a task force called ``fajr,'' which is first light in Arabic. It's a multidisciplinary task force led by Brigadier Steve Hawkins that went into Baghdad right behind the military forces with a priority to establish electricity, to first furnish it to hospitals, then water supply, then sewage treatment, and finally to domestic needs of the Iraqi people. We also found a flooding situation on our hands, as all the reservoirs had been abandoned and they were operated at free flow. Working with the Iraqi public servants we were able to find, we brought the rivers under control, and we started up the power plants and began to establish the electrical grid and began to treat water and get hospitals back on line. Eventually Task Force Fajr expanded their scope to a national level. Another task force that was established was Task Force Restore Iraqi Hope--Iraqi Oil. On February 13, the Army was designated as executive agent for restoration of oil infrastructure, and that authority was passed on to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which further delegated authority to Brigadier General Bob Creer from the Southwestern Division to pull together a task force and accomplish that mission. The immediate mission was to fight anticipated fires and to safely shut down the oil fields in Kirkuk and Rumaila and then to bring the refineries, pipelines and export facilities back into operation. We used LOGCAP to reposition the firefighting forces that we needed for the immediate aftermath of the fighting, and after careful analysis decided to go to sole source with Kellogg, Brown and Root services to accomplish, the reconstruction of the oil infrastructure. There was far less sabotage than expected. We quickly brought the fires under control with the assistance of the Kuwaitis and, working with the Iraqi Oil Ministry, have made remarkable progress. We are now at prewar oil production levels of 2.5 million barrels per day. We are exporting 1.5 million barrels per day and refining about 500,000 barrels per day for domestic consumption. The expected earnings are $1.5 to $2 billion a month; and so far, to date, we have returned $8 billion to the DFI for use by the Iraqi people. Task force RIO also picked up an additional responsibility to provide domestic fuel for all the people of Iraq. This is not just gasoline. It included diesel, kerosene and LPG, which they used for cooking and heating. Sir, our final task was Task Force Restore Iraqi Electricity. In August, General Abizaid was very concerned about the progress of reconstruction. He was concerned that we were losing the consent of the Iraqi people, and frequently you heard from these people that this is the Nation that put a man on the moon but we can't get the lights on in Baghdad. Out of frustration, General Abizaid convened a conference in which he wanted to look at what we were doing with the electricity, the oil and refined fuel and the security situation that cared for all that infrastructure. One of the outcomes of that conference was the need for a FEMA-like capability similar to our domestic disaster response where teams of experts with flexible contracting tools and the necessary resources to fix problems as they encountered them could flow into Iraq. We deployed this task force within 2 weeks. We pulled General Steve Hawkins back, not to the fight and put him ashore, and since that time we've contributed in many ways to the restoration of electricity working under the leadership of USAID and the CPA. We accomplished the first mission of 4,400 megawatts of productivity in October, and we are well on the way to achieving the 6,000 megawatt target by May. The task force really focused on temporary generation, distribution controls and logistics, while USAID focused on the longer-term aspects of electrical generation and distribution. To do this, we employed four competitively bid projects much like the IDIQs used by LOGCAP and Task Force RIO, and so far our efforts have been tremendously successful. My written includes far more detail, but I again appreciate the opportunity to lay out for you the situation we faced and some of the mechanisms we employed to address. Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you very much. As I noted before, your entire statements are in the record; and questions will be based on the entire statement. [The prepared statement of General Strock follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.016 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.017 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.018 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.019 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.020 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.021 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.022 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.023 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.024 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.025 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.026 Chairman Tom Davis. General Kern, thanks for being with us. General Kern. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity today to speak to you about the Army's Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program, referred to as LOGCAP by the members and in our current testimony. My command, the Army Materiel Command's mission is to support our warfighters, and that includes all of our services as well as Ambassador Bremer's CPA, the Polish Multinational Division and other organizations in this theater. I have just returned from talking to members of the CJTF Command, General Sanchez in our area, and I would report that it's remarkable that it's been less than a year since the conditions which General Strock just described have been turned into a country which has been restoring itself into an economy and we hope to a democracy. We work each day to improve our support in the theater, and the observations that we have made show great success in that area as well as the areas that we need to improve. Part of the purpose of my visit there was to find those areas we need to improve so that we get direct feedback from our customers in their requests. LOGCAP provides to us the vital support for our forces in peace and in war. It gives us today the ability of an entire division of soldiers that can be returned to the fighting force and support through LOGCAP contracting. It provides us agility, flexibility, and fulfills critical, time-sensitive needs, and that is the critical part of a contingency-type contract where time is essential. It provides the means for our warfighters and our Nation to execute national security missions. These contracts are around the world, not just in Iraq, and they provide us extensive capability in each area we use them. When our forces go in as General Strock has described, they carry with them everything that they have for life support. The food, the water, the tents and the laundry they hope will not be far behind. LOGCAP has provided us the capability to change their conditions in which the soldiers and the support structure lives, from lying on the ground and eating MREs to one to being able to have shelter, sleep on cots, and have hot food prepared. If they wanted to shower when they arrived in Iraq last year, they used a bucket of water. Today, they have facilities to shower in. If they wanted a clean uniform, they used the same bucket of water; and today they have laundries that they can use. As many of the soldiers have reported to us, LOGCAP has changed the way that they can live and survive in that theater. Today force provider has provided transportable shelters, it has provided dining facilities, it has provided maintenance facilities, it manages large pieces of our general support for parts, and it is providing a new quality of life in the country. The stories are similar throughout. There are 61 base camps and today 79 dining facilities, which are supporting more than 180,000 soldiers. It is time critical, and so it is a contingency type contract which allows us to go in based on requirements and work through a process of definitizing the contract requirements and coming to an equitable adjustment. Frequently in these austere places, support is not what we would expect, and our contingencies allow us to both plan for that early and then react as requirements develop. Again, timing is critical and key in all of these. The contractors also--and I would like to correct my written statement, since three additional contractors were killed just yesterday, has resulted today in eight killed from any accident and two killed in accidents. So they are exposed to the same dangers that our soldiers and others in Ambassador Bremer's organization are exposed. We don't know precisely where we are going to be in our security arrangements, and this has given us the flexibility to respond. We also believe in fiscal responsibility. So our process, which I will ask General McManus to describe in some more detail, allows for that fiscal responsibility. It is a process of defining requirements, making sure that they fit within the scope of our contracting efforts and then following up with audits and defense contract management administrative contracting officers to ensure that everything is done in accordance to our Federal acquisition regulations. The point is, we do plan and we do followup and we are fiscally and legally responsible for the actions that we do take. I believe that LOGCAP and our soldiers are doing a remarkable job. We aren't perfect. It is a war zone, and we are correcting the mistakes as we find them. I believe you will find that we have corrected more than we have found by the basis of just eliminating and working together both with our supporting requirements and our audit agencies. The soldiers have done a remarkable job, and they have been supported by the LOGCAP contract admirably. We look forward to your questions and I appreciate the opportunity on our behalf to testify. Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of General Kern follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.027 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.028 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.029 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.030 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.031 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.032 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.033 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.034 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.035 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.036 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.037 Chairman Tom Davis. Can we go now to Ms. Ballard. Ms. Ballard. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the committee, thank you for this opportunity to report to you on the U.S. Army's role in contracting in Iraq. It is my privilege to represent---- Chairman Tom Davis. Could you pull the mic just a little closer there? Ms. Ballard. Is that better, sir? Chairman Tom Davis. It's better. Ms. Ballard. It is my privilege to represent the Army leadership and the military and civilian members of the Army's contracting work force who are at the forefront in the reconstruction and restoration of Iraq's infrastructure. We are very proud of these dedicated men and women because of their extraordinary efforts to help create a stable and successful Iraq, especially in light of the dangers they face every day. This is a time of tremendous change, and we are most grateful for the committee' wisdom, guidance and strong support. Over the last year, our Army has met the demands of the global war on terrorism with more than 330,000 troops deployed around the world in more than 120 countries. They are doing what our country needs them to do in Bosnia, Kosovo, in the Sinai, in Korea, in Afghanistan and in Iraq. The U.S. Army--well-trained, well-led and well-equipped--is an important part of our globally engaged joint force. Our Army was instrumental in the defeat of Saddam Hussein and the subsequent liberation of more than 46 million people from oppression and despair. Our Army remains a central and critical participant in Operation Iraqi Freedom. On May 21, 2003, the Deputy Secretary of Defense designated the Secretary of the Army as the Executive Agent for the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, later to become the Coalition Provisional Authority [CPA], in Iraq. On January 14, 2004, the Deputy Secretary of Defense further assigned responsibility for Acquisition and Program Management Support for CPA to the Secretary of the Army. The Army is the lead service, helping Iraqi people build a stable and democratic society. Our job is enormous, but we continue to make progress in an extremely difficult situation. I would like to reiterate the widespread neglect of basic services that Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz reported to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 22, 2003. He said: Before the war, large numbers of Iraq's children under 5 years old suffered from malnutrition. Only 60 percent of the Iraqi people had access to safe drinking water. Ten of Basrah's 21 potable water treatment facilities were not functional. Seventy percent of Iraq's sewage treatment plants needed repair. According to UNICEF reports, some 500,000 metric tons of raw or partially treated sewage was dumped into the Tigris or Euphrates rivers, which are Iraq's main source of water. Eighty percent of Iraq's 25,000 schools were in poor condition. In some cases, as many as 180 students occupied one classroom--with an average of one book per six students--while at the same time every one of the first 100 or so schools we inspected in southern Iraq had been used as military command posts and arms storage sites. Iraq's electrical power system operated at half its capacity. Iraq's agriculture production had dropped significantly. Iraq's oil infrastructure was neglected.'' It will take time to reverse these desperate conditions, but we are making steady progress. The Army, as Executive Agent, is providing contracting and program management support both in Iraq and in the United States. We are charged with procuring all nonconstruction items and services to meet the humanitarian needs--the basic needs-- of the Iraqi people as well as the economic reconstruction and repair of Iraq's infrastructure. To date, in total, more than 1,500 contracts valued at more than $9.7 billion have been awarded. Of that total, more than 1,300 contracts totaling $1.3 billion have been awarded by our contracting office in Iraq. These contracts were awarded for the repair and renovation of schools, banks, railway stations, clinics, mosques, a human rights building, a teacher training institute, a women's rights building, and water treatment plants. These contracts were awarded to provide police and firefighters with uniforms and equipment, hospitals with badly needed supplies, electrical power system equipment, rescue equipment and buses. In addition, our contract awards are helping to build playgrounds, youth centers, emergency housing, roads, sewers and irrigation systems. Again, of the overall total of more than $9.7 billion, contracts awarded within the United States total $2.5 billion for more than 200 contracts that are restoring Iraqi oil, shutting down and repairing oil wells, firefighting, explosive ordinance demolition, restoring Iraqi electricity, radio installation throughout Iraq, laptops, and emergency medical personnel in each of Iraq's 18 governates. Led by Admiral David Nash, U.S. Navy retired, the Program Management Office for rebuilding Iraq is located in Baghdad with a support office located in the Pentagon. As the requirement focal point for all Iraq reconstruction contracting, the PMO is responsible for oversight and implementation of the $18.4 billion appropriated by the U.S. Congress to support the reconstruction of Iraq's infrastructure. The construction sectors are oil, electricity, public works and water, security and justice, transportation and communications, buildings, education and health. Over $12.6 billion will be spent toward actual construction over the next few years, and $5.8 billion will be spent on nonconstruction. Some of the funds will go toward democracy, which is not covered by supplies. Computers are needed to monitor and control electrical and water systems; vehicles are needed to transport materials or to support system maintenance; uniforms and supplies are needed to support the police and civil defense corps; and supplies are needed to support schools. On January 6, 2004, the Army released seven design/build construction solicitations. Proposals were received in February and are under evaluation for project awards in March of this year. These seven solicitations will result in 10 contracts in support of electrical, public works and water, water resources, transportation, communication, security projects and buildings. Contracts will be awarded using best value valuation methodology based on technical, management, past performance and cost factors. Our contracting personnel on the ground in Iraq are courageous, dedicated volunteers. Since June 2003, when our first person arrived, we have been operating in Iraq. We now have a total of 28 individuals. They are multi-service and civilian: 3 Army, 4 Navy, 1 Marine, 11 Air Force and 9 civilians working in small, jam-packed work spaces. They are doing a phenomenal job under very tough and dangerous conditions. Let me illustrate my point. Army Colonel Elias George Nimmer, a Medical Service Corps Officer and a member of the acquisition work force assigned to the Office of Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology was deployed in late June 2003, as part of a team supporting CPA's work with Iraq's Ministry of Health. In the early morning of October 26, 2003, a barrage of rockets hit the al-Rashid Hotel where he was staying, and a rocket impacted directly inside his room. Colonel Nimmer was hit with shrapnel in the spine and unable to move. Following three surgeries, he is doing remarkably well and recently returned to duty within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army. Currently, the General Accounting Office, in response to requests from Congress, is reviewing Iraqi essential services contracts to perform that the Army has followed proper procedures. We are working closely with the GAO auditors to ensure that they have all the information necessary to complete their work. I have a deep and growing appreciation for the courage, competence, dedication and efforts of our contracting personnel. Thanks to their hard work and extreme dedication, the U.S. Army leads the way in providing contracting support to CPA and to the people of Iraq. The work has been--and will continue to be--performed in accordance with proper procedures by military and civilian volunteers who are concerned and committed to accomplishing their work under the toughest and most austere conditions. We are proud of our role in helping to create and rebuild a stable and successful Iraq. Our accomplishments are helping the citizens of Iraq move toward governing themselves and sustaining, operating and maintaining their own infrastructure which, in turn, will help our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines to return home sooner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you.

Let's move to Mr. Lucke. Again, your total statement is in the record, so try to keep it within 5 minutes. General McManus is here for questions, and Mr. Reed is here for questions. That is why they are sitting up there, but they don't have to give opening statements. Thanks. Mr. Lucke. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the committee, I welcome the opportunity to testify on the U.S. Agency for International Development's participation in Iraq reconstruction. USAID began contingency planning for possible humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in post-conflict Iraq in late 2002. As part of this process, we mobilized significant resources and technical expertise to support both potential humanitarian as well as reconstruction requirements. I arrived in the region in November 2002, moved to Baghdad in April 2003, and remained as USAID mission director until last month. Working with CPA to improve the lives of Iraqis, USAID is working throughout Iraq to restore critical infrastructure, support the delivery of health care and education services, expand economic opportunity and improve governance. With a staff of some 160 ex-patriots and Iraqis, we are managing some $3.8 billion in projects to date. The USAID contractors and grantees now number some 800 ex-patriots, 3,000 Iraqis with a presence in every province of Iraq. Starting from zero, we're now fully mobilized and producing results, and we have moved fast. Our infrastructure contract alone has obligated over $1 billion in power, water and other work since the contract was awarded in March of last year. In coordination first with ORHA and then CPA, USAID was tasked with managing some $2.1 billion of the first April 2003 supplemental appropriation. We have many partners in Iraq within CPA: the Corps of Engineers for infrastructure supervision, the U.S. Army for the power sector, and the State Department in various sectors, especially governance. Our role in post-conflict Iraq has been twofold: first, to avoid a humanitarian crisis, which didn't happen; and, second, to lay the foundation for long-term reconstruction, where we are well on the way to helping CPA accomplish this goal. Our specific accomplishments in Iraq are significant. In infrastructure, we have repaired and are repairing power systems, the port of Umm Qasr water and sanitation systems, airports, telecommunications facilities, schools, health clinics, railways and irrigation systems. In social services, we've immunized millions of children, strengthened the health care system, printed and distributed millions of new textbooks, distributed school and student kits to millions of students, and trained teachers. In the area of economic opportunity, we have implemented key reforms in economic governance related to the regulatory environment, banking, taxation, replacement of the old currency, and begun work in the key agriculture sector. In governance, we have helped establish local councils throughout Iraq, awarded rapid response grants to provide essential local services, begun civic education programs, helped reestablish functioning government ministries, established hundreds of community associations, and we're helping CPA lay the groundwork for a democratic and sovereign Iraq. We have accomplished this work under the initial 2003 supplement by awarding nine contracts for port administration, airport administration, logistic support, infrastructure repair, architecture and engineering services for infrastructure, health, education, economic recovery and reform and agriculture. Additionally, we have significant grants to five U.S. NGO's for community development throughout Iraq, grants to the World Health Organization, UNICEF and UNESCO for health, water sanitation and replacement of math and science books respectively, and grants to five U.S. universities to partner with Iraqi universities. Under the second Iraq supplemental, USAID was the first agency to make an award in support of the continuing efforts in Iraq with a $1.8 billion infrastructure contract utilizing full and open competition. It's anticipated that this contract will primarily provide additional work in the power and water sectors. Although proud of our efforts in Iraq, our work takes place in the context of considerable security and logistical challenges associated with standing up the largest U.S. reconstruction program since the Marshall plan. USAID has remained as open and transparent as possible in our procurement process. We have made serious efforts to make available virtually every procurement document we legally can on our Web site. Steven Schooner of the George Washington University Law School recently wrote at a Government Contracts Year in Review conference that USAID, ``has endeavored, for the most part successfully, to provide information related to its contracting activities on its Web page.'' He goes on to say, ``I believe that USAID has set a new standard for transparency and public procurement.'' We will continue to expand our efforts to meet the very high standards that we have set for ourselves. We are also doing everything we can to ensure that the taxpayers receive value for their dollar, that includes posting U.S. direct-hire staff to Iraq, including to three regional offices to oversee these contracts, as well as hiring senior contracting officials to help administer these awards. We are co-located in Baghdad with the USAID Inspector General's Office and receive audit support from the Defense Contract Audit Agency to ensure funds are spent appropriately and are accounted for. And we take this accountability responsibility seriously. USAID is determined to successfully help CPA lay the foundation for governmental and economic transformation in Iraq. We are successfully managing an enormous sum of public funds to an ambitious but focused reconstruction program, and we are prepared to continue this effort for the duration of the construction period. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Lucke follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.044 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.045 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.046 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.047 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.048 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.049 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.050 Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you very much. Dr. Zakheim, thank you. Mr. Zakheim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Representative Waxman, members of the committee. I want to focus on Department of Defense oversight of contracts related to military operations and reconstruction in Iraq. With me on my left is Mr. Bill Reed, who has been serving as Director of DCAA, the Contract Audit Agency, for 16 years and is a respected professional in his field. DOD considers the oversight of contracts an essential responsibility. We have a number of strong organizations, policies and regulations to fulfill this responsibility. Our task is not only to identify contract issues, but also to prevent future occurrences of problems we identify, recover any excess charges and take appropriate action against any contractor wrongdoing. As the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller and also the Department's Chief Financial Officer, I am responsible for ensuring the adequate financial management of funds spent on the reconstruction of Iraq. My involvement in DOD contract performance oversight comes primarily from my office's responsibility for the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Bill Reed reports to me. DCAA's mission is provide all contract audit and financial advisory services related to DOD acquisition of goods and services. Other DOD organizations that are not within my office, such as the Defense Contract Management Agency and the DOD Inspector General, also play important oversight roles in terms of managing--of watching contracts--and work closely with DCAA. My colleague, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, is responsible for the contract policies to help ensure the Department obtains the best value when acquiring equipment and services and also is responsible for oversight of the Defense Contract Management Agency. The Army and DCAA are strategic partners in the oversight of contracts through performance. The Army, as the executive agent for all Department reconstruction requirements in Iraq, is responsible for contract and program management activities there. DCAA, which is co-located with Army personnel in Baghdad, evaluates all contractor proposals and reviews all billing paperwork for primes and subcontractors. My office's financial management activities in Iraq began at the end of major combat operations there. I created and had in place by late April 2003 a 20 member forward cell that included representatives not only from DCAA but also from the DOD Inspector General, from the Office of Management and Budget, from the Defense Contract Management Agency, from the Joint Staff, from USAID and from the General Accounting Office. This team and its supporting rear cell at the Pentagon were especially critical to getting the Coalition Provisional Authority fully operational and capable of undertaking its enormous reconstruction tasks. DOD contract performance oversight is now being supported by DCAA's Iraq branch office under Branch Manager Dan Altemus. The office now has 25 auditors. I met all 25 of them when I was in Iraq 2 weeks ago, the office it will increase to 31 auditors by the end of May. Complementing this in-country support, DCAA has auditors that also provide contract oversight at stateside locations that have major contracts in Iraq. Let me talk briefly about some of our findings and actions. DOD oversight of contract performance in Iraq has uncovered a number of problems. A resulting action has ranged from recommending changes in processes to rejection of unsupported proposal costs to reductions in billed costs for potentially unreasonable expenditures, to referral of our findings to the DOD Inspector General for possible legal action against the contractor. Contractor performance in Iraq has not been perfect, but it has not been terrible. Iraq presents a difficult security environment for contractors, as you have heard. A number have already been killed, many wounded. Many contractors that have not had problems in performing their domestic DOD contracts are having difficulties in adjusting to the unique environment in Iraq and to their own firm's influx of new business. We believe that contractor financial and internal control problems will resolve themselves. In the meantime, we will take whatever actions are necessary to protect the government's financial interest. DOD has enforced and will continue to enforce the highest standards for contracts in Iraq and anywhere else. Halliburton, mainly through its Kellogg, Brown and Root subsidiary, is the largest contractor operating in Iraq with contract ceilings that approach $18 billion. We are not surprised that the largest contractor has the bulk of the contract problems we found. KBR has been responsive to the reported contract findings and has agreed to work on improving its contract performance. Contract problems reported to date generally have been caused by contractor deficiencies, not by problems with contract policies or the DOD organizations managing these contracts. The process works. Still, to mitigate only process problems, the Department has taken action to ensure that its contract processes are integrated, effective and efficient. Especially significant has been the creation of the CPA's Program Management Office, led by Admiral Dave Nash who is here. I should also mention, new CPA Inspector General. My statement for the record provides details on DOD oversight of Iraq contracts and the major issues we have identified. I will only highlight a very few of them orally. Estimating practices: DCAA has identified significant deficiencies in KBR's estimating practices relating to the award of subcontract costs. Earlier this year, after consultation with the contracting officer, DCAA returned two major task order proposals worth more than $3 billion to KBR because they were inadequate for the purposes of negotiating a fair and reasonable price. KBR later resubmitted one of the task orders for $700 million less than the original proposal. Even this resubmitted proposal was later withdrawn by KBR due to continuing pricing issues. It was DCAA that found that $700 million problem. These issues included proposal subcontract costs that were significantly different from previously negotiated actual subcontract amounts and KBR's use of proposal estimates instead of more than $290 million of actual costs already incurred. Both issues were disclosed during the DCAA audit. On January 13, 2004, DCAA notified the appropriate government contracting officials that KBR's subcontracting estimating process and procedures were considered inadequate and recommended that DCAA be advised before the negotiation of any future contract awards. KBR's deficiency in estimating some contracts was the catalyst of DCAA's review of potential gasoline overpricing under the Restore Iraqi Oil [RIO], contract. The review found significant issues related to KBR's pricing and award of subcontract costs. It disclosed potential overpricing on gasoline of $61 million through September 2003. During DCAA's review, the auditors came across other information that led them to make a referral to the DOD Inspector General, which recently launched an investigation of this potential overpricing of gasoline. KBR and dining facilities subcontract costs: DCAA has identified inadequate support for billed dining facilities costs. In DCAA's opinion, the billed number of meals appears to exceed significantly the actual meals served. DCAA and KBR have agreed on the withholding of $176.5 million, of which it voluntarily withheld $140.7 million from future billings while KBR prepares a response to issues reported by DCAA. Then there is the violation of the ``Anti-kickback'' Act. KBR itself has voluntarily disclosed a possible violation of the ``Anti-kickback'' Act by two of its employees. KBR has already reimbursed the government for the estimated impact of $6.3 million. DCAA has requested supporting data from KBR to validate that sum. DCAA has helped identify contracting issues that stem from the fact that major contracts in Iraq have been slow to get definitized, and by definitized, I mean to get a definite contract price negotiated. DCAA found that KBR was not observing the 85 percent limit in the reimbursement vouchers it submitted for its undefinitized LOGCAP task orders. In late February, DCAA told KBR that it should apply that 85 percent limit to its vouchers, in other words, not charging the additional 15 percent. The Army's contracting officer has received KBR's response to the DCAA recommendation and is currently evaluating it. There are other contract issues that go beyond KBR, and it is important to mention a few of these. Titan Corp.: Recent DCAA audits disclosed deficiencies in Titan's labor distribution system, which records costs to Titan employees. DCAA also found that Titan lacked procedures for adequate tracking of hours worked by foreign national consultants. Based on these findings, the Defense Contract Management Agency contracting officer implemented a 10 percent withhold on all of Titan's labor and consulting costs until all identified deficiencies are corrected and bills to the government are based on adequate internal controls. Restore Iraqi Electricity: In January and February of this year, DCAA auditors evaluated proposal costs exceeding $900 million from the three prime contractors for the RIE program, Fluor Federal systems, Perini Corp. and Washington Group International. As a result of these proposal reviews, DCAA reported to the Army Corps of Engineers that all three contractors had substantial subcontract pricing issues. DCAA will continue to perform oversight of the subcontract estimating and billed costs. It will work closely with the prime contractors and the Corps of Engineers to ensure that future subcontract estimates are adequate. In addition, it will evaluate each voucher submitted by the prime contractors to ensure that contract costs, including subcontract costs, are properly billed and paid. In closing, I first want to underscore the context in which all of this is taking place. You have heard the details of how the country of Iraq has been completely transformed in less than a year. After the war, we have opened hospitals; we have opened medical clinics; we have restored Iraqi oil to prewar levels; courts are back in operation and are probably functioning a bit better than the previous 30 years; a new currency in circulation; 170 newspapers are being published; students sit in rehabilitated classrooms with new textbooks whose contents probably are true for the first time in many years; and a Governing Council that ratified a Bill of Rights. That is the context in which we have all operated. Beyond that, I want to underscore that we in the Department of Defense are absolutely committed to an integrated, well-managed process in Iraq. We will not tolerate the billing of costs that are not properly documented and supported. If internal controlled systems are deficient, we will continue to use protections, such as contract withholdings, to safeguard the people's interests. And we will provide whatever personnel and budget resources are needed to enforce integrity in DOD contracts. My comptroller organization will continue to work with other organizations within and outside the Department to assist those organizations and to share our findings. From the beginning, DCAA and my office have coordinated closely not only with the DOD Inspector General but with the General Accounting Office and now with the CPA Inspector General, since its creation. We have regularly provided these organizations with information on our activities. And this has included DCAA detailed briefings to the GAO on June 23 and November 7 of last year. And this past January 7, DCAA Director Bill Reed and I personally briefed David Walker, the Comptroller General and Gene Reardon, the Deputy Inspector General of DOD, on DCAA's contract audit support of Iraq reconstruction. DCAA and my office are the primary source of information on Iraq oversight for both the GAO and the DOD Inspector General. I repeat, we are the primary source. GAO and the DOD IG have been supportive of our work in Iraq and have allowed DCAA to continue its programmed audits without attempting to duplicate their work. In sum, I believe the Department's contract oversight has been vigilant, and we will ensure that it continues to be vigilant. I look forward to addressing any questions or comments you have on this matter.

Thank you very much. Admiral Nash, clean up here. Admiral Nash. Thank you and good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I will submit my written remarks for the record and I would like to summarize them very quickly. I really appreciate this opportunity to offer a field perspective on the reconstruction in Iraq based on my 8 months of experience there. It is an honor to appear before you and to bring the information that I have. The Program Management Office is a living example, in my opinion, of how a total can be greater than the sum of its parts. I am proud to represent that team today that is dedicated. Speaking in the broadest of terms, the Public Management Office is responsible for managing and executing the U.S.-funded reconstruction of Iraq's infrastructure and essential services. As the Office's Director, I report to the Coalition Provisional Authority's Administrator, Ambassador Bremer. I also report to Acting Secretary of the Army-- Brownlee--for Acquisition and Program Management Support. Our goals are simple: To properly execute the supplemental work; to build the capacity for Iraq to do large program management for their own future; to build the capacity of Iraq construction and construction support industry; and finally and most important, is to win the peace in Iraq. Most of you have seen the statistics about electricity and water and telephone and other infrastructure elements in Iraq. Having lived in Iraq for 8 months, I can attest to the severity of these challenges. As you know, Saddam Hussein's government paid little attention to maintaining the country's infrastructure. Before the war, the electrical grid left more than one-third of the Iraqi citizenry without power; 40 percent of their citizens lacked access to safe, reliable water supplies, with only 6 percent of the population linked to a sewage treatment system, and telephones limited to only a handful of homes. In summary, facilities and services across the country ran until they were broken and then abandoned. Rebuilding the Iraqi infrastructure is a key part of the overall strategy to assist Iraq in becoming a free and democratic country. You all did your part by providing the $18.4 billion to help rebuild Iraq. The $12.6 billion will be focused on construction and approximately $5.8 billion on nonconstruction. Our emphasis is creating security through stability that will ultimately accelerate the pace at which Iraqi sovereignty will lead to all of our troops returning home permanently. Lieutenant General Sanchez and I agree wholeheartedly on this principle, and we are committed to working together. Moreover, we are firmly committed to the concept that time is of the essence, and we must work as fast as possible to rebuild Iraq infrastructure. And to ensure accountability for the funds allocated under fiscal year 2004 supplemental appropriations bill for the reconstruction of Iraq, a coordinated body was necessary. The Coalition Provisional Authority and Ambassador Bremer created the Program Management Office designed to direct, coordinate and oversee the contracting organizations for this endeavor. U.S. Government organizations and agencies, such as USAID and the Army Corps of Engineers, will serve as executive agents in contracting on our behalf. We established an approach and reconstruction efforts that follow four basic tenets: First, financial and contractual authority will follow a clear chain of responsibility; second, program management will follow an innovative and highly leveraged approach that relies heavily on the private-sector participation; third, contracting the work will follow a strategy of full and open competition and comply with the Federal acquisition regulations in the supplemental bill; and finally, we will have maximum transparency in everything we do. Our approach leverages the private sector for construction and program management support while maintaining a layer of government oversight protecting the American taxpayer. This concept of operations is inherently agile and allows us to evaluate and adjust each stage based on performance. The result is the greatest value at the least cost. The assistance you have provided in response to the President's emergency supplemental request is vast and speaks well for the generosity of the American people. It will lay a solid foundation for the future in Iraq. As we move forward, we are organized for success and have the people, technology and processes to do the job. We are at work today on the following: The supplemental funds for reconstruction are being committed in accordance with the 5 January 2007 report to Congress. Each contract contains explicit incentives for hiring Iraqi citizens. And finally, we are emphasizing transparency of operations by using off-the- shelf management information systems for real-time reporting, visible on the Program Management Office Web site. I said earlier that our actions were open, competitive and transparent. To assure that they remain so, the following auditors, including others, will oversee and review our work: The Defense Contracting Auditing Agency has already joined us. The Coalition Provisional Inspector General has already stood up, and I have already spoken to the General Accounting Office and the Comptroller General. Continuing audits, in my experience, are a normal part of the acquisition cycle and not only serve the classic functions of preventing waste, fraud and abuse but also will serve as a running tutorial for the Iraqi Government and business community. I am confident that we have made a solid start to the task ahead. However, no effort of this size or scope has ever been flawless. We will work hard to continually evaluate ourselves, improve and ask the auditors to help us do so. Mr. Chairman on June 30, a sovereign Iraqi Government assumes power. However, the mission to rebuild the infrastructure of Iraq will continue. Rebuilding power plants, water treatment facilities, telecommunications facilities, schools, security facilities, public buildings, this all will take time. In my 8 months in Iraq, I have met hundreds of Iraqis. Their message has been consistent. They want nothing more than what we enjoy here, reliable electricity, clean water, functioning sewage systems, an educational infrastructure and better health care. Beyond that, they expect the United States will make good on its promises, and we shall. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Admiral Nash follows:] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.056 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.057 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.058 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.059 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.060 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.061 [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T6407.062 Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you all very much. Let me start the questioning. This really goes to everybody on here. I am going to ask a three part question, but I want to get this on the record, and everybody is under oath. Have you or anyone in your office ever discussed with the Vice President or with his office the award of a contract for Iraqi reconstruction prior to any contract being awarded? General Strock. No, I have not. General Kern. No, sir, I have not. General McManus. No, sir, I have not. Ms. Ballard. No, sir, I have not. Mr. Lucke. No, sir, I have not. Mr. Zakheim. No, sir, I have not. Mr. Reed. No, sir, I have not. Admiral Nash. No, sir, I have not. Chairman Tom Davis. Did the fact that the Vice President was a former officer, CEO, of Halliburton influence the selection of Halliburton and KBR in any way? General Strock. No, sir, it did not. General Kern. No, sir, it did not. General McManus. No, sir, it did not. Ms. Ballard. No, sir, it did not. Mr. Lucke. We have no contractual arrangement with Halliburton. Mr. Zakheim. We oversee, but I have no knowledge of any of this. Mr. Reed. No, I have no knowledge. Admiral Nash. No, sir, I have not. Chairman Tom Davis. Have you or anyone in your office been pressured by any political appointee or high official in the administration to make an award to a particular firm or go easy on any contractor in carrying out contract oversight activities? General Strock. Not to my knowledge. General Kern. No, sir, not in my office. General McManus. No, sir, not in my command. Ms. Ballard. No, sir. Mr. Lucke. No, sir, not to my knowledge. Mr. Zakheim. No, sir. Mr. Reed. No. Admiral Nash. No. Chairman Tom Davis. Thank you. An issue was raised, given the conditions on the ground in Iraq, do you think it would have been practical to have used multiple award task order contracts for sustainment or reconstruction services? There was a chart put up by the ranking member on a number of discrete projects and the number of discrete projects subject to competition. Is there any chance you would have been able to conduct competition for any of these task orders? Let me start with you, General McManus. Admiral Nash, you now are current. Maybe as the situation changes, could we do a better job? General McManus. It is important to note that the LOGCAP contract provides us a flexibility and agility to respond to unknown requirements over unknown timelines in uncertain conditions. As we began to prosecute this campaign--and remember, we were operating in Iraq as well as Afghanistan and Kuwait with forces employed to include bringing in the additional support for ORHA and CPA, the Iraqi Survey Group, and now the multinational division--the timelines against which we execute the warfighter's requirements or the customer's requirements are often very, very tight. In the course of normal competition, we wouldn't be nowhere near where we are today in terms of life support, distribution logistics support, if we had to do that. Time really becomes the biggest enemy, sir. Chairman Tom Davis. I understand that, but LOGCAP is given to one company. General McManus. That is correct. Chairman Tom Davis. So, basically, when you go out to them, nobody can say, ``I can do it cheaper or better,'' on any number of tasks, isn't that right? General McManus. That is correct. It's also important to note that LOGCAP, as a former program, we have been using as an institution for a decade. This is competition in which we select competitively a contractor to support contingency operations. Chairman Tom Davis. Admiral Nash, did you want to add anything to do that? Admiral Nash. When you use multiple award contracts, it requires that you have a lot of contractors mobilized onsite. It works very well in the United States where you have lots of contractors. But when you don't have lots of contractors, then you end up with the additional costs of mobilizing many. As we get many contractors mobilized in Iraq in the future, it will be something we will look at, because we will be looking for ways to become more efficient. Chairman Tom Davis. Since the contractors had to be there, there was no--there wasn't a lot of people knocking on the door to send people over? Admiral Nash. No, sir, to my knowledge. Chairman Tom Davis. Mr. Lucke, do you have any comments? Mr. Lucke. We began planning in November 2002, and we were able to use limited competition for eight of our nine grants. The one that we did not use limited competition on was for personnel, and that was a sole source that we absolutely needed in order to have personnel present in order to implement the programs. Chairman Tom Davis. Let me ask Mr. Reed, you are head of the Defense Contract Audit Agency. How many years have you been in the business of looking at government contracts? Mr. Reed. Thirty-nine years. Chairman Tom Davis. You served under a lot of different administrations and seen--you have seen a lot of contracts go awry during that time? Mr. Reed. Yes. Chairman Tom Davis. The ranking member made a comment that cost-plus contracts are notoriously open for abuse. Let me ask about the reliance on cost-plus contracts in this particular circumstance. Obviously, there are some cases where there are better vehicles than others. As you look at this from your perspective having to audit these, were there better ways to do this, or was this the most efficient way to accomplish the mission? Mr. Reed. The selection of the contract type is usually a balancing of risk between the government and the contractor. Firm-fixed contracts shift most of the risk to the contractor. Obviously, cost reimbursement is more of a balanced risk. There's no question that, when you are dealing with a contingency operation, that it will be very difficult to get any contractor to bid firm-fixed price for the scope of some of these efforts, which the requirements are very fluid, quite frankly. So I believe that the contracting vehicle selection is appropriate in my judgment. Chairman Tom Davis. And when you talk about cost-plus, there is an award fee with that, too, that goes to your ability to manage the contracts and bring costs down? Mr. Reed. That is correct, and that is a classic vehicle used by contracting officials to ensure contract performance. Chairman Tom Davis. You have seen, obviously, a lot of cost-plus contracts in your time. In this situation, there have been allegations that one of the contractors, Halliburton in particular, would send in invoices for meals that weren't served. Is this a common practice, when you're not sure what logistics are going to be and what is our catch to catch this and make sure there are corrections made as this goes through the process? Mr. Reed. DCAA certainly is not an expert in restaurant services, but just from a common sense standpoint and what we have been advising to the contracting officer that we would expect to see, just common sense, is a reimbursement based on actual meals served plus a small margin for unexpected surplus based on some pattern of history. So, you know, if the average is 3,000 meals a day, 1 day only 2,900 show up and we have a small margin for the contractor to be covered because he estimated based on history to serve 3,000 meals. Chairman Tom Davis. So it is not uncommon for them to come in with an invoice for more or less than they actually served, based on historical---- Mr. Reed. That should be a condition of the contract. The contract should spell that out. And DCAA will audit to whatever the terms of the contract are. Chairman Tom Davis. Do you have any comments on that? General McManus. No, sir. Chairman Tom Davis. Ms. Ballard. Ms. Ballard. No, sir. Chairman Tom Davis. As I understand it, the allegation here is that there were meals not served, and there were billings coming in. But ordinarily, on an audit, it would be reconciled? Mr. Zakheim. That is exactly right. Chairman Tom Davis. The process is set up that it would not be uncommon for someone to come in slightly over or under and on audit, you pick those up and reconcile? Mr. Zakheim. Exactly. Chairman Tom Davis. That is not necessarily evidence of fraud, that's just the way it works in the normal scheme of things? Mr. Reed. That's right. Chairman Tom Davis. Why is any gasoline being imported from Kuwait under Halliburton's IO contract? Why are they such high prices? Ms. Ballard, can you explain that to us, because you have the chart that was up there and the chart leaps out at you? Ms. Ballard. Mr. Chairman, first, the oil is being imported from Kuwait because of safety issues for our soldiers. Initially, when we began to import oil from Kuwait, it was a few days after the hostilities had ceased in Iraq. There were lines miles long, two to three cars wide. This gave openings to riots, to civil unrest, which created threats to our soldiers. The crowds became cover upon which the insurgents could use it to attack our soldiers. So our first and primary objective was to obtain fuel so we could disburse crowds and eliminate the civil unrest. Strategically, we need to be able to obtain fuel from the north and south. If a border is shut down in the north and we are only receiving north fuel, then we have returned to the situation where we have created opportunities for civil unrest and threats to our soldiers. And third, sir, in obtaining fuel from Kuwait, Jordan and Turkey, we are just making the requirements for fuel in the region, and it is a principal requirement to maintain fuel supplies in the region. Chairman Tom Davis. Who within the Defense Department would decide what that reasonable price for fuel would be on that? Tina, do you know why $1.32 might be normal in some cases and $2.64 would be normal under other circumstances? General Strock. Sir, if I could take that on, sir. Again Carl Strock from the Army Corps of Engineers. This is a very complex question to resolve and answer. The prices you see here have a lot of variables in them. As Ms. Ballard mentioned, at the time that we entered into our first contract for delivery of fuel, it was early May, and, sir, I was in Baghdad the day that a U.S. soldier from the 3rd Infantry Division was assassinated in a gasoline line trying to keep order. We were told to get fuel moving now. Sir, we worked with our contractor to do that. The contractor secured three prices on May 4th and, on May 5th, made an award to the lowest price. That price was as reflected on the board here. Sir, that price has three components, one is the cost of the fuel. The other is transportation and other costs associated with that. The transportation costs were $1.2 a gallon. They are significantly different from the lower one because the distance was three times further Camp Cedar versus Baghdad. So the distance, considerably longer. And the turnaround time on that distance is considerably longer as well. About a 2-day turnaround to Camp Cedar is 6 to 10 days to get in and out of Baghdad. Chairman Tom Davis. So this is really not apples to apples? General Strock. No, sir, it is not. There is a time span here as well. The contract on the top was awarded on May 5th. The other was awarded later in August. Our contractor, when we approached him, said, ``Give me time. I can negotiate a better price.'' We said, ``There is no time. Do the best you can, and this is it.'' The additional costs there, sir, the 24 sentences of other costs, has to do with the capability of Iraqi infrastructure to download the fuel we delivered. Iraq does not routinely import fuel. They move fuel around the country by pipelines, and the storage places take fuel from the tanks to trucks. They are not set up to take fuel from trucks to tanks. We had to create those conditions through our contractor, and there was a cost associated with that, sir. So the 24 cents has to do with those kinds of expenses and difficulties. And finally, sir, the 2 percent represents, as I am told, the markup from the contractor for the management of this contract. It is the normal cost of doing business. I would also like to add, sir, that the cost of fuel from Turkey has averaged $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon. We import about two-thirds of the fuel from Turkey and about one-third from Kuwait, and we do that for the reasons Ms. Ballard has cited. We need to keep it flowing from two different directions. We could not use Turkey exclusively because, for example, at one point, when we were negotiating with the Kuwaitis, the border of Turkey was closed for 4 days, and the fuel was shut off. So the uncertainties of the situation required that. And further, the Turkish drivers would not take fuel into Baghdad, but the Kuwaiti drivers were willing to do so. Today, sir, we are paying 39 cents less per gallon than we did with that first task order, as we have negotiated with the supplier, who has agreed to work a spot market price for our fuel, still accelerated because we buy on spot market. We have not been willing and able to enter into contracts longer than 30 days duration. I can't speak to the DESC contract and how that's structured, but I know ours was deemed to be fair and reasonable. Chairman Tom Davis. What was the justification for selling this gas inside Iraq for 4 to 15 cents a gallon in some cases? General Strock. We worked on that with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and State Oil Marketing Organization. They have a responsibility for the provision of domestic fuel to their people. They were concerned about the level of strategic reserves and they were also willing to do what it took to get fuel to the pump. They chose not to transfer the cost of this fuel to the Iraqi people because of the impact it would have had on the economy in Iraq. I would also like to point out that it doesn't really matter where this money comes from. We mu"
