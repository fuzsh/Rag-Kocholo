        "text": "September 4, 2010\n\nOne of the better books about cults, as told from the secular perspective (as opposed to the dogmatic perspective). This is a collection of essays and papers from some of the top researchers in the field, many of them ex-cult members themselves. I have referenced this book again and again when writing presentations, websites, and blog posts on the topic.\n\nI especially enjoyed the story of the woman who infiltrated a Moonies recruitment camp. Even though she understood the mechanisms of coercive persuasion, and understood the damage this group has done to many people, she still came away with warm feelings towards the group.\n\nI have read many books on cults. But if you only want to read one, this is quite possibly the best all-round. (It competes closely with \"Captive Minds, Captive Hearts\", which is better for ex-members of cults who wish to recover.)\n\nOctober 13, 2017\n\nThis well-researched volume is focused on identifying the nature of cults and providing assistance and instruction for those seeking to escape from a high-control group of any sort. The book includes twenty chapters, most by psychiatrists, physicians, researchers, and others who have worked with cult survivors. There are a number of first-person accounts of cult experiences, documenting the process of joining or forming, belonging, and leaving.\n\nAfter an extensive introduction, the chapters are divided into four sections: Mind Control, Leaving Cults, Facilitating Recovery, and Special Issues. Because understanding is important to the process of escape and recovery, each section is helpful for understanding what has occurred (or is occurring), and learning how to escape and work through residual issues. A number of the suggested groups and resources are dated (the book was originally published in 1993), but the International Cultic Studies Association continues to offer much of the information and resources recommended in the book.\n\nThis is an extremely helpful book for anyone who has belonged to a high-control group, experienced spiritual abuse, or knows people who have been involved in an authoritarian group. Langone states that groups “earn the label “cult” because of what they do, not because of what they believe” (13). I learned that “cult” is not necessarily a religious group that wears funny clothes, but that any high-control group, whether “religious, psychotherapeutic, political, or commercial” can become a cult, and the techniques used in cults reflect those sometimes used on prisoners of war or in social “reforms” such as Mao’s Cultural Revolution or Hitler’s Germany.\n\nBased on my own experience and the advice in this book, I made a timeline of suggestions for leaving a high-control group. It occurred to me that might be a useful list for others, so here it is in very abbreviated form (if you need the longer form of the list, please feel free to leave a message and I can email it to you).\n\n1: Educate yourself\n\n2: Locate social support\n\n3: Try to establish something of a life—job or other support, one or more friends, connections to a church or community group— before you leave.\n\n4: Make the move.\n\n5: Find a counselor or support group.\n\n6: Expect to pass through stages in the readjustment process."
