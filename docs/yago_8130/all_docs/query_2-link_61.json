As Co-Director of Craniofacial Surgery at Yale, Dr. Alperovich has specialized training in congenital craniofacial surgery conditions, including cleft lip and palate, craniosynostosis, mandibular distraction, and ear reconstruction.

Dr. Alperovich also regularly performs breast and body aesthetic surgery including breast lift, abdominoplasty, liposuction, and fat grafting.     When meeting a new patient, Dr. Alperovich says his goal is to provide a surgery that will maximize the patient’s quality of life by restoring or recreating appearance and function to the best possible state. “I promise every patient that once I start a reconstructive or aesthetic procedure, I will keep working with them until they are satisfied,” he says.     He finds his work to be invigorating on a daily basis. “As a plastic surgeon, I have the privilege of being one of the few types of doctors that patients look forward to seeing,” Dr. Alperovich says. “The best part of my job is having the chance help a patient during a time of need and to serve as a positive, uplifting part of what can be a trying chapter.”     Dr. Alperovich is an associate professor of surgery (plastics division) at Yale School of Medicine. He is the recipient of multiple institutional and national awards including the CRANIO award by the American Society of Maxillofacial Surgeons and Yale Department of Surgery Academic Development Award.
