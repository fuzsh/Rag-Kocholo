        "text": "Concerted efforts at influence and control lie at the core of cultic groups, programs, and relationships. Many members, former members, and supporters of cults are not fully aware of the extent to which members may be manipulated, exploited, or even abused. The following list of social-structural, social-psychological, and interpersonal behavioral patterns commonly found in cultic environments may help you assess a particular group or relationship. Keep reading to learn more about the characteristics associated with cults.\n\nI encourage you to compare these patterns to the situation you were in (or in which you, a family member, or friend is currently involved). This list may help you determine if there is a cause for concern. Please bear in mind that this list is not meant to be a “cult scale,” or a definitive checklist to determine if a specific group is a cult; this is not so much a diagnostic instrument as it is an analytical tool:\n\nThe group displays an excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader, and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.\n\nQuestioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.\n\nMind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, or debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s).\n\nThe leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (e.g., members must get permission to date, change jobs, or marry—or leaders prescribe what to wear, where to live, whether to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth).\n\nThe group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s), and its members (e.g., the leader is considered the Messiah, a special being, an avatar—or the group and/or the leader is on a special mission to save humanity).\n\nThe group has a polarized, us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.\n\nThe leader is not accountable to any authorities (unlike, for example, teachers, military commanders, or ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream religious denominations).\n\nThe group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary. This may result in members participating in behaviors or activities they would have considered reprehensible or unethical before joining the group (e.g., lying to family or friends, or collecting money for bogus charities).\n\nThe leadership induces feelings of shame and/or guilt in order to influence and control members. Often this is done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.\n\nSubservience to the leader or group requires members to cut ties with family and friends, and radically alter the personal goals and activities they had before joining the group.\n\nThe group is preoccupied with bringing in new members.\n\nThe group is preoccupied with making money.\n\nMembers are expected to devote inordinate amounts of time to the group and group-related activities.\n\nMembers are encouraged or required to live and/or socialize only with other group members.\n\nThe most loyal members (the “true believers”) feel there can be no life outside the context of the group. They believe there is no other way to be, and often fear reprisals to themselves or others if they leave—or even consider leaving—the group.\n\nThis excerpt written by Dr. Janja Lalich and Michael D. Langone is from: Take Back Your Life: Recovering from Cults and Abusive Relationships (Bay Tree Publishing, 2006). Do not reprint without permission of the publisher.\n\nIf the above list of characteristics associated with cults sounded all too familiar, consider exploring my recommended reading list to find resources to give you or your loved one the tools needed to break free."
