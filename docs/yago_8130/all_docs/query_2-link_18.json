On this the fifth anniversary month of the tragic devastation wreaked upon our nation, those brave men and women who lost their lives safeguarding others are remembered and revered.\n\nMay your spirit continue to soar and your memory continue to inspire. Your family had to endure losing two beloved heroes and how I wish they had not had to endure this tragedy.\n\nThis reflection is sent with the utmost respect and gratitude for the distinquished service Thomas gave to his community and country, and for the supreme sacrifice he and his family made on September 11, 2001.\n\nPhyllis Loya, mother of fallen officer Larry Lasater, Pittsburg Police Department, CA; eow 4/24/05\n\na hero lives forever.....\n\nStill missing you Capt. Adrenaline.\n\nThinking of you and your loved ones on this tragic day in history. You will never be forgotten and will be forever a hero.\n\nNicole Burdette\n\nWife of Deputy Alex Burdette EOW 3-12-05\n\nI will never forget.\n\nGina Jones\n\nFellow American\n\nHERO! Rest in peace, Sir! You are not forgotten.\n\nPolice Officer\n\nTom:\n\nLet me say first off, that as a former resident of New York, residing in Yonkers, I always admired the NYPD for their professionalism and dedication. Secondly, for the last 27 years, I have been a law enforcement officer in the State of Florida, 25 of those years here as a Deputy Sheriff and Detective. The type of courage you displayed by deliberately putting yourself in harm's way to save others, only enhances what I stated about the NYPD.\n\nYou, and all who made the supreme sacrifice that horrible day, will NEVER be forgotten. Your actions, and those of others, has made us all proud to wear the badge. Though the animals who designed that attack were successful in killing thousands of innocent lives, they will NEVER be successful in diminishing our dedication to protect our fellow Americans, and our resolve to bring to justice any and ALL terrorists, foreign or domestic.\n\nMy prayer for your family, Tom, is that God grant them peace in their heart to know that they have made such a sacrifice on the alter of freedom, by losing not one, but two sons, and that we, as law enforcement officers and fellow Americans, would do well to always remember freedom isn't free. And to you Tom, may our Lord walk with you as you patrol the streets of heaven, knowing you have done your job, and did it well. God bless you, police officers everywhere, and God Bless America.\n\nDetective Ron Tomassi\n\nPalm Beach Sheriff's Office-Florida\n\nI will never forget that day. Wathing the television and seeing the devastation. I remember vividly watching and thinking my God all those policeman and firefighters. I had family there as well. They survived.\n\nI had to do something so I did what I could. I volunteered at the morgue representing an out of state agency. I will remember every day of my life all the flagged draped stretchers brought into the morgue and thinking my God look at all the policeman and firefighters.\n\nI see you all in my dreams quite often. I remember you all everyday and think about that day everyday. You are all heroes and are my inspiration to lace up my boots! I only hope and pray that I can be half the officer you are. Rest in peace.\n\nA brother who remembers.\n\nAnonymous\n\nREST IN PEACE BROTHR AND KNOW YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DID ON THIS TRADGIC DAY\n\nROBERT THORNTON\n\nEX-POLICE OFFICER AT GROUND ZERO\n\nI wish I could have met you.

And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.\n\nHis eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns. He had a name writeten that no one knew exept himself.\n\nHe was clothed witha robe dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.\n\nAnd the armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean, followed Him on white horses.\n\nNow out of His mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it He should strike the nations. And He Himself will rule with a rod of iron. He Himself treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.\n\nAnd He has on His robe and on His thigh a name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.\" -- Revelation 19:11.\n\nMay God bless you and the sacrafice of all of our brothers and sisters who committ ourselves everyday to the safety and security of our streets, towns, and cities.

David Taylor, Greensboro PD, On August 7, 2001. I was in NY for my fiancee's Mother's funeral the first of Sept. I was stranded there for 3 weeks due to this atrocity. As I watched the events on TV, I cried for all those who lost their lives. But was especially emotional about the Police Officers and the Firefighters and their families, as I had just recently suffered a tragic loss myself. As I walked through the streets in the days following the attack, I cried with pride as I saw the officers on duty on all the corners in the city. I knew how hard it was for them, knowing they had lost their friends. On the Sat. following the attack I was at St. Patrick's for mass. The last 2 people to go up and take communion were 2 NYPD officers, again I cried. I hope all of you are getting the support that my family and I got when we needed it, from the Deparment. I know the comforting words and even the funny stories the officers tell us about my brother helps. I know that our loved ones who are gone from here, had a higher calling and are happy and at peace in Heaven. Hopefully we can all feel that same peace one day! God bless All of you! And God bless America!\n\nTracy Taylor\n\nThomasville, NC\n\nSister of Greensboro Det.David L Taylor\n\nEOW 8/7/01\n\nTRACY TAYLOR\n\nBlessed are the peacemakers,For they shall be called sons of God.\" Matthew 5:9\n\nAnonymous\n\nWant even more control of your Reflection?
