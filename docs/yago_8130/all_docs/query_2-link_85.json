        "text": "As a child in Southern California, Nicholus Warstadt spent a lot of time in emergency rooms on account of his severe asthma, and he often wondered how doctors knew how to make people feel better. After college, he went to Stanford Medical School and decided to specialize in emergency medicine. This past spring, Warstadt was a second-year resident at N.Y.U. Langone Health. “My favorite thing about my specialty is that I take care of everyone, regardless of their ability to pay,” he told me. His own pay, when he began the residency, was a little more than sixty thousand dollars per year, roughly the median household income in Manhattan. He often worked sixty hours in a week, meaning that he was making about twenty dollars per hour. He will be able to earn many times that in a few years, as a board-certified emergency physician, but only after completing more than a dozen years of higher education and accruing about three hundred thousand dollars in student loans. The average debt for medical-school graduates is about two hundred thousand. “So much of your life is delayed, a lot of it due to finances,” Warstadt said. “I wouldn’t want this for my kids, because of the stress.” Medical residents suffer from unusually high rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation.\n\nWhen the coronavirus came to New York City, in mid-March, Warstadt was redirected from a pediatrics emergency room to a COVID-19 respiratory unit, where he worked about four twelve-hour shifts per week. By April, hundreds of New Yorkers were dying from COVID-19 each day; medical residents and fellows were working new and expanded jobs, which reduced the time they spent learning. “I think the hardest part was not knowing if or when it was ever going to end,” Warstadt said. Some private hospitals began offering hazard pay. N.Y.U. Langone Health—a private, nonprofit, multibillion-dollar hospital system with dozens of locations in New York and a few in Florida—did not. Many of N.Y.U. Langone’s nearly seventeen hundred trainee physicians spend part of their time at the city-funded Bellevue Hospital. Some of them are technically employed by the city and are unionized; Warstadt is a union delegate at Bellevue. In early April, a handful of residents drafted a letter asking for hazard pay, increased life and disability insurance, and protections for those who contract COVID-19. “As the demand placed on our hospital systems skyrockets, our risk of hospital-acquired infection increases,” the letter said. “We are honored and willing to take on these greater clinical responsibilities. But along with this comes an increased risk for disability and death.” They shared the letter with trainees across the hospital system, initially by text message. More than five hundred trainee physicians, including Warstadt, signed it.\n\nWhile the letter was circulating among residents and fellows, it leaked to Michael Ambrosino, the associate dean for graduate medical education, and to Steven Abramson, a vice-dean and chair of N.Y.U. Langone’s Department of Medicine. Ambrosino and Abramson e-mailed residents on April 9th, declining their requests. During a pandemic, Ambrosino and Abramson wrote, insurance companies were unwilling to increase their coverage, and, “given the increasing financial uncertainties for all of our institutions, ‘hazard pay’ is not feasible at this time.” Abramson told me that administrators were focussed on averting layoffs and furloughs for the hospital system’s employees. “We understood how hard these residents were working in very difficult circumstances,” Abramson said. “What we did in response was to give them our reasons.”\n\nAfter responding to the letter, Abramson exchanged e-mails with hospital leaders as they prepared a more detailed statement. N.Y.U. Langone was losing money at an alarming rate, and was facing a potential billion-dollar deficit if the coronavirus outbreak did not improve by June. The letter from residents had argued that all front-line workers deserved increased compensation—but, even so, Abramson proposed a response that emphasized the unfairness of giving hazard pay to one group of hospital workers and not others. He also circulated an e-mail that one of the medical chairs had sent to his department. “Now is the time to accept the hazards of caring for the sick . . . rather than focusing on making a few extra dollars,” that e-mail read. “I am not indifferent to your anxieties but personally feel demanding hazard pay is not becoming of a compassionate and caring physician.”\n\nLater that day, these e-mails were sent to medical residents by mistake. “I can’t even express how deeply wounding it is to have my compassion, caring and maturity called into question by my leadership,” Colleen Farrell, then a third-year internal-medicine resident, wrote on Twitter, after reading them. (Farrell had not signed the letter from trainee physicians.) Warstadt told me, “We felt like we were just being gaslit, like we were crazy for thinking about these things.” In one of the accidentally forwarded e-mails, a director asked which of his department’s fellows had signed the letter—which struck Warstadt and others as threatening. (Abramson, who told me that he saw the letter before it had any signatures attached, disagreed, saying that the director had simply wanted to understand the fellows’ concerns.) Some signatories asked the organizers of the letter to remove their names, for fear of retaliation. In the end, the list of names, which included almost a third of the hospital system’s residents and fellows, was not sent to senior leadership.\n\nOn April 10th, N.Y.U. Langone held a virtual “town hall” to discuss the concerns of trainees. The meeting was tense. “Not a single resident felt comfortable asking a question,” an internal-medicine resident told me. Instead, participants texted the chief residents who supervised them and who could raise questions anonymously. That same day, the leaked e-mails were posted anonymously on Reddit, where they drew tens of thousands of views and dozens of critical comments. Abramson told me that whoever leaked the e-mails had “unscrupulously weaponized internal documents on social media, out of context, to shame and defame other devoted physicians.”\n\nThree days later, in a follow-up e-mail to the trainees, Abramson and Ambrosino announced that a previously planned pay increase for trainee physicians, which was scheduled for July 1st, would be implemented retroactively from April 1st. In other words, medical residents would receive between thirteen and twenty-two hundred dollars in extra pay, depending on their year; some senior fellows would receive more. Abramson told me that the pay increase was a way to compensate trainees for the added responsibilities of the COVID-19 crisis but that it was not hazard pay. “Philosophically, we had trouble with the term ‘hazard pay,’ ” he said.\n\nA few days after the additional pay was announced, an eighteen-year-old journalism student at N.Y.U. published an opinion piece in a college paper, the Washington Square News, criticizing the hospital system’s media policy—which bars employees from speaking to the media without authorization—and arguing that its trainees deserved hazard pay on top of the retroactive raises. The Times, Bloomberg, and the Intercept had already reported on these topics, but the piece was thinly sourced and contained inaccuracies, and, three days later, the Washington Square News received a letter to the editor signed by Kenneth Langone, the billionaire and benefactor who serves as a board chairman of the hospital system. It was also signed by Abramson and five other top administrators. “We believe this ‘opinion piece’ ironically is ‘FAKE NEWS’ and an egregious misrepresentation that actually harms the efforts of heroic individuals working tirelessly to care for our patients,” they wrote, demanding its retraction. The newspaper published the letter and issued a correction, but responses continued to pour in. At the request of an N.Y.U. Langone spokesperson, about thirty hospital administrators sent their own critiques to the paper. Meanwhile, about half a dozen trainees e-mailed the paper in support of the piece. “I was happy that the student was trying to stand up for us, and it seemed to me like she was in tune with the sentiment among the residents,” Warstadt told me. “It’s just a very surreal response to a student newspaper article.” On April 24th, the Washington Square News retracted the piece.\n\nThe term “resident physician” stems from the nineteenth century, when trainees often lived in the hospital and were seen as in-house workers, or “house staff.” Today, when medical-school graduates start a residency program, they begin receiving a salary. But incoming residents don’t have the opportunity to negotiate or weigh competing offers: at the end of medical school, they arrive at a career-defining juncture known as the Match. In order to complete their training, they must submit a list of preferred residency programs to a private nonprofit called the National Resident Matching Program, which assigns each successful applicant to a single residency that will last at least three years. “On the same day, every medical student across the country opens an envelope, and that’s where you’re going,” Warstadt told me. “Individually, every resident doesn’t have a lot of power to make a change.” Because residents cannot easily pick up and go somewhere else, residency programs have less incentive than they might otherwise to compete with one another on pay or benefits, or to place limits on the twenty-four-hour shifts and eighty-hour work weeks that they are allowed to assign.\n\n“Physicians have recognized that The Match inculcates a culture of disenfranchisement, and the resulting lack of bargaining power sets the stage for abuse,” Ajay Major, an oncology fellow at the University of Chicago, wrote in a recent opinion piece for STAT. Too often, Major told me, residents and their more experienced counterparts, fellows, are labelled unprofessional if they demand better conditions. “Residents and house staff don’t feel like they can advocate for pay, basic necessities, benefits—where you would be able to in any other workforce,” he said. Major believes that a broader house-staff union movement could help trainees regain their bargaining power.\n\nBut calls for structural change come at an exceptionally difficult time for hospital finances. According to one estimate, U.S. hospitals were losing fifty billion dollars per month at the start of the pandemic, in part because COVID-19 halted so many profitable, non-urgent medical services. (Through the end of July, N.Y.U. Langone had realized operating losses of $1.4 billion across its hospitals and medical school, according to a spokesperson. It has received $570.1 million in government support, which covers less than half of the deficit.) The Resident & Fellow Physician Union — Northwest, a union for residents and fellows, was trying to negotiate for cost-of-living raises when, early in the pandemic, U.W. Medicine projected potential losses of half a billion dollars. “We certainly lowered our sights once COVID happened,” Brandon Peplinski, the union’s president, told me. Still, Peplinski believes that COVID-19 could bolster nascent organizing efforts by making the struggles of health-care workers more visible. He said that, in the past year, his union has been in touch with trainees from at least two dozen programs, and he expects many of them to unionize in the future. Other medical workers, such as nurses and medical technicians, have launched or accelerated union campaigns in response to the pandemic.\n\nAccording to many trainees I spoke with, the calls for hazard pay were not an end in themselves but a reflection of structural inequality in the medical profession. The N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine no longer charges tuition to the hundred medical students it admits each year, but, for most aspiring doctors, medical school may cost a quarter-million dollars over four years. This helps explain why a quarter of incoming medical students come from the top-earning five per cent of households, and only thirteen per cent come from the two-fifths of families that earn the least, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. The A.A.M.C. also found that Black, Hispanic, and indigenous doctors are badly underrepresented among active doctors.\n\nOne N.Y.U. Langone resident, a union delegate on the Bellevue payroll, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the particular predicament of medical workers during COVID-19. When the city’s crisis was at its worst and workers were most in need of support and protection, they had even less time and energy than usual to advocate for better working conditions. At the time, the resident was completing twelve-hour shifts at 7:30 P.M. each evening, getting home at 8:30 P.M., and then spending an hour catching up on messages from other residents, who did most of their organizing between 9 P.M. and midnight. The effort sounded impossible to sustain, and perhaps it has been—several trainees told me that they were tired of fighting and eventually moved on to broader causes not specific to their work, including the nationwide protests for racial justice."
