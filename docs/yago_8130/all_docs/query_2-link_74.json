        "text": "SPRINGFIELD - City building inspectors stopped work at the SilverBrick Square project, 122 Chestnut St., and have cited both the building owner and the contractor after finding unlicensed workers installing plumbing at the $6.2 million, 99-apartment renovation project.\n\nInspectors found workers using substandard materials on bathroom and kitchen plumbing and sanding the colors off pipe to hide that fact, said Steve Desilets, Springfield building commissioner. The colors on pipes show what grade they are.\n\nDesilets said code violations at the site have been an ongoing problem. The Republican is seeking more detail on the history of code enforcement at the site.\n\nInspectors visiting the job site Tuesday also found other problems, such as pipes running through concrete walls without protective sleeves and improper venting of plumbing work.\n\nOn Wednesday, the city issued citations to both SilverBrick Group, of New York City, which bought the property in January for $4.8 million, and to plumber Mikhail K. Shtefan, of West Springfield, Disilets said. Fines could go as high as $1,000 per violation of the code.\n\nThe city also sent notice to the state, which might now conduct hearings to revoke Shtefan's license.\n\nState records show that he has no pending discipline.\n\nShtefan doesn't have a listed phone number for his plumbing business.\n\nAaron Papowitz, founder and managing principal of the SilverBrick Group, in an email response sent late Wednesday afternoon to inquires from The Republican, said, \"We are gathering info,\" but provided no further details.\n\nIn May, the City Council approved up to $150,000 over 10 years in tax incentives for the project. The incentives are tax savings on the value SilverBrick plans to add to the property, not the assessed value when it bought the building.\n\nThe May vote reversed the council's rejection of the tax incentive plan in March, when it questioned the use of tax incentives for a housing development and expressed concerns about the displacement of existing low-income residents who could not afford the higher rent.\n\nSince work began this summer, local construction unions have protested the use of unlicensed construction workers at the site.\n\nMichael Langone, business manager and financial secretary of Plumbers & Pipefitters Local 104 and president of the Pioneer Valley Building Trades Council, said the workers are from out of state.\n\nThe unions, he said, want to make sure jobs on projects that get tax breaks go to local residents who are licensed to do the work. That doesn't necessarily mean union shops, he said, noting there are open shops with nonunion plumbers who do quality work.\n\n\"We are supposed to have a responsible employer ordinance in this city, but no one is enforcing it,\" he said.\n\nLangone said that he was working Wednesday with SilverBrick to get union contractors on the site to see what was done, learn what must be done and what might have to be redone so work can resume.\n\nSilverBrick already owns 280 apartments downtown at SilverBrick Lofts - the former Morgan Square Apartments. SilverBrick bought Morgan Square for $9 million in 2014, and the company has done approximately $6 million in renovations.\n\nSilverBrick also has plans to renovate the largely vacant Cabotville Mill in Chicopee Center into a mixed use complex including apartments.\n\nThis story was updated Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2018 at 5:12 p.m. with a response from Silverbrick management"
