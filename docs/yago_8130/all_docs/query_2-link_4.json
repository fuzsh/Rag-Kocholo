        "text": "My father, a renowned diagnostic radiologist, inspired me to pursue a career in medicine. I chose to specialize in radiation oncology because of the opportunity to directly interact with patients and deliver treatments that have the potential to fight cancer.\n\nI have more than 30 years of experience in the treatment of prostate cancer, and during this time, radiation oncology has been transformed. I am passionate about working in a field that is constantly evolving and where so many exciting technological innovations are helping to treat diseases with more accuracy, leading to increased chances for cure, with fewer side effects.\n\nI have extensive experience in various radiotherapy techniques for treating prostate cancer. I was instrumental in developing therapies such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which uses technology to deliver high doses of radiation more precisely to a tumor, and image-guided radiotherapy, in which radiation beams precisely target a tumor through the help of focused imaging, such as CT scans and MRIs.\n\nMore recently, I developed extensive experience using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), which delivers targeted radiation in as few as five sessions and has low rates of long-term side effects. I also specialize in brachytherapy, in which internal radiation is placed and delivered directly to the site of the tumor. I have been recognized for developing and refining ways to combine SBRT and brachytherapy: these have shown success in treating advanced prostate cancer. I consider myself fortunate to have had the opportunity to develop these innovative treatments that are making a positive difference in people’s lives.\n\nAt NYU Langone’s Perlmutter Cancer Center, we have access to the latest and most advanced technologies in radiation therapy. Our magnetic resonance imaging–guided linear accelerator (MRI-LINAC) combines MRI technology with radiation therapy to deliver highly targeted radiation doses that can make submillimeter adjustments in real time. This ensures that the tumor is precisely targeted while limiting exposure to healthy tissues.\n\nWhen patients come to me for treatment, I make sure I understand their goals for therapy and what is important for maintaining their quality of life. I take the time to explain the disease and treatment options available and work with patients and other members of the multidisciplinary team to develop treatment plans that best match their needs and that are also the most effective. I treat my patients the way I treat any member of my family—with compassion, personal care, and attention to detail.\n\nI am working closely with NYU’s Department of Physics to develop sophisticated software that can more effectively integrate critical information from diagnostic scans to deliver more precise and targeted radiation to prostate cancer tumors. I have also developed protocols that explore the role of genetic markers that can be used to predict the aggressiveness of cancer and tailor the treatment to each person and the disease.\n\nI have served as president and chairman of the American Brachytherapy Society and also serve as editor-in-chief of their journal, Brachytherapy. I have coauthored more than 350 peer-reviewed articles in leading medical journals on the management of prostate cancer with various radiotherapy techniques. Many of these articles have helped change the way prostate cancer is treated around the world. I have been honored to receive several awards, including the American Brachytherapy Society’s Ulrich Henschke Award for contributions and excellence in the field of radiation oncology."
