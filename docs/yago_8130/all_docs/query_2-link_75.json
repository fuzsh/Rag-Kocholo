        "text": "Michael P. Milham, MD, PhD, is an internationally recognized neuroscience researcher, the Chief Science Officer and the founding director of the Center for the Developing Brain at the Child Mind Institute. He is also a practicing child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\nDr. Milham’s research interests include investigating how functional and structural connectivity in the brain may underlie differing forms of mental illness, and seeking to chart the course of brain development in healthy and affected children.\n\nIn order to accomplish these goals, Dr. Milham has worked to advance a Big Data research agenda in the neuroimaging community, which focuses on open data sharing as a means of achieving the large-scale samples needed to capture the broader range of presentations in psychiatry. He co-founded the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project and founded its International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative (INDI). These efforts have helped to bring major consortia to the community, including the ADHD 200, Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR).\n\nDr. Milham is also the founder and director of the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample initiative, which has worked to map brain development, maturation and aging (ages 6 to 85 years old) in 1000 individuals from the Rockland Community, openly sharing all data generated with other scientists.\n\nMost recently, he has founded the Child Mind Institute Healthy Brain Network – an initiative aiming to create a large-scale (10,000 participants) resource for the scientific community to study child and adolescent mental health.\n\nDr. Milham is one of our nation’s most prolific neuroimaging researchers, with over 250 articles published since 2005 and recognition as one of Thomson Reuters/Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers (top 1 percent for Neuroscience and Behavior) every year since 2014. He was also the recipient of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping’s highly prestigious Wiley Young Investigator Award in 2014.\n\nHe has published in the most scientifically respected journals, including the American Journal of Psychiatry, Journal of Neuroscience, Biological Psychiatry, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science and JAMA-Psychiatry. He has also received honors and funding support from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH).\n\nDr. Milham continues to treat a range of child, adolescent and adult patients for mental illness, both with medications and psychotherapy.\n\nDirector, Center for Biomedical Imaging and Neuromodulation, Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research, New York State Office of Mental Health (2014-present)\n\nAssociate Director, Phyllis Green and Randolph Cōwen Institute for Pediatric Neuroscience, NYU Child Study Center (2009-2011)\n\nLeon Levy Assistant Professor, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, NYU Langone Medical Center (2009-2011)\n\nChief of Functional Imaging, NYU Child Study Center (2004-2009)\n\nCo-founder, 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (2009-present)\n\nFounder, International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative (INDI) (2010-present)\n\nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry Fellow, NYU Child Study Center\n\nGeneral Psychiatry Resident, NYU Langone Medical Center\n\nFellow, Beckman Institute Neuroscience Program\n\nPhD, Cognitive/Clinical Neuroscience and Psychophysiology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nMD, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nBS, Biological Sciences and Computer Sciences, Duke University"
