        "text": "NYU Langone Medical Center, a world-class, integrated, academic medical center, is one of the nation’s premier centers for excellence in clinical care, biomedical research and medical education.\n\nLocated in the heart of Manhattan, NYU Langone is composed of multiple hospitals and training facilities: Tisch Hospital, its flagship acute care facility;\n\nHospital for Joint Diseases , one of only five hospitals in the nation dedicated to orthopaedics and rheumatology;\n\nHassenfeld Pediatric Center, a comprehensive pediatric hospital supporting a full array of children’s health services;\n\nRusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine, the world’s first university-affiliated facility devoted entirely to rehabilitation medicine;\n\nThe NYU School of Medicine, which has trained thousands of physicians and scientists who have helped to shape the course of medical history.\n\nB.R. Fries is a dedicated, on-call healthcare construction resource for NYU Langone. Over the years, we have performed numerous projects for the medical center including the Smilow Comprehensive Prostate Cancer Center, The Dermatopathology Section of the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology, the Hospital for Joint Disease Outpatient Clinics, the Brain Aging & Dementia Center, the CBI Radiology Department, Central Distribution and Truck Loading Facility, the NYU Langone Emergency Department and the Seventh Avenue Medical Offices.\n\nB.R. Fries is currently performing rehabilitation projects caused by damage from Hurricane Sandy. We are also building a new hospital cafeteria and foodservice facility.\n\nB.R. Fries offers true healthcare credentials, experience and in-house expertise. While many contractors broker critical aspects of a project, we work hands-on with a full staff of preconstruction and construction professionals with specific expertise in healthcare. B.R. Fries knows how to tackle the unique challenges that healthcare construction presents. And most of all, we work in a way that ensures uninterrupted patient care and patient, staff and visitor safety.\n\n“B.R. Fries is top notch in my book. K-Mart is a corporation of change. We believe that change\n\nequals progress and it is nothing for us to change the whole design of a project mid-stream.\n\nAnd guess what? The opening date never changes. B.R. Fries has worked on over Kmart\n\nprojects in the area; they really know how to get things done.”\n\nFrank Gabeletto, Senior Project Manager\n\nKmart “For MPA’s relocation we were faced with a very short window to\n\ncomplete a total build out. Any time overruns would have resulted\n\nin severe financial penalties. B.R. Fries not only delivered a high-quality\n\nproduct on time and on budget, they also delivered creative solutions\n\nthroughout the project that were truly impressive.”\n\nMichael Pashby, General Manager Magazine Publishers of America"
