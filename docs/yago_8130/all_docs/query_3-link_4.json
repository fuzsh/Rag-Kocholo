        "text": "About the Book\n\nPeople are different, and different people will respond to the same environment in different ways. That is why the first clinical rule in working with former cult members and families is to remain flexible and not rigidly adhere to a clinical ideology. The chapters in this book reflect this attitude of openness, while describing how different experts approach the kinds of problems that might confront therapists working with former cult members and those with affected loved ones.\n\nThough primarily aimed at helpers, the clearly written chapters of this 500-page book can help family members and former members of cultic situations, including those born or raised in such environments.\n\n“Decades of valuable and useful research and treatment experience are contained in these essays. Nothing comparable exists in current mental health literature. It will be the standard reference for treating cult victims for years to come.”\n\n—Stephen Kent, PhD, University of Alberta\n\n“Never before has there been so instructive a collection of information on cult-relevant treatment issues. This book should be in easy reach on the shelf of any clinician who provides such treatment.”\n\n—Robert Cialdini, PhD, Author of Influence and Pre-Suasion\n\n“There was once a dispute about cultic groups and whether they are often pernicious. This wise and humane book puts to rest that question. A wealth of clinical material detailed in these pages should help those counseling anyone coming out of totalistic communities. The stories are sometimes sad, the models for healing individual and families inspiring. As a close colleague of Robert Jay Lifton for 45 years, I was impressed with the range of approaches described in this book. There is nothing dogmatic in these pages.”\n\n—Charles B. Strozier, author and coeditor, The Fundamentalist Mindset;\n\nauthor, Until the Fires Stopped Burning: 9/11 and New York City in the Words and\n\nExperiences of Survivors and Witnesses; and author, Heinz Kohut: The Making of a Psychoanalyst\n\n“Cult Recovery… is a sound, solid, information-packed yet compassionate guide to working with survivors of cults and other types of organized abuse. Never sensational or dramatic, it is filled with rich clinical and didactic information that therapists need to help patients who have been through cult experiences and still suffer the consequences of them.\n\n—Janina Fisher, PhD, author of Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors\n\nand coauthor of Sensorimotor Psychotherapy: Interventions for Trauma and Attachment\n\n“I have been looking forward to this book becoming a reality. At last, a comprehensive guide to recommend to students and professionals wishing to learn more about how to help those affected by abusive groups. Through the contributions of leading experts dedicated over the years to helping those harmed by a cult experience, the editors have done an outstanding job of bringing together accumulated knowledge and new insights on cult recovery. A must-read for students and mental health professionals interested in setting a high bar for further work with those who suffer.”\n\n—Carmen Almendros, PhD, Associate Professor\n\nin Clinical and Health Psychology, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spain"
