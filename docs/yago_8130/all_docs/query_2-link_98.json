        "text": "The Volusia Sheriff's Office will seek restitution for the cost of the resources used in response to the false 911 texts.\n\nThe 11-year-old Port Orange girl accused of sending fake 911 texts claiming her friend was abducted by an armed kidnapper will not be charged as an adult, a State Attorney’s Office spokesman said.\n\nBryan Shorstein, the spokesman for 7th Circuit State Attorney R.J. Larizza’s office, said that prosecutors had not yet decided what charges to file against Ava Rose Langone, but her case will be handled in juvenile court.\n\nThe Volusia Sheriff’s Office initially charged her with making a false police report concerning using a firearm in a violent manner, which is a felony, and misuse of 911, a misdemeanor.\n\nThe girl was released to her parents at a juvenile detention hearing on July 27, Shorstein said in a previous story. She has another hearing Monday.\n\nLangone was placed on house arrest and is being supervised by her parents Amanda and Michael Langone. If they are not available, she must be supervised by her grandmother. They could not be reached for comment.\n\nNormally, law enforcement officials do not release the name of juvenile offenders. But under state law, the name, age, photo and other identifying information of juveniles charged with what would amount to felony counts can be released.\n\nEven though she is in the juvenile system, Langone can still be charged with a felony, Shorstein said.\n\nHe referred to Florida Statute 985.031, which states that a child younger than 7 may not be arrested, charged or judged delinquent unless the violation is a forcible felony, including such crimes as murder, manslaughter, sexual battery, kidnapping and aggravated battery.\n\nAdditional laws come into consideration when a child is 14 or older under Florida Statute 985.556.\n\nFalse kidnapping report\n\nThe case sent law enforcement scrambling on July 26 when the girl reported that her 14-year-old friend had been taken by an armed kidnapper driving a white van traveling south on Interstate 95 in Oak Hill, the sheriff’s office stated.\n\nThe girl sent a message saying she was in a blue Jeep following the kidnapper’s van on I-95 in Oak Hill. Multiple deputies responded, along with police from Edgewater, New Smyrna Beach and Port Orange. A sheriff’s helicopter also joined the search for the suspect and the van.\n\nFor 90 minutes, the girl texted updates including a description of the suspect, who she reported had a gun, sheriff's spokeswoman Laura Williams said. Deputies and police found no suspect or van, but they did find the girl at her home in Port Orange after tracing the messages.\n\nThe girl’s father told deputies she was at home. As deputies approached the girl, her cellphone rang when 911 dispatchers called.\n\n\"I'm telling you right now you're going to take this as a lesson at 11 years old when you do something stupid in the future you're going to enjoy those cuffs,\" the girl's father is heard saying.\n\n\"I'm not going to do this again,\" the crying 11-year-old is heard saying.\n\nShe was transported to the Family Resource Center for processing, then transferred to the Volusia Regional Juvenile Detention Center in Daytona Beach, Williams said.\n\nThe sheriff's office stated Friday that it will seek restitution for the cost of the resources used in the response to her texts. Spokesman Andrew Gant wrote that that the rate for Air One, the helicopter, is $625.29 an hour. The sheriff's office will seek $1,246.29 for all costs, including the helicopter.\n\nJames D. Crock, a criminal defense attorney not involved in the girl's case, said in a phone interview that he disagreed with how deputies handled the situation.\n\n\"What’s most troubling about this story is that the entire justice system, whether it be the police or prosecutors, involves exercising discretion and good judgement,\" Crock said in a phone interview.\n\nHe said once officials determined it was a false complaint and ensured no one was harmed, they \"misuse their discretion and put this 11-year-old child in handcuffs and arrest her and keep her in custody (which) will undoubtably lead to a tremendous trauma in her life that may last with her the rest of her life and it didn’t need to be done. They need to investigate, but they don’t need to overact.\"\n\nAsked for a response on Friday through his media office, Volusia Sheriff Mike Chitwood responded: “I really don’t care what Frank Fernandez or his latest defense attorney have to say.”\n\nBut in a previous release Chitwood stated: “This kind of prank activity is dangerous – we’re going to investigate every incident, but today it wasted valuable resources that might have helped someone else who legitimately needed our help.\"\n\nAnother case involving false threats; this one in Alabama\n\nThe 11-year-old girl’s case brings to mind the recent case of Carlethia “Carlee” Nichole Russell, an Alabama woman who vanished on July 13 for two days. Russell went missing after she called 911 saying she had seen a toddler along a highway. She reappeared at her house two days later and said she had been kidnapped. But later admitted to making up the story about the toddler and the abduction.\n\nRussell, 25, was charged last month with two misdemeanors: false reporting to law enforcement authorities and falsely reporting an incident, according to news accounts. Russell was released from an Alabama jail after posting bond, which was $1,000 on each charge.\n\nAn Alabama lawmaker has since said she intends to introduce bills making such false reports a felony, according to news accounts. Officials have also said they will seek restitution from Russell for the resources used in the search."
