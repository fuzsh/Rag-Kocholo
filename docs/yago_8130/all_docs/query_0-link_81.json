        "text": "As we continue with a review of the question- Is Simple Assault a Vital Part of the Word of Faith Fellowship Practices?– let me acknowledge how absurd the question may sound to some and how obvious the answer may seem to others. For those that have only seen the sweet side of Jane Whaley and never lived inside the group under the ongoing, smothering, confining fear-hold that she has on her faithful members- then yes, even the question is surreal. For those individuals, I ask you to hang on and finish reading the series before you totally dismiss the question. My hopes are to at least give you some food for thought concerning your ideas of conduct inside Word of Faith Fellowship (WOFF).\n\nBefore this series is over, I hope to give everyone reasons to pause and consider the practices of WOFF in a new light. In order to do this, we will eventually be breaking down and discussing what has become ominously known as the “Injunction” from June of 2005. For those that may not know, WOFF sued Rutherford County Department of Social Services (RCDSS) and in June of 2005, there was a COMPROMISE reached. The stipulations of the compromise worked out by lawyers from each side included guidelines for handling of certain types of complaints concerning the conduct of WOFF members. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nContinue reading Is Simple Assault a Vital Part of the Word of Faith Fellowship Practices? (2) →\n\nThere are few weeks that go by in which I do not talk to or communicate in some way with a survivor of a cult. These contacts are not always survivors of Word of Faith Fellowship (WOFF). Early on in my journey of seeking answers and writing this blog, I came in contact with survivors of other groups and after speaking for a short time, we would most always agree on some common points for methods of recruitment or control of members in our respective groups. On occasion, I have been in conversations where would tell the most extreme characteristic of our group and wait for the other person to try and top it! Laughter would often ensue which we preferred over crying. Common threads would emerge and we often would express our surprise that other groups employed similar measures and had similar results.\n\nTwo areas that often receive a lot of attention are how a person went in to the group and how they came out. The coming out usually had more emotional drama than the going in. Who would imagine that? I will never forget the question of a person I worked with when I first explained why my life was changing in 2008. “How could an intelligent person like you get involved in something like that?” My first response was “One lie at a time…” Now, at the time, I was thinking about my believing one lie at a time and ignoring the uncomfortable feeling inside that was trying to get my attention. I can’t say I always could tell a lie from the truth. But, many times, I at least had a faint awareness that something was not right. The part I did not see at the time was the guided planned effort of WOFF and other groups to base their recruitment on those lies and thus count on deception to obtain new members.\n\nAll of this has been in the fore front of my thinking these last few days as the week’s events have unfolded. Just this evening, I commented to another survivor, “The longer you are out, the more lies you learn about that were used against you while inside.” And just because you leave, does not mean you are able to instantly tell what was a manufactured lie told you inside and what the actual truth was about a situation. It is odd that once you leave you are instantly called a liar when you try to tell what truthfully happened while inside WOFF. I suppose a person inside needs to label outsiders liars to protect themselves from having to recognize the truth inside their group and cause them even more mental anguish over their own choices.\n\nContinue reading The Questions Keep Coming- Why Do People Join Cults? (1) →\n\nIn the previous post, we used as a resource the book, “Recovery From Cults” – Help for Victims of Psychological and Spiritual Abuse– Edited by Michael Langone- (copyright © 1993 American Family Foundation – ISBN 0-393-31321-2). Today, we will return to this resource for the material in Chapter 2. The title of the chapter is “A Little Carrot And A Lot of Stick- A Case Example” by Janja Lalich. The author outlines the formation, operations and eventual implosion of a political cult in which she was a part of that lasted from 1974 until 1985. I have been amazed at the similarities between many of the inner workings and dynamics between this group and Word of Faith Fellowship (WOFF). For now, I have not done the research to find out the name of group or its leader, which the author covers with pseudonyms. Let’s go directly to the comparisons which caught my attention.\n\nWhen describing the ages of the founding members of the WDU, Lalich writes, “ Baxter was 39 years old, while most of the others were in there mid 20s, which meant that they (with one exception) were 7 to 20 years younger than Baxter.” (page 54) It was similar with WOFF at the beginning- if you just look at Jane’s age compared to her main leadership. I suspect Jane is mid 70s (WOFF stopped celebrating birthdays – so who is counting?) and the rest of her main leadership early to mid 50s. There is another layer of leadership around Robin’s age that is even younger than the main leadership. What does this matter? Well, certainly Jane could/would use the reasoning that she had been walking with God longer than anyone- who is to doubt her? Right.\n\nContinue reading “I didn’t want her screaming at me….” →\n\nIn previous posts, we have used as a resource the book, “Recovery From Cults” – Help for Victims of Psychological and Spiritual Abuse– Edited by Michael Langone- (copyright © 1993 American Family Foundation – ISBN 0-393-31321-2). Today, we will return to this resource for the material in Chapter 2. The title of the chapter is “A Little Carrot And A Lot of Stick- A Case Example” by Janja Lalich. The author outlines the formation, operations and eventual implosion of a political cult in which she was a part of that lasted from 1974 until 1985. Why should I even cover this chapter on this blog? I was amazed at the similarities between many of the inner workings and dynamics between this group and Word of Faith Fellowship (WOFF). There were obviously different terms and “reasons” to submit to the group leader- but, as we review this chapter, notice the similar control dynamics and the results on the members.\n\nAs an introduction and a way to answer some obvious questions, the author writes, “This chapter outlines the makings, workings and eventual demise of the “Workers Democratic Union.” I use pseudonyms for the name of the group, the leader, and all former members; also I use the terms organization, group and party interchangeably throughout. Since the group was leftist in orientation, I wish to make it clear that this is not a critique of political ideologies, nor an attempt to conclude that the organizational methodology of Marxism-Leninism necessarily leads to cultic formation. The Workers Democratic Union (WDU) was unique in many ways, but nonetheless a cult like so many others in the techniques used to dominate and control its members.” (page 52)\n\nThis paragraph contains a great point. As Marxism-Leninism may not necessarily lead to the formation of a cult neither does the organization of an Evangelical, Protestant church with Charismatic beliefs and practices. The direction of any group is greatly, if not totally, affected by the leader, their desires, their weaknesses and strengths. As with this group and their leader- Doreen Baxter, so with WOFF; Jane Whaley is the hub of the wheel, the engine that makes WOFF what it is and why it is.\n\nContinue reading My Passion- My Weakness? →\n\nIn the last post, we used this book, “Recovery From Cults” – Help for Victims of Psychological and Spiritual Abuse– Edited by Michael Langone- (copyright © 1993 American Family Foundation – ISBN 0-393-31321-2) as a resource. Today, we will continue in this resource and compare more material to my experience in Word of Faith Fellowship (WOFF). I experience a gamut of emotions when I discover results from studies used in a resource book that coincide or mirror what I experienced at WOFF. It brings me joy and sadness at the same time to identify with material that researchers have discovered about cult groups- religious or otherwise. The years within the group can’t be changed, but, by sharing my thoughts on this blog, I hope to help others who have been in such groups find resources that will help. There is sadness in knowing that those I love and cherish are still a part of WOFF.\n\nWhere is your happy face? How many times did we hear that, say that, think that, while inside WOFF? Now, don’t get me wrong, every group that asks that question of their children or even the adults is not automatically a cult. But, as we review the following excerpt, just remember what it felt like when you were asked that question or witnessed others being prodded and pushed to smile- no matter how ugly or emotional the scene had become. Remember the consequences for those children who would not submit to the prod and crack even a little smile. For sure, the use of this saying would ebb and flow over the years. But, no one can deny that “Where is your happy face?” was a favorite for years at WOFF.\n\nIn our resource text, the editor reviews different research studies along with clinical observations which tell when people are most likely to join a cult as well as the circumstances around a person leaving a cult.\n\nContinue reading Where is Your Happy Face? →\n\nWhen I first began this blog, it was so important to me to tell what had happened to me and my thoughts about those events. I started recording my memories as early as October of 2008. From those writings, my desire to start this blog was born. As I first started, it was such a relief to put into words my questions, emotions, feelings and concerns. Starting in January of 2010, I began on a regular basis to tell what had up until that point had only been shared in forums by other ex-members. Eventually, I began to compare my experiences to insights and material in books written about other groups. Along the way, we have compared Word of Faith Fellowship (WOFF) to other groups and found WOFF to not be so unique. Jane Whaley may seemingly have a unique “gift”. But, in reality, her methods and means are not new, but are found in many other religious cults. She may have used different shellac on the outside, but what goes on behind the closed doors is as predictable as any other religious cult. The longer I am out, the more certain this observation becomes.\n\nPreviously, we have used this book, “Recovery From Cults” – Help for Victims of Psychological and Spiritual Abuse– Edited by Michael Langone- (copyright © 1993 American Family Foundation – ISBN 0-393-31321-2) as a resource. In previous posts; we have reviewed material written about and by Dr. Margaret Singer. Here is one of them:\n\nDr. Margaret Singer–Voice for the Cult Survivor – https://religiouscultsinfo.com/?p=3789\n\nToday, I will quote more from this resource and share some questions. In the last week of so, I have been talking to other survivors and reading this book. There are some insights which are found in the book that go right along with our discussions. Even though this book was published almost twenty years ago and uses some sources from the 1970’s; there is some important background information about cults as well as other material which is still valid.\n\nContinue reading Post- Cult Questions and Struggles (Video) →\n\n“Yes, I’ve been very preoccupied with the survivor all through my work”. – Robert Jay Lifton\n\n(source link- http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/r/robertjayl375345.html )\n\nWe have quoted Robert Lifton in previous posts. His research work included studying survivors of POW camps during the Korean War as well as the survivors of Hiroshima and returning Vietnam War Veterans. His work on thought reform and study of brainwashing has been a foundation for understanding mind control and its effects. He also studied the Nazi doctors and the psychology of genocide. I hope to learn more about his work in that area and relate it to his work on thought reform. His work is a part of the Holocaust picture I had not previously considered or learned about.\n\nAfter being under what I now believe were very developed and effective mind control techniques used at Word of Faith Fellowship (WOFF) by Jane Whaley and her leadership, I consider myself a survivor. No, I did not realize that what I was going through was mind control and thought reform. But, how many victims of an environment like WOFF actually know with clarity what is happening to them? For years, I knew I had problems with some of the methods, but, I suppressed my doubts long enough for at least some of the controls to work. I attended my first service at WOFF in May of 1992. My last time on the grounds of WOFF was June 6, 2008 in the evening. Since I was involved for so long a time, I would be a fool to not admit that some of the mind control methods had an effect on my thinking and way of life. It is only after I left and began to research thought control and other cult groups, that I was able to see the similarities of the practices between WOFF/Jane Whaley and other groups.\n\nWhile a member of WOFF, the techniques of control were either denied as control or labeled as “God’s ways”. Does that surprise anyone? Shunning, public rebuke and information control were all labeled as “the ways of God” or for those who “walk in the Spirit”. We have listed these techniques in previous posts, the introduction of which is found here… Thought Reform? At WOFF? (1)- https://religiouscultsinfo.com/?p=3225 The purpose of this post is not to go over the mind control techniques, but, only to reference the fact that I am a survivor of them.\n\nContinue reading Survivor or Victim? →"
