It will explain cult trauma through the lens of attachment and offer six therapeutic tasks that improve cult recovery.\n\nIn addition to the well-established psychosocial approach to cult recovery this developmental and relational one adds important avenues to healing.\n\nIt focuses on resuming derailed psychosocial development, evaluating the intention of cult survivors and cult leaders, improving one’s ability to create and maintain relationships and enhancing cognitive and affective skills.\n\nUnderstanding this framework enables therapists to help survivors move more quickly to a mentalizing mode of experience where they more clearly understand the relationship between their internal and external reality. Along with this new perspective comes the possibility of helping cult survivors mentalize cult trauma, develop more secure attachments, and reclaim their resilience."
