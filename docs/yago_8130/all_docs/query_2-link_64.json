        "meta_description": "Throughout my training, several mentors have cemented themselves in my mind as examples of how to become a well-rounded, revered and respected surgeon and physician. Each one, in their own way, epitomized what it is to be a great human being, how to make well-informed and considerate decisions while being an exceptional diagnostician, and how to execute high level surgery – all with the goal of providing the best possible outcome and patient care. Additionally, at each stage in my career, my patients have crafted my understanding of the importance of what I do. The value of normal, painless and functional movement is priceless, and the ability to restore it when it's lost is a humbling endeavor. I am thankful for all my patients who have shown me the power of this experience.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to facilitate the return of painless, functional activity after an injury. This allows patients to return to the quality of life they expect and deserve with the best possible health care experience from start to finish.\r\n\r\nPatients can expect that I will listen earnestly to the narrative of the story that’s causing them pain or loss of function. We will have a thorough conversation about their injury and expectations after they recover. They can expect a thorough examination of their injury and a comprehensive review of their diagnostic tests and imaging. With this assessment, we will discuss – in easy-to-understand terms – what the problem is and what the potential solutions are. They can expect a surgeon who will only recommend surgery if a surgical fix is needed. If surgery is not needed, alternative non-surgical treatments will be recommended. If surgery is recommended, they can expect to leave the office informed about the surgery, with details of the procedure, recovery and expected return to full function. Above all else, I care deeply about each patient as an individual and am  invested in achieving the best possible outcome with them.\r\n\r\nAs a dual board-certified fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeon, I specialize in sports medicine surgery of the shoulder and knee, hip preservation surgery (including hip arthroscopy for treatment of hip impingement and labral tears, periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) for the treatment of hip dysplasia, and other complex joint preserving surgeries for adolescents and adults), as well as anterior hip and knee replacements. Additionally, I was a founding member of The Hip Center at Andrews Sports Medicine in Birmingham, Alabama. In this capacity, I’m primarily focused on treating patients with non-arthritic/preservation hip injuries, disorders and diseases.\r\n\r\nHaving acted as a member of the medical staff for various institutions and organizations, I bring extensive sports medicine experience working with professional, collegiate and student athletes.\r\n\r\nOutside of work, I serve as the medical officer and team physician for an organization dedicated to providing coaching, training and competition opportunities to athletes with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I also enjoy participating in athletic competitions around the world; over the past decade, I’ve competed in more than 10 Olympic distance triathlons, one full Ironman, multiple half Ironman races and seven marathons – where I twice qualified for the Boston marathon. I also enjoy golf, skiing, fly fishing and hiking.\r\n\r\nWhile I am originally from Colorado Springs, Colorado, I am thrilled to be living in Green Bay, Wisconsin, with my wife, daughter and dogs.\"",
