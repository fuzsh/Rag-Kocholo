        "text": "Gaston Eyskens Gaston Eyskens (1 April 1905 – 3 January 1988) was a Christian democratic politician and Prime Minister of Belgium. He was also an economist and member of the Belgian Christian Social Party. He served three terms as Prime Minister of Belgium, holding the position from 1949 to 1950, 1958 to 1961 and 1968 to 1973. During his periods in office, Eyskens was confronted with major ideological and linguistic conflicts within Belgium including the Royal Question in 1950, the School War in 1958 and the independence of the Belgian Congo in 1960.\n\nBelgium has granted Independence to Congo and it must be clear to everyone that it is impossible to reconsider this decision and it is also not the view of the government.\n\nBoudewijn: Naar het hart van de koning - aflevering 2, Een Coburg in Congo (4 Part Biographical documentary about King Baudouin) Eyskens gave this speech in July 1960 after King Baudouin had requested Eyskens to step down as first minister in order to put up a new governemnt, a new government that would prevent UN troops from Entering the then newly Independant Congo and the Province of Katanga which would practically nullify Congo's independence.\n\nKatanga that part of Congo where economic life has been resumed and where the prospects exist to develop a real prosperity for the benefit of the indigenous population, which is completely impossible in other areas of the Congo, where inrresponsible politics in less than 3 weeks have lead to utter anarchy.\n\nHistories: De Historie van Tshombe, Deel 1, 1997 (2 Part Biographical Documentary about Moïse Tshombe). Excerpt from a speech Eyskens gave to Secretary-General of the United Nations Dag Hammarskjöld in a visit to Belgium in August 1960 in the context of the then Congo Crisis."
