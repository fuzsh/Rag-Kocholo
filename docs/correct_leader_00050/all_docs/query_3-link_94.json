Margaret P. Grafeld Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 04 MAY 2006 Margaret P. Grafeld Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 04 MAY 2006 REF: BRUSSELS 3628 1. EGYPTIAN DCM (NEHAD ASKALANI - PROTECT -) TOLD US THAT BELGIAN GOVERNMENT HAD AGREED TO ALLOW OPENING OF PLO INFORMATION OFFICE IN BRUSSELS, WHICH WOULD BE LED BY NAIM KHADAR WHO IS CURRENTLY PLO REP HERE OPERATING OUT OF ARAB LEAGUE OFFICE. NEHAD SAID NO DATE FOR OPENING WAS FIXED AND OFFICE WOULD HAVE NO SPECIAL STATUS. HE SAID THAT FOREIGN MINISTRY DECISION WAS RESULT OF RECENT REQUEST BY ARAB CHIEFS OF MISSION POSTED IN BRUSSELS, FORMULATED DURING THEIR LAST PERIODIC MEETING AND TRANSMITTED TO FOREIGN MINISTRY BY IRAQI AMBASSADOR DURING HIS FAREWELL CALLS (HE IS BEING TRANSFERRED TO ATHENS). 2. FOREIGN MINISTRY'S DIRECTOR FOR MIDDLE EASTERN AFFAIRS (AMB PATERNOTTE) TOLD US ONLY THAT BELGIUM WAS \"CLOSER\" TO HAVING A PLO OFFICE AND THERE MIGHT BE ONE \"PERHAPS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER\". HE SAID THAT OPENING OF OFFICE WOULD REPRESENT ONLY \"RECOGNI- TION OF THE DE FACTO SITUATION\" IN BRUSSELS AND WOULD NEITHER REPRESENT BELGIAN \"FORMAL RECOGNITION\" OF PLO NOR \"IMPLY GRANTING OF SPECIAL STATUS\". HE SAID THAT THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES, SINCE PLO WAS NEITHER A STATE NOR AN EMBASSY NOR AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION. AMB. PATERNOTTE ENDED WITH OBSERVATION THAT PLO \"SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED SINCE IT HAS PROVED TO BE THE MOST RESPONSIBLE OF THE PALESTINE ORGANIZATIONS; THINGS ARE GETTING DIRTIER BY THE MINUTE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR EUROPEANS TO HAVE A RESPECTABLE LINK.\" FIRESTONE CONFIDENTIAL NNN"
