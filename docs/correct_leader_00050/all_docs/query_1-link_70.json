        "text": "Paul Emile François Henri Vanden Boeynants (Dutch: [ˈpʌul vɑndə(m)ˈbœynɑnts], French: [pɔl vandən bujnants]; 22 May 1919 – 9 January 2001) was a Belgian politician. He served as the prime minister of Belgium for two brief periods (1966–68 and 1978–79).\n\nCareer\n\nVanden Boeynants (called \"VDB\" by journalists) was born in Forest / Vorst, a municipality now in the Brussels-Capital Region. Active as a businessman in the meat industry, he was a Representative for the PSC-CVP between 1949 and 1979. From 1961 to 1966 he led the Christian democrat PSC-CVP (which was in those days a single party). He led the CEPIC, its conservative fraction.\n\nVanden Boeynants served as minister for the middle class (1958-1961). In 1966, he became Prime Minister of Belgium; he stayed in this post for two years. From 1972-1979 he served as minister of defense. In 1978–1979 he led another Belgian government. Vanden Boeynants then served as chairman of the PSC (1979-1981). He left politics in 1995, and died of pneumonia after undergoing cardiovascular surgery in 2001.\n\nOne of his famous expressions, in a unique mixture of Dutch and French, was: Trop is te veel en te veel is trop. (\"too many is too much and too much is too many\").\n\nFraud\n\nConvicted in 1986 for fraud and tax evasion, Vanden Boeynants was given a suspended jail sentence of three years. This prevented him from pursuing mayoral aspirations in Brussels. He underwent a political rehabilitation during the early 1990s.\n\nKidnapping\n\nIn an incident that is still the subject of dispute, Vanden Boeynants was kidnapped on 14 January 1989 by members of the Haemers criminal gang. Three days later, the criminals published a note in the leading Brussels newspaper Le Soir, demanding 30 million Belgian francs in ransom. Vanden Boeynants was released unharmed a month later, on 13 February, when an undisclosed ransom was paid to the perpetrators. The gang members were caught and imprisoned. .....\n\nHonours\n\nBelgium: Minister of State, by Royal Decree.\n\nGrand Cordon in the Order of Leopold.\n\nKnight Grand Cross in the Order of Leopold II.\n\nKnight Grand Cross in the Order of Saints Michael and George.\n\nGrand Officer in the Legion of Honour.\n\nLiterature\n\nN.
