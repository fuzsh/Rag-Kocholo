        "text": "Business-Managed Government\n\nThe Trilateral Commission\n\nThe Trilateral Commission is a top level international think tank founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller (pictured), chair of Chase Manhattan Bank, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security advisor to President Carter. It has 390 elite members made up of former and future national leaders, including George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and corporation heads, bankers and politicians. It meets annually as well as holding regional meetings.\n\nThe Commission claims it drew together 'the highest-level unofficial group possible' so as 'to foster closer cooperation among these core democratic industrialized areas of the world with shared leadership responsibilities in the wider international system'. Originally members were from Japan, Europe and North America but it has since widened its membership to include Chinese, Indian, Mexican and Asian members.\n\nThe Trilateral Commission has been funded by David Rockefeller, the Charles F. Kettering Foundation, and the Ford Foundation. Although members hold high level positions in business and academia, or have held such positions in government, they attend meetings as private individuals and therefore are free from the constraints of having to represent their orgnaisations.\n\nHoly Sklar in her book on Trilateralism, says the purpose of Trilateralism is to protect the power of the international ruling class “whose locus of power is the global corporation”; to co-opt the Third World; and to reintegrate communist countries:\n\nThe Commission's purpose is to engineer an enduring partnership among the ruling classes of North America, Western Europe, and Japan—hence the term \"trilateral\"—in order to safe-guard the interests of Western capitalism in an explosive world.\n\nAgainst Democracy\n\nAccording to David Rockefeller: \"We [the transnational corporations] are now in the driver's seat of the global economic engine. We are setting government policies instead of watching from the sidelines.\"\n\nRockefeller wrote in Newsweek that business people favour lessening the role of government but that this means that “somebody has to take government’s place, and business seems to me to be a logical entity to do it.”\n\nIn a report entitled The Crisis of Democracy, the Commission argues that there is need for 'a greater degree of moderation in democracy' and that the 'effective operation of a democratic political system usually requires some measure of apathy and noninvolvement on the part of some individuals and groups':\n\nThe vulnerability of democratic government in the United States (thus) comes not primarily from external threats, though such threats are real, nor from internal subversion from the left or the right, although both possibilities could exist, but rather from the internal dynamics of democracy itself in a highly educated, mobilized, and participant society.\n\nThe Commission has promoted the deregulation of labour markets and reduction of welfare as part of its efforts to protect capitalism from the potential power of the working class.\n\nMembership\n\nNoam Chomsky noted in 1981 of the Carter Administration:\n\nAll of the top positions in the government — the office of President, Vice-President, Secretary of State, Defense and Treasury — are held by members of the Trilateral Commission, and the National Security Advisor was its director. Many lesser officials also came from this group. It is rare for such an easily identified private group to play such a prominent role in an American Administration.\n\nOther members of the Trilateral Commission have included:\n\nPaul Adams, Chief Executive, British American Tobacco\n\nUrban Ahlin, Member of the Swedish Parliament\n\nRichard L. Armitage, President, former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State\n\nAntonio Borges, former Managing Director and Vice Chairman, Goldman Sachs International\n\nJames E.

Bush, former president of the United States\n\nFrank Carlucci, President of Carlyle Group; former U.S. Secretary of Defense\n\nCarme Chacon Piqueras, Minister for Defence; former Minister of Housing; former First Vice-President of the Spanish Parliament, Madrid\n\nJoe Clark, former prime minister of Canada\n\nBill Clinton, former president of the U.S.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton, US Secretary of State\n\nLuc Coene, Minister of State; Deputy Governor, National Bank of Belgium, Brussels\n\nRichard B. Cheney, former Vice President of the United States\n\nFujio Cho, Chairman, Toyota Motor Corporation\n\nE. Gerald Corrigan, Managing Director, Goldman, Sachs; former President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n\nJamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase\n\nRobert Eckert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mattel\n\nGaston Eyskens, former prime minister of Belgium\n\nDianne Feinstein, Member (D-CA), U.S. Senate\n\nStanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel; former President, Citigroup International; former First Deputy Managing Director, International Monetary Fund\n\nHugh Fletcher, CEO of Fletcher Challenge.\n\nFrancis Fukuyama, Professor International Political Economy\n\nLord Garel-Jones, Managing Director, UBS Investment Bank; Member of the House of Lords; former Minister of State at the Foreign Office (European Affairs)\n\nLord Gilbert, Member of the House of Lords; former Minister for Defence, London\n\nDonald E.

Haass, President, Council on Foreign Relations; former Director, Policy Planning, U. S. Department of State; former Director of Foreign Policy Studies, The Brookings Institution\n\nEdward Heath, former British Prime Minister\n\nToomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the Republic of Estonia, Tallinn\n\nHenry A. Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State\n\nHorst KÃ¶hler, former president of Germany\n\nEnrico Letta, Under State Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister, Italy; former Minister of European Affairs, Industry, and of Industry and International Trade, Rome\n\nPeter Mandelson, Member of the European Commission (Trade), Brussels; former Member of the British Parliament; former Secretary of State to Northern Ireland and for Trade and Industry\n\nMike Moore, former Director-General, World Trade Organization, Geneva; former Prime Minister of New Zealand\n\nBrian Mulroney, former Canadian Prime Minister\n\nIndra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo\n\nLucas Papademos, Vice President, European Central Bank, Frankfurt-am-Main; former Governor of the Bank of Greece\n\nLee Raymond, former CEO and Chairman, ExxonMobil\n\nPedro Solbes, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economy and Finances, Spain\n\nMartin Sorrell, Chief Executive Officer, WPP Group\n\nPeter Sutherland, Chairman, BP; Chairman, Goldman Sachs International; Chairman of the London School of Economics; former Director General, GATT/WTO; former Attorney General of Ireland\n\nPaul Wolfowitz, former President of the World Bank; former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense\n\nRobert B. Zoellick, President, World Bank; former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, former U.S. Trade Representative\n\nMortimer B. Zuckerman, Chairman and Editor-in-Chief, U.S. News & World Report\n\nBarak Obama appointed 11 Trilateral Commission members (out of a total 87 US members) to high level positions in his administration in its early days.\n\nMembers of the Trilateral Commission may not hold current government positions and must give up their membership if appointed to office.\n\nSustainable Development\n\nThe Trilateral Commission had at least four members in common with the Brundtland Commission on sustainable development, including Maurice Strong, Earth Summit organiser, and Jim MacNeill, the principal author of Our Common Future, the Brundtland Commissionâs report on sustainable development. Many transnational corporations that are members of the Business Council for Sustainable Development are also represented on the Trilateral Commission, including Dow, Du Pont, Royal Dutch Shell, Browning-Ferris Industries, Mitsubishi, Nippon Steel, Nissan Motor, and 3M.\n\nThe interest of the Trilateral Commission in sustainable development and the Earth Summit becomes more apparent in a book published by the Trilateral Commission and written by Jim MacNeill of the Brundtland Commission. In it MacNeill explains how most urban/industrial regions depend on environmental resources in other places, such as developing countries.\n\nIn essence, the ecological shadow of a country is the environmental resources it draws from other countries and the global commons. If a nation without much geographical resilience had to do without its shadow ecology, even for a short period, its people and economy would suffocate... Western nations heavily engaged in global sourcing should be aware of their shadow ecologies and the need to pursue policies that will sustain them.\n\nLinks"
