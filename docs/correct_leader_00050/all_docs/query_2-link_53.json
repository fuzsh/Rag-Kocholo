        "text": "The biggest problem that would become apparent is that the division about the 'King's Question' was not Flemish-Walloon, but cities-country side. If the Walloons would proclaim independence, they would probably have troubles settling their power outside the industrial zone between Li√®ge and Namur. While the Belgian government would hold on onto the south of Wallonia. Despite having industry, the Walloon revolt would face troubles acquiring food. They would also be isolated, while the Belgian government would ask Britain for help. Unless if the army officers hesitate, or are scared to clean up the streets, the Walloon rebellion cannot win.\n\nto put in numbers:\n\n70% of Flemish and only 40% of Walloons were for return of Leopold III\n\n53% off all Belgium were for continue of monarchy\n\nthe question on Civil-war is how fast will react the European Nations ?\n\nwill they discus until the petering out, like Yugoslavia in 1990s or will UN send peace keeper force into Belgium immediate ?\n\nduring this time there will happen allot of atrociously between Flemish and Walloons\n\nin aftermath will be Belgium divided along there language borders. possible between Netherlands for Flemish and Walloon become department of France or Luxembourg\n\nwhile Brussels become a City state.\n\nto put in numbers:\n\n70% of Flemish and only 40% of Walloons were for return of Leopold III\n\n53% off all Belgium were for continue of monarchy\n\nthe question on Civil-war is how fast will react the European Nations ?\n\nwill they discus until the petering out, like Yugoslavia in 1990s or will UN send peace keeper force into Belgium immediate ?\n\nduring this time there will happen allot of atrociously between Flemish and Walloons\n\nin aftermath will be Belgium divided along there language borders. possible between Netherlands for Flemish and Walloon become department of France or Luxembourg\n\nwhile Brussels become a City state.\n\nI'm very familiar with the real figures. They say little about the division I mentioned. I'm not denying that there is a difference between the two language groups. I'm only stating the figures give a wrong impression. Majorities in Flanders skyrocketed in primarily rural area's, but remained low near urban centers. And in Wallonia the rural area's in the Ardennes and Namur voted for the return of the king. Even in the cities of Wallonia majorities were small: the margin wasn't 10%, but two or three. The Wallonian rebellion would have troubles at home because of the substantial royalist minorities and the Flemish would have smaller anti-royalist groups to deal with.\n\nBelgium would not be divided along linguistic lines. After the rebellion would break out, Leopold III would contemplate abdication, for the same reason as in reality. The industrial and urban zones would become the battleground for anti and pro-royalist groups, probably eventually supported by Belgian army units. Then clashes between police forces and anti-royalists in Flemish cities and rural Wallonia. Neither king, nor government will want to lose Wallonia, they'll call the British for help if necessary, Belgium was in their zone of influence. Either way, the Belgian government would use all it's diplomatic means to force the allies into action. Perhaps by claiming that the insurgents were communists and that the red menace had to be stopped before it spread.\n\nAs for atrocities, they'll probably happen, but not focus on the division of Flemish and Walloon, but on pro and con the revolution. So there will be many Walloons killing Walloons as well as Flemish being harrassed by Walloon insurgents.\n\nIF Belgium were to fall apart the division would be difficult, because almost every industry in Belgium was owned by business men in Brussels who would resist being cut off and choose to give their support to the one most likely to win, or the one who'll preserve the industries best. Which might be the government. Which would mean the revolutionaries will have to plunder to get weapons, ideal material for the Belgian propaganda machine that'll.\n\nI don't see why Walloons would give up independence to become a Departement of France if they won (they would have Brussels too, or at least the money and industry owners). They had a strong industrial basis to build on. They had the money and the power to be independent. Of course they needed a port, which they might find in France. The idea was not new, but they would perhaps rather do their own bidding and enter in a customs union. Why Brussels would become a city state in your scenario is a mystery. It wasn't as important as it is now, so it would just become part of either Wallonia or Flanders.\n\nFlanders would only rejoin the Netherlands if they had no other choice: the compete collapse of Belgian rule and the monarchy during the war. But if that happened, why split? Wallonia could just claim the whole and continue with Belgium. Maybe as a republic."
