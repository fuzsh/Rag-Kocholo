        "text": "By HARRY GILROY\n\nSpecial to The New York Times\n\neopoldville, Belgian Congo, Friday, June 24--Patrice Lumumba received the approval of the Congolese House of Representatives early today for the new nation's first Government, after a last-minute compromise with Joseph Kasavubu.\n\nBy the compromise, members of M. Kasavubu's party will be in the Cabinet that M. Lumumba will head as Premier and Defense Minister when the Belgian Congo becomes independent June 30.\n\nM. Lumumba won an end to the general strike in Leopoldville that had been called at midday yesterday by the Kasavubu party. This party, the Abako, or Association of the Lower Congo, has its major strength in this area. M. Lumumba has a national majority over the rival Kasavubu forces.\n\nThe strike situation was so threatening in the early evening that the Security Command deployed troops in the native quarter and along lines bordering the European part of the city.\n\nEven while the troops were taking their posts, M. Lumumba got in touch with M. Kasavubu and they held a hurried meeting.\n\nList Referred to Brussels\n\nM. Lumumba showed one result of the meeting when, in introducing the list of his proposed Government team before the House of Representatives, he dropped a member of his own party from the post of Minister of Finance and named, instead, a Kasavubu supporter, Pascal Nkayi, M. Lumumba then added the names of Kasavubu supporters for Minister of State and Secretary of State.\n\nThe vote was taken about 2 A.M. The new Lumumba coalition Cabinet received seventy-four votes of the 137 members in the House.\n\nThe Cabinet list was radioed to Brussels where it is to be signed by King Baudouin, Premier Gaston Eyskens and August de Schryver, the Minister to the Congo.\n\nM. Kasavubu received the task of forming a Government last week but M. Lumumba replaced M. Kasavubu Tuesday night after M. Lumumba won the first test of voting strength in the House of Representatives.\n\nNominee for Chief of State\n\nM. Lumumba has proposed that Parliament elect Jean Bolikango, who has been close to M. Kasavubu, as Chief of State.\n\nIn forming his Cabinet, M. Lumumba put together a combination of parties considerably larger than his original following. There were twenty-one Cabinet Ministers, three Ministers of State and eight Secretaries of State on his list. The office of Secretary of State is similar to the office of Under Secretary in the United States.\n\nM. Lumumba took control of nine ministries for his party. His stanchest allies were the African Solidarity party, which received three ministries, and the African Regroupment Center, which received two. Antoin Gizenga, president of the African Solidarity party, was named Vice Premier.\n\nJustin Bomboko, a graduate of the Free University of Brussels and the only member of Parliament with an academic degree, was appointed Foreign Minister. Thomas Kanza, younger brother of M. Kasavubu's former right-hand man, Daniel Kanza, was named delegate to the United Nations."
