It is associated with specific changes in global demand for certain commodities and merchandise. International trade, which is the chief means for the effective delivery of commodities and merchandise, undergoes well-pronounced alternations in its geographical and product structure. The established supply chains undergo respective diversions in the aspect of length and chief participants. Green transition contributes to the effective integration in the global economy of some developing countries â chief suppliers of crucial resources. As some of them are one of the least developed countries it could be stated that green transition turns into an instrument for achieving also one of the UN goals for sustainable development, namely â reduced inequalities, economic growth, zero hunger and no poverty.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Alves Dias P., Blagoeva D., Pavel C., Arvanitidis N., (2018) Cobalt: demand-supply balances in the transition to electric mobility, EUR 29381 EN, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg\n\n[2] Ananthakrishnan, P ., Stuermer, M., Seneviratne, D., Valckx, N., (2021) Metals Demand From Energy Transition May Top Current Global Supply\n\n[3] CARI, (2023), Chinese Investments in Africa 2003-2022.
