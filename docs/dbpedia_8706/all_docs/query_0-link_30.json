        "text": "Mark 1:1–8. The Beginning of the Good News\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe Gospel of Mark opens with the words “The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God” (Mark 1:1). These words echo the first line of the Old Testament, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Genesis 1:1). The good news is that Jesus is renewing the entire world—“the heavens and the earth”—according to God’s “very good” original intent (Genesis 1:31). (See the TOW Bible Commentary on Genesis 1:1–2:3.) Jesus has not come to evacuate people from the world before it’s too late. Just the opposite; Jesus has come to fill the world with God’s presence (Revelation 21:3), overcoming every impulse to keep God out. Wherever Jesus goes, God is fully present.\n\nGod’s full presence in the world in the person of the man Jesus is news, astonishing news. Yet the prophets had proclaimed it as God’s promise for centuries. When it finally happens, what should people do? Get to work, says the prophet Isaiah. “Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight” (Isaiah 40:3 as paraphrased by Mark). Preparing for Jesus’s coming takes work. The way to greet Jesus is not to wait around passively, but to actively take stock and recognize where you have fallen short of God’s good intent.\n\nJohn the Baptist calls people to repent of the things we do—and the things that we fail to do—that betray the goodness of God’s creation. As Mark tells the story, when John calls people to repent, they are already well aware of their sin. (Luke records a bit more detail; see Luke 3:10–19.) They come from everywhere to repent and be cleansed (Mark 1:5). The same is true today, in work as in every sphere of life. When it comes to your own sin at work, just a few minutes of self-reflection may bring plenty to light. Some may be individual sins of doing something wrong, such as lying or shifting the blame for your actions onto someone else or profiting from others’ misfortunes. Other sins may come from what you don’t do at work, such as not producing quality work, or not helping a coworker in need, or not giving a customer complete and accurate information. Repentance means turning away from sins of doing wrong and sins of not doing right. But repentance is more than changing what you do. It also requires changing your perspective and motivation. For example, if you are only working to earn a paycheck, repentance means also caring about how your work affects other people. If you are only seeking to advance your own career, repentance means investing in the success of the people you work among.\n\nThe good news of Jesus, enacted by John, is that God is ready to wash away our guilt and give us the power to walk in the good work he has ordained for us from the very beginning (Ephesians 2:10). We don’t have power on our own to do truly good work, or even to desire it. But God stands ready to give us both the desire and the power (Mark 1:7–8) to do the work he wants us to do in the world.\n\nMark 1:4–11. John Baptizes Jesus of Nazareth\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nJesus himself comes to John to be baptized, as if to declare that he is the one John has been proclaiming. As Jesus emerges from the water, God’s Spirit descends upon him like a dove, and a voice from heaven confirms Jesus’s identity. “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased” (Mark 1:10–11). Although Jesus is the Son of God, that doesn’t negate Jesus’ human ethnicity, language, culture, and family. He is from Nazareth of Galilee (Mark 1:9). Galilee was a remote region, and Nazareth had a bad reputation among the elites in the capital, Jerusalem (John 1:46). Jesus, like his ancestor Ruth (Ruth 2:6), is treated as a suspicious outsider.\n\nOrigins influence the way people present themselves and are perceived as they go about their work. Sometimes an identity may be an advantage. At other times, it creates barriers. Immigrant workers, for example, often face stereotypes about their homeland or ethnicity. They typically lose whatever status and reputation they had in their community of origin. Highly skilled workers may be shunted into unskilled jobs. Financial and emotional support networks may be torn apart.\n\nJesus’ identity as uniquely beloved of God is deeper and more fundamental than the circumstances of his origin. In God’s eyes, Jesus is not some suspicious character from Nazareth, but God’s beloved, born to bring God’s own Holy Spirit throughout the world (Mark 1:8). Jesus’ obedience to his calling, opens the way of the Lord to all creation (Mark 1:3), and his work on the cross fulfills and perfects all good work (Mark 16:9). If Jesus can embrace his particular human origin, each of us can embrace ours. No one has the right to treat us as inferior because of our identity. And none of us have the right to treat another person as inferior because of their identity. For most of us, this alone is cause to repent.\n\nEven so, our origin does not dictate or limit our identity. Through baptism—the visible sign of turning to Jesus’ way—we accept our identity as children of God above and beyond any identity the world confers. The identity that we have as children of God is the starting point by which we live out our lives, even in the workplace.\n\nMark 1:12-13. Temptation at Work\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nBefore Jesus can even begin his work of proclaiming the good news, God’s Spirit drives him into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. In many passages in Scripture, God calls people through a place of testing and refinement, for example, Moses (Exodus 3–5), Joseph (Genesis 37, 39), and Paul (Acts 9, 11). Recognizing that your work matters to God will make work more fulfilling, more meaningful, less frustrating, and probably more difficult too. If the aims of your workplace—or the habits of your heart—do not fully align with God’s path of restoring the world for the good of all people, you can expect tensions, temptations, and difficulties at work. For example, is there any workplace where all people are treated by everyone with the dignity they deserve as people made in the image of God? Once you start to follow Jesus at work, you can no longer feel complacent when anyone in your workplace is mistreated or belittled. All the more so if you are the one doing the mistreating.\n\nThis does not make Jesus an enemy of work. Jesus chose to go into the place of hardship and temptation, and he found that God was with in him the wilderness (Mark 1:13). Maybe God puts his people in difficult workplaces because you can do more good there. Maybe it is for your own growth and formation. As marketplace theologian R. Paul Stevens says, “Work can shape our identity, form our character, and influence our relationships.” Maybe by God’s grace you can help make your workplace more as God intends, or maybe it will take all God’s strength simply to endure it until God opens another door for you. Whatever the circumstances, God is with you where you work.\n\nMark 1:14–15. The Kingdom of God\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nIn Mark 1:15, Jesus speaks of the kingdom of God. “The kingdom of God has come near.” The kingdom of God coming near is, in fact, the good news that Jesus is proclaiming (Mark 1:14–15). The entire gospel is the story of the kingdom of God coming from heaven into every square inch of the universe. The good news is not a story of God abandoning the universe and retreating to heaven with a few special people.\n\nWhen Jesus speaks of the kingdom of God, he means all of God’s creation, but as it will be when God transforms it into what God originally meant it to be, rather than what it is now. For example, shortly after speaking about the kingdom of God, Jesus heals a man with an unclean spirit (Mark 1:21–28). The man is a creature of God and therefore a part of the kingdom of God. But being tormented by an unclean spirit is NOT part of the kingdom of God. When Jesus banishes the unclean spirit, the man is restored to what God originally intended him to be. Thus, the kingdom of God has become real, or “come near,” for this man at this time and place. The kingdom of God is in God’s created world, even though the power of God that makes the kingdom of God become real comes from beyond the created world.\n\nJesus’ picture of the kingdom of God follows from the Bible’s picture of the creation of the world. God created the world and called everything in it good (Genesis 1:1–31). But God did not keep all the fun for himself. God gave people the job of bringing his good creation into its full potential (Genesis 1:28–30, Genesis 2:15). But people rebelled against God and chose to learn how to cultivate evil alongside God’s good creation (Genesis 3:5). Ever since then the world and its people have existed in a state of good entangled with evil, life with death, productivity with poverty, love with contempt, freedom with bondage, justice with oppression. When Jesus says that the kingdom of God is near, he is talking about the restoration of people to God’s good graces and the transformation of the world into what God intended it to be from the beginning.\n\nThe kingdom of God transforms the world. It does not obliterate the world. Every bit of the world can become the kingdom of God by returning to proper relation with God. Wherever and whenever people turn to Christ and live and die according to his teaching and example, his death and resurrection, the kingdom of God is coming to reality then and there. The kingdom of God has come near, as Jesus put it. For example, the kingdom of God comes near in something as small as when a manager gives a junior staff member the opportunity to make a presentation instead of claiming it themself. Doing so emulates Jesus’ example of empowering his disciples to do the work he himself is doing (Mark 3:14–15, for example).\n\nThe kingdom is near in every moment like these, but it is not completely fulfilled until Christ returns and all creation is transformed entirely and permanently (Revelation 21:1–5). We live in between the time of Jesus bringing the kingdom near to those who experienced him in person and the time of him bringing the kingdom to fulfillment everywhere and for all time when he returns in person. Our work here and now can help bring the kingdom near, or more accurately, when we allow the kingdom to come near through us, we can help do God’s work in the world (John 12:14). But we must do our work in the midst of all the ills of the world and the ills within ourselves. So to live under God’s reign and to work under his kingdom has serious challenges. It may bring social disrepute, conflict, and suffering because it often challenges sinful structures such as corrupt governments, criminal overlords, or exploitative companies, and evil powers such as racism, terrorism, and demagoguery. If you confront structures and powers like these, you can expect them to fight back. And if you yourself benefit from those structures, you will have to give up the ill-gotten benefits yourself. To serve the gospel and to honor God will not necessarily bring what people commonly consider success in this life. But, by the power of God’s Spirit, Christians can serve their neighbors and help to overcome the world’s ills, as the healings of Jesus will later demonstrate (Mark 1:23–34, 40–45). Working for the kingdom of God may bring gain as well, of course, for the kingdom of God is justice and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit (Romans 14:17). Hopefully each of us finds gain from justice, peace, and joy in the presence of God!\n\nMark 1:16–20. Fishing for People\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nWhere's Your Name?\n\n“When you go to work, if your name is on the building, you’re rich. If your name is on your desk, you’re middle-class. If your name is on your shirt, you’re poor.” (Attributed to comedian Rich Hall.)\n\nSee also Jesus calling the disciples in Matthew 4:18–21 and Luke 5:1–11.\n\nThe first people Jesus calls to follow him are fishermen (Mark 1:16). As Jesus walks along the seashore, he calls these fishermen specifically to fish “for people” (Mark 1:17). As Suzanne Watts Henderson notes, “not just nets are left behind, but a named father, a boat and indeed an entire enterprise.” These fishermen were leaving what appears to be a successful family business. For these disciples to follow Jesus, they have to allow their identity, status, and worth to be determined in relation to Jesus rather than to their occupation and possessions.\n\nFishing was a major industry in Galilee, with a connected subindustry of fish salting. At a time of social turbulence in Galilee, these two related industries supported each other and remained stable. The willingness of the disciples to forsake such stability is remarkable.\n\nThere is another side to the story, however. Even when Jesus calls these disciples to fish for people (Mark 1:17), he affirms their occupation as an image of the new role to which he is calling them. And in fact, Jesus uses their fishing and boating skills continually: to help him get around (i.e., Mark 4:35–41, Matthew 8:23–27), as a platform for speaking to crowds (i.e., Luke 5:1–11), and as a means of feeding Jesus’ followers (also seen in Luke 5:1–11). The fact that they still had access to boats while they followed Jesus may imply they had not completely abandoned their businesses. Peter will even go fishing after the Resurrection (John 21:3).\n\nAlthough most Christians are not called to leave their jobs, and many are called to stay in them (Luke 3:7–14), they are called to ground their identity in Christ and his kingdom (see “Calling & Vocation (Overview)”). Whether Christians leave their jobs or not, our most important identity becomes “follower of Jesus.” Being open to Christ’s call to follow him as the supreme authority of our lives and work rather than some other political or economic authority is paramount.\n\nMark 1:21–28. Jesus Heals on the Sabbath\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nSee Mark 2:23–3:6 below for a further discussion of Sabbath. The topic of Sabbath is also discussed in depth in the article “Rest and Work .” Recognizing that there is no single Christian perspective about the Sabbath, the Theology of Work Project explores a somewhat different point of view in the section on “Sabbath and Work” in the article “Luke and Work.”\n\nJesus goes to the synagogue in Capernaum (which means “city of consolation”) on the Sabbath, the day of rest. This recalls the creation story from Genesis, with days of work followed by the seventh day when God rested (Genesis 2:1–3), as well as one of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8–11). The Sabbath consecrates a portion of time free from the demands of work.\n\nFor working people, the Sabbath allows time to focus on God in a different way than the working week allows and to enjoy God’s blessing in a distinctive way. Worship on the Sabbath flavors work on the other six days. Work is entwined with worship, and worship does not contradict work. True Sabbath observance is not only about the halting of work, but about finding rest in the Lord who calls out to the weary and heavy-laden to take his gentle yoke upon them (cf. Matthew 11:28–30).\n\nWisdom for Sabbath Rest\n\nTim Keller gives guidelines to help us “stop to enjoy God, to enjoy his creation, to enjoy the fruits of our labor,” reminding us: “The whole point of Sabbath is joy in what God has done.”\n\nTake some time for sheer inactivity\n\nTake some time for avocational activity: contemplative, recreational, and aesthetic\n\nConsider whether you are an introvert or extrovert in planning your rest\n\nDon’t necessarily count family time as Sabbath time\n\nHonor both micro and macro rhythms in seasons of rest.\n\n—from “Wisdom and Sabbath Rest” at Redeemer City to City\n\nFor working people, the Sabbath allows time to focus on God in a different way than the working week allows and to enjoy God’s blessing in a distinctive way. Worship on the Sabbath flavors work on the other six days. Work is entwined with worship, and worship does not contradict work. True Sabbath observance is not only about the halting of work, but about finding rest in the Lord who calls out to the weary and heavy-laden to take his gentle yoke upon them (cf. Matthew 11:28–30).\n\nWhile we should avoid legalism about the Sabbath, this does not mean letting go of the rhythm of work and rest. It may mean that we find a way to set aside time for rest each week despite all the demands on our time. It may mean that we discover how to rest in a particular way that refreshes us from and for our particular work, such as doing mental work for a job and physical activity for rest. Employers can assist Sabbath rest by enabling ways of working that reduce stress at work, such as scheduling time to work uninterrupted or providing tools that reduce strain and injury on the job.\n\nJesus observes the Sabbath, yet does not shun his work of teaching and healing if he encounters people in need on the Sabbath. No one else raised any objections to him teaching on the Sabbath, either.\n\nIn the midst of teaching, Jesus casts out an unclean spirit from someone in the congregation. Healing is also a kind of work, and likewise in this incident, no one objected to it. Instead, they marveled at the authority Jesus had over the demonic, oppressive powers of the world (Mark (1:27). By Jesus’ own example, the Sabbath is not kept by ignoring people’s needs one day a week, but by establishing a rhythm of rest and work throughout the week, centered on regular encounters with God.\n\nThe exact nature of unclean or demonic spirits is not explained in the Bible. Encounters similar to this still happen today, but what is their root cause? Disembodied evil personalities? Mental illness? Oppression? Social structures of destruction? A wide variety of perspectives exists among Christians, not to mention among others. But whatever unclean spirits are, we can expect to encounter them wherever we work. The unclean spirit in Mark 1:27 is the first entity to perceive who Jesus really is. Jesus’ teaching has the power to change lives, and when we bring Jesus’ power of good to work, we can expect those who benefit from evil to recognize the danger it poses to them and to respond aggressively. We need to be alert and to anticipate opposition and suffering. But we do not need to fear, for Jesus’ power is greater than every evil spirit.\n\nA Sunday Kind of Love\n\nOlga Samples Davis defines Sabbath as “not just a Sunday kind of love” but “an everyday, every minute consciousness of the presence of God.”\n\n–from “A Sunday Kind of Love” at The High Calling\n\nFrom the Field: Praying in the Call Center\n\nRon Johnson discusses how he prays continuously for callers while serving on a customer service line:\n\n“We were trained to do a certain kind of conversation with a customer. You don’t just sit and listen to the conversation, but you take control of the call, meaning that you ask probing questions that are pertinent to exactly what you need to know to help the customer, and then you help the customer, and then you get them off the phone as quickly as you can so you can take the next call. I started experiencing a three-way . . . conversation, where they’re saying something to me and I’m thinking to myself, ‘Lord, what are they talking about?’ And then they’re saying more, and then I’m thinking, ‘Okay, Lord, are they saying such and such?’ So I’m constantly referring back to God to help me just to understand what the question is, and then I’ll say, ‘I’ll be glad to help you with that. Let me put you on hold for just two to three minutes while I look that up.’ And then I put them on hold and I say, ‘Okay, Lord, what are we gonna do here?’”\n\n—from Making it Work podcast episode “Customer Service and the Imitation of Christ”\n\nAn unclean spirit we encounter at work may be in the form of individuals in bondage to shame, greed, envy, despair, or acts of malice, abuse, self-harm, or spiritual forces beyond their ability to handle. It may be the possession of one person by another through slavery, bonded debt, fear, or extreme poverty. It may be adherence to demagogues or to ideologies of hate, exclusion, exploitation, or genocide. It may be illness and lack of care. It may be self-enslavement to sin or many other forms of bondage. By the grace of Christ, we may be able to discern and drive away some of the unclean spirits where we work. We may be able to challenge damaging work cultures and ideologies that deface God’s image in the people we work among. We may be able to offer physical, mental, or spiritual healing to those around us who need help. Our work may bring justice and relief to people in need. We may be able to tell the saving grace of Jesus and invite others to be set free by faith in him. To follow Jesus’ example, we need to accept the opportunity to serve people where we work, as Jesus did in this episode in the synagogue, when it would be easier to ignore people suffering around us and hope they would just go away. And we need to serve them in humility and compassion.\n\nIt may be no mere coincidence that Jesus encounters an unclean spirit while teaching. Teaching the truth can be a kind of spiritual warfare, for truth has many opponents. According to Mark, the authority of Jesus’ teaching is what causes the unclean spirit to come out. “What is this? A new teaching—with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him” (Mark 1:27). None of us are the Son of God, so we need to remain humble about our knowledge and opinions. Yet teaching the truth, to the degree God gives us to understand it, can still be life-giving to people caught in webs of lies, manipulation, or self-deception.\n\nMark 1:29–39. Rhythms of Work and Rest\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nA Thousand Points of Very Painful Light\n\nJennifer Woodruff Tait describes functioning in the modern workplace as an autistic person. “I’ve often described it to people as though I’m reaching down into myself to get the words to talk to you with. I am, most of the time, fairly verbal (I edit a magazine, for goodness sake), but I’m starting to realize that I go semiverbal a lot more than I realized. Just let the room be too hot or too cold, or there be a TV in the background, or too much of my energy going into looking at your face instead of the ceiling (WHO INVENTED EYE CONTACT???), and I lose words. Sometimes all of them.\n\nSometimes you ask me to repeat something, and I have to send that backhoe down into my psyche AGAIN and bring up the words AGAIN, and I just want to go crazy and collapse. I often wonder if those of us autistics who are completely nonverbal just can’t get the backhoe to go down far enough. There’s a reason autistic people are known for repeating things, memorizing things, and responding to situations with stock phrases (and, I would add, why so many of us love formal liturgy). Do you know what a relief it is when somebody’s already done the excavation with the backhoe? And the other thing is: nothing helps. Well, there are things that help me suppress the pseudolinguistic geometry, or temporarily redirect it, so I don’t interfere with the flow of neurotypical conversation. But doing those things comes at tremendous cost.”\n\n—from “A Thousand Points of Very Painful Light” by Jennifer Woodruff Tait at Patheos.com\n\nAfter healing a person in the synagogue, Jesus goes directly to Simon and Andrew’s home and heals Simon’s mother-in-law. Her immediate response is to work, providing hospitality in an act of service. Service is always an appropriate response to an encounter with the love of Jesus.\n\nJesus’ healing in this episode occurs through personal touch. “He took her hand” (Mark 1:31). Physical touch conveys powerful connection. The touch of a human being may be a power for good or for evil. The touch of Jesus is always a power for good. In the midst of a very busy schedule, Jesus takes the time to reach out to one person who needs him. At work, there may be people we could serve if only we took the time to connect with them in some manner. Instead of striving for time only with the powerful, the well connected, the strong, and those able to advance your agenda, what if you found time to connect with the overlooked, the low in status, the needy, and the unheralded? Physical touch may not be necessary, or appropriate, in every situation, but the attention of one person to another—when it is employed for good, rather than domination—is an act in the imitation of Christ.\n\nWhen the sun falls, the Sabbath is over, and crowds come to Jesus for healing. He heals them but tries to it keep it quiet (Mark 1:34). Fame is not his purpose, but compassion, and he casts out spirits, cures the sick, and makes the unclean clean.\n\nFrom the Field: Work and Home Boundaries\n\nThe Internet enables people to play games at work. At the same time, it enables people to work at home. Have you thought about policy related to this boundary blurring between home and work?\n\nHere at Cisco we are all very busy, and when people are so busy they tend to police themselves. If somebody comes in and takes advantage of the company, they are likely to end up turning themselves in and saying, “I can’t do this anymore.” On the other side, I do worry that some people will become workaholics. When I hire people, I tell them that there will be spurts when you’re going to have to give me seven days a week for a couple of weeks—but if that becomes your pattern, something is wrong. I’ve either given you the wrong responsibility or you are inept at managing your time. There is absolutely no way I expect you to do that all the time.\n\nI believe very strongly that if you’re doing the right things in your home and you’re balanced, you’re going to be productive here. I have yet to see a human being that can put in ninety productive hours in a week. At the end of a long day, it may take you forty minutes to write one more letter to a client before you go home—but the next morning it takes two minutes. God didn’t intend us to work these hours, and I’m not going to be party to somebody becoming a workaholic; when somebody tells me that, I don’t reward it. - From an interview with Gary Daichendt, formerly of Cisco Systems in San Jose, California, USA.\n\nFrom the Field: Prayer and Work\n\nAnomi Bruynius is a business owner and asset manager and has a unique way of incorporating prayer and consulting God in her work. She often works in male-dominated environments and has learned to see God as her silent partner. “So when I am faced with difficult negotiations, I say that I need to consult with my silent partner, and that I will get back to them with my decision. I can see from their faces that they are all thinking, ‘Knew it, she’s not the boss. There is a man in charge.’ And yes, there is a man in charge, God is in charge, he is my silent partner.”\n\nSee an extended testimony from Anomi at a conference at Malyon College, Queensland, Australia.\n\nMatthew Johnson is finance director of an education software business serving over 3,000 schools across Australia and Southeast Asia. His job has a large responsibility for leading the financial direction of the business, and he has very busy days. Challenged to consider spiritual practices in his working, Matthew started setting an alarm on his phone at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., the busiest moments of his day, to remind himself to pray. He describes what has happened since he started that practice: “The practice has enabled me to better observe God in action. Amongst the chaos of a normal day, I am normally distracted by the busyness. The 2 mins to breathe, look around, reflect on my meetings that day helps me to re-centre on that narrative that God is constantly at work, and I get the opportunity to get a glimpse of Him and even co-create with Him. As a result I feel like I better experience His grace and presence.” - As told to Kara Martin, TOW Board member\n\nThe next day, Jesus rises to pray while it is still very dark (Mark 1:35). As well as the weekly Sabbath rhythm of work and rest that we saw in Mark 1:21–28, Jesus establishes a daily rhythm. After a long period of work or before a major decision, Jesus withdraws to a solitary place, for stillness with God and to pray. His prayer is not a public performance, but a matter of personal communion with the Father. In this case, after Jesus spends time in prayer, he recognizes it is time to go to another village, even though he is in great demand where he is (Mark 1:37–38). The routine work may sometimes obscure the need to make a change. Your ability to please those you know may keep you from finding where you can make the most difference. Prayer can give you the time, space, and guidance to recognize your true path.\n\nDaily prayer seems to be a very difficult practice for many Christians, perhaps nearly everyone. Between home responsibilities, long commutes, early working hours, a desire to get ahead of the day’s responsibilities, and late nights spent on unfinished work (or entertainment), it seems almost impossible to establish a consistent routine of prayer.\n\nJesus does not speak judgment against people who do not or cannot pray daily about the work that lies ahead of them. But he himself—though busier than anyone around him—does pray constantly about the work and the people God sets before him.\n\nRegular time set apart is good, but it is not the only way to pray. Prayer can be simply a conversation with God—ideally an ongoing dialogue throughout the day. If you have any moments free for your own thoughts while at work, you have opportunities for prayer. Prayer involves listening as much as talking. Taking a moment to be still and silent before the Lord during the workday is as much prayer as is stating petitions, praise, and thanks.\n\nOne practice many have found helpful is to pray briefly at multiple times during the day. “Daily Devotions for Individuals and Families,” found in the Book of Common Prayer, pages 136–43 (available online here), provides brief structures for prayer in the morning, at noon, in the evening, and at night. The TOW Project also offers an online devotional, “How to Pray for Your Work.” Even briefer examples include\n\na one- or two-sentence prayer when moving from one task to another;\n\npraying with eyes open;\n\noffering thanks silently or out loud before meals; and\n\nkeeping an object or verse of Scripture in a pocket as a reminder to pray.\n\nAmong many books that can help establish a daily prayer rhythm are Finding God in the Fast Lane by Joyce Huggett, The Spirit of the Disciplines by Dallas Willard, and Working in the Presence of God: Spiritual Practices for Everyday Work by Denise Daniels and Shannon Vandewarker.\n\nMark 1:40–45. Jesus Heals a Leper\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nAfter finishing a time of prayer, Jesus heals a person suffering from leprosy. It is not clear in modern terms exactly what specific disease or diseases are meant by the biblical term “leprosy.” An easily visible skin condition was the chief hallmark. Whatever the cause, leprosy was a disease of exclusion. According to the purity laws in Leviticus chapters 13 and 14, anyone with leprosy “shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp”; and he must cry out “unclean, unclean” to warn others away (Leviticus 13:45–46). Anyone touching a leper would become unclean themselves (Leviticus 5:3), so lepers were to be avoided at all costs.\n\nBut Jesus is filled with compassion for this leper, and instead of being defiled, Jesus’s touch brings complete cleansing from both the physical illness and the social isolation. Jesus’s power to cleanse and heal overcomes the physical, emotional, and social disabilities that exclude people from full participation in the community.\n\nIn ancient Israel, lepers were excluded from their communities due to a skin condition. Today people may be excluded from full participation in work because of medical conditions, disability, color, caste, prejudice, or fear, or because of differences in language, dress, culture, education, and other status markers. In the wider society, many people are disrespected because of their occupation, job status, social class, national origin, and other factors.\n\nFollowing Jesus, Christians are called to dismantle these barriers. Would a woman wearing a head scarf be marginalized where you work? Would a man with dirt under his fingernails feel welcome where you worship? There are probably people feeling excluded or unwelcomed in your workplace, your community, your church. Like Jesus, you may have an opportunity to reach out to someone who otherwise would remain isolated or left out. Doing so may require risking your own comfort or social status, much as Jesus risked becoming ritually impure when reaching out to the leper in this passage.\n\nThe Paralytic Man (Mark 2:1-12)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nWork as Prayerful Relationships: Mark 5 (Click Here to Read)\n\nThis sermon from The High Calling discusses another healing miracle of Jesus in Mark (5:1-20) where Jesus brings healing to both a wayward individual and a fearful crowd. If we consider work as a form of prayer, then how we regard one another in the workplace makes a difference. Business is about relationships; how we manage those relationships can make the difference for our success both as business people and Christians.\n\nThe story of Jesus healing the paralytic man raises the question of what the theology of work means for those who do not have the ability to work. The paralytic man, prior to this healing, is incapable of self-supporting work. As such, he is dependent on the grace and compassion of those around him for his daily survival. Jesus is impressed by the faith of the man’s friends. Their faith is active, showing care, compassion, and friendship to someone who was excluded from both the financial and relational rewards of work. In their faith, there is no separation between being and doing.\n\nJesus sees their effort as an act of collective faith. “When Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, ‘Son, your sins are forgiven’” (Mark 2:5). Regrettably, the community of faith plays a vanishingly small role in most Christians’ work lives in the modern West. Even if we receive help and encouragement for the workplace from our church, it is almost certain to be individual help and encouragement. In earlier times, most Christians worked alongside the same people they went to church with, so churches could easily apply the Scriptures to the shared occupations of labourers, farmers, and householders. In contrast, Western Christians today seldom work in the same locations as others in the same church. Nonetheless, today's Christians often work in the same types of jobs as others in their faith communities. So there could be an opportunity to share their work challenges and opportunities with other believers in similar occupations. Yet this seldom happens. Unless we find a way for groups of Christian workers to support one another, grow together, and develop some kind of work-related Christian community, we miss out on the communal nature of faith that is so essential in Mark 2:3-12.\n\nIn this brief episode, then, we observe three things: (1) work is intended to benefit those who can’t support themselves through work, as well as those who can; (2) faith and work are not separated as being and doing, but are integrated into action empowered by God; and 3) work done in faith cries out for a community of faith to support it.\n\nThe Calling of Levi (Mark 2:13-17)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe calling of Levi is another incident that occurs as Jesus is moving (Mark 2:13-14). The passage stresses the public nature of this summons. Jesus calls Levi while teaching a crowd (Mark 2:14), and Levi is initially seen “sitting at the tax booth.” His employment would make him a figure of contempt for many of his Galilean contemporaries. There is a measure of debate over just how heavily Roman and Herodian taxation was felt in Galilee, but most think that the issue was rather sore. The actual collection of taxes was contracted out to private tax collectors. A tax collector paid the tax for his entire territory upfront, and collected the individual taxes from the populace later. To make this profitable, he had to charge the populace more than the actual tax rate and the tax collector pocketed the mark-up. The Roman authorities thereby delegated the politically sensitive work of tax collection to members of the local community, but it led to a high rate of effective tax, and it opened the doors to all sorts of corruption. It is likely that this was one of the factors contributing to land loss in Galilee, as landowners took loans to pay monetary taxes and then, if their harvests were poor, lost their properties as collateral. The fact that we initially encounter Levi in his tax booth means that he is, in effect, a living symbol of Roman occupation and a reminder of the fact that some Jews were willing collaborators with the Romans. The link made in Mark 2:16 between tax collectors and “sinners” reinforces the negative associations.\n\nWhere Luke stresses that Levi leaves everything to answer Jesus’ call (Luke 5:28), Mark simply recounts that Levi follows him. The tax collector then throws a banquet, opening his house to Jesus, his disciples, and a mixed group including other tax collectors and “sinners.” While the image is suggestive of a man seeking to share the gospel with his business colleagues, the reality is probably a little more subtle. Levi’s “community” comprises his colleagues and others who, as “sinners,” are shunned by leading figures in the community. In other words, their work made them part of a sub-community that had high-quality social relationships internally, but low-quality relationships with the communities around them. This is true for many kinds of work today. Our co-workers may be much more open to us than our neighbours are. Being a member of a work community may help us facilitate an encounter with the reality of the gospel for our co-workers. Interestingly, the hospitality of communal eating is a major part of Jesus’ ministry and suggests a concrete way by which such encounters might be hosted. The hospitality of lunch with colleagues, a jog or workout at the gym, or a shared beverage after work can build deeper relationships with our co-workers. These friendships have lasting value themselves, and through them the Holy Spirit may open the door to a kind of friendship evangelism.\n\nThis raises a question. If Christians today were to host a meal with colleagues from work, friends from their neighbourhood, and friends from their church, what would they talk about? The Christian faith has much to say about how to be a good worker and how to be a good neighbour. But do Christians know how to speak about them in a common language understandable to their colleagues and neighbours? If the conversation turned to workplace or civic topics such as a job search, customer service, property taxes or zoning, would we be able to speak meaningfully to nonbelievers about how Christian concepts apply to such issues? Do our churches equip us for these conversations? It appears that Levi — or Jesus — was able to speak meaningfully about how Jesus’ message applied to the lives of the people gathered there.\n\nThe question of taxation will recur later in the gospel and we defer until then some of our questions about Jesus’ attitude towards it.\n\nThe Twelve Disciples (Mark 3:13-19)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nIn addition to the accounts of the calling of specific disciples, there is also the account of the appointing of the apostles. There is an important point to be noted in Mark 3:13-14, namely, that the Twelve constitute a special group within the broader community of disciples. The uniqueness of their apostolic office is important. They are called to a distinctive form of service, one that may depart significantly from the experience most of us will have. If we are to draw lessons from the experience and roles of the disciples, then it must be through recognition of how their actions and convictions relate to the kingdom, not merely the fact that they left their jobs to follow Jesus.\n\nThe qualifications listed for Simon, James, John, and Judas in Mark 3:16-19 are relevant here. Simon’s name is, of course, supplemented with the new name given to him by Jesus, “Peter,” which closely resembles the Greek word for “rock” (petros). One cannot help but wonder if there is both a certain irony and a certain promise in the name. Simon, as fickle and unstable as he will prove to be, is named The Rock, and one day he will live up to that name. Like him, our service to God in our workplaces, just as elsewhere in our lives, will not be a matter of instantaneous perfection, but rather one of failure and growth. This is a helpful thought at times when we feel we have failed and brought the kingdom into disrepute in the process.\n\nJust as Simon is given a new name, so too are the sons of Zebedee, referred to as the “Sons of Thunder” (Mark 3:17). It is a quirky nickname, and seems humorous, but it also quite likely picks up on the character or personality of these two men. It is an interesting point that personality and personality types are not effaced by inclusion in the kingdom. This cuts both ways. On one hand, our personalities continue to be part of our identity in the kingdom, and our embodiment of the kingdom in our place of work continues to be mediated through that personality. The temptation to find our identity in some stereotype, even a Christian one, is challenged by this. Yet, at the same time, our personalities may be marked by elements that themselves ought to be challenged by the gospel. There is a hint of this in the title given to Zebedee’s sons, since it suggests a short temper or a tendency toward conflict and, even though the name is given with fondness, it may not be a nickname to be proud of.\n\nThe issue of personality makes a significant contribution to our understanding of applying the Christian faith to our work. Most of us would probably say that our experiences of work, both good and bad, have been greatly affected by the personalities of those around us. Often the very character qualities that make someone an inspiring and energizing colleague can make that person a difficult one. A motivated and excited worker might be easily distracted by new projects, or might be prone to quickly formed (and quickly expressed) opinions. Our own personality plays a huge role too. We may find others easy to work with or difficult, based as much on our personalities as theirs. Likewise, others may find us easy or difficult to work with.\n\nBut it is more than a matter of getting along with others easily. Our distinctive personalities shape our abilities to contribute to our organization’s work — and through it to the work of God’s kingdom —for better or worse. Personality gives us both strengths and weaknesses. To a certain degree, following Christ means allowing him to curb the excesses of our personality, as when he rebuked the Sons of Thunder for their misguided ambition to sit at his right and left hands (Mark 10:35-45). At the same time, Christians often err by setting up particular personality traits as a universal model. Some Christian communities have privileged traits such as extraversion, mildness, reticence to use power, or — more darkly — abusiveness, intolerance, and gullibility. Some Christians find that the traits that make them good at their jobs — decisiveness, skepticism about dogma, or ambition, for example — make them feel guilty or marginalized in church. Trying to be something we are not, in the sense of trying to fit a stereotype of what a Christian in the workplace ought to be like, can be highly problematic and can leave others feeling that we are inauthentic. We may be called to imitate Christ (Philippians 2:5) and our leaders (Hebrews 13:7), but this is a matter of emulating virtue, not personality. Jesus, in any case, chose people with a variety of personalities as his friends and workers. Many tools are available to help individuals and organizations make better use of the variety of personality characteristics with respect to decision making, career choice, group performance, conflict resolution, leadership, relationships at work, and other factors.\n\nWhile on one level this needs to be related to a theology of wealth or property, on another level it needs to be related to the point at which the theologies of church and work meet. It is always tempting, and in fact can seem like an obligation, to maintain a network of Christians within the working environment and to seek to support one another. While laudable, there needs to be a certain reality injected into this. Some of those who present themselves as followers of Jesus may, in fact, have misplaced hearts, and this may affect the opinions they advocate. At such times, our responsibility as Christians is to be prepared to challenge one another in love, to hold one another to account as to whether we are truly operating according to the standards of the kingdom.\n\nDiscipleship in Process (Mark 4:35-41; 6:45-52; 8:14-21)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe Gospel of Mark, more than the other Gospels, highlights the ignorance, weakness, and selfishness of the disciples. This comes despite the many good things Mark has to say about them, including their response to Jesus’ initial call (Mark 1:16-20) and to his commissioning of them (Mark 6:7-13).\n\n​Certain incidents and narrative devices develop this portrait. One is the repetition of boat scenes (Mark 4:35-41; 6:45-52; 8:14-21), which parallel one another in emphasizing the disciples’ inability to truly comprehend Jesus’ power and authority. The last boat scene is closely followed by the unusual two-stage healing of a blind man (Mark 8:22-26), which may function as a kind of narrative metaphor for the only partial vision of the disciples regarding Jesus. Then follows Peter’s confession of Christ (Mark 8:27-33), with his dramatic moment of insight followed immediately by Satanic blindness on the apostle’s part. The disciples’ limited grasp of Jesus’ identity is matched by their limited grasp of his message. They continue to desire power and status (Mark 9:33-37; 10:13-16; and 10:35-45). Jesus challenges them several times for their failure to recognize that following him requires a fundamental attitude of self-sacrifice. Most obviously, of course, the disciples desert Jesus at the time of his arrest and trial (Mark 14:50-51). The juxtaposition of Peter’s threefold denial (Mark 14:66-72) with the death of Jesus throws the cowardice and courage of the two men, respectively, into sharper relief.\n\nYet Peter and the others will go on to lead the church effectively. The angel who speaks to the women following the resurrection (Mark 16:6-7) gives them a message to the disciples (and Peter is singled out!), promising a further encounter with the resurrected Jesus. The disciples will be very different following this encounter, a fact that Mark does not explore but that is well developed in Acts, so that the resurrection is the key event in effecting such change.\n\nWhat relevance does this have to work? Simply and obviously, that as disciples of Jesus with our own work to do, we are imperfect and in process. There will be a good deal that we will be required to repent of, attitudes that will be wrong and will need to change. Significantly, we must recognize that, like the disciples, we may well be wrong in much of what we believe and think, even about gospel matters. On a daily level, then, we must prayerfully reflect on how we are embodying the reign of God and prepared to show repentance over our deficiencies in this regard. We may feel tempted to portray ourselves as righteous, wise, and skilled in our workplaces, as a witness to Jesus’ righteousness, wisdom, and excellence. But it would be a more honest and more powerful witness to portray ourselves as we really are—fallible and somewhat self-centred works-in-process, evidence of Jesus’ mercy more than demonstrators of his character. Our witness is then to invite our co-workers to grow along with us in the ways of God, rather than to become like us. Of course, we need to exercise ourselves rigorously to growth in Christ. God’s mercy is not an excuse to be complacent in our sin.\n\nThe Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:23-3:6)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\n​\n\nThe Purpose of the Sabbath (Click Here to Read)\n\nIn this daily reflection from The High Calling Mark Roberts considers how the teaching of Jesus about the purpose of the Sabbath speaks to us today: \"In a world so filled with busyness, where electronic communication invades every moment, where people are running ragged and neglecting their most important relationships, we need the gift of rest.\"\n\nWe have noticed already, in our discussion of Mark 1:21-34, that the Sabbath is integrated into the weekly rhythms of Jesus. The clash that takes place between Jesus and the Pharisees is not over whether to observe the Sabbath but over how to observe it. For the Pharisees, the Sabbath was primarily defined in negative terms. What, they would ask, is prohibited by the commandment to do no work (Exodus 20:8-11; Deuteronomy 5:12-15)? To them, even the casual action of the disciples in picking ears of grain constitutes a kind of work and thus ignores the prohibition. It is interesting that they describe this action as “not lawful” (Mark 2:24), even though such a specific application of the fourth commandment is lacking in the Torah. They regard their own interpretation of the law as authoritative and binding, and do not consider the possibility that they might be wrong. Even more objectionable for them is Jesus’ act of healing (Mark 3:1-6), which is depicted as the key event leading the Pharisees to plot against Jesus.\n\nMaking Time Off Predictable and Required (Click Here to Read)\n\nRead more here about a new study regarding rhythms of rest and work done at the Boston Consulting Group by two professors from Harvard Business School. It showed that when the assumption that everyone needs to be always available was collectively challenged, not only could individuals take time off, but their work actually benefited. (Harvard Business Review may show an ad and require registration in order to view the article.) Mark Roberts also discusses this topic in his Life for Leaders devotional \"Won't Keeping the Sabbath Make Me Less Productive?\"\n\nBy contrast with the Pharisees, Jesus regards the Sabbath positively. The day of freedom from work is a gift for humanity’s good. “The Sabbath was made for humankind, not humankind for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27). Moreover, the Sabbath affords opportunities to exercise compassion and love. Such a view of the Sabbath has good prophetic antecedent. Isaiah 58 links the Sabbath with compassion and social justice in the service of God, culminating with a description of God’s blessing on those who will “call the Sabbath a delight” (Isaiah 58:13-14). The juxtaposition of compassion, justice, and Sabbath suggests that the Sabbath is most fully used as a day of worship by the demonstration of compassion and justice. After all, the Sabbath itself is a remembrance of God’s justice and compassion in delivering Israel from slavery in Egypt (Deuteronomy 5:15).\n\nThe first Sabbath account (Mark 2:23-28) is triggered by the disciples’ action of picking ears of grain. While Matthew adds that the disciples were hungry, and Luke describes their action of rubbing the ears of grain between their hands before eating them, Mark simply describes them as picking the grain, which conveys the casual nature of the action. The disciples were probably absently picking at the seeds and nibbling them. The defence that Jesus offers when challenged by the Pharisees seems a little strange at first, because it is a story about the house of God, not the Sabbath.\n\nHave you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food? He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions. (Mark 2:25–26)\n\nScholars are divided over how — or even whether — Jesus’ argument works according to principles of Jewish exegesis and argumentation. The key is to recognize the concept of “holiness.” Both the Sabbath and the house of God (with its contents) are described as “holy” in Scripture. Sabbath is sacred time, the house of God is sacred space, but lessons that may be derived from the holiness of one may be transferred to the other.\n\nJesus’ point is that the holiness of the house of God does not preclude its participation in acts of compassion and justice. The sacred spaces of earth are not refuges of holiness against the world, but places of God’s presence for the world, for his sustenance and restoration of the world. A place set apart for God fundamentally is a place of justice and compassion. “The sabbath [and by implication, the house of God] was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath” (Mark 2:27). Matthew’s version of this account includes the detail, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice,” from Hosea 6:6 (Matthew 12:7). This makes explicit the point that we see with more reserve in Mark.\n\nThe Purpose of the Sabbath, Part 2 (Click Here to Read)\n\nIn this daily reflection from The High Calling Mark Roberts considers how the question and the action of Jesus make it clear that the Sabbath is a day for saving life, not just in the particular sense of rescuing someone from a life-threatening situation, but also in the larger sense of bringing people to wholeness. ​\n\nThe same point emerges in the second Sabbath controversy, when Jesus heals a man in a synagogue on the Sabbath (Mark 3:1-6). The key question that Jesus asks is, “Is it lawful to do good or to do harm on the Sabbath, to save life or to kill?” The silence of the Pharisees in the face of this question serves as a confirmation that the Sabbath is honoured by doing good, by saving life.\n\nHow does this apply to our work today? The Sabbath principle is that we must consecrate a portion of our time and keep it free from the demands of work, allowing it to take on a distinctive character of worship. This is not to say that the Sabbath is the only time of worship, nor that work cannot be a form of worship itself. But the Sabbath principle allows us time to focus on God in a different way than the working week allows, and to enjoy his blessing in a distinctive way. Crucially, too, it gives us space to allow our worship of God to manifest itself in social compassion, care, and love. Our worship on the Sabbath flavors our work during the week.\n\nThe topic of Sabbath is discussed in depth in the article, Rest and Work at www.theologyofwork.org. Recognizing that there is no single Christian perspective about the Sabbath, the Theology of Work Project explores a somewhat different point of view in the section on \"Sabbath and Work\" in the article Luke and Work.\n\nParables at Work (Mark 4:26-29 and 13:32-37)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nMark contains only two parables that are not also found in the other Gospels. Both of them concern work, and both are very short.\n\nThe first of these parables, in Mark 4:26-29, compares the kingdom of God to growing grain from seed. It has similarities to the more familiar parable of the mustard seed, which follows immediately afterwards, and to the parable of the sower (Mark 4:1-8). Although the parable is set in the workplace of agriculture, the role of the farmer is deliberately minimized. “He does not know how” the grain grows (Mark 4:27). Instead, the emphasis is on how the kingdom’s growth is brought about by the inexplicable power of God. Nonetheless, the farmer must “rise night and day” to cultivate the crop (Mark 4:26) and go in with his sickle (Mark 4:28) to reap the harvest. God’s miracle is given among those who do their assigned work.\n\nThe second uniquely Marcan parable, in Mark 13:32-37, illustrates the need for Jesus’ disciples to watch for the second coming of Jesus. Intriguingly, Jesus says, “It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch” (Mark 13:34). While he is away, each servant is charged to keep doing his work. The kingdom is not like a master who goes to a far country and promises to eventually call his servants to join him there. No, the master will be coming back, and he gives his servants the work of growing and maintaining his household for his eventual return.\n\nBoth parables take it as a given that Jesus’ disciples are diligent workers, whatever their occupation. We will not discuss the other parables here, but refer instead to the extensive explorations in Matthew and Work and Luke and Work at www.theologyofwork.org.\n\nJesus the Builder (Mark 6:1-6)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe Art of Making, the Carpenter (Click to Watch)\n\nThe Art of Making, The Carpenter from Deep Green Sea on Vimeo.\n\nAn incident in Jesus’ hometown gives a rare insight into his work prior to becoming a traveling preacher. The context is that Jesus’ hometown friends and acquaintances can’t believe that this familiar local boy has become a great teacher and prophet. In the course of their complaints, they say, “What deeds of power are being done by his hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” (Mark 6:2–3). This is the only passage in the Bible to directly state Jesus’ trade. (In Matthew 13:55, Jesus is called “the carpenter’s son,” and Luke and John do not mention his profession.) The underlying Greek (tekton) refers to a builder or craftsman in any kind of material, which in Palestine would generally be stone or brick. The English rendering “carpenter” may reflect the fact that in London wood was the more common building material at the time the first English translations were made.\n\nIn any case, a number of Jesus’ parables take place at construction sites. How much of Jesus’ personal experience might be reflected in these parables? Did he help construct a fence, dig a wine press, or build a tower in a vineyard, and observe the strained relations between the landowner and the tenants (Mark 12:1-12)? Did one of his customers run out of money halfway through building a tower and leave an unpaid debt to Jesus (Luke 14:28-30)? Did he remember Joseph teaching him how to dig a foundation all the way to solid rock, so that the building can withstand wind and flood (Matthew 7:24-27)? Did he ever hire assistants and have to face grumbling about pay (Matthew 20:1-16) and pecking order (Mark 9:33-37)? Was he ever supervised by a manager who asked him to join in a scheme to defraud the owner (Luke 16:1-16)? In short, how much of the wisdom in Jesus’ parables was developed through his experience as a tradesman in the first-century economy? If nothing else, remembering Jesus’ experience as a builder can help us see the parables in a more concrete light.\n\nWealth (Mark 10:17-22)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nJesus’ encounter with a rich man who asks “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” constitutes one of the few passages in Mark that speaks directly to economic activity. The man’s question leads Jesus to list (Mark 10:18) the six most socially oriented commandments in the Decalogue. Interestingly, “Do not covet” (Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21) is presented with a definite commercial twist as “Do not defraud.” The rich man says that he has “kept all of these since my youth” (Mark 10:20). But Jesus states that the one thing he lacks is treasure in heaven, obtained by sacrificing his earthly wealth and following the vagrant from Galilee. This presents an obstacle that the rich man cannot pass. It seems that he loves the comforts and security afforded by his possessions too much. Mark 10:22 emphasizes the affective dimension of the situation—“When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving.” The young man is emotionally disturbed by Jesus’ teaching, indicating an openness to its truth, but he is not able to follow through. His emotional attachment to his wealth and status overrules his willingness to heed the words of Jesus.\n\nApplying this to work today requires real sensitivity and honesty with regard to our own instincts and values. Wealth is sometimes a result of work—ours or someone else’s—but work itself can also be an emotional obstacle to following Jesus. If we have privileged positions—as the rich man did—managing our careers may become more important than serving others, doing good work, or even making time for family, civic, and spiritual life. It may hinder us from opening ourselves to an unexpected calling from God. Our wealth and privilege may make us arrogant or insensitive to the people around us. These difficulties are not unique to people of wealth and privilege, of course. Yes, Jesus’ encounter with the rich man highlights that it is hard to motivate yourself to change the world if you are already on top of the heap. Before those of us of modest means and status in the Western world let ourselves off the hook, let us ask whether, by world standards, we also have become complacent because of our (relative) wealth and status.\n\nBefore we leave this episode, one crucial aspect remains. “Jesus, looking at him, loved him” (Mark 10:21). Jesus’ purpose is not to shame or browbeat the young man, but to love him. He calls him to leave his possessions first of all for his own benefit, saying, “You will have treasure in heaven; then come follow me.” We are the ones who suffer when we let wealth or work cut us off from other people and remove us from relationship with God. The solution is not to try harder to be good, but to accept God’s love; that is, to follow Christ. If we do this, we learn that we can trust God for the things we really need in life, and we don’t need to hold on to our possessions and positions for security.\n\nThis parable is further discussed under \"Luke 18:18-30\" in Luke and Work at www.theologyofwork.org.\n\nStatus (Mark 10:13-16, 22)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nA distinctive aspect to Mark’s rendering of the story is its juxtaposition with the account of the little children being brought to Jesus, and the subsequent statement that the kingdom is to be received like such infants (Mark 10:13-16). What links the two passages is probably not the issue of security, or relying on financial resources rather than on God. Rather, the point of contact is the issue of status. In ancient Mediterranean society, children were without status, or at least were of a low status. They possessed none of the properties by which status was judged. Crucially, they owned nothing. The rich young man, by contrast, has an abundance of status symbols (Mark 10:22) and he owns much. (In Luke’s account, he is explicitly called a “ruler,” Luke 18:18.) The rich young man may miss entering the kingdom of God as much because of his slavery to status as because of his slavery to wealth per se.\n\nIn today’s workplaces, status and wealth may or may not go hand in hand. For those who grow in both wealth and status through their work, this is a double caution. Even if we manage to use wealth in a godly manner, it may prove much harder to escape the trap of slavery to status. Recently a group of billionaires received much publicity for pledging to give away at least half of their wealth. Their generosity is astounding, and in no way do we wish to criticize any of the pledgers. Yet we might wonder, with the value of giving so recognized, why not give away much more than half? Half a billion dollars still exceeds by far any amount needed for a very comfortable life. Is it possible that the status of remaining a billionaire (or at least a half-billionaire) is an impediment to devoting an entire fortune to the purposes that are so clearly important to a donor? Is it any different for workers of more modest means? Does regard for status keep us from devoting more of our time, talent, and treasure to the things we recognize as truly important?\n\nThe same question can be asked of people whose status does not correlate with wealth. Academics, politicians, pastors, artists, and many others may gain great status through their work without necessarily making a lot of money. Status may arise from working, say, at a particular university or remaining the toast of a certain circle. Can that status become a form of slavery that keeps us from jeopardizing our position by taking an unpopular stance or moving on to more fruitful work elsewhere?\n\nHow painful might it be to put our work-related status at risk — even a little bit — in order to serve another person, diminish an injustice, maintain your moral integrity, or see yourself in God’s eyes? Jesus had all this status and even more. Perhaps that’s why he worked so hard to set aside his status through daily prayer to his “father” and by putting himself constantly in disreputable company.\n\nThe Grace of God (Mark 10:23-31)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe subsequent words of Jesus (Mark 10:23-25) elaborate the significance of the encounter, as Jesus stresses the difficulty faced by the wealthy in entering the kingdom. The young man’s reaction illustrates the attachment the rich have to their wealth and to the status that goes with it; significantly, the disciples themselves are “perplexed” by Jesus’ statements about the wealthy. It is perhaps noteworthy that when he repeats his statement in Mark 10:24, he addresses the disciples as “children,” declaring them unburdened by status. They have already been unburdened by wealth as a result of following him.\n\nJesus’ analogy of the camel and the eye of the needle (Mark 10:25) probably has nothing to do with a small gate in Jerusalem, but could be a pun on the similarity of the Greek word for a camel (kamelos) and that for a heavy rope (kamilos). The deliberately absurd image simply emphasizes the impossibility of the rich being saved without divine help. This applies to the poor as well, for otherwise “who can be saved?” (Mark 10:26). The promise of such divine help is spelled out in Mark 10:27, “For mortals it is impossible, but not for God; for God all things are possible.” This keeps the passage (and hopefully us, as readers) from descending into a simple cynicism toward the rich.\n\nThis leads Peter to defend the disciples’ attitudes and history of self-denial. They have “left everything” to follow Jesus. Jesus’ reply affirms the heavenly reward that awaits all those who make such sacrifices. Again, the things left by such people (“house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields”) potentially have connotations of status and not merely material abundance. In fact, Mark 10:31 pulls the whole account together with a forceful emphasis on status—“Many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.” Up until this point, the account could reflect either a love for things in and of themselves, or for the status that those things provide. This last statement, though, places the emphasis firmly upon the issue of status. Soon after, Jesus declares this in explicit workplace terms. “Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all” (Mark 10:44). A slave, after all, is simply a worker with no status, not even the status of owning their own ability to work. The proper status of Jesus’ followers is that of a child or slave — no status at all. Even if we hold high positions or bear authority, we are to regard the position and authority as belonging to God, not ourselves. We are simply God’s slaves, representing him but not assuming the status that belongs to him alone.\n\nThe Temple Incident (Mark 11:15-18)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe incident where Jesus drives out the vendors and money changers from the temple has mercantile overtones. There is a debate over the precise significance of this action, both in terms of the individual Gospel accounts and in terms of the Historical Jesus tradition. Certainly, Jesus aggressively drives out those who are engaging in trade in the temple courts, whether selling clean animals and birds for sacrifice or exchanging appropriate coinage for temple offerings. It has been suggested that this is a protest over the extortionate rates being charged by those involved in the trade, and thus the abuse of the poor as they come to make offerings. Alternatively, it has been seen as a rejection of the annual half-shekel temple tax. Finally, it has been interpreted as a prophetic sign act, disrupting the processes of the temple as a foreshadowing of its coming destruction.\n\nAssuming we equate the temple to the church in today’s environment, the incident is mostly outside our scope, which is non-church-related work. We can note, though, that the incident does cast a dim light on those would attempt to use the church to secure workplace advantages for themselves. To join or use a church in order to gain a favoured business position is both commercially damaging for the community and spiritually damaging for the individual. By no means do we mean that churches and their members should avoid helping each other become better workers. But if the church becomes a commercial tool, its integrity is damaged and its witness clouded.\n\nTaxes and Caesar (Mark 12:13-17)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe issue of taxation has arisen obliquely already, in terms of the call narrative of Levi (Mark 2:13-17, see above). This section treats the matter a little more directly, although the meaning of the passage is still debatable in terms of its logic. It is interesting that the whole incident described here essentially represents a trap. If Jesus affirms Roman taxation, he will offend his followers. If he rejects it, he will face charges of treason. Because the incident hinges on such particular circumstances, we should be cautious about applying the passage to dissimilar contemporary situations.\n\nThe response of Jesus to the trap revolves around the concepts of image and ownership. Examining the common denarius coin (essentially, a day’s wage), Jesus asks whose “image” (or even “icon”) is upon the coin. The point of the question is probably to allude deliberately to Genesis 1:26-27 (humans made in the image of God) in order to create a contrast. Coins bear the image of the emperor, but humans bear the image of God. Give to the emperor what is his (money), but give to God what is his (our very lives). The core element, that humans bear the imago Dei, is unstated, but it is surely implied by the parallelism built into the logic of the argument.\n\nIn using such argumentation, Jesus subordinates the taxation issue to the greater demand of God upon our lives, but he does not thereby deny the validity of taxation, even that of the potentially abusive Roman system. Nor does he deny that money belongs to God. If money belongs to Caesar, it belongs even more to God because Caesar himself is under God’s authority (Romans 13:1-17; 1 Peter 2:13-14). This passage is no warrant for the often expressed fallacy that business is business and religion is religion. But, as we have seen, God recognizes no sacred-secular divide. You cannot pretend to follow Christ by acting as if he cares nothing about your work. Jesus is not proclaiming license to do as you please at work, but peace about the things you cannot control. You can control whether you defraud others in your work (Mark 10:18), so don’t do it. You cannot control whether you have to pay taxes (Mark 12:17), so pay them. In this passage, Jesus doesn’t say what your obligation might be if you can control (or influence) your taxes, for example, if you are a Roman senator or a voter in a twenty-first-century democracy.\n\nThis incident is discussed in greater depth under \"Luke 20:20-26\" in Luke and Work at www.theologyofwork.org.\n\nOur Work Fulfills the Great Commandment (Mark 12:28-34)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nSeeing that Jesus is skilled at interpreting scripture, a scribe asks him a question that was already under contention among Jewish leaders. “Which commandment is the first of all?” Jesus answers with two linked commandments that would be well known to his listeners. The first is a declaration to the Jewish people from Deuteronomy 6:5 “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.” Then in the same breath Jesus adds, “The second is this,” and he quotes Leviticus 19:18 ”You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” (See the TOW Bible Commentary on Leviticus 19:17-18.) If you love God, you will love your neighbor. For more on the link between these two commandments see “The Great Commandment is a Great Framework” (Matthew 22:34-40) and “The Good Samaritan at Work--Loving Your Neighbor as Yourself” (Luke 10:25-37).\n\nJesus’ wise answer gives us some insight into God’s priorities. If there are just two tasks God wants us to concentrate on more than any other they are loving God and loving those around us. It is worth mentioning that by saying, “as yourself,” Jesus also expects us to love ourselves.\n\nFaith in Our Workplaces (Video)\n\nThankfully, work can be one of the primary ways we respond to the Great Commandment. Yet many people fail to recognize that our work can be a way of loving others. Many jobs give Christians an opportunity to fulfill the basic needs of another person. Take health care, for example. A doctor who writes a prescription, a pharmacist who fills that prescription, and the person who stocks the shelves at CVS all play a role in delivering necessary health services to their neighbors. Further up and down the supply chain we see the invaluable work of scientists who test the effectiveness of medical interventions, construction workers who maintain the roads along which medication travels, and case workers who process health insurance claims, all participating in loving their neighbors by meeting their basic human needs.\n\nBut human needs do not only extend to healthcare. People also need food, shelter, laughter, and connection to meaning greater than themselves. So farmers and restaurant workers, home builders and home insurers, comedians and children, and philosophers and pastors all have a way to love others through their daily work, simply by doing their work well. Every time you cross a street, you depend on the love shown you by the mechanics who did the most recent brake jobs on every car hurtling toward the intersection.\n\nThrough work we meet our financial needs and those of our family. Since God commands each person to love ourselves, this is another way that work fulfills the Great Commandment.\n\nLastly, we might ask how we can love God through our work. One way is to love God consciously while doing our work, in a fashion made famous by sages such as Brother Lawrence. But if continuous mindfulness is not our particular gift, we can love God by doing something that God wants done. The broader story of the redemption that Jesus offers gives us a picture of what God wants done in the marketplace. Many industries or workplaces have problems that call for redemption. A Christian worker can do something God wants done by modeling forgiveness, compassion, and integrity.\n\nHowever we work, it is important to remember the order of the two parts of the Great Commandment. Loving God comes first, loving neighbor second. As Dorothy Sayers notes, “The second commandment depends upon the first, and without the first, it is a delusion and a snare…. If we put our neighbor first, we are putting man above God, and that is what we have been doing ever since we began to worship humanity and make man the measure of all things….There is, in fact, a paradox about working to serve the community, and it is this: that to aim directly at serving the community is to falsify the work; the only way to serve the community is to forget the community and serve the work.”\n\nPractically speaking, this means that we love our neighbor by doing true work, that is, work as God would have us do it. This may or may not be how our neighbor—customer, client, co-worker, supplier, etc, —would have us do it. For example our co-workers might want us to serve them by doing their work for them, but God would probably have us serve them by helping them do it themselves. Or a customer might want us to provide the product with the lowest price, whereas God might want us to educate the customer why a higher-priced item is better for the customer, the environment or the community. The first half of the Great Commandment plants our feet in the solid ground of God’s purposes. We are to work for others as servants of God, not as people-pleasers.\n\nUpon hearing Jesus’ answer to his question, the scribe concurs that Jesus is right in his priorities. Loving God and loving people are indeed more important than specific commandments required by the Jewish law. Jesus responds that his questioner is “not far from the kingdom of God.” Similarly, when we hold our own actions up to the standard of the Great Commandment, when we love God completely and care for others with the same care we show ourselves, we bring the kingdom of God to our places of work.\n\nThe Cross and Resurrection (Mark 14:32-16:8)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe topics of status and grace return to the fore as Jesus faces his trial and crucifixion. “The Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45). Even for him the path of service requires renouncing all status:\n\nThe Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death; then they will hand him over to the Gentiles; they will mock him, and spit upon him, and flog him, and kill him; and after three days he will rise again. (Mark 10:33–34)\n\nThe people — correctly — proclaim Jesus as Messiah and King (Mark 11:8-11). But he sets aside this status and submits to false accusations by the Jewish council (Mark 14:53-65), an inept trial by the Roman government (Mark 15:1-15), and death at the hands of the humanity he came to save (Mark 15:21-41). His own disciples betray (Mark 14:43-49), deny (Mark 14:66-72), and desert him (Mark 14:50-51), except for a number of the women who had supported his work all along. He takes the absolute lowest place, forsaken by God and men and women, in order to grant us eternal life. At the bitter end, he feels abandoned by God himself (Mark 15:34). Mark, alone among the Gospels, records him crying the words of Psalm 22:1, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” (Mark 15:34). On the cross, Jesus’ final work is to absorb all of the world’s forsakenness. Perhaps being misunderstood, mocked, and deserted was as hard on him, as was being put to death. He was aware that his death would be overcome in a few days, yet the misunderstanding, mockery, and desertion continue to this day.\n\nMany today also feel abandoned by friends, family, society, even God. The sense of abandonment at work can feel very strong. We can be marginalized by co-workers, crushed by labour and danger, anxious about our performance, frightened by the prospect of layoffs, and made desperate by inadequate pay and meagre benefits, as was so memorably described in Studs Terkel’s book, Working. The words of Sharon Atkins, a receptionist in Terkel’s book, speak for many people. “I’d cry in the morning. I didn’t want to get up. I’d dread Fridays because Monday was always looming over me. Another five days ahead of me. There never seemed to be any end to it. Why am I doing this?”\n\nBut God’s grace overcomes even the most crushing blows of work and life for those who will accept it. God’s grace touches people from the immediate moment of Jesus’ submission, when the centurion recognizes, “Truly this man was God’s Son!” (Mark 15:39). Grace triumphs over death itself when Jesus is restored to life. The women receive word from God that “he has been raised” (Mark 16:6). In the section on Mark 1:1-13, we noted the abruptness of the ending. This is not a pretty story for religious pageants but God’s gut-wrenching intervention in the grit and grime of our ragged lives and work. The busted tomb of the crucified criminal is more proof than most of us can stand that “many who are first will be last, and the last will be first” (Mark 10:31). Yet this amazing grace is the one way our work can yield “a hundredfold now in this age” and our lives lead into “the age to come, eternal life” (Mark 10:30). No wonder that “terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid” (Mark 16:8).\n\nConclusions: Drawing Together Some Threads (Mark)\n\nBack to Table of Contents Back to Table of Contents\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is not organized as an instruction manual for human work, but work is visible on every page. We have drawn out some of the most significant threads in this tapestry of life and labour, and applied them to issues of twenty-first-century work. There are many kinds of work, and many contexts in which people work. The unifying theme is that all of us are called to the work of growing, restoring, and governing God’s creation, even while we await the final accomplishment of God’s intent for the world when Christ returns.\n\nWithin this grand outline, it is striking that much of Mark’s narrative revolves around identity themes. Mark shows that entering the kingdom of God requires transformation in our personal identity and communal relationships. Issues of status and identity were wrapped up with wealth and employment in the ancient world in a much more formal way than is the case today. But the underlying dynamics have not changed radically. Issues of status still influence our choices, decisions, and goals as workers. Roles, labels, affiliations, and relationships all factor into our employment and can cause us to make decisions for better or worse. We can all be vulnerable to the desire to assert our place in society by means of our property, wealth, or potential influence, and this, in turn, can affect our vocational decisions. All of these elements factor into our sense of identity, of who we are. Jesus’ challenge to be ready to relinquish the claims of earthly status is, therefore, of fundamental significance. Relatively few may be called to the particular choices made by the twelve disciples, to leave their employment entirely, but the challenge to subordinate worldly identity to the demands of the kingdom is universal. Self-denial is the essence of following Jesus. Such an attitude involves the refusal to allow our identity to be determined by our status in a fallen world.\n\nSuch a radical self-denial is impossible without grace. God’s grace is the miracle that transforms life and work, so that we are capable of living and serving in God’s kingdom while we dwell in a fallen world. Yet God’s grace seldom comes through instantaneous transformation. The narrative of the disciples is one of failure and restoration, of eventual, not immediate, change. Like them, our service in the kingdom of God remains marred by sin and failure. Like them, we find it necessary to repent of much along the way. Perhaps, though, we will also be like them in leaving a lasting legacy in the world, a kingdom whose borders have been expanded by our activity, and whose life has been enriched by our citizenship. As hard as it is to give up the things that inhibit us from following Christ to the full in our work, we find that serving him in our work is far more rewarding (Mark 10:29-32) than serving ourselves and our follies."
