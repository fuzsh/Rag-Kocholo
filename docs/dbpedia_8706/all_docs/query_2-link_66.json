        "text": "Definition:\n\na brutal person; bully\n\nExamples:\n\n'You try me too much. A ruffian - a common brawling ruffian - that's what you have become.'\n\n- Arthur Conan Doyle, The Lost World, 1912\n\nShe marries a lawyer she doesn’t love, a man who diverges in every way from her “usual muesli mix of art-damaged ruffians.”\n\n— Molly Young, The New York Times, 29 Jun. 2022\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nRuffians specialize in roughness, and between the 16th and 18th centuries, they were also synonymous with pimps - men who solicit clients for prostitutes.\n\nDefinition:\n\na captious critic\n\nExamples:\n\nLet the grumbling smellfungi of this world, who cultivate taste among books, cobwebs, and spiders, rail at the extravagance of the age.\n\n- Washington Irving (writing as Anthony Evergreen), Salmagundi, 1820\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nOur language contains a glorious profusion of words for critics of all stripes. We have terms for an inferior critic (criticaster), a jealous critic (zoilus), and a severe critic (aristarch). None of them has quite the same bite as smellfungus, a lovely morsel of an insult, which comes from the name of a character in Laurence Sterne's 1768 book, A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy.\n\nDefinition:\n\na mischievous and often morally corrupt person\n\nExamples:\n\nThe captain of Company L refused to recognize us; said we were deserters, and traitors, and scalawags; and when he drew rations for Company L from the commissary, he wouldn't give us any.\"\n\n- Jack London, The Road, 1907\n\nWhile not as nerve-racking as some of the other daredevil productions, but no less captivating, is Anchors Aweigh Parade — a fun, high-seas spectacle with scalawags, swashbucklers, fleets and flotillas.\n\n— Domhnall O’Donoghue, Belfast Telegraph, 4 Jun. 2022\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nAlso spelled scallywag, this term may originally have referred to an animal of very little value. After the Civil War, scalawag came to describe a white Southerner acting in support of reconstruction governments, often in pursuit of private gain; it was used to insult Rhett Butler in Gone With the Wind.\n\nThe origin of scalawag is unknown, but one theory suggests there's a link to the Scottish scoloc, a first-born son given to the Church to educate.\n\nDefinition:\n\na tricky deceitful fellow\n\nExamples:\n\nA knave, a rascal, an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy worsted-stocking knave ...\"\n\n— William Shakespeare, King Lear, 1605-6\n\nA nadir was reached when the cash-strapped Lloyd George began selling peerages to those the king regarded as cads, knaves and blackguards.\n\n— Simon Heffer, The Telegraph (London, Eg.), 6 Nov. 2021\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nThe Bard was particularly fond of the word knave - it crops up throughout his plays. One of the oldest words in English, knave comes from the Old English cnafa, meaning \"boy\" or \"male servant.\"\n\nDefinition:\n\nrascal; an idle worthless person\n\nExamples:\n\nThe devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull.\n\n- Herman Melville, Moby Dick, 1851\n\nRather, Bowie’s pronouncements, and his charmingly flippant parrying of the ignorant questions of interviewers, seem like the playful, clearly insincere braggadocio of a young rapscallion still finding himself.\n\n— Caspar Salmon, The Daily Beast, May 24 2022\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nThere are no scallions in rapscallion. Rapscallion is an alteration of rascallion, which is itself an irregular formation of rascal, a term born in an Old French dialect word meaning \"to scrape, clean off.\"\n\nDefinition:\n\na seeming friend who is secretly an enemy\n\nExamples:\n\nOne whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermandsThe passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands.\n\n- William Shakespeare, A Comedy of Errors, 1623\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nThe enemy posing as a friend has been a common enough creature that we have had a word for it for five hundred years or so. More recently, we’ve seen a rise in usage of the portmanteau frenemy (\"one who pretends to be a friend but is actually an enemy.\")\n\nAlthough frenemy is of far more recent vintage than backfriend, it is not a creation of the 21st century. Frenemy can be found as far back as 1939, when an article in the August Chronicle stated \"A frenemy is someone who's your friend today, but may be your enemy tomorrow.\"\n\nDefinition:\n\nan insignificant anonymous writer\n\nExamples:\n\nRail away, my little libellous anonymuncule.\n\n- W. Lynd, The Gentleman's Magazine, Sept., 1882\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nWe often hear today of the many ways that the Internet has changed social discourse, some number of which are exaggerated. One thing that the Internet has certainly done is to give rise to a burgeoning class of anonymuncules. We are inundated with such creatures, both in the comment sections of articles published on the web, and through various forms of social media, such as Twitter.\n\nThe word is a blend of anonymous and homunculus (\"a little man\").\n\nDefinition:\n\na morally corrupt or depraved person\n\nExamples:\n\nYou are a heartless reprobate, sir; a heartless, thankless, good-for-nothing reprobate. I have done with you. You are my son; that I cannot help - but you shall have no more part or parcel in me as my child, nor I in you as your father.\n\n- Anthony Trollope, Barchester Towers, 1857\n\nAt the time, his directorial efforts included intimate short films (including the Oscar-nominated \"Two Cars, One Night\") and features like \"Boy,\" an affectionate, coming-of-age tribute to his upbringing in a rural Maori community, about a child enthralled by his charmingly reprobate father (played by Waititi, of course).\n\n— Dave Itzkoff, New York Times, 3 Jul. 2022\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nReprobate comes from the Latin reprobare, meaning \"to disapprove\" or \"to condemn.\" The word is frequently used in the King James Version of the Bible to describe someone who understands God's will but chooses to not follow it.\n\nDefinition:\n\na credulous person; especially : one who believes everything he or she hears\n\nExamples:\n\nThe Gobemouche abounds in clubs, coffee-houses, Capel Courts, Bellamy's, and all old women's tea-parties.\n\n- Punch, or the London Charivari, 1857\n\nGobemouche is evidence that certain unpleasant things, when cloaked in the veneer of French, can sound rather pleasant.\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nThe word rolls off the tongue easily, and sounds quite lovely; however, if we look at the etymology it more or less translates to \"fly gulper\" (from the French gober, meaning \"to swallow whole\", and mouche, meaning \"fly\").\n\nDefinition:\n\na spoiled child\n\nExamples:\n\nO, you are a meere mammothrept in judgement then.\n\n- Ben Jonson, The Workes of Beniamin Ionson, 1616\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nMammothrept comes to the English language from the Greek word mammothreptos, which means, delightfully enough, \"child brought up by his grandmother\".\n\nIt hardly matters whether children raised by a grandmother are indeed more likely to be spoiled; such a fine and descriptive word as mammothrept deserves to be used to describe spoiled children regardless of who has raised them.\n\nDefinition:\n\na man who acts with deliberate disregard for another's feelings or rights\n\nExamples:\n\n'You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter!'\n\n- James Jyce, Ulysses, 1922\n\nBut the version of Kroc, portrayed so brilliantly by Michael Keaton in the film, is also a cut-throat, a drunk and an utter cad.\n\n— Karl Quinn, Sydney Morning Herald (Sydney, Aus.), 19 Nov. 2016\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nOne of the few gender-specific terms on this list, cad is a shortening of caddie, a Scottish term for one who waits around for odd jobs. (This sense of the term eventually developed into the golfing sense of caddie.) These days, cad is commonly linked to romantic misbehavior.\n\nDefinition:\n\na bigoted adherent to exposed but customary error\n\nExamples:\n\nA tough carrion, she draws like a Whirl-pool, and would kill a Man as easily as a Cat sucks the breath of a Child: Go thy ways old Mumpsimus, the mark's in thy mouth still.\n\n- Thomas Duffett, Psyche Debauch'd, 1678\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nThe ostensible origin of mumpsimus is that long ago there was an illiterate priest who was in the habit of using this word when saying mass, rather than the correct Latin word sumpsimus (which means \"we have taken\"). When confronted with this error, the priest was reported to have said that he refused to change his old mumpsimus for the new sumpsimus offered by his critic.\n\nDefinition:\n\na reckless unprincipled person; an incorrigible rascal\n\nExamples:\n\nHe refused ever to work, borrowed money on his father's credit, which he never returned, passed bad checks; was, in short, an out-and-out good-for-nothing scapegrace.\n\n— Helen Warburton, \"Jerry\" in The Smart Set, January 1916\n\nOnscreen, Temple has a pouty, childlike presence and a slightly feral quality, like a girl raised by some very emotionally available wolves. Her affect evokes old-timey words — scamp, scapegrace, minx. (Hunt described her as “a pip.”)\n\n— Alexandra Soloski, The New York Times, 28 Jul. 2021\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nScapegrace may come from the notion of escaping (scape meaning \"to escape\") the grace of God. However serious that sounds, scapegrace, like scamp, is often used lightheartedly.\n\nDefinition:\n\na stupid awkward person\n\nExamples:\n\nIt's this that marks our senseless tawpies, And shames us a' as Gillygaupies\n\n- Hector MacNeill, Bygane Times, and Late Come Changes, 1811\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nIt is an indisputable fact that some people are stupid, and we have a great number of words with which to describe them (birdbrain, blockhead, dummy, etc.). A further number of people are awkward, and we likewise have many words to choose from when describing them (bungler, klutz, and so on).\n\nBut what of the person who manages to be both stupid and awkward? Well, that person is a gillygaupus. Now you know.\n\nDefinition:\n\na usually young man who does noisy and violent things as part of a group or gang; hoodlum\n\nExamples:\n\nWhen Billy Windsor had mentioned the gangs, he had formed a mental picture of low-browed hooligans, keeping carefully to their own quarter of the town.\n\n- P.G. Wodehouse, Psmith, Journalist, 1915\n\nEnglish mobs storming mosques, marching like hooligans, or intruding on the private property of Muslims, essentially taking the law into their own hands, with little to zero punitive action from authorities.\n\n— Tehrab Times (Tehran, Ir.), 28 Jun. 2022\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nThis word may be eponymous: Patrick Hooligan was an Irish-born ruffian who attained notoriety (and who died in prison) in London shortly before the turn of the 20th century. It's still associated with Britain, where \"football hooliganism\" is sometimes referred to as the \"English disease.\"\n\nDefinition:\n\nan absurdly argumentative person\n\nExamples:\n\nWhats here, chop logicke. - William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, 1597\n\nChoplogic has two meanings, and can refer to either \"involved and often specious argumentation\" or the kind of person who engages in such behavior.\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nThe word was formed by a combination of logic and an obsolete sense of chop meaning \"to bandy words, answer back.\"\n\nYou should be warned that knowing what to call such a person will in no way alleviate your displeasure should you have to deal with one.\n\nDefinition:\n\nrascal; rogue\n\nExamples:\n\n'Not by my will,' said Mr. Vincy. 'I shall have enough to do this year, with an idle scamp of a son, without paying for wedding-clothes.'\n\n- George Eliot, Middlemarch, 1871-2\n\nIt’s a sign of the alternate reality we have warped into that Eminem — the lovable scamp who made his career motor-mouthing fantasies of murdering his ex-wife, shooting up clubs and assaulting strippers — is now pitching gun safety legislation and get-out-the-vote drives.\n\n— Jemayel Khawaja, Variety (Los Angeles, CA), 18 Jan. 2020\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nScamp once functioned as a verb meaning \"to roam about idly\" (think scamper). The noun we've featured here appeared later, and has a more playful overtone than some other words on this list.\n\nDefinition:\n\none belonging to or suited to the lowest moral or economic condition of usually urban civilization : a street urchin\n\nExamples:\n\nShe says that when police showed her a picture of Abedi, she was shocked by his youth. She could not see how a “guttersnipe” like him, who didn’t “look old enough to shave”, could have destroyed so many lives.\n\n— Nick Hilton & Sean Ogrady, the Independent 9London, Eng.), 15 Apt. 2022\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nFor many people, guttersnipe conjures up images of a Dickensian waif, some ill-clothed and iller-fed child of the streets, making their way through Victorian London by hook or crook. Which makes sense, in a way, since the works of Charles Dickens are well-populated with guttersnipes.\n\nDickens, however, seems to have not used the word in any of his writing. There is evidence of the word being used as early as 1824, it initially referred to a pig, and was not in wide use to describe children at the time that Dickens was writing.\n\nDefinition:\n\na base, despicable, or vile person; a miserable person\n\nExamples:\n\nAmazing grace! How sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like me. / I once was lost, but now am found, / Was blind but now I see.\n\n- John Newton, Amazing Grace, 1779\n\nNo need to apologize to the ungrateful wretch. She made that bed abundantly over the years and is lying in it, griping.\n\n— Newsday, 28 Jun. 2022\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nWretch has been part of English about as long as knave. Wretch's Old English ancestor meant \"outcast; exile,\" which raises this question: Did our ancestors exile despicable people, or did those they exile become miserable as a result of their expulsion?\n\nDefinition:\n\na mealymouthed sanctimonious hypocrite\n\nExamples:\n\nWe therefore protest to-day against these \"Mawworms\" of the press, who are always indulging in querulous complaints of plagiarism, and all the while are the greatest of literary pilferers.\n\n— The Freemason, 1875\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nDoes the definition for mawworm have a slight ring of personal affront to it? As a rule, a definition should not be clouded by the likes or dislikes of the lexicographer. But perhaps this definer once had a bad run-in with a mawworm?\n\nOn the other hand, it is also a fine definition, and very clearly explains what this word means.\n\nDefinition:\n\none that is excessively greedy for money\n\nExamples:\n\nI melt in tears to see the Rebels reignIn Court and City with their hungry train,That like Purse-Leeches in the Lawyers Inn,Sucks others Wealth, to enrich their begging Kin.- G.P., Englands Murthering Monsters, 1660\n\nAbout the Word:\n\nIf you ever find yourself being described with a word that contains \"leech\" in it, chances are very high that you are not being complimented. One of the things that is enjoyable about a word such as purse-leech is that while it is archaic and obscure, it is also very simple to understand, and requires no additional explanation."
