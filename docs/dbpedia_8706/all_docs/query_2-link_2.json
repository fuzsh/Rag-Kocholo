        "text": "Laurence Marks used to work as a journalist for the Sunday Times. On 28 February 1975, his father was killed in the Moorgate train crash. Laurence was given the job of conducting a year-long investigation for the newspaper into the cause of the crash, with access to the transcript of the inquest into the 43 deaths. Although the inquest and the Government Inquiry recorded a verdict of accidental death, Marks concluded that the crash occurred because the driver committed suicide. After completing the report he decided that he needed a complete change of career, and began writing comedy scripts with childhood friend Maurice Gran, creating such classics as _\"Shine On Harvey Moon\" (1982)_, The New Statesman (1987), Hallo Mädels! (1989) and Goodnight Sweetheart (1993)."
