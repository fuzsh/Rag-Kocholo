Should include as appropriate to convey speech style, stalling, or significant pauses. We aim to include about 75%, but the narrator may have a different preference.\n\nLaughter\n\n[Laughs.] Period inside the bracket if outside sentence.\n\n[laughs] No period inside the brackets if within sentence.\n\n[They laugh.] NOT [Laughter.]\n\nNo \"chuckles,\" etc. Do not editorialize.\n\nAgreeing and disagreeing\n\nMm-hmm [affirmative] or uh-huh [affirmative].\n\nMm-mm [negative] or Unh-uh [negative].\n\nPeriod after bracket if stands alone\n\nNo period inside the brackets if within sentence.\n\nOkay, not OK.\n\nOkayed for past tense\n\nOther Sounds\n\nNonverbal sounds are indicated in brackets and should be included especially if they are acknowledged by those present (interview participants or others in the interview environment).\n\n[coughs]\n\n[clears throat]\n\n[yawns]\n\n[cries], [whispers], [yells], [throws voice], [blows raspberry]\n\n[telephone rings] – use when phone rings once.\n\n[telephone ringing] – use for sustained ringing in background.\n\n[iPhone rings], [iPhone ringing].\n\n[alarm sounds], [alarm rings] – depends on sound.\n\n[Cat meows], [parrot talking], [dog barking]\n\nPauses/interruptions/breaks in thought\n\nUse \"—\" (em dash), not \"…\" (see below for how to use ellipses) and not \"--\" (double dashes).\n\nNo spaces around em dash.\n\nExample: yellow—the color—not blue.\n\nIf one speaker finishes another's sentence:\n\nNARRATOR: So then I—\n\nINTERVIEWER: —ran outside?\n\nTry to keep expressions of interruptions to these:\n\n[Audio break.]\n\n[Cross talk.]\n\n[Side conversation.]\n\n[Recorder stops, restarts.]\n\nAffected or Imitative Speech\n\nWhen imitating a specific person: [imitating X] where X is the name of the person being imitated. Offset the words/phrase in quotes.\n\nWhen affected speech, put the affect in brackets: [in a posh British accent] or [in a Southern drawl].[1]\n\nUnspoken gestures\n\nBracket in text.\n\n[points to painting], [looking at book], [claps], [snaps fingers].\n\nInformation\n\nEllipses\n\nUse ellipses to indicate portions of the audio that have been deleted from the transcript.\n\nBracket ellipses.\n\nType three dots, with spaces between dots: #[.#.#.]# (or end-sentence punctuation if within sentence).\n\nIf the sentence ends before the ellipses, period goes in normal place, then begin #[.#.#.]# (CMS 17/13.53ff).\n\nNo need for ellipses if the deletions are \"uh\" words (\"you know,\" \"I mean,\" \"like,\" etc.), brief false starts, or self-corrections.\n\nIdentify bracketed ellipses as described below.\n\nIn legacy transcripts, ellipses may have been used to indicate pauses.\n\nBrackets\n\nUse brackets for information added or removed after the interview is recorded.\n\nFormat: [additional information or ellipses + space + en dash + initials of narrator, interviewer, or –Ed.]\n\nUse –Ed. if added or deleted by AAA\n\nBracket without initials if small (one- or two-word) change differs from the recorded version, unless it is important to indicate speaker made the change.\n\nCorrection of simple tense, gender, article, etc., that would not be audibly discernable need not be bracketed.\n\nNo need for brackets if an \"[inaudible]\" is replaced with the originally spoken word(s).\n\nRemove home addresses from the body of the transcript; use [. . . –Ed.] or [narrator's home –Ed.].\n\nAdding information\n\nAdd only if essential to understanding context and not easily available to search.\n\n[Inaudible.] or [inaudible].\n\n[ph]; do not use [sp] (sp) since it's spoken, not written.\n\nPut brackets around all words that are being guessed at, with (ph) before closing brackets.\n\nExample: [a quick brown fox (ph)].\n\n[sic] (CMS 13.61) Use sparingly.\n\nItalicized in brackets. When appearing alongside correction can include in same bracket.\n\nExample: S-P-O-H-M. Clay Spohm [sic Spohn –Ed].\n\nStates should be abbreviated if inside brackets [Cranbrook, MI].\n\nNew York (the city) can be [New York, NY] or [New York City]; the latter is especially useful if the discussion is clearly in the city.\n\nDo not add full names of persons, places, or titles of exhibitions, works, or publications unless necessary, i.e., obscure, needed to distinguish from a similar one, wouldn't make sense, or would be unsearchable without it.\n\nBook citation: only as needed for reader to search, usually just author or title or year of publication; at most: [Author. Title. City of publication: publisher, year of publication], but usually [Title, year].\n\nExhibition info: as above; at most: [Title. Museum, city, dates (or \"traveled,\" years)].\n\nAcronyms\n\nSpell out only when necessary (if unclear in context).\n\nACC [American Craft Council]\n\nNCECA [National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts]\n\nAmpersand\n\nLeave ampersand in if considered the proper name:\n\nVictoria and Albert Museum, the V&A (exceptions can occur).\n\nTitles\n\nItalics\n\nExhibition\n\nwork of art (including installation, performance)\n\nbook\n\nmovie\n\ntelevision or radio show (series)\n\nplay\n\nopera\n\nmajor musical composition\n\nlong poem published as a single work\n\nblog title\n\ncomputer game\n\nship (USS Enterprise)\n\nnewspaper (\"the\" is lowercased, Roman)\n\nQuotes\n\nPoem\n\nsong\n\nlecture\n\nsingle episode of television or radio show\n\nindividual blog entry or section\n\nweb page entry or section\n\nacademic course (only if context calls for it)\n\nUppercase no quotes or italics:\n\nart movements (see list under Art Periods and Movements)\n\ncomputer program\n\nbuilding of architectural significance\n\nseries (related group of artworks or regularly recurring exhibition or event)\n\nposter\n\nT-shirt title\n\nstudy or cultural program\n\nregular column (in magazine, journal, newspaper, or website)\n\nhistorical event\n\nlecture series\n\nconference\n\nformal academic department/position/course title (lean to lowercase)\n\nLowercase, but can be uppercase if critical to clarity of narrative or used in a formal title.\n\nteaching or administrative position\n\nformal academic department/position/course title (lean to lowercase)\n\nmuseum department\n\ncommittee, or course\n\nprize - capitalize if proper name (Pulitzer Prize); lowercase if generic (gold medal) (see Preferred Spellings for Frequently Encountered Words and Terms for specific examples)\n\nAward titles commonly encountered\n\nFulbright Program (various awards within)\n\nGuggenheim Fellowship\n\nMacArthur Fellowship\n\nNEA grant (certain specific grants are capped)\n\nRhodes Scholar/Scholarship\n\nTechniques and materials\n\nCapitalize if proper noun: NuGold, Damascus steel, ColorCore.\n\nLowercase if general technique or style: hishii, kumboo, niello, netsuke.\n\nUse \"karat\" instead of \"K,\" unless actually spoken as \"K.\"\n\nWord Treatment\n\nEthnicities, national groups, and people\n\nNames of ethnic and national groups are capitalized. Associated adjectives are also capitalized.\n\nAfrican American (no hyphen)\n\nAmerican Indians\n\nAsian\n\nAsian American (no hyphen)\n\nBIPOC (if spoken)\n\nBlack (The lowercase black is a color, not a person: Black people, Black culture, Black literature, Black studies, Black colleges.)\n\nBrown\n\nChicano/Chicana/Chicanx\n\nHispanic\n\nIndigenous (adj.: capitalize this term when referring to original inhabitants of a place; proper noun.)\n\nIndian\n\nLatino/Latina/Latinx\n\nNative American\n\nNative American\n\nNative (Capitalize when using it as a synonym for \"American Indian and Alaska Native.\" adj: lowercase.)\n\nTribe, Tribal (capitalize only when referring to a specific tribe.)\n\nNegro\n\nwhite (lowercase; see Archives for Black Lives in Philadelphia: Anti-Racist Description Resources[2] and New York Times style guide[3].)\n\nDialect\n\nDo not transcribe dialect.\n\nExample: dropping the -ing; transcribe the full word. (drinkin' becomes drinking).\n\nException: If it's in Merriam-Webster keep it as is (gonna, wanna, nother, and 'em with a preceding verb are all fine). But this may depend on the narrator's wishes. (see: \"Talking White\": An anti-oppression view towards transcribing Black narrators by Alissa Rae Funderburk[4]).\n\nDo transcribe AAVE (African American Vernacular English).\n\nLetters used as words or letters\n\nS-curve, L-shaped room (capitalized; no italics, no quotes); X number of turns (CMS 7.67).\n\nIndividual letters and combinations of letters of the Latin alphabet are usually italicized. (CMS 7.64)\n\nExamples: \"An accent on the z.\" \"a capital W\" \"How many ts in that last name?\"\n\nSpelling out names/terms in narrative: use caps with dashes: Smith, S-M-I-T-H.\n\nSome speakers us the word \"capital\" when spelling as a clarification. Transcribe the word \"capital,\" but put dashes around it to maintain consistency.\n\nExample: M-A-C capital-L-E-capital-S-U-E-U-R (for the name Mac LeSueur).\n\nExample: capital-M-C-capital-C-A-U-S-L-A-N-D (for the name McCausland).\n\nOnomatopoeias\n\nFlexible, depending on context, but often italics to set apart: Boom!\n\nItalics are not necessary for casual speech such as \"blah, blah, blah.\"\n\nThis differs from CMS.\n\nProfanity\n\nKeep as spoken. Do not alter.\n\nWhen this euphemism/phrase is spoken in this way: \"the N word.\"\n\nContent Warnings\n\nUse this note in the Preface to the interview as the third paragraph:\n\nSome language in this transcript may be offensive. It is presented as it exists in the original audio recording for the benefit of research. This material in no way reflects the views of the Archives of American Art or the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nUse this note in the transcript near the passage, preferably in between speakers. Use as many times as needed throughout the transcript.\n\n[Some language in the following passage may be offensive. It is presented as it exists in the original audio recording for the benefit of research. This material in no way reflects the views of the Archives of American Art or the Smithsonian Institution. –Ed.]\n\nWords used as terms\n\nThe so-called X (no special treatment).\n\nNumbers\n\nSpelling out versus numerals\n\nSpell out numbers under 10, including ordinals and street names and numbers (One Fifth Avenue).\n\nExceptions for some technical terms, such as \"cone 2\"\n\nWhen a transcript contains numerous listings of dimensions, then numerals may be more practical.\n\nIf the speaker says, \"3 or 400,\" then use \"3[00] or 400\" for clarity.\n\nUse 9/11 (terrorist attacks) and 9-1-1 (emergency call).\n\nNumerals are okay for numbers under 10 if the full date is spoken.\n\nSpell out numbers that begin a sentence, unless it is a year.\n\n\"1934 was the year I went to Spain.\" (or '34)\n\nHyphenate (non-year) numbers such as \"Thirty-four\" when beginning a sentence.\n\nDo not include \"-th\" \"-rd\" \"-st\" \"-nd\" after numerals\n\nExample: 11th, 3rd, 1st, 2nd in full dates (dates that include year).\n\nException: Okay to use in street names.\n\nLeave out the word \"the\" if spoken between month and day.\n\nExample: \"April the 3rd, 1964\" becomes \"April 3, 1964\"\n\nUse en dash for date spans, but comma if narrator is casting around for a date: \"It was around 1967, '68; I'm not sure.\"\n\nFractions and dimensions\n\nSpell out the words \"inches\" or \"feet,\" etc.\n\nUse hyphens for exact fractions (\"one-half\"), but not inexact fractions (\"a third\").\n\nNumerals for numbers using decimals, \"1.5 inches\" (as spoken).\n\nWhile we would normally use \"eight by 10 inches,\" if a transcript uses dimensions frequently, it could work better to use all numerals, even \"8x10.\"\n\nOnly add dimensional units (\"[inches]\") if necessary for clarity, and even then, not in every instance.\n\nHyphenate fractional numbers when they are adjectives: \"a four-and-a-half-year project,\" or used as noun (see Age section), but not when an adverb: \"She was four and a half years old.\" \"I was sixteen and a half.\"\n\nTime and temperature\n\nSpell out whole numbers under 10 (one o'clock) unless exact time:\n\nExample: two o'clock or 2 a.m. (as spoken), 2:15.\n\nSpell out the word \"degrees\" for temperatures.\n\nPercentages\n\nSpell out numbers under 10, except decimals.\n\nSpell out the word \"percent.\"\n\nYears\n\n1950s, or '50s\n\n19th century (hyphenate when an adjective: 19th-century painting).\n\nearly '50s, mid-'50s, late '50s, '72–74 (use en dash for year spans, unless \"through\" is spoken; no apostrophe needed after dash for ending year in span).\n\n1972 or ['7]3 (if they just say \"three\"); 2004 or ['0]5\n\nYears spoken without the 0 (instead of 1907, it sounds like 19 7). Write these instances out as 1907 (not 19[0]7).\n\nAge\n\n\"in his 30s,\" \"in his mid-30s.\"\n\n\"She was two years old,\" but \"She acted like a two-year-old.\"\n\n\"He was 30-something.\"\n\nMoney\n\nSpell out the symbol for whole numbers under 10: four dollars (but $7.50).\n\nUse a symbol with numerals for sums over one hundred dollars, with or without \"dollars\" spoken: $5,000, $8 million. (CMS 9.24)\n\nIf the speaker says, \"$3 or 400,\" then use \"$3[00] or 400\" for clarity.\n\nExample: \"I believe, that the one on the interior building was about $8[000] or 9,000.\"\n\nCents: Same as dollars regarding numerals and using ¢ symbol after the numbers. (CMS 9.20)\n\nExample: ten cents, 75¢\n\nThousands are sometimes represented by K.\n\nExample: $150K\n\nNon-US currencies are handled the same way as US currencies. (CMS 9.21, 9.23)\n\nPunctuation and Syntax\n\nPunctuation within and around brackets\n\nSee CMS 6.98 and especially 6.103.\n\nIf bracketed material is a simple addition of information, such as name, date, location, translation, etc., do not add a comma, semicolon, or colon with the brackets; okay to use within if needed.\n\nExample: September 7 [1935] (no commas around year).\n\nExample: [September 7, 1935] (no comma after the year).\n\nExample: \"He moved to [Cranston] Rhode Island for the sea air.\" Even though, if there were no brackets, it would be \"He moved to Cranston, Rhode Island, for the sea air.\"\n\nIf the material is added as part of the speaker's own words, and requires punctuation to correctly form the sentence, then punctuation may be added as needed.\n\nCMS example: \"[Dear Jacob,] It's been…\"\n\nExample: But if we were only inserting the name \"Jacob,\" it would be: \"Dear [Jacob], it's been . . .\" (comma outside the bracket).\n\nExample: “. . . in the old days [flying by the seat of our pants –RPW].\" Even though, if the final phrase were unbracketed, it would be preceded by a comma. In this instance, the insertion is treated as a parenthetical phrase.\n\nA question mark, exclamation point, or close quotes precedes a closing bracket only if it belongs solely to the added material; they follow it if they belong to the hosting sentence.\n\nExample: I told him, \"You come back [here]!\"\n\nSimilarly, a period precedes the closing bracket only if the entire sentence stands alone inside brackets; otherwise it follows.\n\nExample: [It was a Thursday.]\n\nExample: I saw Bob Brown at the end [of the day]. He was on his way to Boston.\n\nIf bracketed ellipses are entirely self-contained outside of the surrounding sentences, they do not require a period.\n\nExample: I said yes. [. . .] The door opened. (CMS 13.58) Note spacing: #[.#.#.]#.\n\nCommas\n\nUse the serial comma: a, b, and c.\n\nUse commas between repeated adjectives when serving as intensifiers\n\nExample: \"It was a large, large show.\"\n\nDo not use commas when words are repeated to convey naturalness or purity.\n\nExample: \"Her work was photography photography\"\n\nSee specific usage sections.\n\nRecalled or paraphrased dialogue\n\nNo need for quotes if internal dialogue or generalized or casually recalled.\n\nSet off with comma and cap first word even if not using quotes.\n\nAdaptable to individual cases.\n\nPassages Read Aloud\n\nPut dialogue in quotes\n\nMay add [reading from text] (or similar) in brackets before the reading\n\nColon\n\nOnly one space after a colon\n\nCapitalize after colon only when:\n\nfor a direct question\n\nintroducing more than one sentence or question\n\nfor speech or dialogue\n\nCompound words or expressions\n\nGenerally, do not hyphenate for adverbs—never for adverbs ending in \"ly.\"\n\nHyphenate expressions such as \"day to day\" only when they are used as adjectives.\n\nGenerally, for techniques such as \"pit fire\" or \"salt glaze,\" hyphenate when used as adjectives or verbs (see Preferred Spellings list).\n\nSlashes\n\nShould be changed to something that makes sense if spoken (usually a hyphen) since you can't speak a slash, unless the speaker actually says \"slash.\" Flexible for individual cases.\n\nPlural names and plural possessives\n\n\"They had many Giottos\"—no apostrophe\n\nPrince Charles's, singular possessive ('s)\n\nThe James' children, plural possessive (')\n\nAvoiding run-on sentences\n\nTwo complete sentences separated by a conjunction require a comma.\n\nShort compound sentences with closely related meanings, especially if simultaneous or sequential actions, can go without a comma, unless a comma would aid in understanding the sense.\n\nWhen there is one subject with two verbs (\"She raised animals and drove a tractor\"), which wouldn't require a comma, if there are multiple objects that need to be separated for clarity, go ahead and add a comma: \"She raised cats, dogs, and hamsters, and drove a tractor.\"\n\nAppositives and interjections\n\nInterjections should be contained within commas.\n\nOh, my God,\n\nIt is spoken, rather than written, prose.\n\n\"He is, like, a very relaxed person.\" (Though we may omit some \"like\"s if overused.)\n\nWhen \"like\" is used to estimate an amount, it does not need commas: \"There were like 50 people there.\"\n\nThe year of a given full date should be enclosed in commas.\n\nA state listed after the town should be enclosed in commas.\n\n\"et cetera\" is no longer considered an appositive and need not be contained in commas. It should be treated as any other list item.\n\nSpell out; do not use abbreviation.\n\n\"Jr.\" or \"Sr.\" after a name no longer requires enclosing commas.\n\n\"So\" at the beginning of a sentence is usually being used conversationally as a simple conjunction and does not require a comma. If used as an interjection or parenthetical (usually to change the subject), then use a comma.\n\nRestrictive and nonrestrictive clauses\n\nRestrictive (dependent) introductory clauses (containing subject and verb) should be set off by commas.\n\nDependent clauses at the end of sentences present special consideration—determine if the clause is restrictive individually. (CMS 17/6.25.)\n\nSpecial constructions\n\nIt was, what, 1997?\n\nIt was—what—1997?\n\nQuote, unquote: Transcribe all spoken words, but quotation marks around the word/s the speaker notes.\n\nExample: The quote, unquote, \"celebration\"\n\nExample: The quote \"new world\" unquote\n\nAir quotes/scare quotes: Do not mark the gesture in brackets. Do put the word/s in regular quotes.\n\nComma after question mark or exclamation point only when following a title or quote containing a question mark/exclamation point, or if grammatically necessary, but not with dialogue\n\nExample: \"Are you here?\" she asked (CMS 17/6.124–26)\n\ndark-type (slang, not a word)\n\nacademic-wise (slang, not a word)\n\nThe thing is, I never went there. (Comma stands in for \"that\")\n\nWords and Phrases not in English\n\nIf in Merriam-Webster, treat as any other word.\n\nIf not in Merriam-Webster, italicize.\n\nFlexible for individual cases.\n\nVideo Captioning\n\nID speaker\n\nFull name in all caps with colon for first instance of speech by each person in video file.\n\nThereafter, use last name, all caps, with colon, for each conversational change of speaker\n\nTwo speakers\n\nFull name in all caps with colon for first instance of speech by each person. Thereafter, use last name, all caps, with colon, for each conversational change in speaker\n\nReflexive speech (ums, like, etc.)\n\nCan include in captions as appropriate to convey speech style, stalling, or significant pauses. Not necessary to transcribe each instance.\n\nFeedback words, agreement, disagreement\n\nAffirmative, use: Mm-hmm or Uh-huh\n\nNegative, use: Mm-mm or Unh-uh\n\nOkay, not OK\n\nIncomplete sentence hanging phrase, parenthetic statement\n\nEnd with an em dash (—). No space before or after em dashes (—).\n\nSignificant pause, break in thought\n\nEnd with an em dash (—). No space before or after em dashes (—).\n\nInterruption\n\nEnd with an em dash (—). No space before or after em dashes (—)\n\nTwo speakers with abrupt interruptions\n\nFor very quick exchanges within the same caption, use hyphen with no space. Resume using last name, all caps with colon, when a speaker resumes at length.\n\nCan also use [Cross talk.] or [Side conversation.] if content is unintelligible or insignificant.\n\nVideo or Teleconferencing\n\nHow to represent the distortions, glitches, or audio lag that plague teleconferencing platforms\n\n[digital distortion]\n\n[digital echo]\n\nSounds other than talking, sound effects\n\nBracket in text\n\n[points to painting], [claps], [snaps]\n\nLaughter\n\n[laughs] when in a sentence\n\n[Laughs.] when stands alone\n\n[They laugh.]\n\nNo chuckles, giggles. Do not editorialize.\n\nAffected or Imitative Speech\n\nWhen imitating a specific person use [imitating X] where X is the name of the person being imitated. Offset the words/phrase in quotes.\n\nWhen affected speech, put the affect in brackets: [in a posh British accent] or [in a Southern drawl][5]\n\nOther Sounds\n\n[cries], [whispers], [yells], [throws voice]\n\nUnintelligible/Inaudible\n\n[inaudible]\n\nTiming\n\nText should be viewable for at least three seconds.\n\nLine division on screen\n\nCaptions should not exceed more than three lines of onscreen text. One or two lines is suggested length.\n\nPlacement & timing\n\nLower third of the screen but should move if they are blocking any text or other important information.\n\nCentered\n\nIn a translucent black box\n\nArt Periods and Movements\n\nIn general, capitalize specific art movements; lowercase if the word is being used descriptively rather than referring to the specific historical period or movement.\n\nAbstract Expressionism\n\nArt Deco\n\nBaroque\n\nBeaux Arts\n\nColor Field\n\nConceptual art\n\nConstructivists\n\nCubism\n\nEarly American\n\nMinimalism\n\nModernism\n\nNeo-Geo\n\nOld Masters\n\nOp art\n\nPhotorealism\n\nPop art\n\nPostmodernism\n\nRenaissance\n\nSurrealism\n\nbut,\n\nabstract\n\ncontemporary\n\nmedieval\n\nmodern\n\nrealism\n\nIf referring to a person who is an Abstract Expressionist artist, you would capitalize the A and the E. (Example: Lee Krasner was an Abstract Expressionist painter.)"
