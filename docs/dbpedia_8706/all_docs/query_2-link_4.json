        "text": "Believe Nothing (2002) is a British sitcom written by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran. It stars Rik Mayall as Quadruple Professor Adonis Cnut, Oxford's leading moral philosopher; Michael Maloney as his faithful manservant Brian Albumen; and Emily Bruni as Dr Hannah Awkward, senior lecturer in Pedantics at Oxford University.\n\nSeries 1 (2002)\n\n[edit]\n\nGet Rich Quick [1.1]\n\n[edit]\n\nProfessor Adonis Cnut: I was trained as a Samaritan. Yes, I was. But I had to resign, unfortunately. I was so good at answering callers' problems that all the other Samaritans lost their jobs and became suicidal. There were bodies everywhere. It was very funny.\n\nApparently the Council for International Progress has just overthrown the government of China\n\nAdonis: Now you're talking!\n\nLe Fanu: I've been talking the whole time.\n\nAdonis: Are you perchance German?\n\nPrepare to Meteor Maker [1.2]\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbumen learned how to fly a balloon in Argentina\n\nAlbumen: I learned navigation, high altitude survival, how to throw political prisoners into the South Atlantic...forget I said that!\n\nAdonis: Don't mind me, dropping in unannounced.\n\nSir Richard Chutney: What are you doing here?\n\nAdonis: Dropping in unannounced. Pay attention!\n\nMight as Well Face It, You're Addicted to Fudge [1.3]\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Prime Minister has declared war on Cuba, at the suggestion of Professor Cnut\n\nAdonis: People like me are required to make strategy, whereas people like you are required to volunteer to fight and die. Where d'you think you're going?\n\nAlbumen: Volunteer to fight and die, sir!\n\nHannah: You can't let him go! I need him to make fudge, not war.\n\nThe sugar embargo is making Dr Awkward desperate for fudge\n\nAlbumen: Try and get a hold of yourself, Doctor!\n\nHannah: Don't be ridiculous! I can't possibly reach!\n\nDouble First [1.4]\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbumen gives his master a vigorous massage\n\nAdonis: I love the way you knead me...with a K, obviously!\n\nAlbumen has also been giving Hannah a massage when his master returns\n\nAdonis: Albumen, why is Dr Awkward splayed half-naked across my ottoman?\n\nAlbumen: 'Cos I couldn't persuade her to take the rest of her clothes off, Sir.\n\nInspector Aldiss: I'll be back, Cnut, you nasty little misprint!\n\nThe Unhappy Eater [1.5]\n\n[edit]\n\nA meeting with Professor Bilyas, a convicted cannibal\n\nAdonis: Edmund, when was the last time you tasted human flesh? And I don't just mean your own cuticles.\n\nBilyas: It was Christmas in the chapel. The chaplain foolishly offered me the body of Christ. I took his arm off at the elbow and had it with butter beans and a bottle of communion wine.\n\nAdonis: How would you like a constant stream of edible cellmates?\n\nBilyas: Whom might you suggest?\n\nAdonis: Ooh...Jeffrey Archer?\n\nBilyas: No. I require food I can have an intelligent conversation with first.\n\nJust a Minute [1.6]\n\n[edit]\n\nThe producer of Cnut's new TV show has been flirting with him\n\nAlbumen: I should think sexual intercourse with her is a dead cert, Sir.\n\nAdonis: Yes, but she's so shallow!\n\nAlbumen: You can tell just by looking?\n\nDr Awkward explains what a take-away is\n\nAdonis: A take-away? Who takes away what? And why?\n\nHannah: You're so out of touch! In essence, one telephones a pizza parlour, Indian restaurant, or any other so-called fast food establishment, and a youth who hasn't yet passed his motorcycle test, so is otherwise unemployable, brings tepid food right to your door.\n\nAdonis: Then why do they call it a \"take-away\", and not a \"bring-around\"?\n\nThe professor sits down to watch the recording of his TV show\n\nAnnouncer: And now on BBC Choice Gold Two, A Long History of Time, with Professor Adonis C. Nut.\n\nAdonis: Jesus C. H. Rist!\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nBelieve Nothing quotes at the Internet Movie Database"
