        "text": "We all learn in different ways and an essential part of the process of learning is gaining an understanding of ourselves and how we learn most effectively.\n\nSchooling is often an important step in our lives but the real education that makes us successful in life takes place outside the controlled environment of a classroom.\n\nI spend a lot of time reading about different approaches to education and learning. One of the more interesting schools of thought I have come across is Unschooling, which is an educational method and philosophy that advocates learner-chosen activities as a primary means for learning.\n\nWith life, society and the workplace changing so much today, I find that the philosophy of unschooling can give us insight into how we can come better self-directed learners and prepare ourselves for a future that we can’t predict.\n\nI think these “Unschooling Quotes” do an excellent job of challenging what we think education really means and exploring what kind of education is needed to be indispensable in our rapidly changing world.\n\nUnschooling Quotes:\n\n1. “Learning is creation, not consumption. Knowledge is not something a learner absorbs, but something a learner creates.” – George Couros\n\n2. “Schools are designed on the assumption that there is a secret to everything in life; that the quality of life depends upon knowing that secret; that secrets can only be known in orderly successions; and that only teachers can properly reveal these secrets. An individual with a schooled mind conceives of the world as a pyramid of classified packages accessible only to those who carry the proper tags.”\n\n– Ivan Illich\n\n3. “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn.”\n\n– Alvin Toffler\n\n4. “Our rapidly moving, information-based society badly needs people who know how to find facts rather than memorize them, and who know how to cope with change in creative ways. You don’t learn those things in school.”\n\n– Wendy Priesnitz\n\n5. “Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school. It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education. ”\n\n– Albert Einstein\n\n6. “Just as eating contrary to the inclination is injurious to the health, so study without desire spoils the memory, and it retains nothing that it takes in.”\n\n– Leonardo da Vinci\n\n7. We destroy the disinterested (I do not mean uninterested) love of learning in children, which is so strong when they are small, by encouraging and compelling them to work for petty and contemptible rewards — gold stars, or papers marked 100 and tacked to the wall, or A’s on report cards… in short, for the ignoble satisfaction of feeling that they are better than someone else…. We kill, not only their curiosity, but their feeling that it is a good and admirable thing to be curious, so that by the age of ten most of them will not ask questions, and will show a good deal of scorn for the few who do.\n\n– John Holt, How Children Fail\n\n8. “There were no sex classes. No friendship classes. No classes on how to navigate a bureaucracy, build an organization, raise money, create a database, buy a house, love a child, spot a scam, talk someone out of suicide, or figure out what was important to me. Not knowing how to do these things is what messes people up in life, not whether they know algebra or can analyze literature.”\n\n– William Upski Wimsatt\n\n9. Believe nothing merely because you have been told it . . . or because it is tradition, or because you yourselves have imagined it. Do not believe what your teacher tells you merely out of respect for the teacher. But whatsoever, after due examination and analysis, you find to be conductive to the good, the benefit, the welfare of all beings – that doctrine believe and cling to, and take it as your guide.\n\n– Gautama Buddha\n\n10. “The structure of American schooling, 20th century style, began in 1806 when Napoleon’s amateur soldiers beat the professional soldiers of Prussia at the battle of Jena. When your business is selling soldiers, losing a battle like that is serious. Almost immediately afterwards a German philosopher named Fichte delivered his famous “Address to the German Nation” which became one of the most influential documents in modern history. In effect he told the Prussian people that the party was over, that the nation would have to shape up through a new Utopian institution of forced schooling in which everyone would learn to take orders.\n\nSo the world got compulsion schooling at the end of a state bayonet for the first time in human history; modern forced schooling started in Prussia in 1819 with a clear vision of what centralized schools could deliver:\n\n1. Obedient soldiers to the army;\n\n2. Obedient workers to the mines;\n\n3. Well subordinated civil servants to government;\n\n4. Well subordinated clerks to industry\n\n5. Citizens who thought alike about major issues. “\n\n– John Taylor Gatto\n\n11. “Nothing bothers me more than when people criticize my criticism of school by telling me that schools are not just places to learn maths and spelling, they are places where children learn a vaguely defined thing called socialization. I know. I think schools generally do an effective and terribly damaging job of teaching children to be infantile, dependent, intellectually dishonest, passive and disrespectful to their own developmental capacities.”\n\n– Seymour Papert\n\n12. “The condition of alienation, of being asleep, of being unconscious, of being out of one’s mind, is the condition of the normal man. Society highly values its normal man. It educates children to lose themselves and to become absurd, and thus to be normal.”\n\n– R.D. Laing\n\n13. “Think of the things killing us as a nation: narcotic drugs, brainless competition, dishonesty, greed, recreational sex, the pornography of violence, gambling, alcohol, and — the worst pornography of all — lives devoted to buying things, accumulation as a philosophy. All of these are addictions of dependent personalities. That is what our brand of schooling must inevitably produce. A large fraction of our total economy has grown up around providing service and counseling to inadequate people, and inadequate people are the main product of government compulsion schools.”\n\n– John Taylor Gatto\n\n14. “The function of high school, then, is not so much to communicate knowledge as to oblige children finally to accept the grading system as a measure of their inner excellence. And a function of the self-destructive process in American children is to make them willing to accept not their own, but a variety of other standards, like a grading system, for measuring themselves. It is thus apparent that the way American culture is now integrated it would fall apart if it did not engender feelings of inferiority and worthlessness.”\n\n– Jules Henry\n\n15. “To develop a complete mind: study the science of art; study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else.’\n\n– Leonardo da Vinci\n\n16. “There is no neutral education. Education is either for domestication or for freedom.”\n\n– Joao Coutinho\n\n17. “All I am saying can be summed up in two words: Trust Children. Nothing could be more simple, or more difficult. Difficult because to trust children we must first learn to trust ourselves, and most of us were taught as children that we could not be trusted.”\n\n– John Holt\n\n18. “If we taught babies to talk as most skills are taught in school, they would memorize lists of sounds in a predetermined order and practice them alone in a closet.”\n\n– Linda Darling-Hammond\n\n19. “Education itself is a putting off, a postponement; we are told to work hard to get good results. Why? So we can get a good job. What is a good job? One that pays well. Oh. And that’s it? All this suffering, merely so that we can earn a lot of money, which, even if we manage it, will not solve our problems anyway? It’s a tragically limited idea of what life is all about.”\n\n– Tom Hodgkinson\n\n20. “Learning is not the product of teaching. Learning is the product of the activity of learners.”\n\n– John Holt\n\n21. “Do not train children in learning by force and harshness, but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.”\n\n– Plato\n\n22. “Public education reflects our society’s paternalistic, hierarchical worldview, which exploits children in the same way it takes the earth’s resources for granted.”\n\n– Wendy Priesnitz\n\n23. “The whole educational and professional training system is a very elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too independent, and who think for themselves, and who don’t know how to be submissive, and so on – because they’re dysfunctional to the institutions.”\n\n– Noam Chomsky\n\n24. “Because schools suffocate children’s hunger to learn, learning appears to be difficult and we assume that children must be externally motivated to do it. As a society, we must own up to the damage we do to our children…in our families and in our schools. We must also be willing to make the sweeping changes in our institutions, public policies and personal lives that are necessary to reverse that harm to our children and to our society.”\n\n– Wendy Priesnitz\n\n25. What is the purpose of industrial education? To fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence? Nothing could be further from the truth. The aim is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. That is its aim in the United States and that is its aim everywhere else.\n\n– H. L. Mencken\n\n26. “In the end, the secret to learning is so simple: forget about it. Think only about whatever you love. Follow it, do it, dream about it. One day, you will glance up at your collection of Japanese literature, or trip over the solar oven you built, and it will hit you: learning was there all the time, happening by itself.”\n\n– Grace Llewellyn\n\n27. “I’ve concluded that genius is as common as dirt. We suppress our genius only because we haven’t yet figured out how to manage a population of educated men and women. The solution, I think, is simple and glorious. Let them manage themselves.”\n\n– John Taylor Gatto\n\n28. “The anxiety children feel at constantly being tested, their fear of failure, punishment, and disgrace, severely reduces their ability both to perceive and to remember, and drives them away from the material being studied into strategies for fooling teachers into thinking they know what they really don’t know.”\n\n– John Holt\n\n29. “Traditional education focuses on teaching, not learning. It incorrectly assumes that for every ounce of teaching there is an ounce of learning by those who are taught. However, most of what we learn before, during, and after attending schools is learned without its being taught to us. A child learns such fundamental things as how to walk, talk, eat, dress, and so on without being taught these things. Adults learn most of what they use at work or at leisure while at work or leisure. Most of what is taught in classroom settings is forgotten, and much or what is remembered is irrelevant.”\n\n– Russell Ackoff in The Objective of Education Is Learning, Not Teaching\n\n30. “Educators – like musicians, journalists, carmakers, and bankers before them – won’t know what hit them. But as sure as change is overtaking every other sector of society, it will overtake education – as well it should. Our cookie-cutter, one-pace-fits-all, test-focused system is not up to the task of teaching the creators of the new Googles.\n\nCall me a utopian but I imagine a new educational ecology where students may take courses from anywhere and instructors may select any students, where courses are collaborative and public, where creativity is nurtured as Google nurtures it, where making mistakes well is valued over sameness and safety, where education continues long past age 21, where tests and degrees matter less than one’s own portfolio of work, where the gift economy may turn anyone with knowledge into teachers, where the skills of research and reasoning and skepticism are valued over the skills of memorization and calculation, and where universities teach an abundance of knowledge to those who want it rather than manage a scarcity of seats in a class.”\n\n– Jeff Jarvis in Hacking Education\n\n31. “I am beginning to suspect all elaborate and special systems of education. They seem to me to be built upon the supposition that every child is a kind of idiot who must be taught to think. Whereas, if the child is left to himself, he will think more and better, if less showily. Let him go and come freely, let him touch real things and combine his impressions for himself, instead of sitting indoors at a little round table, while a sweet-voiced teacher suggests that he build a stone wall with his wooden blocks, or make a rainbow out of strips of coloured paper, or plant straw trees in bead flower-pots. Such teaching fills the mind with artificial associations that must be got rid of, before the child can develop independent ideas out of actual experience.”\n\n– Anne Sullivan, Helen Keller’s Teacher\n\n32. “As technology advances, it reverses the characteristics of every situation again and again. The age of automation is going to be the age of ‘do it yourself.’”\n\n– Marshall McLuhan\n\n33. “I imagine a school system that recognizes learning is natural, that a love of learning is normal, and that real learning is passionate learning. A school curriculum that values questions above answers…creativity above fact regurgitation…individuality above conformity.. and excellence above standardized performance….. And we must reject all notions of ‘reform’ that serve up more of the same: more testing, more ‘standards’, more uniformity, more conformity, more bureaucracy.”\n\n– Tom Peter, “Re-Imagine”\n\n34. “School is the advertising agency which makes you believe that you need the society as it is.”\n\n– Ivan Illich\n\n35. ”Life can only be understood backwards but you have to live it forward. You can only do that by stepping into uncertainty and by trying, within this uncertainty, to create your own islands of security….The new security will be a belief that …if this doesn’t work out you could do something else. You are your own security.”\n\n– Charles Handy\n\n36. “Our large schools are organized like a factory of the late 19th century: top down, command control management, a system designed to stifle creativity and independent judgment.’\n\n– David T Kearns, CEO Xerox\n\n37. ‘There is, it seems, more concern about whether children learn the mechanics of reading and writing than grow to love reading and writing; learn about democracy than have practice in democracy; hear about knowledge… rather than gain experience in personally constructing knowledge… see the world narrowly, simple and ordered, rather than broad complex and uncertain’.\n\n– Vitto Perrone, ‘Letter to Teachers’\n\n38. Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.\n\n– Oscar Wilde\n\n39. “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.”\n\n– Pablo Picasso\n\n40. “The uncreative mind can spot wrong answers, but it takes a creative mind to spot a wrong question.”\n\n– Anthony Jay\n\n41. Spoon feeding in the long run teaches us nothing but the shape of the spoon.\n\n– Edward M. Forster\n\n42. “Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.”\n\n― Isaac Asimov\n\n43. “Through the power of self-education you can be anything you want to be or do anything you want to do. Self-education power does not require money, fixed time or fixed life style. Options are extremely flexible. Rewards are unlimited. You can control your destiny.”\n\n– Bob Webb\n\n44. “I am concerned that too many people are focused too much on money and not on their greatest wealth, which is their education. If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer through the changes. If they think money will solve the problems, I am afraid those people will have a rough ride. Intelligence solves problems and produces money. Money without financial intelligence is money soon gone.”\n\n– Robert Kiyosaki\n\n45. “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether this happens at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps on learning not only remains young, but becomes constantly more valuable regardless of physical capacity.”\n\n– Harvey Ullman\n\n46. “The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.”\n\n– Abraham Lincoln\n\n47. “Leaders are not, as we are often led to think, people who go along with huge crowds following them. Leaders are people who go their own way without caring, or even looking to see, whether anyone is following them. “Leadership qualities” are not the qualities that enable people to attract followers, but those that enable them to do without them. They include, at the very least, courage, endurance, patience, humor, flexibility, resourcefulness, stubbornness, a keen sense of reality, and the ability to keep a cool and clear head, even when things are going badly. True leaders, in short, do not make people into followers, but into other leaders.”\n\n– John Holt\n\n48. “Actually, all education is self-education. A teacher is only a guide, to point out the way, and no school, no matter how excellent, can give you education. What you receive is like the outlines in a child’s coloring book. You must fill in the colors yourself.”\n\n– Louis L’Amour\n\n49. “Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune.”\n\n– Jim Rohn\n\n50. “The idea that the majority of students attend a university for an education independent of the degree and grades is a hypocrisy everyone is happier not to expose. Occasionally some students do arrive for an education but rote and mechanical nature of the institution soon converts them to a less idealic attitude”\n\n– Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\n51. Standardized testing is at cross purposes with many of the most important purposes of public education. It doesn’t measure big-picture learning, critical thinking, perseverance, problem solving, creativity or curiosity, yet those are the qualities great teaching brings out in a student.\n\n– Randi Weingarten\n\n52. What we call education and culture is for the most part nothing but the substitution of reading for experience, of literature for life, of the obsolete fictitious for the contemporary real.\n\n– George Bernard Shaw\n\n53. “The school system, custodian of print culture, has no place for the rugged individual. It is, indeed, the homogenizing hopper into which we toss our integral tots for processing.”\n\n– Marshall McLuhan\n\n54. It is among the commonplaces of education that we often first cut off the living root and then try to replace its natural functions by artificial means. Thus we suppress the child’s curiosity and then when he lacks a natural interest in learning he is offered special coaching for his scholastic difficulties.\n\n– Alice Duer Miller\n\n55. Since every effort in our educational life seems to be directed toward making of the child a being foreign to itself, it must of necessity produce individuals foreign to one another, and in everlasting antagonism with each other.\n\n– Emma Goldman\n\n56. Our Age of Anxiety is, in great part, the result of trying to do today’s jobs with yesterday’s tools.\n\n– Marshall McLuhan\n\n57. If our schools are still bad maybe we should declare educational bankruptcy, give the people their money and let them educate themselves and start their own schools.\n\n– William John Bennett\n\n58. Much that passes for education is not education at all but ritual. The fact is that we are being educated when we know it least.\n\n– David P. Gardner\n\n59. I do not teach anyone I only provide the environment in which they can learn.\n\n– Albert Einstein\n\n60. It is our American habit, if we find the foundations of our educational structure unsatisfactory, to add another story or a wing.\n\n– John Dewey\n\n61. Reward and punishment is the lowest form of education.\n\n– Chuang Tzu\n\n62. Knowledge that is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.\n\n– Plato\n\n63. Education is a method whereby one acquires a higher grade of prejudices.\n\n– Laurence J. Peter\n\n64. It doesn’t make much difference what you study, so long as you don’t like it.\n\n– Finley Peter Dunne\n\n65. I remember that I was never able to get along at school. I was at the foot of the class.\n\n– Thomas Edison\n\n66. The “real world” that parents worry unschooling kids won’t be able to cope with is not the “real world” of the future; it’s one designed to churn out obedient workers and consumers. But times – and the economy — are changing.\n\n– Wendy Priesnitz\n\n67. Learning of the highest value extends well beyond measurable dimension. It can’t be fit into any curriculum or evaluated by any test. It is activated by experiences which develop our humanity. It teaches us to be our best selves.\n\n– Laura Grace Weldon\n\n68. Children are born passionately eager to make as much sense as they can of things around them. If we attempt to control, manipulate, or divert this process… the independent scientist in the child disappears.”\n\n– John Holt\n\n69. Education is a natural process carried out by the child and is not acquired by listening to words but by experiences in the environment.\n\n– Dr. Maria Montessori\n\n70. Our job is obvious: we need to get out of the way, shine a light, and empower a new generation to teach itself and to go further and faster than any generation ever has.\n\n– Seth Godin\n\n71. Home-based education is not an experiment. It’s how people learned to function in the world for centuries. And there is no reason to think people today can’t do the same thing. School is the experiment… And that experiment is in trouble.\n\n– Wendy Priesnitz\n\n72. The old system where every child who locked away and set into nonstop, daily cutthroat competition with every other child for silly prizes called grades is broken beyond repair. If it could be fixed it could have been fixed by now.\n\n– John Taylor Gatto\n\n73. Schools have not necessarily much to do with education… they are mainly institutions of control where certain basic habits must be inculcated in the young. Education is quite different and has little place in school.\n\n– Winston Churchill\n\n73. Kids who are in school just visit life sometimes and then they have to stop to do homework or go to sleep early or get to school on time. They’re constantly reminded they are preparing for real life. While being isolated from it.\n\n– Sandra Dodd\n\n74. It is as true now as it was then that no matter what tests show, very little of what is taught in school is learned, very little of what is learned is remembered, and very little of what is remembered is used. The things we learn, remember, and use are the things we seek out or meet in the daily, serious, nonschool part of our lives.\n\n– John Holt\n\n75. What makes people smart, curious, alert, observant, competent, confident, resourceful, persistent – in the broadest and best sense, intelligent – is not having access to more and more learning places, resources and specialists, but being able in their lives to do a wide variety of interesting things that matter, things that challenge their ingenuity, skill, and judgement, and that make an obvious difference in their lives and the lives of the people around them.\n\n– John Holt\n\n76. Persons grouped around a fire or candle for warmth or light are less able to pursue independent thoughts, or even tasks, than people supplied with electric light. In the same way, the social and educational patterns latent in automation are those of self-employment and artistic autonomy.\n\n– Marshall McLuhan\n\n77. “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will spend its whole life believing that it is stupid.”\n\n– Albert Einstein\n\n78. What does education often do? It makes a straight-cut ditch of a free, meandering brook.\n\n– Henry David Thoreau\n\n79. ”Educating the masses was intended only to improve the relationship between the top and the bottom of society. Not for changing the nature of the relationship.”\n\n– John Ralston Paul, “Voltaire’s Bastards”\n\n80. “A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding.”\n\n– Marshall McLuhan\n\n81. “People don’t want children to know what they need to know. They want their kids to know what they ought to need to know. If you’re a teacher you’re in a constant battle with mildly deluded adults who think the world will get better if you imagine it is better. You want to teach about sex? Fine, but only when they’re old enough to do it. You want to talk politics? Sure, but nothing modern. Religion? So long as you don’t actually think about it. Otherwise some furious mob will come to your house and burn you for a witch.”\n\n― Nick Harkaway\n\n82. “We stigmatize mistakes. And we’re now running national educational systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make — and the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities.”\n\n― Ken Robinson\n\n83. “Grades really cover up failure to teach. A bad instructor can go through an entire quarter leaving absolutely nothing memorable in the minds of his class, curve out the scores on an irrelevant test, and leave the impression that some have learned and some have not. But if the grades are removed the class is forced to wonder each day what it’s really learning. The questions, What’s being taught? What’s the goal? How do the lectures and assignments accomplish the goal? become ominous. The removal of grades exposes a huge and frightening vacuum.”\n\n― Robert M. Pirsig, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\n\n84. “The fact is, we need prisons that are more like schools, and schools that are less like prisons. But for this to happen, the teachers also need freedom.”\n\n― Salvatore Striano\n\n85. Believe nothing merely because you have been told it . . . or because it is tradition, or because you yourselves have imagined it. Do not believe what your teacher tells you merely out of respect for the teacher. But whatsoever, after due examination and analysis, you find to be conductive to the good, the benefit, the welfare of all beings – that doctrine believe and cling to, and take it as your guide.\n\n– Gautama Buddha\n\n86. “School exams are memory tests, in real-world no one is going to stop you from referring a book to solve a problem.”\n\n― Amit Kalantri\n\n87. “Our large schools are organized like a factory of the late 19th century: top down, command control management, a system designed to stifle creativity and independent judgment.’\n\n― David T Kearns, CEO Xerox\n\n88. “It is… nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreak and ruin. It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.”\n\n― Albert Einstein\n\n89. “Creativity is a type of learning process where the teacher and pupil are located in the same individual.”\n\n― Arthur Koestler\n\n90. “If we value independence, if we are disturbed by the growing conformity of knowledge, of values, of attitudes, which our present system induces, then we may wish to set up conditions of learning which make for uniqueness, for self-direction, and for self-initiated learning.”\n\n― Carl Rogers\n\n91. “Homeschooling is an act of liberation and an act of passion. It is an occasion to walk away from institutional images of life and to embrace a vision that is filled with personal meaning and unmistakable truths for our families. The quality of awareness that comes from the heart is more dependable… Homeschooling… is about helping make it possible for children to reach maturity with healthy, curious, fully conscious minds.”\n\n― Earl Gary Stevens\n\n92. “Public school–where the human mind is drilled and manipulated into submission to various social and moral spooks, and thus fitted to continue our system of exploitation and oppression.”\n\n― Emma Goldman\n\n93. “What we call education and culture is for the most part nothing but the substitution of reading for experience, of literature for life, of the obsolete fictitious for the contemporary real.”\n\n― George Bernard Shaw\n\n94. “The act of placing the power over learning and life into the individual’s hands is both empowering and motivating. The ‘motivation’ people see in unschoolers is really a joy in learning that is seen far less often among the masses in school.”\n\n― Idzie Desmarais\n\n95. “School prepares for the alienating institutionalization of life by teaching the need to be taught.”\n\n― Ivan Illich\n\n96. “Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society…But for me, education means making creators…You have to make inventors, innovators, not conformists.”\n\n― Jean Piaget\n\n97. “A prison, according to the common, general definition is any place of involuntary confinement and restriction of liberty. In school, as in adult prisons, the inmates are told exactly what they must do and are punished for failure to comply. Actually, students in school must spend more time doing exactly what they are told to do than is true of adults in penal institutions. Another difference, of course, is that we put adults in prison because they have committed a crime, while we put children in school because of their age.\n\n― Peter Gray\n\n98. “I think the big mistake in schools is trying to teach children anything, and by using fear as the basic motivation. Fear of getting failing grades, fear of not staying with your class, etc. Interest can produce learning on a scale compared to fear as a nuclear explosion to a firecracker.”\n\n― Stanley Kubrik\n\n99. “People will always try to stop you from doing the right thing if it is unconventional.”\n\n― Warren Buffett\n\n100. “The fact is that given the challenges we face, education doesn’t need to be reformed — it needs to be transformed. The key to this transformation is not to standardize education, but to personalize it, to build achievement on discovering the individual talents of each child, to put students in an environment where they want to learn and where they can naturally discover their true passions.”\n\n― Ken Robinson\n\n101. “In times of change, learners inherit the earth, while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.” – Eric Hoffer"
