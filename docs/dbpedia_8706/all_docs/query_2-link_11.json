        "text": "The idea of VCE English assessments can sometimes be a bit daunting. Always so much you want to write, never as much time as you need and they always seem to come around sooner than you think. But there is never as much cause for alarm as you think and Iâm willing to guarantee that almost everyone reading this is so much better than they think at English.Â\n\nYouâve already come so far from where you started in your high school English journey. Iâd like to challenge anyone reading this to go and find the earliest English essay youâve got tucked away somewhere. Iâve done this myself and, if yours is anything like mine, youâll be almost disgusted by what you find. Year-7-me just loved to retell the story, cling to my rigid TEEL formulas and leave my quotes just dangling, write the same basic paragraph three times and call it a complete essay. Not a pretty read and Iâm sure a couple of you can relate. But, this exercise does at least prove a very valuable point: you are capable of improving at English.\n\nSo letâs start thinking about that essay youâve got coming up again. Youâve just given yourself a nice confidence booster with that walk down memory lane, reminding yourself that you are a more-than-capable English student these days. But all you now want to do is your very best for this next essay. But how do you keep improving between now and then? After all, if you knew what you had to do to improve your English, youâd already be doing it, right? So what weâre going to do now is to have a look at what taking your essays to that next level really looks like; how you can improve your writing between now and then, whenever that might be.Â\n\nSo to do this, weâre going to take an already good paragraph and improve it together. Take this one, one that I conveniently prepared earlier to a Station Eleven prompt that has to do with the theme of memory/history.\n\nPart 1: The Good Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating such an enduring legacy for a character who believes in the power of such legacies - 'theyâre all immortal to me' - Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment by preserving these legacies. Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of legacies to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Even though Mirandaâs life is left incomplete by her sudden death, the beauty in the scene of her death suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters: 'its extravagant sunsets and its indigo sea'. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the value of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nLetâs call this our good paragraph. Iâve modelled this off of an essay I found from my Year 10 self, as happy as Year-10-me would have been with this performance, itâs far from perfect. But, it is a very functional paragraph that does all that a paragraph really needs to do. It introduces an idea, justifies it with evidence, links back at the end and doesnât waste too much time retelling the story. So now we get to the fun bit: weâre going to take this already good paragraph, and turn it into a better paragraph.\n\nSo how do we make a good paragraph better?Â\n\nWell, for a start, we can integrate our quotes so that the paragraph reads better. Youâll see in just a second how much of a difference this can make. This is something I learnt to do between Years 10 and 11. Other improvements that could be made include answering the prompt more directly and using some of the language of the prompt within our answers. So letâs change this and see now what these small differences do to our paragraph.\n\nPart 2: The Better Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: In Station Eleven, the characters often find meaning from the creation of enduring legacies that allow others to remember the individuals who came before. Mandel demonstrates this idea through the naming of Jeevanâs son after his brother, Frank. By creating this symbolic memorial for a character who believes that such legacies can allow individuals such as actors to become 'immortal', Mandel implies that characters like this are able to achieve meaning and fulfilment through their legacies. Furthermore, Mandel also uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy through oneâs art to provide meaning where Miranda lacks it in her day-to-day life. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, the meaning in her life comes from the legacy that she creates from the art she makes in her 'independent' life. This is contrasted against the character of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world, because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, implying less fulfilment in his life. Therefore, Mandel uses her text to demonstrate the importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past.\n\nThere we have it. The paragraph has been rewritten based on the ones I wrote in Year 11 and we have the first signs of improvement. The topic sentence now references the âremembering the pastâ aspect of the prompt. The linking sentence now uses the âimportanceâ part of the prompt. All of the same quotes are used but are now integrated (check out How To Embed Quotes in Your Essay Like a Boss if you need more help with this).Â\n\nWeâve made sure not to have more than one sentence starting with Mandel (a small nitpick but still a nice addition). It flows better. It answers the prompt more directly and suddenly we have a better paragraph. Year-11-me has shown improvement and with this comes better scores and more confidence: something thatâs very important for success in English. If youâre confident and proud of what youâre writing, then youâll have higher marks and, even better, more fun!\n\nWe havenât changed much and the paragraph is already better. But itâs not my best paragraph. Between Years 11 and 12, I learnt even more things. I was taught to write about not only the world of the text but also the world around us that we and Mandel live in: youâll notice that this better paragraph talks more about âcharactersâ that live âin the textâ whereas my best paragraph would talk more about the text in the context of the world you and I live in. I learnt to make my topic sentences more abstract and broad so that they relate more to our own world and less to the world of the text and remind whoeverâs assessing that my ideas apply to everyone and not just within the texts. I learnt to respond more directly to different types of prompts (Discuss, To what extent is this true?, How does Mandelâ¦ and others) and I learnt to be more direct in discussing the views and values of Mandel (what she likes, what she doesnât like, what she wants to see more of in the world)\n\nSo letâs apply some final changes, and see what our paragraph looks after two more years of refining English. This final paragraph is almost exactly the same as one I wrote in timed conditions before my final exam.\n\nThe Final Part: The Best Paragraph\n\nQ: Mandel shows the importance of remembering the past. To what extent is this true?\n\nA: Mandel explores the importance of legacies, not only as sources of meaning for their creators, but also for their roles in allowing others to remember the roles of those who came before. Such an idea is explored through the naming of Jeevanâs son, securing the legacy of Frank. By affording such a permeating influence to an individual who writes of and appreciates the 'immortal[ity]' of long-dead actors, Mandel implies that an appreciation of the inherent value in a legacy and its ability to influence future events is a key quality in individuals. Furthermore, Mandel uses the character of Miranda to highlight the importance of creating a legacy that outlives oneself to provide meaning. Although abruptly killed off in the middle of the text, Mandel imbues her death with a certain beauty through its 'extravagant sunsets and indigo sea'. In doing so, Mandel provides a sense of completion about Mirandaâs life and suggests that a sense of fulfilment has been achieved despite the emptiness of her life relative to other characters. Hence, Mandel suggests that the meaning in Mirandaâs life comes from the legacy that is the art she makes in her 'independent' life that continues to influence events and allow others to remember the past long after her death. Mandel provides contrast through her exploration of Arthur, whose legacy does not influence any events in the post-flu world because of his failure to create legacy or meaning beyond his day-to-day life. Further, Arthurâs death in the hectic Elgin Theatre has far less beauty than that of Miranda, reinforcing Mandelâs view that individuals who forfeit control of their own legacies, as Arthur does, lead far less completed and fulfilled lives. Therefore, Mandel highlights the immense importance of creating legacies that allow others to remember the past and encourages greater appreciation of the value of legacies in contemporary society.\n\nSo, two years later, and weâve got what is still essentially the same paragraph, just brushed up to an even better, or best, standard. So if weâre using the same evidence, exploring the same characters and introducing the same ideas, why is this paragraph better than the last two?Â\n\nWell, if you study the topic and linking sentences, they discuss the concept of a legacy being a means of allowing others to remember the past and the importance of such a thing and everything in-between links this concept to the text. 'Mandel highlights the immense importance' represents a subtle but nice nod to the wording of the prompt by giving an âextentâ to which Mandel âshowsâ or highlights. Every piece of evidence is discussed in reference to what Mandel believes about the world around us and how individuals should act in modern society.Â\n\nAnd thereâs something very nice that we can now reflect on. This paragraph has gone from good to much better without having to introduce any new ideas. There are no overly complex interpretations of the text, weâve just taken the same skeleton of a paragraph and made it look better without changing its real substance.Â\n\nAnd one of the wonderful things about making efforts to improve the quality of your writing is all the confidence that comes with this, whether this be from getting better at discussing views and values, learning to integrate your quotes or any achievement like this. I know that my confidence surged as my English got better and, as I got more confidence in my writing, I got more confidence in what I wrote about. My interpretations of the text became more and more obscure and a bit whacky at times and I had fun writing about these things. If you improve your writing, youâll improve what youâre writing about which will mean youâll have more fun writing and the cycle of improvement will just continue.Â\n\nSo to cap off, I thought it might be nice to have a checklist of sorts that you might be able to put against your own writing.\n\nWhatâs the next step I could take in improving my English?\n\nAre all my quotes properly integrated? (Hint: if the sentence doesnât make sense without quotation marks, the answer is no)\n\nHave I got more than a couple of sentences starting the same way or could I vary my sentence structure a bit more?\n\nHave I explicitly used some parts of the prompt in my own writing so that I can directly answer the question in my essays?\n\nAm I writing about both the world of the text and the world we live in outside of the text instead of just the characters and relationships within the text?\n\nAre my topic and linking sentences describing a concept that relates to the prompt with everything in-between relating this concept to the text? (I found this a very useful way of thinking of paragraphs)\n\nIs all of my evidence being discussed in relation to the views of the author?\n\nDoes my essay/paragraph explain what the author would like to see more of/less of in modern society based on what is explored in the text?\n\nIs my essay/paragraph specific to the exact wording and type of prompt?\n\nAnd these are just some of the improvements that could be made. Iâm sure each of you could ask teachers and past students and find many, many more tips on improvement. Just as long as youâre thinking about what the next step in your English might be, then youâre already headed in the right direction. So good luck and happy writing!\n\nThe Erratics is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nâSetting is a literary element that refers to the context of where a story takes place, usually alluding to the time and location. Your expectations of a story that takes place in Victorian England would differ greatly from a story set in late 2000s Australia, showing us that the historical, social and geographical aspects of the setting shape the meaning of the text.\n\nIn the memoir The Erratics, the setting plays a vital role in Vicki Laveau-Harvie's storytelling. From the beginning of the novel, Laveau-Harvie uses both the title and prologue to foreground the importance of the Okotoks Erratic (a geographical phenomenon in Alberta, Canada) to establish the role that place and belonging have played in her life. Further reinforcing the importance of the setting, the memoirâs narrative follows Laveau-Harvieâs experience flying back to Alberta, Canada (her hometown), after having moved to and started a new life in Australia.Â\n\nWhy Focus on Setting When Writing a Text Response?\n\nThe setting can be useful evidence to have in your repertoire as it helps you show that you not only have an understanding of the ideas of the text but also how those ideas are constructed. When looking at the criteria you will be marked against in the end-of-year exam you will see that to score a 7 and above in Section A you need to consider the âconstructionâ of the text (read more here). Construction refers to your ability to discuss the parts that make up a text through the use of metalanguage as evidence to support your views. The setting is just one of the ways you can address construction in The Erratics, but, as a text so focused on physical environments, itâs a good type of metalanguage to start with.\n\nCanada\n\nFamous for producing Justin Bieber and maple syrup, Canada has a similar history to Australia. Canada has an Indigenous population who inhabited the land for thousands of years before British and French expeditions came and colonised the land. In the 1700s, due to various conflicts, France ceded most of its North American colonies while the United Kingdom stayed. Over time the country gained greater autonomy and, like Australia, it is now a constitutional monarchy with a prime minister but recognises the British royal family as its sovereign. Further mirroring Australia, Canada also has a colonial past that it is still reckoning with as recent headlines about the human remains of hundreds of Indigenous people at a residential school reminds us.Â\n\nVicki is specifically from Alberta, and the majority of the novel is about her experiences returning there after having moved to Australia (at the start of the memoir she had been estranged from her parents for 18 years). Known for its natural beauty and its nature reserves, Alberta is a part of Western Canada. Alberta is one of only two landlocked provinces in Canada which is interesting considering that Vicki leaves it for a country famous for its beaches and coastal cities.Â\n\nWhen annotating the text, highlight the descriptions of the setting. Youâll notice that whenÂ Laveau-Harvie describes Alberta or Canada as a whole she presents the country as being dangerous and hostile. An example of this is the blunt statement that the âcold will kill you. Nothing personalâ. However, Laveau-Harvie does find some solace in the landscape, observing the beauty of the âopalescentâ peaks and the comfort in predictable seasons.Â\n\nVickiâs Parentâs Home\n\nThe first description Laveau-Harvie gives us of her family home is to call it âParadise, [with] twenty acres with a ranch house on a rise, nothing between you and the sky and the distant mountains.â The idyllic image foregrounds the natural landscape but is then immediately juxtaposed with the description of the home as a âtime-capsule house sealed against the outside world for a decadeâ. This description heightens Vickiâs mother and fatherâs isolation from the outside world and alludes to the hostility of the home that is reaffirmed with the doors that âopen to no oneâ. The family home becomes an extended metaphor for Vickiâs parents themselves, with the description of it as a âno-go zoneâ, hinting at the sistersâ estrangement from their parents who have shut them out.Â\n\nMoreover, the land the house sits on does not produce any crops despite it being such a large expanse of land, heightening the homeâs disconnect from the natural world. This detachment from the natural world is furthered by her labelling her parents as âtransplants from the cityâ and contrasting them to locals who âstill make preserves in the summerâ. Vickiâs mother in particular is at odds with nature due to materialism, such as her wardrobes being full of fur coats.\n\nThe Erratics + Napi\n\nIn the prologue we are introduced to the Okotoks Erratic as being situated in âa landscape of uncommon beautyâ with the Erratic itself being something that âdominates the landscape, roped off and isolated, the danger it presents to anyone trespassing palpableâ. The memoir then immediately shifts to Vickiâs experience in the hospital trying to convince the staff that she is her motherâs daughter, drawing a parallel between the dominating and dangerous landscape to the dominating and dangerous mother. In the memoir, the Erratic is an extended metaphor for the mother with both the land and the mother being described as âunsafeâ, âdominat[ing]â and a âdangerâ. Moreover, the structural choice of opening the novel with the Erratic makes its presence felt throughout the novel even though it is not mentioned again until the end of the text.Â\n\nIn contrast to the prologue, the epilogue has a feeling of peace and reconciliation as the mother and what she has represented to her family is reconciled with the landscape. This is particularly pertinent as the geographical and spiritual origins of the rock revealed in the epilogue is a story of stability after a rupture. This alludes to the ability of Vickiâs family to heal after the trauma inflicted on them by the mother. The epilogue could also be understood as a reminder of humanity's insignificance in the face of nature and larger forces, as represented by Napi.\n\nWhile Laveau-Harvie does not directly address Canada's colonial past in her memoir outside of the inclusion of Napi, the colonial presence is felt throughout the memoir through the setting of both Australia and Canada. These settings allude to how living on stolen land means that while individuals - particularly middle-class, white individuals - may not always recognise and address the colonial history of the land they live on, the fact that land was never ceded is still felt.Â\n\nAustralia\n\nAs discussed before, Canada and Australia are similar as they are both former British colonies that are now constitutional monarchies, so why would Vicki want to move to a place that is similar to where she already lived and experienced trauma?Â\n\nThere are a few potential answers, the first being the geographical distance. There are over 1300kms between Sydney and Alberta and, considering the trauma Vicki and her sister have experienced, it stands to reason that she would want to put distance between her childhood home and her adult life. This leads to the second reason, travelling to âFar flung placesâ as a method to deal with trauma. While in Canada, Vicki reminisces about the âboozed-up Brits on Bondiâ that embodies her life in Australia. The evocative, alliterative image creates a stark contrast between warm and carefree Australia and cold and emotionally taxing Canada, reinforcing how travelling provides individuals with a means to survive their traumatic childhoods and create new lives for themselves.Â\n\nWhen writing about setting you do not need to be an expert in geography. As this blog post has shown, to understand Laveau-Harvieâs use of setting in The Erratics you only need to know about two countries, so next time you write a text response, consider using your understanding of setting to show your teacher or examiners that youâve thought about the textâs construction.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to dive deeper into this text, Zac breaks down key themes and quotes in The Erratics over on this blog.\n\nBackground\n\nMontana 1948 is narrated by David Hayden, now a middle-aged history teacher, reflecting on the summer of 1948 that changed his entire life.\n\nIt begins with David noticing that his Native American babysitter, Marie Little Soldier is unwell. Gail and Wesley, Davidâs parents, attempt to enlist the help of Wesleyâs brother Frank, a well-respected doctor in the community. However, Marie reacts to this idea with fear, anxiety and resistance. Gail concludes that something sinister must be happening for her to have such a reaction and she presses Marie for why she is so afraid. Marie then reveals to Gail that she has heard that Dr Frank has been sexually abusing many of his female Native American patients. Gail immediately confides in Wesley who is both the Sheriff of their town and Frankâs brother. This becomes the central source of tension, as Wes must decide between his duty as the Sheriff and his loyalty to his family.\n\nThis is all told from the perspective of David, our protagonist, who has to watch his father confront his Uncle Frank about these taboo accusations. Eventually, it seems they reach an agreement with Frank to stop the abuse.\n\nMarie is discovered dead the next day in her bed when Gail goes to check up on her. Later that night, David admits to his parents that he saw Frank go into their home in the afternoon and immediately, Wesley concludes that Frank âis guilty as sinâ for murdering Marie. As the Sheriff of the town, Wesley is obligated to arrest Frank, but in order to spare Frank the embarrassment, he keeps Frank in their basement instead of sending him to jail. Â\n\nUpon hearing this news, Davidâs grandfather, Julian, orders Wesley to release Frank. Julian accuses Wesley of arresting him out of jealousy and he threatens to use his power within the community to set Frank free. At this point, Wesley realises that the power of his father would only be matched by the law, and he decides that he must officially prosecute his brother.\n\nThat next day, David, Wes and Gail wake up to find Frank dead, having used broken glass to slit his wrists and commit suicide. Young David believes that this was the right action and hopes that everything would go back to normal. But as the story goes, this is not the case.\n\nThemes\n\nPrejudice, discrimination and the abuse of power\n\nAnother key theme is prejudice, discrimination and the abuse of power. Frankâs abuse of the Native American women is both an abuse of his power and responsibilities as a Doctor and a way to take advantage of his personal belief in White âracial superiority.â Julian and Frank embody the toxic, violent and bigoted mentality prevalent during that time period, which Watson deplores as reprimandable and unacceptable. Even at the novelâs close, Frankâs death is symbolic in two ways. Firstly, it means that Frank managed to escape persecution, public denouncement and jail time. But more importantly, he is still revered in the community as a ârespected manâ and a âwar hero. '' Therefore, while he physically passes away, his âlegacyâ and faÃ§ade of heroism remains alive.\n\nLaw vs Justice\n\nOne of the central themes of âMontana 1948â is the conflict between abiding by the law and doing what is just. Due to the institutionalised racism that existed in the 1940âs, Frankâs actions were not considered technically illegal, however, by intuitive standards of morality, his rape of Natives in his practice and his subsequent murder of Marie clearly warrant punishment. Thus, Watson touches on the failures of the judicial system to consistently hand out judgements that are morally fair and instead reveals the flaws within the legal system of the time that reflect widespread and corrupt social attitudes.\n\nLoyalty vs Morality\n\nWatson also touches on the conflict between loyalty and morality. This, as we know, forms the crux of narrativeâs tension. Should Wes arrest and prosecute his brother Frank or not? Should he stay loyal to his family or uphold the moral values that he must stand by as the towns Sheriff? Gail, Davidâs mother, embodies all the virtues of morality that we all stand by and she is appalled by Frankâs behaviour and demands that he be persecuted regardless of his relationship with Wes. In sharp contrast, Julian believes that Frank can be excused for his actions because the victims were merely âred meatâ Native American women who he views as subhuman.\n\nâ\n\nCharactersÂ\n\nGail:\n\nGail is Davidâs mother and Wesleyâs wife. She is a compassionate, idealistic and courageous woman. This can also be seen as she stands up for Marie, despite the prejudices in the society at the time. She also spends a âgood deal of energyâ protecting herself and her family.Â She also doesnât take part in Wesleyâs racist jokes. For example, when Wesley makes a joke about Marie, ânever been to anyone but the tribal medicine manâ, David responds with âmy mother didnât laugh.â\n\nDavid:\n\nDavid is Wesley and Gailâs son and is the narrator of the text. He doesnât share Wesleyâs beliefs surrounding race and forms his own moral perspective. This is demonstrated when he makes a fuss about wanting to wear moccasins (which Gail sides with him on) while his father says will make him âas flat-footed and lazy as an Indian.âÂ\n\nUnlike his father, we donât see David conflicted with his loyalties and he is particularly critical of his father. This is best demonstrated when he âwas beginning to already think of Uncle Frank as a criminalâ upon hearing sexual assault accusations against Frank. When Wesley spares Gail the details of his investigation into Frank, David believes it could be because he is âtrying to protect his brother and keeping the number of witnesses to the accounts of his crime to a minimumâ. After Wesley arrests Frank and takes him to the basement for imprisonment, David assumes his father killed Frank despite Wesley not being depicted as a particularly violent person in the novel.Â All it takes is an indistinct noise from the basement for David to conjure up ways his father could have killed his Uncle Frank.\n\nFrank:\n\nFrank is Wesleyâs brother and is described as a âwitty and charmingâ doctor, and war hero who is widely loved by the community -particularly by his dad, Julian. In reality, Frank is a criminal who abuses his power - both a white man and a doctor to sexually assault Indian women - which he believes he can get away with.Â This is compounded when he states, âI am not concerned about social progress.â Through Frank, Watson demonstrates how some individuals can abuse their positions of power and privilege, and to not lose any sleep over it (âat smiling ease with his life and everything itâ).\n\nWesley:\n\nWesley is Julianâs son, Gailâs husband, and Davidâs father and the sheriff of Mercer county. He dislikes Native Americans and frequently makes jokes about them and stereotypes them. He even uses the fact that Marie Little Soldiers is a Native American to belittle and doubt the credibility of her experience.Â\n\nWesleyâs conflicting loyalties become more complex and difficult once you consider the prejudices at the time, his job as an officer of the law, Frankâs station in the family and community, Gailâs strong opinions and his constant need to seek validation from his father. An instance that mirrors Wesleyâs conflicting loyalties is when he tells Gail, âI wish you wouldnât have told the sheriff.â When she told informed him of Marieâs sexual assault allegations against Frank. However, in Wesleyâs eyes, Frankâs murder of Marie Little Soldier, is where the latter crosses the line. The magnitude of his brotherâs crime is too large for him to let his previous conflicting loyalties as a sheriff and a brother hold him back from arresting Frank. After convicting Frank and having to argue about it with his father, we learned âfor the first time how this experience with his brother was ruining him physically.âÂ\n\nJulian:\n\nJulian is a bigoted racist man who has an unconditional love for his son Frank and unfairly favours him over his son Wesley. When he learns of Franks charges he exclaims, âWhat kind of bullshit is this?â He belittles the sexual assaults as Frank just âfeeling them upâ and âassaulting an Indianâ. At this point, Julian taking Frankâs side exposes how irrationally loyal he is to his son and suggests that even if the women were not Indian, he may still stand by Frank's actions. He protests that the only reason Wesley convicted Frank was that âever since the war, ever since Frank came home in uniform and he [Wesley] stayed here [home],â heâs âbeen jealousâ. However, this comment seems to say more about Julianâs feelings than Wesleyâs - perhaps, this is why Julain felt this inclination towards Frank. After this argument, we see Wesleyâs feeling of defeat and heartbreak - that despite Frank being a murderer and a rapist, his father still seemed to pick his side over Wesleyâs.Â\n\nQuotesÂ\n\nQuotes on Prejudices, Discrimination and the Abuse of Power\n\nâHe wears those and soon he'll be as flat-footed and lazy as an Indian\" - Discrimination is evident in Montana 1948 where Wesley uses stereotypes of Indians to imply they are inferior to them, and that David shouldnât be like them.\n\n\"She's an Indian- Why would she tell the truth?âÂ Â\n\nâYour mother and I thought weâd have more to show than just one grandchild â¦ and white- we want them we want them whiteâ\n\nâScrewing an Indian. Or feeling her up or whatever. You donât lock up a man for that.â\n\nâYou know Frankâs always been partial to red meat.âÂ Â\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nâWesley, your brother is raping these women. These girls. These Indian girls.â\n\nQuotes on Law vs Justice\n\nâWhy did my grandfather first run for sheriff? â¦ He wanted, he needed power. He was a dominating man who drew sustenance and strength from controlling others.â This quote shows that many people in society at the time held positions of power such as lawyers or sheriff but didnât enforce the law or worry about the morality of their actions. Thus creating an unjust legal system that would allow these people to shape how the law is enforced with their own prejudices.\n\nâYou know what your Grandad said it means to be a peace officer in Montana? He said it means knowing when to look and when to look away.âÂ Â\n\nâI think the problem has been taken care of. Frank said heâs going to cut it outâ\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nQuotes on Loyalty vs Morality\n\n\"David, I believe that in this world people must pay for their crimes. It doesn't matter who you are or who your relations are; if you do wrong, you pay. I believe that. I have to.\"\n\nâI wish you wouldnât have told the sheriff.âÂ\n\nâI think the problem has been taken care of. Frank said heâs going to cut it outâ\n\nâWell if Sheriff Hayden says it's so, it must be so.â\n\nâYou donât lock up your brother. A respected man. A war hero.â âThis is a legal matter.â âBullsh*t.â âThen why have you got him locked up here and not over at the jail? This is your brother here. My son!â\n\nQuotes on Destruction of Innocence\n\n'I had gone back into the house -to the kitchen, to my room, out the backdoor, I had left the porch and followed frank's steps down the front walk - I never would have heard the conversation between my father and mother, and perhaps I would have lived my life with an illusion about my family and perhaps the human communityâ - page 33\n\nâThe shock of hearing this about Uncle Frank was doubled because my mother was saying these words. Rape. Breasts. Penis. These were words I never heard my mother use-ever- and Iâm sure her stammer was not only from emotion but also from the strain on her vocabulary.â\n\nâBut I was on a trail that would lead me out of my childhood.â\n\nâ\n\nWith contributions from Fae Saberi.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction to William Wordsworth and Romanticism\n\nKey Features of Romantic Poetry\n\nPoetic Analysis Examples\n\n1. Introduction to William Wordsworth and Romanticism\n\nWilliam Wordsworth was a British poet and primary co-founder of the Romantic literary movement. He strongly believed that the poetry of the nineteenth century was much too fast-paced and too mindless to be able to evoke a meaningful message to the reader. Contending that âall good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling,â he wished to pioneer Romanticism to create a genre of poetry that reminded the reader of the very essence of humanity.\n\nAs such, Wordsworth and fellow poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge founded a new style of poetry through their co-written 1798 Lyrical Ballads, a collection of poetry which attempted to unite the human condition with the tranquility of nature.Â\n\nAs a resident of Englandâs picturesque Lake District, Wordsworth enjoyed becoming one with nature by wandering through the neighbouring hills, moors and lakeside views, while mentally composing poems inspired by its glorious elements.Â\n\nWilliam Wordsworth: Poems Selected by Seamus Heaney is usually studied in the Australian curriculum under Area of Study 1 - Text Response. For a detailed guide on Text Response, check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\n2. Key Features of Romantic Poetry\n\nNature\n\nThe Romantic movement of poetry was founded during the Industrial Revolution, a period in which people were growing farther from the serene comfort of nature and closer towards modern mechanisation and mass manufacturing. As such, a primary characteristic of Romantic poetry is nature, as poets attempted to remind humanity of its meditative respite, and the comfort it could provide in the backdrop of the pollution that accompanied the growing industrialisation of England.Â\n\nWordsworth was a pantheist and believed that God was within every aspect of the natural world. In addition to this, he categorised himself as an ardent âworshipper of natureâ. Thus, much of his poetry explores nature in a sacred and religious sense, presenting goodness and naturalness as synonymous - aptly displaying his belief of nature as a living, divine entity that could only to be ignored at humankindâs peril.Â\n\nEmotionalismÂ\n\nRomantic poetry subdues reason, intellect and the scientific truth in order to place more focus on the âtruth of the imaginationâ. As a result of the harsh rigidity and rationality of the Enlightenment era, all human sentiments, from melancholiness to hopefulness, were celebrated by Romantics as important instruments in poetry to remind the common people of sentimentality in a modern and intransigent era.Â\n\nAs Romantics believed that these feelings allowed one to look deeper into oneâs self, the theme of powerful emotions constructs the very essence of Romantic poetic poetry. As a result of this, rather than placing much importance on sense or sensibility, much of Wordsworthâs poems scrutinise his own effusion of feelings and the universal truths that these help him discover, speaking as the characteristic Romantic poet occupying a sentimental place of alienation.\n\nRebellion and Individualism\n\nThe Industrial Revolution oversaw the creation of distinct class differences between the extremely wealthy class of businessmen, and financially struggling workers and entrepreneurs. Poets, like all other artists, were forced to become increasingly independent and needed to rely on their unique vision and style in order to succeed in their gradually declining line of work. The Romantics subsequently began to view themselves as heroes who challenged and overcame the social challenges that arose; as champions of independence and self-awareness. As such, Romantic poetry often features characters or symbols of valiant heroism, as the poet acts as a visionary figure in his work, like a prophet telling of poetic self-awareness.Â\n\nThe Sublime\n\nIn accordance with their celebration of human emotions, Romantics also became fascinated with the literary conception of âthe sublimeâ, a mental state that Classical authors such as Longinus defined as âphysical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic greatnessâ that is of such magnificence that it cannot be measured.Â\n\nThe Romantics explored these extraordinary experiences in their poetry, describing the power of such sublime experiences on oneâs senses, mind and imagination. Wordsworth expressed in his essay that a sublime experience is what occurs when oneâs mind attempts to attain âsomething towards which it can make approaches but which it is incapable of attainingâ. For example, his biographical poem, The Prelude recounts his ascent of Mount Snowdon and the sublime emotions he experiences as a result of its powerful atmosphere.Â\n\nMany have viewed Wordsworthâs view of the sublime as the Romantic standard, as his poetry focuses equally on both the alluring and devastating aspects of such sublime experiences. His work focuses on the intertwined pleasure and terror that is generated as a result of such experiences, and how either end of the spectrum is ultimately beautiful and inspiring.\n\nContext is really important when engaging with a text in VCE English, so be sure to read Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English.\n\n3. Poetic Analysis ExamplesÂ\n\nExample Passage 1\n\nBooks! 'tis a dull and endless strife:\n\nCome, hear the woodland linnet,\n\nHow sweet his music! on my life,\n\nThere's more of wisdom in it.\n\nAnd hark! how blithe the throstle sings!\n\nHe, too, is no mean preacher:\n\nCome forth into the light of things,\n\nLet Nature be your teacher.\n\nThis passage, taken from Wordsworthâs Tables Turned; An Evening Scene on the Same Subject, is a primary example of a poem displaying the Romanticsâ propensity and reverence for the natural landscape.Â Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nThe speaker of the poem contrasts the âendless strifeâ of book-learning to the spontaneous and liberal method of learning through interacting with nature. The description of the âwoodland [linnetâs]â song as âsweetâ music evokes an image of heavenly bliss associated with the charms hidden within nature. That âthereâs more of wisdom inâ such nature works in tandem with this, as the speaker asserts that the natural landscape is able to teach a lesson of a magnificence incomparable to the monotony of the âdullâ studying thorough book-learning.Â\n\nThe speakerâs evocation of âblitheâ emotions through sound is continued in the second stanza, in which âthe throstleâ delivers another divine âsongâ in an attempt to entice the reader. The speaker furthers his advocation for natural learning through a condemnation of route learning, as he attacks teachers of such as âmean preachersâ. The directly following use of a pun emphasises this contrast, as the âlight of thingsâ symbolises both the enlightenment that will accompany natureâs teaching, as well as the literal âlightâ of nature underneath the sun.Â\n\nThe final line of the passage summarises the speakerâs persuasion aptly, as the phrase, âlet nature be your teacherâ, rings similar to a passage which can be found in the Bible; the speaker thus implies that the natural world is the all-superior entity and source of knowledge that one should take lessons from.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe rhyme and the rhythmic beat of the poem give it a sound comparable to a nursery-rhyme. This works in tandem with the Romantic viewpoint that great poetic language should be simple, accessible and conversational; as understandable to the common people as a nursery rhyme is to a child. This similarity also works in accordance with the authorial message of the poem, that nature should be a universal âteacherâ, as nursery rhymes are often employed as enjoyable sing-songs that educate children on a moral level. As such, Wordsworth here strengthens his viewpoint through his poetic words; that nature should be a mentor to all.Â\n\nExample Passage 2\n\nâFor thou art with me here upon the banksÂ\n\nOf this fair river; thou my dearest Friend,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catchÂ\n\nThe language of my former heart, and readÂ\n\nMy former pleasures in the shooting lightsÂ\n\nOf thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little whileÂ\n\nMay I behold in thee what I was once,Â\n\nMy dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make,Â\n\nKnowing that Nature never did betrayÂ\n\nThe heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,Â\n\nThrough all the years of this our life, to leadÂ\n\nFrom joy to joyâ¦\n\nTherefore let the moonÂ\n\nShine on thee in thy solitary walk;Â\n\nAnd let the misty mountain-winds be freeÂ\n\nTo blow against thee: and, in after years,Â\n\nWhen these wild ecstasies shall be maturedÂ\n\nInto a sober pleasure; when thy mindÂ\n\nShall be a mansion for all lovely forms,Â\n\nThy memory be as a dwelling-placeÂ\n\nFor all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,Â\n\nIf solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,Â\n\nShould be thy portion, with what healing thoughtsÂ\n\nOf tender joy wilt thou remember me,Â\n\nAnd these my exhortations! Nor, perchanceâÂ\n\nIf I should be where I no more can hearÂ\n\nThy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleamsÂ\n\nOf past existenceâwilt thou then forgetÂ\n\nThat on the banks of this delightful streamÂ\n\nWe stood together; and that I, so longÂ\n\nA worshipper of Nature, hither cameÂ\n\nUnwearied in that service: rather sayÂ\n\nWith warmer loveâoh! with far deeper zealÂ\n\nOf holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget,Â\n\nThat after many wanderings, many yearsÂ\n\nOf absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,Â\n\nAnd this green pastoral landscape, were to meÂ\n\nMore dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!\n\nThis passage is taken from the final section from Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey, a critical work in Wordsworthâs poetic career. Tracing the growth of his mind in different periods of time, the poem is a condensed, spiritual autobiography of Wordsworth himself as it views his younger self from the perspective of his older self, weighing the sense of âlossâ suffered against the belief that the years have brought him âabundant recompenseâ.Â\n\nThematic Analysis\n\nAfter recalling his experiences with nature over his formative and adult years, the speaker now addresses his younger sister Dorothy, as he gives her heartfelt advice about what he has learnt. Here, Dorothy becomes a ghost of his former self, as he hears âthe language of his former heartâ when she speaks and perceives his âformer pleasureâ in the âsoothing lights of [her] wild eyesâ.Â\n\nThe speaker depicts his loyalty to nature and its reflective loyalty to him, by the expression that ânature never did betray [his] heartâ that loves Dorothy, and this is the reason they have been living from âjoy to joyâ, lending nature a role of salvation.Â\n\nThe speaker then directly addresses the moon as a kind of separate entity, in order to ask it to bless his sister by shining on her âsolitary walkâ, so that when she is an adult her mind may become a âmansion for all lovely formsâ. This is an ode to the harshness of the society at the time, in which the privileged businessmen and factory owners possessed a monopoly over British wealth, and accompanying prejudices clouded social judgement. As such, the speaker expresses his desires for his beloved sister to be exempt from such hardship that he was once subjected to, so that she can enjoy âsweet sounds and memoriesâ without experiencing the vexations of an unrelenting human society.Â\n\nThe conclusion of the poem is cyclic, as it takes the speaker back to the âgreen pastoral landscapeâ of the beginning of his meditations. This symbolises the omnipresent timelessness of nature. As the speaker muses upon his âpast existenceâ, he wishes to convey his own reverence for nature to his beloved sister, as he expresses that she will not forget the âsteep woods and lofty cliffsâ upon which he first understood and respected nature.Â\n\nStylistic Analysis\n\nThe language utilised in this poem is lucid and natural, characteristic of Romantic poetry. The simplicity of the words chosen by Wordsworth effectively communicate the honesty of his own emotions towards nature. The elevated blank verse structure furthers this simplicity, as its familiar and easy tone is like that of a comfortable heartbeat or pulse that runs throughout oneâs body in a serene state of mind.Â\n\nUltimately, the unconstrained and liberating tone of the poem, in accordance with its free blank verse structure emphasises Wordsworthâs belief that nature is within our very selves. Just as the poem runs smoothly and continuously, akin to a human pulse, Wordsworth suggests that nature too runs within everyone as an incessant heartbeat, necessary in order to experience a âwarmerâ and âholierâ love for this universe.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf you, like me, grew up Asian in Australia, you might think you already know a thing or two about, well, growing up Asian in Australia. Our stories can be pretty similarâjust have a scroll through the âsubtle asian traitsâ Facebook group, or have a conversation with literally any Asian Australian about their parents.\n\nAt the same time, itâs also important to recognise that everyoneâs experiences are diverse, especially given how broad an identity âAsianâ can be. Also important is to recognise how broad and intersectional identity can be in generalâintersectional meaning that race isnât the only thing that defines any one of us. Things like gender, socio-economic status, ability, sexual orientation and religion can also be really central, for example. Each of these things can impact the way we navigate the world.\n\nCovering a broad range of these stories is Alice Pungâs anthology, Growing Up Asian In Australia. Some of the contributors in this volume include Sunil Badami, Matt Huynh, Bon-Wai Chou, Diana Nguyen, Michelle and Benjamin Law, and Shaun Tan, and already this cross-section is fairly diverse in nature. You can also click on their names to find out a bit more about each of their work. I think this is worth a few minutes, just to get acquainted with the sheer range of Asian-Australian creatives who are represented in this book, and to locate their work within the themes they write aboutâin other words, having a think about the ways that cultural heritage, or experiences with family, or economic hardship permeate their work, both in the anthology and in their lives outside it.\n\nThe anthology is (perhaps quite helpfully) divided into sections which revolve around key themes, which is also going to inform the structure of this guide. Iâll be using this guide to go through an exercise that I found really helpful when learning the text, which involves:\n\ntaking two stories per section and drawing up some dot-point similarities and differences\n\ntranslating two of those points into paragraphs, a bit like a âmini-essayâ\n\nWeâll go through some an example of what this might look like, and why itâs a helpful exercise to try.\n\nBefore we start diving into Growing Up Asian in Australia, I'd highly recommend checking out LSG's Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nStrine (Badami & Tseng)\n\nStrine is whatâs called a syncope, a shortened way of pronouncing Australian (a bit like âStrayaâ)âit refers to Australian English as itâs spoken by locals. This section of the book is all about language, and about the difficulties of juggling two languages growing up, and Badami and Tsengâs stories are great examples of this.\n\n1. Similarity: connections to oneâs mother tongue fade over time. Tseng recounts how, one by one, she and her sisters stopped learning Chinese as they progressed through their Australian education. Badami on the other hand compromises his name which stood out as too Indian when he âjust wanted to fit in.â\n\n2. Similarity: for âthird-culture kidsâ, losing knowledge of their language also strains their relationship with their forebears. Badamiâs mother is shocked to hear the anglicisation of his name despite the significance it carrie for her (âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringyâ), and Tseng describes the experience of communicating with her father in âChinglishâ so that they can both understand each other.\n\n3. Difference: language can be an internalised, personal experience, or a highly exposed and interpersonal one. While Tseng feels her loss of her language as a âsense of shame, a vague uneaseâ, Badami is almost bullied into changing his name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â\n\nThe Clan (Law & Chau)\n\nThis section delves into the complex ties that hold migrant families together. Chauâs poems are starkly different to Lawâs story, so itâll be interesting to compare how these different narrative forms work to explore those ideas.\n\n1. Similarity: it can take at least one generation for migrant families to dig their roots into their new home. While Lawâs parents are proud tourists at Queensland theme parks, he and his siblings âgroanâ at their comportment. Chauâs poem âThe Firstbornâ traces his ancestry forward until he arrived, âan ABCâ and his son âby amniotic seaâ, both of them born into Australia.\n\n2. Similarity: family dynamics are still traditional and therefore gendered. Law notes how his motherâs health suffered when divorcing his father, and Chau notes that the women members of his family were âcast offâ the family tree âas if they were never born.\n\n3. Difference: family history and heritage can vary in importance. Chauâs family traces back âtwenty-eight generationsâ of history, whereas Lawâs family very much lives in the present, the only tie to older generations being his âMa-Maâ, or grandma.\n\n4. Difference: families show their love in different ways. Whether itâs dedicating a poem to his son about his life as one of âten thousand riversâ of Chinese diaspora into the Australian sea, or taking the kids to theme parks on weekends, all sorts of affection can hold families together.\n\nPutting it together\n\nSo Iâve tried to choose two sections (and four stories) that are all a bit different to try and mix it up and get some rich comparative discussion out of these. You might be studying this text alone, but even as one text, remember that thereâs a lot of diverse experiences being represented in it, so discussing how stories connect, compare and contrast is just as important as discussing the content of individual stories themselves.\n\nIf we do a mini-essay, we might as well go about it properly and pick some sort of contention. Without a fixed prompt though, it might be easier to start with those dot points and pick which ones we want to write out and string together. Letâs pick twoâconnections to mother tongue fading over time (Strine similarity 1) and digging roots into Australia over time (The Clan similarity 1). A contention covering these points might look like:\n\nWhile second generation migrants may struggle with loss of culture, they also constitute a unique and significant part of the diaspora.\n\nAn example\n\nMany migrants lose connections to their heritage over time, and these connections are often in the form of language. Particularly for Asian migrants, there is not as strong a need to preserve their mother tongue in the English-speaking Australia, and as such their knowledge of those languages can be easily lost. Ivy Tseng, for instance, recalls how she was never able to âgrasp the significanceâ of learning Chinese as a child, and eventually she and her sisters would prioritise âstudyâ and other academic pursuits over learning Chinese. Because tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language. These compromises can come from other factors as well, particularly the group dynamics of being in white-dominated Australia. Bullying is a frequent culprit, and Badami for example is indeed peer-pressured into resentingâand ultimately anglicisingâhis name, âSunil? Like banana peel?â More generally speaking, a sense of shame for oneâs difference is a common part of the migrant experienceâLaw experiences it as well at theme parks, where he and his siblings attempt to âset [them]selves apartâ from the faux-pas of their parents. Not always an intentional goal, but a general willingness to compromise connections to heritage underscores many Asian Australian migrant stories, particularly of second-generation migrants.\n\nHowever, the extent to which migrants feel socially integrated in society shifts generationally and over time as well. Second generation migrants are thus unique in that they have the closest connection to their heritage while also initiating this process of integration. Law and his siblings exemplify this, with their âAustralian accentsâ and âproper grammar and syntax.â While some loss of their native Cantonese takes place, they are also the first in their family to sound Australian, one step closer to being Australian. They constitute part of the distinct, third culture of âABCââAustralian-born Chineseâto which Chau alludes in his poem, âThe Firstbornâ. Distinct from first-generation migrants, ABCs are a product of diaspora and spend their formative years immersed in the Australian way of life. Chauâs poem goes on to highlight how sizeable this demographic now isââthe sea is awash with the unfathomable Chinese sons.â Thus, we can see how ABCs, or second generation Asian migrants, represent a unique and significant social group exemplified by great compromise, but also great change.\n\nWhy is this useful?/How can I apply this?\n\nI like this exercise because it gets you thinking creatively about the key implications of the stories. Within a section or theme, you want to identify similarities in how both stories contribute to our understanding of that theme. You also want to identify differences to explore how stories can be unique and nuanced, which will provide your essay with more depth when you ultimately need it. Then, putting it all together helps you synthesise new connections between themes.\n\nFor an analytical study of this text, youâd flesh out those ideas until they become paragraphs, introducing relevant evidence and mixing it up with explanatory sentences as you go. Explanatory sentences keep you analysing rather than story-telling, and they usually donât have any quotesâan example from above might be âbecause tertiary study and education as an institution generally carry a lot of weight in migrant cultures, there is often a compromise made at the expense of heritage and language.â\n\nFor a creative study, youâd take away those ideas and look at how else you might explore them in other stories. Feel free to challenge yourself for this; I remember falling back on more personal writing when studying this creatively, but donât neglect other genres or forms! If second generation migrants are in fact more on their way to belonging, write a speculative story about how an apocalypse tests those connections to white Australians. I dunno, but donât be afraid to really push the boundaries here and test the implications you draw from the stories.\n\nGive it a go\n\nTry it for some of these:\n\nUnAustralian?

Discuss.Â\n\nThe key terms are evidently âto belongâ and âto sacrificeâ, so these are the words and definitions that weâll have to interrogate.Â\n\nBelonging is a feeling of being accepted by someone or being a member of something, so weâd have to ask who is doing the accepting, and what are the writers seeking to be members of. On the other hand, sacrifice is loss, itâs giving something upâitâs implied that seeking belonging means you may have to navigate compromises to what you have, how you live, or maybe, who you are. Have a think about what sacrifices are made by whom, and why.\n\nWith that in mind, letâs brainstorm a contention. We usually want to avoid going fully agree or fully disagree to create a bit more âgritâ for the essayâand in this case, the prompt is pretty deterministic or absolute; itâs saying that belonging is all about sacrifice.Â\n\nIâd probably argue that belonging is sometimes about sacrifice, and for migrant children they often give up some of their culture or heritage for Western lifestyle or values. That being said, belonging in these cases is probably more about synthesis than sacrificeâitâs about being able to negotiate and bring heritage into increasingly Australian ways of life.\n\nThe brainstorming section of writing a killer essay is where my THINK and EXECUTE strategy comes in. If you havenât heard of it before, essentially, itâs a method of essay writing that emphasises the importance of really thinking about all aspects of a prompt and exploring all the different avenues you can go down. To be able to EXECUTE a well-reasoned, coherent and articulate essay that contains enough nitty-gritty analysis, you have to do enough THINKing to get some meat on the essayâs skeleton, so to speak. To learn more, check out my top selling eBook, How To Write A Killer Text Response.\n\nIn paragraphs, we could start by looking at some of the sacrifices people make in order to belong. The poem, âBe Good, Little Migrantsâ has a more of a cynical take on this, suggesting that migrant groups are expected to sacrifice economic mobility and even personal dignity in order to gain favour with locals: âgive us your faithful serviceâ, âdisplay your gratitude but donât be heard, donât be seen.âÂ\n\nEconomic sacrifices are seen across many stories, from the working class âdecent enough incomeâ in âFamily Lifeâ to the failing business in âABC Supermarketâ. Other forms of sacrifice might be less materialâfor example Benjamin Lawâs sacrifice of his Mariah Carey cassettes in an attempt to fit in at school from the story âTowards Manhoodâ. This example is interesting because it isnât a cultural sacrifice, but a gendered oneâitâs a good reminder that identity is always multi-layered.Â\n\nFor migrant children though, the sacrifices usually revolve around their race and culture. Diana Nguyen for example notes language as a key sacrifice: she quits Vietnamese school because she didnât feel like she belonged with the grade ones in her class, and her ultimate âlack of interest in learning [Vietnamese] created a lasting barrierâ between her mother and her. In Sunil Badamiâs story, âSticks and Stones and Such-Likeâ, the sacrifice is his name, as he Anglicises it to Neil. When his mother finds out, âshe spat my unreal new name out like something bitter and stringy, too difficult to swallow.â The common denominator here is that Asians growing up in Australia often have to navigate sacrificing some of their heritage in order to belong in western society.Â\n\nHowever, the challenges faced by the Asian diaspora growing up abroad are more complex and more nuanced than just sacrifice. More often than not, theyâre required to synthesise a âthird cultureâ identity that balances their heritage with western values and lifestyles.Â\n\nDiana Nguyen goes on to discuss her career trajectory in becoming a âworking actorâ in Melbourneâs entertainment industry, carving out a path for herself in spite of her parentsâ disapproval, and going on to represent a new generation of Asian Australians in the media. The story âWei-Lei and Meâ also points to this shifting demographic in Australia, as Gouvernel and her best friend stave off a racist primary school bully only to see their home change for the better as they grew up, with new restaurants from their home cuisines opening up. At the same time, they âhad become what [they] thought [they] could never be: Australian,â describing a way of life in Canberra that is unmistakably Australian.Â\n\nSo, belonging isnât necessarily all about sacrificeâit doesnât mean you canât pursue your passions or become âAustralianâ. Sure, sometimes sacrifice is necessary, but âthird culture kidsâ synthesise conflicting identities in order to belong.Â\n\nHaving arrived at the contention, letâs just have another think about the takeaway message - being able to bring other themes into an essay topic that only really raises one theme. To answer this topic fully, a good essay wouldnât just discuss belonging and sacrifice, but it would also bring in discussion about family, friends, careers and cultures, just to name a few. Hopefully this is something you can translate into your own future work!\n\nConclusion\n\nGrowing Up Asian In Australia is an anthology with a lot to unpack, but there are plenty of unique stories with plenty of interesting links to be made. However youâre learning this text, being able to draw conclusions from stories and extrapolate them into your writing is a really important skill.\n\nAs you go, ask yourself about the implications: âso what?â and âwhy?â. These sorts of questions will help you get richer insights and write about the anthology in a more interesting way.\n\nVideo Transcription\n\nIntroduction to Animal Farm:\n\n- Written in 1945 by George Orwell, Animal Farm is an allegorical novella about the 1917 Russian Revolution and the repressive Stalinist period which followed.\n\n- As a democratic socialist, Orwell was an adamant critic of Joseph Stalin and his totalitarian dictatorship over Russia. Â\n\n- Thus, Orwell wrote Animal Farm as a satirical fable against Stalinâs tyrannical control, stating that he wrote it with the intention of âfusing political purpose and artistic purpose into one wholeâ.\n\nSetting:\n\n- The novella is set in Manor Farm, located in Willingdon, England at an undisclosed time.\n\n- As the events of Animal Farm symbolise the power struggle of early 20th century Russia, this ambiguity of time is intended to prevent Orwellâs warning against repressive tyranny from becoming dated.\n\n- Orwellâs use of a farm as the main setting is also notable, as farms represent nations in Animal Farm; both require a vast amount of work in order to function properly. Thus, the act of the animals cooperating to cast the humans out of the farm symbolises a workersâ revolution against their oppressive leadership.\n\nMain Character Analysis:\n\nNapoleon (pig):\n\n- Based on Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, he emerges as the leader of the Farm after the Rebellion.\n\n- He consolidates his control over the farm with the violent force of his nine attack dogs, having raised them as puppies; these directly symbolise Stalinâs military force.\n\n- He never contributes to other animalsâ efforts at revolution, as he is only a corrupt individual who seeks to take advantage of opportunities created for him by others.\n\nSnowball (pig):\n\n- Based on Soviet rebel Leon Trotsky, he challenges Napoleon for control of the Farm after he takes control of the leadership.\n\n- Similar to the leader he is modelled after, Snowball is eloquent, charismatic, intelligent and persuasive - thus, he wins the loyalty and support of other animals easily.\n\nBoxer (cart-horse):\n\n- Extremely devoted to the farm and the Rebellion, Boxer symbolises what Orwell believed to be the best qualities of the proletariat, or the exploited working class, such as loyalty, strength, camaraderie and hard work, perceivable by his personal motto of âI will work harderâ.\n\n- However, he simultaneously suffers from typical weakness of the working class, such as a naive trust in the intelligentsia and a slow-witted oblivion to political corruption, represented by his other motto of âNapoleon is always rightâ.\n\nSquealer (pig):\n\n- Manipulative and highly persuasive, he spreads Napoleonâs propaganda throughout the farm to intimidate uneducated animals into supporting Napoleonâs ideas and policies.\n\n- Orwell uses the character of Squealer to warn against politiciansâ deliberate manipulation of mass media in order to gain social and political control.\n\nOld Major (boar):\n\n- Based on the socialist revolutionary Karl Marx, as well as Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin, Old Majorâs dream of a socialist utopia acts as a major motive for the Rebellion.\n\n- Majorâs death creates a political vacuum in the farm, leaving Napoleon and Snowball in a power struggle for control of his followers.\n\nThemes and Motifs:\n\nTyranny:\n\n- By allegorising in Napoleon dictator Joseph Stalin, Animal Farm is first and foremost a satirical critique of politiciansâ tyrannical misuse of power.\n\n- This is epitomised by the deceitful methods Napoleon uses to gain support, such as lying to the other animals that Snowball is a political traitor in order to banish him from the Farm.\n\nNaive Proletariat:\n\n- Animal Farm explores the need for the working class to be educated, as the inability of the farm animals to question Napoleonâs authority directly leads to the perpetuation of his oppression.\n\n- Thus, Orwell presents to his readership that the working class may suffer not only due to dictatorsâ abuse of power, but also from their own naive unwillingness to question the intentions of the authority.\n\nFalse Allegiance:\n\n- Orwell accurately exhibits treacherous aspects of the human condition in his portrayal of dramatised relationships between humans and animals.\n\n- Just as the pig rulers of the rebellion eventually betray their own idealistic visions, the theme of alliance is shattered between Frederick and Napoleon when the latter learns that the former has been forging banknotes while buying firewood from him.\n\n- Thus, Animal Farm depicts the idea that alliances formed in a tyrannical dictatorship are merely veneers of camaraderie, which hide each personâs capability to destroy others in their path towards control.\n\nAnalysis of Quotes:\n\nâFour legs good, two legs bad.â\n\n- From Chapter 3, this slogan is based off of Old Majorâs speech before his death about the need for animals to unite in the face of human oppression and tyranny.\n\n- The quote is a noteworthy example of propaganda in Animal Farm, as the leaders utilise language in order to essentially brainwash the working class animals.\n\n- Although it initially helps the animals to remember their goals, the phrase later loses its meaning of solidarity as it becomes a nonsensical noise made by sheep when used to drown out the voices of challengers to the regime.\n\nâAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.â\n\n- This quote exemplifies the pigsâ abuse of logic and language to keep their power over their followers.\n\n- The evidently senseless and illogical meaning behind this phrase is an example of the methods that the leader of the Farm takes in order to brainwash his followers.\n\n- The quote also suggests that the pigsâ real intention to create an animal utopia is not, in fact, to rise up against the oppression of the humans, but to become part of the elite; the âsomeâ that possess greater rights and power than the rest of the underprivileged society.\n\nâ\n\n5 Types of Essay Prompts\n\nYour approach to each essay will depend on what type of prompt is being asked. Be aware that not all essay prompts are the same, which means that sometimes your preferred essay structure simply wonât suit the type of prompt asked. That's why it's important to be aware of the 5 types of essay topics â what you should watch out for and how you could approach your essay writing. The topics used in this blog post have been curated by Lisa's Study Guides.\n\n1. Theme-based prompts :\n\nAnimal Farm is first and foremost a satirical critique of politiciansâ tyrannical misuse of power.\n\nUsually your paragraphs will be based around particular themes. For example in this case, paragraphs may be based on âloveâ, âescapeâ, âhorrors of warâ etc. These paragraphs can have character discussions embedded within them in order to demonstrate how the characters represent each theme. Discussion of the authorâs choice of language such as symbols or imagery can be essential to the analysis of a theme.\n\n2. Character-based prompts :\n\nBoxer is the only animal with redeeming qualities. Do you agree?\n\nThese prompts focus on one or more characters. In this case, you can structure your essay paragraphs based on particular characters or something in common with a set of characters. Essays can become quite repetitive if each paragraph is based around one character so try to add in discussion about themes or the characterâs relationships with other characters. Remember that minor characters can be just as important as major characters.\n\n3. How-based prompts :Â\n\nHow does Napoleon exert control over the farm?\n\nThese prompts are usually structured, âhow does the character do this,â or 'how does the author do this'. In this case, since the prompt is focused on one main character, try to weave in the main characterâs interactions with other characters and how other characters influenced them.\n\n4. Metalanguage-based prompts :\n\nThe language in Animal Farm is crucial to Orwell's storytelling.\n\nThese types of prompts are the rarest of the 5 prompts but donât be surprised if youâre asked one. They focus more on theÂ languageÂ part of the text; rather than the plot, themes or characters. Your discussion will revolve around the authorâs use of language (metaphors, prose, syntax etc.). These discussions are typically viewed as âharderâ prompts because you need to think about how the author achieves a particular message about character or theme through their choice of words. Check out our blog post onÂ metalanguageÂ and what you need to look out for.\n\nExtra helpful resource by the BBC: Form, structure and language in Animal Farm.\n\nâ\n\n5. Quote prompts :\n\n'All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.â How is this true in Animal Farm?\n\nThese prompts can be character- or theme-based. However, it differs from other essay topics because it includes a direct quote from the text. Remember that the quote is part of the prompt, so ensure that you address it. One of the best ways of doing so is to incorporate the quote into the essay itself.\n\nWhen faced with unknown prompts in a SAC or your exam, it's reassuring to have a formulaic breakdown of the prompt so that your brain immediately starts categorising the prompt - which of the 5 types of prompts does this one in front of me fall into?\n\nTo learn more, I discuss this and offer you practical strategies (so you never mind-blank again!) in my ebook, How To Write A Killer Text Response.

So, I want to get a new segment started and it's pretty much the âessay questions with Lisa Tranâ segment. And basically, what this includes is every now and then I will choose a topic on one of your suggestions of whatever book, or film youâre studying, and break that down together with you on camera, on YouTube. So, if you like the idea of that, then make sure you give this video a thumbs up so that I know that this is something that you're super keen on and that you'll find helpful.Â\n\nSo, I've taken liberties (since this is the first one that we've ever done) of choosing my own essay topic that I was interested in doing. It's based on The Handmaid's Tale, and if any of you have read this or watched it (it's a TV series on Hulu) I have read and watched both and it has just been sensational, so I wanted to basically break down this prompt with you. If it's something that you haven't watched, or if you haven't read it, that's not a problem at all because the skills that I will be teaching you when it comes to breaking down an essay topic will be invaluable when it comes to actually applying it to your own studies. So, let's get started.Â\n\nThe Handmaid's Tale Quick Summary\n\nJust as a really quick summary (that will probably butcher the overall meaning and the experience that you get from the book, but I don't want to really spoil it for you either), The Handmaidâs Tale is set in this future world where America, or the United States, has become a dystopian society, and women in particular are reduced to nothing more than just a child bearing species. Men are in charge and these women, who are deemed to be people who can give birth, are kept alive and kept around in these rich people's homes or people who are higher up in the hierarchy, and they basically have to have sex with the male leader of the home and just create children, and that is their purpose. If they're no longer fertile, then they'll pretty much be out-casted from society and rejected.Â\n\nAs a book, it's very thought-provoking because it's set in the future. Of course, this is something that we cannot guarantee won't actually happen. It's really scary to see how a world that was progressive (because they lived in modern American society, there was a lot of free movement happening, there were same-sex relationships that were out in the open, people were taking contraceptives) regressed, and it went back to a lot of old values that we had moved on from. It really opens up a pot of questions that you can ask about where weâre going as a society, where we think we're going as a society and where we'll actually end up.Â\n\nThat's just my quick two minute spiel. If you wanted to get your hands on the book then I highly recommend it - I'll pop it down in the description box below (on Youtube).Â\n\nPart 1: Brainstorm\n\nThe question here is âAtwoodâs concerns in The Handmaid's Tale go beyond women's freedomâ Discuss.\n\nÂ So, the first thing I always do is I look at the keywords; we've got âAtwoodâs concernsâ, âgo beyondâ and âwomen's freedomâ.Â\n\nThe reason why we look at keywords is because we want to confirm to ourselves (as the writer of this essay), that we are going to stay focused and not go off topic with the essay topic, and the keywords will ensure that not only we stay on topic, but they emphasize the ideas that we really need to focus on. So, let's break down each of the keywords individually.\n\nâAtwoodâs concernsâÂ\n\nThis means that we have to focus on the author's intention or message in writing The Handmaid's Tale. We'd be thinking about âwhat ideas does she criticize or condemn?â, or âwhat does she endorse on the other hand?â\n\nâgo beyondâ\n\nSo, âgo beyondâ is a very straightforward way of saying that an essay that is only focused on women's freedom probably won't be holistic or well-rounded enough. We have to look beyond the obvious.Â\n\nâwomenâs freedomâ\n\nThe third one is âwomen's freedomâ. So, what does this mean? To live in a patriarchal society, to be constantly monitored by guards and potential eyes.Â\n\nIt's very easy to slip into just speaking about handmaids. Like I mentioned before, there's a male lead in the house who is the highest up in the hierarchy. He has a wife as well. Serena Joy is a perfect example of someone who on the surface ranks as the highest in female roles, because she is the wife of the commander. So, we see things from her perspective.\n\nPart 2: Main Arguments\n\nFrom this exploration of the key words, I can come up with two main body paragraphs. The two ideas are one:\n\nâTo live in a chilling, post-modernism dystopia, Atwood showcases the evils of the patriarchyâ\n\nMy second one is:\n\nâMoreover, Atwood reveals how, despite being at the top of the female hierarchy as commanderâs wives, even they sufferâ\n\nLet's have a look at both of these ideas individually.Â\n\nâTo live in a chilling, post-modernism dystopia, Atwood showcases the evils of the patriarchyâ\n\nSome of my rationale behind this idea include one: Offred, who is our protagonist. Offred is actually not her real name, and because Offred is not her real name, she therefore represents any type of handmaid. She's just another one of them with a name assigned to her. Our identity is connected with our name, so her identity, which is what makes her feel human, is completely shredded from her. She has trouble remembering what she even used to look like.\n\nThe second thing is that it's dehumanizing. It doesn't matter whether Offred is intelligent, educated or even beautiful, what matters are viable ovaries and therefore, she's classified as a handmaid, and this is her last chance at being able to survive in this type of society.Â\n\nThe third one is that she isn't even given the freedom to take her own life. Suicide is almost impossible, âI know why there was no glass in front of the watercolor picture of the blue irises, and why the window opens only partly and why the glass in it is shatter-proof. It isnât running away they're afraid of. We wouldn't get that far. It's those other escapes, the ones you can open in yourself, given a cutting edgeâ. For us as humans, we get the opportunity to do things that we want, but even to take her own life away, to save herself from the world that she's living in, is impossible.Â\n\nOnto our second idea.\n\nâMoreover, Atwood reveals how, despite being at the top of the female hierarchy as commanderâs wives, even they sufferâ\n\nThe first example I have for this is how Serena Joy, the commanderâs wife, actually used to have her own television show. She used to be really popular, she was a celebrity, and yet she's been reduced to basically just being the commander's wife, where she lurks around in the house. She really doesn't do that much anymore, she's just there to support her husband and that is her role.Â\n\nThe second example is that she's forced to partake in a ritual where her husband has sex with a handmaid, âWhich of us is it worse for, her or me?â (her meaning Offred). So, you can see that even for a commanderâs wife, somebody who is in a high position in this society (she's the elite basically of what women could be), even she is suffering.Â\n\nGoing back to our keyword of âgo beyondâÂ\n\nThis means that in fact, we should speak about other major issues in the novel and not just about female concerns. Our first two ideas revolve around female concern, but let's see what else we could discuss. To me, another major issue revolving around freedom that's important to talk about is âhas the Gilliad society actually influenced men and men's freedom?â It's super easy to just target men and say that, you know, men are in power now and so it's all about the women, but there are ample examples that show that even the men are suffering.Â\n\nOf course there are heaps of other issues that are brought forward in The Handmaid's Tale, but the ideas that Iâve discussed here are the ones that personally interest me the most, meaning that I've got a lot more to say and a lot more opinion to offer in my discussion.Â\n\nAt this point, I'll leave it up to you guys. If you have read or watched The Handmaid's Tale, tell me what you think or ask me any questions you have about how you would structure this essay. I'd really love to have a productive discussion with you that includes some critical thinking on your part.
