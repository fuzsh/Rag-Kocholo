        "text": "There hasn’t been much time to blog recently. Aside from the festival of over commitment that is the rest of my life, hillclimbing activity went up a level. Now the season has ended I’ve got time to sum things up.\n\nIn the last blog I mentioned that I was going to Anglesey to try out another Formula Ford on another circuit. Anglesey circuit is astounding, although I was only going to drive a small section of it, thankfully including what has now become one of my favourite corners. Things didn’t start too positively because the car I was down to drive looked a bit, well, like a typical school car. It was a 1976 Crossle, and not as neat as my Van-Diemen. And it was raining. So after a session in a hatchback I took the Crossle out. In the rain; generally I hate driving in the rain. So.. out of the pits and into a reasonably sharp left hander. I turned the wheel in what I thought was about the right way and something really odd happened. The car turned in positively and I felt, well, in control. No feeling that the ancient Irish machine wanted to head straight towards the barrier, spin, or actually do anything other than go round the corner tidily. This was a total contrast to the RF84. And it was pretty wet remember. In fact the Crossle felt grippier, more responsive and safer in the wet than my RF84 in the dry. Something, people, of a revelation. After 10 laps I went back to the pits. And there I had a bit of a de-brief with the instructors, who it turned out all raced Formula Fords. Without going into too much detail we talked about what the issues with my car could be, and I went out a few more times and had a some more really useful discussions. Up until that point I’ve never felt like I was being run by a team, but this felt like it. As you can probably imagine I’ve got nothing but good things to say about the Anglesey Racing School. A proper racing school in an age of “Racing Experiences” and “3 lap supercar blasts”. And I learned to do clutchless upshifts.\n\nIt was plain that the geometry/spring/damper setup on the RF84 was somewhat wide of the mark. I had just put the suspension back together pretty much as I’d found it during the rebuild. With the same springs and new Quantum dampers. For my level of driving that would be fine right? That viewpoint was starting to look pretty misguided. I actually walked out of a Bicester garage and said “I didn’t think springs and dampers would be that important”. A monumentally stupid statement, especially from somebody with my background. But it’s less stupid if you add “for somebody of my limited driving ability”. The big change of direction was that I could tell a decent set-up from frankly no set-up. What happened next is why I had no time to blog.\n\nI’m hugely indebted to my friends at Field Farm for their efforts in defining the new RF84 set-up, based on the concept of getting the corner frequency in the right range and going from there. We measured and calculated wheel rates, corner weighted the car and made the wheels point in the right direction. And a stack of other less important things. It has to be said that sitting in a Formula Ford with your hands on the wheel for over an hour is a form of cruel and unusual punishment. But as we will see, worth it for the rewards.\n\nFirst time out with the new setup, and recently updated gearing, was the Bank Holiday meeting at Gurston. My first run was an OKish 40.7. But after it I texted Mrs Marks and said “it feels like a racing car now”. Over the weekend I managed to put in consistent sub 40 times, but with a miss-fire above 6000rpm that the new gearing and set-up had forced to the top of the issues list. Before I hadn’t noticed it. It also helped having Pete and Jo around whilst I learned the new set-up and approach to racing. If this was serious you could call it driver coaching. When I was at the Gurston and Loton Pre 94 FF rounds I couldn’t work out how I could go any faster. But now I was going faster and could see how I could go faster still. (Fix the missfire for one thing.) The midfield looked like a distinct possibility in the fullness of time. So it turns out car setup is important, even for a driver with distinctly limited reserves of talent. Who knew?\n\nAfter Gurston we went testing at Curborough, and I helped out at a Classic F3 test session at Silverstone. Its fair to say that I’m learning the rudiments of car setup and how you approach it. The importance of it all was highlighted at the next Curborough round I did, where my first run was 0.3s inside my previous PB. (Then it rained.) And this was followed up on day one of the HSA season closing event at Curborough in October where I took 1.8s off the time I did on the 2 lap configuration at the same meeting in 2019. That’s a good day at the track.\n\nNeedless to say I’m really looking forward to the 2022 season, and the considerable to-do list on the car is going to keep me occupied until the fun starts again."
