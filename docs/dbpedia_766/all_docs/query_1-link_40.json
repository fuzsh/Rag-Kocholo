UNIVERSIDAD TECNICA ESTATAL DE QUEVEDO ESCUELA DE AGRONOMIA FACULTAD DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS CARRERA INGENIERIA AGRONOMICA INGLES PROYECTO INTEGRADOR GRUPO N#6 TEMA: Genetics and inheritance declined me in the melon crop improvement INTEGRANTES:  Damian guera  Tony Basurto  Jhonatan Loor  Damian Tasinchano  Ricardo Pallo DOCENTE: Roberto Caranza CURSO: IV MODULO “A” FECHA DE ENTREGA: 15/12/2015 AÑO LECTIVO 2015-2016\n\n2. Genetics and inheritance declined me in the melon crop improvement For a breeder adequate knowledge of the production system ofthe plants that works it is essential, as it largely defines the genetic mating design and should be used as the selection system to be used. In the specific case of Cucumis species melo L despite being a alógama plant from the point ofview of genetic improvement is handled as a self-pollinating plant, preventing the free breeding of this species through the seal of the flowers, since Thus further progress occurs in breeding programs. The main methods to create new cultivars in autogamous species are: introduction, selectionand hybridization. Selection methods applied are mass selection and the selection of pure lines. Mass selection is used when a group of similar plants in appearance, are selected and harvested and subsequently mixing seeds are sown in another generation. A pure line is but only offspring progeny by selfing of an individual plant homozygous, representatives of a pure line are all identical in their characteristics.The selectionofpure lines practiced insegregating populations afterartificial hybridization oftwovarieties. The hybridization method consists of crossing two varieties or inbred lines and select segregating progeny containing the combination of the best features of the parents. Current trend of melon breeding Today, despite the high price of hybrid seed, the general trend in improving the melon is obtaining great hybrid vigor, because of heterosis observed for most of the characters of agronomic interest (Ditix, 1983 ). Hybridization techniques are widely exploited and allow you to enter different genes governing interesting characters in plants. Today there is no conclusive theory about the non-additive gene interactions exploited in commercial hybridization, which lead to sobremanifestaciónhybrids compared to parents in terms of growth, vitality, fertility, adaptability to the environment occurand other characters and qualities, which have been designated by the name of heterosis (Rodriguez et al., 1987). Marquez (1988) suggests that hybridization in plants is genotechnique method takes advantage from the F1 generation cross between two parental populations P1 andP2, which may be inbred lines, open pollinated varieties or synthetic varieties. Gomez (1985) states that tobegin a plan forobtaining hybrid is required above all to have knowledge about the biology of the species with which they work and how genetic inheritance of those characters with whom you want to give new genotypes. Achieving these hybrids to marketing implies the following steps (Fig.1).\n\n3. The importance of the collection of plant material lies in the need for the builder to have enough genetic variability; for it is necessary to have a collection with wide variability in their genotypes, including indigenous varieties and improved varieties. Postormente proceeds to the characterization of the different genotypes, considering the characteristics of agronomic interest. Once they characterized proceed to the choice of the parents to make the crossings; once we proceed to seed comparing hybrids obtained with commercial hybrids; after completion of the comparison those who show little interest eliminated. Genetic basis of disease resistance Although since ancient times was the knowledge that the varieties differed in their attitude to withstand the disease, it was not used until the nineteenth century, when the first programs to produce varieties (Allard, 1970) were designed. LozanoandSchawrts (1981) andDe Pontii Buddenhagen (1983) note that in recent years the development ofresistant strains have been recognized in the Caribbean as the most common and economical means of disease control. Improved resistance to pests and diseases is a special aspect of breeding and plays an important role in the production from the economic point of view, especially in tropical countries where these concepts losses are substantial (De Armas, 1985) .Van the Plank (1968) it notes that resistance may be monogenic (resistance governed by a single gene) and polygenic (governed by more resistance genes); further states that the terms \"major genes\" and \"minor genes\" are used instead of oligogenic and polygenic. Methods of breeding for disease resistance. Application of molecular biology work breeding for resistance is a lot of dedication andhard work, there are various methods used forimplementation once there is knowledge of the presence on the ground of resistance genes. Allard (1970) cited by De Armas (1985) notes that when resistance genes found in commercial varieties, the easiest and best means for resistant varieties is selection within those varieties. When it is not convenient resistance in commercial varieties, but in types that are not used for their agronomic traits inadequate methods are generally used forimprovement or genealogical retro crossing improvement. If the progenitor is a type resistant unsuitable logically choose the retro crossover as improvement method Breeding Process In the specific case of Cucumis species melo L despite being a alógama plant from the point of view of genetic improvement is handled as a self-pollinating plant, preventing the free breeding of this species through the seal of the flowers, since Thus further progress occurs in breeding programs."
