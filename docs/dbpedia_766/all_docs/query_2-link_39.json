        "text": "To build the foundational skills your students require to become proficient in simulation application, we offer expressive learning resources that simplify the technical process involved with simulation. Simio offers resources for all experience levels. These resources include lesson plans and courses for beginners, and refresher courses for educators who may have some simulation experience.\n\nSimio’s teaching resources are designed to help educators learn while teaching something new to your students. Therefore, Simio lesson plans consist of simplified test books, presentations, lab materials and sample problems which can be used to develop fully-fledged coursework for your students. Simio also provides access to online classes which institutions can incorporate into their curriculum and online learning systems or programs.\n\nSimio offers no-cost academic licenses for faculty, researchers and students through Academic Grants. The grants ensure educators can provide hands-on educational instructions to students through both physical and virtual classrooms. Simio software also makes accessing team projects from diverse locations possible for your students. This ensures everyone can participate in lab sessions and practical learning regardless of a student’s location.\n\nSimio Software is a best-in-class tool for simulation and Digital Twin development. The software provides educators with an intuitive user-interface and the modern tools needed to teach and solve complex simulation problems. With the Simio academic license, you can easily plan and execute laboratory coursework and get everyone involved with the learning process.\n\nSimio Academic Software provides the supporting features and tools needed to teach discrete, continuous and agent-based simulation, including their nuances, to students. The software integrates 3D modeling, the use of 3D models and animation to ensure simulation concepts and results are easily understood by first-time users. The interactive capabilities of Simio 3D models and animations can also be the catalyst you need to captivate and keep your students engaged when teaching the technical aspects of simulation.\n\nOur new Academic Case Study Program is a re-imagining of the student competition but with a specific goal of helping participants with their understanding and application of modeling. The Academic Case Study Program is a semi-annual release of instructional material formulated around an assignment, with teaching materials provided to support students in their investigation, as well as suggested solutions for the assignment. The program is offered in the Fall and Spring of each academic year, and students have online access to course materials throughout the year."
