M. bovis has been identified in buffalo, bison, sheep, goats, horses, camels, pigs, wild boars, deer, antelopes, dogs, cats, foxes, minks, badgers, ferrets, rats, primates, llamas, cud√∫es, elanes, tapirs, elk, elephants, sitatungas, orices, addaxes, rhinos, opossums, ground squirrels, otters, seals, hares, moles, raccoons, coyotes and various feline predators such as the lion, the tiger, the leopard or the lynx.\n\nThe name of \"tuberculosis\" that he received from the nodules, called \"tubers\", which they form in the lymph nodes of the affected animal. It is an important zoonosis (can be transmitted to humans) and is a mandatory declaration disease.\n\nThe species of Scolytinae subfamily have a worldwide distribution, and are found mainly in the Neo-tropic regions.

They usually dominate the communities of wood borer insects. The aim of the present study was to determine the diversity among Scolytinae species associated with balsa, teak, rubber and gamhar plantations located in the humid tropical zone of the Ecuadorian littoral. In each plantation seven flight interception traps containing an ethanol / gel mixture were installed, with a collection frequency of 15 days for three months in the dry period. A total of 1437 specimens were collected, represented by Xyleborini, Cryphalini, Corthylini and Ipini tribes. In the four plantations, 18 species of Scolitids were collected, of which 16 were recorded in the balsa plantation, while in the other plantations 10 to 12 species were found. The most abundant Scolitids were Hypothenemus spp., Corthylus spp., Xyleborus affinis, Xyleborinus bicornatulus and Premnobium cavipennis.

Regulatory function of TFs play an important role in plant biological processes and mechanisms. They may interconnect with other transcription factors or functional genes to modulate their expression in response to an internal/external factor like life cycle stage, growth, development and stress. Arabidopsis is the well-known and the most used model organism. Transcription factors of three Arabidopsis species including A. halleri, A. lyrata and A. thaliana, were compared. basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH) with 220 TFs was the most abundant family among three Arabidopsis species while MYB and MYB related families considering as a whole group were more than bHLH with 308 TFs. No STERILE APETALA (SAP) TF homolog was found for A.halleri. The common transcription factors among three species were 4,172 grouped in 1,212 clusters. The species-specific clustered TFs were 12, 30 and 58 for A. halleri, A. lyrata and A. t...\n\nTranscription factors (TF) are the elements, which regulate gene expression.
