You can compare the information in this report with the trends in your competitors’ patent filings and technologies, and use it to search for important patents.\n\nThis service provides, free of charge, a patent analysis report based on the latest patent data (Japanese, U.S., European, and PCT application publications) for use in patent searches, patent analysis, and IP landscaping. The service is offered by \"Patent Integration\" a firm specializing in patent search/patent analysis.\n\nThis report includes basic information to help you understand the IP strategy and management of UNIVERSIDAD%20T%C3%89CNICA%20ESTATAL%20DE%20QUEVEDO, such as changes in the number of patents/patent applications they have filed, comparisons of the numbers of patents/patent applications filed by their peers and competitors, their top coapplicants (joint research partners, alliance partners), and their most important patents. It can be used in various intellectual property business operations such as IP landscaping, patent search/patent analysis, preparation of intellectual property business evaluation reports, selection of M&A candidates, and selection of alliance partners.\n\nArticle supervised by: Yoshiyuki Ose (Japanese Patent Attorney)\n\nHe is a patent attorney at a patent office. He specializes in invention counseling, patent filing, and intellectual property strategies for start-up companies and new businesses in the fields of software, information technology and artificial intelligence. He runs a patent course for beginners on Udemy, an online course provider.\n\nAfter studying physics at the University of Tokyo as a doctoral student, he was engaged in intellectual property analysis and technology trend research as an in-house patent attorney at a precision equipment manufacturer and at Toyota Central R&D Labs. Inc..\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concept of the \"IP landscape\" (IPL) has been attracting attention recently.\n\nAn IP landscape is not limited to patent information, but also integrates and analyzes business information (e.g., non-patent information such as papers, news releases, stock information, and market information). Intellectual-property-based business management is realized through the analysis of intellectual property information applied to the formulation of management strategies and business strategies. This is a comprehensive approach that includes but not limited to planning of open and closed strategies, selecting M&A candidates, searching for alliance partners, and formulating intellectual property strategies, through the exploitation of intellectual property information.\n\nIP landscaping usually includes patent search and patent analysis. In patent search and patent analysis, it is important to grasp the market position of each company and the overall technological trends and development trends for each technology. More specifically, it is important to understand what intellectual property your own company and other companies hold, what the strengths and weaknesses of other companies are, and how other companies are trying to exploit their intellectual property. In other words, it is important to understand both the business strategy and the intellectual property strategy of each company.\n\nAfter reading this search report, you may be interested in more detailed patent searches and patent analysis. We offer a service called Patent Integration, which is an integrated patent search and patent analysis service. With reasonable pricing and a simple user interface such that even beginners can quickly search for and analyze patent information by company or technology from a web browser, please consider using it for detailed patent searches, patent analysis, and IP landscaping.\n\nPatent Integration has a patent-landscaping function that can visually represent a set of tens of thousands of patents/patent applications. This allows you to convincingly show the technical positions of your company and its competitors to your management and business strategists in order to formulate management strategies and business strategies.\n\nForeign Patent Analysis Report\n\nBy clicking, you can check the patent application trends in each country of UNIVERSIDAD%20T%C3%89CNICA%20ESTATAL%20DE%20QUEVEDO.\n\nPatent Filing Trends in Each Country\n\nForeign Patent Analysis Report\n\nThe following foreign patent analysis reports have been found for UNIVERSIDAD%20T%C3%89CNICA%20ESTATAL%20DE%20QUEVEDO.

The unit of count is the number of applications, not the number of patent families.\n\nAbout the name collation and name control of applicants and right holders\n\nCompany rankings are based on the results calculated by \"Patent Integration\", with Japanese organizations in Japanese and other companies in English (some are in Japanese).\n\nCompany names may be the names of the companies at the time of application, but the results calculated by Patent Integration are used as is. Company names are used as they were at the time of application.\n\nBecause of the fluctuation in the names of companies (i.e., applicant/right holder names in the patent information), there are cases where the same company appears more than once in the top 10. The number of applications filed by the same company in the top 10 is the total number of applications filed by the company.\n\nCredit notation\n\n・MeCab user dictionary for science technology term © National Bioscience Database Center licensed under CC Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nOur Commitment to Safety and Security\n\nPatent Integration Co., Ltd. is committed to providing high-quality patent information based on the latest patent data on more than 45 million cases collected from the Patent Offices in Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan and from PCT publication.\n\nPatent Integration Co., Ltd. collects the patent data from the Patent Offices in Japan, the U.S., Europe, and Taiwan and from PCT publications to provide it widely in the form of reports so that anyone can check patent information and patent trends with confidence.\n\nPatent Integration Co., Ltd. is committed to various efforts to enhance the reliability of the information and to allow users to search patent information with confidence."
