        "text": "POUGHKEEPSIE â€” \"I am F2M,\" explains the protagonist in Patricia Wettig's play \"F2M,\" being presented by Vassar & New York Stage and Film Powerhouse Theater. Further clarification reveals that this describes a person who, though born a woman, feels that she is actually male and born into the wrong body.\n\nHillary Swank turned in an Oscar-winning performance in the 1999 movie \"Boys Don't Cry\" portraying real-life Brandon Teena, a transgender F2M. In Wettig's play Parker is not trying to hide as Teena was. Parker is trying to deal with her/his confusion and frustrations openly.\n\nWhen we meet Parker (Keira Keeley), it is parents' weekend at the college that Parker attends. Parker is living with girlfriend Lucy (Phoebe Strole) and meeting Lucy's mother, Linda Lou (Deirdre O'Connell), for the first time.\n\nAfter Parker has a promising session with a transgender therapist, Dr. Shelton (Harriett D. Foy), Parker's famous parents Ali (Talia Balsam) and Clarence (Ken Olin) arrive unannounced at the college. A party at which everyone except the therapist is present takes place with explosive results.\n\nWettig's characters are finely drawn and richly defined. Each performer has a moment where true feelings are exposed and depth of character is revealed.\n\nThe only character who seems comfortable with who he or she is is Linda Lou. O'Connell is a brilliant comedian as she tells wonderful rambling stories about her pet bird. Further, she is credible when treading through the currents of confusing relationships and family dynamics.\n\nFoy as Dr. Shelton has the correct demeanor and tone as Parker's therapist. Strole brings a youthful and engaging quality to Lucy as she supports Parker.\n\nAs Ali West, famous actress, wife to Clarence and mother to Parker, Balsam is believable. There is no doubt that she is worried and doing her best to keep the lines of communication open. Ali's frustration is palpable during the constant verbal battles between Parker and Clarence. But when she defends her child or argues with her husband, Balsam shows an air of weary resignation rather than fierce determination.\n\nOlin's Clarence is a force with which to be reckoned. Every nuance of this high-powered, high-energy producer is brought to light in Olin's expert hands. He energizes his every scene.\n\nKeira Keeley has the daunting task of portraying Parker, a complex, temperamental, bewildered young person. Keeley achieves all of that flawlessly. Under Maria Mileaf's direction and in Keeley's portrayal, Parker is as unlikable as likable but never dull.\n\n\"F2M\" deals with disconcerting, unsettling and perplexing situations and circumstances. After one experiences this play, transgender issues may be less ambiguous but by no means clear.\n\nWhat: \"F2M\" by Patricia Wettig Where: Powerhouse Theater, Vassar College, 124 Raymond Ave., Poughkeepsie When: 8 p.m. July 6-9, 2 p.m. July 9-10 Admission: $35 Call: 437-5599 Visit: powerhouse.vassar.edu\n\nIf you go ..."
