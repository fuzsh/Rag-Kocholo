        "text": "American actor (born 1954)\n\nNot to be confused with Ken Olandt.\n\nKenneth Edward Olin (born July 30, 1954) is an American actor, television director, and producer. As an actor, Olin is known for his role as Michael Steadman in the ABC drama series Thirtysomething (1987–1991), for which he received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama nomination in 1990. Olin later began working behind the scenes, as a director and producer. His credits as a producer include Alias (2001–2006), Brothers & Sisters (2006–2011), and This Is Us (2016–2022). Olin is married to actress Patricia Wettig.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nOlin made several guest appearances on episodic primetime TV in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His first series regular role was on the short-lived NBC comedy-drama Bay City Blues in 1983. He later joined the cast of NBC police drama Hill Street Blues playing Detective Harry Garibaldi from 1984 to 1985, and from 1985 to 1986 co-starred on the CBS prime time soap opera Falcon Crest as Father Christopher Rossini. Olin also guest-starred on Murder, She Wrote and Hotel before he was cast as Michael Steadman, one of the lead roles in the ABC drama series Thirtysomething. Debuting in 1987, the series received critical acclaim, setting a new bar for realism in the realm of prime-time drama.[1] For his performance, Olin was nominated for Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama in 1990.[2]\n\nIn 1996, Olin played a leading role in the short-lived CBS crime drama EZ Streets. From 1998 to 1999, he played the leading role in another short-lived CBS series, medical drama L.A. Doctors. He appeared along with wife Patricia Wettig in the 1995 television film Nothing But the Truth, and well as in Telling Secrets (1993) with Cybill Shepherd, The Advocate's Devil (1997) alongside Mariska Hargitay, and Evolution's Child (1999). His film credits include roles in Ghost Story (1981), Queens Logic (1991), and 'Til There Was You (1997).\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, Olin had a recurring role opposite wife Patricia Wettig in the ABC drama series Brothers & Sisters. From 2015 to 2017, he had a recurring role in the CBS drama series, Zoo. In 2020, ABC ordered a sequel for Thirtysomething and Olin was set to return alongside Mel Harris, Timothy Busfield and Patricia Wettig; however, the project remains in development limbo. [3]\n\nProducing and directing\n\n[edit]\n\nOlin directed six episodes of Thirtysomething. He also directed television movies The Broken Cord (1992), Doing Time on Maple Drive (1992), In Pursuit of Honor (1995) and Phenomenon II (2003), as well as White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf (1994) for Buena Vista Pictures.[4] He directed episodes of L.A. Doctors, Judging Amy, Felicity, The West Wing, 23 episodes of Alias, 20 episodes of Brothers & Sisters, Sleepy Hollow, and 20 episodes of This Is Us.\n\nOlin has been an executive producer on several television dramas, starting with the ABC action drama Alias (2001-2006). From 2006 to 2011, he was a producer on ABC's family drama Brothers & Sisters, and also appeared on a recurring basis.[5] His wife, Patricia Wettig, was also a regular cast member on the show. In the summer of 1990, Olin directed Wettig in a production of \"My Mother Said I Never Should\" at the Powerhouse Theatre at Vassar College.[6]\n\nHis other credits include Breaking News (2002), The Mob Doctor (2012-2013) and Sleepy Hollow. In 2016, he began producing NBC's family drama This Is Us, which received four Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series nominations during its run.[7]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOlin was born to a Jewish family[8] in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a former Peace Corps official and pharmaceutical company owner.[9] He was raised in Highland Park, Illinois. He graduated from The Putney School in Putney, Vermont, in 1972.[10] He then completed his college career at the University of Pennsylvania. He is married to thirtysomething co-star, Patricia Wettig, with whom he has a son, Clifford, and a daughter, Roxanne, who appeared on The City.[11]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nas Actor\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1978 The Paper Chase Timothy \"The Man Who Would Be King\" 1979 Women at West Point Board Member TV movie 1981 Ghost Story Young Sears James 1983–84 Bay City Blues Rock Padillo series regular (8 episodes) 1984 Flight 90: Disaster on the Potomac David Frank TV movie 1984–85 Hill Street Blues Detective Harry Garibaldi recurring role (29 episodes) 1985–86 Falcon Crest Father Christopher series regular (17 episodes) 1986 There Must Be a Pony Jay Savage TV movie 1986 Murder, She Wrote Perry Revere \"Deadline for Murder\" 1987 Tonight's the Night Henry Fox TV movie 1987 I'll Take Manhattan Nat Lammerman Miniseries 1987 Hotel Mark Fredricks \"Class of '72\" 1987 The Hitchhiker Steve \"Best Shot\" 1987–91 thirtysomething Michael Steadman series regular (85 episodes)\n\nNominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series — Drama (1990)[12]\n\nNominated – Viewers for Quality Television Award for Best Actor in a Quality Drama Series (1991) 1988 A Stoning in Fulham County Jim Sandler TV movie 1988 Police Story: Cop Killer Officer Manny Mandell TV movie 1990 Goodnight Sweet Wife: A Murder in Boston Charles Stuart TV movie 1991 Queens Logic Ray 1993 Telling Secrets Detective Jay Jensen TV movie 1995 Nothing But the Truth Doctor Peter Clayman TV movie 1995 Dead by Sunset Brad Cunningham Miniseries 1996–97 EZ Streets Detective Cameron Quinn series regular (12 episodes) 1997 'Till There Was You Gregory 1997 The Advocate's Devil Abe Ringel TV movie 1998–99 L.A.
