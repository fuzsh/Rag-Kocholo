        "text": "So I hate to break it to non Justin fans… this was another Justin filled episode.\n\nLast episode ended with Rebecca running into Justin’s arms when Holly couldn’t remember who she was again. Holly also disappeared. Rebecca ended up spending the night with Justin. Justin is over course ecstatic, but Rebecca isn’t so sure. They get a call from David who alerts them that Holly is missing.\n\nWhere does Holly end up going to? William’s house. Only problem is William is dead as Nora tries to rationally explain to Holly. Holly’s story line is really the most tragic this season because honestly Kitty doesn’t seem to be too depressed. She’s too busy kissing Jack the handyman. Well, I shouldn’t say that. She’s confused after she kisses him and calls it just an instinct. After all, Robert was just buried.\n\nNora and David end up taking Holly to the hospital. Both Justin and Rebecca meet up with them. Rebecca has some alone time with Nora and explains because Nora is her mom figure since Holly, her own mother can’t remember or can’t feel anything toward her own daughter. Nora gets excited when she learns hat Justin and Rebecca spent the night together and might be trying to work things out. Rebecca explains she still loves Justin so much, but she’s trying to find herself like Justin found himself when he went back to war. Nora thinks Rebecca should do what’s right for her.\n\nWhat is Rebecca’s plan: to got to New York. She submitted a photography portfolio and got a job with Tribeca Magazine.\n\nThe other Walkers not tied into the Holly issue are busying making costumes for Cooper’s “Romeo and Juliet” play. Sarah is making the costumes because she is trying to suck up to the other moms who have connections to an elite school for Cooper. Luc can’t understand why she’s trying so hard. It’s like she’s having a second fake personality for these moms. Kevin, Scotty, Saul and Saul’s friend Charlie come over to help her sew these very intricate costumes for a kid play.\n\nKevin and Scotty want Saul to make Charlie his boyfriend because Saul really likes him. The only problem is Saul hasn’t told Charlie about being HIV positive. When Saul tells him, Charlie lets him down. He just had a boyfriend for 20 years who was HIV positive. The last ten years were the worst for him. He doesn’t want to go through that again. Poor Saul, but like Kevin and Scotty said he should keep on trying to find someone who will be okay with it.\n\nI’m so happy that Cooper had an episode because I missed seeing that little kid. We have seen a lot of Paige in these past couple of episodes and honestly were was Cooper’s awesome story line? His story line was cute: He being Romeo didn’t want to kiss Juliet because eww she’s a girl. Luc tells him it’s just a kiss, but if he really wants it to mean something, he must feel it from his heart.\n\nDuring the actual play, Cooper gives his Juliet a big kiss. It was so cute and funny! The only people that didn’t approve were the moms that Sarah was trying to impress. Sarah confronts them at the end and says what horrible people they are then she left with her hot french man.\n\nFinally the worst part of the episode, Rebecca goes to sit with her mother. She tries to connect with Holly. Holly is sick of people telling her about their perfect relationships they had with her. Rebecca She talks about Holly’s first husband Daniel who died in the war. Holly says I must have loved you if I told you about David, what can’t I feel anything now? This of course the factoring decision as to why Rebecca heads back to New York.\n\nNow Rebecca must tell Justin…\n\nThey begin by comparing themselves to Coopers play which they missed…\n\n“Too bad we missed it… it’s our play… two star crossed lovers” in relation how it was for a long time between Holly and Nora and how they were enemies. They somehow made it work.\n\nJustin: “We have a chance to make it right”\n\nRebecca: “You grew up so much, I need that so much… this is my chance, I have to go.”\n\nJustin tries to act all strong when Rebbeca leaves, but he breaks down when Norah confronts him. So sad! Hopefully Justin can move on. Oh wait…he does I heard about how Dave Annable’s wife Odette is coming on to play a love interest for him. That’s one thing the Walkers are good at… moving\n\nRebecaa, Emily Vancamp’s last scene was very nicely done I thought. We see Holly and David at a cafe. Suddenly the screen jutters between foucs and out of focus. I of course had no idea what was going on… it turned out it was mirroring Rebecca’s camera. Camera takes one last shot of them, smiles and walks away.\n\n“Faking It” has a lot of the Walkers faking something. Sarah is faking her age. Justin is faking his marriage. Kitty is faking her name. Norah is also faking her age. Sadly, the only one not faking it is Holly.\n\nSarah thinks Luc thinks it’s her 40 birthday. When she first meet him in France she thought it would be a fling and lied about her age. Now that he stuck around, she’s in a bit of a fix. Sarah tries this whole episode to avoid her brothers and sister from spilling the beans on how old she really is. Luc is planning a birthday party and she tells them all to not come. Kitty finds an excuse, Kevin can’t because the birthday part is at Scotty’s restaurant.\n\nKitty’s excuse: Kitty is staying up in Ojai trying to find her self. She wants to know what her real reason is to live. Turns out not to be cooking or living in the country. From the heart Kitty is a city girl with a blue tooth phone and all. This is why she lies when handyman Jack comes over to fix her faucet. She says her name is Leslie Callpepper, the woman whose house she is renting.\n\nThis goes smoothly until Kevin shows up at her door. Kevin pretends to be her hick neighbor. He sets up an excuse for Kitty not to show up, but to cook dinner for Jack. Kitty ends up picking the toughest thing to make… a soufflé.\n\nMeanwhile back in the city, Nora hates her job and feels so odd because of all the young people. She runs into an old friend who says plastic surgery will do wonders for that attitude. Nora thinks about this for the whole episode and includes Sara with this idea to get rid of a few wrinkles. In the end, Nora ends up finding an easier solution. She quits her job at Zoe’s Florist shop and says she’ll find a job that wants all her years of experience. My question is what happened to Nora’s charity work? Did Narrow Lake deplete all of her money? Also what happened to Zeke Phillip’s offer for a talk radio show? Hopefully episode 4 will catch us up eventually…\n\nThe biggest story line and no, I’m not showing favoritism because I love Justin is the Justin/Rebecca/Holly triangle. Not a love triangle.. that would be weird. This episode is the first episode we see Rebecca. I forgot she worked at Maddox Foods. David stops by to talk to Rebecca and tells her it might be okay to try again to speak with Holly. She asks why the sudden change? David tells her Justin has been by talking to Holly.\n\nThis make Rebecca go straight to Justin’s house or really just to the front door. She won’t go inside the house. She only asks Justin what he told Holly. Justin told Holly about how they fell in love. He tells Rebbecca to come in, but she won’t.\n\nWhat does Justin end up doing? Repainting the turquoise color that Rebecca picked out a gray color. He is stuck choosing between elephant ear and rainy sundays. Saul finds him repainting and asks why? Justin explains the fear he saw in her eyes. “I know she was scared. She saw something she wants and she know she can’t have. I know that expression.” Justin finally tells the biggest secret of them all…. he and Rebecca have been divorced for awhile now ever since he was deployed in Afghanistan.\n\nJustin and Saul are late to Sarah’s “40th” birthday party. They get there to see Kevin, Nora and Sarah are on the phone with Kitty who is making a soufelle which ends up slowly dying. As Saul lets slip that Justin and Rebecca are divorced, Luc and Scotty come out with a cake. Justin remarks that Sarah hasn’t been 40 for a while. This ends the dinner party. Later Luc laughs with Sarah. He knew how old she was a long time ago because he saw her driver’s liscense. He said in France, they don’t care about age.\n\nWhen Rebecca goes to see her mother, it seems to be going okay. They seem to be discussing Rebecca’s love for dance when as the conversation goes on, Rebecca realizes that Holly still has no idea who she is. Example: Holly asks why do you keep on calling me mom? Rebecca leave the house quickly, leaving Holly very confused.\n\nRebecca returns to Justin’s house, actually goes inside and goes to him, crying about her mother. She suddenly decides she can’t stay. “I can’t trust you, Justin.” Justin responded, “I’ve changed. I’m not the same as I was last year. You can’t know, but you can let me prove it to you. You know why I haven’t told anyone about the divorce, because you haven’t either. You haven’t given up on us.” Rebecca tries to leave and says she must get home. Justin says a bit sadly, “Rebecca, you are home.” They kiss… will it last? Probably not… Bittersweet in a way then.\n\nThis episode ends in a cliffhanger when David realizes that Holly is no longer home, she has left the house. This wouldn’t be a big deal, but in her state… it’ a serious matter!\n\nOne quote at the end of the episode really sums up whatever was doing during this episode… once again Nora Walker is the owner of the quote. Each piece of the quote is directed at each of her children.\n\nTo Kevin: “Kevin, who are you? When did you become so cynical and hard hearted that you would leave that boy in jail? when any fool would know he didn’t break into the restaruant for the moeny… he’s all alone in the world, he doesn’t have any one to take care of him. He broke into the restuarnt hoping you would find him and help him…”\n\n-Remember Mateo? The case that Kevin was working on in the first episode, well he came back to surprise Nora when she went over to Scotty and Saul’s restaurant. He broke on and Kevin angry at him, wanted to get rid him. Mateo ends up getting arrested a little bit later and Mateo lets him sit in jail. Nora is annoyed and told Kevin, Mateo was gong to Kevin because he was looking for help. In the end Kevin and Scotty help find Mateo’s Abuela who hasn’t seen in a while.\n\nTo Justin: “And Justin, if you wants to save your marraaige, you have to start acting like a husband. A good husband takes care of his wife’s family even when she can’t.”\n\nWhile at the party ( what party? I get to that in Sarah’s little section) Sarah tells Justin to find a nice girl. Justin gets annoyed, he’s still married. Nora really doesn’t think he is acting like a husband. Even if he can’t get to Rebecca, he can help Holly. This is what Justin ends up doing. He ignores David’s request to leave him and his family alone and sit and speaks with Holly about Rebecca.\n\nTo Kitty: “Living in limbo and trying to avoid the furture isn’t going to help help you one little bit netiher is inventing a fictional life for your mother. You need to take the first painful steps of your new life. They don’t have to be big or profound, they just need to be something, honey.”\n\nKitty’s story bothered me a little bit. She didn’t really seem that depress as the other characters were letting on about burying her husband. Kitty seemed to be preoccupied with uncovering a secret of her mothers. After seeing her mother speak on the phone quietly, disappear randomly and follows her to a woman’s house, Kitty thinks her mom is a lesbian. Mayhem ensues when she tells her sibling this. By far I love Justin and Scotty’s response. When Nora enters the picture, she thinks they know about her job. Both sides are confused by what they are talking about. Only until the end when Nora says she needs the money, does it become clear that she is not a lesbian.\n\nTo Sarah: “I’m not going skip you. What on earth were you think of bringing Paige to this party? She doesn’t need you to be her friend, she needs you to be her mother. Unlock the damn door, go in there, clean her up and take her home.”\n\nFinally I can tell you about the party… The part is an advertisement campaign for the Luc because Luc has become a sexy underwear model. Sarah allows Paige to attend the party because she believes this will make her teenage daughter like her more. Paige is trying to find a position in her life to be in the “it crowd”. Paige ends up breaking off ties with her friend Agie because Agie is too childish. At the party, Paige meets the daughter of a plastic surgeon. The daughter ends up getting them both getting drunk which lends Paige in the bathroom, puking her brains out. In the end Paige is friends again with Agie because Agie doesn’t desert her when Sarah grounds her. My only question is… where is Cooper? I hate when children actors just disappear. I understand why it happens though.\n\n“Why are you all standing around her? You have things to do.. go.”\n\nAs the Walkers split up, Nora goes to get a drink and meets Zeke Phillips, a talk radio show producer. He has an interest in Nora ad the advice she just spewed out to her children.\n\nSide note: Nora tells Kitty to find somewhere to go, to rent.. to find herself. Kitty finds a place in Ojai to find herself.\n\nThis is the passage that Nora gives to Kitty to read about finding her way. It’s from Walden with a couple editorial marks thanks to Nora."
