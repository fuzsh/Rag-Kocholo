        "text": "“Real Housewives of Atlanta” alum Kim Zolciak and husband Kroy Biermann have slashed the price (again) on their Milton, GA, mansion—this time by $250,000 for a new ask of $3,950,000.\n\nThe estranged couple are parting ways after 12 years of marriage, and they managed to delay foreclosure on their home by 90 days. According to TMZ, they face a deadline of late August to sell the home before the bank steps in.\n\nThe seven-bedroom residence, about 30 miles north of Atlanta, was listed last fall for $6 million. The price dropped in December to $5.5 million and fell again by another $1 million at the beginning of 2024. In June, the price was cut to $4.2 million. And with this latest reduction, they’re hoping to swing a deal before the home is foreclosed.\n\nThe pair purchased the property in 2012 for $880,000.\n\nEven after the discounts, the former couple’s asking price is at the top of the market for the area. There are 282 homes on the market in Milton, which has a median home listing price of $1.45 million, according to Realtor.com®.\n\nBut the Zolciak-Biermann home is huge: 15,694 square feet on 1.7 acres. Built in 2008, the ornate brick and stone estate is adjacent to a golf course; it overlooks a lake and the 18th fairway.\n\nBeyond the lavish interior, the grounds feature a vanishing-edge pool and outdoor living spaces. The grand entry boasts a circular driveway and motor court that lead to a dramatic, curved staircase and a two-story foyer inside.\n\nHighlights include a glam formal dining room, wood-lined study crowned with a glitzy chandelier, and multiple spaces for entertaining.\n\nThe gourmet kitchen is anchored by an oversized island and a causal eating area.\n\nIn the family room nearby, a vaulted ceiling and fireplace await. The primary suite is also on the main level.\n\nAmenities include a second kitchen on the terrace level; a 500-bottle, climate-controlled, walk-in wine cellar; a billiard room; an arcade game room; a home theater; and a gym with a private massage room.\n\nThe home’s in-law suite includes a kitchen and sitting room. Meanwhile, a six-car garage rounds out the listing."
