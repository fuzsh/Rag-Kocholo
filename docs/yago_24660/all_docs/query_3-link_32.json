        "text": "If you’re searching for new things to watch, consider something old. “Thirtysomething” is a drama series consisting of eighty-five episodes. It aired from 1987-1991 on ABC. The show was revolutionary for its time, and won thirteen Primetime Emmy Awards, out of forty-one nominations, and two Golden Globe Awards. Thirty-five years after its debut, I became a fan.\n\nAll subjects are touched on\n\nThe show comes close to defining the now common genre of dramedy. Set in a Philadelphia suburb, the series revolves around the lives of an ensemble cast of young adults as they navigate the issues present in that time. Issues like toxic masculinity, women in the workforce, China taking over, rapidly changing technology, dating, marriage, and kids; all subjects are touched on.\n\nIt’s a character driven show, and from the start, we the viewer really like and relate well with the players involved. Unlike most programs, “Thirtysomething” doesn’t sets its focus on college-aged models. The cast and characters are – spoiler alert – adults in their 30s.\n\nMichael and Hope Steadman (Ken Olin and Mel Harris) are new parents when the series begins. Michael co-owns an advertising business, and walks the line between being an individual and basking the want of becoming a yuppie. Hope struggles with raising a newborn while still feeling important. A component early on is her desire to go back to work, and how to effectively balance both realms. Elliot (Timothy Busfield) is Michael’s partner at the advertising firm. He’s married to Nancy (Patricia Wettig) and they deal with more complex relationship issues.\n\nFriends are complete with free spirit Melissa (Melanie Mayron), cynical Ellyn (Polly Draper) and manchild bachelor Greg (Peter Horton). In the first episode, Greg is seen openly crying at Michael’s wedding. Not out of joy, but fear of his best friend growing up. Greg is easily my favorite character. The gang is so relatable, you’ll easily envision yourself somewhere in the mix.\n\n“Thirtysomething” was the hip show in 1987\n\nBefore ‘Ally McBeal’ or ‘Family Guy’ it uses weird flashbacks and over the top daydreams to convey the story. It’s almost cartoonish and I can’t imagine anyone watching in 1987 would have been expecting it. It’s funny and represents the pre-90s in an excellent way.\n\nWatching, I gained an appreciation for the history of the time. Its one year after the Challenger disaster. Ronald Reagan is the president. The characters are all Baby Boomers – born in the early 1950s. They grew up during the tumultuous times of the 60s and 70s. They experience their own variety of problems, many of which are issues we still have today. In that aspect, it’s quite realistic.\n\nIf you are looking for something new to watch, or a stroll down a familiar lane, I recommend “Thirtysomething.” It’s what they called entertainment in the days before dragons and high octane thrillers. It’s a good show and a fascinating peek into yesteryear.\n\n“Thirtysomething” is available to stream and on DVD."
