(Thanks to Chris \"or maybe it was Marshall Herskovitz and Susan Shilliday's kids\" Ryerson for this.)\n\nFrom Alicia (?) regarding Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig appearing on the Rosie O'Donnell show in the winter of 1999:\n\nPatricia was explaining how her son, who is now 16, was 3 at the time and he was going into preschool for the first time and she was with him and looking around for other kids for him to connect with, and there was one little girl there, who spoke really proper, so Pat was thinking that was the girl for her son to be playing with!"
