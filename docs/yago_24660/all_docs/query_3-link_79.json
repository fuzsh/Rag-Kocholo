        "text": "First things first: “thirtysomething: The Complete First Season” will be released on DVD on Tuesday, with subsequent seasons expected to follow in six-month intervals.\n\nThis is good news - huge news, in some cases - for the legions of fans who have been bemoaning the Emmy-kissed drama’s absence on DVD shelves. Internet forums have been ablaze for years about the show’s future on DVD.\n\nIt also is good news for cast members who, after nearly two decades, continue to get grilled about a DVD release.\n\n“People ask me constantly. Constantly. They’ve been asking about it for years,” said Polly Draper, who played Ellyn on the show.\n\n“You can’t imagine,” noted Timothy Busfield, who played Elliot. “My first reaction [to the DVD release] was I can finally answer all those people who have been asking me, ‘When is it coming out on DVD?’ ”\n\nRemembered as much for its music as its much-ballyhooed writing, “thirtysomething” ran into licensing issues for that music as creators considered releasing the series on DVD. Draper contends much of the show’s charm came from its soundtrack, which included music by Ray Charles, Rickie Lee Jones and other well-known artists.\n\nBack then, the notion of TV shows reproduced on DVD wasn’t on the radar, so navigating the rights to use the copyrighted music on current reproductions is tricky, said Bruce Nachbar, a producer for “The Wonder Years,” another popular show that used heavy doses of popular music (its theme was Joe Cocker’s version of “A Little Help From My Friends”).\n\n“The Wonder Years” ran from 1988 to 1993, but it has not been released on DVD. Bootlegs can be found on the Internet, and Nachbar suspects they are VCR recordings converted to DVD.\n\n“I would love to see it on DVD. I just married a Japanese woman who has never seen it,” he said of “The Wonder Years.”\n\nBusfield said he is thrilled to see “thirtysomething” finally on DVD because there are episodes he has never seen. He saw rough cuts, he said, but the show aired at 10 p.m., and he had to be up by 5 a.m. to shoot. Often, he said, he would see snippets after his wife would watch it in bed and nudge him awake.\n\nMelanie Mayron, who played Melissa on “thirtysomething,” said she was ecstatic to hear of the DVD’s release. She said she can’t wait to show episodes to friends and family members - including her two children - who have never seen the show.\n\nOcala resident Adriana Rosas was a huge fan of “The Wonder Years” and, especially, “thirtysomething.” Mayron’s character, a fiery, single photographer, was a favorite for Rosas, who watched the show in college.\n\n“She was independent. She was on her own. She was having dating issues,” Rosas recalled. “For a female in college, [‘thirtysomething’] was very inspiring. The female characters were strong women.”\n\n“Thirtysomething” focused on a web of career-minded friends in Philadelphia in the 1980s. They were constantly reflecting on their lives and problems and relationships, and the characters became synonymous with the self-obsessed yuppie generation.\n\nProducers were aware of the characters’ reputations, Draper said, and they toned down the whiny and amped up the humor during the second season. The formula clicked, as the show won 13 Emmy Awards - and one People’s Choice Award - in its four seasons.\n\nIn addition to negotiating music rights, releasing the show on DVD also was delayed by a lack of master copies that would allow easy transfer to a digital format, according to an April report in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nL.A.-based Shout! Factory was instrumental in overcoming both issues and will serve as distributor for the DVD series. The result is a set that will include all of the music, as well as cast interviews and other extras.\n\n“We are all so happy,” Draper said. “It was such a great show.”\n\nDraper has had her fingers in many creative pies since playing the perpetually single Ellyn, but she recalls “thirtysomething” as a pioneering chapter in TV history that helped shape many of the humor-laced, hour-long dramas that followed.\n\n“People had never seen a television show shot like a movie before,” she said. “Something about it seemed very real.”\n\n“I think the show’s charm was that it was blatantly real,” Mayron said. “There were characters everybody could identify with.”\n\nDraper also said the show kept ABC censors on guard.\n\n“It was very racy at the time,” she said. Footage that never aired, Draper said, included a scene of her swimming naked and dialogue that mentioned a contraceptive diaphragm.\n\nThe primary cast - that core of Philly friends - has remained active behind and in front of the cameras. Busfield, for example, played C.J.’s reporter boyfriend on the wildly popular drama “The West Wing.” Yet, he says, fans still know him as Elliot Weston, the quick-witted ad guy who nearly botched his marriage.\n\n“It’s the best role I’ve ever had,” he said, noting he thinks the ’80s show will hold up well among modern viewers - “if people can get past the hair.”\n\n“The only benefit of waiting so long for the DVD,” he added, “is maybe the hairstyles will come back.”\n\nContact Dave Schlenker at 867-4120 or go@starbanner.com.\n\nPatricia Wettig (Nancy): The three-time Emmy Award winner plays Holly Harper on ABC’s hit drama “Brothers and Sisters,” with earlier credits including “Alias,” “Prison Break” and “The Practice.”\n\nKen Olin (Michael): Olin is executive producer of “Brothers and Sisters” and plays David Caplan on the show alongside Sally Field and Olin’s wife, fellow “thirtysomething” alum Wettig.\n\nPolly Draper (Ellyn): She stopped in Ocala earlier this year, as her sons — Nat and Alex Wolff — co-headlined Kidfetti. The boys anchor The Naked Brothers Band, the subject of a popular Nickelodeon series inspired by a documentary Draper made about her pre-teen sons’ band. The 2005 documentary included appearances by all “thirtysomething” leads.\n\nTimothy Busfield (Elliot): He has served as producer and director for TV episodes including “Lipstick Jungle,” “Ed” and “Lie to Me.” As an actor, he played C.J.’s boyfriend Danny on “The West Wing” and Cal Shanley in “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.”\n\nPeter Horton (Gary): Horton is usually found behind the camera. He has directed episodes of “Grey’s Anatomy” and “The Shield,” as well as the pilot for “Dirty Sexy Money.” He co-starred in the short-lived sitcom “The Geena Davis Show” and appeared in an episode of “Brothers and Sisters.” He is executive producer of “Body Politic,” a TV drama starring Brian Austin Green slated for 2010.\n\nMel Harris (Hope): On the big screen, Harris played Maggie Johnson in the 2009 Eddie Murphy comedy “Imagine That.” On TV, she has appeared in “Saints & Sinners,” “Close to Home” and “House M.D.”\n\nMelanie Mayron (Melissa): Also an Emmy winner for “thirtysomething,” she directed many episodes of Draper’s “The Naked Brothers Band.” She served as a director of the HBO series “In Treatment” (an episode that featured Horton), as well as directing — and appearing in — “Lipstick Jungle” episodes. Mayron also developed an all-natural diaper cream called Mayron’s Good Baby.\n\nWhere are they now?"
