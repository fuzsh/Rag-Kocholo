Things are complicated when the CIA approaches her to investigate the family's involvement in domestic terrorism and to infiltrate their rarified world. Her loyalty, morality and ethics are tested as she's forced to slowly build a case against the family who saved her life.\n\nAside from Reilly and Barr, Wettig joins already announced “Identity” castmembers Stephen Hagen, Mehcad Brooks and Manish Dayal.\n\nWettig received three Emmys and Golden Globe awards for her role as Nancy Krieger Weston on ABC's '80s drama, “Thirtysomething.” She most recently starred on ABC's “Brothers & Sisters” as late family patriarch William Walker's mistress and mother to Rebecca (played by “Revenge's” Emily VanCamp).\n\nAlso read: ‘Son of God's’ ‘Too Sexy’ Jesus Signs On to CW Pilot ‘The Messengers’\n\nKurtzman and Orci's production company, K.O. Paper Products, will produce with CBS TV Studios, along with executive producer Heather Kadin and Scripted World's Rob Golenberg and Alon Aranya. Corinne Brinkerhoff will write and executive produce the project.\n\nInnovative Artists and firm Jackoway Tyerman Wertheimer Austen Mandelbaum Morris & Klein represent Wettig.\n\nThe post ‘Brothers & Sisters’ Patricia Wettig Joins CW Pilot From ‘Sleepy Hollow’ Producers appeared first on TheWrap.\n\nRelated stories from TheWrap:\n\nCW's 'Reign' First Look: Lesbian Sex by Order of the King (Exclusive Photo)\n\nRatings: The CW's '100' Debuts to Biggest Time Period Audience Since 2010"
