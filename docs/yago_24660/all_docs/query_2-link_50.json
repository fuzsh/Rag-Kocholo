        "text": "You will never believe how I grew up. My mother, truly out of nowhere, became religious when I was 12. Not just regular religious, lighting Shabbat candles and forgoing pork, but truly Orthodox. Mega-Orthodox. Ultra-Orthodox. She and my father had divorced six years before, and now we lived in Brooklyn, in what was called Flatbush at the time and has probably been renamed something fancy. My mother remarried when I was 14, to a newly Orthodox Israeli just like her, and suddenly nothing in my house — now located in Canarsie, which retains its name — made sense.\n\nLiterally, it didn’t. I didn’t know Hebrew, and that’s what they spoke. My sisters eagerly followed my mother’s path to observance. I was sent to a yeshiva, and, with no friends outside this community , I began to grow concerned that I was not being prepared for the larger world.\n\nThe TV, stored in the basement, was my gateway to mainstream society. I watched a very strange short-lived show called “Tribes” to learn how teenagers should interact. I watched “A Different World” to see what college would be like. I watched the news to make sure I wasn’t pronouncing words with a Yiddish or Israeli accent (so much so that I overcorrected; it wasn’t until I registered for wedding gifts that I learned that the word “spatula” was not pronounced “spatuler”). I watched “Beverly Hills, 90210” so that I could understand what public school was like, as if religion makes school any more or less terrible than secularism does.\n\nThis wasn’t self-loathing, I promise. (There was plenty of that, but this was not it.) This was self-preservation. This was survival. I was going to leave my house and never wear a long skirt again. I was going to smoke cigarettes and dance with men. I was going to have sect-choo-uhl intercourse, despite being told several times over a health class in my yeshiva that good girls don’t use condoms, stop writing down what the surgeon general is saying in this short film!\n\nI was going to date. I was going to marry someone who was not even a little religious. And my marriage would be normal and I would be a regular wife. But right then, I knew I didn’t stand a chance. So, one Tuesday night at 10 p.m., I found my marital instruction guide: I found “Thirtysomething.”\n\n“Thirtysomething” was a four-season-long ABC drama about a group of friends who live in Philadelphia and struggle with their marriages and relationships as they settled in for middle age. It debuted in 1987, when I was 11, but I didn’t get wind of it until I was in 10th grade, just before it was canceled. But it soon aired late nights on Lifetime, and I watched it like the Phi Beta Kappa scholar of secular society I had become.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
