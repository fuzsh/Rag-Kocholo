        "text": "The Old Head\n\nMichaelâs plan hits a snag when he discovers an old storage shed crucial to the escape has been turned into a break room. Meanwhile, LJ goes on the lam and the conspiracy claims three more lives. And outside the walls, Veronica and Nick get an explosive warning to back off their investigation and the identity of a mystery woman calling the shots is finally revealed.\n\nSleight of Hand\n\nIn order to get Abruzzi back in command of the prisonâs work detail -- and the escape plan back on track -- Michael must give up Fibonnaciâs location to Philly Falzone. Meanwhile, Michael and Dr. Sara grow closer as the escape gang grows by one. Outside the walls, Kellerman and Hale get some unwanted help tracking down LJ, and Veronica and Nick make a breakthrough.\n\nBrother's Keeper\n\nA series of flashbacks to three years ago unveils how Lincoln, Sucre, T-Bag, C-Note and Dr. Sara landed in Fox River State Penitentiary, and what drove Michael to craft his elaborate plan to break his condemned sibling out of the prison.\n\nBy the Skin and the Teeth\n\nLincoln, who thinks he sees his father at the execution, wins a two-week stay when a judge orders Terence Steadmanâs body exhumed. Sucre calls in a favor to help Michael verify a new route to the infirmary through the complicated drain system."
