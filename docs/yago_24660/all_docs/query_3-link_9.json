        "text": "R14, The Spiingieri was a a sportscar whose target market was gay men! They didn't talk about things like that much on TV in the late 80s. The show was relatively progressive for its time. Cancer, AIDS, gay relationships were all fairly unspoken up until then on network TV.\n\nI'm a cancer survivor and was very into the Nancy storyline, and liked Patricia Wettig a lot. Hope was a different story altogether.\n\nSo glad to see all the love on this thread! At the risk of becoming known as the \"thirtysomething\" troll, I've stated before that I think the show is criminally underrated. The first half of the first season was a little wobbly, and the early hype blew up in their faces as a lot of viewers thought the characters came off as whiny yuppies. But starting with Nancy and Elliot's separation the show really hit its stride, with creative direction and some of the most realistic writing and acting ever on television.\n\nThere is a sequel in the works. The new show will revisit the Steadmans and the Westons who are now in their sixties as well as their grown children who are the current thirtysomethings. Sounds interesting. This is one reboot that actually makes sense and I'm looking forward to revisiting these characters.\n\nOn a side note, the creators of Thirtysomething are the same people behind My So-Called Life. I would love to revisit that show too. Like Angela, Jordan and company could reunite for their 25th high school reunion and we could see what became of their lives. I know a reboot of MSCL is very unlikely to happen but I would definitely tune in if it did.\n\nMaybe, Chrissy, but ... well, no need to continue there. Good luck with the singing.\n\nAs someone who was a fan from the first episode, I was really disappointed with the lack of a finale. If Ken and Patricia were the ones who fucked that up, that really sucks. You were never -- any of you -- bigger than your cast mates. You were an ensemble, and that was the point. At least from the point of your loyal viewers, which I was truly one of. By the way a few things that may have brought you into a fifth season: Hope: There was no need for Hope to have a tangent (and that's what it was) when she wanted to help homeless people. That was bullshit and the viewers knew it. In fact, if Michael followed her whims and went to Washington DC, that would have been a huge mistake. Hope was always a dilettante, with no real convictions, except her when she selfishly destroyed her own New Years party. Where, once again, she was feeling sorry for herself because the guy she first fucked had died. I mean, really. Get it together girl. That happened a lot. Especially in the 80s and 90s. Knock it off, pull up your bra straps and get on with it, you wimp. You fucked up that party to no end and permanently damaged your relationship with (then extremely hunky) Michael. You idiot.\n\nBTW, those notes in the above post were really for the writers and producers. I'm aware that the actors really had no sway in what happened in the end. BUT, the actors certainly had input and should have used it. (I'm not talking about Ken and Wettig trying to take things over, though.) Ellyn and Melissa were viewer favorites, especially for gay and female viewers. They should have been given more to do. The Nancy has Cancer thing was probably gutsy at the time, but not really. No one wants to watch a cancer show every week. Elliot's devotion to her was extremely winning, though, and brought it all together."
