        "text": "Patricia Wettig (born December 4, 1951) is a three time Emmy-award winning and Golden Globe-award winning American actress and playwright.\n\nWettig, one of four sisters (Pam, Patricia, Phylis and Peggy), was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the daughter of Florence (n√©e Morlock) and Clifford Neal Wettig, a college basketball coach. She attended Ohio Wesleyan University and graduated from Temple University in 1975. She recently returned to her studies, receiving an M.F.A. in playwriting from Smith College in 2001. Wettig is married to actor and producer Ken Olin; they have two children, Clifford (b. 1983) and Roxanne (b. 1986).\n\nAlthough Wettig has acted in a number of films (including City Slickers, Guilty by Suspicion, and The Langoliers), she is best known for her work on television. In particular, she received critical acclaim (and a number of awards) for her role as Nancy Weston on ABC's Thirtysomething. She also portrayed Joanne McFadden on the television program St. Elsewhere. In addition, Wettig appeared in a number of popular television programs during the 1980s and 1990s including L.A. Law, Frasier, Hill Street Blues, and Remington Steele."
