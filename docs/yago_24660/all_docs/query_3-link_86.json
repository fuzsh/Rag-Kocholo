        "text": "Self-consciousness and anxiety never had it so good. For four years, \"Thirtysomething\" has brought painful moments of self-scrutiny and doubt as close to the level of an art form as weekly television ever gets. Michael, Hope, Elliot, Nancy, Melissa, Ellyn, Gary and Susanna -- they became family, an often exasperating family, granted, but oddly touching as they grappled with the unexpected and ironic ways in which life unfolds. ABC has canceled the series and tonight's episode, at 10 o'clock, is the last. From here on out, the series is frozen in reruns.\n\nMarshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, the creators of \"Thirtysomething,\" wrote early on in a production memo outlining their aims: \"This is a show about life on earth as we know it. At least a small slice of it. It's about a group of people, all of a certain age, who know enough about life to be totally confused by it. It's about growing up -- no matter how old you are.\"\n\nBoth men were indeed in their 30's (and are only now pushing 40). They met as students at the American Film Institute and worked in the late 1970's on the series \"Family,\" as did Richard Kramer, who would become a key producer-writer for \"Thirtysomething.\" The wives of Mr. Herskovitz and Mr. Zwick -- respectively, Susan Shilliday and Liberty Godshall -- also became part of the \"Thirtysomething\" writing staff.\n\nIn short, the off-camera family has been in many respects as close and involved as the extended family created for the series. Furthermore, the lives of the actors and their characters can intersect randomly. Ken Olin, for instance, plays Michael Steadman; both have a degree in English literature from Penn State. Melanie Mayron portrays Melissa; both are photographers.\n\nAll of which contributes mightily to the personal intensity, and the occasional claustrophobia, of the series. The \"Thirtysomething\" people are analyzed mercilessly before seeing the red light of a television camera, right down to the food they eat (these days Hope Steadman, played by Mel Harris, is partial to black beans and rice) and the books they read (the latest John le Carre novel can be spotted in the Steadman bathroom).\n\nThe series did not get off to the most promising of starts. In the very first episode, Michael -- already staking claim to the King of Whine label some critics gave him -- was examining his relatively successful life and wondering: \"Why do I feel so terrible? I know we're lucky.\" Moments later, he'd be moaning, \"God, I hate people who talk like this.\" A year of so later, Patricia Wettig, who plays Nancy and is really married to Mr. Olin, was describing the show this way for Rolling Stone magazine: \"We just talk. Talk and sex. And dinner! What's 'Thirtysomething'? We eat, we talk, we make love, and we talk about eating and making love, and we talk.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
