        "text": "“Thirtysomething” could be the next classic show reimagined for modern audiences, as the late ’80s/early ’90s drama’s creators, Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick, have a sequel series in the works at MGM Television, TheWrap has learned.\n\nWritten by the duo and to be directed by Zwick, the plot of the new show would revolve around the children of the characters in the original show, who are now 30-something themselves.\n\nNo network or streaming service is currently attached to the project, though an individual with knowledge of the potential show tells TheWrap it’s being shopped to ABC, the network the original series ran on for four seasons from 1987 to 1991.\n\nThe series, which won 13 Emmy Awards, out of 41 nominations, starred Ken Olin, Mel Harris, Melanie Mayron, Timothy Busfield, Patricia Wettig, Peter Horton and Polly Draper and centered around their baby boomer characters struggling with issues pertaining to their careers, relationships, marriages and children.\n\nAnother insider tells TheWrap the intention is for the original cast to reprise their roles on the sequel series, but there have been no formal talks and no deals set yet.\n\nRepresentatives for MGM, Zwick and Herskovitz did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment."
