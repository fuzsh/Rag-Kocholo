4. Wettig played the character of Holly Harper and Olin played Dave Caplan- he also was the executive producer on 106 episodes of the show.

5. Wettig and Olin were no strangers to working together before Brothers and Sisters as they were first caught on screen together in Thirtysomething in 1987, however they had different spouses on the show. Actress Mel Harris played his wife on the programme and apparently the public was often confused as to who Ken's wife really was while it aired.

Happy Wedding Anniversary Patricia and Ken!
