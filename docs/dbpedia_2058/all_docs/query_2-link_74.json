Even though the Caramulo course was not under the best conditions due to intense rain, the results were very acceptable, as all members of the podium obtained 8 birdies. According to the regulations, the highest place went to Carlos Graça, who was followed by Carlos Tinoco and Ricardo Coelho.\n\nThis year’s 5th round of the Montebelo/Carlsberg circuit was held, under magnificent sunshine and Montebelo’s Caramulo course was already drier.

The competition was played in medal mode with a 3/4 handicap (his preferred mode), under magnificent sun, but with a very heavy Caramulo course, although more than forty pine trees were cleared away due to the passage of the Elsa and Fabian storms. António Marques, a renowned lawyer and entrepreneur associated with Viseu, was the net winner and will have his name inscribed on the trophy. He presented a 73-stroke card, José Marques followed with 76, Jorge Sousa 77 and Luís Abreu 78. Gross score was led by José Marques although in the same number of strokes as Jorge Sousa (86), followed by Luís Abreu with 89.\n\nThe 3rd monthly Montebelo competition was held on the Caramulo course, which was extremely heavy and always under pouring rain, scaring away a large majority of the usual competitors. Under these adverse weather conditions, poor results were to be expected, because only the winner of the competition, Carlos Tinoco, managed to beat the course.\n\nCarlos scored 38 points, José Santos scored 36 points, António Poeira scored 35 points and José Marques, Pedro Correia and José Cunha Santos all scored 31 points.\n\nJosé Santos and Luiz Albuquerque scored 28 gross points, José won with the best 2nd round.

Yesterday the 7th edition of the competition had fifty players, who had a great day to practice the sport, as the sun shone and the Caramulo course was already less heavy. Hence, results were higher, with the top 7 winners beating the course and doing so by a significant margin. At the top of the net score was once again Samuel Barros who took the opportunity to roll out the entire competition scoring an amazing 44 points, thus winning the biggest salt cod. He was followed by Carlos Duarte and José Santos scoring 41 points (who won two large salt cods), Peter Roche scoring 40 points (who won a medium salt cod) and José Marques (who won a small salt cod) and Luiz Albuquerque scoring 39 points, Álvaro Marreco scoring 38 points, and Carlos Miranda and Jorge Serra scoring 37 points.

DELTA Q, who won easily on the 1st day scoring 93 points, totally sank and on the 2nd day scored 72 points; CALCITEC which had scored 83 points dropped to 80 points; and APARECIDA SEGUROS which had scored 81 dropped to 68 points. As the results of the 1st day are only used as a way to enter the 2nd day, all players started on even terms. MERCEDES-BENZ/SODICENTRO was the big winner scoring 84 points (80 on the 1st day) with the pair M. Soares/C. Van Zeller scoring 44 points and J. Jones/João Martins scoring 40 points. To choose the 2nd team playing in the Azores’ final competition, a play-off on the putting green (according to the regulations) was necessary among the three teams that scored 81 points.

Miramar, ACP and PGA), took part yesterday in the Montebelo New Year Tournament. The icy course when the shotgun started, made the competition very difficult, as the icy greens did not receive the ball properly.

He was followed by the Brit Jane O’Malley and by Carlos Aleixo scoring 33 points, Alberto Amaral scoring 32 points, Helena Coelho scoring 31 points, Paulo Camacho scoring 30 points and Hermenegildo Morgado and Austin O’Malley scoring 29 points.

The greens at the Caramulo course and the good weather both pointed towards good results, but perhaps due to the fact that the competition was played in medal mode (more penalizing for higher handicaps), and the fact that the fairways were very heavy due to the rain, those results did not appear. Only the champion Idalina Cardoso managed to win and more than half of the participants played using more than one hundred strokes.

Pricked greens, which make the puts even more complicated, once again did not impede excellent results. The pair António Rendeiro/Rui Brás won scoring 43 points, leaving the 2nd position to the Guardizela team, composed of two P&P stars, Hugo Espírito Santo and Gonçalo Rodrigues, who completed the course with 39 points, as well as the pair Sérgio Nuno Damas/Sérgio Damas, who with this result (although without official confirmation) will have been the winner of the circuit, showing fantastic regularity, as they had never won any event.

Activities for seniors will restart on the 5th of September, with the 8th Senior Ranking tournament of 2018.\n\nSpectacular weather today at Montebelo for pulling off the Julia Kemper Wines tournament, organised by the Viseu Golf Club, the 4th tournament of the Ordem de Mérito this year. The tournament had some 60 participants and around 20% (some perfectly) conquered the Caramulo course. Carlos Ferreira, who has made a grand comeback, beat all of the competition with 43 points. Next up was a trio with 40 points, Pedro Iglésias in the lead along with Francisco Lopes and Carlos Duarte. Following them were José Pinto and Rui Miranda with 39, Dimas Silva and José Cabral 38 and then Agostinho Lopes, Jorge Sousa and Jaime Fernandes all with 37.

João Couto and Jaime Fernandes (gross winners) were next with 26 and Agostinho Lopes, António Araújo, Carlos Ferreira and Carlos Duarte all had 25. Bruno Melo and Idalina Cardoso won the longest drives and Elisabete Pinto the nearest. The most exceptional Julia Kemper wines were then enjoyed at the lunch and widely lauded by the “usuals”, with some of the lucky ones taking home the remaining bounty (through a drawing).\n\nThe 5th monthly Montebelo brought together some forty participants at the Caramulo course and something happened which had not happened for a long time: the course was conquered by more than 25% of those playing.

Following them were Teresa Cabral with 41, António Cunha, José Alves and Rui Cabral scored 40, Álvaro Tavares 39, Sandra Batista, 38, Pedro Correia, José Cabral and Bruno Esteves 38 and finally Manuel Cardoso 37.

The ex-pro of Montebelo João Couto reached the same result, Carlos Miranda came in with 30 and José Santos and Aires Torres stood at 26.\n\nFrancisco Lopes in net and Carlos Tinoco in gross were the top players of the 1st summer tournament, which was held on Montebelo’s Caramulo course yesterday, with some twenty-five seniors playing.\n\nFrancisco was the one to conquer the course with 42 points.

Following them, Alberto Amaral and Jacinto Pinto with 34, Dimas Silva and Rui Miranda 33, Carlos Aleixo 32 and Carlos Figueiredo, José Alves and José Gonçalves all with 31. Carlos Tinoco took advantage of the tournament to practice for the world final of the WCGC, where he will be on a team with Luiz Albuquerque, and so he won comfortably with 24 points in the gross category, 4 more than Seixas, 5 more than José de Oliveira and 7 more than Fernando Martins. The tournament was held one hour earlier so that everyone could see Portugal play at the World Cup. It was a fantastic atmosphere and with sparkling wine in abundance, such that all could celebrate the Portuguese victory and also sing “Happy Birthday” to celebrate the 3 birthdays of Gay Adamson, Idalina Cardoso and Luis Chaves, who naturally added some wonderful treats at dessert.\n\nThe Magnum Wines Tournament (Carlos Lucas, Vinhos, Ldª) was the 3rd meet this year of the Order of Merit at the Viseu Golf Club and was attended by some 50 golfers playing on Montebelo’s Caramulo course. The greens were in very good shape (after aeration) on this veritable day of summer, which allowed from some extraordinary results to be noted. José Artur came in 1st place net with 42 points, followed by João Gaio, João Navega and Álvaro Tavares with 39, Rui Cabral and António Sanganha 38 as well as Jorge Sousa and Filipe Fernandes 37. João Navega seems to have overcome crisis and this time was the best player at the meet with 25 points, one more than Jorge Sousa and 3 more than Carlos Duarte, Rui Cabral and Carlos Tinoco. The story goes at the Quinta do Ribeiro that when acquired by a priest to be christened immediately as Quinta do Ribeiro Santo, then the property would come to be naturally rich (with water year-round). In 1994, it was acquired by the family of Carlos Lucas, who immediately replanted the vineyards and in 2000 bottling of wines with that name took place. This prestigious nectar was amply enjoyed at the lunch and then still regaled all of the participants (through the raffle).\n\nThe 5th gathering of seniors took place today at Montebelo, with more than 20 golfers taking part and Samuel Barros being crowned again for winning on two scoreboards. The results were affected a bit by the state of the greens (still not completely recovered after aeration of the greens), such that 37 points won Samuel the laurels in net. Following after were Rui Miranda with 34, Francisco Lopes 33, Carlos Tinoco and Alberto Amaral 30 and José Silva Gonçalves, Américo Melo, José de Oliveira and Seixas, all with 29. In the pure side of golf, Samuel had 22 points, in comparison to 20 for Carlos Tinoco, 19 for Seixas, 16 for José de Oliveira and 10 for Rui Miranda. The “treatment” this time was the marvelous “duck rice” fabulously washed down with the wines and the sparkling wines of Quinta da Mata Fidalga (Bairrada), courtesy of our dear golfing friend from Bairrada, Américo Melo.\n\nSome sixty players took part in the 2nd tournament of the OM of the Viseu Golf Club, which was sponsored by the Dão Wine Route. With the greens of the Caramulo course on their way to being the best and a veritable summer day, all the elements were joined together to bring about the results that were scored. Carlos Graça was the best net player with 40 points and was followed by Manuel Cardoso with 39, Jorge Sousa 38, José António 37, Carlos Duarte, João Sousa and Luís Chaves 36 as well as Miguel São Bento, Jacinto Pinto and Filipe Fernandes, all with 35. The best player at the tournament was once again José Santos from Nelas, coming in with a card of 23 points, one more than António Araújo and Jorge Sousa, 2 more than Carlos Duarte and Manuel Cardoso and 3 more than Agostinho Lopes. Prizes were given out in the following way: José Santos (gross winner), Jorge Sousa, Carlos Graça and José António (winners of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd categories), Manuel Cardoso (1st senior), Sandra Batista (1st ladies), Daniel Antunes (1st junior), Amândio Prata (nearest) and Miguel São Bento (longest).\n\nIt was with a shotgun start in pairs/ Texas-scramble with a 3/4 handicap, with required use of 5 outings, that the 3rd open of the Montebelo Golf Course was played for. A total of 21 teams showed up to try to obtain the passport to the Benfica Corporate Golf Cup final, which will take place at Aroeira II on the 2nd of June. The husband/wife duo Manuela Domingues/Paulo Jorge Domingues will be Montebelo’s representatives, given their 1st position ranking with 48 points.

As for actual score, the duo José de Oliveira/Carlos Duarte won with 31 points, beating the teams Carlos Tinoco/Leonel Seixas and Carlos Rodrigues/Jaime Fernandes by 1 point.\n\nThe Quinta das Lágrimas Golf Club came to Montebelo today to compete in the 1st tournament of this year’s Order of Merit. Nearly fifty players showed up for the shotgun start so as to enjoy an exception day for golf, as only the first two holes were played “blind” due to thick fog. The results were very good, with the 1st quartet to conquer the Caramulo course. First place went to Carlos Mendes (hand. ega 29.8) representing CG Prof. Ed. Física with 43 points. Álvaro Marreco came in with 40, Miguel Soares 38, Mário Filipe 37, Vicente Gouveia and José Cunha Santos 36 as well as Marco Rosmaninho and Rui Vaz Castro 35, these all being part of the “top 8”. Hugo Espírito Santo came to Montebelo to show that it’s not just at P&P that he could win, because he also has a prominent win with 29 points in real scoring. He left others behind: Mário Filipe by 4 points. Vicente Gouveia by 5, Pedro Iglésias by 7 as well as Arnaldo Paredes and João Filipe Monteiro 8. Special prizes were won Armando Rocha (nearest) as well as Arnaldo Paredes and Pedro Oliveira (longest).\n\nThe 3rd tournament Montebelo/Carlsberg was played on the Caramulo course today by some 50 golfers. There was spring sun on most holes, but the rain that was promised (that is likely to have kept some regulars away) showed up at the end. The results were quite satisfactory, with the first quartet by adjusted score conquering the course. Jorge Silva from Coimbra won first place with 39 points, and he was followed by Filipe Rabaça with 38, Hermenegildo Morgado and Daniel Antunes 37, Alberto Amaral and João Batanete 36, Jorge Toste and Pedro Correia 35 as well as Rui Miranda and Carlos Figueiredo 34. José Santos, who had the largest handicap in the competition, was the best player at the tournament with 24 points.

Following were: Carlos Aleixo and Peter Roche with 35, Austin O’Malley and Samuel Barros 34, Luís Chaves 33, Alberto Amaral 32, Carlos Tinoco 31 and Tony Foster and Armando Leitão 30. The best player at the tournament went to Carlos Tinoco with 19 points, Samuel Barros 17 as well as Seixas and José de Oliveira who ended up with 16. The “treatment” today was roasted ribs and we sang out Happy Birthday to Samuel, as it had been his birthday that week.\n\nToday at Montebelo the Quinta da Fata tournament was played, a tournament which makes up the OM of the Viseu Golf Club and played by some 50 golfers. The Caramulo course (which provided very good conditions, considering the intense rain of the previous days) was conquered by the first four classifiers who, curiously enough, had the same score (38) such that the ranking was determined by the results in the last 9 holes. Hugo Coutinho was in 1st place with scores of 17+21, followed by Daniel Antunes (19+19), Teresa Cabral (20+18) and Luís Marques (24+14). Behind them, José Santos with 36 and Jacinto Pinto, Rui Cabral and Jorge Toste, all with 35. The actual score was loosely won by José Santos with 27 points, leaving behind António Cunha by 4 points, Jaime Fernandes by 6, Jorge Toste by 7 and António Araújo, José de Oliveira, Carlos Tinoco and Luís Marques all by 8. Special prizes went out to Isabel Guedes (nearest) and Marco Rosmaninho (longest). The famous nectars of Quinta da Fata were tasted and much-praised during the lunch, along with several remaining which were considered some of the “jewels of the crown” from this brand, that were then raffled off.\n\nThe Montebelo Golf Course hosted the Beiras stage of the WCGC today at the Caramulo course. There were 28 teams of 2 players each, using scoring from both members in stableford-3/4 handicap. A MUNDOTEXTIL Fernando Lopes / José Lima scored on both tables with 63 (33+30) points net and 48 (26+22) gross. Following in net scores were FAB – SOC. ADVOGADOS with 62 (Agostinho Lopes 30 / Renato Fernandes 32), PETROFREGIM-BERTIM 62 (Carlos Ribeiro 26 /Daniel Silva 36), CLÍNICA DENTARIA LARANJO TINOCO 60 (Bruno Melo 27 / Carlos Tinoco 33, JC AUTOMÓVEIS 60 (Antonio Cunha 35 / José Santos 25 and gross score JC AUTOMÓVEIS took 2nd place with 46 (Antonio Cunha 27 / José Santos 19) and the MONTEBELO I team came in last place on the with 45 (Filipe Rabaça Fernandes 13 / Luiz Albuquerque 32). Special prizes went out to José de Oliveira (nearest) as well as Carlos Ribeiro and Teresa Cabral (longest).\n\nIt was mild weather although with skies on the grey side that the seniors from Viseu competed today on the Caramulo course (now very favourable after aeration of the greens). This was the 2nd open vying for a medal, with some thirty players taking part.\n\nLuís Chaves reached 1st place net with 69 shots and was followed by Idalina Cardoso with 71, Alberto Amaral 72, José Marques 74, José Gonçalves and José Ministro Esteves 75, Carlos Aleixo 76, Carlos Tinoco 77 followed by Ronald Warner, Samuel Barros and Gay Adamson, all with 79. José Marques was the best player of the competition with 21 points (stableford/gross), followed by Carlos Tinoco with 19 and then Samuel Barros, Seixas and Idalina Cardoso, all with 16. The longest golf hole went to Luis Marques and Idalina Cardoso and the nearest was won by Seixas.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nThe Viseu seniors played today in the 1st match of the spring circuit, a shotgun start with a stableford/full-handicap, making for some 30 golfers taking part. The conditions of the Caramulo course did not look to promising for good results, such that the par for the course (36) gave a win to Samuel Barros, who not satisfied with his win, came in first as well in gross score. In net, Samuel was followed by Luís Chaves with 34, Gay Adamson 33, Teresa Cabral 32, Peter Roche 31, Miguel Jacinto 29 and finally Alberto Amaral and Pedro Porto de Aguiar both with 28. Already in gross, Samuel managed17 (8+9) points come in ahead of Carlos Tinoco (11+6) for best results in the 2nd round, José de Oliveira 14, Seixas 13, Peter Roche 12 and Alberto Amaral 10.\n\nThe “treatment” today was the famed arroz de costela em vinha-de-alhos [pork ribs marinated in red wine and garlic], without forgetting beforehand for all participants to plant an oak (burnt area in the straight of the fairway of hole 10), thus commemorating International Day of Forests.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nThe cold forecasted (along the way we experienced -5) drove the majority of the “regulars” of Wednesday competitions away, leaving only two dozen to participate. “Franciu” Luiz Albuquerque, although not a senior, took the opportunity to escape the snow and came to “golfingly perfume” this 2nd ranking tournament, besides spreading some “good news” that will soon be made public. Luiz played with a handicap of 3, scoring 39 points making par for the Caramulo course. Idalina Cardoso followed with net of 37, JG Adamson and Carlos Ferreira 36, Carlos Eduardo Aleixo 35, Francisco Lopes 33 and finally Rui Miranda and Julie Warner 32 while in gross, Carlos Tinoco won by 16 pontos, Carlos Ferreira by 17, Seixas by 19 and lastly José de Oliveira and Idalina Cardoso by 20. The longest women’s shot went to JG Adamson and the men’s long as well as nearest went to Seixas. A notice for navigation “An outing to Porto da Raiva for lamprey is planned on the 21st”\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nMore than fifty players from 9 national clubs (Viseu, PGA, Nortada, Vale Pisão, Centro, Santo da Serra, ACP, Associação da Bairrada and Quinta das Lágrimas) participated today at Montebelo at the open competed on the Caramulo course, shotgun stableford/full-handicap. A doctor from Coimbra, Elisabete Pinto was the net champion with 38 points, followed by José Santos, Filipe Fernandes and Sandra Baptista with 36 and additionally Vitor Costa and Carlos Duarte with 35. The ex-pro from Montebelo, João Couto, won gross with 29 pontos, ahead of José Santos and Luiz Albuquerque by 2 points, Fernando Maganinho by 5, Antonio Cunha by 6 and José de Oliveira by 8.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nMore than three dozen participants took part in the 3rd winter tournament organized by the Viseu Golf Club Seniors. No one present was able to beat the Montebelo Caramulo course and only Luís Chaves was able to not be defeated in that one, turning in a card with 36 points. Britishman Tony Foster came in next with 34, Carlos Aleixo 33, Carlos Almeida and Gay Adamson 32 while José Gonçalves, Helena Coelho, Manuel Souza and Austin O’Malley all came in at 31. In the pure strain of golf, 16 points was enough for Seixas to triumph, followed by Tony Foster with 15 and José de Oliveira, Luís Chaves and Austin O’Malley, all with 13.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nThe Viseu Golf Club organised an unusual golf competition at Montebelo and we agree from our point of view that we’ve never participated in such a type of tournament. It consisted of a team competition (4 chosen elements, 2 low handicaps and 2 high) in which the best of 4 was chosen and participants would end the hole with his/her own ball, counting only the net birdies, when the eagle counted doubly and the albatross triple. The winning team reached 54 and was made up of Carlos Duarte (7), Manuel Cardoso (10) Paulo Ramos (16) and Francisco Lopes (21), followed by 41 for the team of Paulo Domingues (6), José Pinto (7), Paulo Neves (6) and Mário Luís (22), completing the last place of the podium headed by Jorge Sousa (6) with 38 made up by Carlos Ferreira (9), Filipe Fernandes (13) and António Martins (10). José de Oliveira, Elisabete Pinto, José Pinto and Paulo Ramos had the greatest blows in holes 3, 8, 12 and 17 respectively.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nMore than three dozen golfers participated today in the 1st get-together of the year, competed on the Caramulo course of Montebelo, with a shotgun start, with a Stableford/full-handicap. The Britishman Austin O’Malley was the winner with 36 points followed by José Gonçalves and Samuel Barros with 35, Jaime Fernandes and Álvaro Marreco 34 and Ronald Warner, Gay Adamson and Miguel Costa each with 33. The \"new senior\" Jaime Fernandes came to give another lesson and took advantage of the event to be the best player at the competition with 23 points. Following him were José Marques with 21, Samuel Barros 18, Ronald Warner 16, Tony Foster 14 as well as Austin O’Malley, Álvaro Marreco and Idalina Cardoso 13. Miguel Jacinto had the most accurate shot in the 12th hole and Idalina Cardoso and Britishman Ronald Warner were the players with the longest shots in hole 5.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nMore than seven dozen golfers participated today in the 1st tournament of the ranking Montebelo/Carlsberg for the current year, a disputed competition with a shotgun start with a Stableford/full-handicap. The intense fog surrounding through the entire competition (sometimes completely dense) didn’t hinder obtaining good results, which is indicative of the how well the majority of those present knew this difficult Caramulo course at Montebelo. António Araújo with a score of 18+20 reached the 1st net position, followed by José António with 21+17, Rui Viçoso and Bruno Melo 37, Jorge Silva 36 as well as Elisabete Pinto, Filipe Fernandes, Cristina Fonseca, Idalina Cardoso and Pedro Correia all with 35. The actual score was topped by João Couto with 28 points, leaving Bruno Melo in 2nd, António Araújo and António Cunha in 4th followed by Cristina Fonseca and Jaime Fernandes in 5th. After making the necessary adjustments, the prizes were hand out as follows: Bruno Melo (1st gross and longest drive), António Araújo and José António (champions of the 1st and 2nd category), Pedro Correia and Rui Viçoso (runners-up in the 1st and 2nd category), Elisabete Pinto (1st lady), Daniel Antunes (1st junior), Jorge Serra (nearest) and Cristina Fonseca (longest drive). The Montebelo/Carlsberg 2018 ranking is comprised of 10 competitions, 8 of which are Stableford (points) and 2 in stroke-play, with a prize of an annual pass to Montebelo.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nThe seniors from Viseu had a spectacular day of golf today at Montebelo, whereas the last Wednesdays St. Peter hasn’t played along so well. The sunny day served to show off all the golf going on and the top five in adjusted score managed to conquer the Caramulo course. The Britishman Ronald Warner led the quintet with 41 points, followed by Paulo Camacho with 39, Manuel Souza 38, Alberto Amaral and Tony Foster 37 as well as Idalina Cardoso, Pedro Porto de Aguiar and Rui Miranda, all with 31. Gross score was headed by a quartet with 18 points, Alberto Amaral, Ronald Warner, Carlos Tinoco and Tony Foster, smiling with victory as Alberto had the best result in the last holes.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco.\n\nDrizzle during the championship, dense fog for roughly half and a logistically complicated course were the main reason for less successful results in this 1st competition of the year. José Marques stepped up to stand out and clearly won the two classifying scoreboards, both part of the adjusted score (36 points) and the gross with 24 points. Following in the net field were José Alves and Francisco Lopes with 32, Samuel Barros, Jacinto Pinto 29, Carlos Aleixo 28 as well as José Ramalheira and Luís Chaves 27, whereas António Moita with 8 points, Samuel Barros with 9 and José Artur with 13 were left on the actual scoreboard. Special prizes went to Samuel Barros who had the most accurate shot on hole 12 and Luís Chaves who achieved the longest shot on hole 5. As this year the 10th anniversary of the seniors’ group will be celebrated, the \"alma mater\", Idalina Cardoso, Samuel Barros and José Marques will undertake to hold a commemorative tournament on the 4th of April (the 1st was on the 4th of April 2008), although they are open to suggestions as to how to further brighten and give visibility to the historic event.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nMore than four dozen golfers participated today in the competition to pay tribute to our colleague João Vinagre, who we remember as being the first captain of the Viseu Golf Club. The shotgun played as stroke play, started with a drizzle along with fog, but soon this cleared, allowing the rest of the event to be played under lovely sun. José António is to have his name inscribed on the cup, having scored 71 net shots. Samuel Barros, João Antunes, Paulo Domingues and Peter Roche came in second with 72. Bruno Vicente (Ega 3,1) a player from the Vilamoura Golf Club was the best player at the competition with 78 shots, beating João Couto (pro) by 2, José de Oliveira by 9 and Paulo Domingues, Carlos Tinoco and António Cunha by 10. Once again, the Vinagre family was represented by their children at the lunch, taking part also in handing out the prizes.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco\n\nLuiz Albuquerque and Paulo Domingues were the leading players at the Quinta da Fata Tournament organized by CG Viseu, part of the OM of the Club Vieseense. Fifty menbers of the Beira region association played in the tournament on Montebelo’s Caramulo course using stableford/full handicap. The currently flawless greens were a great help in reaching these strong scores, although the changing weather throughout the tournament (wind, cold, rain and sun) may have been the biggest handicap for the players.\n\nPaulo Domingues and Carlos Aleixo scored 40 points, but Paulo Domingues was the winner due the best second lap.

Despite rain in the beginning and the end of the shotgun, it did not have great consequences because the results were quite satisfactory. The pair Luís Marques/José António, who played with 23 net strokes, reached the highest place with 46 points. They were followed, according to the distance of strokes, by the teams of Carlos Rodrigues/Jaime Fernandes (11 net strokes), Tiago Barroso/João Rodrigues (19), Luís Bonito/Pedro Fonseca (12) and José Augusto/Guilherme Laureano (23).\n\nIn the gross ranking, Carlos Rodrigues/Jaime Fernandes were 34 points in the lead, beating the other podium players by one stroke: Luis Bonito/Pedro Fonseca and José Santos/ António Cunha. Christian Stenevinge (men) and Ricardo Paredes (juniors) played the longest strokes in hole 5 and Pedro Fonseca was the one who placed the ball closest to hole 12.\n\nIn the end, President João Cerejo presented his thanks for hosting this event - labelling it as excellent -, both because of the Caramulo course as well as the gastronomic event, with special mention of the field bar and the famous roasted pork. The speech was then followed by presentation of prizes and a drawing.\n\nÁlvaro Marreco."
