F. de Lima is a Brazilian ecologist working on the ecology, succession and restoration of tropical forests and the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of tree species. He is also interested in subjects related to species conservation, DNA barcoding, bioinformatics and computer programming. He has over 15 years of experience working with tropical forest data, which granted him advanced skills in vegetation sampling methods, species identification, molecular biology, and the management of biodiversity data. He is the creator and maintainer of plantR, a computer program to manage species records from biological collections.\n\nThe Pl@ntNet team, coordinated by Pierre Bonnet and Alexis Joly, brings together engineers and researchers in computer science and ecology from three French research institutes (CIRAD, INRIA and IRD). Based in Montpellier (France), it has been developing the Pl@ntNet participatory science platform for nearly fifteen years, designed to make it easier to recognise plant species using visual analysis. It is one of the first platforms in the world to use Deep Learning to identify species, and to involve its users in the production and analysis of the data it generates. Free of charge and used daily by several hundred thousand people, it has been contributing to GBIF since 2020, and the data it generates has been used in nearly 700 scientific publications. As part of the Brazilian team, it aims to produce new IT services for analysing new types of images to predict the presence of plant species based on the data produced by the robots and drones deployed.\n\nAlexis Joly is research director at Inria with interests in machine learning and computer vision applied to biodiversity. He is co-leading the Pl@ntNet citizen science platform which develops an AI-based plant identification application with 20 million end-users. Since 2014, he has been the PI of the LifeCLEF international virtual lab dedicated to the computer-assisted identification of living organisms (involving tens of research groups world-wide). He has been involved in the steering board of numerous European projects (e.g. GUARDEN, Cos4Cloud) and many national initiatives related to biodiversity informatics and heritage data.\n\nAntoine Affouard began his involvement with Pl@ntNet by developing sites hosting data from the herbaria in Cayenne, Nouméa and Benin, as well as around twenty other botanical repositories or datasets. He then developed the first two versions of the Pl@ntNet mobile application for Android, as well as TaxaMart (a taxonomic database) and the Smart’flore mobile app for Android. He coordinated developments for the IT overhaul of Pl@ntNet’s information system, initiated in 2017 (NoSQL databases, RESTful services, websites, mobile applications), the aim of which was to enable the platform to cover the world’s flora and to be able to manage the growing volumes of data and users. He also developed the new web services, databases and the Pl@ntNet API platform.\n\nMathias Chouet started working with Pl@ntNet in 2012, developing a replicated data management system for taxonomical referentials and plant observations. In 2018 he participated in the rewriting and deployment of Pl@ntNet v2, including REST APIs and NoSQL databases. Since 2020 he has been involved in different European projects focused on citizen science and biodiversity monitoring, and developed the My Pl@ntNet API and platform that makes AI plant identification available to developers and researchers around the world. Most recent developments include web services for plant observation data retrieval in a DarwinCore compatible format, and adaptation of the Pl@ntNet information system to new contexts such as qualification of plants pathogens, infra-specific determination, or multi-species quadrat images identification.\n\nHervé Goëau is the author of more than 50 scientific publications at the crossroads of digital and life sciences. At a time of Big Data and major IT initiatives on biodiversity, his work on the identification of plant species has been one of the pioneers, with volumes numbering in the millions of images and tens of thousands of species. Since 2011, he has been co-organising the lifeclef international initiative dedicated to the evaluation of automatic species identification methods, which each year brings together dozens of international teams specialising in computer vision and machine learning. It is currently working in particular on tropical flora, where herbarium data is often the only available resource, and on scaling up the world’s flora. He is also investing in themes such as the automatic identification of plant pathologies, the determination of their phenology and infra-species identification.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Hugo became a part of the Pl@ntNet team, focusing on enhancing the React Native Android and iOS mobile applications. His contributions were aimed at accelerating the app’s performance, boosting its reliability, and enriching the user experience to make plant identification accessible to all. Beyond Pl@ntNet, Hugo is an active community member in Montpellier, France, where he organizes technology meetups and conferences, including SunnyTech. He is also known for his dedication to open-source projects, while working at INRIA for Pl@ntNet and in his free time.\n\nThomas Paillot started working on the Pl@ntNet website mid 2023 focusing on migrating the core technical components of the site to an up to date version (Vue 2 › Vue 3 and Nuxt 2 › Nuxt 3). From the beginning of 2024 he started an ongoing effort of redesigning the website from the ground up. He is also working on the design and the development of new interfaces to support new uses of the platform: GeoPl@ntNet, diseases identification, vegetation surveys.\n\nA tropical botany engineer for over 25 years, Vanessa worked for 10 years in French Guiana and 15 years in New Caledonia. Ella spent 2 years in New York, 2 years in Quito (Ecuador) and 1 year in Guadeloupe. She is an expert in the identification of tropical species in French Guiana and New Caledonia, and more widely in South America and Oceania. Her skills cover forest ecology, taxonomy, rare and endangered species and invasive species. She is also Expert botanist for the RLA Flore NC (Red List Authority, IUCN referent in New Caledonia)\n\nResearcher at USP-SUSTEN program in the project “Sociobiodiversity of the State of São Paulo” at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences, and Letters (FFCLRP/USP).
