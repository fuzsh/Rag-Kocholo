There are two phases of assessment: an intermediate assessment of a formative type and a second final assessment. The classification derives from the pursuit of the learning objectives directly related to this component of the UC.\n\n2) In the Seminar component, the teaching methodology is eminently active, favouring the analysis of texts and case studies, discussion between teacher and students and among students themselves, collaborative work in groups, and promoting at all times sharing and reflection on aspects of content, school contexts, the observation process- which leads to the determination of the action-research project, and critical incidents in classes taught, in order to be applied to the PES and the Report component.\n\nThe type of assessment is predominantly formative and takes into account the students' involvement in the discussion, their capacity to reflect and the accomplishment of the tasks proposed by the teacher, among which the presentation (oral+written) of a work related to the theme of the final action-research report predominates. The final mark is determined by the qualitative assessment carried out throughout the Seminar.\n\n3) In the Report component, regarding teaching methodology, discussion between student and report supervisor in tutorial sessions is essential. The report supervisor, whenever possible, also assumes the functions of the traineeship supervisor.\n\nThe evaluation of the report takes place in a public examination, but reflects the formative process of the student throughout the course.\n\n4) With regards the discussion component, this constitutes the second part of the public examination in which the report is defended. The assessment takes place in that examination but reflects, as in the assessment of the report, the formative process of the student throughout the CU.\n\nThe formula for calculating the final mark of the CU is as follows:\n\nClassif. Final=(CL. PES x 0.52)+(Cl. Seminar x 0.13)+(Cl. Report x 0.25)+(Cl. Discussion x 0.10).\n\nAssessment method: distributed without final examination.\n\nkeywords\n\nSocial sciences > Educational sciences > Research methodology\n\nHumanities > language sciences > Linguistics > Applied linguistics\n\nSocial sciences > Educational sciences > Teaching methods\n\nHumanities > Literature > European literature > Romance literatures > Portuguese literature\n\nSocial sciences > Educational sciences > Education > Teacher training\n\nEvaluation Type\n\nDistributed evaluation without final exam\n\nAssessment Components\n\nDesignation Weight (%) Defesa pública de dissertação, de relatório de projeto ou estágio, ou de tese 10,00 Participação presencial 13,00 Trabalho de campo 52,00 Trabalho escrito 25,00 Total: 100,00\n\nAmount of time allocated to each course unit\n\nDesignation Time (hours) Elaboração de relatório/dissertação/tese 206,00 Estudo autónomo 470,00 Frequência das aulas 114,00 Realização de Estágio 510,00 Total: 1300,00\n\nEligibility for exams\n\nStudents are required to attend STP and Seminar sessions, according to the Assessment Regulations in force for Continuous Assessment.
