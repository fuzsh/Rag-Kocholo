        "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nThe present study reports the detection and molecular characterization of rotavirus A (RVA), rotavirus D (RVD), rotavirus F (RVF), rotavirus G (RVG) and picobirnavirus (PBV) in fecal specimens of wild and exotic birds (n = 23) from different cities of Pará state, which were hospitalized at Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Pará, Brazil, between January 2018 to June 2019. The animals exhibited different clinical signs, such as diarrhea, malnutrition, dehydration and fractures. The results showed 39.1% (9/23) of positivity for RVA by RT-qPCR. Among these, one sample (1/9) for the NSP3 gene of T2 genotype was characterized. About 88.9% (8/9) for the VP7 gene belonging to G1, equine-like G3 and G6 genotypes, and 55.5% (5/9) for the VP4 gene of P[2] genotype were obtained. In the current study, approximately 4.5% of the samples (1/23) revealed coinfection for the RVA, RVD and RVF groups. Furthermore, picobirnavirus (PBV) was detected in 1 of the 23 samples tested and was classified in the Genogroup I. The findings represent the first report of the circulation of RVA, RVD, RVF, RVG and PBV genotypes in wild birds in Brazil and suggest the possible interspecies transmission of RVs and PBVs."
