Lusophone Cities in Literature, Film and Music..\n\nDescription: Rio de Janeiro, Luanda, Lisbon, Macau: the cities of the Portuguese-speaking world are more than just post-card images. They are microcosms of social activity and repositories of historical memory which offer up endless avenues for exploration. In this course we deconstruct urban spaces in Lusophone Africa, Lusophone Asia, Brazil, Portugal and the diaspora, via analyses of works of literature, film, music and more.

Focusing on political, social, and cultural dimensions of emancipation, we will ask: How have African, Asian, and Indigenous writers and artists imagined emancipatory endeavors for their peoples, their countries, and their worlds? What is the role of cultural expression in world-sharing and world-building in response to centuries of colonialism and its legacies? We will broach these questions by reading a broad range of texts, watching films and documentaries, and looking at works of art that respond to manifestations of colonial power. This course also aims to build written and oral proficiency in Portuguese and develop knowledge of the diverse cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world. Conducted in Portuguese.\n\nPOBS 0630E.

Covering a wide selection of genres from novels and novellas to short stories, television, film, and music, we will examine the role of literature and art in reinforcing and challenging norms of gender and sexuality. Students will engage with some key ideas from Gender Studies and Queer Theory and consider concepts from the Global South with regards to expressions of gender and sexuality in the Lusophone world. Topics will include conceptions of nuclear families, sexual deviance, homosociality, militant masculinity, queer representation, trans visibility, intersectionality, and colonial legacies. Taught in Portuguese.\n\nPOBS 0630F. Unveiling Herstories - Feminist Decolonial Perspectives in Literature and Arts in Portuguese.\n\nThis interdisciplinary course immerses students in the rich and diverse artistic expressions of women from Portuguese-speaking countries, encompassing literature, film, music, and visual arts. The main question in this course is: How does women's creative production contribute to building Herstories in a transnational Portuguese-speaking context? The course explores how these women contribute to a feminist decolonial approach, delving into the construction of Herstories through their art, challenging and reshaping historical narratives within their respective countries. Notably, the course sheds light on the conditions, or lack thereof, for producing a traditionally designed history, particularly emphasizing the often overlooked contributions of Black women in this context. The course aims to engage students in formulating and discussing questions regarding the crucial protagonism of women in cultural production within Portuguese-speaking regions.

Sobral)\n\nPOBS 0820. \"Coming Out\" Jewish, Gay or Black: Mistaken Identity in Literature from USA and Brazil.\n\nUnderstood as the opposite of passing or assimilating, \"coming out\" evokes socio-psychological and cultural tensions between public and private identities that are becoming increasingly blurred. Ambivalent identities incite concerns about belongingness, marginalization, citizenship, dislocation, and diaspora. Feeling unfamiliar or displaced as a manifestation of cultural alterity can also lead to situations of mistaken identity. Recognizing today's shift away from essentialisms, this seminar will read fiction from the USA and Brazil by applying the tropes of \"coming out\" and belonging to illustrate the complex formations and ambiguous practices of identity construction. Enrollment limited to 19 first year students. Conducted in English.\n\nPOBS 0850. Comparative Approaches to the Literatures of Brazil and the United States.\n\nBrazil and the United States have much in common: continental territories, huge natural resources, dynamic economies and multi-ethnic populations. Yet, their histories and cultures are distinctive and unique, as suggested in Vianna Moog's classic symbolic contrast between the Brazilian bandeirante and the American pioneer. We will undertake a comparative study of the two countries' literatures over the past eighty years with an eye towards exploring contextual, thematic and technical analogies as well as differences.

Beyond the Masterpiece Tradition: Mining the Archive for Alternative Histories of Portuguese Cinema.\n\nDrawing on anthropology, new film history and media archaeology, this course takes the moving image archive as a departure point to revisit, reconceptualise and expand Portuguese film history and historiography. We will consider the works and formats that have been neglected – actualities, utility films, newsreels, amateur films, domestic footage and film fragments – to revise theoretical and historiographical assumptions and recover parallel, interrupted and non-teleological film histories that have hitherto failed to be written. We will also examine the appropriation of archival footage by other film productions and discuss the impact of the ‘digital turn’ on film archives. Conducted in English.\n\nPOBS 1601S. Environment, Health and Colonial Society in Africa- 19th and 20th Centuries.\n\nThis course seeks to build an understanding of how environment and health intersected in colonial Africa in the late 19th and 20th centuries by looking diachronically at a varied set of cases that reveal important aspects about changing disease ecologies and knowledge production, about environmental change and human agency, but also about power and inequalities in colonial societies. Though guided by a comparative cross-national and cross-imperial dimension, the course also seeks to fill the gap in the study of environment, health and imperialism by bringing to the fore the cases of Angola, Cape Verde, São Tomé e Príncipe, Mozambique and Guiné-Bissau, territories under Portuguese colonial rule until the 1970s. Open to all students, this course is also intended as complementary to other courses offered at Brown, namely on the History of Africa and the History of STEaM.\n\nPOBS 1601T.

To what extent did the regime provide a unique response to the interwar crisis of liberalism? How did Salazarism influence the rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe and South America? Was Salazarism different from Fascism? How useful is the concept of normalization in defining the experience of everyday life under the regime? Providing answers to these questions will require drawing from the variegated inputs of political, social and cultural history.\n\nPOBS 1601W.

Decolonial Futurities: Submerged Perspectives from and within the Americas.\n\nAnthropocenic exhaustion begs for new/old artistic modes of gathering and collectivity. How can we think, do, create, perform, listen, sense, perceive, and generate future-oriented imaginaries based on the texture of ancient ways? This collaborative humanities course centers perspectives, translations, and mediations from and about the Américas. We seek to decenter the liberal humanism of environmental thinking to present modes of being that emerge from the otherwise of the Américas. This imaginary is pluralistic in its linguistic, racial, ethnic, and gendered imagination. It foregrounds submerged perspectives and unearths subterranean stories that confront legacies of (neo)colonialism, racial capitalism, and extractivist exploitation. Guest participants — with the support of the Brown Arts and Cogut Institutes, Modern Culture and Media, and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies — enliven our study across the U.S., Turtle Island, and Abya Yala (the Indigenous nomenclature for the Américas).\n\nFall POBS2400 S01 17377 W 3:00-5:30(10) (L.
