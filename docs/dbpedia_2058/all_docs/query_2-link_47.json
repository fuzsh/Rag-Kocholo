        "text": "Variations in environmental conditions along gradients play an important role in species distribution through environmental filtering of morphological and physiological traits; however, their effects on bat diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of the distance to the nearest watercourse, terrain elevation, vegetation clutter, basal area and canopy height on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and on the predominance of some functional traits (body mass, wing morphology and trophic level) of bat assemblages (phyllostomid and mormoopid bats) in a terra firme forest, in the northeastern Brazilian Amazon. We captured bats using mist nets in 15 permanent plots over a 25 km2 area of continuous forest. We captured 279 individuals belonging to 28 species with a total of 77.760 m2.h of sampling effort. Our results showed that bat richness increases as a function of distance to the nearest watercourse and that the assemblage also changes, with more diverse taxonomic and functional groups in areas further from the watercourse. Furthermore, elevation positively affects species richness, and the basal area of the forest positively influences the average body mass of bats. Taken together, our results demonstrate that subtle variations in the environmental conditions along a local scale gradient impact on the main dimensions of bat diversity in primary forests.\n\nGreenfall leaves caused by hailstorms may represent a resource pulse of nutrients. We determined the contribution of greenfall versus senescent leaves to total litterfall production, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus input to the system, and leaf decomposition rate. Litterfall was collected monthly for three years in two cloud forests (F1, F2) and a restoration planting area (R) in Veracruz, Mexico. Two fortuitous hailstorms occurred in the second year. Leaf decomposition rate was determined in all three sites but did not differ across them. Total annual litterfall, excluding greenfall, was 10.0, 10.1, and 7.7 Mg ha−1 y−1 for F1, F2, and R, respectively. Senescent leaves represented 65% of the litterfall, while greenfall leaves increased the annual leaf biomass component of the litterfall by 12%. Concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were 2.3, 5.7, and 18.1% higher, respectively, in greenfall than in senescent leaves. Greenfall increased the annual input of C, N, and P by 12, 13, and 14%, respectively. Despite their short duration (approximately 70 minutes), the hailstorm events generated a substantial contribution of greenfall leaves and a source of extra C, N, and P, since these leaves decompose and are incorporated into the cloud forest system.\n\nPeru contains the second largest surface area of the Amazon biome. The Peruvian Amazon is threatened by logging, illegal crops, mining, and agricultural expansion. While a number of national parks exist in the Amazon region, privately managed areas like Conservation Concessions can be an attractive complement to existing parks. We compare medium and large mammal communities in a Conservation Concession in Ucayali with the nearby Parque Nacional Sierra del Divisor National Park and describe species relative abundance and richness of both protected areas. Results suggest that Conservation Concessions can harbour an important diversity of mammal species and could provide connections to larger protected areas. However, they are no substitutes for large protected areas, especially for sensitive and threatened species. Further research is needed to demonstrate their complementarity and improve landscape-level connectivity between conservation models.\n\nBergmann’s Rule describes an increase in the body size of endothermic animals with decreasing environmental temperatures. However, in ectothermic insects including moths, some of the few existing studies investigating size patterns along temperature gradients do not follow the Bergmann’s Cline. Intraspecific differences in moth sizes along spatiotemporal temperature gradients are unknown from the Palaeotropics, hindering general conclusions and understanding of the mechanism responsible. We measured intraspecific forewing size differences in 28 Afrotropical moth species sampled in 3 seasons along an elevational gradient on Mount Cameroon, West/Central Africa. Size increased significantly with elevation in 14 species but decreased significantly in 5 species. Additionally, we found significant inter-seasonal size differences in 21 species. Most of these variable species had longer forewings in the transition from the wet to dry season, which had caterpillars developing during the coldest part of the year. We conclude that environmental temperature affects the size of many Afrotropical moths, predominantly following prevailingly following Bergmann’s Cline. Nevertheless, the sizes of one-third of the species demonstrated a significant interaction between elevation and season. The responsible mechanisms can thus be assumed to be more complex than a simple response to ambient temperature.\n\nUnderstanding the quality of seed dispersal effectiveness of frugivorous species can elucidate how endozoochory structures tropical forests. Large seeds, containing more resources for growth, and gut passage by frugivores, which remove seed pulp, both typically enhance the speed and probability of germination of tropical seeds. However, the interaction of seed size and gut passage has not been well studied. We assessed the role of two species of toucans (Ramphastos spp.) in seed germination of the tropical tree Eugenia uniflora, which produces seeds that vary considerably in size (3.7–14.3 mm), using 151 control and 137 regurgitated seeds in germination trials. We found that toucan regurgitation did not increase germination success, although 93.4% germinated compared to 76.8% of control seeds; however, larger seeds germinated more often at faster rates. Although only marginally significant, germination rates were 3.6× faster when seeds were both large and regurgitated by toucans, demonstrating that toucan regurgitation can disproportionally benefit larger E. uniflora seeds. As tropical forests are increasingly disturbed and fragmented by human activities, the ability of toucans to continue providing seed dispersal services to degraded habitats may be vital to the persistence of many tropical plants that contain larger seeds and depend on larger dispersers.\n\nUnderstanding how vegetation structure and floristic composition vary across landscapes is fundamental to understand ecological patterns and for designing conservation actions. In a patch-landscape approach, we assessed the β-diversity (q0 order – rare species, q1 order – common species, and q2 order – dominant species) of plants between forest patches and surveyed plots in Atlantic Forest patches located in the Pernambuco Endemism Centre, northeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we tested the influence of predictor variables linked to landscape (forest cover and edge density) and habitat (basal area), as well as the geographical distance between forest patches and plots on the β-diversity in each forest patch and plot. We measured and identified a total of 1,682 individuals (trees and lianas), corresponding to 248 species, 116 genera, and 56 families in 10 plots (50 × 2 m) from each forest patch. The β-diversity presented lower values for the Mata de Água Azul patch at a landscape scale (i.e., between forest patches) and Mata dos Macacos patch at a site scale (i.e., between plots) for all orders. Geographical distance positively influenced the β-diversity at the landscape scale, and higher turnover between plots (e.g., within forest patches) was positively associated with differences in geographical distance, edge density, forest cover, and basal area. Our results indicate the need to conserve forest patches distributed across a wide area (distant sites) that encompass different landscape contexts with different vegetation structures, in order to conserve greater floristic diversity.\n\nVariation in water colour is a remarkable characteristic of Amazonian rivers and reflects their limnological properties and the geomorphology of sub-basins. We present here a literature-based study to examine the relationships between fish species turnover and abiotic properties of Amazonian rivers with contrasting water colours. We analysed fish records and water physicochemical properties (pH, colour, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, ammonia and suspended solids) of eight Amazonian rivers with white-, black- and clearwaters. Rivers with similar water colour shared more fish species than those that contrasted in colour. Increased differences in abiotic parameters imply an increased dissimilarity in fish species composition. Species composition is also related to distance among rivers with high dissimilarity observed in rivers distant to each other. The fish species turnover could be ultimately driven by the geological history of rivers which provides different opportunities to speciation and biotic interchange. Water types likely influence species turnover by selecting fishes with different limits of physiological tolerance and specialized use of different habitat types. Our findings suggest that river water colours are reliable proxies for historical and ecological mechanisms affected fish species distribution. Antropic disturbances of Amazonian rivers with distinct water colours could threaten unique fish assemblages.\n\nGlobal climate change has aggravated the severity of space competition put up by marine sponges in the tropical coral reef ecosystems. We report here an outbreak of coral-killing sponge Clathria (Microciona) aceratoobtusa (Carter, 1887) over live coral colonies of the genus Turbinaria in an unprotected reef (mainland patch reef) in the Gulf of Mannar in India. An outbreak of this orange-reddish sponge was observed during an explorative dive in April 2020. Live coral cover in the reef was 62.06% (SD±3.36), which was dominated by the genus Turbinaria with 82.31%. Among the total of 549 Turbinaria colonies counted in five transects, 21.86% (n = 120) of colonies were found infested by the sponge. As the mainland patch reef lies outside the boundary of marine protected area, it is exposed to human-induced threats, apart from climate change implications. This report would serve as an evidence to indicate the intensity of the space competition waged by sponges in a disturbed reef ecosystem.\n\nHerbivory is an important ecological filter, affecting plant establishment in restoration sites. One group of herbivores whose abundance has been increasing with environmental changes are the leaf-cutting ants (LCA). Here we evaluated the influence of the surrounding landscape on Atta sexdens nest density in restoration sites, by testing the hypothesis that sites farthest from forest fragments or with less surrounding habitat cover have higher nest density. The study was conducted in eleven reforestations with native species, amidst an agricultural matrix in southern Brazil. For each site, we estimated LCA nest density (active, inactive and total) and landscape metrics (distance to nearest forest fragment, surrounding habitat area and an index combining both distance and surrounding habitat area, the Proximity Index). There were negative relationships between active and total nest density and surrounding habitat area. These results suggest that increased isolation from forest fragments is a factor contributing to the relaxation of top-down control. Therefore, the increase in A. sexdens population density in restoration sites is a result, at least in part, of low pressure from natural enemies, since LCA are not limited by resource availability.\n\nUsing species distribution modelling (SDMs) techniques, we predicted the biogeographic history of crickets commonly found in Neotropical caves as a way to detect potential long-term environmental refuges in South America. Our models were built based on a thorough investigation of existing database regarding the genus Endecous Saussure, 1878 (Ensifera: Phalangopsidae) occurrences. The predictions of their distribution were obtained for two paleoclimate scenarios (LGM — 21 ka and Mid-Holocene — 6 ka), the current climate scenario (0 ka) and one future global warming climate scenario (RCP8.5, 2080–2100). Our findings suggest that in the past, the potential distribution of the crickets was wider, with potential forest corridors connecting different karst areas with caves within their occupancy area. The future prediction indicates a drastic reduction in their spatial distribution with an increased potential for isolation in subterranean ecosystems. Atlantic humid forest patches and caves represent the main environmental refuges for these crickets. Considering the ongoing impacts on surface environments and future climate change, the conservation of caves and karst landscapes has become one of the main strategies for the maintenance of these crickets and all the correlated subterranean communities.\n\nMale and female dioecious tropical trees are subjected to distinct demands that may influence their ecology. An example is Myrianthus holstii Engl. that produces persistent fruit eaten by elephants and other large mammals that frequently damage the trees. Myrianthus holstii populations were assessed with 24 2-km transects, spanning an elevation range of 1435–2495 m in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. Of 1089 stems ≥ 5 cm diameter 449 were female, 383 were male and the rest were non-fertile. We also noted one apparently monoecious individual. Males produced flowers at smaller sizes than did females (minimum recorded diameters 5.5 cm and 6.8 cm, respectively). Both sexes had similar distributions, favouring moderately closed forest and mid-slope locations. Female trees were more frequently damaged and typically slightly shorter than males at large diameters. Seedling densities were positively associated with the presence of larger female trees. Our results are consistent with a life history where both sexes have similar requirements, but fruiting females experience a greater frequency of severe damage.\n\nFrugivorous mammals play an important role in maintaining biodiversity and are considered one of the main dispersers of large seeds. In this study, we describe the structure of the interaction network between non-flying mammals and seven plant species with large fruits in a megadiverse savanna-forest mosaic in the Brazilian Cerrado. We also evaluated the individual contribution of each species to the organization of the interaction network and tested whether body mass determined the mammals’ role in the network. To record frugivory events of mammals with arboreal and terrestrial habits, camera traps were installed at ground and canopy levels. We identified 18 mammal species interacting with seven plant species in 515 frugivory events. Our observations highlight an interaction network with a modular and non-nested topology and the important role of large mammals in the network structure, which reflects the importance of the group in potential seed dispersal. The extinction of large frugivorous mammals can cause several damages to ecosystem services in the Brazilian Cerrado through changes in network structure, especially threatening the survival of plant species with large fruits.\n\nDuring the last two decades, the world has witnessed the emergence and re-emergence of arthropod-borne viruses, better known as arboviruses. The close contact between sylvatic, rural and peri-urban vector species and humans has been mainly determined by the environment-modifying human activity. The resulting interactions have led to multiple dead-end host infections and have allowed sylvatic arboviruses to eventually adapt to new vectors and hosts, contributing to the establishment of urban transmission cycles of some viruses with enormous epidemiologic impact. The metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach has allowed obtaining unbiased sequence information of millions of DNA and RNA molecules from clinical and environmental samples. Robust bioinformatics tools have enabled the assembly of individual sequence reads into contigs and scaffolds partially or completely representing the genomes of the microorganisms and viruses being present in biological samples of clinical relevance. In this review, we describe the different ecological scenarios for the emergence of viral diseases, the virus adaptation process required for the establishment of a new transmission cycle and the usefulness of NGS and computational methods for the discovery and routine genomic surveillance of mosquito-borne viruses in their ecosystems.\n\nWe tested the effectiveness of predation by the cyclopoid copepod Mesocyclops longisetus (Thiébaud, 1912) in Culicidae and Chironomidae larvae, aiming to test if (i) the introduction of copepods effectively controls mosquito larvae and (ii) the density of copepods is important for ensuring control. We conducted two semi-field experiments: the first involved 14 experimental runs over 75 consecutive days, compared in a randomized block design, four repetitions per treatment in each experimental run (block); and the second experiment involved a total of five experimental runs, lasting 25 and 33 days each. In the first experiment, culicid larvae were preyed on by copepods, especially at high copepod densities (15 copepods per litre), which reduced culicid densities by approximately 61% and 64% for different containers, considering that the environmental temperature declined linearly by about 10ºC from February (summer) to May (autumn) (32ºC to 22ºC). Even the lowest copepod density (5 per liter) produced a substantial reduction in the abundance of culicid larvae when chironomid larvae were abundant. On the other hand, there was no effective control of chironomid larvae. In the second experiment, increases in Culicidae and Chironomidae were concomitant with decreases in copepods. Thus, when the copepods were in high densities, there was no increase in insects, although the larvae of culicids were not eliminated from the experimental units. We conclude that the introduction of copepods in small containers and ponds can be useful for the control of culicid larvae without harming chironomid populations, and densities up to 15 per litre are recommended, although even low densities cause substantial reduction.\n\nThe bushy-tailed opossum (Glironia venusta) is a small arboreal marsupial found in the Amazon basin. G. venusta is rarely seen and has few published sightings throughout its range. Videos (N = 79) were obtained from arboreal camera traps located in the Las Piedras Amazon Center near the Las Piedras River (SE Peru) from April 2017 until November 2017. Our new records, the first for the Las Piedras River, demonstrate that the species is nocturnal with activity peaks at 3:00 h and 20:00 h in the hours of complete darkness. The abundance of camera trap footage of such a rarely observed species further demonstrates the effectiveness of arboreal camera trapping to conduct species assessments.\n\nExtrafloral nectary plants not only occur in natural areas but also in urban parks. These areas are prone to edge effects, and plants face different microenvironmental conditions. We investigated the spatial variation of ant–plant interactions in an urban park, and we examined if plants with ants would show lower herbivory levels and if it depended on habitat type (interior or edges). Seedlings of Inga laurina were set in 200-m long transects (which covered both the west and east edges, and the interior) in an urban park and then experimentally assigned to be either ant-present or ant-excluded plants. Leaf herbivory was investigated throughout the wet season and was influenced by the interaction effect between ants and habitat type. Ants decreased the herbivory on the west edge, but on the east edge results were the opposite. The east edge had higher temperature and sunlight exposure in comparison to the other sites and was assumed to disrupt the stability of ant–plant interactions. In the interior of the fragment, herbivory depended on ant presence/absence and on the location of plants along the transect. Our study highlights how the outcomes of ant–plant interactions are spatially conditioned and affected by different types of habitats.\n\nOne of the biggest issues in plant ecology is determining the interaction outcome between seeds and scatter-hoarding rodents because the latter has a dual role as dispersers and predators of seeds. Density-dependence contexts involving resource abundance largely influence the outcome of this interaction. Here, we investigated how the variation in the density of a large-seeded tropical tree (Joannesia princeps Vell) affects its probability of seed removal, consumption, dispersal, and burial by a neotropical rodent (Dasyprocta azarae Lichtenstein). We tested whether the elevated resource availability in high tree density areas would cause scatter hoarder’s satiation by decreasing seed removal and consumption (predator satiation hypothesis) or increasing seed dispersal and burial (predator dispersal hypothesis). We tracked the fate of 461 seeds in 14 plots with distinct J. princeps abundances inside a large Atlantic Forest fragment. We used spool-and-line tracking and camera trappings to determine seed fate and identify interacting animals. Agouti was the only species removing J. princeps seeds. Tree density benefitted J. princeps by increasing seed dispersal through buried seed but not affecting seed removal and consumption. This result shows how density-dependent contexts, such as tree density, may alter seed fate in seed–rodent interactions supporting future studies aiming to reestablishing seed dispersal functions in Atlantic Forest fragments.\n\nMonoon liukiuense (Annonaceae) is an endangered tree species distributed in Iriomote Island and Hateruma Island in the Ryukyu (Nansei) Islands, Japan, and in Orchid Island (Lanyu) in Taiwan. While its habitat is confined to small areas surrounded by human-altered landscapes, the matured trees bear abundant fruits, and many offspring grow under the mother trees. M. liukiuense is hypothesised to have lost effective seed dispersers. To test this hypothesis, fate of its seeds and the behaviour of frugivores were observed using time-lapse photography during three fruiting seasons from June 2015 to August 2016 in Iriomote Island, Japan. Although several animal taxa were observed to consume the fruit pulp, only two volant animals, namely the Yaeyama flying fox and large-billed crow, were proposed as seed dispersal agents for M. liukiuense. The present study shows that an average of 82% of the fruits in the canopies fell directly beneath the fruiting trees and an average of 90% of the seeds on the forest floor remained in their original positions. These results suggest that M. liukiuense has lost most of its seed dispersal agents and the chance to expand its distribution.\n\nGrowing urban expansion can alter ecological processes within trophic networks. Predation on herbivores is known to vary with the size of the area covered by vegetation, successional stage, altitude and predator community structure; however there are gaps in understanding how this occurs in urban and suburban environments. The purpose of this study was to determine whether predation pressure on artificial models of caterpillars varied with the degree of urbanisation and type of substrate. Artificial caterpillars were placed on two types of substrates (leaf vs. stem) in two areas of the city (urban vs. suburban). Total predation was measured as the number of models with evidence of attack by predators, with the predation rate estimated on a weekly basis. Predation was affected by the degree of urbanisation, being higher in urban (x̄ = 9.88%; SD = 4.09%, n = 8) than suburban areas (x̄ = 5.75%, SD = 4.21%, n = 8). Attack marks were observed in 23.8% (n = 125) of artificial caterpillars. The weekly predation rate on leaves (x̄ = 9.63%, SD = 5.95%, n = 8) was higher than that on stems (x̄ = 6%, SD = 4.2%, n = 8). These results suggest that the incidence of predation might vary with the degree of urbanisation and by the type of substrate on which prey organisms are found.\n\nFerns (Polypodiophyta) are an abundant floral element of the tropics with high sensitivity to environmental conditions and good indicators of overall biodiversity. Here, we set out to identify which geochemical factors determine fern diversity in a low-montane tropical rainforest in Eastern Ecuador. We conducted a field survey of high-spatial resolution completing a comprehensive fern inventory across two elevational ranges, combined with biochemical characterisation of the underlying soils. While α-diversity was negatively correlated with cation exchange capacity (CEC) and with elevation, β-diversity increased with elevation and with geographic distance, as predicted. Our results confirm that ferns have a high sensitivity to both elevational and environmental gradients, where the latter in this study was derived from enhanced aluminium, iron and calcium contents in some of the studied soils. Further monitoring of fern communities could therefore help to better understand and predict how environmental change may impact biodiversity, with a particular focus on threats potentially arising from toxic elements being released in tropical soils through modified soil CEC."
