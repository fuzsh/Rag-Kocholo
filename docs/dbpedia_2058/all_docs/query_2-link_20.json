        "text": "4. Discussion\n\nThe human seropositivity of 44/200 (22.0%) individuals herein has been the second highest reported to date in Brazil, surpassed only by a series of reported Q fever cases with 10/16 (62.5%) in Minas Gerais state, Brazil [14]. All previous Brazilian serosurveys have reported lower seropositivity, including 1/61 (1.6%) patients with infective endocarditis in Sao Paulo state [15], 4/125 (3.2%) HIV-positive patients in Rio de Janeiro state [16], 17/437 (3.9%) in healthy individuals from Minas Gerais state, southeastern [17], 25/437 (5.72%) Dengue suspected patients in Minas Gerais state [18], 4/51 (7.8%) patients with culture-negative endocarditis in São Paulo state [19], 26/272 (10.0%) Dengue suspected patients in Rio de Janeiro state [20], and 129/604 (21.4%) Dengue suspected patients in São Paulo state [21]. If considering the Tronco community itself, with 17/39 (43.6%) seropositive individuals, the study herein had the highest reported frequency in healthy populations in Brazil.\n\nDespite these few studies, Brazil still has the highest number of Q fever surveys in Latin America, followed by French Guyana, Colombia, Ecuador, and Argentina [22]. French Guiana presented an incidence rate (100,000 inhabitants/year) of 37 cases from 1990 to 2006, with 132 sampled patients [23], and of 27.4 cases from 2007 to 2017, with 695 sampled patients [24]. In addition, French Guiana reported Q fever in 32/131 (24.4%) patients with pneumonia and 25/275 (9.1%) with suspected Dengue [25,26]. A total of 83/153 (54.2%) cases were reported in slaughterhouse workers in Medellín, Colombia [27], 13/54 (24.1%) in veterinary professionals and students in Quito, Ecuador [28], and 1/99 (1.0%) in the healthy population of Buenos Aires, Argentina [29]. The study of vulnerable populations has brought a different perspective on how zoonotic diseases affect populations, alerting them to new associated risk factors and demanding a One Health approach to human, animal, and environmental health [30]. In the Brazilian Amazon, an indigenous population was investigated, which resulted in no (0/73) seropositive individuals [31]. In French Guyana, a cross-sectional study of illegal miners showed 11/380 (2.9%) seropositivity [32]. Based on such findings, the quilombola seropositivity (22.0%) herein becomes the highest in Latin America to date, highlighting the exposure of vulnerable Brazilian populations.\n\nAlthough this is the highest Latin American prevalence in a healthy population, a study in Africa showed 86/137 (62.8%) seropositive pastoralists in Nigeria, likely due to livestock contact on rural farms [33]. Not surprisingly, large epidemics have occurred in farm populations in the Netherlands and Australia. Pathogen maintenance in such populations may become a serious human and animal health issue, impairing disease control and leading to social and economic losses [34,35].\n\nQ fever has been indicated as an underestimated disease and an emerging health concern in Brazil [10]. Molecular and serological surveys have found, respectively, 44/360 (12.2%) positive bovines [36] and 129/604 (21.4%) positive humans [21] in São Paulo state, southeastern Brazil. The occurrence of Q fever has been evidenced since 2016 in Rio de Janeiro state [20,37].\n\nThe serological 1:128 cutoff point has been defined to determine acute disease in persons with Q fever [38]. Although the study herein has been designed for a survey of four clinically healthy quilombola populations, 9/200 (4.5%) of the total, or 9/44 (20.4%) of positive individuals, presented ≥1:128 serology, suggesting a recent infection. No titer ≥1:800 was found, considered a chronic disease characteristic [38]. Noteworthy, C. burnetii can remain in the body for years, even in asymptomatic cases, later developing serious complications such as endocarditis and hepatitis [4,5,39].\n\nIn the present study, we noted that individuals living in quilombola communities showed significant seropositivity for C. burnetii as a reflection of the sum of rural habits and characteristics, such as proximity to cattle. When eliminated by aerosols at the time of animal calving or as a result of abortions, C. burnetii spores attach themselves to dust and travel by wind, reaching up to 30 km from the aerosolization site [40]. Similarly, workers who spend most of the day on farms were more seropositive than those working in urban environments, probably due to their contact with cattle.\n\nConsumption of undercooked meat was associated with C. burnetii seropositivity. Although the role of raw and undercooked meat in C. burnetii remains to be described, molecular studies have detected C. burnetii in meat samples of cattle, buffalo, goats, and sheep collected from the slaughterhouses of Pakistan [41] and in raw meat destined exclusively for companion animal consumption in Australia [42].\n\nThe epidemiology of Q fever remains to be clarified, demanding an investigation of all possible associated risk factors. Although milk contamination by C. burnetti has been reportedly observed [40,43,44], its presence was not statistically associated with population seropositivity, and raw milk consumption remains to be fully established as an important human transmission route. On the other hand, the consumption of undercooked meat was significantly associated with seropositivity. Contact with ectoparasites does not seem to be an important factor for human infection, although ticks may be commonly infected [45,46]. Despite contact with dogs not being a risk factor, contact with dog abortions and vaginal fluids has been significant for infection [45]. Although not statistically significant, abortion in women was highly referred to and may require more attention, since 5/16 (31.3%) of the women who mentioned abortion were seropositive. Data on human abortions resulting from Q fever has been scarce, and such a risk factor should be further investigated.\n\nDogs may become at risk of infection at the time of birth or in cases of abortion [47]. In other situations, dogs may not present a risk of transmission to humans or other animals [10]. The existence of only one seropositive dog in the present study and in the community with a lower percentage of seropositive human samples may indicate that dogs have distinct infection routes. Shedding patterns of C. burnetii in dogs have not been assessed, and the association between dogs and human infection is a query to be evaluated. Nevertheless, the serological outcome of our survey may suggest that dogs are not a potential source of C. burnetii for humans. Although there was low dog sampling, this is the first study that concomitantly accessed human and dog populations under socioeconomic vulnerability. In the present study, human seropositivity was associated with canine abortion contact. Thus, further studies should be conducted to clarify the role of dogs in C. burnetti transmission in such areas.\n\nDespite small domestic ruminants being recognized as its main transmission source [48], C. burnetii was also reported in large ruminants and detected in bovine abortion remains in southeastern Brazil [36]. There were approximately 213,000 cattle farms in Paraná State at the time of the survey, with approximately 6.3 million cattle heads and dairy production accounting for 25% of the local economy [49]. Although C. burnetii in wildlife has been studied worldwide [48,50,51], few studies were conducted in Brazil, including detection in 6/131 (4.6%) of the wild rodents of southeastern Brazil [52], in 4/21 (19.0%) Artibeus spp. bats in northeastern Brazil [53], and in 9/169 (5.32%) deer in southeast and central-western Brazil [54]. In addition, future studies should also investigate the role of other livestock populations in C. burnetti transmission in such communities in Paraná State.\n\nOur study presents some limitations regarding its results. First, we have not performed IgM detection. Although IgM antibodies may provide ancillary information to IgG titers in human serodiagnosis, IgM specificity has been much lower than IgG, with higher cross-reactivity, making it not ideally the best C. burnetii detection tool in exposed populations [38,55]. In addition, an in-house serological test for Q fever was used instead of commercially available kits, which may have generated differences in positivity and correspondent titers. However, the in-house assay produced for the study herein with the Argentine antigen has proven to be very efficient in detecting anti-phase II antibodies, i.e., IgG anti-C. burnetii antibodies, in patients with Q fever [13].\n\nAs this study was a convenience survey with no random sampling, biased outcomes may be a limitation, as statistical differences on associated risk factors among groups may not represent the actual possibilities. However, as Q fever epidemiology has been poorly understood, the inferences herein may still be valuable as potential insights and associated causes of exposure in quilombola populations. Bearing in mind such limitations, the data herein have indicated the habits of communities as potential associated risk factors, which may also impact other infectious diseases and therefore common prevention measures.\n\nDespite the fact that the health impact of C. burnetii on the studied population could not be confirmed, as a healthy population was tested in a single sampling, the primary aim herein was to assess the C. burnetti exposure in this vulnerable population. As C. burnetti was detected in the quilombola population by sole sampling, further studies should screen and investigate febrile cases in quilombola communities locally, as fever may reappear further, being reactivated in seropositive individuals. Nonetheless, despite not characterizing active infections or differentiating acute from persistent infection, the evidence herein of anti-C. burnetti antibodies has indicated exposure in such a vulnerable population and should be further investigated."
