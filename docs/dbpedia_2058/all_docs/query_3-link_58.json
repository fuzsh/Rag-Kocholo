        "meta_description": "IBI-The Institute of Brazilian Issues was established in 1990 to promote stronger U.S.-Brazil relations within the changing international order. IBI seeks to do so by working with all interested parties, and especially the business sectors of both countries. It encourages the resolution of differences, and helps to identify areas where relations might be expanded. In essence, IBI promotes a greater convergence of viewpoints and interests between the two nations. The Institute operates within the Center for Latin American Issues, an integral part of the School of Business. The Institute's day-to-day activities are organized and directed by Kevin Kellbach.",
