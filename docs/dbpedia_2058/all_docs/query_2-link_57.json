        "text": "The Shop\n\nAt least three of Lisbon’s Historic Shops (Manteigaria Silva, A Minhota and this one) take us back to a time when dairy products were sold in specialised shops. A manteigaria sold butter; a leitaria sold milk. It was not rare for the latter to have a cow on site, and it is believed this was the case on the present-day A Camponeza premises. People would come with their own containers and bought the milk straight from the cow.\n\nBut it was after these customs had died out that José Domingues Diogo founded his A Camponeza business in 1907. He took advantage of the customer base that would go there for their dairy products and built on that renown. Decades later the shop became a café, and today it functions as a restaurant. The current owner took over the space in 2011, which is also the year when significant renovation work was carried out, whilst maintaining the most important features of the space, in particular the azulejo panels on the façade and interior and the Art Nouveau style relief decoration on the ceilings and supporting beams and structures.\n\nAs in A Minhota, the decorative tiles here depict pastoral themes and milk production. They recall a city with an extensive rural periphery which also invaded the bohemian centre, the bourgeois centre, the chic centre that was the Baixa and Chiado districts. The new elements introduced by this recent renovation work were the wallpaper, new furniture and stained glass on the walls. Of course, each new management leaves its own mark on a business, and the Camponeza of the 80s differs from that of the 90s and that of the present day. Today, for example, it serves full meals. The customers have also changed, but then again, so has the city of Lisbon.\n\nFor decades A Camponeza did not serve meals; it was more a café with fresh pastries. They did not make their own pastries. It was closer in terms of service to what A Minhota offers today, just a kilometre away. It was a meeting place for a certain group of customers – from the neighbourhood, workers from the local banks, embassies and offices, and students would also come down from the School of Fine Arts, when architecture was still taught there. So, in addition to the convivial atmosphere of A Camponeza, it also became a meeting place for artists. Music, above all, was a reference: in the 80s people like Vitorino and Janita Salomé would frequently come for late afternoon snacks."
