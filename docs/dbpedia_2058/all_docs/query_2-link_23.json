        "text": "Amerigo Vespucci (Florence, 9 March 1454-Seville, 22 February 1512) and his life are among the most diffusely studied and talked about subjects within the history of the European expansion and, in particular, of the mundus novus. Three cities stand out in Vespucci’s biography: Florence, Seville and Lisbon. In Florence, he first became acquainted with the distinguished cultural ambiance surrounding Marsilio Ficino, and was under the patronage of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici (1463–1503), or Lorenzo il Popolano (Lorenzo the Peasant)—cousin of Lorenzo de’ Medici. In Seville he worked for the Florentine merchant Giannozzo Berardi, a commercial agent of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and one of Christopher Columbus’ lenders. In Seville and Lisbon, on the other hand, Vespucci embarked on—or according to some simply invented—four extraordinary oceanic voyages, which he systematically described in his compelling written narrative, as noted by Todorov.1 Such (real or alleged) voyages were to have taken place between 1497 and 1504, after which in 1508 Vespucci was chosen as the first Piloto Mayor (Pilot Major) of the Casa de la Contratación (the House of Trade) of Seville. Vespucci’s vicissitudes have been investigated by a substantial international cohort of historians against the backdrop of the corpus of studies on (and glorifications of) Christopher Columbus—whom, by the way, Vespucci himself met upon his first arrival at Seville thanks to Giannozzo Berardi. It was these studies that brought life to the so-called “Vespuccian question.”\n\nThe following notes want to introduce and contextualize the contributions contained in the volume, which explore some commonly studied topics related to Vespucci, but have also the merit of prompting further reflection on issues that have not been addressed by historians so far, or at least not in relation to Vespucci. Aimed at an audience of non-specialists and mainly based on documentary sources, while resting on the critical and philological contribution by Luciano Formisano, Ilaria Luzzana Caraci and Consuelo Varela, this essay frames the complex vicissitudes of Amerigo’s life, their receptions and implications, exploring the intense cultural and historical dynamics that shaped the crucial decades between the end of the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth century.2←7 | 8→\n\nIn short, Vespucci’s legacy has been linked to two early sixteenth-century books: the Mundus novus and the so-called Lettera al Soderini.3 The Mundus novus was possibly first printed in Latin in Florence in 1503 (though if this edition ever existed, it is lost). Other probable prints also followed: in Paris the same year,4 later in Augsburg in 15045 (the first edition with a precise date) and Rome,6 then in Strasbourg in 1505 where it was almost immediately republished under the title of De ora antarctica per regem Portugallie pridem inuenta,7 in a German translation in Basel8 and Antwerp9 in 1505, and lastly in Nuremberg in 1506.10 This pamphlet tells the story of a voyage carried out by Vespucci between 1501 and 1502, reaching 52˚ S. in the western South Atlantic on a ship belonging to the Portuguese crown. An important moment in the textual history of the Mundus novus was its reprinting in Venice in 1507, when the text was translated into Venetian, edited by the grammarian and cosmographer Fracanzio da Montalboddo (active in the Venetian region between the second half of the fifteenth century and the first decades of the sixteenth century),11 and significantly entitled Paesi nouamente retrouati et Nouo Mondo da Alberico Vesputio Florentino intitulato. Having broadly circulated Europe, this six-book travel anthology mostly included unpublished reports and letters on the Spanish and Portuguese discoveries between 1454 and 1504.12 The Paesi nouamente retrouati were reedited into Latin in←8 | 9→ Milan in 1508, and later into French in 1514, besides being often reprinted into Venetian until around 1520. Thanks to the number of “single editions” of the work as well as the anthology compiled by Fracanzio da Montalboddo in Latin, German and Venetian, the Mundus novus circulated widely throughout Europe in a multilingual format."
