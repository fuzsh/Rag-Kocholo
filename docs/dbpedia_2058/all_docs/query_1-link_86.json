        "text": "1975, Mozambique's rebirth as an independent nation. The young revolution sweeps the streets of Maputo clean of prostitutes and bad habits. The prostitutes are sent to re-education camps deep in the countryside, where they will become \"new women\" - loyal comrades of the new nation. As the \"clean-up\" takes place, Margarida, a 16-year-old girl from the countryside, is mistakenly taken. Drawing on the stories of real women, Virgin Margarida is a dramatic exploration of a little known chapter in Mozambique's history. A chapter that made no allowance for individuality and enshrined male domination as an ideology.\n\nBased on Ant√≥nio Lobo Antunes's novel, a collection of letters written by a young soldier, doctor and a aspirant writer, to his wife while he was serving in Angola between 1971 and 1973, during the Portuguese Colonial War, a war between Portugal with its former overseas provinces.\n\nTwo Angola, the colonial and the contemporary, spaced 60 years, share the curse of a mysterious island. In the past, the epicenter of the tragedy is an evil fortress, tomb of revolutionaries deported from the mainland. In the present, the building of a luxurious resort awakens the relentless jaw of justice. Soon after, workmen lacerated dead bodies, begin to appear. The horror spreads rapidly. Pedro Mbala is sent to the island to solve the problem. His target is a pack of stray dogs.\n\nAfter her daughter's death, Rita returns to the African country of her childhood to investigate the death of Yvone Kane, a former political activist and guerrilla fighter. There, she becomes embroiled in a journey into the past of a land haunted by war and evil.\n\nThe film tells the tale of Iala, whose authority over his two sons, Raul and Bedan, is shaken. Raul has left to study in a seminary in the big city, where unknown to anyone, he has joined the liberation movement. Meanwhile, younger son, Bedan is rebelling against every possible tradition, even eyeing his father's young bride-to-be.\n\nMozambique, 24th of December 1969, a Portuguese army patrol return to headquarters bringing in a prisoner. A few hours later, he is found dead in his cell. Who killed him? and why? tensions grow, while an attack to the headquarters is under way...\n\nEvery year, four ex-soldiers who call themselves \"Os Imortais\" (\"The Immortals\"), get together with four women to celebrate their war deeds and remember the old days, back in the war. On the summer of 1985, tired of their monotonous lives, they decide to rob a bank. Joaquim Malarranha, a chief inspector from the local police force who is about to retire, crosses their path and chooses to spend his last days of duty trying to solve the robbery. But as he carries on with his investigation, he discovers more than he could have ever imagined...\n\nEpisodes from entire military history of Portugal are told through flashbacks as a professorish soldier recounts them while marching through a Portuguese African colony in 1973. He easily draws his comrades into philosophical musings, and the little contingent suffers badly at the hands of the local military opposition.\n\nPortugal, 1973. Mario, a former war fighter from Guinea, intends to return to his hometown. It brings with it a vague sense of guilt, in the death of two men - a soldier and a native - by alarm he gave during the night. In Lisbon, he finds Margarida - the widow of his dead companion - a woman who swings between madness and premeditated theatricality. Mario is looking for a deputy whose fifth in the north of the country, his family had worked - and he intends precisely to be given a job there .\n\nAntonio is a retired aviator from the Portuguese colonial wars. He falls in love with a member of the resistance against the dictatorship of Antonio d'Oliveira Salazar. He is arrested and escapes with his love. The code word among the resisters is: 'Life is Beautiful.'"
