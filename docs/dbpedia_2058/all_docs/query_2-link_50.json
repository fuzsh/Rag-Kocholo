This kind of action could move different species of animals from their natural habitat to urban or rural areas, which can lead to the dispersion of different etiological agents such rotavirus and picobirnavirus, showing their zoonotic potential, and increasing their genetic diversity. This study detected the circulation of rotavirus in 9/23 samples of wild, and exotic avian, and 1/23 for picobirnavirus from different cities of Pará state, Brazil. We report the first occurrence of rotavirus A, D, F, G, and Genogroup I of picobirnavirus in wild, exotic birds in Brazil, and worldwide. Our data correlated the pathogens with cities, and symptoms. The data emphasize the scarce of epidemiological monitoring of these pathogens, and the importance of epidemiological studies to obtain the ecology, and evolution of rotavirus, and picobirnavirus in animals population as well as the negative impacts in animal health.",

        "text": "Results and discussion\n\nAll samples were tested by PAGE, RT-qPCR, and RT-PCR/Nested for RVA (NSP3, VP7, VP4, and NSP4 genes), RVD (VP6 gene), RVF (VP6 gene), RVG (VP6 gene), and PBV (RdRp gene). The analysis by PAGE showed negativity for 23 samples, and there was no electrophoretic migration characteristic of RV and PBV. However, RT-qPCR was positive in five of eight cities for RVA, detected in 39.1% (9/23) of avian fecal specimens from Castanhal, Capanema, Inhapagi, Paragominas, and Santa Izabel (Table 3). No case was registered in Belém, Benevides, and Capitão-Poço. On the other hand, Castanhal had the highest frequency, 44.5% (4/9) of the cases, and exhibited positivity for both RV and PBV (Fig 1).\n\nAll data were built with public demographic data available on IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) with SIRGAS2000 (Geocentric Reference System for the Americas) obtaining coordinates from Pará state, Brazil and It can be found in https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/organizacao-do-territorio/malhas-territoriais/15774-malhas.html?=&t=downloads.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.g001\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.t003\n\nThe frequency of diarrhea sign was 82.6% (19/23) with a higher frequency of 60.9% in adult animals (14/23). The frequency of positivity for rotavirus was found in 9/23 birds (39.1%), and 3/9 (33.3%) were in adult animals with 8/9 (88.8%) diarrheal signs. Refering to picobirnavirus 1/23 (4.3%) sample was positive. It belongs a non-adult that presented diarrheal sign. Therefore, due to a low number of samples for analysis in this study, this fact contributed for no significance for p ≤0.05 between rotavirus, and picobirnavirus detection, diarrhea sing, and animal age, as shown in (Table 4).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.t004\n\nNotably, the results are contrasting with the findings of Guerreiro et al. [26] that reported negative results for the 23 fecal samples of migratory birds for rotavirus, and PBV, using the same primers of this study. It is worth mentioning that these animals did not present clinical signs differently from the signs presented in the animals of present study, and it could be an indication of lower viral load presented by these animals. In addition, the low sensitivity of the PAGE was recorded, and may be justified due to the low viral load excreted by birds, corroborating the data from Masachessi et al. [11], Guerreiro et al. [26], Fregolente et al. [27], and Barros et al. [28], which displayed no electrophoretic profile in the positive samples. In relation to PBV, the primers pair used by Rosen et al. [20] is limited generating a short amplicon of 200 bp for Genogroup I, and ~300 bp for Genogroup II, which can lead a negative result. This is the reason in the present study we used the Nested PCR by Malik et al. [21].\n\nThe higher CT-values in RT-qPCR ranged from 33 to 39.1 (mean = 37.38), hence indicating the presence of low viral load of RVA in wild specimens. Remarkably, Barros et al. [28] demonstrated that RT-qPCR assay is an efficient tool to detect RVA in specimens with low viral load. In this study, it was further possible to perform detection and genotyping for NSP3, VP7 and VP4 genes of RVA, with greater recovery of RVA sequences. This occurred probably due to the use of the nucleic acid extraction method (silica glass powder) described by Boom et al. [12], in contrast to Barros et al. [28] who used TRIzol, and characterized 1.25% (8/648) of the samples only for the VP4 gene. In fact, TRIzol has the capacity to extract RNA with high integrity. However, chloroform residues can consume the RT-qPCR reagents, and may cause amplification failure, hence justifying the low rate of molecular characterization reported by Barros et al. [28].\n\nOur specimens had low load viral, and the short nucleotide sequences obtained of the VP7 (~193bp), and VP4 (~214bp) genes could not characterize these genes. Even with the enrichment viral step, and the sequences analyses just shown the different clades of reported genotypes, we could describe the prevalence of G3 equine-like (7/9), G1 (1/9), G6 (1/9), and P[2] (5/9) genotypes among the avian. Thus, the nucleotide sequences in this study showed more similarity to the human strains owing to limited nucleotide sequences of wild birds origin in databases [29]. The genotypes already reported circulating in birds are T4 and T8 for NSP3 gene [17,30–33], G5 [32], G6 [34], G7 [35], G8 [36], G10 [34], G11 [33], G17 [33], G18 [36], G19 [36], G22 [37], G23 [30] for VP7 gene [31,34–38], and P[1] [37], P[17] [35], P[30] [17], P[31] [35], P[35] [28] and P[37] [29], P[38] [28] for VP4 gene [18,30,41,37,39].\n\nIn this study, one sample of nine was generated with specific amplicon of 1078 bp for the T2 genotype of the NSP3 gene in an adult Savanna Hawk (Heterospizias meridionalis) of undeterminated gender, which belonged to the T2 genotype of RVA, revealing 100% nucleotide homology with a human strain detected in Belgium in 2009 (JF460831), as shown in Fig 2. Importantly, this is the first report involving the circulation of T2 genotype in wild birds. Since this sample belongs to a rescue bird next to BR-316 road and we suggest the emergence of the Genotype T2 in the Amazon region, evidencing a possible circulation in wild birdlife.\n\nThe sequence of this study is represents in bold, and the black color depicts the birds. The numbers next to the nodes indicate bootstrap values > 70.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.g002\n\nRegarding the VP7 gene, it was possible to obtain eight of nine sequences of the samples, generating a 193 bp amplicon (Fig 3) with G3 equine-like prevalence (6/9), and the same hawk sample grouped in the unusual G3 equine-like genotype with proximity to an Orange-winged Parrot (Amazona amazonica) sample which also belong to this genotype. This sample was collected in 2018, and grouped in the same clade.\n\nThe sequences of this study are represent in different colors. The orange color depicts the G3 genotype, the green color depicts the G1 genotype, and the blue color depicts the G6 genotype. The numbers next to the nodes indicate bootstrap values > 70.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.g003\n\nThe sample from canary (Serinus canaria), also collected in 2018 was grouped in a different clade, reporting G3 equine-like strain [40]. The canary, and the Savanna Hawk were obtained from Castanhal, and the Orange-winged Parrot from Inhangapi. These birds showed clinical signs of diarrhea.\n\nThese findings emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring of RVA in virtue of the previous report of the equine-like G3 genotype in the Amazon Region [41], originated from the selective pressure of zoonotic strains, and due to the possible presence in different ecological niches mainly in anthropic areas. The diarrhea sample from a thrush (Turdus sp.) came from Paragominas formed a clade separately from the other samples of the G3 genotype. The other two diarrheic samples belonging to a toucan (Ramphastus sp.), and a cockatiel (Nymphicus hollandicus) were obtained from Castanhal and Capanema, respectively. These specimens were grouped in the same clade [42]. This genotype is considered the most virulent, justifying the diarrheal condition evidenced by the animals grouped in the G3 genotype [41].\n\nThe RVA genotype G3 is considered the third most common genotype due to a larger spectrum of hosts, and a greater potential for interspecies transmission in comparison to the human genotypes G1, G2, and G4. This genotype is circulating in wild animals, as well as in others, such as cattle, canines, equines, swine, leporids, ovine, camelids, rodents, felines, simians, bats, and also in humans [29]. The present study is the first to report the circulation of G3 genotype in wild birds, and exotic species, and scientific evidence indicates the possible interspecies transmission or exposure of these animals to the same source of contamination.\n\nIn 2017, Bezerra et al. [43] reported the circulation of the G3 genotype in samples from quilombolas of the Amazon Region, which had similarity with G3 from animal origin (simian, bats, llama, horse, and alpaca). Nevertheless, further studies on the genotypic constellation of the RV genomic segments on the specimens evaluated are needed in order to obtain data regarding their distribution, and the possible natural reservoirs of the G3 genotype in wild fauna.\n\nOne diarrheic sample from Rufous-bellied Thrush (Turdus rufiventris) collected in Castanhal reported G1 genotype, which has been reported in humans [44], bears [45], sheep, cattle, llamas [46], and pigs [47]. In addition, one diarrheic sample from Chestnut-bellied Seed-Finch (Sporophila angolensis) from Paragominas showed the human G6 genotype, and it has been reported in birds (this genotype was related in turkey farms, and there is no reports on wild birds) [39], cattle [47], sheep [48], pigs [49], horses [50], antelopes [51], leporids [52], doe [53], and human [54].\n\nThe birds to the order Passeriformes (seed-finch and thrush) represent the most illegally marketed group, corresponding to 90% of the avian traffic, due to their beautiful singing. In turn, Psittaciformes (parrot) represent 6%, due to their colored feathers, and other genera of birds correspond to 4% [55]. In this study, the human genotypes circulating in seed-finch, and thrush can be justified owing to human contact arising from the illegal commercialization of these birds, characterizing the first record in worldwide of genotypes G1 and G6 in wild birds.\n\nRegarding to VP4 gene, genotype P[2] is an uncommon one, rarely reported in the literature, which has been recently studied. However, it has been found in humans, simians [56,57], llamas, and alpacas [42]. In this study, it was possible to obtain five of the nine sequences of the samples, producing an amplicon with 214 bp. All the samples grouped in the same clade showed distance from other samples detected worldwide that presented the P[2] genotype, as shown in Fig 4. These specimens came from one thrush (Turdus sp.) from Paragominas, one Orange-winged Parrot (Amazona amazonica) from Inhangapi, one toucan (Rhamphastus sp.), one Rufous-bellied Thrush (Turdus rufiventris), and one Savanna Hawk (Heterospizias meridionalis) from Castanhal.\n\nThe sequence of this study is represents in bold, and the black color depicts the birds. The numbers next to the nodes indicate bootstrap values > 70.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.g004\n\nTherefore, it is the first report of the circulation of genotype P[2] in Brazil. Recently, Rojas et al. [42] reported the unusual genotype P[2] circulating in llamas, alpacas, and humans in Peru, thus revealing the zoonotic potential associated with the circulation of genotypes G1, and G3 in these animals. The findings suggest the close interaction of humans, and wild animals that can result in the breaking of the barrier between species, resulting in the adaptation of RV to new hosts.\n\nThese data corroborate with Asano et al. [39], and Da Silva et al. [58] who reported bovine, and swine genotypes in birds, emphasizing the interspecies transmission of RVA involved in the wild cycle on Amazon. Previous study of Luchs and Timenetsky [29] showed the prevalence of genotype G3 in wildlife. However, noted birds represent 80% of animal species illegally marketed in Brazil. This practice imposes a risk to biodiversity, and affects the health of animals, which are often in precarious situations such as malnutrition, abrasions, immune weakness, overcrowding in cages, absence of hygienic space, and which may be exposed to different etiological agents. Wild and exotic birds are considered potential reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, human and environmental health can be influenced, unbalancing the biological cycle of several pathogens, justifying the presence of unusual genotypes in the specimens under study [55,59].\n\nHowever, due to high capacity of rearrangement of RV, and PBV more studies must be conducted with all genomics segments. In addition, more samples of wild animals need to be collected to report molecular datas, contributing to understand the transmission pattern between animals and humans as well as analyze the prevalence of strains in different populations correlating the viruses with environmental degradation.\n\nRegarding to avian rotaviruses (RVA, RVD, RVF and RVG), one sample was amplified simultaneously for RVA, RVD, and RVF (1/23). They produced amplicons of 642 bp (NSP4) (Fig 5), 742 bp, and 846 bp for the VP6 gene (Fig 6). The sample was obtained from an Orange-winged Parrot (Amazona amazonica) from Santa Izabel, which showed no clinical signs of diarrhea, however, manifested deficiency of cardiovascular, ocular, and upper respiratory systems, rendering the bird susceptible to viral infections.\n\nThe sequence of this study is represents in bold, and the black color depicts the birds. The numbers next to the nodes indicate bootstrap values > 70.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.g005\n\nThe sequences of this study are represent in different colors. The blue color depicts the RVD, the green color depicts the RVF. The numbers next to the nodes indicate bootstrap values > 70.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.g006\n\nBarros et al. [27] reported the presence of RVA by RT-qPCR in 23.6% of poultry, and wild birds circulating in the Amazon Brazilian biome. Bezerra et al. [18], Da Silva et al. [58], and Mascarenhas et al. [19] detected RVD, RVA, RVF, and RVG in broiler chicken in the same cities explored in this study (Belém, Ananindeua, Inhangapi, Benevides, Castanhal, and Santa Izabel). In this study, the parrot specimen reported 100% similarity with the reference strains for RVA (JN374839), RVD (KJ101587), and RVF (KP824808) circulating in the Amazon Region. No positivity was recorded for RVG.\n\nIn Amazon Region, Luz et al. [60], and Guerreiro et al. [26] investigated rotavirus A, and D in wild captive, and migration birds, respectively. Accordingly, the researchers did not observe the circulation of RV and PBV after using the same primers of this study. Contrarily, Guerreiro et al. [26] designed a primer targeting the VP7 gene, and obtained 1/23 positivity for avian RVA.\n\nRegarding to PBV, all the 23 samples were tested for both GG-I, and GG-II, and one (1/23) amplified for the RdRp gene yielded an amplicon of 580 bp. This specimen came from a toucan (Ramphastus sp) from Castanhal with sign of diarrhea, and showed coinfection for RV. The sample was grouped in Genogroup I of PBV with the Chicken picobirnavirus strain, showing 97% nucleotide similarity with the reference strain MG846412, which was reported in Rio Grande do Sul in 2015 in birds [33], and 98% with KC865821 circulating in the Amazon Region in 2010 [35], as shown in Fig 7. Therefore, this is the first report of RdRp PBV gene in wild birds in Brazil circulating in toucans from the Amazon region.\n\nThe sequence of this study is represents in bold, and the black color depicts the birds. The numbers next to the nodes indicate bootstrap values > 70.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008792.g007\n\nThe absence of diarrheal symptoms resulting from PBV infections is reported in several hosts [10], which can be one of the factors interfering in the diagnosis, considering that the amount of viral particles excreted in the feces is not detectable by PAGE. Thus, due to the low viral load, no positive signal in PAGE was observed in this study, thereby suggesting that PBVs were not the primary agent for the manifestation of diarrheal conditions, since the animal presented coinfection for rotavirus.\n\nHowever, it is suggested that the diarrheic animals that were not positive for PBV could be affected by other enteric agents (viral, fungal, bacterial, protozoan or helminthic), and likely have triggered diarrheal conditions due to stress caused by physiological disorders, such as fractures, myiasis, tachycardia, tachypnea, and other injuries. For those animals positive for RV with no signs of diarrhea, we suggested that the low viral load in the samples may explain the absence of any manifested symptoms (observed in the CT’s obtained in the RT-qPCR).\n\nThe frequency of cases in Castanhal was higher than other cities, problably due to Castanhal has more avian samples to this study. However, we also can consider that Menes and Simonian [61] interviewed street market merchants from Bragança, Cametá, Capanema, Castanhal, Paragominas, Santarém and Tucuruí (city of state of Pará) regarding to clandestine commercialization of wild animals, and the data showed that Castanhal exhibited the highest commercialization of these species. Such information could corroborate with our study considering the high prevalence of RV and PBV in Castanhal, and demonstrate that this illegal activity could induce interspecies transmission, interfering in the transmission of viral agents including those pathogens between ecosystems, and their genetic diversity."
