        "text": "This article examines the challenges faced by a Portuguese technical university that is striving to develop its research base within a developing science, technology and higher education system. The paper identifies lack of resources, and also organizational factors, as particular challenges. These include faculty inbreeding, career structures and related incentives as hampering factors preventing a faster development of the university research base. These factors are strongly affected by the development of the science, technology and higher education system. It is argued that these challenges can be tackled, but greater institutional autonomy is necessary as well as an increased participation of research and development in university governing bodies. It is also recognized that the different strategies for dealing with the challenges facing universities should take into account the knowledge base of the development of schools.\n\nThe Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi (MPEG) is one of the oldest museums in Brazil that carries out basic research, and preserves important scientific collections in the areas of Biological and Human Sciences. The institution works in the formation of human resources, at the level of scientific initiation (SI) and graduate studies. In relation to the SI, there is the Institutional Program of Scientific Initiation Scholarships (PIBIC/MPEG/CNPq), which is an initiative from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and aims to train staff at the undergraduate level and introduce the student to scientific knowledge. This work aimed to carry out a retrospective research on the research and guidelines conducted in the PIBIC/MPEG/CNPq, published in the respective Abstracts published annually. The period 1997-2019 was evaluated and emphasis was given to works with themes on the Coastal Zone or the Amazonian Continental Area. The following were considered: area of knowledge of the research; sub-area of knowledge and specialty (according to the table of CNPq knowledge areas); sector of activity of the supervisor; year of activity; student, institution of graduation of the supervisor; course attended by the supervisor and; research in the continent or coastal areas. Dynamic tables and graphics were produced. The results showed that the PIBIC/MPEG/CNPq program covered 1154 undergraduate students in the areas of basic and applied sciences. A total of 1877 scientific initiation scholarships were made available, 930 and 947 with themes about the continent and the coastal region, respectively. Several of these students entered the graduate programs at their home institution, at MPEG or at programs in other states or regions of the country. The conclusion is that the PIBIC/MPEG/CNPq is an opportunity offered to young Amazonian people to start working on research, human resources training and scientific, regional and national development, thus strengthening research and, consequently, the development of Brazil.\n\nAcademic development in Portugal was until recently not a priority in universities. This situation has altered, partially motivated by the demands for high-quality teaching and learning, mainly influenced by the international and national guidelines and principles of quality assurance, and by a certain ‘pressure’ for accountability and improvement purposes of teaching and learning. This paper discusses the recent interest for academic development in Portuguese higher education institutions after the so called ‘Bologna process’, and the implications that such initiatives have for promoting teaching quality and a ‘teaching culture’ in research intensive universities. This discussion will be oriented through the view of a researcher on higher education who has been involved in academic development since 2005. Setting the scene The higher education (HE) system in Portugal comprises university and polytechnic institutions, which can be public, state-university foundations, or private. Th...\n\nThe State University of Campinas has been established in 19662[2], recently in relation to the western tradition, considering that Bologna University was established in 1088, but in the Brazilian context though, the oldest university, the São Paulo University (USP), was founded as late as 1934. Unicamp has been set up as a smaller, more specialized, research prone university, aiming at being the best one in the country in scholarly productivity3[3]. It did not take more than three decades to reach that position. Today, Unicamp has the highest per capita productivity both per lecturer or faculty and student in the country, the highest graduate course evaluation marks4[4], the highest patent marks, the highest international recognition, again considering the number of lecturers, researchers, professors and students. The Center for Advanced Studies was formally established in March 2010, even though it has been in preparation since late September, 2009. The first activity in this early period has been to gather all the living Unicamp emeriti, aiming at learning from 1[1] Head of the Center for Advanced Studies, State University of Campinas, Brazil. 2[2] Cf. http://www.gr.unicamp.br/ceav/revista/index.php"
