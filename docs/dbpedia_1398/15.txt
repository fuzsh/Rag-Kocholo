EAST STROUDSBURG â€” East Stroudsburg University travels to Bloomsburg today to take on the nationally ranked Huskies in a 1:30 p.m. start at Robert B. Redman Stadium.

Today's game will be broadcast live on WVPO 840 and 960 AM and on redzonemedia.com with Chuck Seese and Bob Brittain calling all of the action.

Bloomsburg is 8-1 and riding an eight-game winning streak and leads the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Eastern Division with a 4-0 record. ESU is 6-3 and 3-1 in the division. West Chester is 6-3 overall and 4-1 in the East. An ESU win would create a three-way tie atop the division standings with three teams with one loss.

The Huskies are No. 6 in the latest American Football Coaches Association Poll. They are also No. 2 in the regional rankings, a spot behind Shepherd. ESU is 11th. The top six regional teams earn NCAA playoff berths.

The road team has won the last six meetings between the schools. Last year, ESU won 52-39 in the second round of the NCAA playoffs and lost at home during the regular season 31-24 in overtime. The last time the home team won a game was when Bloomsburg won 28-0 in 2000.

"We have some things we will do to make the kids aware of the importance of this game," ESU coach Denny Douds said. "We still have a chance to win the PSAC and throw the whole thing into a tizzy."

Last week, Warrior quarterback Jimmy Terwilliger added another milestone to his resume, topping 15,000 yards of career total offense. The 6-0, 172-pound senior quarterback is the first player in Division II history to reach the milestone and joins Timmy Chang from Hawaii and Steve McNair of Alcorn State as the only players in college football history to top the mark. Terwilliger has thrown for 13,611 yards and rushed for 1,686. Chang, who played from 2000-04, had 16,910 while McNair, now with the Baltimore Ravens, had 16,823.

"Bloomsburg is a solid, solid football team," Douds said. "They play great defense and run the ball extremely well. Their offense is solid, they run the ball well and certainly throw it when needed. They have been tested in the competition of the season and are a very good football team."

Brahin Bilal, a junior, is the leading receiver with 33 catches for 683 yards. He averages 21 yards per catch and has seven touchdowns. Ryan Shuck has 19 catches for 234 yards and a touchdown while tight end Luke Kuklick has 12 catches for 190 yards and one touchdown.

Defensive end John Vetter has 47 tackles, 10 for losses and six sacks. Inside linebacker Dave Lotier has 46 tackles while safety Michael Wiggins leads the team with three interceptions.

Last year in the second round of the Division II playoffs, Terwilliger threw for four touchdowns and ran for another and helped ESU come back from three deficits and advance to the Northeast Regional final. Terwilliger had just 34 yards passing in the first half, but completed 13 of 16 passes in the second half for 190 yards to rally the Warriors. For the game, he completed 16 of 25 passes for 224 yards and those four touchdowns. It was the 35th straight game he had thrown a touchdown pass, extending his NCAA Division II record.

In the regular season meeting at Eiler-Martin Stadium, Brittingham ran for a 5-yard touchdown in overtime and the Bloomsburg defense forced a four-and-out on the ensuing ESU possession for a 31-24 victory.

ESU's Mark Brubaker kicked a 27-yard field goal as time expired to force overtime.

ESU racked up 525 yards of total offense while Brittingham went over the 1,000 yard mark for the season with 33 carries for 200 yards.
