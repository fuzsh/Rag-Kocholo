        "text": "Multi-talented rapper Redman, one half of duo Method Man & Redman, is expanding his repertoire. He has signed to become an in-house music video and commercials director with Benetone Films.\n\nRedman (real name Reginald ‘ Reggie’ Noble) previously expanded from performance into DJing, MCing and music production, then into acting, with movies including stoner comedy “How High” and “Seed of Chucky” and “Scary Movie 3”.\n\nBenetone is a features, commercials and video company with bases in Bangkok, Thailand and Los Angeles. It has produced music videos with Beyonce, Enrique Iglesias and Lil Wayne and commercials for brands including Yamaha, Tropicana Slice and Vespa to name a few.\n\nDetails of his directing projects remain under wraps for the moment. Redman is also currently working on music album “Muddy Waters 2.”\n\n“Redman’s genius and illustrious knack for creativity combined with our passion for production is undoubtedly going to result in an exciting, promising and fruitful future for all,” said Rachvin Narula, CEO of Benetone Films.\n\nIn April this year, Redman branched into fashion. He released a collaboration with New York-based streetwear brand Mighty Healthy, with smoke and pot related graphics.\n\nRedman, who got his start on the Def Jam label, made his professional music debut on the 1990 EPMD album “Business as Usual,” and in 1992 released his debut album “Whut? Thee Album.” He followed this up with his 1994 album “Dare Iz a Darkside” and later, “Muddy Waters.” Hit albums to follow included “El Niño,: with regular collaborators Def Squad, “Malpractice,” “Red Gone Wild” and “Reggie.”"
