        "text": "Robert Ambrose REDMAN was born on 20th November 1919 to Mr. Oliver Roberts Redman, (who was later the Superintendent of the “Deaf and Dumb Mission” Adelaide), and Mrs. Vera Redman. Bob was the eldest son of his family and very much looked up to by his brother, Alan.\n\nBob was educated at the Gillies Street and Adelaide Technical High schools, and was a fully qualified accountant and secretary. He was on the staff of the State Bank of SA, and while attached to the Waikerie branch enlisted in the RAAF early in 1941.\n\nAfter his enlistment and commencing training, Bob married a Waikerie girl, Sylvia LEHMANN on 10th October 1941. Bob and Sylvia subsequently welcomed a daughter, Patricia.\n\nHe was keenly interested in sport, and was a popular all round footballer and cricketer, having played the latter with the Adelaide B team. Before enlistment he was an active worker in the Unley Church of Christ, with which he had been associated for many years.\n\nBob was stationed at Port Pirie until early 1943 when he was transferred to Western Australia. Bob was aircrew in a Beaufort air transport, when at about 6am on 15th March 1943 the plane he was in crashed into a hill shortly after takeoff in heavy fog. All aboard (4 crew and 4 other RAAF members) were killed when the crash occurred at YELTA in WA.\n\nAll were buried on 17-3-1943 at Geraldton. No cause could be determined for the plane accident. On 27-3-43 all cricket games at Port Pirie stopped and stood in silence for 2 minutes to the memory of their fallen mate and former player.\n\nFive months after his death, his widow, Sylvia gave birth to Rosemary, their second daughter, in Quamby, Queensland.\n\nRobert REDMAN is interred in the Geraldton War Memorial Cemetery and is commemorated on the Australian War Memorial on the Roll of Honour.\n\nBob is also commemorated with a tree and plaque in the WAIKERIE War Memorial Gardens."
