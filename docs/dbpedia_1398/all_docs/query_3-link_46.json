        "text": "I've owned more boards than I could count, dating back to the 70s. The single best board was a 10' gunny longboard shaped by Redman for WRV not long before he passed. I've mentioned this board in other strings. It was magical. For me a board reaches that realm when it enables me to make waves I have no business making. On more than one occasion I can recall paddling back out and thanking it. (Didn't realize I was saying it out loud but a buddy once asked, \"Did you just thank your board?\") Really came alive on bigger days with howling offshore winds, days I now pass on but remember with absolute clarity. Never felt so much confidence in a board and never thought about it when I was surfing it, another mark of a magical board. Thought only about the wave. The board took care of itself, and me.\n\nGrowing up in SE NC this is what I hear the most about his boards and usually by guys I considered old timers at one point Seems like they took his boards everywhere and they just worked in critical surf and waves of consequence"
