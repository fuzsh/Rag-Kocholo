        "text": "By the time this issue of the MAGAZINE is received all members of '06 should have sent in their alumni fund contribution. If not please do so at once. Last year all but five of the living graduates in our class made a contribution. Here is hoping those five will send in their checks this year so the class will have a clean slate.\n\nWalt Powers, senior and junior, were guests at the Hanover Inn in March.\n\n1906 lost two of its loyal members in March. Art Libby died, on March 12 and Ned Herr on March 18. A letter of sympathy was sent to each of the wives.\n\nMeservey—\"Our daughter Ellen and her two daughters are with us this year, while her husband is working for another graduate degree in Washington. Edward is working in the New York City office of the Atomic Energy Commission and served as acting director for about six months this past year. Is working nights and holidays on his doctor's thesis at Columbia.\n\n\"Robert, whose book of photographs of the College has recently been published, is trying to establish himself as a photographer in New York.\n\n\"On March 7, Anne and I leave for California via Oak Ridge and New Orleans as I have a leave of absence this semester. So far I have spent most of the time in Hanover working on plans for the new laboratory addition, construction on which is scheduled to start this spring. I expect to get back some time in June. I am hoping to hit some of the California desert sections at the season when they belie their names by producing magnificent blooms. Naturally I shall visit various laboratories on the way. Three grandchildren.\"\n\nTerrien—No report.\n\nThrall—\"Spending our winter in California as usual trying to get back as near par as possible. Hope to get East this summer and if so will try to see you. My wife says that if it weren't for Dartmouth, I wouldn't get any mail. She is about right but it is my big interest and has paid excellent dividends for almost 50 years. Six grandchildren, five boys and one girl.\"\n\nTourtelotte—\"Enjoying retirement with carpentering, gardening, some fishing, some reading, some photography, but chiefly in being beholden to no one but my wife and family. Had a very pleasant visit with DanHatch and some of his globe-trotting familiars late last fall. Dan has a way with him that has not changed since 1906.\n\n\"I do enjoy reading your class notes in the ALUMNI MAGAZINE and I do hope to attend our next reunion in Hanover. Seven grandchildren.\"\n\nTufts—No report.\n\nTwiss—No report.\n\nWallace—\"At present in the hospital. Had a fractured disk in my spine which necessitated an operation. Will be here a while yet and probably a month at home before I am back in my office—so the winter has been rather unpleasant.\"\n\nWalsh—No report.\n\nWardwell—'\"We hope to have a fine athlete in Robert B. 3rd. Made high school hockey as a sophomore and should make football and baseball in his Junior year.\n\n\"Things with us are routine as always. Best regards to all in 1906. 11 grandchildren.\"\n\nWaring—\"Am still in my own cotton yarn and rayon business. As I own some business property and pay a little tax here to the City, the Mayor, with whom I served in the Legislature, appointed me Real Estate Agent for the City. If any of the Class is looking for a mill or land on which to build a plant come and see me. Give my best regards to the members of the class.—I Loves 'em all—Two grandchildren.\"\n\nWarner—\"Still Purchasing Agent for the L. S. Starrett Co. One grandchild.\"\n\nWarton—\"Pleased to get your little reminder.\"\n\nNew addresses: Rev. Crawford M. Bishop, Tokyo Foreign Missionaries, APO 500, c/o P. M., San Francisco, Calif.\n\nFred A. Jones, 42 Hanover St., Lebanon, N. H.\n\nHenry D. Thrall, 1942 Humboldt Ave., S. Minneapolis 5, Minn.\n\nHenry E. Cooke, Box 161, Wayne, Ill.\n\nSecretary, 37 East 39th St., New York 16, N. Y. Treasurer, 9 Pond St., New buryport, Mass. Class Agent, 208 Fuller St., Brookline, Mass."
