        "text": "Redman History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nIsrael\n\nEngland\n\nThe Strongbownian invaders added their Norman conventions for surnames to the previously established Irish system for hereditary surnames. One of the most frequent forms of surnames for both cultures was the patronymic surname, which was formed from the name of the bearer's father or grandfather. The Norman tradition that the followers of Strongbow brought with them created such a surname through diminutive suffixes such as -ot, -et, -un, -in, or -el. Occasionally, two suffixes were combined to form a double diminutive, as in the combinations of -el-in, -el-ot, -in-ot, and -et-in. The Normans also formed patronymic surnames in a manner very similar to the Irish: they added a prefix to their father's name. These Anglo-Norman people, however, used the prefix Fitz-, which was derived from the French word fils, and ultimately from the Latin filius, which both mean son. Although this prefix probably originated in Flanders or Normandy, it can now only be found in Ireland. The surname Redman is derived from the personal name Raymond, which is derived from the Old French forenames Raimund and Raimond. These are derived from the Old German personal name Raginmund, which literally means counsel-army or might-army. The Gaelic form of the surname Redman is RÃ©amonn.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Redman family\n\nThe surname Redman was first found in County Wexford (Irish: Loch Garman), founded by Vikings as Waesfjord, and located in Southeastern Ireland, in the province of Leinster. Alexander Redmond, the first of this family who bore the surname was of the same stock as the Earl of Pembroke whom he accompanied to Ireland in 1170. 1\n\nWhile generally known today as an Irish family, we must take moment to explore the branch of the family that stayed in England, specifically at Yealand-Redmayne in Lancashire. \" Anciently, Yealand-Conyers and Yealand-Redmayne appear to have formed one district. In the Testa de Neville it is stated, that 'Mathew de Redeman and Robert de Kemyers, or Cynyers, held the eighth part of a knight's fee in Yeland, of the fee of William de Lancaster, the king's tenant in chief;' hence the origin of the additions to the name. The Conyers and Redmayne families were long connected with Yealand.\" 2 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Redman family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Redman research.

Many families left their homeland for North America for the promise of work, freedom and land ownership. Although the Irish were not free of economic and racial discrimination in North America, they did contribute greatly to the rapid development of bridges, canals, roads, and railways. Eventually, they would be accepted in other areas such as commerce, education, and the arts.
