        "text": "WEST CHESTER, PA - The #23 West Chester University football team will visit #4 Bloomsburg University for the first time since 2002 this Saturday afternoon, October 29, in a game that could decide the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Eastern Division Championship and one of the top two seeds in the NCAA Division II Northeast Region.\n\nThe Golden Rams and Huskies will square off in a crucial showdown at Robert B. Redman Stadium beginning at 1:30 p.m. (EDT). WCU has not won in Bloomsburg since 1999.\n\nThe game has major NCAA Division II Playoff implications since the Huskies are presently ranked second in the Northeast Region Poll while the Golden Rams have jumped to third. The top six teams in the region earn NCAA II Playoff berths at the end of the season.\n\nWest Chester (7-2/5-0 PSAC East) is coming off a soggy 18-17 victory vs. East Stroudsburg last Saturday night, while the Huskies (9-0/4-0) defeated Mansfield 40-12 on the road last week.\n\nThe Golden Rams have won 14 straight PSAC East games and have beaten Bloomsburg the past two years - both times in West Chester, PA.\n\nRadio Broadcast\n\nWest Chester University and WCOJ 1420 AM in West Chester, PA, have renewed a long tradition of Golden Ram Football on the Voice of Chester County after a several-year hiatus...all 11 regular-season games will be heard live on WCOJ after the station and the university agreed to a three-year deal with a two-year option...Doug Stirling will handle the play-by-play, while former San Francisco 49er All-Pro Linebacker Lee Woodall will handle the commentary as Stirlings partner...the pregame show will begin at 1:10 p.m.\n\nInternet Broadcast\n\nFor the 4th straight year, all WCU football games will be broadcast live on Red Zone Media (redzonemedia.com)...fans may access the broadcast through the WCU webpage: wcupagoldenrams.com...games are simulcast with WCOJ.\n\nThis Weeks Opponent: Bloomsburg\n\n(Courtesy Bloomsburg Sports Information)\n\nMANSFIELD, PA - Tail back Jamar Brittingham (Levittown/Neshaminy) rushed for a game-high 138 yards and scored three touchdowns to lead Bloomsburg University to a 40-12 win over Mansfield University Saturday afternoon. The win improved the Huskies overall and record to 9-0 and their mark in the PSAC East to 4-0.\n\nMansfield dropped to 1-7 and 1-3.\n\nBrittingham helped Bloomsburg jump out to a 13-0 lead in the game on a four-yard scoring run in the first quarter and a one-yard plunge early in the second period.\n\nLater in the second period, the Huskies extended their lead to 20-0 when Luke Kuklick (North Wales/North Penn) caught a 34-yard scoring pass from quarterback Jack Lydic (Selinsgrove/Selinsgrove). Mansfield made it 20-6 when Rodney Davis caught a 75-yard pass from John Hengehold following the Huskies score.\n\nThen, just before halftime, Lydic connected with Donny Patrick (Shenandoah/Hazleton) on a 10-yard scoring pass to give Bloomsburg a 27-6 lead heading into the locker room.\n\nIn the third period, Brittingham scored from seven yards out to push the lead to 34-6. Later in the period, Josh Heck (Hazleton/Hazleton) scored from five-yards out for a 40-6 advantage just before Mansfield produced a 21-yard TD pass from\n\nHengehold to Poohbear McNeal.\n\nBrittingham, who came into the game as the nations leading rusher and second leading scorer, tied the school and PSAC record (held by Irv Sigler) for most rushing touchdowns in a season with 25 and set a new mark for most touchdowns in a season with 26. He also set a school and PSAC record for most points scored in a single season surpassing Siglers mark of 150 points. Lydic finished the afternoon 12 of 19 for 190 yards with two scores.\n\nDefensively, Matt Smith (York/Central York) led the Huskies with five tackles.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nBloomsburg head coach Danny Hale (West Chester 68) is in his 13th season with the Huskies...he has amassed a 104-38-1 (.731) record...he owns a career mark of 144-51-1 (.737) in over 17 seasons...this is his 18th season as a head coach...Hale coached WCU from 1984-88 and produced a 40-13 record during his tenure, including WCUs first NCAA Division II Playoff berth in 1988....Bill Zwaan is in his third year with the Golden Rams...the University of Delaware graduate (1979) owns an 80-23 (.777) career mark...he is 26-9 (.743) at WCU and ranks 9th all-time in career victories...he coached in his 100th game at Kutztown on October 1.\n\nWCU vs. Bloomsburg - The History\n\nBloomsburg is looking to rebound from a pair of tough losses at West Chester the past two seasons...the Golden Rams beat Bloomsburg 35-24 last year...in 2003, the Huskies lost 35-34 on a missed PAT...WCU has not beaten the Huskies in Bloomsburg since 1999 and has only won once in Bloomsburg since 1989...Bloomsburg has beaten WCU 8 of the past 12 meetings dating back to 1994...WCU defeated Bloomsburg in the Danny Hale Era for the first time in 1998...until that seasons 21-10 win, Hale had beaten his alma mater five straight times...the Golden Rams defeated Bloomsburg in both 1998 and 1999...the rivalry with Bloomsburg goes back to 1925 when WCU shut out the Huskies 13-0...the Golden Rams own a 43-17 margin over Bloomsburg in the all-time series...over the past 27 years the Huskies and Golden Rams have basically split their series (14-13 in favor of WCU) - a testimony to the competitiveness of the annual battle...WCU is playing at Bloomsburg for the first time since 2002.\n\nThe Last Meeting: WCU 35, Bloomsburg 24\n\nWEST CHESTER, PA - Quarterback Bob Findora completed 9 of 10 pass attempts for 177 yards and three touchdowns in the second half as West Chester beat Bloomsburg 35-24 and captured the 2004 Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Eastern Division crown on Saturday night, October 30.\n\nFindora was sterling, finishing the day 16 for 26 with 252 yards and four touchdowns. His primary target was wideout Cory DeForrest who snagged six balls for 135 yards and one touchdown.\n\nWide receivers Brandon Simmons (Philadelphia/Williamsport), Omar Harris and Matt Chambers all caught touchdown throws from Findora.\n\nTail back Osagie Osunde (Bloomsburg/Central Columbia) carried the ball 25 times for 149 yards and one score.\n\nBloomsburg was led by Jamar Brittingham who had 18 carries for 153 yards and one touchdown, and Mike Ceroli who had 18 attempts for 120 yards. Jack Lydic finished the game by completing 12 passes on 22 attempts for 133 yards and two scores.\n\nStrong safety Mike Mignogno (Glenside/Abington) led the Golden Rams with 18 tackles (16 solos and 2 assists) and one pass breakup in his first career start. His total of 18 hits tied Paul Nanni and former San Francisco 49er All-Pro Lee Woodall (twice) for the third-most tackles in a single game in school history.\n\nBloomsburg started the scoring when Brittingham scampered 11 yards at 5:26 of the first quarter to give the Huskies a 7-0 lead. The Golden Rams countered when Harris caught a three-yard fade in the left corner of the end zone just 1:16 later.\n\nBloomsburg went back up by seven in the second on Steve Burkes five-yard catch from Lydic with 8:38 left in the first half, allowing the Huskies to hold a 14-7 halftime advantage.\n\nWCU tied the game 14-14 on the first series of the second half when Chambers caught his 14-yard TD pass from Findora to cap a four-play, 46-yard drive. Bloomsburg counter-punched again by taking a 17-14 lead on Garrett Blooms 36-yard field goal with 7:54 left in the third, but WCU responded when Osunde dove for the pylon at 1:58 of the third from one-yard out. The Golden Rams held a 21-17 lead at the end of the period.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Burke caught a 39-yard touchdown throw from Lydic at 14:52 to jump Bloomsburg back on top 24-21. But the Golden Rams reclaimed the lead for good when Simmons snared a three-yard fade from Findora in the same spot that Harris caught his in the first half. The score came at 11:30 and pushed the Golden Rams ahead by four at 28-24.\n\nBloomsburg failed to score on its next series and the Golden Rams delivered the knockout blow when a pass intended for tight end Joe Bernatowicz went through his hands and into the outstretched arms of DeForrest at 4:52 of the fourth. The 26-yard ricochet touchdown throw from Findora to Bernatowicz to DeForrest put the Golden Rams up 35-24.\n\nThe play was reminiscent of a similar occurrence in 2002 vs. Shippensburg when a Findora pass went off the hands of tight end Ryan Koch and into DeForrests for a touchdown.\n\nSimmons finished the game with four grabs for 39 yards, while Chambers had three catches for 44 yards and a 16-yard tackle for loss on a botched Bloomsburg field goal attempt. Harris contributed two receptions for 32 yards and his score.\n\nOsunde produced 219 all-purpose yards after taking 68 in returns and two on a pass reception. Findora posted 278 yards of total offense after also rushing for 26 yards on four plays.\n\nChad Weaver registered the lone sack of the game on a blitz. He took down the Bloomsburg quarterback for an eight-yard loss and finished the game with three solo tackles. Scott Dudley accumulated five tackles, an assist and a four-yard tackle for loss, while Isaiah Harrison turned in five tackles, one assist and a pass breakup.\n\nThe Last Time Out: WCU 18, ESU 17\n\nWEST CHESTER, PA - West Chester University overcame horrendous weather conditions in upending #6 East Stroudsburg University 18-17 last Saturday night in West Chester, PA.\n\nThe victory improved West Chester to 7-2 on the season and 5-0 in the Eastern Division of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference. ESU falls to 6-2 and 2-2 in the division.\n\nThe win also sets up this weeks contest vs. Bloomsburg as a showdown for the PSAC East crown since both teams are unbeaten in divisional play.\n\nThe game is the final divisional game for West Chester, while Bloomsburg concludes its divisional slate the following week against Millersville.\n\nThe one-point victory for the Golden Rams marked the third straight time WCU and ESU decided a regular-season game by the slimmest of margins. West Chester has now beaten East Stroudsburg three consecutive times in one calendar year and has won 14 straight PSAC East games.\n\nESU entered the contest as the #2 team in the NCAA II Northeast Region poll, while the Golden Rams stood sixth. The top six teams in the region will gain playoff berths in the 2005 NCAA Division II National Championships.\n\nThe Golden Rams and Warriors combined to fumble the ball 15 times in torrential rain and quicksand mud as both offenses were scuttled for much of the second half.\n\nWCU backup quarterback Bill Zwaan, Jr., (Malvern/Great Valley) entered the game late in the first half and completed four passes for 69 yards and two scores just before the break. He hit red-shirt freshman Michael Washington (Philadelphia/Frankford) for a 36-yard scoring strike with :49 left in the second quarter, then found senior WR Brandon Simmons (Philadelphia/Williamsport) on a five-yard lob in the corner with :22 remaining in the half.\n\nThe second touchdown was set up by junior DB Angel Santanas (Lancaster/McCaskey) 37-yard interception returned to the ESU 25-yard line after the Warriors tried to counter Washingtons score.\n\nZwaan finished the game 4 for 8 but was 3 for 3 prior to the half with two touchdowns. Dating back to last weeks game against Mansfield, Zwaan had put together a 9-for-10 completion streak that featured seven touchdown throws.\n\nJunior TB Brent Steinmetz\n\n(Pottstown/Pottsgrove) carried the ball 15 times for 102 yards, giving him his fourth straight 100-yard game.\n\nHe also had a reception for 13 yards, two kick returns for 48 and an 18-yard punt return to finish with a quiet 181 all-purpose yards. He also recovered a fumble by Zwaan in the second half and was one of the few offensive players not to lose his grip on the ball.\n\nESU quarterback Jim Terwilliger completed his night 21 of 31 for 223 yards and two scores. He was sacked three times and threw one interception after also being victimized by the sloppy conditions.\n\nTerwilliger hit Evan Prall with a two-yard touchdown pass with 5:15 left in the third quarter to narrow the WCU lead down to four at 18-14, then Mark Brubaker booted a 22-yard field goal early in the fourth to slice the lead to one. But neither team scored after that.\n\nPrall finished the game with six catches for 65 yards and one score, while Tim Strenfel snared six balls for 62 yards.\n\nThe Golden Rams took an early 6-0 lead when junior QB Matt Burdalski (Marlton, NJ/Holy Cross) hit Washington with a 25-yard touchdown throw, but the WCU starting quarterback was injured late in the first half and did not return. He finished 3 of 13 for 57 yards.\n\nEast Stroudsburg University countered with a three-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Carfagno in the second quarter to take a 7-6 lead. Carfagno finished with five catches for 38 yards.\n\nDefensively, the Golden Rams commandeered four fumble recoveries and picked off a pass, while ESU forced two turnovers on a fumble and a pick.\n\nSophomore OLB Jimmy Lewis (Wilmington, DE/Concord) had nine total tackles, three forced fumbles and a one-yard tackle for loss. Senior OLB Randy Reinert (Boyertown/Boyertown) posted eight total tackles, one sack (-1 yard), a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.\n\nSenior ILB Dan Faubel (Hawley/Wallenpaupack), red-shirt freshman DB James Etheridge (Pottstown/Pottstown) and Santana each had a recovered fumble. Santana was also credited with four total tackles (3 solo, 1 assist) and two pass breakups that earned him the PSAC East Defensive Player of the Week award.\n\nJunior DT Shawn Bealla (Plymouth/Wyoming Valley West) posted a pair of sacks for -7 yards.\n\nThe Warriors were led on defense by Greg Thoman who had eight tackles and one sack (-9 yards), and Fred Rice who had eight tackles, including two for losses of three yards. Matt Crispell had an interception that killed a WCU drive.\n\nRamblings\n\nThe Golden Rams reached the 500-victory plateau all-time vs. New Haven to begin the 2003 campaign...WCU is 524-242-18 (.680) in its history dating back to 1920.\n\nWCU is now the second-winningest Division II program in the nation (.684) behind Texas A&M - Kingsville...the Golden Rams own an NCAA-recognized record of 494-224-17 (since 1927 when WCU became a four-year institution)...including this season, the Golden Rams will now have finished first or second in the PSAC East in 32 of the 40 years they have competed in the league...the Golden Rams own or have shared 18 PSAC East titles...senior WR Brandon Simmons (Philadelphia/Williamsport) and senior DE Jared Souders (Allentown/Parkland) are serving as the team captains in 2005....WCU was picked to finish second in the PSAC East in the leagues preseason poll voted on by the head coaches...the Golden Rams have won 14 consecutive PSAC East contests.\n\nThe NCAA II Northeast Region Poll\n\nThe Golden Rams are ranked 3rd in this weeks NCAA Division II Northeast Region poll...WCU jumped back into the AFCA National Division II Poll at #23...the D2football.com poll lists the Golden Rams at #19...Bloomsburg is ranked 4th in the AFCA Division II National Poll but dropped to 2nd in the Northeast Region Poll...the AFCA Division II Poll is for publicity and has no impact on the regional polls for playoffs.\n\n1.
