        "text": "Clifford Smith (born March 2, 1971), better known by his stage name Method Man, is an American rapper, producer, and actor. He is known as a member of the East Coast hip hop collective Wu-Tang Clan. He is also one half of the hip hop duo Method Man & Redman. He took his stage name from the 1979 film Method Man.\n\nIn 1996, Meth won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, for \"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\", featuring American R&B singer Mary J. Blige.\n\nChildhood[]\n\nBorn on March 2, in Hempstead, Long Island, Smith divided his childhood between his father's Long Islandresidence and his mother's home in the Park Hill section of Staten Island (colloquially known as Killa Hill). He has two sisters, Terri and Missy.\n\nEarly career[]\n\n1992[]\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format December 14 Wu-Tang Clan Protect Ya Neck - Song\n\n1993[]\n\nAs Wu-Tang Clan ascended to hip hop stardom, Method Man was always one of the most visible members of the collective. He was one of only two members to get a solo song on the group's debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) and he was the first to release a solo album under the Clan's unusual contract which allowed its members to release albums under any record label. Method Man chose to sign with rap label Def Jam Recordings, although Elektra Records A&R man Dante Ross initially wanted to sign him around the same time Ross signed fellow group member Ol' Dirty Bastard.\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format August 3 Wu-Tang Clan M.E.T.H.O.D.

II\n\n1994[]\n\nMethod Man's solo debut, Tical (1994), was critically acclaimed and well received, entering the American charts at #4 and eventually selling in excess of one million copies. That album featured the hit single \"All I Need\", later remixed featuring Mary J. Blige, which won a Grammy (\"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need\"). During this time Method Man also became close friends with fellow New York City-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G., and was the only guest rapper featured on his debut album Ready to Die. He was also featured on Spice 1's album AmeriKKKa's Nightmare on the track \"Hard 2 Kill\".\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format September 13 Notorious B.I.G. The What Ready to Die Guest feature November 8 RZA, Shaquille O'Neal No Hook Shaq-Fu: Da Return November 15 - Tical Album\n\n1995[]\n\nIn 1995, he was also featured on \"Got the Flava\" off Showbiz and A.G.'s album Goodfellas.\n\nMethod Man appeared in the 1995 documentary entitled The Show. There is a memorable scene in which Method Man, on a train in Japan, gets into an argument with U-God and Ghostface Killah, over camera time, radio interviews, and clothing mishaps.\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format March 28 Ol' Dirty Bastard, Raekwon Raw Hide Return to the 36 Chambers (The Dirty Version) Guest feature May 30 Showbiz & A.G.

Jackson. In 1996, Method Man appeared on Tupac Shakur's album All Eyez on Me, on the song \"Got My Mind Made Up\" alongside his rhyme partner Redman, the Dogg Pound (Daz and Kurupt) and Inspectah Deck, whose verse did not make the released album version (although his nickname \"Rebel INS\" can be heard as the song fades).\n\nHe was also featured on Redman's 1996 album Muddy Waters on the track \"Do What Ya Feel\".\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format February 13 Tupac Shakur Got My Mind Made Up All Eyez On Me Guest feature October 29 Ghostface Killah, Raekwon Box in Hand Ironman November 19 Mobb Deep Extortion Hell On Earth Foxy Brown Ill Na Na Ill Na Na December 10 Redman Do What Ya Feel Muddy Waters\n\n1997[]\n\nOn June 3, 1997, the Wu-Tang Clan released their Grammy-nominated multiplatinum double CD Wu-Tang Forever, the long-awaited follow up to 36 Chambers. The album has sold over 8.3 million copies to date worldwide.\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format February 11 Wu-Tang Clan Triumph Wu-Tang Forever Album June 3 Reunited Cash Still Rules / Scary Hours Visionz As High As Wu-Tang Get A Better Tomorrow Little Ghetto Boys Deadly Melody The Projects Bells of War Dog Shit Duck Seazon Hellz Wind Staff July 30 Kevin Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson One Eight Seven Film August 15 James Mangold, Sylvester Stallone Cop Land Film October 14 LL Cool J 4,3,2,1 Phenomenon Guest feature\n\n1998[]\n\nHis second solo album was Tical 2000: Judgement Day, released in 1998, which was heavily influenced by the apocalypse theories surrounding the forthcoming end of the millennium, and which featured myriad guest appearances from his fellow Wu-Tang MCs. The album was certified double platinum. Other guest appearances include Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, D'Angelo, Chris Rock, Mobb Deep, Redman, and brief cameos from Russell Simmons, Bishop Don \"Magic\" Juan, Janet Jackson, and Donald Trump. The album sold better than his first fueled by the party track \"Judgment Day\" and the D'Angelo collaboration \"Break Ups 2 Make Ups\", earning Platinum and Gold certifications in the U.S. and Canada respectively. Reviews for the album were mixed and its long runtime and abundance of intermittent comedy skits were widely criticized. Producers on this album included True Master, 4th Disciple and the RZA.\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format April 21 - Bulworth (They Talk About It While We Live It) Song August 11 The Harlem Hoodz, Inspectah Deck, Killa Sin, Raekwon Wu-Tang Cream Team Line-Up Guest feature August 25 Xzibit Pussy Pop Jayo Felony Whatcha Gonna Do October 27 Dru Hill This Is What We Do November 3 Nas, DMX, Ja Rule Grand Finale November 4 Hype Williams, Nas, DMX Belly Film November 10 Pete Rock Half Man Half Amazin' Song November 17 - Tical 2000: Judgement Day Album December 8 Redman Well All Rite Cha Doc's Da Name 2000 Guest feature\n\n1999[]\n\nHe became engaged to his wife Tamika Smith.\n\nMethod Man was part of the very successful Hard Knock Life Tour with Jay-Z, Redman, Ja Rule, and DMX. During this tour, Method Man & Redman recorded Blackout!, a light-hearted, bass-heavy, profanity-laced, party record with an EPMD-evoking emphasis on funky beats and the mischievous wit and cool flows and good rhythm of the two MCs. The album reached platinum status quickly, both in the U.S. and Canada, fueled by \"Da Rockwilder\", \"Cereal Killa\", \"1, 2, 1, 2\", \"Tear It Off\" and \"Y.O.U.\" This album also featured three previously released tracks on which the two collaborated.\n\nTheir success would lead the duo on to star in movies and TV shows, become product spokespersons and household names, but also associated them with marijuana use in the media. The most immediate results of their success was their co-starring roles in the major motion picture film How High, their endorsement deal for Right Guard, Redman's starring role in Seed of Chucky and a short-lived sitcom on Fox Television entitled Method & Red.\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format June 22 Limp Bizkit, DJ Premier N2Gether Now Significant Other Guest feature June 25 Dennis Dugan, Adam Sandler Big Daddy Film July 20 EPMD Symphony 2000 Out of Business Guest feature September 4 James Toback, Robert Downey Jr. Black and White Film September 28 Redman Blackout!

The W received both critical and commercial success for the group, while Iron Flag did receive some but not to the effect of The W. The efforts earned two more platinum plaques for the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nDate Worked with Collaboration Project Format January 25 D'Angelo Left and Right Voodoo Guest feature June 27 Kelly Price Like You Do July 4 Sheek Louch, Redman 2 Tears in a Bucket Ryde or Die Vol. 2 July 18 Channel Live Ghetto B.I.

He took something major from me that he had no intention of giving back.\"\n\nIn January, Meth appeared as a fortune teller named Kamayo in the 2002 television series The Twilight Zone.\n\nDate Worked with Project Format January 8 Jerry Levine, James Crocker The Twilight Zone TV series April 1 AKI Corporation, EA Canada Def Jam Vendetta Videogame June 29 Steve Shill (Episode 5) The Wire (Season 2) TV series August 10 Rob Bailey (Episode 10) August 26 Mary J.

However, after only a short time on the air, the show was put on hiatus and never returned. Method Man later spoke to the press about Fox's influence on the show's style, saying that \"there's been too much compromise on our side and not enough on their side\" and criticising the network's decision to add a laugh track. Before the show even aired for the first time, he was telling fans not to bother watching it. He told the Los Angeles Times:\n\nIn 2004, Meth released his third solo album Tical 0: The Prequel, which featured the hit party single \"What's Happenin'\" with Busta Rhymes. Hip hop critics voiced their displeasure with the album, many agreeing that Tical 0 felt like generic party rap and featured too many mainstream guests, detracting from his own performances. Regardless, this album sold reasonably well and was certified gold record by the RIAA relatively quickly, but would not see the platinum success of his previous solo releases. There was trouble even before the album's release when Method apparently complained to the press about excessive interference from Def Jam over the album's beats (Meth supposedly desired more input from Wu-Tang leader RZA). On its release, many fans and critics were taken aback by its strong \"mainstream\" or \"commercial\" sound, highlighted by the guest appearances of pop-rap stars like Missy Elliott and P.

He also brought up the fact that he was the only other rapper that Biggie chose to have on his debut album Ready to Die. He was featured on the track \"The What\".\n\nPreviously, Diddy had been one of the executive producers for Method Man's 2004 album Tical 0: The Prequel, to which Meth later voiced his displeasure on the final product. From then on, he focused on production from within the Clan and its closely tied collaborators.\n\nin 2006, Method Man had a personal and publicized conflict with TV talk show host Wendy Williams on The Breakdown, an internet show on Onloq.com. Williams talked on air about Method Man's wife having cancer, which was something he wanted to keep private and her own family members had not yet known about. He said that people who lived next door to him did not know, but Williams had dug it up and made it public over the radio. Because of this leaked information, Method Man and his wife had many problems.\n\nWendy Williams also reported rumors that Method Man had even been having an affair with his wife's doctor. Method Man first heard of this while in recording sessions in Los Angeles.\n\nAside from the financial issues, Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu-Tang into the fashion world for a brief period of time with Wu-Wear, despite the brand being a major money-maker for the group. \"When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit.\"\n\nIn 2006, Method Man appeared on the MTV reality game show Yo Momma in the first episode of Season 1.\n\nP. Diddy was one of the executive producers for the album, although Meth later voiced his displeasure with the final product. \"On the third LP, it was suggested (by Def Jam) to bring in Harve Pierre and P. Diddy. Who am I to argue? Puff knows how to sell some records. But that wasn't the direction to go in, and I know that.\"\n\nMethod Man's fourth album, entitled 4:21: The Day After was released in August 2006 with a star lineup of producers featuring Havoc, Erick Sermon, Scott Storch, Allah Mathematics, Mr. Porter, and, most importantly to Meth, RZA. This time around, a more focused Method Man went back to his hip hop roots and both hip hop fans and the media took notice. He did an interview on the ItsHipHop.Tv. Despite this being one of Meth's strongest solo efforts to date, the album failed to do well commercially due to it having no single or video, which Method Man has held discontent towards his own label for. However, he toured strongly all over the world to promote the album, and appeared onstage with fellow Wu-Tang member Inspectah Deck, as well as New York up and comers Saigon, and Gat Murdah. Meth contributed various reasons for the problems between him and his label, Def Jam. While he puts most of the blame on personal agendas in the Def Jam offices, Meth did take some blame, himself, for giving into his record label.\n\nDate Worked with Project Format April 13 Bryan Spicer (Episode 20) CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (Season 6) TV series June 27 Stacy Title, Snoop Dogg Hood of Horror Film August 29 - Def Jam: Fight for NY - The Takeover Videogame - 4:21...The Day After Album November 26 Brad Anderson (Episode 11) The Wire (Season 4) TV series December 3 Joe Chapelle (Episode 12) December 10 Ernest Dickerson (Episode 13)\n\n2007[]\n\nIn early May 2007, Method Man's camp leaked the street single \"New York New York\" which became a popular track on the internet.\n\nOn March 27, 2007, Redman confirmed on BET's Rap City: Tha Bassment that a sequel to How High is currently being written.\n\nIn an April 10, 2007 Onion A.V.
