Several rapes and assaults were reported on campus and in off-campus apartments. Michael Boykin, husband of the BU police chief, was arrested for allegedly raping a female co-worker. Several racial issues also disrupted campus: two university employees received letters from the Ku Klux Klan; a white male confronted a black female student with racial slurs; a small wooden cross was burned on the steps of Carver Hall; and a university trustee who is black publicly accused the University of racism in the handling of the Michael Boykin case in which both Boykin and the alleged victim were black. In response to the incidents, the University implemented several safety programs including adding emergency call boxes, additional lighting on campus, and a shuttle bus service between the upper and lower campuses.\n\nDepartment of Public Instruction, 1965-67\n\nDepartment of Public Relations - Monthly Reports from Boyd Buckingham, Director, 1969-72\n\nEducation Related Writings, 1935-57\n\nEggers, Edwin, Graduate Student, 1983\n\nBox 2:\n\nFaculty\n\nBarbara Behr, 1985\n\nWendy Lou Elcesser, 1985\n\nAndrew Emerson, 1984\n\nDonald Enders, 1968-76\n\nErnest Englehardt, 1970-75\n\nGovernor's School for the Arts, 1989\n\nG.S.A.

Members of the Theta Chi fraternity threw a fundraising party for the Women's Center. The fundraiser turned into a \"block party\" at the Sesame Street housing complex with students drinking heavily and sliding through the mud. Michael Boykin, a grounds worker and husband of the new BU police chief, was accused of raping a co-worker. He was acquitted, but launched lawsuits on a dozen agencies and individuals claiming that his case was handled with a racial bias. That year, Bloomsburg was terrorized by a serial rapist who was also black. DNA evidence linked Jimmy Lee Lindsey to three Bloomsburg rapes. These folders contain clippings of several other stories of racial tensions, other prejudices, and the steps that the University and community took to promote diversity. George Mitchell was unfairly dismissed from his job as the affirmative action director after allegedly sexually harassing a foreign exchange student. He was rehired and given another position, but sued the university in an attempt to get his old job back. Professors TejBahn Saini, Ronald Champoux, Salim Qureshi, and Mary Ericksen were involved in other lawsuits.\n\nLearning and Research Center, 1970-71\n\nLegislation, 1954-56, 1983\n\nMaintenance and Development Projects, 1985-86\n\nMiddle States Evaluation, 1968-69\n\nMiddle States Evaluation Team, 1968\n\nMorning Press, 1960-63\n\nPennsylvania State Education Association, 1958-67\n\nPosition Reports, 1969-74\n\nPresidents\n\nFrancis B.
