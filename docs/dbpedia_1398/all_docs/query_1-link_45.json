        "text": "Bucknell Results\n\nBloomsburg Results\n\nLEWISBURG, Pa.; BLOOMSBURG, Pa. -- The Susquehanna University men's track & field team competed at both Bucknell University's Bison Outdoor Classic and Bloomsburg University's Husky Open at Christy Mathewson-Memorial Stadium and Robert B. Redman Stadium, respectively, from Friday-Saturday, April 9-10. There was no team scoring at either meet.\n\nSenior Paul Thistle (Blue Bell, Pa./Wissahickon) led Susquehanna at the cold and windy Bucknell meet with a time of 14 minutes, 47.98 seconds in the prestigious invitational section of the 5,000-meter run, good for 21st place out of 32 athletes. Thistle bested five NCAA Division I competitors, one Division II runner and an unattached athlete.\n\nHe breaks the Susquehanna and Landmark Conference records with that time and provisionally qualifies for the 2010 Division III outdoor championships in the event. SU Sports Hall of Famer Greg Pealer '85 held the old school record with a hand-timed 14:59.6 from back in 1984.\n\nSusquehanna enjoyed a bevy of first-place finishes at the Bloomsburg meet, including one each from sophomores Joe Zamadics (West Chester, Pa./West Chester East), Ross Koehler (Park Ridge, N.J./Park Ridge) and Robby Caulfield (Setauket, N.Y./Ward Melville), junior Bobby Eppleman (Chester Springs, Pa./Great Valley) and senior Steve Drosdick (Verona, N.J./Verona).\n\nZamadics beat 26 multi-divisional athletes in the 800 with a time of 1:58.32. Koehler beat seven athletes in a similar field in the 400 hurdles with a time of 58.31 seconds. Caulfield topped 18 multi-divisional athletes in the 1,500 with a 4:18.55 time. Eppleman tied a Division II competitor and beat three others in the pole vault by clearing 4.30 meters (14 feet, 1 1/4 inches). Drosdick was first of three athletes in the 110 hurdles with a time of 16.30 seconds.\n\nSusquehanna's freshman Ken Schetroma (Elysburg, Pa./Southern Columbia Area) placed second out of 11 multi-divisional athletes in the shot put with a distance of 13.24 meters (43 feet, 5 1/4 inches), while teammate and sophomore Ian Quinlan (Eagle View, Pa./Methacton) finished second in the 3,000 steeplechase out of six similar athletes with a 10:09.55 time.\n\nThe Crusaders' 1,600 relay team also placed second. Sophomores Daniel Sodroski (Jamison, Pa./Central Bucks East), Chance King (Newburgh, N.Y./Newburgh Free Academy) and Mike Kelso (Bernardsville, N.J./Bernards) and Drosdick made up that relay (in order) and recorded a 3:27.79 time to best two other teams.\n\nNext Meet: Thursday-Friday, April 15-16, at Mondschein Multi (Kutztown), 3 p.m."
