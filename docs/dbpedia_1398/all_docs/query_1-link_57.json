        "text": "Laura Rayle\n\nFootball 8/30/2008 6:25:58 PM\n\nNo. 5 Vulcans win season-opener, 44-32\n\n• Game Notes (.pdf)\n\n• Box Score\n\nCALIFORNIA (Aug. 30) – In their season-opener at Adamson Stadium on Saturday, the No. 5 Vulcans featured an explosive offense that was led by quarterback Kevin McCabe (Gibsonia, Pa./Pine-Richland/Virginia) and receiver Marcel Pestano (Lehigh Acres Fla./Lehigh/Pittsburgh) en route to a 44-32 victory over No. 16 West Chester University.\n\nThe win extends the Vulcans' regular-season win streak to 12 games and the program has now won 20 of its last 22 overall games dating back to the 2006 season.\n\nMcCabe, a transfer from Virginia, completed 30-of-36 attempts (83.3 percent) for 297 yards with two touchdowns – both to Pestano, a transfer from Pittsburgh. The 30 completions by McCabe is the highest single-game total in recent program history (since 2002).\n\nIn his first game as a Vulcan, Pestano posted game-high totals of 11 receptions and 112 receiving yards. The 11 catches rank second as the highest single-game total in team history behind only the 13 recorded by Pete Gialames in 1968.\n\nCal amassed a total of 517 yards of total offense against West Chester, including 220 yards on the ground. Senior running back Daine Williams (Beaver Falls, Pa./Beaver Falls/Howard) led all players with 102 yards on 17 carries with two touchdowns, while classmate Brandon Lombardy (Moureland Hills, Ohio/Chagrin Falls/Purdue) finished with 93 yards on 17 attempts and one touchdown.\n\nWith the Golden Rams leading 19-16 at halftime, the Vulcans seized control of the contest in the second half by scoring 21-straight points in the third quarter with three touchdowns. Cal engineered an eight-play drive on the opening possession in the second half, capped by a five-yard touchdown plunge by Williams with 11:26 left in the quarter that gave the Vulcans a 23-19 lead.\n\nOn the next Cal U possession, Williams increased the lead to 30-19 before sophomore running back Windell Brown (Duquesne, Pa./Duquesne) added a 19-yard scoring scamper with 32 seconds left in the third quarter to make the score 37-19.\n\nThe Golden Rams, who were predicted to win the PSAC East in the pre-season conference poll, trimmed the deficit to 37-25 with a touchdown early in the fourth quarter, however, the Vulcans sealed the victory with a seven-yard score by Lombardy with 8:13 left in the game to increase the lead to 44-25.\n\nThe Vulcans defense limited pre-season All-American wide receiver Mike Washington to only 65 yards and five receptions after he entered the game averaging almost 100 receiving yards per game in 37 career contests.\n\nSenior defensive back Juan Butler (McKeesport, Pa./McKeesport) paced the Cal defensive unit with seven tackles (six solo) and a fumble recovery. Linebackers Guy Hurt (McKeesport, Pa./McKeesport/Kent State) and Jake Howell (Pittsburgh, Pa./Brashear) each added five stops.\n\nThe Cal U defense held the Golden Rams to only 71 rushing yards and forced three turnovers, including interceptions by sophomore Patrick Swearinger (Waldorf, Md./Thomas Stone) and junior Terrence Johnson (Pittsburgh, Pa./Woodland Hills).\n\nBehind an efficient passing game and a consistent running game, the Vulcans featured almost a plus-15 minute advantage in time of possession and converted all seven of their red-zone opportunities.\n\nThe Vulcans return to action on Saturday, Sept. 6, at Robert B. Redman Stadium against No. 25 Bloomsburg University. Last season, Cal U posted a 31-13 win against the Huskies at Adamson Stadium."
