        "text": "EAST STROUDSBURG — East Stroudsburg University travels to Bloomsburg today to take on the nationally ranked Huskies in a 1:30 p.m. start at Robert B. Redman Stadium.\n\nToday's game will be broadcast live on WVPO 840 and 960 AM and on redzonemedia.com with Chuck Seese and Bob Brittain calling all of the action.\n\nBloomsburg is 8-1 and riding an eight-game winning streak and leads the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference Eastern Division with a 4-0 record. ESU is 6-3 and 3-1 in the division. West Chester is 6-3 overall and 4-1 in the East. An ESU win would create a three-way tie atop the division standings with three teams with one loss.\n\nThe Huskies are No. 6 in the latest American Football Coaches Association Poll. They are also No. 2 in the regional rankings, a spot behind Shepherd. ESU is 11th. The top six regional teams earn NCAA playoff berths.\n\nThe road team has won the last six meetings between the schools. Last year, ESU won 52-39 in the second round of the NCAA playoffs and lost at home during the regular season 31-24 in overtime. The last time the home team won a game was when Bloomsburg won 28-0 in 2000.\n\n\"We have some things we will do to make the kids aware of the importance of this game,\" ESU coach Denny Douds said. \"We still have a chance to win the PSAC and throw the whole thing into a tizzy.\"\n\nLast week, Warrior quarterback Jimmy Terwilliger added another milestone to his resume, topping 15,000 yards of career total offense. The 6-0, 172-pound senior quarterback is the first player in Division II history to reach the milestone and joins Timmy Chang from Hawaii and Steve McNair of Alcorn State as the only players in college football history to top the mark. Terwilliger has thrown for 13,611 yards and rushed for 1,686. Chang, who played from 2000-04, had 16,910 while McNair, now with the Baltimore Ravens, had 16,823.\n\nThe Warriors are averaging 32.4 points per game and 396 yards of total offense per game.\n\nTerwilliger has completed 169 of 271 passes for 2,227 yards and 22 scores and also rushed 94 times for 476 yards and a pair of touchdowns.\n\nTailback Matt Brunetti has rushed 91 times for 429 yards and six touchdowns while Joe Partridge has 201 yards on 38 carries.\n\nWide receiver Evan Prall, who has returned two punts for touchdowns and rushed for another, is the leading receiver with 951 yards on 60 catches. He has 11 receiving touchdowns. Doug Ogden has 29 catches for 353 yards and five touchdowns while Wes Lindsay has 20 catches and four touchdowns.\n\nDefensively, the Huskies play a 4-3 and have allowed 15 points per game. Linebacker Matt Smith is the leading tackler with 52 stops with six for losses. Rob Biernat is second with 50 tackles. Defensive end Zac Barton leads the team with 3 1/2 sacks while Steve Draper also has six tackles for losses. Safety Tyler Trettin leads the team with three interceptions.\n\nThe Huskies counter with a balanced offense as well that is averaging 27.1 points per game and 371 yards of total offense.\n\nTailback Jamar Brittingham, who was one of three finalists for the Harlon Hill trophy as the Division II player of the year in 2005, has played sparingly in the past three weeks. He is the team's leading rusher with 608 yards on 128 carries. He has scored 10 times and is averaging 101 yards in the six games he has played.\n\nChristian Allen has 83 carries for 445 yards and seven touchdowns while Josh Heck has 80 carries for 442 yards and one touchdown.\n\nFreshman quarterback Dan Latorre has been impressive in his first season. He has completed 97 of 158 passes for 1,513 yards and 10 touchdowns. He has thrown seven interceptions and is averaging 168 yards per game.\n\n\"Bloomsburg is a solid, solid football team,\" Douds said. \"They play great defense and run the ball extremely well. Their offense is solid, they run the ball well and certainly throw it when needed. They have been tested in the competition of the season and are a very good football team.\"\n\nBrahin Bilal, a junior, is the leading receiver with 33 catches for 683 yards. He averages 21 yards per catch and has seven touchdowns. Ryan Shuck has 19 catches for 234 yards and a touchdown while tight end Luke Kuklick has 12 catches for 190 yards and one touchdown.\n\nThe ESU defense is allowing 19 points per game and has five players with more than 40 tackles. Inside linebacker Jayson Frank leads the team with 69 tackles while defensive end Greg Thomas has 57 tackles with 11 for losses and 6 1/2 sacks. Defensive end John Vetter has 47 tackles, 10 for losses and six sacks. Inside linebacker Dave Lotier has 46 tackles while safety Michael Wiggins leads the team with three interceptions.\n\nLast year in the second round of the Division II playoffs, Terwilliger threw for four touchdowns and ran for another and helped ESU come back from three deficits and advance to the Northeast Regional final. Terwilliger had just 34 yards passing in the first half, but completed 13 of 16 passes in the second half for 190 yards to rally the Warriors. For the game, he completed 16 of 25 passes for 224 yards and those four touchdowns. It was the 35th straight game he had thrown a touchdown pass, extending his NCAA Division II record.\n\nIn the regular season meeting at Eiler-Martin Stadium, Brittingham ran for a 5-yard touchdown in overtime and the Bloomsburg defense forced a four-and-out on the ensuing ESU possession for a 31-24 victory.\n\nESU's Mark Brubaker kicked a 27-yard field goal as time expired to force overtime.\n\nESU racked up 525 yards of total offense while Brittingham went over the 1,000 yard mark for the season with 33 carries for 200 yards."
