        "text": "It will be a college football game of firsts at Lebanon Valley College this week.\n\nThe Flying Dutchmen will play their first game on the school’s new FieldTurf at Arnold Field in Annville against a school in its first year of football playing its first Middle Atlantic Conference contest.\n\nLVC notched its first win with a 31-21 victory over Montclair State last weekend. Quarterback Leo Kyte went 8-for-20 for 118 yards while free safety Josh Borreli returned an interception 30 yards for a score. Borreli was voted MAC defensive player of the week.\n\nRunning back Pete Panichi ran for 137 yards on 26 carries for LVC.\n\nNot unexpectedly, the Cougars of Misericordia didn't fare as well, losing 70-0 to Gettysburg in its first game. QB Jeffrey Puckett went 13-for-21 for 113 yards and the Cougars were plus-1 in turnovers and had the ball for nearly 37 minutes.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference, Shippensburg will be home for the second straight week and will face Slippery Rock (1-0). The Red Raiders haven’t played the Rockets since 2007 and The Rock leads the series 39-20-2.\n\nShip is on a five-game winning streak, four to end last season and its 38-28 victory over Shepherd last week in which it scored 24 unanswered points.\n\nJunior QB Zach Zulli threw for a career-high 392 yards — the third-highest single-game total in SU history — and completed 26 of 35 passes with four touchdowns.\n\nSlippery Rock manhandled Seton Hill 52-6 last Thursday in its season-opener.\n\nGame time at Seth Grove Stadium is 1 p.m.\n\nMillersville also enjoyed a successful start to its season with a 41-17 romp over West Virginia Wesleyan last week and will entertain Mercyhurst at 1 p.m. Saturday.\n\nMercyhurst scored 42 points against Notre Dame College of Ohio last week but yielded 59 points.\n\nMillersville quarterback Ted Stachitas ran for 120 yards and threw for 166 and two touchdowns while running back Myron Myles rang up 93 yards on 18 tries against West Virginia Wesleyan.\n\nBishop McDevitt grad Mike Jones scored three times for the Marauders with two rushing touchdowns and one from Stachitas. Millersville actually trailed 10-7 late in the first half before its offense sprung to life.\n\nA win against Mercyhurst would give the Marauders their first 2-0 start since the 2005 season.\n\nBloomsburg also got out of the gate with a victory by topping Stonehill 44-28; the Huskies are ranked 19th in Division II and will host Edinboro at 1 p.m. Saturday.\n\nCoach Danny Hale will be honored at the game as the field at the school’s Robert B. Redman Stadium will be known as Danny Hale Field. Hale, a former Hershey resident, is the program’s leader in coaching victories with 164; he is 203-67-1 in his 25 years of coaching.\n\nHale has had at least one 40-point game in each of his 20 seasons as Bloomsburg’s head coach, and the Huskies have scored at least 14 points in 25 consecutive games.\n\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Tim Kelly of Cedar Cliff went 16-for-26 against Stonehill for 197 yards.\n\nOther games this weekend include:"
