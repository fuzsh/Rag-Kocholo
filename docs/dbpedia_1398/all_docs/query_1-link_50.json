        "text": "Courtesy of Millersville Sports Info\n\nMILLERSVILLE, Pa. --- Millersville University Director of Athletics Miles Gallagher has named Eric Usbeck as the head coach for the women's swimming program. Usbeck comes to Millersville after a two-year stint as an assistant coach with the Misericordia University swimming programs.\n\nA 2017 graduate of Bloomsburg University, Usbeck was a five-time PSAC Champion and three-time NCAA Division II All-American as a collegiate swimmer. Following his successful career in competition, Usbeck entered the coaching ranks at Misericordia and simultaneously earned a master's degree in organizational management.\n\n\"Eric was an outstanding swimmer in the PSAC and understands what it takes to be successful in this conference and at the Division II level,\" said Gallagher. \"He has recruited the region, and most importantly, he is the right fit for our athletic department. He has the energy and work ethic needed to grow the program.\"\n\n\"I am extremely excited for the opportunity provided to me by Mr. Gallagher and the rest of Millersville University,\" said Usbeck. \"I am looking forward to building upon what we have here and helping our program rise in the PSAC.\"\n\nAs the recruiting coordinator and assistant coach, Usbeck helped the Misericordia women's program to a fourth-place finish at the MAC Championships in 2019, which was a one-place improvement from the previous season. Misericordia also went 2-0 against PSAC foes in dual meets.\n\nIn addition to his experience at Misericordia, Usbeck served as camp counselor at the University at Buffalo and as a swim coach for the Greater Scranton YMCA for three years.\n\nDuring his time as a swimmer at Bloomsburg, Usbeck was an All-PSAC performer 19 times and a five-time PSAC Champion. He was voted team MVP and was the winner of the Robert B. Redman Senior Male Athlete of the Year award in 2017. He was a three-time recipient of Bloomsburg's Dave Gibas Award. He earned All-America honors in the 200- and 400-yard freestyle relays and the 200-yard medley relay. He was an honorable mention All-American in the 100-yard breaststroke and in two relays as a senior. Usbeck set four Bloomsburg and PSAC records as part of relay teams."
