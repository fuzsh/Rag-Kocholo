        "text": "A relevant source to find answers to this questions is the book (out of print in Germany):\n\n[Ferber 1956] Christian von Ferber: Die Entwicklung des Lehrkörpers der deutschen Universitäten und Hochschulen 1864-1954. Band 3 von Untersuchungen zur Lage der deutschen Hochschullehrer. Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1956, 244 pages\n\nwhich is the declared source of the data displayed in the following table:\n\nI did not check these data. And yet, I decided to trust these number. Strictly speaking the statements implicit in the above table are not quite defined, as the time-resolution is too coarse. As a programming exercise, I constructed the following histograms, and computed three usual statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation), pathetic as that may be given such a small sample size:\n\nI recognize that the OP is about mathematics only, and yet, while I was at it, I fed the numbers in [Mehrtens 1990, Tabelle 3] about the subjects physics and chemistry into my program as well, obtaining the following charts, which I reproduce here, too, for comparison:\n\nPhysics:\n\nChemistry:\n\nA specialized reference. The following is restricted to one German university only. In the 19th century, there was but one university in Berlin; there was also the Gewerbeinstitut/Gewerbeakademie (which roughly means 'industry/trade institute'), which had a more limited offering of courses, and was Weierstraß's first academic employer).\n\nA standard source-book for the early history of University of Berlin is:\n\n[Biermann 1988] Kurt-Reinhard Biermann: Die Mathematik und ihre Dozenten an der Berliner Universität 1810-1933. Akademie-Verlag Berlin 1988.\n\nThe book is in German, and is out of print, even in Germany.\n\nThis book meticulously describes the history of University of Berlin in the interval given in the book's title. In particular, the book has voluminous 'backmatter' with reproductions of original documents (such as proposals to the ministry, or reviews of theses; these are not given in facsimile though), and tables on professors and doctoral students; regarding your question, let me simply describe the 'line of succession' in its entirety, taking the liberty to interpret your 'around 1890' as the interval [1810,1933]. The following is my literal translation from [Biermann 1988, p. 343-348]; I couldn't finish the translation yet. [Biermann 1988, p. 341] says that the source for the following list is\n\nJohannes Asen: Gesamtverzeichnis des Lehrkörpers der Universität Berlin. I. 1810-1945. Leipzig 1955\n\nand adds that the data have been 'checked, expanded by numerous additional data, and corrected in some cases'. Biermann says that the basis for these corrections were files in an archive of the 'Philosophische Fakultät' at Berlin, some personnel files, and some university calendars. [Biermann, p. 341] says that the entries are given in 'chronological order, according to the date of the start of the first employment at University Berlin, with ties broken by rank, and ties in both date and rank being broken by alphabetical order of last name'.\n\n$\\quad$\n\n1 Tralles, Johann Georg.

In total, [Biermann 1988] lists 67 lecturers at University of Berlin from 1810 to 1933; of these, 18 are listed as Ordinarius.\n\nRemarks on the definedness of the question. While the intuitive meaning is clear, strictly speaking, 'German universities' in the OP is not well-defined (more defined would be 'German speaking', or 'on the territory of the current Federal Republic of Germany', or, but that would be more restrictive, 'Prussian Universities'): in the 19th century, Germany was more united politically/administratively than in former centuries, but still much less united than e.g. in the 20th-century: in particular, Prussia and the kingdom of Saxony had a difficult relationship throughout the 19th century (and went to war against one another as late as 1866 in the 'Battle of Königgrätz' in which Saxony was allied with Austria against Prussia). The kingdom of Bavaria was yet another separate administrative entity. And yet, the Saxon university of Leipzig, and the Bavarian universities of Erlangen and Munich were 'German universities', too, though completely independently administered. To give an anecdote: a letter of Weierstraß, dated 20 December 1885, has survived in which he expresses his outrage at Klein having helped Sophus Lie to a chair at Leipzig (which, Weierstraß implies, should have gone to a German, not to a foreigner, and a young foreigner at that), and then Weierstraß (professor at Berlin) explicitly says that if Leipzig was a Prussian university, he would protest with the ministry (and implies that the Prussian ministry does not have any say in matters of Leipzig University). Such administrative independence is perhaps hard to guess given the proximity of the cities of Leipzig and Berlin. And then there are the issues around University of Strasbourg and University of Königsberg, both of which were German speaking for some time (and the latter having a role in the history of mathematics) but aren't any more.\n\nProfessors of mathematics with rank 'Ordinarius' at German-speaking universities in the requested year 1890.\n\nTo answer the OP systematically, it is necessary to first enumerate all German-speaking universities in 1890. Not all German universities which currently exist already existed back then. According to the source [Ferber 1956, p. 37], in 1890 there were the following German-speaking universities (I list the polytechnics, too, though these are not universities in the usual sense, and accordingly were called 'Hochschule' in the 19th century):\n\nAachen (Technische Hochschule) : (...)\n\nBerlin: Fuchs: Ordinarius since 1884\n\nBerlin: Kronecker: Ordinarius since 1883\n\nBerlin: Weierstraß: Ordinarius since 1862\n\nBerlin (Technische Hochschule): du Bois-Reymond: Etatmäßiger Professor (i.e. the analogue of 'Ordinarius' at the 'Hochschulen'; similar to the status of being a 'faculty member' mentioned in the OP) 1884 (cf. page 446 of this source)\n\nBerlin (Technische Hochschule): Weingarten: Ordinarius since 1871\n\nBonn: Lipschitz: Ordinarius since 1864\n\nBraunsberg (Lyceum Hosianum): Killing: Ordinarius since since 1882\n\nBraunschweig (Technische Hochschule): Dedekind: Ordinarius since 1862 (Direktor 1872-75)\n\nBreslau: Rosanes: Ordinarius since 1876\n\nDorpat (now Tartu; German-speaking throughout 19th century): Kneser: Ordinarius since since 1890\n\nDresden (Technische Hochschule): Krause: Ordinarius since 1888\n\nErlangen: Noether: Ordinarius since 1888\n\nFreiburg: (...)\n\nGießen: Pasch: Ordinarius since 1875 (dean 1885, rector 1893)\n\nGießen: Netto: Ordinarius since 1888\n\nGöttingen: Klein: Ordinarius since 1886\n\nGöttingen: Schwarz: Ordinarius since 1875 (successor of Fuchs)\n\nGöttingen: Schering: Ordinarius since 1868 (with regard to the OP, Schering is a borderline case, as this source explicitly says he was \"ohne spezielle Zuordnung zum Fach Mathematik\"; Schering is perhaps most remembered for his work as editor of Gauß's collected works)\n\nGraz (Technische Hochschule): Mertens: Ordinarius since 1884\n\nGreifswald: (...)\n\nHalle: Cantor: Ordinarius since 1879\n\nHalle: Wangerin: Ordinarius since 1882\n\nHannover (Technische Hochschule): Runge: Ordinarius since 1886\n\nHeidelberg: Koenigsberger: Ordinarius since 1884 (retired 1914, resumed teaching in 1918)\n\nJena: Thomae: Ordinarius since 1879\n\nKarlsruhe (Technische Hochschule): Schell: Ordinarius since 1863\n\nKönigsberg: Lindemann: Ordinarius since 1883 (changed to Münchenin 1893)\n\nLeipzig: Neumann: Ordinarius since 1868\n\nLeipzig: Scheibner: Ordinarius since 1868\n\nMarburg: Weber: Ordinarius since 1884 (dean at Marburg 1887, rector at Marburg 1891; changed to Göttingen in 1892)\n\nMünchen: Seidel: Ordinarius since 1855\n\nMünster: Sturm: Ordinarius since 1878\n\nMünster: Bachmann: Ordinarius since 1868. (Bachmann is a borderline case with regard to the OP, since Bachmann left the position in the very year 1890. He was Ordinarius at Münster in 1890 though. This is an example of the 'time-resolution'-objection noted in the histograms; very strictly speaking, the case of Bachmann alone is enough reason to consider the table in [Mehrtens 1990] strictly-speaking ill-defined).\n\nRostock: (...)\n\nStrasbourg: (...)\n\nTübingen: (...)\n\nWien: Weyr: Ordinarius since 1875\n\nWien: Stefan: Ordinarius since 1863\n\nWien (Hochschule für Bodenkultur): Schlesinger: Ordinarius since 1875\n\nWürzburg: Prym: Ordinarius since 1869\n\nZürich: Geiser: Ordinarius since 1873"
