        "text": "Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (1849 - 1917) German mathematician, best known for being the first to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem . Several different mathematical concepts now bear his name, including the Frobenius algebra, various Frobenius morphisms, the Frobenius map, the Frobenius group, the Frobenius inequality, etc.\n\nBorn in Charlottenburg, Frobenius earned a doctorate at the University of Berlin for his thesis on differential equations with Karl Weierstraß (http://planetmath.org/KarlWeierstrass) as his advisor. After that he taught mathematics in Berlin and Zürich, and researched group theory (proving the existence of Sylow groups) and number theory . In the lead-up to World War I, Frobenius began investigating matrices. He died in Berlin in 1917 and was buried there.\n\nTitle Georg Frobenius Canonical name GeorgFrobenius Date of creation 2013-03-22 17:24:45 Last modified on 2013-03-22 17:24:45 Owner PrimeFan (13766) Last modified by PrimeFan (13766) Numerical id 7 Author PrimeFan (13766) Entry type Biography Classification msc 01A55 Classification msc 01A60 Synonym Ferdinand Georg Frobenius"
