The only knownsurviving mathematical manuscript by Alfred North Whitehead.Manuscript material by Whitehead has never come to public auction, and in fact, any manuscript material by him is of the utmost rarity, with even institutional holdings being very minimal. It is common academic tradition to leave one'sNachlassto a favored graduate student or in a scholarly archive so that it may be available to future scholars.

In 2011, a 6-page letter from Whitehead was donated to the Library of Congress from the estate of Whitehead's former assistant. In honor of this most rare item, the Library of Congress held a symposium focusing \"on the historical context of the letter and on Whitehead and his intellectual focus in a number of fields.

In the present manuscript, likely written ca 1900, possibly in early preparation for his magnus opus, Principia Mathematica, Whitehead takes a deep look at several issues in mathematics, primarily in regards to bilinear forms, homogeneous functions, and quadratic forms, as discussed in the work of mathematicians Karl Weierstrass and Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, and citing the work of several other mathematicians, most notably George Salmon. Widely known as the \"father of modern analysis\" Weierstrass was a German mathematician who was one of the founders of the modern theory of functions.
