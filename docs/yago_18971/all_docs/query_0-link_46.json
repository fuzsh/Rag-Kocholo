Though performing artists and exponents in the field are comparatively few in number, there are thousands who love and admire the excellent heritage of our culture, namely, the dances of India. As the topic itself indicates, it is not a subject on which everyone can write authoritatively. Therefore, it was very essential to invite contributions on different topics from the artists and exponents of dance in different parts of the country. With a deep sense of gratitude, we express our hearty thanks’ to all those artists who extended their valuable help and co-operation promptly, and made our venture a good success. They not only sent articles but also helped us with a good number of relevant photographs, which have added much to the richness and quality of the volume. Besides, on a subject like this, when the attempt is to try to give a fairly comprehensive picture, one has to necessarily reproduce certain ,widely accepted and standard articles connected with the theme. This could be done only with the generous help and co-operation extended to us by the various publishers of books and ;magazines. While thanking them earnestly, we give below the names and addresses of the publishers who have helped us by giving their permission to publish in this volume whatever portions we required:\n\n1.\n\nTraditions of Indian Folk-Dance by Dr. Kapila Vatsyayan, Publishers: Indian Book Company, New Delhi.

There seems to have been some Nata Sutras even before this Sastra was penned. But they have either been lost or got dissolved into the present Natyasastra. The term Natya encompasses in itself all the artistic elements of the Theatre Art. Dance was only a part of drama in ancient India. But drama itself was mostly danced. There was hardly any bifurcation between these arts in the true Hindu theatre. Like the Hindu religion, which is itself a fusion of the Aryans’ . Vedic yagna and the non-Aryans’ Agamic puja, the Hindu theatre also took the form of a homogeneous presentation of dance and drama. Dance seems to have been a favourite sport of the non-Aryans, while drama, with its literary beauty was the Aryan’s love. The art of dance developed as drama through its getting mingled with the Aryan culture. Natya was the term which indicated this composite whole. The term Sangita was always referred to in its triple aspects viz., Gita (song), Vadya (instrumental music) and Nritta (dance). All the earlier works on Sangita had chapters on everyone of these elements. Natya included these three plus drama too. The Natya sastra is an unsurpassed\n\nT\n\ncompendious work dealing with all these elements in totality and running to thirtysix chapters. It is highly probable that this composite work was written during the course of a few centuries, by authors of the same pen-name. Hence this work may be considered as an extraordinary compilation of a series of supplemental treatises on the subject. This clearly proves the exclusive importance that the nucleus of the original treatise on Natya and its author Bharata enjoyed in the ancient Hindu society. Natya, in its complete form consists of music, dance and communication through expression. Of these, the second and third elements are known as Nritta and Abhinaya, respectively. The Natya- sastra describes all these elements in great detail. Later, authorities like Saarangadeva (12th century A.D.) recognised another form called Nritya and defined it as a representational kind of Nritta. But Bharata’s period had the arts of only Nritta and Abhinaya as parts of Natya. Nritta could be handled in two ways, viz., Uddhata (gracefully forceful) and Sukumara (gracefully soft). These obtained the names of Tandava and Lasya perhaps only after Kalidasa’s time. During Bharata’s\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n4\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nperiod, the term Tandava seems to have been a synonym of Nritta. The Aryans seem to have freely incorporated the art of Nritta into their Natya. Ever since then, Natya was almost suffused with Nritta. Its actual place in it is revealed through the study of the nature of Natya. The goal of any Natya is only to create Rasa. Rasa is the enjoyment of an aesthetic bliss’ derived through witnessing or reading a production. The process through which this is achieved is the sub- structure of the varied rules analytically laid down in the Natyasastra. The Bhava, i.e. feeling, contained in a situation and the character involved has to be expressed by the actor or the writer, as the case may be, in such a way that it can be understood by the onlooker or reader. Unless the feelings and ideas are communicated, the audience cannot share those feelings, which ultimately is responsible for evoking Rasa. The art of communication is called Abhinaya. There are four mediums of expression available for the artists. This analysis, given in the Natyasastra, is so accurate and universal that it is valid even today, for any production in any part of the world. The four Abhinayas are: Angika (physical), Vachika (verbal), Aharya (external) and Satvika. (internal) Angikabhinaya is the art of physical expression. The entire human body has been analysed in the Natyasastra as Angas (major limbs) and Pratyangas (minor limbs). Later, authorities added to this classification the Upangas (subsidiary limbs) which in turn, were divided as those belonging exclusively to the face and those of the other limbs of the body. Exercises from head\n\nto foot are prescribed for each limb, based highly on kinetic principles. The student was expected to master these individual exercises and proceed to practising combinations of movements of various limbs. These exercises are to be meaningfully utilised to convey ideas and more important than that, feelings. This is the essence of Angika Abhinaya. Physical expression is a part of human nature. The connection between the psyche and the physic is so intrinsic, that even the minutest vibration of the mind gets easily reflected through the body in daily life itself. For instance, nodding the head is part of human behaviour while reacting. The force, speed and space of our pacing also reflect the inner composure and conflicts. The art of physical expression is hence beautifully conceived, classified and codified by Bharata, to artistically suit a dramatic representation. Angikabhinaya is of two categories. One is the Padarthabhinaya while the other is Vakyarthabhinaya. The former means the expression of word to word meaning, while the latter is a communication of the general idea of a sentence or even the mood. For the actual execution of these, three mediums are given, viz., Sakha, Ankura and Nritta. Sakha literally means branch; Ankura is sprout while Nritta is dance. Sakha indicates the availability of an entire system of gesticulation through the hands. A complete language of gestures has been handed down by generations of artistes. These hand gestures are of two kinds. One is a group of Abhinaya Hastas and the other is a set of Nritta Hastas. The former is\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n5\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nsub-divided as Asamyuta (single hand) and Samyuta (combined hand) gestures. These Abhinaya Hastas are used to bring out the Padarthabhinaya. The practical application of the given set of Abhinaya Hastas is called Ankura. The second group of gestures called the Nritta Hastas are to be used in NrittaDance. These may be used in the art of Vakyarthabhinaya. The most obvious requirement for the actors was the mastery over Angikabhinaya for, this medium of expression was used in full measure in ancient Natya. This is nothing short of demanding dancing talent in actors. The scenes like Sakuntala watering the plants or the bee harassing her, or even Dushyanta riding the chariot, were all enacted with suitable gestures and movements. The Caris and Gatis involving the legs were to be used to represent the various characters and situations. Their combinations called the Mandalas were to be used to enact fighting sequences. The Angaharas which involve the Karanas were primarily meant for invoking the blessings of the gods and manes in the preliminary of the play. They were also to be used wherever the emotion of love dominated. These Angaharas involve hand gestures.\n\nBut the Mandalas are groups of dance movements to be used along with holding weapons like the bow and arrow. The Nyayas or rules for such a handling are also laid down. The actors were actually dancers. All these prove that Natya was enacted as Nritta in all the practical sense. Abhinavagupta is of the opinion that Natya and Nritta are not different from each other from the view of actual practice. Of course, unless one is able to comprehend the nature of the Natya of those bygone days, it will not be possible to digest the idea of the arts of drama and dance not being different. The Natya of ancient India was a wholesome combination of the present day play, opera and ballet. The exacting nature of the talent of the artistes was in the form of their being expected to speak, sing and dance. Bharata has mentioned only Natya and Nritta, while the classification and rigid crystallisation of the term Nritya, as understood today is not found in his work. But Nritta itself can be presented as representational or nonrepresentational. It can be a part of the\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n6\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nactual body of the play, or adorn the preliminary of the same. In any case, Nritta was considered as a limb of Natya. In other words, it is enlisted under Angikabhinaya by Abhinavagupta, the commentator. Sakha, Ankura and Nritta are the three elements of physical expression. This means that Nritta is the expression of ideas through the movements of the entire ‘body. This aspect of Angikabhinaya has gone into oblivion in the course of the past four or five centuries. Angikabhinaya has come to mean the mere art of hand gestures based on the Abhinaya Hastas delineated in a more recent work, viz., Nandikeswara’s Abhinaya Darpanam. The art of using the entire body to convey ideas is Nritta according to the Bharata tradition. Later, authorities classified Nritya as representational and Nritta as non-representational arts. But, Bharata’s Nritta was both re-presentational and non-representational. It was an art to be mastered by the actors and dancers. Every major and minor limb was to undergo exercises which were to be practised, independent of each other as well as being woven into one fabric. These Vyayamas formed the foundation of Nritta. The limbs of the body are classified as Angas-major limbs which include the hand, chest, sides, waist, hands and feet. Upangas are the minor limbs such as the neck, elbows, shoulders, belly, thighs, shanks, knees and heels; the Upangas of the face are eyes, eye-brows, nose, lower lip and chin. Later, authorities like Sarangadeva classified the limbs into three groups as Angas (major limbs), Pratyangas (subsidiary limbs) and Upangas (minor limbs). Exercises for each of the Angas and Upangas are named and described in the Natyasastra. These are\n\nso analytical that they almost exhaust the possibilities of human ability. They create an unlimited scope for the artistic use of the body. The pedagogy of the technique has been unfortunately lost along with the technique itself. Bharata’s Nritta is no easy path. It cannot lend itself for celebrating Arangetrams in six months! It does not allow us to get satisfied with the mere footwork technique of the Adavu system of Sadir or any other isolated dance style of today. The feet are only one of the Angas and hence the steps are not the end of this demanding style. Every limb has to be under the control of the dancers in the Bharata Nritta. In the process. of this achievement, the first stage is the learning of the Vyayarnas which are exercises of the Angas and Upangas. Three basic elements mark the second stage of learning the Nritta. These are the Sthanas (postures of the body), Nritta Hastas (course of movements of the arms and hands) and Caris (the specific way of moving the leg). Then comes the particularisation of the combinations of the three elements of Nritta Hasta, Sthana and Cari. Any such single combination is given the name Karana. The Natyasastra has enlisted and enumerated 108 such combinations under the name of Karanas. The Karanas should be understood as a unit of Nritta. The foundation as well as the pinnacle of Bharata’s Nritta is the Karana. Before going into the details of the Karanas, it is essential to grasp the concept of its elements. Sthana denotes the Sthithi or the static aspect. It is the definite posture of the body which decides the\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n7\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nphysical lines and the space the body occupies. These Sthanas depend on the varied positions of the feet. Sthanas are based on the Padabhedas such as Sarna, Parswa, Tryasra, Ancita, Agratalasanchara, Suci and Kuncita. The Sthanas involve the positions of the entire legs unlike the Padabhedas which involve only the feet. The knees play a prominent role in this formation. Bharata has mentioned six Sthanas for men in Chapter and three for women in Chapter XIII. This does not mean that they cannot or should not be used by the contrary sex. In addition to these standing postures, he has given nine sitting postures (Asanas) and six reclining postures in Chapter XIII. Sarangadeva has given a list of fifty Sthanas including Desi (Folk, Novel and Exotic) postures. The Sthanas of Bharata and Sarangadeva do not involve the hands. But later works like the Naiya sastra Sangraha prescribe the hand gestures for the Sthanas. Sthanas or Sthanakas, as they are variedly referred to, are in short definite positions of the body in which the legs and hands are to be moved in a Karana. The second element of major importance in a Karana is the Nritta Hasta. Hastas are the hand gestures which can be broadly classified as those of communicative significance and others of mere aesthetic\n\nvalue. The former is called Abhinaya Hasta and the latter type connected with Nritta is called Nritta Hasta. The Abhinaya Hastas are also of two kinds, viz., Asamyuta-single hand gestures and Samyuta—com- bined hand gestures. Bharata has given a list of 24 Asamyuta, 13 Samyuta and 30 Nritta Hastas. The main difference between the Abhinaya Hasta and Nritta Rasta is in their static and dynamic qualities. The original form of the Abhinaya Hasta is static and involves just the fingers. This static form of Abhinaya Hasta is motivated in several ways to bring out several ideas. For example, the first Abhinaya Hasta, Pataka literally meaning flag, can be moved in various ways to depict ideas such as you, me, sky, floor, clouds, opening or closing doors, welcoming or driving out and many other such contrary ideas. But each Nritta Hasta has a definite course of action involving the entire arms and not just the palms; thirty such actions are described. These actions depend on the four Hasta Karanas (four ways of whirling the wrists). The thirty Nritta Hastas are based on such rolling actions of the hands and arms. The Nritta Hastas of Bharata’s period are now obsolete; only a few are seen scattered in the various dance styles. The third element that constitutes the Karana is the Cari. It has its roots in Car\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n8\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nwhich means to move one’s self, go, walk or roam about, get diffused and to continue performing. The term Cari indicates all the meaning given for its root. Bharata defines it as the simultaneous movements of the thigh, shank and feet. Hence, the Cari is a movement which causes the action of the entire leg. Thirty-two such Caris are described under the classification of Bhu Cari and Akasa Cari. The sixteen Bhu Caris are the movements of the feet close to the ground while the sixteen Akasa Caris are movements, involving leaps, jumps and extensions of the leg off the ground. These Akasa Caris remind us of some of the Plies of the Western Classical Ballet. Hence, it is erroneous on the part of some scholars to assume that Indian Dance has no movements involving actions on the air or having the extension of the thighs. This wrong impression is caused by the fact that these Akasa Caris have become obsolete in the presently known traditions. The Karana, being a combination of Sthana, Nritta Hasta and Cari, is certainly a movement and not a mere pose as normally being misunderstood. Karana has its root in Krn meaning doer, causer, doing,making, producing, helping the act of doing and on the whole, any action. The word Karana also suggests the idea of being an instrument, an element and an Anga or part of something, and in dance, it is a unit of action. We have words like Antahkarana, meaning an inner part, i.e., the conscience. We also have the popular usage like ‘Manasa Vaca Karmanaha tridha Karanani’ meaning by the three means of thought, word and deed. Hence, Karana is a means to some end. Karanas are woven to form an\n\nAngahara (a chain of dance movements). The major difference between the technique of Bharata’s Nritta and that of our contemporary Nritta is in the use of the legs, space and patterns. The extension of the legs caused by the Akasa Caris have been practically lost. All the present styles depend on the foot-work technique only. The use of the legs from the root of the thighs down to the toes has been out of vogue for nearly five centuries. The various aspects of Bharata Nritta are seen scattered in the so-called regional styles and very often seen in the neighbouring cultures of Ceylon, Burma and Indonesia. The distinctions of the regional dance styles of India are because each of them has just either retained or concentrated on the isolated aspects of Nritta. The Kathak has the Sarna Sthana as its main stay, while the Sadir and its sister styles have the Mandala Sthana. The Vaisakha and Vaishnava are seen more in the Kathakali. The Hasta Karanas and some Nritta Hastas are retained in Manipuri while the South has managed to preserve all the Abhinaya Hastas. In the eyes of those who have studied the practical aspects of the Naiya sastra, almost any dance style of our country reveals a basic unity in the apparent diversity. Almost every dance movement can be explained against the backdrop of the Natyasastra. The unlimited scope offered in this text, when used in practice, gives room for unending variety. The new term Bharata Natyam for the older term Sadir has created a fair amount of confusion in regard to its antiquity. This\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n9\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nstyle is just one kind of Bharata Natyam, if we take the term Bharata Natyam to mean that Natya which follows Bharata’s work. It is partiality to associate the name of this great sage with just one of the styles that still retains the traces of his Natyasastra. In fact, the present Bharata Natyam is more of Nritta and Nritya in its nature than Natya in its true sense. Every style of dance has in it some aspect of the Natyasastra still lingering. Hence, the various styles may be referred to as, Bharata Natyam in Manipuri style, Bharatanatyam in Sadir style, Bharatanatyam in Kathakali style and so on. In the eyes of one who has studied the Natyasastra all the so-called major dance styles of India appear like the different shades of the same colour. Are we not used to recognising all the substyles such as those of Thanjavur, Vazhuvur, etc., as Bharatanatyam and the Gharanas of Lucknow, Jaipur and others as Kathak? It is only an extension of the same. The evolution of the Karanas can be seen in all these styles. Some examples are the changed forms of Mattalli Karana in Kuchipudi, Paraswajanu Udvrittam and Mandalaswastikam in Sadir, many of the Karanas involving Tribhang in Odissi, Atikranta and Parswakranta in Kathakali, Vartitam in Mohini Attam, Adhyardhika Cari in Manipuri, Karanas involving Bhramaris in Kathak and Vivrttam in Yakshagana. The use of the entire legs and arms in the Caris and Nritta Hastas give the Karanas definite character. These do differ from the established and well-remembered classical traditions. It is natural that the performances of these Karanas disturb those who are soaked in any one of the\n\nmost angular sub-styles of the Sadir. The fact is that Bharata’s Nritta is all embracing. A resurrection of the lost technique has proved that Bharatanatya in its true sense is Bharatiya Natya. Another interesting factor of Bharata’s Nritta is that it is suitable for both the sexes. The same set of 108 Karanas are meant for both the male and the female dancers. There are no separate movements for Lasya and Tandava. In fact, the term Tandava is used only as a synonym of Nritta in the Natyasastra. This Tandava is common for both the sexes. The chapter dealing with the Karanas is called Tandava Lakshanam. The Katanas are called Nritta Katanas. Though their origin is attributed to Lord Siva, it is handled by Parvati Devi and the apsara women too. Hence, we must realise a basic fact, that though the format of the action are the same, due to the inherent differences in nature of the male and female, the ultimate effect is different when they are performed. The forceful style of presentation is given the name Uddhata and the soft execution of the same is called Sukumara. Hence, according to Natya- sastra, Nritta or Tandava may be performed as per the Uddhata or Sukumara usage. It should also be kept in mind that the Uddhata and Sukumara usages are not to be compartmentalised for the male and the female dancers. As and when necessity arises, these can be interchanged in consonance with the character and the situation. Dance, Gymnastics and Acrobatics have all often got mixed up in the course of their development. This is true of the dance of every part of the world. In fact, some\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n10\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nof the more acrobatic Karanas must be viewed from the point of view of exercise and in the case of Natya, their proper use in the relevant sequences. For example, the somersault was meant for fighting sequences and certainly not for being included in the Angaharas to represent love. The movements which are more of acrobatic nature were actually termed as Adhama-inferior in a later work called Mahabharata Chudamani. The ideal Nritta is that which emanates beauty and joy at the various levels of human understanding and perceptions such as physical, intellectual, emotional and spiritual. The level of Nritta is directly proportional to the level of the dancer’s realisation of her own inner personality; this is quite apart from her physical beauty or even skill. Nritta is a spiritual experience for the ideal dancer and the ideal audience. It is a means through which the dancer achieves a shedding of her body consciousness. As in Yoga, in dance too, the body is trained only to be forgotten about. The dancer’s self, integrated with the universal dance of all the constant Cosmic Activity, liberates her from all the shackles of this earth. The dancer herself becomes a microcosmic being, experiencing within herself unlimited freedom and bliss. The result of such a Nritta is the same as that of Yoga and Yagna. Apart from the art of Angikabhinaya in which Nritta also IS meluded, Indian theatre has long recognised the use of Vachikabhinayaverbal expression, Aharyabhinayaexpression through external elements like costumes, make-up and scenery and last\n\nbut not the least Satvikabhinaya-an outcome of the psychological states of mind. Vachikabhinaya includes the dialogues and songs. It may be prose or poetry. Voice modulation and its control, playa major role in this form of communication. The Natyasastra gives even the rules of prosody. The language employed is also expected to suit the various characters. All the plays of our contemporary theatre seem to utilise only Vachikabhinaya and that too devoid of songs. The Aharyabhinaya included the specific facial make-up, colours, crowns, jewelry and costumes for each character. Satvikabhinaya is perhaps the most important, yet the most difficult mode of expression. It cannot be gained through mere learning or practice. It needs an innate sense to feel the various situations. It depends on the mental involvement of the performer backed by a clear intellectual grasp of the characterisation to be portrayed. Sat literally means ‘mind’. Even in actual life, it is most natural that the inner feelings get reflected in the face. Apart from the facial expressions, the eight Satvika conditions are said to be stupor, perspiration, horripilation, change of voice, trembling, change of colour, tears and fainting. The four-fold art of Abhinaya can further be classified as Natya- dharmi (stylistic) and Lokadharmi (realistic). The Natya was the combination of both these modes of expression. Natyadharmi pertains to the conventions of the stage. For example, walking around the stage may denote a change of place. The use of dance in drama is itself Natya- dharmi. The convention in a play, according to\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n11\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nwhich persons are supposed not to hear words uttered in proximity, or to hear what has not been uttered at all, are all part of Natyadharmi. In this conventional stylistic mode, the actor may dance instead of walking. In short, anything which is beyond the purview of realism, but presented in an artistically appealing manner is Natyadharmi. If, on the other hand, the play depends on natural behaviour, presented as simple acting with no flourishes of even physical expression, it is called Lokadharmi. A deeper insight into the Natyadharmi and Lokadharmi modes reveal that the former is formal and perhaps easier to be handled whereas the latter is informal, but requires a consummate skill, understanding, mental involvement, imagination and sobriety. The former can be taught, but the latter has to be felt and hence it requires an artiste of greater experience in communication. It is also true that Lokadharmi, when treated well, is more easily understood even by an uninitiated audience. But the Natyadharmi reaches only those who are at least fairly well versed with the conventions of the stage. The use of hand gestures is directly proportional to the degree of Natyadharmi. It is interesting to note that Bharata has stated that in superior persons, hand gestures should have scanty movements, in mediocre ones, there should be medium movements, while in the acting of ordinary persons, there should be profuse movements of hand gestures. But when different occasions or time ‘present themselves, wise people should make varied use of the hand gestures. Bharata has also mentioned that the hand gestures are to\n\nbe totally discarded when ne has to enact situations such as fainting, dreaming or being terrified, disgusted or overcome by sorrow and so on. Such scenes need to be enacted through Satvikabhinaya. This expression of inner feelings without the use of gestures is closer to the concept of Lokadharmi or realism. Hence the situations and characters fully charged with emotion are expected to depend only upon Satvikabhinaya in the Lokadharmi style. Bharata’s Natya was a combination of both the stylistic and the realistic modes of expression, thus adding to its unending variety. Apart from the differences in the modes of communication, Natya on the whole, is to be constructed in one or a mixture of the four styles called Vrittis. They are Bharati, Arabhati, Satvati and Kaisiki. Here they are interpreted from a practical point of view. Bharati is the verbal style, depending mainly on the beauties of Vachikabhinaya. Use of flowery language as well as the slang suitable for the specific characters are the main features of this Vritti. The mere reading of the play itself must be satiating in the Bharati Vritti. Language and diction with proper voice modulation mark the strength of this style. Arabhati Vritti is the forceful style characterised by a predominance of combats, arousing the psychological states of fury, hatred and wonder. The combats are to be performed through the use of Mandalas. Hence it involves a fair amount of Natyadharmi with Angik- abhinaya of the Uddhata or forceful nature. It also needs pageantry and glamour through elaborate scene settings,\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n12\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\ncostumes and make-up. Hence Aharyabhinaya plays a major role in the Arabhati Vritti. Satvati Vritti depends mainly on the strength of the emotional content. The main feature are the moulding of the characters, and story with enough scope for Satvikabhinaya. This naturally amounts to a greater use of Lokadharmi with only a little use of gestures. Satvati has been translated as the ‘Grand Style’. Perhaps this description suits the glamour of the Arabhati style. Sat denotes psyche and hence Satvati Vritti may be understood as the emotional style, wherein Satvikabhinaya dominates. Satvika also denotes the Satvaguna-the superior qualities of human thought and its consequential behaviour, the other qualities of a relatively lower gradation being Rajoguna and Tamoguna. The play in Satvati Vritti is expected to portray characters of higher qualities. Even if there are sequences of fights and personal combats, they must be based on the Nyayas (strict adherence to the proper rules). Of course, the essence of all Indian plays is the victory of the good over the evil. The Satvati Vritti needs to suppress even sorrow. This style, on the whole should be taken to require subdued acting (without being demonstrative) with a realistic expression of feelings and concepts of a superior nature. The Kaisiki Vritti is different from the Satvati Vritti in its Natya- dharmi character. Kaisiki needs delicate emotions like, love, portrayed through Angikabhinaya. It needs the support of glittering costumes, lil- ting music and cultivated dance, all melting together to make an amalgam of\n\npleasantness. It needs beautiful women, like the heavenly damsels, the Apsaras. They are said to have been created by Lord Brahma to fulfil the requirement of this Vritti. It is likely that it is the concept of Apsaras that gave to the Indian stage the Kaisiki Vritti itself. This idea of feminine grace-Lasya-which has come down to this day is certainly a product of the influence of these imaginative dancing demigoddesses. The Kaisiki Vritti is still seen having its sway in the Indian movies wherein the heroine is unhesitatingly portrayed as singing and almost dancing the pathetic songs, even when portraying the contemporary society. The stylism in the Indian movie is the result of its inheritance from the traditional Indian theatre. The older Tamil dramas of this century were, and are still marked by a profuse use of music. Such musical dramas of Tamilnadu have their own parallels in other parts of our country. The most amazing fact is the permanent value of Bharata’s analysis and classifications of the art of dramatic presentation. The ideas of the four modes of communication, realism, stylism and the four basic styles of the theatre art hold good, for any part of the world and at any point of time. Almost any production can. be analysed against this basic backdrop of the Natyasastra. The Natyasastra does not stop with the mere analysis of the Vrittis. It has also given advice to artistes regarding the choice of the specific styles, in a pure or mixed fashion· to suit the taste of the audience of the various regions. These are broadly classified under four Pravrittis,\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n13\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\ntaking geographic divisions into consideration. These are called Dakshinatya, Avanti, Odramagadhi and Panchali. The geographical names mentioned in the Natyasastra with regard to these Pravrittis are met with in the Puranas. The Dakshinatya Pravritti pertains to the land south of the Vindhya mountains and uses the Kaisiki Vritti. Avanti belongs to the western region and makes use of the Kaisiki and Satvati Vrittis. Odramagadhi is meant for the eastern region including Nepal and is expected to use the Kaisiki and Bharati Vrittis. Panchali is with regard to the northern region; For this the Satvati and Arabhati Vrittis are recommended. Combinations in varying degrees of the different elements of Naiya like the four Abhinayas, the two Dharmis and the four Vrittis with all the aspects of Sangita viz., Gita, Vadhya and Nritta gave rise to a number of major and minor types of drama. These were the Rupas or Rupakas, and the Uparupakas respectively. Bharata mentions only the ten major Rupas. Later history shows that many minor plays called Uparupakas were developed as dance and music dramas. All the present operatic, dramatic and dance forms can be studied in relation to the older Rupakas and Uparupakas. In this context, the dance known as Bharatanatyam today, is neither Naiya in its true sense nor does it faithfully follow Bharata. It has the aspects of Nritta and Padarthabhinaya performed mostly as solo dance. In fact, it is closer to the concept of Lasya as found in the Naiya-sastra. Lasya, according-to Bharata’s work, includes a set of songs or verses to be\n\nsung or recited by a solo female dancer. These are at least somewhat similar to the general format of the present Bharatanatyam. But this Lasya of Bharata’s work is only one of the sparks from the great fire of Natya which was of a major composite structure. Except the Abhinaya Hastas, the present Bharatanatyam has not retained many of the intricacies of even Bharata’s Nritya and Abhinaya. There are other dramatic forms· which are close to Bharata’s Natya in their conception if not in their technique. The Therukkoothu and Bhagavatamela of Tamilnadu, Koodiattam and Chakkiarkoothu of Kerala, the Bhagavata Atta of Kuchipudi and of other similar villages of Andhra, and the Yakshagana of Karnataka, are some of the theatrical forms which show an underlying unity in their format in spite of their linguistic diversity. All these forms are descendants of Bharata’s Natya and hence all the four Abhinayas play an equal role in them. The artistes are expected to speak sing and dance. Mime plays a major role in them. The songs are in the local languages. But the general character of these plays is highly unified. There is a striking similarity even in their Aharya. The large crowns the jewels, their shoulder pieces and the makeup have a striking similarity. The characters are represented with their suitable Gatis (gaits) along with the songs called Darus. The origin of the Daru can be traced in the Druva, a musical form mentioned in the Natyasastra. The types of Darus are common to all these. Only their names and metres change. The Sutradhara (the director of the play) introduces the play in the prologue. He is called the Kattiyakkaran\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n14\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nin Tamil. The Tiraisilai (the hand-held curtain) is used in all these forms to introduce major characters. Except the Koodiattam, all these other theatre forms are enacted only by male artistes. Bharata’s Natya is so comprehensive that its elements are invariably met with in a scattered manner, even in the remotest corners of our country. Its compendious nature is a testimony to the unparalleled artistic and intellectual synthesis of ancient Indian theatre. With the help of this Sastra, we are able to analyse and appreciate any theatrical form of the world. It is amazing how this art had been fully developed in all the possible aspects, even at a period when some parts of the world were still sleeping in the cradle of civilisation. The unlimited scope it offers for creativity, in spite of recording even the minutest detail of the art of action and acting, speaks for the unending variety of interpretation, that generations of artistes have been able to conceive for the same rules. The general impression of some scholars that Indian theatre offers no scope for creativity and imagination is actually baseless. The Natya- sastra and other texts are like grammar and the artistes who handle them are like poets. The freedom which poets have within the frame-work of the rules of grammar and prosody, is certainly enjoyed by the actors and dancers. The terms Margi and Desi in both music and dance signified the older and newer forms. As centuries passed, the spontaneous creativity of the artistes of various regions were also codified under the name of ‘Desi’; ‘Margi’ signified\n\nBharata’s tradition. Hence, like a living language, the performing arts of India have also been undergoing changes constantly. This does not mean that they ever lost their roots at any point of time. The Indian artiste finds audience of the level of appreciation which is equal to her own mental calibre. After all, Natya is said to yield all the fruits of life-Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. Hence the artistes have been and are still serving as poets, using the rules laid down in the Sastras to create their own worlds of art. Bharata’s Natya has its deep roots in every part of our country. It has also spread its principles at all the levels of appreciation. Natya is an imitation of the three worlds and hence all types of characters are included in it. It has always had the responsibility and capacity to satisfy people of various tastes. In spite of laying the qualities of even an ideal spectator, Bharata says that the inferior and common persons in an assembly which consists of the superior, the middling and the inferior members, cannot be expected to appreciate the performance of the superior ones. And hence an individual to whom a particular dress, profession, speech and an act belong as his own, should be considered fit for appreciating the same. That is why we need Sahrdaya (audience of equal mental calibre) to make the performance of Natya a real success. As water finds its own level, Natya too finds its own audience at various planes of human perception.\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n15\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nThe Dance Of Shiva\n\nANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY\n\nT\n\nhe Lord of Tillai’s Court a mystic dance performs; What’s that, my dear?” - Tiruvachagam,XII.14\n\nAmongst the greatest of the names of Shiva is Nataraja, Lord of Dancers, or King of Actors. The Cosmos is His theatre. There are many different steps in His repertory. He Himself is actor and audienceWhen the Actor beats the drum, Everybody comes to see the show; When the Actor Collects the stage properties He abides alone in His happiness. How many various dances of Shiva are known to His worshippers I cannot say. No doubt the root idea behind all these dances is more or less one and the same, the manifestation of primal rhythmic energy. Shiva is the Eros Protogonos of Lucian, when he wrote: “It would seem that dancing came into being at the beginning of all things, and was brought to light together with Eros, that ancient one, for we see this primeval dancing clearly set forth in the choral dance of the constellations, and in the planets and fixed stars, their inter-weaving and interchange and orderly harmony”. I do not mean to say that the most profound interpretation of Shiva’s dance was present in the minds of those who first danced in frantic, and perhaps\n\nintoxicated energy, in honour of the preAryan hill-god, afterwards merged in Shiva. A great motif in religion or art, any great symbol, becomes all things to all men; age after age it yields to men such treasures as they find in their own hearts. Whatever be the origin of Shiva’s dance, it became in time the clearest image of the activity of god which any art of religion can boast of. Of the various dances of Shiva, I shall only speak of three, one of them alone forming the main subject of interpretation. The first is an evening dance in the Himalayas, with a divine chorus described as follows in the Shiva Pradosha Stotra: “Placing the Mother of the Three Worlds upon a golden throne, studded with precious gems, Shulapani dances on the heights of Kailasa, and all the gods gather round Him: “Saraswati plays on the Vina, Indira on the flute, Brahma holds the time-marking cymbals, Lakshmi begins a song, Vishnu plays on a drurn, and all the gods stand round about: “Gandharvas, Yakshas, Patagas, Uragas, Suddhas, Sadhyas, Vidyadharas, Amaras, Apsarasas, and all the beings dwelling in the three worlds assemble there to witness the celestial dance and hear the music of the divine choir at the hour of twilight”.This evening dance is also referred to in the invocation preceding the Katha Sarit Sagara.\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n16\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nIn the pictures of this dance, Shiva is twohanded, and the co-operation of the gods is clearly indicated in their position of chorus. There is no prostrate Asura trampled under Shiva’s feet. So far as I know, no special interpretations of this dance occur in Shaiva literature. The second well-known dance of Shiva is called Tandava and belongs to His tamasic aspect as Bhairava or Virabhadra. It is performed in cemeteries and burning grounds, where Shiva, usually ten-armed form, dances wildly with Devi, accompanied by troupes of capering imps. Representations of this dance are common amongst ancient sculptures, as at Ellora, Elephanta, and also Bhuvaneshvara. The Tandava dance is in origin that of a preAryan divinity, half-god, half-demon, who holds his midnight revels in the burning ground. In later times, this dance in the cremation ground, sometimes of Shiva, sometimes of Devi, is interpreted in Shaiva and Shakta literature in a most touching and. profound sense. Thirdly, we have the Nadanta dance of Nataraja before the assembly (sabha) in the golden hall of Chidambaram or Tillai, the Centre of the Universe, first revealed to gods and rishis after the submission of the latter in the forest of Taragam, as related to the Koyil Puranam. The legend, which has after all, no very close connection with the real meaning of the dance, may be summarised as follows: In the forest of Taragam dwelt multitudes of heretical rishis, following of the Mimamsa. Thither proceeded Shiva to confute them accompanied by Vishnu disguised as a\n\nbeautiful woman, and Adi-Shesha. The rishis were at first led to a violent dispute amongst themselves, but their anger was soon directed against Shiva, and they endeavoured to destroy Him by means of incantations. A fierce tiger was created in sacrificial fires, and rushed upon Him; but smiling gently, He seized it, and, with the nail of His little finger, stripped off its skin, and wrapped it about Himself like a silken cloth. Undiscouraged by failure, the sages renewed their offerings, and produced a monstrous serpent, which, however, Shiva seized and wreathed about His neck like a garland. Then He began to dance; but there rushed upon Him a last monster in the shape of a malignant dwarf, Muyalaka. Upon Him the god pressed the tip of His foot, and broke the creature’s back, so that it writhed upon the ground; and so, His last foe prostrate, Shiva resumed the dance witnessed by gods and rishis. Then Adi-Shesha worshipped Shiva, and prayed above all things for the boon, once more to behold this mystic dance; Shiva promised that he should behold the dance again insacred Tillai, the centre of the Universe. This dance of Shiv a in Chidambaram orTillai forms the motif of the South Indian copper images of Shri Nataraja, the Lord of the Dance. These images vary amongst themselves in minor details, but all express one fundamental conception. Before proceeding to enquire what these may be, it will be necessary to describe the image of Shri Nataraja as typically represented. The images, then, represent Shiva dancing, having four hands, with braided and jewelled hair of which the lower locks are whirling\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n17\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nin the dance. In His hair may be seen a wreathing cobra, a skull, and the mermaid figure of Ganga ; upon it rests the crescent moon and it is crowned with a wreath of Cassia leaves. In his right ear, He wears a man’s ear-ring, a woman’s in the left; He is adorned with necklaces and armlets, a jewelled belt, anklets, bracelets, finger and toe rings . The chief part of His dress consists of tightly fitting breeches, and He wears also a fluttering scarf and a sacred thread. One right hand holds a drum, the other is up- lifted in the sign of do not fear: one left hand holds fire, the other point’; down upon the demon Mryalaka, a dwarf holding cobra ; the left foot is raised, There is a lotus pedestal, from which springs an encircling glory (tiruvasi), fringed with flame, and touched within by the hands holding drum and fire. The images are of all sizes, rarely if ever exceeding four feet in total height. Even without reliance upon literary reference, the interpretation of this dance would not be difficult. Fortunately, however, we have the assistance of a\n\ncopious contemporary literature, which enables us to fully explain not only the general significance of the dance, but equally, the details of its concrete symbolism. Some of the peculiarities of the Nataraja images, of course, belong to the conception of Shiva generally, and not to the dance in particular. What is the meaning of Shiva’s Nadanta dance, as understood by Shaivas? Its essential significance is given in texts such as the following: “Our Lord is the Dancer, who, like the heat latent in firewood, diffuses His power in mind and matter, and makes them dance in their turn.” [Kadavul M a m u n i v a r ’ s Tiruvatavurar Puranam, Puttaraivatil, Venracarukkam, stanza 75, translated by Nallaswami Pillai, Shivajnanabodham, p. 74.] The dance, infact, represents His five activities (Panchakritya), viz: Srishti (overlooking, creation, evolution), Sthiti (preservation, support), Samhara (destruction, evolution), Tiro-bhava (veiling, embodiment, illusion and also giving rest), Anugraha (release, salvation, grace). These, separately considered, are the activities of the deities Brahma, Vishnu,\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n18\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nRudra, Maheshwara and Sadashiva. The cosmic activity is the central motif of the dance. Further quotations will illustrate and explain the more detailed symbolisms. Unmai Vilakkam, verse 36, tells us:\n\ndesolate. The place where the ego is destroyed signifies the state where illusion and deeds are burnt away: that is the crematorium, the burning ground where Shri Nataraja dances, and whence He is named Sudalaiyadi, Dancer of the burning-ground. In this simile, we recognise the historical connection between Shiva’s gracious dance as Nataraja, and His wild dance as the demon of the cemetery. This conception of the dance is current also amongst Shaktas, especially in Bengal, where the Mother rather than the Fatheraspect of Shiva is adored. Kali is here the dancer, for whose entrance the heart must be purified by fire, made empty by renunciation. We find in Tamil texts, the purpose of Shiva’s dance explained. In Shivajnana Siddhar, Supaksha, Sutra, V, 5, we find: “For the purpose of securing both kinds of fruit to the countless soul, our Lord, with actions, five, dances His dance”. Both kinds of fruit, that is Iham, reward in this world, and Param, bliss in Mukti. The conception of the world process as the Lord’s pastime or amusement (lila) is also prominent in the Shaiva scriptures. Thus Tirumular writes, “The perpetual dance is His play”. This spontaneity of Shiva’s dance is so clearly expressed in Skryabin’s Poem of Ecstasy. This aspect of Shiva’s immanence appears to have given rise to the objection that he dances as do those who seek to please the eyes of mortals; but it is answered that in fact He dances to maintain the life of the cosmos and to give release to those\n\n“Creation arises from the drum: protection proceeds from the hand of hope: from fire proceeds destruction: the foot held aloft gives release”. It will be observed that the fourth hand points to this lifted foot, the refuge of the soul. Shiva is a destroyer and loves the burning ground. But what does He destroy? Not merely the heavens and earth at the close of a world-cycle, but the fetters that bind each separate soul. Where and what is the burning ground? It is not the place where our earthly bodies are cremated, but the hearts of His lovers, laid waste and\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n19\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nwho seek Him. More over, if we understand even the dances of human dancers rightly, we shall see that they too lead to freedom. But it is nearer the truth to answer that the reason for His dance lies in His own nature, all His gestures are own-nature born (svabhavajah), spontaneous and purpose less for His being is beyond the realm of purposes. In a much more arbitrary way, the dance of Shiva is identified with the Panchakshara, or five syllables of the prayer Shi-va-yana-ma ‘Hail to Shiva’. In Unmai Vilakkam we are told: “If this beautiful Five-Letters be meditated upon, the soul will reach the land where there is neither light nor darkness, and there Shakti will make it One with Shivam” [Nandikeshvara, The Mirror of Gesture, translated by Coomaraswamy and Dug- girala, p .11.] The Tiru-Arul-Payan however (Ch. IX. 3) explains the tiruvasi more naturally as representing the dance of Nature contrasted with Shiva’s dance of wisdom. “The dance of nature proceeds on one side: the dance of enlightenment on the other. Fix your mind in the centre of the latter”. Now to summarize the whole interpretation we find that the essential significance of Shiva’s dance is three-fold: First, it is the image of his rhythmic playas the source of all movement within the Cosmos, which is represented by the Arch: Secondly, the purpose of His dance is to release the countless souls of men from the snare of\n\nIllusion: Thirdly, the place of the dance, Chidambaram, the Centre of the Universe, within the Heart. So far I have refrained from all aesthetic criticism and have endeavoured only to translate the central thought of the conception of Shiva’s dance from plastic to verbal expression, without reference to the beauty or imperfection of individual works. But it may not be out of place to call attention to the grandeur of this conception itself as a synthesis of science, religion and art. How amazing the range of thought and sympathy of those rishi-artists who first conceived such a type as this, affording an image of reality, a key to the complex tissue of life, a theory of nature, not merely satisfactory to a single clique or race, nor acceptable to the thinkers of one century only, but universal in its appeal to the philosopher, the lover, and the artist of all ages and all countries. How supremely great in power and grace this dancing image must appear to all those who have striven in plastic forms to give expression to their intuition of Life ! It is not strange that the figure of Nataraja has commanded the adoration of so many generations past; familiar with all scepticisms, expert in tracing all beliefs to primitive superstitions, explorers of the infinitely great and infinitely small, we are worshippers of Nataraja still.

S. RAMASWAMI SASTRI\n\nA\n\nll over the world we have crude folk dances as well as classical dance. We find the figures of dancing women in the ruins of Harappa and Mohanjo Daro. In the Rigveda, Goddess Ushas (Dawn) is described as clad in gay garments, like a dancer. God Siva as Nataraja and Goddess Uma are said to have taught respectively Tandava (the vigorous masculine type of dance) to the sage Tandu and through him to Bharata and others, and Lasya (the graceful feminine type of dance) to Bharata and others. In the Abhinaya Darpana of Nandikeswara, we find the famous verse: Angikam Bhuvanam Tasya Vaachikam Sarvaangmayah / Aahaaryam Chandrataaraadi Tam nu tvah saatvikam Shivam / /\n\nsage Bharadwaja’s ashrama (hermitage). Valmiki describes Swayamprabha’s friend Hema as Nritta Gita Visarada (Expert in dance and music). In Ravana’ s harem there were similar experts as Nritta Vaditra Kusalah (Sundara kanda, X 32). In the Mahabharata we are told that Arjuna learnt dance from the celestial maiden Uma and taught it to princess Uttara Panini (500 B.C.) refers to Natasutras. Queen Mira Bai’s devotional dances are well-known. ]ayadeva’s Gita Govinda was interpreted by the dances of his wife Padmavati. Dance went into the hands of courtesans for centuries but now it has been taken up enthusiastically by family women and is universally popular.\n\n(The world is the movement of His limbs; all speech is His Voice; the moon and the stars are His decorative ornaments. Let us pray to the good God Siva). The cosmic dance (tandava) of God Siva is of seven kinds and symbolises the Anavarata or eternal dance and the dances of creation and preservation and destruction and obscuration and grace (Panchakritya or five divine acts) and the dance of bliss (Ananda Tandava). There is also another classification as Ananda Tandava, Uma Tandava, Sivagauri Tandava, Kalika Tandava, Tripura Tandava and Samhara Tandava. In the Ramayana of Valmiki, we find the dances of the celestial apsaras, maidens in the\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n21\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nLiterature Galore Bharata’s Natya Sastra is the Bible of Indian aestheticians. It says that the Creator (Brahma) created it to give joy in life to the gods who found their cosmic functions to be heavy and dreary. Bharatarmada and Abinaya Darpana are other important classical works on the Indian art of dance. Kalidasa’s drama Malavikagnimitra throws much light on the art and show show princess Malavika was an expert in it. Vishnu Dharmothara and Agni Purana throw much light on the art. Other important Sanskrit works are Dhananjaya’s Dasa Roopaka, Sargadava’s Sangita Ratnakara, Thulajaji’s Sangita Saramitra, Bala Ramavarma’s Bala Bharata, Haripala Deva’s Sangita Sudhakara, Veda Suri’s Sangita Makaranda, Rasamanjari etc. Tamil literature is described as consisting of Iyal (poetry) and Isai (music) and Natakam or Koothu (Dance). Of the many ancient Tamil works on dance only Bharata Senapatheeyam is extant. Bharata Siddhanta, Bharata Sangraha and Mahabharata Choodamani are recent\n\nworks. In the famous Tamil epic Silappadikaram we have many great ideas relating to the art. There is a reference to eleven varieties of dance ( alliyam, Kudai, Kudam etc). It refers to 24 kinds of abhinayam, Kamba Ramayana refers to a dance hall called Adumantapa Balakanda, Nagarapadalam stanza 62). 108 Kananasor dance poses are beautifully sculptured in the gopuram at Chidambaram. There is a dance platform in front of the great temple at Tanjore. There are innumerable Tamil and Telugu and Canarese amorous and devotional songs (padams) composed for interpretation by dances. The Tamil word Nattuvangam means the art of teaching dance, and Nattuvanar means dance-teacher. Two beautiful verses in Abhinaya Darpana give us the very quintessence of the teaching as well as the learning of the Indian art of Dance. Kanthenaambayedgeetam Hastenaartham Pradarshayet / Chakshubhyaam darsayedbhauam Paadaabhyaam taalamaacharet // (Sing with the mouth and show the meaning by the gesture of the hand and reveal the emotion (bhava) by the eyes and gently beat time with the feet).\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n22\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nTato Yato Yato Tato\n\nhastastato drishtirdrishtistato manah / manastato Vaachah Vaachastato Rasah //\n\n(The eyes follow the hand, the mind follows the eyes, the bhava follows the mind, and the rasa follows the bhava). Gitaavaadyatalaanuvartini / (The dance must accompany the vocal song and the instruments). It is thus clear that the speechless eloquence of the eyes intensifies the beauty of the gestures and rouses the inner feeling (bhava) to the blossomed state of aesthetic emotional bliss (rasa). It is often said that Bharata Natyam is meant to be performed only by women. In recent times, Uday Shankar and Ramgopal and others have learnt and exhibited it. But Lasya or the graceful form of dance is more appropriate for women than for men. There is a view that it is suited to women and not to girls because Sringara bhava (the emotion of love) cannot be understood by girls. But the essence of the dance being devotion or divine love expressed in terms of human love, the charm of the dance depends on naturalness and sincerity which are clouded in adolescent and adult human beings by egoism and egotism and a desire to excel and shine. Variations in Gesture In classical aesthetic terminology, Nritta means pure dance without reference to any theme or emotion. Nritya is dance which expounds emotion by gestures. Natya adds a story element to it. Abhinaya is the interpretation of emotion by gestures\n\n(angika) , by voice (vacheka), by dress and decoration (tapery) and by physical manifestations (sattvika). Anyadbhavasrayam nrittam nirityam talarasasrayam. Gestures can be by the limbs (anga, pratyanga, and upanga). They can be shown by a single hand (asamyuta) or by both hands (samyuta). Tamilnadu is rich in the variety of folk dances as well as in the classical art of dance. The descriptions Marga and Desi refers to classical dances and regional folk dances respectively. The Kummi and Kolattam and Pinnal Kolattam dances by the girls of the Tamilnadu are danced in lovely rhythmic patterns in which songs beautify movements and movements beautify songs. They are not mere crude movements\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n23\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nof the limbs out of exuberance of animal spirits because in that case they would be dance but not art. Nor are they so elaborate and controlled by rules as Bharata Natya. The Bhajan dances of trained religious singers and dancers are midway between folk-music and folk-dance on the one hand and elaborate Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam on the other hand. On the other hand, oyilattam, chakhaiattam, kauadi dances, karagam dances, dummy horse (poikal kuthirai) dances, theru koothu (street drama) dances by hill tribes, gypsy dances etc. are folk arts pure and simple. But Bommalattam (puppet-shows) is an artistic achievement. The puppets are moved by strings tied to the limbs of the artist behind the curtain. The songs of the singers and the movements of the puppets synchronise superbly. When I was young I saw Harischandra’s story in Bommalattam. It was attended by thousands night after night and it made a profound impression on my mind. The introductory dance by the Kinchin bommai (puppet) was as lovely as a Bharata Natyam dance. What is called Pavaikoothu (puppet-dance) in ancient Tamil literature shows the antiquity of the art. In Andhra we have the Thol Bommalatta (painted leather pieces operated with bamboo sticks and seen through a semi-transparent screen lighted from behind). In the Malabar, shadow play figures are shown by perforating holes on square pieces of flat leather. Folk-Dances The Tamil literature--especially the great epic Silappadtkaram-refers to other dances such as alliyam, kudam, kodukoti, etc.\n\nThey are not now extant. It refers also to Ayar koothu (dances by shepherds), Kuravai koothu (dances by kuravans) etc. They are obsolete. But what is called kuravanji has been lifted to the highest level of art by the genius of poets. In it, a human heroine loves a king or a god and gypsy goes to her and foretells her good fortune. The Kutrala Kuravanji Sarfoji Kurauanji, Viralimalai Kurauanji and Aehagar Kuravanji are fine works of art and give room for fine ballet dances which are not mere folk-dances but are fine artistic performances. I must refer also to a new aesthetic creation viz.Chchaya Natakas (Nizhal Attam in Tamil) or shadow-plays by the great artistic geniuses Sri Uday Shankar and his wife Srimathi Amala Shankar. In them, the acting is by human beings but the public see only the shadows thrown on a gigantic screen from the other side of the screen. They have now presented the Ramayana and the Buddha Charita. Thus we have in the above dances, both pure folk dances as well as artistic dance performances in which the art element blends with the folk element. The Bhagawata Mela of Melattur and Oothukad and Soolamangalam etc. in the Tanjore District is a high-class classical dancedrama, whereas Bharata Natyam is a solodance which IS the ne plus ultra of the classical dance art of South India. Bhagawata Mela dances present various puranic themes through dances by many men who sing and dance where-as in Bharata Natya the artist does not sing while others sing. The songs in Bhagawata Meta are in Telugu as the Naik kings of\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n24\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nTanjore had it as their court language. The themes are the stories of Prahlada, Harischandra, Dhruva, Markandeya, Usha, Rukmini, Sita and others. The dancedramas combine fine poetry and elaborate Carnatic music and fine and elaborate dances. The founder of this classical dance-drama was Venkatarama Sastri of Melattoor who was a contemporary of the immortal musician Tyagaraja. Influence Abroad Finally I wish to make a passing reference to the farflung influence of Indian Art in Ceylon and Burma and Indonesia and far East Asia including Thailand (Siam) and Cambodia and also in China and Japan. In Java, Bali, Cambodia, and in Eastern Asia generally, Indian art concepts and artmotifs have had a dominant influence. Dr. A. K. Coomaraswami says: “The leading motifs of Chinese and Japanese building art of the pagoda and toru are also of Indian origin”. (The Arts and Crafts of India and Ceylon page 117). Mr. Havell says, “Indian idealism during the greater part of this time was the dominant note in the art of Asia which was thus brought into Europe; and we find a perfectly oriental atmosphere and strange echoes of eastern symbolism in the medieval cathedrals of Europe and see their structural growth gradually blossoming with all the exuberance of Eastern imagery”. We find the influence of Indian art, viz, Hindu\n\nart and Buddhist art in the temples at Angkor Vat and Prambanan and Borobodur and also particularly in the music and dance and the general cultural atmosphere in the island of Bali. In Indonesia, Indian art and the colourful beauty and glory of nature and human life and dress and decoration were blended to perfection. In Bali, the pendel, the jangar, the leyong and the kabzyar dances interpret the heroic actions of Arjuna and other heroes of Indian mythology. The pendel is a classical dance connected with temple rituals. The other dances also interpret Puranic episodes. The Ketjah or monkey dance depicts the Ramayana story. There are also dances interpreting the Buddhist and jataka stories. There are also folk dances. The gamelon orchestra, aided sometimes by vocal music, adds to the fascination of the dances. The dance gestures are of Indian origin. The dress and the decoration of the Javanese and Balinese dancers are similar to those discernible in the Ajanta frescoes. Tagore says: “In India where exuberance of life seeks utterance, it sets them to dance. One who knows their peculiar dance- language can follow the story without the help of words”. It is thus clear that the art of Dance was born and grew up in India as a spiritual art and spread all over South -East Asia and flourishes even to-day as a supreme spiritual art in the house of its birth.\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n25\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nThe Spiritual Background of Indian Dance\n\nRUKMINI DEVI\n\nne of the greatest and most ancient arts of India is the dance and as far as I know India alone has given it so high a place in both national and spiritual life. No one was too low born for this sacred art, nor anyone too great or spiritual for it. From the Sublime Being comes the inspiration and example. Therefore, everyone who is but part of Him, every living creature, is animated by that spirit of creation which is the dance. It is because the whole conception of art is cosmic and allembracing that in reality it is undying and eternal. Its expression is many, for it is like the light of the sun which sparkles on the ocean. From the oneness of that life comes the creative genius in man. Man intuits the spirit and absorbs his environment. From the harmony ofthe environment, the life, the thought, the philosophy and nature all around, with the creative spirit within, inspiration is born, and art is the expression. Environment is of tremendous importance to the actual form of art. The environment is what we call national life. If in India, the dance, as any other art, is essentially spiritual and philosophical, it is merely\n\nO\n\nbecause the sages have given a spiritual meaning to it. It is also because the very same sages have, at the same time, helped to build the nation so that there is no fundamental difference between the spiritual and the physical, nor is there a difference between the manifest and the unmanifest. This has been the uniqueness in the civilization of India. If we understand the highest, we understand the least alsofor both are one. Importance of Music From this point of view comes the dance tradition of our country. The dance is not an art by itself. It is a unique expression, through the body, synthesising all arts. In reality, though it is the nature of the body to respond to rhythm, yet it is thamasic in nature and its inertia expression, which we call dance. Therefore, the perfect harmony of the physical and emotional produces the dance. How is emotion stirred? It is flexible and quickly affected and that which stirs it most is sound. Sound as movement expresses itself in music. Music is the speech of the Highest. The first manifestation is in terms of sound, which is speech or music. All this is so\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n26\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nmagnificently conceived and presented to humanity through the form of Nataraja, the great Yogis of Yogi. In Him is synthesised all planes of consciousness and all the arts. We find that the instinct of dance is in the savage as in the cultured. When the dance becomes an art that transcends the physical, it becomes art, giving pleasure to all, to the devas as well as human beings. It is equally an art that pleases all tastes. In dance there is music for the musician, for dance is but the music of the body. It is said that when music, in terms of poetry, song and rhythm, blends with the instruments, it becomes complete music. There is music in the dance as there is dance in music. Without the spirit of music within, it is impossible to dance; for music is the expression of the highest emotion, through gesture, movement or mime. When it is perfectly expressed through gesture of hastaabhinaya, movement or angika-abhinaya and satvika-abhinaya or facial expression, the dancer becomes something beyond and unfolds another great art into herself-the art of natya or drama. Then she becomes the story-teller or the actress. To do perfect justice to the story telling or in delineating a particular character in drama, aharya-abhinaya (expression through costume) becomes part of the four-fold aspects of the dance. In Bharata Natya as danced in solo\n\nperformances, the dancer is the storyteller and aharya abhinaya or the expression of a character through beautiful costumes and jewels is elaborate but simple in one sense. The dancer has merely to prepare\n\nherself to be beautiful and pleasant and to create a personality that can make her story attractive. Her art is music in the form of dance and every emotion of every song and every character is in her. In the dance- drama where the dancer is a particular character, the art of costume is itself expressive of a rasa or an aspect of the fundamental state and no movement is expressive by itself. The truest expression is in the experience within, which is dependent on so many things-especially on the spiritual development and perception of the artist. Dance and Our Heritage Thus dance becomes an art that unifies art. The painter sees beauty of line and colour, the sculptor sees the grace and the form, the actor sees the portrayal of life, and the musician and poet alike see\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n27\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nthe very embodiment of poetry in motion. With all these blended in one who is dedicated body and soul, the dancer becomes the very expression of [ataraja Himself, of whom it is described that His Angika or the movement of His limbs is the world around, the Vachika, the poetry of His dance, is the language within all speech, the Aharya, His costume and jewelry, are the moon and the stars, while the Satvika, the true expression, is the essence of Being, Siva Himself. In Him is all united and in Him is all transcended by the divine spirit. This is the dance and this is our heritage. In this spirit we can still see true dance in India. Bharata Natya is the root and origin of all dance in India. Essentially, all real Indian dancing is Bharata Natya, though now only one particular school of art is known by the name. The most ancient authority on dance is the Natya Sastra of Bharata. In the South, there is what is known as the Tanjore School of Bharata Natya, but Kancheepuram and other cities are equally famous for the practice of the art. In every temple and on all auspicious occasions, there were dance performances. The art very nearly died as it had become a means for remembering the body rather than of forgetting it. Yet, those whom the world denounced as having become corrupt, gave themselves up with devotion and sincerity to the art they loved. The art was their very life and they worked and sacrificed their bodies for perfecting the art. Divinity in Indian Dance According to the Indian conception,\n\ncharacter and dance go together. In reality they are one and the same, for what is without is but what is within. Through the portrayal of Gods and Goddesses one becomes divine. Indian dance being spiritual, it is suited only for spiritual expression. Through bhava one portray, in story-form the lives of Gods and Goddesses The Indian genius has shown that humanity is divine and divinity is human; hence the stories of Gods and Goddesses who live and speak like humans. This was so in every part of India. There were the dance-dramas of the Bhagavatars (men-dancers) in the Tanjore district, in Kuchipudi in the Telugu districts, and Chakiar Koothu in Malabar where it still survives. Through these and through the still-living dance drama of Kathakali in Malabar, religion lived, philosophy lived and art lived. As you travel all over India we find no part of the country where ,dance did not flourish, although, except in Assam, Orissa and one or two places in the later years, dance was considered as an art of the vulgar. Yet one hears of the great Kathak dancers of the United Provinces as flourishing under the patronage of rulers and noblemen. One never hears of Kathak being performed in temples but only in courts as temples had been destroyed, and the temple lost its place as a centre of art and culture. In Assam it is a respected art and it lives as a sacred expression enjoyed by all. Though the style is different from orthodox Bharata Natya, yet in essence it is the same, giving the same age-old atmosphere, and telling the stories of Krishna, Rama and the dance as an art-form lives everywhere, in the temples, in the courts, in the fields, among the peasants and even ordinary people all\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n28\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nover India. Because we forgot our heritage, the art almost disappeared. Today there is a sudden awakening to the glory of the art, and people everywhere are thinking and speaking of the dance. Entertainments are given everywhere and new names of famous exemplars of the art are heard. Revival of the Art But if the art is to live, we have first to remember that it is an essential part of our lives. India’s real achievement depends upon her understanding of the place of art in life. To know this, one must understand India, the very heart of India herself. We cannot revive the art by forgetting India. Indians today are forgetting India. They try to express in dance, a spiritual medium, ideas totally foreign to our genius. People try to portray Rama but disbelieve in Rama! That is why in modern India, art fails for want of sincerity. We tried apparently to rescue the art from the corrupt, but because we lack devotion, dedication and sincerity, we are gradually corrupting art itself. There is a general lowering of standards and the decline has been so fast that one dreads what is in store for the future. Will the dance have to go through another death before it regains its own glory? As dance is part of life itself, the nation and its consciousness will have to go through a revolutionary change in character. Indian arts have been slowly deteriorating because crudities have crept in. The sense\n\nof colour has almost vanished, equally the sense of form and line. The ordinary dramas portraying religious stories like the Ramayana and Mahabharata were crude and childish in presentation, though sincere in spirit. Today sophisticated vulgarity has taken the place of simple crudeness. Which is preferable, the crudeness of the ignorant or the vulgarity of the\n\nsophisticated? The latter has no compensations and is subtle and dangerous while the former had at least its merits. Hard work was its feature, inspiration its source, and devotion its aim. Today, there\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n29\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nis dance without hard work. People want either diplomas or headlines. It is easy to have both because we do not have today, trained audiences, including art critics and the public will take one at one’s own valuation. If that valuation is high as it is bound to be in the mind of the ignorant, the “fame” achieved is indeed great. It was said by Kathakali teachers of the old type that it took 12 years of hard training before a dancer could even take a minor part on the stage. In Bharata Natya it took no less than seven or eight years of hard work. Today, even twelve months is too long. Owing to the lack of devotion, there is lack of discipline and, as a consequence, there is a deficiency in technique. The result is that there is no inspiration. To make up for this, false stimulation from outside is resorted to, instead of true stimulation from within. This naturally kills the creative spirit and, therefore, there has to be copying from others, and perhaps also borrowing from foreign countries. True art never copies. It is like a well of deep cool waters from which flows fresh ideas and life. India understood the dance as joy which is why Nataraja’s dance is called Ananda- Tandava. This joy is that of a Yogi. What sort of a Yogi? One who has forgotten his body. The forgetfulness is not due to negligence but due to control. After training the body, one forgets it. This is the technique of “art which conceals\n\nart”. This is why the dance is called a Yoga. People think that technique is the antithesis of creative expression. This is a wrong notion, since the creative spirit is but the achievement of a technique by which the technique itself vanishes, and uniqueness is the result. This final out- come is the supreme joy of creation. Even in folk art there is the expression of joy. Every part of India has its folk art, solo or group dramas, and dance-dramas. Each type expressed the uniqueness of the life and thought around, all different from each other like the Garba and the Rasa Lila of Gujarat, the Kaikottikali and Kolkali of Malabar, Kummi and Kolattam of the Tamil country, the village dances of Assam, Orissa and other places. For groups of every level of thought there is the dance from the lowest to the highest, from the child to the adult, filling the country with music and movement. When Indians realise what is Indian in essence, art will regain its original height and the dance will return to the people in all its pristine purity. Dance is being revived but if this revival is to continue, we must know the spiritual message of art and make art a part of our lives. Then our very lives will become works of art and India will become a Land of Beauty; a fit vehicle for the message of the Sages and Saviour of humanity.\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n30\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nThe Renaissance of Indian Dance MOHAN KHOKAR and its Consequences\n\nD\n\nuring the last two centuries or so, the art of dance in India was not held in much respect,due to certain norms of prudery which were introduced into India by the alien rulers. For most people in India as well as outside, Indian dancing was associated exclusively with what was performed by the Devadasis and Nautch-girls, and as a result of the social stigma attached to these women, dancing in India came to be looked upon as a vain and vulgar pursuit. This state of affairs continued well into the first quarter of this century, till the setting in of the Renaissance of Indian dance, but after this the art of dance in India rapidly came into its own and since then it has not only retrieved much of its lost prestige and glory but also made marked progress. The revival of the dance in India began a little over three decades ago, and important pioneering work in this direction was done by Uday Shankar, Rukmini Devi Arundale, E. Krishna Iyer, Menaka, Rabindranath Tagore and Mahakavi Vallathol. However, it deserves to be noted that before the revival proper began in India certain dancers in the West became interested in Indian dance and they endeavoured to present, to whatever, extent it was possible for them, dances and ballets based on Indian themes. In fact it can be said that it is these early attempts to produce Indian dances and Indian ballets in the\n\nWest that paved the way for the revival of the dance in India. Western Interest in Indian Dance The first dancer in the West to perform Indian dance was the American ballerina Ruth St. Denis. From her early years Ruth St. Denis was much interested in the Orient and this led her, in 1904, to compose and present her first Indian dance, which she called Radha. This proved a great success, which prompted Ruth St. Denis to take Radha to Europe where she toured for three years before returning to\n\nAmerica. Ruth St. Denis continued to take great interest in Indian dance and during the next ten years or so she composed and performed several Indian dances in America, such as The Cobras, The Incense, The Nautcli and The Yogi. In 1925 Ruth St. Denis and her husband, dancer Ted Shawn, visited India, and after their return\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n31\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nto America Ted Shawn presented The Dance of Shioa, a solo number which he performed, with great success, for several years. It is to be noted that the dances presented by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn were not in any authentic Indian technique but in their own improvised Indian style. However, the importance of these dances lies in the fact that they were able to create interest for Indian dance in America and Europe, and this interest, in due course, led to the revival of the dance in India. After Ruth St. Denis, another Western dancer, the great Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova took an interest in composing and performing Indian dance. She undertook an extensive world tour which lasted several years, and she visited India in 1922 but was thoroughly disappointed as she could not find any trace of the great art of dance in India of which she had heard so much. However when she returned to Europe she carried impressions of India with her and in 1923 she composed and presented two short Indian ballets, A Hindu Wedding and Krishna and Radha. For composing these ballets she took the help of Uday Shankar, who was then a student of painting in London, and Shankar also partnered Pavlova in Krishna and Radha. In 1928 Pavlova visited India again, and on this occasion she performed her Indian ballets in parts of India. This proved to be very helpful in creating interest for dance in India, and the seeds of the Renaissance can be said to have been sown at this time. After this Shankar played a leading part in the revival of Indian dance, and he was soon followed by two others, Rukmini\n\nDevi and Menaka who, too, were inspired and initiated into the dance by Pavlova and were destined to make positive contributions in the field. Apart from Ruth St. Denis and Anna Pavlova there are two other Western dancers who played an important part in the revival of Indian dance. They are La Meri and Ragini Devi, both Americans. Like Ruth St. Denis, La Meri was interested in the dances of the Orient from an early age, and this led her, in 1936, to visit India, to study Indian dance. She learnt Bharata Natya under Papanasam Vadivelu Pillai and Mylapore Gowri and Kathak from Ram Dutt Misra. And even as Pavlova discovered Uday Shankar and introduced the world of dance to him, to La Meri goes the credit of discovering Ram Gopal and introducing him to the world of dance. As for Ragini Devi, she was the first Western dancer to come to India to study Indian dance in a fairly serious manner and she was also the first to carry the Kathakali dance outside Kerala and to present it in other parts of India, which she did in 1932, with Gopinath as her partner. Thus, it is evident that Western dancers like Ruth St. Denis, Anna Pavlova, La Meri and Ragini Devi became interested in Indian dance before Indians themselves did, and this in many ways paved the way for the revival proper of the dance in India. Uday Shankar left the Pavlova company, stayed in Europe a few more years dancing and gaining valuable experience, and then came to India to become the torch-bearer of the Revival movement. In 1930, Uday Shankar took a party of dancers and for eight years he toured Europe and America.\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n32\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nThis was the first time that Indian dance with authentic Indian music and costumes was carried outside India, and wherever he went Shankar won respect for himself as well as for Indian dance. In 1938, Shankar returned to India and soon afterwards he founded a school of Indian dance, known as India Culture Centre, at Almora. This Centre was established largely with financial help received from Shankar’s admirers in Europe and America, and here, apart from providing training in Shankar’s own style of ‘Creative Dance’, classical dances like Bharata Natya and Kathakali were also taught and for this there were great masters like Sankaran Nambudiri and Kandappa Pillai. Having made a successful beginning, the Dance Renaissance in India soon spread to several parts of the country, with the result that the major forms of Indian classical dance began to get it rehabilitated. In the South, Mahakavi Vallathol founded the Kerala Kala Mandalam for teaching Kathakali and Mohini Attam, and it is no exaggeration to say that even today most of the Kathakali and Mohini Attam dancers who matter have sometime or other been associated with this institution. About the same time Rukmini Devi and E. Krishna Iyer rescued Bharata Natya from the depravity it had fallen into and, by themselves setting examples, gave the art a new respectable status. Rukmini Devi augmented her contribution by establishing Kalakshetra, a school for teaching Bharata Natya and Kathakali. In the North, Menaka gave a new life to Kathak by being the first woman of respect and learning to take this part from the Nautch-girls and to perform it\n\nprofessionally. As early as 1936, Menaka even took a company of Kathak dancers to Europe and her performances at the International Dance Olympiad in Berlin won her three of the highest awards which, understandably, immediately raised the status of Indian dance in the West as well as in India. And, finally, Gurudev Tagore contributed his share to the Renaissance by introducing Manipuri dance as a subject of study in Santiniketan. Apart from bringing about a general rehabilitation of the major forms of classical dance in India, the Renaissance also helped the emergence of the art of ballet in India. Ballet, it must be pointed out, is an art which is new to India, for though dances and dance-dramas and operas of sorts have existed in India since long, there is no tradition of ballet, according to the Western concept, in India. In ballet there is a story or theme, there is choreography, decor and music but the music is purely orchestral and no songs are allowed. Uday Shankar’s Contribution Ballet was introduced into India by Uday Shankar, and he learnt the technique and the presentation methods of this art through his association with Anna Pavlova and his long stay in Europe. Shankar’s early ballets, such as Tandava Nritya and Shiva-Parvati Nritya Dwandva, were rather simple and were composed largely in Shankar’s own style of dance. In this style, the bulk of the movements and steps were original, but Shankar also incorporated traces of certain classical and folk-dances\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n33\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nof India and of dance forms he saw in Europe. Later, when Sankar made an extended stay at Dartington Hall, England, he came under the influence of the German dancer Kurt Jooss, who is an upholder of the Free Expression Dance movement in the West, and this goaded Shankar to produce ballets like Rhythm of Life, Labour and Machinery. Many years afterwards Shankar took another step forward when he used the South-East Asian technique of shadow-plays and produced” two ballets, Ram Leela and Buddha. Other Developments Shankar’s example was soon followed by several other dancers in India. One of the first to do so was Menaka, who broke ground by producing four Indian ballets, Krishna Leela, Deva Vijaya, Malavikagnimitra and Menaka Lasyam. It should be pointed out, however, that these ballets were not composed in the creative dance style of Shankar but in the Kathak technique. Later, a number of other dancers followed the lead given by Menaka and began to produce ballets using classical modes of Indian dance. The work of Rukrmni Devi, Mrinalini Sarabhai and Gopinath is particularly important in this connection. They have produced a good number of ballets using Bharata Natya or Kathakali or, in some cases, both together. The creative dance style evolved by Uday Shankar was further developed when he established the India Culture Centre, at Almora. This school produced a large number of talented dancers, many of whom later contributed a good deal to the development and spread of ballet in India.\n\nSome of those, all of Shankar’s school, whose contribution in this direction has been truly outstanding are Zohra Segal, Narendra Sharma, Devendra Shankar, Sachin Shankar and Shanti Bardhan. Bardhan, who is unfortunately no more, made a noteworthy contribution by producing a ballet Ramayana in which he used an original technique wherein the dancers move and act like wooden puppets. It should also be mentioned that the art of ballet in India received a tremendous fillip from the forties onwards when, as an outcome of the national upsurge, a number of important ballet and theatre organisations came into existence, such as the Indian People’s Theatre Association, Indian National Theatre and India Renaissance Artists. Indeed, some of the early ballets produced by these organisations, such as The Spirit of India, India Immortal, The Discovery of India and Rhythm of Culture, are still regarded as classics in the field. The Role of Tagore Rabindranath Tagore, for his part, did much to help the revival of dance and the spread of ballet in India. Using Manipuri as the basis he evolved an individual technique, which came to be known as the Santiniketan style of dance, and in this he composed and presented many dances and dance-dramas, the themes of all of which were taken from his own songs and plays. With these productions, Tagore toured several parts of India and these presentations no doubt added to the dignity of Indian dance and also helped draw students from all over India to Santiniketan who, later, were instrumental in carrying\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n34\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nthe Santiniketan style to practically all parts of the country. Consequences of the Renaissance The Renaissance of Indian dance began rather abruptly, but it has moved fast and has now achieved what by any standard are imposing dimensions. This has helped the resuscitation of the art of Indian dance as a whole, and all forms of Indian danceclassical, folk and tribal-have benefited. In fact, through the rendering of timely succour, many traditional dances and dance-dramas have been saved from completely sinking into oblivion. Such was the state of neglect in which they existed on the eve of the Renaissance. Another major consequence of the revival has been that a member of traditional dances and dance-dramas have been carried from the temple to the stage, and this is something which would have seemed impossible even two decades ago. Such was the sanctity attached to these arts. for instance, one can see the Kuchipudi, Bhagavata Mela, Kuravanji and Krishnattam on the stage; yet only a few years ago, so orthodox were the regulations connected with the staging of these dance plays that performances were allowed only in certain temples and only at specified times in the year. Folkdances and tribal-dances, too, have earned a new lease of and this has received its greatest fillip from Folk-Dance festivals which for some years have become an important feature of Republic Day celebrations at Delhi. In recent years similar\n\nfestivals have also been organised in several other regions of India, and these have helped not only to unearth hidden and dormant forms but also create wider interest in folk and tribal dances of all parts of India. The cinema, which is a product of the modern age, has also been affected by the Renaissance of Indian dance, for the dance has come to be one of the most important ingredients to ensure the success of a film. In the early days of the film in India, dancing was occasionally included to provide diversion and the technique used was a version of the decadent Nautch, but in recent years classical dance-forms like Bharata Natya and Kathak have been successfully used in Indian films. On the whole, however, it can be said that it is rare that one sees pure and good dance in an Indian film, for what is generally presented is an adulteration or hybridisation of various Indian dance techniques, and more recently, there has also been a tendency to incorporate and ape dances and rhythms of the West in Indian films. All in all, the three decades or so following the Renaissance have been very eventful in the history of Indian dance. And, though in the more recent years one has seen, to some extent, a lowering of standards brought about mainly by unscrupulous charlatans and dabblers in the art, one is at the same time happy to find the art of dance gain a new and more honoured place in popular esteem and also the emergence of Indian dance as an art with an international status.\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n35\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nTHE ART OF DANCE\n\nDR. C. P. RAMASWAMI IYER\n\n... Throughout the world’s chronicles, the dance as embodying rhythmic movement, designed to express individual or group emotions, has been identified both with sacred and secular activities. It is another aspect of the practice of those Aranar and Mudrar with which the yogi seeks to conquer his physical as well as his psychic selves and make of them his servants, not his masters. As early as the Vedas, it was laid down, for instance, that in connection with the great Aswamedha and other sacrifices or Yajnas performed for the good of the country, there should be enacted some specified sacred dance. The Yajurveda and the Brahmanas, as a matter of fact, speak of the Maha- Vrata dance and a special and elaborate performance in connection with the Stotra after the Rajasuya and other Yajnas. The art of dance amongst us has been largely synonymous with and has been the attendant of many religious and symbolic ceremonies. Which of us but has been thrilled by the sight of that memorableembodiment of Nataraja, one of the greatest evocations of Indian genius? Inside yonder hall, you will find such an image of Nataraja, the Lord of the Cosmic Dance, whose performance is a symbol and a typification of that involution that takes place after each Pralaya is over, when order is to be restored after chaos. It is in that sense that the Vedas, the Avesta and the Bible alike speak of Logos, the word or\n\nNada, the sound, as the origin of the worlds. This sound is the sound of the drum that Nataraja holds aloft. In order that we may realise the full significance of that dance, not merely from the artistic point of view but from the cosmic, we should picture to ourselves the idea of motion, ceaseless and quick beyond seeming or imagination, motion akin to the speed of the stars, but nevertheless accompanied by the steadiness and poise of the manifested Divine, a dance to match the musicof the spheres, a dance of the greatEnergiser trampling on the forces of evil and calling on all created beings, by the sound of the drum, to burn their sins, and deficiencies in the fire that is held aloft, and to achieve the summum bonum of their existence. This is part of the spiritual and compelling significance of that dance. But rather than dilate any further on this topic in our poor language, may I be allowed to refer to what a great Tamil singer hymned many centuries ago, addressing the image of Sri Nataraja at Chidambaram? Very loosely translated, the meaning of the passage is as follows;- “Oh, Lord of the eternal cosmic dance, what in relation to you does not dance and throb to the tune of the Infinite? Your matted and tawny locks are dancing in rhythm. Your features, like unto the mellow orb of night, dance. Your piercing and wide eyes dance. The rays of the moon streaming from thy locks vibrate in unison. The drum that you hold in your\n\nVIVEKANANDA KENDRA PATRIKA\n\n36\n\nDANCES OF INDIA\n\nhands calls to the Universe and accompanies the music of the spheres, the circumambient Nada. The skin of the tiger, slain as the spirit of evil, that you wear on your dancing frame, quivers, Your hand held in benediction moves and dances in harmony.

Tamil is the language of Bhakti, as Sanskrit is the instrument for expressing lofty speculation, acute analysis and philosophy. The same idea is conveyed in a famous Sanskrit sloka which I thus translate; uddhrtyedam vimukter-ayanam itikarat darsayan pratyayartham bibhrad-vahnim sabhayam kalayati natanam yah sa payan-natesah. “Lord Natesa’s uplifted hand points the way to salvation; He holds the fire which destroys the evils of the world; in the dance hall of the Infinite He performs the sacred and eternal dance. Let Him protect us.” Such is the beginning of the art. The religious dance was not peculiar to India. Egypt had it; Assyria had it; Palestine had it. The Old Testament speaks of flute and tabor and drum, and of the maidens dancing before Samuel and Saul. King Solomon has referred often times to the practice of this art. China and Japan have developed this art mainly on the secular side, with great minuteness and artistic skill, and the play of the fan has been a well-known accompaniment. Throughout the ages, therefore, the dance has had a great part to play. But so far as India is concerned, its manifestations are well-known and familiar. The dance of Nataraja, the dance of Ganesha, the dance of Subrahmanya (after the conquest over Sura Padmasura), the dance of Krishna in two aspects-the Kaliyamardana and the Rasamandala, the fierce and the delicate-the dance of Kali,\n\nstatic dance.
