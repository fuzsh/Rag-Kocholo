The two inseparable couple end unfortunately in an internment camp (Manik Farm) located in Vavuniya (Sri Lanka) where hundreds of thousands tamils are imprisoned by the Sri Lankan government. These two mice witness the tragedy of many innocent civilians behind the barbed wires, which remains as unspoken truth. There is no one to witness the inside crimes and even not anyone to carry out the painful stories except from these two souls. Whether the two will escape from the terrifying environment is the climax of this short film.",
