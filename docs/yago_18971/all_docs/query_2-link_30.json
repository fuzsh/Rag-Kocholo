        "text": "MesoNet is a comprehensive Python toolbox for automated registration and segmentation of mesoscale mouse brain images. You can use it to:\n\nAutomatically identify cortical landmarks\n\nRegister a brain atlas to your mesoscale calcium activity data (or vice versa)\n\nSegment brain data based on a brain atlas\n\nUse one of our machine learning models (or train your own) to segment brain regions without using any landmarks!\n\nRead the MesoNet article in Nature Communications.\n\nWe developed atlas-to-brain and brain-to-atlas approaches to make the software flexible, easy to use and robust.\n\nWe offer an easy to use GUI, as well as a powerful command line interface (CLI) allowing you to integrate the toolbox with your own neural imaging workflow.\n\nWe also extend our pipeline to make use of functional sensory maps and spontaneous cortical activity motifs.\n\nWe provided six end-to-end automated pipelines to allow users to quickly output results from input images.\n\nMesoNet is built primarily on the U-net machine learning model (Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox, 2015), as adapted in zhixuhao's unet repository, as well as DeepLabCut, keras, and opencv.\n\nFor DeepLabCut functionality (necessary for identifying brain atlas landmarks!), install and set up a DeepLabCut environment. We recommend using their supplied Anaconda environments.\n\nActivate the DeepLabCut environment (as described above, usually activate DEEPLABCUT on Windows, source activate DEEPLABCUT on Linux, or source activate DEEPLABCUT-M1 on Mac with silicon chips.\n\nClone this git repository: git clone https://github.com/bf777/MesoNet.git\n\nNOTE: If you are on Windows, please clone the repository to a location on C:// as the git repository search function does not currently support other drives.\n\nEnter the git repository folder using cd mesonet, then run pip install . to install additional dependencies for MesoNet (installation via pip coming soon!)\n\nRun bash get_default_models.sh to download pre-trained DeepLabCut, U-Net, and VoxelMorph models from OSF for use on your data.\n\nFollow our tutorial on the wiki.\n\nMesoNet has been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 10, macOS 13 (Ventura) with Apple silicon, Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 and Arch 5.7); it should also work on older versions of Windows and on macOS, but these platforms have not been tested. It works with or without a GPU, but a GPU is strongly recommended for faster training and processing. MesoNet can be used with or without a GUI, and can be run on headless platforms such as Google Colab.\n\nDongsheng Xiao designed the processing pipeline, collected data, trained the DeepLabCut, U-Net and VoxelMorph models provided with MesoNet, and developed the brain atlas alignment approach. Brandon Forys wrote the code of GUI and CLI. They are in the Murphy Lab in UBCâ€™s Department of Psychiatry.\n\nIf you use our software, please cite the original research article:\n\nXiao, D., Forys, B.J., Vanni, M.P. et al.
