        "text": "This Yajurveda learned by Yajnavlkya as a horse from the Sun God is called SuklaYajurveda and the earlier one that was learned from Vaismpayana was Krishna Yajurveda.\n\nTHIS FAKE STORY IS POISON INJECTED BY THE WHITE INVADER , AS LORD VISHNU HAD NOT YET ASSUNED HIS KRISHNA AVATAR .\n\nThey have injected poison in many ways — when Yajnavalkya vomited out his knowledge , other disciples ate the vomit like absorbed it like Tittiri birds and hence the branch that came from those disciples is called Tittiriya sakha. .\n\nThe white historian wrote that Adi shankaracharya ( actually born 4000 years ago—but kicked forward in time by 2800 years ) followed the Taittiriya Shakha.\n\nALL BULL..\n\nThe Yajurveda has been split into white and black and the shattered into splinters again – and different parts of India follow different systems—all part of a GRAND DIVIDE AND RULE.\n\nFor example the Krishna ( black ) Yajurveda has many parts followed by various parts of India. The FAKE mutts have assisted in this.\n\nExample?- There are four recensions of the Krishna Yajurveda:\n\nTaittiriya saṃhita– originally of Panchala\n\nMaitrayani saṃhita- originally of the area south of Kurukshetra\n\nCaraka-Kaṭha saṃhita — originally of Madra and Kurukshetra\n\nKapiṣṭhala-Kaṭha saṃhita– of the southern Punjab and Bahika\n\nThe white invader gave bull that Lord Rama’s clan follows the Shukla Yajurveda branch—to DRIVE A WEDGE between Krishna/ Rama followers..\n\nThe Vajasaneyi Samhita ( Shulka Yajurveda –white ) has forty chapters or adhyayas, containing the formulas used with the following rituals:\n\n1.-2.: New and Full Moon sacrifices\n\n3.: Agnihotra\n\n4.-8.: Somayajna\n\n9.-10.: Vajapeya and Rajasuya, two modifications of the Soma sacrifice\n\n11.-18.: construction of altars and hearths, especially the Agnicayana\n\n19.-21.: Sautramani, a ritual originally counteracting the effects of excessive Soma-drinking\n\n22.-25.: Ashvamedha ( poison injected with queens having sex with a dead horse’s phallus )\n\n26.-29.: supplementary formulas for various rituals\n\n30.-31.: Purushamedha\n\n32.-34.: Sarvamedha\n\n35.: Pitriyajna\n\n36.-39.: Pravargya\n\n40.: the final adhyaya is the famous Isha Upanishad.\n\nThe Shukla Yajurveda has two branches: Vajasaneyi Madhyandiniya & Vajasaneyi Kanva.\n\nVajasaneyi Madhyandiniya is originally of Mithila and Vajasaneyi Kanva is of originally Kosala.\n\nSri Shukla Yajur Veda originally had 15 Sakhas out of which only two Sakhas or branches, called Madyandina and Kanva Sakhas are available at present .\n\nThe Vedic rituals of the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam, the second biggest temple in India, are performed according to the Kanva shakha ( Shulka ) .\n\nMadyandina Saha was used by the north India fake mutts while Kanva Sakha is used in South India’s FAKE mutts. Today even Zakir Naik quotes from Yajur Veda to ridicule Hindus.\n\nAdi Shankaracharya had taken the original YAJUR VEDA from the Kerala namboodiris and deposited it in the librarby of the original Sringeri Mutt 4000 years ago–.\n\nThe North India ( white ) versus South India ( black ) divide by an immoral DIVIDE introduced by the white invader.\n\nThey even made Yagnavalkya , an avatar of Vishnu.\n\nSo what are the splinter groups?\n\nMadhyandina Yajurveda: for North India- Pakistan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat , Maharashtra ,, West Bengal, Assam, Nepal. This branch includes Madhyandina Samhita, Madhyandina Shatapatha Brahmana, Ishavasya Upanishad and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.\n\nKanva Yajurveda: for Nepal, HP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh. Orissa party has a different text.\n\nCharaka Yajurveda: for Maharashtra, adjacent parts of Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh. They now follow Maitrayani YV shakha, as the white invader took texts away .\n\nMaitrayani Yajurveda: for Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan\n\nKathaka Yajurveda: Kashmir, Punjab and HP\n\nCharayaniya Katha Yajurveda: for Kashmir.\n\nKapisthala Katha Yajurveda: for Punjab and, Gujarat.\n\nJabala Yajurveda: Maharashra and Gujarat\n\nTaittiriya Yajurveda: South India . The Taittiriyas are splintered into numerous sub-schools.\n\nBaudhayana and Apastamba were found all over South India , Hiranyakeshins in Konkan and Western Maharashtra. The Vaikhanasas around Tirupati and Chennai. The Vadhulas in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The Agniveshyas, in Kerala and Tamil Nadu\n\nKauthuma Shukla Yajurveda: Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu , Kerala, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal (tradition has been revived recently).\n\nRanayaniya Shukla Yajurveda: Orissa, Maharashtra, Karnataka ,Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.\n\nJaiminiya/Talavakara Shukla Yajurveda: Kerala and Tamil Nadu Brahmins.\n\nShatyayaniya Shukla Yajurveda: Tamil Nadu.\n\nGautama Shukla Yajurveda: Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nBhallavi Shukla Yajurveda: Karnataka.\n\nOther Shakhas of Yajurveda: A text called ‘Yajurvedavriksha’ gives the geographical distribution of more than 100 Shakhas of Yajurveda.\n\nTHE FAKE MUTTS OF ROTHSCHILD HAD A MERRY TIME.\n\nThe white invader even introduces different pronounciations – for example the North Indian Brahmins pronounce the syllable ष as ख.\n\nThe white invader introduces difference in TIME. The Shukla Yajurvedis are classified into two groups called the Madhyandins and the Kanavas. These IDIOTS perform Sandhya Vandana at noon.\n\nWell, I am getting cynical and this is NO good.\n\nGenerally the Krishna Yajurveda includes the Brahmana prose discussions mixed within the Samhita, while the Shukla Yajurveda has separately a Brahmana text, the Shatapatha Brahmana.\n\nShukla Yajurveda is also known as Vajasaneya Yajurveda, because it was evolved in great rapidity by Sun who was in the form of a horse through his manes .The rhythm of recital of these vedas is set to the rhythm of the horse gallop .\n\nIn Sanskrit, term “Vaji” means horse. Yajnavalkya divided s Vajasaneya Yajurveda again into fifteen branches, each branch comprising hundreds of Yajus Mantras.\n\nAccording to the Mahabhasya of Patanjali, there were 21 shakhas of Rigveda, 9 of Atharvaveda, 101 of Yajurveda , and 1000 varieties of chanting of Samaveda.\n\nOnly 20 or so Shakhas of the Vedas are extant now, we do possess names of most of the lost Shakhas of the Rigveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.\n\nFragments of many of the lost shakhas are also available as quotations in ancient works. For the Samaveda, we do not have more than 40 names extant.\n\nImagine the damage done by the VULGAR white invader to Hinduism.\n\nThe immoral white invader did NOT even leave the 6000 year old Ayurvedic text Charaka Samhita UN sodomised. He INJECTED POISON over brandy and cigars , that Ayurveda prescribes BEEF as a medicine for various diseases. And the LARD of the beef is prescribed for debility and rheumatism.\n\nTEE HEEEEE !\n\nHey, I have just sprouted long ears !!\n\nThe white invaded tom tommed that Buddha rejected animal sacrifice when none existed. Buddha criticized Ashwamedha horse sacrifice as a bad practice.\n\nWell sorry to tell Buddha and his white invader sponsors this —\n\nASHWAMEDHA SACRIFICE DID NOT INVOLVE BLOOD.\n\nIT WAS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE WHERE A WHITE HORSE SET FREE BY THE EMPEROR RAN AROUND HIS OWN KINGDOM AND NEIGHBOURING KINGDOMS .\n\nIF THIS HORSE WAS NOT CAPTURED, THEN THE SOLDIERS WENT HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES FOR LOMG LASTING PEACE .\n\nIN FACT THE FAKE LUV/KUSH TWIN SONS OF LORD RAMA CAPTURES THE HORSE CHALLENGING THEIR FATHERS AUTHORITY.\n\nAsura King Mahabali of Kerala did the Ashwamedha yagam and made the devas terribly nervous .\n\nBelow: The richest and most beautiful nation on this planet KERALA was never captured by foreign forces due to the Kalari martial arts tradition . The French branch of Rothschild gave rockets and long range cannons to Tipu Sultan to blast the Kerala temple vaults ( gold ) , and for the first time Kerala came under alien rule . Today the Italian waitress and hey chamcha Salman Khurshid are trying to establish that “freedom fighter” Tipu Sultan invented rockets (sic !).\n\nAnd all these stories of Hindu kings like FAKE Ashoka getting disillusioned with BAAAD BAAAD Hindusim ( due to human / animal sacrifices ) and converting to GOODIE GOOOD Buddhism are cooked up stories by the immoral white invader over brandy and cigars.\n\nAshoka never existed.\n\nPunch into Google search –\n\nCHANAKYA , THE TAXILA UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR WHO BECAME A KINGMAKER VADAKAYIL\n\nThe white man tom tommed that Adi Shankaracharya prevented Hindus from converting to Buddhism by reviving Hinduism.\n\nSorry, Adi Shankaracharya was born in 2000 BC , before Buddha.\n\nIslamic historians have documented that Babur, the first Mughal emperor, in his will to his son Humayun, advised him to respect the cow and avoid cow slaughter if he wished to rule peacefully.\n\nThe white invader has managed to sustain animal sacrifice ( caru ) in Bali . Dutch East India Company established themselves in Bali in 1602.\n\nToday single Western women love to go to Bali ( alone ) to have sex with ‘Kuta Cowboys’, gigolos. Bali is also a head office for white pedophiles from all over the world.\n\nIn 19 February 2013, government officials announced measures to combat pedophilia in Bali.\n\nThese displaced pedophiles are now afforded VISA ON ARRIVAL by the Narendra Modi Govt — a darling govt of the Zionists.\n\nIf BRICS has to break down it will be India under Narendra Modi who will break it down.\n\nThe white invader let his imagination run riot. He even arranges an annual sacrificial slaughter of up to –hold your breath- turtles in Bengal. The Bengal universities has all R stooge vice chancellors who allowed animal sacrifice in university campuses on Mahanavami after the morning puja . If they do NOT comply they stood to lose their cushy jobs.\n\nIn Jewish ritual, every Kosher sacrifice required sanctification (ḥakdashah), and was to be brought into the court of the sanctuary (haḳrabah). The animal cannot have a blemish or broken bones. The four stages of Jewish sacrifice slaughter (sheḥiṭah), receiving the blood (ḳabbalah) carrying the blood to the alter (holakah) sprinkling the blood (zeriḳah).\n\nThese are the guys who show FAKE horror to the non-existent animal sacrifices in Vedic literature.\n\nRaja Ram Mohan Roy was an Opium drug runner , who did massive damage to Hinduism.\n\nPunch int Google search –\n\nTHE OPIUM RAJA , BRITISH STOOGE , RAM MOHAN ROY VADAKAYIL\n\nLet a white tourist ask any Hindu to respond spontaneously to this question: What are the two most holy things in your religion?\n\nChances are the first two responses will be the holy Vedas written down in 5000 BC and the HUMPED vedic cow.\n\nWe have been cheated off our HUMPED vedic cow which gave nutritious A2 milk. The switch was made by Kerala Syrian Jew nay Christian Verghese Kurian from my hometown Calicut. Kurian is the darling of your BENAMI main stream media – they call him the father of the WHITE REVOLUTION .\n\nToday we Indians get only toxic A1 milk of HUMPLESS cows .\n\nThe white men now drinks A2 milk of our HUMPED Vedic cows .\n\nOur PM Narendra Modi cant stop singing the praises of his GUJJU Amul milk factory and his GUJJU milk marketing federation which churns out only TOXIC A1 milk of western HUMPLESS cow .\n\nModi saab you are now the PM of India – NOT the CM of Gujarat . High time to leave GUJJU stuff behind .\n\nPunch into Google search –\n\nNUTRITIOUS A2 MILK OF VEDIC COWS WITH HUMP VERSUS TOXIC A1 MILK OF HUMPLESS WESTERN COWS VADAKAYIL\n\nThe urine of HUMPED vedic cow can prevent and cure lots of diseases . This is why we Indians hold the vedic HUMPED cow as holy .\n\nPunch into Google search –\n\nGOMUTRA , DRINKING COW’S URINE AS AN ELIXIR VADAKAYIL\n\nWe Indians are NOT stupid to kill our cows .\n\nEver since we started using western artificial chemical laden fertilisers , our lakes and water bodies have started dying.\n\nPunch into Google search –\n\nVANISHING LAKES , RAIN WATER HARVESTING , RECHARGING GROUND WATER AQUIFERS VADAKAYIL\n\nThe immoral white invader painted Manu as an EVIL man to drive fissures into Hinduism, to DIVIDE AND RULE .\n\nThe white man poison injected Manu Smriti.\n\nHere is a small example – Ch 5 which deals with food.\n\n“To perform sacrifices Brahmins may kill sanctioned animals and birds, as also to feed their dependants … for at the ancient sacrifices of seers and the Soma offerings … the sacrificial cakes were prepared with the meat of permitted animals and birds.” (5.22-23)\n\n´He may eat meat when it is sacrificially consecrated, at the behest of Brahmins, when he is ritually commissioned according to rule…(5.27).\n\n´There is no fault in eating meat … that is the natural activity of creatures. (5.56).\n\nALL FOUL LIES !\n\nMANU WAS A NOBLE MAHARISHI INCAPABLE OF BEING A BIGOT .\n\nManu Smriti is one of the foremost documents on Hindu dharma.\n\nThe white Christian invader injected poison into this noble and graceful document, for immoral purposes of “divide and rule” and conversions of disgruntled Hindu low castes into Christianity.\n\nThey injected falsehoods that Manu wrote that Shudras ( low caste dalits ) are made from the feet of god, while brahmins ( upper caste ) have been made from the head, the Kshatriyas ( warriors ) from the arms and vaishyas ( skilled labour and traders ) from the thighs.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous things were injected by the vulgar white man with the help of stooges like BR Ambedkar and EVR Periyar– like –\n\n” If a shudra listens to the Vedas molten lead should be poured into his ears “ .\n\nHey you white CHOOTS – why not molten copper up his a$$hole.\n\nWhy this partiality to lead ?\n\nPray?\n\nPrithee ?\n\nTEEE HEEEEE !!!\n\nSwami Vivekananda gave in to the white man and announced in writing that ancient Hindus used to eat meat.\n\nHe wrote:-\n\n“You will be astonished if I tell you that, according to the old ceremonials, he is not a good Hindu who does not eat beef. On certain occasions he must sacrifice a bull and eat it.” –The complete works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 3, Pg 536\n\nCapt Ajit Vadakayil tells this – When Swami Vivekananda did NOT understand Hinduism, or when he could NOT even translate the Nasadiya Sukta of Rig Veda properly – what do you expect ?\n\nI leave it here — we need some Hindu heroes , right ? See I am forced to tell this . If the Gadhimai animal slaughter did NOT take place yesterday ( 5000 animals ) I would not even be revealing this .\n\nWhy do you think I started this blog site ?\n\nToday I have revealed 2.2% .\n\nAbove : This video was taken yesterday !\n\nCan we expect Modi to even say a word on TV condemning this animal sacrifice in Hindu temples ?\n\n– for we Hindus are now confused , if Narendra Modi is indeed a Hindu at all — never mind all his high profile Ganga aartis !\n\nOr will Narendra Modi continue praying to BR Ambedkar and Gandhi the moment he sees cameras around ?\n\nSo all this is ACCHE DIN for Hindus , right ?\n\nWANNA KNOW TO WHAT GREAT EXTENT THE IMMORAL WHITE INVADER HAS LABORED TO INJECT POISON INTO THE RIG VEDA ( NOT KNOWING THAT RIG VEDA IS NOT MEANT TO CONTAIN SUCH STUFF )\n\nCHECK THIS BULLSH#T OUT –\n\n“There was a time in this very India when, without eating beef, no Brahmin could remain a Brahmin;”\n\nAitareya Brahman of the Rigveda as follows:\n\n“6. …Turn the animal’s feet northwards. Make its eyes go to the Sun, dismiss its breath to the wond, its life to the space, its hearing to the directions, its body to the earth. In this way the Hotar (priest) connets it with these world. Take of the entire skin without cutting it. Before opening the navel tear out the omentum. Stop its breathing within (by stopping its mouth). Thus the Hotar puts breath in the animals. Make of its breast a piece like an eagle, of its arms (two pieces like) two hatchets, of its forearms (two pieces like) two spikes, of its shoulders (two pieces like) two kashyapas (tortoises), its loins should be unbroken (entire); make of its thigs (two pieces like) two shields, of the two kneepans (two pieces like) two oleander leaves; take out its twenty-six ribs according to their order; preserve every limb of its in its integrity. Thus he benefits all its limbs. Dig a ditch in the earth to hide its excrements.\n\n7.

We shall describe it. The two jawbones with the tongue are to be given to the Prastotar; the breast in the form of an eagle to the Udgatar; the throat with the palate to the Pratihartar; the lower part of the right loins to the Hotar; the left to the Brahma; the right thigh to the Maitravaruna; the left to the Brahmanuchhamsi; the right side with the shoulder to the Adhvaryu; the left side to those who accompany the chants; the left shoulder to the Pratipasthatar; the lower part of the right arm to the Neshtar; the lower part of the left arm to the Potar; the upper part of the right thigh to the Achhavaka; the left to the Agnidhra; the upper part of the right arm to the Aitreya; the left to the Sadasya; the back bone and the urinal bladder to the Grihapati (sacrificer); the right feet to the Grihapati who gives a feasting; the left feet to the wife of that Grihapati who gives a feasting; the upper lip is common to both, which is to be divided by the Grihapati. They offer the tail of the animal to wives, but they should give it to a Brahmana; the fleshy processes (maanihah) on the neck and three gristles (kikasaah) to the Grahvastut; three other gristles and one half of the fleshy part on the back (vaikartta) to the Unnetar; the other half of the fleshy part on the neck and the left lobe (Kloma) to the Slaughterer (Shamita), who should present it to a Brahmana, if he himself would not happen to be a Brahmana. The head is to be given to the Subrahmanya, the skin belongs to him (the Subrahmanya), who spoke, Svaah Sutyam (to morrow at the Soma Sacriice); that part of the sacrificial animal at a Soma sacrifice which beloings to Ilaa (sacrificial food) is common to all the priests; only for the Hotar it is optional.\n\nAll these portions of the sacrificial animal amount to thirty-six single pieces, each of which represents the paada (foot) of a verse by which the sacrifice is carried up…”\n\n“To those who divide the sacrificial animal in the way mentioned, it becomes the guide to heaven (Swarga). But those who make the division otherwise are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely.”\n\n“This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by Rishi Devabhaaga, a son of Srauta.

In Rig Veda (X. 86.14) Indra says: “They cook for one 15 plus twenty oxen”. The Rig Veda (X.91.14) says that for Agni were sacrificed horses, bulls, oxen, barren cows and rams. From the Rig Veda (X.72.6) it appears that the cow was killed with a sword or axe .That the Hindus at one time did kill cows and did eat beef is proved abundantly by the description of the Yajnas given in the Buddhist Sutras which relate to periods much later than the Vedas and the Brahmanas. The scale on which the slaughter of cows and animals took place was colossal. In the Samyuta Nikaya (111,1-9) we have another description of a Yajna performed by Pasenadi, king of Kosala. It is said that five hundred bulls, five hundred calves and many heifers, goats and rams were led to the pillar to be sacrificed. With this evidence no one can doubt that there was a time when Hindus-both Brahmins and non-Brahmins ate not only flesh but also beef. Coming to Manu there is no doubt that he too did. not prohibit the slaughter of the cow. On the other hand he made the eating of cow’s flesh on certain occasions obligatory. —UNQUOTE . NARENDRA MODIs GOD AND R STOOGE BR AMBEDKAR\n\nManu Smriti V. 42. A twice-born man who, knowing the true meaning of the Veda, slays an animal for these purposes, causes both himself and the animal to enter a most blessed state.- BR Ambedkar invention .\n\nManu Smriti V. 39. Swayambhu (the self-existent) himself created animals for the sake of sacrifices; sacrifices (have been instituted) for the good of this whole (world); hence the slaughtering (of beasts) for sacrifice is not slaughtering (in the ordinary sense of the word). BR Ambedkar invention .\n\nManu did not regard the cow as a sacred animal. On the other hand, he regarded it as an impure animal whose touch caused ceremonial pollution.- BR Ambedkar invention .\n\nManu had no objection to the eating of the cow’s flesh. Manu did not make the killing of the cow an offence. Manu divides sins into two classes (i) mortal sins and (ii) minor sins. Among the minor sins Manu includes: XI. 60. Killing the cow- BR Ambedkar invention .\n\nAccording to Manu cow-killing was only a minor sin. It was reprehensible only if the cow was killed without good and sufficient reason. Even if it was otherwise, it was not heinous or inexplicable. The same was the attitude of Yajnavalkya. All this proves that for generations the Brahmins had been eating beef. – BR Ambedkar invention .\n\nThe Vedanta Sutra which proclaims the doctrine of oneness of life does not prohibit the killing of animals for sacrificial purposes as is evident from 11.1.28. In the second place, if the transformation was due to the desire to realise the ideal of Advaita then there is no reason why it should have stopped with the cow. It should have extended to all other animals.– BR Ambedkar invention\n\nThe Brahadamyaka Upanishad upholds the doctrine of transmigration (vi.2) and yet recommends that if a man desires to have a learned son born to him he should prepare a mass of the flesh of the bull or ox or of other flesh with rice and ghee. – BR Ambedkar invention\n\nBuddhism was at one time the religion of the majority of the people of India. It continued to be the religion of the masses for hundreds of years. It attacked Brahmanism on all sides as no religion had done before. Brahmanism was on the wane and if not on the wane, it was certainly on the defensive. As a result of the spread of Buddhism, the Brahmins had lost all power and prestige at the Royal Court and among the people. They were smarting under the defeat they had suffered at the hands of Buddhism and were making all possible efforts to regain their power and prestige. Buddhism had made so deep an impression on the minds of the masses and had taken such a hold of them that it was absolutely impossible for the Brahmins to fight the Buddhists except by accepting their ways and means and practising the Buddhist creed in its extreme form. After the death of Buddha his followers started setting up the images of the Buddha and building stupas. The Brahmins followed it. They, in their turn, built temples and installed in them images of Shiva, Vishnu and Ram and Krishna etc – all with the object of drawing away the crowd that was attracted by the image worship of Buddha. That is how temples and images which had no place in Brahmanism came into Hinduism. The Buddhists rejected the Brahmanic religion which consisted of Yajna and animal sacrifice, particularly of the cow. The objection to the sacrifice of the cow had taken a strong hold of the minds of the masses especially as they were an agricultural population and the cow was a very useful animal. The Brahmins in all probability had come to be hated as the killer of cows in the same way as the guest had come to be hated as Gognha, the killer of the cow by the householder, because whenever he came a cow had to be killed in his honour. That being the case, the Brahmins could do nothing to improve their position against the Buddhists except by giving up the Yajna as a form of worship and the sacrifice of the cow. BR Ambedkar invention -nay- uska rangeen sapne !\n\nThat the object of the Brahmins in giving up beef-eating was to snatch away from the Buddhist Bhikshus the supremacy they had acquired is evidenced by the adoption of vegetarianism by Brahmins. Why did the Brahmins become vegetarian? The answer is that without becoming vegetarian the Brahmins could not have recovered the ground they had lost to their rival namely Buddhism. In this connection it must be remembered that there was one aspect in which Brahmanism suffered in public esteem as compared to Buddhism. That was the practice of animal sacrifice which was the essence of Brahmanism and to which Buddhism was deadly opposed. That in an agricultural population there should be respect for Buddhism and revulsion against Brahmanism which involved slaughter of animals including cows and bullocks is only natural. What could the Brahmins do to recover the lost ground? To go one better than the Buddhist Bhikshus not only to give up meat-eating but to become vegetarians- which they did. BR Ambedkar invention -nay- uska rangeen sapne !\n\nAs the Buddhist Bhikshus did eat meat the Brahmins had no reason to give it up. Why then did the Brahmins give up meat-eating and become vegetarians? It was because they did not want to put themselves merely on the same footing in the eyes of the public as the Buddhist Bhikshus.—-BR Ambedkar’s delusions\n\nThe brahmins wanted to oust the Buddhists from the place of honour and respect which they had acquired in the minds of the masses by their opposition to the killing of the cow for sacrificial purposes. To achieve their purpose the Brahmins had to adopt the usual tactics of a reckless adventurer. It is to beat extremism with extremism. It is the strategy which all rightists use to overcome the leftists. The only way to beat the Buddhists was to go a step further and be vegetarians.– BR Ambedkar’s delusions\n\nIf you want to destroy a society, destroy its history and the society will get destroyed automatically. – Dr. B.R. Ambedkar\n\nDr. B.R.Ambedkar’s views on the Vedas:–\n\n“Now the Brahmins have left no room for doubt, for they have propounded a most mischievous dogma which the Brahmins have spread among the masses, is the dogma of the infallibility of the Vedas. The Vedas are a worthless set of books. There is no reason either to call them sacred or infallible. Nobody has had the courage to ask why these worthless books which contain nothing but invocation to tribal gods to destroy the enemies, loot their property and give it to their followers, have been made sacred and infallible. But the time has come when the Hindu mind must be freed from the hold which the silly ideas propagated by the Brahmins, are on them. Without this liberation India has no future. I have undertaken this task knowing full well what risk it involves. I am not afraid of consequences. I shall be happy if I succeed in stirring the masses”\n\nSIR Ambedkar had found out the hard way that Hinduism is so deeply rooted that it cannot be destroyed.\n\nPunch into Google search –\n\nCNN-IBN POLL, THE GREATEST INDIAN SINCE MAHATMA GANDHI VADAKAYIL\n\nYAJURVEDA HAS BEEN IN KERALA FROM 4000 BC WHEN LORD PARASHURAMA BROUGHT IT WITH HIM .

Human consciousness and human behavior are nothing but the states and activities of these various bodies of vibrating energy. Toxic energies can also manifest as physical illnesses or defects.\n\nMeat is toxic to the body. Their ingestion creates negative energies. On the other hand, fruits, vegetables, and grains are reservoirs of pure, basic life energies which are very light and malleable.\n\nThese energies are easily assimilated into all our bodies and made to take on our specific, unique life vibrations and karmic patterns. Being vegan facilitates spiritual growth and the expansion of consciousness.\n\nThere is a true correlation between our food choices and violence in the world.

Thus, mind consists of food” (Chandogya Upanishad 6.5.4, 6.6.1,2,5). –\n\nAhimsa means kindness and non-violence towards all living things including animals; it respects living beings as a unity, and includes the belief that all living things are connected.\n\nThis is very different from Illuminati agent Gandhi’s ahimsa where he recruited 13 lakh Indian soldiers for the first World War ( to create the state of Israel ) and reminded his recruits to kill only the Germans and NOT the white invader who robbed India blind.\n\n“What need there be said of those innocent and healthy creatures endued with love of life, when they are sought to be slain by sinful wretches subsisting by slaughter? For this reason, O monarch, know that the discarding of meat is the highest refuge of religion, of heaven, and of happiness. Abstention from injury is the highest religion. It is, again, the highest penance. It is also the highest truths from which all duty proceeds. Flesh cannot be had from grass or wood or stone. Unless a living creature is slain, it cannot be had. Hence is the fault in eating flesh… That man who abstains from meat, is never put in fear, O king, by any creature. All creatures seek his protection. He never causes any anxiety in others, and himself has never to become anxious. If there were nobody who ate flesh there would then be nobody to kill living creatures. The man who kills living creatures kill them for the sake of the person who eats flesh. If flesh were regarded as inedible, there would then be no slaughter of living creatures. It is for the sake of the eater that the slaughter of living creatures goes on in the world. Since, O thou of great splendour, the period of life is shortened of persons who slaughter living creatures or cause them to be slaughtered, it is clear that the person who wishes his own good should give up meat entirely… The purchaser of flesh performs himsa [violence] by his wealth; he who eats flesh does so by enjoying its taste; the killer does himsa by actually tying and killing the animal. Thus, there are three forms of killing. He who brings flesh or sends for it, he who cuts off the limbs of an animal, and he who purchases, sells, or cooks flesh and eats it—all of these are to be considered meat-eaters.” (Mahabharata 13.115-4000 BC )\n\n“Those sinful persons who are ignorant of actual religious principles, yet consider themselves to be completely pious, without compunction commit violence against innocent animals who are fully trusting in them. In their next lives, such sinful persons will be eaten by the same creatures they have killed in this world.” (Bhagavata Purana 11.5.14)\n\n“A person fully aware of religious principles should never offer anything like meat, eggs or fish , and even if one is a Kshatriya (warrior), he himself should not eat such things.” (Bhagavata Purana 7.15.7)\n\nअनुमन्‍ता विशसिता निहन्‍ता क्रयविक्रयी ।\n\nसंस्‍कर्ता चोपहर्ता च खादकश्‍चेति घातका: ।। – मनुस्‍मृति ५.५१\n\nMeaning: One who promotes or supports non-vegetarianism, the butcher, one who sells or purchases meat, the one who cooks it, serves it or consumes it, are all destructive / vicious in nature.- Manusmriti\n\nय: अहिंसकानि भूतानि हिनस्‍ति आत्‍मसुखेच्‍छया ।\n\nस जीवंश्‍च मृतश्‍चैव न क्‍वचित्‌ सुखमेधते ।। – मनुस्‍मृति ५.५४\n\nMeaning: One who slaughters non-violent, helpless animals for his own happiness never attains happiness when alive and even after death.- Manusmriti\n\nयो बंधनवधक्‍लेशान्‍प्राणिनां न चिकीर्षति ।\n\nस सर्वस्‍य हितप्रेप्‍सु: सुखम्‌ अत्‍यंतम्‌ अश्‍नुते ।। – मनुस्‍मृति ५.४६\n\nMeaning: One who does not have a desire to shackle and slaughter animals, becomes the well-wisher of animals and acquires infinite happiness.

The whole cosmos is interconnected in this field and speed is NOT restricted to Einstein’s SPEED OF LIGHT.\n\nSri Yantra ( DIVINE GEOMETRY OF OM ) which follows the Fibonacci series and the Golden ratio ( lifted from 7000 year old Vedic Mathematics ) is the mystical 3D holographic construct of the Cosmos by 9 VIRTUAL SPIRALLING VORTEX CONES — 4 pointing upwards and 5 pointing downwards, as a sort of ying-yang balance\n\nhttp://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2016/12/108-numerical-equivalent-of-hindu-king.html\n\nThe master cellular control system of the human body is holographic. Nothing we experience escapes being imprinted into our Cellular Hologram in the form of a cell memory. What we commonly refer to as “The Cellular Memory” is the collective energy field generated by these individual cell memories.\n\nSanatana Dharma was the first to understand the holographic nature of the cosmos. Vaastu is the basis of Hindu architecture.\n\nDNA can be influenced by acoustic, electromagnetic and SCALAR WAVES. In the quantum holographic DNA-wave bio-computer theory, DNA is a self-calibrating antenna working by phase conjugate ( scalar waves and phase conjugation) adaptive resonance capable of both receiving and transmitting scalar energy .\n\nAs per Vedanta we are essentially holographic energy beings existing in a state of resonance with the scalar field of the cosmos. . The brain without consciousness is inert and lifeless. Consciousness is a form of matter just as matter is a form of consciousness. All atoms in the entire universe are capable of mind reading and communicating with other atoms–THE BASIS OF ASTROLOGY\n\nCONTINUED TO 2\n\nCapt. Ajit VadakayilDecember 13, 2017 at 2:22 PM\n\nCONTINUED FROM 1-\n\nOur brain is holographic. While introducing Nikola Tesla to Akasha or longitudinal field ZPF waves , in 1903, the great Indian mystic has told him -“Every part is a whole and everything springs from the whole”. This was 45 years before a hologram was invented.\n\nThe sound of OM in front of a drop of liquid, it will transform itself into a 3D Sri Yantra which is very specific visual form which is symmetrical and also holographic, in that every bit of it contains all of it.\n\nWater holds memory and is used as THEERTHAM and also for IMMERSING OUR CREMATE ASHES .\n\nThe Hindu Sri Yantra divine geometry contains the Theory of Everything.\n\nDNA blueprint functions as a bio-hologram which serves as a guiding matrix for organizing physical form.\n\nDNA can be influenced by acoustic, electromagnetic and SCALAR WAVES..The interference patterns of the scalar waves form a huge hologram that permeates the whole of the universe.The body is holographic— when you influence one bio marker , you influence all..\n\nPineal gland is literally the third eye. Ancient maharishis and Vishnu’s mortal avatars used their pineal glands for laser beams.Holograms are all about changing the angle at which two lasers strike a piece of photographic film- to record many different images on same surface..\n\nToday we have shriveled calcified pineal glands ( like a dried up raisin ) and 2 strand DNA ( 97% junk ) — yet our brain is a holographic machine existing in a holographic Universe\n\nWELL WELL WHAT DO THESE WHITE CUNTS KNOW— THEY CALL SANATANA DHARMA THE RELIGION OF SAVAGES–YET IN ANCIENT TIMES 2300 YEARS AGO THEY CAME AND STUDIED IN OUR UNIVERSITIES AND LEARNT SANSKRIT–WHY ?\n\nIF SO WHY DID THE ENTIRE LOT OF WHITE QUANTUM SCIENTISTS CONVERT TO HINDUISM AND GET THEMSELVES CREMATED ?\n\nhttp://ajitvadakayil.blogspot.in/2012/11/rip-impossible-with-burial-world-is.html\n\nVEDIC SRUTIS HAVE GOLDEN MEAN (1.618 ) , FIBONACCI SERIES , PASCALS TRIANGLE, LUCAS NUMBERS , SRI YANTRA ( GEOMETRY OF OM ), ULAM SPIRAL, PRIME NUMBER MAGIC EMBEDDED IN IT —\n\nTHIS IS WHY WE HINDUS INSIST THAT SRUTIS WERE DOWNLOADED FROM AKASHA BY SEERS –THEY ARE NOT WRITTEN BY MAN. THE METERS ARE SACRED.\n\nTHE SOUND OF THE VEDIC VERSES MATTERS , NOT THE MEANING OF THE VERSE , WHICH BASICALLY INDUCE A FEELING OF GRATITUDE.\n\nTHE WHITE MAN THOUGHT HE COULD INJECT POISON INTO OUR VEDAS– THEY NEVER KNOW ONCE POISON IS INJECTED THE VERSE IS MATHEMATICALLY INCONGRUENT –IT IS LIKE CURDLING MILK\n\ncapt ajit vadakayil\n\n..\n\n· Anurag ShuklaJanuary 10, 2018 at 3:17 PM\n\nFollow your inner voice. When reading bhaja govindam previously, even I did not fee comfortable with the first verse saying “सम्प्राप्ते सन्निहिते काले\n\nनहि नहि रक्षति डुकृङ्करणे”. Then again the part where a saffron clad Adi Sankara says\n\nजटिलो मुण्डी लुञ्छितकेशः\n\nकाषायाम्बरबहुकृतवेषः ।\n\nपश्यन्नपि च न पश्यति मूढो\n\nह्युदरनिमित्तं बहुकृतवेषः ॥ १४॥\n\nThere are many who go with matted locks, many who have clean\n\nshaven heads, many whose hairs have been plucked out; some are\n\nclothed in orange, yet others in various colours — all just for\n\na livelihood.\n\nHow can a saint himself deride saints like this? Even if there are black sheep, will he write a verse deriding all sadhus?\n\nAgain in Hanuman Chalisa – even when reading it aloud, I could not get myself to say these lines –\n\nऔर देवता चित्त न धरई ।\n\nहनुमत सेइ सर्ब सुख करई ॥३५॥\n\nI will not keep any other God in my heart, except Hanuman.\n\nSo I will not even remember Ram/Vishnu (even though Hanuman himself worships Ram)?\n\nThis never felt right.\n\nAs soon as Ajit ji wrote this, it was a Eureka moment.\n\nMany thanks, Ajit ji.\n\n·\n\nCapt.

Parushurama obeyed his father and got three boons in return. He used one of the boons to bring his mother back to life. Renuka’s decapitated head could not be traced. Head of a lower caste woman named Yellamma was attached to Renuka’s body. Thus a lower caste woman achieved the higher status of being a Brahmin’s wife.Following the tradition a number of young girls started dedicating themselves to the FAKE goddess YELLAMMA –and they became prostitutes after first mensesThe white invader injected poison that in Vedic times Devadasis were divided into seven categories.They are known as Dutta, Hruta, Bikrita, Bhrutya, Alankara and Gopika or Rudraganika — depending on the sexual deviancy branch they were experts in oral / anal / morbid fetish etc.Capt ajit vadakayil\n\n..\n\nCapt.

Kunti having warmed up to Pandu’s second wife Madri during their exile shares the mantra with her, on the condition that she only use it once. Madri cleverly summons the Ashvins, who give her twin sons Nakula and Sahadeva.After the death of Pandu and Madri, Kunti took care of all five Pandava children,THE DOG REPRESENTED DHARMA ( YAMA ) — YUDHISHTRA WAS “SON OF DHARMA “..NOW ALL FAKE INDOLOGISTS, BENAMI MEDIA, LITERERY FEST DROHIS, JNU COMMIES, WNDY DINIGER, SHELDON POLLOCK, AURDEY TRUSCHKE , AND ALL CHOOTS WHO THROW SHIT ON KRISHNA –HARK !AFTER READING THE MAHABHARATA EPIC — ALL WONDERED WHY KRISHNA PLAYED FOUL–\n\nIF YOU REALLY LOOK AT IT DISPASSIONATELY — HE GAVE ALL 100 TEST TUBE BABIES MOKSHA– THE ULTIMATE GIFT FROM VISHNUs AVATAR ..\n\nTHIS IS ONE OF MY GREATEST REVELATIONS ABOUT SANATANA DHARMAMY REVELATIONS NOW JUMP TO 58.04 %capt ajit vadakayil\n\n..\n\nKapil Agarwal\n\nMay 10, 2018 at 8:19 PM\n\ncaptain,\n\nwhat about amarnath cave. is it holy . you have broken a Bombshell on hindus.we might see the miltary scaling down its troops from amarnath now that you have mentioned it.\n\nReplyDelete\n\nReplies\n\n###########################\n\nCapt.
