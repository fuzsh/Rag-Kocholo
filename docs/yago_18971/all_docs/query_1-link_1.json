        "meta_description": "Vanni Mouse: Directed by 'Tamiliam' Subas. With Lurthumary Fernando, Navasuthan Selvanathan. Vanni Mouse, a short film, follows two inseparable mice who take flight from the Vanni woods, only to land tragically within the barbed wire fences of Manik Farm, an internment camp in Vavuniya (Sri Lanka). Here, hundreds of thousands of innocent Tamils are imprisoned. Witnessing the heartbreaking suffering of innocent Tamil civilians, the mice become silent observers of unspoken tragedies. Theirs are the only eyes to see the horrors within the camp, the only potential carriers of these painful stories. Will they escape this terrifying reality? That's the question that drives this poignant short film to its climax.",

        "text": "Even though we have not experienced that pain, we know and feel it fully, and it still hurts in our hearts.\n\nIn the midst of deliberate misrepresentation of historical atrocities and genocide, the truth can only be told by those who have felt the pain and experienced the pain.\n\nEvery atrocities, genocide, and event in history must be passed on to the next generation without fail. Because here are the people and sites that destroy real history and genocide.\n\nIt is a bit surprising to point out the screenplay with such a mouse.\n\nIt is very sad that when a screenplay reveals a real historical atrocity out of its pain, it gets awards under the title of fiction."
