        "text": "Based on an old Nietzschean narrative, this paper explores conceptual encounters between the Buddhist philosopher N훮g훮rjuna (ca. 150-250 CE) and the post-structuralist Gilles Deleuze (1925-1995 CE) which may be clearly articulated by way of their similar conceptions of negation. Both philosophers vehemently rejected the reduction of difference to the negative and were able to initiate a strictly philosophical resistance against the orthodox philosophies of their respective place and time. Nevertheless, N훮g훮rjuna-in my view-goes one step further than Deleuze by arguing for a non-conceptual, absolute indifference which is able to embrace difference without reducing it. While this affirmative notion of indifference perhaps seems unintuitive for the Western reader, I explore its conceptual relation to absolute freedom and unrestricted love by employing both Eastern and Western, historical and contemporary sources.\n\nIn 1985, I was invited (upon my request) to Deleuze's apartment to discuss, among other things, the recent publication of a special journal issue on Deleuze and Guattari, SubStance 44/45 (1984) that I edited. While I did not record the meeting, I took notes on it immediately thereafter. In 1995, upon hearing news of Deleuze's death, I shared my notes with the Deleuze-Guattari Listserv group to which I was actively contributing. The text available here also appears in my (1998) book on Deleuze and Guattari, and appeared in a short-lived online journal NthDimension.\n\nThis book inquires how we cultural studies can be done using Deleuze and Guattar's work. It offers readings of Blade Runner, the Bonaventure Hotel in LA (the sine qua non of postmodern space according to Jameson), novels by Bronte and Melville as well as 1980s pop music."
