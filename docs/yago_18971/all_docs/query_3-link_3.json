        "text": "This is my contribution to Roti Kapada aur Rum’s international call to all Indian film bloggers to submit something for Shameful Classics celebration in July, 2011. After I saw Pardes (1997) last year I was very enthused about it, yet nearly every NRI I spoke to, emailed, or tweeted about it said how much they disliked the film. I adored Pardes, maybe because as a gori I’m free of the cultural shame some NRIs have over Bollywood films, so when Shameful Classics month came up, I figured it’s time to do a post on this insane film, after all I loved the film so much I practically screen capped it all! In fact, if you scroll quickly over this post it will look like a flip book of the movie, THAT’S how many screen caps there are. So I suppose at minimum I should be ashamed of adding to internet pollution. One of best parts of doing this blog is being able to rave about a movie that most of you saw years back that I’m just discovering now. As I said, I LOVED this movie, but then again I tend to love all Subash Ghai films for their kitsch value and dramatic plot twists. Glancing over Ghai’s filmography, I’ve seen and enjoyed all of these, Vishwanath (1978); Karz (1980); Krodhi (1981); Meri Jung (1985); Ram Lakhan (1989); Khalnayak (1993); Trimurti (1995) (producer); Taal (1999); Aitraaz (2004) (producer); Kisna: The Warrior Poet (2005); Iqbal (2005) (producer); Black & White (2008); and with time I’ve even remembered Yuvvraaj (2008) as resonating as a fun film, especially when Katrina’s character says something like , “You’re 100% complete anti-family hai!” to Salman’s character. Remember that?! I LOVED that! So is it possible that Ghai’s my favorite Bollywood director? Should I be ashamed? Let’s continue on with Pardes!\n\nPardes, meaning “foreign land”, is a story that revolves around Ganga (Mahima Chaudhary). She is an Indian girl living in a rural village, brought up by her conservative family. Kishorilal (Amrish Puri) is a wealthy and successful businessman who lives in Los Angeles, America but is still deeply attached to his motherland India and adores the values and culture of India. On a visit to India, he meets his old friend Suraj Dev (Alok Nath) and stays at his house. During his stay he gets to know Suraj Dev’s family and becomes very attached to Ganga, Dev’s eldest daughter, who is the epitome of Indian culture. He hopes to find an Indian girl for his westernized, American son, Rajiv (Apoorva Agnihotri) and feels that Ganga is just right. He offers a marriage proposal between Ganga and Rajiv; Dev’s family accepts. Kishorilal knows he will have a tough time trying to convince Rajiv, who has never even visited India. But Kishorilal has a plan. He sends his foster son, Arjun (Shahrukh Khan) (‘Little Master’), to play cupid and convince Rajiv to visit India and meet and approve of Ganga. Arjun arrives at Dev’s house and makes changes and arrangements to make the place suitable for Rajiv. Rajiv joins him in a few days and initially does not like the idea. Arjun spends many days trying to get Ganga and Rajiv to like each other and, in the process, becomes a close friend of Ganga. Eventually Rajiv and Ganga agree to the wedding….(source)\n\nPardes (1997) is one of those America is bad for the India soul films, but unlike the more recently released MNIK, Pardes simple “America’s evil culture is bad, and India and its people are good,” theme didn’t bother me at all. Perhaps this is because America was played a lot of the time by Canada, (Vancouver) in Pardes, and the places where innocent beautiful bride Ganga ( Mahima Chaudhry) does show up in the USA are really not so chaste, such as Las Vegas, aka sin city.\n\nSo let’s begin the tale of Pardes in India, where everything is good, see:\n\nThose are the words of Amrish Puri’s character, Kishorilal, the typical NRI rich industrialist living in Ameerika who travels back to Hindustan to keep in touch with his roots and meet with childhood friends, like Alok Nath’s Suraj Dev. After some typically spectacular Indian hospitality, Kishorilal thinks, “I Love My India” and figures why not marry his fancy American-raised son to a pure woman of India, Suraj’s beti, Ganga!. Wouldn’t you do the same given the opportunity?\n\nHe returns to India to pitch this idea to his fancy son, Ragiv (Apurva Agnihoti), who is of course amoral having been raised in the USA. But how to soften this blow to Ragiv? How can a lad raised in the pure and constant luxury of America understand and accept India, a developing country?\n\nHow to solve this dilemma? Well as it turns out, Kishorlal has a quasi son, a pure hearted orphan named Arjun, played by Shahrukh Khan…\n\nwho’s grown to be both an accomplished auto mechanic, who runs a fancy garage, where he dances with his boyz in their off time\n\nand also manages to be an Asian Music Chart topper!\n\nSee how humble Arjun is when being interviewed on a big radio show, even though he’s a chart topper? He’s from India, he’s a good man.\n\nSo Arjun escorts Rajiv over to India as his cultural attaché, which comes in handy when some village guy thinks he’s got a claim on bride-to-be Ganga and they decide to play a game of kabaddi to settle the score.\n\nNRI Rajiv, is like Kabaddi? So this is where Arjun’s cultural attaché-ness comes in handy, he not only shows him how a mean game of kabaddi is played,\n\nbut he shows how to play kabaddi to win the girl!\n\nI think I forgot the part where Ganga sees Arjun when he first arrives in India and thinks he’s cute before she ever sees Rajiv, so there’s that. Just keep that in the back of your mind for now for dramatic foreshadowing purposes only… Back to America, and Ganga is a bit shy upon arrival to this foreign land, for it’s so different from her beautiful India, but she’s not too shy to perform I Love My India in front of the masses at a function. Kishorilal begins to plan for the wedding and it’s clear that he’s been contaminated by his time in America, revealing his superficial materialism, which does not exist in India, right? Ganga is comforted by orphan to foster savior son, Arjun, who is there in Canada America to soften the blow of culture shock. Rajiv is always busy with work and then while looking around the home, abandoned Ganga sees trashy gori and kali girl photos plastered on the walls, as well as dirty magazines and is rightfully concerned. What does it all mean? Rajiv’s evil cousin helps to explain the morally bankrupt ways of America to innocent Ganga.\n\nRajiv, Arjun, and Ganga go out to a party on a fancy yacht in the port of Los Angeles Vancouver one afternoon and there’s a scuffle, and while Rajiv is focusing on his own richi-rich status… he doesn’t even notice when some guys leer and grope on Ganga, but watchful Arjun does, and defends her honor. One night the same three all go to a disco, something new to Ganga. She’s shocked to see Rajiv is smoking, but Arjun to the rescue, explains away any concerns about this to Ganga:\n\nNo worries, right? It’s only a bit of smoking, right? They go one to play some game at the disco called Prince & Princess Made in Heaven Contest which in all my time spent in American discos, I’ve never seen. Their compatibility is revealed in this game and they win! See how happy they are together?\n\nSee the cute statue they win in the leucite box? Alas, their happiness is fleeting because in the background Rajiv is getting drunk.\n\nBut remember, Ganga is engaged to Ragiv, not Arjun, the man who’s maintained his pure Indian soul despite his long-term exposure to American culture. Rajiv having spent all his life in the USA is not so fortunate to have learned good Indian morals, and he gets drunk and Arjun helps remove him from a brawl.\n\nSo these warning signs are adding up: the smoking, the drinking, the bar fight, the fight on the yacht, the dirty magazines, and an ex-girlfriend with a gori name. Rajiv even abruptly tells Ganga one evening he’s going out with his girlfriend, which is sort of a red flag, hai na? Ganga is feeling reluctant about her upcoming marriage to Rajiv and seeks comfort in her friendship with Arjun. On Arjun’s birthday she brings him a cake and some balloons and hangs out with him at the garage with the boys while Rajiv is probably out somewhere with this Kelly. Ganga even brings their “Match Made in Heaven” statue to the party and Arjun’s wise friend is bit suspicious, remember, Ganga is Rajiv’s match, not Arjun’s match.\n\nIt’s Arjun’s wise friend (Pavan Malhotra), peering around some Bollywood balloons, who sees the love he has in his eyes for Ganga. Can you see it too?\n\nRajiv becomes a bit jealous of the friendship between Arjun and Ganga, tells his dad Kishorilal, who in an effort to keep Arjun away from Ganga, transfers him to another office very far from where they live now, which I tought was Vancouver posing as Los Angeles, but maybe it was really being Vancouver all along since he was sending Arjun away to Los Angeles, confusing.\n\nIn the meantime, Rajiv takes Ganga on a little trip to Las Vegas, corruption capital of America! There were plenty of gori extras,\n\nand for the first time in a Hindi film I saw kali extras too:\n\nUp in the hotel, Rajiv wants to share a penthouse room with his Indian fiance, and “take things to the next level.” Ganga is pure, Ganga is not having that!\n\nWhat’s so spectacular about this near rape hotel scene is that Rajiv insults Ganga, but it’s not until he makes disparaging remarks against India that she snaps! After the insults to India, the fight is on and she beats him up. I believe he does get one tight slap to the face in, but once Ganga is fired up, her rage for defending her mother India is unstoppable! She escapes after knocking him out, and as luck would have it, some of Arjun’s home boys catch wind of Ganga’s location at a truck stop near Las Vegas. Please note the brick phone, I didn’t take this screen cap for nothing!\n\nKishorilal and Rajiv put the rush on the wedding plans and plan to catch up with Ganga, who has now returned to her mother India with the help of Arjun, who rescued her from her peril in Las Vegas. Obviously Kishorilal goes nuts and demands to know how she disappeared from the Vegas hotel, and Rajiv, doesn’t say, “well, I tried to rape her and she knocked me out,” but instead lies:\n\nIf you’ve read this blog before, you may know that I have a small hobby with spotting Johnnie Walker bottles in Indian films, and this shot is the limit! Look at the slutty poster on the wall and FIVE bottles of Johnnie Walker, black label, (not to mention the implied bottles that lurk between him and that poster) to match Rajiv’s black American heart!\n\nNow safely back in India, Ganga’s reputation is ruined, because the NRI Americans have said she ran off with Arjun because they were in love, neglecting to tell the truth about Rajiv’s immoral and criminal behavior. To be fair, Kishorilal has been lied to by his son Rajiv, so how is he to know that his orphan to foster son is really an innocent savior as pure as the Ganga, and Ganga herself? I love my India! Ganga’s mother is mortified at the disgrace that’s happened since her daughter returned unmarried, which really messes up the family izzat. Ganga’s dad, Suraj Dev believes the stories from America that Ganga has run off with Arjun.\n\nPoor Ganga wants to protect her father from the truth about what happened in the US, considering that Kishorilal is his BFF and in leaving out a few key details (attempted rape) she and Arjun become the focus of Suraj Dev’s rage, for after all, a returned bride-to-be is a dirty thing in India. Wow Dad, so harsh! But you know who WON’T let his chaste Ganga be defiled with cruel lies or be hit by her own father!? Arjun! And here things get HOT! SRK goes full-blown crazy, cutting himself with a gigantic saber by pulling it by the blade from Suraj Dev’s furious hands!\n\nI love it when SRK does crazy, it’s one of his strengths as an actor, that over the top deliscious D R A M A, and Pardes delivers with his self mutilating with a large sword, to clearly make his point to Ganga’s dad. No one will hit or talk trash about Ganga! To escape further harm to Ganga’s already mistakenly tarnished reputation, Arjun runs off to what is supposed to be the bus station, but what is Fatehpur Sikri. Remember, he was originally an orphan, so he believes that a return to orphanhood is perhaps his fate. I loved how these scenes shot in historic Fatehpur Sikri were made to look like a bustling bus stand where SRK keeps toting around his backpack in various attempts to storm off in dignity. I had the good fortune to travel to Fatepur Sikri near Agra, India almost 2 years ago, and it looked more like THIS. I’ve added a few of my own travel photos of this historic site here so you can see I was right near where Arjun was! Dekh! My Fatehpur Sikri:\n\nArjun’s Fatehpur Sikri:\n\nArjun’s Fatehpur Sikri may have some sufi action:\n\nBut MY Fatehpur Sikri in the same location has some kingfisher action:\n\nWhile Arjun runs off, Ganga has been locked away in the house, only to be released by her grandmother who urges her to go after Arjun!\n\nGanga catches up with Arjun before he gets on the bus at Fatehpur Sikri, but to preserve what he thinks is family honor, he feigns disinterest. Ganga declares her love for Arjun, he holds back.\n\nGrandma catches up to the scene and encourages Ganga and disburses wisdom.\n\nThat’s right girl!\n\nArjun and Ganga seem to work things out,\n\nbut guess who has arrived on the scene? Rajiv and some of his goonda friends wielding field hockey sticks, and Kishorilal!\n\nSorry Ganga, they have returned for you. Let’s take a break for another view of My Fatehpur Sikri, right about where all the action is taking place in Pardes:\n\nAnd Action!\n\nRajiv finally gets his comeuppance!\n\nThen Ganga finally reveals the wounds she suffered at Rajiv’s hands to Kishorilal and her own family. Reputation cleared, izaat intact, for Ganga, for her family, for all of India! At last the wise orphan addresses his foster father and tell him what America has done to Kishorilal’s soul: What Kishorilal forgot in America is what he learned in his Bharat Mata… Does Arjun get the girl? Is Kishorlal about to slap him or give him a pat of approval? If you don’t know see the film to find out.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that Kishorilal and Rajiv weren’t able to read and follow this sign that I found posted in the local mandir, The Hindu Temple of Minnesota. This would have helped them avoid all of the problems they had in America all together,\n\nbut then it’s a good thing they didn’t, so great film like Pardes could be made! Please share your thoughts of the film with me.\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nIn honor of Beth Loves Bollywood’s international Khanna Family initiative to celebrate all film industry Khannas,Khanna-o-Rama, I would like to contribute a little write-up on Dayavan (1988).\n\nIt starts out with poor little orphan, Shakti Vellu, aka Dayavan (kid version of Vinod Khanna) ending up witnessing his dad being unjustly murdered by some corrupt police. He has to flee his southern home and hide in Bombay for safety only to run into some punks on the seaside who try to beat and rob him. During this fight, Dayavan runs into a little ruffian, Shanker (kid version of Feroz Khan), who is impressed by Dayavan’s fighting skills, flair, generosity, piety, all that good stuff , which to me are the personality traits I want to believe the Khanna’s (Rahul, Akshaye, and Vinod) posses in real life, don’t you? OK, real life, whatever, back to the movie. Dayavan sets Shankar straight about his true inner badass nature, for within the composed orphan, lies a heart capable of murderous rage with he witnesses injustice!\n\nI am too lazy to get into retelling you the plot of the film, so here’s a synopsis to suffice and then I’ll skip to the parts I liked best.\n\nAfter having witnessed his dad being killed by the local South Indian police, and being orphaned and homeless, Shakti Velhu develops a hate, and distrust of the police in India. He is befriended by another homeless boy named Shanker, who asks him to accompany him a slum in Bombay, where they live with a kind-hearted Muslim named Karim Baba, and his daughter, Shama. This is where Shakti and Shankar spend their childhood. When they mature, they take to petty crime. Here too, Shakti witnesses police brutality and atrocities, especially at the hands of sadistic, alcoholic, and womanizing Police Inspector Ratan Singh. When Karim Baba is arrested, jailed, and found hanging by his neck in police custody, Shakti hunts down Ratan Singh, and kills him in broad daylight in front of the several hundred people. An investigation is launched, but no one comes forward as a witness. Thus Shakti gets his reputation as a Don with a good heart viz. Dayavan. Shakti marries local prostitute, Neelu, and has two children, Suraj and Sarita. He becomes even more powerful and influential all over Bombay, and his working partners are powerful criminal dons who have ruled over Bombay for eons. Shakti eventually replaces these dons, and becomes Bombay’s only Don. This creates enemies for him and his family, but he believes since he has not really done any harm to anyone, he and his family will be safe. It is this belief that will take a heavy toll on his life and that of his family, when the truth dawns that he, himself, is responsible for being kind to a man, who will ultimately bring forward ruin to the Velhu family. (source)\n\nFast forward from their childhood to adulthood still in the slums, think Slumdog Millionaire, except in this case the two guys stick together and have a life long bromance. Check out one of their bromantic escapades here:\n\nThere’s the supreme policeman villain there to push Dayavan’s buttons, talk about a corrupt dude! Inspector Ratan Singh (Amrish Puri!) harasses the slum dwellers, especially a spicy widow played by Aruna Irani.\n\nAs a spinster, I’ve managed quite well for very long without a husband, Amrish-ji, I mean Inspector Ratan Singh. When the evil cop is not harassing widow Aruna, he lies about with the courtesans of the slums drinking hooch.\n\nEnter Khanna hero, Vinod, who witnesses the harassment of the widow and breaks into a justice fueled fury, and executes a beat down on the inspector.\n\nHaughtiness intact! Yet another trait I image the Khanna’s have in real life: intact haughtiness under adverse circumstances. Then after the severe police brutality takes its toll on Dayavan’s body, enter Shankar, to comfort him. Take in the splendor of the bromance:\n\nHow do you cheer up your buddy after an assault from a crooked cop? A night out at the local brothel of course!\n\nThe tune I liked most from the film was Kahe Saiyan Teri Meri Baat with playback singers Ahsa Bhosle and Kavita Krishnamurthy (music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal, lyrics Aziz Qaisi). I couldn’t find the video separate from the film, so to see it go to 2:30 in the clip below to see the greatness.\n\nShankar teases Dayavan about his lack of experience with women and arranges for him to have an overnight stay in a room at the brothel, if you know what I mean. Dayavan uses the room to sleep off his night of drinking and is awakened, as is so commonly the case, by the innocent prostitute, who is quietly, yet intensely studying for her exams. He gives her money to continue her studies, and leaves her untouched. Now doesn’t this remind you of the class and flair of what you’d imagine the Khanna’s to be like in real life? Anyway, I suppose I mentioned just then that Madhuri Dixit was in the film and I found it a waste of her talent since she really didn’t dance too much and her role was too brief. Kya waste hai! Here’s a taste of her dancing in a Holi number.\n\nI don’t like seeing other people kissing, since it’s so private, so Hindi movies are perfect for me. Dayavan has a famous kissing scene between Madhuri and Vinood, in fact if you google videos for the film, the kissing scene is most prominent and you can see it here if you’re inclined. If you watch it please make note of how unconvincing Madhuri’s hands are in the scene, which reveals to me she was not comfortable filming it. I mean wouldn’t most women have more gusto in their grasp if sharing a moment with Vinod Khanna?\n\nLet’s end with a few more memorable screen captures & subtitles from Dayavan:\n\nDouble point for me here, since the screen cap includes a subtitle with dacoity (which is even better than dacoitery in my book) and a lone bottle of Johnnie Walker black label, which is obviously better than red label, isn’t it? Look at Vinod Khanna’s intensity here when someone comes to him to get justice: Did I mention that Feroz Khan is in the movie? Seems like I’ve ignored him, but here he is, handling business!\n\nAnd handing out a little vigilante justice, which I know chandelier connoisseur Shweta will enjoy:\n\nDuring the course of the film, Dayavan’s daughter (Amala)avoids him due to his illegal work, and ironically she marries a police officer played by Aditya Pancholi, who is cheated, since she declared herself an orphan.\n\nI don’t think there’s anything wrong with declaring ourselves orphans now and again. Dayavan is a remake of the Tamil film called Nayagan (1987). Have you seen the movie in its original Tamilian form? I want to see it now in its pure form! Since I’ve focused on Vinood Khanna here, I must throw a bit of attention on his sons, Rahul and Akshaye, to balance out my Khanna-o-Rama contribution. I will ask you the ask the timeless question that Briyanshu posed: Rahul or Akshaye? HERE’S THE ANSWER. Now I command you to click on this feast of Khanna-o-Rama blog posts to fulfill all of your Khanna Family desires.\n\nRead Full Post »"
