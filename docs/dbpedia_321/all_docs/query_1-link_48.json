        "text": "Severe weather is forecast in Russia's Central Federal District through at least late June 20, with the greatest impacts occurring in Moscow. Severe thunderstorms are forecast beginning in the early hours of June 20, likely bringing heavy downpours, strong wind gusts, lightning, and hail to affected areas. Although authorities have not published rainfall estimates, meteorologists estimate that rainfall totals may exceed Moscow's single-day record of 3.2 cm (1.3 inches). Winds gusting up to 83 kph (52 mph) are expected across the affected area.\n\nThe Hydrometcenter of Russia has issued the following weather warnings:\n\nOrange heavy rain, wind gust, and thunderstorm warnings (the second-highest level on a four-tier scale): Moscow City.\n\nYellow heavy rain, wind gust, and thunderstorm warnings: Belgorod, Bryansk, Kaluga, Kursk, Moscow, Oryol, Ryazan, Tula, Tver, Vladimir, and Voronezh oblasts.\n\nOfficials may update and/or extend the coverage of weather alerts over the coming days.\n\nSustained heavy rainfall could trigger flash and areal flooding in affected areas. Such flooding is possible in low-lying communities near watercourses and other large bodies of water and in urban areas with easily overwhelmed stormwater drainage systems. Sites downstream of large reservoirs may be subject to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall.\n\nFloodwaters and related debris may render some bridges, rail networks, or roadways impassable, impacting overland travel in and around the affected area. Flooding in urban areas could also result in significant traffic congestion. Disruptive weather may cause delays and cancellations at regional airports. Flooding could block regional rail lines; freight and passenger train delays and cancellations are possible in areas that see heavy rainfall and potential track blockages.\n\nDisruptions triggered by inclement weather and resultant hazards, such as flooding or strong winds, could persist well after conditions have improved. It could take days before floodwaters recede and/or officials clear debris. Repair or reconstruction efforts may result in residual disruptions if there is severe damage to infrastructure."
