        "text": "About 2,000 people have protested against a church being built on a park square in Yekaterinburg in Russia.\n\nTwenty-six people were arrested during Tuesday's clashes and there were further protests on Wednesday.\n\nActivists say building St Catherine's Cathedral on the square will destroy one of the city's few green spaces.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church says it needs new churches to replace the many buildings destroyed under Soviet anti-religion laws.\n\nThis particular church will be a replica of one such cathedral that was demolished in 1930.\n\nIt is due to be completed in 2023 in time for the 300th anniversary of the founding of Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday criticised the protesters for \"unauthorised gatherings\" as well as for pulling down fencing around the construction site.\n\nFollowing a call on social media, thousands of residents got together \"for a stroll\" on the Iset river embankment in the centre of the city on Monday.\n\nThe protesters gathered near a temporary fence that had been erected around a section of the park, marking off the space where the church is supposed to be built.\n\nThey formed a human chain around the fence and, eventually, managed to topple it, while chanting: \"We want a square.\"\n\nAs the crowds made their way into the park, they were confronted by security guards hired by Russian Copper Company (RCC) - which is sponsoring the construction of the church - as well as some Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighters apparently linked to the company's Academy of Martial Arts.\n\nAmong the pro-church fighters was Ivan Shtyrkov, also known as the Ural Hulk - a professional MMA fighter and head of the RCC's academy.\n\nProtests continued through the night, and throughout the following day.\n\nThe regional public security ministry says 26 people were arrested and reports say three were taken to hospital, including one with a broken rib.\n\nProtests against the church continued on Wednesday, as activists tied themselves to trees and a new fence was erected around the site.\n\nBy Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow\n\nThree days of protests in Russia involving hundreds of people is rare enough to be significant.\n\nThe laws have grown much tighter under President Vladimir Putin, with unauthorised gatherings quickly broken up by police. This time they have been backed up by burly MMA fighters. That move alone has angered the crowds and commentators.\n\nBut the focus of this dispute adds to its interest.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church has grown increasingly powerful as part of the search for a post-Soviet \"national idea\" and identity.\n\nSome 10,000 new churches have been built in the past decade, supposedly to meet growing public demand. The Yekaterinburg protesters insist they're not anti-religious, as they have been labelled: they are against this cathedral, in this spot, fighting for their city environment.\n\nThere has been a notable surge in local activism with campaigns on issues from road-building to waste disposal - as overtly political protests have faded.\n\nThey also seem sparked by a desire to stand up to powerful interests: the Church and big business.\n\nSo Moscow, ever wary, will be keeping an eye on events.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday praised local authorities for brokering talks over the dispute. He also criticised the protesters for \"actions that are against the law\".\n\nHe added that the protest \"could only have been organised by people driven by anti-religious motives\".\n\nRepresentatives from the Church took part in emergency closed-door meetings with activists, convened by Yevgeny Kuivashev, the governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast.\n\nMr Kipshidze said that while the Church was in favour of constructive dialogue with the protesters, these discussions should not include people who \"simply cannot tolerate anything connected to religion\"."
