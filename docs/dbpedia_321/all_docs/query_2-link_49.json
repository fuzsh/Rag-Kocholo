        "text": "What is this?\n\nThis is the only web application dedicated to showing barometric pressure histories, forecasts and maps for any location in the world.\n\nWho is this for?\n\nHumans: Barometric pressure fluctuations can lead to migraine headaches, joint pain, arthritis symptoms, and blood pressure changes among other physical changes in the human body. Some people can predict weather patterns due to their bodies’ responses to changes in pressure. It can help to know in advance when the pressure will change in order to make lifestyle or medication adjustments beforehand, which is where this forecast graph can be helpful!\n\nMeteorologists: Barometric pressure, also known as atmospheric pressure, is a leading indicator for inclement weather. Generally, low pressure systems are associated with cooler temperatures, precipitation, wind and storms.\n\nFishermen: Some fish respond to changes in barometric pressure and can change their level of feeding activity when pressure is dropping. Thus, fishermen might avoid fishing when pressure is dropping and seek out times to fish before or after those periods.\n\nWhere does this data come from?\n\nThe weather data comes from the Apple WeatherKit weather data API. The map view is from Windy.com. If the data in your area are inaccurate or unavailable, that’s probably an issue with a data source, but please let us know by leaving a feedback message (at the bottom of the page) so we can check on it!\n\nIs there a mobile app?\n\nYes, but probably not the way you think. Barometricpressure.app is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), meaning that it can be downloaded onto your device directly from your browser and accessed just as you would access any other app on your device. That means that you can install this app to your iPhone, Android device, tablet or even a desktop computer! Check out the following link to learn more:\n\nInstructions on how to download a PWA\n\nHow can I save my location?\n\nThere are two ways to access the data for a specific location more quickly:\n\nClick the ☆ icon to the left of the title on your location's data page to add it to your 'favorites' list. Your favorite locations will appear on the home page in future visits.\n\nSave the URL of your location's data page to your browser's favorites or bookmarks folder.\n\nThe app is not working for me. What should I do?\n\nWe apologize for that. We are running this app on a shoestring budget while we’re trying to get it off the ground, so sometimes we hit our allotted data limits with our data providers. Check back again after some time and it should work. Either way, please leave us some feedback so we can help if you are experiencing problems by clicking on the “Feedback” link, below."
