        "meta_description": "Abstract. Extreme droughts are weather phenomena of considerable\nimportance, involving significant environmental and societal impacts. While\nthose that have occurred in the comparatively recent period of instrumental\nmeasurement are identified and dated on the basis of systematic,\nmachine-standardized meteorological and hydrological observations, droughts\nthat took place in the pre-instrumental period are usually described only\nthrough the medium of documentary evidence. The extreme drought of 1842 in\nEurope presents a case in which information from documentary data can be\ncombined with systematic instrumental observations. Seasonal, gridded\nEuropean precipitation totals are used herein to describe general DJF, MAM,\nand JJA precipitation patterns. Annual variations in monthly temperatures\nand precipitation at individual stations are expressed with respect to a\n1961â1990 reference period, supplemented by calculation of selected drought\nindices (Standardized Precipitation Index, SPI; Standardized Precipitation\nEvapotranspiration Index, SPEI; and Palmer ZÂ index). The mean circulation patterns\nduring the driest months are elucidated by means of sea-level pressure (SLP) maps, the North\nAtlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), and the Central European\nZonal Index (CEZI). Generally drier patterns in 1842 prevailed in JanuaryâFebruary and\nat various intensities between April and August. The driest patterns in 1842\noccurred in a broad zonal belt extending from France to eastern central\nEurope. A range of documentary data is used to describe the peculiarities of\nagricultural, hydrological, and socio-economic droughts, with particular\nattention to environmental and societal impacts and human responses to them.\nAlthough overall grain yields were not very strongly influenced, a\nparticularly bad hay harvest, no aftermath (hay from a second cut), and low\npotato yields led to severe problems, especially for those who raised\ncattle. Finally, the 1842 drought is discussed in terms of long-term drought\nvariability, European tree-ring-based scPDSI (self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index) reconstruction, and the broader\ncontext of societal impacts.",

        "text": "4.1.2âAnnual variations in temperature, precipitation, and drought indices\n\nFluctuations in daily mean temperatures and daily precipitation totals during 1842 at the Prague-Klementinum station appear in Fig.Â 4. Compared with the 1961â1990 reference period, temperatures remained below their corresponding means for the greater part of the year, particularly in January and February, the first part of April, and at the turn of October/November. A very consistent cold period persisted from the second half of September to early December. Clearly warmer patterns compared to the 30-year mean occurred only in August (Fig.Â 4a). The highest daily precipitation total achieved only 13.8âmm, on 8Â June. The deficit in precipitation totals, continuously growing from mid-April to the end of 1842, finally reached 215âmm compared to the 30-year mean of 470âmm (Fig.Â 4b). From around AprilÂ 1842 to the end of the year, cumulative precipitation figures were below the value for the 5th percentile of the 1961â1990 period. Helping to complete the picture, the annual frequency of precipitation days with a total of â¥0.1âmm in 1842 achieved 126âd compared with the mean of 151.7âd in 1961â1990. In terms of frequencies of days with totals of 0.1â1.0, 1.1â5.0, 5.1â10.0, and â¥10.1âmm, the differences in precipitation days between 1842 and the reference period were at their highest for the last-mentioned interval (2âd against 10.4âd). During the driest period, from April to AugustÂ 1842, only 30 precipitation days were recorded compared with 67.7âd in the 1961â1990 period. August was outstandingly dry with only 2 precipitation days compared to the mean of 13âd for this month.\n\nDocumentary sources usually report extended periods without rain or when the first rain falls after a dry period. For example, on Greenock and Glasgow in Scotland, renowned even in that proverbially moist land for their damp and rainy nature, not a single raindrop fell in the whole of April (Wiener Zeitung, 28Â MayÂ 1842). In central Transylvania the SiebenbÃ¼rger Bote (26Â MayÂ 1842) reported a drought that lasted until 22â25Â May, when torrential rain led to a flash flood, but in other areas drought continued without the usual late-May rain (ErdÃ©lyi HÃ­radÃ³, 21Â JuneÂ 1842). To emphasize the extremity of such weather, reports often add information about high temperatures. For example, a story dated 1Â September from Trieste in Italy reported that since mid-June there had been virtually no rainfall in the vicinity and temperatures were almost constantly between 22 and 25â RÃ©aumur (â R), i.e. 27.5â31.2ââC (Journal de Bruxelles, 15Â SeptemberÂ 1842). In Troitsk, Russia, not a drop of rain fell from the end of June onwards and on 27Â July temperatures rose to 28 to 32â R (i.e. 35â40ââC). This heat, together with dry westerly winds, desiccated the soil to a depth of 150âcm (Le Messager de Gand, 19Â OctoberÂ 1842). Although such daily entries have been reported for many European places, they lack sufficient systematic character to cite.\n\nTo examine the annual structure of weather in 1842, certain European meteorological stations or regions were selected to describe temperature and precipitation on the basis of monthly values (Fig.Â 5). Despite existing regional differences, cooler and drier patterns prevailed in JanuaryâFebruary. After above-normal March precipitation, dry patterns prevailed at various degrees of intensity from April to August. August was also the month with the highest positive temperature deviation.\n\nStations and regions appearing in Fig.Â 5 (except for the Swiss Plateau, which was replaced by Vienna because data were absent) were used to calculate drought indices expressing the actual drought, namely SPI-1, SPEI-1, and ZÂ index (Fig.Â 6). Indices are expressed in real values and their negative figures reflect drier patterns. While SPI-1, expressing variations of precipitation totals, indicates a great lack of precipitation (e.g. see the lowest values for April in Stockholm and for August in Warsaw), SPEI-1 combines the effects of precipitation with temperatures, from which evapotranspiration is estimated. However, annual variations in both SPI-1 and SPEI-1 indices are very similar. The third indicator, the ZÂ index, used for calculation of the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and representing soil moisture patterns, tends to show a consistent dry period, as seen for JJA in Trieste and AMJJA in Paris, Karlsruhe, and Vienna, as well as the Czech Lands, for which generally increasing intensity from April to August is apparent. In Edinburgh, the drought persisted unremittingly from April to December. In order to present the accumulated effects of drought, SPI, and SPEI values for 3, 6, and 9Â months were also calculated (see Figs.Â S2 andÂ S3). Compared with Fig.Â 6, the features of drought are well preserved but annual variation in indices is more smoothed, partly shifted to the second half of the year, and demonstrating a degree of persistence of drought patterns.\n\n4.3.1âHydrological drought\n\nThe weather patterns of 1842 were reflected in low water levels and discharges on several rivers. For example, the daily water levels of the river Danube at Vienna, published regularly in Wiener Zeitung, were recorded for the main river at the Great Danube Bridge as well as on the river channel (see Sect.Â 2.2). Since both profiles express identical changes, Fig.Â 9 shows fluctuations in daily water levels at the bridge profile in 1842 in comparison with the corresponding levels from 1841 and 1843. After very low water levels in JanuaryâFebruary 1842, related to the channels being frozen over, water levels were below those of the 2 adjacent years in JuneâJuly and then from mid-August to around the beginning of November with a very strongly expressed declining trend. A further considerable decrease appeared around mid-December. The mean annual discharge of 3342âm3âsâ1 for the year 1842 is the 11th lowest value in the long-term annual series of Danube discharges at Vienna in the 1828â2011 period. Tendencies similar to those observed in Vienna are recorded for the Danube at Budapest: from not particularly high water levels in May and June, there was a steady decrease with a particular drop in early July; water levels then continued to remain somewhat low, although with minimal decrease. Very low water levels appeared in December (Nemzeti ÃjsÃ¡g, 21Â DecemberÂ 1842).\n\nOn the river Vltava in Prague, very low discharges were recorded during a dry January and February period (48 and 46âm3âsâ1 respectively). After a steep increase to the annual maximum in March (255âm3âsâ1), they began to decrease (the most dramatic drop â by 119âm3âsâ1 â occurred between April and May) to their lowest values in JulyâSeptember, with the annual minimum in August (35âm3âsâ1). A slight increase followed (NovotnÃ½, 1963). Very low water stages were also recorded on the river Elbe, with epigraphic testimony appearing as a mark for 1842 on the hunger stone at DÄÄÃ­n-Podmokly in Bohemia (see Fig.Â 1). The emergence of a similar hunger stone on the German part of the Elbe in Dresden and âthe near disappearanceâ of this river around Pirna was also reported in Lemberger Zeitung (9Â SeptemberÂ 1842). The waters of the rivers in south-eastern Poland ran at unusually low levels and some rivers even dried out (Szewczuk, 1939). The exceedingly low water level recorded for the river Tisza in Szeged (Hungary) in 1842 later became the zero point for water level measurements at that point (BotÃ¡r and KÃ¡rolyi, 1971). Records of daily water levels there suggested a steady decrease from April with the lowest values in August and September (AS1). On the river Seine at Paris, the water level dropped for 52âd below the zero point on the Pont de la Tournelle scale, established already during an extraordinary drought in 1719 (Belgrand, 1872).\n\nLow water levels in the Lake FertÅ/Neusiedl, today located on the AustrianâHungarian border, were also noted for 1842 (ÃlÅ, 1937); the planning and ground investigations for the drainage of the southern Balaton wetlands, which usually took place at times of low water level, were carried out in this year (Szaplonczay, 1914).\n\nA very rich body of documentary sources report a general lack of water in 1842, when many wells and springs dried out. Brooks and small watercourses ran dry. In Ãlvkarleby (near GÃ¤vle, Sweden), one arm of a waterfall dried out completely and the main arm carried so little water that it was possible to cross it on foot (Wiener Zeitung, 21Â OctoberÂ 1842). Absence of water on even large rivers led to interference with commercial ship transport for several months. In France, shipping on the river Seine at Paris was disrupted for around 4 months (Fuster, 1845). A newspaper story dated 29 June from Regensburg (Germany) reports that the Bayern-WÃ¼rttemberg Steam Navigation Company cancelled a cruise on the river Danube (Linzer Zeitung, 6Â JulyÂ 1842). A similar situation pertained to almost all the usually navigable German rivers. From Dresden, reports indicate that transport on the river Elbe was suspended on 11Â July. Cessation of steamship traffic is also reported for the river Main at Frankfurt am Main on 5Â July, and a similar situation was mentioned for the river Moselle (Allgemeine PreuÃische Staats-Zeitung, 9Â and 14Â JulyÂ 1842). The ferry between Rotterdam and Venlo (the Netherlands) had to be suspended due to persistent low water levels on the river Maas or Meuse which âwill became non-navigable if the current unprecedented drought does not cease soonâ (Algemeen Handelsblad, 2Â SeptemberÂ 1842, p. 1). As the drought went on, the levels of the river Weser in north-western Germany fell into a state not seen for 200Â years. An enormous quantity of dead fish led to a foul odour of putrefaction and their remains had to be removed by the cartload (L'IndÃ©pendance Belge, 2Â SeptemberÂ 1842). It was possible to wade across even such large rivers.\n\nProblems arising out of scarcity of water were especially acute in towns and cities. When a general and urgent lack of drinking water started to occur in Middelburg, the capital of the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands, the town authorities found themselves obliged to send a ship to âmainlandâ Holland on 8Â June in order to provide it (Nederlandsche Staatscourant, 11Â JuneÂ 1842). According to a report from the city of Goes on the island of Zuid-Beveland (the Netherlands), dated 13Â June, good drinking water was so scarce that many people were using bad water and adverse health consequences were feared (Vlissingsche Courant, 17Â JuneÂ 1842). Because the flat islands in the south-west of the Netherlands are surrounded by seawater and tidal rivers, and have no freshwater rivers or lakes, they are vulnerable to drought. Their situation, therefore, may be worse than that in other parts of the Netherlands. However, the mayors of other Dutch cities such as Breda (Bredasche courant, 14Â AugustÂ 1842) and The Hague (Dagblad vanÂ 's Gravenhage, 19Â AugustÂ 1842) took measures to limit the use of water. A report that appeared on 31 August indicated that one had to travel 7 miles (ca. 51âkm) from Hamburg (Germany) to GlÃ¼ckstadt, higher up the Elbe, or 4 miles (ca. 29âkm) to Stade for drinking water because local springs were completely dry and the lower Elbe water was too brackish to be used for drinking (Algemeen Handelsblad, 5Â SeptemberÂ 1842). Even the Alps had water problems, as reported, for example, in Stuttgart (Germany) on 20Â April (Allgemeine PreuÃische Staats-Zeitung, 27Â AugustÂ 1842, p. 1015): âThe worst [of it] is for the inhabitants of the Alps, where a lack of water has achieved the highest degree, and true caravans with water tanks travel several hours [down] to valleys to ensure necessary water.â In Trieste (Italy), based on a report dated 1Â September, more than 300 public water points (âfountainsâ) were dry. Serving maids were forced to wait for hours at the few fountains that still had water before they could fill their buckets (Journal de Bruxelles, 15Â SeptemberÂ 1842).\n\nLack of water was fatal to the operation of water mills and many were simply forced out of operation. A concise description of the problems facing milling was given by the chronicler VÃ¡clav Krolmus for Bohemia (Krolmus, 1845, pp. 127â128): âTwo-thirds of [water] mills were standing [idle in the] drought. It went badly for milling; lone [i.e. isolated] millers sought mills on larger rivers where they could grind grain for their own houses. People had to travel 6â7 hours to distant rivers such as the Elbe, Jizera, Vltava, OhÅe and MÅ¾e [now Berounka]. Further, [even] on large rivers, millers were forced to allow time for sufficient water to build up and people had to wait several weeks [for milling]; all this was all the more [valid] on brooks that had only weak and tiny active springs. At that time millers in some places bought water from the large ponds owned by the nobility and collected enough to make milling for a few hours possible. Millers milled for one another.â\n\n4.3.2âAgricultural drought\n\nWhen addressing plant growth, documentary sources tend to give preferential attention to rain events and their abundance. For example, Anton PejÅ¡ek from ZlonÄice (Bohemia) mentioned the drought of 1842 and problems for crops in these terms in several cases: the first rain of spring on 4Â June wetted the soil to a depth of 1 (Vienna) inch (ca. 2.6âcm). As late as 2Â August, the soil was wetted to the extent of âa tiny little furrowâ; on 17Â September this grew to three-quarters of a furrow and by 2Â October had extended to the whole furrow so that autumn sowing went well (Robek, 1958a). Lack of rain was the anticipated forerunner of a bad harvest, as documented by the French La Patrie (16Â JuneÂ 1842, p. 3): âOrdinarily, says the Patriote de la Meurthe et des Vosges [at Nancy], the month of June is rainy in our countryside; this is not the case this year: the pleasant weather is a real calamity. For two months, hardly a drop of water has fallen on our plains and in our valleys. Hay harvesting will be less productive than a year ago. Wheat suffers from this pitiless drought; the vine alone maintains a beautiful appearance. May we soon see some clouds in this sky, the [constant] serenity [of which] is desperate.â A similar situation was reported from north-eastern England (The Morning Chronicle, 23Â JuneÂ 1842, p. 6): âthe crops are light, and if we are not favoured with moisture from the clouds in a short time, the whole of the hay crop will prove extremely bad; pastures are scalding and feed is much wanted â the potatoes and turnips have an unhealthy appearance, the former past recovery â the spring crops may be a fair average if they receive sufficient moisture by the end of the week.â\n\nThe impacts of droughts in agriculture are particularly reflected in crop yields. For example, documentary sources from the Czech Lands reported the following for 1842: weaker yields of barley and oats (the ears were sometimes so sparse and small that they had to be been harvested manually, without tools); wheat and rye yields were generally average depending on location; lack of straw, which was already short in the stem; failure of potatoes (â[potatoes] were the size of walnuts and almost inedible, [more like] overgrown peasâ; Robek, 1978, p. 49); a meagre harvest of vegetables (peas, lentils, cabbages), flax, beet, vetch, and hops; unripe fruits fell from their trees early; it was impossible to plough, and stubble fields remained unturned after the harvest. There was a generally small yield of hay and no aftermath (i.e. the second hay growth). A report dated 1Â September from Trieste (Italy) noted that all the plants had died and trees were even losing their leaves as if it were already autumn (Journal de Bruxelles, 15Â SeptemberÂ 1842). Further east, in the KoÅ¡ice area of Slovakia, cabbages and potatoes were in a poor state in the first days of September due to extended heat and outstanding drought (Nemzeti ÃjsÃ¡g, 10Â September Â 1842); problems with the late development and a bad harvest of potatoes due to drought were also mentioned in VerÅce and Miskolc in Hungary (Nemzeti ÃjsÃ¡g, 13Â and 26Â NovemberÂ 1842).\n\nHowever, regional differences in yields could be quite marked. Records from Hungary (as then politically defined) indicate that the harvest of both winter and spring crops was weak, except in the most significant grain production areas in the southern and eastern parts of the Great Hungarian Plain, particularly the BaÄka (north Serbia) and the Banat (north-eastern Serbia and south-western Romania) regions (Jelenkor, 3Â SeptemberÂ 1842). While rather bad cereal and hay harvests were reported in the northern part of the plain (e.g. Nemzeti ÃjsÃ¡g, 10Â SeptemberÂ 1842), reports from around KecskemÃ©t in its central part indicate that maize, barley, and oat harvests were not good; chronicles kept by Franciscan monks suggest a lack of these crops, while remaining silent about other harvests in 1842 (SzabÃ³, 1992). In the Bratislava area of Slovakia in late July, when harvesters' wages were fixed, the spring crops were particularly bad, while the winter crops showed little promise over large areas (Jelenkor, 30Â JulyÂ 1842). Moreover, in Å ariÅ¡ County (north-eastern Slovakia), hail destroyed the harvests of more than 40 settlements (Jelenkor, 27Â AugustÂ 1842).\n\nYields of grain also suffered from a population explosion of mice and hamsters. Some villages in the Mainz region (Germany) were driven to pay bounty on them. Similar overpopulation problems were reported for other regions of Germany, such as the Rhine region, Saxony, Thuringia, and Lower Franconia (Beyer, 1843), but damage done by an overabundance of rodents was also reported in Hungarian SzekszÃ¡rd (Nemzeti ÃjsÃ¡g, 19Â OctoberÂ 1842). In Auchterarder (Scotland), farmers lived in fear of âmyriads of small white wormsâ which were capable of damaging all kinds of vegetables in time of drought (The Morning Chronicle, 23Â JuneÂ 1842, p. 6). Another interesting manifestation of insect overpopulation was reported from the Netherlands, where farmers in some places were unable to plough their fields in the face of a drought-facilitated multitude of wasps' nests (Nederlandsche Staatscourant, 18Â AugustÂ 1842). In NeuchÃ¢tel, Switzerland, warnings appeared in September of the potential for overpopulation of wasps (due to the warm, dry summer) with respect to the damage that they might do to grapes (Wiener Zeitung, 20Â SeptemberÂ 1842).\n\nIn contrast to their negative influence on many other agricultural crops, high temperatures with drier patterns may prove positive to the quality of wine. Reports from Alsace (France) indicate that the grapes had to be picked and the soil bored in the dry times which lasted from mid-January to August. The cultivators had to use wedge-shaped hoes to split and pulverize soil so hard that it often damaged the tools. Because the vines themselves and other crops suffered heavily from the drought, the harvest was mediocre, or worse, in quantity; however, the wine was of excellent quality (Liblin, 1872). Beyond France, wine of excellent quality was also reported from other European countries such as Bohemia (Katzerowsky, 1895) and Moravia (DrÃ¶ssler, 1933). Generally ample harvests of grapes were also reported in Hungary (e.g. in VeszprÃ©m, Budapest; Nemzeti ÃjsÃ¡g, 19Â October and 8Â NovemberÂ 1842), but in most areas this held true for quantity rather than quality. Hailstorms, cold winds, and a rainy period from mid-September onwards were blamed for the medium quality in most places (e.g. Eger, KÅszeg, VerÅce, NagykÃ¡llÃ³, or ZemplÃ­n in Slovakia).\n\n4.3.3âSocio-economic drought\n\nThe problems with lack of water described in Sect.Â 4.3.1 andÂ 4.3.2 also found reflections in socio-economic matters. That more frequent fires were reported for 1842 in several documentary sources is testimony to such negative effects. A catastrophic example may be found in the GroÃe Brand (âGreat Fireâ) of Hamburg. After several weeks of extreme drought, fire broke out on 5Â May at 01:00âLT (local time) which âtook until the morning of 8 May to extinguishâ (for a detailed description, see Schleiden, 1843). As Germany's most serious peacetime fire in modern history, it destroyed a third of the old town, with 72Â streets, around 1100Â houses, and 102Â granaries. There were 51Â fatalities, 120Â people were injured, and 19â995Â people were made homeless (Hamburger Feuerwehr-Historiker E.Â V., 2005). An account of a fire in RzeszÃ³w (Poland) on the night 26/27Â June notes: âthere was no rain for many days and roofs were so dry that each spark could lead to a devastating fireâ (Wiener Zeitung, 10Â JulyÂ 1842, p. 1413). Lack of water complicated firefighting. For example, during a fire that broke out on 14Â June in ZlonÄice in Bohemia, wells held so little water that people could only stand by and watch the conflagration with no means of extinguishing it (Robek, 1958a); a similar situation occurred during a fire on 23Â August inÂ KrÃ¡lova Lhota (Robek, 1978). In Austria, fire broke out on 17Â July in Korneuburg; what water remained in the wells after a long, dry, and warm period was soon exhausted and three small lakes nearby were of little help (Wiener Zeitung, 21Â JulyÂ 1842).\n\nThe year 1842 also stands out in records of forest fires from many sources. For example, in the BrannÃ¡ domain (the Moravian part of Silesia), fire broke out on 17 August in the Liechtenstein Forest, burning for several days at the expense of over 2000 fathoms (ca. 5680âm3) of timber; it had still not been extinguished on 26Â August (Diekircher Wochenblatt, 10Â SeptemberÂ 1842). BlaseÂ (1845) reported in great detail a forest fire that started on 31Â August in âSaxon-Bohemian Switzerlandâ and went on to destroy a forest area of 327 âAckerâ (ca. 181âha), of which 172 âAckerâ were on the Saxon side and 155 on the Bohemian side (ca. 95.2 and 85.8âha, respectively). A number of reports of August forest fires also appear for Norway (e.g. MÃ¼nchner politische Zeitung, 26Â AugustÂ 1842; Wiener Zeitung, 15Â SeptemberÂ 1842).\n\nA general idea of the statistical scale of city and forest fires occurring in the generally driest period of AprilâSeptemberÂ 1842 may be obtained if reports appearing only in Wiener Zeitung are considered. These indicate a total of 68 concrete cases of fire elsewhere in Europe nevertheless considered newsworthy by an Austrian newspaper (in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Lands, Germany, Hungary, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Sweden, and England). Nine of the stories explicitly mention drought or lack of water. Moreover, in addition to such precisely localized fires, more general statements about further fires in the given region or country also appear (for example, a despatch from Paris, dated 28Â September, makes wider mention of daily fires in the Seine-et-Marne region; see Wiener Zeitung, 7Â OctoberÂ 1842).\n\nThe general lack of water (Sect.Â 4.3.1) had many further consequences. Water mills unable to operate led to a lack of flour for baking bread with inevitable shortages and consequent price rises. Lack of milling capacity meant that the grist was ground rough rather than finer milled to flour. An attempt at using man-power to turn the mills in Saxony employed 8â10 men, who managed to grind one âDresdner Viertelâ (ca. 27âL of grain) in 2âh (Beyer, 1843). The Dresden administration sent steam engines to its two most important mills and horse-powered gins to several others (Wiener Zeitung, 18Â SeptemberÂ 1842). Citing the acute lack of flour, Vincenz Rohn in LitomÄÅice (Bohemia) obtained permission to build a steam mill there (Katzerowsky, 1895). In Aachen (Germany) and neighbouring parts of Belgium, weaving factories were limited by water shortage and human power was used to maintain at least part of their production (Allgemeine PreuÃische Staats-Zeitung, 22Â JulyÂ 1842).\n\nDried-up water sources were also indicated by military records in that they were cited as reasons for the cancellation of manoeuvres, as reported on 20Â August from Berlin in Germany (Wiener Zeitung, 3Â SeptemberÂ 1842, p. 1807): â[due to] incessant heat and a considerable shortage of water, [â¦ ] the consequences of a winter without snow and of a dry spring [â¦ ] wells and small lakes are entirely dry at a majority of settlements and people are having to bring water from great distances. [This indicates] that the cavalry can expect to find no watering places; [since water] would have to be made available at campsites, manoeuvres were completely cancelled on the evening before muster.â Similarly, a report from DÃ¼sseldorf a day earlier mentioned that if the very hot and dry weather conditions did not change, then the military manoeuvres already taking place would be significantly curtailed (Wiener Zeitung, 26Â AugustÂ 1842).\n\nThe problems associated with lack of water impact upon animals as well as people. For example, the âBook of Memoryâ for HeÅmanovice (northern Moravia) reports that coachmen took containers of water for their horses from Bohemia to Silesia because most of the wells and streams there were dry (AS3). On 15Â June, people in Emden (Germany) gave voice to a host of complaints about a lack of water. The ports and waterways had to be flushed with seawater, so all the city canals in their neighbourhood had become salty and therefore useless for cattle or irrigating the vegetable gardens around the city (Algemeen Handelsblad, 26Â JuneÂ 1842).\n\nSmall yields of hay and no aftermath (Sect.Â 4.3.2) led to a critical situation for those who raised cattle. A desperate lack of forage meant that farmers were forced to sell off livestock at prices deeply below the normal market rates or to slaughter livestock for meat. In some cases, livestock numbers dropped to a half or even a third of previous numbers. This was especially true of cattle and sheep. Although, whenever possible, farmers found substitute forage (e.g. vetch, tree foliage), the immediate market effects were substantial. For example, the records kept by VÃ¡clav KÅeÄek from DobruÅ¡ka (Bohemia) note (Robek, 1978, pp. 49â50): âa cow, which was [worth] 100 gulden a year ago, went [in 1842] for 40 or 50 gulden, and it was not possible to sell [a cow] to anyone because of too little fodder. A two-year heifer could be bought for 20 gulden, maximally 25 gulden, while a year ago [the price for such a beast] was 50, or even as much as 60 gulden. [â¦] Older cows could be bought for 25 or 30 gulden.â In the former Hungarian domain of LevoÄa (now Slovakia), an irrigation system for meadows and gardens was introduced in 1842 in an attempt to alleviate any future droughts (ÃrkÃ¶vy, 1863; see also Magyar Gazda, 24Â NovemberÂ 1842).\n\nTown and city administrations were also obliged to address the critical scarcity of water. For example, on 6Â June, the council of the city of Bruges (Belgium) forbade the washing or cleaning of the streets, pavements, houses, and windows âuntil further noticeâ (Gazette van Brugge, 6Â JuneÂ 1842, p. 2). The mayor and municipal executive of the city of Middelburg, Zeeland in the Netherlands, in consideration of the most economical use of the water, decided to forbid sanding the streets, the pavements, and houses, and the washing of windows (Middelburgsche Courant, 11Â AugustÂ 1842). In Haarlem (the Netherlands), it was announced on 19Â August that the city and neighbourhood pumps will remain closed at night and would be opened for only 2 hours a day for residents. The inhabitants were furthermore enjoined to use water sparingly and to use it as little as possible to rinse and scrub the streets and pavements (Algemeen Handelsblad, 22Â AugustÂ 1842).\n\nThe governor of the province of West Flanders (Belgium) adopted quite drastic measures to conserve water. He imposed restrictions on the use of the locks on the river Yser and its associated canals. In particular, in consideration of petitions from local authorities concerned at the scarcity of water in the interior, the usual drainage and flushing of the canals was to be delayed fromÂ 1 until 20Â September (Gazette van Brugge, 17 and 24Â AugustÂ 1842).\n\nTo minimize the danger of fire during prolonged dry weather, the mayor and municipal executive of the city of Rotterdam (the Netherlands) decided that any pyrotechnics, such as aerial candle lanterns, flares, or fireworks, would not be permitted (Rotterdamsche Courant, 9Â AugustÂ 1842). On 17Â August, the equivalent city authorities in The Hague decided, bearing in mind the catastrophic consequences of a possible fire, to prevent many city pumps providing sufficient water for scrubbing the streets and similar work (Dagblad vanÂ 's Gravenhage, 19Â AugustÂ 1842). Reported in Hungarian Szeged, smoking a pipe was not permitted due to the heat and drought (Reizner, 1899).\n\nThere was an interesting consequence of the 1842 drought in the southern part of the basin of FertÅ/Neusiedl in Hungary. Low water levels allowed archaeological explorations that resulted in new âprehistoricâ findings in the temporarily dry part of its extensive shallow lake basin (ÃlÅ, 1937).\n\nGreat heat and drought, particularly in AugustÂ 1842, contributed to certain illnesses, particularly respiratory but also including fevers and malaria, as described by the local medical officer in Uzhhorod (Ukraine) in the former Hungarian county of Ung (see Sect.Â 2.1, point vi).\n\nSocial reflections of the 1842 drought may be found in practices of religious institutions such as the organization of masses, prayers, and formal public processions to entreat God for rain. For example, from Munich (Germany) on 2Â July, regular processions of entreaty for rain are reported from the countryside, as well as one planned also in town in the coming days (Allgemeine PreuÃische Staats-Zeitung, 8Â JulyÂ 1842). On 17Â June and on 18Â August, the bishop of Bruges (Belgium) decreed prayers for rain (Middelburgsche Courant, 18Â JuneÂ 1842; Gazette van Brugge, 19Â AugustÂ 1842). In Antwerp (Belgium), public prayers started on 26Â August in all the city's churches, although some rain had fallen, because the drought remained âfearfulâ for people and animals. In the neighbourhood of Zandhoven, it was decided that houses should no longer be sanded for fear of shortage of drinking water, as all the wells were dry (Gazette van Brugge, 29Â AugustÂ 1842). In HostÃ­n, Bohemia, Josef VorlÃ­Äek reported frequent masses and prayers for rain, as well as the occasional procession of entreaty in 1842, but he thought âthat God has blocked his ears and does not hear our voiceâ (Robek, 1958b, p. IV/28). Considerably more curious was an explanation offered for the lack of rain in the MladÃ¡ Boleslav region (Bohemia): âIt is said that it is not raining because the last time someone died in Plasy, they put a little down blanket under the dear departed's head and said that if the feathers did not rot, it would not rainâ (Kamper, 1927â1928, p. 247).\n\nMore seriously, the drought of 1842 was considered a consequence of the solar eclipse of 8 July (e.g. Heisig, 1929). This led Franz von Paula Gruithuisen (1774â1852), professor of medicine and astronomy in Munich (Germany), to a statement in MÃ¼nchner politische Zeitung on 2Â July, in which, based on an analogy with the drought of 1811, he associated the extreme drought of 1842 with a lack of sunspots: âThere is very widespread opinion that the imminent solar eclipse [8Â July] is responsible for the great drought of the current spring and summer. Being more closely acquainted with the influence of the Sun on the Earth, I may assert firmly that the recent drought is related to a striking lack of sunspots. The recent weather is similar to that of the year 1811, in which the same [degree of] drought and the same lack of the sunspots that usually tend to herald steady weather, occurred, when the same [degree of] drought, the same state of the grain and the same splendid growth of grapes [were observed]â (Ãsterreichischer Beobachter, 5Â JulyÂ 1842, p. 723). A full solar eclipse was so impressive that in the French L'Ãcho de la FrontiÃ¨re, reporting for Valenciennes (1 and 2Â AugustÂ 1842, p. 1) appears: âthe year 1842 will be classified among the numbers of years of abundance of all kinds, together with its good wine [which], if The Lord deigns so to do, may be called `the wine of the eclipse', [just] as that of 1811 was named the `wine of the comet' [Flaugergues' comet]â."
