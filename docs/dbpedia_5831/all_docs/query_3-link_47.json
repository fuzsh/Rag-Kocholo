        "text": "Saturday — March 29, 2014 — 6:30 to 16:00\n\nRogaine_2014_Results (Excel file, Hebrew)\n\nRogaine_2014_Teams (Excel file, Hebrew)\n\nDan Chissick (Mapper and Course Planner): PHOTOS\n\nLisa Mishli (8-hour): PHOTOS\n\nDalia Ravid (5-hour): PHOTOS\n\nAmri Wandel (5-hour): PHOTOS\n\nShimon Shomroni (6-hour MTB): VIDEO\n\nRugged Outdoor Group Adventure Involving Navigation and Endurance\n\nWhat is Rogaining?\n\nRogaining is the sport of long distance cross-country navigation, in which teams of two to five people visit as many checkpoints (“controls”) as possible within a set time period. The checkpoints are marked on a map given to competitors shortly before the start. Checkpoints have different point values, and can be visited in any order, so strategy and route selection are key elements to achieving the highest point score. Teamwork, endurance, competition and an appreciation for the natural environment are features of the sport.\n\nTraditional and championship rogaines are 24 hours in duration, but shorter rogaines are common. Learn more about rogaining.\n\nRogaine Israel 2014 is offering 5-hour and 8-hour events for those on foot, and a 6-hour event for mountain bike riders.\n\nRogaine Israel 2014 will take place in Ramot Menashe, the Menashe Plateau. Situated south of Mt. Carmel, it is one of the most beautiful regions in Israel. The area is a unique combination of natural Tabor oak woodlands and planted conifer forests, open spaces, fields and orchards, springs and streams. The gentle slopes and rural character of the region create a pastoral, tranquil atmosphere. The region has a wealth of historic and archaeological remains from prehistoric times through the Ottoman Period, as well as extensive heritage related to the settlement and establishment of the modern State of Israel. Learn more about the Ramot Menashe area.\n\nWho Can Participate?\n\nRogaining is a team activity for people of all ages and levels of fitness. Rogaining appeals to all types of outdoor sports enthusiasts – from recreational hikers and bikers, to elite level orienteers, runners, mountain-bikers, and ultra-athletes. Your challenge and success come from your ability to read the map, to plan a route through as many checkpoints as possible, and to navigate your course within the time limit. New rogainers are always welcome and organizers are more than happy to help you get started.\n\nFollow Rogaine 2014 updates on Facebook\n\n(open to all – Facebook account not required)\n\nRogaine Israel 2014 – Categories for Foot and Bike\n\nYouth/Masters (Mixed Age) – At least one member of the team must be under age 16 or at least 50 years old.\n\nYouth/Masters – Women (Mixed Age Women) – At least one female member of the team under age 16 or at least 50 years old.\n\nOpen – No age limits.\n\nOpen Women – No age limits, with at least one female member of the team.\n\nAge is determined by the competitor’s age on January 1, 2014.\n\nAny team with a member under the age of 16 must also have a member at least 18 years old.\n\nIn addition, the following age restrictions apply to categories:\n\nFoot 5 hours – Age 12 and older\n\nFoot 8 hours – Age 15 and older\n\nBike 6 hours – Age 13 and older\n\nStart Time\n\nMass start for all competitors at the following times:\n\nEvent Sign In Map Handout Start Time Limit OT-DSQ Rogaine.Foot 5 hours 09:00 09:30 10:00 15:00 15:30 Rogaine.Foot 8 hours 06:30 07:00 07:30 15:30 16:00 Rogaine.Bike 6 hours 07:30 08:00 08:30 14:30 15:00\n\nFinish Time\n\nAll Rogaine competitors must arrive at finish line by the Time Limit hour specified for the event.

The exact location of the assembly area will be announcement just prior to the event. Directional signs to the assembly area will be posted on Route 6953. See map below.\n\nGear Provided by Organizers\n\nEvery competitor will receive a map prepared especially for the event; it has a scale of 1:25,000. Every team will need one Emit electronic timing card, as used by competitors at Israel Sport Orienteering Association events. The organizers will loan an Emit card to any team in need of one.\n\nWater points will be marked on the map.\n\nRequired Gear\n\nEvery team must carry a mobile phone whose phone number has been registered with the event organizers.\n\nEvery competitor in all events must be carrying at least 2.0 liter of water at the start of the event. Locations where drinking water is available will be marked on the map.\n\nEvery competitor in the bike event must wear a helmet.\n\nCommunication\n\nAll teams must carry at least two mobile phones, well charged at the start, whose numbers have been registered with the organizers prior to the start.\n\nRecommended Gear\n\nCompass, food, long pants, extra pair of socks, first-aid kit, small pack for carrying gear.\n\nForbidden Equipment\n\nThe use of maps other than those expressly sanctioned by the organizers is prohibited.\n\nThe only navigational aids that may be carried on the course are magnetic compasses, watches and copies of the competition map.\n\nUpon receipt of the rogaine map from the organizers, competitors are prohibited from using any other navigational aids, including other maps, aerial photographs, pedometers, altimeters, GPS devices with map-display capabilities, and smartphone applications.\n\nComputers may not be used by competitors for planning their strategy.\n\nDuring the competition, competitors may use only the food and equipment which they have carried from the start, or have left at the assembly area for later retrieval. No provisions may be cached in advance of the event. Only water may be refilled at any of the water stations spread throughout the rogaine area.\n\nCheckpoints\n\nApproximately 30 checkpoints will be spread across the rogaine area. Checkpoints are marked by orange and white flags (orienteering control markers). Every checkpoint has an electronic timing device with a unique code.\n\nEach checkpoint has a numeric code, which is also its point value, from 31 to 90. This number appears on the map and on the checkpoint itself. Each checkpoint in the field is also marked by yellow flagging tape labeled with the checkpoint number and “Rogaine 2014”. Typically the yellow tape will be visible from a distance while the checkpoint control flag will be slightly hidden (behind a bush or tree) to reduce the chance of theft.\n\nScoring\n\nEach team’s score is determined by the total value of the checkpoints visited. Points are deducted for being overtime, according to a rate per minute or part thereof. Teams finishing more than thirty minutes late will be considered overtime, and therefore disqualified.\n\nRules\n\nThe rules for the event are based on the international rogaining rules. In case of discrepancies between those rules and those defined by the organizers of Israel Rogaine 2014, the rules for this event will be the operative ones.\n\n[Check back here for Israel Rogaine 2014 Rules (Hebrew)]\n\nRespect and Good Manners\n\nDo not enter areas marked as private or surrounded by high fences. Cross through residential areas only on trails and roads marked on the map.\n\nDo not enter buildings, greenhouses and barns.\n\nDo not cross agricultural fields, except where trails are marked on the map.

The terrain is partially forested and mountainous with an extensive network of trails, and partially agricultural land with both cultivated and grazing fields, orchards, and several rural villages.\n\nDirections\n\nDirectional signs will be posted on Route 6953 between Mishmar Ha’emek and Ein Hashofet.\n\nPlease drive carefully, and comply with parking attendants’ instructions.\n\nTransportation assistance to foreign competitors:\n\nThere is no bus service in Israel on the weekends (Friday afternoon until Saturday evening), so you will not be able to get to/from the event by public transportation. You might consider renting a car.\n\nYou can post a notice on the ISOA forum, and on the Rogaine Facebook event page.\n\nLocal orienteers are always happy to help in transportation, and it is very likely that someone will offer you a ride.\n\nNeed a Teammate?\n\nIf you would like to participate but don’t have a partner, use the Find-A-Teammate form on the rogaine (Hebrew) website, or post to the Rogaine Facebook (English or Hebrew) event page.
