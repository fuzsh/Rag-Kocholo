My name is Evyatar Shachar and I am so excited to be a Shinshin in St. Louis at Kol Rinah, Temple Israel and the Jewish Federation. From the first day I remember, I loved being outdoors: hiking, breathing fresh air and being in nature. I love the aviation world and dreamed from an early age to get my wings and become an airline pilot. I live in Ashkelon with my parents and my older sister. Ashkelon is located on the southern coastal plain, it’s about an hour drive to Jerusalem and to Tel-Aviv, and about 8 miles north of the border with the Gaza Strip. As a teenager who grew up in Ashkelon all his life under missile attacks, I developed the ability to adapt to changes quite quickly and move from my life to emergency and back. Reality has taught me that my generation- the future generation, must change the situation we are in, and hope for a better, more peaceful world. Therefore, I believe in the way of talk and peace and believe that the situation can be changed to such that we can live with complete own safe and happiness. I am also active for the environment and a partner in the global youth protest in the fight against climate change. I am looking forward to meeting everyone!\n\nShaked Birenboim and Guy Nachum\n\n2019-2020\n\nWe are so excited to introduce our third cohort of Shinshinim: Shaked Birenboim and Guy Nachum.
