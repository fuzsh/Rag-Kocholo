        "text": "common tree frogs (Hyla savignyi), marsh frogs (Rana ridibunda), and green toads (Bufo viridis). With the draining of the swamps, exploitation of water sources, and consequent destruction of most of the seasonal ponds in the country, such habitats became rare. The pond here, created to facilitate and encourage the proliferation of plants and animals native to wetlands, also serves as an important on-site laboratory for Ramat Hanadiv’s Education Department.\n\nFrom here, there are three options:\n\n• A right turn brings walkers to the parking lot of the ORT School.\n\n• A left turn leads hikers up to the trail marked in yellow, culminating at the historic Tel Tzur hill. (It takes about 10 minutes to get to either destination.)\n\n• For those who want to continue walking: The Spring Trail continues straight on, passing an olive grove (on the right) and a Geiger tree notable for its wide leaves (on the left). At the beginning of the 20th century, tests were conducted to see whether this tree could be cultivated for use in the glue industry. Next to it is a hedge of sweet acacia trees which were studied too, for possible commercial use in perfume. The trail returns from here to the grove of willow trees and then ascends metal steps to the bath house (Station #5).\n\nIn 1939, a group of young Jews from the Betar youth movement founded a small ‘stockade and tower’ settlement on the hilltop east of the spring, which they named Tel Tzur Hahadasha (the New Tel Tzur). Near the Roman pool they built an additional one of concrete, which provided the settlement’s water needs. As mentioned above, one can visit the historic Tel Tzur site on the trail marked in yellow, which exits from the area of the brook.\n\nFrom the aqueduct, the trail goes up the stairs beyond the dovecote (Station #7)."
