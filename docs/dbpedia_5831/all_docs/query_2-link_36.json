        "text": "Forests of this kind are intended mainly for the communities that live near them. This is the thread that connects the community to values of nature and the heritage of the close environment and it is an important tool for community environmental commitment.\n\nKKL-JNF activity in the community forest is based on these principles:\n\nConserving and nurturing the forest and the values of nature in it, near the community and for its residents.\n\nFree access for the residents to all corners of the forest and use of its facilities for free.\n\nCreating mutual commitment between KKL-JNF, the community and the local authority in managing the forest.\n\nThe community commitment of Shoham's residents is manifested in the activity of the \"community forest team,\" which is common to KKL-JNF, the council and the residents.\n\nSince 2003 the team has advanced all matters connected to the forest and the community including shared planning, events and guiding by volunteers from the community and nurturing the forest and its appearance.\n\nBar Giora gate and the campsite\n\nA few steps from the entrance to the scenic road is the Milton Yaakovi recreation site â€“ intended for daytime stays and approved for camping at night (for groups with advance coordination).\n\nThe recreation area has picnic tables, drinking water, playground equipment for children and camping areas. The recreation area is accessible for people with special needs.\n\nThe place was known in the War of Independence as the Fork Junction, named after the meeting of the road that ascends from the Elah Valley to Bethlehem with the dirt road on which the Palmah Harel forces ascended from the Judean Foothills (today the road to Bar Giora). The area was conquered in the Mountain Operation, which began on October 19, 1948, and ended three days later. The IDF forces moved from village to village and captured them from the remains of the Egyptian forces that commanded the area until then. The village of Husan was also captured during the operation, but the IDF retreated from it and the village remained within the area of the kingdom of Jordan.\n\nThe forest road, marked with a black trail sign and KKL-JNF signs, departs eastward from the recreation area.The road crosses the heart of a planted forest mixed with natural woodland.\n\nAfter one kilometer, next to a high tension pylon, the road turns left, and a short section of it corresponds to the Israel Trail. After about 250 meters, the \"black\" route leaves the Israel Trail, turns left sharply and descends to the edges of a vineyard growing in a small valley. The route departs from the vineyard and passes a route marked in red (on the left) and meets the other end of the \"red\" route about half a kilometer later, after a sharp turn. From here you can go north on the \"red\" route (by foot or car) and reach the starting point of a path marked in green that leads to the top of Mount Giora."
