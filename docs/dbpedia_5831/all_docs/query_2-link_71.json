The news spread through facebook, and within an hour, dozens of tents had sprung up. Within a week, there were some 400 tents, spread out in a double line more than a mile long. Similar tent-cities sprang up in Jerusalem, Haifa and a dozen smaller towns. The next Saturday, tens of thousands joined protest marches in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. Last Saturday, they numbered more than 150,000. This has now become the center of Israeli life.

The first initiative of its kind. Dedicated to calling attention to this enforcement of the most savage elements of Islamic law against women: wives, daughters & sisters. One can't even begin to fathom the lost dreams & ideals & promises & hopes for a full life extinguished by the tyrannical, hatemongering macho culture of Islamic supremacism. Demand the world's condemnation of Islamic misogyny, gender apartheid & the dehumanization of women. Should be the first of tens of thousands of memorials, but the point of the memorials does not end simply with the memorials themselves. The memorials show that we have not forgotten & will not forget these girls. And the memorials are just a part of a larger determination to show the Islamic world that we simply will not allow this barbaric practice of Islamic honor killing to stand in the West. We will plant millions of groves.\" /// Click here for video of dedication speeches by Pamela Geller & Robert Spencer. /// Click here for blog opposing this memorial. /// FYI: American Independence Park is on land owened by the Jewish National Fund (JNF or KKL). \"The JNF has established the Wall of Eternal Life...to provide people around the world with the opportunity to forever memorialize loved ones in Israel...

After the Wagon (Munchen 12 2-46) was found in Germany [and] brought to Israel...we found some unbelievable finding engraved on the chassis of the Wagon next to the door wheel. After more deep searches we identified other symbols in two different places. It comes in a total number of three Stars of David embedded in the chassis in different places, by using a chisel by no doubt a professionally Jewish locksmith worker. This finding is of global and unique importance, since as far as we know never found before on any other wagons. Visitors passing by those authentic signs are deeply moved looking at them, as a souvenir made some 70 years ago. Apparently the markings were sunk by a Jewish locksmith during forced labor and his souvenir remains forever as a sign for eternal memory.\" Information courtesy of Tatjana Ruge.\n\nFuture\n\nFuture - Ariel Sharon Eco Park, Hiriya, near Tel Aviv (Israel). \"Over the years, the garbage pile at Hiriya dump site in Israel grew so big that the birds it attracted became a danger to the jets taking off & landing at Ben Gurion Airport.

Can it bring Israelis & Arabs together? Itzhak Tshuva (Isaac Sharon) has set his sights on the Arava, an arid valley along the southern portion of the border between Israel & Jordan. If his vision comes to pass, the private sector will build a $3 billion canal that not only connects the Red Sea to the Dead Sea but also links Israelis, Jordanians & Palestinians - possibly helping bring about peace through greater economic integration. This so-called \"Valley of Peace\" is part of a 520-kilometer (323-mile) corridor being proposed by Israeli President Shimon Peres for regional economic development. About 420 km of the corridor runs along the Jordanian border - with no fences, walls or minefields - and another 100 km touches on the Palestinian territories.

When contacted, Syrian transport officials declined to comment on where the highway was actually leading.
