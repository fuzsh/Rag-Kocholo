        "text": "The Gilboa’s abundant flora has made it a major attraction for tens of thousands of visitors. In most years, unless there is a drought, the mountain is covered in carpets of flowers in a variety of colors. Those on the north-western slopes belong to Mediterranean varieties, while those on the south-eastern slopes are characteristic of steppe regions. The first group includes plants that produce bulbs and tubers, such as members of the lily, iris and narcissus families: autumnal squill, lesser grape hyacinth, first-rain colchicum and, later, white winter crocus and bunch-flowered narcissus (Chinese sacred lily).\n\nIn the southern section, autumn crocuses can be found in some areas. In January these flowers are joined by cyclamen, mandrakes and anemones. The anemones of the Gilboa, like those in other parts of northern Israel, bloom in a variety of colors, especially early in the season. Later the red flowers dominate and carpet large expanses of the hillsides.\n\nThe anemones are the harbingers of the “red wave” of flowers, and are later joined by Sharon tulips – especially on Har Lapidim – Persian buttercups and Aleppo Adonis, with poppies bringing up the rear.\n\nThe “blue wave” is represented by the Syrian cornflower thistle, the Barbary nut iris, storksbill, viper’s bugloss, spiny alkanet and anchusa. The various types of orchid and bee orchid also deserve a mention, as do Valerian and the Persian fritillary. From the end of February onwards, the mountain is covered with an abundance of additional flowers. Nor should we forget the wide variety of grasses, which provide potential grazing. The Giboa manages to strike a balance between grazing and conservation. Grazing is an economic consideration, and also prevents grasses from growing out of control and obliterating the flowering plants.\n\nThis is also where the Gilboa iris, one of the most impressive local species, can be found. Its violet flowers are very large and beautiful and appear mainly in early spring, throughout the month of March. The plant takes its name from the fact that it was first described on the Gilboa, though it is also found in smaller and less impressive concentrations in the Judean Desert and the environs of Ein Gev. Its six petals are of two kinds that occur alternately: three upright and three bent, adorned with dark patches. The seeds of this iris contain a mechanism that delays germination and extends it over a period of several years, thereby protecting the plant from the dangers posed by the frequent local droughts. For many years, this beautiful flower has tempted both visitors and plant dealers to dig up its tubers and either plant them in their gardens or sell them. As a result, the iris reached the brink of extinction, but rallied after the enactment of the wild plant protection law and the increased cooperation by visitors that followed in its wake.\n\nThe Gilboa is also famous for its carpets of anemones, tulips, Persian buttercups and Aleppo Adonis that flower in early spring.\n\nMammals found at the foot or on the margins of Mount Gilboa include the mountain gazelle, the rock hyrax, foxes, wildcats, rabbits, porcupines and small rodents. Various types of bat live in the caves, while swamp lynxes, badgers, mongooses and weasels can be found at the foot of the hill. Reptiles include tortoises, lizards and snakes.\n\nMount Gilboa in Jewish Sources\n\nMount Gilboa has a very long human history. It is one of the few mountains mentioned in the Bible, and was the site of one of the most tragic events in the annals of the Jewish People, when the Israelites, under King Saul, fled to the Gilboa after their defeat by the Philistines.\n\nThe Philistines caught up with Saul and killed his sons Jonathan, Avinadav and Melchishua, and the king fell on his own sword to avoid capture. The names of the Gilboa peaks and communities perpetuate the memory of Saul and his sons. “Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings…” lamented David after their deaths. And, indeed, there are no springs on the mountain itself. In some areas the bare rock is visible, and in those places there is almost no sign of vegetation.\n\nMount Gilboa offers a Bible study experience unequalled by anywhere else in the country. Many parts of the mountain bear names of Biblical figures: the war of Gideon gave us Mount Lapidim and Mount Yitzpor, while Saul’s family provided Mount Saul, Mount Jonathan, Har Giborim (“Heroes’ Mountain”), Mount Avinadav, Mount Melchishua, Mount Ahinoam and Mount Avner.\n\nThe Gilboa also witnessed events outside Jewish history, the most significant of which was perhaps the battle of Ein Jalud, which was fought at the foot of Mount Gilboa in 1260, and in which the Muslim Mamluks, under Beybars, defeated the Mongols. This defeat put an end to the Mongols’ advance westwards; had the outcome been otherwise, the history of the European peoples would perhaps have been different.\n\nMount Gilboa experienced a settlement boom during the Roman era, and burial caves from the period have been found in the villages of Faqqua, Mutila and Mugheyr on the northern bank of Nahal Bezek. Remains of ancient settlement have also been found in the Arab village of Nuris, above Gidona, at Khirbet Geduda (above Kibbutz Heftziba) and other sites. These Gilboa communities lived mainly off agriculture, and the numerous wine presses in the region are evidence of the central role of vineyards in the local economy. With the Arab conquest in 636 CE, however, the Gilboa was abandoned completely, and remained deserted until a number of Arab villages were established there some 250 years ago.\n\nIn the 1920s, KKL-JNF began to acquire land in the Harod Valley at the foot of the mountain, and four communities were established there: Ein Harod, Tel Yosef, Heftziba and Beit Alfa. The occupants of the local Arab villages were displeased with this development, and for these Jewish communities, their presence in the area was fraught with danger.\n\nIn 1935, Arabs from the village of Mazar murdered Sergeant Moshe Rosenfeld, a Jew serving in the British police during the Mandate, and this was the signal for the outbreak of the Arab Revolt of 1936. Ein HaSamal (”The Sergeant’s Spring”), adjacent to the Hidden Valley, is named after Rosenfeld.\n\nDuring Israel’s War of Independence, the Gilboa Arab villages became bases for the Iraqi army and the gangs that attacked the Jewish communities in the valley, and for a time only armored vehicles could be used on the road from Geva to Merhavia.\n\nAfter the conquest of the village of Zir‘in in late May 1948, the other Arab communities in the Gilboa and the eastern Jezreel Valley area were abandoned. On July 10th, however, the Iraqi army took possession of the ridge all the way to the village of Mazar. Jews in the Jezreel Valley organized a general call-up, and, on the eve of the lull in the fighting that preceded the establishment of the border between Israel and Jordan, they made the exhausting climb to the top of Mount Barkan and claimed the Gilboa peak for the State of Israel. However, for a long time this peak was Israeli only in theory, as visitors feared to climb it without an accompanying security detail.\n\nIn 1958, KKL-JNF determined to improve the security situation on Mount Gilboa. It began by creating the patrol road along the Green Line, from Sandala in the south west, through Har Barkan, Faqqua and Jilabun to Mount Melchishua, and the descent to the Beit Shean Valley. A section of northern road was also created from Nurit, joining the patrol road to the west of Har Barkan. The work was extremely hazardous, and was carried out under the protection of Border Guards. Attacks by Arabs took their toll nonetheless: one of the road builders and several Border Guards were killed. The road builders referred to the junction of the two roads as “the golden gate”: the Jewish villages in the valley were visible from it, and anyone returning from the mountain considered himself safe from attack once he had reached the longed-for junction.\n\nAfter the roads had been built, KKL-JNF took on another challenge: the afforestation of the Gilboa. Initial attempts at planting had been made by the British near Maayan Harod in the 1920s, without much success, and the prevailing opinion was that Mount Gilboa was unsuitable for forests. But, thanks to KKL-JNF’s persistence and expertise, the trees acclimated well this time, and now they beautify over twenty thousand dunam (approx 5,000 acres) of Gilboa terrain. Roads were constructed through the woods, and recreation areas and lookout points were added. With time signposts were erected to show hikers the way and provide explanations for the tens of thousands of visitors who come to enjoy the area every year.\n\nTel Jezreel\n\nLocated opposite the main access road to the Gilboa from the west, to the north of the Taanach road (Route 675), between kilometer indicators 10 and 11. It was in Jezreel that King Ahab built his palace, and here that the Prophet Elijah asked him, “Hast thou killed and also taken possession….?”) because on the advice of his wife Jezebel, he had executed Naboth the Jezreelite, whose vineyard he coveted. The site has a lookout point and a recreational area at Ein Jezreel.\n\nThe Nurit Active Recreational Area\n\nA large concentration of picnic tables adjacent to the abandoned Moshav Nurit that was established near the ruins of the Arab village of Nuris.\n\nMount Saul\n\nThis peak is 302 meters above sea level and, as a result of a series of geological fractures, it juts out northwards from the chain of Gilboa peaks. Because of this, it provides excellent views and is easily identifiable when the Gilboa is viewed from afar. It takes its name from King Saul, who fell in battle against the Philistines (Samuel I, 31. Its Arabic name is Tel Kulila and Jewish residents of the valley referred to it as Har HaKelala (“The Mount of the Curse”), because of the similarity of sound. This, however, is a misnomer, as kulila means “perfect beauty,” and the hill featured in the songs of the local shepherds as a place to which one ascended to find peace of mind.\n\nArcheological finds on the hill indicate the presence of human beings from the Paleolithic period, through the Early and Middle Bronze Age, the Israelite period and the Roman era right up to the Byzantine period. In the center of the square there was formerly a KKL-JNF fire-prevention lookout tower, but this was later moved. It is now located on Mount Barkan and can be seen from Mount Saul.\n\nThe cliffs on the northern face of the hill were once home to a colony of raptors (eagles and vultures), but after the mass poisonings of the 1950s and 1960s they never returned to nest at the site.\n\nSaul’s Shoulder\n\nThis is the Gilboa’s main recreational area and a recommended starting point for a walk northwards to Mount Saul, whose peak juts out from the main Gilboa ridge and so provides an unusually beautiful view of the surrounding countryside. Keen walkers can also use this as the starting point for a hike to Har Giborim, which offers a wonderful view all the way to Mount Hermon. On this hill the ruins of the Arab village of Mazar can be seen – the site of fierce battles during Israel’s War of Independence.\n\nThe Eshhar Recreation Area\n\nA small area, some one and a half kilometers west of Saul’s Shoulder. It takes its name from the numerous buckthorn (Heb: eshhar) shrubs in the vicinity.\n\nThe Vinya Reuven Cohen Recreation Area\n\nA small intimate spot isolated from the main Gilboa road and named after a well-known economist who was among the early members of Kibbutz Ein Harod. The lookout point provides a view of the kibbutz.\n\nThe Golden Gate Recreational Area\n\nNotable for its spring flowers, especially the Gilboa iris, tulips, anemones, Persian buttercups and an amazing range of other varieties. This is an excellent starting point for a walk along the steep path to the Hidden Valley. The site has playground equipment for children and signposted footpaths that lead to the Har Lapidim nature reserve. On the way is another recreational area called the Halfway Stop.\n\nThe Barkan Recreational Area\n\nA collection of places to sit that can accommodate a large gathering. From Mount Barkan you can look south towards the area of the Gilboa that lies beyond the Green Line. A hiking trail from the recreational area leads through Ein HaSamal to the Hidden Valley and a study trail leads to the Golden Gate. Here, too, carpets of Gilboa Iris can be seen during the flowering season.\n\nThe Hidden Valley\n\nA hiking trail descends steeply from the environs of Mount Barkan to the Harod Valley, near the old Tel Yosef site. Intended for experienced walkers, it is marked with red along its entire length. After rain it can be slippery.\n\nThe Iris Recreation Area\n\nAdjacent to a large concentration of Gilboa irises with a sign-posted footpath leading among them.\n\nThe Hidden Valley Recreation Area\n\nLies to the east of the main Gilboa road, to the north of the Vinya Cohen Recreation Area. The approach road can be tricky after rain.\n\nNahal Yitzpor\n\nA hiking trail marked in red that descends from north of Kibbutz Maale Gilboa to the road that goes up to the Gilboa from the Beit Alfa area."
