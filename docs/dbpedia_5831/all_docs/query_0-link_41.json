        "text": "Aharon Kahana (1905-1967) was born in 1905 in Stuttgart, Germany. He immigrated to Israel in 1934. During the years 1922-25 he studied ceramics at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart and later in Berlin. He was one of the founders of the important Israeli art movement, New Horizons. He participated many exhibitions among them the Venice Biennale in 1948, 1954 and 1958 and the Sao Paolo Biennale in 1959. He won several honorary prizes – Dizengoff Prize in 1938 and 1953, Prize commemorating the Tenth Anniversary of the State of Israel in 1958, and more.\n\nHis residence in Ramat-Gan became a museum later on. He died in 1967."
