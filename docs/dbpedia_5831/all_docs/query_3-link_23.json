        "text": "The book Ramot Menashe: Memories from the First Decade describes the Kibbutz and its young founding members during the stormy time of idealism, of pioneering and fighting spirit, and of building something out of nothing in the Land of Israel that was reborn out of the ashes.\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nAbraham (Abrashka) Vered was born in Bialystok, Poland in 1924. He studied to be a locksmith at the Hebrew School ‘Culture’ and at ‘Ort’ and later became an electrician. His parents David and Rachel Varat, his sister Liba and her family, and his younger sister Golda, were all killed by the Nazis. His brother Eliyahu joined the partisans and the red army. Abrashka was a prisoner in Meidanek, Aushwitz-Birkenau, Bonei-Monovitz, Dora-Nordhausen, and Bergen-Belsen. In 1946 he came to Israel with the Bonnei HaNegev group who were the founders of Kibbutz Ramot Menashe in 1948. He served as an officer in the Golani army brigade and has held many central roles in the Kibbutz as well as working in the field crops, the carpentry and metal workshops, Arad and Aram. Today, he and his wife enjoy spending time with their daughter Gila’s family, and they are grandparents to granddaughter Noy and grandson Nave.\n\n\"About this title\" may belong to another edition of this title."
