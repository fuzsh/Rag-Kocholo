        "text": "Nazism at Arab Palestinians\n\nالنازة من قبل العرب الفلسطينيين [النازيون والفلسطينيون] נאציות של ערבים פלסטינים\n\nThis page is mainly about admiration (ideology, sentiments), adopting of Hitler, Hitlerism etc. By Arab \"Palestinians.\" It is often also accompanied with denying,[1][2][3] belittling the Holocaust.[4] Hijacking Holocaust terminology to perpetuate falsities and demonize.[5] And even perversion.[6][4][7][8]\n\nNote. This is in no way taking away, even tiniest part, from the real perpetrators of the Holocaust: Nazi Germany and their European helpers.\n\nThis is not about politically motivated calling someone a \"Nazi\" in a shallow matter. But about the real original, 'authentic' unique in its historic evil - Nazism.\n\n(It includes Arabs who have or/and prefer democratic Israel's citizenship. Those among the Arabs in Israel, who are haters, by default, also define themselves as \"Palestinians.\" In any case, it is about the Arabs in/from the area.\n\n[Though radical Islamic Antisemitism incorporating Nazism, Arab-Islamists cooperating with Nazis, then with Neo Nazis - all that is a larger issue]).\n\nHitler on the Arabs\n\nNote, Hitler was clear about his disdain for the Arabs, as inferiors.[9][10][11] Hitler loathed Arabs, he once described them as \"lacquered half-apes who ought to be whipped.\"[12][13][14] And the Grand Mufti al-Husseini himself has actually said 'that after the Jews, the Germans would destroy the Arabs,' \"he knew this,\" says his granddaughter.[15] [Yet, he “cherished\" the Nazis' ‘racial’ hatred.[16]]\n\nIt's why the Mufti's chasing caused Nazis' discomfort at least in the beginning.[17]\n\nWhich is why Hitler, the Nazis just had to convince themselves, the Mufti is, supposedly \"not\" pure Arab in blood...[18]\n\nIn 1937,[19]\n\nBaldur von Schirach, the leader of the Hitler Youth, visited Damascus, Baghdad and Tehran. In Damascus, von Schirach, was asked by journalists how Nazi propaganda in Arab countries could be reconciled with [its] racial theory, which places Arabs at the …th rank. The Arab press then noted that Von Shirach had evaded and refrained from giving a logical answer to this question.\n\n1938: Syrian and Egyptian paper, (which had a wide readership among Arabs in Palestine[20]) realize, Arabs are as an \"inferior race\" as Africans, per Hitler's view:[21]\n\nThe Arabs are \"inferior,\" according to Hitler\n\nThe Cairo and Damascus newspapers open their readers' eyes to the true meaning of Nazi doctrine\n\nDamascus, (Palcor). Under the headline \"Arabs are of an inferior race - says Hitler\" the Damascus newspaper 'Alif-Ba' [Alif bāʼ ال باء] published the scathing article of the Egyptian weekly, \"Rose al-Yussef\" [روز اليوسف; Rose al-Yousef] on the Arabic translation 'My war' [\"Mein Kampf\"] by Hitler.\n\nIn the introduction, 'Alif-Ba' writes that few are the Arabs, who know that Hitler sees the Arab people as an inferior nation that does not deserve self-government and to stand on the same cultural and social level with the \"Aryan\" peoples. He places her in his book on a par with the black peoples of Africa.\n\nAfter that, the newspaper tells, in short, about the noise made in Egypt by the Arabic translation of the book 'My war' ['Mein Kampf'], which omitted, with the intention of misleading the readers, all the passages that speak in condemnation of the Egyptians, and brings the article 'Rose al-Yusuf' in its entirety.\n\nAn August 1939 warning:[22]\n\nBELGRADE (Palcor). — A warning to the Moslem world in general, and to Arabs of the Near East in particular, has been issued by the Yugoslav Moslem daily Senana, against Nazi and Fascist-propaganda. There are 1,500,000 Moslems in Yugoslavia. The paper states that Dr. Goebbels is spending enormous sums on propaganda in Egypt, Iraq and Palestine in order to incite the local population against the Jews and so distract attention from the real aims of Nazi policy. The hope was expressed that these efforts would be fruitless.\n\nRemember the ruthless conquest of Albania, the merciless treatment of the Arabs in Libya, and the dangers threatening Egypt as a result of Axis policy, the article concludes.\n\nAt a 1940 review of a Syrian author's 1939 book, writer said:[23]\n\nThe Nazi movement was above all an imperialistic one and the Arabs realised this. Had not the Haifa air raids proved Hitler's intentions?\n\nEven Falastin realized and noted in 1940:[24] \"Hitler who invented the theory of race and who made the Arabs fourteenth level.\"\n\nThe Nazis in fact played the Arabs, all the way, despite treating them so badly, as for instance, 10,000 Muslim Arabs were tormented by them. Oct 1942 report in Iraq:[25]\n\n10,000 Moslem Arabs Tormented By Nazis\n\nBAGHDAD, Tuesday (ANA). —\n\nThe \"Al Alam el-Arabi\" newspaper publishes an article under the heading Nazi Cruelty to Arabs, describing the hardships Arabs are suffering in forced work for Hitler.\n\n\"All these things are being done,\" says the and newspaper, \"and still the Axis, headed by the Nazis, boasts unceasingly that they sympathize with the Arabs. Hitler has ordered 10,000 Moslem Arabs who fell into the hand of the Nazis to be tormented by the unbearable cruelty of the Nazi nightmare.\n\nThey are begging and protesting but nobody hears their cries or pities or helps them, in their suffering. This is another proof that the Axis lies to the Arabs and mocks their self-respect, honour and rights.\"\n\nNotorious PFLP hijacker and admitted terrorist[26] who has been still promoting violence 2014-16[27] Laila Khaled: \"At first, I admired Hitler because I thought he was the enemy of the Jews. Later I found out he classified Arabs as sub-humans, only slightly above the gypsies and the Jews.\"[28]\n\n[Not that Hitler himself was \"true\" or even \"consistent\" at his twisted \"belief.\"[29][30][31] White Russians were not included in his \"theory\"... which neo-fascists in Russia are upset about.[32] But that isn't the point, of course].\n\n[This is not about those who without ideology served the Nazis to survive. Or per selfishness.]\n\nNazi era[]\n\nWith barely two months of Hitler rise to power, the Mufti rushed already to forge contact with the Nazi regime, March 31, 1933.[33][34]\n\nIn Nov 1933, it was reported, a direct contact between the German Nazis and the Palestinian Arabs, Arab Riot Leaders, revealed by Nazis.[35]\n\nBy Dec 1933, Nazism spread by young Arabs, some painted the swastika on a glass and various utensils in Arab cafes in Jaffa. When a young Arab drank a toast for Arab Nazism and Jews protested it, Azmi Nashashibi, the deputy governor of Jaffa, intervened against preventing these acts.[36]\n\nNazi Anti-Jewish propaganda picked up greater speed in Arab Palestine since 1934, especially in boycotting Jews.[37][38]\n\nSoon, the swastika is seen more and more on Arab houses, on Arab cars, and even shoe polishers near the Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem adorned crates in this painting.[39]\n\nAn Arab exporting firm, wrapped his oranges marked \"Saint Elijah, Jaffa,\" in paper bearing a picture of the Muhammad surrounded by swastikas.[40]\n\nIn spring of 1934, extremist Arab nationalists intended to form the Palestinian Nazi Party, which aimed to fight Jews in coordination with the Nazi Party in Germany, in Israel, many swastikas began to appear on Arab homes and their cars.[41] Arab students returning from studying in Europe were determined to found the Arab Nazi party.[42]\n\nIn May 1934, local German Nazis in Haifa organized propaganda meeting with open Hitlerist propaganda. Foreign Germans come as \"tourists\" join in. The British authorities knows about it, but chooses to ignore.[43]\n\nFrom a Sept 1934 report: [44]\n\nThe Nazi Party in Germany has decided to launch a propaganda campaign in Arab countries, report Greek papers. Sixty books in Arabic have been printed and distributed in Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and other lands. The amount of 360,000 marks has been assigned for the purpose.\n\nAn Apr 25, 1935 report:[45]\n\nFrom time to time, anti-Jewish slogans written in Arabic and German, and embellished with the swastika, appear on vacant walls and boardings in different Palestine towns, enjoining a boycott of Jewish goods and enterprises. Their effect has been nil except to leave a great deal of annoyance among young and ardent Jews, who endeavor to trace the perpetrators of such nuisances. According to well-informed local quarters , the origin of these throwaways is in a central Nazi propaganda ascent for Palestine who, it is believed, works through Arab Fascists. An attempt at Fascism was started some eighteen months ago as the only hope of Arab salvation in the present state of the Arab nationalist cause, as one young leader said. The object was to introduce an ultra-nationalistic spirit among the Arab youth. But it was more closely modelled on the National-Socialist brand of Fascism than the Italian, because the German politics embodied anti-Semitism as the central motive.\n\nFrom 1934:[46]\n\nA large number of Nazi agitators have been stirring up the Palestinian Arabs much to the discomfort of Great Britain. Recently three German agents were arrested by British authorities in Haifa and deported for anti-Semitic and anti-British propaganda.\n\nNazi propaganda in Arabic floods the market in Palestine. Hitler admiration is spread, his Mein Kampf especially draws Arabs' \"attention,\" Ahmad Shukeiri and others' Istiqlal Party (fans of fascism[47]) its newspaper al-Difa'a appearing on scene in 1934, founded by a Muslim a-Shanti (whose family got rich including by business with Jews) competed with ‘’Falastin’’ paper and gained reaction because he was more Islamic, more for pan-Arabism, pan-Islamism and he followed more steadily the Mufti’s fascist-Nazi line, [20] and became in fact a Nazi propaganda pamphlet.[48]\n\nSince Istiqlal began to reorganize, it has adopted Nazi ideas - reported Templars' paper: \"This party's publication shows a clear sympathy for Nazism and fights fiercely against the Jewish boycott of Germany.\"[49]\n\nAlready in 1933/4, the al-Difa' (Ad-Difaa) الدفاع was dubbed: The Arab-Nazi newspaper.[50][51]\n\nThis paper's enthusiastic coverage for Hitler, despite realizing openly, writing in 1934: \"[Hitlerism] is an ideology full of disrespect of all peoples.\"[52]\n\nIn 1935 ad-Difa’e got so bad that the British had to ban it for a month.[53]\n\nOverview:[48]\n\nAll parties were dragged along by the extremists of the Istiqlal, whose newspaper al-Difa'a became a Nazi propaganda pamphlet.\n\nThey made efforts to attract the masses with national recommendations, strong hatred of Jews and extreme demands from the authorities. The fascist regimes in Germany and Italy were a source of inspiration and imitation to the national Arab movement. As early as 1932, the newspaper Al-Carmel wrote: \"The Nazi movement is a symbol, it is a source of hope - Arab nationalism must adopt the methods of its leaders in their pursuit of independence and freedom.\"\n\nThe Mufti's bulletin al-Jamaa al-Arabiya's continued to incite the public against the government, expressing its support for fascist Italy, which the newspaper said had adopted sympathetic treatment of Arabs and the Muslim world \"and supported their national aspirations.\"\n\nIn March 1935 the Husseinis formed a party, called the Palestinian Arab Party. It was, as its president Jamal Husseini freely boasted, inspired by German Nazism. It included a 'youth troop', modelled on the Hitler Youth and for a while actually called, the 'Nazi Scouts'.[54] The young people swore that \"Palestine is my homeland, and there is no place for anyone who is not an Arab.\" Jamal Husseini quoted Hitler: \"I started with six, then we were 600 and then 60 million.\"[55]\n\nUntil the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, the Templars had good ties with their Jewish neighbors. Then things changed drastically since 1933. They then spread anti-Semitic propaganda and planned to import weapons from Germany for use by Arabs against the Jews. Yet, not all Templars were pro Nazi. The opponents were pressured. As a German with a swastika band around his arm, the Arabs he passed \"saluted him with admiration.\"[56]\n\nAdmiration of Nazism among the Arabs, expressed its urge also through groups, the Najjadah, like the Futuwwa and other groups, trying to emulate Nazism or fascism.[57]\n\nHistorian:[58]\n\n... the Husseinis in March 1935 formed the Palestinian Arab Party, whose platform for resistance to the establishment of a Jewish National Home. It set up its own youth corps. al-Futuwwa (the name of an association of Arab knights during the Middle Ages). which resembled Germany’s Hitler Youth and was officially designated the “Nazi Scouts.”\n\nAt the founding meeting on February 11, 1936, Jamal al- Husseini, a principal aide of Hajj Amin, declared that Hitler had stalled out with only six followers and now had sixty million. The first seventy al-Futuwwa recruits took the following oath: “Life — my right: independence — my aspiration: Arabism — my principle: Palestine — my country, and there is no room in it for any but Arabs. In this I believe and Allah is my witness.” The Husseini-Nazi connection… through the 1930s and early 1940s. Indeed, as early as March 31, 1933, two months after Hitler's assumption of power, Amin alHusseini told the German consul in Jerusalem that \"the Muslims inside and outside Palestine welcome the new German regime and hope for the extension of the fascist anti-democratic, governmental system to other countries.\" In the name of the Arabs, Husseini expressed a desire to join in the Nazis' anti-Jewish boycott.\n\nNoted:[59]\n\nRelations between the Arab National Movement and the Nazi regime in Germany began to take shape as early as 1933. In the various Arab countries, local parties and organizations began to emulate the Nazi party's methods of operation and to adopt its principles. In the summer of 1933, an attempt was made to establish an Arab Nazi movement in Palestine as well, and the Nazi propaganda ministry provided financial assistance to the Arab national press of a zealous anti-Zionist nature in Israel. However, if until the outbreak of World War II the Nazi regime was still careful to support the Arab national movement, then after the world war began, ties between Nazi Germany and the leaders of the Arab national movement, especially with the Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini, became stronger.\n\nNews article on Jan 1, 1935:[60]\n\nNazi Arabs ... The Nazi idea is spreading among the Arabs in the Land of Israel.\n\nA member of the Executive Committee of the Arab organization from Haifa said at the last Executive Committee meeting that the Arab national youth in Haifa likes the Nazi principles, and believed that the best way to save the Land of Israel from the Jews was to follow these principles.\n\nIn May 1935, as delegates returned from an Arab youth conference in Haifa, their train to Afula bore a swastika chalked on one of the coaches with an Arabic inscription beneath it reading \"Germany over All.\"[61]\n\nIn 1935, the Federation of Arab Youth in Palestine petitioned Hitler to help them prevent the Jews from obtaining additional land in Palestine.[62]\n\nIn summer of 1935, Arabs in Haifa founded Nazi club, The Red Moon. (Red Crescent) [ريد مون ، نادي النازي]. Well financed.[62] They wore 'brown shirts' too.[63] By then, groups of brown-clad Arab youths were organized in the larger cities.[62]\n\nSep 1935 – 'Nuremberg Laws’ & on\n\nWhen Hitler proclaimed the Nuremberg Race Laws in September 1935, a number of Palestinian Arabs sent telegrams congratulating him.[34][64]\n\nAuthor with original documentations: [65]\n\nSigns of sympathy for Hitler and Nazism grew on the Arab street. The swastika flag was also hoisted over Arab homes, Arab cars, and even Arab shoe polishers adorned their crates with the Nazi emblem. Dr. Franz Reichert, a writer for the German News Agency (DNB) in Jerusalem, provided free money to the Arab press, propaganda and photographs about the life of the renewed Germany, and these would devote entire pages to this material. The British saw Dr. Reichert as the main puller In the Nazi spy network in the country, but no action was taken against him. In May 1935, the Palestine-Israeli police learned that extremist Arab nationalists were preparing to form the \"Palestinian Nazi Party\" in order to fight the Jews in coordination with the sister party in the Reich.\n\nThe great momentum of Nazi propaganda in the Middle East occurred in September 1935. When the \"Nuremberg Laws\" against the Jews were discovered and published, Hitler received greetings from all Arab countries and Islam. The largest number came from Palestine, where Nazi propaganda was strongest.\n\nAl-Husseini's Arab Revolt of 1936 took place against the background of the swastika: Arab leaflets and posters prominently displayed the Nazi symbol; the youth organization of the Mufti's political party paraded as \"Nazi-scouts,\" and Arab children greeted each other with the Nazi salute.[66]\n\nProfessor, Author:[67]\n\n…The shrill calls to take up extremist politics invoked a symbolism that glorified youth, violence, and death. By 1936 Al Difaa, the paper of the Istiqlal movement and the most widely read paper in the Arab community, proclaimed, in clearly fascist tones, that \"youth must go out to the field of battle as soldiers of the Fatherland.\" Others argued that the \"Land is in need of a youth, healthy in body and soul like Nazi youth in Germany and the fascist youth in Italy which stands ready for the orders of its leaders and ready to sacrifice its life for the honor of its people and freedom of its fatherland.\" …Nationalist rhetoric accompanied major efforts to build fascist-style youth organizations by recruiting young men to serve as the strike force of the nationalist movement. Throughout the 1930s the children of wealthy Palestinians returned home from European universities having witnessed the emergence of fascist paramilitary forces. Palestinian students educated in Germany returned to Palestine determined to found the Arab Nazi Party. The Husseinis used the Palestinian Arab Party to establish the al-Futuwwa youth corps, which was named after an association of Arab Nazi Scouts. By 1936 the Palestinian Arab Party was sponsoring the developments of storm troops patterned on the German model. These storm troops, all children and youth, were to be outfitted in black trousers and red shirts… The young recruits took the following oath: \"Life — my right; independence — my aspiration; Arabism — my country, and there is no room in it for any but Arabs. In this I believe and Allah is my witness.\" […]\n\nThe al-Futuwwa youth groups connected Palestinian youth to fascist youth movements elsewhere in the Middle East. While the Mufti was establishing youth groups in Palestine, al-Futuwwa groups were established in Iraq...\n\nBy the time the Palestinian uprising began in 1936, the Nazi hatred of the Jew had been incorporated into the existing Muslim narrative.[68] There was an overall relentless, unrestrained anti-Jewish incitement.[69]\n\n1936-39:\n\nHistorian:[70]\n\nDuring the 1936-1939 Palestinian revolt, the swastika was used as a mark of identity: Arabic leaflets and graffiti were liberally decorated with it, Arab children welcomed each other with the Hitler salute and vast numbers of German flags and pictures of Hitler were displayed even at celebrations of Mohammed's birthday.\n\nThe pro Nazi identification was so strong, that those obliged to travel through areas involved in the Palestinian revolt soon learned, that it was prudent to attach a swastika to their vehicle to gain immunity from Arab snipers.[71]\n\nThe most prominent Falastin in 1937 sided openly with Fascist Italy. [72]\n\nIn Jan 1937: [73]\n\nThe Germans in the country in Hitler's chariot\n\nGermans and Arabs welcome \"Hail Hitler\"\n\nThe Arab newspapers report that in German circles in the country, joy was felt yesterday about the results of the referendum in the Saar district [Saarland]. The German churches in Jaffa rang the bells. The Wagner factory in Jaffa closed on Tuesday, as a holiday, and the workers received their wages. Arabs who met German friends greeted each other with the greeting \"Heil Hitler.\"\n\n\"When will the dear Palestine return to the lap of the 'Arab nation'? - Al-Farouqi asks to know in a main article, regarding the results of the referendum in the Saar, in al-Islamiyya [الاسلامية] :\n\nThe Arab expresses joy at the results of the referendum, as \"the German people were oppressed and oppressed. Now we must rejoice that the oppressor has passed.\"\n\nA Feb 1937 report Noted Muslim Awni Abd al-Hadi (leader of the Arab Independence Party and member of the Arab High Committee in Palestine) stating: ‘Arabs Like Nazis.’[74]\n\nArabs Like Nazis , Says Moslem\n\nBerlin, Feb. 23 (WNS) — The Arab national movement has much in common with Nazism, the Voelkische Beobachter reports Auni Bey Hadi , leader of the Arab Independence Party and member of the Arab High Committee in Palestine, as having told its correspondent. The Nazi paper says that the Arab leader made a thorough study of Hitler's Mein Kampf while he was in a... camp in Palestine. He is also quoted as advising Germany to study the Arab market in Palestine because the Arabs are boycotting all goods made or sold by Jews.\n\nA March 1937 report, Arab apprentices Admire Hitler.[75]\n\nA March 1937 report:[76]\n\nThe agent of the well-known German company \"Knoll\" has been staying in Jerusalem for two weeks. While visiting an Arab pharmacy, an Arab patient came in with a prescription and asked for medicine. The owner of the pharmacy sent the wholesaler to fetch the medicine, the agent saw the packaging and found out that the medicine was made in Israel, approached the 'patient' and began preaching Nazi-style morals about buying \"Jewish products from Tel Aviv.\" By the way, he took the prescription from him and saw that the doctor was also a Jew, he could not resist and told the Arab \"Not only are you as an Arab should be ashamed to buy the Zionist products, you also go to a Jewish doctor and this is a danger for you, the Jewish doctor and the Jewish factory [sic] can poison you.\" This was said in the presence of an agent of a well-known English factory, who considered him an Englishman.\n\nIt is worth noting that this Nazi agent arranges large orders among the Jews.\n\nBy May 1937, \"All Arabs\" celebrated Muhammad's birthday \"Hitler and Duce Cheered.\" - NY Times.[77] Described at the time in JTA[78] May, 1937: \"Swastikas Fly As Arabs Mark Mohammed’s Birthday.\"\n\nArab children thronged the teeming section’s narrow, winding streets, shouting: “Death to the High Commissioner (Sir Arthur Grenfell Wauchope)! Death to the Jews!” Booklets explaining Nazi methods of forcing Jews from the Reich are being distributed freely. Arabs in Haifa and Jaffa prepared for the birthday celebrations, scheduled for today and tomorrow, by proclaiming a work stoppage and organizing demonstrations.\n\nThe Government Education Department issued orders prohibiting Arab pupils to participate in the demonstrations. Arabs newspapers, however, are urging the pupils to disobey.\n\nNazi Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels praised the Arabs' \"national .. conscience,\" noting that \"Nazi flags fly in Palestine and they adorn their houses with Swastikas and portraits of Hitler.[79]\n\nThese special Hitler / Mussolini decorations were seen already days before, ahead and in preparation of the Muslim holiday.[80]\n\nOn July 15, 1937, the Mufti met with Walter Döhle German consul in Jerusalem, and offered to send an Arab delegate to Berlin.[81][82] Döhle reported back to Germany that the plan would be that Germany will put out anti-Jewish declarations but not being pro-Arab.[81] The Mufti was disappointed and tried in November 1937 sending another delegate to Berlin. [83] Walter Doehle, wrote:[84]:\n\n“Palestinian Arabs in all social strata have great sympathies for the new Germany and its Führer … If a person identified himself as a German when faced with threats from an Arab crowd, this alone generally allowed him to pass freely. But when some identified themselves by making the ‘Heil Hitler’ salute, in most cases the Arabs’ attitude became expressions of open enthusiasm, and the German gave ovations, to which the Arabs responded loudly.”\n\nUnveiled documents:[85]\n\n‘Arabs admire our Fuhrer’ - “The Palestinian Arabs show on all levels a great sympathy for the new Germany and its Fuhrer, a sympathy whose value is particularly high as it is based on a purely ideological foundation,” a Nazi official in Palestine wrote in a letter to Berlin in 1937. He added: “Most important for the sympathies which Arabs now feel towards Germany is their admiration for our Fuhrer, especially during the unrests, I often had an opportunity to see how far these sympathies extend. When faced with a dangerous behaviour of an Arab mass, when one said that one was German, this was already generally a free pass.”\n\nIn 1937, Adolf Eichmann and two SS officers carried out a mission to the Middle East accompanied by the head of the Hitler Youth, Baldur von Schirach who later funded an \"Arab Club\" in Damascus where German Nazis trained recruits for the mufti's growing army of insurgents.[68] He was quickly expelled by the British.[86] \"Eichmann reported from his visit to Israel: The creation of a Jewish State must be prevented.\"[87]\n\nEichmann's project included a friendly[71] visit with the mufti in Egypt.[87] It was after this visit, in fact, that Haj Amin went on the Nazi payroll as an agent and propagandist.[71]\n\n[Worth mentioning: Among the collaborators with Hitler was the Mufti, a small fish. The Norwegians had Vidkun Quisling, the Belgians had Leon Degrelle, the Dutch the Waffen-SS unit, the largest outside Germany, the Ukrainians Stepan Bandera, the Russians General Andrey Andreyevich Vlasov and Azov Battalion, and more and more. Each of these names was a much more \"respectable\" collaborator with the Third Reich and its plans than the Mufti.[88]]\n\nNazi backing Arab violent riots against the Brits and Jews\n\nSuspicion of Nazi involvement was already at the beginning, in 1936, with Germans arrested and German made rifles at Arab rioters.[89] Arabs were captured with smuggled Nazi Arms.[90]\n\nIn 1937, French paper Marianne exposed Nazi armament of Arab Terrorists.[91]\n\nMore evidence seen on the ground in 1938.[92]\n\nIndeed, Nazis 'shipped arms to Palestinians,' British National Archives unveiled presence of Nazi S.S. agents in Mandatory Palestine, working closely with Palestinian leaders, at least since 1937.[85]\n\nIn Oct 1938,[93] The Scotsman in a leading article on the Palestine question, stated: \"No British Government can impose a scheme which would ultimately make it possible for the Arabs to massacre the Jews. Such a solution breathes the spirit of Hitler, not of England.\"\n\nIn Sep 1938, at a US paper: 'Arabs Hail Hitler As Liberator… Arabs Look to Hitler.’[94]\n\nIn Sep 1938, ‘’a hundred Palestine Arabs visited the Nazi party conference in Nuremberg.’’[95][72]\n\n(Noted[96]) author:[97]\n\nThe Mufti of Jerusalem, encouraged by Axis successes in Abyssinia and Central Europe, had seized power among the Palestine Arabs... Passing an Arab shop one might hear a record chanting in Arabic, \"Slaughter the Jews!\" Photographs of Hitler began to spring up in Arab barber shops and cafés, side by side with those of the Mufti. Youngsters in Arab villages marched about waving small swastika flags.\n\nAuthor in 1947:[72]\n\nNeedless to say, how great was the effect of the German victories, in the first period of the war, on the Arabs of the country, and how difficult was then the impression of their defeat: an Egyptian, who visited the country in the days after the conquest of Berlin wrote: \"The people cry in the morning and sob in the evening. And blow to their cheek between morning and evening.\"\n\nAt (بيرزيت) Bir Zeit most of the students wrote A. Hitler,’ in answer to 'a great man,' when explained as 'a man who influences the spirits of his contemporaries.' [98]\n\nOn Jan 26, 1939, a large shipment of Hitler’s \"Mein Kampf\" in Arab translation arrived in Palestine from Egypt.[99]\n\nNazism at Arabs: Ideology too, not just \"practical\" allies.\n\nHistorian:[17]\n\nThe evaluation of Arab Nazism in the 1930s, with Hitler's rise to power, must be seen against this background of identity values. The common explanation as if there was a common interest of hostility to France and Britain, which united allies against a common enemy and allegedly pushed the Arabs into Hitler's arms is only a partial explanation, but as a basic claim it is tainted with excessive simplicity and historical distortion. Admiration for Hitler and his party existed on the Arab street as early as the days of the Fuhrer's struggle in the 1920s, and it erupted with great enthusiasm immediately upon his rise to power in 1933. The first congratulatory telegrams he received the day after his appointment as chancellor came to him from Wolf, the German consul in Jerusalem, following which warm greetings flowed from other Arab countries. Although the violation of the Versailles Agreements was a blatant defiance of France and Britain, it came only in 1936, with the violation of the ban on armaments of Germany, and in 1938 with the \"Anschluss\" - annexation of Austria. In 1933, and in the period that lasted at least until the attack on Poland in September 1939, there was no reason to assume that Hitler, an \"Anglophile\" who based (in Mein Kampf) Germany's long-term strategy of cooperating with Great Britain as a principle of the new world order, as he envisioned it, would the one who would save the Arabs from English colonialism.\n\nAs soon as Hitler came to power, parties were formed in Arab countries that were imitations of National Socialism...\n\nThe Falastin since 1932/3 was ‘excited’ about Nazi Germany.[100][101] During some period of time, it openly carried pro Hitlerism. During other periods, for example to avoid discipline, censorship and or penalties, it, for a while, used sneaky tricky ways, that is, to glorify Nazis by carefully selected \"reports\" elaborating on Axis advances and 'excite' its readers on Hitler while cherry picking negative or critical of the Allies steps citing sources from Western countries, so the investigators wouldn't act. In addition, often inserting \"news\" as a subtitle under those articles, as if its source is the same... [57][39] In all, Falastin, as well as almost all other Arab newspapers in Palestine cheered for Hitler[102]\n\nOverview:[103]\n\nIn September 1933, al-Difa' called the struggle against the Zionists a jihad (holy war), and warned that anyone who did not take a part in this war was committing a sin. The Arabic press also featured cartoon caricatures of the Jews, in the best tradition of Der Stürmer, the Nazi anti-Semitic weekly.\n\nFor instance, in September 1932, Filastin printed a cartoon depicting Zionism as an intimidating crocodile, opening its mouth wide to swallow two Arab peasants, while an armed British soldier stood by calmly.\n\nMir'at al-Sharq (Mirror of the World) was the only Arab newspaper that dared to go against the trend. In April 1935 it urged Arab-Jewish co-operation, arguing that the Arabs and the Jews were cousins, and Palestine was the only safe haven for them.\n\nThe paper was denounced by the rest of the Arabic press, and accused of collaborating with the Jews.\n\nDuring the days of the 1941 uprising in Iraq, preparations were made in Palestine for the resumption of the uprising. Posters with a swastika on their heads were distributed among the Arabs and called for an alliance with the Germans.[104]\n\nAndré Palert, the Marianne French (active 1930-40 noted) magazine's special correspondent in Jerusalem, reported at least since 1937 how Mussolini woos the Arabs and about the Mufti's extremism.[105]\n\nIn October, 1938, he interviewed the Mufti at the Haram al-Sharif and was informed that Italian arms and funds were reaching the Holy Land[106] In 1938, Marianne:[107] [108]\n\nArab journals Falastin and Al Difa'a publish every week articles with a racial tendency and frequently reproduce large portraits of various leaders of the Third Reich. They do not even try to conceal the fact that they have become pupils of the Ministry of Propaganda in Berlin.\n\nDocumented at the time and quoted in a May 22, 1939, session:[109]\n\nAlready in 1935—I am quoting the editor of the \"Quarterly Review,\"— 50 German agents were sent to Africa and the Near East. Their destinations, among orhers, were Haifa and Jaffa.\n\nThey were given instructions to carry on the most intensive propaganda efforts among the natives. In 1936 — I am quoting the \"Daily Telegraph\" —the Jerusalem police intercepted documents proving that the Arab raiders received £ 50,000 from Germany and £ 20,000 from Italy for the purpose of strengthening their resistance.\n\nWe know that British officers in Palestine talk freely of the German and Italian arms and money that the terrorists have received. We know that the land mines by which British soldiers have been murdered could not be made and could not be operated by the Arabs. We know that on one occasion the bloodhounds followed the trail from a land mine to a blacksmith's shop in the German colony of Waldenheim. We know that Dr. Goebbels has established a propaganda school for Arabs in Berlin.\n\nIn Sep 1939:[110]\n\nHitler's speech was repeatedly broadcast in Arabic from Berlin on Friday and yesterday. The Berlin Station also broadcast attacks in Arabic on Great Britain for alleged ill treatment of Arabs in Palestine and elsewhere.\n\nHaj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem[111] (who chose to \"believe\" the old bloodlibel canard of ritual murder, since his youth[112] and was directly involved in organizing the 1929 riots that destroyed the 3,000-year-old Jewish community of Hebron[71] - brutal 1929 Hebron massacre [113]) his Nazi style hatred was manifested already in 1937. As a venomous brochure was distributed at the Bludan conference, attended by over 400 Arabs in Sep. 1937, entitled \"Islam and Jewry.\" It has been described as history's \"first text that propagated sheer Jew-hatred in an Islamic context by mixing selected anti-Jewish episodes of Mohammed’s life with the so-called wickedness [sic] of Jews in the 20th century.\"[114] Ahmad Shukeiri also helped spread his message which he described as a European Crusade against Islam, and declared that the Arab people would rise and fight world Jewry...[115] At that conference the Mufti was elected pan Arab president. The brochure has been translated into German in 1938.[116]\n\nA highlight of the 1936-9 Arab riots’ atrocities is the Tiberias 1938 massacre.[117][118]\n\nReport at the time: The Jewish neighborhood never had issues with its Arab neighbors. In-between their atrocious acts, the Arab attackers sat down and ate calmly at a house they invaded. Their \"heroic\" acts was aimed at defenseless. Brother and sister were found held together. People were burned, some while alive. Witnesses said orders were given over in a European language and an Arab official translated into Arabic to the large gang. There were screams to kill the Jews in Arabic and 'Allah Akbar.'[119] Author:[120]\n\nArabs stormed a Jewish neighborhood in Tiberias, killing 19 people, including 11 children.\n\nThe truck driver Alex Morrison arrived in town shortly after the attackers left. \"They left behind one of the most horrible sights I have ever seen in my life,\" he later wrote: the place was littered with corpses, men, women and children. \"The women's naked bodies testified that the assailants made the most horrific use of their knives,\" Morrison wrote.\n\nIn one building, probably a baby house, the scorched bodies of children were still burning; It was obvious that fuel had been poured on them before they were set on fire.\n\n(There is a version that there was some Nazi link to the Arab gang as well.[121])\n\nA Nov. 1940 report from Cairo on Axis’ efforts to incite Arabs against Britain and Jews, while Egypt under Britain tried to counter it. [122] A Nov 1 report:[123]\n\nBroadcasts Appeal To Arabs\n\nIn a new effort to arouse the Arabs against Britain, the Zeesen radio broadcast on its Arabic program an official German declaration pledging complete German sympathy in the Arab struggle for independence. The Fascist radio, in a highly colored version of the London Zionist conference asserted that it proved the alliance between Britain and the Jews is working satisfactorily against the Palestine Arabs. Replying to the German declaration, the Egyptian radio broadcast a statement to the Arab world reminding Arabs that Hitler had called them a savage people living in the dark ages.\n\nThe statement pointed out that while Hitler promised the Arabs independence, his Italian ally had stolen the rights and freedom of the Arabs of Tripoli and the independence of Islamic Albania.\n\nThere were efforts also from the US, in 1942, to counter Nazi propaganda: [124][125]\n\nTo counteract Axis propaganda to the Arabs, with accent on the legend that Hitler is a Moslem and a direct descendant of Mohammed, short-wave station WRUL in Boston has begun a regular program directed at Arab sources. WRUL has also undertaken to short-wave a weekly Hebrew period, intended for listeners in Palestine and elsewhere.\n\nThrough their led massacre on Iraqi Jews in 1941, al-Kailani and al-Husseini wanted to signal, there in a 2,500-year-old community, how Arabia’s Jews should be treated.[126]\n\nExplained:[127]\n\nFrom the way of nature came the struggle for the Land of Israel and instilled a great deal of venom and power in all those elements of Islam that were hostile to Jews and Judaism. Although it is quite clear that these foundations intensified in the Middle East for many years before the establishment of the State of Israel. The status of the Jewish minorities in the Arab world, as well as the status of Christians and non-Arab groups, became increasingly intolerable (and unrelated to Zionism) in the face of pan-Arabism, unique nationalism, overt anti-Semitism, and the resurgence of Muslim fanaticism.\n\nAll these trends, which have omitted the ground beneath the feet of the old Jewish communities in Arab countries, drew their power out of a common disgrace to the West and its emancipatory heritage. For it was not Islam but the hated colonialists who granted equal rights to the Jewish and Christian minorities in the Middle East. Against this background it is easy to understand why there was Nazism (and especially its anti-Jewish elements) to arouse such enthusiasm and admiration among the Arabs in the 1930s and 1940s. The words written by Haj Amin al-Husseini, the Mufti of Jerusalem and the leader of the Arabs of Israel, to Adolf Hitler on January 20, 1941, did not in any way contradict the general tone of the Arab nationalism of the period. \"Arab nationalism owes Your Excellency a debt of gratitude and of recognition for having repeatedly [again and again] brought up in ringing speeches the 'question of Palestine.'\"\n\nIn fact, the \"question of Palestine\" was intended only a marginal place in Hitler's policy and German policy until the outbreak of the war, although the Mufti did not err in seeing Hitler and German leaders as 'anti-Zionists', as opposed to the Stalinist, Trotskyist and leftist fabrications.\n\nTaha Pasha al Hashimi and the Mufti\n\nNoted in 1946:[128]\n\nIraqi Palestine Defense Society. This Society has been responsible for making the Mufti's propaganda in 'Iraq, they issued their own paper, and wrote articles and fabricated news items for other newspapers, and prepared Arabic broadcasts for the German Minisrer to cable to Germany for broadcasting in the Berlin Arabic broadcasts.\n\nThis work threw Taha Pasha into close touch with the German Legation staff who naturally were highly desirous of making contacts with this anti-British body.\n\nThis was not Taha Pasha's only contact with the Germans and Palestinians and perhaps his most important contact was his close friendship for Dr. Amin Ruwaiha - Germany's No. 1 Arab agent.\n\nDr. Amin's wife's sister became Taha Pasha's mistress and a close friendship was established between these two. Amin Ruwaiha had been closely connected with Fawzi al Qaoukji and had assisted him to get arms and to gang to Palestine in the summer of 1936.\n\nNoted in 1947:[129]\n\nA key person in the Mufti's organization was Taha Pasha al-Hashimi, who had become Iraqi Defense Minister in 1938. Before that, he had been president of the Iraqi Palestine Defense Society in charge of the Mufti's propaganda and responsible for the preparation of the for the Nazi program broadcasts... Taha Pasha was in close contact with Germany's \"number one\" Arab agent, Dr. Amin Ruwaiha, and through him, with the German Legation.\n\nFrom British Record:[130]\n\nTaha was the co-founder of the Pan Arab Nazi Club Al-Muthanna in Baghdad in 1935. He was co-founder and President of the Iraqi Society for the Society for the Defense of Palestine which prepared Arabic broadcasts for the Berlin radio. This work brought Taha in close This work brought Taha in close touch with the German Embassy and the Nazi agent , Dr. Amin Rawaiha. The latter was interned in Rhodesia by the British, together with Jamal Husseini. Taha also was close to the Golden Square, a pro-Fascist group of army officers who were the chief backers of the Rashid Ali revolt. As Minister of Defense, Taha made every effort to prevent Iraq from breaking off relations with Nazi Germany if war broke out.\n\nHe put active pro-Nazis in key positions and played a very significant role in the interference in political affairs of Iraqi army officers.\n\nNazi views on Palestine had their roots in Hitler's pathological \"fear\" of 'International Jewry' [sic] in his mein kampfand his \"belief\" that the Zionists are not sincere and that the Jews do not really aim to establish a State in Palestine. Claiming: \"They have no thought of building up a Jewish state in Palestine.\" He Only referenced to Palestine issue that once in his \"book.\"[131]\n\n(And when some Zionists, controversially, were involved in Haavara transfer to save Jews, whom Nazi Germany did not want to have at all,[132][87] Zionist Haavara saved some 80,000 Jewish lives from the hands of the Nazis.[133][134] Yet, by late 1937 an anti-Nazi German official involved in administering the agreement suggested that fear in Nazi circles that it might lead to a Jewish state, to which Hitler was implacably opposed, was leading to suggestions \"it should be terminated.\"[132]\n\nIt ended in 1939 / outbreak of WW2. Later on, Eichmann became the appointee on Jews. Massacres of Jews began systematically in 1941. And the Jan 29, 1942 Wannsee Conference on the \"Final Solution\" intensified the plan of total extermination.[135])\n\nWith Syria's Shukri al-Quwatli [6 May 1891 – 30 June 1967] and (Syrian born Saudi Arabian official) Sheikh Yusuf Yasin [Yousuf Yassin, 1888−19 April 1962]\n\nGerman documents recalled in 1957:[136]\n\nSaudi Arabian King Saud's Secretary of State has been revealed by captured German archives to have been a leader of a pro-Nazi Arab collaboration committee. He is Sheikh Yusuf Yasin who this year obtained renewed agreement of Washington to the barring of American personnel of Jewish faith from the U. S. Air Force base at Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.\n\nA search of previously secret German documents captured by the U. S. Army in Berlin reveals a memorandum on Arab collaboration with Hitler. It was submitted to the German Foreign Ministry on August 27, 1940, by Nazi Minister Fritz Grobba. The memorandum pertains to negotiations with Hitler's leading Arab supporter, the so-called Grand Mufti, Haj Amin el Husseini.\n\nNot only does the document expose the membership of the present Saudi Arabian official on the Arab committee for pro-Nazi collaboration but it shows that the current President of Syria was also a member. He is Shukri Kuwatli.\n\nDISCUSSED ARMS\n\nAccording to the German records, the Grand Mufti, Sheikh Yusuf, Kuwatli, and others worked with the Nazis against the Allies.\n\nThey backed the pro-Hitler revolt of Rashid Ali al-Gailani in Iraq. A general uprising in Palestine was envisaged. Arrangements were discussed for provision of munitions through Axis channels for use against the British forces and Jewish inhabitants.\n\nAt the time, he represented Saudi Arabia on the pro-German Committee of Collaboration under the chairmanship of the Grand Mufti, Sheikh Yusuf was private secretary to the present King Saud's father. Today Sheikh Yusuf continues his interest in the Jewish problem by seeking io persuade Secretary of State Dulles to keep Israeli shipping out of the Gulf of Akaba. Although the world-wide Nazi movement was thought to have collapsed with the fall of Germany in 1945, Arabs organized by the Hitler apparatus are still striving to complete the Nazi blueprint against world Jewry. Syrian President Kuwatli is today collaborating with another totalitarianism—Communism.\n\nThe German records raise serious questions about the reliability of the Arabs as friends of the West An August 20, 1940 directive from the German Foreign Ministry to its ambassadors abroad reported that leading Arab personalities have in recent times repeatedly approached our foreign missions to advance collaboration and collusion. Berlin recommended that the Arabs be assured of \"Germany's full sympathy in their people's fight for liberation.\" German propagandists were instructed to champion the \"liberation of the Arab world from imperialism.\"\n\nVITAL AREA\n\nToday the Soviet Union is operating under almost precisely the same strategy in its campaign of collusion with Arab extremists The Soviet goal is the same as Hitler's.\n\nDomination of the Middle East is seen by Khrushchev as strategically vital.\n\nOne top secret document revealed that in 1940 an agreement on Palestine was formulated. In it Germany and Italy recognize the right of the Arab countries to solve the question of the Jewish elements in Palestine and the other Arab countries in a manner that conforms to the national and ethnic interests of the Arabs, and to the solution of the Jewish question in the countries of Germany and Italy.\n\nOn August 6, 1940, Franz von Papen, German Ambassador in Turkey, cabled Berlin of his meeting with the Grand Mufti. The cable made known that the pro-Nazi Arab clique that included the present Saudi Arabian Secretary of State wished to cooperate with Hitler by organizing a revolt in Palestine.\n\nVon Papen reported that an understanding was reached with Saudi Arabia on the removal of pro-British King Abdullah of Transjordan and the annexation of that territory to Palestine. The Grand Mufti wrote Hitler on June 21, 1940, that Arab Palestine which had been \"fighting the democracies and international Jewry, is ready at any time to assume an active role.\"\n\nHistorian:[137]\n\nIn Iraq, its rulers extended open aid to the Arabs of Israel [Palestine] by supporting the Germans.\n\nIn Jaffa, Nablus and Tulkarm there were many attending gatherings with Arab and Italian agents, who organized the young people to shout cheers: 'Viva Italia! Viva Duce! And Heil Hitler!’\n\nIn a proclamation distributed, signed by Hitler, they called on their audience to fight the English.\n\nIn Acre, courses for instructors were organized in military cells. An Arab was apprehended by the Jordan Guard on May 19, 1940, with a letter and a considerable sum of money in his hand intended to act as the commander of the Arab Revolt in the Near East, who was required to begin terrorist acts. Hitler was called by the conspiratorial name - Abu Ali. In Baghdad, Arab leaders gathered and discussed the question of disturbances against the Jews of Israel [Palestine], according to the instructions of German agents. In return, Germany promised the Arabs, the deportation of the Jews ... The Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who moved to Syria, demanded immediate terrorist attacks. Subhi Zivan and his brother Rostor Zivan from Tira were appointed to manage the Arab gang operations in the Haifa district. Abu Ali, head of the Arab al-Wahab tribe, located between Rosh Pina and Yesod HaMaala, was given the role of managing the fifth column in Israel [Palestine].\n\nSaid Shakid, one of the gang leaders, returned to Israel. In a proclamation distributed in Ramallah he warned the British that he would fight alongside Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini (he was caught after a shootout in Beitunia). Most of the gang members who fled to Iraq, after the events of 1936-1939, returned to Syria to prepare for riots in Israel.\n\nNews report of June 1, 1941: Nazis run guns to the Arabs in Palestine. In addition, Nazi war planes taking off from Iraq dropped leaflets inciting the Arabs for a 'holy war' against the British and the Jews. The intensive anti-Jewish propaganda campaign conducted by the Nazis is becoming increasingly effective among certain sections of the Arab population.[138]\n\nIn 1942, several swastikas were found at the Jehoshaphat Cave in the Kidron Valley.[139]\n\nInteresting analysis at the time (1941):[140]\n\nNazi Campaign on Russ Same as Jewish Attack\n\nPHILADELPHIA (JPS)—The Nazi attack upon Russia was a scheme , aimed at dividing the Christian world, which had been planned as coolly by the Nazis as their earlier campaign in which Jews were the principal pawns, according to Demaree Bess, chief foreign correspondent of the Saturday Evening Post.\n\nMr. Bess, writing under the title of Hitler Bids for Christian Allies, expresses the view that Hitler’s drive against Russia was calculated to divide and bewilder Catholic countries in Europe, France, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Ireland and Catholic communities in South America, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn the course of his article Mr. Bess said: It took outsiders a long time to discover all the objectives aimed at by the Nazi anti-Jewish movement. It wasnt appreciated at first that Hitler was using the Jews, in part, to persuade the Moslem world that he was the defender of the Arabs against the Jews, to maneuver the British Empire into the appearance of championing the Jews against the Arabs.\n\nAnd now in this latest psychological campaign Hitler plotted to use Red Russians as similar pawns. He assumed the post of defender of Christian Europe against Atheist Russia, seeking thus to paralyze opposition to his imperialist schemes in large sections of the Christian world by maneuvering the British Empire and the United States into the role of accomplices of Bolshevism.\n\n1941 Operation Barbarossa & on[]\n\nOperation Barbarossa marked the beginning of wholesale massacres on Jews. Einsatzgruppen squads began to carry out mass shootings during the last week of June 1941.[141]\n\nYad Vashem Prof.:[142]\n\nHitler was obsessed against the Jews at least since 1920. He didn’t need any \"help\" from the Mufti in his annihilation plan which was ‘understood’ among his Nazi top hierarchy as the scheme already in 1939.[142]\n\nMufti Husseini met Hitler on 28 Nov, 1941 whereby the Nazi leader also made clear his extermination plan.[126][143]\n\nAhmad Shukeiri and the Mufti's gang, who worked first with the Communists against the Allies, yet, since Russia joined the Allies in 1941, Shukairy and gang went to Hitler's side all the way, to help him in his programs against the Jews. [144][145]\n\n\"Through his radio broadcasts and other work during World War II.. instilled Nazi images of the Jew,\"[146] and called to kill the Jews wherever they are. He had at least six stations - Berlin, Zeissen, Bari, Rome, Tokyo and Athens.[147] During his \"Holy War,\" he encouraged his followers to display the swastika on their posters and fliers, vehicles flying the swastika flag were ensured protection when driving through neighborhoods that the grand mufti's followers controlled, they taught children mobilized to back the revolt to give the stiff-armed Nazi salute in greeting.[148]\n\n\"Allah in heaven; on earth, Hitler!\" - was WWII-era Arabic saying.[147]\n\nIn his book, on one hand, the Mufti lied about facts, such as denying his visiting concentration camps as photos showed him wrong,[126] or his statements he quoted as “facts\" what Himmler told him. Yet, he couldn’t hide his hatred, writing, “Hitler hated the Jews ... Hitler is now avenging this accursed [sic] race …”[16]\n\nIn 1943, SS Chief Heinrich Himmler sent warm wishes to Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini. It includes a promise by Heinrich Himmler – one of the architects of the “final solution” – that “Nazi Germany will stand by the Arab people in Palestine in their struggle against the ‘miserable’ Balfour Declaration. Another document that attests to a connection between Nazi Germany and Mufti Hajj Amin al-Husseini.[150][151]\n\nWritten in 1942:\n\n[152]\n\nOut of a population of a Million and a half, over five hundred thousands are Jews, chiefly of European origin and wholeheartedly dedicated to the democratic cause. The notorious Mufti Haj Amin el-Husseini, was in exile and the power of his terrorists followers had been broken. Arch conspirator, now an honorary member of the Nazi party, still has his network of agents and associates -- a dangerous Fifth Column -- who eagerly await his messages from abroad and secretly hope and work for \"the day\" when they may join hands openly with the Axis powers and be reunited with their own fuehrer-in-exile.\n\nPalestinian-Arab scholar Edward Said, has conceded that Husseini \"represented the Palestinian Arab national consensus.\" He had \"the backing of political parties that functioned in Palestine,\" and was \"recognised in some form by Arab governments as the voice of the Palestinian people.\"[153][154][34][155]\n\nAforementioned Mufti’s then[156][157] henchman Ahmad Shukeiri [Al-Shukairy, Shukairy, shuqayri] helped Hitler,[144] (who even rationalized the Holocaust in 1946,[158] has spread vile Nazi type of propaganda at the UN[159] and had promoted neo-Nazi stormtroop gang,[160][161][162][163][164] who guarded monsters: Adolf Eichmann, 'Dr. Death' - J. Mengele,[165] he promoted them after the world was shocked to hear these Nazis tortured, carved on a Jewish girl swastika as revenge for killing Eichmann), as well as other Arab icons[64] including: Nimr el-Hattab, Amin el-Khouri, Subhi el-Hadra,[166] Rasem Khalidi,[167] Emil Ghouri, Wasef Kamal,[168][169] helped Hitler at least from 1941 on.\n\nExiled initially by the Brits, Arab Palestinians from the mufti's camp, who were working actively for the Germans against the British -- asides from Jamal Husseini his principle aide[58] (continuing to act under his direction in 1946[170][171]) -- included: Akram Zuaiter,[172] Fawzi al-Qawuqji,[173] Amin Tamimi,[174][152][175] Mu'in al-Madi, 'Abd al-Qader al-Husseini.[176][177]\n\nArabs from other areas assisting the Mufti Nazi campaign, asides from Iraqis, include Tunisian born Hussein Triki.[178][179]\n\nThe (Jews paid Arabs to join British army,[180] a large portion of Arabs that did fight in Palestine came from across the Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, to the recruitment bureaus in Palestine, and many of them enlisted with the intention of acquiring weapons for themselves,[181] and there is that Shukairy's testimony[182] in his book about almost no one agreeing in 1940 to help in British war effort. In any case) 1941 poll[183] showed Palestine Arabs overwhelmingly supported the Nazis.\n\nIn 1942, many Arabs in Palestine reacted with 'open joy' upon hearing Jews' fate in Europe.[184]\n\nCIA Report Aug 1942:[185]\n\nA majority of the Palestinian Arabs was fiercely \"anti-Jewish\" and saw in the approach of Rommel an ideal opportunity to murder all Jews their seize their property.\n\nProfessor, historian:[182]\n\nShuqayri was expressing the attitudes and feelings of his countrymen... He describes the great excitement with which they used to listen to German and Italian broadcasts, how he would follow during the night the military communiqués, marking on a map the places being occupied by the victorious Germans and meet his friends the following morning to discuss triumphs exceeding those of the previous day: Our sympathies were with the Axis powers being led by Hitler from victory to victory, and with our sympathies went our prayers for the victory of Germany and her allies, and defeat for Britain... When the British government announced the formation of a Palestine force to help the war effort, our young men received the durective: do not join the Palestine force, and the response was quasi-unanimous.\n\nThe Mufti had an entire group of \"Palestinian\" Arabs working for the Nazis. A number of Arab doctors, who were members of a Palestinian and Syrian nationalists group, even served in the Nazi army, at least one of them in an extermination camp.[186] (Arab or Arabs serving in Nazi extermination camp in Europe is apart from nazi camps in Arab lands,[187] where THE torturers of Jews were Arab [188]).\n\nThe far reaching destruction by the Mufti included: interference against Jewish children who were about to escape deaths;[189] his led instigation, Futuwah Arab Hitler-youth gang's agitation, prelude to the brutal Farhud (al-Farhoud) massacre in June-1941 Baghdad,[190] where as many as 1,000 Jews could have died.[191]\n\nIt was: the emissaries of the Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, and Groba, the political attaché of Nazi Germany in Baghdad, who provoked incitement against Iraqi Jews.[192]\n\nThere was a direct link between Nazi influences and the crimes of the Farhud and the influence by the Mufti's dominant figure in Iraq:[193]\n\nFor two days.. Jews were murdered by Arabs in severe riots. Thousands of Jews were beaten, women were raped and hundreds of children were orphaned by fathers who were murdered or disappeared on their way to police investigations. Homes and shops of 50,000 Jews were looted in the capital, Baghdad. The riots that took place in Iraq were called the Farhud - the robbery or looting in Hebrew. They were carried out against an anti-Semitic background encouraged by the pro-Nazi Iraqi regime... During the British Mandate in Iraq, the situation of the Jews was very good. They were businessmen and economists who were very successful personally and brought Iraq to economic prosperity. After the Arab uprising in Israel, the flourishing of Arab nationalism in Iraq and the rise of Nazism in Iraq, the status of the Jews began to deteriorate and they suffered harassment. The German ambassador to Iraq, Fritz Grobba, has been launching poisonous propaganda against Iraqi Jews since 1933. \"He bought the local al-'Alam al-'Arabi (\"The Arab World\") newspaper, and through it began brainwashing the Jews, publishing Hitler's book Mein Kampf translated into Arabic,\" says Dr. Nissim Kazzaz, an Orientalist, historian and expert on Iraq in modern times. \"Nazi propaganda penetrated various sections of the Iraqi population including educators and military personnel. He convinced the Iraqis that the Jews were driving the British regime and therefore should be killed. \"A pro-Nazi was appointed on the recommendation of Ambassador Grobba.\"\n\nIn 1939, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was in contact with Adolf Hitler, arrived in Iraq from Iraq. He became a dominant figure in Iraq and managed to establish a secret society headed by him. The association included two former Iraqi prime ministers, a Mein Kampf translator, and senior pro-Nazi officers. This association revolutionized in April 1941, with German support and assistance. That same year a war broke out between the Iraqi army and the British army. Baghdad Radio reported victories at the front, the people took to the streets of Baghdad and shots were fired in the air as a sign of joy. The Iraqi broadcasting station turned to the Iraqis and made it clear to them that after the victory over the British, the internal enemy - that is, the Jews - would be next in line. Rashid Ali, an Iraqi leader backed by the Nazis and Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini, ruled the capital for two months, but the coup eventually failed. After the Iraqi army failed against the British army senior government officials fled Iraq. Yunis al-Sab'awi, translator of the book Mein Kampf declared himself governor and distributed 400 rifles to the youth organizations that obeyed his order. His intention was to massacre Jews, but his plan was thwarted by an internal security committee set up in Baghdad. However, his men took part in operations against the Jews in Farhud.\n\nHard evidence At the Farhud riots, Orientalist Dr. Kazzaz was an 11-year-old boy. The day the riots opened was also the last day he saw his father. The first thing they did was start attacking the Jews. They caught Jews in the streets and accused them of signaling to British planes where to shell. Jews were murdered or beaten in the streets, others were taken for police interrogation on false pretenses, some disappeared and did not return to their families and the others were released by the Jewish community by paying bribes to police officers. As the harassment escalated, my father ordered us to shut ourselves in the house like many Jews in Baghdad. For a month we were in houses and did not go out anywhere that was not necessary. \"The announcement on official Iraqi radio that the fighting was over was a calming siren for the Jews, who left their homes and hurried to visit their relatives and get back to normal. My father sold silk and gold threads and also bought trained horses for competitions. And his brother to the horse stables that was in an Arab neighborhood. Towards dark we wanted to go home. We got on an eight-passenger minibus and started driving. After a few minutes we saw a crowd of people. The driver stopped and the crowd noticed us.\n\n\"My father's partner who was sitting in the front seat and was dressed in holiday clothes, was identified as a Jew and marked as a target. The mob attacked him, pulled him out of the vehicle and started beating him to death. My father who saw the situation got out of the car and apparently went to call for help. \"He resumed the trip and Dad disappeared. We did not sit well with Dad because we were sure he found shelter. Charlatans who asked for money testified that they saw him in rural areas of Bedouin tribes demanding ransom for him. Others claimed to have seen him in northern Iraq and that also turned out to be false.\" [...]\n\nFor two days, Iraqis, who were full of Nazi hatred, beat Iraqi Jews. \"We went back to fortifying the houses and heard the screams from the nearby houses. Families who tried to identify their dead loved ones were unsuccessful because their faces were mutilated. Some of the Jews were buried in a mass grave.\"\n\n\"The Nazis began recruiting Arabs to the Wehrmacht as early as the summer of 1941 when the starting point was the coup in Iraq, after the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was exiled to Iraq from Beirut and tried to establish pro - Nazi rule with Iraq's former prime minister, Rashid al-Khilani,\" explains Dr. Stefan Patka, a doctoral student and researcher at the Berlin University of Technology, who discovered rare documentation showing North African Muslim soldiers trained during World War II. and fought in the service of the Wehrmacht.[194]\n\nThe Mufti is also responsible for thousands of deaths through his linked Muslim SS troops, (where Imams played a major role in morale of the soldiers),[195] the Handschar. He organized the killing of 12,600 Bosnian Jews by Muslims whom he recruited.[84]\n\nWorth mentioning ‘’’Mufti’’’’s failed ‘’’plan’’’ of ‘’’establishing crematoria’’’ in the Dothan Valley.[196] He also visited in a \"tour\" of at least one concentration camp.[197] And his ‘’Operation Atlas’’ in 1944, where according to some versions it included a plan to poison a quarter of a Million Jews in Tel Aviv - failed. [16]\n\nAround 1942, there was a secret Nazi squad, headed by a kind of German \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" The entire formation battalion contained Arabs across the Jordan, Syria and Palestine [Israel] - all of whom had lived in Germany for a long time. The squad had to follow in the footsteps of von Kleist's army to the Caucasus Mountains and after the defeat of the Russians would move to Persia as a political and military nucleus of the attack against the British. (Source doesn't name the Mufti being connected to this particular squad).[198]\n\nIn Feb 1944, in the village of Sarafand (Arabic: الصرفند‎), an Arab named Suleiman Abdullah was shot dead for espionage. He was arrested a month earlier while handing over plans to one of the enemy agents.[199]\n\nNazis' planned 'extermination of the Jews in Palestine,'[143] stopped with El Alamein defeat, relied on help that they awaited from many local Arabs ready to serve as willing accomplices of the Germans in the Middle East.[200]\n\nMufti influence & Mohamed El-Maadi (El Madi) in Algeria\n\nMohammed El Maadi, the head of the fascist leaning La Cagoule for French Algeria, began the anti-Semitic newspaper Er Rachid.[201]\n\nOne of the main instigators of the Aug 1934 Constantine Pogrom -- scene of utter desolation and horror, of Jewish girls with their breasts cut off, of little children with numerous knife wounds and of whole families locked in their homes and burned to death,[202] men, women and children, butchered and tortured to death, in horrible fashion,[203] -- per author J. Cole was: Mohamed El Maadi (1902-1954), who became an enthusiastic supporter of fascistic France’s Vichy regime in World War II, and finished his career in the Nazi SS.[204] Though one should add the wider context of pan-Islamic and pan-Arab nationalism.[205]\n\nEl-Maadi organised the North-African Brigade, nicknamed SS-Mohammed.[206]\n\nFrom Jews in Arab Countries: The Great Uprooting:[207]\n\nDespite some discordant notes, the first German detachments sent to Tunisia following the Allied landings were greeted with enthusiasm, and the convoys of British prisoners were jeered.\n\nA press favorable to Germany deliberately created a stream of false news reports in order to throw fuel on the fire. The press depicted the “slavery” of the Muslim population, and the iniquity of “the Jews.” Er-Rachid reproduces a call by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in favor of Lebanese independence: “Why has North Africa not been liberated from the cruel oppression of the British, Americans, Gaullists and the Jews?”\n\nIn July 1944, a month after the D-Day invasion, the brigade was dissolved, and El Maadi fled east to Berlin, where he became a part of the .. circle around .. Hajj Amin al-Husayni, the former mufti of Jerusalem... By that time, the French state that Mohamed El Maadi served had deported 75,721 Jews to concentration camps...[208] [209]\n\nThe 7,000-8,000 moderates, the Mufti had eliminated[]\n\nExplained:[210]\n\nHe was fascist in nature and feudal in his social composition. He never cared about the broad strata of the people not being represented in the leadership and became the franchise of the rich and aggressive.\n\nArab nationalism in Palestine was for the Arabs what Hitler was for the German people. While Nazism destroyed the socialists, liberals, communists, democrats, who had an independent opinion within his Reich, Haj Amin al-Husseini waged a brutal campaign of extermination against any opposition among his people.\n\nSince he was unable to set up ... where his opponents would be tortured, he simply ordered their elimination. During the three years of the uprising under his leadership, between 7,000 and 8,000 Palestinian Arabs were killed by his mercenaries: party leaders, clerics, police and officers, teachers, journalists, mayors and city councilors, intelligence chiefs, and muhtar of villages. Many were exterminated along with their families. Arab nationalism \"borrowed\" from the dictatorial regimes the most horrific method of taking over the psyche of the people: terrorism.\n\nSafe to conclude the Mufti's victims’ stand, had their lives been spared.\n\nAsides from the moderate clan - the Nashashibi,[176][177] there were even Arabs like Young (29) Acre Dr. Anwar Shukeiri, murdered by Mufti's gang on May 8, 1939,[211] [212][213] with help of his own brother Ahmad Shukeiri, for being, according to the gangs, not only Nashashibi but also a friend of the Jews.[156]\n\nRecalled in 1946:[214] Fortified by money from Hitler and from Mussolini, the Arabs, led by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, started a campaign of violence against the Jews. It is interesting to notice that during this campaign Arab terrorists murdered more of their own people who refused co-operation than they did of the Jews.\n\nGilbert Ashcar – fallacy[]\n\nThe sugar coating of the oldest bigotry - antisemitism, agenda-driven \"author,\" Gilbert Achcar in his writing: hiding, distorting the awful true Goliath Arab nazism.[215] Just another bogus scholar (who lied about B. Gurion too, such as with an out of context \"quote\").[216]\n\nAuthors have put it: The Arab Palestinians supporters of Hamas are 'damned to play the role of the oppressed for whom intellectuals such as Gilbert Achcar tirelessly seek excuses.'\n\nMuslims' antisemitism and holocaust denial: Muslim, as oppose to others, are expected to uphold \"appalling views\", which some have defined as racism. [217]\n\nProfessors conclude:[218] \"This is a book in which an author from the political left seeks to protect the dogmas of Western anti-Zionism from the reality of Arab anti-Semitism.\"\n\nIn his book: He sugar-coates the sheer Jew-hater ex-Mufti with a blanket \"anti immigration to Palestine\" theme, and the calls to the Muslim world during the war to \"kill the Jews,\" \"wherever you find them\" was about \"immigration\" or the Mufti's own account in his memoires reiterating debunked blood libels, for example?\n\nIn page 44 he quotes from O.A. Najjar about Filastin paper. But those quotes are really mainly an anti Zionist argumentative reply. Not a word regarding the overwhelming support and wide enthusiasm for Hitler, in and of itself.\n\nIn fact, historian Haggai Erlich [\"The Middle East Between the Two Wars,\" Volume 2; Volume 5, Open University of Israel, 2002, p.81]: 'Even the newspaper Filastin (\"Palestine\"), which criticized Mussolini, supported Hitler, as did almost all other newspapers.'\n\nThe sheer public display of saluting Hitler in Arab Palestine (including 1934 and 1937) speaks volume. Or Ahmad Shukeiri's testimony in his book of him and his surrounding praying for Hitler's victory 1940. (Before he joined to fight for Hitler as reported in US Congress 1961). Or the poll in 1941 where some 80% of Arab Palestine supported the Nazi victory.[215]\n\nReviewing Achcar's book, as A Remorseless Apology, historian decries, how Achcar bends over backward when explaining the conduct of Hitler's Mufti as well as another present-day Islamist, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.[219]\n\nNoted historian:[220]\n\nAchcar takes aim at the scholars... who have written major works on Nazi policy toward the Middle East in World War II and on the Arab response to those policies. He criticizes these historians of Nazi-Arab collaboration for contributing to a “hegemonic narrative” according to which a majority of Arabs are portrayed by these authors of “anti-Arab propaganda” as having supported Nazism in the 1930s. For anyone who has read the works that he is referring to, The Arabs and the Holocaust is a frustrating book to read. Achcar criticizes texts without fairly presenting their arguments and their evidence. From reading Achcar, the reader would be unaware that in fact none of these scholars engages in generalizations about all Arabs. None of them assumes that opposition to Zionism was, in and of itself, tantamount to sympathy for Nazism, or that it was only the product of anti-Semitism. And much of what they discovered and examined forms the empirical foundation for Achcar’s own study...\n\nThe Arabs and the Holocaust has elements of candor and courage. It is a salutary development that someone with Achcar’s political views acknowledges the realities of the Nazi-Islamist wartime collaboration. It is important to be reminded of the history of a secular Arab leftism and liberalism that opposed fascism, Nazism, as well as Zionism. Achcar undermines these virtues of his book with superficial, unfair, and unreliable readings of those with whom he disagrees, above all those who fought fascism and Nazism on the basis of secular, liberal, and even leftist values yet still support Zionism. His attack on these scholars is neither a contribution to scholarship nor a contribution to moderation.\n\nProfessor in left-wing intellectual magazine criticizes heavily Achcar's treatment of Arab anti-Semitism, his attempts to rationalize, the excuse of ignorance, his ignoring such sweeping factors in Arab Palestine such as the poll of over 80% supporting Germany.[221]\n\nNot surprising, agenda driven Gilbert Achcar, who runs the Center for Palestine “Studies” at SOAS, he bullied out a British academic from their meetings, the academic was also smeared and banned from filming what really is going on at those lectures - brainwashing students, since he was first present at the infamous Abdel Bari Atwan (who declared in June, 2007, \"If Iranian missiles hit Israel, I will dance in Trafalgar Square\"), lectured there in May 2012.[222]\n\n\"Arabs bear no responsibility for Holocaust [sic]\" the attempted-rewriter has been brainwashing students. While of course, the Arabs had a significant enough role in the Holocaust which makes Gilbert Achcar an Arab-role-in-the-Holocaust-denier.[223]\n\nIn a BBC 2 documentary hosted by comedian David Baddiel in Jan. 2021, Gilbert Achcar overtly excused the presence of Holocaust denial among \"Palestinians.\"[224]\n\nConclusion on sweeping pro Nazism in Arab Palestine[]\n\nNoted:\n\nH. Erlich on major newspapers supporting Hitler.[102] (And Falastin since 1932/3[100][101]).\n\nAuthor - (on el-Carmel stating in 1932 its fascists' inspiration and) “All parties were dragged along by the extremists of the Istiqlal, whose newspaper al-Difa'a became a Nazi propaganda pamphlet.”[48]\n\nNuremberg effect in rousing Arabs of Palestine:The great momentum of Nazi propaganda in the Middle East occurred in September 1935. When the \"Nuremberg Laws\" against the Jews were discovered and published, Hitler received greetings from all Arab countries and Islam. The largest number came from Palestine, where Nazi propaganda was strongest.[65]\n\nNYT May 1937, how 'All' of Palestine celebrated Muhamnad's birthday with flying Nazi swastika and pictures of Hitler.[77]\n\nArabs' newspapers, urging the pupils to disobey Government Education Department issued orders prohibiting Arab pupils to participate in the May 1937 demonstrations.[78]\n\n1937, Doehle, German consul in Jerusalem: “Palestinian Arabs in all social strata have great sympathies for the new Germany and its Führer…”[84] Unveiled documents of Nazi official in Palestine writing to Berlin in 1937:[85]\n\n‘Arabs admire our Fuhrer’ - “The Palestinian Arabs show on all levels a great sympathy for the new Germany and its Fuhrer, a sympathy whose value is particularly high as it is based on a purely ideological foundation,” a Nazi official in Palestine wrote in a letter to Berlin in 1937. He added: “Most important for the sympathies which Arabs now feel towards Germany is their admiration for our Fuhrer, especially during the unrests, I often had an opportunity to see how far these sympathies extend. When faced with a dangerous behaviour of an Arab mass, when one said that one was German, this was already generally a free pass.”\n\nAwni Abd al-Hadi (leader of the Arab Independence Party and member of the Arab High Committee in Palestine) Feb 1937 blank statement: ‘Arabs Like Nazis.’[74]\n\nShukeiri's testimony in his book about 1940, on all - sympathizing with the Nazis.[182]\n\nOver 80% in Feb. 1941 poll - favoring the Axis.[183]\n\nCIA Aug-1942 report on majority of the Palestinian Arabs fiercely \"anti-Jewish\" - resulting from Nazi propaganda.[185]\n\nThat the pro-Nazi Mufti represented the consensus of Palestine Arabs and had major backing of parties there. Per (anti-Israel author) Said's concession.[153][154][34][155]\n\nNazis' planned 'extermination of the Jews in Palestine,' (stopped by Desert Rats), relied on help that they awaited from many local Arabs ready to serve as willing accomplices of the Germans in the Middle East.[200]\n\nAn Egyptian, who visited the country in the days after the conquest of Berlin wrote: \"The people cry in the morning and sob in the evening. And blow to their cheek between morning and evening.\"[72]\n\nReaction of most Arabs that heard of the fate of the Jews in Europe, 1942 - 'open joy.'[184]\n\nIf one Communist or two wrote something against Zionism and Fascism at the same time, or that there were Arab soldiers who were paid by Jews (who were the ones mobilized en masse) to join the Brits - do not change the overwhelming facts. Though Falastin & Ad-Difa changed tunes according to power, etc.[47] Yet, enough was the glorification of Hitler in 1932, in 1933 after Hitler assumed power and in 1934 to plant the seeds of venom, nor have they become less anti-Jewish while changing (\"strategic\") tunes. The trend in Arab press such as Ad-Difa still even a week before the end of WW2, because the Arab street applauds that;[225] the alarming of pro-Hitlerism \"fresh\" after the war, such as in Ad-Difa[226] and Alwahda[227] in 1946, proves this too - the hatred - unrelated to the winning side.\n\nNaturally, Arab-Palestinian Leader Farouq Qaddoumi stated: We Supported The Nazis In WWII - as a general description.[228]\n\nAs it was put in 1949:[229]\n\nThere is hardly a single Arab leader today who in those days was not an ally of Nazi Germany. The Nazi-Arab partnership flourished at a time when the war was close to the gates of our country, and names such as Rashid Ali, Amin al-Husseini, etc. still symbolize the \"glorious\" period of this idyll. The ending, as recalled, was not so glorious.\n\nPost Nazi period, recent[]\n\nNazism admiration never ceased.[230]\n\nAfter the war, The Mufti and al-Kailani, reminds researcher:[126]\n\nboth Arab leaders continued their anti-Jewish and Islamist policies unimpeded after the end of the war: al-Kailani until 1965 and al-Husseini until 1974. Outside of Israel, Nazism had hardly been delegitimized in the Middle East, and its adherents often came to power after the war ended. The Iraqi al-Kailani staged a coup in Baghdad but failed. He was sentenced to death, then exiled to Beirut. Al-Husseini also found himself in Beirut, where he was active in the World Islamic Congress, which he founded in Jerusalem in 1931 (he opened a Berlin branch a year later). With robust backing, he rose to become the first \"Global Grand Mufti.\" A mufti is a religious and legal authority who hands down rulings on everyday issues to believers in his jurisdiction. His late half-brother Kamil was the previous grand mufti of Jerusalem. Al-Husseini received the title in 1921, and in order to preserve and expand his transregional \"Mideast-Europe\" legacy after 1945, he chose as his representatives Said Ramadan for Europe, in Switzerland, and Yasser Arafat in the Middle East. The Mufti advised Arafat in 1968 to take over the Palestine Liberation Organization (which he headed until 2004) and \"to liberate Palestine,\" operating out of Gaza with Fatah troops.\n\nJournalist:[231] In the end, despite Hitler's best efforts, a grand Nazi-Islamic alliance wasn't to be... Yet the Nazis did succeed in one thi\n\nng: poisoning the mind of many a Muslim against Jews. Anti-Semitic tropes propagated by the Third Reich, from medieval Christian blood libels to virulent conspiracy theories, have been grafted seamlessly onto old Islamic anti-Jewish prejudices, thereby gaining a new lease on life in the Muslim world.\n\nFrom Massuah, in 1974:[232]:\n\nAntisemitic propaganda in Arab countries sowed hatred not only for the State of Israel but for Jews in general... Arab journalists praised Adolf Hitler 'the \"hero\" [as if] who fell in a \"holy\" war.'\n\nIn the last 25 years, since the establishment of the State of Israel, extensive literature has been published in Egypt and Lebanon that copied the racial theory and called for genocide against the Zionists and Israelis.\n\nThese books have often been published by official and government publishers. Racism has even been instilled in the textbooks of children of Arab countries. It is no coincidence that we were forced to disqualify parts of the textbooks that were accepted in Jordan and the Gaza Strip, under the Jordanian and Egyptian occupation. The \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion\" were published under the auspices of the Egyptian government and at its expense.\n\nSince Nazi times, Cairo has been the only place where these \"protocols\" were published and widely distributed. Nasser himself recommended to visitors to him this book \"which allows one to see inside the tricks [sic] of the Jews.\" Let us remember that important leaders of Arab countries of today were among those expecting a Nazi victory in World War II and some of them are admirers of Hitler, his entourage allies.\n\nThe Allied headquarters in Cairo, during World War II, forcibly prevented a development similar in Egypt to that which occurred with the Rashid Ali revolt in Baghdad.\n\nThe Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, made an alliance with Hitler and hoped for the destruction of the Jewish community in the country. \"Mein Kampf\", the protocols of the \"Elders of Zion\" and similar propaganda pamphlets are not invalid literature today in Arab countries. While there are now Arab leaders, writers and journalists who are ashamed of these publications, no order has yet been given to destroy this horrific propaganda literature. When the Arabs met in the territories with our soldiers and the citizens of Israel, they were surprised to see a humane attitude towards them and did not believe what they saw and said: \"Jews do not hate us and you can live with Israelis\" ... The Arabs thanked us today. We would have been treated differently, and who knows what kind of massacres and atrocities the world would have witnessed in such a case.\"\n\nThe truth is that, internally, the Arab world, and especially the Palestinians, have never hidden their sympathy for Nazism... But for foreign purposes, the Palestinian Arab movement and its supporters in the West present the opposite view.[233]\n\nHolocaust survivor, longtime Congressman, the late Tom Lantos writing in 2002:[234]\n\nWriting in 1986, Middle East scholar Bernard Lewis explained contemporary Arab antisemitism as a reaction to the sense of humiliation Arabs feel at repeated military defeats at Israel's hands, blows made all the more painful because they were inflicted by a people, Jews, long presumed to be inferior.\n\nAccording to Lewis, Arabs were accustomed to viewing Jews as no better than \"a tolerated subject minority, and ... by appearing as conquerors and rulers the Jews [in Arab reckoning] have subverted God's [sic] order for the universe.\"\n\nWhatever its cause, the cancer of antisemitism has metastasized and spread throughout the Arab world. Jews, both as Israelis and simply as Jews, are demonized daily in the Arab press, electronic media, and textbooks, often with ugly illustrations and \"political\" cartoons on a par with the worst of Julius Streicher's Die Sturmer. Indeed, Nazi-style imagery and conspiracy-thinking abound in the Arab world, and all the ills of the world are attributed to \"the Jews.\" As.. article in the New York Times noted, \"Stay in a five-star hotel anywhere from Jordan to Iran, and you can buy the infamous forgery Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Pick up a newspaper in any part of the Arab world and you regularly see a swastika superimposed on the Israeli flag.\"\n\nThis worsening problem carries dire implications for the Arab-Israeli conflict, adding a racist and religious-warfare dimension to an already exceedingly difficult political problem. Moreover, in an obscenely bizarre twist, the Middle East may now be exporting to Europe the antisemitism it originally imported from there. Since the latest phase of Arab violence against Israel began in September 2000, there have been hundreds of antisemitic incidents reported in Europe, particularly in France.\n\nSome of the ugliest examples of Arab antisemitism came in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States, as detailed in this important publication. The Arab media reaction to the September 11 horror reflected all the elements of Nazi-style defamation, particularly, Jewish [sic] conspiracy.\n\nHere we can read the now-famous claims that Mossad organized the September 11 attacks; that 4,000 Jewish employees, forewarned, avoided work at the World Trade Center that day; and that Jews [sic] exploited their foreknowledge of the tragedy to profit from the stock market.\n\nWe observe the shocking sense of cultural inferiority self-serving but nonetheless real of Arab commentators who \"prove\" Jewish [sic] complicity in the September 11 murders by pointing out that \"only the Jews are capable of planning such an incident, because it was planned with great precision of which Osama bin Laden or any other Islamic organization or intelligence apparatus is incapable.\" And we learn of the grisly, Nazi-type punishment one Egyptian cleric wishes on the Jews of America.\n\nBut the totality of what is presented in the following pages also reflects a sad reality: the Arab world's inability, first, to come to terms with the fact that Arabs planned and carried out the evil deeds and, second, to reflect productively on how and why that happened. Such is the classic utility the antisemite finds in his antisemitism: scape-goating Jews for problems of his own making.\n\nA noted Orientalist, conducting a poll in Arabic, in 2019: \"If Adolf Hitler was alive today and was tried, what do you think is the sentence that the leader of the German Third Reich deserves...??\" - most found him \"innocent.\"[235]\n\nNot unrelated. From the other side. An Oct/2021 report:[236]\n\nNeo-Nazis, White Supremacists Attempt To Revive WWII-Era Nazi-Palestinian Alliance: Gaza Conflict Provides Opportunity For Them To Promote And Actualize 'Final Solution,' With Online And On-The-Ground Efforts, Emerging Support For Terror Groups Hamas And Hizbullah And For Their Shared Mission Of Attacking Jews Worldwide.\n\nHitler’s Mein Kampf book was a hit as soon as it was published in 1999 - in 2000 the fifth edition was printed. According to British historian, Hitler's admiration for the Arab world stems first and foremost from the ease with which he succeeded in exterminating Jews.\n\nA study by the German government among Arab youth in the State of Israel revealed that Hitler is at the top of the list of young boys' figures they admire.[237]\n\nThere is an \"intersection between the mufti and his Nazi camp visits and today's hatred of Israel and Jewish symbols.\"[238]\n\nIndeed Nazi symbolism, is never uncommon[239][240][241] at Arab Palestinians. And \"too many Palestinians continue to play the Nazi card over and over again in some creatively destructive ways in the media, mosques and madrassas.\"[242]\n\nThat, in addition to, using Nazi propaganda to indoctrinate hate at children[243][244] and belittling the Holocaust.[245][246][247]\n\nHistorian:[147]\n\nAlthough the Allies destroyed the Third Reich, what has lived on is the Nazi spirit. This spirit of hatred festered through the relationship between Amin Al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and Hitler.\n\nPost WW2 Arab Nazi alliances\n\nOf the first noted 'beginners' Arabs, continuing Mufti's legacy of Arab-Nazi cooperation, post WW2, are:\n\nThe Arab Office in Washington, particularly via Arab “Palestinian” Anwar Nashashibi, already in 1946. At least.[248]\n\nCol. al-Shazly in the years: 1960-1963.[249][250]\n\nMufti's ally, Issa Nakhleh, his Palestine Arab Delegation and beyond, in the years: 1960s - through the early 1980s.\n\nHussein Triki 1960s in Argentina.\n\nNazi Mufti today\n\nThe Grand Mufti is still glorified, such as by \"moderate\" Arab Palestinian Mahmoud Abbas in 2013,[251] and in 2016 at National Security Forces of - PA.[252] And in 2019 a PA official:Nazi-collaborator Mufti is leader and 'role model.'[253] Though, for political purposes, the Palestinian Authority has been -generally- downplaying \"its Nazi orientation.\"[254] Especially to the outside world.[233]\n\nThe PA has named at least one school after the Nazi collaborator - the Amin Al-Husseini Elementary School in El-Bireh, the current PA Mufti has honored his predecessor by laying a wreath on his grave, and the PA National Security Forces have highlighted Al-Husseini on Facebook and in 2019 on the anniversary of his death, Abbas’ advisor praised Nazi collaborator as “role model”.[255]\n\nStill, more often, while the PLO chose trying to deal with Mufti true Nazi record by pushing a vicious blame lie on the Holocaust, Hamas is more expressing the line that the Mufti's war was \"just.\"[116]\n\n(Whereas in the wider Arab world, the Mufti chapter is silenced,[256] some like biographer, at Mohammed El Taher on the Mufti, have been rewriting history and white washing and sugarcoating.[257])\n\nContradictory anti-Semitism\n\nIslamic Anti-Semitism today: denies and or diminishes the Holocaust while contradictory using Nazi symbols which proves that the Holocaust did happen, then at times attaching the label on its enemy - is all motivated by hatred and an all out frustration that the Mufti’s support for extermination became a disappointment in history as Nazism became associated with evil.[258][237]\n\nEichmann-ism\n\nOutrageously rotten to the core, as (late as 2021) the official “moderate” PA flatters a three generation family of terrorists who adopted the name Eichmann, inspired by that arch Nazi butcher.[259]\n\nFawzi Salem al-Mahdi [فوزي سالم المهدي] known as \"Abu Hitler,” [ابو هتلر] a senior commander in Arafat's bodyguard unit, \"Force 17,\" whose two sons bear the first names Hitler and Eichmann.[260][261][262][263]\n\nNazi display\n\nThe outrage at Nazi display is greater when official \"Palestinians\" cheer to it or in almost all cases don't intervene. Far worse is when \"Palestinian\" official police are the ones perpetrating it. Such as on its official media, and \"Palestinian\" police,[264] security.[265] Unlike one isolated rare incident by a loner on the opposite side in 1997, with a drawing that offended Muslims, when she was condemned across the board in Israel and incarcerated for three years.[266][267] At times the Palestinian Authority for example promoted Nazi symbolism events, without directly commenting on it.[268]\n\nAt the same time, Arab-Palestinian moderates' perversion of the Holocaust is alarming at least since the 1980s.[269]\n\nAn Arab-Palestinian writer: \"Hamas uses Hitler-like methods that Will doom the Palestinian People.\"[270]\n\nAt the end of WW2\n\nMarch 1945.\n\nThough the Mufti was arrested, his entourage, his followers Arab feudal lords ... continue to persue their Fascist policy. Interviews given at the ... Pan-Arab congress by prominent \"advisers\" of the Arab rulers, reveal a perturbing picture of the mentality of these Arab overlords. King Ibn Saud's adviser, Sheik Youssef Yussin was quoted in a fascistic statement on that March 1945 congress. Which proved to be but an example of the entire group.[271]\n\nStill:[225]\n\nA week before the end of the war in Europe, the editor of Al-Ittihad [الإتحاد‎] asked an 'important activist' about the meaning of the current trend in some newspapers (his intention was probably for Difa'e [الدفاع], but Falastin [فلسطين‎] had to adapt to its rival in order not to lose circulation) to highlight the speeches of Hitler and Himmler and the Warwolf, to deceive the reader as if Nazism still has hope to win, and to weaken confidence in the unity of the Western allies and SSSR. The important activist replied that this trend satisfies the will of the people and increases the distribution.\n\nShortly after WW2\n\nNov 1945.\n\nNoted in Dec 1, 1945:[272]\n\nthe Palestine Arabic newspaper Falastin, for instance, attacked the Nuremberg trials, asserting that the Allies had no right to try nazis and nazism since this was a political ideology just as democracy and socialism are.\n\n(Dec 25 1945) - Jan 1946.\n\nNew Year of 1946, Arab newspapers in Jaffa published the \"will\" of Hitler with great prominence. The Islamic[20] Ad-Difaa (Al Difa) الدفاع, in honor of the Christian holiday has put at the top of the issue a picture of the \"Fuhrer.\"[226]\n\nApr 1946.\n\nMonths after WW2, the Jaffa based Arab newspaper Al-Sirat (Originally: As-Sirat) - الصراط publishes Nazi-style anti-Jewish incitement, rationalizing European persecution of Jewry.[273]\n\nMay 1946.\n\nThe 'Anti-Nazi League' in US had presented evidence based on 'original documents' of Arab Office in Washington working with Neo Nazis in the US in propagating hatred. In particular correspondence by Arab \"Palestinian\" Anwar Nashashibi [النشاشيبي، أنور 1913-2005].[248]\n\nMay 1946.\n\nArab guards who passed via a van through Bnei Brak, stopped and began to paint swastikas on the walls of the Jewish houses. The police forced them to clean the walls with their bear hands.[274]\n\n1946.\n\nThe Arabic الوحدة al-Wahda - Newspaper in Jerusalem, as quoted in June 1946, glorified Hitler.[227]\n\nJune 1946.\n\nThree Arab women swastikas cause brawl on Jaffa Street in Jerusalem. [275]\n\n1946.\n\nBoth, Jamal Husseini and Ahmad Shukeiri had reiterated Goebbels ideology and had justified the Holocaust of systematically massacring 6,000,000 Jews.[158]\n\nLaying the cornerstone for contradictory nightmare kingdom of propaganda, in which the principle of non-contradiction is suspended in favor of a rather malicious target,[237] (that continues strongly today [276]) months earlier, Shukeiri casted President Truman's stand, as Nazis on trial in Nuremberg. After Truman upon hearing about refugees' plight's, in Nov-1945 sent a letter to Attlee concerning resettlement of Jewish refugees in Palestine [63], Shukeiri as Director of the Jerusalem Arab Office, commented: \"I regard President Truman's repeated declarations in favor of Zionism as a sign of the decline of American democracy. Capitalistic tyranny and angling for the vote of the five million Jews are the direct cause of this... I would have thought that this latest declaration was made by one of the great Nazi leaders who had escaped prosecution at Nuremberg...\"[277]\n\n1946.\n\nGlorification of cooperation with Hitler at Arab villages.\n\nAn Intelligence 1946 report: [166]\n\nArab leaders who had fled the country during the war and cooperated with Hitler, began to return to Palestine with the full consent of the British authorities.\n\nAmong those who returned were Nimr el-Hattab, Amin el-Khouri, Subhi el-Hadra, and Jamal el-Husseini. Only the Mufti himself, Haj Amin el-Husseini, was not granted an entry visa, since even the British realized that that it would be carrying the policy of appeasement to impossible lengths. It was nevertheless made possible for him to \"escape\" from confinement, cross the country under an assumed name, and reach Egypt, where he was taken under the protection of King Farouk. Not many days passed before the Mufti, chief inciter of the anti-Jewish riots and close friend and collaborator of Hitler, began to make his influence felt throughout the country. News reaching the intelligence section said:\n\n\"The Mufti's agents are appearing in Arab villages, making speeches, and inciting to violence.\" — \"Cash from the Mufti's treasury in Egypt is coming in for the purchase of arms for the coming 'Holy War.'\" — \"The Mufti is becoming almost legendary among the Arabs. Wonderful stories are being told of his meetings with Hitler and Mussolini.\" — \"Arabs arriving from neighboring countries tell of widespread volunteering to the Syrian army in preparation for the day when it will invade Palestine and drive out the Jews.\"\n\nResearch:[116]\n\nAfter World War II, Haj Amin was accepted as a hero in Egypt and Palestine. In 1946, Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, called Husseini \"a hero who challenged the empire and Zionism with the help of Hitler and Germany. Germany and Hitler are no more, but Amin al-Husseini will continue the struggle.\" A similar attitude of admiration was shown by the Arab Supreme Council and the Palestinian People's Party, which elected him their leader in 1945. In 1948, Amin al-Husseini was the commander of the Palestinian forces during the War of Independence, whose goal was to occupy and destroy the Jewish community.\n\n1946/7.\n\nIn Arabs' search for ex-Nazi officers to train units to fight the Jews, by the end of 1946, beginning of 1947, Nazi officers were \"liberated\" and have been smuggled into Palestine, where they were employed as instructors by \"Futuwa\" and \"Nejada.\"[278]\n\n1947 Palestine Partition Plan\n\nNov-Dec 1947.\n\nAs the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was declared on 29 November 1947, Arab Higher Committee demanded from the British that they refrain from intervening in the violence which Arab gangs unleashed with 5 hours of the Partition plan. In its leaflet it wrote: \"The Arabs have taken the final solution to the Jewish problem,\" The overt reference to a \"final solution\" - Hitler's code name for the extermination of European Jews - was not accidental, as the Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini, declared a jihad and had: Army of Sacred Jihad and the Rescue Army. Plus, as the supreme religious leader of the Palestinian Arabs, he called for the recruitment of every Arab city and village into its ranks.[279]\n\nPre- and duration of the 1948 war\n\n1947/8.\n\nMuslim Bosnians trained by the Nazis later volunteered to fight against Israel in 1948. Some 890 volunteers from Yugoslavia and Albania were in the Middle East by April 1948, before Israel's declaration of independence on May 15, 1948.[280][229] By the beginning of 1948, Black International - an army of 30,000 veterans of fascist military forces. Some were in action already in attack against Jewish settlements, others are undergoing rapid special training in Syria.\n\nThe army is composed of former Nazi soldiers, remnants of Gen. Vlassov's renegade Soviet battalion, remnants of Gen. Anders Polish army, as well as pro-Nazi Poles, Yugoslavs and Moslems whom the Mufti originally organized into a Moslem brigade to fight alongside the Germans. Furthermore, the bodies of pro-Nazi Poles have already been found among the attackers of our colonies whom we killed. What's more, the Haifa commander of the so-called Arab revolt is a German.\n\nCommenting, source said: \"These Poles, Russians, Germans and Yugoslavs... are the Arabs fighting for national liberation,\" he said bitterly. \"Actually their cynical joy is unbounded at the double gift which has been handed them—the opportunity to butcher Jews, and get paid for it.\"\n\nAnd a meeting of Black International was observed being held in Syria.[281]\n\nApril 1948.\n\nOn April 25, 1948, at Operation Yevusi, at the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood, a building's occupants had hastily abandoned it, and a German flag with a black swastika in the center was found.[282]\n\nApril 1948.\n\nWhen the forces conquered Katamon, in the south of Jerusalem, they found inside a house Nazi flags that the Arabs were provided by their Nazi friends with the Mufti's endeavor. The flags were ready for \"in due course.\" This is how the Arabs imagined the end of the war with the Jews.[283]\n\nOct 1948.\n\nPro-Nazi general Fawzi al-Qawuqji (who was at the pro-Nazi coup d'etat in 1941 Baghdad,[284][285] who had been in charge of broadcasting Nazi propaganda in the Arab world during Second World War II[173][286]), under his leadership/battle, in the Galilee, in a room next to a mosque built on remains of an ancient wall of a Hebrew synagogue, there was a shocking painting: an Arab battle plane with a swastika on its wings bombing a Hebrew Magen David Adom ambulance, and the wounds of the passengers bleeding: in front of the ambulance and behind it two Arab armored vehicles with large swastikas. Lethal fire was fired at the ambulance f"
