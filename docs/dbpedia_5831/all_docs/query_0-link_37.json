        "text": "Son of Frieda and Ben-Zion, was born on May 31, 1921 in Tel Aviv. Menashe-Yirmiyahu joined the Haganah. He later served as a guard in Jerusalem, Hartuv and Ramat Rachel, and at the same time studied for two years in the Faculty of Humanities at the Hebrew University. During the Second World War he joined the British army and with the founding of the Jewish Fighting Brigade. From his many letters to his mother, one can discern his heroism, dedication, and his spirit of sacrifice in the Second World War. When Menashe-Yirmiyahu received a medal of excellence for his help in joining the battle, he was humble. With the outbreak of the War of Independence, he enlisted in the army and was the commander of the Givati ​​Brigade in Tel Nof, and was very cheerful in all the difficult situations. On the 20th of Iyar, May 29, 1948 Menashe-Yirmiyahu perished in a road accident while the battalion was moving at night to the south, to arrest the Egyptians who were camping around Ashdod. Menashe was brought to rest in the military cemetery in Rehovot."
