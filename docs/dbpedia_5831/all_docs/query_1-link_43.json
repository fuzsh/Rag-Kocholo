Following the request from the Israel Government that UNRWA should\n\nresume operations, and having notified the Arab host States of my intentions,\n\nI travelled to Jerusalem on 12 June. On 13 June I visited certain parts of\n\nthe West Bank of the Jordan and on 14 and 15 June Gaza. During this time\n\nbasic arrangements were agreed between the Agency and the Government of Israel\n\nto enable UNRWA to continue its vital humanitarian task. These arrangements\n\nimply no commitment or position by the Agency with regard to the status of the\n\nareas in question or any instrument relating to them and do not affect the\n\nAgency's subjection to resolutions or instructions emanating from the United\n\nNations. In outlining below the present situation, as it affects that task,\n\nand the problems which now appear to face the Agency, I would emphasize that\n\nmy personal knowledge of the present situation is nneecceessssaarriillyy lliimmiitteedd,, ssiinnccee\n\n** Allssoo iissssuueedd uunnddeerr tthhee ssyymbbooll A//66772233..\n\n67-14343 / . . .\n\nPa& 2\n\nthe visit was brief and restricted in scope. I have also had the benefit of\n\nvaluable reports on the local situation frommystaff in the various areas,\n\nbut limitations on the movement of my staff in these areas have meant $hat\n\nit is too early to expect comprehensive and accurate reports from them.\n\n\"A. AREAS IN WHICH MAJOR HOSTILITIES OCCURRED\n\n\"(a) Gaza\n\n\"2. My impression is that casualties among the civilian population had been\n\nhigher here than elsewhere, and damage to property and housing heavier.\n\nHowever, the Agency's camps and i,nstallations were all more or less intact,\n\nand it appeared that all needing medical attention were receiving it and that\n\nmedical supplies were adequate for immediate needs, Public utility services\n\nwere seriously disrupted and public transport unavailable. Movement was\n\nseriously restricted by curfews and by occ asional sniping and mining of roads.\n\nThe civilian population had virtually all remained in Gaza.\n\n!'(b) West \\ Bank of the Jordan\n\n“3. In the old city of Jerusalem the situation was much akin to Gaza. Damage\n\nwas widespread but did not amount to devastation in any areas inspected by me\n\nor my staff. In other parts of the West Bank the situation varied considerably,\n\nbut on the whole the civilian casualties, damage and disruption of normal life\n\nappeared less, except for the exodus from the Jordan Valley mentioned below.\n\n\"(c) Southern Syria\n\n\"4. No Agency staff have been able to enter this area and I have no\n\ninformation other than press and radio reports.\n\n\"(d) Movement of civilian population\n\n“5. This has been negligible in Gaza. In Southern Syria initial reports\n\nindicate that some 50,000 people have moved into the Damascus and Deraa areas\n\nout of which only 8,000 are UN&TA-registkred refugees. Of these 8,000\n\n\\\n\napproximately 6,000 are in the Damascus area and 2,000 near Deraa. Pending a\n\nsurvey now being made, a highly provisional figure of 100,000 having moved\n\nCI I ..*\n\ns/&m\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 3\n\neastwards from the West Bank of the Jordan Valley is being used for working\n\npurposes. of those, possibly 80,000 are already UNHWA-registered refugees,\n\nThe evacuation is by no means uniform. In Jericho UNRWA camps are almost\n\nempty, and perhaps 45,000 have fled. The city of Jericho itself also seemed\n\nto me virtually empty. But in the Nablus and Hebron areas little movement had\n\naccurred and much was normal, From Amman it is reported that some few\n\nthousands of persons have arrived there from Hebron and the area of Tulkarm\n\nand Qualqu- ilya.. In the Nablus area there had also been an influx of the\n\ninhabitants of Tulkerm and Qualquilya, but I was told that they had started\n\nto return. As of 13 June, it was estimated that 10,000 persons from those\n\nareas were still in and around ,Nablus. Many have left Jerusalem, although I\n\nsaw evidence of some returning khere, and there are doubtless many from\n\nJerusalem and areas like Jericho who are in the surrounding countryside and\n\nhave not left the West Bank, My reports indicate that movement across to the\n\nEast Bank had virtually ceased by the middle of last week, and I received\n\nassurance from Ambassador Comay that his Government's policy was not to expel\n\nArab inhabitants of the occupied areas.\n\n\"(e) UNRWA's problems in these areas\n\n“6. I am encouraged by the rapid recovexy of UNRWA's organization and\n\ncapacity to provide services in these areas, except for Southern Syria, into\n\nwhich oux staff have not yet been able to move. Our immediate problemsare\n\ndispersal of locally recruited staff, restrictions on freedom of movement,\n\nheavy loss of vehicles from hostilities, looting and requisitioning, some\n\nloss - although surprisingly light in total - from stocks and stores,\n\ndifficulties of communication both within the fields and with headquarters\n\nin Beirut. My impression was that restrictions on freedom of movement and\n\ncommunications generally were attributable to genuine security difficulties\n\nor damage to facilities and were not being artificially im,posed on the Agency.\n\nThe authorities promised full co-operation in removing these difficulties and\n\nvehicles being donated to the Agency and taken over from UNEF, these\n\nparticular problems should soon be surmounted. Supplies and food for\n\nspoo1\n\nEnglish\n\nPage 4\n\nTJlJF$&-registered refugees are generally good for one month. I have authorized\n\ndistribution of some supplies to other Arab civilians on an emergency basis\n\nand subject to later replacement. Any indefinite increase of UNRWAls\n\nbeneficiaries would require additional financial support and a change in the\n\nAgency's mandate. I have no immediate concern over the ability of our health\n\nservices to cope with casualties and others requiring medical care, given the\n\nexisting co-operation of the authorities. My main concern is that the Agency\n\nshould continue to move supplies of food, etc. into these areas, and I see no\n\nalternative but to use the port of Ashdod, North of Gaza, from which the\n\nAgency could supply both Gaza and the West Bank. I would hope to receive the\n\nco-operation of all Governments in having this supply route, which appears to\n\nbe the best available. It will have to be brought into use immediately if\n\nfood is still to be provided beyond mid-July.\n\n“7. One further matter concerns me, although this is not the Agency's direct\n\nresponsibility, and that is to see refugees given the possibility of\n\ncommunicating with their families. I understand the International Red Cross\n\nis tackling this problem.\n\n‘73. ARRAS IN WHICH NO MAJOR HOSTILITIES OCCURRIE D\n\n\"(a) Jordan\n\n“8. The major problem is to cope with the 100,000 or more newly displaced\n\npersons, of whom perhaps 80,000 are UNRWA-registered. Some have fled from\n\nthe Karamen camp on the East Bank to Amman and are being persuaded to return\n\nto the West Bank, I have made the Agency's position clear, namely that we\n\ncan best cope with the refugees' needs if they return to their previous camps\n\nand installations. Co-operation with the Jordanian Government is good, and\n\nthe Agency has loaned 1,000 tons of flour as well as vehicles and is giving\n\nassistance in setting up emergency camps and conducting joint surveys of the\n\nnumber and locations of displaced persons. The results of this survey are\n\nexpected to be available in two ox three days. Facilities for first\n\nreception, blankets, cooking utensils, and emergency shelter are badly needed.\n\nMedical supplies and services seem to be adequate and the Agency's food stocks\n\nare sufficient for its own registered refugees for three months. Since the\n\nI ..*\n\nrations contain little protein there is a need for additional foods rich in\n\nprotein such as milk and canned meat for those displaced refugees who have\n\nlost their capacity to supplement their rations with food-stuffs purchased\n\nwith their earnings. This need is probably also present among many of the\n\nnon-refugee displaced persons both in East Jordan and Syria and among the\n\npopulation of Gaza, both refugee and local resident.\n\n\"(b) Syria\n\n\"9. Except for the South Western area? the Agencyts normal services are\n\noperating effectively and in addition the Agency has made a blanket\n\ndistribution and established additional. medical services.\n\n\"(c) Lebanon *-=\n\n\"10. The Agency's normal services are operating effectively.\n\n\"(d) UNRWA's problems in these areas\n\n\"11. The Agency has adequate personnel available, Communications are generally\n\ngood, although movement of personnel and vehicles through Syria is restricted,\n\nOur supplies can be maintained, although we may face difficulty in supplying\n\nthe East Bank of the Jordan, If the Suez Canal is closed, most supplies may\n\nnot be able to reach Aqaba. The Agency would then have to rely on transport\n\nthrough Syria. The Agency's overriding difficulty will be shortage of money.\n\nIts additional expenses cannot yet be assessed but they will be considerable.\n\nIt is assuming heavy additional burdens when it is already operating on a\n\nbudgetary deficit. The Agency is working in close liaison with Governments,\n\nthe United Nations Children's Fund, the International Committee of the Red\n\nCross, the League of Red Cross Societies and other non-governmental bodies\n\nand voluntary organizations.\n\n\"12. The Agency's longer-term problems I propose to postpone for subsequent\n\nreport, but these I do not underestimate.\n\n\"13. In general and longer term, p resent circumstances clearly carry a grave\n\nthreat of increased hardship for the population of Gaza and the East Bank of\n\nthe Jordan, In the latter area the loss of the tourist trade, of remittances\n\nfrom abroad and of much of agricultural and home industrial production is\n\nbound to reverse hopeful trend towards economic independence, bringing in itr\n\ntrain unemployment and increased pressure on available resources.\"\n\n7” ,,liff7tli\\\n\nI’ ‘. ’ ‘_I I ,’\n\n,*.-7 I , >t*,,;p .e7’& . , ” ..A,,- ._r_ *-i-*.pg-El,7”“lm,, , . , , , , “ , , ,\n\nI\n\nUNITED NATIONS Disk.\n\nSECURITY GENERAL\n\nS/8OOl/Add..l*\n\nCOUNCIL 4 J-LILY 1-967\n\nORIGINAL: ENGLISH\n\nNOTE BY THE SECRETARY-GENERAL SUBMITTING A SECOND REPORT\n\nOF THE COMMISSIONER-GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS RELIEF\n\n:\n\nAND WORKS AGENCY FOR PALESTINE REFUGEES IN THE NEAR FAST\n\nThe Secretary-General submits to the Members of the General Assembly and of\n\nthe Security Council the following second report on the humanitarian aspects of the\n\nsituation in the Middle East presented to him by the Commissioner-General of the\n\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\n\n(UNRWA):\n\n\"1.

The Agency has virtually resumed its full services, including food\n\ndistribution, supplementary feeding programme, health services and sanitation\n\narrangements in the camps. The number of persons in need, and to whom the\n\nAgency is providing emergency rations, is considerably in excess of those\n\npreviously registered with UNRWA. This is because many people have lost\n\ntheir employment or sources of income (including remittances from abroad)\n\nand have thus ceased to be self-supporting,\n\n\\\n\n“3. There was a good deal of damage to property in the course of the\n\nfighting and afterwards some shelter has been demolished, mainly at Jabaliya\n\nand Rafa‘h, as reprisals for mining incidents. The Agency has already issued\n\ninstructions to begin rebuilding. Medical services for the wounded appear\n\nto be satisfactory, but burial arrangements are not entirely satisfactory\n\nand could pose a health hazard. Looting has not entirely ceased and some\n\nconsiderable losses have occurred to stores of the United Nations Emergency\n\nForce (Ul!?W) at Rafah, which were to be made available to UNRWA, if needed.\n\nThere is also a need for additional civilian police, particularly in the\n\nmiddle camps. All these matters have been taken up with the authorities\n\nand remedial action has been taken or is promised.\n\n\"(b) West Bank of the Jordan\n\n“4. The situation generally appears to have ,improved and electricity and\n\nwater supplies and sanitation services have been restored to the Old City\n\nof Jerusalem. Telephone ccamunications are still disrupted. The Agency's\n\nnormal pattern of services and distribution of foodstuffs and supplies has\n\nbeen fairly well restored, but the large-scale movement of refugees, both\n\nwithin and beyond the West Bank areas, to which I refer below, have\n\ninevitably produced certain dislocations of our operations,\n\n“5. The sitmtion of the hospitals has caused some concern owing to a\n\nshortage of medical supplies and food.\n\n“6. The Agency's shortage of transport, which was critical, has been\n\nconsiderably alleviated by a temporary loan of vehicles from the Government\n\nof Israel and, more recently, by the acquisition of a number of vehicles\n\npreviously used by UNEF.\n\nI . . .\n\n-3-\n\n\"(C) Southern Syria\n\n“7. No Agency staff have been able to enter this area. It is *believed\n\nthat few inhabitants remain there.\n\n\"(cl) Movement of civilian population\n\n“8. In Syria the total movement may be of the order\n\napproximately 16,800 are Palestinians, of whom -11,200\n\narea and 4,600 in the Deraa area.\n\nof 80,000. Of these,\n\nare in the Damascus\n\n“9. The best estimate is that at least 150,000 persons have now left the\n\nWest Bank of the Jordan; of these, 80,000 to 100,000 may be former UERWAregistered\n\nrefugees. It is evident that, whilst movement appeared to have\n\nvirtually ceased about the middle of June, a 'second wave' began about\n\n20 June, and in the last ten days perhaps 30,000 have crossed the Jordan.\n\nIn the Jericho area, with a total of 73,000 before the hostilities began,\n\nonly about 7,500 remain.\n\n\"10. There is also still some movement in the West Bank area. On 22 June,\n\nI received reports 0% some 12,000 inhabitants of Qualquilya having moved\n\nto the Nablus area. By 26 June, I had learnt that the Israel authorities\n\nwere prepared to -permit their return and this return has now taken place,\n\nbut some 40 per cent of their homes were either damaged in the fighting or\n\nsubsequently demolished, apparently because the Qualquilya area was the\n\nsite of gun emplacements from which the outskirts of Tel Aviv and other\n\ntargets in Israel were shelled by Jordanian artillery. The Mayor's estimate\n\nof the cost of reconstruction was $1.4 million. Numbers of people also\n\nmoved from three border villages in the Latrun area into Ramallah. These\n\nvillages are still under military restriction and the inhabitants have not\n\nyet been allowed to return. The extent of damage to their dwellings is\n\nnot known. In three other border villages in the Hebron area the inhabitants\n\nalso moved and have not yet been allowed to return. Many of their dwellings\n\nare said to have been destroyed.\n\n\"(e) The Agency's problems in these areas\n\n“11 l The Agency now has increasing freedom of movement within these areas,\n\nalthough local staff are still subject to some restrictions, The losses of\n\nvehicles are now being made up by re-deployment from other fields and by\n\ntaking over UNEF vehicles. Greater communication between headquarters in\n\nBeirut an&these areas is now possible by courier-cars and may soon be\n\nimproved by the use of a small aircraft to be made available by the\n\ngenerosity of the Canadian Government.\n\nI\n\n-s-\n\n\"12. The Agency's main concern is over food supplies. 'The disruption of\n\nshipping caused by the closure of the Suez Canal has meant that ships have\n\noff-loaded Agency flour shipments in places like Casablanca and Piraeus.\n\nNew arrangements have had to be made for re-shipment, but the consequent\n\ndelay in arrival has caused me great concern. The supply situation on the\n\nWest Bank is critical, and is likely to remain so until mid-July, but the\n\nproblem has been temporarily alleviated by a loan of flour from the Israel\n\nauthorities. Satisfactory arrangements for receiving new supplies through\n\nthe port of Ashdod have now been made with the Government of Israel so that,\n\nfrom mid-July onwards, these present difficulties should be overcome. In\n\nGaza the situation is only slightly better and the Agency hopes to be able\n\nto transfer considerable quantities of supplies, now immobilised in Port\n\nSaid, to Gaza. The Government of the United Arab Republic has already\n\ngiven its agreement to this transfer.\n\n\"13. The inhabitants remaining in these areas could well face a\n\ndeteriorating economic plight in so far as employment and income have been\n\nlost to them. Their plight has been accentuated by the shortage of\n\ncurrency. Thus, the demand upon -the Agency's services may increase. There\n\nwill also be longer-term needs for reconstruction of the housing which has\n\nbeen damaged - for which tents can be no more than a temporary substitute -\n\nand for other Agency premises such as the extensively damaged building at\n\nMount Scopus and also schools and clinics elsewhere.\n\n\"B . AREAS IN WHICH NO MAJOR HOSTILITIES OCCURRED\n\n\"(a) Jordan\n\n\"14. Co-operation with the Government in dealing with the influx of\n\ndisplaced persons has now reached a fairly advanced stage. In liaison with\n\na Ministerial Co-ordination Committee, a plan to set up some eleven tented\n\ncamps has emerged, of which UNRWA will organize and operate six. The\n\ncamps will take from 5,000 to 10,000 persons each, and movement from the\n\ntemporary shelter in schools and other buildings into the new camps has\n\nalready started. The sanitary conditions will be improved with the removal\n\nto the new tented camps, Meanwhile, UNRWA has greatly expanded its\n\nprovision meals while the people are still accommodated in schools and\n\nother public buildings. Once they move into the tented camps, the cooked\n\nmeals will be replaced by the issue of dry rations which the refugees will\n\ncook themselves. However, UNRWA will continue the hot-meal programme in\n\nsupplementary feeding centres for children up to the age of fifteen and\n\nwill also supplement the basic rations to all recipients by an additional\n\nprotein issue (probably canned meat and milk powder),\n\n-5-\n\n\"15. The Agency's main immediate needs are for tents, blankets, cooking\n\nutensils, milk powder and animal protein.\n\nbasic commodities is good.\n\nThe Agency's supply position on\n\n\"(b) Syria\n\n“16. Except for the area under occupation., the Agency?s normal services\n\nare in operation. The Agency has agreed, following discussions with the\n\nSyrian authorities, to exceed the established ration ceiling by 2,400. It\n\nhas distributed 5,000 blankets and established an expanded supplementary\n\nfeeding programme for children up to the age of fifteen. However, for the\n\nmajority of the 'new' refugees, not hitherto registered with UNRWA, the\n\nGovernment is assuming sole responsibility. This contrasts with the\n\nsituation in Jordan where responsibility is more shared.\n\n\"17. For the Agency's own programme, immediate needs are for tents,\n\nblankets, clothing and 'household kits'.\n\n\"(c) Lebanon\n\n\"18. The Agency's normal services are operating effectively,\n\n\"(d) United Arab Republic\n\n“lg. Following a request from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, an Agency\n\nmission visited the United Arab Republic on 29 June. There appear to be\n\nsome 6,000 newly displaced persons who are now in camps in Tahrir province,\n\nof whom perhaps a half are said to have been expelled from Gaza since the\n\nend of hostilities. However, an exact census has yet to be taken. The\n\ncamps are in fact villages which were previously unoccupied, having been\n\nbuilt for new settlers, and the general conditions which the governmental\n\nauthorities have established there are good. The camps are well-organized\n\nand the people are given either food or money with which food can be\n\npurchased nearby. The Agency presently has under study the question\n\nof the methods by which it could best assist the Government of the\n\nUnited Arab Republic in the care of these persons.\n\n/ 0 . ,\n\n-6-\n\n\"(e) The Agency's problems in these areas\n\n\"20. The Agency's immediate problems remain those of securing 'emergency'\n\nsupplies such as tents, blankets, clothing and cooking utensils. The\n\nsupplies of basic commodities such as flour, rice, sugar, cooking oil and\n\nfats axe adequate although fox Jordan the supply position may deteriorate if,\n\nbecause of the closure of the Suez Canal, the Port of Aqaba is less used by\n\nshipping. Of course, the new feeding programmes and protein supplements\n\nwill require much additional food; some offers of food to meet these needs\n\nhave been received, and other supplies will have to be purchased and\n\nimported.\n\n\"21, The calculations of precise quantities of 'emergency' supplies needed\n\nmust necessarily remain provisional. It has not so far been possible to\n\nobtain accurate numbers of persons in need, or even to ascertain precisely\n\nwhat stocks of supplies are available to Governments, but certainly in Jordan\n\nthe establishment of the eleven new tented camps will allow greater accuracy\n\nof assessment.\n\n\"22. The Agency hopes soon to be in a position to give some account of the\n\nestimated cost to the Agency of the emergency operations which it has\n\nundertaken since the beginning of hostilities.\n\n“C. CO-OPERATION BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND OTHER ORG&NIZATIONS,\n\nINTER-GOVER?SMENTAALN D NON-GOVERNMENTAL\n\n\"23. The Agency has already begun co-ordination of its own programmes of\n\nassistance with those planned by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)\n\nand a joint mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\n\nNations and the World Food Programme, and detailed discussions between\n\nrepresentatives of the Agency and of these oxganizations have already taken\n\nplace. In outline, it is expected that these organizations will provide\n\nassistance to persons not pxeviously registered with UNRWA, and some,paxt\n\nof the increased quantities of food for the supplementary feeding programmes\n\nwhich the Agency is maintaining in addition to its normal food programmes.\n\nAssistance by UNICEF will be related to the numbers of mothers and children.\n\n“24. The Agency has also been in consultation with the International Committee\n\nof the Red Cross, the League of Red Cross Societies, National Refugee Councils,\n\nCaxitas, the Oxford Committee fox Famine Relief and many others and has\n\nestablished at its own headquarters in Beirut a centre fox co-ordination.\n\n\"D. PROSPECTS FOR THE RETURN OF REFUGEES UNDER SECURITY COUNCIL\n\nRESOLUTION 237 (1967) OF 14 JUNE 1967\n\n\"25. The Commissioner-General and his Deputy have on two occasions discussed\n\nwith the Government of Israel the question of allowing the displaced persons\n\nto return and have emphasized that the Agency can best serve the needs of\n\nthe xefugees in their established camps in Gaza and on the West Bank of the\n\nJordan. Moxeover, conditions in the purely temporary accommodations on\n\n/ . . .\n\n-7-\n\nthe East Bank were such that a potential health hazard existed, and this\n\ncould be avoided by a speedy return to their former habitations.\n\n“26. Following consultation with the Secretary-General, and having heard\n\nthe announcement of the Government of Israel on 2 July that the return of\n\nrefugees to the West Bank, under conditions to be specified, would be\n\npermitted until 10 August, the Commissioner-General has issued an aTpea\n\nthat further flight should stop and that those who had already fled should\n\nreturn. The Agency has announced its readiness to do all in its power to\n\nassist.\n\n\"27. The return of substantial numbers to the West Bank will necessitate a\n\nre-assessment of the need for emergency tented camps on the East Bank and\n\nof needs generally. The Agency therefore has .to retain the utmost\n\nflexibility in all its planning. It will enter into consultation with\n\nall the parties affected by this announcement so as to facilitate the\n\nreturn in the most humanitarian and orderly way possible.\"\n\nUNITED NATIONS\n\nSECURITY\n\nCOUNCIL\n\nDistr.\n\ns/8124*\n\n18 August 196-l\n\nORIGINAL: E\n\nRlECRTBYTHESRCRETARY-GRIERALIJRDRRGRRRRALAS~LY\n\nRESCLWrIOW 2252 (Es-v) AWD Ez!mmmY CODNCIL RSSOLCTSON\n\n237 (1967)\n\n1. At its 1$&h plenary meeting, on 4 July 1967, the General Assembly adopted\n\nresolution 2252 (ES-V) on humanitarian assistance with a view to alleviating \"the\n\nsuffering inflicted on civilians and on prisoners of war as a result of the recent\n\nhostilities in the Widdle East\". In paragraph 10 of that resolution, the Assembly\n\nrequested the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Commissioner-General of\n\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near\n\nEast (DNRWA), to report urgently to the General Assembly on the needs arising under\n\nparagraphs 5 and 6 of the resolution. In these paragraphs the Assembly endorsed\n\nthe efforts of the Commissioner-General of DNRWAto provide assistance on an\n\nemergency basis and as a temporary measure to persons other than DNRWA refugees who\n\nare at present displaced and in serious need, and welcomed the close co-operation\n\nof DNRWA and other organizations concerned for the purpose of co-ordinating\n\nassistance.\n\n2. In its resolution 237 (1967) CP 14 June 1967 relating to the alleviation of\n\nthe sufferings of civil populations and prisoners of war in the area of conflict,\n\nthe Security Council requested the Secretary-General to follow the effective\n\nimplementation of the resolution and to report to the Security Council. With that\n\nend in view, the Secretary-General sent Mr. Nils-GSran Gussing to the Middle Fast\n\nin early July to obtain on the spot the information required for the effective\n\ndischarge by the Secretary-General of his responsibilities under paragraph 3 of\n\nSecurity Council resolution 237 (1967)Y\n\n* Also issued under the symbol ~/6787.\n\nL/ See S/8021.\n\n67-19186 / . . .\n\n3. The present report is based upon information received from the Commissioner-\n\nGeneral of UNRdA and from interim reports received from Mr. Gussing. The\n\nSecretary-General felt that it might be useful for Members to have at this stage\n\nsome additional information on the humanitarian aspects of the situation in the\n\nMiddle East.\n\nCategories\n\n4. The categories of persons to whom General Assembly resolution Z!52 (ES-V)\n\nrefers are, first, the refugees who lost their homes in the conflict of lglf8 and\n\nwho were registered as eligible for URRUA assistance before the recent hostilities\n\nbegan and, second, the newly displaced persons.\n\n5. The second category includes a large number of the refugees rrho lere\n\ndisplaced from their homes in the 1948 conflict and who have now been uprooted\n\nfor a second time. It also includes a large number of persons who were not\n\npreviously registered with URRWAfo r the reason that they had not lost their\n\nhomes and livelihood in the conflict of 1948. Finally, it includes an\n\nintermediate group of persons who became refugees in 1948, in the sense that\n\nthey lost their homes and all or part of their property, but who were never\n\nregistered with IJRFWA because they were able to fend for themselves.\n\n6. The greater part of the newly displaced persons are those who moved from the\n\nwest bank of the Jordan to east Jordan during and after the recent hostilities,\n\nvirtually all of whom were of Palestinian origin. But more than 100,000 people,\n\nincluding sane 17,000 Palestinian refugees registered with URRWA, moved from the\n\nnow occupied part of Syria into non-occupied areas. Moreover, within the west\n\nbank area some displacement of people occurred, particularly from the border\n\nvillages, although most of these people have remained on the west bank. However,\n\nin all these cases the people were still to be found within the existing area\n\nof the Agency's operations. A different case is that of the people who are now\n\nwithin the territory of the United Arab Republic, which was not previously a\n\nterritory within which the Agency operated relief services. The majority of\n\nthese people have moved from Sinai, but there are also some 3,OGG registered\n\nrefugees from Gasa. URRWA has regarded this group as falling under paragraph 6\n\nof the resolution, and, by arrangement with the Government of the United Arab\n\nRepublic, the Agency has agreed to assist with food supplies for this particular\n\ngroup. I\n\n-3-\n\n7. In practice, UNRWA has not been requirea to cater for the needs of sll.\n\npersons potentially falling Sunder its mandate by virtue of paragraphs 5 and 6\n\nof General Assembly resolution 2252 (ES-V). The Governments concerned, other\n\nUnited Nations agencies and a number of non-governmental organizations have borne\n\na large part of the burden. In any case, the Agency's ability to cope with the\n\nnewly displaced persons was clearly subject to practical limitations and this was\n\nrecognized specifically by the terms of paragraph 6 of the resolution.\n\na. The needs of the persons referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the\n\nresolution are of three different kinds: first, there is the temporary,\n\npresumably short-term, need for emergency relief to enable them to survive in\n\nthe conditions immediately arising from the recent hostilities; second, there is\n\nthe continuing need of the registered refugees for the services which UNRWAh as\n\nprovided for the past seventeen years - a need which may extend also to other\n\ndisplaced persons if the present state of affairs is prolonged; and third, there\n\nis a potential long-term need for an expanded programme of rehabilitation for\n\nthose persons, both registered refugees and newly displaced, whose capacity to\n\nsupport themselves has been adversely affected by the outcome of the recent\n\nhostilities. It will. be appreciated that, at the present time, it is not possible\n\nto define the temporal extent of the first of these three needs. That depends,\n\nto a large degree, on whether the newly displaced persons in Jordan, Syria and\n\nthe United Arab Republic will be able to return to their former places of\n\nresidence and will wish to do so. So far, the arrangements for return, now\n\nunder discussion, relate only to the west bank of the Jordan. Under the auspices\n\nof the Red Cross, agreement was reached on 6 August between Israel and Jordan on\n\nthe repatriation of refugees to the west bank, and the date fixed for the return\n\nof refugees to the Irest bank has been extended to 31August. The most recent\n\ninformation is that some 32,OOG families, totalling an estimated 160,000 persons,\n\nhad submitted applications to return to the west bank as of 16 August and that\n\nfacilities for receiving applicatione were being kept open. It was hoped that\n\nmovement back to the west bank might start on 18 August. UNRWAh as prepared a\n\ntransit camp on the east bank to facilitate this movement. The scope and\n\nduration of the third, longer-term, need will be materially affected by the\n\nnumlm of persons who return to their former places of residence and the\n\ndecisions which msy be reached regarding the status of areas now occupied\n\nby Israel.\n\n9. This report has been prepared in the context of existing circumstances in\n\norder to indicate what the additional needs may be, if and for as long as\n\nthese circumstances continue. This does not, of course, imply any judgement\n\non the political issues involved.\n\n10. By the beginning of August 1967, two months after the hostilities in the\n\nMiddle East had begun, the mediate minim&l needs of the persons displaced during\n\nand after the hostilities for food, shelter end health services were being met,\n\nbut the arrangements were still precarious end needed strengthening and\n\nregularizing. Co-ordination of efforts to meet these needs was steadily\n\nimproving and wasteful duplication seems to have been avoided.\n\n11. The number of refugees registered with mA who had moved, during or after\n\nthe conflict, was estimated at ll3,OOO of whom the largest number - about\n\n93,000 - had moved from the west bank of the Jordan River to the east bank.\n\nAnother 17,000 had moved from the southwestern corner of Syria to the areas\n\nof Damascus and Deraa, and some 3,OCO former residents of the Gaza Strip were\n\nin the United Arab Republic.\n\n12. Persons not previously registered with UNRWAm oved in even larger numbers -\n\nsome 210,000. The number of persons who had moved from the western to the\n\neastern side of the Jordan was believed to be about 85,000, from the southern\n\npart of Syria to Damascus and Deraa about 90,000, snd from Sinai westward across\n\nthe Suez Canal a further 35,000.\n\n13. Many Governments end orgadzations have sent food, medical supplies, tents,\n\nblankets and other help. Some of this assistance has taken the form of bilateral\n\naid, some'has been channelled through UNRWAa nd the Red Cross and Red Crescent\n\norganizations, and some has been distributed by voluntary agencies. Major\n\nassistance in feeding persons not previously registered with UNRWA has been\n\nauthorixed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FA01\n\nand the World Food Programme, and UNICEF has been helping with food and support\n\nfor health activities. Both these programmes are understood to be of limited\n\nduration, for a period of between three and six months.\n\nI . . .\n\n-5-\n\n14. Special additional. help has tallen various fozms. Food was distributed by\n\nUNDA to its regular beneficiaries, including those who were displaced in Jordan\n\nand Syria. The number of rations i-sued was temporarily increased by lOQ,OOO\n\nin the Gasa Strip, Syria, the west bank and east Jordan. In addition, UNFIWA\n\ndistributed government supplies to non-UNRWA displaced persons in east Jordan,\n\nin anticipation of the supplies to be provided by FA0 and the World Food\n\nProgramme, and the Government of Syria provided food to displaced Syrians.\n\nIn the United Arab Republic, assistance was given by the Government, and help\n\nwas also provided by UNRWA, FA0 and the World Food Progranrme, and UNICEF.\n\n15. Hot meals and milk were provided by UNRWAto some 50,000 additional persons,\n\nand food-stuffs were provided by UIEWA on arz emergency basis to hospitals and\n\ninstitutions. For the displaced, canned meat and CSM (corn-soya mixture) was\n\nadded to the monthly ration.\n\n16. Temporary shelter has been provided to 65,000 persons in eight tented camps\n\nin Jordan, by the combined efforts of UIVFMA, the Government and other\n\norganizations, and tents have been made available for some of the displaced\n\npersons in Syria. In the camps the water supplies were improved and protected,\n\nand latrines were constructed.\n\n17. If the return of the displaced persons in east Jordan and Syria to their\n\nformer dwellings is delayed, a large and costly need will arise to replace with\n\nmore durable shelter many of the tents already erected, since these are small\n\nand light and will. not provide adequate protection during the severe winter\n\nweather in these areas. The total cost might exceed $1 million. .\n\n18. Health services continued to operate throughout the emergency and were\n\nquickly re-established on a normal basis. Medical facilities were made available\n\nto additional groups in need, with the help of UNICEF and other organizations.\n\nInoculation campaigns were instituted. Clothing, blankets and family kits of\n\nbasic household utensils were issued.\n\n19. The additional services being provided by IJNRWAh ave increased its\n\nexpenditures at the rate of several million dollars a year. It should be noted\n\nslso that UNRWAh ad been facing a deficit for 1967 of about $4 million before\n\nthe hostilities, which would have forced a reduction in services unless additional\n\nincome were received. These services are now more necessary than ever, and\n\nmust be maintained.\n\nI . . .\n\n-6-\n\n20. There still remains the large task of repairing and reconstructing damaged\n\nbuildings and of replenishing equipment and supplies that have been lost. The\n\ncost to UNRWA of this repair and replacement is still being studied, but it is\n\nexpected to total nearly $lmillion. This additional burden has been superimposed\n\non a budget which already, for the fourth year in succession, showed a massive\n\ndeficit. Solution of the longer-term problem of putting the regular financing\n\nof the Agency on a sounder footing remains an urgent necessity.\n\nContinuing services\n\n21. The Agency's administrative framework - staff, transport, supplies and\n\ninstallations - emerged from the period of hostilities in better condition than\n\nmight have been expected, and within a short time food and health services were\n\nagain being provided to registered refugees in all areas. These services are now\n\noperating more or less normally. It is still too early to estimate the increase\n\nin these services that will be needed or the additional financial provision that\n\nUNRWA will be required to make. Much of the emergency help provided by\n\nGovernments, international organizations like FA0 and the World Food Programme,\n\nUNICRF and the Red Cross, and other agencies may not extend beyond the first few\n\nmonths, and it is probable that UNRWAw ill be required to face the continuing\n\nneeds; the financial burden could amount to about $10 million annually.\n\n22. In the next few weeks, a major effort will be required to reopen the schools\n\nand training facilities. This will impose a heavy burden both on the Governments\n\nconcerned and on UNRWA.\n\n23. In Lebanon, no special problems are foreseen in this connexion.\n\n24. In Syria, the UNmA schools in the Damascus area are still occupied by\n\ndisplaced persons and must be cleared in time for the next school year. This\n\nwill depend on either the return of the displaced persons to their former homes\n\nin the south of Syria or the provision of other temporary accommodation,\n\npresumably in tented camps. The training centre at Roma is also occupied by\n\nSyrian refugees from the south. The vocational training centre near Damascus\n\nhas already been reopened and all but one of the previous trainees are back\n\nat work there.\n\nI 1..\n\n-7-\n\n25. In east Jordan, the schools previously occupied by displaced persons have\n\nnow been cleared and should be ready for use when the new school year begins.\n\nThree of the Agency's training centres (the Kalandia vocational training centre,\n\nthe merits teacher training centre at Ramallah and the women's combined teacher\n\nand vocational training centre, also at Ramallah) are situated on the west bank.\n\nThey formerly served the whole refugee population in Jordan - indeed, the\n\nRamallah women's centre also admitted a number of trainees from the other three\n\nhost countries - but, in present circumstances, it seems unlikely that they\n\nwill be able to admit trainees from east Jordan. UNRWA accordingly would like to\n\nopen two temporary training centresin east Jordan, one to serve as a men's\n\nteacher training centre and the other as a combined teacher and vocational\n\ntraining centre for women. The existing vocational training centre for boys\n\nat Wadi Seer (near Amman) will also be available to serve the needs of the\n\nregistered refugees in east Jordan.\n\n26. On the west bank, discussions are under way between the Government of Israel\n\nand UNRWAw ith a view to resuming the operation of UNRWAs chools and training\n\ncentres. In Gaza, the vocational training centre has already been reopened and\n\nthe schools will reopen in September. Plans for the expansion of the Gaza\n\nvocational training centre were worked out with the United Arab Republic\n\nauthorities before the recent hostilities and the Agency hopes to be able to\n\ngo ahead with these plans with a view to increasing the capacity of the centre\n\nfrom 368 to 568. The training centres on the west bank and in Gaza emerged\n\nunscathed from the hostilities.\n\n27. Much work will have to be done in repairing and rebuilding school premises\n\nand in replacing furniture and equipment which was destroyed or lost during\n\nand after the hostilities in Gaza and on the west bank. Until this work is\n\ncompleted, there will inevitably be an increase in the double shift system of\n\nclasses in the schools affected. Considerable numbers of locally recruited\n\nAgency teachers have been displaced from both the west bank and Gaza and,\n\nunless they are allowed to return, UIihWA will face a serious shortage of trained\n\nteaching staff,\n\n28. For the newly displaced persons in Jordan and Syria some temporary provision\n\nof schools will be necessary pending their return to their former dwellings,\n\n-0-\n\nIn east Jordan about 230 marquees are available for this puzpse and furniture and\n\nequipment are being prepered. Whether this will suffice depends on how many of\n\nthese persons will be able and willing to return to west Jordan; but, in the\n\nprevailing uncertainty, it seems to URRWAthat this represents a reasonable\n\nprovision for emergency schooling.\n\n29. In Syria arrangements are being made to move into tents the URRWA refugees\n\nnou accommodated in school buildings. Rut the intentionsof the Govertwaent in\n\nregard to the much larger number of Syrian refugees now living in schools are not\n\nyet known.\n\nLonger-term rehabilitation\n\n30. The recent hostilities have had the effect of separating the west bank of the\n\nJordan from the rest of Jordan, the Old City of Jerusalem from the remainder of\n\nthe west bank, the Gaza strip from the United Arab Republic (to which Gaza had been\n\nlinked economically as well as politically for the past nineteen years) and the\n\n&uneitra area in the south of Syria from the rest of that country. The economic\n\neffect of these separations on the population - both refugee and non-refugee -\n\nof the areas in question must be far-reaching, even if not as yet precisely\n\ndefinable. There are at present too many uncertainties and imponderable6 for\n\nanyone to venture an answer to the question of how a continuation of the present\n\nstate of affairs may affect the capacity of the inhabitants of the areas concerned\n\nto support themselves and, hence, may affect their need for help in rehabilitating\n\nthemselves. Rowever, some preliminary comment may be helpful with a view to\n\nindicating the nature and dimensions of the problem in the area, namely east Jordan,\n\nwhere the economic impact of recent events has been most severe.\n\n31. In discussing the effect which the separation of the west bank from east Jordan\n\nmay have on the prospects of rehabilitation for the refugee community in east\n\nJordan, It seems necessary first of all to correct the misconception that prevails\n\nin many quarters outside the Middle East that for the past nineteen years the\n\nPalestine refugees have been \"rotting in idleness\" in the camps established by\n\nURRWA. In truth, one fifth of the refugees from the 1948 conflict re-established\n\nthemselves in the Arab world by their own efforts and have never been a charge on\n\nURRWA. !Phe remainder were, for the most part, poorer people of farming stock and\n\nit was their misfortune that the countries where they found refuge already had a\n\n-9-\n\nsurplus of locally born peasant farmers and already faced grave problems in ensuring\n\na livelihood for their own citizens. Even so, many of these poorer refugees found\n\nhomes for themselves in the towns and villages of the host countries and the\n\nnumber of refugees living in the UNFdlA camps has never exceeded k0 per cent of the\n\ntotal refugee population. Moreover, it is quite misleading to assume that because\n\nthe camps remained and, in fact, grew in size and because the refugees continued to\n\nlive in them, no progress was being made towards the economic rehabilitation of the\n\ncamp inhabitants. This misconception seems to derive from experience in dealing\n\nwith the refugees in Europe, where great empbasis was placed on clearing the camps\n\nas evidence of rehabilitation. Such ideas were not applicable to the problem of\n\nthe Palestine refugees since, unless they were allowed to return to their former\n\nhomes, there was nowhere else for the refugees living in the UNRWA camps to go. In\n\nthe circumstances existing and in the absence of a political solution, the best\n\nthey could hope for in this respect was a gradual improvement of the living\n\nconditions in the camps, and this is in fact what has been taking place - sometimes\n\nto a marked degree, particularly where the camps were located in areas in which\n\ngood opportunities for employment existed. Some of the refugee camps, indeed, had\n\ndeveloped into thriving communities, even though they were still at a fairly low\n\nsocial and economic level and still contained many families living on the edge of\n\nsubsistence.\n\n32. For the first few years after 1948 there was no doubt some truth in the idea\n\nthat the refugees living in the UNRWA camps were stagnating in enforced idleness.\n\nBut for many years past, any generalization of this kind has not corresponded to\n\nthe facts. Although on the political plane the problem of the Palestine refugees\n\nhas, regrettably, remained hopelessly deadlocked, on the social and economic plane\n\nmuch solid and undeniable progress has been made in improving their condition.\n\nThis progress has been primarily due to three factors: first and foremost, the\n\nrapid economic development of the Arab host countries and of the Arab world generally\n\nin recent years; second, the energy, intelligence and adaptability of the refugees\n\nthemselves, who have fortunately shown themselves to be eager for work and very\n\ncapable of profiting by any opportunity given to them; and third, the education and\n\ntraining which the host governments, various voluntary agencies and UNRWA have\n\nbeen able to give the young refugees to enable them to take advantage of any\n\nopportunities of employment that might come their way. A subsidiary but not\n\n-lOunimportant\n\nadjunct to these principal factors in the rehabilitation of the\n\nrefugees has been the economic aid supplied by UNRWAin the form of rations, shelter\n\nand other relief services. The regular provision of this relief assistance over\n\nan extended period, even though on a meagre scale, has certainly helped the refugees\n\nnot merely to survive but to recover their capacity to support themselves.\n\n33. It is true that it has not proved possible for UIE37A to reflect adequately\n\nthe extent of this rehabilitation in its published statistics of the number of\n\nrefugees who have been rendered self-supporting and from whom relief assistance has\n\ntherefore been withdrawn. But, however regrettable this may be - and, in fairness\n\nto UNFMA and the Arab host Governments, the difficulty of measuring degrees of\n\nprogress in economic rehabilitation among a mass of people living not much above\n\nsubsistence level needs to be recognized - it does not alter the reality of the\n\nprogress that had been made.\n\n34. In Jordan, official and authoritative statements have been made in recent\n\nyears indicating not only a very high level of economic growth for the country as\n\na whole but also suggesting that the problem of unemployment and underemployment\n\nwhich has chronically beset the Jordanian economy was within sight of solution.\n\nThese statements implied that within a few years Jordan, in spite of its not having\n\nbeen endowed with abundant natural resources, might look forward to becoming\n\neconomically viable and independent of external aid. This could only mean that,\n\nin common with the other citizens of Jordan, the ~0,000 refugees, representing\n\nover half of the whole population, were rapidly achieving the capacity to Support\n\nthemselves and, hence, that the social and economic aspects of the refugee problem\n\nin Jordan, though not the political, were well on the way, if not to a solution, at\n\nleast to a partial remedy.\n\n35. This hopeful trend towards the social and economic rehabilitation of the\n\nrefugees has, for the time being at least, been not merely arrested but actually\n\nreversed by the economic consequences of the recent hostilities. The capacity of\n\nthe whole population in east Jordan to support themselves can only be adversely and\n\ngravely affected by the state of affairs resulting from the war. Those affected\n\nwill be not only the newly displaced persons from the west bank but also many of\n\nthose persons, both refugee and non-refugee, who were living on the east bank before\n\nthe hostilities began and whose livelihood depended either directly or indirectly\n\non economic activity located on or associated with the west bank. It seems probable\n\n/ . . .\n\n-llthat\n\nthe refugees, both those newly displaced and those formerly residing in east\n\nJordan, will feel most severely the impact of the disruption of the Jordanian\n\neconomy, since their economic base is in general more precarious than that of the\n\npermanent residents of east Jordan.\n\n36. Fiemedialaction, if it becomes necessary, to promote the rehabilitation of\n\nthose affected will have to be on a massive scale and, even so, the task of providing\n\na decent livelihood for a ppulation of some l,25O,OOO in east Jordan, where so\n\nmuch of the land is desert and unproductive, is likely to prove extremely difficult.\n\n!Che main element in a prograavae of remedial action would have to be labourintensive\n\ncapital projects and the development of agricultural and water resources.\n\nAn expansion of education and training in order to put to productive use the\n\nsurplus of human resources which has accumulated in east Jordan would be a second\n\nimportant element.\n\n37. The role which UNRNA in particular might play would lie in expanding and\n\nimproving its education progranrne and training facilities for the refugees in east\n\nJordan. A recent survey (carried out before the hostilities) indicated that,\n\nthroughout the whole area of its operations, GNRWA could put to very beneficial use\n\nabout $lG.5 million of capital and about $7 million of recurrent expenditure in\n\nimproving its educational programme (over and above the $16.5 million which it is\n\ncurrently spending on its existing educational services), with particular emphasis\n\non equipping as many as possible of the young refugees for productive employment.\n\nAbout one third of this expenditure would be required in east Jordan.\n\n38. Go many uncertainties overhang the future of the people living on the west\n\nbank that it is impossible at this stage to express even in general terms how their\n\ncapacity to support themselves, and hence, how their need for help towards that\n\nend may have been affected by recent events. But it is possible that a large\n\nprogramme of economic development may be necessary there also.\n\n59. In Gaza, a problem which was basically 'insoluble in the conditions existing\n\nbefore the recent hostilities may have been rendered even more intractable by\n\nrecent events. But again many uncertainties overhang the future of the people\n\nliving there and render prediction futile at this stage. In this context, it\n\nshould perhaps be mentioned that there are reports of some organized visits in six\n\nfifty-seater buses of refugees from Gaza to the west bank, for which the Israel\n\n/ . . .\n\nauthorities accept applications. !lherearefurtherunconfirmedreportstbatscme\n\nOf the refugees on these visits do not return from the west bank to Gasa, and\n\nthat some in fact even reach the east bank. Even before the recent hostilities\n\nit was Clear that, if there was ever to be a solution of the problem of the refugees\n\nin Gaza, some political decision about their future would be required, and they\n\nwould need generous help in re-establishing themselves.\n\n4. It is by no means clear whether the longer-term tasks of rehabilitation will\n\n' fall directly on the United Nations, especially UNRWA, on the specialized agencies,\n\non the Governments directly concern& or on voluntary agencies. There is,\n\nhowever, an obvious need for a restatement of the essential nature of these\n\nlonger-term measures and for an examination of bow these tasks can be undertaken.\n\nActivities of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General\n\n41. Mr. Nils43ran Gussing, Special Representative of the Secretary-General, has\n\nnow visited all of the countries with which he is concerned and bas taken up a\n\nnumber of problems with the appropriate authorities. In Israel the Special\n\nRepresentative held consultations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the\n\nMinister of Defence, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces and the Deputy Director\n\nof the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. On his first visit to Israel, he visited the\n\nOld City of Jerusalem, Nablus and the prisoner-of-war camp of Athlit. He also\n\nexamined with the Israel Government the problem of the return of the refugees from\n\nthe east bank of the Jordan River to the west bank. Mr. Cussing has made a second\n\nvisit to Israel and visits in detail to the areas under Israel OCCUptiOn.\n\n42. On his visit to Syria, Mr. Gussing's programme included consultations with\n\nthe Prime Minister, the Minister and Secretary-General of the Interior, the\n\nSecreta&-General of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the United Nations\n\nDevelopment Programme, the Israel-Syrian Mixed Armistice Commission, the\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, UNRWAa nd the Syrian Red Crescent. He\n\nalso visited temporary accomodations for refugees in Damascus, whose numbers are\n\nestimated at between 105,000 and 110,000, including 16,000 UNRWAre fugees. In\n\naddition, he has discussed various aspects of the refugee problem with the Syrian\n\nauthorities.\n\n43. In Jordan, the Special Representative held consultations with the Prime Minister,\n\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Inter-ministerial Committee for Refugee\n\n-13-\n\nAffairs, as well as with representatives of the United Nations DeveLopme& Programme,\n\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross, the League of Red Cross Societies,\n\nthe Red Crescent and IJRRWA. He visited refugee camps in different parts of the\n\ncountry, including new camps set up by URRWAa nd an old GWRWAca mp which has been\n\nextended to hold new refugees. Re discussed with the Jordan Government, among\n\nother matters, the question of the return of refugees to the west bank and the\n\nmodalities of that return.\n\n44. Prior to his visit to Egypt from 26 to 29 July 1967, Mr. Gussing met with the\n\nrepresentative of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Cyprus. In\n\nEgypt, he held consultations with the Under-Secretaries of State for E'oreign\n\nAffairs and the representatives of the United Nations Development Programme and the\n\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross. He visited refugee camps and also eight\n\nof the ten Israel prisoners of war held in Egypt.\n\n45. Mr. Gussing*s first round of visits to the countries principally concerned has\n\nprovided an opportunity for the Governments to express their views and list their\n\ncomplaints and for him to receive requests to visit particular localities and areas.\n\nHe has also given consideration, during his consultations with the Governments in\n\nthe area, to the question of the status and well-being of minority groups in the\n\nvarious countries concerned. Mr. Gussing plans to complete a second and\n\ncomprehensive round of visits by the end of August, at which time he expects to be\n\nin a position to prepare his final report to the Secretary-General, with a view to\n\nsubmitting it by mid-September.\n\n/\n\n/\n\n_ N/TED NATIONS\n\nECURITY\n\n,@O UNCIL ;p\n\nDistr.\n\nGENl3RAL\n\ns/8124/Corr.l*\n\n21 August 1967\n\nORIGINAL: ENGLISH\n\nREPORT OF TKE SECRETARY-GENERAL UNDER GENERAL ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION\n\n2252 (ES-V) AND SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 237 (1967)\n\nCorrigendum\n\nParagraph 34, ninth line\n\nFor \"whole population\" read \"whole refugee population\".\n\n* Also issued under the symbol A/6787/Corr.l.\n\n67-19285\n\n/UNITED NATIONS .\n\n:SECURITY\n\n1 COUNCIL\n\nDisk.

In its resolution 2254 (ES-V) adopted on 14 July 1967 relating to Jerusalem,\n\nthe General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to report to the Security\n\nCouncil and the General Assembly on the situation and on the implementation of the\n\nresolution. In a note dated 14 August 1967, which was circulated to the Secur..ty\n\nCouncil (S/8121 and Corr.1) and to the General Assembly (A/6785 and Corr.l), the\n\nSecretary-General announced that he had appointed Ambassador Ernest0 A. Thalmann\n\nof Switzerland as his Personal Representative in Jerusalem for the purpose of\n\nobtaining information on the situaticn as a basis for his report to the Security\n\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\n\n2. The terms of reference for the mission which was entrusted to Ambassador\n\nThalmann were laid down in the Secretary-General's letter of 12 August 1967,\n\nas follows:\n\n\"I am glad to know that you are willing to undertake, and that your\n\nGovernment is prepared to make you available for, the special ad hoc\n\nassignment as my Personal Representative in Jerusalem for the purpose of\n\nobtaining information in order to facilitate my report to the Security\n\nCouncil and the General Assembly. The General Assembly, in paragraph 3 of\n\nits resolution 2254 (ES-V) of 14 July 1967 'requests the Secretary-General\n\nto report to the Security Council and the General Assembly on the situation\n\nand on the implementation of the present resolution' . . . That part of my\n\nreport relating to the implementation of the resolution will consist of the\n\nwritten reply to my note about the resolution dated 15 July 1967...\n\nwhich the Government of Israel has promised to address to me. Your\n\nconcern, therefore, will be exclusively with the gathering of information\n\n'on the situation' in Jerusalem which I may, in turn, use in my report to\n\nthe Council and the General Assembly.\n\n\"I would wish you to gather as much information as you reasonably\n\ncan within a period of two weeks on the situation in Jerusalem, by which\n\nis meant specifically conditions relating to the assumption of control by\n\nIsrael authorities over the entire city of Jerusalem, Thus, a major part\n\nof your attention would be directed to the situation in the Old City of\n\nJerusalem, with specific reference to the status and treatment of Arab\n\nresidents and their property and the situation of all of the Holy Places\n\nin Jerusalem.\n\n\"Your function, thus, is to obtain information only and involves no\n\nresponsibility on your part for any negotiations or for the implementation\n\nof the General Assembly resolution.\n\n\"At my request, the Government of Israel has Given assurance that it will\n\nco-operate with your mission and will give you all necessary facilities and\n\ninformation.\"\n\n-2-\n\n3* Ambassador Thalmannls mission constitutes the sole independent source of\n\ninformation of the Secretary-General for the report on the situation in Jerusalem\n\nrequested of him by the General Assembly and, therefore, part one of this report\n\nis based upon the information gathered by Ambassador Thalmann during his visit to\n\nJerusalem.\n\n4. Part two of the report, dealing with the implementation of General Assembly\n\nresolution 2254 (ES-V), is based on the information supplied by the Government of\n\nIsrael.\n\nPART ONE. THE SITUATION IN JERUSALEM\n\nI. MISSION OF TRE PERSONAL REPRESEI'!TATIVE\n\nA. Delimitation of the inquiry\n\n5* In accordance with the terms of reference, the Personal Representative\n\nrestricted his inquiry to Jerusalem. For the purposes of the investigations,\n\nJerusalem was understood to include both those parts of the city which were under\n\nJordanian control before June 1~67 and those under Israel control. It was also\n\nunderstood to include the former no man's land and the rural areas which Israel\n\nhas included in the municipality of Jerusalem. For exclusively practicai reasons,\n\nparticularly brevity, and with no other connotations, the expressions \"East\n\nJerusalem\" and \"West Jerusalem\" are used to designate the parts formerly under\n\nJordanian and Israel control, respectively.\n\n6. It would no doubt have been desirable to set current conditions in\n\nJerusalem against their historical background. This was not possible, however, in\n\nthe short time available.\n\n7. During the Personal Representative's visit to Jerusalem, Arab personalities\n\nhanded him a number of memoranda, petitions and statements, some of which went\n\nbeyond the purely factual conditions and consequently beyond his terms of\n\nreference. It is nevertheless considered appropriate to reproduce some of these\n\ndocuments as annexes because, taken as a whole, they reflect an attitude which\n\nforms a part of the facts that are the subject of the investigations (see annex I).\n\n/ . . .\n\n-3-\n\na. The Israel authorities supplied a substantial amount of documentation, which\n\ncould not be fully evaluated in this report. Some documents, which are helpful\n\nfor an understanding of the factual conditions, are also annexed to the\n\nreport (see annex II).\n\n9. It should be noted that conditions in Jerusalem are in a state of rapid flux.\n\nCertain of the observations in this report may therefore have been partially\n\novertaken by events.\n\nB. Conditions under which the mission was carriea out\n\n10. The Personal Representative arrived at Tel Aviv on 21 August 1967 and\n\nproceeded the same day to Jerusalem. He was able to carry out his investigations\n\nin an orderly atmosphere and the Israel authorities offered him various material\n\nfacilities such as transportation and technical arrangements.\n\n11. The Personal Representative was free to move about and to meet the various\n\npersonalities whom he wished to see and to talk with them privately when he\n\ndesired to do so. He met a great number of Israel officials, Arab personalities\n\nand representatives of the various religious communities. The most important\n\nnames are contained in the lists in annex III.\n\n12. Ambassador Thalmannleft Jerusalem on 3 September and arrived in New York on\n\nthe evening of 4 September.\n\nII. GEOGPAPRYA ND EXTERNAL ASPECT OF THE CITY\n\nA. Geofzranhv\n\n13. As a result of the assumption of control by the Israel authorities over\n\nEast Jerusalem, the municipal area of West Jerusalem was expanded by over 60 square\n\nkilometres to a total exceeding 100 square kilometres, 12 map prepared at\n\nthe Personal Representative's request by the Israel municipal authorities and\n\nannexed to this report shows the claim.-il boundaries of the extended municipality\n\nand other lines relevant to an understanding of the present situation.\n\n/ . . .\n\n-4-\n\nB. Population\n\n14. Since the occupation, a census was carried out in East Jerusalem by the\n\nIsrael authorities. This shows that the approximate population of the area\n\nis '70,000, o_' whom 28,000 (or 40 per cent) reside'in the Old City and &,OCO\n\n(or 60 per cent) outside the walls.\n\n15. The clistribution of population according to religious denomination is as\n\nfollows:\n\nMuslims . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 81.0 per cent\n\nCatholics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8.1 per cent\n\nOrthodox . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6.5 per cent\n\nArmenians . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.4 per cent\n\nOthers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.1 per cent\n\n16. The population of West Jerusalem is approximately 200,000, practically all\n\nof whom are Jews.\n\n17. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, about 7,000\n\nrefugees left the Jerusalem area. So far only a few persons have returned.\n\n18. According to the figures of the Jordanian Census of 1 and 3 July of this\n\nyear, 7,791 persons (including 1,201 householders) left the Jerusalem area. Arab\n\nsources consider that these figures are too low and that they represent only about\n\n70 per cent of the real total of the refugees.\n\nC. External aspect of Jerusalem\n\n19. Curing his visit, the Person&L Representative wac struck by the great\n\nactivity in the streets of the city.\n\n20. The uniforms were few and the weapons fewer. The military policemen went\n\nabout their duties in a matter-of-fact way. They appeared to be mostly concerned\n\nwith directing the traffic, which was quite heavy. The picture of the crowd in the\n\nOld City was dominated by the tourists. Arabs and Jews were mingling. To the\n\ndestruction of the war new destruction had been added. Bulldozers had cleared the\n\nwalls which separated the fSring lines, as well as many houses in the area of the\n\nformer no man's land. Also in the wallea city one could see the debris of\n\nlevelled houses.\n\n/ . . .\n\n-5-\n\n21. There was direct access to the Old City through many newly made roads and\n\nthrough the reopened gates. Outside the walled city the scars of battle were\n\nmore noticeable. Also a number of shops were closed. Most of the hotels had\n\nreopened Before dawn and durin& the day the muezzin could be heard as well\n\nas the church bells.\n\nIII. STPiUC'IUREO F THE:N NICIPAL AUTHORITSJB\n\nA. Situation in the Jordanian sector of\n\nJerusalem before June 1967\n\n22. Svery citizen who had reached the age of eighteen and who paid municipal\n\ntaxes of at least one Jordanian dinar a year was eligible to vote in the municipal\n\nelections.\n\n23. Twelve representatives were elected to the Municipal Council on a non-party\n\nbasis. Candidates had to be Jordanian citizens over the age of twenty-five,\n\nliterate and have committed no crime. The Government, through the Minister of\n\nthe Interior, appointed the Mayor from among the twelve Council members. The\n\nCouncil chose the Assistant Mayor from among its members by a simple majority\n\nvote; the Assistant Mayor deputised for the Mayor in his absence. The Council\n\nappointed from among its members the members of auxiliary committees, which were\n\nusually headed by the Mayor. The Council served as an advisory body to the kayor\n\nand usually convened once a week, though a meeting could be called at the request\n\nof two-thirds of its members.\n\n24. Elections for Mayor anl Council members were held every four years. The\n\nMayor received his salary fram the Municipal Council. Members received no\n\nremuneration.\n\n25. The current term of off:ce was to have ended on 31 August 1867.\n\nB. Situation since June 1967\n\n26. The Israel authorities stated that they had offered the members of the\n\nMunicipal Council of the Old City the opportunity to apply for new positions in\n\nthe framework of the Israel administration, which they refused to do. Several\n\nmembers had left Jerusalem; at present there were only eight in the city.\n\n27. The Municipal Council of the Old City had been superseded by the Municipal\n\nCouncil of West Jerusalem, which is composed of twenty-one members, all Israelis,\n\nwho were elected on 2 November 1965.\n\nC. The administration of the municiaality\n\n28. The Israel authorities further stated that the municipality of West\n\nJerusalem began operations in East Jerusalem the day after the fighting ceased.\n\nIn the begi,rning it acted as the agent of the Military Government, but from\n\n29 June municipal processes started to function according to Israel law.\n\n29. The Arab personnel of the Old City was absorbed in the equivalent\n\ndepartments in the Israel municipality, so that at present, for example, all\n\nthe engineers and staff of the municipality of East Jerusalem were employed\n\nin the City Engineer's Department, the Water Supply Department, etc.\n\n30. Practically all municipal employees included in a list comprising some\n\n370 names provided by the Assistant Mayor of East Jerusalem, immediately after\n\nthe take-over by the Israel authorities, were now employed by the municipality.\n\n31. The question of the pension rights of pensioners in East Jerusalem had not\n\nbeen fully settled. In the meantime the pensioners had received an ex aratia\n\npayment on account of the pension for the month of June, pending a decision\n\non the matter.\n\n32. The Israel Authorities stated that they were not interfering with the\n\nfunctioning of the Muslimwaaf which is responsible for all resources designated\n\nfor the upkeep of religious and welfare institutions. Moreover it had offered to\n\nassist the Waqf authorities to exercise direct control over the property. In\n\naddition, immediately after the hcstilities, it had granted the Waqf a loan of\n\n25,000 Israel pounds.\n\n/ . . .\n\n-7-\n\nIV. ~~EXWRES TAKEN BY THE ISRAEL GO VFRNMFNT IN ORDER TO INTEGRATE\n\nTHE PARTS OF THE CITY WHICH HERE NOT UNDER ISRAEL CONTROL\n\nBEFORE JDNE 1967\n\nA. Preliminary remarks\n\n33. In the numerous conversations which the Personal Representative had with\n\nIsrael leaders, including the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs,\n\nit was made clear beyond any doubt that Israel was taking every step to place\n\nunder its sovereignty those parts of the city which were not controlled by Israel\n\nbefore June 1567. The statutory bases for this had already been created, and the\n\nadministrative authorities had started to apply Israel laws and regulations in those\n\nparts of the city. However, for practical reasons - for example, because the texts\n\nof the laws had not been translated into Arabic - but also with the intention that\n\nthe Arab population should become familiar with the new situation step by step,\n\nnot all Israel laws and regulations were as yet been enforced; nevertheless, it\n\nwas the declared objective of the Israel Government to equalize the legal and\n\nadministrative status of the residents of those parts of the city which were not\n\npreviously controlled by Israel with that of the Israel citizens as soon as\n\npossible.\n\n34. The Personal Representative was repeatedly assured by the Israel side that\n\nevery attention was being paid to the well-being of the Arab population and that\n\nthe Arab residents vould have the opportunity to bring their standard of living\n\nup to the level prevailing in Israel.\n\n35. The Israel authorities stated unequivocally that the process o.C illtebr&iOn\n\n, was irreversible and not negotiable.\n\n36. Some information concerning the manner in which Israel is proceeding at the\n\ngovernmental and municipal level is given in two statements, which arc to be\n\nfound in annex II.\n\n37. It is considered appropriate to discuss below in greater detail the measures\n\ntaken by Israel in the various fields, placing particular stress on those\n\nquestions which are especially vital to the life of the population. It is in the\n\nnature of the following account that the information is drawn for the most part\n\nfrom Israel sources.\n\n-8-\n\nB. Israel legislation affecting East Jerusalem\n\n38. The Personal Representative was supplied by the Israel authorities with the\n\ntext of certain laws and orders which had been adopted with a view to including\n\nOld Jerusalem and certain surrounding areas previously under the control of Jordan\n\nwithin the State of Israel.\n\n39. Under the Law and Administration Ordinance (Amentient No. 11) Law of\n\n27 June 1967, it was provided that the law, jurisdiction and administration of\n\nthe State should apply in any area of the State of Israel designated b;r the\n\nGovernment by order. Under this provision the Government issued an order dated\n\n28 June 1967 which declared that a territory defined in an annex was an area in\n\nwhich the law, jurisdiction and administration of the State of Israel were in\n\nforce. The area described in detailin the annex included the Old City, Sur Baher,\n\nSheich Jarakh, the Kslandia airport, Mount Scopus and vicinity and Sha'afat.\n\n40. Similarly under the Municipal Corporations Ordinance (Amendment No. 7)\n\nof 27 June lC$7, the Minister of Interior was empowered at his discretion to\n\nenlarge, by proclamation, the area of a particular municipal corporation by the\n\ninclusion of an area designated under the Law and Administration Ordinance as\n\njust amended. By an order dated the following day, the Minister declared that\n\nthe boundaries of the Jerusalem Municipal Corporation would be extended by the\n\ninclusion of the area described in the previous paragraph.\n\n41. It was explained that the Jerusalem Municipality had refrained from enforcing\n\nthe municipal by-laws to the eastern sector immediately after reunification\n\nbecause they had not as yet been translated into Arabic.\n\n42. When the by-laws became available in Arabic the Municipality began to\n\nenforce sanitation and public health laws and the ordinance forbidding peddlars\n\nto operate without a licence. In order to enforce the by-laws throughout the\n\nlarger area, thirty-five new inspectors had been hired.\n\n43. The policy of the Municipality was to introduce the by-laws in stages, out\n\nof consideration of the need to familiarise the populati@n with them in a\n\ngradual manner.\n\nI . . .\n\n-9-\n\nC. Physical measures and civilian services\n\n44. The opening of means of access to the Old City and the destruction of barriers\n\nstarted almost immediately after the end of hostilities. By the en,, of August all\n\nformer access roads had been reopened.\n\n45. Alongside this activity went on the destruction of former Jordanian military\n\npositions and the removal of mines, principally in the old no-man's lrnd, in the\n\nJerusalem area.\n\n46. The Israel authorities stated that buildings in a slum area outside the Temple\n\nWall had been destroyed; the inhabitants had been provided with alternative housing.\n\nFifty to seventy families, however, had been put in houses left by refugees who had\n\nsince returned, so they had to find their own accommodation; they were being given\n\nkey money and their rent would be subsidized for two years through the city welfare\n\nagency. Loans for seven years would also be made to fifty-five families in the\n\nOld City whose houses had been damaged by shelling, so that they might repair them\n\nbefore the winter. Dilapidated and dangerous houses along the Old City walls had\n\nbeen demolished (these houses had mainly been in no-man's land) and it was planned\n\nto build a park round the walls. The land 173s mostly church property and\n\ncompensation would be paid. Houses in no-man's land, where there were many mines,\n\nhad been de-mined and demolished; they had been uninhabited since l$:c. These\n\nhouses were in a dangerous condition and there was a risk of squatters with the\n\nexisfing housing shortage. It had not been possible to do anything about them\n\nbefore, as they were in no-man's land.\n\n47. The Israel authorities .Turther stated that there were no plans fop the\n\nconstruction of buildings in East Jerusalem. There was a ban on all buildings\n\nwithin the Old City walls, except for the r-construction of several streets in the\n\nJewish Quarter. These would be kept in the same style as before as far as their\n\nexteriors were concerned, but would be modernised inside.\n\nWater\n\n48. According to the Israel authorities, the water supply network of\n\nEast Jerusalem t7as connected with the 1Jestcm system one day after the end of\n\nhostilities.\n\n49. In the past, East Jerusalem had received its water from sources at Ein Fara,\n\nEin Pohar and Wadi Kelt, which together were capable of supplying 3,000 cubic\n\n-lOmetres\n\na day, or fifty litres per inhabitant. Because of the Water shortage it\n\n7:a.s necessary to supply water only intermittently. The city was divided into tbiee\n\nareas, each of which received water twice a week.\n\n50. During the wsr, several pumping stations and waterripes were damaged. The\n\ndamage was repaired and the water supply resumed. After it became apparent that the\n\nuater supply rvas insufficirnt, three connexions were made with thr system in\n\nWest Jerusalem. During the first weeks the d:,nani doubled, and the need was three\n\ntimes what it had been before the was (9,000 cubic metres a day); two thirds of\n\nthis amount came from blest and one-third from East Jerusalem.\n\n51. It was explained by the Israel authorities that the cost of water in East\n\nJerusalem had been more thsn twice as high as that in West Jerusalem. llith the\n\nmerger of the systems, the cost was lowered to that prevailing in the uest, which\n\nwould lead to an annual deficit of half a nillion Israel pounds in the budget of\n\nthe Water Department (which must cover 611 expenses through fees). An equalization\n\nfnnd had been established.\n\nSanitation\n\n52. The Israel authorities stated that the Sanitation Department had begun its\n\nworlc immediately after the war. During the first period it was mainly concerned with\n\nremoving the rubble accumulated during the fighting. Once this was compleLd, it\n\nconcentrated its efforts on the improvement of services, which included tne\n\nacquisition of sweeping machines, machines to collect garbage, 5,COO garbage cans\n\nto be distributed to houses and 150 large garbage receptacles, at a total Cost Of\n\nmore than one million Israel pound:,.\n\n53. While checking waste-water, thirty malaria sources were found. They were now\n\nbeing eliminated. Efforts were also being made to stop the use of unpurified sewage\n\nwater for irrigation.\n\n54. Veterinary control had been increased and, within this context, renovation\n\nhad begun et the municipal abattoir, which had been partially destroyed during the\n\nhostilities.\n\n55. The entire Sanitation Department had L,CCI~tr ansferred to the Old City Municipal\n\nBuilding.\n\nI . . .\n\n-ll-\n\nRoads, parks and public prop-\n\n56. According to the Israel authorities, the City Engineering Department had begun\n\nwork on the beautification of public parks, and the improvement of roads and\n\nlighting. The budget for East Jerusalem allots approximately four million Israel\n\npounds for the execution of various works.\n\nWelfare\n\n57. The Personal Representative was informed that on 7 August 1967 a Welfare\n\nBureau was opened to the public in East Jerusalem. At present the Bureau was\n\nprimarily occupied with the distribution of aid to past recipient families, and\n\nwith the investigation of the new cases applying for assistance by means of\n\ninterviews in the office, home visits by social workers and contact with friends and\n\nlocal leaders who knew of their situations.\n\n58. A programme has been prepared to distribute 3,337 food packages contributed\n\nby UNICEF to needy cases in East Jerusalem.\n\n39. UNFMA has an important Field Office and a Ration Distribution Centre in\n\nJerusalem and it takes care of the refugee camp in Kslondia.\n\n60. The Catholic organizations in East Jerusalem are supporting up to 2,000 families\n\na month, at a cost of $3.CO per person on average.\n\nD. Budgetary fifzres for East Jerusalem\n\n61.. According to Israel authorities the municipal budget for East Jerusalem for the\n\nperiod from July 1967 to April 1968 amounts to approximately 8 million Israel\n\npounds for regular and non-recurrent expenditures end to an additional 8 million\n\npounds for development schemes.\n\n62. The break-down of the budget is as follous:\n\nIn .:srael pounds\n\nGeneral administration ............. 310,000\n\nSanitation ................... 1,6og,ooo\n\nFinancial administration ............ 395,mo\n\nFire-fighting ................. 263,000\n\nConstruction plans ............... 440,coo\n\nProperty maintenance .............. 1,416,oco\n\nTourism and economic activity ......... 200,cco\n\nMunicipal Central ............... 418,000\n\nEducation ................... 1,258,000\n\n-12-\n\nIn Israel pounds\n\nYouth and sport activities ............\n\nCultural activities\n\n100,000\n\n...............\n\nPublic health services\n\n100,000\n\n..............\n\nPublic welfare\n\n188,coo\n\n..................\n\nWater\n\n10,000\n\n...................... 1,m,@75\n\n63.

Economic measures\n\n64. The Israeli authorities provided the Personal Representative with a substantial\n\namount of information on the present economic situation in East Jerusslem both in\n\nthe form of an oral briefing by a high official of the Economic Department of the\n\nMinistry of Boreign Affairs and of written material. In general, while admitting\n\nthe existence of serious economic problems of adjustment, they maintained that\n\nin many respects the econow of the area was in a prosperous state due to\n\nthe constant flow of Israel shoppers and sightseers and that the adverse\n\neffects of the cessation of tourism should not be unduly protracted.\n\n65. The Personal Representative was told that many of the economic problems were\n\nthe result not of the reunification of the City but of the dislocation caused by\n\nthe war, which had been fought within the boundaries of Jerusalem. There was the\n\nphysical damage to buildings, equipment and, particularly, vehicles, as well as the\n\nfact that goods had been taken over by the Israel army for its own use. An\n\ninstruction had been issued that all private property should be returned\n\nimmediately, but it was sometimes difficult to locate it. Absentee property was\n\nhandled by the Custodian of Absentee Property.\n\nI . . .\n\n-13-\n\n66. It was explained that previously Amman, not Jeruselem, had been the economic\n\nand financial centre of Jordan. East Jerusalem had had no industry except for\n\ntourism end its related small industries; there were in all about 200 small\n\nrrurkshops. On the other hand, there uere over 1,500 shops and a variety of\n\nservice establishments.\n\n67. It was reported that from the time that access from Israel to East Jerusalem\n\nhad become free, the shopkeepers there had been unusually active, selling at the\n\nrate of 2 million Israel po~~lds a day in the first month and at a steady rate of\n\n1 million Israel pounds a day at present. As a result, stocks had run down\n\nquickly in many instances and were being replenished in part from Israel sources\n\nand in part from supplies in the west bank and in unoccupied Jordan. Service\n\nestablishments were reported to have greatly increased their activities. The\n\nnorkshops, after an initial period of dislocation, were said to have all reverted\n\nto routine and normelity and to be going through a process of adjustment to new\n\nmarketing conditions.\n\n68. In genersl, the Israel authorities stated that unification had meant that the\n\n\"underdeveloped\" economy of the eastern sector had come into contact with the more\n\ndeveloped economy of the western sector. That had caused an economic shock, but\n\nwould not necessarily be detrimental to the population, which could enjoy a higher\n\nstandard of living.\n\n69. The Personal Representative was informed that everything was being done not\n\nto Cut East Jerusalem off from its source of supply on the west bank, in particulrr\n\nin respect of fruit and vegetables and other agricultural supplies. It was true\n\nthat certain measures had been taken to avoid the overflow of agricultural produce\n\nso as not to affect the price and markets for frozen vegetables in Israel; some\n\nproduce, however, had gone from Jerusalem to other markets in Israel.\n\n70. It was stressed that agricultural produce from the west bank was untaxed\n\non entrg into the city. Customs check-points had been set up near Sha'afat\n\nand Bethlehem and other imports were in 1~ subject to Israel customs duty; in\n\npractice, however, no customs duty was being collected on any product.\n\n71. Under a customs order published on 2fi June, wholesalers were liable to\n\nPaY on goods Previously imported the difference between the duties already paid\n\nto Jordan and the higher Israel tariff. Stocks had been inventoried, but the\n\nCustoms Department had not yet sent out any debit notices, which would in any\n\ncase only be served on wholesalers with stocks of a value exceeding l,CCO dollars.\n\n-14-\n\n72, on the other hand, the Israel system of excise duties was being applied not\n\nonly to East Jerusalem but throughout the Israel-controlled areas and was being\n\ncollected at the factory. Duties were accordingly payallle on tobacco, alcoholic\n\nbeverages, spirits, petrol and cement.\n\n73. AS a result Of these measures, retailers had raised the prices of products\n\nin stock. The question of the increased cost of living was being studied by a\n\ncommittee; figures had been asked from the Bureau of Statistics. Al.1 salaried\n\nofficials - municipal employees, etc. - had had their salaries increased, though\n\nthey were not yet receiving the Israel scale, which would bring them a fivefold\n\nincrease in the higher grades, a twenty-fourfold increase in the lower.\n\n74. It was stated that citizens of East Jerusalem would be required to pay income\n\ntax in acccrdance with the legislation of Israel as from 28 June 1967. From the\n\nend of August, deductions for tax payment would be made from the salaries of public\n\nservants, whether of the Government or of the municipality.\n\n75. It was explained that the system of municipal taxation in Israel differed in\n\nmany respects from what was in force in East Jerusalem. It would seem that in\n\ngeneral the municipal taxes in West Jerusalem are more varied, and levied at a\n\nhigher rate where comparable, than those in East Jerusalem, though water charges\n\nwere less than half. On the other hand, it uas maintained that the services\n\npreviously supplied by the municipality of E.- 4 ., Jerusalem could not bear comparison,\n\nin scope and efficiency, with the standard attained by local government in Israel.\n\n76. It was stated that no municipal taxes had been paid in East Jerusalem since\n\nthe unification, except for abattoir fees and market dues, which continued to be\n\ncollected at the previous rates.\n\n77, Finally, the information provided by the Israel authorities shoucd that motor\n\nvehicle licences in Israel were higher than those previously imposed b:r Jordan.\n\n78. It was explained that serious obstacles to economic recovery had been caused\n\nby monetary problems. The eight banks previously cDcrating on the vest bank\n\nof the Jordan, with nine branches in East Jerusalem, had had their headquarters\n\nand kept their reserves in Amman. The cash actually held by the banks was only\n\nenough to cover 6 per cent of the public's deposits, and it had, therefore, been\n\nimpossible to open them. In East Jerusalem, those deposits amounted to 5.7 million\n\ndinars, which meant that the bank closure immobilised more thsn half of the\n\nI . . .\n\n-17-\n\nopening up of East Jerusalem to Jewish tourists to Israel, as well as local tourists\n\nfrom Israel.\n\nTransportation\n\n88. The Personal Representative was informed that there were 300 taxis in the\n\nOld City for a population of 70,000 compared with 150 in Hest Jerusalem for a\n\npopulation of 200,000. Those taxis were mainly operated on long journeys to Beirut,\n\nAmman and Petra, from which they were now cut off. The Israel authorities planned\n\nto license about forty to fifty general taxis and had offered others the status\n\nof tourist taxis (the drivers could not pick up ordinary cab fares, but could act\n\nas guides to tourists), but that had been refused. Consequently, the problem had\n\nnot yet been solved.\n\nes. There were still unsolved problems with bus companies, of which there were\n\nsome thirty in the Old City, each one owning one to six buses. It appears that the\n\nIsrael authorities had difficulties coming to terms with those companics and had\n\nallowed the Egged Bus Company from West Jerusalem to operate in the Old City.\n\nMatters had been further complicated when the East Jerusalem bus companies had gone\n\non strike.\n\nIntegration of East Jemsalem workers into the activities of the HistadrufL\n\n(Israel Federation of Labour)\n\n90. A branch of the Histadrut has been opened in East Jerusalem. A certain number\n\nof Arab workers have already registered, and the Israel authorities expect that the\n\nnumber will increase substantially as more and more East Jerusalem employers\n\napproach the Histadrut to safeguard the rights of their workers.\n\n91. The number of Arab workers is estimated at between 12,000 and 14,COO.\n\n9. The Personal Representative was told that the policy will be to pay Arabs\n\nemployed in Israel enterprises salaries equal to those received by their Israel\n\ncounterparts. As regards Arab enterprises, salaries would be calculated according\n\nto the economic solvency of the enterprise. Salar"
