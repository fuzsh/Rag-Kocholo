        "text": "Ora Hatan (continues to cook every day for more than 200 soldiers guarding the area, the only resident of Moshav Shtula, on the Lebanese border). Ora says:\n\n\"Please say a big thank you for me. It warms the heart to know that even if you (plural) are thousands of miles away, your heart and soul are with your brothers in Israel. And tell them they should make Aliya, Israel needs them and we will be happy to embrace them in peaceful days which will come to this land.\n\nThanks, thanks, and thanks again. May you be blessed.\"\n\nOri Reches was very badly wounded in his face, recovering from yet another surgery to his face, still in the hospital, waiting to get better.\n\nHarel Amar, a Sderot policeman, finally was released from hospital to go home, but comes to Shiba daily for treatment, still awaiting two or three more surgeries.\n\nBen Ninyamin and Gali Segal, each lost their right leg in the Nova festival, were both released from rehab department in the hospital, went back to live at the Kibbutz Ramot Menashe. They are still going back for treatment and receiving psychological therapy. Ben started a commercial real estate business with a friend, and resumed playing soccer with his prosthesis. And: they just got married! You can watch them in the act HERE.\n\nOfek Vaxman, high functioning on the spectrum, paralyzed from the waist down, was released from the hospital, still goes daily for PT treatments, hoping to be able to walk one day. Trying really hard!\n\nMichel Rukavitsin, seriously wounded 10/7/23 while in active duty. Improving very slowly, just started (trying) to take a few steps, now can eat on her own, a slow recovery.\n\nA picture from before 10/7:\n\nThe Epstein Family, still struggling in dealing with the multiple loss of lives in their family and their kibbutz Kfar Aza. Son Neta jumped on a grenade and saved his fiance's life.\n\nThe Golan family, also from Kfar Aza, parents and toddler all suffered burns when their house was set on fire. Still going to SHIBA for therapy, baby is just about all better, flourishing in nursery school, parents returned to work part time.\n\nThey all thank us and appreciate the help!\n\nBest wishes, Sari"
