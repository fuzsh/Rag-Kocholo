A courageous narrative.” —Michael Bell, Toronto Globe and Mail “A crisp, vivid introduction to the historical tragedy of Palestine.” —Max Hastings, Sunday Times (London) “When it comes to interpreting the history they shared in 1947–49, Arabs and Israelis subscribe to two radically different narratives. . . . One of the many achievements of this admirable book is to help readers understand why each narrative commands such authority and why they remain so stubbornly irreconcilable.” —Andrew Bacevich, Boston Globe “Morris offers a study of Israel’s war of independence, effectively debunking many of the myths surrounding it. . . . He meticulously documents the expulsions and atrocities that occurred on both sides. His work demonstrates that passion, not polemic, about this controversial era leads to good history. Recommended.” —Library Journal “Morris’ . . . new book . . . is notable for its insistence that the religious dimension of Arab opposition to Jewish sovereignty, the rejection of Israel as an ‘infidel’ and ‘alien’ presence, was overwhelming from the earliest days of the struggle for statehood—and was underestimated by Israel’s leaders from the earliest days, too.” —David Horovitz, Jerusalem Post “Magisterial. . . . A densely researched, richly textured, nuanced book brimming with discerning analysis and telling details. . . . It will be mandatory reading.” —Sheldon Kirshner, Canadian Jewish News “A compelling ‘aha’ book, 1948 brings order to complex, little-understood subjects . . . with [Morris’] vivid narrative prose and masterly analysis.” —David Holahan, Hartford Courant\n\n1948 A History of the First Arab-Israeli War\n\nBenny Morris\n\nYALE UNIVERSITY PRESS\n\n•\n\nN E W H AV E N A N D L O N D O N\n\nCopyright © 2008 by Benny Morris.

These “Zionists” (Zion, one of Jerusalem’s hills, was, by extension, a biblical name for Jerusalem and, by further extension, a name for the Land of Israel) were driven both by the age-old messianic dream, embedded in Judaism’s daily prayers, of reestablishing a Jewish state in the ancient homeland and by European anti-Semitism, which erupted in a wave of pogroms in the czarist empire. The nineteenth-century surge in national consciousness, aspiration, and development in Italy and Germany, Poland, Russia, and the territories of the multinational AustroHungarian Empire provided an intellectual backdrop, inspiration, and guide to Zionism’s founders. The Jewish people was born in the Land of Israel, which it ruled, on and off, for thirteen centuries, between 1200 BCE and the second century CE. The Romans, who conquered and reconquered the land and suppressed successive Jewish revolts in the ﬁrst and second centuries CE, renamed the land Palaestina (derived from the country’s southern coastal area, named Pleshet, in Hebrew, or Philistia, in Latin, after its second millennium BCE inhabitants, the Philistines) in an effort to separate the Jews, many of whom they exiled, from their land. Among the Gentiles, the name Palestine stuck. By the early nineteenth century, after centuries of Byzantine rule and suc1\n\n2\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\ncessive Persian, Arab, Crusader, Arab, and Ottoman conquests, Palestine was an impoverished backwater. But it had religious cachet for the three monotheistic faiths: it was the divinely “promised land” of the biblical “chosen people,” the Jews; Jesus was born, preached, and died there; and the Muslim prophet Muhammad, according to an early interpretation of a line in the Qurhan, had begun his nighttime journey to heaven from Jerusalem, though the land was conquered for Islam only by his mid-seventh-century successors. Jews and Christians and, later, some Muslims, especially those living in Palestine, designated the country “the Holy Land.” But neither before the twelfth-century defeat of the Crusaders at the hands of the Muslim general Saladin nor after it was Palestine administered or recognized as a distinct and separate province by any of its Muslim rulers. The Ottoman Empire, which controlled the area from the early sixteenth century, divided Palestine into two or three subdistricts (sanjaks) that were ruled from the provincial capital of Damascus. From the 1860s, the southern half of Palestine, from a line just north of Jaffa and Jerusalem southward, was constituted as an independent sanjak (or mutasaraﬂik) and ruled from Istanbul, while the northern parts of the country, the sanjaks of Nablus and Acre, were ruled from the provincial capitals of Damascus and, from the 1880s, Beirut. In 1881, Palestine had about 450,000 Arabs—about 90 percent Muslim, the rest Christian—and twenty-ﬁve thousand Jews. Most of the Jews, almost all of whom were ultra-Orthodox, non-nationalist, and poor, lived in Jerusalem, the country’s main town (population thirty thousand). About 80 percent of the Arabs lived in seven to eight hundred agricultural villages, the rest in about a dozen small towns, including Gaza, Hebron, Nablus, Tiberias, Jaffa, Haifa, and Acre. Many rural inhabitants, especially in the lowlands, were tenant farmers, their lands owned—in a semifeudal relationship—by wealthy urban landowners, or effendis. The ﬁrst wave of Zionist immigrants—the First gAliya (literally, ascent)— brought to Palestine’s shores between 1882 and 1903 some thirty thousand Jewish settlers. Their aim was to establish a gradually expanding core of productive Jewish towns and agricultural settlements that would ultimately result in a Jewish majority and the establishment of an independent, sovereign Jewish state in all of Palestine (deﬁned usually as the ten-thousand-squaremile area lying between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River but occasionally—in line with the Bible and subsequent Jewish conquests in the second century BCE —as also encompassing the north-south mountain ridge just east of the river, the biblical lands of Golan, Gilead, Moab, and Edom). The Zionists planned to purchase land either piecemeal, dunam (a fourth of an acre) after dunam, or outright in bulk from the Ottoman sultan, who\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n3\n\nwas always strapped for cash. But the sultan, who regarded Palestine, like all his territories, as sacred Islamic soil and whose vast empire was under increasing nationalist assault in the Balkans and European imperialist threat elsewhere, declined to part with the land. So the Zionists generally maintained discretion about their objective. In private correspondence, however, the settlers were often forthcoming: “The ultimate goal . . . is, in time, to take over the Land of Israel and to restore to the Jews the political independence they have been deprived of for these two thousand years. . . . The Jews will yet arise and, arms in hand (if need be), declare that they are the masters of their ancient homeland.”1 The nineteenth-century poet Naftali Hertz Imber, who later penned the lyrics for what was to become Israel’s national anthem, “Hatikva” (the hope), wrote: If you long to inherit the land of your birth, Buckle on the sword and take up the bow, And go in the footsteps of your fathers. With weeping and tearful pleadings Zion will not be won. With sword and bow—hark ye! Jerusalem will be rebuilt.2\n\nOf course, the integrity of the Ottoman imperial domain was not the only obstacle to Jewish statehood. There were also the native inhabitants, the Arabs. Often, the Zionists depicted Palestine as a “land without a people” awaiting the arrival of the “people without a land,” in the British philo-Zionist Lord Shaftesbury’s phrase from July 1853.3 But once there, the settlers could not avoid noticing the majority native population. It was from them, as two of the ﬁrst settlers put it, that “we shall . . . take away the country . . . through stratagems[,] without drawing upon us their hostility before we become the strong and populous ones.”4 By “stratagems,” of course, they meant purchase; buying land occasionally required “stratagems” since the Ottoman authorities were generally ill disposed toward Jewish land acquisition. But the purchase of Palestine proceeded at a snail’s pace. And it was not mainly a problem of an effendi reluctance to sell. Most of the world’s Jews were non-Zionists, and most, simply, were poor, especially in the Zionist movement’s Eastern European heartland. And the rich, concentrated in Central and Western Europe, by and large refused to help. So, gathering a ruble here and a ruble there, the initially uncoordinated Zionist associations—Hovevei Zion, or Lovers of Zion— bought the odd tract of land for settlement and then sent out small groups of individuals or families to fulﬁll the dream. The bulk of the settlers, of both the ﬁrst and second waves of immigration (the Second gAliya was from 1904 to 1914), planted roots in the lowlands of\n\n4\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nPalestine—in the Coastal Plain, the upper Jordan Valley (from the southern end of the Sea of Galilee to the northern tip of the Galilee Panhandle), and the Jezreel Valley connecting them. These were the less crowded areas of Palestine, often swamp-infested and vulnerable to bedouin depredation, and owned largely by effendis. (The peasants of the hilly Judean, Samarian, and Galilean heartland tended to own their lands and were rarely willing to sell.) But the gradual Jewish population of these lowlands in fact competed with and trumped the natural expansion into them, ongoing since the early nineteenth century, of spillover Arabs from the relatively thickly inhabited hill country. In hindsight, what was effectively a demographic-geographic contest for the lowlands, between 1881 and 1947, was won by the Zionist movement and gave the Zionists the territorial base for statehood. The new settlers, beset by an unwonted and difﬁcult climate, unfamiliar diseases, and brigandage, viewed the native inhabitants as, at best, unwanted interlopers from Arabia and, at worst, as rivals for mastery of the land and potential enemies. But they had to be appeased at least temporarily, given their numerical superiority and their kinship with the Muslim Ottoman rulers. Like most European colonists in the third world, the settlers saw the locals as devious and untrustworthy and, at the same time, as simple, dirty, and lazy. Most did not bother to learn Arabic, and some mistreated their Arab workers, as the famous Russian Jewish essayist Ahad Hagam reported after a visit in February–May 1891.5 The natives, in turn, regarded the foreign inﬂux as inexplicable and the settlers as strange, foolish, inﬁdel, and vaguely minatory. Initially, the Zionist settlement enterprise was haphazard and disorganized. But in the mid-1890s, at last, an organizer—and prophet—arose. He was an unlikely savior. Theodor Herzl was born in Budapest in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1860 to an assimilated, German-speaking Jewish family. He was a doctor of law but quickly changed professions and became a successful journalist, feuilletonist, and playwright. The coffee shops, theaters, and salons of Vienna were his milieu. Herzl knew no Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian, or Polish and had no contact with the poor masses of Eastern Europe. The pogroms and the anti-Semitic discrimination in the czar’s empire may have niggled at his conscience. But the eruption of the Dreyfus Affair in France in 1894 converted Herzl to Zionism. He was then the Paris correspondent of the Neue Freie Presse, a liberal Viennese daily. Alfred Dreyfus was an (assimilated) Jewish army captain on the French General Staff when he was wrongly convicted of spying for Germany and sent to Devil’s Island. A number of French intellectuals protested and were shouted down as unpatriotic. Rightwing crowds ﬂooded the streets of Paris shouting, “Down with the Jews!” Herzl was shocked—and quickly persuaded that popular anti-Semitism was not restricted to the backward czarist empire but was the patrimony of the\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n5\n\nentire Gentile world, including its reﬁned French core, the heartland of liberalism, socialism, and democracy. Herzl reached a dismal conclusion: There was no hope and no future for the Jews in Europe; it could not and would not assimilate them. And in the large, multiethnic Continental empires, Jews would eventually face the hostility of the various minorities bent on selfdetermination. Ultimately, the Jews of Europe faced destruction. The solution was a separate, independent Jewish state to be established after a mass migration of Jews out of Europe. Herzl dashed off a political manifesto, The Jews’ State (1896), and spent his remaining years organizing the “Zionist” movement. He unsuccessfully canvassed Europe’s potentates, including Sultan Abdulhamid II of Turkey, to grant the Jews a state. But the sultan, unwilling to relinquish any part of his steadily diminishing empire, rebuffed Herzl, a master bluffer, who had promised the Ottomans billions (which he did not have and probably could not have raised). And although some of Europe’s leaders, notably Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, were interested in getting rid of their Jews, none was enthusiastic enough to challenge Ottoman rule in Palestine or to vouchsafe any of their own imperial domains for a Jewish purpose. Herzl was equally unsuccessful with Europe’s Jewish ﬁnancial barons. The Rothschilds and their ilk were wary of the wild-eyed prophet or of seeming to engage in an activity that smelled of dual loyalty. Herzl died (possibly of syphilis) in 1904, a broken man at the head of a poor, unsuccessful movement. But Herzl’s was a success story. He had generated enough noise to place the Jewish problem, and his preferred “Zionist” solution, on the international agenda and to hammer together the rudiments of a world-embracing Zionist organization. In Basel, in 1897, the First Zionist Congress, organized by Herzl, had resolved to establish a “publicly and legally secured home [Heimstätte]” for the Jewish people in Palestine. The delegates had avoided the words state and sovereignty for fear of alarming or antagonizing Gentiles, including the sultan, or Jewish magnates. But that was what the Zionists intended. However, of course, Palestine was part of the Ottoman Empire—which was hostile to Zionism both because it was a Jewish enterprise (Islam had little respect for or empathy with the Jews, who were “sons of apes and pigs,” in the Qurhan’s unfelicitous phrase) and because it promised to reduce still further the sultan’s domain—and it was inhabited. For most of Palestine’s impoverished, illiterate inhabitants at the end of the nineteenth century, “nationalism” was an alien, meaningless concept. They identiﬁed themselves simultaneously as subjects of the (multinational) Ottoman Empire and as part of the (multinational) community of Islam; as Arabs, in terms of geography,\n\n6\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nculture, and language; as inhabitants of this or that region and village of a vaguely deﬁned Palestine; and as members of this or that clan or family. There was no Arab national movement and not even a hint, in 1881, of a separate Palestinian Arab nationalism. But European ideas had begun to penetrate the Levant, via commerce, tourists, missionaries, and books and newspapers. Nationalism began to touch the minds of a thin crust of the better educated and rich in Damascus, Beirut, and Baghdad. And Palestine’s notable families, collectively known as the aGyan, from whom sprang the country’s doctors and lawyers and municipal and religious leaders, were not completely immune. Perhaps the ﬁrst expressions of their dawning Arab national consciousness are to be found in their, at ﬁrst hesitant, later vociferous, appeals to Istanbul, from 1891 on, to halt the Zionist inﬂux. They warned that Zionist immigration and settlement threatened to undermine the country’s “Arab” character and perhaps, ultimately, to displace its inhabitants. “The Jews are taking all the lands out of the hands of the Muslims, taking all the commerce into their hands and bringing arms into the country,” complained a group of Jerusalem notables. They called on the sultan to halt Jewish immigration and to bar Jewish land purchases.6 Indeed, by 1899 the mufti of Jerusalem, Taher al-Husseini (the father of Muhammad Haj Amin al-Husseini, the future leader of the Palestinian national movement), was proposing that all Jews who had settled in the country after 1891 be harassed into leaving or expelled.7 These petitioners sensed that the initial trickle of settlers was but the thin edge of the wedge and would be followed by masses of European Jews who, backed by the Jews’ reputed legendary wealth, would Judaize the country. They were vaguely aware of the anti-Semitism that was propelling the Jews to Palestine (indeed, some of them shared the prejudice). But they saw no reason why they should host Europe’s expellees or pay any price for the plight of Europe’s Jews. And they failed to acknowledge the Jews’ historic ties to the land, denying these Russian-speaking, strangely appareled immigrants any innate rights or just claims. In this sense, Yusuf Dia al-Khalidi, Jerusalem’s mayor, was highly unusual. In a letter to Zadok Kahn, the chief rabbi of France, he wrote that the Zionist idea was, in theory, “natural, ﬁne and just. . . . Who can challenge the rights of the Jews to Palestine? Good lord, historically it is really your country.” But in practice, he was as opposed to Zionism as the rest of the Palestine notables. The land was already inhabited, and Zionist immigration would spark resistance; Palestine could be reclaimed only by the sword. Better that the Jews reestablish themselves elsewhere. “In the name of God, let Palestine be left in peace,” he wrote in March 1899.8 Kahn passed on al-Khalidi’s letter to Herzl, who replied on 19 March. Herzl reassured al-Khalidi that the\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n7\n\nZionists, with their vast wealth, expertise, and initiative, would bring beneﬁt to all of Palestine’s inhabitants, Arab and Jew. The Jews, he averred, were not “warlike,” and there was no reason to fear their inﬂux.9 But al-Khalidi and his fellow notables were not persuaded. Indeed, in 1905 an exiled anti-Semitic Lebanese Arab nationalist, Negib gAzoury, voiced what was probably on the minds of Palestine’s politically conscious notables when he wrote that the Jews were bent on reconstituting their ancient state in the whole territory stretching from Mount Hermon to the Arabian Desert in the south and the Suez Canal in the west. The Jews, he added, were destined to clash, in a ﬁght to the ﬁnish, with the emergent Arab national movement.10 However, Istanbul, while periodically issuing restrictive orders, never effectively clamped down on Jewish immigration, land purchases, and settlement. The Turks no doubt were misled by the apparent negligibility of the ongoing enterprise. But there was, too, Ottoman inefﬁciency and venality; almost everyone in the administration had a price. Bribes were routinely paid for entry permits and their extension, land deals, building rights. Slowly, the Zionists planted roots. Although the overwhelming majority of Jewish emigrants from Eastern Europe made tracks for North America and the British dominions—well over two million of them by 1914—a hard, resolute cadre reached Palestine, bought land, and settled. By 1914, there were some four dozen settlements (including the bare beginnings of Tel Aviv, in the windswept dunes north of Jaffa, and the ﬁrst kibbutz, Degania, in the marshes just south of the Sea of Galilee, both founded in 1909) and sixty thousand to eighty-ﬁve thousand Jews, about two-thirds of them vigorous, idealistic Zionists, in Palestine. The Zionists encountered little Arab violence in the ﬁrst two and a half decades of settlement. The Arabs lacked political, nationalist awareness and were thoroughly disorganized. The Turks ruled the land and, though generally sympathetic toward their coreligionists, often backed the settlers in disputes over land or settlement. Intercession by local Western and Russian consuls with Ottoman administrators and by ambassadors in Istanbul also beneﬁted the settlers. But there were occasional acts of violence. Until 1908–1909, they were mostly of a “criminal” nature or appeared to be routine feuds between neighbors. An Arab with a knife, bent on robbery, would waylay a settler on an isolated footpath, as happened to David Ben-Gurion in August 1909 near Sejera in the Lower Galilee (Ben-Gurion emerged with a wound in the arm and a deep-seated suspicion of “the Arabs”);11 or a group of Arabs would harass a Jewish couple strolling along the beachfront, as happened in Jaffa in March 1908 (the attack triggered a wider Jewish-Arab melee in the town cen-\n\n8\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nter); or settlers and their Arab neighbors would quarrel over farming rights and land usage in newly acquired tracts, as happened in Petah Tikva (Melabbes) in 1886, in Rehovot in 1892 and 1893, and in Gedera (Qatra) in 1887– 1888. Despite an acknowledgment of Arab resentment or antagonism, the settlers and Zionist spokesmen were wont to dismiss such “brawls” as “common” among Arabs, “between one tribe and another, or one village and another.”12 But in 1909–1914 the violence increased and took on a clearer “nationalist” ﬂavor. During those six years, Arabs killed twelve Jewish settlement guards—the preeminent symbols of the Zionist endeavor—and Jewish ofﬁcials increasingly spoke of Arab nationalist ferment and opposition. Already in 1907 Yitzhak Epstein, a Zionist educator, had published an article, “The Hidden Question,” in which he acknowledged the emergence of a national conﬂict between Zionism and the Arabs. “We have forgotten one small matter,” he berated the Zionist leadership. “There is in our beloved land an entire nation, which has occupied it for hundreds of years and has never thought to leave it. . . . We are making a great psychological error with regard to a great, assertive and jealous people . . . we forget that the nation that lives in [Palestine] today has a sensitive heart and a loving soul. The Arab, like every man, is tied to his native land with strong bonds.” Zionism, he warned, would have to face, and solve, the “Arab Question,” and he urged the settlers to get to know the Arabs, their culture, and their language to facilitate dialogue.13 In 1910–1911 Arabs in the north tried to resist the Zionist purchase of and settlement in a large tract of land in the Jezreel Valley. Ironically, the opposition focused on the tenant farmer village of Fula, built on and around the ruins of La Fève, a Crusader fortress Saladin had conquered in 1187. Henceforward, Arab spokesmen were regularly to identify the Zionists as the “new Crusaders.” Arab notables sent off a stream of appeals to Istanbul, shots were traded, and an Arab and a settlement guard were killed. But nothing availed. The authorities upheld the purchase, Fula was evacuated, and within months, a Jewish settlement, Merhavia, took root on the site. Arab anti-Zionist rhetoric ﬂourished. The Zionists were now regularly charged with aiming to “kill, pillage, and violate Muslim women and girls”; explicitly anti-Semitic images were mobilized. The blind Muslim cleric and politician Sheikh Suleiman al-Taji al-Faruqi in November 1913 published a poem in the recently founded Arabic newspaper Falastin, declaring: Jews, sons of clinking gold, stop your deceit; We shall not be cheated into bartering away our country! . . . The Jews, the weakest of all peoples and the least of them,\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n9\n\nAre haggling with us for our land; How can we slumber on?14\n\nThe outbreak of World War I, pitting Britain and its allies, chieﬂy France, Russia, and later the United States, against Germany and the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires, temporarily halted Arab-Zionist violence. But the war was to refashion the Middle East and signiﬁcantly advance both the Zionist cause and Arab nationalist aspirations. From the ﬁrst, Palestine was on the front line. It served as the Ottoman army’s base for two unsuccessful cross-Sinai offensives against British-ruled Egypt, in 1915 and 1916, and was in turn invaded by a British army from Egypt. Throughout, under Ottoman martial law, both Arab and Jewish inhabitants had been subjected to systematic conﬁscations, principally of agricultural produce and farm animals, and repression by the Turkish soldiery, worried by possible pro-Allied “nationalist” subversion behind the lines. In October–December 1917 the invading British army, under General Edmund Allenby, conquered the southern half of the country, including Jerusalem. The following September, after smashing the Turkish lines north of Jaffa, the British took Samaria and Galilee and then pushed on to Damascus and Aleppo, forcing a Turkish surrender and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. The British had been assisted, from summer 1916, in a minor way, by a well-remunerated revolt of Arab tribes in Hijaz, led by the Hashemite family; their camel-borne army drove northward through Transjordan in parallel with Allenby’s northward advance through Palestine. Britain had promised the Hashemites sovereignty over the Arab-populated areas of the expiring Ottoman Empire. But Palestine was ambiguously omitted from the future Arab domain (in the letter of 24 October 1915 from Henry McMahon, Britain’s high commissioner in Egypt, to the Hashemite sharif of Mecca, Hussein ibn gAli). Instead, it was alternatively vouchsafed for future Anglo-French condominium (in the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement of 3 January 1916) and, more vaguely, as a Jewish “national home” (in the Balfour Declaration of 2 November 1917). That one-sentence declaration by the British foreign secretary, Arthur James Balfour—“His Majesty’s Government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish People and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country”—was to be seen by the Zionist movement, which had vigorously lobbied for it, as a historic breakthrough and a basis for its future sovereignty over Palestine. And indeed, the\n\n10\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nBritish, including Balfour, and despite the avoidance of the word state, regarded the embodied promise as necessarily leading to self-determination. “My personal hope is that the Jews will make good in Palestine and eventually found a Jewish State. It is up to them now; we have given them their opportunity,” Balfour was to say three months later.15 The Arabs, who greeted the declaration with “bewilderment and dismay,” came to regard it as a (negative) milestone, an act of betrayal.16 Thereafter, no matter what the British did to the contrary, the Arab world was to regard London as the protector and facilitator of Zionism. The British had been driven by Zionist lobbying, spearheaded by the able, charming Chaim Weizmann, a Russian Jewish chemist who had made Britain his home. But Weizmann had been preaching to the converted to the extent that many in the imperial cabinet, including Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Balfour himself, had long been philo-Zionists, for Protestant religious and humanitarian reasons. To be sure, there had also been imperial concerns: a British-created Jewish state might help guard the eastern approaches to that vital waterway, the Suez Canal, only recently imperiled by the Turks. And empowering the Jews in Palestine might reap rewards among the Jews of the United States and Russia, whose goodwill the British wanted, against the backdrop of World War I, either to acquire or sustain. Without doubt, the British had ignored the will of Palestine’s Arab inhabitants. But imperial powers at the time generally took no note of the wishes of third world peoples. And there were speciﬁc extenuating circumstances— the Arabs of Palestine, like the majority of those outside Palestine, had supported and were still supporting the (Muslim) Ottoman Empire in its war against the (Christian) Allied powers; and there was, at the time, no Palestinian Arab national movement nor any separate Palestinian Arab national consciousness. Indeed, “Arab” national awareness, with concomitant political aspirations, was barely in its infancy among the elites in the neighboring Arab centers of Beirut, Damascus, and Baghdad. Moreover, the primary agents of Arab independence during the war, the Hashemite leaders of the desert revolt, appeared not to be averse to Jewish rule over Palestine. When Weizmann met Faisal, Hussein ibn gAli’s son and the commander of the Hashemite army, in a wadi in southern Transjordan in June 1918, the two men got on famously—and Faisal, interested in Zionist support for Hashemite ambitions, endorsed Zionist colonization of Palestine. When the dust had settled, Faisal was installed by the British as ruler in Syria while his brother, gAbdullah, was given a separate emirate in Transjordan. In March 1920 Faisal declared himself “King of Syria and Palestine.” But in July 1920, partly in response, the French, already masters of Beirut, invaded Syria and conquered Damascus, ejecting Faisal. The British then re-\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n11\n\ninstalled Faisal as king of Iraq, which he and his offspring were to rule for almost forty years. France emerged from the world war with League of Nations mandates over Lebanon and Syria while the British held sway directly over Mandated Palestine and Iraq and indirectly over Egypt and Transjordan. The grand Hashemite vision of one giant, powerful Arab state had dissipated into a handful of smaller, separate semi-independent or mandated Arab territories, at least temporarily under Western imperial boots. But the imperial powers were only partly to blame for this fracturing of the Arab world; so, too, were the Hashemite princelings and the separate local Arab nationalist groupings, in Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut, and Cairo. Each sought power and independence in his own turf; none wished to be ruled from the remote, medieval village of Mecca by the would-be, unifying tribal chieftain, Hussein ibn gAli. The imperial carve-up left British-ruled Palestine cut off from its former provincial capitals, Damascus and Beirut, now under French control, and the Palestinian elite quickly understood that their future would be separate from that of Syria and Lebanon. Thus, 1920 was to prove crucial in the emergence of a separate Palestinian Arab national movement and a decisive moment in the evolving Zionist-Arab conﬂict. The events in Damascus had released Arab nationalist passions that were indirectly and directly to lead to the ﬁrst major Arab-Jewish clashes in Palestine. These broke out in March–April that year. In the Galilee Panhandle, a gray no-man’s-land between the French and British areas of control, a band of Arab marauders—driven by either anti-French or anti-Zionist sentiments —in the ﬁrst week of March assaulted the Jewish settlement of Tel Hai. The assault led to the Zionist evacuation of the area, to which the settlers returned only in October, after Britain and France had agreed that the Panhandle would be part of the Palestine Mandate. But this was a sideshow. More ominous was the outbreak, on 4 April, in the midst of the Muslim Nabi Musa (the Prophet Moses) festivities, of pogrom-like Arab rioting in Jerusalem’s Old City. A Muslim religious procession, the marchers wielding knives and clubs, erupted in anti-Jewish violence; shouts of “Idbah alYahud” (Slaughter the Jews) and “Muhammad’s faith was born with the sword” ﬁlled the air. At the end of three days, six Jews lay dead, with about two hundred injured and a handful raped. The British authorities had reacted lackadaisically and ineptly, drawing from the Jews the accusation that they had behaved like Russian policemen during pogroms. The Zionist leadership, prodded by veterans of Hashomer, the Zionist self-defense/guards association founded a dozen years before, and the Jewish battalions that had fought with the British army in World War I, reacted by establishing an underground “national” or ethnic militia, the Haganah Organization (Irgun\n\n12\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nHahaganah, Hebrew for defense organization), known simply as the Haganah. The 1920 outbreak was only the ﬁrst in a series of bouts of violence—1921, 1929, 1936–1939—that grew progressively more lethal and more extensive. The spread of national consciousness during the 1920s and 1930s clearly paralleled, and probably drew sustenance from, the dramatic increase in literacy among Palestine’s Arabs, one of the fruits of the enlightened British Mandate administration. Increased prosperity, triggering hopes of further betterment, relative political freedom, and the gradual emergence of an urban middle class also tended to radicalize the population. This burgeoning national consciousness periodically expressed itself in anti-Zionist violence. But violence did not emerge only from “modern” nationalist passions; it also drew on powerful religious wellsprings. Nothing, it seemed, could mobilize the Palestinian Arab masses for action more readily than Muslim religious rhetoric and symbols. It was no coincidence that the April 1920 outbreak was triggered by religious festivities or that the far larger outbreak of 1929, in which about 130 Jews were murdered (including sixty-six ultraOrthodox, non-Zionist yeshiva students massacred by their neighbors in Hebron) was prompted by accusations that the Jews intended to take over the Haram al-Sharif (the noble sanctuary, the Temple Mount), destroy its two sacred mosques, and rebuild the Solomonic temple at the site. And it was indicative that the emerging leader of the Palestinian Arab national movement, Muhammad Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was to dominate Palestinian politics until mid-1948, was a (Muslim) cleric (an unusual phenomenon in third world nationalist movements). Al-Husseini and others consciously deployed religious rhetoric and symbols to mobilize the masses for anti-Zionist and, later, anti-British violence. But, of course, the chief recruiting agent for Palestinian Arab nationalism was Zionism itself. Above all, the fear of and antagonism toward the Zionist enterprise fueled national awareness and passions in the salons, coffee shops, and streets of Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Haifa. Yet Palestinian Arab society was acutely fragmented, and British Mandatory rule aggravated this divisiveness. Palestine’s Arabs exhibited little “national” solidarity, neither in 1920 nor in 1947. In the years between, few Palestinians proved eager, or even willing, to sacriﬁce life or purse for the national cause. A major fault line ran between the Muslim majority and the generally more prosperous, better-educated Christians, who were concentrated in the large towns. The British authorities favored the Christians with contracts, permits,\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n13\n\nand jobs, further alienating the majority. Through the Mandate, and especially in such crisis periods as the Arab Revolt of 1936–1939 and 1947–1948, Muslims suspected Christians of collaborating with the “enemy” and secretly hoping for continued (Christian) British rule or even Zionist victory. These suspicions were expressed in slogans, popular during the revolt, such as “After Saturday, Sunday”—that is, that the Muslims would take care of the Christians after they had “sorted out” the Jews. This probably further alienated the Christians from Muslim political aspirations, though many, to be sure, kept up nationalist appearances. “The Christians [of Jaffa] had participated in the 1936–1937 disturbances under duress and out of fear of the Muslims. The Christians’ hearts now and generally are not with the rioting,” reported the Haganah Intelligence Service (HIS).17 A Haganah list from the mid-1940s of Arabs with a “tendency to cooperation with the Jews” included “many . . . Christians” but few Muslims.18 Loyalties in Palestinian society continued, down to 1948, to run principally along family, clan, and regional lines. Envy and antagonism often divided families and clans within villages and, even more often, village from neighboring village (frequently there were age-old blood feuds and land disputes). And the inhabitants of one town often cared little for those of other towns; commercial rivalry habitually underpinned such hostility. Another, major fault line divided the sedentary rural population from neighboring bedouin tribes; the bedouins, of whom there were almost a hundred thousand in the late 1940s, were traditionally seen as a threat to village crops and herds. Vaguer but still real ﬁssures also separated townspeople from villagers, who tended to be less educated and less politically conscious and, within towns, between notable families and the mass of commoners. Through the Mandate years the agyan themselves were badly split. The leading Jerusalem notable families—the Khatibs, Khalidis, Husseinis, Nashashibis, Nusseibehs, and Budeiris—had been vying for positions of leadership, with their attendant prestige, economic beneﬁt, and social and political power, through the Ottoman centuries. In the 1920s these rivalries were reinforced by nationalist political considerations connected to the relations with the new Mandate authority and the challenge of Zionism. At the start of the Mandate, the Husseinis emerged as the country’s most powerful urban clan. Musa Kazim al-Husseini, the mayor of Jerusalem, served as chairman of the Palestine Arab Executive, the national movement’s leadership body until 1934, and Haj Amin al-Husseini was appointed by the British as Jerusalem’s grand mufti (1921) and head of the country’s Supreme Muslim Council (1922), subsequently emerging as the head of the Arab Higher Committee (AHC) and the leader of the Palestinian Arab national movement.\n\n14\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nAn Opposition (muGaridun) emerged, rallying around another of the notable Jerusalem families, the Nashashibis. Through the 1920s and 1930s (and, more subtly, during the 1940s), the Opposition struggled against Husseini dominance, occasionally backing this or that British measure or proposal and assisting the Mandate government, covertly or overtly, and even occasionally receiving material support from the Jewish Agency for Palestine, the emergent “government” of the Yishuv, the Jewish community in Palestine. Each clan was supported by other notable clans and elements of the rural and urban masses (often a function of each clan’s economic interests and holdings). For form’s sake, the vying coalitions of clans set up “political parties.” But in reality, what characterized Arab Palestine during the Mandate was a feudal “two-party” system with the Husseinis pitted against the Opposition. It was a struggle for power and its beneﬁts, not an ideological clash, though the Husseinis, almost from the start, painted their opponents as collaborators with British rule and soft on Zionism. The Nashashibis, though also ultimately desirous of political independence for Palestine under Arab rule, appeared to be more “moderate” than the Husseinis, whom the British and Zionists branded as “extremists.” Throughout the Mandate, the leading Arab families, including Husseinis and Opposition ﬁgures, sold land to the Zionists, despite their nationalist professions. Jewish landholding increased between 1920 and 1947 from about 456,000 dunams to about 1.4 million dunams. The main brake on Jewish land purchases, at least during the 1920s and 1930s, was lack of funds, not any Arab indisposition to sell.19 Moreover, hundreds of Arabs collaborated with the Zionist intelligence agencies.20 The bouts of violence of 1920, 1921, and 1929 were a prelude to the far wider, protracted eruption of 1936–1939, the (Palestine) Arab Revolt. Again, Zionist immigration and settlement—and the prospect of the Judaization of the country and possibly genuine fears of ultimate displacement—underlay the outbreak. But this time the threat was palpable: the resurgence of antiSemitism in Central and Eastern Europe had washed up on Palestine’s shores an unprecedented wave of Jewish immigration. The country’s Jewish population more than doubled in less than a decade, rising from 175,000 in 1931 to 460,000 in 1939; 1935 alone had seen the arrival of 62,000 legal immigrants. A far smaller number of illegals also trickled each year into the country. In less than a decade, the Arab proportion of the population had declined from 82 percent to under 70 percent. “What Arab cannot do his math and understand that immigration at the rate of 60,000 a year means a Jewish state in all of Palestine?” Ben-Gurion, chairman of the Jewish Agency Executive (JAE), wrote to Moshe Shertok (Sharett), director of the agency’s Political Depart-\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n15\n\nment, in 1937.21 (Throughout the Mandate period, there was also limited legal Arab immigration to Palestine from neighboring countries, prompted by the Mandate’s relative prosperity, as well as an indeterminate amount of illegal immigration, often seasonal, linked to this or that harvest. For example, according to HIS, 525 Arabs arrived legally from neighboring countries in 1944, 829 in 1945, and almost three thousand in 1946, most of the latter Christian Arabs recruited to serve in the Palestine police.)22 The Zionist leaders intermittently attempted to reach a compromise with the Arabs. But none proved possible. The Palestinian Arabs consistently sought to halt Zionist immigration and demanded “all of Palestine”; the Zionists as consistently insisted on continued immigration and Jewish statehood. Ben-Gurion argued that the Jewish inﬂux would better the condition of the Arabs as well as the Jews. Musa al-gAlami, a leading Palestinian moderate and assistant Mandate attorney general, countered: “I would prefer that the country remain impoverished and barren for another hundred years, until we ourselves are able to develop it on our own.”23 And Arab nationalists outside Palestine were no more amenable to an accommodation. At a meeting in 1936 between JA representatives (Eliahu Elath, Dov Hos, David Hacohen, and Yosef Nahmani) and leaders of the Syrian National Bloc (Shukri al-Quwwatli, Faiz Bey al-Khouri, and Lutﬁ Bey al-Haffar), al-Quwwatli countered, “What is the use of economic well-being if we are not masters in our own home,” after Hos made the conventional arguments.24 Both communities increased in power and size during the beneﬁcent years of the Mandate. But the Jews fared far better than the Arabs. They received enormous contributions and investments from Western Jewry and large British government loans; the Arabs beneﬁted from little foreign investment or loans. Jewish numbers had grown under the Ottomans from some twenty-ﬁve thousand to sixty to eighty-ﬁve thousand between 1881 and 1914. By the end of 1947, they had reached 630,000. The Arab increase had been less dramatic—from 450,000 (1881) to 650,000 (1918) to 1.3 million (1948). Economically, Palestinian Arab fortunes had steadily improved—but the Jews’ had soared. The net domestic product of the Palestine Arab community in 1922 had been 6.6 million pounds sterling; in 1947 it was 32.3 million. During the same period, the Yishuv’s had rocketed from 1.7 million pounds sterling to 38.5 million. The net product of the Jewish community in the manufacturing sector had jumped from 491,000 pounds sterling in 1922 to 31 million in 1947 (the Palestinian Arab equivalent was 539,000 pounds sterling to 6.7 million in 1945).25 In most other ﬁelds, the Yishuv had also advanced by leaps and bounds. Perhaps most signiﬁcantly, the Jews managed to forge internal, democratic governing institutions, which in 1947–1948 converted more or less smoothly\n\n16\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\ninto the agencies of the new State of Israel. The Jewish Agency for Palestine served as the Yishuv’s government, its Executive (the JAE), from 1929 until 1948, functioning as a cabinet. A number of bodies, such as the Jewish National Fund, the Histadrut Agricultural Center, and the agency’s Settlement Department, promoted land reclamation and settlement activity. The Yishuv established a “national” health care system, the Histadrut’s Sick Fund, and educational systems catering to its constituent communities (secular, socialist, Orthodox, ultra-Orthodox). In 1925—with a population of about 150,000—the Jews established their ﬁrst university, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. By comparison, Palestine’s Arabs established universities (in the West Bank and Gaza Strip) only in the 1970s (ironically, while under Israeli military occupation). From 1920, the Yishuv had a “national” militia, the Haganah, which in mid-1948 became the army of the new state, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). To run its institutions, the Yishuv efﬁciently taxed itself. By contrast, the Arabs relied for their institutions, such as the Supreme Muslim Council, and their services on British government funding. Starting in April 1936, armed Arab bands, based in the villages and the urban casbahs, began to attack Jewish trafﬁc and passersby. At the same time, the Palestinians reorganized politically, setting up National Committees (NCs) in each town and the Arab Higher Committee to oversee their struggle nationally. Both the AHC and the NCs initially represented the various political factions. The AHC declared an open-ended general strike and demanded British withdrawal and Palestinian independence under Arab rule. At the least, the rebels hoped to bludgeon the British into curbing the growth of the Zionist enterprise and Jewish immigration. The revolt enjoyed popular support throughout the Arab Middle East. Even before its outbreak, the Arab world had been smoldering with the idea of a jihad (holy war) against the Yishuv. The speaker of the Iraqi parliament, Sagid al-Haj Thabit, on a visit to Palestine in March 1936, repeatedly called for such a jihad.26 But the revolt was somewhat lackadaisical: initially, few Palestinians actually participated in hostilities, and they were disorganized and poorly led and equipped. By October they had managed to kill only twenty-eight Britons and eighty Jews (at a cost of some two hundred Arab dead). The British and the Yishuv reacted with restraint, though London began to curtail Jewish immigration. After ﬁve months of struggle, the Palestinians were exhausted and the sterling-earning citrus harvest season was kicking in. The British were happy to call it quits and covertly helped Haj Amin al-Husseini suspend the rebellion. London then dispatched to Palestine yet another committee of\n\nThe Peel Commission partition proposal, July 1937\n\n18\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\ninquiry, this time a royal commission, headed by Lord Peel. On 7 July 1937 the commission published a 404-page report. It exhaustively traced the history of the conﬂict and present realities and concluded both that the Mandate was unworkable and that the Jews and the Arabs could not live under one political roof. The commissioners recommended partition, with the Jews getting 20 percent (the Galilee and much of the Coastal Plain) on which to establish a state, and the Arabs getting more than 70 percent (Samaria, much of Judea, and the Negev), which should eventually be fused with Transjordan to create an enlarged Hashemite state under Emir gAbdullah. Something less than 10 percent of the country, including Jerusalem and Bethlehem, with their holy sites, and a strip of territory connecting the capital to the Mediterranean at Jaffa, should be retained by the British. The commission further recommended that the bulk of the three hundred thousand Arabs who lived in the territory earmarked for Jewish sovereignty should be transferred, voluntarily or under compulsion, to the Arab part of Palestine or out of the country altogether. The commission “balanced” this by recommending that the 1,250 Jews living in areas earmarked for Arab sovereignty be moved to the Jewish area—deeming the proposed transaction “an exchange of population.” In their testimony before the commission, the Zionist mainstream representatives had laid claim to the whole of the Land of Israel—the traditional Zionist platform. But in private conversations, Weizmann and others indicated a readiness for compromise based on partition as well as, quite probably, suggesting the “transfer” solution to the demographic problem posed by the prospective large Arab minority in the Jewish area. Zionism’s leaders, from Herzl through Menahem Ussishkin and Arthur Ruppin, had periodically proposed—in private letters and diaries—transfer as the requisite solution to the “Arab problem.” But transfer had never been adopted by the movement or any of the main Zionist parties (including the right-wing Revisionists) as part of a platform or ofﬁcial policy. Once the Peel Commission had given the idea its imprimatur, however, the ﬂoodgates were opened. Ben-Gurion, Weizmann, Shertok, and others—a virtual consensus—went on record in support of transfer at meetings of the JAE at the Twentieth Zionist Congress (in August 1937, in Zurich) and in other forums. To be sure, these advocates realized and usually acknowledged that the idea was impractical and unrealistic—the British could not be expected to carry out transfer, and the Yishuv, even if willing, was powerless—and transfer was never adopted as ofﬁcial Zionist policy. Yet through the late 1930s and early and mid-1940s Zionist leaders continued in private to espouse the idea. For example, Weizmann in late January 1941 told Ivan Maiskii, the Soviet ambassador to London: “If half a million Arabs could be transferred, two\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n19\n\nmillion Jews could be put in their place. . . . Weizmann said that . . . they would be transferring the Arabs only into Iraq and Transjordan.”27 Interestingly, senior British ofﬁcials and Arab leaders, including Emir gAbdullah and Nuri Sagid, Iraq’s premier politician (the same Nuri Sagid who in July 1939 called for the destruction of Zionism), shared this view.28 All understood that for a partition settlement to work and last, the emergent Jewish state would have to be ridded of its large and potentially or actively hostile Arab minority. As gAbdullah’s prime minister, Ibrahim Pasha Hashim, put it in 1946: “The only just and permanent solution lay in absolute partition with an exchange of populations; to leave Jews in an Arab state or Arabs in a Jewish state would lead inevitably to further trouble between the two peoples.”29 gAbdullah, according to Britain’s representative in Amman, Alec Kirkbride, concurred.30 The Peel recommendations enshrined the principles of partition and a “two-state” solution as the international community’s preferred path to a settlement of the conﬂict and were adopted by the mainstream of the Zionist movement (the minority right-wing Revisionists dissented). But the Husseini-led Palestinian leadership, and the Arab states in its wake, rejected both the explicit recommendations and the principle: all of Palestine was and must be ours, they said. They also, of course, abhorred the transfer recommendation. Responding to the Peel proposals, which Whitehall immediately endorsed, the Husseinis renewed the rebellion in late September 1937. The Opposition, which initially approved the recommendations and then recanted, sought to extend the truce, but viliﬁed as traitors, they were effectively cowed and silenced by a Husseini campaign of terrorism. The second and last stage of the rebellion, lasting until late spring–summer 1939, was far bloodier than the ﬁrst. The Arab rural bands renewed their attacks and were active in the towns as well. The Revisionist movement’s military arm, the Irgun Zvai Leumi (IZL, the National Military Organization, or simply Irgun), which had been formed by activist breakaways from the Haganah, subjected the Arab towns to an unnerving campaign of retaliatory terrorism, with special Haganah units adding to the bloodshed through selective reprisals. More important, the British now took off the gloves. In October 1937 they outlawed the AHC and the NCs and arrested many of their members. Haj Amin al-Husseini himself ﬂed into exile, where he remained— alternating mainly between Beirut and Cairo—until his death in 1974. After the rebellion peaked in summer 1938 (the rebels brieﬂy occupied the Old City of Jerusalem and Beersheba) and after being temporarily freed by the Munich Agreement from the specter of war in Europe, the British went on the offensive, clamping down hard. Between October 1938 and April 1939\n\n20\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nBritish units pushed into the casbahs and the rebel strongholds in the hill country and virtually annihilated the bands after coercing much of the rural population into collaboration. Dozens of houses were demolished, crops were destroyed, rebels and their accomplices were hanged, and thousands were jailed. In suppressing the rebellion, the British fenced and mined Palestine’s northern borders and secured towns and crossroads around the country with reinforced concrete police and army posts, called Tegart forts (which were to ﬁgure large in the battles of 1948 and mostly exist to this day, serving as Israeli and Palestinian Authority police stations). In identifying the rebels’ infrastructure, the British were assisted by the Haganah Intelligence Service, organized toward the end of the rebellion, and by newly created Opposition-aligned, anti-Husseini “peace bands,” that denied the rebels entry into dozens of villages. There was no formally announced end to the rebellion, but hostilities tapered off in spring and summer 1939, with the surviving rebels ﬂeeing to Lebanon and Syria. Yet the rebellion, coming as it did as Britain faced a worldwide three-front war against Japan, Italy, and Germany, almost succeeded—not militarily but politically. From the September 1938 Munich crisis onward, Britain came to view its Palestine policy almost exclusively through the prism of its needs and interests in the forthcoming global struggle. Simply put, London sought to appease the Arabs to assure quiet in the Middle East, which sat astride Britain’s lines of communication to southern Asia and the Far East. In May 1939 Whitehall issued a new white paper. It promised Palestine’s inhabitants statehood and independence within ten years; severely curtailed Jewish immigration, limiting it to ﬁfteen thousand entry certiﬁcates per year for ﬁve years, with all further Jewish immigration conditional on Arab approval (thus assuring an overwhelming Arab majority when independence came); and signiﬁcantly limited Jewish land purchase. In sum, this amounted to a complete reversal both of the Balfour Declaration policy and its muchmodiﬁed translation, the Peel Commission recommendations: Palestine was to remain Arab, and there would be no Jewish state. The Yishuv denounced the white paper as “illegal” and “appeasement” and mounted huge protest demonstrations; the IZL initiated sporadic attacks on British installations. The Palestinian street was overjoyed. But al-Husseini—as was the Palestinians’ wont—managed to pluck defeat from the jaws of victory. Instead of welcoming the British move, which Winston Churchill denounced as a cowardly “surrender to Arab violence,” al-Husseini and his colleagues rejected the white paper. They ﬂatly demanded full cessation of Jewish immigration, immediate British withdrawal, and immediate independence. In the brief months before world war broke out, nothing changed. The\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n21\n\nArab Revolt thus ended in unmitigated defeat for the Palestinians. Somewhere between three thousand and six thousand of their political and military activists had been killed, with many thousands more either driven into exile or jailed; the leadership of the Palestine Arab national movement was decimated, exiled, or jailed; and a deep chasm, characterized by blood feuds, divided the society’s elite families. Indeed, much of the elite was so disillusioned or frightened by what had happened that it permanently renounced political activity. The Palestinians had also suffered serious economic harm, through both the general strike and British repression. They had prematurely expended their military power against the wrong enemy and had been dealt a mortal blow in advance of the battle with the real enemy, Zionism. The damage to their war effort in 1947–1948 was incalculable. The triangular conﬂict in Palestine was put on hold for the duration of World War II. The British made it clear to the Yishuv that they would not countenance renewed troubles, and the Jews took heed. They shelved the struggle against the white paper, and tens of thousands of young Jews volunteered for service in the British army. Even the IZL sent volunteers to aid British military operations. The Zionist movement closed ranks in support of the Allies in the war against the Nazis. Palestine, awash with British troops, served as a giant rear base and workshop for the Eighth Army, which engaged the Italians and Germans in North Africa. The Palestinians, reeling from the suppression of their rebellion and largely unsympathetic to Western liberal, democratic values, grimly hoped for an Axis victory. In this, they were at one with most of the Arab world. The Palestinians, Khalil al-Sakakini, a Christian Jerusalem educator, jotted down in his diary, “rejoiced [as did ‘the whole Arab world’] when the British bastion at Tobruk fell [in 1941] to the Germans.”31 One of the ﬁrst public opinion polls in Palestine, conducted by al-Sakakini’s son, Sari Sakakini, on behalf of the American consulate in Jerusalem, in February 1941 found that 88 percent of the Palestinian Arabs favored Germany and only 9 percent Britain.32 The exiled al-Husseini himself helped raise a brief anti-British revolt in Baghdad in spring 1941 and then ﬂed to Berlin, where he served the Nazi regime for four years by broadcasting anti-British, jihadist propaganda to the Middle East and recruiting Bosnian Muslims for the Wehrmacht. He was deeply anti-Semitic. He later explained the Holocaust as owing to the Jews’ sabotage of the German war effort in World War I33 and the millennia of Gentile anti-Semitism as due to the Jews’ “character”: “One of the most prominent facets of the Jewish character is their exaggerated conceit and selﬁshness, rooted in their belief that they are the chosen people of God. There is no\n\n22\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nlimit to their covetousness and they prevent others from enjoying the Good. . . . They have no pity and are known for their hatred, rivalry and hardness, as Allah described them in the Qurhan.”34 But World War II was a crucible from which both the Jewish and Arab national movements would emerge strengthened and largely triumphant. The war’s vast weakening of British (and French) power and the concomitant rise in national consciousness and ideologies in the third world resulted almost immediately in the liberation from imperial rule of vast domains, stretching from Indonesia through India to the Arab Middle East. At war’s end, Transjordan (later Jordan), Syria, and Lebanon became independent, and other Arab territories—including Egypt and Iraq—enjoyed a loosening of the imperial grip. For the Jews, the world war meant, above all, the Holocaust. But while destroying Zionism’s main potential pool of manpower, Eastern European Jewry, the Holocaust also reenergized the movement as a powerful vehicle of the victimized and stateless, who now enjoyed the international community’s sympathy. In a larger sense, history was repeating itself, to the beneﬁt of Zionism. As the pogroms in Russia in the 1880s had launched modern Zionism, so the largest pogrom of them all propelled the movement, almost instantly, into statehood. And much as World War I had issued in the ﬁrst important statement of support for a Jewish “national home,” the Balfour Declaration, so the aftermath of World War II resulted in that decisive international warrant, the United Nations Partition Resolution of 29 November 1947, which would underpin the emergence of the State of Israel. In effect, the white paper policy remained in force through the war, even though Churchill—a pro-Zionist—had taken over the premiership in London in May 1940. In October 1941 he had written: “If Britain and the United States emerge victorious from the war, the creation of a great Jewish state in Palestine inhabitated [sic] by millions of Jews will be one of the leading features of the Peace Conference discussions.”35 But during the war, there was, in fact, little Churchill could do, apart from winning the war quickly enough to save at least some of Europe’s Jews. A secret cabinet committee he had set up in 1943 had recommended, as he had sought, a switch in British policy in favor of partition, but it was never acted upon. And although Churchill was continuously peeved by the Arabs’ pro-Axis behavior, he knew full well that Britain needed a quiescent Middle East in the rear of its ﬁghting formations and could not afford to rile them over Palestine. As Colonial Secretary Malcolm MacDonald put it, “If there was trouble in Palestine . . . there would be repercussions in Transjordania, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt and even echoes of that trouble in India.”36 But Churchill did authorize the establish-\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n23\n\nment of both the Palmah, a guerrilla strike force of Haganah members to be used if the Germans conquered Palestine, and the Jewish Brigade, a large formation composed mainly of volunteers from the Yishuv that fought with the British army in Italy. The veterans of both were to stand the Yishuv in good stead in the 1948 War. In the ﬁrst months of World War II, Zionist organizations stepped up efforts to save European Jews from the impending massacre—and to strengthen the Yishuv by bringing them to Palestine—through an illegal immigration operation run mainly by the newly created Institute for Illegal Immigration (hamossad leGaliya bilti ligalit), a secret arm of the Haganah. The British countered with a Royal Navy cordon that intercepted the rickety steamers, and many were stopped and their passengers reshipped to detention camps in Mauritius and, later, Cyprus. But by mid-1941 both Zionist and British efforts had become largely irrelevant: the Germans had overrun Europe and closed its ports while changing their policy toward the Jews from one of encouraging emigration to initiating mass murder. Few Jews reached Palestine from Europe during 1941–1945. Nonetheless, the war signiﬁcantly speeded up the march toward Jewish statehood. In January 1942, Chaim Weizmann, in an article in Foreign Affairs, explicitly demanded the establishment of a Jewish “state” in all of Palestine.37 And in May, an Extraordinary Zionist Conference, attended by most leaders of American Zionism, a number of exiled European Zionist leaders, and three members, including Ben-Gurion, of the JAE from Jerusalem, formalized this demand by voting to support what became known as the Biltmore Program (drafted by Meyer Weisgal, a Weizmann aide). Meeting at the Biltmore Hotel, New York, the delegates called for “the Land of Israel to be established as a Jewish Commonwealth integrated in the structure of the new [postwar] democratic world.”38 By “commonwealth” they meant state. This was to remain Zionist policy down to the end of 1947. Palestine remained under British control, and the 1939 white paper continued to guide Whitehall’s policies. But during the two and a half years between the end of World War II and the start of the ﬁrst Arab-Israeli war, developments on the ground—in Washington, Palestine, and Europe—were to prove more important than the character and mindset of Whitehall’s mandarins or their calculations and declarations. In the United States, the Jews decisively won the battle for the hearts and minds of the American people and its leaders, due to the impact of the Holocaust and effective Zionist propaganda. The existence of the ﬁve-million-strong Jewish community proved extremely important. The Jews, themselves energized and united by the Holocaust, were well organized and wealthy and were traditionally big donors\n\n24\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nto political campaigns. They also tended to vote in high numbers, were concentrated in such key electoral states as New York and California, and were, by tradition, Democrats. It was Zionism’s luck that Democrats controlled the White House and Congress during the war and postwar years. Perhaps the surprising thing is that, despite Jewish clout, the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt had managed during the 1930s and the ﬁrst years of the war to desist from anything but insigniﬁcant expressions of sympathy for Zionism. Roosevelt avoided a forthright commitment to Jewish statehood. The plight of European Jewry may have weighed heavily on the side of Zionism; but American global interests, as they emerged in the war against Germany, Italy, and Japan and as perceived by most senior ofﬁcials in the relevant departments (State, Defense), militated in the other direction. The ofﬁcials worried about the continued supply of oil, American bases, and open lines of communication as well as, from the war’s end, countering Soviet inﬂuence and power. The continued goodwill or, at least, neutrality of the Arab world remained a major American interest. In May 1943 Roosevelt assured King gAbdul gAziz Ibn Sagud of Saudi Arabia that both Arabs and Jews would be heard before the powers decided on the contours of the postwar settlement in Palestine. But the last months of the war saw a dramatic, gradual shift in American policy. In March 1944 the White House, under pressure from various departments, may have persuaded Congress to withdraw a joint resolution calling on Britain to rescind the white paper and supporting a Jewish state. But Roosevelt assured the Jews that “full justice will be done [after the war] to those who seek a Jewish national home, for which our Government and the American People have always had the deepest sympathy and today more than ever in view of the tragic plight of hundreds of thousands of homeless Jewish refugees.”39 During the second half of 1944, both the Republicans and Democrats included in their election platforms pro-Zionist provisions, with the Republican presidential contender, Governor Thomas Dewey, declaring support for the establishment of a “Jewish . . . commonwealth” in Palestine. At Yalta, in February 1945, Roosevelt, in conversation with Joseph Stalin, described himself as “a Zionist” (to which the Soviet dictator rejoined, “me too,” but then added that Jews were “middlemen, proﬁteers, and parasites”).40 Though the following month Roosevelt assured Ibn Sagud that he would support “no action . . . that would prove hostile to the Arab people,”41 the growingly Zionist orientation of American public opinion, fueled by the revelation of the full horror of the Holocaust, proved inexorable. Roosevelt’s sudden death in April clinched the Zionist victory in Washington, with the more sympathetic vice president, Harry Truman, taking over the White House.\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n25\n\nTruman was not the committed philo-Semite or Zionist Arab propagandists and Zionist politicians later made out. In 1944, Truman had pointedly declined to support his party’s pro-Zionist platform. And he reportedly told his cabinet in July 1946 that he had “no use for them [the Jews] and didn’t care what happened to them.”42 Without doubt, he was often annoyed and even angered by the perpetual Zionist importunings, blandishments, cajolery, and pressure to which he was subjected during 1945–1948. And once converted to supporting partition, he was pessimistic about the outcome: “I fear very much that the Jews are like all underdogs. When they get on top they are just as intolerant and cruel as the people were to them when they were underneath.”43 But in August 1945, in Potsdam, Truman came out in principle in support of resettling the Holocaust survivors, the Jewish displaced persons (DPs), in Palestine (in response to which Arab League secretary-general gAbd al-Rahman gAzzam declared that this could touch off a new war between Christianity and Islam, as had the medieval Crusades.44 gAzzam had long been tagged by the British as “intransigent.” Back in 1939, he had told Weizmann that “there was nothing for it but a ﬁght to the death against the Jews.”)45 Truman pointedly asked the British prime minister to lift the restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine.46 Soon, this had crystallized into open support for the immediate resettlement in Palestine of “100,000” DPs. For Palestine’s Arabs, the war years passed without signiﬁcant change. True, their ﬁnancial assets grew substantially because of Allied spending and investment.47 But militarily and politically, things remained much the same. Few—perhaps ﬁve or six thousand—signed up with the Allied armed forces or otherwise gained military experience; there was no increment in local military force or organization. And the political (and military) leadership that had been shattered in 1938–1939 remained either in exile, neutered, or hors de combat. But by mid-1943, it had become increasingly clear to Palestinian and outside Arab leaders that the Allies would win and that, whatever their true feelings, the Arabs had better at least edge toward, if not jump outright onto, the bandwagon. To gain anything from the Allied victory in the postwar settlement, Palestine’s Arabs would need to have a recognized leadership and an organization capable of managing the coming struggle and reaping its possible rewards. During 1943 the former heads of Palestine’s Istiqlal Party—gAwni gAbd al-Hadi, Rashid Haj Ibrahim, and Ahmad Hilmi Pasha— launched an effort to reunite the Palestinian nationalist movement. In August, Ahmad Hilmi began to reorganize the Arab National Fund, designed to counter Jewish land purchasing, and in November, the ﬁfteenth conference of the Palestinian Arab chambers of commerce met in Jerusalem and set\n\n26\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nin motion a process to elect new Palestinian national representation. The Istiqlalists’ platform called for the rigid implementation of the provisions of the 1939 white paper.48 Because of Husseini opposition, matters hung ﬁre. But not to be outdone, the Husseinis also began to reorganize. True, their main leaders were in exile—Haj Amin in Berlin, serving the Nazis, and Jamal Husseini, interned in Southern Rhodesia. But the remaining local leadership, spearheaded by Emile Ghury, a Greek Orthodox journalist, in April 1944 formally relaunched the Palestine Arab Party, whose central demands were immediate Palestinian Arab independence, the cessation of Jewish immigration, and “the dissolution of the Jewish National Home.” By September, the Husseinis were once again the most active and powerful political faction in Arab Palestine.49 Returning to the fray, the Palestinians, led by the Husseinis, on Balfour Declaration day, 2 November, launched nationwide protests. The “repoliticization” of Palestine’s Arabs at war’s end coincided with the British-supported drive for pan-Arab unity, which had captivated the political imagination of the Middle East since before World War I. During 25 September–7 October 1944, delegates from seven Arab countries met in Alexandria and founded “a League . . . of Independent Arab States,” henceforward known as the Arab League. On 22 March 1945, these states formally signed a pact in Cairo. A secretariat was set up in the Egyptian capital, with the Egyptian gAbd al-Rahman gAzzam as secretary-general.50 The Palestinians had sent Musa al-gAlami to the gathering in Alexandria. He was designated ﬁrst an “observer,” then a “delegate,” the Palestinian Arab community thus enjoying, at least theoretically, an equal footing with existing or emergent Arab states. At the end of the conference, the delegates issued the Alexandria Protocol. A section was devoted to the issue of Palestine. The Arab states resolved that “Palestine constitutes an important part of the Arab world and that the rights of the [Palestine] Arabs cannot be touched without prejudice to peace and stability in the Arab world.” The League endorsed the demand for a stoppage of Jewish immigration, the cessation of land sales, and “independence for Palestine.” In light of the international circumstances—almost universal horror over the Holocaust and growing American pressure to resettle the remnants of European Jewry in Palestine—the Arab states declared that they were “second to none in regretting the woes which have been inﬂicted on the Jews of Europe by European dictatorial states. But the question of these Jews should not be confused with Zionism, for there can be no greater injustice and aggression than solving the problem of the Jews of Europe by another injustice, that is, by inﬂicting injustice on the Palestine Arabs.”51\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n27\n\nTo add cogency to their demands for a voice in the expected postwar settlement, four of the states—Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia—in early 1945 declared war on the Axis, thus assuring membership in the nascent United Nations Organization, the heir to the interwar League of Nations. The establishment of the Arab League at once strengthened the Palestinian cause and weakened the voice of Palestinian nationalism. On one hand, the Arab states collectively weighed in behind Palestinian Arab demands. But at the same time, the pact gave the member states the right to select who would represent the Palestinian Arabs in their councils, so long as Palestine was not independent. Coupled with the continued factional deadlock within Arab Palestine, this assured, in the words of one historian, that “the initiative in Palestine Arab politics thus passed to the heads of the Arab states” and “major political decisions on the organization of Arab resistance to Zionism were thereafter taken not at Jerusalem but at Cairo.”52 And indeed, it was to be at the initiative of the Arab League that in November 1945 the AHC was reestablished as the supreme executive body of the Palestine Arab community. Months of haggling between the factions had failed to produce agreement. A twelve-member AHC was appointed, with ﬁve Husseini representatives, two independents, and ﬁve other members, including Gharib Nashashibi, representing the other (now resurrected) pre1939 parties.53 But the return to the Middle East of the mufti’s cousin, Jamal Husseini, and renewed Husseini-Opposition quarreling precipitated the disbandment, in March 1946, of the reestablished AHC. The Opposition set up its own organization, the Arab Higher Front, and Jamal reconstituted an AHC manned only by Husseini family members and afﬁliates. In June, to break the stalemate, the Arab League foreign ministers intervened and, nominally replacing both the AHF and the new AHC, imposed upon the Palestinians a new leadership body, the Arab Higher Executive (AHE), with Haj Amin al-Husseini as (absent) chairman and Jamal Husseini as vice-chairman. The Husseinis were now ﬁrmly back in the saddle, this time with the imprimatur of the Arab League. Haj Amin now returned to the Middle East from his temporary refuge in France and began directing Palestinian Arab affairs from Cairo. In January 1947, the nine-member AHE was renamed the AHC.54 The Palestinian Arabs appeared once more to have a relatively uniﬁed, if not particularly representative, leadership. THE YISHUV RISES\n\nBut viewed against this political shadowboxing, developments in the Zionist camp proved to be far more signiﬁcant. If the outbreak of the world war had put an almost immediate brake on Jewish resistance to the white pa-\n\n28\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nper, its approaching end opened the ﬂoodgates. No longer was there need to close ranks in the ﬁght against the Nazis; the Third Reich was ﬁnished. Moreover, Europe was awash with hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors, desperate to rebuild their lives away from the killing ﬁelds and, if it was up to the Zionists, to resettle in Palestine. But Britain—meaning the cabinet in London, the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, and the security forces in Palestine—stood between the DP camps and the Promised Land. On 27 September 1945 the Zionist leadership proclaimed that the blockade was “tantamount to a death sentence upon . . . those liberated Jews . . . still languishing in . . . Germany.”55 A revolt that had been postponed for six years was now about to break out. Already in May 1943 Field Marshal Harold Alexander, commander of Britain’s forces in the Middle East, had warned London that there was a “probability” of an anti-British revolt by the Yishuv at war’s end: “[The] Jews mean business and are armed and trained.”56 A year earlier, in mid-1942, SIME (Secret Intelligence Middle East), the Middle Eastern arm of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, had estimated, fairly accurately, that the Haganah had thirty thousand members, with arms for 50–70 percent of them. The IZL could ﬁeld another thousand trained men, with several thousand supporters.57 The Yishuv had not wasted the war years. More than twenty-six thousand of its men and women had joined the British army and acquired a measure of military training;58 arms had been stolen or illegally purchased, and Haganah numbers had increased. Most signiﬁcantly, in May–June 1941 the Haganah—with British assistance, as mentioned earlier—had established a small, permanent strike force, the Palmah (an abbreviation of plugot mahatz, or shock companies), headed by Yitzhak Sadeh, the veteran Red Army soldier and Haganah commando leader. The Yishuv leadership regarded the Palmah as both an instantly available crack force to fend off Arab attacks and as a commando unit to be used against the Nazis should the Afrika Korps conquer Palestine. As it turned out, the Germans failed to break through the Allied defenses in Egypt. Nonetheless, the Palmah saw some action. In June 1941, it provided forty scouts and sappers who accompanied the Allied units that invaded Vichy-controlled Lebanon and Syria. (It was at Eskandelion [Iskenderun], in southern Lebanon, that, leading one reconnaissance squad, Moshe Dayan lost his eye to a Vichy sniper). And during 1943–1945, the Palmah provided the British with some two dozen saboteurs and radio operators who were parachuted into Nazi-occupied Europe to link up with partisan units and threatened Jewish communities. From 1942, the Palmah constituted a small, standing army, its platoons\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n29\n\ndispersed among several dozen kibbutzim and two or three towns. The recruits put in a fortnight each month working in the ﬁelds (to cover their upkeep) and devoted the rest of their time to training. By war’s end, the Palmah had grown to some two thousand men and women. But another group ﬁrst disturbed the calm in Palestine. Already in the war’s ﬁrst months, British installations were periodically attacked by the LHI (Lohamei Herut Yisrael or Freedom Fighters of Israel, dubbed “the Stern Gang” by the British). The organization was established in 1939–1941 by several dozen breakaway IZL members who opposed the truce with the British. The LHI—led initially by Avraham (“Yair”) Stern—continued to view the British, not the Germans, as the Jewish people’s main enemy; it was the British who were preventing Jews from escaping Europe, reaching Palestine, and attaining independence. At the end of 1940, the LHI tried to establish an “alliance” with Nazi Germany for the “common” struggle against Britain. An operative named Naftali Lubinczik was sent to Beirut, where he made contact with Otto Werner von Hentig, a German Foreign Ministry ofﬁcial and intelligence ofﬁcer, and explicitly offered “military, political and intelligence” cooperation. But Berlin was uninterested. Lubinczik returned to Palestine, where the British jailed him. But Stern was not easily deterred. At the end of 1941, some months after the beginning of the Holocaust, with the Afrika Korps at the gates of Egypt, Stern tried again. He dispatched one of his deputies, Natan Friedman-Yelin, to make contact with German ofﬁcials in Turkey, with instructions to propose that Germany allow out hundreds of thousands of Balkan Jews. What he was to offer the Nazis in return is not clear. In any event, he got only as far as Aleppo, where Allied police picked him up.59 Nor did the LHI’s campaign in 1940–1943 in Palestine amount to much. The LHI’s minute size, Haganah and IZL tip-offs, and effective British clampdowns saw to that. LHI operations were limited almost completely to thefts of weaponry (sometimes from Jewish caches rather than British military stockpiles) and bank robberies. In one payroll heist, in January 1942, LHI gunmen shot dead two Histadrut ofﬁcials. But starting in 1944, the British faced a far more serious challenge. On 1 February, several days after Menachem Begin, a leader of the Revisionist movement in Poland and an ex-Polish army soldier, took over command of the organization, the IZL announced the resumption of the armed struggle. The war in Europe was near its end, and Britain was still barring the door to Palestine. The IZL, like the LHI and some senior mainstream Zionist leaders, felt that the Arabs were insigniﬁcant: the main battle for Jewish statehood would have to be fought against the British. During February, IZL\n\n30\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nsquads blew up government immigration and income tax ofﬁces; in March, they attacked a series of police buildings. On 17 May, IZL squads raided the British radio station in Ramallah and, on 22 August, attacked the British police headquarters in Tel Aviv–Jaffa. On 27 September, the organization attacked police stations in Beit Dajan, Qalqilya, Haifa, and Qatra. On 8 August, the LHI tried to assassinate the high commissioner in Palestine, Harold MacMichael.60 The mainstream Zionist leadership and press roundly condemned the dissidents’ attacks. The Irgun members were labeled “misguided terrorists,” “young fanatics crazed by the sufferings of their people into believing that destruction will bring healing.”61 Under Zionist mainstream pressure, the LHI suspended its attacks in November 1944, after its members assassinated the British minister of state in the Middle East, Lord Moyne, in Cairo. But the IZL deﬁed the JAE and continued its attacks. The Haganah declared an “open hunting season” (in Zionist historiography, the “Saison”) against the IZL, and Haganah intelligence and Palmah teams systematically assaulted and incarcerated IZL members, conﬁscated their weapons caches, and occasionally handed them or their names and addresses to the British. The Saison lasted from November 1944 to March 1945.62 But the changed international situation and growing activist rumblings within the Haganah eventually issued in a radical change of tack. The end of the war in Europe triggered the reopening of the struggle against the white paper by mainstream Zionism. In June, a Jewish Agency memorandum demanded that Britain allow a hundred thousand immigrants into Palestine immediately;63 the DPs could not be allowed open-endedly to languish in Europe “among the graveyards of the millions of their slaughtered brethren,” Ben-Gurion declared.64 Churchill wondered whether Britain could cast off the burden of Palestine: “I do not think we should take the responsibility upon ourselves of managing this very difﬁcult place while the Americans sit back and criticize,” he wrote on 6 July. “I am not aware of the slightest advantage which has ever accrued to Great Britain from this painful and thankless task. Somebody else should have their turn now.”65 But Churchill never got the chance. In the general elections that month he was swept from ofﬁce and a Labour government, headed by Clement Attlee, took over. Ernest Bevin, no friend of Zionism, became foreign secretary. In August Bevin proposed that immigration to Palestine be limited to ﬁfteen hundred per month. Weizmann and BenGurion demurred, and so, within weeks, would Truman. Truman had sent Earl G. Harrison, the US representative on the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees, to visit the European DP camps, many of them run and ﬁnanced by the American occupation authorities.\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n31\n\nHarrison found that the DPs wanted to immigrate to Palestine and recommended that Britain immediately issue one hundred thousand additional entry certiﬁcates. Truman forwarded the recommendation to Attlee with an in-principle endorsement. In mid-October 1945, ignoring a British request for discretion, Truman publicly supported the “100,000” recommendation. London was furious. This diplomatic drama played out against the background of increasing anti-British violence in Palestine. The IZL and LHI, who had continued to attack police stations, telephone poles, and banks, were joined in early October by the Haganah, nonplussed by the result of the British elections and Labour’s abandonment (or betrayal) of the Zionist cause (the year before, the Labour Party Executive had even advocated the transfer of Arabs out of the prospective Jewish state). The three armed groups negotiated a formal accord, known as the Hebrew Rebellion Movement (tnuGat hameri haGivri), and on the night of 9–10 October several Palmah squads raided the British detention camp at gAtlit and freed 208 incarcerated illegal immigrants.66 What followed was even more dramatic: on the night of 1 November Palmah sappers blew up railway tracks at 153 points around Palestine and, a few days later, destroyed a patrol vessel and two British coast guard stations, at Givgat Olga and Sayidna gAli. The British reacted by raiding a handful of kibbutzim, which were suspected of housing illegal immigrants, and panicky troops killed nine civilians and wounded sixty-three. Anti-British emotions crested. Bombings of British installations continued through the winter and spring, culminating in the spectacular simultaneous destruction by Palmah sappers, on the night of 17 June 1946, of eleven bridges connecting Palestine to Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. Meanwhile, the Haganah renewed its illegal immigration campaign. Boats were intercepted by the Royal Navy and their passengers interned. But others got through. Between August 1945 and 14 May 1948, some 70,700 illegals landed on Palestine’s shores. The Zionist leadership understandably used the plight of the DPs to further Zionist goals, even occasionally risking and sacriﬁcing lives to further the movement’s ends.67 As the leaders understood, Britain’s dilemma was stark: to stick to its guns and ﬂatly reject Truman’s “100,000” proposal would jeopardize the cornerstone of British foreign policy, the Anglo-American alliance—at a time when American goodwill was vital on a broad front of political, military, and economic issues (containing Soviet expansionism, keeping the British pound aﬂoat, and so on). But to allow the hundred thousand into Palestine would enrage the Arab world and invite renewed rebellion in Palestine and, possibly, general turbulence in the Middle East. A foretaste was provided on 2 November 1945, when Arab mobs rioted across the Middle East and North Africa, burning Jewish shops,\n\n32\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\nhomes, and synagogues in Alexandria, and slaughtering about a hundred Jews in British-governed Tripolitania (Libya).68 Whitehall chose the path of least resistance—the establishment of yet another committee of inquiry, this time jointly with the Americans. At the very least it would buy a few months; and perhaps it would result in mobilizing Washington to share costs and/or responsibility. The British wanted the committee to focus on the DPs, with “Palestine” to be omitted from the terms of reference. Washington objected. The appointment of the AngloAmerican Committee (AAC) was announced on 13 November. The threat of an Anglo-American rupture was averted, and the Haganah brieﬂy suspended its attacks to enable the inquiry to go forward in an atmosphere of relative calm. The twelve-man committee was instructed “to examine political, economic and social conditions in Palestine as they bear upon the problem of Jewish immigration and settlement therein” and “to examine the position of the Jews in those countries in Europe where they have been victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution, [to assess how they might be reintegrated in those countries,] . . . and to make estimates of those who wish or will be impelled by their conditions to migrate to Palestine or other countries outside Europe.”69 The AAC—the “twelve apostles,” as they were dubbed—was chaired by a British judge, Sir John Singleton, and included the American Quaker Frank Aydelotte, director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, James McDonald, former League of Nations high commissioner for Refugees from Germany, Pulitzer Prize—winner Frank W. Buxton, a former editor of the Boston Herald, and lawyer Bartley Crum; and British Labour Party MP and assistant editor of the New Statesman and Nation Richard H. S. Crossman; Conservative Party MP Reginald E. Manningham-Buller; and Labour’s Lord Robert C. Morrison. In launching the committee, Bevin preempted its recommendations by publicly setting out Britain’s short- and long-term goals. He hoped that the committee would propose relieving Britain of the Mandate and replacing it with an international “trusteeship.” After a time, an independent, Arabmajority state would be established. He warned the Jews not to push their way to “the head of the queue,” lest they trigger an anti-Semitic reaction. Meanwhile, Britain would curb Jewish immigration, imposing a ceiling of ﬁfteen hundred entry certiﬁcates a month. The Jewish Agency denounced Bevin’s “prejudging” the committee’s ﬁndings.70 During February and March 1946 the committee studied the situation of the DPs in Europe, toured the Middle East, and heard out Arab and Zionist representatives and British ofﬁcials. Some outside observers, such as the\n\nS TA K I N G C L A I M S\n\n33\n\nphilo-Zionist South African prime minister Jan Smuts and Dr. Walter C. Lowdermilk, an expert on agricultural development, were also consulted. The Palestinians’ “Arab Ofﬁce,” headed by Musa al-gAlami, cautioned the AAC against regarding “Jewish colonization in Palestine and Arab resistance to it in terms of white colonization of America and Australia and the resistance of the Red Indians and Aborigenes.” Nor would Zionist-engendered prosperity persuade the Arabs to shelve their opposition to a movement that was bent on their dispossession.71 The Jewish Agency presented a report that emphasized Arab (and speciﬁcally Palestinian Arab) backwardness and Zionism’s role as a bearer of enlightenment and progress. The agency offered reams of statistics and graphs to demonstrate Zionist beneﬁcence. Of particular effect was the month the committee members spent touring DP camps, especially in Poland. Jewish Agency agents, working behind the scenes, made sure that the committee met and heard only Jews propounding the Zionist solution. The committee found that the displaced Jews in Poland lived in an “atmosphere of terror,” with “pogroms . . . an everyday o"
