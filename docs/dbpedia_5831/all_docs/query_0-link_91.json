It is home to one of the world's major diamond exchanges, and many high-tech industries.\n\nRamat Gan was established in 1921 as a moshav shitufi, a communal farming settlement. In 2019 it had a population of 163,480.[1]\n\nHistory\n\nRamat Gan was established by the Ir Ganim[2] association in 1921 as a satellite town of Tel Aviv. The first plots of land were purchased between 1914 and 1918.[3] It stood just south of the Arab village of Jarisha. The settlement was initially a moshava, a Zionist agricultural colony that grew wheat, barley and watermelons.[4] The name of the settlement was changed to Ramat Gan (lit: Garden Height) in 1923. The settlement continued to operate as a moshava until 1933, although it achieved local council status in 1926. At this time it had 450 residents. In the 1940s, Ramat Gan became a battleground in the country's language war: A Yiddish language printing press in Ramat Gan was blown up by Hebrew-language extremists.[5]\n\nOver the years, the economy shifted from agriculture to commerce and industry. By 1946, the population had grown to 12,000.[3] In 1950, Ramat Gan was recognized as a city.

So many Iraqi immigrants settled in Ramat Gan that it became known as \"Little Baghdad.\"[6] In 1955, it had a population of 55,000. The first mayor was Avraham Krinitzi who remained in office for 43 years.
