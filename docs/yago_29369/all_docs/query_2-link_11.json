The couple had one son, King Michael, before their divorce in 1927, when Carol renounced his right to the Throne in favour of his son, only to return a few years into King Michaelâ€™s reign and become King for 10 years until his abdication, when Queen Helen returned and remained with King Michael until and after his abdication.\n\nRelated"
