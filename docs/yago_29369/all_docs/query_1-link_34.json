        "text": "Hmm... let's make an exercise of imagination...\n\nIn 8 September 1870, an healthy baby boy was born to the (still) Princiar couple, Carol von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen of Romania and Elisabeth of Wied. Let's say that he will be called Carol... Carol II of Romania. He will be a bright man, inheriting from his father (and mother) the intellect and the strength of character.\n\nI've started a while back a TL focused on the formation of Romanian modern state in which King Carol had have a son. I never finish it but I plan to re-start it sometime in the future. The following were my rough ideas:\n\n- Religion: young Carol will be baptized in Orthodox religion (a requirement accepted by Carol).\n\n- Education: old Carol will want to have his son being educated in Germany, while the Romanian elites will prefer France. The chances are great that the young boy will be educated in Germany (for the first part of the education) and then study some military schools in Paris and, most probably, in London.\n\n- Between 1890-1895, the 20 years and so Prince Carol (now Royal Crown Prince) will be pressured to marry. For strategic considerations, I believe that a British marriage will remain in cards, but who? He might be even married to the OTL wife of Ferdinand, Princess Marie of Edinburgh, the granddaughter of Queen Victoria as well as of the Tsar Alexandre III. That will be funny! She was born on 29 October 1875, so she is 5 years younger than her TTL husband. Both are very strong characters which might go well or not...\n\n- Prince Carol will start to be involved in Romanian politics and internal affairs. However, Carol heavy hand on Romanian politics will not give him too much room of maneuver. Let's say that he will inherit his father passion for the army (Carol was reported to be an excellent officer... Prussian officer), so his father will allow him to take care of the army so he will not be \"corrupted\" by the politics. Doing this, will tremendously affect the fate of the Romanian army. If by 1877 (the Ruso-Ottoman war and the Romanian Independence war) the Romanian army was small but very well maned and quite modern, after the signing the secret adherence to the Central Powers in 1883, King Carol lost his interest on keeping Romanian army modern and well financed. He simply view it as an auxiliary force of the German army. With his son interested in the army, the Romanian army will continue to receive founding, maybe cut some better deals which will reduce its dependence of Austria-Hungary in terms of weapons and munitions. Maybe a certain level of weapon production will take form.\n\n- As per OTL, in 1907 a great peasant revolt started in Romania and the army was sent to quell it. Prince Carol is directly implicated and he directly face the desperate situation in which the Romanian peasants lived. The experience mark him and push him to take side of the liberal movement. However, his involvement in the repression is a stain on his image. He will struggle for many years to remove it, or at least to make it forget.\n\n- The Balkan wars happens as per OTL... In the second war, Romania attack Bulgaria and occupy Silistra. Maybe it is not so stupid as per OTL to take the entire of Southern Dobruja which was in majority Bulgarian... or maybe not... However, the Romanian army is in far better shape. The shortcomings are fewer and easier to address.\n\n- In 1914, the WWI start (however, the starting reason could be easier butterflied, but let say that the Great Powers go to war). King Carol demand Romania to join the CP but the Govern and the Cabinet refuse. A-H is the aggressor, Romania was only bound in a defensive war against Russia. While not being a Francophile, Prince Carol refuse to support his father and vote for neutrality. Doing so, all his previous faults will be pardoned. He become tremendously popular. Carol is devastated by this \"treason\" and by the lack of power to support his natal country in war. He dies soon after and his son is crowned.\n\n- King Carol II start to implement reforms to ameliorate the condition of the peasants but he is strongly opposed by the great landowners.\n\nSooner or later... the Prime minister Bratianu negotiate the entrance of Romania in the war. After long debates, he received from Antante the requested guarantees and promises, which as per OTL are not meant to be kept. France and Russia see Romania as cannon fodder. The Romanian army is far better prepared than OTL and maybe better led.\n\nIn a morning of 1915 or 1916, King Carol II order his battalions to cross the Carpathians. As per OTL, Kaiser Wilhelm think that the war was lost as Budapest will soon fall... Different than OTL, the Romanian army perform better and manage to push the A-H out of Transylvania before the Germans sent reinforcements to crush the Romanians.\n\nFrom now, it's up to you!...\n\nAlright looks good, I think a strong showing in World War One, could well increase Romanian prestige within Europe, and perhaps enable to gain some major concessions from the allies, perhaps even Transylvannia?\n\nIn OTL, Romania make a good show in the war, but only on the second part of it, after the French mission re-organised the army. in 1916, they went to war with the 1913 doctrine and they were slaughtered by the battle-hardened Germans and Austrians, far better armed and with a far better doctrine and commandment. Moreover, the Romanian army suffered from lack of weapons and munitions, had very few machine-guns, heavy guns, planes, etc. and her weapon and munition supplier was... well, Steyr Mannlicher (which starting with 1914 stopped all the commands deliveries).\n\nThinks that Romanian entrance coincide with a lull on the western front and with Borusilov offensive loosing steam. Germany throw against Romanian two of her best generals (Mackenzen and Ludendorf) and several very experienced divisions (including the Bavarian alpine corps were a certain captain named Rommel performed admirably storming the Carpathian paths). Romania numbered her strength in how many bayonets could put on the front (a veeeeery long one), while Germany... well, they were adopting the Stormtroopers, creeping artillery barrage, etc.\n\nRomania was forced out of war and signed separate peace because Bolshevik Revolution pull Russia out of war, giving huge lands to Germany and making the Romanian front untenable anymore. Moreover, there were many Russian soldiers which fought alongside Romanians in Moldavia and which now turned red and go home pillaging their way trough. The Romanians were forced to fight off their former allies. There were many clashes between the two armies, which entire Russian divisions disarmed and escorted out of the frontier... all this having Germans occupying half of the country and ready for a third match...\n\nNow, concerning the territorial gains.\n\nIn OTL, Romania received Transylvania (with Crisana and Maramures), N Bucovina and 1/2 of Banat at Trianon... however on the ground, the situation was already cutted and roughfuly decided as the Romanian army already controlled the territory (Romania was even forced to step back from the Tissa River to the now existing frontier). The lands inhabited by the Romanians were not conquered by Romanian army but voted to secede from Hungary and to join Romania. Firstly Bucovina, then Transylvania in 1 dec 1918...\n\nRomanian army crossed the Carpathians again, but this time to push the Hungarian army which tried to repress the secession.\n\nAlso, the unification with Bassarabia was... well as the entire unification, a miracle.\n\nIn 1919, 1920, the Romanian army was another beast than in 1916. It was well armed and battle-hardened. It learned the lessons of the modern war on the hard way.... only to loose them several years later..."
