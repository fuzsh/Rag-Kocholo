In 1890 the House Nassau replaced the House Orange-Nassau as reigning House in Luxembourg after the death of King Willem III of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. So Elizabeth herself was half a Nassau via her mother.\n\nElizabeth's aunt Princess Helena von Nassau (1831-1888) married the Fürst von Waldeck und Pyrmont. Her daughter Emma, herself half a Nassau via her mother, would marry with the said King Willem III of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. This means Queen Elizabeth of Romania (\"Carmen Sylva\") was a full cousin of Queen Emma of the Netherlands.\n\nBesides this, Princess Elizabeth's own brother Wilhelm, would marry Princess Marie of the Netherlands, Princess of Orange-Nassau, even more linking the Romanian Hohenzollerns closer to the Nassau dynasty, while there were already so many Nassau-Hohenzollern links.\n\nThose were the times....\n\nLast edited: Apr 22, 2014\n\nCory\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nJoined\n\nMar 31, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n4,668\n\nCity\n\nKingdom\n\nCountry\n\nHeard and McDonald Islands\n\nFriday, the 9th of May, at the Central University Library \"Carol I \" of Bucharest a Conference dedicated to the first Hohenzollern King with the title \"Carol I- a Life dedicated to Romania\":\n\nCarol I, o viaţă dedicată României | Historia\n\nDigi 24 spoke about King Carol I:\n\nSPECIAL Digi24.

Why organizing then a 100 years anniversary from her passing away in a place she had never been, in a orthodox church and with no members of the Houses of Wied and Hohenzollern present?\n\nWe have to respect the religious affiliation of each person that passed away. It is normal to have the commemoration of a lutheran Queen in a Lutheran church. Queen Elisabeta had never visited Savarsin and the official residence of the Romanian King is in Bucharest not in Savarson, which is a private residence.\n\nQueen Elisabeta was very proud to be a Hohenzollern but no Prince of Hohenzollern was invited.\n\nCarol I of Hohenzollern was called to the Throne in 1866 to be a Head of State above Romanian politics,factions and families. What can we learn from what happened in 1866?\n\nStill nothing in a Lutheran church for the late Luheran Queen.\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Mar 11, 2016\n\nMAfan\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nSep 14, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n6,401\n\nCity\n\nN/A\n\nCountry\n\nItaly\n\nI suppose that you are referring to the commemoration for the 100th anniversary of the death of Queen Elisabeth of Romania, organized on 18 February by the Romanian Royal Family at the Orthodox Curch of Săvârşin (the royal residence where the Crown Princess and Prince Radu are currently staying):\n\nCentenarul morÈ›ii Reginei Elisabeta a RomÃ¢niei\n\nhttps://translate.google.it/translate?sl=ro&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=it&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.familiaregala.ro%2Fstiri%2Farticol%2Fcentenarul-mortii-reginei-elisabeta-a-romaniei&edit-text=\n\nJust a guess: the commemoration took place in Romania because it was organized by the Romanian Royal Family for a late Queen of Romania; it took place in Săvârșin because the representatives of the Royal Family who attended it are currently residing there.\n\nMAfan\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nSep 14, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n6,401\n\nCity\n\nN/A\n\nCountry\n\nItaly\n\nAfter the memorial celebrated at the Church of Savarsin on 18 February, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of Queen Elisabeth of Romania, on 20 February a concert took place in Bucharest as part of the commemoration.\n\nThe concert was organized by ANRM (National Alliance for the Restoration of the Monarchy) and the Association of Students of the National University of Music of Bucharest, with the support of the National University of Music which hosted the event.\n\nDuring the concert were played musics by Queen Elisabeth's favourite composers (Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Franz Joseph Haydn, Franz Schubert and George Enescu) and were read excerpts from the poems written by the Queen hereself under the pseudonym of Carmen Sylva.\n\nThe concert was attended by Princess Maria of Romania.\n\nConcert extraordinar în memoria Reginei Elisabeta a României | Familia Regală a României / Royal Family of Romania\n\nhttps://translate.google.com/transl...oria-reginei-elisabeta-a-romaniei/&edit-text=\n\nCory\n\nHeir Apparent\n\nJoined\n\nMar 31, 2010\n\nMessages\n\n4,668\n\nCity\n\nKingdom\n\nCountry\n\nHeard and McDonald Islands\n\nIn 2016 there are 150 years of the Hohenzollern Dinasty in Romania.
