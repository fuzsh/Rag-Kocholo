        "text": "Prince Carol of Roumania, heir-apparent to the throne, has forwarded to his father, King Ferdinand I, a letter dated August 1, renouncing his title of Crown Prince and all the rights the Constitution confers upon him as heir to the throne.\n\nIn concluding, Prince Carol, who signs “ex-Prince of Roumania,” says: “I remain the devoted servant of my country and place my sword at its service. I beg your Majesty to give me a post among the soldiers now at the front.”\n\nIt is understood, says the “Matin,” that Prince Carol’s renunciation is due to a love romance, of which the heroine was Mlle. Zizi Lambrino, a beautiful girl belonging to the best Roumanian society, who conquered the Prince’s heart a year ago. Soon after they met, the couple went to Odessa where they were married according to the Russian rite. Efforts have since been made repeatedly to induce the Prince to have the marriage annulled, but he has steadfastly refused. If his renunciation is maintained, Prince Nicholas, a youth of fifteen, becomes the new Crown Prince."
