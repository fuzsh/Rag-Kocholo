        "text": "A hundred years ago, India hosted Crown Prince Carol of Romania for a four-week holiday during April/May 1920. A decade later the Prince would become King Carol II of Romania, and would be described by a historian as “the most cynical, corrupt and power-hungry monarch who ever disgraced a throne anywhere in twentieth-century Europe”. The tale of India extending its hospitality to Prince Carol is little known, whether in India or in Romania. What made India do so?\n\nIn the last two decades of the nineteenth century, Romania (or Rumania as it was spelt then) was ruled by the Prussian born King Carol I. Not having any children of his own, Carol I nominated his nephew, Ferdinand, as the Crown Prince. Ferdinand married Princess Marie of Edinburgh, the granddaughter of Britain’s Queen Victoria from the latter’s second son Alfred, in 1893, and they soon had a son who was also named Carol. For Marie, “a lovely young woman with sparkling blue eyes and silky fair hair”, moving from a repressed and stuffy Victorian England to a Francophile Romania with its vastly liberal sexual mores was an immensely pleasurable change. Moreover, finding her husband Ferdinand wanting in both emotional and physical companionship, the vivacious seventeen-year-old began to have numerous affairs with officials of the court that drew the censure of both her husband and the King. But Marie was made of sterner stuff, and gradually eclipsed her husband both in popularity with the public as well as influencing young Carol. After the death of Carol I in 1914, Ferdinand I became the king. Despite her earlier waywardness, Queen Marie was a much-loved figure in Romania; an exceptionally sensible, brave, and charismatic royal, and the real power behind her timid husband’s throne.\n\nWhile young Carol admired the German militarism and demeanour of his grand uncle, he seemed to have imbibed more of his mother’s lax morals, and became notorious for his insatiable sexual escapades. By the time he was nineteen, he had fathered two illegitimate children through a teenaged schoolgirl. Worldwide newspaper coverage of him dealt more with his wild partying, with a woman in one hand and a drink in the other, than any of his royal duties. During WW-I, Prince Carol served as a Colonel in the army but with little achievement to his credit. He was however more successful in his affair with a Romanian army officer’s daughter, Jeanne ‘Zizi’ Lambrino, a lady described as “not remarkably beautiful but very attractive with a most loveable personality”. Carol and Zizi surreptitiously got married in a Greek Orthodox Church across the border in Odessa on 30 August 1918. Carol’s parents were enraged when news of this came out, and King Ferdinand had his son imprisoned for six weeks for absenting himself from his regiment without leave. Queen Marie, working through her husband, influenced parliament to declare the marriage null and void, since marriage between a member of the royal family and a Romanian local was prohibited by Romania’s policy that allowed only marriage with another comparable non-Romanian royal. The next few months saw all the ingredients of a mega Romeo and Juliet production; Carol first proclaimed that he would give up his throne to be with his beloved, and to show his resolve, had a child with Zizi. Queen Marie, not one to be cowed down with such minor irritants, used a judicious mix of threats, blandishments and tears, and eventually ‘persuaded’ Carol to divorce Zizi and abandon his wife and child. The last scene of the drama included Zizi coming to the palace at Bucharest to plead with Carol but being turned away at gunpoint by a sentry. The salacious gossip this engendered quickly reached a global audience, and the morality of Carol’s action in abandoning his wife for power and pelf was debated from Adelaide to Zurich and everywhere in between.\n\nReaders of P.G. Wodehouse would be familiar with the strategy adopted by the English upper crust in dealing with their offspring getting into uncomfortable alliances. It was to send them to the family castle in the countryside for an extended vacation till the fire of love was extinguished and the heart no longer felt the pain of separation. Queen Marie, more of a blue-blooded firebrand compared to the Wodehousian Lady Constance, was flummoxed, but only fleetingly. She went post-haste to England to meet her first cousin King George V, the ruler of the vast British Empire, and enlisted his help to send Prince Carol on a long around-the-world vacation in the comfortable confines of a British naval ship, since Romania’s navy consisted of little more than a few riverboats. And thus did Prince Carol depart from Romania sometime in March 1920 to explore the world. His long absence would give Queen Marie enough time to ‘arrange’ a suitable wife for him.\n\nPrince Carol’s expedition first took him to Egypt; he then sailed from Port Said to Ceylon, arriving in Colombo on 12 April. Accompanying him were a few Romanian officials, Minister Filoder, Secretary Djuvara, General Gavanescu, Colonel Condiescu, Lt. Col. Condiescu, and Captain Horis. After spending a week in Ceylon, he arrived in Bombay on the afternoon of 20 April on the H.M.S. Caroline. Befitting his status as the Crown Prince of a European power, and a nephew of the King Emperor, the colonial Government in India pulled out its entire ceremonial arsenal to welcome the young prince. To summarise what the Times of India reported the next day, a delegation consisting of the Chief Secretary of Bombay and a few other top officials went to the H.M.S. Caroline and brought ‘His Royal Highness’ ashore on the launch ‘Diamond’. As Carol alighted at Apollo Bunder, a twenty-one-gun salute was given accompanied by the playing of the Romanian national anthem by the King’s Own Scottish Rifles. After being introduced to senior officials of the government, the Prince inspected the guard of honour, and then sat in a motorcar for a short tour of Bombay. The tour took him through Chowpatty, Ridge Road, Gibbs Road, Warden Road, Jacob Circle, and ended at Bori Bunder, where a reception was held in his honour that was graced by the presence of the city’s leading citizens and numerous foreign envoys. After the reception, Carol left for Mahabaleshwar, a nearby hill-station, by a special train that left Victoria Terminus Station at 6–45 p.m. and was seen off by members of the Governor’s Executive Council. The train journey was up to Kirkee (Pune), and the journey to Mahabaleshwar would be resumed the next day after an overnight halt at Kirkee.\n\nIt may not have been very pleasant for Carol to travel through the country with the searing Indian summer on its way, but his itinerary included generous stops in some of the hill stations to stem the perspiration. We know about his travels through the country owing to the diary maintained by (Dr.) Lieutenant Colonel Eugene (Micky) Ryan, who was nominated to be the escort for the Prince along with Lt. Col. Fredrick Marshman Bailey, both of whom accompanied the Prince throughout his journey within India. As Ryan notes in his diary, they had a ‘good dinner’ on the train from Bombay, and the next day (21st) they motored the eighty miles to Mahabaleshwar to the country house of the Governor of Bombay, where Governor George Lloyd and his wife received them. That evening Carol played bridge with Lady Lloyd, Bailey, and Ryan.\n\nAfter a couple of days in Mahabaleshwar, the Prince and his entourage left for Poona on 23rd and boarded a train in the evening at 7.35 pm for Agra. Arriving in Agra in the early morning of the 25th, they were “met at the station by a crowd of flunkeys”, and then drove to the Circuit House for breakfast. The Times of India (TOI) reported that Carol “was delighted with the architectural beauties of Fatepur Sikri” and that “the arrangements made for his reception and sightseeing by the Commissioner and Collector were excellent and pleased him very much.” After seeing the Taj Mahal and Agra Fort in the evening, Carol departed at midnight for Delhi. As the TOI wrote, “The residents of Agra and the suburbs had a novel experience, when they heard a salute of 21 guns booming from the Fort at the stroke of midnight on His Royal Highness’ departure.” Arriving in Delhi at 6.30 am on the 26th, Carol and his team spent two hours seeing the Fort, had breakfast at Alipore Hospital, toured New Delhi in the afternoon, and then left for Patiala at 11 pm that night.\n\nThe Maharaja of Patiala, Sir Bhupinder Singh, was one of India’s richest and most colourful rulers. His collection of Rolls Royce cars, his talent at cricket and polo, and his extravagance at everything else were legendary. He made sure that his hospitality for the prince was in no way found wanting; red carpets and booming guns were omnipresent, and he personally welcomed Carol, and put the entourage up at one of his palaces. The highlight of Carol’s stay at Patiala was a visit to the fort to see the beautiful crown jewels, and a spot of blackbuck shooting after lunch. After spending just a night at Patiala, the team left for Pinjore on 28 April arriving there in the evening. The whole of the next day was spent going through the jungles on elephant back, possibly through what is today called the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. Carol and team left for Simla on 30th, arriving there in the afternoon for what would be the highpoint of their trip.\n\nAt Simla, the Prince, with some of his select officials, was put up at the Viceregal Lodge as guests of the Viceroy Lord Chelmsford and his wife, who had also come to Simla to spend the summer. It was a ritual of colonial days for the entire Viceregal staff and senior bureaucracy to shift from Delhi’s stifling heat to the cooler climes of Simla for the few summer months every year. As to how Carol spent his four days in Simla, one can do no better than quote extracts from the colourful reports filed by TOI’s local correspondent, presumably an English ‘society’ lady herself.\n\n“The presence of His Royal Highness (H.R.H.) Prince Carol of Rumania, combined with a glorious afternoon, resulted in a large and fashionable attendance at the Third Annadale Gymkhana today [1 May]. His Excellency the Viceroy gave a luncheon party in the club grounds to which some thirty guests were invited to meet H.R.H. After luncheon the bolder spirits braved the rays of an extremely hot sun and indulged in a game of mixed cricket in which the Crown Prince took an active part. The gentlemen’s team playing left-handed were unsportsmanlike enough to defeat the ladies by one run.”\n\n“I hear the efforts at talking French at the luncheon were most amusing — one lady was heard to remark to a gallant member of the Crown Prince’s Suite ‘Je ne parle pas beaucoup de Francais mais ham Hindustani accha bolta.’ [I do not speak much of French but I speak Hindustani well.] The combined attractions of the Crown Prince and a cloudless sky enticed a lot of people to Annandale,…But the feminine entries are still disappointing, this was possible due on Saturday to so many of the fairies putting on their best frocks for the benefit of the Crown Prince, which prevented them from doing anything but look pretty in them….”\n\n“I was glad to see Lady Chelmsford attend the delightful dance Their Excellencies gave at Viceregal Lodge on the 3rd to the Royal visitor from Rumania, whose stay in Simla was very fully occupied, as he dined at Snowdon on Saturday, spent Sunday at Mashorba and lunched informally at the United Service Club on Monday [3rd]. At the dance at Viceregal Lodge, H.R.H. did not take the floor but contented himself with conversing with some of our Simla notabilities of both sexes. Supper took place in the Council Chambers which was most tastefully decorated with roses.”\n\nAfter that most invigorating break in his travels, it was back on the train on the 4th, this time towards Kashmir. After alighting at Pindi [Rawalpindi] the next day evening, the party drove and reached Tret [now in Pakistan] at about 7 pm. On the 6th, the party drove the whole day reaching Uri in the evening. The snow capped hills all around by the banks of the Jhelum was a beautiful sight. Spending the night at Uri, Carol and his team left the next day after lunch and drove down to Baramula where they met the Governor, and then proceeded to the capital Srinagar, where the Prince inspected a Guard of Honour of the local soldiers. Carol spent a restful week at Srinagar taking in the beauty of Kashmir; its gardens, hills, lakes, houseboats, and orchards.\n\nThe next few days was a blur of travel — leaving Srinagar on 15th, they retraced their path through Tret and Pindi to reach Delhi on 17th. Carol, pleased with the services of Col. Ryan, presented him with the Order of the Star of Romania. Leaving Delhi the next day, they spent 18th at Benares, and reached Calcutta on 19th, where they stayed at the Grand Hotel for a few days. The royal entourage finally left India from Calcutta on 22 May passing through Penang, Hong Kong and Shanghai to reach Japan in July. Thereafter Carol sailed to the United States, and spent time there before returning to Europe.\n\nThe subsequent story of Carol is well known and I will not belabour the tale. True to her word, Queen Marie found what she believed was the ideal match for her son, Princess Helena of Greece. Both Carol and Helena were second cousins, with a common great grandmother in Queen Victoria. They were married on 10 March 1921.\n\nHowever, Carol found royal women uninteresting; his tastes were more bohemian and he found pleasure only in the company of commoners. Apart from cavorting with prostitutes in Bucharest, he began an affair with Elena (Magda) Lupescu, a married woman who was part Jewish. Owing to the scandal associated with the affair, Carol renounced his right to the throne in 1925 and moved to Paris where Lupescu and he lived together openly. The affair resulted in Helena and Carol divorcing in 1928. However, Carol came back to Romania in 1930, claimed the throne, and became king as Carol II. The decade of his rule was known for his authoritarianism, populism, corruption, and the unpopular presence of Lupescu. Nazi Germany colluded with his political opponents and he was forced to abdicate in favour of his son Michael in 1940. Carol and Lupescu fled to Mexico, and later moved to Portugal where Carol died in 1953.\n\nOne question continues to intrigue me, and I’m hoping some historian is able to shed some light on this. How did Carol, with chastity not being one of his obvious virtues, manage the four weeks in India? Or were there any secret liaisons that may have produced a few whose unknown paternity could be traced to a Romanian prince?\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nSources:"
