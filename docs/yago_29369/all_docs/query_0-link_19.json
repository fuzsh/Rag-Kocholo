        "text": "The Romanian Royal Family, a branch of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen dynasty, has a fascinating history that many foreign tourists are unaware of.\n\nWe have decided to write an article to take you through the history of the Romanian Royal Family. Romania was a constitutional monarchy from 1881 until 1947 when it was proclaimed a socialist republic. But let’s begin from the very start, shall we?\n\nHow Carol I Became the First King of Romania\n\nOn February 23rd, 1866, the Conservatives and radical Liberals forced Alexandru Ioan Cuza, the prince of Moldavia and Wallachia, to abdicate.\n\nAt that time, Romania stood as a principality with Bucharest as its capital.\n\nThis significant event prompted Romanian politicians to initiate a search for a replacement for Alexandru Ioan Cuza.\n\nThe liberals and conservatives jointly determined that, in order to maintain the country’s stability and unity, established in 1859, they must select a foreign prince.\n\nWhen Philip of Flanders declined the offer, liberal leaders Ion C. Brătianu and C.A. Rosetti traveled to Germany, where Carol, the son of Prince Karl Anton Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, accepted their proposal to become the prince of Romania.\n\nThis decision was supported by France, through Napoleon, and also by the King of Prussia.\n\nOn May 10th, 1866, Carol, a member of the Romanian Royal Family, arrived in Bucharest, marking the commencement of Romania’s National Day during the years 1866-1916 and 1918-1947. Although Carol, a German by origin, faced opposition from some due to his foreign heritage, several significant contributions to the nation can be attributed to his rule. His chief achievements encompassed the construction of a vital rail link connecting Fetesti and Cernavoda across the Borcea arm and the Danube, the establishment of a comprehensive railway system, the creation of agricultural credit banks, the expansion and modernization of the military, and the construction of schools, churches, and royal estates.\n\nPath to Independence and Legacy\n\nPrince Carol I played a pivotal role in Romania’s victory in the Independence War against the Ottoman Empire in 1877, as he commanded the troops. Following Romania’s independence, the country proclaimed itself a kingdom in 1881, with Carol I assuming the position of the first king of Romania. Carol I’s reign spanned 48 years, making it the lengthiest reign in Romanian history. He passed away in 1914. He was married to Elisabeth of Wied, who became the queen and was also renowned by her literary name, Carmen Sylva. Regrettably, their sole child, a daughter, passed away before reaching the age of four. In the absence of a male heir, the succession to the throne had to be determined from among Carol’s family members.\n\nFerdinand I: The Second King of Romania and His Role in the Romanian Royal Family\n\nLeopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Carol’s brother, had three sons: Wilhelm, Ferdinand and Karl.\n\nBecause Leopold and Willhelm renounced their succession rights to the throne, Ferdinand, the nephew of King Carol I, became the heir to the throne.\n\nBritish princess Marie of Edinburgh, Queen Victoria’s granddaughter, was his spouse, and they had six children: Carol, Nicolae, Elisabeth, Maria, Ileana, and Mircea.\n\nFerdinand initiated his rule at the onset of World War I, a tumultuous period for Romania. A mere two months prior to King Carol I’s demise, he expressed his desire for Romania to align with Germany at the war’s outset.\n\nAt that time, the Romanians already had a history with the Entente, which consisted of the French Republic, the British Empire, and the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, Carol found himself compelled to embrace a policy of neutrality.\n\nThe Decision to Join the Allies\n\nNonetheless, this represented only a temporary resolution, as Romania was destined to take a side one way or another.\n\nFerdinand I faced mounting pressure, both from the populace and his wife. Marie actively championed the Entente cause, and in the summer of 1916, Ferdinand declared war on Germany and chose to align Romania with the Allied Powers.\n\nRomania lost a lot of people during the war because the army lacked a solid strategy. By 1917, the only territory which was left for them to protect was the region of Moldavia.\n\nAt the end of WWI, Romania became Greater Romania by becoming united with Transylvania, Bukovina, and Bessarabia, which was an outcome not many people believed could happen. It was all due to the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nIn 1922, Ferdinand I and Marie were officially crowned King and Queen of Greater Romania.\n\nFerdinand died in 1927, which meant the throne would go to his eldest son, Carol II. But things got a little complicated.\n\nMichael I’s Ascension to the Romanian Throne at the Age of 6\n\nCarol II, Ferdinand’s son, held the most controversial history within the Romanian Royal Family.\n\nFirst, the Romanian Supreme Court annulled his secret marriage to Zizi Lambrino. Then, external pressure compelled him to wed Greek princess Elena, who gave birth to their son, Michael.\n\nCarol II, eventually, renounced the throne in favor of Elena Lupescu, a socialite with whom he had an affair in the 20s. In 1925, he relocated to Paris with her, and a parliamentary act designated Michael, his son, as the heir to the throne.\n\nThis is the tale of how, following Ferdinand’s demise, Michael ascended to the Romanian throne at the tender age of six.\n\nCarol II, the Third Real King of Romania\n\nBecause Michael was a child at that time, the law required a board of regents to govern the country. Prince Nicholas (Carol II’s brother), Patriarch Miron Cristea, and the first president of the Court of Cassation, Gheorghe Buzdugan, formed this board.\n\nA long regency’s potential impact on the country’s stability prompted a group of politicians to pressure Carol II to return to Romania in 1930.\n\nJune 8th, 1930, Carol II is proclaimed king\n\nHe aggressively approached the democratic system and, in 1938, he established Romania as an absolute monarchy by dissolving the political parties. He also transformed the 1923 Constitution to grant the king more power.\n\nUnder Carol II’s reign, Romania achieved its highest economic development.\n\nNevertheless, the Soviet Union acquired Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania due to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, also known as the Nazi-Soviet Pact.\n\nGeneral Ion Antonescu forced Carol II to abdicate during this period.\n\nAs a result, Michael reclaimed the throne as king once again.\n\nMichael’s Second Reign\n\nAt that time, he was 19 years old and, on the first day, he signed a decree granting General Ion Antonescu full powers to govern the country. As previously mentioned, the king had to attain maturity of both mind and age to participate in political affairs.\n\nAdditionally, Antonescu held the belief that Michael lacked the necessary experience to make decisions during wartime, which prompted him to seize control.\n\nIn 1941, Romania declared war on the Soviet Union to reclaim Bessarabia. By 1944, King Michael I sought to negotiate peace with the Allies due to the inevitability of Soviet conquest.\n\nHe initiated a coup against Antonescu, resulting in his arrest. Despite Michael’s attempts to reinstate democratic rule in Romania, he proved unable to do so because of the stronger presence of the Communist Party.\n\nIn 1945, the king was forced by the Soviet Union to appoint a government ruled by Petru Groza. Michael remained more of a figurehead until the end of his reign.\n\nBecause the communists gained enough power, they were able to force the king to abdicate and leave the country.\n\nMichael I’s Forced Abdication by Communists\n\nIn November 1947, he traveled to London for a wedding and met his wife, Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma. Although he was offered asylum, he declined and returned to Romania.\n\nHowever, on December 30th, Petru Groza summoned him to Bucharest. Upon his arrival, troops surrounded the Elisabeta Palace in Bucharest, and Groza and Communist Party leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej were waiting for him.\n\nAt that moment, Michael was compelled to abdicate as they held a gun to his head. The communists also issued threats, stating that the 1,000 students they had in prison would die if he refused, and they would order a bloodbath.\n\nFollowing his exile, he married Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma in Athens and had five daughters.\n\nKing Michael I was finally allowed to return to Romania\n\nIn 1990, the people removed the communists from power, and King Michael came to Romania to visit his family’s tomb. However, authorities stopped him on the highway and compelled him to leave the country.\n\nIt was only in 1997 that Emil Constantinescu, the president at that time, allowed Michael to return to the country by granting him Romanian citizenship and reinstating his visa.\n\nMichael, the last king of the Romanian royal family, passed away on December 5th, 2017, at his residence in Switzerland at the age of 96.\n\nNow, let’s explore the royal family’s residences over the years, which have since become popular tourist attractions steeped in history.\n\nElisabeta Palace. This is the official residence and it’s located in Bucharest.\n\nThe Royal Domain of Sinaia. It includes Peles Castle, Pelisor Castle, Foisor Castle, a royal sheepfold, and a large forest area.\n\nCotroceni Palace. Today, it serves as the official residence of the President of Romania.\n\nBran Castle. In 1920, it was gifted to Queen Marie of Romania by Brasov’s Town Council.\n\nBalchik Palace. This is located in Bulgaria and it was the summer residence of Queen Marie.\n\nThousands of eager tourists visit these attractions every year to learn more about the history of the Romanian royal family.
