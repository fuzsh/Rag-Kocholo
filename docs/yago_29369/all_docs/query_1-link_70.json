There is always a story to be told from under the yellowed pages of the past, and it is uplifting to understand how our ancestors lived and how far we’ve come, but even more beautiful is to find the people and their souls behind the title. And this is what my article is about.\n\nElisabeth of Wied was a German princess who married Prince Carol of Romania, also a German prince, born as Prince Karl of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Carol (Karl) was the Prince Carol of Romania between 1866 and 1881 and King of Romania from 1881 when Romania was proclaimed a kingdom until he died in 1914.\n\nElisabeth married Carol in 1869 and in 1881 when Carl became King she received the title of Queen. They had one child, a daughter who died at age 4 and Elisabeth will never recover from this loss."
