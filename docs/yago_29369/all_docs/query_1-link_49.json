She was the daughter of Hermann, Prince of Wied, and his wife Princess Marie of Nassau.\n\t\n\tAs a young girl, sixteen-year-old Elisabeth was considered as a possible bride for Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom). \n\t\n\tIn 1869 she married Prince Carol of Romania.  Their only child, a daughter, Maria, died in 1874 at age three — an event from which Elisabeth never recovered. She was crowned Queen of Romania in 1881 after Romania was proclaimed a kingdom.\n\t\n\tIn the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 she devoted herself to the care of the wounded, and founded the Order of Elizabeth (a gold cross on a blue ribbon) to reward distinguished service in such work. She fostered the higher education of women in Romania, and established societies for various charitable objects.\n\t\n\tIn 1881, due to the lack of heirs to the Romanian throne, King Carol I adopted his nephew, Ferdinand. Ferdinand, became very close to one of Elisabeth's ladies in waiting Elena Văcărescu. Elisabeth, very close to Elena herself, encouraged the romance even though she knew nothing could come of it. \n\t\n\tThe result was Elisabeth was exiled to  Neuwied, Germany.  \n\t\n\tAccording to notes she made in her diary, Elisabeth was more in favour of a Republican form of government than a monarchy.  \n\t\n\tElisabeth died at Curtea de Argeș  in 1916.",
