        "text": "Clarke's literary began in the late 1930's when he had multiple stories published in various fanzines. However, his first professional sales did not come until 1946 when his stories Loophole and Rescue Party were published in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction. A streak of his most famous works began in 1968 when his novel, 2001: A Space Odyssey was released. It was developed concurrently with Stanley Kubrick's eponymous film, and today both are considered classics of the science fiction genre. Four years later, Clarke published Rendezvous with Rama followed by The Fountains of Paradise in 1979, both considered to be among his best work.\n\nClarke's influence in the science fiction genre has become increasingly far reaching over the years. Most notable was his mostly consistent vision of the future, usually envisioned as a Utopian society with highly developed technology, ecology and society."
