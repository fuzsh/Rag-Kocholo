        "text": "Giant among imaginative promoters of the ideas of interplanetary travel, the colonising by man of nearby planets and the urgent need for peaceful exploration of outer space, Sir Arthur C Clarke, who has died aged 90, was pre-eminent because of his hard and accurate predictions of the detailed technologies of spaceflight and of the use of near-earth space for global communications. Yet, in spite of Clarke's deep seriousness, JB Priestley described him in the 1950's as the happiest writer he had ever known.\n\nTallish, bespectacled, rather big-eared and increasingly thin on top, he tended to be described by his friends as a beaming and highly articulate shambles of a chap, a man to whom convention meant very little. Yet his mind was like a razor. Unlike earlier writers on space travel, his imagination and creativity sprang, not from fantasy, but from sharp scientific and technical insight, unfettered by the arbitrary limitations of the perceptions of his time. Clarke's amazing career was possible largely because he was never, in any ordinary sense, quite a part of this world. Indeed he chose to live in Sri Lanka, to some extent at least, because it helped him neutralise the influence of western culture.\n\nAs he approached 80, it seemed that he had done almost everything that was possible in a single lifetime, for he had written dozens of books, plumbed the depths of the Indian Ocean, carried the imagination of mankind to the remotest parts of the galaxy, and gained honours in every corner of the globe. But he then declared that one of his many remaining ambitions was to observe the meeting of alien intelligence with the intelligence on earth, a declaration he qualified by adding with his usual smile - \"if there is true intelligence on earth\".\n\nThe great American astronomer Carl Sagan, no less interested in alien intelligence, replied rapidly, if informally, that the existence of Arthur C Clarke was proof enough. Sagan was one of the many teenagers whose lives, in the years immediately after the second world war, were profoundly changed by Clarke's non-fiction book Interplanetary Flight. This did more than spell out the technical case for spaceflight as a close and exciting reality: it embraced aspects of a new philosophy - in many ways Clarke's lifelong philosophy - that sprang from the perceived and enormous spiritual need for exploratory adventures of a new kind which, by their magnitude and imagination, might pull and hold mankind together.\n\nWritten in 1949 and quickly published on both sides of the Atlantic, it was unique. The text, uncluttered by equations, is aimed at the general reader; yet all the relevant mathematics are gathered in an appendix. The arguments are clear and accessible.\n\nSagan says he found it modest, beautifully written, and stirring. \"Most striking for me was the discussion of gravitational potential wells and the use in the appendices of differential and integral calculus to calculate propulsion requirements, staging and interplanetary trajectories. The calculus, it dawned on me, could be used for important things, not just to intimidate high school students. Interplanetary Flight was a turning point in my scientific development.\"\n\nThe turning point in Clarke's career came slightly later with the publication in 1952 of The Exploration of Space, a non-fiction work which nevertheless became a best seller on both sides of the Atlantic. As a writer he was made.\n\nClarke's stature and impact was probably greater than he could have imagined at that time: it has certainly been far greater than that accorded by popular acclaim, for he was highly and, sometimes, effectively critical of the limitations and military basis of the world's major space programmes. He was bitterly critical of the 1980s concept of Star Wars and, well before this emerged as US policy, sent a personal message of appeal from his Physics and Space Institute in Sri Lanka to the US Congress. His video statement A Martian Odyssey, which was read into the congressional record, argued that money being spent on intercontinental ballistic missiles could, to everyone's benefit, be imaginatively channelled into an international space voyage to Mars to mark the 500th anniversary of the voyage of Columbus in search of the Americas in 1492. He did not predict an end to the cold war, but he always sought and fought for new bridges between cultures.\n\nThis underlying seriousness led him to view his creative participation in commercial, if poetic, other-worldly enterprises, such as the film of his book 2001: a Space Odyssey, as a kind of scenario writing, not to be taken as an example of his central work. In this, however, many would disagree, for 2001 (\"a glorified screenplay\" according to Clarke) was in many ways so accurate and convincing that Alexei Leonov, the first spacewalking human, said that he felt that it had carried him into space again.\n\nThe film director Stanley Kubrick held the view that Clarke's ability was unique. \"He has the kind of mind of which the world can never have enough, a composite of imagination, intelligence and knowledge that is driven by great energy and a quirkish and unceasing curiosity.\" In this Kubrick summarised the qualities of all great explorers.\n\nInevitably, since he was slightly unhappy about both the book and the film, Clarke extended 2001: a Space Odyssey into a loosely linked trilogy - 2010: Odyssey 2 and 2061: Odyssey 3. Commenting on these books, Clarke said emphatically that \"2010 is better than 2001, but 2061 is the best.\" Eventually this may prove to be right, but in the sense of timing and public acceptance, 2001 rode space enthusiasm at its height.\n\nStrangely, out of his huge corpus of non-fiction books, novels, short stories, plays, films, TV series and anthologies (the 1992 Official Biography lists 137 separate titles) Clarke had a special affection for his interstellar novel The Songs of Distant Earth. With its context and action entirely removed from and remote from Earth, it is the first of a new genre.\n\nAlthough not completed until 1985, Clarke had worked on it, directly and indirectly, for over 30 years. It was the novel in which Clarke finally shook the last vestiges of earthly soil from his imagination, freeing his curiosity to probe the deepest recesses of the universe and allowing him to isolate and examine human relationships and emotions. Some might say that it was here, in the vastness and extraordinary beauty of space, that after a lifetime of confinement by technology Clarke finally rediscovered his own humanity.\n\nThis was evident at this time by his increasing belief in the use of communications to bring mankind together in what he called the \"global village\". His lifetime thoughts on this were gathered in 1992 into a collection of ideas and idealistic possible futures published under the title How the World was One: Beyond the Global Village, a dream that satellite communications would promote understanding and worldwide peace.\n\nBy this time, however, it was clear that, as with any other technology, the effect of communication satellites depends entirely on their manner of use. The coverage of the Falklands campaign of 1982 and Operation Desert Storm, the American-led liberation of Kuwait from Iraq of 1990-91, showed clearly that global TV, rather than bringing mankind together in peace, can transform the horror of war into exciting and technically interesting family entertainment.\n\nIt was never evident that this reality soured the dreams that had driven Clarke for eight decades, for he never lost either his smile or his enthusiasm. Born in Minehead, Somerset, during the final appalling battles of the first world war, in which his father suffered injuries that brought him to an early death 13 years later, Clarke went to Huish's grammar school, Taunton, and, at 19, into the civil service in London. His father was a telephone engineer who, disastrously, turned to farming after the war because of lung damage, and his mother Nora (Willis) was formerly a telegraphist. His was a communications family.\n\nLike many schoolboys at this time, Clarke became fascinated by American science-fiction magazines ,which reached Britain in bulk, probably as scrap-paper ballast in returning cargo ships. But as Clarke later wrote, the turning point of his life was the discovery, shortly before his father died, of W Olaf Stapleton's book Last and First Men. Its imagination, timescale of billions of years and grand perception of the scale of the universe, provided a cosmic framework large enough to set Clarke's imagination free. He began writing science fiction.\n\nAt 17 he joined the British Interplanetary Society, an organisation then widely regarded as crackpot, but of which he was later to be treasurer and, eventually, chairman.\n\nIn the civil service his mathematical ability took him into the audit branch. But, after the outbreak of the second world war, he opted to join the RAF where, via electronics training, he became an instructor at radio school. Finally he went to work on the development and proving of American ground control approach - talk-down - radar at Davidstow Moor in north Cornwall, a system which pilots never liked because it robbed them of control until the last moments.\n\nThe head of the US team was Nobel-prizewinning physicist Luis W Alvarez - the first high-level scientist with whom Clarke had worked. As he described obliquely in his book Glide Path (1963), his only non-science fiction novel, this period shaped his decision to turn to science.\n\nIn 1945 he published his famous pioneering paper on the possibility and technical potential of geosynchronous satellite orbits in global and interplanetary communications. He went on to gain a first in physics and mathematics at King's College London, and then a postgraduate degree in astronomy. The course was so boring that he became assistant editor on Science Abstracts, so that he would have time to think and to write.\n\nThe rest is almost a legend of our time. In 1953, on a US tour and with success already evident, he had a whirlwind romance with Marilyn Mayfield, a very young and beautiful divorcee who described the then bearded and buccaneering Clarke as her own Errol Flynn. A decade later, as Clarke chose the Sri Lankan culture as his working environment, the marriage was dissolved. Clarke's energy and momentum was at its height, taking him to the depths of the Indian Ocean and to every forum in the world where missiles and spaceflight were an issue. Clarke unwaveringly spoke for collaboration and peace. His last years were, increasingly, limited: post-polio syndrome left him confined to his wheelchair, and much of his public contact with the wider world was by telephone and then videolink. He was often - almost always by television link - one of the celebrities exploited by Nasa and other agencies to mark great moments in the exploration of space.\n\nBut he remained unsentimental, and with a cheerful capacity for sending himself up: having lent his name to books and television programmes that explored the unlikely, the downright improbable and the decidedly dotty end of New Age speculation, he was once asked for his views on corn circles, those unexpected patterns that appeared suddenly, like eczema, in the wheat and barley fields of southern England, to be interpreted by New Age enthusiasts as messages from alien civilizations. \"I do have a theory,\" he volunteered at a Science Museum press conference, on one of his rare visits. \"They were made by half-witted extraterrestrials.\"\n\nHis confinement and his age seemed not to trouble him, but in 1998 a British newspaper printed claims that Sir Arthur - his knighthood had just been announced - had been involved in sexual predation upon the young. He refused to accept his honour until the Sri Lankan authorities had investigated, and cleared his name. His knighthood was then awarded by Prince Charles on a visit to Sri Lanka in 2000.\n\nApart from his huge output of fiction and scientific books, Clarke left us his Three Laws. These are touched by the kind of eternal practicality which make his science fiction so effective and reveal his inner convictions:\n\n1. When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\n\n2. The limits of the possible can only be found by going beyond them into the impossible.\n\n3. Any sufficiently advanced technology may, at first, be indistinguishable from magic.\n\nCertainly, Clarke's imagination was magical, carrying him beyond the limits of possibility: his greatness was and remains that, from his almost Olympian heights, he could see more than ordinary men will ever see. Moreover, he possessed the power to carry anyone who wished to join him on these great heights of mystery and clarity. If the world believes the clarity to be deceptive, it is not the fault of Arthur C Clarke.\n\n· This obituary has been updated since Anthony Tucker's death in 1998"
