1Had we but world enough and time,

2This coyness, lady, were no crime.

3We would sit down, and think which way

4To walk, and pass our long love’s day.

5Thou by the Indian Ganges’ side

6Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide

7Of Humber would complain. I would

8Love you ten years before the flood,

9And you should, if you please, refuse

10Till the conversion of the Jews.

11My vegetable love should grow

12Vaster than empires and more slow;

13An hundred years should go to praise

14Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;

15Two hundred to adore each breast,

16But thirty thousand to the rest;

17An age at least to every part,

18And the last age should show your heart.

19For, lady, you deserve this state,

20Nor would I love at lower rate.

21 But at my back I always hear

22Time’s wingèd chariot hurrying near;

23And yonder all before us lie

24Deserts of vast eternity.

25Thy beauty shall no more be found;

26Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound

27My echoing song; then worms shall try

28That long-preserved virginity,

29And your quaint honour turn to dust,

30And into ashes all my lust;

31The grave’s a fine and private place,

32But none, I think, do there embrace.

33 Now therefore, while the youthful hue

34Sits on thy skin like morning dew,

35And while thy willing soul transpires

36At every pore with instant fires,

37Now let us sport us while we may,

38And now, like amorous birds of prey,

39Rather at once our time devour

40Than languish in his slow-chapped power.

41Let us roll all our strength and all

42Our sweetness up into one ball,

43And tear our pleasures with rough strife

44Through the iron gates of life:

45Thus, though we cannot make our sun

46Stand still, yet we will make him run.
