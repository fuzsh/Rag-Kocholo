        "text": "Journalist, author, and editor Sarah Weinman has been a staple in crime, mystery, thriller fiction, and true crime circles for well over a decade, writing for everything from Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine and Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine to The Atlantic and currently, the monthly Crime & Mystery column for The New York Times Book Review. Weinman’s 2022 book Scoundrel was met with all sorts of acclaim, and she’s a National Magazine Award finalist for reporting — and it’s clear to see why she’s one of the foremost authorities on true crime currently working.\n\nHer latest anthology, Evidence of Things Seen: True Crime in an Era of Reckoning, follows in the footsteps of her hit 2020 collection Unspeakable Acts: True Tales of Crime, Murder, Deceit, and Obsession but takes the concept a step further with 14 top-notch true crime essays (from heavy hitters like Wesley Lowery, Amanda Knox, Lara Bazelon, and Justine van der Leun) and an introduction by Rabia Chaudry that firmly dissect the virtues and downfalls of true crime. Covering different aspects that, in one way or another, encompass true crime, including equality, domestic violence, Indigenous women, white-collar crime, and much more, Evidence of Things Seen is an excellent and important collection that shines a light on this complicated obsession.\n\nShondaland sat down with Weinman recently to discuss the collection, how it grew from her work on Unspeakable Acts, how the true crime genre has changed, and so much more.\n\nSCOTT NEUMYER: After the success of Unspeakable Acts, did you know you were going to do another true crime anthology? This kind of feels like a spiritual and logical sequel to that book in many ways.\n\nSARAH WEINMAN: It could be seen as a sequel. I sort of see it as it’s continuing the conversation that started with Unspeakable Acts.\n\nThere were a number of reasons why I did that original anthology. One was a long time ago, there used to be an annual series called The Best American Crime Reporting, and it republished a lot of great crime journalism, but it also reflected what were the main problems with crime journalism at the time, which was that it was predominantly written by white guys. And I think that especially in the ongoing true crime moment that we have been in — particularly since the massive phenomenon that was the first season of Serial in the fall of 2014 — and now that we are getting crime journalism, and essays and nonfiction, and all sorts of different entertainment that is by non-white guys, people of color, people from marginalized communities, you name it, and the fact that we have such a heterogenous pool of people and stories and things that need saying, it’s just better for everyone. I’m also personally much more interested in it than just having a very narrow slice of what society might offer just through one particular vantage point, even though whiteness is a phenomenon, and whiteness as a construct is of great interest to me, because that’s also part of all this.\n\nSo, Unspeakable Acts is essentially an anthology as argument, which is: What does true crime look like in the aftermath as things have been changing in the genre, and the fact that it’s become more participatory, that it’s broadening what we even think of as true crime? The third section of that anthology really was trying to interrogate what the genre actually is, and I’ve always been of the vantage point that you have to be as expansive as possible in thinking about it. So, that anthology did well, which I was very happy with. And people seem to really respond to the argument that I was making but also to the pieces themselves, because I wanted to reprint the best pieces that I thought were out there.\n\nSo, I knew that I wanted to do a follow-up, but I also knew that I couldn’t do it unless I had a different argument to make with it. With Evidence of Things Seen, I think it’s clear from the title itself that it is a callback to James Baldwin’s amazing, profoundly misunderstood at the time, late-career essay, published as a book, The Evidence of Things Not Seen. I felt like because things were continuing to change in the ongoingness of the pandemic, the protests that resulted from the murder of George Floyd, the fact that there were just so many police shootings, so many mass shootings, so much turmoil and chaos, that just doing a traditional true crime anthology didn’t feel like it was doing justice to what was actually being produced.\n\nSo, that’s a really long-winded way of saying that I wanted to create another argument. I wanted to extend the third section of Unspeakable Acts — which is “What even is true crime?” — and also interrogate the people who are doing it, the stories that we tell, and whether we can even have any kind of justice. And is the criminal legal system the best avenue for pursuing that?\n\nBut being investigatory with a mind to figuring out quality information, whether it’s about true crime or anything, is a skill that we all desperately need to have, maintain, and nurture.\n\nSN: It does feel like there’s a much broader social angle to this book than Unspeakable Acts and in a very logical way, because that’s where we’ve come over the past few years. I think it’s interesting that you bring up The Best American Crime Reporting series because that was literally in my next question. This book really feels like an extension of that now-defunct series. Is that kind of the vision for this? Do you think you’ll continue?\n\nSW: Kind of in that vein, sure. And that’s less about whether excellent crime writing is still being made — it’s always going to be produced, and I’m always on the lookout for the best work. Just the other day, I was reading a piece by McKay Coppins, reporter for The Atlantic, who went to Moscow, Idaho, where the Idaho murders took place, and the crux of his piece was about how the town has essentially been ruined, emotionally and psychologically, by the swarm not only by, quote, “regular journalists” who descended upon the town but also the “Reddit sleuths,” amateur journalists, TikTokers. There’s a really compelling paragraph in which Coppins describes how he’s trying to just do journalism, but no one is going to talk, and people leave him notes and say, “We’re never talking to journalists again.” And I’m thinking, “Yeah, I mean, we have a lot to answer for in our profession in terms of how we turn trauma and pain into entertainment,” but also to just get away from rigorous reporting and trying to be empathetic. I’ve had to change a lot of my own approaches to true crime reporting in the years that I’ve done it. I go back and forth between, you know, crossing my fingers when I’m trying to cold-call the source, thinking this might be the last time I ever speak with them, to maybe having a couple of off-the-record conversations and meeting them in person and just sort of taking their temperature and seeing where they’re at.\n\nAnd I’m sure that there are wonderful reporters out there who also struggle with the fact that they want everybody represented, but it’s their story. It’s their life. We just come in and swoop in and do the thing, and maybe we’ll spend a few years if we’re writing a book or working on a documentary or a project, and then we leave, but they’re still sifting through the wreckage of their lives because they lost a loved one, or they’re in the midst of ongoing violence. I just always want to be mindful and responsible, and never want to forget that I’m coming in as an outsider.\n\nSN: What is your process like for selection and inclusion in the anthology? Do you find the overall theme first, and then work from there?\n\nSW: After Unspeakable Acts came out, I thought through whether another anthology could work, and I came up with the idea. At the time, the original subtitle was something like True Crime in Protest and Pandemic, and we knew that that had to change because ultimately there wasn’t a piece about true crime and the pandemic that felt like it really fit. And because it was almost like the thing that seeped into everything, that there was a way to just sort of call out to it but not hammer the nail on the head. And with the protests [aspect], I think that was really a way of dealing with systemic racism.\n\nIn the back matter of Evidence of Things Seen, as with Unspeakable Acts, I have a whole list of notable pieces, and that’s essentially from my original Google doc of pieces and the links that I was collecting as I was putting this anthology together. I knew that I wanted to keep it to 13 or 14 pieces — it ended up at 14 overall — and I wanted it to be in three sections. I wanted the first section to essentially be what we’re reckoning with right now. I knew that Wesley Lowery’s piece on the 1980s lynching needed to be the lead piece because it resonated with what was going on today. It was a reminder that America was still lynching people later than we might think, and maybe still [is]. And also, he’s just such a phenomenal writer and reporter of his own. His book, American Whitelash, is coming out in a couple of weeks, as we’re speaking [Editor’s note: It was released on June 27]. So, he’s clearly doing the work and is somebody who I think will be doing that for his entire career, his entire life, but I also wanted to find a piece about missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.\n\nI read this National Geographic piece by the Canadian writer Brandi Morin, who I had heard of to some degree, but the more that I was familiarizing myself with her work — she also wrote a memoir that came out last year that was wonderful and harrowing — the more I thought that she’s just somebody who really embodies what it is to report on a community that you are a part of or in sync with in a way that being a parachuting outsider cannot convey.\n\nI wanted a piece about what domestic abuse does in terms of creating perpetrators out of victims, which was the piece that Justine van der Leun wrote that was originally published in The New Republic. I wanted a piece on white-collar crime because I felt like that was getting at certain truths and certain cynicism and nihilism in America in particular, and Michael Hobbes, who most people would know as sort of the podcaster extraordinaire. I felt like he really got at why rich, rich people keep getting away with things because the federal government just keeps failing at convicting them. And now that a former president is under indictment federally, this feels even more relevant.\n\nSN: One of the curious aspects of the book for me is the way that it almost contradicts itself at times while showing this broad gamut of the true crime writing that’s out there. In the intro, for instance, you have Rabia Chaudry talking about how essential true crime is to saving lives and exonerating the wrongly accused. On the other hand, you have a piece like Amanda Knox’s, where it talks about how harmful true crime (and the media’s obsession with it) can be for a lot of people. Was it important for you to be able to tell both sides of that story in a book with varied pieces?\n\nSW: So to answer that, I think it’s worth getting into why I wanted Rabia to write the introduction. Obviously, I’ve been aware of her for many years, since the first season of Serial. Then she went on and co-hosted Undisclosed with Susan Simpson and Colin Miller. There was the HBO documentary she wrote called Adnan’s Story. She wrote her own memoir. She’s working it in the best way. But we were matched up in a podcast called The Argument, which I think no longer exists, that was hosted by Jane Coaston. The producer had reached out and said, “We really want to do a podcast on true crime and the ethics of it and whether it’s harmful or it’s good.” And I said, “I think it’s a much more nuanced discussion because I think it’s both, right? But I think you’d have to find a way to sort of talk about how it’s harmful and how it’s good. It’s kind of like how you can be a victim and a perpetrator; you can do good and cause harm. And just be mindful that all you can do is try to be better and not f--k up massively. Tell the truth. Don’t make things up. Be empathetic. Try not to traumatize people. But also, a lot this participatory stuff does lead to promising leads and may result in changes. Creating a true crime podcast can cause real harm. It can also lead to, for instance in the Kristin Smart case, a long-term suspect finally getting arrested. Because this podcast did the work.”\n\nSo, all of that was encompassed in the conversation Rabia and I had then. And so, when it came time to find somebody to write the intro, I was like, “Oh, I’ve got to ask her to do it.” So, I felt like what she said, what I said, and what the pieces would say, yes, in a way they might contradict each other, but that’s the messiness. True crime is a contradictory genre. It’s an expansive genre. Hopefully, it’s a more inclusive one. It goes back to the whole [idea that] if you ask questions, you might not arrive at answers that fit in with the questions we’ve been asked in the first place.\n\nSN: That’s what’s most intriguing to me. The genre is an open conversation in a way, and it always has been. Do you feel like the way that the true crime genre has changed over the past few years is a more negative or more positive change?\n\nSW: I think that with positive change comes backlash. We see that in every arena possible. So, why shouldn’t true crime also have that going on? So, when there has been a move to be more inclusive and reflect marginalized communities, then we see a backlash of “Well, we only want what’s salacious.” And “Should we do like the 12th Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer thing and just do what sells?” So, with the prestige comes the dreck. And with the people who don’t really care whether they get facts right comes the rigorous journalism that is incredibly expensive but also leads to Supreme Court decisions that overturned Curtis Flowers’ conviction because of the work that In the Dark season two did.\n\nAnd yet, true crime is also bound up in additional forces like capitalism, corporatism, the decline of local journalism, that the need for increased profits is squeezing out the substance of stuff, so people who were doing great work at certain digital media properties are now out of work. So, you can’t really divorce true crime from all of those other forces, just like you can’t divorce crime journalism from larger societal issues like mental health and whether you’re housed or unhoused, the pandemic, far-right extremism, and conspiracy theories. So, that’s why when I’ve seen people get upset when they think, “Wait, I thought that true crime was this.” True crime is whatever you want it to be, but you should still try to make it better.\n\nSN: I suppose then the question is how can we, as fans and readers and journalists, parse what’s good and what’s bad?\n\nSW: It’s very difficult, but it’s always been difficult to separate wheat from chaff, especially with respect to quality. And I think, unfortunately, the best answer I have is not a good one, which is just it’s actually doing the work. It’s actually sitting down and sifting through and trying to figure out “Okay, why does this documentary feel like it’s from an agenda? Who are these people? How do I look it up?,” which. of course, is now even more difficult as looking things up becomes AI garbage, and social media is breaking. So, I don’t know. I mean, I know because I tried to do it for myself, but I think there’s no quick answer for how to arrive at that. And I don’t want to say, “Do your own research,” because we know that that phrase is found in conspiracy-theory stuff. But being investigatory with a mind to figuring out quality information, whether it’s about true crime or anything, is a skill that we all desperately need to have, maintain, and nurture.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nScott Neumyer is a writer from central New Jersey whose work has been published by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Rolling Stone, The Wall Street Journal, ESPN, GQ, Esquire, The Boston Globe, AARP, Parade magazine, and many more publications.
