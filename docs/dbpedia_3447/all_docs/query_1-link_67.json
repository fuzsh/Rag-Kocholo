        "text": "Kathy and Stella Solve a Murder! has been hailed a “deliciously bonkers musical that deserves to be a hit’ (Time Out), “irresistible” (The Spectator) and “bloody good fun” (Radio Times).\n\n“Bronté Barbé and Rebekah Hinds have terrific chemistry” (Broadway World) and the whole “cast is fricking fabulous.” (Sunday Times). This “certified homicidal hoot” (WhatsonStage) is produced by the multi-Olivier Award-winners behind Fleabag, Baby Reindeer and The 39 Steps, and created by visionaries Jon Brittain (Rotterdam), Matthew Floyd Jones (Frisky and Mannish) and Fabian Aloise (Sunset Boulevard).\n\n“If you like Only Murders in the Building — you’ll have plenty of fun here. No coercion needed” (Sunday Times)\n\nThis ‘delightful comedy musical’ (Financial Times) follows BFFs Kathy and Stella who host Hull’s least successful true-crime podcast. When their favourite author is killed they are thrust into a thrilling whodunnit of their own, serving “Rock’n’roll escapism that capitalises on our collective fixation with true crime.” (The Stage)\n\nThe award-winning musical comedy is playing a Strictly Limited Season until 14 September at Ambassadors Theatre so run don’t walk to get your tickets."
