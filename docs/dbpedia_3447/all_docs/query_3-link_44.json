        "text": "How many words are in a novel? Any work with 40,000 words or more can be considered a fully developed novel. But this differs by genre — the average word count ranges from 58,000 words in erotica to 109,000 for fantasy works.\n\nHowever, some authors have more questions or even doubts about these numbers. When writing a work of fiction, considering the word count can feel like limiting the creative process. No one wants to feel like their compelling story is constrained by a number.\n\nWhat first-time authors may not know is that the right word count can:\n\nImprove your chances at a publishing deal\n\nMake your work more attractive to readers\n\nInform your book’s price point\n\nFor these reasons and more, it's wise to have some context for how long most novels in your genre tend to be. Finding the word count sweet spot for your genre can propel your book to publishing.\n\nLinks in this article may earn me a small commission if you use them to purchase a product.

It helps me continue to write these handy articles that anyone can read for free!\n\nWhy is word count important?\n\nWord counts are helpful guidelines that can improve your book’s chances of being read. Here are the top 3 reasons that your novel word count is important:\n\nA novel’s word count can make or break book deals. If you are an author seeking a traditional publishing route, you know that literary agents see copious amounts of manuscripts, and competition is fierce. Just one misstep can put you out of the running. Even a high-quality manuscript will be passed over if it’s twice the expected word count. Though there are no hard and fast rules, traditional publishers usually won’t take on the first novel with over 100,000 words from a new author.\n\nWord count can affect readers’ impressions. Readers tend to be experts in the genres they love. They’ve read dozens of their favorite types of novels, and they have expectations when they look up your title. If your book doesn’t fit their expectations for length, whether too long or too short, they might pass it over.\n\nThe number of words often determines how much your book costs. Novellas, which typically contain under 40,000 words, are usually sold at a lower price point than a full-fledged novel.\n\nYour word count affects the opinion of both publishing houses and readers, not to mention establishing your price point.\n\nHowever, the broad category of novels is full of sub-genres, so it’s essential to know exactly what word count is best for your book.\n\nSpeaking of manuscripts, I’m a big fan of Scrivener after reviewing it myself, and I even have a discount for you if you want to use it for writing your novel.\n\nWord Count: Novel vs. Novella\n\nOne commonly asked question: Are 40,000 words enough for a novel? 40,000 words are usually not enough for a novel. The average book needs to be around 50,000 words to be considered marketable. This may be disheartening for authors of shorter works.\n\nHowever, there are other genres available for books with a lower word count range. Let’s take a look at categories of books that contain fewer than 40,000 words.\n\nNovel: 40,000+ words (though you’re better off above 50,000 words)\n\nNovella: 17,500-40,000 words\n\nNovelette: 7,500-20,000 words\n\nShort story: 1,000-10,000 words\n\nFlash fiction: 1-1,000 words\n\nThere’s a market for shorter books, but you can help your pitch by using the proper term for your manuscript’s length.\n\nWord Count: Adult vs. Young Adult\n\nThe reader’s age is a pivotal factor to consider when determining the best word count for your novel. Conventionally, the younger the audience, the shorter the recommended length.\n\nHere are the best word counts for a YA novel to children’s books:\n\nAdult fiction: 50,000+ words\n\nYoung adult: 45,000+ words, but ideally not over 80,000 words\n\nMiddle grade: 22,000+ words, usually not more than 60,000 words\n\nFirst chapter book: from 5,000+ words up to about 20,000 words\n\nEarly reader: 1,000+ words\n\nPicture book: 250–750 words\n\nBoard book: 25–200 words\n\nIt’s important to meet your reader where they are developmentally and in terms of attention span with your novel word count and content. Remember your audience.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nNo matter the age you’re writing for, you can benefit from some of our favorite book writing tools here at Kindlepreneur.\n\nHow long are novels by genre?\n\nAs we’ve seen, the genre of a novel can determine its length. Sci-fi novels top out at 377,000 words, while short stories live up to their name, averaging 30,000 words.\n\nHow many words is a typical novel? A typical novel is around 90,000 words. For reference, the average non-fiction book is only 50,000-75,000.\n\nThough some authors far exceed this estimate, like J.K. Rowling or George R. R. Martin, their colossal fanbases predated their lengthiest works.\n\nFor a first book, it’s best to stay around the ideal word count for specific genres.\n\nThe books in the following graphic came from both publishing houses and self-published authors on Amazon. The data were averaged based on Amazon's Top 100 Best-selling books in each genre.\n\nTo keep the average novel word counts accurate, outlier books, box sets, anthologies, and omnibuses were removed. Blue segments represent 25% of the genre, and the orange section signifies 50% of the books in each category.\n\nThe number of words in novels from the top 15 Amazon Kindle categories, according to our extensive in-house research, were:\n\nFantasy: 109,000 words on average (range 27,000-318,000)\n\nHistorical fiction: 102,000 words on average (range 6,000 to 223,000)\n\nHorror: 102,000 words on average (range 19,000-377,000)\n\nGenre fiction: 99,000 words on average (range 6,000-221,000)\n\nLiterary fiction: 98,000 words on average (range 58,000-163,000)\n\nScience fiction: 98,000 words on average (range 11,000-377,000)\n\nAction/adventure: 96,000 words on average (range 16,000-299,000)\n\nContemporary fiction: 96,000 words on average (range 33,000-196,000)\n\nWomen’s fiction: 94,000 words on average (range 6,000-163,000)\n\nMystery/thriller/suspense: 91,000 words on average (range 14,000-196,000)\n\nRomance: 91,000 words on average (range 19,000-194,000)\n\nCrime fiction: 89,000 words on average (range 24,000-180,000)\n\nReligious fiction: 75,000 words on average (range 13,000-161,000)\n\nErotica: 58,000 words on average (range 5,000-157,000)\n\nShort stories: 30,000 words on average (range 4,000-101,000)\n\nWhat are the key takeaways?\n\nHere are the key takeaways of what this data can mean for your novel length:\n\nWhile a book only needs 40,000 words to make the threshold for a novel, Best-selling authors are writing closer to 90,000 words on average. Readers might expect yours to fit that mold as well.\n\nFantasy, historical fiction, and horror novels are about 15% longer than other genres.\n\nIn one case, a fantasy book was in the top 25 best sellers with approximately 42,000 words (less than half of the average length for this category). Word count matters, but rules can still be broken!\n\nTo answer the commonly asked question: Are 70,000 words enough for a novel? 70,000 words would be enough for a standard religious fiction or erotica novel. However, most authors today are averaging 90,000 words in a novel, so you may want to increase the length.\n\nFormatting Has Never Been Easier\n\nWrite and format professional books with ease. Never before has creating formatted books been easier.\n\nClick here to see it in action\n\nHow many words are in a fantasy novel?\n\nThe average best-selling fantasy novel on Amazon contains around 109,000 words.\n\nRemember, this is a rule of thumb. There is quite a range in the word counts needed for world-building, and creating an alternate reality can take up extra words.\n\nIn the top 10 best-sellers, there were 2 books of 50,000 words or fewer. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there were also 13 books longer than 150,000 words and one over 300,000!\n\nHow many words are in a historical fiction novel?\n\nThe average best-selling historical fiction novel on Amazon is around 102,000 words, just over the 100,000 words we recommend as the max for a first-time author.\n\nThere were only a handful of historical fiction novels under 60,000 words, and the top 10 books in this genre averaged over 110,000 words. It’s a safe bet that you should have a solid word count if you write historical fiction.\n\nHow many words are in a horror novel?\n\nThe average best-selling horror novel is around 102,000 words. To reiterate, first-time authors should not exceed 100,000 words in their first book unless it is fantasy or sci-fi.\n\nOne novel stood far and away in the title for the longest horror story and, for that matter, all standalone stories. Can you guess which one?\n\nThe correct answer is The Stand by Stephen King, one of the masters of the genre, weighing in at 500,000 words.\n\nHow many words are in a genre fiction novel?\n\nThe average best-selling fiction novel is around 99,000 words.\n\nAs you can imagine, the top 100 genre fiction books had a smattering of every subject. Nevertheless, I was a bit surprised to see a lengthy 200,000-word book on the Roman Empire make the list. It serves as a reminder to write about your passions, even if they seem niche.\n\nHow many words are in a literary fiction novel?\n\nThe average best-selling literary fiction novel is around 98,000 words.\n\nOf the many genres, this one is relatively consistent in what works for readers. The top 100 for this category had the most negligible difference between the shortest book and the longest book.

Write your whole first draft out and edit later. Not only will this increase your word count, but it will also keep you in the creative headspace instead of stopping mid-sentence from fixing a minor detail. Your book will be longer before you know it!\n\nBring in a fresh face. Are there any new characters with opposing goals to your main characters that you could add to your story? What other obstacles could your hero overcome?\n\nWrite adventures, not explanations. Are there any summaries or detailed descriptions that you “told” that you could “show” instead? Allow the reader to infer your point for themselves through action instead of spelling it out for them in a few sentences. You can learn more about outlining a story here.\n\nAs you increase your word count, let your imagination flow like this.\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nYou can always go back and remove superfluous sections later.\n\nHow do I decrease my word count?\n\nIf you suddenly realize your book is twice the length you need, here are some questions and suggestions to consider:\n\nLook for non-essential scenes, characters, or subplots that can be removed from your story. A great guiding question: Does this add something essential to my novel?\n\nAre there characters or scenes that accomplish the same goal? Most readers don’t need you to spell things out twice.\n\nCut to the chase. Do you start your book scenes in the middle of the action, or are there long descriptions leading up to it? If you feel the need to explain every scene, try removing it and catching the character in the thick of things.\n\nCut unnecessary adverbs or adjectives, and don’t be afraid of contractions. If you find your writing is full of adverbs and adjectives, you may want to find more striking word choices. Instead of a “very graceful and pretty,” could your character be “enchanting?” Did your character “move quickly,” or did they lunge? You don’t need more words to be descriptive, just clear ones.\n\nLearn your habits. Do you always preface dialogue with a lengthy description of the surrounding countryside? Do you start all your chapters with the inner monologue of each character? Noticing your natural tendencies can help you to edit yourself.\n\nThough editing down your longer novel can feel tedious or even painful, remember the old Oscar Wilde quote, “Brevity is the soul of wit.” Your book will be better for this process.\n\nIf you’re looking for tools to help you edit, we’ve tested and reviewed dozens of editing, outlining, and formatting tools, so you don’t have to.\n\nHow many words per page are in a novel?\n\nNow that you know how many words should be in your book, you’re likely wondering how many words per page are in a novel?\n\nThe formatting and page count of a book varies, but it’s common to fit 250-300 words per page in a novel. The exact number per page is determined by the dialogue, spacing, and typeface you’ve chosen.\n\nHow many words does a 300-page book have? A 300-page book contains about 100,000 words when printed.
