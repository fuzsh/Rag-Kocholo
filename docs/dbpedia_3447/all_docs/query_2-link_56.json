        "text": "Whether you’re on a first date with a promising Hinge match, meeting a new friend-crush for brunch, or hanging out as usual with your ride or die besties, sometimes we could all use a handy conversation starter to fill an awkward silence or enhance the vibes. And while you could get deep, sometimes it’s better to keep things on the lighter side. That, friends, is where this extensive list of funny questions to ask friends/dates/literally whoever you want might come in handy.\n\nBut don’t be fooled. While these questions are mostly lighthearted (and pretty hilarious, if we do say so ourselves), trading funny Qs can be as much of a bonding experience as sharing deeper or more intimate questions. In fact, according to Damona Hoffman, host of the Dates & Mates podcast, humor is one of the best ways to connect with people and ease tension, whether that means breaking the ice on a slightly awkward first date, or deepening your bond with friends and loved ones.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you have to have a tight-ten standup routine memorized before every first date or friend hang, though. According to dating coach Alexis Germany, the key to being funny is, uh, not trying too hard. Trust your own sense of humor—whether you like puns, dad jokes, or topical quips about reality TV shows—and lean into it. Just not, like too hard, ya know?\n\nIf you find yourself drawing a blank, however, tossing out one of these fun and open-ended questions is sure to get the convo started and/or assist in the event of any awkward silences that may be in need of filling. Obviously, context matters. Some of these questions are going to be better for close friends than they are crushes or coworkers, so make sure you run a vibe check before you, say, try one of the slightly more risqué options on this list at your next work happy hour. Otherwise, prepare to delight and entertain your friends, crushes, random strangers on the street, etc. with some clever inquiries. You're welcome.\n\n1. What’s the most basic thing about you?\n\n2.
