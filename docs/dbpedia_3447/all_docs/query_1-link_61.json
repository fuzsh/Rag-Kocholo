        "text": "Title: Jack Reacher\n\nGenre: Action/Crime/Thriller\n\nStars: Tom Cruise, Rosamund Pike\n\nRuntime: 130 mins\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nI had never read One Shot (the book from which this movie is based) or any novel featuring the character of Jack Reacher, so I went into this movie with an open mind. In fact I didn’t even KNOW this was based on a book until my brother ranted about how Tom Cruise was a horrible casting choice, as Jack Reacher was supposed to be six-foot seven and 300 pounds (because there are PLENTY of actors that fit that description). So I settled into my theatre seat, quite unsure of what kind of experience I was going to have.\n\nThe movie opens with a sniper shooting five random victims from a parking garage. Obviously this case gets investigated and evidence found in the garage point to a man named James Barr who is quickly apprehended. However, he proclaims his innocence and requests that the police ‘Get Jack Reacher’. Jack Reacher (Cruise), we learn, is a drifter and former Military Police Officer. The police are unable to locate Reacher as there seems to be no record of him anywhere, but he saves them the trouble and shows up himself after seeing a news broadcast on Barr. Barr’s defense lawyer Helen (Pike) asks Reacher to look into the case, as she feels Barr is, in fact, innocent. What follows is Reacher following several leads to find who the real shooter was, and bring him to justice.\n\nI will start by saying that this film is a solid crime movie. It’s not too overloaded with plot twists and betrayals. This is more a movie for those who love crime movies, but don’t like to keep track of several characters and dozens of motifs and several plot twists.\n\nMy brother obviously hated Cruise being chosen for this role, but having never read any Jack Reacher books I wasn’t obligated out of loyalty to them to hate on Cruise’s performance. Seriously, say what you want about his religion or how crazy he was on Oprah that one time, Tom Cruise CAN act, and act well if given the right roles. And I had no issue with his performance in this film. He played the calm, collected Jack Reacher well, and it’s always fun to see Cruise punch people in the face several times. Sometimes I felt he played it a little TOO cool (I’m sure this guy does get angry now and again) and sometimes he delivered some cheesy lines way too seriously, but it was a solid performance.\n\nThe other actors did an okay job I found. Rosamund Pike was okay but either her or her character was obsessed with showing cleavage and frankly it was distracting (I’m a guy, leave me alone…). Seeing Robert Duvall on screen again was a delight and frankly he plays badass old men much better than Clint Eastwood. Yeah I went there. Werner Herzog played the villain fairly well. He certainly was sinister and had a perfect voice to match the dark character.\n\nI did enjoy the story to the film. I often find crime movies try to over complicate things, toss in twists and turns and dozens of characters because they are so obsessed with trying not to spoil who the bad guy is. This movie gets around this by simply not giving a damn, and blatantly revealing who the villain is part-way through. And I actually don’t have an issue with that, because the story isn’t over inflated and can be delivered at a good pace. It also allows time for some back story and character development, and focus on some side things, such as Helen’s relationship with her father (who is also the prosecutor).\n\nI also enjoyed the fact that the movie wasn’t full of action scenes, an issue that plagues many movies similar to this one. The action is used sparingly which allows more time to focus on the actually mystery and we all know Reacher is a badass so constantly reminding us by having him punching things just isn’t necessary. The movie leads up to a large action scene at the end so that should sate hunger for destruction the audience might have.\n\nI also enjoyed how the movie didn’t really follow formula too much. It’s hard to fully discuss this without giving away the plot but it isn’t just a ‘solve crime, get girl, arrest bad guy, live happily ever after’ kind of movie (which most crime films are). And we aren’t subjected to scenes where Reacher needs warrants, gets caught up in the ‘red tape’, or not doing certain things because he follows a code of honor, another problem with many crime films. It’s made clear from the start that Reacher does police work his way, and to hell with the rules.\n\nThe movie does have some glaring issues, however. While we aren’t guessing who the villain IS, we are supposed to be wondering about his PURPOSE. Why kill 5 random people? They do try to keep this hidden but I guessed what the purpose was long before it was revealed. And while they avoided formula for most of the time, there were still some things you see often in other movies. Like constantly implying that someone is an inside man, meaning that in the end he obviously WON’T be the inside man. It’s a boring tactic I’ve seen dozens of times. There was also your obligatory car chase scene, which bore me now because just about everything that can be done with car chases has already been done. Reacher, of course, opts to fight the lead henchman in hand to hand combat in order to preserve ‘honor’ despite having him at gun point seconds before, which wouldn’t be so bad if there wasn’t someone who’s life depended on him mere yards away who would be killed if he failed. Kill the guy when you have the chance would you, Reacher?\n\nThe worst issue for me was how basic the actually evidence trail was. I said earlier I was pleased it wasn’t too complicated, but Reacher is supposed to be this highly intelligent guy, and the movie plays it out like Reacher was the only one who would be able to notice the evidence. And frankly, ANY of the cops on the scene of the crime would notice odd things except apparently every cop fails at their job. One could argue that the prosecution believed they had an easy case, and no further investigation was needed, but any cop with any shred of decency and intelligence would point out issues with the crime scene. Really, they didn’t need Reacher for anything other than punching things. Perhaps this is supposed to be a commentary on the failings of the justice system, but if so it was done fairly weakly.\n\nIn the end I found Jack Reacher to b a fairly entertaining movie, and I would recommend it to those who love crime films. It has some issues but makes up for it with a decent story, cool action scenes, and a great performance by Cruise. I think you’ll have some fun watching it.\n\nSee you at the movies!\n\nRating: 7.5 punches out of 10"
