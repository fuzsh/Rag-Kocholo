        "text": "CBTB’S BEGINNER’S GUIDE TO JO Nesbø\n\nWhere to Start with My Favorite Crime Writer’s Work!\n\nIt will come as a surprise to absolutely no one that, here at CBTB, I am always looking for a reason to talk about my favorite crime writer: Jo Nesbø. Jo Nesbø is a Norwegian crime writer whose work I first fell in love with years ago (back in the pre-CBTB days!) on my very first trip to Norway. In the years since, my love of his work has inspired me to start this book blog, learn more about the Nordic Noir genre, and it even helped inform my choice to start working in publishing. (So yes, it’s safe to say I’m a huge fan of his!) Back in March 2017, I created this “Beginner’s Guide to Jo Nesbø” to help readers begin their own journeys with Nesbø’s work. Five years later (in March 2022, to be precise!), I’m still obsessed with Jo Nesbø—and, at long last, I’m revamping this blog post with all the latest information on Nesbø’s work!\n\nMy goal is for this blog post to be your one-stop shopping list and guide through Nesbø’s body of work. Here you’ll find a rundown of Nesbø’s bestselling detective series (including answers to frequently-asked questions I’ve received about the series over the years!), plus an overview of his standalone novels (and my recommendations for which standalones of his to prioritize!). As always, if you have any questions whatsoever about Nesbø that I haven’t addressed here, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I am truly always happy to help, and nothing makes me happier than seeing readers get hooked on Jo Nesbø novels! Happy reading!\n\nNESBø’S SERIES\n\nJo Nesbø writes both series and standalone novels, but his series books are definitely what he is best known for. If you’re a total newcomer to his work, I recommending starting with his series to get a series to get a sense of just what has made his writing so popular! Nesbø's Harry Hole series is one of the essential series within the Scandinavian crime fiction genre—and it's my personal favorite. No matter how widely I read within crime fiction, nothing tops this series for me.\n\nThe Harry Hole series is primarily set in Oslo, Norway, and it follows a troubled detective (Harry!) who finds himself hunting down all manner of criminals—and confronting his personal demons at the same time. Nesbø's series is unparalleled for its addictive plotting, gritty atmosphere, and vivid, engaging characters. Above all the fantastic elements to love about this series, #1 is main character Harry himself. He's a burdened, troubled man who is also inherently good: he never stops trying to keep his inner demons at bay, and he's utterly committed to helping others when he's able to. If you love the “damaged detective” trope and are always looking for a new crime fiction protagonist to fall in love with, Harry is your next obsession.\n\nAs of March 2022, there are 12 installments in the Harry Hole series. (And word on the street is, another one will be coming!!!)\n\nWhere to start reading the Harry Hole series:\n\nOPTION 1 - IF YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT READING A WHOLE SERIES:\n\nBegin with my personal favorite series installment, THE SNOWMAN. This is the perfect way to see if this series is for you, before you commit to reading it all the way through. You can read THE SNOWMAN as a standalone—you might have a few questions about characters' backstories, but overall, there really won't be an issue! If you love THE SNOWMAN, I recommend going back and starting the series from Book 3, THE REDBREAST - you'll want to experience the character development that occurs over the course of the books. Important note: THE SNOWMAN was made into a movie… and it was terrible. There’s really no need to watch that movie, but if you must, please watch it after reading the book!\n\nOPTION 2 - IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO READ THE SERIES ALL THE WAY THROUGH:\n\nBegin with Book 3, THE REDBREAST. I repeat, begin with Book 3. I know the temptation is strong to start with Book 1, but trust me on this. Nesbø is my most favorite author, and even I have to admit, Books 1 (THE BAT) and 2 (COCKROACHES) just do not do the rest of the series justice. Book 3 (THE REDBREAST) is what hooked me on this series. In particular, its ending gives readers a sense of the addictive, tense, suspenseful plotting that Nesbø masters as the series progresses.\n\n** If you really feel that you must read from the beginning, please just take Books 1 and 2 with a grain of salt! Don't get me wrong: they're in no way bad reads. But they aren't exceptional, and the rest of Nesbø's series truly is.**\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\n\nCan you read these books as standalones?\n\nTo expand on my previous mention of THE SNOWMAN - you can read these books as standalones. Each book deals with a different investigation, so it is possible to jump into the series wherever you'd like. That being said, I definitely recommend reading the books in order (starting with Book 3, like I mentioned before!) - while each book has its own case for Harry to investigate, there is a lot of character development across the series that you won't want to miss out on! There are also recurring references to past criminals Harry has hunted down that might confuse you if you jump around within the series.\n\nWhat’s the order of the Harry Hole series?\n\nThe Harry Hole series order is as follows:\n\nTHE BAT\n\nCOCKROACHES\n\nTHE REDBREAST\n\nNEMESIS\n\nTHE DEVIL'S STAR\n\nTHE REDEEMER\n\nTHE SNOWMAN\n\nTHE LEOPARD\n\nPHANTOM\n\nPOLICE\n\nTHE THIRST\n\nKNIFE\n\nWhich book in the series is your favorite?\n\nMy personal favorite installment in the series is Book 7, THE SNOWMAN, closely followed by Book 5, THE DEVIL’S STAR!"
