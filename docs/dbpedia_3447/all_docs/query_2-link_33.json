        "text": "When a mental health professional evaluates someone who’s on an involuntary psychiatric hold, they’re trying to determine:\n\nWhether the person actually has a mental health condition (either an established, chronic condition or a temporary one induced by something like stress or substance use), and\n\nWhether that mental health condition puts the person they’re evaluating at risk of harming themselves or others.\n\nThat risk of harm can be direct—such as a person threatening to harm or kill themselves or someone else—but it doesn’t have to be.\n\nA person could also meet criteria for involuntary treatment if they’re unable to care for themselves due to a mental health emergency.\n\nFor example, they might be at imminent risk of harm due to reckless behavior (like wandering in traffic) or because they’re not getting necessary treatment for a serious medical condition.\n\nLess than 5 percent of violent acts are committed by people with serious mental illness (SMI). In fact, people with SMI are more likely to be victims of violent crime than perpetrators—ten times more likely than people in the general population.\n\nHowever, this doesn’t mean people with SMI are never violent or dangerous. Sometimes, a person’s mental health condition can deteriorate to a dangerous point.\n\nFor example, a person with a psychotic disorder might stop taking medications, develop violent delusions, and start hearing voices telling them to hurt themselves or others. A person with a mood disorder might become so hopeless they decide to hurt themselves or others.\n\nThis is why we still have and use the civil commitment process: to intervene when someone’s at risk of harming themselves or others so they can get the care they need to keep everyone—including, and often especially, themselves—safe.\n\nWhile there are differences in the commitment process depending on where you live, the following steps generally describe how it works in most states.\n\nA private citizen, mental health professional, or police officer initiates an emergency psychiatric hold so a person can be evaluated for involuntary hospitalization.\n\nA police officer takes a person into custody on an emergency hold and brings them to a secure facility, usually a hospital emergency room, where they can be evaluated.\n\nA judge or magistrate issues a court order authorizing the person to be detained for a limited period of time while a mental health evaluation is completed.\n\nA qualified mental health professional (QMHP) performs an evaluation to determine whether the person meets civil commitment criteria. The QMHP typically interviews the person and other relevant parties and reviews available reports and records.\n\nThe QMHP completes a pre-screening report and submits it to a judge or magistrate.\n\nIf the report recommends commitment, and the judge or magistrate agrees, the court issues an order for a person to be involuntarily hospitalized pending a formal commitment hearing.\n\nThe state seeks placement in an accepting facility. This process can take hours, days, or—in extremely rare circumstances—even weeks. How long a person can be held at the place where they were evaluated while waiting for a bed at an accepting facility varies from state to state.\n\nA facility accepts the person on an involuntary commitment order and the person is transported to the accepting facility.\n\nWithin a set period of time that varies from state to state, the person who has been admitted for involuntary treatment must have a formal commitment hearing. This often takes place at the facility where they are being treated rather than in a courtroom.\n\nIf a judge or special justice upholds the commitment at the hearing, the person is then committed to inpatient care for a set period of time, often up to 30 days.\n\nHospital staff can release the person prior to the end of the commitment period if they are psychiatrically stable before that point. They can request a recommitment hearing if the person has not stabilized within the commitment period.\n\nIn summary, a person is placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold and evaluated. If the evaluator determines the person should be committed, they receive a commitment hearing.\n\nAt that hearing, the judge decides if they agree that the person needs to be committed. If they do, the person is committed to treatment until they are safe to be released—usually, no longer than 30 days, but usually much less than that.\n\nSometimes, the safest—or only—thing you can do in a mental health emergency is call the police. This is especially true if the person you’re calling about has a weapon and is threatening themselves or someone else with it.\n\nHowever, there is also a risk involved when you do. There have been many high-profile cases in which police who were called to the scene of a mental health emergency killed the person they were called to help.\n\nThese include cases where there was another option besides using deadly force. This reflects an unfortunate discrepancy between how officers are trained to respond to threats and how they would be trained to respond to a mental health emergency had they received such training.\n\nFortunately, many states and cities are seeking to address this issue by training officers to respond differently to mental health emergencies. One popular option is establishing Crisis Intervention Teams in which police partner up with mental health professionals for mental health emergency calls.\n\nIn any case, consider your circumstances carefully before calling 911 to request police intervention in a mental health emergency.\n\nIn some cases, it’s your only safe option. In other cases, alternative methods of getting the person to an emergency room for an evaluation (or even to have mental health professionals come to where the person is) may be appropriate and available.\n\nDepending on your circumstances, you may be able to call a state or local mental health crisis line for help instead of 911. You can go to our state mental health services page and select your state to find the crisis line you should use.\n\nThe first number you probably think of to call when there’s an emergency of any kind is 911. In some mental health emergencies, 911 is indeed the best—and safest—option.\n\nHowever, there’s another number you can call: a state or local mental health crisis line. These hotlines are usually part of the public mental health system and are specifically designed to help people get emergency mental health care when they need it.\n\nThere’s no hard and fast rule about when you should use an emergency mental health hotline and when you should call 911. But if you don’t think there’s an imminent danger of harm if police don’t show up immediately, it can be worth calling a crisis line. The person who answers can help you determine whether police need to be called, among other things.\n\nSome states have statewide mental health crisis lines, while others have different local hotlines depending on which county, city, or region you’re in. You can go to our state mental health services page and select your state to find the crisis line you should use.\n\nThe problem of mass shootings in America is often defined in the media as a mental health problem and a sign we need more and better mental health care.\n\nHowever, while we do need more mental health care, this is an unfair and usually inaccurate characterization of the root cause of these terrible and tragic events.\n\nMost mass shooters don’t meet any clinical or legal definition of mental illness. Instead, most are driven to violence by personal vendettas or ideologies that sanction violence.\n\nUnfortunately, targeting mental illness as the reason for these events has revived an inaccurate stigma that mental health advocates have been speaking against for decades.\n\nWhile people fear that people with mental illness are more dangerous than others, the truth is that people with mental illness are more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence.\n\nSome people with mental illness can and do become violent, but it’s an exception to the norm. Less than 5 percent of violent acts are committed by people with serious mental illness.\n\nThere are times when commitment has kept others safe from someone who actually was mentally ill and dangerous, and there are times when it can—and hopefully will—do so in the future.\n\nThere might well be cases when commitment could stop an act of mass violence. This is one important reason we still have it. But in most cases, the people it’s saving from harm are the people being committed."
