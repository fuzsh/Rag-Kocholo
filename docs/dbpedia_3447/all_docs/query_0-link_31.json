What relationships, hierarchies, and conflicts emerge and develop? What happens to individual psychology, as social networks grow larger and more complex? How do moral choices become more and more difficult? How does the form of the novel change to accommodate this growth and pose these questions? While the course focuses on these three novels, treating them as a trilogy, we will also mix in a variety of short lyric poetry, helping us to think further about both literary form and cultural history.\n\nENGL 6600 American Studies in Theory & Method\n\nTH, 4:30-7:30\n\nHolt, K\n\nAre you interested in interdisciplinary studies? Do you want to learn more about different methods and disciplinary approaches for studying American culture? Do you want to explore issues related to race, class, gender, the environment, social justice, music, film, media, and visual art in your academic work? This course introduces students to various practices of American cultural studies, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary research. Although it focuses specifically on the field of American Studies, this course is open to any students interested in interdisciplinarity. The first half of the course covers the history of interdisciplinary studies and current debates in the field of American Studies. Readings cover a range of topics including race and ethnicity, gender and sexuality, class, environmental studies, immigration, civil rights, and social justice. For the second half of the class, we engage in a series of “labs” where students have the chance to apply the critical theories and interdisciplinary methods studied in the first half of the class to examine specific works of literature, archival materials, music, and film. This course also introduces students to important practices for graduate study and professional development, which include applying for conferences and research funding, composing a CV, working with archives and special collections, maintaining effective research records, assembling a thesis committee, writing a thesis proposal, and working with faculty. These topics will be team-taught in four joint-sessions with another course, ENGL 6700: Introduction to Folklore Studies, which may require some scheduling adjustments for students who are not enrolled in the Folklore and American Studies master’s program. Students registering for ENGL 6000: Introduction to American Studies who not enrolled in the Folklore and American Studies master’s program should contact Dr. Keri Holt to manage any scheduling issues. Students will be required to write a formal research paper and give a presentation about their paper at the end of the semester, setting a solid foundation for work in future graduate courses and conference presentations.\n\nENGL 6700\n\nFolklore Theory/Method\n\nT, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nMcNeill, L This course is designed to introduce students to the discipline of Folklore Studies, a field that rests somewhere between the humanities and social sciences, and that encompasses all forms of everyday traditional expression such as fairy tales, folk beliefs, holiday customs, rumors and legends, internet memes, jokes, the supernatural, festivals, folk music, foodways, and much more. The first half of this course covers the history of the discipline and provides an introduction to the ongoing scholarly questions and approaches that folklorists use in their research. For the second half of the class, we engage in a series of “labs” where students have the chance to apply the critical theories and interdisciplinary methods studied in the first half of the class to examine specific forms of folklore. This course also introduces students to important practices for graduate study and professional development, which include applying for conferences and research funding, composing a CV, working with archives and special collections, maintaining effective research records, assembling a thesis committee, writing a thesis proposal, and working with faculty. These topics will be team-taught in four joint-sessions with another course, ENGL 6600: Introduction to American Studies, which may require some scheduling adjustments for students who are not enrolled in the Folklore and American Studies master’s program. Students registering for ENGL 6700: Introduction to Folklore Studies who are not enrolled in the Folklore and American Studies master’s program should contact Dr. Lynne McNeill to manage any scheduling issues. Students will be required to write a formal research paper and give a presentation about their paper at the end of the semester, setting a solid foundation for work in future graduate courses and conference presentations. ENGL 6740\n\nFolk Narrative/Method\n\nM, 4:30-7:00 pm Morales, E Our childhood exposure to folk and fairy tales shapes our morality, frames our perceptions of gender, and influences our philosophical beliefs. While Disney films sanitize these stories, the earliest oral versions were often gory, involving dismemberment, cannibalism, and even incest. In recent years, however, numerous television series and films have begun revisiting these tales, targeting them for a more adult audience, using all of the earlier blood, death, gore, and then some. Yet, how can folk and fairy tales lend themselves to these extremely different tellings? What changes and what stays the same?\n\nThis course will provide an overview of narrative folklore, exploring the main genres, and pairing texts with their modern day interpretations. We will trace and discuss their transformation from oral to print to film, examining the changes brought on from the new mediums, context, and audience, delineating variations in motifs and conventions. Our analysis will also look at story structure, meaning, and function, using methodologies derived from literary theory, folklore studies, gender studies, psychoanalysis, and film studies. Material will cover the canon of Aesop, Grimm, and Perrault, but also incorporate indigenous narratives from the Americas, Asia, Pacific, and Africa in order to engender a holistic understanding of how narrative functions in different cultures. In the process, we will problematize issues of childhood, “mature content,” cultural representation, ownership & appropriation, colonialism through narrative, sexuality, femininity & masculinity, children’s literature, ethnocentrism, and censorship.\n\nENGL 6884\n\nNonfiction Writing\n\nM, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nSinor, J\n\nIn this graduate nonfiction writing workshop, students will have the opportunity to write both linear and lyric form. The focus of the course will be on the benefits and drawbacks found in the pursuit of various forms; we will also examine the organic relationship between form and content. This course will not offer students an introduction to creative nonfiction. It is assumed that students have that background. Students may complete work that fits into their theses projects as long as the work can stand on its own. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to write and publish literary journal reviews with NewPages and will create a collaborative performance piece to be shared at Helicon West on December 5. The final portfolio will include two essays accompanied by introductions that provide critical reflection on decisions made about form.\n\nENGL 6810\n\nComposition Studies\n\nW, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nRivera-Mueller, J\n\nThis course is designed to help you study your work as a writing teacher and deepen your understanding of Composition Studies. As a participant in the course, you will have the opportunity to develop a scholarly project that addresses one of your most pressing questions about learning to write or learning to teach writing. Throughout the course, we will examine foundational and contemporary composition scholarship to support the development of these projects. We will ground this study in an explicit focus on inquiry—the questions and the methods for pursuing questions that shape this field. This course privileges your questions about learning to write or learning to teach writing because it is designed to foster your current and future development as a writer/teacher/scholar. This course is a great fit for people who care about writing pedagogy and would like a context to study a particular aspect of their teaching.\n\nENGL 6410/7410\n\nIntro to Technical Communication\n\nThis is an online/hybrid course. Master’s students register for 6410, PhD students for 7410. PhD students are required to attend a face-to-face meeting every week in addition to the online.\n\nWalton, R\n\nENGL 6410/7410 is designed to welcome graduate students across the English Department. Whether you're curious about the field of Technical Communication and Rhetoric specifically or just want to learn how to assess a field by its scholarship, this online course is for you.\n\nENGL 6410 will help you to develop a foundational understanding of Technical Communication and Rhetoric as a field:\n\n*Major theories underlying the scholarship, such as rhetorical theory and new materialism\n\n*Major research topics explored through this scholarship, from social justice to workplace writing genres\n\n*Tensions and concerns at the heart of the field, especially relationships between industry and academia\n\nStudents interested in academic careers will benefit by develop scholarly skills applicable across majors:\n\n*How to trace scholarly conversations across the publications of a field\n\n*How to recognize topics of recent and growing interest (i.e., promising topics for your own scholarship to advance the field)\n\n*How to visually represent an academic field\n\n*How to craft a literature review (a central component of research publications and presentations)\n\nStudents working in industry in technical communication will benefit by:\n\n* Conducting secondary research to synthesize how existing scholarship can inform problem solving in the workplace\n\n* Developing a broader understanding of the field, beyond their own career experience\n\n* Learning how theoretical frameworks can inform and improve practice\n\nENGL 6470/7470\n\nStudies in Specialized Docs\n\nOnline\n\nMcLaughlin, J\n\nThe first half of this course will explore the power of metaphor in marketing and approaching potential customers. The second half will examine in detail how to develop proposals based on customer requests for proposals. The intimate relationship of the two topics will become clear as the methods of how to frame a proposal argument revolve around the underlying metaphors which drive customer decisions. PhD students will combine the study of metaphors with an examination of how archetypes interact with marketing decisions and customer behavior.\n\nENGL 6800/7800\n\nTeaching Online\n\nOnline Grant-Davie, K If you pursue an academic career, you may well be assigned or given the opportunity to teach online, and even nonacademic workplaces use online training. This course prepares you to meet these challenges confidently in settings ranging from K–12 to post-secondary to corporate training. The class will meet online, so it will offer you the opportunity to learn about online writing instruction experientially. We will ask questions such as these:\n\nWhat range of forms can online writing instruction take, and what range of students does it serve?\n\nHow do instructors need to change their roles and adapt their material and teaching methods as they move from face-to-face instruction to online instruction? What are the best practices for managing online classes and discussion forums effectively and efficiently?\n\nWhat learning theories underlie those best practices?\n\nWhat can instructors do to create presence and build community in their online classes?\n\nHow are technologies being used in online writing instruction?\n\nWhat options do instructors have for responding to student work and assessing it in online classes?\n\nWhat should instructors know about issues of ownership and plagiarism in online classes?\n\nIn addition to meeting online with ENGL 6800 students, students in 7800 will also meet in person for one hour each week on the Logan campus. Students in 6800 are welcome to sit in on those meetings if they choose. The class will require just one text: Boettcher, J. V., & Conrad, R.-M. (2016). The online teaching survival guide: Simple and practical pedagogical tips (2nd ed.). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. Additional readings will be posted online.\n\nENGL 6820: Practicum in Teaching English\n\nTR: 10:30-11:45am Buyserie, B. This course is designed specifically and required for new graduate instructors teaching English 1010. Our collective goal is to facilitate both short- and long-term teacher growth, preparing teachers for current and subsequent teaching responsibilities through an emphasis on the dialectical relationship between theory and practice. Class begins during the pre-semester orientation where new instructors begin building a community with other teachers, are introduced to resources and curriculum, and are mentored through fall semester teaching preparation. Learning progresses throughout the practicum as we read, analyze, and discuss pivotal texts in composition and rhetorical theory and pedagogy. Participants become reflective practitioners by maintaining a journal tying course concepts to classroom experiences, writing several English 1010 assignments, observing peers and mentors in classrooms and the Writing Center, and consolidating a teaching identity through the creation of a teaching philosophy.\n\nCourse\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nENGL 6330: Topics in Literary Studies (Subtitle: Haunted by History: The Deep Eighteenth Century)\n\nW, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nBurkert, M\n\nThe breakout Broadway musical Hamilton is a hip-hop retelling of the American Revolution and the founding of the Republic, but it’s also more than that: it’s a meditation on how we mythologize historical figures, how we grapple with the darkest aspects of our history, and how we can simultaneously recognize the legacies of that past in our present while remaking the world to reflect our own values. This course takes Hamilton as an entry point into an examination of the ways our twenty-first-century world is haunted by the ghosts of history—from distinctively modern forms of scientific inquiry, individual rights, and representative governments, to finance capitalism, colonialism, and slavery. We will read texts from the long eighteenth century (1660-1800) in conversation with more recent adaptations and responses that grapple with the present’s ambivalent relationship to the past: Aphra Behn’s anti-slavery novella Oroonoko (1688) and its adaptations for the stage from 1696 to 1999; Daniel Defoe’s novel Robinson Crusoe (1719) with J. M. Coetzee’s postcolonial reimagining, Foe (1986); and Margaret Cavendish’s early science fiction work The Blazing World (1666) alongside Neal Stephenson’s speculative historical novel about England’s scientific revolution, Quicksilver (2003). Along the way, we will explore what theater scholar Joseph Roach calls “the deep eighteenth century:” the unfinished business of the Enlightenment that lingers spectrally in the corridors of modernity. The final course project will likewise collapse past and present, as the class develops an online digital exhibition that blends historical research with analysis of literary and cultural sources from library databases and Special Collections.\n\nENGL 6400/7400:\n\nAdvanced Editing\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7400 and will also meet face-to-face once a week)\n\nOnline (MTC), Hybrid (PHD)\n\nGrant-Davie, K\n\nIf you receive an advanced degree from this department, you will almost certainly need editing skills, no matter what you do next. This course is your chance to learn those skills or, if you already have editing experience, to sharpen and refine them by reevaluating your editing practices and how you justify them. (Teaching this course has improved my own writing.) We will practice and discuss many aspects of editing—from crafting language at the sentence level to shaping whole documents for rhetorical effect, organization and content, graphics, and document design. You will learn how to reread your writing productively and how to expand or condense it as needed.\n\nThe course is designed mainly for students in the online Master of Technical Communication program and for doctoral students in the Theory & Practice of Professional Communication program. The course materials will be biased towards tech/professional communication. Students from literary studies, creative writing, American studies, or folklore are very welcome to take the course and should find it quite helpful. However, we will not address editing skills that are specific to creative writing, e.g., editing fiction for narrative pacing or plot development—skills that are better developed in an ENGL 6880 creative writing workshop course.\n\nAll students in ENGL 6400 and 7400 will meet online. Students in 7400 will also meet in person on the Logan campus each week, and students in 6400 are welcome to sit in on those meetings if they choose.\n\nWe will read the following two texts plus additional readings:\n\nRude, C. & Eaton, E. (2010). Technical editing (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson/Longman.\n\nWilliams, J. M. & Bizup, J. (2017). Style: Lessons in clarity and grace (12th ed.). Boston: Pearson/Longman.\n\nENGL 6460/7460:\n\nDisability Studies and Accessability\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7460 and will also meet face-to-face once a week)\n\nOnline (MTC), Hybrid (PHD)\n\nColton, J Over 41 million Americans (or 15% of the total U.S. population) “have some level of disability\" (U.S. Census Bureau), and according to the U.S. Department of Education, the number of college students with disabilities has increased phenomenally since 1978. Older Americans also stand to benefit from assistive technologies and other features of accessible design. In this course, we will explore accessibility through a lens of disability studies and social justice, which provide additional contexts for understanding the importance of accessibility within physical and digital environments. We will discuss and practice rhetorical and legal standards of effective and accessible design (such as WCAG 2.0), through an “intervention” assignment with the Center for Innovative Design and Instruction at USU, for which you will take inaccessible PDF documents used at USU and make them accessible for screen reading software (great for your resume/CV, btw). Largely, we will focus on considering and producing rhetorically effective closed-captions (with Camtasia and other software) to movies, youtube videos, and online educational videos—not as an afterthought but as a vital part of the video production process. By the end of the course, you should have a good understanding of disability studies theory, be able to make a strong case for accessible design, have improved your video production and design skills, and understand how to approach multiple technologies and rhetorical situations for accessibility.\n\nENGL 6480/7480:\n\nAdvanced Editing\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7480 and will also meet face-to-face once a week)\n\nOnline (MTC), Hybrid (PHD) Colton, J\n\nThis class offers an introduction to the relationships among technology, rhetoric, culture, and writing, with a specific emphasis on digital and “new” media. The emergence of digital writing and new media networks has brought into question the usefulness of traditional rhetorical concepts. For example, once defined as only the gestures accompanying the speech of a rhetor, delivery now includes the technological medium of expression (social and mobile media, video, audio). We have moved from traditional terms such as “the rhetorical situation” (speaker-message-audience) to posthumanist frameworks interested in rhetorical circulation and velocity, where digital file formatting is considered a rhetorical choice anticipating how your text, video, or images will be sampled and remixed by others. As researchers and practitioners of digital writing and rhetoric, we will take into account the important role of these new media and digital writing practices (yes, including Facebook and Twitter!). This course will question assumptions of culturally neutral, celebratory, determinist, and value-free narratives of technology. We will develop critical vocabulary and knowledge of the ethical, historical, political, and social contexts that influence our everyday use of writing technologies.\n\nENGL 6600:\n\nAmerican Studies Theory and Method\n\nM, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nHolt, K.\n\nAre you interested in issues involving race, class, gender, the environment, social justice, media studies, music, film, and visual art? Do you like to use different methods and approaches in your academic work? This course introduces students to the practice of cultural studies, with an emphasis on the methods and practice of interdisciplinary research. Although we focus specifically on the field of American studies, this course is open to any student who is interested in contemporary critical debates and interdisciplinary approaches. The first half of the course covers the history of interdisciplinary studies and current debates in the field of American Studies. The second half of the course focuses on case studies of interdisciplinary work that engage with literary studies, American folklore, American music and ballad traditions, film studies, personal narratives, archival research, and more. Readings cover a range of topics including Native American studies, immigration and US borderlands, gender and sexuality, environmental studies, class issues, and debates involving ethics and social justice. Readings include Dinaw Mengestu’s The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears, Philip Deloria’s Indians in Unexpected Places, Américo Paredes’s With a Pistol in His Hand, and more.\n\nENGL 6720:\n\nFolklore Fieldwork\n\nW, 1:30-4:00 pm\n\nGabbert, L\n\nThis course covers the basic skills needed to conduct beginning graduate-level fieldwork. Students will obtain hands-on experience with recording equipment, including cameras and digital recording kits. We will cover a variety of techniques and methods, including observation, participant-observation, and interviewing, as well as the recording of fieldnotes. In addition, we will cover fieldwork ethics and theorize the problems of IRB (Institutional Review Board/Human Subjects). Finally, we also will read several works that utilize fieldwork as a primary research tool. Students are required to complete a series of fieldwork assignments as well as a final paper.\n\nENGL/HIST 4700 & ENGL 6760: Material Culture and Folk Art\n\nTR, 12:00-1:15 pm\n\nThomas, J\n\nHow is meaning generated and communicated through objects? This course explores folk forms and their relation to culture, history, and narrative. We will explore objects from different cultures and time periods in relation to questions including:\n\nWhy would someone put a wooden cutout of a peeing boy in their front yard, and what does it have to do with European aristocracy?\n\nWhat is the meaning of style? Seapunk? Sapeur? New Age Traveler? Brony? Pachuco? Teddy Boy? Health Goth?\n\nWhy are there so many statues of naked women in large cemeteries, and what does it have to do with Logan Cemetery’s Weeping Woman statue?\n\nWhy cosplay?\n\nAre selfies narcissistic? What traditions do they emerge from?\n\nWhat does Barbie have to tell us about culture?\n\nWhat is the value in small objects that are often overlooked?\n\nENGL 6770: Seminar in Folklore and Folklife, When da Folk came to Harlem\n\nT, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nShively, S\n\nWe will study the tensions, rewards, and challenges in the lives of African American people and culture as a consequence of the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North after World War I. How does daily life change when people migrate? What traditions did people bring with them? What new patterns did they adopt? In what ways are the popular images of Southern African American life (slow, poverty, residual plantation culture, field labor, etc.) and of urban city life (jazz, the club scene, dance, vibrant street life, etc.) constructed? In what ways are they genuine? Primary source materials will include literature (poetry, fiction, nonfiction, drama, film), visual art, music, dance, and journalism. Creative work by Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes, Sterling Brown, Nella Larsen, Aaron Douglas, Ma Rainey, and many others! We will study secondary sources that have examined historical, sociological, aesthetic, and gendered aspects of African American popular culture. Opportunities for research projects will be available for students in folklore, literature and writing, American studies, history, technical and professional writing. This course is crosslisted as History 6770.\n\nENGL 6883: Graduate Seminar in Poetry Writing\n\nR, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nSowder, M\n\nENGL 6883 is a poetry-writing workshop in which students will write poetry and share their work for critique in a supportive yet rigorous environment. The class will study contemporary poetry, focusing on the 2017 edition of The Best American Poetry, in addition to reading outstanding individual books of contemporary poetry, including award-winning works by poets Edward Hirsch and Paisley Rekdal, both of whom will be visiting campus in the spring. Students will complete a chapbook of poems as their final project. The class will also focus on the submission of poems for publication.\n\nCourse\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nENGL 6330: Topics in Literary Studies (Subtitle: Detective Fiction and Film)\n\nTR, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nMcCuskey, B\n\nHow many degrees of separation are there between Oedipus and Veronica Mars? This graduate seminar explores the genre of detective fiction, both its history and its theory, in both literature and film. We will read primarily British and American fiction, although we will begin in ancient Greece and head toward France and Argentina. The main goal of the course is to trace the evolution of the genre across a range of authors, forms, and contexts: Sophocles, Edgar Allan Poe, Wilkie Collins, Arthur Conan Doyle, G. K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Carolyn Keene, Jorge Luis Borges, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Patricia Highsmith, and Paul Auster. We will also watch detectives ply their trade at the movies and on television, in both adapted and original stories, from Bogart to Marge Gunderson. Our overarching goal is to develop ideas—and, eventually, theories—about the genre’s underlying symbolic structure and recurring effects.\n\nENGL 6350\n\nAmerican Literature and Culture (Subtitle: Lines of Dissent: Four American Women Poets)\n\nThursdays, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nCrumbley, P\n\nThis course concentrates on the poetry of four major American poets: Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop, and May Swenson. The word “Dissent” that appears in the course title puns on the interplay of “dissent” and “descent” so central to the critical and scholarly practice of positioning each poet within an American female poetic tradition, or line of descent, while simultaneously arguing that each one in her own way rebels or dissents from that tradition. As a consequence, the class will examine key features of a poetic tradition that may be traced as far back Anne Bradstreet at the same time that we identify the manner in which each poet challenges that tradition. Doing so will require that we tease out the ways in which each poet reflects and subverts prevailing cultural norms. In the final weeks of the semester, we will pay special attention to Swenson’s contributions and departures from this tradition in an effort to assess her importance. The culminating project for the course will be the development of individual displays or exhibits linking Swenson to one or more of these American women poets. Students will also complete ten-page research papers to accompany their exhibits. The exhibits will be displayed in Merrill-Cazier Library and other locations around campus.\n\nENGL 6700: Folklore Theory and Methods\n\nTuesdays, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nMcNeill, L This course will introduce students to the field of academic folklore studies. We will cover major genres of folklore, the history of the discipline, theories and approaches, and dominant themes. Many students find folklore studies to be a surprisingly contemporary and relatable field, one that can pair well with other areas of interest such as literature, history, and anthropology. Students will have the opportunity to pursue folkloristic research into their own topics of choice, all while exploring this unique (and fun!) field of study.\n\nENGL 6740: Folk Narrative (Subtitle: The Fairy Tale)\n\nWednesdays, 4:30-7:00 pm\n\nSchwabe, C Although this course will touch on all of the principal narrative genres in folk tradition, its main focus will be on the fairy tale. Why do fairy tales appear in almost every culture across the globe and why are they so popular? Undoubtedly because they encapsulate in (usually) succinct form many of the most pressing concerns of human existence: family conflict, the struggle for survival, sexual desire, the quest for happiness, among many others. This course explores why writers and readers have been attracted to the fairy-tale form through a study of its key elements and its uses in adult and children’s literature, book illustration, film, television, and the Internet. Special attention will be given to the German Children’s and Household Tales, along with French, Italian, Danish, English, and selected non-Western fairy tales. Works of contemporary mainstream scholars, such as Jack Zipes, Maria Tatar, Donald Haase, and Maria Warner, and various critical lenses will be applied to the tales to reveal multiple methods of analyzing the texts. Students can expect to read and analyze some of the most popular fairy tales from each of the major collections in Western Europe, augmented by postmodern retellings and adaptations in literature and the media.\n\nENGL 6800/7800\n\nTheory and Practice of Online Education\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7800 and will also meet face-to-face once a week)\n\nOnline (MTC), Hybrid (PHD)\n\nGrant-Davie, K.\n\nWhat range of forms can online writing instruction take, and what range of students does it serve? How do instructors need to change their roles and adapt their material and teaching methods as they move from face-to-face instruction to online instruction? What are the best practices for managing online classes and discussion forums effectively and efficiently? What learning theories underlie those best practices? What can instructors do to create presence and build community in their online classes? How are technologies being used in online writing instruction? What options do instructors have for responding to student work and assessing it in online classes? What should instructors know about issues of ownership and plagiarism in online classes?\n\nIn addition to meeting online with ENGL 6800 students, students in 7800 will also meet in person for one hour each week on the Logan campus. Students in 6800 are welcome to sit in on those meetings if they choose. The class will require just one text: Boettcher, J. V., & Conrad, R.-M. (2016). The online teaching survival guide: Simple and practical pedagogical tips (2nd ed.). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. Additional readings will be posted online.\n\nENGL 6820\n\nPracticum in Teaching English\n\nTR, 10:30-1:15 pm\n\nDethier, B This course is designed specifically for graduate instructors teaching English 1010. It focuses on the theory and practice of teaching writing but also prepares graduate instructors for further teaching responsibilities. We schedule it for two class periods, but the second period is usually reserved for outside speakers and special presentations. Participants complete some of the English 1010 assignments as well as a final synthesis paper, and they share some of their best ideas in a half-hour presentation to the class. Required of all new English graduate instructors and must be taken with the pre-semester Orientation.\n\nENGL 6884: Creative Nonfiction Workshop\n\nMondays, 4:30-7:00\n\nSinor, J.\n\nThis graduate course is primarily a creative writing workshop focused on making and responding to literary art. A background in creative writing is not required but recommended. This fall, we will be focusing on non-linear form, specifically the braided essay. Students will spend the semester studying the braided form—essays that move between three strands (a research strand, a site visit, and a personal strand) and that are bound by metaphor or image. They will write a twenty-plus-page braided essay. In this class, students will be introduced to archival work, the use of primary and secondary source materials in creative writing, living research, scene reconstruction, and creating characters out of real and historical figures. Site visits are required, as is extensive interviewing. The result—a complex woven piece that pursues a difficult question in a unique and compelling way—is one of the most engaging and popular forms of literary nonfiction being written today.\n\nENGL 7000: Advanced Research Methods\n\nOnline\n\nMoeller, R\n\nThis course is designed to survey major methods for conducting research in English across academic and nonacademic settings, covering the following topics:\n\ngenerating research questions;\n\nselecting a research design;\n\nreviewing the most relevant literature;\n\napplying theoretical models; and\n\nunderstanding validity, reliability, and generalizability.\n\nWe will study qualitative methods (ethnographies, fieldwork, and case studies), quantitative methods (surveys, experiments, and simple statistical analyses), and mixed methods approaches to research and apply each to a problem that you identify in your area/field.\n\nUpon completing this course, you should be able to\n\nformulate effective research questions;\n\ndesign valid and reliable research studies that will generate data addressing your research questions;\n\nunderstand the differences between qualitative, quantitative, and experimental approaches to research and know which methods best support which types of research questions;\n\nuse evidence gained from pilot studies to support research proposals; and\n\ndescribe the landscape of current research in your field.\n\nCourse\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nENGL 6330\n\nTopics in Literary Studies - Cross-listed with ENGL 5300: Special Topics in Literature\n\nCooper-Rompato, C\n\nCooper-Rompato, C When you hear the words “fantasy literature,” what do you think of? Orcs and wizards, alternative worlds, magic and dragons? How did this strange and wonderful genre develop, and where is it headed? In this class, we’ll consider the “forefathers” of the genre, the medievalists J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, with an eye toward how the genre has grown in the last sixty years. How does the atheist Philip Pullman rewrite the Christian narratives of Tolkien and Lewis? How has the Jamaican author Nalo Hopkinson pioneered the new genre of “Urban Fantasy”? What does contemporary children’s fantasy literature have to offer? We’ll consider how fantasy’s other worlds actually explore this world’s pressing questions of religion, gender, race, class, and disability. We’ll also consider the cross-over between fantasy and other forms of speculative fiction. Readings include The Fellowship of the Ring (J.R.R. Tolkien), The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (C.S. Lewis), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone (J.K. Rowling), The Golden Compass (Philip Pullman), Sister Mine (Nalo Hopkinson), Sisters Grimm (Michael Buckley).\n\nPlease note that this is a cross-listed class; there are four graduate seats open in a senior seminar (ENGL 5300), which allows for 21 undergraduates. Grads will attend Tu/Th class with the undergraduates, and you will also meet for one hour outside of class/week, where we will discuss extra primary and secondary readings. Grads will also be expected to give presentations and lead class discussion several times, as well as write a 20-page seminar paper.\n\nENGL 6350/6440/7440\n\nAmerican Literature and Culture: The Literature and Culture of the American Farm -\n\nCross-listed with ENGL 6440/7440: Studies in Culture and Professional Communication\n\nFunda, E. Thomas Jefferson called farmers “the chosen people of God” and claimed that they were inherently virtuous, the best citizens for the new republic. Even if we think Jefferson’s claims exaggerated, there’s no denying that the American imagination has endowed farming with profound and enduring symbolic significance. This course is based on the theory that no other occupation —with perhaps the exception of motherhood—so fully spans the imaginative range of human experience or is so profoundly invested with symbolic significance in our culture, even by those who have never worked or lived on a farm. Thus, farming is a kind of imaginative shopping cart into which we carry around a whole host of rather romanticized ideas, expectations, and beliefs. It is a shimmering ideal and a cardinal experience, one that has been endowed with meaning deeper than merely placing seed into soil. Understanding how our culture continues to mythologize the American Farm— even as farm history is fraught with significant controversies and tensions—can offer insights into everything from public policy to the popularity of country music to current “back to the land” & “local food” movements. Therefore, this interdisciplinary course will examine the story of the American farm in literature, history, mythology, art, film, folklore, music, and popular culture in order to consider how and why our culture idealizes rural landscape and lifestyle so fully, even in our increasingly urban nation.\n\nENGL 6410/7410 (Online)\n\nTheory and Research in Professional and Technical Communication\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7410 and will also meet face to face once a week)\n\nWalton, R. Course Description: ENGL 6410/7410 is designed to welcome graduate students across the English Department. Whether you're curious about the field of Technical Communication and Rhetoric specifically or just want to learn how to assess a field by its scholarship, this online course is for you.\n\nENGL 6410 will help you to develop a foundational understanding of Technical Communication and Rhetoric as a field:\n\n- Major theories underlying the scholarship, such as rhetorical theory and new materialism\n\n- Major research topics explored through this scholarship, from social justice to workplace writing genres\n\n- Tensions and concerns at the heart of the field, especially relationships between industry and academia\n\nIn this course, you'll also develop scholarly skills applicable across majors:\n\n- How to trace scholarly conversations across the publications of a field\n\n- How to recognize topics of recent and growing interest (i.e., promising topics for your own scholarship to advance the field)\n\n- How to visually represent an academic field\n\n- How to craft a literature review (a central component of research publications and presentations)\n\nHIST 6600\n\nAmerican Studies Theory and Methods\n\nNote that this class is open to all American Studies and English students. American Studies students must take this class. Grieve, V. Course Description: This class will teach students how American Studies scholars think, argue, research, and write. Students will trace the changing definition of American Studies as a field, from the \"myth and symbol\" school to projects spanning both American continents. They will study their field's relationship to twentieth-century social movements and related theoretical categories, including cultural studies, and class; feminism, gender, and sexuality; and anti-colonialism, post-colonialism, race, and ethnicity. American Studies is an interdisciplinary field that investigates American culture and society in all their complexity. Building on a foundation of history and institutions, literature and the arts, and race and ethnicity, the students in this class will bring a range of disciplinary approaches to bear on their efforts to analyze and interpret America's past and present.\n\nENGL 6700\n\nFolklore Theory and Methods\n\nGabbert, L.\n\nThis is a graduate level survey course largely organized around a “keywords” approach to the discipline. A “keywords” approach means that we will learn about the field in terms of concepts and organizing ideas that are important in understanding both the history of folklore studies and its contemporary manifestations. We will spend some time on the intellectual origins the discipline and its evolution, but we also will read a number of recently published books in order to see which foundational ideas still have purchase today and why. The aim of the course is to offer beginning graduate students some literacy in bibliographical, theoretical, and methodological fields of knowledge over which folklorists should have solid control. Finally we will review the use of scholarly tools such as journals, indices, bibliographies, and archival resources that will be useful in the formulation of a solid research program.\n\nENGL 6460/6770/7460\n\nStudies in Digital Media/Folklore Seminar\n\nCross-listed with ENGL 6460/7460 Studies in Digital Media\n\nMcNeill, L.\n\nThis course will offer an in-depth consideration of a rapidly emerging area of folklore studies: folklore and digital culture. It explores the ways in which we can understand folklore in a digital context, the kinds of folklore we find in digital settings, the kinds of folk groups we find through the use of communication technologies, how fieldwork changes in an online environment, and the ways humans make meaning in diverse technological contexts. The Internet is a really cool, really weird place. Brace yourselves.\n\nENGL 6820\n\nTeaching Practicum\n\nThis class is mandatory for all new Graduate Instructors.\n\nDethier, B.\n\nThis course is designed specifically for graduate instructors teaching English 1010. It focuses on the theory and practice of teaching writing but also prepares graduate instructors for further teaching responsibilities. We schedule it for two class periods, but the second period is usually reserved for outside speakers and special presentations. Participants complete some of the English 1010 assignments as well as a final synthesis paper, and they share some of their best ideas in a half-hour presentation to the class. Required of all new graduate instructors.\n\nENGL 6882\n\nGraduate Fiction Writing Workshop\n\nWaugh, C. The graduate fiction writing workshop will explore a variety of contemporary fiction, and give students the opportunity to share their own stories with others and to receive feedback. Since we will have a variety of levels of proficiency in the class, we’ll approach craft from a pedagogical point of view that should be useful to everyone, including those who might one day like to teach fiction writing as well as those who just want to write better fiction. We’ll also investigate how contemporary literary fiction has coopted elements from genres such as YA, sci-fi, fantasy, detective, etc.\n\nENGL 6830/7830 (Online)\n\nRhetorical Theory\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7830 and will also meet face to face once a week)\n\nMoeller, R.\n\nRhetoric means a number of things these days; most commonly, it means “empty speech” or “the inability to act.” However, in this course, we will study rhetoric as the persuasive means that call an individual or community to action by asking the following questions:\n\n- What does it take to change someone’s mind (metanoia)?\n\n- What must the circumstances be to facilitate this change (kairos)?\n\n- What is the interaction between the call to action, the circumstances surrounding the call, and the individual whose mind is changed (rhetoric)?\n\nIn order to answer these questions, we will investigate the computer game industry via rhetorical theory. The computer game industry is one of the leading catalysts of change in our culture: it drives innovation across technological, economic, consumer, and cultural sectors. It has become a multi-billion dollar industry, and it has surpassed the film industry in gross sales and influence. Yet, at its most basic level, it relies upon rhetoric to get you to buy a game and/or a gaming platform, and it relies upon rhetoric to get you to move a game piece; play a card; or push a button on a keyboard, controller, or mobile device in order to advance the gameplay of whatever game you are playing. At more advanced levels, we will study how game design—often in non-verbal, procedural ways—induces us to accept certain assumptions, value judgments, relationships, and actions as appropriate and others as not, thereby influencing the world views of a generation of gamers. This is what McAllister calls the mass culture force of computer games. The class will teach you to notice and critique the rhetoric of games. You will learn to ask how a game supposes you—as a player—should think about other people and values and choices and decide whether you can accept those suppositions. For example, do you want to embrace the persona the game encourages you to embrace? Are your values and identity represented by the game and the player character, or are you forced to adopt alternative values and identifications as you play the game? What lasting effects do these rhetorical devices have on you as a player? on your gameplay?\n\nIn this course, you will be required to play, read about, and think about games and rhetorical theory. Readings will include scholarship on rhetorical theory and the rhetoric of games and a novel. No prior experience with gaming or rhetoric is necessary. You should be prepared to access and play at least one game for the entire semester. You will be assessed in class discussions and activities, several short papers, and a longer final paper.\n\nCourse\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nENGL 6350\n\nBritish Literature and Culture\n\nCooper-Rompato, C. This course focuses on Geoffrey Chaucer, “the Father of the English language,” and his amazing fourteenth-century experiment in English, the Canterbury Tales. We will read a number of the tales in Middle English and explore contemporary scholarship on them. We will encounter talking chickens, a flying mechanical horse, a giant with two heads, lovers in a pear tree, a “nether” kiss… yes, the Canterbury Tales has it all! Along the way we will also learn quite a bit about late medieval English history and culture. Course work includes presentations and a seminar paper. Required Text: Riverside Chaucer: Canterbury Tales (used copies available used from Amazon quite inexpensively). No previous experience with medieval literature and/or Middle English necessary. All are welcome!\n\nENGL 6350\n\nAmerican Literature and Culture\n\nBeat Culture: On the Page and in the Arhcive\n\nCrumbley, P. This course is dedicated the study of Beat literature, with a special emphasis on Beat poetry. Students in the course will study the major literary works that contributed to the Beat movement and develop projects using materials contained in the Beat Collection archived in USU Special Collections. This is a vast collection of small magazines, experimental publications, broadsides, limited-edition books, and Beat scholarship. The course will begin by looking at the Beat Collection and considering strategies for making use of it. Members of the class will then dedicate the next five weeks to reading a brief introduction to Beat culture, Jack Kerouac’s The Dharma Bums, and a sampling of works by other major Beat writers. The next five weeks will be spent selecting materials from the Beat Collection that will become the basis for a curated exhibit at Merrill-Cazier Library and a final paper. The final five weeks will be dedicated to the exhibit and the paper.\n\nENGL 6400/7400 (Online)\n\nAdvanced Editing\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7400 & will also meet face to face once a week)\n\nGrant-Davie, K. If you receive an advanced degree from this department, you will almost certainly need editing skills, no matter what you do next. This course is your chance to learn those skills or, if you already have editing experience, to sharpen and refine them. It will help you reevaluate your editing practices and how you justify them. We will practice and discuss many aspects of editing—from crafting language at the sentence level on up to shaping whole documents for rhetorical effect, organization and content, graphics, and document design. You will learn how to reread your writing productively and how to expand or condense it as needed.\n\nThe course is designed mainly for students in the online Master of Technical Communication program and for doctoral students in the Theory & Practice of Professional Communication program. The course materials will be biased towards tech/professional communication. Students from literary studies, creative writing, American Studies, or folklore are very welcome to take the course and should find it quite helpful. However, we will not address editing skills that are specific to creative writing, e.g., editing fiction for narrative pacing or plot development—skills that are better developed in an ENGL 6880 creative writing workshop course.\n\nAll students in ENGL 6400 and 7400 will meet online. Students in 7400 will also meet in person on the Logan campus each week, and students in 6400 are welcome to sit in on those meetings if they choose.\n\nWe will read the following two texts plus additional readings:\n\n● Rude, C. & Eaton, E. (2010). Technical editing (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson/Longman.\n\n● Williams, J. M. & Colomb, G. G. (2010). Style: Lessons in clarity and grace (10th ed.). Boston: Pearson/Longman.\n\nENGL 6440/7440\n\nAdvanced Seminar in Cultural and Professional Communication\n\nMaterialism>Remediation>Networks: How critical cultural theory (re)mediates communication\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7450 and will meet face to face once a week)\n\nOnline and Hybrid\n\nMoeller, R. In this Advanced Seminar in Culture and Professional Communication, we will study critical cultural theory for what it has to say about the ways we communicate and study communication across a variety of genres, technologies (media), and sites. We will begin with Benjamin’s seminal article, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1936), continue discussing materialist theory and play theory, and end with a comparison of Actor-Network Theory and Activity Theory by way of Spinuzzi’s Network (2010). Doctoral students will be exposed to a number of primary readings (Foucault and Deleuze & Guattari) and theories (materialism, remediation, network theory) that have demonstrated a lasting and profound impact on the fields of technical communication and rhetoric. Many of these readings will be appropriate for your Comprehensive Exams and Dissertations. Master’s students will be exposed to a number of theoretical texts that will inform your analyses of cultural artifacts, including Literature and Digital Media. Several former Master’s students have reported that this course has prepared them well for their work in PhD programs across the country.\n\nStudents will be responsible for weekly readings and discussions, including regular blog posts, Tweets, and wiki updates as well as a final seminar project that applies course materials and readings to their research sites.\n\nRequired texts:\n\n• Bolter, J.D. & Grusin, R. Remediation: Understanding New Media\n\n• Delueze, G. and Guattari, F. Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia\n\n• Dyer-Witheford, N. Cyber-Marx: Cycles and Circuits of Struggle in High Technology Capitalism\n\n• Foucault, M. Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison\n\n• McAllister, K.S.

Network: Theorizing Knowledge Work in Telecommunications\n\nENGL 6450/7450 (Online)\n\nReading Theory and Document Design\n\nUsing Publication Software to Design and Develop Documents\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7450 and will meet face to face once a week)\n\nHailey, D.\n\nThis is a seminar in document design using visual art, video, animation, and simulations. While the class will spend time discussing traditional document design and publication process, it will spend more time examining Information Architecture and Content Design and Management.\n\nENGL 6460/7460\n\nStudies in Digital Media\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7450 and will meet face to face once a week)\n\nHailey, D.\n\nThis class will examine digital media as a large topic. Students will be introduced to • History of publication in general.\n\n• History of digital publication.\n\n• Generalized overview of digital publication.\n\n• Overview of specifics in digital publication.\n\n• And overview of genres in digital publication.\n\nENGL/HIST 6720\n\nFolklore Fieldwork\n\nGabbert, L.\n\nThis course covers the basic skills needed to conduct beginning graduate-level fieldwork. Students will obtain hands-on experience with recording equipment, including cameras and digital recording kits. We will cover a variety of techniques and methods, including observation, participant-observation, and interviewing, as well as the recording of fieldnotes. In addition, we will cover fieldwork ethics and theorize the problems of IRB (Institutional Review Board/Human Subjects). Finally, we also will read several works that utilize fieldwork as a primary research tool. Students are required to complete a series of fieldwork assignments as well as a final paper.\n\nTexts:\n\nCashman, Ray. 2011. Storytelling on the Northern Irish Border: Characters and Community.

University of Texas Press.\n\nENGL 6770\n\nFolklore Seminar\n\nFolklore and the Bible\n\nSiporin, S. What many consider the most important book in the world, the Bible, is also one of the world’s richest compilations of folklore. The Bible contains “remnants of myths, of stories accounting for the origin of human customs and place-names, of family sagas, tribal legends, national epic, royal history, wisdom or morality tales, prophetic calls and missions, satires, parables, archival histories, and cultic stories.” Our task will be to explore what a folkloric perspective on the Bible can add to our understanding of its meaning.\n\nTexts:\n\n• The Bible, any edition.\n\n• Alan Dundes, Oral Lit as Holy Writ: The Bible as Folklore\n\n• Susan Niditch, Folklore and the Hebrew Bible\n\n• Robert Pinsky, The Life of David\n\n• David Grossman, Lion's Honey: The Myth of Samson\n\nENGL 6800/7800\n\nTheory and Practice of Online Education in Writing\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7800 and will also meet face to face once a week)\n\nOnline and Hybrid\n\nGrant-Davie, K.\n\nIf you’re planning a career in academia, it’s quite likely that at some point you will be assigned or given the opportunity to teach online. This course gives you the training to meet that challenge confidently. I have been teaching online since 2003 and have co-edited two books on the subject of online education in technical communication. We will read the more recent of the two as well as a selection of scholarly articles about online education. Your written assignments will lead you to raise and try to answer your own questions about online writing instruction (OWI) in settings ranging from K–12 to post-secondary to corporate training—depending on your background, needs, and interests. The class will be taught online, so it will offer you the opportunity to learn about online education experientially. These are some of the main questions that will drive the class:\n\nWhat range of forms can online education take, and what range of students does it serve?\n\nWhat is causing the spread of online education?\n\nHow do instructors need to change their roles and adapt their material and teaching methods as they move from face-to-face instruction to online instruction?\n\nWhat are the best practices for managing online classes and discussion forums effectively and efficiently?\n\nWhat learning theories underlie those best practices?\n\nWhat can instructors do to create presence and build community in their online classes?\n\nHow are technologies being used in online education?\n\nWhat options do instructors have for responding to student work and assessing it in online classes?\n\nWhat should instructors know about issues of ownership and plagiarism in online classes?\n\nWhat issues face instructors who not only teach online but also administer online writing programs?\n\nWe will read the following two texts plus additional readings:\n\n● Cargile Cook, K., & Grant-Davie, K. (Eds.) (2013). Online education 2.0: Evolving, adapting, and reinventing online technical communication. Amityville, NY: Baywood.\n\n● Boettcher, J. V., & Conrad, R.-M. (2010). The online teaching survival guide: Simple and practical pedagogical tips. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.\n\nStudents in 7400 will also read this text:\n\n● Palloff, R. M., & Pratt, K. (2011). The excellent online instructor: Strategies for professional development. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.\n\nENGL 6810\n\nIntroduction to Composition Studies\n\nKinkead, J. This course focuses on the scholarship of writing studies. Students become acquainted with scholars, forums, themes, and methods of the field. We will also be engaging in hands-on work, developing research projects that can come to fruition by semester’s end. In previous classes, students' projects have been professionally presented or published. Another goal is to review writing studies programs evident across the nation as well as the writing about writing movement. Additionally, we will discuss the undergraduate research imperative and its integration in writing studies and how as teachers we can work with students on research in writing studies. Teaching composition, naturally, will also be a discussion topic. In sum, the seminar addresses both theory and practice coupled with pragmatic information about the field (e.g., professional organizations, conferences, and journals.\n\nENGL 6883\n\nPoetry Writing Workshop\n\nGunsberg, B. This graduate-level course is designed to help you become better writers and readers of poetry by exposing you to a wide range of poetry written by your peers and by established authors. I’m pleased to report that a number of the published poets we will read have agreed to join us via Skype for our discussion of their books. Our conversations will revolve around craft, which means we will explore time-honored categories and techniques as well as more recent developments in the field. Similar to other “workshop” courses, this course offers many opportunities for you to share your work in small and large groups. You are expected to comment generously on your classmates’ poems both in writing and during class discussion. In this way, you will cultivate a personal aesthetic and expand the breadth of your critical vocabulary. Beyond writing and revising individual poems on a weekly basis, you will give a short presentation, and assemble a final portfolio consisting of your most successful writing. Because this is a graduate course, I expect you to submit 3-5 of these poems to a literary journal before the conclusion of the semester.\n\nCourse\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nENGL 6350\n\nAmerican Literature and Culture, Women's Literary Traditions: Distilling Amazing Sense from Ordinary Meanings\n\nGraulich, M. This course will explore 19th- and 20th-century feminist writers and artists who focus on domestic women’s arts such as quilting, gardening, cooking as valuable modes of self-expression and communication. We will read works by Sarah Orne Jewett, Dorothy Canfield (Fisher), Eliza Calvert Hall, Faith Ringgold, Alice Walker, Rebecca Harding Davis, and Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. We will also read many works by Mary Wilkins Freeman and Emily Dickinson, readily available online. Readings will also include theoretical works by Alice Walker, Bettina Apheker, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Elaine Showalter, Elaine Hedges, and myself, as well as poems, stories, and essays by many other women. Visual artists include quiltmakers, sampler embroiderers, hair wreath makers, Edmonia Lewis, Lilly Martin Spencer, Mary Hallock Foote, Mary Cassatt, Cecelia Beaux, Georgia O’Keeffe, Judy Chicago, and Faith Ringgold. Requirement will include discussion leading, a few very short essays to share with classmates, a long seminar paper. I am very flexible about genres: memoir, personal essay, story quilts, etc. Everyone will be required to make a quilt square as well. This class will require a number of handouts as well as specific editions of texts; please get the proper editions but several of these are available used and inexpensive online. Contact Dr. Graulich directly at melody.graulich@usu.edu for the booklist.\n\nENGL 6360\n\nWorld Literature and Culture: Magical Realizm in World Fiction\n\nGraham, S. In the mode of writing known as \"magical realism,\" fantastic or supernatural elements are introduced into a story, only to become an accepted and mundane part of the social world of the fiction. We will explore first the origins of magical realist fiction, and then the ways in which the mode of magical realism has been put to use by English-language writers from Africa and South Asia. Our reading list will include the following novels: Gabriel García Márquez, One Hundred Years of Solitude; Isabel Allende, Eva Luna; Salman Rushdie, Midnight's Children; Zakes Mda, The Heart of Redness; and Helen Oyeyemi, White is for Witching. We will read short stories and essays by Franz Kafka, Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier, Julio Cortázar, Amos Tutuola, and Ben Okri. And we will encounter critical and theoretical essays from the reader Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community and elsewhere.\n\nAmong the questions we will try to answer this semester: How does magical realism respond to, mimic, or depart from naturalism and social realism? What is the relationship between magical realism and Modernism, Postmodernism, and postcoloniality? Why does magical realism so often seem to arise at the same time that nations wrestle with authoritarian states and/or experience civil strife? What distinguishes magical realism from science fiction or fantasy? What distinguishes it from expressions of religious or cosmological belief?\n\nENGL 6410/7410\n\nTheory and Research in Professional Communication\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7410 & will also meet face to face once a week)\n\nOnline and Hybrid\n\nWalton, R. This course will introduce you to many of the major contemporary theories of written discourse that influence research in professional communication. We will explore how communication has been differently defined and circumscribed and why these differences matter to people who study and produce writing in the workplace. You will develop a deep, complex understanding of the field of professional communication by reading seminal works on the history of the field, value of technical and professional communication, ethical and social responsibilities of professional communicators, research questions driving the field, and professional communication skills. We will explore questions such as, “How do practitioners understand their roles in ways both similar to and different from scholars? How do our perceptions of what texts are and how they function in organizational life affect the ways we enact our roles as practitioners and scholars? How are professional communicators implicated within wider systems inside and outside organizations? What kinds of questions do researchers in professional communication ask, and how do those questions affect the outcome of research?” To convey your developing knowledge of the field, you will create a verbal and visual representation of the broader field, as well as an in-depth exploration of a particular topic that is of central concern to the field of professional communication and is relevant to your own interests as a scholar and/or practitioner.\n\nENGL 6420/7420\n\nUsability Studies and Human Factors in Professional Communication: User Experience Design\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7420 & will also meet face to face once a week)\n\nOnline and Hybrid\n\nHailey, D I plan to teach effectiveness in instruction and training. Students will examine texts on online training and instruction from an historical perspective, beginning with the early arguments about online instruction but including approaches that have proven affective. One of these approaches will be ProcessPreservation, a specialized heuristic developed by me for capturing critical skills for archiving, quality control, and just-in-time training. For more information, please contact Professor Hailey directly at david.hailey@usu.edu .\n\nCourse: ENGL 6470/7470\n\nStudies in Specialized Documents\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7470 & will also meet face to face once a week)\n\nOnline and Hybrid\n\nHailey, D. I plan to have the class explore the impact of HTML5 and CSS3 on contemporary publication. The exploration will include examining code in HTML5 and IPUB3, which is HTML5 in eBook format. For more information, please contact Professor Hailey directly at david.hailey@usu.edu .\n\nENGL 6480/7480\n\nStudies in Technology and Writing: Digital Rhetoric and New Media\n\n(PhD students sign up for 7480 and will meet face to face once a week)\n\nColton, J.\n\nThis class offers an introduction to the relationships among technology, rhetoric, culture, and writing, with a specific emphasis on digital and “new” media. The emergence of digital composition and new media networks has brought into question the usability of traditional rhetorical concepts. For example, once defined as only the gestures accompanying the speech of a rhetor, delivery now includes the technological medium of expression. We have moved from traditional terms such as “the rhetorical situation” (speaker-audience-exigency-constraints) to posthumanist frameworks interested in rhetorical circulation and velocity, where digital file formatting is considered a rhetorical choice anticipating how text, video, and images will be circulated, sampled, and remixed by others. As researchers of technical communication and rhetoric, we must take into account the important role of these new media and digital writing practices. This course will question assumptions of culturally neutral or value-free narratives of technology, whether celebratory, determinist, or somewhere in between. We will develop critical vocabulary and knowledge of the ethical, historical, political, and social contexts that influence our everyday use of these technologies.\n\nENGL/HIST 6700\n\nFolklore Theory and Methods\n\nMcNeill, L.\n\nWhat do Slender Man, jump rope rhymes, Little Red Riding Hood, bathroom graffiti, Grumpy Cat, and funeral potatoes all have in common? They're all folklore! How is it possible to study so many diverse and awesome things within a single academic field? Take this course and find out. We'll be discussing the history of folklore studies as an academic discipline (an exciting global journey through the fields of anthropology, literature, linguistics, and history), the definition of folklore (definitely not as simple as you might think), and some major theories and approaches to understanding forms of cultural expression that are often overlooked (and undervalued) by other disciplines.\n\nENGL/HIST 6740\n\nFolk Narrative\n\nSiporin, S.\n\nA genre approach to oral literature, focusing on the folktale, legend, ballad, and epic, as well as non-European genres. The methods are: comparative, structural, psychoanalytical, and ethnographic. Plan on significant amounts of reading, writing, listening, and talking.\n\nENGL 6760/4760\n\nFolk Material Culture\n\nGantt, P. This class explores the unique worlds of southern material culture and the individuals or groups who create it. It also expands on southern material culture to analyze that of other regions. We will examine questions such as: What differences are there between art and craft? What forms does material culture take? Who are the artists who make it? Under what circumstances is it created? What does it mean to its creators? How does it provide insight into the many cultures of a changing region or nation? How does it signify in the larger culture? How does it relate to our own worlds?\n\nENGL 6820\n\nPracticum in Teaching English\n\nDethier, B.\n\nThis course is designed specifically for graduate instructors teaching English 1010. It focuses on the theory and practice of teaching writing but also prepares graduate instructors for further teaching responsibilities. We schedule it for two class periods, but the second period is usually reserved for outside speakers and special presentations. Participants complete some of the English 1010 assignments as well as a final synthesis paper, and they share some of their best ideas in a half-hour presentation to the class. Required of all new English graduate instructors and must be taken with the pre-semester Orientation.\n\nENGL 6884\n\nCreative Nonfiction: Flash Nonfiction Workshop\n\nSinor, J. In this graduate creative writing workshop, we will be focusing on the short form. After studying examples of flash literary nonfiction and exploring the elements of the subgenre, we will spend the majority of our time in writing workshop where students will submit their essays and give and receive feedback. By the end of the semester, students will have produced a chapbook of linked flash nonfiction, bound by theme, inventive in form, and at least twenty-five pages in length. Along the way, we will address formal and informal research, lyric structure, and compression of narrative. For those interested in writing long-form essays, we will consider ways to weave shorter pieces into longer essays, chapters, or even thesis projects."
