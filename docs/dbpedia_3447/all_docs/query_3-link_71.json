        "text": "The New Faces of Abortion Rights\n\nDemocrats used to talk about abortion in abstract terms. Now Harris campaign volunteers are getting specific and changing the debate.\n\nHow Kamala Harris Became Bigger than Donald Trump\n\nSince taking over the top of the Democratic ticket, the Vice-President has closed the gap in the polls, broken fund-raising records, and given Democrats something to be excited about.\n\nNancy Pelosi’s Art of Power\n\nThe former Speaker discusses how she hastened Joe Biden’s decision to drop out, her new memoir, and not getting “doggy doo-doo on your shoe.”\n\n“Weird” Is a Rebuke to Republican Dominance Politics\n\nThe Democrats’ new favorite attack line has less to do with their opponents’ distance from the norm than with their desired level of control.\n\nThe Front Row\n\n“It Ends with Us” Showcases Blake Lively’s Wry Grandeur\n\nThis romantic adaptation of a novel by Colleen Hoover, about a businesswoman confronting a legacy of abuse, channels the moods and styles of Hollywood melodramas.\n\nOn Television\n\n“House of the Dragon” Still Hasn’t Caught Fire\n\nThe HBO show’s latest season finale reaffirms Rhaenyra’s right to rule—but her mode of noble restraint, however admirable in a leader, is lethal in a protagonist.\n\nCultural Comment\n\nHow “The Boyfriend” Distills Gay Romance\n\nThe Japanese dating show captures friendship, heartbreak, and the perils of having a hot roommate.\n\nMusical Events\n\nTwo Centuries Later, a Female Composer Is Rediscovered\n\nCarolina Uccelli’s opera “Anna di Resburgo” was remarkably inventive—but it vanished after its première. Teatro Nuovo has brought it back to life.\n\nBooks\n\nDeals with the Devil Aren’t What They Used to Be\n\nTales of Faust’s bargain teased and consoled an earlier culture with the lure of freedom, the promise of a wider world. But Hell is everywhere now.\n\nThe Art World\n\nThe Bad Dream of Surrealism\n\nA hundred years ago, the movement hoped to topple reality and reason. Its true achievements lie elsewhere.\n\nEpisode 1: The Green Grass\n\nA man in Haditha, Iraq, has a request for the In the Dark team: Can you investigate how my family was killed?\n\nEpisode 2: I Have Questions\n\nA trip to a Marine Corps archive reveals a clue about something that the U.S. military is keeping secret.\n\nEpisode 3: Sounds Like Murder\n\nWe travel around the U.S. to find the Marines who were on the ground in Haditha on the day of the killings.\n\nEpisode 4: What They Saw\n\nTwo conflicting stories about what happened that day emerge—one from the Marines involved in the killings, and another from a very different perspective.\n\nTwo Paths for Jewish Politics\n\nIn America, Jews pioneered a way of life that didn’t rely on the whims of the powerful. Now it’s under threat.\n\nHow a Rare Disorder Makes People See Monsters\n\nA mysterious neurological condition makes faces look grotesque—and sheds new light on the inner workings of the brain.\n\nShould We Abolish Prisons?\n\nOur carceral system is characterized by frequent brutality and ingrained indifference. Finding a better way requires that we freely imagine alternatives.\n\nHow Christian Fundamentalism Was Born Again\n\nNearly a century ago, a single trial seemed to shatter the movement’s place in America. It’s returned in a new form—but for old reasons."
