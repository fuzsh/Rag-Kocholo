        "text": "Bridie, you’re a millennial – tell me about your socks\n\nOh Gabs, you could ask me what beauty I saw in the world on this glorious blue sky morning, or how my relationship is with my mother, or what rage is in my heart. But no, everyone wants to talk about millennial socks.\n\nI actually wear great socks. Heavily influenced by my little brother, I’ve worn Uniqlo crew socks for years. Which are actually “zoomer socks”. But I have loved ankle socks as well, and that is the foghorn that signals I’m a millennial, apparently.\n\nSign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning\n\nWait, I’m just trying to wrap my head around the concept of “millennial socks” – which you now tell me are just ankle socks – and now you’ve introduced the concept of “zoomer socks”. Are they merely coloured crew socks or is there more to it?\n\nMillennial socks are small socks that stop at the ankle, or even the ones you can’t see at all above the shoe (I loved these!). Zoomer socks are generally crew socks – any sock pulled up high. They invented them (citation needed). Also, I think they’re actually called gen Z socks – my beloved zoomer colleagues are always telling me that only millennials say zoomer.\n\nOK, so millennials love ankle socks – good to know. But why is Jennifer Lawrence being called “brave” by Vogue for stepping out in “millennial socks”?\n\nAh, I think because one of the most tragic things you can be in some corners of the internet is a woman in her 30s dressing herself with no regard for a trend.\n\nOh no, what about a woman in her 40s?\n\nI don’t believe they exist.\n\nSo, ahem, the long and short of it is that gen Z have pulled their socks up?\n\nHa! They’ve also moved their hair part to the middle, millennials favour the side part. And they’re wearing enormous pants – skinny jeans are definitely out. Also high-waisted jeans are a millennial relic. Gen Z are wearing pants that hang off their hips.\n\nWait, I wore pants that hung off my hips!\n\nSsshh, ssshhhh. This is the first time in history that any of this is cool. And it will stay cool for ever. There definitely won’t be articles in 10 years calling a 35-year-old zoomer “brave” for wearing crew socks."
