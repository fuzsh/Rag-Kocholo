        "text": "Full disclosure time...I've known and absolutely adored Timothy Eades for nearly 2 decades now...all the way back to a time when he was a mild mannered #CMO. So trust me when I tell you...he knows his stuff and the issue that he's raising in this interview is massive. Give it a watch...and then...go ask your CISO if you can help harden the identity and access posture for those autonomous agents you've been deploying ... https://lnkd.in/gvxMtMdd\n\nNEWSLETTER DAAAAYYYYYY!!!!! This time, get the scoop on our avalanche of vendor goodness known as Constellation ShortLists (I know the name is mysterious...but they are literally a short list of contenders in critical buying sectors...get it. Short. Lists.) Some deets on our latest executive network gathering, the #AI Forum...first one is September 23 in NYC. Lots to peep this week. You know what to do with that link down below...\n\nNEWS: NICE names Scott Russell CEO This isn't just an interesting move for NICE...picking up deep enterprise experience and contacts from corporate buying centers that are sometimes not deeply involved in buying contact center tech...but also for Russell...having spent his career in 3-letter powerhouses like IBM, pWc and SAP, a smaller company with the power to grow will be an exciting time for the revenue vet. #CCaaS will be a new space and the challenges across the market present interesting opportunities as contact center looks to play a far more strategic role in #CX as opposed to remaining an operational cost center. The entire market is navigating waters that threaten to topple players that can't make the move from \"selling AI #chatbots\" to transforming business processes with automation, #AI and connection into the larger growth-driving experience. One thing is for sure, Russell is going to bring new energy to NICE, a company with a truly unique culture. Gonna be fun to watch. (PS: Poor Scott probably thought he didn't have to deal with my CX questions at Analyst conferences any more after SAP. Don't tell him quite yet, OK?)"
