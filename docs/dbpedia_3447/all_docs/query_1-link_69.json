        "text": "3/5 stars\n\nProlific Japanese provocateur Sion Sono revisits a number of his favourite themes, including murder, mayhem and manipulation in sprawling epic The Forest of Love. Inspired by a series of real-life murders in the late 1990s, the film follows a group of impressionable young misfits, who fall under the spell of Kippei Shiina’s charismatic con artist.\n\nMitsuko (Eri Kamataki) and Taeko (Kyoko Hinami) are former classmates, estranged after a high school tragedy, who are reunited when they are coerced into shooting a movie for aspiring filmmakers Shin (Shinnosuke Mitsushima), Jay (Young Dais), and Fukami (Dai Hasegawa).\n\nAfter Joe Murata (Shiina), a sadistic middle-aged shyster, attempts to seduce the timid Mitsuko, the silk-tongued Svengali quickly inserts himself into the group, wrests control of the production, and forces them all into a life of crime and violent submission.\n\nBeneath Sono’s endlessly lurid veneer lurks a cautionary tale of vulnerable youth and fractured families, but, as the heir presumptive to Takashi Miike’s extreme indie throne, the director has always favoured sensationalism over substance.\n\nThat said, Sono’s chaotic world of idealistic adolescents, untrustworthy authority figures, and an endless parade of blood-spattered schoolgirls is disarmingly infectious for those who can stomach copious sex, dismemberment, and histrionic intimidation.\n\nThe Forest of Love offers a dizzying kaleidoscope of outrageous imagery and tangled flashbacks that will reward attentive viewers but may just as easily prove insufferable to the uninitiated or ill-prepared.\n\nEven at two-and-a-half hours, the chaotic narrative feels rushed and curtailed, especially in the second half, as Sono hurtles towards a great reveal sure to surprise nobody who has been paying attention.\n\nNext week sees an extended series-length “Deep Cut” of the film arrive on Netflix, promising, one suspects, yet more carnage and debauchery, but hopefully a little depth and clarity for good measure.\n\nThe Forest of Love is streaming on Netflix.\n\nWant more articles like this?
