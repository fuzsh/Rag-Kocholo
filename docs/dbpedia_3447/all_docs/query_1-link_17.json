        "text": "July 15 – August 20, 2023\n\nSheryl and Harvey White Theatre\n\nConrad Prebys Theatre Center\n\nGlobe-commissioned world premiere\n\nBy Gordon Greenberg and Steve Rosen\n\nDirected by Gordon Greenberg\n\nDostoevsky’s turn-of-the-century masterpiece is reimagined as a 90-minute romp of a morality tale, performed by five ridiculously talented actors who play over 50 zany characters, riffing on the famous novel—and all of Russian literature. The brilliant comic team of Gordon Greenberg and Steve Rosen (Ebenezer Scrooge’s BIG San Diego Christmas Show) brings to 1860s Russia the same whacked-out sensibility they gave to Dickens in this world-premiere, Globe-commissioned comedy. This classic story follows Raskolnikov, an impoverished student who becomes a murderer in order to save his family. Based on the book you didn’t actually read in high school, this is literature retold like you’ve never seen it before.\n\nCrime and Punishment, A Comedy contains mild language, discussion of violence, and herbal cocoa shell cigarettes. There are brief moments of strobe lighting and loud noise.\n\nTotal running time: One hour and 30 minutes (one act with no intermission).\n\nDigital Program\n\nDownload the program PDF\n\nCrime and Punishment, A Comedy is supported by major production sponsors Pamela Farr and Buford Alexander, Paula and Brian Powers, and Vicki and Carl Zeiger; production sponsors Carol and George Lattimer, Jean and Gary Shekhter, Pamela J. Wagner and Hans Tegebo; and artist sponsor Leonard Hirsch (for co-playwright and director Gordon Greenberg).\n\nVicki and Carl Zeiger Insights Seminar: Tuesday, July 18 at 6:00 p.m."
