        "text": "Waggoner Library sponsors a Young Adult Book Club for the students of Trevecca.\n\nWe will be choosing YA books each semester and reading them together and then meeting for discussion and analysis.\n\nThis is an informal time of dialog, discussion, and learning!\n\nThis semester, members will choose a genre for the next meeting and pick their own book/short story within that genre. Some may choose to read the same title, but is is not required. We also discuss other recent reads, recommended books, unrecommended books, and other book-adjacent topics!\n\nCome and join us!\n\nFor more information please contact Katie O'Connell at kaoconnell@trevecca.edu or 615-248-1339!\n\nCheck here for meeting updates and other important information, or contact Katie O'Connell to be added to the GroupMe group.\n\nSpring 2024 Book Club\n\nAfter a semester in exile due to renovations, we have returned to the library building!\n\nWe meet every other Thursday from 4:30-5:45 in Room 135 unless otherwise specified. To get there, turn RIGHT when entering the main library doors on the main (middle) floor of the library, and go down the hallway like you're headed to the restrooms. Room 135 will be on your right.\n\nCome join us!\n\nJanuary 18 25: Theme: Books read over break/received for Christmas.\n\nFebruary 1: Theme: Fantasy\n\nFebruary 15: Theme: Books published in or before 1965. See here (FB) or here (IG) for some ideas!\n\nFebruary 29: Theme: Relationships (friendship, romantic, familial, other)\n\nMarch 14: Theme: Historical fiction\n\nApril 4: (Note: 3 week gap instead of 2!) Theme: Green covers\n\nApril 18: Last meeting of the semester. Book exchange! Bring a book wrapped up, unwrap someone else's, and hope that no one steals it before the game is over. Bring your friends, the ones who weren't sure about the idea of a book club, because parties are more fun with more people!\n\nAlternative discussion questions: What's a book you think everyone should read, and why? What makes you want to reread a book? What's your favorite trope(s)? How do you feel about movie/tv adaptations in general? Are there any you like more than the book? What's something that is so unrealistic it'll throw you out of the story? If you were going to write (or look for) a fanfic of X story, what type of fic would it be?"
