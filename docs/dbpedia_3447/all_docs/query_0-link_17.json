After her death, Yeardley’s friends and family were stunned to learn that 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men will be in an abusive relationship in their lifetime. Young women ages 16-24 are at 3X greater risk and have limited awareness of that fact. One Love exists because Yeardley was killed and her death was avoidable. Today, we work to ensure that everyone has information about unhealthy and abusive relationships that Yeardley, her friends and her family did not. Our work focuses on delivering information in a language young people can hear so that they can seek help before an abusive relationship escalates to violence. We use research-based information about the stages of unhealthy relationships and abuse, using language that resonates with young people. Our content meets young people where they're at using powerful content to show realistic portrayals of their lives. We want everyone to understand the danger in these types of relationships and empower them to leave an unhealthy situation—or help a friend leave—before it escalates to abuse. Young people who know the facts and who are empowered to help themselves and their friends will ultimately save lives.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.joinonelove.org\n\nExternal link for One Love Foundation\n\nIndustry\n\nNon-profit Organization Management\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nLutherville-Timonium 21093, Maryland\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n2010\n\nSpecialties\n\nhealthy relationships, unhealthy relationships, abusive relationships, emotional abuse, physical abuse, verbal abuse, healthy friendships, mental health, emotional health, and youth education"
