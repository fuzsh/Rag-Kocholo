I guess you didn't notice

We're not okay

I don't wanna be in love

I don't wanna be in love this way

Comin' in to focus

I see in your eye

You don't know the feeling of

You don't know the feeling I have inside

One way lover

Tick tock, do you want more time?

Or do I need your lovin' (hope not) more than you need mine?

Got a lotta questions

I don't wanna ask

'Cause you never know what answer might

Never know what answer might be the last

I gave all I had to give

That became what I was asked to give away

Your conviction, ooh, it's grave

It's a love crime, and love crime does not pay

In case you didn't notice

I'm not your slave

I don't wanna be in love

I don't wanna be in love that way

Going through the motions

Like everything's fine

You don't know the meaning of

You don't know the meaning of you and I

One way lover

Tick tock, do you want more time?

Or do I need your lovin' (hope not) more than you need mine?

Don't even gotta wonder

There's somebody else

Woulda been better off

I'da been better off by my self

And I gave all I had to give

That became what I was asked to give away

Your conviction, ooh, it's grave

It's a love crime

You'd do hard time

I should have you locked away

And I gave all I had to give

That became what I was asked to give away

Your conviction, ooh, it's grave

It's a love crime, and love crime does not pay
