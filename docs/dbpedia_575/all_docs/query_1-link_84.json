        "text": "Identifying priority areas for conservation is a widely-used approach to allocate limited resources to achieve desired conservation outcomes. While selection algorithms have become popular methods for designing networks of conservation areas, support is often insufficient to protect all proposed sites. A recent ecoregional assessment in the Gulf of California identified critical conservation sites to protect biodiversity in this region. Here we build on this foundation of conservation planning work to identify a path forward from conservation prioritization to conservation action, bringing conservation priorities to a management scale. We prioritize areas for conservation action at two scales (within and among sites) using a combination of conservation planning tools, including: 1) a transparent approach that relies on the comparison of irreplaceability and vulnerability scores among the 54 conservation sites, and 2) expert opinion in distilling biodiversity goals into eight habitat...\n\nExcerpt from Executive Summary: The south-central coast of California is home to a globally unique array of natural resources, diverse wildlife, varied landscapes and unmatched human amenities…In a first sense, the Regional Conservation Guide (RCG) you are reading is a catalog of our natural assets and a call for greater understanding of their needs. More importantly, this Regional Conservation Guide represents a unique tool we hope will assist in community planning efforts to secure our natural heritage while seeing to the needs of our human communities…The Guide draws on a wealth of locally-produced biological data, guided by proven concepts of conservation biology to depict, for the first time, what would be needed to assure that future generations enjoy – and are sustained by – a thriving ecosystem with a healthy complement of wildlife, landscapes and natural resources…We believe the Guide contributes… an overall conservation vision to engage stewardship, guide action and empowe..."
