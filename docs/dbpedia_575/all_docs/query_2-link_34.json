San Diego, California TO MY PARENTS / Heman Chandler Orcutt and Eliza Eastin Gray-Orcutt and to Former Friends and Correspondents Engelmann: Gray: Parry: Vasey: Watson Names Inseparable from American Plants This Volume is Dedicated In Memoriam. 614146 PREFACE. With the completion of volume two of American Plants, the editor may perhaps be pardoned for presenting a few words regarding the plan and reason for producing the work. The plan was to index every work of importance on West American botany, and to print a description of every genus, species, variety or form credited to the state of California. As far as possible it was desired to reprint in each case the earliest published description, not only of species generally considered valid, but also of those published that have since been relegated to synonymy — however remote might be the chances of reviving to specific rank. It was also desired to collect all scattered notes, supplemental to the original descriptions, or pertaining to geographical distribution, economic value, synonymy, citing place of publication or the authority for each. Volumes one and two were intended to cover these features for the flora of the southern counties, but the reader will still find the ideal far from realized. Many works yet remain to be consulted and many species must be added to the enumeration here given. The editor hopes to con- tinue until all that has been published relative to the California flora is fully indexed, and all valid species described. Nearly half the work is now published, and much of the balance is in MS. May the errors of omission or commission in this volume be corrected in the next.

Lippincott.) [The following, revised by the editor, is taken from a pamphlet pub- lished in 1874 by the Chamber of Commerce of the City of San Diego.] The vegetation of San Diego presents an extraordinary appearance to the visitor from the northern and eastern states, and, if he be possessed of scientific proclivities, will prove exceedingly interesting. Should he ar- rive in December, his attention will be early arrested by the peculiar mild- ness and the even range of temperature, which, permits the continued blooming of many plants, and the appearance of flowers, whose congeners he is accustomed to find greeting the early spring in his eastern home. The equable character of the temperature through December, January and Feb- ruary is strikingly expressed in dormant condition of sundry incipient flowers, which, having advanced to the condition of colored buds, await through the three months named for a few warmer days in which to evolve their colors. One of the most remarkable of tnese is a caper-like plant (Isomeris arborea), which early in December exhibits a sparse bloom, and continues to labor under the difficulties of its condition, making no advance until March, when a few degrees of additional heat open its fine yellow flow- ers, and soon its large inflated brown seed-vessels appear at the extremi- ties of the long protruded pistils. The earliest plant which appears upon the lower bench or mesa, is a saxifrage (Saxifraga Parryi). This, like its eastern sisters, leads the floral throng, and blooms in December [or earlier, with the first showers of winter,] but unlike them enjoys the advantage of a tuberous root — a neces- sary aid for preserving its life during the long droughts of summer. Draw- ing sustenance from a depth of from four to six inches, it sends up its long, slender scape, and pale diminutive flowers, but anchored below, resists the unfavorable agencies that would destroy every eastern saxifrage, though accustomed to meagre fare, and taking fast hold in \"the clefts of the rocks.\" In the sunny exposures in the arroyas occurs a shrub (Eriogonum fasciculatum), which, in December, adorns its sprays of fine cut foliage with heads of small, white flowers. For many weeks no others, except the above named, are conspicuous in uncultivated grounds. Soon a bright yel- low flower (OEnothera) hugs the soil, which it adorns with its bright stars, and a yellow violet, its petals shaded on the back with a rich brown, and 402 its throat marked with dark lines, throws up its long peduncles from its leafy prostrate stem. Over the clumps of laurel-sumac (Rhus laurina) soon begin to trail the long green stems of the chilicothe (Megarrhiza Calif ornica), with its racemes of white flowers. This extraordinary plant is possessed of a vast storehouse of supplies, and appears to be capable of enduring a siege through years of drought. Its corm is a solid fleshy mass, often exceeding the size of a bushel measure, and to the taste, intensely bit- ter. From this mass the long stems arise annually, and adorn large clumps of shrubbery with their green palmate leafage, and on the pistillate plant are developed, in March, the green spiny cucumbers. A few days appear, bringing increase of heat, and life leaps upward, bloom and beauty increase around us, and the purple blossoms of the al- filerilla or Spanish pin clover (Erodium) appear. This plant presents the aspect of a flattened tuft of fine cut leaves pressed to the ground [often in- fested with a deep red fungus, resembling clots of blood.] Another species, where the soil is good, produces a heavy crop of leafage, upon which the horses, cattle and sheep of southern California are pastured. Intermixed with the alfilarilla appear the slender, succulent stems and narrow spatulate leaves of the Calandrinia Menziesii, allied to the spring beauty of the eastern states. This plant often spreads over wide areas, adorned by its small magenta flowers peeping from amid the bright green of its leaves, and, in favorable situations, after heavy rains, it puts on a magnificent aspect, standing a foot or more in height, and, massing its brilliant coloring, rivals the glory of a bed of portulacca, to which it is closely allied. As the vegetation of this region is influenced by the elevation and ex- posure it may be described more clearly by marking the changes as we rise from the bay shore to the distant height*. At the lowest levels, over which the highest tides flow, salt grasses and other maritime plants appear, and on the clay soil, elevated but little above the reach of tides, the ice plant abounds. The leaves are brilliant with a rich setting of gem-like vesicles filled to the utmost with saline juices, and cover the surface of the ground with their varied masses of green and purple, and bright with starry flowers. A walk over acres of these singular plants saturates one's boot-soles, and the sportive pedestrian, with but moderate effort, may slide upon the slip- pery surface. Another plant, producing leaves of the shape, thickness and length of one's finger, but triangular in section, abounds on the sand dunes of the neighboring isthmus of San Diego, where its long trailing stems, beset at short intervals with its unique leaves and large red-fringed radiant flowers, are interesting to the most casual and least informed observer. On the bay sides of these dunes occurs Rhus integrifolia, which, with its heads of white and roseate small daphne-like, inodorous flowers, thick coriaceous leaves and strong growth, forms a highly ornamental shrub. This plant again oc- curs on the high mesa, near the city, and in Paradise valley it becomes a tree of respectable size, as does also, to the surprise of the eastern bota- nists, a species of elder (Sambucus glauca). An ericaceous heath-like shrub is abundant on the lower levels, and has put on the thick succulent character of saline plants, though generally possessed of a dry and coria- ceous leaf. This plant delights to grow upon the extreme borders of the bluffs, and to hang its stiff branches over the low clay banks that bound the bay shore. More remote, but not far distant from the water, the lower levels are delicately tinged with the light rose purple flowers of the Gilia dianthoides, with the magenta-flamed Orthocarpus purpurascens, sprinkled with the del- icate white stars of Krynitzkias, and two varieties of the humble Plantago Patagonica. Over the bright green of these bay-side pastures appear broad spreading growths of purple-fruited pepper grass (Lepidium), which from a position slightly elevated, appear like cloud-shadows flecking the surface of the brighter verdure. On hill-sides in Paradise valley we have seen masses of the unique and beautifnl Dodecatheon standing a foot high, hanging their pink and white banners with a singular abandon, so diverse in character and coloring from the eastern species. Clumps of Rhus laurina now appear, so unlike in aspect from the east- ern sumac, their feet tangled by masses of Phacelia tanacetifolia and Mira- bilis California, or adorned by the trailing stems and broad palmate leaves of Megarrhiza Californica, already referred to as among the earliest blossoms. The alfilerilla now occurs more frequently, and, in the absence of grasses, forming a thick mat, gemmed with its small pink flowers, blooming through the winter far into the spring; and however dwarf they may have remained through poverty of sustenance, invariably, if not too closely cropped, put on at length their obliquely-arranged tufts of crane-billed seed vessels. The long slender divisions of this crane-bill are wound spirally upon the carpophores, and, when ripe, they are still more violently twisted, perhaps by hygrometric absorption and drawing the seed from its seat, lifts it aloft radiantly from the center of support, and offer it a prey to the winnowing winds, which scatter it far and near. The lovely little Gilia dianthoides spreads its carnation-colored, fringed petals to our admiring gaze, covering the ground with its delicate tints of fairy beauty. A few ranunculaceous plants appear, among them an indigo-blue larkspur, but no showy yellow buttercups adorn the mead. Here the small Linaria Canadensis lifts its dark blue flowers, and Calandrinia Menziesii, with brilliant red petals, stars the greenery of its sur- roundings. The caper shrub, already referred to, soon appears, and clumps of arte- misia, with fine-cut leaves, become more abundant. The Spanish dagger (Yucca Mojavensis), flat-leaved cactus or prickly pear, and the club cactus or cholla, become more abundant as we leave the bay or descend into shel- tered arroyas or dry water courses. In Cholla valley, the most remarkable of these protected localities, the cholla cactus (Opuntia prolifera) attains a height of 6 feet, and forms large clumps of impenetrable chapparal. The cactus frequently gives place to abundant growths of shrubs, among them Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus, Rhus and Eriodyction; over these frequently trail the long vine of a pea, which hangs out its grand racemes of large crimson blossoms. A brilliant purple lupine appears at the foot of stony cliffs. Pale astragalus, with bladder-like legumes, occur at intervals, and a large red-flowered monkey-plant (Mimulus), adorns the dry arroyas; while the roadway is often lined with dense and tall growths of a bright yellow-flowered Amsinckia, which encroaches upon the wheat fields of this fertile vale. Such is the scene in March. In April new flowers appear; among the more beautiful, sheltered among the bushes, are Collinsia bicolor, two species of monkey-plants, the fuchsia-flowered gooseberry, and other an- nuals or perennial flowers. The yucca, in favored situations, displays a magnificent mass of rich purple buds and creamy lilies, bursting into beauty from amidst its forbidding clusters of dagger-pointed leaves. On stony slopes the low spherical Echinocactus, and a Cereus, occasionally appear. On these middle heights above the bay the ground is often yellow with a bright OEnothera, and the yellow violet, intermingled with the pale tint of the wild onion, and blue liliaceous plants, among which Biodiaea capitata is conspicuous; while composite flowers, such as Senecio California and Pen- tachaeta aurea, cover thousands of acres. The botanist can scarcely take a step without treading upon a plant un- known to him in his eastern fields. Now he stops to gaze with admiration upon the spread of Dodecatheon, or to throw up his hands with delight as 404 he pauses beside a half acre of California poppies, which at midday resem- bles beaten gold, the most brilliant and the most fascinating of California flowers. Nature is here in her loveliest mood, and robed in her brightest col- ors. She has spread her tapestries until they rival the gorgeous carpets of Persian looms, and has hung the hillsides in draperies that outshine Bluff King Harry's \"Field of the Cloth of Gold.\" o CONIFEROUS TREES AND SHRUBBERY OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY. California is the native home of many stately forest trees, among them being the giant redwood or Sequoia gigantea — the largest tree known in the world, though Australia produces in her Eucalyptus the tallest on record. Many of the most beautiful known evergreens are natives of the Golden State, and a very fair proportion occur within the present restricted area of San Diego county. The following is a brief list of the cone-bearing trees credited to San Diego county, with some brief references to more extended dscriptions.

Confined to the eastern slopes of the mountains bordering the Colorado Desert, in California and Baja California; perhaps more abundant in Ne- vada, southern Utah and Arizona, where it is well known as the Nut pine — one of the pinyones of the Mexicans, the seeds forming an important article of food to the Indians in primitive days.

Abrams includes in his Flora of Los Angeles, page 4, and it extends to Oregon, Utah and Colorado. P..Parryana Engelmann, in Am J Sc, sr 2, 34:332, in note (1862). Orcutt, Am pi 1:94, 349 D. P. quadrifolia Parry, ex Parl in DC Prodr 14 (2): 402. This is the beautiful Pinyone pine of the mountain table lands of Baja California, the thin-shelled nuts being collected and roasted by the Indians lor food. Some years they have been brought to the San Diego markets in great quantities, but the Indians who formerly harvested them are nearly extinct or scattered. They would gather the ripe cones and branches in layers, and burn, so that the cones would readily open and yield the delic- ious roasted nuts. The tree is often very symmetrical, but has not so far teen made to thrive near the coast. P. Lambert iana Douglas in Linn soc tr 15:500 (1827). Orcutt, Am pi 1:190 D. A tree of gigantic dimensions, 150-300 ft hi, and 10-20 ft in diam, with light brown smoothish bark splitting in small sections: Ivs 3^-4 i long, rigid, with 5 or 6 lines of stomata on each of the 3 sides: male fls oval, % i long, with 10-15 involucral scales; anth denticulate-crested: cones cylin- drical, bright brown, 12-18 i long and 3 or 4 i wide, on peduncles 3 i in length: sds smooth, black, 6 li long; wing not quite twice as long, widest below the middle, obtuse cotyledons 13-15. \"The exudation from the partially burned tree loses its resinous qual- ities and acquires a sweetness similar to that of sugar or manna, for which it, is sometimes used, whence the name of sugar pine.\" — Engelmann, in Bot Cal 2:123. The sugar which the writer has collected from trees in the Cuyamaca mountains, east of San Diego, was very sweet, fine-grained and white as snow. It occurs throughout California, north to the Columbia river, and is very valuable for its timber. P. muricata D. Don, in Linn Soc tr 17:441 (1837). Orcutt, Am pi 1:190 D. P. Edgariana Hartw, Hort Soc J 3:217. A middle sized tree, 25-50 or rarely 80-120 ft hi, mostly slender (1 or 2 or rarely 3 ft thick), with reddish-brown roughish bark and a patulous top: Ivs rigid, 4-6 i long, %-l li broad, strongly serrulate; bracts lightly fringed, subpersistent; sheaths 9 li long, at length reduced to 1 li: male fls oval, 6-8 li long, in spikes an i long: inv % as long as fls, of 6 or 8 bracts, the outer as long as the inner: cones sessile, spreading or more or less recurved, in clusters of 4-7, often remaining closed and long-persistent, ovate and very oblique, chestnut brown 2-3% (usually 3) i long and 1% 2 i thick; prickles short and stout or (in the southern form) making long straightish or incurved spurs on the outside: sds 3 li long, grooved and rough, black; wing 6-8 li long, widest above the middle: cotyledons 4 or 5. Only known near the coast, where it is exposed to the sea winds and fogs, to an alt of 2000 ft, from Mendocino, Cal., where it grows tallest (in peat bogs), to Tomales Point (in the most sterile soil), Monterey and San Luis Obispo. The cones are said to persist on the tree over 30 years. Tradition saith that pine trees formerly grew on Point Loma, but not a trace of any remain. This tree is found at the San Ysidro landing, near the iron mines in Baja California — some of the cone-bearing trees being scarce 3 ft hi! As this tree occurs both north and south of San Diego, it might well once thrived according to tradition on Point Loma. P. Torreyana Parry ex Torrey, Bot Mex Bound 210 t 58, 59. Orcutt, Am pi 1:94, 351 D. [The following \"Historical notice of Pinus Torreyana,\" read by C. C. Parry before the San Diego Society of Natural History, 2 N 1883, and printed in the West American Scientist 1:37-38, seems worth reprinting.] In the spring of 1850, when connected with the Mexican Boundary Sur- vey, my attention was first called to a peculiar species of pine growing on the Pacific coast at the mouth of the Soledad valley, San Diego county, by a casual inquiry from Dr. J. L. LeConte, the distinguished American ento- mologist, then staying in San Diego, who asked what pine was growing near the ocean beach at that locality. Not having any specimens to show, he simply mentioned at the time its dense cones, and its long, stout leaves, 5 in a sheath. Not long after an opportunity offered to the writer for a personal investigation, having been ordered by Major W. H. Emory to make a geological examination of the reported coal deposits on the ocean bluff above Soledad. In making a section of these strata (see report of the Mex Bound Surv, Vol. 1, pt 2) it was necessary to follow up some of the sharp ravines that here debouch on the ocean beach, and here my attention was taken up by this singular and unique maritime pine, which, with its strong clusters of terminal leaves and its distorted branches loaded down with ponderous cones, was within easy reach of botanical clutch. From the notes and col- 406 lections there made, a description was drawn up dedicating this well marked new species to Dr. John Torrey, an honored friend and instructor of both Dr. LeConte and the writer. Of the few specimens then collected a single cone and bunch was sent to Dr. Torrey, to be figured for the Mexican boundary report (Vol. 2, p. 10, pi. 58-59). While there it fell under the notice of some inquisitive botan- ist, who extracted some of the loose seeds, which were planted, but by some inadvertance were mixed with a 3-leared species. When growing, the two different kinds became confounded and it was inferred that the present writer was mistaken in regarding this species as 5-leaved. Prof. Parlatore, the elaborator of Coniferae in DC Prodromus added to this confusion by ignoring the name first proposed and substituting that of Pinus lophosperma, but fortunately the earlier publication of the Mexican boundary survey, with an accurate figure, permanently fixed the name of Pinus Torreyana, Parry, thus commemorating one of our most honored American botanists by association with a tree peculiar to the Pacific coast in a region which has been so often enriched by his early botanical labors as a collaborator. Subsequently collectors have frequently visited this locality, bearing away to the remotest portions of the world seed of this pine, which, so far as is known, is confined to a coast line of not more than four miles, lying between San Dieguito and about a mile below Soledad, and extending scarcely a mile inland. [Since this time it has been found on Santa Rosa Island by T. S. Brandegee.] The bulk of the tree growth is here mainly confined to a series of high broken cliffs and deeply indented ravines on the1 bold headlines overlooking the sea south of Soledad valley and within the corporate limits of the town of San Diego. Here, within a radius of not more than half a mile, this sin- gular species may be seen to the best advantage clinging to the face of the crumbling yellowish sandstone or shooting up in more graceful forms its scant foliage in the shelter of the deep ravines, bathed with frequent sea fog. One of the finest specimens seen reaches a height of nearly fifty feet, and shows a trunk eighteen inches in diameter at base. Thirty years after this first discovery, in the fall of 1880, the writer visited this locality for the second time, accompanied by the well known botanist, Dr. George Engelmann of St. Louis. At that time more complete examinations were made and sections of a trunk over one foot in diameter were procured and sent to the Forest Commission of the Tenth United States Census. Only a short time since the writer again visited the locality, aided by the liberality of the California Southern Railroad Company, whose track makes this fine resort easily accessible by barely an hour's travel from San Diego. Here, seeking shelter from the fervid rays of a February sun under the scant shade of this decrepit forest, listening to the sullen dash of the Pacific waves against the bold shores, among other thoughts suggsted by the inspiring scene and its past associations, one floats uppermost like drift- ing seaweed and finds a fitting expression here. Why should not San Diego, within whose corporate limits this straggling remnant of a past age finds a last lingering resting place, secure from extermination this remarkable and unique Pacific coast production, so singularly confined within its boundaries, dedicating this spot of ground forever to the cause of scientific instruction and recreation? Where wiser generations than ours may sit beneath its ampler shade and listening to the same musical waves thank us for spar- ing \"that tree.\" [It may be well to here add that the supervisors of San Diego County passed an ordinance designed to protect this tree from vandalism, as a result of action taken by the society of natural history. Unfortunately the bulk of the trees are growing on private property, whose owner is reported to 407 have threatened to cut them down for firewood. A few trees are said to exist on a tract transferred by the city to the San Diego Biological Associa- tion, by whom it is to be hoped they may receive due appreciation and care. As it thrives with us in cultivation many more should be planted around San Diego, and thus preserve the species from possible extinction.] JUNIPERUS Tournefort ex Linnaeus, Syst ed 1 (1735).

It was early introduced into England, and is now widely cultivated, especially in southern California, and forms a characteristic feat- ure of the flora of San Diego, though not native. At Point Pinos \"the trees 4o8 very much resemble the Cedar of Lebanon in habit, with dense far-spread- ing branches. W. H. Brewer recorded a circumference of 18 2-3 ft at bight of 5 or 6 ft from the ground. Branches with dark gray and some- what rugose bark; branchlets rather stout; Ivs bright green, aeutish, ob- scurely pitted on the back, often with a longitudenal furrow on each side: scales of very young cones with conspicuous foliaceous tips; mature cones clustered on short, stout peduncles, oblong-ovate (1-1% i long by 9 li broad), of 5 or usually 6 pairs of scales, with a broad thickish or on the uppermost a subconical boss: sds num. (about 20 to each scale), mostly 2% li long. Synonyms: C. Lanibertiana Gordon, Carr, Conif 124. C. Hartwegii Carr, Conif ed 2, 168. C. Gnadalupensis Sereno Watson, Am ac pr 14:300 (1879); Bot Cal 2:114. Orcutt, Am pi 1:189 D. A widely spreading tree, 40 ft hi, 2-5 ft in diam, with bark flaking off in thin plates and leaving a smooth claret-red surface: branches drooping, branchlets very slender: foliage glaucous-green; glands obscure: cones glo- bose and strongly bossed, an i or more in diam, of 6-8 very thick scales: sds large, 3 li long or more. A prized ornamental tree, called the Blue Cypress, first found by Dr. Edward Palmer on Guadalupe Island, and later by Dr. Parry and the writer on the mainland of Baja California, and in canyons near San Diego. LIBOCEDRUS Endl, Syn Conif 42 (1847). California white cedar: stam fls with 12 or more fil-scales; cones not reflexed, of 4 or 6 erect subverticillate and somewhat valvate thick-coriac- eous scales, the lower pair smaller and sterile, the 3d pair when present also sterile and connate; sds very unequally winged: otherwise as Thuya. Only 4 known species, 2 South American, 1 in New Zealand. It. decurrens Torrey, PI Frem 7 t 3. Heyderia decurreus Koch, Dendrol 2:177. Thuya Craigiana Balf, Oreg Exped 2, t. A tree conical in shape, with loose fibrous bark and very light and soft, light-colored wood, durable in water or under cover. It grows 100-150 ft hi or more, and 4-7 ft in diam, and occurs in the Coast ranges from Oregon to San Diego, and in the Sierra Nevada to an alt of 8,500 ft. SOME NATIVE FLOWERING SHRUBS. It is proposed to describe from time to time the native trees and flow- ers of San Diego county, some of them being far better known in European gardens than in the gardens of San Diego city.
