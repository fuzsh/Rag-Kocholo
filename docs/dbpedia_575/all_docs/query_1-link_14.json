It is endemic to the Klamath Mountains of northern California where it is a plant of mountain meadows, often on serpentine soils. This is a perennial herb forming tufts of long, erect leaves and thin, naked stems. Each leaf is a taillike strip of overlapping lobed leaflets. The reddish to greenish stems reach 30 to 50 centimeters in height and bear inflorescences of clustered flowers. The stems, leaves, and inflorescence] s are all covered in fuzzy white to gray hairs. Each flower is about a centimeter wide, with pinkish-green triangular sepals and longer, narrower pink or purple petals. In the center of the flower are 20 stamens and a few pistils.\n\nExternal links"
