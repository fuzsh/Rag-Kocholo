The Republic of Lucca (1160-1847) was a historic state of Italy that existed from 1160 to 1805, with Lucca as its capital. Lucca was a small republic that had become an independent commune in 1115, and it had its independence for over 600 years. In February 1799, the French First Republic invaded Lucca, and French Jacobins created a new republic in Lucca with a democratic constitution. However, the Austrian forces conquered the city in July 1799 after the French retreated from Lucca. In 1800, the State of Lucca was recreated after the French retook the city, and Lucca would cease to be independent in 1805 when it became a part of the Principality of Lucca and Piombino.
