The Republic of Lucca was an independent state in central Italy that existed from 1160 to 1805. It began as an autonomous commune within the Holy Roman Empire and gained independence in 1160 when it purchased feudal rights. The Republic of Lucca remained independent for over 500 years, becoming an important city-state during the Middle Ages and Renaissance period. It came under French control in the early 19th century and ceased to exist as an independent state in 1805 when Napoleon transformed it into the Principality of Lucca and Piombino.",
