        "text": "Chapter one\n\nExtract from \"History of modern Italy, volume one: the rise of the Principate of Tuscany\"\n\nDespite the failure of the Pazzi conspiracy, in 1478 the situation looked very disastrous for the Florentine Republic. The lord of Florence, Lorenzo de Medici, was excommunicated by Systus IV, and the Kingdom of Aragon declare war. His allies and friends were unable to help him: in Milan exploded a civil war, Venice fought the Turks, and France was involved in Burgundian affairs.\n\nIn real help of Lorenzo came the new cultural ideas in these years were spreading across Italy and from here to all Europe. Taking inspiration above all from the rediscovery of classicism and ancient Romans istitutions, the Florentine ruler developed a new institutional form which imposed in May of 1478. Lorenzo claimed that Florence controlled the mayority of Tuscan lands, so from that moment the state could legitimacy be called \"Tuscany\"; and because the Tuscan were formed not only by florentine but also to the rest of the republic's population, he modified the city council ( now called \"Senate of Tuscany\") enlarging it with capable men (naturally all loyal to the Medici) from the other main Tuscan cities under his control: Pisa, Arezzo, Pistoia... Finally Lorenzo argued that the new reformed republic shall be ruled to the head of the Senate, the first of the senators, a \"Principe\" (Prince, from the latin \"Princeps\"), following the example of Augustus. Obviously, Lorenzo de Medici was elected as first Price of Tuscany.\n\nSo the Principate of Tuscany was born.\n\nChapter two\n\nExtract from \"History of modern Italy, volume one: the rise of the Principate of Tuscany\"\n\nImmediately Lorenzo started a full diplomatic offensive to seek recognition and new allies. Initially he concentrated on the two neighbouring Tuscan states, the Republics of Lucca and Siena. The relations with the second were severely tied, because the Senese feared that Florence (they didn't recognize the republic's new name) wanted to invade them to reunite all the region, and started to approach the Pope; however they decided to remained neutral yet. Instead Lucca, after a first indecision, decided in the end to align with Tuscany: Lorenzo offered very lucrative terms. In fact the Lucchese obtained some prestigious seats in the Senate, trade rights in the tiny port of Livorno (to this point is dated the start of the growing importance of the city as main port of Tuscany), the possibility to partecipate in joint ventures with the Florentine, and their officials could make career in the Tuscan Army.\n\nLorenzo also initiated a complete renew of the entirely of land forces, modernizing it with guns and cannon bought from Germany and traded with the help of agents of the Medici's bank (which was very strong in that country and deeply connected to the Imperial crown) and both Genoese and Venetian traders: the two republics, specially Venice, remained neutral but agreed to secretly support Lorenzo in anti-Aragonese function. Meanwhile the mercenary's groups were almost all disbanded and replaced with a standing-national army following the French example, and leaded to officers from all Tuscan cities. However for that moment the high ranks were always filled with Florentine.\n\nThe Tuscans managed to hold and improve for almost two years their positions, keeping a defensive stance in the war while their ambassadors and spies instigated the semi-indipendent countries in the Papal state, specially Urbino, Perugia, and the cities of Romagna, and obtained the ufficial recognition from the Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III of Hasburgs, who seeked Tuscany as a reliable ally in Italy but also he needed the money of Florentine bankers.\n\nAt start of spring of 1480, Lorenzo decide they were ready, and with a surprise move Tuscany treacherously invaded the Republic of Siena claimed it was de facto an active allied of the Pope, and however it was the time all the region must finally be reunited under an only banner. Meanwhile, a second Tuscan army crossed the Tosco-Emilian Appennin and marched towards Bologna.\n\nSoon both Bologna and Siena were under siege. A Papal army formed exclusively of mercenaries came in help of the Senese but the 8th of May 1480 received outside the besiegied city a blowing defeat. The Tuscans, well armed, loyal to Lorenzo, and also outnumbered demostrated for the first time their valor.\n\nSiena, desperating to resist more, surrended two days later, ending its Republic. Some resistance pockets were all across South Tuscany but they offered no match to their new masters. Meanwhile, with the spread of the defeat at Siena, revolts all flared into the Papal states, leading many small countries to declare full indipendence from the Church's yoke. At mid-June, when he incorporated the Senese effectives, Lorenzo ordered to invade Latium moving towards Viterbo. When he known also Bologna surrended and joined the Tuscan, Systus IV requested peace.\n\nWeanwhile to counter-balance the Tuscan expansion, Ferrante of Aragon occupied in August the neutral Duchy of Piombino, but later he failed to advance more beacuse of ready Tuscan counter-offensive. In the end, because Ludovico Sforza who controlled Milan thanks also to the Aragonese help refused to join the war while Venice declared to be ready to help Tuscany, Ferrante asked peace with Lorenzo.\n\nThe 2nd of October 1480 was signed the Treaty of Siena between Tuscany, Aragon and Papal State: Aragon occupied the Duchy of Piombino while Tuscany gained Siena and Papal Emilia with Bologna; the Pope maintained nominal control over Marche, Umbria and Romagna but in the end was unable to restabilish full control of these regions.\n\nIndeed Lorenzo obtained a great victory reuniting Tuscany, but the balance in Italy during from the treaty of Lodi in 1454 was irrimediatly compromised, and soon Tuscany was involved in another war...\n\nChapter Three\n\nExtract from \"History of modern Italy, volume one: the rise of the Principate of Tuscany\"\n\nLorenzo after the war started a program of infrastructures to develop the Principate, improving the connection between Bologna to the North, Lucca to West, and Siena in the South. Meanwhile through their bank the Medici increased over all the country their possession, mostly in the newly acquired Senese territories but also near Lucca: the Medici started to make high efforts to get control of the city.\n\nMeanwhile the Senate was enriched with Emilian and Senese members: but because Lorenzo fissed the number of senator on 600 members, he forced some florentine to resign; this caused some anger in the high classes of Florence, even if the resigned obtained new prestigious assignments.\n\nIn time of peace, Lorenzo's court flourished of many artistic and philosophical talents; the Prince often visit the Garden of San Marco, where he put his art collection and permitted to all the artists to study here and made their works. In that time the most prominent artists were Ghirlandaio and Verrocchio, but also Leonardo da Vinci started to made his first indipendent works, also obtaining the rights to made anatomy studies from the same Prince. Some years later, a young talented Aretine boy attracted Lorenzo, and he will be somewhat involved in the future developments of the dynasty...\n\nIn 1481 Girolamo Savonarola started his predication in Florence against the Prince: he obtained some support more from hidden Medician dissidents than from common people, amazed from their ruler's success: he managed to defeat Siena while the old Republic always failed.\n\nBetween 1480 and 1482 Tuscany seeked for new alliances: it succeded to enforce its ties with Venice and to reach a more stable relation with Aragon, but the Papal state was always hostile ( even if Systus IV removed over Lorenzo the excommunication) and also Milan wasn't very amiable. Another hostile state was the Duchy of Ferrara under the Estensi rule, which had a justified complex of being surrounded and otherwise wanted to take Bologna.\n\nIn 1482 Venice request the relinquish of the Polesine area from the Estensi, but they refused; so war was in the end inevitable and was disastrous for Ferrara. In fact Tuscany recognized the Venetian claims and helped his allied, invading Estense Emilia; the war soon involved the Lunigiana region, invaded by Lucca with the support of Tuscan soldiers. Systus IV was initially favorable to the Venetian but when he known also Tuscany was involved in the war in the end decided to be neutral.\n\nLudovico Sforza decided also to remained neutral in the early phases of the war, even if both Venice and Tuscany enforced their position; but when he was sure France didn't intervene in the conflict, he pledged his support to Ferrara and move his army to Emilia. Lorenzo ordered then to move towards Parma entering in Milanese territory; the two enemies clashed near the cities in the September of 1483, resulting in a minor Tuscan victory. The Moor decided to retreat over the Taro river but he was always fearing of a French invasion and at the start of 1484 he accepted the peace terms, soon followed by Ferrara. Venice regained the Polesine while Tuscany now controlled almost all of Emilia until the Taro and Lucca took Lunigiana.\n\nThe Polesine war strenghted the Tuscan-Venetian axis, while despite the defeat Milan enforced his ties with Ferrara. The French however didn't decided to intervene yet while Aragon had difficulties to hold the Kingdom of Naples; so for now Italy was once again in peace...\n\nFrench intervention could be a major problem, but Tuscany has a real citizen-army and not a bunch of mercenaries who will run away. They'd likely do MUCH better than any other Italian state if France got involved.\n\nOf course, \"much better\" means slowly being ground under as opposed to being immediately squashed due to France being so much bigger.\n\nUnless of course, the Medici can unite all of Italy against the foreigner, as Machiavelli would have wanted.\n\nWhere is Machiavelli, in TTL? OTL he was part of an anti-Medici government that temporarily held the city, was tortured after its overthrow, and wrote \"The Prince\" to suck up to the Medici in order to get a job.\n\nHe was a big foe of mercenaries and a big fan of Italian unity, so he might be really involved in this stuff.\n\nMacchiaveli only made a single literary call that has been later reinterpreted as \"for unity\" by post-risorgimento nationalist historiography, in a sycophantic book he wrote as a job application for a man he otherwise despised. And said call is only about driving the barbarians out of Italy and dropping mercenaries, nowhere does he say he wants Italian unity out of it.\n\nFrench intervention could be a major problem, but Tuscany has a real citizen-army and not a bunch of mercenaries who will run away. They'd likely do MUCH better than any other Italian state if France got involved.\n\nOf course, \"much better\" means slowly being ground under as opposed to being immediately squashed due to France being so much bigger.\n\nYes, but why do you think France and Tuscany will they fight each another in the immediate future? For now they were friends...\n\nUnless of course, the Medici can unite all of Italy against the foreigner, as Machiavelli would have wanted.\n\nAs said before, wait and see...\n\nWhere is Machiavelli, in TTL? OTL he was part of an anti-Medici government that temporarily held the city, was tortured after its overthrow, and wrote \"The Prince\" to suck up to the Medici in order to get a job.\n\nDon't worry, he will come soon.\n\nHe was a big foe of mercenaries and a big fan of Italian unity, so he might be really involved in this stuff.\n\nI guess his role could be very incisive in the following years... specially after 1492 (speak too much)\n\nChapter four\n\nExtract from \"History of modern Italy, volume one: the rise of the Principate of Tuscany\"\n\nThe defeat of Milan made the balance of Italy more instable, because it reopened the question of the claims both France and Aragon had over the duchy. Ludovico Sforza understood his position was far to be secure, so just few months after the end in the war the Moor completely reversed his foreign policy searching an agreement with both Tuscany and Venice. The Venetian ambassadors weren't too happy to sign an alliance with Milan, but Lorenzo convinced them it was better to have on their borders a friendly and indipendent nation instead of a buffer French or Aragonese state.\n\nSo in the end of 1484 Tuscany, Milan and Venice formed a new alliance which soon also Ferrara joined to avoid the risk to being split between the three countries; however the Duchy aligned his policy exclusively towards Milan.\n\nThe renewed stability created an enourmous increase of trade routes all across Italy, permitted the exchanges of new ideas, and many artists freely travel from one court to another. Also Genoa and the Papal states received benefits in that new period of stability, either if both aligned more towards Aragon, viewed as a more reliable ally against the Turk menace; luckily for Lorenzo Innocent VIII, the successor of Systus IV died in 1484 just few days after the formation of the alliance, was more friendly towards Tuscany; the new pope also recognized the Principate in a effort to promove the Italian stability.\n\nIn the years following the birth of the alliance, Lorenzo continued to improve the infrastructure, opening new textile manufactories (the Tuscan fabric was one of the most valuable for centuries), and spreaded the arts all over the country.\n\nIn that period also the Prince met two interesting characters. The first was a young student, Niccolò Machiavelli, very informed about both the internal and the international situation; Lorenzo used him as ambassador in the Italian northern states and in France, and when he returned in 1490 in Florence he become secretary of the Prince and one of this later counselors. The second was a boy from Aretine contrade, Michelangelo Buonarroti; he was a talented scultor and Lorenzo remained surprised to his skills, so he decided to allow him in his courts, giving the same education of his sons and nephews.\n\nSoon Lorenzo had another problem to solve: the succession. First, he didn't believe his son Piero was fit to rule the Principate; second, even in a Senate under Medician control, a certain dissent still existed and could opposed the statement that proclaiming a new Prince from a same family only means that the Republic will become a de facto monarchy. Machiavelli suggested a constitutional reform: to give the impression the Prince wasn't an absolute ruler, from now will be established a council leaded by a \"Cancelliere\" (chancellor) which helped the head of state to govern the country; however any decision taken from any member of the \"Cancellierato\" (Chancellorate) could only be approved by the Prince. Lorenzo was a bit reluctant but in the end accepted and in the start of 1492 thanks of his intrigues Machiavelli become the first Chancellor.\n\nModern political historians argued a lot about the decision of Lorenzo to relinquish part to his powers to a another man, even if he remained the ruler; generally is accepting the claim he thought than if he came a weak prince, a more able Chancellor could be succeded to rule well the country: naturally he stated the point the Chancellor must remained loyal to the Prince who could only be a Medici.\n\nIn fact Lorenzo decided to give more legitimate claims to his successor: for example in 1491 in the Principate's banners he added the coat of arms of the Medici with the red Florence's Lily, while he commissioned to Michelangelo a statue which represented the Principate, with the Medician symbol. The scuptor finished the work in late 1493, and the statue, which represent a young warrior with the face of Piero de Medici, was put in Piazza del Principato under the Loggia dei Lanzi.\n\nHowever there were the last days of Lorenzo's rule; the 9th of April 1492 he died at age of 43. The winds of war soon ravaged again over Italy..."
