        "text": "As many probably know, at least vaguely, Lucca does have connections with Napoleon Bonaparte, the Emperor of the French in the early 19th century. Today, there are still a few reminders of his involvement…perhaps some of you have stayed in Hotel Napoléon (source) a little outside of the walls, or visited Piazza Napoleone:\n\nLucca had been a free city since the 12th century and, apart from Venice, was the largest Italian city state with a republican constitution to maintain its independence over so many centuries. All this came to an end when Lucca was conquered by Napoleon in 1805.\n\nNapoleon granted his sister (Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi) the title of Duchess of Lucca and Princess of Piombino. The Republic of Lucca became the Principality of Lucca and Piombino, ruled as a single monarchy, under Elisa and her husband, Felice Baciocchi. He was crowned Prince of Lucca in Cattedrale di San Martino on July 14th, 1805. But it was Elisa who had the real sovereign control – he did not exercise any significant power, and passively put up with Elisa’s multiple affairs, preferring to focus on military decisions. She was the only female sibling of Napoleon’s to gain any political power, as he favoured her over Pauline and Caroline. Note that her bust is far more prominent than her husband in the coin on the right, being more directly related to Napoleon and of greater political importance. Anyway, Napoleon had been against this marriage in the first place.\n\nLucca now officially belonged to Napoleonic France (territory of the First French Empire). But Napoleon himself saw the town as outdated in comparison to his vision of modern French cities, and therefore it was of little importance; he even called it the “dwarf republic”. This is why he entrusted it to his sister although Piombino, which she also ruled, was of greater strategic interest to him because it was close to Elba and Corsica.\n\nThe square, Piazza Napoleone, was built and named by Elisa in 1806. More recently, it was used as a car park up until 1998. Although it was named after her brother, the French emperor, and a statue of Napoleon placed in the middle, today it bears the statue of Maria Luisa, who became the Duchess of Lucca after Elisa’s fall. You can make out Maria Luisa’s name on the inscription below if you click on the image to enlarge it:\n\nThe reign of Elisa marked the beginning of the Neoclassical era (the revival of artistic styles inspired from the classical period). Elisa herself focussed on reviving the city’s artistic culture. On the right is an oil-on-canvas painting of herself, which you can go and see today in the Museo Nazionale di Villa Guinigi. Below is an example of Neoclassical side chairs, made in Lucca around 1810-1820. The faces possibly bear resemblance to Medusa, hence the classical inspirations:\n\nAfter acquiring Villa Reale di Marlia to live in, Elisa also added a pair of Neoclassical palazzine gatehouses and other entrance elements. Images sourced here\n\nIn 1809, Elisa became the Grand Duchess of Tuscany from Florence after Napoleon created the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. She may have ruled over more land, but in reality did not have more power – her role was to enforce Napoleon’s decisions, and she couldn’t enjoy the somewhat autocratic rule she had enjoyed having over the first two provinces. But she enjoyed revitalising the arts in Florence as well, where she now lived. She personally loved the arts, commissioning sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini to create busts of her close family members. If you’re interested in the background of Napoleon, this Grand Duchy of Tuscany was created as a part of his treaty with Charles IV of Spain that was signed two years before.\n\nAgain with a neoclassical style (using architectural Roman triglyphs and also metopes), Porta Elisa is below. Named, of course, after Napoleon’s sister, it was built due to Napoleon’s fear of invasion from Florence. Construction began in 1809, and finished 1811. It marked a change in the gates built so far, seeing as they had been named after saints (Porta San Pietro, Porta San Donato), and demonstrated the control that the Bonaparte family had over this region.\n\nThe inhabitants of Lucca were less than pleased with this new sovereign control, and loss of their independence. They sarcastically referred to Elisa as “la Madame”, and did not like the way that their city was becoming ‘Frenchified’ by her and Napoleon. They were not sympathetic to his efforts to gain French territory.\n\nSo what did Elisa actually do during her reign of power? From May 1806, she reformed the clergy (religious leaders) and closed down convents that did not also function as other social services, such as schools or hospitals. She also nationalised Lucca’s goods and lands, and introduced various legislation.\n\nA revolt was almost sparked when she demolished the Church of San Pietro in March 1807 (since restored) with its image of the Madonna dei miracoli in order to build a French-style piazza before her city residence.\n\nBut many of her reforms were positive; she set up the Committee of Public Charity in 1807, which enabled the poor to seek free medical consultations in an attempt to address the overwhelming diseases that were sweeping the city. She also set up the Committee for the Encouragement of Agriculture, Arts and Commerce to increase agricultural production.\n\nImprovements to education was one of Elisa’s best achievements during her reign, the General Department of Public Education being created in 1809 in order to create and inspect new teaching establishments. She set up the secondary school Collège Félix for boys, and also focussed on girls’ education by setting up convents that operated in the same way a school would, with a set curriculum for the girls so that they could learn too. In fact, girls aged 5-8 should have been educated as Elisa made this compulsory – but inhabitants would not always cooperate with their new rulers, and brand new rules like this were often hard to implement. For richer families, there was the Institut Élisa that was designed to educate girls of the nobility, if only for them to become cultured wives. She did not neglect poorer girls either, developing the Congregazione San Felice for their education in July 1812.\n\nElisa also helped Lucca build its reputation as a spa town, by improving the architecture and decor of the baths, and beginning discussions for an aqueduct into Lucca in 1811. It was formally designed by Nottolini in 1823 after Elisa’s fall.\n\nSupport had began to grow for Elisa herself, but plummeted when she was forced to implement Napoleon’s decision to conscript the men of Lucca in May 1811, which had previously been avoided.\n\nSo how did Elisa fall? Anglo-Austrian forces under Lord William Bentinck captured Lucca as Napoleon fell from power in 1815. Lucca became a Bourbon-Parma (royal house of French origin) duchy and Elisa was replaced by Maria Luisa of Spain, dying just five years later.\n\nThis was an interesting period of time for Lucca, with a ruling style imposed that they had never had to submit to previously, under a French ruler that they had never wanted. But although they lost their independence under Elisa for the first time in centuries, she did also bring positive reforms to health and education, as well as her love of the arts, and contribution towards the creation of Neoclassicism in Lucca. This means that, on balance, Lucca was probably changed for the better after being conquered by Napoleon."
