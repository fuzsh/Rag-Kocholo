        "text": "Lucca and Montecarlo – sightseeing & wine tours\n\nLucca – a luxury “time machine” to the Middle Ages\n\nThe city of Lucca (Lacca) cannot be called one of the main capitals of world tourism, because there are no “wonders of the world” like the famous Tower in neighboring Pisa (the mass tourist, unfortunately, is not interested in anything else in Pisa). At the same time, there are always a lot of guests and tourists in Lucca, and a significant part of them have already been here and are returning to this city not for the first time – people who are in Italy for the first time rarely come to Lucca. What attracts them here?\n\nMontecarlo – the wine citadel of the province of Lucca\n\nHalf an hour from Lucca, the capital of the medieval republic, independent until the beginning of the 19th century, Montecarlo is located, one of the most beautiful “borgos” – small towns in Tuscany. The name Montecarlo comes from the Latin “Mons Karoli – Charles Mountain”, this fortified city really owes its name to its founder, Emperor Charles IV of Bohemia-Luxembourg, who defended Lucca from being captured by the Florentines in the 14th century. It was Charles who in 1333 built this outpost near the rich trading Lucca on the top of the Cerrullo hill. Advantageous strategic position – from the towers of Montecarlo opens a view of the entire surrounding plain from the Apennine mountains to the Tyrrhenian Sea, allowed to control an important section of the strategic “Frankish Road” (Via Francigena), which led from France and Northern Europe to Rome. It must be said that a fortified urban settlement called Vivinaya on the Cerrullo hill existed on the site of Montecarlo since the 10th century AD. At the beginning of the XIV century, during the reign of the Lucca tyrant Castruccio Castracani, a successful military leader who dreamed of uniting the whole of Tuscany, who two centuries later was praised by the Florentine Niccolò Machiavelli, Vivinaya Castle was rebuilt and fortified. However, already in 1331 – three years after the death of Castracani – Vivinaya was destroyed by the Florentines, who were about to conquer neighboring Lucca. Charles of Bohemia (then still Luxembourg), the future Czech king and Holy Roman Emperor, came to the aid of the Lucchese allies. Charles not only protected Lucca from conquest by Florence, but also restored the main fortress on the eastern border of the Republic. Instead of the devastated Vivinaya for its destitute inhabitants on Mount Cerrullo, the best architects of Charles in 1333 erected a new citadel and a borgo – settlement. In 1437, however, Montecarlo finally fell into the hands of Florence, under whose rule it remained until the unification of Italy in the middle of the 19th century. Seven centuries later, Montecarlo has retained its main pride – the citadel of the XIV century, which is surrounded by “borgo”, now inhabited by only four thousand inhabitants, but boasting dozens of ancient buildings and churches (including the Cathedral of St. Andrew), but also a real (albeit small) old opera house.\n\nIn the 19th-20th centuries, Montecarlo wines owed their fame to the local winemaker Giulio Magnani, the owner of the Fattoria Marchi Magnani (now Mazzini) winery, who in the second half of the 19th century began working in Montecarlo with French varieties from Bordeaux – Cabernet Sauvignon and Franc, Merlot Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Roussanne, from the Rhone Valley – Roussanne and Syrah, Burgundy Pinot Blanc and Chardonnay. He achieved the greatest success with blends of the traditional local Trebbiano with French white varieties – by the beginning of the 20th century, white wines from Montecarlo, which gained fame and recognition under the nickname “Chablis from Montecarlo”, did not disappear from the tables of the Italian aristocracy and even the Italian royal family of Savoy. It is known that in 1930, at the wedding of Prince Umberto of Savoy (later the last king of Italy) and Maria José of Belgium, wines from Montecarlo were served."
