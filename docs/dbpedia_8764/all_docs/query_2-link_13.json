        "text": "Historical about Lucca\n\nThe origins of Lucca know very poco.Quasi certainly rose in pre-Roman era, in a marshy area between Lake Bientina and Serchio, his name was, in fact, the Ligurian-Celtic origins, \"luk\" just means \"village surrounded by water \". The city was dominated by Ligurian and Etruscans, until 180 BC when it became a Roman colony, taking the name of Luke.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire, Lucca was invaded by the Goths and Lombards, under which reached a high degree of prosperity, becoming the seat of kings and the regional capital.\n\nThere were, however, also moments of great difficulty so that in 1234 Lucca had to submit to Pisa and Florence.\n\nThe struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines led to Lucca in 1314 Uguccione of Faggiuola, and Ghibelline tyrant of Pisa, after he was released from Castruccio Castracani.\n\nIn early 1400, with Paul Guinigi, Lucca experienced a period of peace and prosperity. At his fall, in 1430, was restored to the republican regime, remained in force until 1799.\n\nLucca in 1805 became the principality, then the Duchy of Maria Luisa of Bourbon, from 1817 to 1824, finally entered the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.\n\nIn 1860 he entered Lucca to be part of the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe walls of Lucca\n\nLucca is enclosed in its sixteenth large walls. Their construction dates back to 1504, during the Republic of Lucca.\n\nArrangements were made to defend the city, which feared the expansionist policy thrusts Medici.\n\nThe walls are interrupted by 11 ramparts. Inside the rampart of San Martino you can see the layout of the old gunner.\n\nThree are the original gates of cittt?: Porta San Pietro, (1565-1566), Porta Santa Maria (1592-1594), home dell'Emeroteca Municipal, San Donato Porta Nuova (1628-1639). In addition, then, Old Port San Donato (1590) place of welcome tourist. Finally the walls were completed later with the doors and Elisa Vittorio Emanuele with a more modern facility.\n\nToday you can make long Walking on the walls through the tree-lined avenue, they offer interesting glimpses of the city.\n\nCuriosity about Lucca\n\n\"Lake Screeners\"\n\nPerhaps not everyone knows that under Lake Screeners, in Lucca, more precisely in Garfagnana, is a small country.\n\nOnce fact, in this great valley, some craftsmen had built a small factory, Careggine factory where they worked marble and of them a little, given the prosperity that they obtain, it was built around a small community.\n\nIn 1953 the village was submerged by the dam of Lake Screeners, but every ten years, because of maintenance work, it is emptied and millions of visitors flock to enjoy the spectacle of the town reemerged."
