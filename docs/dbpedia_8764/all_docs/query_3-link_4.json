The legislative authority was entrusted to the Senate which was composed of six members and in combination with the two ministers and the sovereign was called the Council of the Principality. Despite this partition, the Baciocchi princes executed an almost absolute power towards the State. After the princes getaway in 1814, for a short period of time the Senate assumed a temporary government under the presidency of the archbishop Filippo Sardi."
