The State was the result of the annexation of ancient Principality of Piombino by the Republic of Lucca which was turned into a monarchy. The Constitution was written by Napoleon on June 22, establishing a Council of State helping the Princes, and a legislative Senate. The Principality adopted the French Franc as currency, even if few special local coins were minted. On March 3, 1809, Elisa was created by her brother as Grand Duchess of all Tuscany in Florence, a region which had been annexed to France two years before. The Principality so became part of Tuscany and, consequently, of the French Empire, but under a special status: a prefect was appointed (Antoine-Marie-Pierre de Hautmesnil), but the territory was never named as a department. In 1814, Austrian Army occupied Lucca and gave Piombino to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and Elba to exiled Napoleon. Lucca was restored as a separate state, and the Congress of Vienna gave it to Maria Louisa of Bourbon. ...More: http: //booksllc.net/?id=24624494 undefined Books",
