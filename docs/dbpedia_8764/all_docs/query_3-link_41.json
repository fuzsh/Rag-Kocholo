Oftentimes, covered employees will join a group of other DOT regulated employees in a random testing program and this is referred to as a DOT Consortium. Generally, an employer who has less than fifty employees or single operators will join the consortium which will comply with the random drug and alcohol testing requirements of 49 CFR Part 40. Employers that have over 50 employees who are regulated by Part 40 may elect to be enrolled in a \"stand alone\" random testing pool.\n\nThe DOT consortium is cost effective and complies with all requirements of 49 CFR Part 40 which mandates that all \"safety sensitive\" employees be enrolled in a random drug and alcohol testing program.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) has strict regulations requiring regulated companies and independent operators (CDL License Holders) to be an active member of a DOT drug and alcohol Consortium and failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant fines and other DOT sanctions.\n\nWe are fully versed in the DOT procedures for pre-employment drug testing, random drug testing, reasonable suspicion drug testing, post-accident drug testing, return to duty drug testing and follow up drug testing.\n\nDOT regulated companies with multiple safety sensitive employees must also have an employee within the company who is assigned as the \"designated employer representative\" (DER).

Call us (800) 828-7086)\n\nLocal Area Info: Duchy of Lucca\n\nThe Duchy of Lucca was a small Italian state existing from 1815 to 1847. It was centered on the city of Lucca. By the Congress of Vienna of 1815 the Duchy was to revert to Tuscany on the end of its Bourbon line of rulers, which happened in 1847. Tuscany was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia (Piedmont) in 1860.\n\nThe Duchy was formed in 1815 by the Congress of Vienna, out of the former Republic of Lucca and the Principality of Lucca and Piombino, which had been ruled by Elisa Bonaparte. It was created to compensate the House of Bourbon-Parma for the loss of the Duchy of Parma, which had been given to Marie Louise of Austria.\n\nIn 1817, Maria Luisa of Spain, the former Infanta of Spain and Queen of Etruria, assumed the government of Lucca. She was also the mother of Charles Louis of Parma, the Bourbon heir to Parma. This followed the Treaty of Paris (1815), which confirmed both her sovereign status in Lucca, and her son's status as heir to Parma in succession to Marie Louise."
