        "text": "The Principality of Lucca and Piombino was an Italian client state of the French Empire that existed from 23 June 1805 to 3 March 1814, with Lucca serving as its capital. The principality was created from the Jacobin State of Lucca, the Principality of Piombino, and the Duchy of Massa and Carrara, which were merged into one client state ruled by Napoleon I's sister Elisa Bonaparte. Napoleon wrote the constitution for the principality, creating a Council of State to assist the Princess, and a Legislative Senate. In 1809, Napoleon gave Elisa control over the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and Lucca and Piombino became part of Tuscany as a result. In 1814, the Austrian Empire occupied Tuscany, and, as a result of the Congress of Vienna, Piombino was granted to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, now ruled by the House of Bourbon-Parma, while Lucca became the Duchy of Lucca.\n\nGallery[]"
