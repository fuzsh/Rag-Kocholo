        "text": "LONDON -- Antony Sher has won the 1985 Lawrence Olivier Actor of the Year award for his portrayal of Shakespeare's 'Richard III' and his performance as the transvestite in Harvey Fierstein's, 'Torch Song Trilogy.'\n\nYvonne Bryceland was named best actress for her performance in 'The Road to Mecca,' by South African Athol Fugard.\n\nThe Olivier awards for London stage shows were given Sunday night.\n\nSher, 36, received widespread critical acclaim for his portrayal of Richard III as a crippled king on crutches who moved about the stage like a spider in the Royal Shakespeare Company's production."
