        "text": "Edward Asner was born of Russian Jewish parentage in Kansas City, to Morris David Asner (founder and owner of the Kansas City-based Asner Iron & Metal Company) and his wife Elizabeth \"Lizzie\" (Seliger). After attending college, Ed worked various jobs, including in a steel mill, as a door-to-door salesman and on an assembly line for General Motors. Between 1947 and 1949, he attended the University of Chicago. The onset of the Korean War saw him drafted into the U.S. Army Signals Corps and posted to France where he was primarily assigned clerical tasks. Upon demobilization, Asner joined the Playwrights Theatre Company in Chicago but soon progressed to New York. In 1955, he appeared off-Broadway in the leading role of the beggar king Jonathan Peachum in Brecht's Threepenny Opera. Five years later, he made his debut on the Great White Way in the courtroom drama Face of a Hero, co-starring alongside Jack Lemmon. He also began regular TV work in anthology drama.\n\nFrom the early '60s, Asner, now based in California, earned his living as a busy supporting actor. His many noted guest appearances included turns in Route 66 (1960), Chicago 1930 (1959), Auf der Flucht (1963), Die Seaview - In geheimer Mission (1964) (sinister dictator-in-exile Brynov), Invasion von der Wega (1967) (twice -- as aliens) and How the Ghosts Stole Christmas (1998) (one of a couple of ghostly residents in a haunted mansion). Heavy-set and distinctively gravelly-voiced, Asner established his reputation as tough, robust and uncompromising (though, on occasion, good-hearted) authority figures. Excellent at conveying menace, he was memorably cast as the brutish patriarch Axel Jordache in Reich & arm (1976) and as the slave ship's morally conflicted master, Captain Thomas Davies, in Roots: The Complete Miniseries (1977), which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award in 1977. The immensely prolific Asner (417 IMDB screen credits!) would receive seven Emmys in total (from 21 nominations), all Primetime, and become the only actor to win in both the comedy and drama category for the same role. That was also the part which made Asner a household name: the gruff, snarky newspaper editor Lou Grant (1977). Grant began as a mainstay on Oh Mary (1970), a 30-minute sitcom.\n\nWhen the character was promoted to West Coast editor of The Los Angeles Tribune, Asner went on to star in his own much acclaimed drama series. Despite consistently high ratings, the show was axed after five seasons amid rumours of disharmony between the star and producers, possibly due to the former's outspoken political views. Indeed, Asner has been a controversial figure as an activist and campaigner, engaged in a variety of humanitarian and political issues. A self-proclaimed liberal Democrat, he published a book in 2017, amusingly titled \"The Grouchy Historian: An Old-Time Lefty Defends Our Constitution Against Right-Wing Hypocrites and Nutjobs.\"\n\nBetween 1981 and 1985, Asner served twice as President of the Screen Actors Guild, during which time he was critical of former SAG President Ronald Reagan -- then the president of a greater concern -- for his Central American policy. In 1996, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame and in 2002 received the Screen Actors Guild's Life Achievement Award. In addition to appearing on screen and stage, he performed extensive work for radio, video games and animated TV series. He voiced the lead character Carl Fredricksen in Pixar's Oscar-winning production of Oben (2009), starred as Santa in Buddy - Der Weihnachtself (2003), and played Nicholas Drago in Der Spiele-Erfinder (2014). Ed passed away in Los Angeles at the age of 91 on August 29, 2021.\n\nBob Saget was an American actor, stand-up comedian, and television host from Philadelphia. His best known role was playing pater familias Danny Tanner on the hit sitcom \"Full House\" (1987-1995). He played the character again in the sequel series \"Fuller House\" (2016-2020). Saget served as the original host of the long-running clip show \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" from 1989 to 1997. Saget voiced the narrator in the hit sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\" (2005-2014), depicted as an older version of main character Ted Mosby.\n\nIn 1956, Saget was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia. His parents were supermarket executive Benjamin Saget and hospital administrator Rosalyn \"Dolly\" Saget. The Saget family eventually moved to Norfolk, Virginia. Bob received his early religious education at Temple Israel, a synagogue of Norfolk which adhered to Conservative Judaism. He was reportedly a rebellious student.\n\nSaget spend part of his high school years in Los Angeles, where he befriended veteran comedian Larry Fine (1902-1975). He attended a Philadelphia high school during his senior year. He was originally interested in a medical career but his English teacher Elaine Zimmerman convinced Saget to aspire to an acting or filmmaking career instead.\n\nSaget received his college education at the \"Center for the Performing and Cinematic Arts\", a college associated with the Temple University of Philadelphia. One of his student films won a merit award at the Student Academy Awards. He graduated college with a Bachelor of Arts in 1978. He had already started performing in comedy clubs during his college years.\n\nIn 1978, Saget intended to take graduate courses at the University of Southern California. He dropped out due to health-related problems. He almost died due to a gangrenous appendix, costing him a loss of confidence. He decided afterwards to lose some weight, in the belief that it would improve his health.\n\nFollowing his graduation, Saget spend about a decade working mostly as a comedian. He appeared in minor acting roles in both films and television. In 1987, Saget was performing comedy bits for the short-lived non-fiction show \"The Morning Program\". The show offered a mix of \"news, entertainment and comedy\", but was canceled due to low ratings.\n\nSaget's big break came when he was chosen to portray widowed father Danny Tanner in the sitcom \"Full House\" (1987-1995). The series depicted Danny's efforts to raise three young daughters, with the assistance of his best friends. The show suffered from poor viewership in its first season, but attracted a family audience due to its portrayal of the struggles associated with parenting. By its third season, it was ranked among Nielsen's Top 30 shows. Saget became a household name, and the series lasted for 8 seasons and 192 episodes. The series was eventually canceled due to its increasing production costs. Its rating had remained high until its final episode.\n\nIn 1989, Saget was chosen as the host of the clip show \"America's Funniest Home Videos\". The show featured humorous homemade videos which were submitted by its viewers, often highlighting physical comedy, pranks, or unusual behavior by children and pets. While the show was popular with viewers, Saget himself was increasingly frustrated with its repetitive format. When his contract for the show expired in 1997, Saget was not interested in negotiating for a renewal.\n\nIn 1996, Saget directed the dramatic television film \"For Hope\". The film depicted the struggles of a woman who is slowly dying due to being afflicted with scleroderma, an autoimmune disease with no known cure. Saget was reportedly inspired by the life and death of his sister Gay Saget, who had died due to scleroderma. The film received high ratings in its debut.\n\nIn 1998, Saget directed the comedy film \"Dirty Work\". It depicted two half-brothers who offer to perform revenge schemes for paying clients, but have a personal grudge against a man who reneged on a deal with them. The film under-performed at the box office, but gained a cult following due to its reputation as a \"gag-fest\".\n\nFrom 2001 to 2002, Saget had the starring role of Matt Stewart in the sitcom \"Raising Dad\". The premise of the series was that widowed father Matt Stewart was trying to raise two daughter, while pursuing a teaching career at his eldest's daughter's high school. Despite the series having a similar concept to \"Full House\", it failed to find an audience. It lasted for a single season.\n\nIn 2005, Saget was cast as the narrator in the sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother\" (2005-2014). The premise of the series was that middle-aged Ted Mosby narrates his life story (and the life stories of his best friends) to his son and daughter. The series repeatedly implied that Ted was an unreliable narrator, who either embellished or censored aspects of his various stories. The series was quite popular, lasting for 9 seasons and 208 episodes.\n\nIn 2007, Saget directed the direct-to-video parody film \"Farce of the Penguins\". The film was a full-length parody of the documentary film \"March of the Penguins\" (2005), featuring penguins conversing about their love lives. It featured the voices of several then-popular actors, including several of Saget's former co-stars from \"Full House\".\n\nIn 2009, Saget was cast in the main role of Steve Patterson in the sitcom \"Surviving Suburbia\". The premise of the series was that the members of a suburban family have problems in interacting both with each other, and with their new neighbors. The series only lasted a single season, and struggled with low ratings.\n\nIn 2014, Saget published his memoirs under the title \"Dirty Daddy\". In 2016, a sequel series to \"Full House\" was introduced under the title \"Fuller House\". It featured the lives of two of Danny Tanner's daughters, and Danny's grandchildren. Saget played the recurring role of Danny for 15 episodes. The sequel series lasted for 5 seasons. This was Saget's last major role in a sitcom. He continued, however, to regularly host television events.\n\nIn January 2022, Saget was in Florida for a stand-up tour. On January 9, Saget was discovered dead in his hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, located south of Orlando, Florida. He was 65-years-old. His autopsy revealed that the cause of death was blunt head trauma from an accidental blow to the back of his head, likely from a fall. He had died in his sleep. He was buried at the Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery, next to the graves of his parents and his sister. Mourners honored Saget by offering donations to the charity \"Scleroderma Research Foundation\" (SRF), since Saget had long served in its board of directors. Saget is gone, but his popularity endures due to his acting and directing roles in several popular films and television shows.\n\nBorn on August 21, 1939, the son of a displaced musician, Harlem-born actor Clarence Williams III was raised by his musical grandparents, the legendary jazz and boogie-woogie composer/pianist Clarence Williams, who wrote such classics as \"T'Aint Nobody's Business If I Do\" and \"Baby, Won't You Please Come Home,\" and blues singer Eva Taylor. While attending a local YMCA as a teen, Williams became interested in dramatics.\n\nAfter a two-year hitch with the U.S. Air Force, he started his acting career, making a minor New York stage debut with \"The Long Dream\" in 1960. He continued impressively with roles in \"Walk in Darkness\" (1963), \"Sarah and the Sax\" (1964) and \"Doubletalk\" (1964), and capped his early career with a Theatre World Award and Tony-nomination for the three-person play \"Slow Dance on the Killing Ground\" (1964). Continuing on with powerful work in \"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" (1966) and \"King John,\" Vietnam-era Hollywood finally began to take notice of his \"angry young man\" charisma.\n\nHis casting as former delinquent-turned-undercover cop Linc Hayes on the highly popular TV cop series Twen-Police (1968) along with fellow white partners Michael Cole and Peggy Lipton was a huge break for all three relative unknowns. Sporting a huge Afro, paisley shirts, dark shades and spouting catchprase language like \"dig it\" and \"solid,\" the gap-toothed Linc (and his mod partners) showed the requisite anti-establishment defiance and coolness to attract the hip generation--while still playing good guys.\n\nFollowing the series' demise in 1973, he purposely avoided the \"blaxploitation\" Hollywood scene and returned to the stage, notably on Broadway opposite Maggie Smith in Tom Stoppard's play \"Night and Day\" (1979). In the 80s he launched an enviable character career in films, often playing a cool, streetwise character or threatening menace. Among his better-known on-screen assignments is the role of Prince's abusive father in Purple Rain (1984), a burnt-out political activist in the spoof Ghettobusters (1988), the recurring part of Roger Hardy in the twisted cult TV series Das Geheimnis von Twin Peaks (1990), a good-guy cop in Jenseits der weißen Linie (1992), an rioter in the Attica-themed mini-series Against the Wall (1994) and Wesley Snipes heroin-addicted dad in Sugar Hill (1993), among others. Powerful roles on such shows as \"Law & Order,\" \"Profiler\" and \"Judging Amy\" has kept him strongly in the limelight.\n\nMillennium acting work included solid performances in the films Wild Christmas (2000), Ritual (2000), Blue Hill Avenue (2001), The Extreme Team (2003), Constellation (2005), The Blue Hour (2007),The Way of War (2009), A Day in the Life (2009), Der Butler (2013) and Mr. Malevolent (2018), as well as his interesting role as mysterious book store manager Philby in the lengthy Mystery Woman (2003) series of TV movies (2003-2007). Clarence also made guest appearances on TV programs, \"Cold Case,\" \"Memphis Beat,\" \"Justified\" and \"Empire,\" to name a few.\n\nWed to wife Kelly until his death, Clarence was first married to actress Gloria Foster (1967-1984). The two appeared together in the movie Die lässige Welt (1963). Following their divorce, they remained friendly and, upon her death in 2001, it was he who made the formal announcement.\n\nLong a vital, respected thespian of the classic and contemporary stage, this grand lady did not become a household name and sought-after film actress until age 56 when she turned in a glorious, Oscar-winning performance as Cher's sardonic mother in the romantic comedy Mondsüchtig (1987). Movie (and TV) fans then discovered what East coast theater-going audiences had uncovered decades before -- Olympia Dukakis was an acting treasure. Her adaptability to various ethnicities (Greek, Italian, Jewish, Eastern European, etc.), as well her chameleon-like versatility in everything from cutting edge comedy to stark tragedy, kept her in high demand for 30 years as one of Hollywood's topnotch character players.\n\nOlympia Dukakis was born on June 20, 1931, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Greek immigrants, Alexandra (Christos), from the Peloponnese, and Constantine S. Dukakis, from Anatolia. She majored in physical therapy at Boston University, where she graduated with a BA. Olympia practiced as a physical therapist during the polio epidemic. She later returned to her alma mater and entered the graduate program in performing arts, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree.\n\nOlympia found early success by distinguishing herself first on stage performing in summer stock and with several repertory and Shakespearean companies throughout the county. She made her Broadway debut as an understudy in \"The Aspern Papers\" at age 30, followed by very short runs in the plays \"Abraham Cochrane\" (1964) and \"Who's Who in Hell\" (1974). In 1999, she premiered a one-woman play \"Rose,\" at the National Theatre in London and subsequently on Broadway in 2000. The play earned her an Outer Critics Circle Award and Drama Desk Award nomination and she continues to tour the country with it.\n\nOlympia was seen on the New York stage in the Roundabout Theatre's production of \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\" (2011), in San Francisco in A.C.T.'s production of \"Vigil\" (2011) and as \"Prospera\" in \"The Tempest\" (2012) at Shakespeare & Co. She has performed in over 130 productions Off-Broadway and regionally at theaters including the Public Theatre, A.C.T., Shakespeare in the Park, Shakespeare & Co., and the Williamstown Summer Theatre Festival, where she also served as Associate Director. She was seen again at Shakespeare & Co. in the summer of 2013 as the title role in \"Mother Courage and Her Children.\"\n\nOlympia married Yugoslav-American actor Louis Zorich in 1962. The New York-based couple went on to co-found The Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, New Jersey, and ran the company for 19 years (1971-1990). As actress, director, producer and teacher, she still found the time to raise their three young children. She also became a master instructor at New York University for fourteen years. She scored theater triumphs in \"A Man's a Man,\" for which she won an Off-Broadway Obie Award in 1962; several productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Mother Courage\"; \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\"; \"The Rose Tattoo\"; \"The Seagull\"; \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (another Obie Award); and, more notably, her many performances as the title role in \"Hecuba.\" A good portion of her successes was launched within the walls of her own theater company, which encouraged the birth of new and untried plays.\n\nOlympia's prolific stage directing credits include many of the classics: \"Orpheus Descending,\" \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" and \"A Touch of the Poet,\" as well as the more contemporary (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Kennedy's Children\"). She also adapted such plays as \"Mother Courage\" and \"The Trojan Women\" for the theater company. Over the duration of their marriage, she and her husband have experienced shared successes, appearing together in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" \"Camino Real, \"The Three Sisters\" and \"The Seagull,\" among many others. Both are master interpreters of Chekhovian plays -- one of their more recent acting collaborations was in \"The Chekhov Cycle\" in 2003.\n\nMaking an inauspicious debut in a bit role as a mental patient in Lilith (1964), she tended to gravitate toward off-the-wall films with various offshoots of the ethnic mother. She played mom to such leads as Dustin Hoffman in John und Mary (1969), Joseph Bologna in the cult comedy Made for Each Other (1971) and Ray Sharkey in Idolmaker - Das schmutzige Geschäft des Showbusiness (1980). Interestingly, it was her scene-stealing work on Broadway in the comedy \"Social Security\" (1986) that caught director Norman Jewison's eye and earned her the Mondsüchtig (1987) movie role. The Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actress was the last of a stream of awards she earned for that part, including the Los Angeles Film Critics, Golden Globe and American Comedy awards.\n\nFrom then on, silver-haired Olympia was frequently first in line for a number of cream-of-the-crop matron roles: Magnolien aus Stahl - Die Stärke der Frauen (1989), Dad (1989), Kuck' mal wer da spricht! (1989), Die sieben besten Jahre (1993), Mr. Holland's Opus (1995) and Mörderisches Herz (1995).\n\nOn TV, she received high praise for her work especially for her sympathetic trans-gendered landlady Anna Madrigal in the acclaimed miniseries Armistead Maupin's Geschichten aus San Franzisko (1993) and its sequels Sweet Home San Francisco (1998) (Emmy Nominee) and Noch Mehr Stadtgeschichten (2001).

This work is among more than 40 other series, mini-series and guest starring roles she accumulated over her long career. Several recurring TV roles also came her way with Center of the Universe (2004), Bored to Death (2009), Sex & Violence (2013), Forgive Me (2013), Switch (2018) and one last return to her popular Anna Madrigal role with the series sequel Stadtgeschichten (2019).\n\nThe septuagenarian hardly slowed down and continued strongly into the millennium with top supporting film credits including The Intended (2002), The Event (2003), the title role in the mystery Charlie's War (2003), The Thing About My Folks (2005), Jesus, Mary and Joey (2005), An ihrer Seite (2006), Day on Fire (2006), Im Land der Frauen (2007), The Last Keepers (2013), A Little Game (2014), 7 Chinese Brothers (2015), The Infiltrator (2016), Secret Links (2016) and Change in the Air (2018). The film Cloudburst (2011), in which she shared a co-lead with Brenda Fricker, became a critical and audience darling, winning a multitude of \"Best Film\" awards and several \"Best Actress\" honors (Seattle, San Diego) at various film festivals.\n\nAn ardent liberal and Democrat, she was the cousin of 1988 presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. Moreover, she was a strong advocate of women's rights and environmental causes. Olympia published her best-selling autobiography \"Ask Me Again Tomorrow: A Life in Progress\" in 2003, an introspective chronicle full of her trademark candor and wry humor.

After training at the Drama Centre London, Helen began her career on stage in the UK and won the Manchester Evening News' Best Actress Award for her performance in the National Theatre's \"Blood Wedding\" and the Ian Charleson award for classical acting for playing \"Rose Trelawney\" in \"Trelawney of the Wells.\" Helen's theatre work continued to win her critical praise and a large fan base through such work as the Royal Shakespeare Company's \"Les Enfant du Paradis\" opposite Joseph Fiennes, Rupert Graves and James Purefoy. At the Almeida Theatre, her productions included \"The Triumph of Love\" opposite Chiwetel Ejiofor and the radical verse production, \"Five Gold Rings,\" opposite Damian Lewis.\n\nHelen also worked extensively at the Donmar Warehouse playing lead roles in \"How I Learnt to Drive,\" \"Old Times\" directed by Roger Michel, and in Sam Mendes' farewell double bill of \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Uncle Vanya\" (a triumph in both London and New York). For her performance in \"Twelfth Night,\" Helen was nominated for the Evening Standard Best Actress Award, and the New York Drama Desk Awards. She also founded the production company \"The Public\" with Michael Sheen, producing new work at the Liverpool Everyman, The Ambassadors and the Donmar (in which she also starred).\n\nWith over twenty productions under her belt, Mike Coveney recently wrote \"We celebrate the careers of great actors Olivier, Ashcroft, Richardson, Gielgud, Dench, the Redgraves, Gambon, Walter, Sher, Russell Beale and McCrory.\"\n\nOn the small screen, Helen's first television film, Karl Francis' Streetlife (1995) with Rhys Ifans, won her the Welsh BAFTA, Monte Carlo Best Actress Award and the Royal Television Society's Best Actress Award, for her extraordinary performance as \"Jo.\" The Edinburgh Film Festival wrote \"simply the best performance this year.\" She went on to win Critics Circle Best Actress Award for her role as the barrister \"Rose Fitzgerald\" in the Channel 4 series North Square (2000), having been previously nominated for her performance in The Fragile Heart (1996). Helen showed diversity as an actress, appearing in comedies such as Lucky Jim (2003) with Stephen Tompkinson or Dead Gorgeous (2002) with Fay Ripley, as well as dramas such as Joe Wright's The Last King (2003) (for which she was nominated for the LA Television Awards) and Anna Karenina (2000).\n\nHelen McCrory died on 16 April, 2021, in London, of cancer. She was 52, and was survived by her husband Damian Lewis and their two children.\n\nHardy Kruger was born Eberhard August Franz Ewald Krüger in Wedding, Berlin, the son of Auguste (Meier) and Max Krüger. At thirteen years, he became a member of the \"Hitler Jugend\" (Hitler Youth), as did all 13-year-old boys in Germany then. The purpose of the organization was to prepare the boys for military service. At age 15, Hardy made his film debut in a German picture (Junge Adler (1944)), but his acting career was interrupted when he was drafted into the German army in 1944 at age 16 and posted to an infantry regiment.\n\nYears later, Hardy related how he \"hated that [Nazi] uniform.\" During the filming of Die Brücke von Arnheim (1977) in which he portrayed a Nazi general, he wore a top-coat over his S.S. uniform between takes so as \"not to remind myself of my childhood in Germany during W.W.II.\" It is said that, during his war years, Hardy was captured and taken prisoner by U.S. forces but attempted to escape thrice, the third time successfully.\n\nAfter the war, Hardy returned to acting and, eight years later, was \"discovered\" by foreign film distributor J. Arthur Rank who promptly cast him in three British pictures, practically filmed back-to-back: Einer kam durch (1957), Mit dem Kopf durch die Wand (1958) and Alles spricht gegen Van Rooyen (1959), in which he appeared simply as a foreigner and not a German, as was usually the case. Following the release of these films, Hardy's career took off. Despite anti-German sentiment that still prevailed in postwar Europe, Hardy, described as \"ruggedly handsome\" and a \"blond heartthrob,\" became an international favorite, paving the way to his first American role as co-star with John Wayne in the Tanganyika-shot wildlife adventure Hatari (1962).\n\nHardy was so taken aback by the beauty of the land, that he bought the film's location (\"Momilla Farm\") and built a small home for himself and a small bungalow hotel for tourists to see the animals. Hunting was forbidden on the property, and, later, a cattle farm was started with the meat being sold to local hotels. Hardy described his home there as \"a sort of African Walden where I can get away from the world from time to time.\"\n\nIn 1979, due to the dissolution of the alliance of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania (formerly Tanganyika), the border with Kenya was closed and remained so for half a decade which caused a serious decline in tourism. The business aspects of his property were shut down for a period of time, but eventually things picked up and the place was transformed into a proper tourist hotel known (fittingly) as Hatari Lodge.\n\nFluent in English, French. and German, Hardy found himself in much demand by British, French, American and German producers and became more selective in his scripts. \"I'd rather sit out a picture than take a role I don't think is right for me\" he would later say. He died in January 2022 in Palm Springs, California, 11 years after his last film credit.\n\nSuzzanne Douglas is an award-winning actress of both screen and stage, whose work has led her through all walks of creative life.

Born Allan George See in Mt. Kisco, New York, on February 28, 1931, and raised in Pleasantville, he was the son of Margaret (Shea) and George See, a gas station owner who was part Chippewa Indian (Ojibwa). He followed his 1952 graduation from Ithaca College (Fine Arts major) with Air Force military duty, then moved to New York City and worked for a while as an usher and elevator operator at Radio City Music Hall. Focusing on acting, he changed his stage name to \"Gavin McLeod.\"\n\nA solid break on Broadway in \"A Hatful of Rain\" in 1956 led to a move to Los Angeles in an attempt to break into film and TV. MacLeod began to earn a minor reputation as a second-string heavy in such crime shows as \"The Thin Man,\" \"Steve Canyon,\" \"Manhunt,\" \"Mr. Lucky,\" \"Peter Gunn,\" \"Michael Shayne,\" \"The Untouchables\" and \"Perry Mason.\" This led to a regular comedy role as part of the McHale's Navy (1962) TV series. He also managed several film roles, although far down the credits, with Laßt mich leben (1958), Der Zwang zum Bösen (1959), Mit Blut geschrieben (1959), Unternehmen Petticoat (1959), Zwölf Stunden lauert der Tod (1960), Der Spätzünder (1960), Hinter feindlichen Linien (1962) and Unternehmen Pferdeschwanz (1964). He was a member of the superb supporting cast of The Sand Pebbles (1966). He returned to Broadway in \"The Captains and the Kings\" in 1962.\n\nMacLeod's career more or less flowed and ebbed until 1972, when his shiftless typecast was shattered forever. As Murray Slaughter, the balding, beaming, wisecracking, gleaming-toothed news writer on Oh Mary (1970), MacLeod became a happy household name. From then on, he could only be envisaged as a lovable schmuck and nice guy. From there he went on to another benign starring role with the TV series, Love Boat (1977), as the ingratiating Captain Stubing.\n\nOn the down side, \"Love Boat\" marred MacLeod's chances to be considered for more challenging work, and his inability to cope with success led to alcoholism and divorce from second wife Patti. However, he later turned his life around, remarried his wife, and they both wrote a book called \"Back on Course\" (1987). MacLeod continued sporadically on the musical stage (\"Gypsy,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"Gigi\"), in TV reunions (\"Love Boat\" specials) and as a TV guest (\"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"The King of Queens,\" \"Oz,\" \"That 70s Show,\" \"JAG\" and \"The Comeback Kid\").\n\nEmmy-nominated actor and producer Michael Kenneth Williams was one of his generation's most respected and acclaimed talents. By bringing complicated and charismatic characters to life--often with surprising tenderness--Williams established himself as a gifted and versatile performer with a unique ability to mesmerize audiences with his stunning character portrayals.\n\nBorn in 1966 in Brooklyn, Williams was best known for his remarkable work on The Wire (2002). The wit and humor that Williams brought to Omar, the whistle-happy, profanity-averse, openly gay drug dealer-robbing stickup man, earned him high praise, and made Omar one of television's most memorable characters. Williams also co-starred in HBO's critically acclaimed series Boardwalk Empire (2010), in which he played Chalky White, a 1920s bootlegger and the impeccably suited, veritable mayor of Atlantic City's African American community. In 2012, \"Boardwalk Empire\" won a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. He received his first Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie for HBO's Bessie (2015) and subsequently received his second nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series for his portrayal of Freddy in HBO's The Night Of: Die Wahrheit einer Nacht (2016).\n\nIn 2018, Vice (2013) returned for its sixth season with an extended special season premiere produced by and featuring Williams as he embarked on a personal journey to expose the root of the American mass incarceration crisis: the juvenile justice system. The episode \"Raised in the System\" offered a frank and unflinching look at those caught up the system, exploring why the country's mass incarceration problem cannot be fixed without first addressing the juvenile justice problem. Williams investigated the solutions that local communities were employing that resulted in drastic drops in both crime and incarceration. Michael garnered his first Emmy nomination as a producer for this incredible documentary and continues to host screenings across the country as a way to educate and raise awareness.\n\nGiving back to the community played an important role in Williams' off-camera life. He launched Making Kids Win, a charitable organization, the primary objective of which is to build community centers in urban neighborhoods that are in need of safe spaces for children to learn and play. Williams served as the ACLU's Ambassador of Smart Justice.\n\nWilliams began his career as a performer by dancing professionally at age 22. After numerous appearances in music videos and as a background dancer on concert tours for Madonna and George Michael, Williams decided to pursue acting seriously. He participated in several productions of the La MaMA Experimental Theater, the prestigious National Black Theater Company. and the Theater for a New Generation, directed by Mel Williams.\n\nMichael K. Williams was born, raised, and resided in Brooklyn, New York, until his death on September 6, 2021."
