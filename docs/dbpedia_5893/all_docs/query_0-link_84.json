        "text": "My mother was brought to this country from Budapest, Hungary, when she was sixteen. Her parents were fleeing the Hungarian revolution against the communist government in 1957. New to America, she spoke little English. She met a young man of Irish descent. Soon, I was born, placed for adoption, and raised by a young married couple ─ a mother whose family came from Europe and a father whose parents had emigrated from a shtetl in Lithuania.\n\nAll of us who live in this country have an immigrant story. Everyone here comes from somewhere else.\n\nThe startling reminder in France-Luce Benson’s Detained is that for many, once here, their home is not guaranteed safe – no matter how long they’ve lived in the U.S. Many residents can still be removed from their family, confined, and expelled from the country. Even if they’ve paid taxes for years, have a green card, or have served in the military defending this nation.\n\nBased on true stories, Detained premieres on the Fountain stage at an urgent time in our nation’s history. I believe theatre has the power to wake us up, open our eyes, shake us out of complacency. The Latin root of the word “actor”, from Ancient Greek, means to do, to drive, set in motion, get things done. My hope is that experiencing Detained triggers in you the need to take action. As these real-life human stories in this powerful new work remind us, there is much to be done.\n\nOnward\n\nStephen\n\nWhenever I am asked, “Where are you from?” I hesitate. Both the question and the answer are loaded with years, decades, generations of struggle, sacrifice, oppression, persecution, and a complicated mix of pride, shame, grief, and gratitude. The best way to answer is…I am not from here. I moved to Los Angeles from New York in 2018. I moved to New York from Miami, Fla, in 2000. I moved to Miami from Boston, MA, when I was seven. To Boston from Canada as a toddler. To Canada from Africa, where I was born, as an infant. And both of my parents are from Haiti. I am not from here. This has always been my reality. I understand, profoundly, what it feels like to exist in a place that is both home and not home. Even as an American Citizen, grateful for the freedom of artistic expression, the right to vote, and the countless privileges I often take for granted – my connection to this country still feels precarious; my identity ambiguous. What I am certain of is I am among the majority. Like the characters in this play, like most of us in this country, my family came to America for a better life, and in that pursuit, make America better. As I have gotten to know the people in this play, including the many whose stories you will not get to hear, I am not only humbled by their resilience, but by the contributions they continue to make to our society. Oftentimes, racially charged conversations about immigration focus on what “they take” but rarely on what is gained. I hope that this play will speak to the full spectrum of the immigrant experience in America, and most importantly, help us to understand what is lost. When mothers, fathers, children, siblings, students, farmers, Veterans are detained and deported, we lose so much more than the sum of their lives and their future contributions, which are already immeasurable. But we lose the backbone, the heart, and the soul of our country. Because the majority of us are not from here. For many of us, our American story began long before we arrived, and without us, America as we know it today would not exist.\n\n-France-Luce Benson\n\nThe dramatic increase in deportation and detention directly resulted from harsh laws enacted by congress in 1996 and signed into law by then-President Clinton. Under these laws, longtime legal residents -- including those who had served in the U.S. military -- faced mandatory deportation and detention for relatively minor crimes. Even when they had committed those crimes years before, had served their sentences (assuming they had even received a prison sentence), and were fully rehabilitated contributing members of their communities.\n\nMuch of my work at the ACLU focused on challenging portions of the 1996 laws which required mandatory detention of individuals. I argued the issue before the Supreme Court in 2003 and lost by a vote of 5-4. Mandatory detention continues to this day, meaning immigrants are locked up without the most basic right to a bond hearing\n\nDescribing my idea for a play in 2015, I wrote that: “Deportations of immigrants have reached record levels. Yet despite the scale and its devastating impact – 400,00 people deported each year, 1100 each day, and hundreds of thousands locked up in immigration jails around the country – what is taking place and who is being affected is largely unknown to the general public”.\n\nAlthough I had worked in documentary film before becoming a lawyer, I thought theatre would be a more powerful medium for telling this story. So, I started collecting material — stories of people I was representing who were locked up without a bond hearing; and letters from the immigration detainees who wrote us describing the conditions they faced in detention, desperate for a lawyer to help them fight their cases. (Because of the fiction that deportation is not “punishment,” -- but merely the withdrawal of a privilege -- the government does not provide lawyers to people in deportation proceedings. Thus, immigrants are locked up facing permanent banishment from their homes and separation from their families, without even a lawyer to advise them.)\n\nI began interviewing some of the people you see in the play -- Melida, her daughter Mercedes, Warren Joseph, the Gulf War veteran -- and collected other statements that I thought would add some needed humor. Like Ravi’s story of his electronic monitoring device going off, he told during a detention conference in which we were both featured panelists.\n\nThe stories you see in the play are just a tiny fraction of the stories I collected, and those, in turn are just a small fraction of the millions of immigrants deported and detained in the last 25 years.\n\nAt some point, I realized I needed the help of a playwright to turn these stories into a compelling piece of theatre. This led me to France-Luce. I can still remember our first meeting, back in 2014, sharing my goals for the play and handing over to her several huge ring binders with the material I had collected. France-Luce embraced the project as her own. And in the years that followed, the play evolved. We conducted more interviews, some of which made it into the final script, and others didn’t but helped shape the play. Then Trump was elected. Then COVID. Now Biden. The play kept changing into the one you are seeing today.\n\nBut the goal always remained the same: to create an emotionally compelling and thought-provoking piece of theatre that would further public awareness of what is occurring – both humanizing the people who are affected and stimulating a broader questioning of the laws and policy choices that are fueling it. I hope it has accomplished that.\n\nCREW"
