        "text": "So, who did The Actor statue go to at the 2024 SAG Awards?\n\nNo need to panic, we've got you covered. ICYMI, the Feb. 24 event—streaming on Netflix at 8 p.m. ET from Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall—honored the best in TV and film, and this year's nominees were nothing short of fantastic.\n\nEspecially if you were Barbie's Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Though the Greta Gerwig-directed movie ultimately lost Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture to Oppenheimer, the Barbie-Ken duo still walked away winners after they dropped jaws on the red carpet.\n\nThe competition was stiff on the TV side, too. While the fourth and final season of Succession earned five nominations—including noms for Sarah Snook, Kieran Culkin, Matthew MacFadyen and Brian Cox and a trophy for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series—The Bear and Ted Lasso weren't far behind, with each show nabbing four nods. (You need to see Jason Sudeikis' reaction to Jeremy Allen White winning Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series over him.)\n\nPlus, Barbra Streisand now needs to make room in her trophy case as she received the Life Achievement Award, presented by Jennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper.\n\n\"I remember dreaming of being an actress as a teenager sitting in my bed in Brooklyn with a pint of coffee ice cream, and a movie magazine,\" the EGOT winner shared while on stage accepting her accolade. \"I didn't like reality. I wanted to be in the movies. Even though I knew I didn't look like the other women. My mother said you better learn to type but I didn't listen, and somehow, some way, it all came true.\"\n\nAs for who else's dreams came true when they won an Actor statue? Read on for the full list of winners..."
