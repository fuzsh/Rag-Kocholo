Kelsey currently serves as Associate Artistic Director for WaterTower Theatre.\n\nAbout the Writer / Composer\n\nJASON ROBERT BROWN, Writer/Composer\n\nJason Robert Brown is the ultimate multi-hyphenate - an equally skilled composer, lyricist, conductor, arranger, orchestrator, director and performer - best known for his dazzling scores to several of the most renowned musicals of his generation, including the recently revived The Last Five Years, his debut song cycle Songs for a New World, and the seminal Parade, for which he won the 1999 Tony Award for Best Score. Jason Robert Brown has been hailed as \"one of Broadway's smartest and most sophisticated songwriters since Stephen Sondheim\" (Philadelphia Inquirer), and his \"extraordinary, jubilant theater music\" (Chicago Tribune) has been heard all over the world, whether in one of the hundreds of productions of his musicals every year or in his own incendiary live performances. The New York Times refers to Jason as \"a leading member of a new generation of composers who embody high hopes for the American musical.\" He was awarded two TONY Awards in 2014 for writing and orchestrating The Bridges of Madison County, a musical adapted with Marsha Norman from the bestselling novel, directed by Bartlett Sher and starring Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale. A film version of his epochal Off-Broadway musical The Last Five Years, starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan, was released in 2014, directed by Richard LaGravenese. Honeymoon In Vegas, based on Andrew Bergman's film, premiered on Broadway in 2015 to rave reviews, including a review in the New York Times comparing Jason favorably to Rodgers and Hammerstein. His major musicals as composer and lyricist include: 13, written with Robert Horn and Dan Elish, which began its life in Los Angeles in 2007 and opened on Broadway in 2008 (and was subsequently directed by the composer for its West End premiere in 2012); The Last Five Years, which was cited as one of Time Magazine's 10 Best of 2001 and won Drama Desk Awards for Best Music and Best Lyrics (and was subsequently directed by the composer in its record-breaking Off-Broadway run at Second Stage Theatre in 2013); Parade, written with Alfred Uhry and directed by Harold Prince, which premiered at Lincoln Center Theatre in 1998, and subsequently won both the Drama Desk and New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards for Best New Musical, as well as garnering Jason the Tony Award for Original Score; and Songs for a New World, a theatrical song cycle directed by Daisy Prince, which played Off-Broadway in 1995, and has since been seen in hundreds of productions around the world. Parade was also the subject of a major revival directed by Rob Ashford, first at London's Donmar Warehouse and then at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. His orchestral adaptation of E.B. White's novel The Trumpet of the Swan premiered at the Kennedy Center with John Lithgow and the National Symphony Orchestra, and the CD was released on PS Classics. A live recording entitled Jason Robert Brown in Concert with Anika Noni Rose (LIVE) was released by JRB Records in 2015. Future projects include a new chamber musical created with Daisy Prince and Jonathan Marc Sherman called The Connector, and an untitled new piece created with Claudia Shear and Casey Nicholaw. Jason is the winner of the 2002 Kleban Award for Outstanding Lyrics and the 1996 Gilman & Gonzalez-Falla Foundation Award for Musical Theatre.

He has also contributed music to the hit Nickelodeon television series, The Wonder Pets. His scores are published by Hal Leonard. Jason taught musical theater performance and composition at the USC School of Dramatic Arts. For the musical Prince of Broadway, a celebration of the career of Harold Prince that premiered in 2015, Jason served as the musical supervisor and arranger. Other recent New York credits as conductor and arranger include Urban Cowboy the Musical on Broadway; Oliver Goldstick's play, Dinah Was, directed by David Petrarca, at the Gramercy Theatre and on national tour; and William Finn's A New Brain, directed by Graciela Daniele, at Lincoln Center Theater.
