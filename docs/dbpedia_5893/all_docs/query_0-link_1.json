        "text": "SAG Notable Facts and Figures\n\nThirteen winners for best cast ensemble have won the Oscar for best picture.\n\nFour films have won the Oscar for best picture without being nominated for cast ensemble: “Braveheart” (1995), “The Shape of Water” (2017), “Green Book” (2018) and “Nomadland” (2020).\n\nOnly one film has won cast ensemble without being nominated for best picture: MGM/UAR’s “The Birdcage” (1996)\n\n11 women have directed films nominated for cast ensemble: Jocelyn Moorhouse (“How to Make an American Quilt”), Valerie Faris (“Little Miss Sunshine”), Kathryn Bigelow (“The Hurt Locker”), Lone Scherfig (“An Education”), Lisa Cholodenko (“The Kids Are All Right”), Dee Rees (“Mudbound”), Greta Gerwig (“Lady Bird”), Regina King (“One Night in Miami”), Siân Heder (“CODA”) and Sarah Polley (“Women Talking”). None have done it a second time. Faris and Heder are the only winners to date.\n\nThe directors whose movies have been nominated for cast ensemble the most: Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, Peter Jackson, David O. Russell, Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott’s films have been nominated three times.\n\nNo director has helmed a SAG ensemble winner more than once.\n\nThe record for the most nominations for cast ensemble solely is Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt with seven each.\n\nThe studio that has won the most cast ensemble prizes – Fox Searchlight Pictures (now Searchlight Pictures) with six: “The Full Monty” (1997), “Sideways” (2004), “Little Miss Sunshine” (2006), “Slumdog Millionaire” (2008), “Birdman” (2014) and “Three Billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri” (2017)\n\nA24 is the only studio to win five film awards in one year: 2022 with “Everything Everywhere All at Once” and its actors Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, and Brendan Fraser (“The Whale”).\n\n“Everything Everywhere All at Once” holds the record for the most wins with four — cast ensemble, actress, supporting actor and supporting actress.\n\nFive movies have received the most SAG Award nominations in one year, with five apiece: “Shakespeare in Love” (1998), “Chicago” (2002), “Doubt” (2008), “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once” “Banshees” is the only film not to win any of its categories.\n\nThe studio with the most nominations for cast ensemble: Fox Searchlight Pictures (now Searchlight Pictures) with 16.\n\nTwo studios have had the most films nominated for cast ensemble in a single year – Netflix in 2020 (“Da 5 Bloods,” “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” and “The Trial of the Chicago 7”) and Miramax has done it twice: in 1996 (“The English Patient,” “Marvin’s Room” and “Sling Blade”) and 1998 (“Life is Beautiful,” “Little Voice” and “Shakespeare in Love”). 1996 is the only year that all three of its nominees lost, coincidentally, to a film that wasn’t nominated for best picture, “The Birdcage.”"
