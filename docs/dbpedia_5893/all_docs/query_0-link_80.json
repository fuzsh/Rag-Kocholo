        "text": "The third installment in the “Magic Mike” series danced its way to the top of the box office charts this weekend with a James Cameron double header, “Avatar: The Way of Water” and “Titanic” (yes that “Titanic”), looming close behind.\n\nFILE - In this Feb. 21, 2015 file photo, an Oscar statue appears outside the Dolby Theatre for the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)With less than a month until showtime, the 93rd Oscars are taking another pass at the script. The main event will still take place at Los Angeles’ Union station which will include a red carpet component but they are planning something special for the UK location. The show is also working with local broadcast affiliates around the world to provide satellite links for other international nominees. The 93rd Oscars will be broadcast live on ABC on April 25 at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe 93rd Oscars will be held on April 25. (Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP, File)With nominations set and just over a month until showtime, details are trickling out about the 93rd Oscars and neither sweatshirts nor Zoom made the cut. They’ve enlisted Emmy and Tony Award winning director Glenn Weiss to direct the live broadcast on April 25. The producers said they plan to treat the event like an active movie set with on-site COVID safety teams and testing protocols. The 93rd Oscars will be broadcast live on ABC on April 25 starting at 8 p.m.\n\nZhao, the first woman of color nominated for best director, is the most nominated woman in a single year in Oscar history. She was also tipped for the film’s adapted screenplay, editing and as a producer in the best picture category. “I just quietly gave thanks and felt some gratitude.”Davis, who won for her performance in 2016’s “Fences,” landed her fourth Oscar nomination, making her the most nominated Black actress ever. The Academy Awards would typically have happened by now but this year will be telecast April 25. “Collective,” the Romanian documentary about investigative journalism and government corruption, became just the second film nominated for both best documentary and best international film.\n\nFILE - In this Feb. 21, 2015 file photo, an Oscar statue appears outside the Dolby Theatre for the 87th Academy Awards in Los Angeles. The theater has been the home of the Oscars since 2001 and the organizers say the upcoming show will keep that tradition, but they will enlist a supporting cast of venues. An academy spokesperson said Wednesday that the ceremony this year will be broadcast live from multiple locations on April 25. An academy spokesperson said Wednesday that the ceremony will broadcast live from multiple locations on April 25. The Golden Globes, which has also been scarce on specific details, is planning its own bicoastal broadcast for Feb. 28.\n\nA representative for the Directors Guild of America said his family informed the organization that he passed Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021. (Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)Michael Apted, the acclaimed British director of the “Up” documentary series and films as diverse as the Loretta Lynn biopic “Coal Miner’s Daughter” and the James Bond film “The World Is Not Enough,” has died. A representative for the Directors Guild of America said his family informed the organization that he passed Thursday night. Apted served as a researcher on the first film and took over as director seven years later, continuing to check in with the subjects every seven years. “The series was an attempt to do a long view of English society,” Apted told Slant Magazine in 2019.\n\nOscar-winning filmmaker Steven Soderbergh is going behind the scenes for the next Academy Awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Tuesday that Soderbergh, “Erin Brokovich” producer Stacey Sher and awards show veteran Jesse Collins have come on board to produce the 93rd Oscars telecast. The 93rd Academy Awards were delayed two months earlier this year because of COVID-19’s effects on the film industry, but the show will still be televised live on ABC on April 25, 2021. Academy President David Rubin and Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said that this upcoming show is “the perfect occasion for innovation and re-envisioning the possibilities for the awards show.”Collins also has experience. Earlier this year produced the virtual BET Awards and is also producing the Grammy Awards and the Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nIn an interview by phone, he spoke about that prophetic 2011 film, leading Hollywood’s return to production and the future of the movie industry post-pandemic. Soderbergh: At the end of the day, what’s most important and irreducible is: You need talented people making stuff that’s good. AP: Do you think the kinds of movies that get made will change if the industry permanently shifts toward streaming? When you make a movie that blows up at the box office, that’s just too lucrative to ever abandon. There’s a zeitgeist aspect to any movie that makes $1 billion, and it’s got an expiration date.\n\nMOVIES— Travel may seem closed off right now but how about a cruise with Meryl Streep, Dianne Wiest and Candice Bergen? — If one Streep film wasn’t enough for you, she’s again in typically fine form in “The Prom,” parodying a diva actor in Ryan Murphy’s adaptation of the 2018 Broadway musical. — AP Film Writer Jake CoyleMUSIC— Jon Bon Jovi has already produced an album this year with “2020” and the concert film \"On a Night Like This — Bon Jovi 2020.\" — AP Entertainment Writer Mark KennedyTELEVISION— This season’s winner for lengthy title: “High School Musical: The Musical: The Holiday Special,” debuting Friday on Disney +. — The CW’s “iHeartRadio Jingle Ball 2020,” a 90-minute special based on the annual concert, will air at 8 p.m. EST Monday, Dec. 14.\n\nHollywoods awards season has gone virtual. For Awards Daily founder Sasha Stone, who has been covering the Oscars since 2000, it’s like nothing she’s ever seen — an awards season without glamour, without red carpets, without anything that feels real. And awards season, such as it is, has gone virtual. The Oscar race will Zoomed. Not everyone is sorry that awards season — an increasingly bloated, overlong, high-priced slog from September to February — has been turned upside down.\n\nThis cover image provided by Alfred A.
