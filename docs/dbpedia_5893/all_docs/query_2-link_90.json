        "text": "Sir Antony Sher and Susan Danford in ‘Broken Glass’\n\nThe Fugard Theatre will welcome Sir Antony Sher to the Fugard stage for Arthur Miller’s haunting ‘Broken Glass’, directed by Janice Honeyman, from March 22 to April 16.\n\nAt the end of last year, Sher starred in a sell-out season of the Olivier award-winning drama at The Tricycle Theatre in London. He will be joined by a distinguished South African cast including Susan Danford, Stephen Jennings, Anthea Thompson, Claire Berlein and Patrick Lyster.\n\nSher, who plays the role of Philip Gellburg, was born and brought up in Sea Point, Cape Town.\n\nHe went to England in 1968 to study drama at the Weber Douglas Academy. As an Associate Artist of the Royal Shakespeare Company, his roles have included Richard III, Macbeth, Shylock, lago, Leontes, and Prospero in ‘The Tempest’.\n\nThe latter was a co-production with the Baxter Theatre and was also directed by Honeyman. His film and television roles have included ‘Mrs. Brown’, ‘Alive and Kicking’, ‘The History Man’, ‘Home’, ‘Macbeth’ and ‘Primo’. Among numerous awards, he has won the Olivier Best Actor Award on two occasions for ‘Richard III’ and ‘Torch Song Trilogy’. Locally, he has also won The Fleur du Cap Award for Best Solo Performance (‘Primo’).\n\nIn ‘Broken Glass’, Miller explores themes of guilt, personal tragedy and love in the lives of a Jewish couple living in New York in 1938, deeply affected by the horrific anti-Semitic events of that ominous night. A major, coordinated attack on Jews throughout Germany on the night of November 9, 1938, and into the next day, is recorded in the history books as Kristallnacht, or The Night of Broken Glass.\n\nJewish homes, shops and villages throughout Germany and parts of Austria were ransacked, leaving the streets covered in pieces of smashed windows. It is regarded by many historians as one of the events that pre-empted the Holocaust.\n\n* Book at Computicket."
