        "text": "Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” scored three big wins at the 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards on Saturday night, adding even more industry prizes to its formidable war chest.\n\nThe film’s top honor, the SAG Award for best ensemble, brought cast members, including Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt, to the stage. Their co-star Kenneth Branagh noted that they were last together in July, when they walked out of the biopic’s premiere in solidarity with the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\n“This is a full-circle moment for us,” Branagh said.\n\nThus far, “Oppenheimer” has won top prizes at the Golden Globes, BAFTA and Critics Choice Awards and is considered the front-runner for the best picture Oscar. Last year’s best-picture winner, “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” also triumphed at the SAGs first, though only five of the last 10 ensemble winners have gone on to Oscar glory.\n\nThe SAG Awards have a much better track record when it comes to clarifying the individual acting races, since those winners have matched up exactly with the Oscars each of the last two years. In the competitive best actor race, “Oppenheimer” star Murphy triumphed over Paul Giamatti (“The Holdovers”) and Bradley Cooper (“Maestro”), among others, for his performance as the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nAnd though “Poor Things” star Emma Stone won the BAFTA for best actress last weekend, “Killers of the Flower Moon” star Lily Gladstone triumphed at SAG for her turn as an Osage woman whose family members are murdered by her husband (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his uncle (Robert De Niro).\n\nIn the supporting races, SAG honored Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who played a grieving school cook in “The Holdovers,” and Downey, who delivered a seething performance as a political operative in “Oppenheimer.” Both stars have dominated the season and will almost certainly cruise to Oscar-night victory.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
