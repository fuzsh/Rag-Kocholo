Bob Odenkirk, RJ Mitte, Anna Gunn, Aaron Paul, Jonathan Banks, Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris were along on hand for the reunion as they did a bit before announcing the winner.\n\n\"Succession\" ultimately took home the win, with most, if not all of the cast, taking the stage.\n\n\"One last hurrah, I think,\" Alan Ruck said, accepting the award. \"Right now, you're looking at some of the luckiest people on the planet and some of the most grateful.\"\n\nCillian Murphy reveals nickname for the 'Oppenheimer' cast\n\nCall them the \"Oppenhomies.\"\n\nCillian Murphy, accepting a SAG Award for his starring role in \"Oppenheimer,\" commented on the moniker given to the cast.

And so many people who have done that are sitting right here tonight in this room.\"\n\nThanking those who she has collaborated with, she said, \"I loved working with you, playing with you and inhabiting that magical world of the movies with you.\"\n\nMelissa McCarthy had a simple request for Billie Eilish at the SAG Awards: 'Will you sign my face?'\n\nWhile presenting the award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a comedy, Melissa McCarthy seized the opportunity to spend time with her idol, Billie Eilish.\n\nThe comedian turned to her co-presenter during the ceremony with a simple request: \"Will you sign my face?\"\n\nMcCarthy handed Eilish a Sharpie pen, and the joke went to the next level as the singer literally wrote her name on the actor's forehead.\n\nPedro Pascal says he didn't expect to win at the SAG Awards: 'I thought I could get drunk'\n\nPedro Pascal took home the SAG Award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a drama series — and even he couldn't believe it.\n\nWhile Kieran Culkin had been taking home wins for his role in \"Succession\" throughout awards season, Pascal was named the winner for his role in \"The Last of Us.\"\n\n\"This is wrong for a number of reasons,\" Pascal said during his acceptance speech. \"I'm a little drunk. I thought I could get drunk.\"\n\nThe actor continued to thank HBO and those who believed in him as an actor, his family and more.\n\n\"I'm going to have a panic attack, and I'm going to leave,\" he said wrapping up his speech.\n\nBackstage with Tan France, he talked about winning over Culkin amid their ongoing \"feud,\" saying, \"I'm going to make out with Kieran, that will be my revenge,\" before recalling how the two have become friends over the years.\n\nEric Stonestreet jokes he'll FaceTime Travis Kelce during the SAG Awards\n\nThe stars of \"Modern Family\" took the stage at Saturday's award ceremony to present the award for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series.\n\nJulie Bowen, Ty Burrell, Ed O’Neill, Sofia Vergara, Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson acted like an old family, reminiscing on their hit show and humble-bragging about what they're up to now.\n\nVergara shouted out her successful Netflix drama series \"Griselda,\" while Stonestreet, a famous Kansas City Chiefs fan, proudly declared, \"I know Travis Kelce. I could FaceTime right now, I'm being serious.\"\n\nKelce just returned to the U.S. after visiting his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, in Sydney amid her \"Eras Tour.\"\n\nThe award went to the cast of \"The Bear.\"\n\nStrong start for 'The Bear'\n\nFollowing on the heels of a stellar performance at the Emmy Awards, stars of \"The Bear\" have won two of the three categories they are nominated for.\n\nJeremy Allen White won outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series, and Ayo Edebiri took home the award for best actress in a comedy.\n\nThe show is also nominated for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy.\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph says it would be 'amazing' to win SAG Award\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph is nominated in the outstanding performance by a female actor in a supporting role for her role in \"The Holdovers.\"\n\nWhile talking to TODAY.com on the red carpet, the actor said winning the award \"would mean a lot.\"\n\n\"That’s amazing because I wouldn’t be here without a lot of people that are very near and dear to me,\" she said, thanking people who she looks up to, haven't been given credit and \"who this role is a part of and they help me create it.\"\n\nAdding, \"So it would mean a lot.\"\n\nShe is up against Emily Blunt, Danielle Brooks, Penélope Cruz and Jodie Foster.\n\nRhea Perlman and Lisa Ann Walter take swigs from a flask during the opening of the SAG Awards\n\nSharing is caring!\n\nThat's what Idris Elba reminded attendees with flasks during his opening to the 2024 SAG Awards. The joke landed with Rhea Perlman and Lisa Ann Walter.\n\nThe camera panned from the \"Luther\" actor to Perlman, holding a silver flask. She then handed it to the \"Abbott Elementary\" star, who took a big swig. Walter then tried offering it to Sheryl Lee Ralph, who watched with a dropped jaw and shook her head no.\n\n'The Devil Wears Prada' reunion brings the nostalgia\n\nIt was a “The Devil Wears Prada” reunion worth waiting for. Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt reunited on stage during the 2024 SAG Awards to present the awards for outstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series.\n\nStreep first stepped out and almost knocked over the microphone, saying that she forgot her glasses and the envelope. Blunt then stepped out to hand Streep the envelope, while Hathaway gave her her glasses.\n\nThey then exchanged quotes from their 2006 comedy, as the audience laughed as they channeled their former characters.\n\n“Meryl and Miranda Priestly are sort of like twins,” Blunt said, with Streep replying, “I don’t think I’m anything like...”\n\n“No, no,” Hathaway then interrupted before quoting Streep’s character. “That wasn’t a question.”\n\nBack in December, Hathaway and Blunt had a mini reunion when they chatted together for Variety's \"Actors on Actors\" series.\n\nIn \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" Hathaway portrayed less-than-fashionable aspiring journalist Andy, who became tough-as-nails fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly's (Meryl Streep) assistant. Blunt portrayed Emily, who also also one of Miranda's assistants.\n\nAnne Hathaway's SAG Awards dress is not just blue — 'it’s actually cerulean'\n\nWhen Meryl Streep calls, you answer.\n\nAnne Hathaway revealed on the red carpet for the 2024 SAG Awards that she didn't hesitate when she was asked to present an award with her fellow \"Devil Wears Prada\" castmates.\n\nHathaway, Streep and \"Oppenheimer\" star Emily Blunt will take the stage together during Saturday night's ceremony, marking a highly anticipated reunion for the cast of the 2006 film.\n\nHathaway said her outfit for the awards show was intentional. The bright blue dress, paired with a belt, is \"actually cerulean,\" she shared.\n\nStreep's character's rant about the evolution of the color in the fashion industry to counter Andy's apathy is one of the most quotable moments of the film.\n\n\"What you don’t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise, it’s not lapis, it’s actually cerulean. And you’re also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns....\" Miranda Priestly famously says.\n\nKathryn Hahn shares how her 'Tiny Beautiful Things' role helped her grow\n\nKathryn Hahn was \"so happy\" and \"humbled\" to be at the 2024 SAG Awards and be nominated, the actor told TODAY.com on the red carpet.\n\nHahn is nominated in the outstanding performance by a female actor in a television movie or limited series for her role “Tiny Beautiful Things.”\n\nWhen asked what a win would mean to her, she said, \"My brain can't, it doesn't even go that far. The fact that I'm in company with this group (is crazy).\"\n\n\"It feels very moving to me to be included in this party,\" she said.\n\nShe also shared that the role in the limited series taught her to \"compartmentalize and how to be able to shake stuff off at the end of the day.\"\n\nShe also called the role \"intense,\" but loved being a part of the ensemble cast.\n\n'Hi Barbie!'
