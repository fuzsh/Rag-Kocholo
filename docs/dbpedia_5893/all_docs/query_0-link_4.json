        "text": "Award-winning actress Helen Elizabeth McCrory was born in London, England, to Welsh-born Anne (Morgans) and Scottish-born Iain McCrory, a diplomat from Glasgow. After training at the Drama Centre London, Helen began her career on stage in the UK and won the Manchester Evening News' Best Actress Award for her performance in the National Theatre's \"Blood Wedding\" and the Ian Charleson award for classical acting for playing \"Rose Trelawney\" in \"Trelawney of the Wells.\" Helen's theatre work continued to win her critical praise and a large fan base through such work as the Royal Shakespeare Company's \"Les Enfant du Paradis\" opposite Joseph Fiennes, Rupert Graves and James Purefoy. At the Almeida Theatre, her productions included \"The Triumph of Love\" opposite Chiwetel Ejiofor and the radical verse production, \"Five Gold Rings,\" opposite Damian Lewis.\n\nHelen also worked extensively at the Donmar Warehouse playing lead roles in \"How I Learnt to Drive,\" \"Old Times\" directed by Roger Michel, and in Sam Mendes' farewell double bill of \"Twelfth Night\" and \"Uncle Vanya\" (a triumph in both London and New York). For her performance in \"Twelfth Night,\" Helen was nominated for the Evening Standard Best Actress Award, and the New York Drama Desk Awards. She also founded the production company \"The Public\" with Michael Sheen, producing new work at the Liverpool Everyman, The Ambassadors and the Donmar (in which she also starred).\n\nWith over twenty productions under her belt, Mike Coveney recently wrote \"We celebrate the careers of great actors Olivier, Ashcroft, Richardson, Gielgud, Dench, the Redgraves, Gambon, Walter, Sher, Russell Beale and McCrory.\"\n\nOn the small screen, Helen's first television film, Karl Francis' Streetlife (1995) with Rhys Ifans, won her the Welsh BAFTA, Monte Carlo Best Actress Award and the Royal Television Society's Best Actress Award, for her extraordinary performance as \"Jo.\" The Edinburgh Film Festival wrote \"simply the best performance this year.\" She went on to win Critics Circle Best Actress Award for her role as the barrister \"Rose Fitzgerald\" in the Channel 4 series North Square (2000), having been previously nominated for her performance in The Fragile Heart (1996). Helen showed diversity as an actress, appearing in comedies such as Lucky Jim (2003) with Stephen Tompkinson or Dead Gorgeous (2002) with Fay Ripley, as well as dramas such as Joe Wright's The Last King (2003) (for which she was nominated for the LA Television Awards) and Anna Karenina (2000).\n\nHelen McCrory died on 16 April, 2021, in London, of cancer. She was 52, and was survived by her husband Damian Lewis and their two children.\n\nLong a vital, respected thespian of the classic and contemporary stage, this grand lady did not become a household name and sought-after film actress until age 56 when she turned in a glorious, Oscar-winning performance as Cher's sardonic mother in the romantic comedy Mondsüchtig (1987). Movie (and TV) fans then discovered what East coast theater-going audiences had uncovered decades before -- Olympia Dukakis was an acting treasure. Her adaptability to various ethnicities (Greek, Italian, Jewish, Eastern European, etc.), as well her chameleon-like versatility in everything from cutting edge comedy to stark tragedy, kept her in high demand for 30 years as one of Hollywood's topnotch character players.\n\nOlympia Dukakis was born on June 20, 1931, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Greek immigrants, Alexandra (Christos), from the Peloponnese, and Constantine S. Dukakis, from Anatolia. She majored in physical therapy at Boston University, where she graduated with a BA. Olympia practiced as a physical therapist during the polio epidemic. She later returned to her alma mater and entered the graduate program in performing arts, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree.\n\nOlympia found early success by distinguishing herself first on stage performing in summer stock and with several repertory and Shakespearean companies throughout the county. She made her Broadway debut as an understudy in \"The Aspern Papers\" at age 30, followed by very short runs in the plays \"Abraham Cochrane\" (1964) and \"Who's Who in Hell\" (1974). In 1999, she premiered a one-woman play \"Rose,\" at the National Theatre in London and subsequently on Broadway in 2000. The play earned her an Outer Critics Circle Award and Drama Desk Award nomination and she continues to tour the country with it.\n\nOlympia was seen on the New York stage in the Roundabout Theatre's production of \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\" (2011), in San Francisco in A.C.T.'s production of \"Vigil\" (2011) and as \"Prospera\" in \"The Tempest\" (2012) at Shakespeare & Co. She has performed in over 130 productions Off-Broadway and regionally at theaters including the Public Theatre, A.C.T., Shakespeare in the Park, Shakespeare & Co., and the Williamstown Summer Theatre Festival, where she also served as Associate Director. She was seen again at Shakespeare & Co. in the summer of 2013 as the title role in \"Mother Courage and Her Children.\"\n\nOlympia married Yugoslav-American actor Louis Zorich in 1962. The New York-based couple went on to co-found The Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, New Jersey, and ran the company for 19 years (1971-1990). As actress, director, producer and teacher, she still found the time to raise their three young children. She also became a master instructor at New York University for fourteen years. She scored theater triumphs in \"A Man's a Man,\" for which she won an Off-Broadway Obie Award in 1962; several productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Mother Courage\"; \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\"; \"The Rose Tattoo\"; \"The Seagull\"; \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (another Obie Award); and, more notably, her many performances as the title role in \"Hecuba.\" A good portion of her successes was launched within the walls of her own theater company, which encouraged the birth of new and untried plays.\n\nOlympia's prolific stage directing credits include many of the classics: \"Orpheus Descending,\" \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" and \"A Touch of the Poet,\" as well as the more contemporary (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Kennedy's Children\"). She also adapted such plays as \"Mother Courage\" and \"The Trojan Women\" for the theater company. Over the duration of their marriage, she and her husband have experienced shared successes, appearing together in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" \"Camino Real, \"The Three Sisters\" and \"The Seagull,\" among many others. Both are master interpreters of Chekhovian plays -- one of their more recent acting collaborations was in \"The Chekhov Cycle\" in 2003.\n\nMaking an inauspicious debut in a bit role as a mental patient in Lilith (1964), she tended to gravitate toward off-the-wall films with various offshoots of the ethnic mother. She played mom to such leads as Dustin Hoffman in John und Mary (1969), Joseph Bologna in the cult comedy Made for Each Other (1971) and Ray Sharkey in Idolmaker - Das schmutzige Geschäft des Showbusiness (1980). Interestingly, it was her scene-stealing work on Broadway in the comedy \"Social Security\" (1986) that caught director Norman Jewison's eye and earned her the Mondsüchtig (1987) movie role. The Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actress was the last of a stream of awards she earned for that part, including the Los Angeles Film Critics, Golden Globe and American Comedy awards.\n\nFrom then on, silver-haired Olympia was frequently first in line for a number of cream-of-the-crop matron roles: Magnolien aus Stahl - Die Stärke der Frauen (1989), Dad (1989), Kuck' mal wer da spricht! (1989), Die sieben besten Jahre (1993), Mr. Holland's Opus (1995) and Mörderisches Herz (1995).\n\nOn TV, she received high praise for her work especially for her sympathetic trans-gendered landlady Anna Madrigal in the acclaimed miniseries Armistead Maupin's Geschichten aus San Franzisko (1993) and its sequels Sweet Home San Francisco (1998) (Emmy Nominee) and Noch Mehr Stadtgeschichten (2001). She was additionally seen in episodes of Bored to Death (2009), and TV movies Die legendären blonden Bombshells (2000) (Judi Dench), Frank Sinatra - Der Weg an die Spitze (1992) (Golden Globe Nominee), and Johanna von Orleans (1999) (Emmy Nominee). This work is among more than 40 other series, mini-series and guest starring roles she accumulated over her long career. Several recurring TV roles also came her way with Center of the Universe (2004), Bored to Death (2009), Sex & Violence (2013), Forgive Me (2013), Switch (2018) and one last return to her popular Anna Madrigal role with the series sequel Stadtgeschichten (2019).\n\nThe septuagenarian hardly slowed down and continued strongly into the millennium with top supporting film credits including The Intended (2002), The Event (2003), the title role in the mystery Charlie's War (2003), The Thing About My Folks (2005), Jesus, Mary and Joey (2005), An ihrer Seite (2006), Day on Fire (2006), Im Land der Frauen (2007), The Last Keepers (2013), A Little Game (2014), 7 Chinese Brothers (2015), The Infiltrator (2016), Secret Links (2016) and Change in the Air (2018). The film Cloudburst (2011), in which she shared a co-lead with Brenda Fricker, became a critical and audience darling, winning a multitude of \"Best Film\" awards and several \"Best Actress\" honors (Seattle, San Diego) at various film festivals.\n\nAn ardent liberal and Democrat, she was the cousin of 1988 presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. Moreover, she was a strong advocate of women's rights and environmental causes. Olympia published her best-selling autobiography \"Ask Me Again Tomorrow: A Life in Progress\" in 2003, an introspective chronicle full of her trademark candor and wry humor. She was also a figure on the lecture circuit covering topics as widespread as life in the theater to feminism, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and osteoporosis.\n\nA hardcore New Yorker, she resided there following the death of her husband in 2018, and until her death in May 2021. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Greek America Foundation, the National Arts Club Medal of Honor, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nDeadpan comedian Charles Sidney Grodin was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania of Russian/Polish ancestry and raised in a Jewish orthodox home. He attended the University of Miami but dropped out, opting instead for the life of a struggling actor. The movie Ein Platz an der Sonne (1951) was said to have steered him towards his chosen profession. In his own words: \"It was two things. One is I think I developed an overwhelming crush on Elizabeth Taylor. And two, Montgomery Clift made acting look like 'Gee, well that looks pretty easy - just a guy talking.'\".\n\nAfter a spell with Uta Hagen (1956-59), he attended Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio before making his stage debut on Broadway in 1962. Though he appeared on screen from as early as 1954, Grodin did not make a great deal of headway in this medium until he attracted critical notice playing the small but crucial role of obstetrician Dr. C.C. Hill in Rosemaries Baby (1968). More substantial roles soon followed. His first major starring turn was in Pferdewechsel in der Hochzeitsnacht (1972), a black comedy written by Neil Simon and directed by Elaine May. Grodin managed to inject charm and humanity in what was essentially an egotistical central character. Film reviewer Roger Ebert praised his performance, describing the actor as a \"kind of Dustin Hoffman-as-overachiever\", an opinion which was echoed by Vincent Canby of the New York Times. Ironically, Grodin had earlier turned down the pivotal role in Die Reifeprüfung (1967) which propelled Hoffman to stardom (he also -- probably unwisely -- spurned the role of oceanographer Matt Hooper in Der weiße Hai (1975) which instead went to Richard Dreyfuss).\n\nGrodin's ultimate breakthrough came on the Broadway stage in \"Same Time Next Year\" (1975) (opposite Ellen Burstyn), a hugely successful romantic comedy about two people, each married to someone else, who conduct an extramarital affair for a single day over the course of 24 years in the same room of a northern Californian inn. Though the two leads left the show after seven months, Grodin was now much sought-after in Hollywood as a droll comic actor and cast in a string of hit comedies: Der Himmel soll warten (1978), Fast wie in alten Zeiten (1980), Ein Single Kommt Selten Allein (1984) and Midnight Run - 5 Tage bis Mitternacht (1988). He also appeared to sterling effect in the underrated farce Der Couch-Trip (1988), in which he co-starred with Walter Matthau and Dan Aykroyd as the brittle psychiatrist and radio host Dr. George Maitlin. Arguably his most popular box office success was opposite the titular Saint Bernard canine in the family-oriented comedy Ein Hund namens Beethoven (1992). Despite less than enthusiastic critical reviews, the film was a hit with audiences, grossed $147.2 million worldwide and spawned a sequel.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Grodin reinvented himself as a television host (Charles Grodin (1995)) and political commentator. He made frequent guest appearances on talk shows with Carson or Letterman, typically adopting the persona of a belligerent tongue-in-cheek character to facilitate \"comically uncomfortable situations on the set\". Grodin was also a prolific author, both of fiction and non-fiction. An autobiography was entitled \"It Would Be So Nice If You Weren't Here: My Journey Through Show Business\" (1989). Charles Grodin died at age 86 of bone marrow cancer on May 18, 2021 at his home in Wilton, Connecticut.\n\nGavin MacLeod's pleasing, agreeable manner on two hit TV series in the 1970s and '80s belied a number of shady villains he portrayed in his early career. Born Allan George See in Mt. Kisco, New York, on February 28, 1931, and raised in Pleasantville, he was the son of Margaret (Shea) and George See, a gas station owner who was part Chippewa Indian (Ojibwa). He followed his 1952 graduation from Ithaca College (Fine Arts major) with Air Force military duty, then moved to New York City and worked for a while as an usher and elevator operator at Radio City Music Hall. Focusing on acting, he changed his stage name to \"Gavin McLeod.\"\n\nA solid break on Broadway in \"A Hatful of Rain\" in 1956 led to a move to Los Angeles in an attempt to break into film and TV. MacLeod began to earn a minor reputation as a second-string heavy in such crime shows as \"The Thin Man,\" \"Steve Canyon,\" \"Manhunt,\" \"Mr. Lucky,\" \"Peter Gunn,\" \"Michael Shayne,\" \"The Untouchables\" and \"Perry Mason.\" This led to a regular comedy role as part of the McHale's Navy (1962) TV series. He also managed several film roles, although far down the credits, with Laßt mich leben (1958), Der Zwang zum Bösen (1959), Mit Blut geschrieben (1959), Unternehmen Petticoat (1959), Zwölf Stunden lauert der Tod (1960), Der Spätzünder (1960), Hinter feindlichen Linien (1962) and Unternehmen Pferdeschwanz (1964). He was a member of the superb supporting cast of The Sand Pebbles (1966). He returned to Broadway in \"The Captains and the Kings\" in 1962.\n\nMacLeod's career more or less flowed and ebbed until 1972, when his shiftless typecast was shattered forever. As Murray Slaughter, the balding, beaming, wisecracking, gleaming-toothed news writer on Oh Mary (1970), MacLeod became a happy household name. From then on, he could only be envisaged as a lovable schmuck and nice guy. From there he went on to another benign starring role with the TV series, Love Boat (1977), as the ingratiating Captain Stubing.\n\nOn the down side, \"Love Boat\" marred MacLeod's chances to be considered for more challenging work, and his inability to cope with success led to alcoholism and divorce from second wife Patti. However, he later turned his life around, remarried his wife, and they both wrote a book called \"Back on Course\" (1987). MacLeod continued sporadically on the musical stage (\"Gypsy,\" \"Annie Get Your Gun,\" \"Gigi\"), in TV reunions (\"Love Boat\" specials) and as a TV guest (\"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Touched by an Angel,\" \"The King of Queens,\" \"Oz,\" \"That 70s Show,\" \"JAG\" and \"The Comeback Kid\").\n\nBorn on August 21, 1939, the son of a displaced musician, Harlem-born actor Clarence Williams III was raised by his musical grandparents, the legendary jazz and boogie-woogie composer/pianist Clarence Williams, who wrote such classics as \"T'Aint Nobody's Business If I Do\" and \"Baby, Won't You Please Come Home,\" and blues singer Eva Taylor. While attending a local YMCA as a teen, Williams became interested in dramatics.\n\nAfter a two-year hitch with the U.S. Air Force, he started his acting career, making a minor New York stage debut with \"The Long Dream\" in 1960. He continued impressively with roles in \"Walk in Darkness\" (1963), \"Sarah and the Sax\" (1964) and \"Doubletalk\" (1964), and capped his early career with a Theatre World Award and Tony-nomination for the three-person play \"Slow Dance on the Killing Ground\" (1964). Continuing on with powerful work in \"Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?\" (1966) and \"King John,\" Vietnam-era Hollywood finally began to take notice of his \"angry young man\" charisma.\n\nHis casting as former delinquent-turned-undercover cop Linc Hayes on the highly popular TV cop series Twen-Police (1968) along with fellow white partners Michael Cole and Peggy Lipton was a huge break for all three relative unknowns. Sporting a huge Afro, paisley shirts, dark shades and spouting catchprase language like \"dig it\" and \"solid,\" the gap-toothed Linc (and his mod partners) showed the requisite anti-establishment defiance and coolness to attract the hip generation--while still playing good guys.\n\nFollowing the series' demise in 1973, he purposely avoided the \"blaxploitation\" Hollywood scene and returned to the stage, notably on Broadway opposite Maggie Smith in Tom Stoppard's play \"Night and Day\" (1979). In the 80s he launched an enviable character career in films, often playing a cool, streetwise character or threatening menace. Among his better-known on-screen assignments is the role of Prince's abusive father in Purple Rain (1984), a burnt-out political activist in the spoof Ghettobusters (1988), the recurring part of Roger Hardy in the twisted cult TV series Das Geheimnis von Twin Peaks (1990), a good-guy cop in Jenseits der weißen Linie (1992), an rioter in the Attica-themed mini-series Against the Wall (1994) and Wesley Snipes heroin-addicted dad in Sugar Hill (1993), among others. Powerful roles on such shows as \"Law & Order,\" \"Profiler\" and \"Judging Amy\" has kept him strongly in the limelight.\n\nMillennium acting work included solid performances in the films Wild Christmas (2000), Ritual (2000), Blue Hill Avenue (2001), The Extreme Team (2003), Constellation (2005), The Blue Hour (2007),The Way of War (2009), A Day in the Life (2009), Der Butler (2013) and Mr. Malevolent (2018), as well as his interesting role as mysterious book store manager Philby in the lengthy Mystery Woman (2003) series of TV movies (2003-2007). Clarence also made guest appearances on TV programs, \"Cold Case,\" \"Memphis Beat,\" \"Justified\" and \"Empire,\" to name a few.\n\nWed to wife Kelly until his death, Clarence was first married to actress Gloria Foster (1967-1984). The two appeared together in the movie Die lässige Welt (1963). Following their divorce, they remained friendly and, upon her death in 2001, it was he who made the formal announcement.\n\nStocky, genial-looking supporting actor Ned Beatty was once hailed by Daily Variety as the \"busiest actor in Hollywood.\"\n\nNed Thomas Beatty was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Margaret (Fortney) and Charles William Beatty. He grew up fishing and working on farms. His hometown of St. Matthews, Kentucky, is hardly the environment to encourage a career in the entertainment industry, though, so when asked, \"How did you get into show business?\" Beatty responded, \"By hanging out with the wrong crowd.\" That \"crowd\" includes some of the industry's most prominent names, such as John Huston, Steven Spielberg, Robert Altman, Paul Newman, Richard Burton, Charlton Heston, Marlon Brando and Robert Redford.\n\nBeatty garnered praise from both critics and peers as a dedicated actor's actor. He started as a professional performer at age ten, when he earned pocket money singing in gospel quartets and a barber shop. The big city and bright lights did not come easy, though. The first ten years of Beatty's career were spent at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Virginia. He then moved on to the Erie Playhouse in Pennsylvania, the Playhouse Theater in Houston, Texas, and the prestigious Arena Stage Company in Washington, D.C. He was also a member of Shakespeare in Central Park, Louisville, Kentucky. Later, he appeared in the Broadway production of \"The Great White Hope\". At the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, he won rave reviews when he starred in \"The Accidental Death of an Anarchist.\"\n\nIn 1971, Beatty was chosen by director John Boorman for the role of Bobby Trippe in the hit film/backwoods nightmare Beim Sterben ist jeder der Erste (1972). Co-star Burt Reynolds and Beatty struck up a friendship, and Ned was then cast by Burt in several other films together, including Der Tiger hetzt die Meute (1973), Ein Supertyp haut auf die Pauke (1975), and the abysmal Der rasende Gockel (1983). Ned's talents were also noticed by others in Hollywood and he was cast in many key productions of the 1970s turning in stellar performance, including an Academy Award nomination of Best Supporting Actor for his role in Network (1976). Beatty was also marvelous in Nashville (1975), under fire from a crazed sniper in Turm des Schreckens (1975), an undercover FBI man in the action comedy Trans-Amerika-Express (1976), as Lex Luthor's bumbling assistant, Otis, in the blockbuster Superman - Der Film (1978) ... and he returned again with Gene Hackman to play Otis and Lex Luthor again in Superman II: Allein gegen alle (1980).\n\nBeatty continued to remain busy throughout the 1980s with appearances in several big budget television productions including Die Tage von Pompeji (1984). However, the overall caliber of the productions in general did not match up to those he had appeared in during the 1970s. Nonetheless, Beatty still shone in films including The Big Easy - Der große Leichtsinn (1986) and Das vierte Protokoll (1987). Into the 1990s, Beatty's work output swung between a mixture of roles in family orientated productions (Gullivers Reisen (1996), Tom Sawyer und Huckleberry Finn - Die Rückkehr nach Hannibal (1990), etc.) taking advantage of his \"fatherly\" type looks, but he could still accentuate a hard edge, and additionally was cast in Radioland Murders - Wahnsinn auf Sendung (1994) and Im Sumpf des Verbrechens (1995). His many other films include Der Spielgefährte (1982), Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976), Der Ketzer (1979), Touchdown - Sein Ziel ist der Sieg (1993), Spring Forward (1999), Hear my Song - Ein Traum wird wahr (1991) -- for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor -- Bodyswitch - Verhexte Küsse (1992), Spiel des Lebens (1998) and Cookies Fortune - Aufruhr in Holly Springs (1999). Beatty's numerous television credits include three years on the NBC series Homicide (1993), Der letzte Ritt (1995) and The Boys (1993).\n\nBeatty received an Emmy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance in Fürs Vaterland zu sterben (1979) opposite Carol Burnett, and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Family Channel's Last Train Home (1989). Other notable credits include Der Schutzengel (2004), The Execution of Private Slovik (1974), Golda Meir (1982), Pray TV (1982), the miniseries Robert Kennedy and His Times (1985), Lockerbie: A Night Remembered (1998) and T-Bone und Weasel (1992). He also had a recurring role on Roseanne (1988) and performed musically on television specials for Dolly Parton and The Smothers Brothers.\n\nIn 2001, Beatty returned to his theatrical roots starring in London's West End revival production of Tennessee Williams' \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" with Brendan Fraser. He also appeared in the production on Broadway in 2003/2004 with Jason Patric and Ashley Judd. In 2006, Beatty completed three features to be released next year: The Walker (2007); Paul Schrader's film also starring Woody Harrelson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily Tomlin; Paramount Pictures' Shooter (2007) starring Mark Wahlberg; and Der Krieg des Charlie Wilson (2007), Mike Nichols's film with Tom Hanks, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julia Roberts. Also in the 21st century, Beatty turned out a terrific performance in the popular WO DER ROTE FARN WÄCHST (2003). Blessed with eight children, Ned Beatty enjoyed golf and playing the bass guitar. He gave himself until the age of 70 to become proficient at both. He died at age 83 of natural causes on June 13, 2021 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSuzzanne Douglas is an award-winning actress of both screen and stage, whose work has led her through all walks of creative life.

Following 20th Century-Fox monumental success with Shirley Temple in the early 1930s, every studio was out searching for its own precocious little commodity who could pack 'em in the aisles despite the lean times. While Paramount whipped up \"Little\" Mitzi Green, MGM offered Jackie Cooper in the hopes of finding a similar box office jingle. Wildly talented Janie Withers fit the bill, too, and although she earned pint-sized prominence just like the others, it was also for Temple's Fox Studios. As such, Jane remained somewhat of a side course to Temple's main dish (what child star didn't?) throughout much her young \"B\" level reign. Nevertheless, she became a major bright star in her own right.\n\nThe freckled, dark-haired hellraiser was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on April 12, 1926. The daughter of Walter and Lavinia Ruth (Elble) Withers, her parents wasted no time in prodding little Jane quickly into the world of entertainment. Jane was a natural--performing by the time she could walk and talk. By age three, she was taking singing and dancing lessons and at age 4, was starring on her own radio program in Atlanta. A spot-on mimic, she was simply uncanny when it came to impersonating the superstars of her day (W.C. Fields, Marie Dressler, Charles Chaplin) and was a veteran pint-sized performer by the time her family moved to Los Angeles after her father was transferred by his company. Jane was enrolled in Lawlor's Professional School and was soon modeling in shows, entertaining at benefits and making the usual rounds of the studios nabbing extra work while waiting for that one big film break.\n\nShe found it at age 8 when she won the plum role of the spoiled, obnoxious, doll-ripping, bicycle-riding brat who terrorizes sweet Shirley Temple in Twentieth Century-Fox's Bright Eyes (1934). The infamy earned Jane a sweet contract at Fox and for the next seven years she did it her way as the tyke star of close to 50 \"B\" level films. Where Shirley was cuddly and ultra huggable, brunette-banged Jane was fun, rambunctious and full of kinetic energy--a scrappy little tomboy who could take on any boy at any time. Her lively vehicles took full advantage of her talents for impersonating movie stars, too. Her first major success came in the form of the title role in Ginger (1935) in which Jane imitated the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet and was rewarded by the studio with a contract of $125 weekly for six months. Her singing and dancing skills were utilized in such vehicles as This Is the Life (1935) and Paddy O'Day (1936). As the star, she was toned down, of course, from the all-out brat she played against Temple. Jane kept filmgoers entertained throughout the late 1930s with pictures like Pepper (1936) and Angel's Holiday (1937), in which she did an hilarious impression of Martha Raye. She ended 1937 with a bang when she was named one of Motion Picture's Poll's \"Top Ten\" (#6) box office favorites. Guess who was #1?\n\nThe early 1940s would tell the story as to whether Jane could survive the dreaded awkward teen transition that haunted every popular child star. She received her first screen kiss at age 13 in Boy Friend (1939) and was singled out for her work in The Ritz Brothers' Pack Up Your Troubles (1939), but Jane's antics simply didn't play as well and the studio began to lose interest. In fact, both Shirley and Jane felt the pressures of growing up and Darryl F. Zanuck let both of them go in July of 1942. Jane signed a three-year picture deal with Republic Pictures with lukewarm results. Her best dramatic role at that time came with The North Star (1943).\n\nIn 1947, the same year as her last picture of the decade, Jane married a wealthy Texas oil man, William Moss, and had three children by him--William, Wendy, and Randy. The marriage was not a happy one and lasted only six years. She also was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. In 1955, she remarried, this time to Kenneth Errair, one-quarter of the harmonizing group \"The Four Freshmen.\" They had two children, Ken and Kendall Jane. At the same time, she attempted a Hollywood comeback. While studying directing at the USC film school, she met producer/director George Stevens who cast her in an enviable character role in the epic-sized Giganten (1956) supporting Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, and James Dean. Other film roles followed with The Right Approach (1961) and Captain Newman (1963).\n\nIt was TV, however, that would turn Jane into a wealthy woman as a friendly household pitchwoman. Her decades-long job as the dress-downed Josephine the Plumber pushing Comet cleanser made her one popular gal when working in films became a non-issue. From time to time she made guest appearances on such fun, lightweight shows as Die Munsters (1964), Love Boat (1977), Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984), and Hart aber herzlich (1979). Known for her strong spiritualism and charitable contributions, Jane's buoyant, indefatigable nature was still, at age 90+, highly infectious. She not only did voiceover work for Disney's animated features but still popped up here and there for interviews and convention signings--as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as she was in her childhood heyday. A widow in 1968, (her second husband perished in a June 14th plane crash in California), she also lost one of her five children, Randy, to cancer when he was only 33.\n\nBorn Alexander Viespi, Jr. in Floral Park, New York in 1933, handsome, often mustachioed Alex Cord was stricken with polio at the age of 12. Confined to a hospital and iron lung for a long time, he overcame the illness after being sent to a Wyoming ranch for therapy. He soon regained his dream and determination of becoming a jockey or professional horseman.\n\nA high school dropout at the age of sixteen, he grew up to be too tall to be a jockey so he joined the rodeo circuit and earned a living riding bulls and bareback horses. During another extended hospital stay, this time suffering major injuries after being thrown by a bull at a rodeo in New York City's Madison Square Garden, he reevaluated his life's direction and decided to finish his high school education by way of night school. A voracious reader during his long convalescence, he later studied and received his degree in literature at New York University.\n\nProdded by an interest in acting, Alex received dramatic training at the Actors Studio and began his professional career in summer stock (The Compass Players in St. Louis, Missouri) and at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut where he played \"Laertes\" in a production of \"Hamlet\". A British producer saw his promise and invited him to London where he co-starred in four plays (\"Play With a Tiger\", \"The Rose Tattoo\", \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"The Umbrella\"). He was nominated for the \"Best Actor Award\" by the London Critics' Circle for the first-mentioned play.\n\nHe sought a Hollywood \"in\" and found one via his equestrian skills in the early 1960s. Steady work came to him on such established western TV series as Am Fuß der Blauen Berge (1959) and Geächtet (1965) and that extended itself into acting roles on crime action series (Route 66 (1960) and Gnadenlose Stadt (1958)). Gaining a foothold in feature films within a relatively short time, he starred or co-starred in more than 30 feature films, including Die Gierigen (1965), San Fernando (1966), Stiletto (1969) and Auftrag Mord (1968).\n\nAfter his film career declined in the late 1970s he turned to action adventure overseas with the \"spaghetti western\" Mehr tot als lebendig (1967) [A Minute to Pray, A Second to Die] and the British war drama The Last Grenade (1970) with Stanley Baker and Richard Attenborough. Around that time as well, he played the murderer opposite Sam Jaffe's old man in Edgar Allan Poe's dramatic short, The Tell-Tale Heart (1971). It was TV, however, that provided more career stability. Cord has more than 300 credits, including roles in Hotel (1983), Fantasy Island (1977), Simon und Simon (1981), Jake und McCabe - Durch dick und dünn (1987), Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) and Mord ist ihr Hobby (1984). He situated himself in a number of series, notably Airwolf (1984), in which he co-starred with Jan-Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine as the mysterious white-suited, eye-patched, cane-using \"Michael Archangel\".\n\nLater commercial interest was drawn from his title role in Grauadler (1977), a remake of the John Wayne film, Der schwarze Falke (1956), in which he played the Indian kidnapper of Ben Johnson's daughter. Lana Wood, sister of star Natalie Wood (who appeared in the original), also co-starred in this film. Alex can still be seen from time to time in low-budget films and the occasional television appearance, but other interests took up his time. His last film role was in the dismissible thriller Fire from Below (2009) in support of Kevin Sorbo.\n\nAlex's love for horses extended itself into work for numerous charities and benefits. He was a regular competitor in the Ben Johnson Pro-Celebrity Rodeos that raised money for children's charities, and he is one of the founders of the Chukkers for Charity Celebrity Polo Team which has raised more than $3 million for worthy causes. He chairs \"Ahead with Horses\", an organization that provides therapeutic riding programs for the physically and emotionally challenged. Alex also turned to writing, thus far publishing several novels including A Feather in the Rain (2005), Days of the Harbinger (2013), The Man Who Would Be God (2014 and High Moon (2016). He has also sold three screenplays.\n\nThe actor's three marriages all ended in divorce. His second wife was British-born actress Joanna Pettet and third, Susannah, was a horse trainer. He had three children -- Toni Aluisa, Wayne and Damien Zachary. His son by Pettet, Damien, died tragically in 1995 of a heroin overdose at the age of 26."
