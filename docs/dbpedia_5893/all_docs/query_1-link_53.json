        "text": "The only televised awards show dedicated entirely to actors, the SAG Awards 2024 aired Saturday for the first time on Netflix, and made their mark on an awards season that’s just about ready to come to an end. Oppenheimer continued its significant recent winning streak, with victories for lead actor Cillian Murphy and supporting actor Robert Downey Jr. as well as the night’s final award, best film ensemble. Da’Vine Joy Randolph was another repeat winner, seemingly unstoppable for her role in The Holdovers. And Lily Gladstone triumphed in the best actress category, making her a strong contender heading into the Oscars in what’s been an extremely competitive best actress race.\n\nOn the TV side there were a solid number of repeat victories for recent Emmy winners like Steven Yeun, Ali Wong, Ayo Edebiri, and Jeremy Allen White. But there was genuine surprise when Pedro Pascal took home the lead actor in a drama award for The Last of Us — perhaps no one more surprised than Pascal himself. And though he beat a number of actors from Succession, they had their moment onstage for the best drama ensemble award.\n\nBelow find a complete list of SAG Award winners.
