        "text": "No commercials, some f-bombs and plenty of time for acceptance speeches.\n\nThe 30th annual Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards were held Saturday at the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles, and the show streamed live globally on Netflix – a first for the show and the streamer – which freed it up to be different from other award shows (read, no bleeps, as mentioned above, and no ad breaks either).\n\nSaturday night’s winners were familiar to those who have been following awards season, as actors from “The Bear,” “Oppenheimer” and “Beef” took home statuettes as expected. Projected frontrunners like Lily Gladstone from “Killers of the Flower Moon” and Da’Vine Joy Randolph of “The Holdovers” also took home trophies, referred to as “actors” during the telecast.\n\nWhile this year’s ceremony did not feature a host, Idris Elba unofficially fulfilled those duties, both opening and closing the show and appearing at least one other time in the middle, drawing laughs from the crowd.\n\nOther buzzy entertainers who took the stage as presenters included Billie Eilish, Jessica Chastain, America Ferrera, Robert Downey Jr. and SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher, among many others.\n\nJennifer Aniston helped present Barbra Streisand with the SAG Life Achievement award, hailing the legend for “that voice” and calling her “a mensch.” Bradley Cooper also took the stage as part of the tribute.\n\nStreisand noted in her acceptance speech that she has been a member of SAG-AFTRA for more than 60 years, and reminisced about being a teen in Brooklyn dreaming of becoming an actress while reading a movie magazine and eating a “pint of coffee ice cream.” She also mentioned key players of old Hollywood who were Jewish and who fled eastern Europe to escape persecution, saying, “Now I dream of a world where such prejudice is a thing of the past.”\n\nThe first award of the night was a treat for fans of “The Devil Wears Prada,” as the stars of the 2006 film – Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt – reunited to present together. The SAG stage also saw other casts reuniting on Saturday, including those from “Breaking Bad” as well as Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis from 1986’s David Cronenberg film “The Fly,” who presented the final award for the evening.\n\nThe cast of “Succession” led the nominations among the television categories with five – nabbing the top honor for best ensemble. “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” each scored four nominations in the motion picture categories, including earning recognition in the coveted ensemble cast category. “Oppenheimer” reigned victorious with three of those awards, while “Barbie” was shut out.\n\nThis is the first SAG Awards since last year’s prolonged actors’ strike in Hollywood – a fact that was brought up several times throughout the evening – and is also the last major entertainment awards event before next month’s Oscars ceremony.\n\nFind below the categories and nominees, with winners denoted in bold:\n\nMOTION PICTURE CATEGORIES\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role\n\nBradley Cooper, “Maestro”\n\nColman Domingo, “Rustin”\n\nPaul Giamatti, “The Holdovers”\n\nCillian Murphy, “Oppenheimer” *WINNER\n\nJeffrey Wright, “American Fiction”\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role\n\nAnnette Bening, “Nyad”\n\nLily Gladstone, “Killers of the Flower Moon” *WINNER\n\nCarey Mulligan, “Maestro”\n\nMargot Robbie, “Barbie”\n\nEmma Stone, “Poor Things”\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nSterling K.
