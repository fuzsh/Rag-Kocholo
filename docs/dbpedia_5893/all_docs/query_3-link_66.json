This is down in no small part to the extraordinary commitment and passion of theatres and theatre companies right across the UK.

It is easy to forget that there were precedents to our current age of BAME breakthroughs, and by talking to the likes of Roy Williams and Mustapha Matura we acknowledge that the young reach their current heights by standing on the shoulders of those that went before.”\n\nOn BBC One across the regions, eleven documentaries will capture the challenges facing theatres across England.

The story in both the book and the play is told by a 15 year-old boy who finds other people frightening and confusing, and it has helped transform our understanding of a neurological condition that affects one in 100 children.

His gregarious personality and philanthropic largesse have endeared him to some of the world’s most celebrated stars.\n\nRonald Harwood’s The Dresser\n\n31 October TBC, BBC Two\n\nOne of the greatest portraits of life in the theatre, Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser has been adapted for television. The production brings Ian McKellen and Anthony Hopkins together on screen for the first time. Reverting to Harwood’s original text, adapted for television and directed by Richard Eyre, the play tells the story of one fateful night in a small regional theatre during World War Two as a troupe of touring actors stage a production of Shakespeare’s King Lear. Bombs are falling, the sirens are wailing, the curtain is up in an hour but the actor/manager Sir (Hopkins) who is playing Lear is nowhere to be seen. His dresser Norman (McKellen) must scramble to keep the production alive, but will Sir turn up in time and if he does, will he be able to perform that night? The Dresser is a wickedly funny and deeply moving story of friendship and loyalty as Sir reflects on his lifelong accomplishments and seeks to reconcile his turbulent friendships with those in his employ before the final curtain.\n\nArtsnight special curated by Josie Rourke - Does Art Mirror Life?\n\n20 November TBC, BBC Two\n\nJosie Rourke, artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, delves into the complicated relationship between art and representation by asking the question: does art mirror life?

Hare, one of Britain’s foremost political playwrights, made his name in the 1960s and rose to fame in the 1970s with Plenty, his play about post-war disillusion. He then went on to write a string of successes for The National Theatre, most notably his trilogy, of plays Racing Demon, Murmuring Judges and The Absence Of War, which critiqued Britain’s public institutions.\n\nHare has also written extensively for film and television, including The Reader, The Hours and Licking Hitler.

In Ashes To Ashes from 1996, a troubling conversation between a wife and her husband about the past merges into the violence of unnamed political barbarity. A Kind of Alaska from 1982 tells the story of a woman emerging from 'sleeping sickness' and was written by Pinter after reading the book Awakenings by neurologist Oliver Sacks, who died in August of this year. Harriet Walter takes the role played by Judi Dench in the original production.\n\nDinner, by Moira Buffini\n\nSunday 22 November 2100-2230 TBC, Radio 3\n\nHarriet Walter reprises her role as a Paige, a sharp-tongued hostess in this West End black comedy about an evening party. On the surprise menu to celebrate the publication of her husband’s new book, she lists Primordial Soup, Apocalypse of Lobster - and for dessert, Frozen Waste. It soon becomes a darkly comic dinner party from hell.\n\nA Human Being Died That Night, by Nicholas Wright\n\nSunday 29 November 2100-2230 TBC, Radio 3\n\nIn Pretoria Central Prison, South Africa, a black psychologist prepares to sit opposite the apartheid regime's most notorious assassin: Eugene de Kock, nicknamed Prime Evil. She is a member of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and is interviewing de Kock while he serves 212 years for crimes against humanity, murder, conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, illegal possession of firearms, and fraud. How did he become one of the most reviled figures in apartheid history? A Human Being Died That Night is based on the best-selling book by Pumla Gobodo-Madikizela and explores her extraordinary interviews with Eugene de Kock - and how a fundamentally moral person could become a mass murderer.\n\nThe original cast of the stage production bring this play to Radio 3 at Harriet Walter’s request. Since the play was recorded for Radio 3 Eugene de Kock has himself - controversially - been released on parole.\n\nSunday Feature: Making an Entrance – Asian Theatre in Britain\n\nSunday 22 November 1845-1930 TBC, Radio 3\n\nSarfraz Manzoor charts the history of Asian theatre in Britain, a tale which ranges from The Bayaderes, 'Priestesses of Pondicherry' - temple dancers who came to London from India in the 1830s, through to the current generation of actors, directors and writers.\n\nSarfraz examines how political and social unrest in the 1970s sparked the founding of the first high-profile Asian theatre company in Britain, and looks at how the 21st century has seen an increasingly wide range of work – from controversial plays and new, sometimes radical versions of classic texts to Bollywood-inspired musicals. With contributors including Hanif Kureishi, Tanika Gupta, Ayub Khan-Din, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, Jatinder Verma and Sudha Bhuchar.\n\nRadio 4\n\nRaising the Bar – 100 Years of Black British Theatre and Screen\n\nMonday 9 November – Friday 20 November TBC\n\nMonday-Friday, 13:45-14:00 (10 part series)\n\nRadio 4\n\nLenny Henry tells the story of black British theatre and screen through ten landmark works and events. In 1833 Ira Aldridge, the first professional and successful black actor in Britain (American by birth, he settled here and toured across the whole of Europe) performed Othello at Covent Garden. The press was outraged and after only two performances Aldridge was forced to leave the London mainstream theatre. A century later, playing Desdemona opposite the legendary Paul Robeson’s Othello, Peggy Ashcroft was asked by the press if she minded kissing him.\n\nIn the eight decades since then, black writers and performers have become a major presence on Britain’s stages, screens and TV. In a narrative history built round ten canonical works, creative artists and events, Lenny Henry tells the exuberant story of this transformation, weaving themes of roots, racism, colonialism, slavery, black consciousness, gender, sexuality, criminality - and not an inconsiderable dose of laughter - with the major markers of the period’s black history, riots, sus laws and legal injustices.\n\nBy the early days of this century, black theatre had moved from the territory of the subsidised theatre and ambitious but confident black theatre companies into the West End mainstream, which is where the series begins. It was a very long journey from the uncomfortable experiences of the 1930s and the racism of the early 1950s, when so many of the Empire Windrush generation arrived in the UK from the Caribbean.\n\nThe series will have theatre - playwrights, texts and performers - at its heart; but screenwriting, for both film and TV audience, was for many more recent performers and writers their point of realisation that a career in stage and screen drama was a realistic possibility. Featuring interviews with Mustapha Matura, Kwame Kwei-Armah, Steve McQueen, Winsome Pinnock, Yvonne Brewster, Paulette Randall, Roy Williams, Bola Agbaje, Lolita Chakrabarti, Isaac Julien, Michael Buffong, Alby James and Stephen Bourne amongst others.\n\nOnline\n\nVicky Featherstone curates BBC Arts Online\n\nRoyal Court Theatre artistic director Vicky Featherstone will curate BBC Arts Online for a week, focussing on British theatre’s response to the refugee and migrant crisis including a look at Good Chance, a creative space in the refugee camp in Calais.\n\nRSC’s Volpone\n\nBBC Arts Online\n\nWe’ll capture Trevor Nunn’s brilliant adaptation from Stratford as co-commissioned by The Space.\n\niWonder\n\nBBC iWonder will be publishing two guides as part of the season: one celebrating the qualities our great British actors bring to the stage, and the other a timeline of our rich theatrical culture. Included in these guides will be performance clips from our most treasured theatrical actors and audiences will be invited to vote for their favourite theatre actor from our shortlist. Look out for them on the 31 October and 8 November 2015.\n\nBBC Get Creative\n\nOn Saturday 21 November the public will be invited behind the scenes of theatres around the country to experience the magic of the stage.
