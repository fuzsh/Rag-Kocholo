        "text": "Oppenheimer and TV’s The Bear were the big winners at the 30th Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards on Saturday (February 24), which streamed live on Netflix in a first for the platform.\n\nOppenheimer won best cast as lead male actor winner and Oscar favourite Cillian Murphy and his ‘Oppenhomies’ filled the stage at Los Angeles’ Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall at the climax of the show, setting up Universal’s blockbuster for a potentially huge weekend ahead of Sunday’s PGA Awards. The Oscars follow on March 10.\n\nLily Gladstone became the first Indigenous performer to win a SAG Award for lead female actor for Apple Original Films’ Killers Of The Flower Moon, beating her ongoing main awards season rival Emma Stone. It is a strong endorsement from the actors guild, although the sense is this contest may not be over.\n\nFar more of a foregone conclusion at the Academy Awards is supporting female, which went to the season’s one sure thing, Da’Vine Joy Randolph for The Holdovers. Robert Downey Jr. is looking increasingly like an Oscar lock for Oppenheimer, and won supporting male on Saturday,\n\nSAG Awards are strong indicators of Oscars glory. The actors bloc within the Academy is comprised of Guild members and Saturday’s awards come as Academy members are in the middle of final Oscars voting, which runs through February 27.\n\nIndividual SAG winners tend to be highly reliable bellwethers of Academy Awards success. Last year’s SAG winners Michelle Yeoh, Brendan Fraser, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ke Huy Quan all went on to win Oscars.\n\nThe SAG cast award can augur success in the best picture Oscar category, too. In the last two years Everything Everywhere All At Once and CODA both translated SAG triumphs into best picture Oscars.\n\nOppenheimer started the night on four nominations including Murphy, Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and cast; while Barbie earned four for Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, cast, and stunt ensemble. It went home empty-handed after Paramount’s Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One won best feature stunt ensemble.\n\nHBO’s Succession once again led the television nominations with five nods for Brian Cox, Golden Globe winners Kieran Culkin, Matthew Macfadyen, and Sarah Snook, and cast.\n\nThe show won the best dramatic cast award but the male actor contenders lost out to The Last Of Us star Pedro Pascal, who sliced through the category and brushed aside Cox, Culkin, and Macfayden, not to mention Billy Crudup ofThe Morning Show.\n\nSuccession’s other Globe winner, Sarah Snook, lost out in the female actor category to Elizabeth Debicki for The Crown, who had won the Globe in the supporting category.\n\nIn the comedy categories, the night belonged to FX’s The Bear, which took best show and acting honours for Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Adebiri.\n\nSAF-AFTRA president Fran Drescher addressed the audience towards the end of the show and hailed the ”billion dollar contract” won at the end of last year’s contract negotiations, warned of the dangers of AI, and applauded members for last year’s “hot labour summer”, promising members they were entering “the Golden Age”.\n\nBarbra Streisand earned a standing ovation as she received the lifetime achievement award.\n\nBritish star Idris Elba was among the presenters in the hostless show and dropped an F-bomb. That’s live TV, folks.\n\nWinners appear below in bold.\n\nSAG Awards 2024 nominations\n\nFILM\n\nOutstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture\n\nAmerican fiction\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nThe Killers Of The Flower Moon\n\nOppenheimer\n\nOutstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role\n\nBradley Cooper, Maestro\n\nColman Domingo, Rustin\n\nPaul Giamatti, The Holdovers\n\nCillian Murphy, Oppenheimer\n\nJeffrey Wright, American Fiction\n\nOutstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role\n\nAnnette Bening, Nyad\n\nLily Gladstone, Killers Of The Flower Moon\n\nCarey Mulligan, Maestro\n\nMargot Robbie, Barbie\n\nEmma Stone, Poor Things\n\nOutstanding Performance by a male actor in a supporting role\n\nSterling K Brown, American Fiction\n\nWillem Dafoe, Poor Things\n\nRobert De Niro, Killers Of The Flower Moon\n\nRobert Downey Jr, Oppenheimer\n\nRyan Gosling, Barbie\n\nOutstanding Performance by a female actor in a supporting role\n\nEmily Blunt, Oppenheimer\n\nDanielle Brooks, The Color Purple\n\nPenelope Cruz, Ferrari\n\nJodie Foster, Nyad\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph, The Holdovers\n\nOutstanding action performance by a stunt ensemble in a motion picture\n\nBarbie\n\nGuardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3\n\nIndiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny\n\nJohn Wick Chapter 4\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nTELEVISION\n\nOutstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series\n\nThe Crown\n\nThe Gilded Age\n\nThe Last Of Us\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nSuccession\n\nOutstanding performance by an ensemble in a comedy series\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nBarry\n\nThe Bear\n\nOnly Murders\n\nTed Lasso\n\nOutstanding performance by a male actor in a drama series\n\nBrian Cox, Succession\n\nBilly Crudup, The Morning Show\n\nKieran Culkin, Succession\n\nMatthew Macfayden, Succession\n\nPedro Pascal, The Last Of Us\n\nOutstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series\n\nJennifer Aniston, The Morning Show\n\nElizabeth Debicki, The Crown\n\nBella Ramsey, The Last Of US\n\nKeri Russell, The Diplomat\n\nSarah Snook, Succession\n\nOutstanding performance by a male actor in a comedy series\n\nBrett Goldstein, Ted Lasso\n\nBill Hader, Barry\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach, The Bear\n\nJason Sudeikis, Ted Lasso\n\nJeremy Allen White, The Bear\n\nOutstanding performance by a female actor in a comedy series\n\nAlex Borstein, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nRachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nQuinta Brunson, Abbott Elementary\n\nAyo Adebiri, The Bear\n\nHannah Waddingham, Ted Lasso\n\nOutstanding performance by a male actor in a television movie or limited series\n\nMatt Bomer, Fellow Travelers\n\nJon Hamm, Fargo\n\nDavid Oyelowo, Lawmen: Bass Reeves\n\nTony Shalhoub, Mr. Monk’s Last Case: A Monk Movie\n\nSteven Yeun, Beef\n\nOutstanding performance by a female actor in a miniseries or television movie\n\nUzo Aduba, Painkiller\n\nKathryn Hahn, Tiny Beautiful Things\n\nBrie Larson Lessons In Chemistry\n\nBel Powley, A Small Light\n\nAli Wong, Beef\n\nOutstanding action performance by a stunt ensemble in a television series"
