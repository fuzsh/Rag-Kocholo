        "text": "Awards season continues apace Sunday, January 19, as nominees from both the silver and TV screens gather at Los Angeles’ Shrine Auditorium for this year’s Screen Actors Guild Awards, which premiered at 8:00pm EST and 5:00pm PST.\n\nThe evening’s awards began with the usual suspects, with Phoebe Waller-Bridge taking home Outstanding Female Actor in a Comedy Series for Fleabag, and Tony Shalhoub winning Outstanding Male Actor in a Comedy Series for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. Despite their protests to the contrary (even they voted for Fleabag!), the cast of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel also took home Outstanding Comedy Ensemble.\n\nOver in the film categories, Joaquin Phoenix took home Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role for his turn in Joker, while Renée Zellweger won Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role for Judy. To close out the evening, Parasite stars Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Choi Woo-shik, Lee Jung-eun and Song Kang-ho took the stage to accept their award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the first foreign language film cast to do so, while their director Bong Joon-ho excitedly looked on and (fittingly) filmed them.\n\nAnd that’s not even getting into the fact both Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston won SAG Awards tonight!
