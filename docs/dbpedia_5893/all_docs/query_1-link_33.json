        "text": "Christopher Nolan’s historical epic ‘Oppenheimer’ picks up three major awards, while ‘The Bear’ and ‘Succession’ share big TV wins.\n\nAfter a challenging year of strikes, the Screen Actors Guild gathered in Hollywood on Saturday, 24th February, to celebrate the outstanding performances from the last 12 months. For the first time ever this year, the SAG Awards were streamed live via Netflix worldwide, giving the Guild and their awards a brand new platform and a chance for everyone to witness the excitement and fashions of the night.\n\nOne of the many elements of the SAG awards that make it stand out in the awards calendar is its entire dedication to the craft of performance. But, as well as the exciting awards and the recognition of performances from the past year, the SAG awards bring groups of actors back together in reunions to present the awards.\n\nThis year saw a number of iconic reunions, including Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway from The Devil Wears Prada, Sean Astin and Elijah Wood from The Lord of the Rings and the whole cast of Breaking Bad.\n\nThis year’s SAG Lifetime Achievement award went to the one and only Barbra Streisand, who was presented her award by colleagues and close friends Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Anniston. At the helm of the night was Spotlight member Idris Elba, who opened and closed the show in an exceedingly cool manner – while keeping the show moving at an entertaining pace. It was a fun, exciting ceremony with the winners thanking their peers and the support of their fellow SAG members over the past year. Leading the winners with three wins were The Bear for television and Oppenheimer for film, both winning in their respective fields for Best Ensemble Cast.\n\nThe full list of winners for the 2024 SAG Awards are…\n\nTelevision:\n\nOutstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Television Series\n\nThe Last of Us (WINNER)\n\nBarry\n\nBeef\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series\n\nAli Wong – Beef (WINNER)\n\nUzo Aduba – Painkiller\n\nKathryn Hahn – Tiny Beautiful Things\n\nBrie Larson – Lessons in Chemistry\n\nBel Powley – A Small Light\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series\n\nSteven Yeun – Beef (WINNER)\n\nMatt Bomer – Fellow Travelers\n\nJon Hamm – Fargo\n\nDavid Oyelowo – Lawmen: Bass Reeves\n\nTony Shalhoub – Mr. Monk’s Last Case: A Monk Movie\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nAyo Edebiri – The Bear (WINNER)\n\nAlex Borstein – The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel\n\nRachel Brosnahan – The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel\n\nQuinta Brunson – Abbott Elementary\n\nHannah Waddingham – Ted Lasso\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nJeremy Allen White – The Bear (WINNER)\n\nBrett Goldstein – Ted Lasso\n\nBill Hader – Barry\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach – The Bear\n\nJason Sudeikis – Ted Lasso\n\nOutstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\n\nThe Bear (WINNER)\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nBarry\n\nOnly Murders in the Building\n\nTed Lasso\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series\n\nPedro Pascal – The Last of Us (WINNER)\n\nBrian Cox – Succession\n\nBilly Crudup – The Morning Show\n\nKieran Culkin – Succession\n\nMatthew MacFadyen – Succession\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series\n\nElizabeth Debicki – The Crown (WINNER)\n\nJennifer Aniston – The Morning Show\n\nBella Ramsey – The Last of Us\n\nKeri Russell – The Diplomat\n\nSarah Snook – Succession\n\nOutstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series\n\nSuccession (WINNER)\n\nThe Crown\n\nThe Gilded Age\n\nThe Last of Us\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nFilm:\n\nOutstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One (WINNER)\n\nBarbie\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy volume 3\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 4\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nDa’vine Joy Randolph – The Holdovers (WINNER)\n\nEmily Blunt – Oppenheimer\n\nDanielle Brooks – The Color Purple\n\nPenélope Cruz – Ferrari\n\nJodie Foster – NYAD\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nRobert Downey Jr. – Oppenheimer (WINNER)\n\nSterling K.
