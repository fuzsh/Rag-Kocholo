        "text": "Sir Antony Sher has died following a battle with cancer, the Royal Shakespeare Company have confirmed.\n\nThe actor, who was 72, was widely regarded as one of the UK’s best contemporary classical actors.\n\nThe RSC said in a statement: ‘We are deeply saddened by this news and our thoughts and sincere condolences are with Greg [Doran, his husband], and with Antony’s family and their friends at this devastating time.\n\n‘Antony had a long association with the RSC and a hugely celebrated career on stage and screen.\n\n‘Antony’s last production with the Company was in the two-hander Kunene and The King, written by his friend and fellow South African actor, writer and activist, John Kani.’\n\nIt added: ‘Antony was deeply loved and hugely admired by so many colleagues. He was a ground-breaking role model for many young actors, and it is impossible to comprehend that he is no longer with us.\n\n‘We will ensure friends far and wide have the chance to share tributes and memories in the days to come.’\n\nSher’s husband, Gregory Doran, who is artistic director of the RSC, had taken compassionate leave to care for the actor.\n\nAs well as his stage work, Sher had also appeared in films including Shakespeare in Love and Mrs Brown, as well as TV series including The History Man and Murphy’s Law.\n\nHe had joined the RSC in 1982, winning an Olivier Award in 1985 for Richard III, later becoming an honorary associate artist with the company.\n\nSher was knighted in 2000, and in 2005 became one of the first gay couples to enter into a civil partnership in the UK with husband Doran.\n\nDoran said earlier this year: ‘I am very sorry to say that my husband, Tony Sher, has been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and in order to look after him, and with the agreement of the Board, I will be taking a period of compassionate leave with immediate effect. I expect to return in early 2022.’\n\nGot a story?"
