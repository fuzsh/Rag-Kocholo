        "text": "The 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were held at the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles on February 24, and for the very first time streamed live on Netflix. The ceremony had no host, which meant Nick and Vanessa Lachey were saved from struggling through another Netflix live show, and instead Idris Elba hijacked the show. In addition to that ill-fated Love Is Blind reunion, Netflix also streamed live broadcasts of a Chris Rock comedy special and a celebrity golf tournament last year, so it was a little bold of them to think they could get through the show with no issues or lags. (And for the most part, minus one pesky teleprompter, they did.)\n\nThis year, Oppenheimer and Barbie led with the most nominations, each earning four, and Barbra Streisand received the Lifetime Achievement Award, presented to her by fellow funny girl Jennifer Aniston and surprise guest Bradley Cooper. Among the show’s all-star presenters, viewers witnessed a groundbreaking Devil Wears Prada reunion with Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Emily Blunt.\n\nHere’s the full list of this year’s winners.\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Color Purple\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nOppenheimer\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role\n\nAnnette Bening (Nyad)\n\nLily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon)\n\nCarey Mulligan (Maestro)\n\nMargot Robbie (Barbie)\n\nEmma Stone (Poor Things)\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role\n\nBradley Cooper (Maestro)\n\nColman Domingo (Rustin)\n\nPaul Giamatti (The Holdovers)\n\nCillian Murphy (Oppenheimer)\n\nJeffrey Wright (American Fiction)\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nEmily Blunt (Oppenheimer)\n\nDanielle Brooks (The Color Purple)\n\nPenélope Cruz (Ferrari)\n\nJodie Foster (Nyad)\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph (The Holdovers)\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nSterling K.
