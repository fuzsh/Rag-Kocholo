        "text": "Othello\n\nGuidance 12+ • 3h 41s\n\nJealousy prevails in William Shakespeare’s classic tragedy; the ‘green-eyed monster’ slowly consumes Othello (Eamonn Walker) at the encouragement of the bitter Iago (Tim McInnerny). Captured live at Shakespeare’s Globe, this 2007 production marks the theatre’s first staging of Othello.\n\nShe Stoops to Conquer\n\nAll Ages • 2h 18m\n\nOliver Goldsmith’s classic satire of high society sends a pair of suitors into chaos at the hands of prankster Tony Lumpkin. Captured live at the Theatre Royal Bath, this National Theatre and Stockroom (formerly Out of Joint) co-production stars Monica Dolan as Kate Hardcastle and Jason Watkins as Diggory.\n\nThe Mysteries\n\nGuidance 16+ • 2h 28s\n\nThis South African adaptation of the Chester Mystery Plays brings to life well known biblical figures in both testaments, from the creation of Adam and Eve to the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Captured live at Wilton’s Music Hall in 2001, this production is performed in multiple languages* and includes energetic vocal music and dance numbers to create an uplifting retelling of traditional Christian tales. *Please note: English translations can be accessed using the closed caption settings.\n\nThings I Know To Be True\n\nGuidance 12+ • 1h 58m\n\nAndrew Bovell’s Things I Know To Be True is brought to life in this moving and visceral piece of contemporary theatre, featuring Frantic Assembly’s celebrated physicality. Things I Know To Be True is co-produced by Frantic Assembly and State Theatre Company South Australia with Warwick Arts Centre, and in association with Chichester Festival Theatre and the Lyric Hammersmith. This production is only available outside of school term times.\n\nKinky Boots\n\nGuidance 12+ • 2h 1m\n\nWinner of six Tony awards and featuring hit songs by Cyndi Lauper, this huge-hearted musical by Harvey Fierstein follows an unlikely pair who learn to embrace their differences. Factory owner Charlie is struggling to save his family business, and Lola is an entertainer with a wildly big idea. As they work to rescue the factory, they discover that when you change your mind, you can change the world. Captured live at the Adelphi Theatre in 2018.\n\n1939\n\nGuidance All Ages • 2h 4m\n\nCo-written by Jani Lauzon and Kaitlyn Riordan, 1939 follows a group of Indigenous students in Canada staging a performance of Shakespeare’s All’s Well That Ends Well for the visit of King George VI. When they find parallels between themselves and the characters in the play, far from letting themselves be defined by colonial expectations, they set out to make Shakespeare’s bitter-sweet comedy defiantly their own. Captured live at Stratford Festival, 2022.\n\nHenry VIII\n\nGuidance All Ages • 2h 15m\n\nStratford Festival presents Shakespeare’s Henry VIII, a searing drama about one of England’s most romantic yet brutal periods. When King Henry falls for Anne Boleyn, he must somehow divorce Queen Katherine. The consequences will be momentous for the country – and disastrous for the king’s adviser, Cardinal Wolsey, who is losing his grip on power. Captured live at Stratford Festival’s Studio Theatre in 2019.\n\nOthello\n\nGuidance 15+ • 2h 40m\n\nRumours feed irrational jealousy in Shakespeare’s gripping psychological drama, filmed at the Stratford Festival in 2019. Othello and Desdemona defy racial prejudice by marrying, but deadly malice lurks where they least expect it. Nigel Shawn Williams’ contemporary adaptation exposes the racism and misogyny at the heart of this tragic tale.\n\nDeath and the King's Horseman\n\nGuidance 13+ • 2h 33m\n\nWritten by Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka and inspired by a true story, this masterpiece celebrates a community striving to uphold its culture in the face of colonial power. In British-occupied Nigeria, a Yoruba king, the Alafin, has died, and it is the duty of his horseman, Elesin, to accompany him into the afterlife. Elesin proudly anticipates his transition to the next world – but the sacred ritual is interrupted, resulting in unforeseen tragedy. Captured live at Stratford Festival, 2022.\n\nServing Elizabeth\n\nAll Ages • 1h 46m\n\nIn this ingenious contemporary drama, two parallel narratives seem only coincidentally connected, until a surprising twist reveals a deeper relationship between the two. Weaving between 1950s Kenya and the impending visit of Princess Elizabeth, and London, England in 2015, where a young Kenyan-born Canadian is interning on a TV series about the royal family, this production explores issues of colonialism, nationalism and the question of who gets to have a voice. Captured live at Stratford Festival, Ontario in 2021."
