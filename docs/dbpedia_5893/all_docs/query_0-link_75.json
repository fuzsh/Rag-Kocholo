        "text": "What a long, strange trip it’s been, through date changes and delays, virtual film festivals and new eligibility rules and pervasive uncertainty. Yet here we are, on the precipice of the Academy Awards at long last—meaning it’s finally time to make our 2021 Oscar predictions, to gaze into our crystal balls and try to divine how the least predictable Oscar season in recent memory may finally wrap up. The upshot: We predict a spread-the-wealth approach that will see Nomadland, Promising Young Woman, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, and Minari walking away with major awards.\n\nWant the long version? See below for Vanity Fair’s full Oscar predictions 2021, and don’t forget to fill out your own interactive ballot here before the show on Sunday. The Oscars, produced by Steven Soderbergh, Stacey Sher, and Jesse Collins, air April 25 on ABC at 8 p.m. Eastern.\n\nBelow, listen to the Little Gold Men team make their own predictions.\n\nBest Picture\n\nThe Father\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nMank\n\nMinari\n\nWINNER: Nomadland\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nSound of Metal\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nHaving picked up pretty much every precursor award, while dodging controversy, Nomadland is the absolute front-runner here. It will likely end its winning streak on a high note on Sunday night, concluding a story begun on the Lido in Venice and carrying on to a virtual Toronto, lots of drive-in screenings, and a run on Hulu. The Trial of the Chicago 7, which won the ensemble prize at the SAG Awards (where Nomadland was not nominated), has probably the best chance of spoiling—though we are of late hearing a quiet drumbeat for Promising Young Woman. A win for either of those alternates would be a big upset, one that doesn’t feel all that likely after a Nomadland-dominated season. Best picture is all about the preferential ballot now, and Nomadland will likely get not only lots of first-place votes, but many crucial second-place ones too. —Richard Lawson\n\nBest Actress\n\nViola Davis, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nAndra Day, The United States vs. Billie Holiday\n\nVanessa Kirby, Pieces of a Woman\n\nWINNER: Frances McDormand, Nomadland\n\nCarey Mulligan, Promising Young Woman\n\nThe category might be the year’s most thrilling toss-up, as there is no clear winner and no filler nominee. Carey Mulligan claimed the Critics Choice Award, Andra Day nabbed the Golden Globe, Viola Davis snagged the SAG, and Frances McDormand was crowned by BAFTA. The most exciting win would be Mulligan, given that Promising Young Women is the kind of edgy feature that is usually knocked out of major award discussions by more traditional drama fare. But McDormand will likely add a third Oscar to her collection, given her performance, admirable commitment to living life on the road, and her work packaging the project—even recruiting Nomadland director Chloé Zhao herself. —Julie Miller\n\nBest Actor\n\nRiz Ahmed, Sound of Metal\n\nWINNER: Chadwick Boseman, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nAnthony Hopkins, The Father\n\nGary Oldman, Mank\n\nSteven Yeun, Minari\n\nThis one belongs to Chadwick Boseman. The late actor, who died last August of colon cancer, turned in the performance of his career as Levee, a talented but tormented cornet player who roves from monologue to monologue and slowly watches his dreams fade away over the course of the George C. Wolfe–helmed film. Though some pundits still think Anthony Hopkins might pull off a surprise win, all signs—including a slew of key wins over the course of awards season—point to a posthumous statuette for Boseman. —Yohana Desta\n\nBest Director\n\nLee Isaac Chung, Minari\n\nEmerald Fennell, Promising Young Woman\n\nDavid Fincher, Mank\n\nWINNER: Chloé Zhao, Nomadland\n\nThomas Vinterberg, Another Round\n\nFor all the last-minute efforts to predict a shake-up in the best-picture race, nobody has really had a doubt that this prize will go to Zhao—who’s already won the Directors Guild Award, the Golden Globe, and a whole raft of critics’ prizes. Zhao’s win would make history, making her the first woman of color—and only the second woman, ever—to win in this category. The appeal of the historic first might be enough to clinch her victory, but it’s also impossible to deny the directorial accomplishment of Nomadland, which coaxes wonderful performances from nonactors and fuses documentary-style filmmaking with expansive vistas that would make John Ford weep. —Katey Rich\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nMaria Bakalova, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nGlenn Close, Hillbilly Elegy\n\nOlivia Colman, The Father\n\nAmanda Seyfried, Mank\n\nWINNER: Yuh-Jung Youn, Minari\n\nFor months this felt like the wildest category at this year’s race, with a more limited group of potential nominees than the other acting races, and one would-be heavyweight (Glenn Close) with the apparent advantage—even though she’s in a movie that was widely loathed. Then Yuh-Jung Youn, a veteran actor in South Korea, won the SAG Award and gave a delightful speech through her visible surprise—and a narrative, at long last, emerged. Youn went on to win the BAFTA too, with yet another great speech, and it was impossible to imagine any Oscar voter who loved Minari not wanting to reward it with an award for the actor who is, in many ways, the heart of the film. We’re not going to say it’s locked up—after all, Olivia Colman has shocked the world before when nominated opposite Glenn Close—but Youn will go into the night as a prohibitive favorite. —K.R.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nSacha Baron Cohen, The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nWINNER: Daniel Kaluuya, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nLeslie Odom Jr., One Night in Miami…\n\nPaul Raci, Sound of Metal\n\nLaKeith Stanfield, Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nComing off of his Golden Globe win earlier this year, the clear front-runner and odds-on favorite to win the whole thing for his incendiary performance in Judas and the Black Messiah was Daniel Kaluuya. He has since won the BAFTA and the SAG awards, further cementing his 2021 Oscar gold narrative. There’s only one thing standing between Kaluuya and certain victory: his Judas and the Black Messiah costar LaKeith Stanfield. He was also nominated in this category, leaving many at home wondering who, exactly, is meant to be the lead in this film if both of its titular characters are up for supporting actor. If Kaluuya and Stanfield were to split the vote, then Kaluuya’s fellow Golden Globe winner, Sacha Baron Cohen, could swoop in and snatch up the prize. The odds for an upset here are unlikely, but never zero. — Joanna Robinson\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nMinari\n\nWINNER: Promising Young Woman\n\nSound of Metal\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nIn recent years, this category has been dominated by bold, zeitgeist-grabbing films like Parasite and Get Out (and, uh, Green Book). While several of the screenplays on this list could lay claim to that mantle, none fits the bill quite so well as former Killing Eve showrunner and The Crown star Emerald Fennell’s Promising Young Woman, a twisted, #MeToo-inspired revenge tale that goes down like a poisoned lollipop. Fennell’s film got five Oscar nods total, but seems likely to be edged out in every other category—which is all the more reason to bet on Woman here, particularly after Fennell’s screenplay victories at the BAFTAs and Writers Guild Awards. The only real question is whether she’ll be welcomed to the podium to the strains of that creepy “Toxic” cover, or Paris Hilton’s eternal bop “Stars Are Blind.” —Hillary Busis\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nBorat Subsequent Moviefilm\n\nWINNER*: The Father*\n\nNomadland\n\nOne Night in Miami…\n\nThe White Tiger\n\nIf there’s a vulnerability in the juggernaut that is Nomadland, it’s this category. The Father director Florian Zeller’s adaptation of his own beloved play, written with Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons), takes the viewer inside the mind of an aging man whose grip on reality is slipping away. It’s a powerful, emotional journey, leaving the audience at times as disoriented and fearful as the main character. Academy voters have been deeply affected by it. Nomadland had a similar impact, and could continue a winning streak here—but if voters decide to share the love, The Father is one that also captured their hearts. —Anthony Breznican\n\nBest International Feature\n\nWINNER: Another Round (Denmark)\n\nBetter Days (Hong Kong)\n\nCollective (Romania)\n\nThe Man Who Sold His Skin (Tunisia)\n\nQuo Vadis, Aida? (Bosnia and Herzegovina)\n\nA toast is in order for Another Round, the boozy Danish dramedy starring Mads Mikkelsen. The film is currently the front-runner in this category (with Quo Vadis, Aida? nipping at its heels), beloved both in its native Denmark and overseas for its spirited subject matter: a group of friends experimenting with controlled drunkenness at work. Director Thomas Vinterberg made the film in honor of his 19-year-old daughter, Ida, who was cast in the film but died in a tragic car accident four days into shooting. Another Round’s message of embracing life in all its pain and chaos is impossible to extricate from this backstory, imbuing the film with a sense of urgency. Though Vinterberg has tried to avoid turning his daughter’s death into a press narrative, he has spoken openly about how nice it is to see people embrace the story she inspired: “I feel that every award this movie is being given is honoring her memory,” he told Vanity Fair. “It doesn’t feel wrong or weird; it feels like it’s for her.” How could the Academy resist both awarding this excellent film and bringing Vinterberg’s journey full circle? —Y.D.\n\nBest Documentary Feature\n\nCollective\n\nCrip Camp\n\nThe Mole Agent\n\nWINNER: My Octopus Teacher\n\nTime\n\nDiver and filmmaker Craig Foster’s gorgeously shot footage of the friendship he forged in a kelp forest with a playful octopus is the shoo-in here. It’s not only colorful, funny, and heartfelt, but it has a meaningful theme—the brevity of life on earth, and the beauty of sharing it in harmony with other living things. Crip Camp, the uplifting and brazen story of a summer camp for kids with disabilities, could make a surprise comeback here, but it’s going to be difficult to pry the trophy from My Octopus Teacher’s tentacles. —A.B.\n\nBest Editing\n\nThe Father\n\nNomadland\n\nPromising Young Woman\n\nSound of Metal\n\nWINNER: The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nOnce upon a time, best film editing was known as the category to watch for hints about which film would eventually win best picture; about half the time, best-editing winners went on to win the biggest prize at the Oscars as well. Since the 2010s though, only one film has won both best picture and best editing—2012’s Argo—and it looks as though 2021 will continue the un-correlative trend. The Trial of the Chicago 7, which skillfully and seamlessly weaves together a story that unfolds across multiple timelines and points of view, won the American Cinema Editors guild’s Eddie award, indicating support among editor Alan Baumgarten’s cohort; a SAG win for the film’s cast indicates support among the actors of the Academy as well, which happens to be the voting group’s largest branch. So while Trial may very well be bested by Nomadland in best picture, it’s got more than a solid shot here—unless sleeper favorite Sound of Metal, a technically dazzling film with its own deep well of industry fans, pulls off an upset win for editor Mikkel E. G. Nielsen. —H.B.\n\nBest Original Song\n\n“Husavik (My Hometown),” Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\n\n“Fight for You,” Judas and the Black Messiah\n\n“Io Sì (Seen),” The Life Ahead\n\nWINNER: “Speak Now,” One Night in Miami…\n\n“Hear My Voice,” The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nFun fact: Mary J. Blige made history in 2018, becoming the first person to be nominated for both an acting Oscar and best original song in the same year, for her work on Mudbound. Every year since then, someone else has repeated the feat. In 2019, best-actress nominee Lady Gaga took home the award, for “Shallow” from A Star Is Born. In 2020, Cynthia Erivo received her first two Oscar nominations for starring in and writing the song for the biopic Harriet. This year it’s Leslie Odom Jr.’s turn, nominated as a supporting actor for playing Sam Cooke in One Night in Miami… and also for his original song. It’s a bit of a problem that the real showstopper song moment of the film comes right before, when Odom Jr. performs Cooke’s iconic hit “A Change Is Gonna Come.” But as a Tony winner with the most star power in this category who’s also representing a well-liked film that isn’t likely to win elsewhere, Odom ought to have enough to sneak past the rest of the pack. The other two potential winners, to be fair, both have powerful narratives of their own: “Husavik” is a barn burner of a power ballad that packs a surprising emotional punch in a silly comedy, while “Io Sì (Seen)” marks the astonishing 12th nomination for Diane Warren, who has never won. A victory for either of them, let’s say, would be far less surprising than Iceland winning the Eurovision Song Contest. —K.R.\n\nBest Score\n\nDa 5 Bloods\n\nMank\n\nMinari\n\nNews of the World\n\nWINNER: Soul\n\nTrent Reznor and Atticus Ross will probably pick up their second Oscar on Sunday, for their uncharacteristically sweet and wistful score for Pixar’s big 2020 film. The duo is also nominated for Mank, but we don’t think they’ll split the vote. We’d love to see Da 5 Bloods or Minari eke a win here—Emile Mosseri’s score for the latter is especially beautiful—but there are just too many big names and brands associated with Soul to be beat. —R.L.\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nOnward\n\nOver the Moon\n\nA Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon\n\nWINNER: Soul\n\nWolfwalkers\n\nIt’s no secret that Pixar’s Soul has run away with this category more often than not throughout the 2021 awards season. Its only real competition this year comes in the form of Cartoon Saloon’s wildly inventive Irish film Wolfwalkers, which has snatched up a few critics’ awards. But despite a creative awards campaign, Wolfwalkers was unable to defeat Soul even on its home turf at the BAFTAs. (Perhaps it was all the anti-Cromwell allusions.) As for everyone else, well, it’s an honor to be nominated. — J.R.\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nJudas and the Black Messiah\n\nMank\n\nNews of the World\n\nWINNER: Nomadland\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nGiven that even detractors of Nomadland have praised Joshua James Richards’s cinematography, we think it has the best chance of winning. But Mank’s lush black-and-white compositions are putting up a strong fight. It all comes down to what Academy voters like more: moody portraits of old Hollywood, or magic-hour vistas captured in all their unfussy, natural beauty. We think the current culture will embrace the latter just a little bit more. —R.L.\n\nBest Production Design\n\nThe Father\n\nWINNER: Mank\n\nNews of the World\n\nTenet\n\nMa Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nThe meticulous world of Mank seems to be right up the Academy’s alley this season. The painstakingly designed period piece is this year’s production design front-runner, preferred over fellow period pieces like Ma Rainey and News of the World. If all the punditry is right, Oscar-winning designer Donald Graham Burt, who has worked on many of Fincher’s projects, will nab his second Academy Award this year. His first win, shared with set decorator Victor J. Zolfo, arrived in 2009, courtesy of another Fincher project: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. —Y.D.\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nEmma\n\nWINNER: Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nMank\n\nMulan\n\nPinocchio\n\nLook for Ann Roth, whose designs crucially transformed Viola Davis into the pioneering blues singer, to make a historic win on Sunday. At age 89, Roth would become one of the oldest Oscar winners ever, and the oldest in the costume category—knocking Edith Head, who won for The Sting at age 76. Roth’s only previous Oscar win was in 1997 for The English Patient. —J.M.\n\nBest Hair and Makeup\n\nEmma\n\nHillbilly Elegy\n\nWINNER: Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom\n\nMank\n\nPinocchio\n\nThe team who transformed Viola Davis into the titular blues singer of Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom is favored to win this category after topping the MUAHS Guild Awards. Davis—who earned her fourth Oscar nomination for the role—was an eager partner, happy to wear a wig made of horsehair, charcoal-like makeup that looked like she had applied it herself, and gold teeth. “She came from vaudeville, so subtle was not a thing for her,” makeup artist Sergio Lopez-Rivera told Vanity Fair. “I did everything with my fingers; I didn’t want any straight lines.” —J.M.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nLove and Monsters\n\nThe Midnight Sky\n\nMulan\n\nThe One and Only Ivan\n\nWINNER: Tenet\n\nChristopher Nolan’s time-bending thriller had a rough year, struggling to find an audience amid the pandemic. Still, the film’s clever team of VFX artists used digital magic to enhance the story and create genuinely original imagery that challenged the imagination. Every other film in this category has solid effects, but the kinds that have been seen before. Even though Tenet wasn’t seen much at all on the big screen, the voters noticed. —A.B.\n\nBest Sound\n\nGreyhound\n\nMank\n\nNews of the World\n\nSoul\n\nWINNER: Sound of Metal\n\nUsually, this is a space where we got lost in the technicalities of trying to clarify the difference between sound “editing” and sound “design.” But the Academy has decided to blend the two prizes this year into a solitary “sound” category, which may now take on more of an artistic bent. When it comes to the so-called below-the-line categories, it’s often helpful to take a cue from the pre-Oscars guild awards. In the case of sound, however, the editors and the designers are still divided into the Motion Picture Sound Editors and the Cinema Audio Society—so their prizes this year may be more confusing than helpful. The MPSE awarded both Tenet and Trial of the Chicago 7, neither of which are up for a prize here. CAS went with Sound of Metal. Both guilds awarded prizes to Soul, and there is a precedent for Pixar winning this Oscar category with 2004’s The Incredibles. But the idea of a film like Sound of Metal, where sound and the lack thereof is the story, just feels perfect for this newly consolidated category. —J.R.\n\nBest Animated Short\n\nBurrow\n\nGenius Loci\n\nWINNER: If Anything Happens I Love You\n\nOpera\n\nYes-People\n\nIf voters are looking to award something perfectly sweet in this category, they might go with Burrow—the story of a bunny and the animal friends who help him build a new home. Burrow is part of Pixar’s SparkShorts program and, as we all know, Pixar is tough to beat. However, If Anything Happens I Love You—a traumatic study of the emotional fallout from school shootings—might inspire Academy members to vote with their social conscience instead. This film’s chances are bolstered by the star power behind it, including codirector Will McCormack—an actor and Rashida Jones’s frequent writing partner—and Academy darling Laura Dern serving as executive producer. —J.R.\n\nBest Documentary Short\n\nColette\n\nA Concerto Is a Conversation\n\nDo Not Split\n\nHunger Ward\n\nWINNER: A Love Song for Latasha\n\nAs is often the case in this category, all the nominated documentary shorts this year deal in harrowing subjects: the Holocaust (Colette), child famine (Hunger Ward), the Hong Kong protests (Do Not Split), the tragic shooting of Black Americans (A Love Song for Latasha), and segregation (A Concerto Is a Conversation). Only Concerto, which includes giddy footage of its subject, Green Book composer Kris Bowers, onstage at the 2019 Oscars, maintains a hopeful note. Of all these hard-to-watch films, by far the most effective is the Ava DuVernay–supported A Love Song for Latasha, which creatively explores the 1991 death of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins without using the infamous security footage that partially inspired the L.A. riots. Filmmaker Sophia Nahli Allison opted, instead, to film young Black girls in Latasha’s old neighborhood while audio of those who best knew Latasha and her potential plays over the sun-drenched images. —J.R.\n\nBest Live Action Short\n\nFeeling Through\n\nThe Letter Room\n\nThe Present\n\nWINNER: Two Distant Strangers\n\nWhite Eye\n\nThe dominant theme in this category is law enforcement behaving badly. When it comes to star power, it’s tough to beat The Letter Room, which stars Oscar Isaac as a downtrodden prison guard who gets emotionally attached to the girlfriend (Alia Shawkat) of one of his inmates. Bafflingly, his transgressive behavior goes unquestioned by the film’s director, Elvira Lind (who’s also Isaac’s wife). When it comes to flash, the leader is Two Distant Strangers, a Groundhog Day–inspired film about a young Black man who gets shot over and over again by a white cop, no matter which route he takes home. The peppy tone is off-putting, but the pro–Black Lives Matter messaging is clear. Flash and star power usually win out in this category, but there’s still hope for one hidden gem: The Present. The simple story of a Palestinian man and his young daughter enduring harassment and worse as they traverse the Israeli-occupied West Bank won the BAFTA, so maybe it will take home a deserving prize on Oscar night as well. —J.R.\n\nMore Great Oscar Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Oscar Predictions 2021: Who Will Win at the Academy Awards?\n\n— Julia Roberts and the Gladiator: Recapping the 2001 Oscar Ceremony\n\n— Chadwick Boseman, Glenn Close, Frances McDormand: 2021 Nominees at Their First-Ever Oscars\n\n— Chadwick Boseman’s Best and Boldest Roles\n\n— Your Guide to Each Best-Picture Nominee’s Stars and Scandals\n\n— How Inclusive Could the 2021 Winners List Be?\n\n— Carey Mulligan’s Greatest Roles, From Doctor Who to Promising Young Woman\n\n— Nomadland Is Stirring Up Controversy.
