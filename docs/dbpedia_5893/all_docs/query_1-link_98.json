        "text": "Nominations for the 30th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards were announced on Wednesday morning, giving nods to a handful of last year's blockbusters and critical hits during a presentation hosted by Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae.\n\n\"Barbie,\" \"Oppenheimer\" and \"American Fiction\" led the SAG Awards nominations this year for films, while \"Succession\" led for television series. Other films that will compete for the prize in the award show's top category, for best ensemble in a motion picture, are \"The Color Purple\" and \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nNominees across film and television were similar to those that contended recently at the Golden Globe Awards, outside of \"The Color Purple\" — which was not nominated in the Globes' main film races in a turnout that many considered a snub — and \"Poor Things\" — which took home several top honors at the Globes but only earned two acting nominations from the Screen Actors Guild. \"Oppenheimer\" won big at the Globes as did \"Succession,\" the series that also dominates the nominations list for the Emmys.\n\nThe SAG Awards have been known historically to provide the biggest clues as to which titles, performers and creators could go on to receive nominations for the Academy Awards — which will be unveiled next weekend — and how those contenders might eventually fare on Oscars night.\n\nThe SAG Awards takes place Feb. 24 and will be streamed live on Netflix. The ceremony comes after a year of contention between Hollywood studios and film and television actors who are part of the SAG-AFTRA union, which combines the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The union reached a tentative agreement with studios in November for a new labor contract, ending a four-month strike.\n\nHere are 2024 SAG Awards nominees:\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role\n\nAnnette Bening, \"Nyad\"\n\nLily Gladstone, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nCarey Mulligan, \"Maestro\"\n\nMargot Robbie, \"Barbie\"\n\nEmma Stone, \"Poor Things\"\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role\n\nBradley Cooper, \"Maestro\"\n\nColman Domingo, \"Rustin\"\n\nPaul Giamatti, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nCillian Murphy, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nJeffrey Wright, \"American Fiction\"\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nEmily Blunt, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nDanielle Brooks, \"The Color Purple\"\n\nPenelope Cruz, \"Ferrari\"\n\nJodie Foster, \"Nyad\"\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nSterling K.
