        "text": "The dark comedy Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri continues to post more victories on the way to the Oscars, with three more trophies coming Sunday night at the 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nThe film took the event's top honor — best cast in a motion picture, the SAG equivalent of a best-picture category — plus lead female actor for Frances McDormand and male supporting actor for Sam Rockwell. Gary Oldman took lead male actor for Darkest Hour, while I, Tonya star Allison Janney was named outstanding female actor in a supporting role.\n\nAmong the major TV categories, the HBO limited series Big Little Lies notched a couple of wins for Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård, Veep took best cast in a comedy and This Is Us was victorious as outstanding drama ensemble. There was also a little history made: This Is Us' Sterling K. Brown became the first African-American actor to win male actor in a drama, while Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who notched two wins, broke the record for most SAG honors for a single actor. (Julianna Margulies and Alec Baldwin each have eight.)\n\nIn preshow awards, Wonder Woman won best stunt ensemble for a movie while HBO's Game of Thrones received the honor for stunt ensemble in a TV show.\n\nMore: Screen Actors Guild Awards 2018: The winners' list\n\nMore: Julia Louis-Dreyfus watched her historic 'Veep' SAG Award wins from home in her pajamas\n\nHere's a minute-by-minute (ET) breakdown:\n\n10:02: The biggest prize of the night, best cast in a motion picture, goes to Three Billboards.\n\n9:58: Three Billboards' Frances McDormand storms the stage to accept for female actor in a motion picture. She calls out the importance of representation and serving the work, calling out director Martin McDonagh for writing \"a tsunami\" and letting \"his crew of actors surf it into shore.\"\n\n9:47: Gary Oldman of Darkest Hour continues a stellar run through awards season by winning best male actor in a motion picture. \"I've become very emotional,\" Oldman says. \"I am honestly and truly thrilled and overjoyed to be in this room tonight, not only with may amazing fellow nominees but my friends and peers.\"\n\nMore: SAG Awards 2018: Hollywood (mostly) leaves the 'Me Too' discussion behind\n\nMore: SAG Awards 2018: Time's Up quotes overheard on the red carpet\n\n9:44: NBC's tearjerking This Is Us is named best cast in a drama.

Everybody's weird and strange. We just embrace ourselves for who we are.\" He also thanks his \"white family, which is nothing like the white family of Get Out.\"\n\n9:12: Matching a ball cap with his tux, Freeman accepts his award and banters with presenter Rita Moreno. \"These movies in one's life usually call for an entire litany of 'thank you's. I can't do that because I don't know all your names. So I won't try,\" Freeman deadpans. \"This is beyond honor. This is a place in history.\"\n\n9:04: Moreno hits the stage to present the recipient for this year's life-achievement award, Morgan Freeman — four years after he presented the same honor to her. \"The stars aligned and here we are,\" says Moreno, who first worked with Freeman nearly 50 years ago on The Electric Company. She recalls the time she was playing a bratty girl and Freeman was Dracula: \"This was educational programming at its finest.\" Moreno honors his philanthropic efforts and calls him \"a national treasure.\"\n\n8:53: Big Little Lies gets its second honor of the night with Nicole Kidman getting female actor in a limited series. \"This means a lot to me,\" says Kidman, who's been acting since she was 14. \"This is reality colliding with fantasy right now. To receive this at this stage of my life is extraordinary.\" She pays tribute to Jessica Lange, Susan Sarandon, Meryl Streep and others for the \"trailblazing performances you've given. ... Twenty years ago we were pretty washed up by this age. That's not true anymore.\"\n\nMore: Millie Bobby Brown's Converse sneakers were the SAG Awards' best accessory\n\nMore: William H. Macy backstage at the SAG Awards: 'It's hard to be a man these days'\n\n8:42: Male actor in a TV limited series or movie goes to Big Little Lies' Alexander Skarsgård. \"A lot of people have been talking about the greatest male actor ever: Is it Robert De Niro or the tall dude from True Blood? The thespians have spoken,\" he quips, mentioning the legend also in his category before admitting he's \"shocked and humbled\" by the win.\n\n8:33: Sam Rockwell bro-kisses Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri co-star (and fellow nominee) Woody Harrelson on the way to accepting male actor in a supporting role. \"This is awesome,\" Rockwell says, shouting out another \"powerhouse\" co-star, Frances McDormand: \"I'm in awe of you and I stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you and all the incredible women in this room trying to make things better. It's long overdue.\"\n\n8:27: Allison Janney continues to rule awards season by adding female actor in a supporting role to her Golden Globe and Critics' Choice honors for I, Tonya. She says co-star Margot Robbie is a fearless \"rock star\" and thanks her entire acting company \"that made magic.\"\n\n8:17: Veep follows up Louis-Dreyfus' win by snagging best comedy ensemble. \"We do sincerely love that you gave us this wonderful Grammy, so thank you,\" jokes star Matt Walsh.\n\nMore: Nicole Kidman celebrates actresses over 40 at SAGs: '20 years ago (we'd be) pretty washed up'\n\nMore: SAG Awards 2018 best dressed: Margot Robbie, Millie Bobby Brown and more\n\n8:12: Julia Louis-Dreyfus takes female actor in a TV comedy for Veep — her fifth win in the category — but isn't at the show. \"Julia, we're thinking of you,\" says Connie Britton, accepting the award for Louis-Dreyfus, who recently underwent treatment for breast cancer.\n\n8:08: William H. Macy of Shameless wins the first trophy of the night, for male actor in a TV comedy. He talks about acting getting to the truth and it being important at time when \"so many people can't recognize the truth or don't think it's important.\"\n\n8:03: Host Kristen Bell calls herself \"the first lady\" — since she's the first host. She calls out the cast of Get Out, a \"walking reminder that if you say yes to the Tea Party, you're automatically on the way to the Sunken Place.\" She admits that everyone's story needs to be told, even \"the sea monster\" of The Shape of Water, and gets serious when talking about the issues of the day: \"Fear and anger never win the race.\""
