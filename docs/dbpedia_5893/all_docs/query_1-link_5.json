        "text": "Cillian Murphy (Oppenheimer) and Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon) won outstanding performance by a male and female actor in a leading role, respectively, at the 2024 SAG Awards. Both won in what were seen as close races with Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers) and Emma Stone (Poor Things), respectively.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. (Oppenheimer) and Da’vine Joy Randolph (The Holdovers) won the equivalent awards in supporting categories, as they have at the vast majority of award shows in recent months.\n\nAll four of these actors must now be considered the front-runners to win the Oscars in those categories on March 10. Last year, all four SAG Awards winners in film acting categories went on to win Oscars.\n\nThe 30th annual SAG Awards streamed live on Netflix on Saturday (Feb. 24) at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT from the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles.\n\nOppenheimer was the top winner on the film side, with three awards. Barbie experienced the night’s biggest shut out on the film side, going 0-4 on the night.\n\nOppenheimer won outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture, which is a positive, but far from conclusive, indicator that it may win the Oscar for best picture on March 10. The SAG winner for ensemble cast has gone on to win best picture in five of the last 10 years.\n\nThe Bear was the top winner on the TV side, with three awards. Ted Lasso was the biggest shut out on the TV side, going 0-4 on the night.\n\nSuccession won outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series for the second time in three years. The Bear won the equivalent award in comedy for the first time.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper presented the Life Achievement Award to Barbra Streisand. Here’s a complete report on that presentation, which was one of the show’s highlights.\n\nThe awards were voted on by SAG-AFTRA’s membership of 119,515 eligible voters, the largest voting body on the awards circuit. Final voting opened on Wednesday, Jan. 17, and closed at noon PT on Friday, Feb. 23. So, votes were still coming in less than 30 hours before the first awards were presented. There is a much longer lag time between the close of voting and the announcement of the winners at other award shows.\n\nThe 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards was executive produced by Jon Brockett and Silent House Productions. This marked the show’s live debut on Netflix. Last year’s ceremony was broadcast on Netflix’s YouTube page.\n\nHere’s the complete list of nominees for the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards, with winners marked.\n\nMotion Pictures\n\nOutstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role\n\nBradley Cooper – Maestro\n\nColman Domingo – Rustin\n\nPaul Giamatti – The Holdovers\n\nWINNER: Cillian Murphy – Oppenheimer\n\nJeffrey Wright – American Fiction\n\nOutstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role\n\nAnnette Bening – Nyad\n\nWINNER: Lily Gladstone – Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nCarey Mulligan – Maestro\n\nMargot Robbie – Barbie\n\nEmma Stone – Poor Things\n\nOutstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role\n\nSterling K.
