        "text": "Oppenheimer won the award for best performance by a cast in a motion picture at the 2024 SAG Awards, which were handed out Saturday night.\n\nThe film also scooped up two other awards, for leading actor Cillian Murphy and supporting actor Robert Downey Jr.\n\nLeading actress honors went to Lily Gladstone for Killers of the Flower Moon, while Da’Vine Joy Randolph was named best supporting actress for The Holdovers.\n\nOn the TV side, The Bear won three awards, including best ensemble in a comedy series. Star Jeremy Allen White won the nod for best performance by a male actor in a comedy series, while Ayo Edebiri won the female actor award in the same category. Another awards favorite, Succession, was named best drama series ensemble, but lost out in the other categories in which it was nominated.\n\nElsewhere, Beef took two awards: Ali Wong won the award for best performance by a female actor in a TV movie or limited series, while Steven Yeun won the male actor award in the same category.\n\nA surprised — and, he confessed, drunk — Pedro Pascal won the award for best male actor in a drama series for The Last of Us, beating out three actors from Succession, which dominated numerous awards shows throughout its run. Another surprised winner was Elizabeth Debicki, who won the award for best actress in a drama series, for The Crown. (See the star-studded arrivals.)\n\nAwards are voted on by members of SAG-AFTRA in categories across film and TV, including stunt performances. The winners of the stunt performers categories were announced during the red carpet preshow (those awards went to The Last of Us and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One).\n\nThe ceremony streamed live on Netflix from L.A.’s Shrine Auditorium.\n\nA full list of 2024 SAG Awards winners follows.\n\nMotion Picture Categories\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nErika Alexander as Coraline\n\nAdam Brody as Wiley Valdespino\n\nSterling K.
