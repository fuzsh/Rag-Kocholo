        "text": "George Takei is best known for his portrayal of Mr. Sulu in the acclaimed television and film series ‘Star Trek’. He’s an actor, social justice activist, social media mega-power, New York Times bestselling author, originated the role of Sam Kimura and Ojii-Chan in the Broadway musical ‘Allegiance’, and subject of ‘To Be Takei’, a documentary on his life and career. Takei’s acting career has spanned five decades, with more than 40 feature films and hundreds of television guest-starring roles to his credit. He is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Actors’ Equity Association and Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.\n\nNow a community activist, Takei serves as chair of the council of governors of East West Players, the nation’s foremost Asian Pacific American theatre. He is also a member of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest national lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender political organisation. Takei is Chairman Emeritus of the Japanese American National Museum’s Board of Trustees; a member of the US-Japan Bridging Foundation Board of Directors; and served on the Board of the Japan-United States Friendship Commission under President Bill Clinton. In recognition of his contribution to the Japan-United States relationship, in 2004, Takei was conferred with the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette, by His Majesty, the Emperor of Japan.\n\nWith Takei’s expansion into social media, interest in his personal life grew. In January 2014, ‘To Be Takei’, a Jennifer M. Kroot documentary on George’s life and career, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival that January, and was later released in select cinemas across North America.\n\nAmong his many accomplishments is a Grammy nomination Takei shared with Leonard Nimoy, in 1987, in the Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Recording category. He received a star on Hollywood Boulevard’s Walk of Fame in 1986. And in 1991, Takei left his signature and hand print, in cement, in front of Grauman’s Chinese Theatre.\n\nAs an author, Takei’s first book, his autobiography, ‘To the Stars’, was published in 1994; and in 2012 and 2013 he published his second and third books, ‘Oh Myyy! There Goes The Internet’, and its sequel, ‘Lions And Tigers And Bears: The Internet Strikes Back’. The latter two books explored his forays on social media and the Internet, earning placement on the Amazon e-book and paperback best-seller lists in 2012 and 2013, respectively.\n\nTakei’s social media dominance is best denoted by his numerous awards. Mashable.com named George a “social media superstar” on Facebook in 2012, where he currently has over 19.6 million combined fans. In 2013, Takei won the Shorty Award for Distinguished Achievement in Internet Culture. He has 32.48 million followers on Twitter, and posts on various social media platforms. He expanded his internet presence with the 2015 YouTube series, “It Takeis Two,” starring with husband, Brad Takei. The “reality” series shared the couple’s daily navigation of their world, with George’s vibrant sense of humour and Brad’s less-than-optimistic pragmatism.\n\nIn 2015, Cosmopolitan Magazine named Takei “One of the Internet’s 50 Most Fascinating People.” Takei and his husband, Brad, were married at the Japanese American National Museum on September 14, 2008. The Takeis reside in Los Angeles, California.\n\nTelly Leung is a Chinese-American, New York City native, Broadway & television performer, recording artist, producer, director, theater arts teacher & host.

In 2010, he starred as Angel in “Rent” at the Hollywood Bowl opposite Wayne Brady, directed by Neil Patrick Harris. Television audiences will remember him as Wes the Warbler on “Glee”, as well as his guest star appearances on “Instinct”, “Odd Mom Out,” “Deadbeat” and “Law and Order: Criminal Intent” and the PBS documentary, “Broadway or Bust”. He can be heard on many original Broadway cast recordings and has released two solo albums – I’ll Cover You (2012) and Songs for You (2016) – on The Yellow Sound Label. His EP, “You Matter” is a collection of 5 songs made during the 2020 lockdown with composer & arranger Gary Adler with all proceeds to benefit Broadway Cares / Equity Fights AIDS. His directing credits include “Godspell” (University of Michigan) and David Henry Hwang’s “Yellow Face” at Theatre Raleigh. His producing credits include “Grind” (a musical short film starring Anthony Rapp), “The Nice List” (a virtual holiday musical for the whole family) and “Ensemble” (a documentary about the lives of 13 Broadway ensemble members reunited on the one year anniversary of the Broadway shut down, currently availabe via Broadway on Demand).
