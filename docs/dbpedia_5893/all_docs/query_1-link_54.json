        "text": "“We bring empathy into a world that so much needs it,” said Gladstone. “It’s so easy to distance ourselves. It’s so easy to close off, to stop feeling. And we all bravely keep feeling. And that humanises people. That brings people out of the shadows. It brings visibility.”\n\nThe SAG Awards don’t always signify Oscar success. Two of the last five winners from the guild (The Trial of the Chicago 7 and Black Panther) lost at the Academy Awards. But in the past two years, all five of the top SAG prizes - best ensemble and the four acting winners - have corresponded with the eventual Oscar winners, including the ensembles for Everything Everywhere All at Once and CODA.\n\nThe SAG Awards on Netflix was the first major Hollywood award show to be exclusively streamed. That made for some significant tweaks to the age-old traditions of such ceremonies. There were no ads. Profanity was permitted. (“Don’t say anything you wouldn’t say in front of Oprah,” said Idris Elba.) And winners were occasionally interviewed backstage by red-carpet co-host Tan France - sometimes awkwardly, sometimes charmingly.\n\nThe SAG Awards, held at the Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall in Los Angeles, might have also previewed another potential nail-biter.\n\nMurphy and Paul Giamatti (The Holdovers) have also been seen as neck-and-neck. But Murphy, who won his first SAG Award, has now triumphed at the SAGs, the Baftas and the Globes, suggesting he has the clear edge heading into the Academy Awards.\n\nDowney Jr and Da’Vine Joy Randolph each won for their supporting performances, likewise solidifying their status as Oscar favourites.\n\n“Why me? Why now? Why do things seem to be going my way?” said Downey Jr, accepting his first SAG Award for a film performance. “Unlike my fellow nominees, I will never grow tired from the sound of my own voice.”\n\nRandolph’s performance in Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers has been a breakthrough role for the 37-year-old actor. Now, she appears poised to win the Academy Award.\n\n“To every actor out there still waiting in the wings for their chance, let me tell you: your life can change in a day,” Randolph said. “It’s not a question of if but when. Keep going.”\n\nAfter more than two decades airing on TNT and TBS to dwindling viewership, Netflix acquired telecast rights to the SAG Awards in early 2023. Netflix, a dominant force for years in awards season, turned host too.\n\n“Personally, I can’t wait to get home and have Netflix recommend this show to me based on all the other stuff that I watch myself in,” joked Elba, the night’s de facto emcee.\n\nThe TV awards went largely to the same shows that have cleaned up at the Emmys and Golden Globes: The Bear (best comedy series ensemble, Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri); Beef (Ali Wong, Steven Yeun); and the cast of Succession.\n\nOne exception was Pedro Pascal, who won best male actor in a drama series for The Last of Us over a trio of Succession stars.\n\n“This is wrong for a number of reasons,” said a visibly stunned Pascal. “I’m a little bit drunk. I thought I could get drunk.”\n\nThis year’s SAG Awards follows a gruelling months-long strike in which the SAG-AFTRA union fought a bitter battle over a number of issues. Much of the work stoppage was prompted over changes in the film and TV industry brought on by streaming and a sea change led by Netflix.\n\n“Your solidarity ignited workers around the world, triggering what forever will be remember as ‘the hot labor summer,’” said Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA. “This was a seminal moment in our union’s history.”\n\nThe new streaming platform was sure to put even more of a spotlight on one of the most closely-watched predictors of the Academy Awards. Oscar voting wraps Tuesday.\n\nBarbra Streisand held the audience in rapt attention while accepting a lifetime achievement award, presented by Jennifer Aniston and Bradley Cooper.\n\n“I remember dreaming of being an actress as a teenager sitting in my bed in Brooklyn with a pint of coffee icecream and a movie magazine,” said Streisand, who recalled being transfixed by “my first crush”, Marlon Brando.\n\nStreisand also took a moment to celebrate the Jewish pioneers of Hollywood.\n\n“Now I dream of a world where such prejudice is a thing of the past,” she said.\n\nToday’s show was one of Netflix’s most significant forays yet into live streaming events. Netflix has previously hosted a live Chris Rock comedy special, a celebrity golf tournament and a live reunion Love Is Blind episode that was marred by technical difficulties. But Netflix is gearing up for more, including an upcoming live tennis event.\n\nScreen Actors Guild Awards 2024 list of winners:\n\nFilm:\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture: Oppenheimer\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role: Lily Gladstone - Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role: Cillian Murphy - Oppenheimer\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role: Da’Vine Joy Randolph - The Holdovers\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role:Robert Downey Jr. - Oppenheimer\n\nTV:\n\nOutstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series: Succession\n\nOutstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series: The Bear\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series: Elizabeth Debicki - The Crown\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series: Pedro Pascal - The Last of Us\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy Series: Ayo Edebiri - The Bear\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy Series: Jeremy Allen White - The Bear\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series: Ali Wong - Beef\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited Series: Steven Yeun - Beef\n\nStunts:\n\nOutstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Television Series: The Mandalorian"
