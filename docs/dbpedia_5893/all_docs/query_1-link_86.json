        "text": "Last night a number of our favorite film and television actors attended the 19th annual Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, the only event that exclusively honors performers (both individual performances as well as the work of ensemble casts). While I could use this posting to talk about the winners of each of the 13 award categories or fashion faux pas, I am going to explore what the SAG Awards mean for the “Road to the Oscars.”\n\nLast night when Brad Pitt took center stage to announce Outstanding Performance By a Cast in Motion Picture, a collective silence filled the room as the nominations were listed one by one –Bridesmaids…The Artist…The Descendants…The Help…and Midnight in Paris. The front runners for the evening were The Artist and The Descendants; however, based on actor Jean Dujardin’s winning of the Outstanding Performance By A Male Actor, many were certain that The Artist had the award in the bag. But, then the most peculiar thing happened, The Help was announced as the winner. You could hear the excited applause fill the room, but you could also see the look of bewilderment on many people’s faces. What just happened? In a single moment, two things were confirmed. One, The Help has overwhelmingly strong support and backing by the SAG, the largest branch of the Academy, and two, The Descendants and The Artists will not be the only Oscar night heavy weight contenders. If either of these films had of won last night, it would have been a sure bet to win the Oscars.\n\nSo who are the Oscar heavy weights? In my opinion – The Artist, Hugo and The Help. Why?\n\nThe Artist – Jean Dujardin’s winning of the Best Male Actor in a Leading Role suggests that The Descendents starring George Clooney is not as loved by actors as previously thought. It still has a chance to win, but this is an early sign that The Artist, a filming pay homage to the silent film era, might just have the gusto to outshine it.\n\nThe Help – The SAGs proved it has major backing by the Actors Guild. The major accolades that it received last night for Outstanding Performance by a Cast and Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor speaks volumes. In one united, resounding voice the SAG told us – This film has clout and deserves a place right up there with the other front runners."
