        "text": "LOADINGERROR LOADING\n\nHollywood’s on-screen talent got a chance to celebrate their craft Saturday at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles.\n\nThe best of television and film gathered at the Shrine Auditorium, where performers honored their peers at the only awards show voted on by actors exclusively.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The Bear” topped the television categories, taking home the Comedy Series Ensemble award along with lead comedy actor trophies for stars Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri.\n\n“Oppenheimer” dominated on the film side, earning Best Cast in a Motion Picture, Best Supporting Actor for Robert Downey Jr. and Best Male Lead for Cillian Murphy.\n\nThe legendary Barbra Streisand was also given with this year’s Life Achievement Award.\n\nWith the Academy Awards right around the corner, a SAG Award often predicts Oscar gold on the horizon. Last year, all four actors who won in SAG Award film categories went on to take home trophies during the biggest night in film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSaturday’s ceremony was a particularly poignant moment for the SAG-AFTRA union, which made it through a monthslong strike last year.\n\nIn the end, representatives for SAG-AFTRA said that they were able to secure a three-year contract worth an estimated $1 billion.\n\nReflecting on the historic labor stoppage during the ceremony, SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said that the strike was “a seminal moment in our union’s history that has set the trajectory for many generations to come, not afraid but brave, not weak but powered, not peons but partners.”\n\nSee all of the winners from the 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards below:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFILM NOMINEES\n\nMotion Picture Cast\n\n“American Fiction”\n\n“Barbie”\n\n“The Color Purple”\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\n“Oppenheimer” ― WINNER\n\nMale Actor In A Leading Role\n\nBradley Cooper, “Maestro”\n\nColman Domingo, “Rustin”\n\nPaul Giamatti, “The Holdovers”\n\nCillian Murphy, “Oppenheimer” ― WINNER\n\nJeffrey Wright, “American Fiction”\n\nFemale Actor In A Leading Role\n\nAnnette Bening, “Nyad”\n\nLily Gladstone, “Killers of the Flower Moon” ― WINNER\n\nCarey Mulligan, “Maestro”\n\nMargot Robbie, “Barbie”\n\nEmma Stone, “Poor Things”\n\nMale Actor In A Supporting Role\n\nSterling K.
