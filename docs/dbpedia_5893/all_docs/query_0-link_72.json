        "text": "November 20 Monday Night PlayGround Playbill\n\nPosted by on November 19, 2023\n\nPlayGround presents Season 30\n\nMONDAY NIGHT PLAYGROUND\n\nTopic: “The Legacy of the Land We Inhabit”\n\nPresented in partnership with the Association of Ramaytush Ohlone\n\nSponsored by Avenue Greenlight & California Humanities\n\nNovember 20, 2023 7pm PT\n\nLive at Potrero Stage + Simulcast & On-Demand\n\nAcknowledging the Legacy of the Land We Inhabit\n\nPlayGround acknowledges that we are on the unceded ancestral homeland of the Ramaytush (RAH-my-toosh) Ohlone (oh-LOW-nee) and Lisjan (lih-SHAH-n) Ohlone, the original inhabitants of the San Francisco Peninsula and East Bay, respectively. As the past and present Indigenous stewards of this land and in accordance with their traditions, the Ramaytush Ohlone and Lisjan have never ceded, lost, nor forgotten their responsibilities as the caretakers of this place, as well as for all peoples who reside in their traditional territory. We recognize the historic injustice of the forcible removal of the Ohlone people from their ancestral lands, and that we benefit from living and working on their traditional homeland. We wish to pay our respects by acknowledging the Ancestors, Elders and Relatives of the Ramaytush and Lisjan Communities and by affirming their sovereign rights as First Peoples. We honor the storytellers of the Ohlone and are grateful for our ability to share and uplift Indigenous stories and those of other historically marginalized communities.\n\nTo learn about the legacy of the land you inhabit, visit Native-Land.ca | Our home on native land. To read the complete Land Acknowledgment Policy, click here.\n\nPlayGround’s Anti-Racist Policy\n\nPlayGround recognizes the impact of racial oppression within society and the American Theater and that we have been complicit in White Supremacy culture. Our goal is to co-create safety for our community by identifying and interrupting instances of racism and all forms of oppression when we witness them, through specific actions rooted in the principles of anti-racism and accessibility. In its endeavor to address the implications of our history, PlayGround is committed to its compliance with the following fundamental rights:\n\nThe recognition of inherent dignity and worth of each human being.\n\nThe recognition of equality of all human beings.\n\nRecognition of rights of ethnic, racial, cultural, linguistic and religious groups.\n\nEquality and non-discrimination.\n\nPlayGround’s Anti-Racist Policy applies to: all members of the PlayGround community, including employees, independent contractors, volunteers, audience members, donors, and general members of the community.\n\nTo read the complete Anti-Racist Policy, click here.\n\nMonday Night PlayGround Memberships\n\nWe are deeply grateful to our 2023-24 Monday Night PlayGround Members, whose direct support helps to underwrite artists fees for the Monday Night series across all four regions:\n\nSharon Baldwin, Jaisey Bates, Tim Bishop, Ms. Linda B Breaux-Smith, Summer Broyhill, Madeleine Butler, Ben Cain, Julie Campbell, Sidney Glass & Eleanor Clement Glass, Joan Cleveland, Ms. Marilyn Berg Cooper, Ann Ehrmann, Ms. Cherielyn Ferguson, Krystyna Finlayson, Sheri Flanders, Conde Freeman, Dr. Jan Gilman, Michael Tonjum & Jan Gilman, Hollis Greenwood, Dana Hall, Rachel Harner, Gail Hillebrand & Hugh Barroll, Brandy T Jones, Ms. Anne M.
