        "text": "The 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards honored the outstanding film and television performances of 2023, with Cillian Murphy, Lily Gladstone, Steven Yeun, and Elizabeth Debicki among the winners. Oppenheimer and Succession took home top ensemble awards, while Barbra Streisand received the SAG Life Achievement Award.\n\nThe 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards\n\nHosted by Idris Alba, this award show held particular significance as union members directly voted for their peers. The event carried a celebratory atmosphere, a welcome reprieve after the arduous year marked by the union strike. SAG-AFTRA members chose the 30th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards nominees in two separate committees, one for film and one for television, each composed of 2,500 randomly selected members.\n\nThis celebratory tone was further amplified by the show’s streaming on Netflix, allowing both hosts and winners more freedom of expression on stage. Consequently, tonight we had a noticeable number of swear words that would not have been tolerated on traditional broadcast television.\n\nBarbra Streisand, a legend in entertainment, received the SAG Life Achievement Award for her acting, singing, producing, writing, and directing prowess. Streisand’s career spans film, television, and stage, earning her numerous accolades including Oscars, Grammys, Emmys, and Tonys. Jennifer Anniston and Bradley Cooper presented this prestigious award. Hope you weren’t watching with your kids.\n\nList of Winner\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role\n\nCILLIAN MURPHY / J.
