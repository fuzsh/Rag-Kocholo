        "text": "Preview:\n\n‘Oppenheimer’ dominated the movie section of the 2024 SAG Awards.\n\nIn the TV categories, ‘The Bear’ and ‘Beef were predictable winners.\n\nThe show was carried by Netflix for the first time.\n\nThis year’s Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony happened Saturday evening, and while they’re extremely limited in their Oscar prognostication (since this is all about acting), there were still few surprises, but shared love among a variety of movies and shows.\n\nPerhaps the most unusual element was the venue –– not the location, but the fact that it is being carried live via Netflix after years on broadcast cable.\n\nThe show itself had some fun elements –– like the Emmys, it opted for a number of reunions from much-loved shows and movies, including ‘The Devil Wears Prada’ (Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep and Emily Blunt), ‘The Lord of the Rings’ Elijah Wood and Sean Astin, and the casts of ‘Breaking Bad’ and ‘Modern Family’, among others.\n\nOn the movie front, ‘Oppenheimer’ and ‘Barbie’ led the nominations, with the former taking Motion Picture Cast, Male Actor in a Leading Role for Cillian Murphy (does this point to him taking the Oscar instead of ‘The Holdovers’ Paul Giamatti?) and Male Actor in a Supporting Role for Robert Downey Jr. (who is a big Oscar favorite for playing Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan’s film). “Why me? Why now? Why do things seem to be going my way?,” RDJ quipped. “Unlike my fellow nominees, I will never grow tired from the sound of my own voice....”\n\n‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ only saw Lily Gladstone winning another award as Female Actor in a Lead Role, while ‘The Holdovers’ Da’Vine Joy Randolph added Female Actor in a Supporting Role to her considerable collection, pointing to her surely nabbing an Oscar next month.\n\nTV-wise, there were even fewer shockers since the delayed Emmys and other shows had featured many of the same winners. So ‘The Bear’ duo Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri once again took the stage to collect trophies (both deserving winners, even though the debate remains as to whether the tension-filled show is truly a comedy), as well as being part of the series wining the Comedy ensemble award. ‘Succession’ meanwhile, nabbed the Drama Ensemble trophy.\n\nIn other no-real-surprise news, Ali Wong and Steven Yeun both won for ‘Beef’.\n\nA mild surprise given what has happened so far? Pedro Pascal took Male Actor in a Drama Series for ‘The Last of Us’, beating out ‘Succession’s Kieran Culkin. Pascal was typically charming, admitting he’d thought he was allowed to get a little drunk and concerned he was making a fool of himself.\n\nRelated Article: ‘Barbie’, ‘Oppenheimer’ and ‘Succession’ Lead 2024 SAG Nominations\n\nScreen Actors Guild: Full Movie Winners List\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\n\n‘American Fiction’\n\n‘Barbie’\n\n‘The Color Purple’\n\n‘Killers of the Flower Moon'\n\n‘Oppenheimer’\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role\n\nBradley Cooper – ‘Maestro’\n\nColman Domingo – ‘Rustin’\n\nPaul Giamatti – ‘The Holdovers’\n\nCillian Murphy – ‘Oppenheimer’\n\nJeffrey Wright – ‘American Fiction’\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role\n\nAnnette Bening – ‘Nyad’\n\nLily Gladstone – ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’\n\nCarey Mulligan – ‘Maestro’\n\nMargot Robbie – ‘Barbie’\n\nEmma Stone – ‘Poor Things’\n\nOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role\n\nSterling K.
