The film also deals with the problems that plague the working classes of Mumbai. The film was also produced by Saeed Mirza, who also wrote the screenplay with Kundan Shah and had a cast of the best actors of New Cinema, Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil.

His next film was "Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho" (1984). According to the director the film is about struggle and fighting and the message is conveyed powerfully but also humorously. This movie celebrates the human tenacity almost to its extreme lengths.

It was in the film "Salim Langde pe Mat Ro" (1989) that Mirza confronted the problems of a minority community in India. In fact he was dealing with his own community. It was produced NFDC and according to the director on closest to his heart. A combination of monologue, drama and philosophy this film is the outcome of the director's reflections and introspections on the Muslim minority community. "Naseem" (1995) is very different from Mirza's earlier films with its silences, delicacies of sentiments and its nostalgia for an earlier age.
