        "text": "Hi Sandeep,\n\nI think its DVD will be releasing soon by NFDC as they are now releasing such old gems regularly from all languages..\n\nBut till then if you wish then you can watch it on Youtube as a fan has uploaded its VHS rip on it.\n\nCheers!\n\nHi Chris,\n\n1. I am not sure about Bhisham Sahni's DEBUT but it is quite possible.\n\n2. Actually it truly seems that his acting in TAMAS was better because it was in fact one of the best written screen adaltations of India.\n\n3. An article on TAMAS is always there in my minds, but honestly for me its too hard to write on things which are too close or which have been instrumental in re-shaping my own complete thought structure. So it will be coming soon may be a short one.\n\n4. TAMAS is and will be relevant forever as MAN is a non-learner from ages.......and yes it was thousands times way ahead than GADAR.\n\n5 A short article is there on DAMINI at the site and one soon is coming on the list of Indian Court Room Dramas too.\n\nSo keep visiting and keep writing in.\n\nCheers!"
