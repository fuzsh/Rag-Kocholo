Welcome to Bombay, through the eyes of a tour guide, who extols the pride and identity of Bombay, its iconic buildings and teeming multitudes, a rhythm-analysis of the city, speed, accident, anonymity - bodies stuck together with love (for the city?!). Its Neon, its night. The song soon shifts registers, a montage of port, mills and chemical industries. Bombay makes half the wealth of the country. Finally, the Brechtian choral song changes tune, the montage turns satirical and shots of skyscrapers share frames with the homeless on the footpaths, or with dense shanties. This Bombay anthem ends with the narrator taking us into the life of the central protagonist.
