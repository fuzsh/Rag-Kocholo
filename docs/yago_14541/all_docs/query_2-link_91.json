        "text": "Screenwriter and director Saeed Akhtar Mirza, who has written films like Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai, shared his opinion of The Kashmir Files recently. He had trashed the Vivek Agnihotri film and called it ‘garbage’. Now, the director has responded to it.\n\nVIVEK AGNIHOTRI HITS BACK AT SAEED AKHTAR MIRZA\n\nVivek Agnihotri shared a screenshot of the report. Highlighting the Nukkad director’s name and garbage, he wrote, “Maine kaha Mirza sahab ko Salaam. Fir milte hain Janaab, #TheDelhiFiles ke baad. 2024.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nSee the tweet here:\n\nWHAT HAD SAEED AKHTAR MIRZA SAID\n\nIn an interview with Indian Express, screenwriter and director Saeed Akhtar Mirza dissed The Kashmir Files. He said, “For me, The Kashmir Files is garbage. Is the Kashmiri Pandit issue garbage? No, it’s not. It’s real. Is it just Kashmiri Hindus? No. Muslims, too, are caught in an incredibly vulgar trap of the machinations of intelligence agencies, nations with so-called national interests, and paid guys from across the border, who continue to create havoc. The point is not to take sides. Be human and try to understand.”\n\nWHAT’S NEXT FOR VIVEK AGNIHOTRI?"
