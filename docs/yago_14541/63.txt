Summary: Mirza’s parody on housing legislation tells of Mohan Joshi (Sahni, the well-known novelist and brother of Balraj Sahni in his screen debut), a retired clerk who lives with his wife (Pathak) in an old Bombay tenement. Joshi sues his landlord, the evil property developer Kundan Kapadia (Khan), which starts a complicated and expensive legal procedure conducted by the slick lawyer Malkani (N. Shah). Eventually Joshi realises that one cannot win against entrenched economic powers. In the end, when the judge comes to see the condition of the building for himself, Kapadia’s men quickly cover its rickety walls with a coat of paint and Joshi, unable to control his anger, goes berserk and demolishes the place, making it collapse on to his own head. Mirza’s allegorical approach, using a crudely Brechtian idea of surface realism, allows him to cast the noted screen villain Amjad Khan (cf. Sholay, 1975) as the property developer with lather dripping from his chin or eating a leg of mutton.

Bambai Mumbai! Welcome to Bombay, through the eyes of a tour guide, who extols the pride and identity of Bombay, its iconic buildings and teeming multitudes, a rhythm-analysis of the city, speed, accident, anonymity - bodies stuck together with love (for the city?!). Its Neon, its night. The song soon shifts registers, a montage of port, mills and chemical industries. Bombay makes half the wealth of the country. Finally, the Brechtian choral song changes tune, the montage turns satirical and shots of skyscrapers share frames with the homeless on the footpaths, or with dense shanties. This Bombay anthem ends with the narrator taking us into the life of the central protagonist. Lyrics by Madhosh Bilgrami, who also wrote the dialogue and lyrics for Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai.

The gutter water from leaking pipes mixes with the drinking water!

This lampooning, melodramatic comic scene, ends with the Judge accepting the invitation to visit the chawl. A historic event that will go down in the annals of juridical history in golden letters!

The Judge visits the chawl. An event that seems to be taken from the the incident of Justice Lentin visiting the Kamraj Nagar basti in 1982 in the wake of CM Antulay's Operation Demolition. Harun Mirza announces his arrival.

A protracted court battle of 6 years. Justice delayed is justice denied. Mohan Joshi puts an end to his struggle for housing.
