        "text": "The A-Team: Series 1-5 | DVD | (24/10/2016) from £84.99 | Saving you £-55.00 (N/A%) | RRP £29.99\n\nInitially one of NBC network's most successful series, The A-Team ran for 90 one-hour episodes (with a few feature-length specials thrown in) from 1983 to 1987. The premise of the series was certainly different. A group of US operatives is sent to rob the Bank of Hanoi during the Vietnam War in an attempt to destabilise the country's economy, but the bigwig who organises the raid is killed, leaving no indication that the mission was officially sanctioned. Returning home, Smith (George Peppard), BA (it stood for \"Bad Attitude\") Baracus (Mr T), Face (Dirk Benedict) and that \"crazy foo\" Murdoch (Dwight Schultz) suddenly find themselves accused of criminal activity, obliging them to set up as benevolent mercenaries. They tear around the country in what looks like a delivery van, generally do-gooding while keeping one step ahead of the inept military police. Snappy, witty and fast paced, the series began as a spoof of the action-thriller genre. It wasn't until the later episodes that an element of seriousness crept in, which may have caused the decline in audience figures eventually resulting in the show's cancellation. On video and DVD though, it remains a feast for fans of classic cult TV.--Roger Thomas\n\nBattlestar Galactica - Complete Series | DVD | (18/02/2008) from £5.94 | Saving you £10.05 (169.19%) | RRP £15.99\n\nWhen the Battlestar Galactica finally arrives at the planet Earth they find they must subtly raise its tech level & protect it from the Cylons.
