        "text": "Background\n\nRichard Wayne Van Dyke was born in Missouri on December 13, 1925. Loren Wayne Cookie Van Dyke worked as a salesperson, while Hazel Victoria Van Dyke worked as a stenographer. Jerry Van Dyke, the late actor, comedian, and musician, is his brother.\n\nDanville High School was his alma mater. Van Dyke considered pursuing a career in ministry as a child because his mother’s family was quite devout. During World War II, he dropped out of high school in 1944 to join the United States Air Force. After numerous efforts, he was finally accepted into the army as a radio announcer.\n\nHe worked as a radio D.J. in Danville in the late 1940s. He began his television career with a comedy show on WDSU-TV New Orleans Channel 6 in New Orleans, now N.B.C. In “James’ Chance of a Lifetime,” he made his debut appearance on network television (1954). In November 1959, he made his Broadway debut in the play “The Girls Against the Boys.” Van Dyke was approached in 1961 for the sitcom “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” to which he responded positively. In 1963, he received his first film job, portraying Albert Peterson in the film adaptation of “Bye Bye Birdie.” He was cast in two roles in Walt Disney’s “Mary Poppins” not long after. From 1971 through to 1974, the American superstar played a local television talk show host in the sitcom “The New Dick Van Dyke Show.” In 1973, he lent his voice to the final episode titled “Scooby-Doo Meets Dick Van Dyke” in Hanna-Barbera’s “The New Scooby-Doo Movies.” In 1976, Van Dyke returned to humor with “Van Dyke and Company,” a sketch comedy show. He did largely T.V. pictures for the rest of the decade. In 1987, he and his son Barry Van appeared in an episode of the T.V. show “Airwolf.” He made an appearance on N.B.C.’s “The Golden Girls” two years later. He has starred in many successful films, including “Dick Tracy” (1990) and “Murder 101.” (2003). “Step (Back) In Time,” his debut solo album, was published in 2017. He also collaborated with actress Jane Lynch on a duet single. That year, the song ‘We’re Going Caroling’ was published as a Christmas single.\n\nOn February 12, 1948, Van Dyke married former Margerie Willett on the radio show “Bride and Groom.” Before divorcing in 1984, the couple had four children: Christian, Stacy, Barry, and Carrie Beth. After that, the actor moved in with Michelle Triola, his longtime companion of almost 30 years. Triola passed away in 2009. On February 29, 2012, he married Arlene Silver who is a makeup artist. He is the grandfather of seven grandchildren. For many years of his adult life, the American superstar was a habitual smoker and drinker. He confessed in 2013 that he had been suffering from neurological problems for the previous seven years."
