        "text": "In my opinion, Star Wars was the most influential science fiction film of all time, its influence touching even unrelated genres. It, along with Jaws, defined what a Summer blockbuster was, the term didn’t exist before them. Star Wars’ box office numbers definitely couldn’t be ignored by anyone in 1977, especially not by studio and TV execs. Every motion picture company and television network scrambled to produce some kind of sci-fi title, dusting off ideas that had sat on shelves, or imagining anything that could be derivative. Thus in 1978 Battlestar Galactica was born on the ABC television network.\n\nMuch derided by its critics as a Star Wars knockoff, Galactica really stands on its own merits for an original idea and story arc. The only real borrowing BG did was in the concept of “fighter planes in space.” Before SW, the idea of single or two person spaceships acting as fighter craft was nonexistent; spaceships were either battleships or, at the other end of the spectrum, cars in space. Galactica even took the space fighter concept a step further with the battlestar acting as a space aircraft carrier. Looking back on the two productions today, it seems ridiculous that there was a suit by Fox alleging that Galactica stole numerous “concepts” from Star Wars.\n\nBG’s premise was far from Star Wars’, its whole ethos woven from a new concept, blending biblical material and a pharaonic Egypt aesthetic; the first exhibitions of Tutankhamen’s treasure outside of Egypt had been touring the States throughout the 70s and no doubt was an inspiration. Battlestar Galactica endeared itself to its fans specifically because it wasn’t a blatant Star Wars ripoff, seeming like it was written by true fans of the genre.\n\nAs a 14 year old, I was just as engrossed by the series as I was Star Wars the year before. The uniforms, spacecraft, and sets were all well designed, the conceptual art they were based upon coming from some of the same artists who worked on SW. My Colonial Viper model sat proudly next to my X-Wing Fighter while I dreamt of someday wearing a Colonial Warrior’s leather jacket with the cool clasps. So at the end of its first season in the Spring of 1979, it appeared Battlestar Galactica could be back in the Fall, even though the ratings had been slowly declining. The decision to cancel the series before the season ended seemed ludicrous to my friends and I.\n\nAfter a letter writing campaign by fans of the show (one of the first of its kind), ABC relented and brought back Galactica in the Spring of 1980, yet in a much altered and cheaply made form. One wonders if the attempt should have been made at all.\n\nGalactica 1980’s premise indicates how poorly thought out the whole show was. Set 30 years after the end of the first season, the Galactica and its fleet finally arrive at Earth, finding the planet technologically far behind and not able to help in the fight against the Cylons. So here we go right away, 30 years after the events of the first season which ended with Apollo discovering the radio signals of the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon. Let’s see, 1969 plus 30 years, that should be 1999, right? Nope, 1980 according to Adama who is pitifully guided by a 12 (?) year old super genius starchild named Dr. Z (Z for what? Zaius?). Boxey, Apollo’s adopted son, is now called Troy and is accompanied in his mission to improve Earth’s technology by his buddy Dillon.\n\nOf the original cast, only Adama and Boomer remained; Boomer being seen far less than any of the other cast. To be fair, the roles of Troy and Dillon were well played by Kent McCord and Barry Van Dyke. McCord was a household favorite for his role on Adam-12, which our family watched religiously during its run from the late 60s to mid 70s. Barry Van Dyke was pretty much a journeyman actor before Galactica. Known more for his varied roles on his famous father’s shows, Van Dyke put across an earnest performance even with the crappy material he was given. Throughout the limited 10 show season you can almost see the exasperation on McCord’s and Van Dykes’ faces in dealing with the horrendous scripts.\n\nAnd that comes to the point of what made Galactica 1980 such an awful show. It seems like they drummed up every hackneyed television writer in the industry to churn out the episodes, many of which had moronic and clichéd plots. Every Brady Bunch, Partridge Family, Happy Days, and Gilligan’s Island writer seemed to have had a hand in the absurd stories. From the lame flying motorcycles to the super scouts to the crappily produced time travel, everything had little to no imagination. Budgets for the episodes were non-existent. You could tell the writers hadn’t a clue about the previous season, much less science fiction, by the inane technical language used, much of which made no sense other than it sounded sci-fi to them. Nearly all of the terms made up for the original season were either misused or thrown away entirely, the units of measure thrown around higgily-piggily with no meaning. Even the name of their race was bastardized, calling them Galacticans instead of Colonials or the planets they originated from like Capricans, Taurons, etc.\n\nI was 16 by the time Galactica 1980 finally aired, hoping beyond hope that the cheesy previews leading up to the show didn’t represent the whole of the series; I should have known better. I watched a few episodes with a twisted gut and then finally gave up and took advantage of a recently acquired driver’s license, the one exception being the final episode featuring Starbuck. Some episode glimpses reached me when I would visit a friend or girlfriend while the show was on, many of them surprised that I didn’t like it.\n\nIt came as no surprise to anyone, even the show’s most fervent fans, when Galactica was mercifully taken off the air. At science fiction conventions everyone knew that you were referring to the original Galactica and not 1980 when you mentioned that you liked the show. And so it went till the reboot, the age of Netflix, and streaming media.\n\nWhen the Galactica reboot came out, both the wife and I watched it without fail. It’s a testament to the quality of the new series that my wife was so engaged by it since she doesn’t normally like sci-fi. It perfectly updated the original series, playing down the occasional campiness from the 70s and bringing a gritty realism that put you in the characters’ lives, making you feel like you were really watching the remnants of humanity struggle to escape the Cylons.\n\nLast year, after being diagnosed with cancer, I was ready for some real escapism to counteract not only the reality of the situation, but the constant medical appointments and recovery period after coming home from the hospital. Enter Netflix streaming.\n\nI began by rewatching the original series, trying to pick up clues of how the reboot’s creators got their inspiration. And they’re there too if you look for them. From Adama’s relationships to a revised Tigh to the kernels of plot points throughout the series, I could see many inspirations for characters and stories, all that is except for the human Cylons.\n\nAfter finishing the entire first series, I was reluctant to carry on with 1980, it had left such a bad taste from when it originally aired. But, like I mentioned earlier, I had never seen all of the episodes, start to finish, which is why I did a double take while watching the two part story arc When the Cylons Landed.\n\nThe episodes themselves are typical of the poor quality of the entire series: a Cylon ship discovers Earth, is shot down, and Dillon and Troy must race to stop them from finding a radio station and sending the Cylon fleet the coordinates of Earth. All of this is excruciatingly drawn out into two episodes. Did I mention that this takes place on Halloween and the guys have to figure out what that is, that Wolfman Jack is at a Halloween party where the Cylons show up, that there are horrible meatball jokes, and that one of the Cylons looks like a human? (Well, actually it’s two Cylons that look human, one of them is destroyed in the crash on Earth)\n\nYep, the Cylons for some reason decide that they’re going to make human looking units; they’re still mechanical on the inside, but look and act eerily human. Bingo. From a gimmicky plot point of two throw away episodes came one of the most intriguing elements of the reboot.\n\nWho would argue with the fact that the human Cylons are one of the top reasons the reboot was so good? Especially in the earlier seasons, not knowing who was a Cylon living among humanity heightened the suspense. Trying to guess what the known Cylons’ motivations were and the consequences thereof made it a must watch. The human Cylons put the Syfy (SciFi) channel on the map, it made it respectable. Without them you fanboys and girls wouldn’t have your endless Sharknado movies, on second thought, yes you would, but you wouldn’t have The Expanse, definitely not something of that caliber.\n\nSo, you can take my word for it and not watch Galactica 1980, contenting yourself with reading episode synopses. Or, if you’re a glutton for punishment, you could watch all ten of its episodes. Or you could just get your teeth pulled and feel the same way in the end.\n\nWatch the YouTube Episode:\n\nGet the Shows:\n\nBattlestar Galactica (1978) on Amazon\n\nBattlestar Galactica (1978) on iTunes\n\nGalactica 1980 on Amazon\n\nGalactica 1980 on iTunes\n\nBattlestar Galactica (reboot) on Amazon\n\nBattlestar Galactica (reboot) on iTunes\n\nStar Wars on Amazon\n\nStar Wars on iTunes\n\nReferences\n\nWikipedia\n\nimdb.com\n\nPhoto Credit\n\nFeatured Image: Obtained from play.google.com"
