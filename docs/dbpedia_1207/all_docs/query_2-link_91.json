        "text": "15 Classic & Iconic TV Episodes That We Are STILL Thinking About\n\nWith so many great dramas and sitcoms over the decades, it’s not always easy to remember them all. But we dove into some of television’s greatest series to choose the outstanding episodes, and even moments, that we all remember and love. There’s the funny: Carol Burnett descending a grand staircase as Starlet O’Hara wearing an even grander gown that looks suspiciously like a window curtain on The Carol Burnett Show; Mary Richards laughing uncontrollably at a funeral for Chuckles the Clown on The Mary Tyler Moore Show; Sammy Davis Jr. planting a kiss on Archie Bunker on All in the Family; Seinfeld‘s Soup Nazi yelling “No soup for you!” There’s the dramatic: young Laura Ingalls’ painful regret for not praying for a sick brother on Little House on the Prairie and Sgt. Phil Esterhaus unexpectedly passing away on Hill Street Blues. And then there are some of the most-watched episodes ever, like when we all found out who shot J.R. on Dallas and when the doctors and nurses of M*A*S*H left Korea for good.\n\n15 of the most iconic TV episodes ever\n\nWant More?\n\n1970s Fall TV\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nTake a trip back to the ’70s by looking at the TV Guide Magazine Fall Preview primetime lineups.\n\nBuy This Issue\n\nMore Of This:\n\nFollow Us\n\nNewsletter\n\nWeekly Roundup of Top Posts\n\nCopyright © 2024 NTVB Media"
