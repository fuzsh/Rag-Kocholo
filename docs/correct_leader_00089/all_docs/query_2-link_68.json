        "text": "Two women and six men are candidates in Finland’s presidential election, which will be held in January. Unexpected twists were typical of the last two elections, but this time the only surprise is likely to be a lack of surprises. Nevertheless, “there’s election excitement in the air,” writes Kyösti Karvonen, Managing Editor of the newspaper Kaleva.\n\nAs one of the candidates is the overwhelming favourite, you might imagine that neither the public nor the media would be particularly interested in the election. And in fact, at present , this is the outlook for the January polls.\n\nBut surprising though it may seem, there is election excitement in the air, whether the results are a foregone conclusion - or not. Even though the formerly very broad powers of the President were reduced extensively by the new constitution, which took effect in 2000, a presidential election in the northernmost member state of the European Union, a country of 5.3 million people, never fails to generate excitement. The coming election is no exception.\n\nThere are good reasons for election fever to rise every six years. The President is chosen by the people in a direct, two-stage election. This means that citizens can exert more influence in Finnish Presidential elections than in any other polls. Despite the fact that out of eight candidates seven were nominated by political parties, the parties play only a secondary role in the election. In the forefront are the candidates themselves, with their personal qualities and views, and not the often empty platforms of the parties.\n\nThe new constitution made the Prime Minister, instead of the President, the most influential politician in Finland. But despite this change, the public still regard the President as the symbolic leader of the nation. The presidency was raised to this status during the 25-year rule of President Urho Kekkonen. If Finns wish to exert an influence on some political issue, that issue is choosing the President, the head of state.\n\nA few surprises\n\nThe campaign had already produced a few surprises by late November and there may be many more to come during the remaining weeks.\n\nIn the two previous direct presidential elections, flip-flops occurred; the favourites in the opinion polls changed in rapid succession and some came crashing down on election day. This time, the present popularity ratings of the candidates may more or less last right up to the elections. One reason is that one of the candidates is the incumbent, who usually has the advantage in an election. Secondly, the three front runners – Tarja Halonen, the President; Matti Vanhanen, the Prime Minister; and Sauli Niinistö, Vice-Chairman of the European Investment Bank – have led the pack from the outset. This time the surprise may be that there are no surprises.\n\nAnother exceptional factor in this election campaign is that President Halonen, who was elected by a narrow margin in 2000, appears to have held onto the immense popularity that she has amassed during her term unusually far into the campaign. Her support hovered around 58 per cent in the several opinion polls conducted during the autumn.\n\nIt would be quite a coup if Halonen netted the same proportion of votes. And if her popularity does not slip before the elections, she will be re-elected in the first round on Sunday, January 15. The greatest danger for her is that - convinced of her victory - substantial numbers of her supporters will stay at home on election day.\n\nAgainst this background, some observers were a little surprised when an opinion poll published in the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat on December 3 showed a drop in support for the President from 58 to 52 per cent. Her campaign manager was not worried, saying that some \"turbulence\" in opinion polls had been expected. If this trend turns out to be true, it is possible that a second round would be needed.\n\nAnd the fact remains that Halonen’s popularity has been unusually high for a western democracy. There are several explanations for this. She has been a staunch defender of the Nordic welfare model, she does not consider Finnish membership of NATO to be an urgent matter and she has created a very down-to-earth image for herself and avoided becoming isolated from the rest of society.\n\nSupport for Vanhanen trailing\n\nStriking has been the weak showing by Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen, the candidate of the Centre Party, which is the main partner in the governing coalition. Late into November, one poll after another drenched him with a double cold shower. First, he fell behind National Coalition candidate Sauli Niinistö in all but one of them. Second, support for Vanhanen, at least in the opinion polls, fell notably short of the usual showing made by his party in other elections. In presidential election polls this autumn, Vanhanen’s popularity has ranged from 15 to 19 per cent, while that of his party has been around 23 per cent.\n\nVanhanen’s at least initial lacklustre showing calls for some explanation. First of all, as the Prime Minister, who works closely with the President, it is difficult for him to mount a credible challenge to Halonen. Second, Vanhanen’s support seem seemed to have been eroded a lot by a significant number of Centre-party faithful considering switching their allegiance directly to Halonen. Usually, the chasm between Social Democratic and Centre Party voters cannot be bridged in either direction. Halonen may even win a majority in the most solidly Centre Party areas. Admittedly, his 50th birthday in November did bring him abundant positive publicity, but Vanhanen has also been hobbled by events in his private life.\n\nNiinistö's vigorous campaign\n\nThe third surprise is Sauli Niinistö, the candidate of the National Coalition Party, which is now in opposition. Niinistö, who is currently serving as one of the vice-chairmen of the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg, launched a vigorous campaign ahead of the others. As he has been out of Finnish domestic politics for a few years, he has assumed the role of outsider and challenger in the election campaign.\n\nNiinistö ran second in the autumn opinion polls with 20 per cent popular support. In one poll he fell behind Vanhanen. The figure is close to the proportion of the electorate that has generally voted in other elections for the National Coalition, his party. This suggests that the Coalition might at least not lose so many voters to Halonen as the Centre Party. Niinistö's disadvantage is that as a man he cannot challenge Halonen too aggressively.\n\nAnyway, it seems clear that Halonen will pull in women voters in particular across party lines.\n\nNiinistö began his campaign with a high-impact ad that referred to him as the ‘workers president’ thereby invading Halonen’s turf. (Halonen was originally nominated by the Social Democrats). The Left Alliance, successor to the Communist Party, is also safely on the Halonen bandwagon. Last spring, the SAK (The Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions), the largest trade union federation in Finland, announced its support for Halonen’s re-election, thereby unleashing a storm of criticism. This was the first such endorsement ever made by the organisation.\n\nTV debates crucial\n\nAlthough American-style continuous campaigning has now caught on in Finland, the campaigns proper are short here. Despite having received campaign subsidies from central government coffers for the first time, the parties cannot afford long campaigns. For instance, election advertising on television is still fairly limited in Finland.\n\nBut a crucial role is played by television debates, arranged by television channels, and by events organised for individual candidates across the country. In the 2000 campaign, TV debates raised Halonen and former Prime Minister Esko Aho, who lost to her, above the other contenders. This time the greatest excitement stems from whether Niinistö and Vanhanen will be able to shake Halonen’s position or whether one of the top candidates will make a blunder.\n\nHalonen’s re-election has also attracted international backing. American talk-show host Conan O’Brien displayed a picture of Halonen and himself side by side on his programme, which is popular in Finland. The resemblance between them was striking, including their carrot-coloured hair. O’Brien announced his support for Halonen and a TV spot backing Halonen was included in episodes shown in Finland. A campaign slogan “Our support group is growing. Join us” was part of the ad, as was Halonen’s campaign website address.\n\nCampaign books about the three main candidates have been published this autumn. They collect money for campaign war chests and also bring out the human sides of the candidates. The book Yksi meistä (One of us) tells of an episode in which President Halonen attended the celebrations in Moscow’s Red Square marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Finland fought alongside Germany against the Soviet Union.\n\nThe book explains how tears came to Tarja’s eyes when Russian troops dressed in World War II combat uniforms marched past shouting “Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!” in unison. Halonen was born during the war, on Christmas Eve 1943. “Our fathers heard that cry,” she whispered to her husband."
