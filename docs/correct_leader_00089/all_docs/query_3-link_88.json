        "text": "Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi today had a 90-minute meeting in Helsinki with the Prime Minister of Finland, Matti Vanhanen on bilateral relations and illegal immigration.\n\nAt the end of the meeting Mr Vanhanen said that his country now had greater awareness of the immigration issue and would consider its position on the EU's pilot project for burden sharing.\n\nDr Gonzi said that yesterday's EU decision to set up its Asylum Support Office in Malta was further evidence that Malta was managing to get across its message on immigration.\n\nHe noted that Finland had been among the countries which backed the bid for the Office to be set up in Malta.\n\nThe two sides also discussed bilateral relations, which Dr Gonzi described as being good, but with potential for further improvement.\n\nDr Gonzi earlier had a meeting with the President of Finland, Tarja Halonen.\n\nHe will tomorrow have a meeting in Latvia with Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis.\n\nDr Gonzi is accompanied by Resources Minister George Pullicino."
