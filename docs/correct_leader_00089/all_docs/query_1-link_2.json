        "text": "The March 2007 elections came on the heels of the country's presidency of the European Union from July to December 2006. As a result the election campaign started late compared to previous ones. In the last elections held in March 2003 the Centre Party (KESK) led by Ms. Anneli JÃ¤Ã¤tteenmÃ¤ki had won 55 seats. She was subsequently elected as the first female prime minister of the country and formed a centre-left coalition government with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) of former prime minister Paavo Lipponen (which took 53 seats) and the Swedish People's Party (eight seats). The main opposition National Coalition Party (KOK) a moderate conservative party took 40 seats while the remainder of seats was won by small parties.\n\nIn June 2003 Ms. JÃ¤Ã¤tteenmÃ¤ki resigned after allegations surfaced of having illegally obtained confidential documents on the Iraq war which she used in the 2003 election campaign. Mr. Matti Vanhanen (KESK) took over as Prime Minister. His government enjoyed wide popularity mainly because of high economic growth approaching six per cent in 2006 and a 7.7 per cent unemployment rate the lowest in 15 years.\n\nIn the 2007 elections 1 205 men and 799 women were vying for the 200 seats in the parliament.\n\nAs in previous elections employment and taxation were the main issues in the 2007 elections. Prime Minister Vanhanen pledged to reduce VAT on food. The SDP said the VAT reduction must apply to ordinary goods so as to help people with the most modest and average incomes. The KOK led by a 36-year-old new leader Mr. Jyrki Katainen pledged to cut the income tax of people with small and medium incomes. The SDP leader Mr. Eero HeinÃ¤luoma criticized the KESK for campaigning for the establishment of a \"non-socialist\" government comprising the KESK and the KOK.\n\nThe Swedish People's Party representing the Swedish minority in Finland promised to reform energy taxes in order to bring about more environment-friendly policies. The Left Alliance and the Green League hinted at a possible tax increase to provide better public services. The True Finns known for its EU-skeptic policies also fielded candidates.\n\nOnly 65.02 per cent of the country's 4.2 million registered voters turned out at the polls the lowest post-war figure for general elections.\n\nThe biggest winner in the 2007 elections was the KOK which gained ten more seats winning 50 in all. Former KOK leader Sauli NiinistÃ¶ was re-elected with over 60 000 votes or 10 per cent of the party's votes nationwide. The KESK remained the largest party in the parliament by winning 51 seats although it lost four. The SDP lost eight seats winning 45 reportedly suffering from the low turnout. The SDP lost its position as the country's second largest party for the first time since 1962.\n\nThe 2007 elections saw a record number of women elected to office - 84 nine more than in the previous elections. The number of MPs in their sixties almost doubled (32) while that of those in their thirties dropped to two (both from the Green League) down from four in the 2003 elections.\n\nPresident Tarja Halonen opened the new parliament on 28 March 2007.\n\nOn 15 April the KESK the KOK the Green League and the Swedish People's Party agreed to form a new government. On 17 April parliament re-elected Mr. Matti Vanhanen (KESK) as Prime Minister with 121 votes. His 20-member cabinet announced on 19 April included 12 women (60 per cent) a record high in the world.\n\nOn 24 April Mr. Sauli NiinistÃ¶ (KOK) was elected as the new Speaker.\n\nNote on the \"Election Results\":\n\nThe statistics above include overseas voting. In all 208 887 Fins abroad were registered to vote. Turnout in Finland was 67.9 % (2 772 799 of the 4 083 549 registered voters turned out at the polls)."
