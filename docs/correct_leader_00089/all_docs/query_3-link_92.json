        "text": "Prince of darkness\n\nFor some in the European Parliament, Klaus Welle is the “prince of darkness”, for others he is “the most talented political strategist I have ever come across”. Whether you revere or distrust this 43-year-old German civil servant, there is agreement that Welle is one of the most influential figures in the European Parliament.\n\nGetting the votes right\n\nThe Council of Ministers should consider a compromise between the Nice and constitutional treaties to get its votes right, say Werner Kirsch, Wojciech Słomczynski and Karol Zyczkowski.\n\nEU states find common ground in World Bank’s Wolfowitz crisis\n\nThe current crisis facing the World Bank over its President Paul Wolfowitz has brought into sharp focus the role the EU and its members states play in the organisation.\n\nThe world waits for Europe to lead\n\nThe Times of Oman published a special supplement on 6 April to mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome under the title ‘The Quiet Superpower’. It led with the assertion that while critics say that the EU has “one foot in the grave”, many countries look to Europe and not to America as a model.\n\nLife is sweet for Sweden without the euro\n\nLife is good without the euro. So much so that Sweden should not be in any hurry to get into the eurozone, Sweden’s Finance Minister Anders Borg said recently.\n\nDear La Poste, competition on letters is nothing to fear\n\nLike several other EU countries, France is reluctant to give up its postal monopoly. It would have been interesting to know the opinion of the presidential candidates.\n\nContra diplomat: John Negroponte\n\nThose shaking their heads about US foreign policy in recent years should have a look at who has been running it. Current Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was an academic and expert in Soviet theory at Stanford University before being called to the US capital. Her predecessor was a career soldier, namely Colin Powell.\n\nLegacy costs hit GM and Ford where it hurts\n\nTHIS week US carmaking giant General Motors ceded its place as the world’s largest auto manufacturer to Japan’s Toyota. The change in ranking marks the end of GM’s 76-year run as global leader in the car and truck business.\n\nSmart alecs flushed out as dollar goes down pan\n\nAny chief executive of a European company which faces international competition at home or abroad who has not been preparing for the US dollar to fall sharply this year should be fired. The key question facing business and economic policymakers today is will the decline in the dollar – it hit a 26-year low against the once forlorn pound last week (18 April) – be orderly, or will the greenback pancake?\n\nPreventing accidents – a smart approach\n\nIn less than two weeks’ time, leading figures from the European car industry and Viviane Reding, the European commissioner for the information society, will attend the launch of an awareness campaign for Electronic Stability Control (ESC).\n\nEU-US summit faces climate-change deadlock\n\nEfforts to forge a common EU-US strategy on climate change at next week’s summit have all but failed, with Washington insisting that the issue be discussed in the context of energy security.\n\nGermany calls for help in Lebanon border mission\n\nGermany has called for other EU member states to help expand its border monitoring mission in Lebanon, in what could be the first step towards a full-scale EU mission.\n\nUS must exorcise the climate-change ghost\n\nThe leaders of the EU and of the US will pledge to create a transatlantic market without barriers when they meet in Washington next week (30 April). German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and US President George W. Bush will make a high-profile announcement that they will deepen co-operation between the world’s two biggest economies.\n\nEU-US plan sherpas for economic relations\n\nThe EU and the US would each appoint a senior-level official to manage transatlantic economic relations, according to plans being drawn up for the EU-US summit on 30 April.\n\nFrance never had it so good\n\nMost of the well-earned criticism directed at Nicolas Sarkozy and Ségolène Royal, the leading candidates in France’s presidential elections, not least from this newspaper, has tended to assume that both candidates have been knowingly cynical in their attacks on various aspects of the European Union and its policies. They have taken pot-shots at institutions they cannot alter and advocated solutions quite at odds with the Union’s policies and rules. They have been changing reality, as Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquín Almunia rather bravely volunteered, “for the brief benefit of more or less demagogic arguments”. Without any apparent shame or embarrassment, they have been opportunistically playing in the sandbox of dissatisfaction with the EU unveiled by the 2005 referendum in France.\n\nBlair to clinch deal on constitution before quitting\n\nTony Blair wants to bid farewell to the European Union with a deal on a slimmed down constitution. In an interview, Blair says that the legacy of his premiership is that Britain is less isolated in the EU. Read the full interview\n\nCommission calls on EU to join space race\n\nEurope will put its status as a space power at risk unless it increases spending on the sector and member states pool their resources, according to a draft of the EU’s first comprehensive space strategy, which will be unveiled later this month.\n\nMEPs to ask US Congress for data-transfer details\n\nMEPs are hoping that a meeting with members of the US Congress in Washington, DC, next week (17 April) will reveal details of how negotiations are progressing on the transfer of European citizens’ data for counter-terrorism purposes.\n\nLajcák in the lead for Balkan top job\n\nMiroslav Lajcák, the former EU envoy to Montenegro, has emerged as the front-runner to become the international community’s powerful proconsul in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSpicing up the debate on globalisation\n\nLast week a study from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that globalisation “has reduced the labour share of income in advanced countries”, though the impact on ‘Anglo-Saxon’ economies with flexible labour markets, such as the US and Britain, was smaller.\n\nThe Namesake\n\nIreland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern, a senior Cabinet minister now for a decade, is a man who wants to be Prime Minister. In fact, he very, very much wants to be prime minister. His ambition, which can sometimes lie only clumsily hidden, may soon come to greater prominence as Ireland begins to consider life after his namesake, but no relation, Bertie Ahern, who has held the top job since 1997.\n\nUS heads stuck in climate sands\n\nSome misguided optimists believe that the US government is undergoing a change of heart on climate change.\n\nSteinbrück won’t see bears on his safari\n\nUK Finance Minister Gordon Brown is renowned in Brussels for not turning up to meetings with his EU counterparts.\n\nFiring in all directions, or none at all?\n\nMissile defence is an issue that rears its ugly head every few years, emitting much heat and fear then dropping off again, somewhat like a dozy dragon that is prodded into a fiery roar by a crowd of buzzing insects."
