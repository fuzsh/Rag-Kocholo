In his letter to Vanhanen, Parts stated that he expects the co-operation of the Finnish prime minister to strengthen the extensive, pragmatic co-operation between the two countries even further. \"I believe there are many issues in European affairs where Estonia and Finland share a common opinion and where our common efforts will contribute to the stability, security, and competitiveness of the Baltic Sea area as well as the entire EU\", Parts stated. The prime minister also extended an invitation to the new Finnish prime minister to meet in Tallinn soon. Yours faithfully Kristi Liiva Head of Government Press Office Phone: +372 50 74162"
