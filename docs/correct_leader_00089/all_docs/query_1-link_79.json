        "text": "SDP chair Antti Rinne, 56, was sworn in as prime minister on Thursday to lead Finland's 75th government. Rinne, whose Social Democratic Party narrowly won April's election, is a former finance minister and union boss.\n\nHe was approved as the new premier by a vote of 111 to 74 in a Parliamentary session that began around noon, with Rinne serving as interim Speaker of Parliament. Fourteen of the new MPs were absent.\n\nAll the 'no' votes came from the three main opposition parties, with the sole MP from the Liike Nyt (Movement Now) group voting with the five government parties.\n\nStory continues after photo\n\nAfter the vote, Rinne and the 18 other cabinet ministers walked to the Presidential Palace to meet with President Sauli Niinistö.\n\nAt 2pm, the president approved the resignation of outgoing PM and Centre Party chair Juha Sipilä and then formally appointed Rinne as the new prime minister. The new ministers were then sworn in, using either Finnish or Swedish and either a Bible or law book, according to their own preferences.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Rinne met with Niinistö and was formally appointed to form a new government.\n\nStory continues after photo\n\nOn Friday MPs will elect the new Speaker of Parliament and two deputy speakers. The new Speaker is expected to be former Centre PM Matti Vanhanen, 63. Former minister Tuula Haatainen of the SDP is to continue as the first deputy speaker while Juho Eerola of the Finns Party will likely become the second deputy speaker.\n\nComfortable majority in Parliament\n\nRinne aims to lead a five-party centre-left coalition government for the next four years. Besides the SDP and Centre, it includes the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People's Party.\n\nThe cabinet parties have a comfortable 117-seat majority in the 200-seat Parliament.\n\nHowever they will likely face pressures from within as well as from the two main opposition parties, the right-leaning Finns Party and National Coalition Party. They each have nearly as many MPs as the SDP, wit the top three parties holding 40, 39 and 38 seats respectively. The nationalist Finns Party, led by immigration hardliner Jussi Hallo-aho, is just one seat shy of being the largest and has been leading opinion polls since the election.\n\nOne holdover from Sipilä cabinet\n\nAbout 58 percent of the ministers in Rinne's cabinet are women. That is up sharply from the previous Sipilä government, but still short of the 60 percent ratio in Vanhanen's 2007-10 cabinet.\n\nStory continues after photo\n\nThe new ministers range in age from 31 to 61. The youngest is Minister of Economic Affairs Katri Kulmuni, a second-term MP and deputy Centre Party chair from Tornio in Finnish Lapland, while the eldest is Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto, an MP, Greens chair and former minister from Helsinki.\n\nThe only minister to carry over from Sipilä's cabinet to Rinne's is Centre Party MP Annika Saarikko. She moves from being Minister of Family Affairs and Social Service to Minister of Science and Culture, a newly-renamed post that operates under the Ministry of Education.\n\nLintilä represents Centre at press conference\n\nIn the late afternoon, the new government held a brief press conference at the House of the Estates, where they had hashed out their agenda over the past month.\n\nStory continues after photo\n\nFour of the five parties were represented by their chairs, while the Centre was represented by Finance Minister Mika Lintilä. Party chair Sipilä, who is to be replaced as leader in September, declined to take a post in the new government or parliament.\n\nBesides Rinne and Haavisto, the two other party chairs in the cabinet are Anna-Maja Henriksson of the Swedish People's Party, who returns as Justice Minister, and Li Andersson of the Left Alliance, who is now Education Minister.\n\nThe ministers only answered a couple of questions about the timing of eldercare reforms and attaining their 75-percent employment target, giving rather non-committal answers. They then headed for the traditional 'class picture' photograph session and coffee reception.\n\n5:56pm: Updated throughout and corrected date of Speakers' election"
