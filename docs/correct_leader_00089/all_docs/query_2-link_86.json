        "text": "Finns Party parliamentary group ejects MP over racist tweet\n\nAs a result, the Finns Party is no longer the largest group in Parliament.\n\nThe parliamentary delegation of the opposition Finns Party (FP) decided on Thursday expel MP Ano Turtiainen from the group. The move came in response to the latest in a series of racist social media posts by Turtiainen, a Twitter message from the previous day mocking George Floyd, who was choked to death by a police officer last week in Minneapolis.\n\nSeveral criminal complaints have been filed with Finnish police over the tweet, which Turtiainen has since deleted.\n\nParliamentary group chair Ville Tavio said that Turtiainen was ejected from the delegation due to repeated inappropriate comments on social media.\n\n\"If he wants, Turtiainen can apply for re-admission to the group next year if he has permanently mended his ways,\" Tavio said after the group's meeting.\n\nApology insufficient\n\n\"Turtiainen apologised to the group for what he had done, but this time that was not enough. The decision was unanimous,\" he added.\n\nIn February, nationalist FP chair Jussi Halla-aho told Yle that there was no room for racism in his party.\n\nProfessor Suvi Keskinen, head of the Centre for Research on Ethnic Relations and Nationalism at the University of Helsinki, said that many of Turtiainen's comments on social media can be considered racist.\n\n\"Turtiainen's message is racist in that it mocks the death of a black man as a result of police violence and suggests that the life of a black person is not as valuable as that of other people,\" Keskinen told Yle.\n\nSpeaker of Parliament Matti Vanhanen, a former Centre Party PM, described Turtiainen's latest social media post as \"shocking and simply wrong from the standpoint from universal human values.\"\n\nHe said that since the post took place outside of Turtiainen's parliamentary work, \"it may fall under criminal jurisdiction…but the Parliament and the Speaker as institutions cannot unfortunately intervene in this.\"\n\nBefore being elected to Parliament, Turtiainen was fined for a Facebook post praising an attempted arson attack on a reception centre for asylum seekers.\n\nNot going to share the post obviously, but I'll describe it just so people know how disgusting it was. It was a picture of George Floyd under the cop's knee, his face photoshopped pink and with text \"Pink Floyd\". While sharing the picture he also wrote: Have you noticed how closer to \"equality\" you get, the more brawling you get.\n\nIt's been good to see that even the biggest tabloids haven't shared the picture when reporting about this, there's some standards and taste there atleast. But one another thing has made me furious, every \"apology\" from this guy has went to the party. He's said he is sorry that he hurt the party. Also the head honchos of the party have mostly talked how it's not appropriate for a politician to speak like that, rather than properly condemning him and his post. Though the chairman Halla-aho (who has his own similar issues in the past) said that the picture was very objectionable lowbrow humour and mockery of a deceased person. He also added that he didn't quite understand the accompanying text though (the one about equality).\n\nEarlier this year there was also a police report filed against Turtiainen, by Jari Taponen the head of crime prevention at the Helsinki police department. When Taponen tweeted that freedom of speech isn't limitless, but those who the speech is targeted at also have their rights and society protects them. In which Turtiainen replied to calling Taponen and people like him as dickless whiners.\n\nAnother fun fact. It was just 3 months ago when the vice-chairman of the Finns Party youth organization proudly claimed to be a facist, he was also dismissed from the party.\n\nTo end in something positive, here's few pictures from Black Lives Matter protest at Helsinki.\n\nTurtiainen has also lost some international business now in Canada and the US, he's the founder of a powerlifting equipment company. He really didn't think this through before posting, glad to see so wide reaching consequences.\n\nCPU Powerlifting on Instagram: \"The CPU Board stands for creating a safe and positive environment by making individuals aware that there is an expectation, at all times, of appropriate behaviour consistent with the CPU’s core values.
