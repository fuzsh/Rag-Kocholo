        "text": "Closing Ceremony of the Sata-Häme Soi Accordion Festival After some periods of heavy rain during the week, brilliant sunshine greeted the large crowd gathered in Festival Park for the Closing Ceremony. The festival speaker was the Prime Minister of Finland - Matti Vanhanen.\n\nIn addition, several of the guests from the weeks concerts performed, and a special award was given to Mika Väyrynen for his outstanding contributions to the development of the accordion in Finland. The festival is covered here in a pictoral essay.\n\nPrime Minister Matti Vanhanen receiving a present from festival organizer Minna Kulmala and right, the Prime Minister giving his keynote speech.\n\nThe Finnish Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen giving his speech and afterwards being\n\nthanked by festival organizer Minna Kulmala.\n\nThe Tocatta Accordion Orchestra from Sorbrance, Slovakia\n\nDirected by Juraj Libera\n\nThe Bryac Quartet from Ukraine performing, and afterwards being\n\nphotographed with the festival organizers.\n\nCIA Coupe Mondiale Champions Aleksei Peresidly and Nikolai Sivchuk\n\nSilver Accordion Champion Juuso Vesterinen\n\nGolden Accordion Champion Kaisa Kujanpää\n\nAleksei Peresidly and Nikolai Sivchuk with the Finnish Prime Minister\n\nFestival director Minna Kulmala and Music Director Kimmo Mattila gave thanks to all who had helped make the festival possible. They presented awards to people who had helped considerably during the festival by volunteering their time and effort to make sure the event went smoothly.\n\nMika Väyrynen receiving his award from Ikaalinen, Festival Director Minna Kulmala\n\nSata-Häme Soi Festival Organizers: Minna Kulmala (Director)\n\nKimmo Mattila (Musical Director) Minna Plihtari (Public Relations Manager)\n\nwith Accordions Worldwide reporter, Kevin Friedrich\n\nFestival Staff Party and Celebration\n\nThe local Ikaalinen group \"Hätävara\" formed by local musicans both students and teachers, celebrated the release of their new CD by performing for the Sata-Häme Soi Festival Staff Party.\n\nBand members are Esa Härmä, Kristiina Ihalainen, Heli Oksanen, Saana Sillanpää, Laura Tamminen, Pipsa Tuominen and Ville Mattila (son of festival music director Kimmo Mattila.)\n\nVisiting artists from the Ukraine the 'Bryac Quartet' got the party rolling and had everyone on their feet for their impromptu performance of modern dance numbers.\n\nThis party was a great opportunity to let the organizers thank the many staff for their hard work, as well as let the staff themselves that had worked so hard over the course of the festival to relax and enjoy the evening.\n\nThe celebration was held at the popular Oma Tupa. After a buffet dinner, the guests enjoyed dancing the night away with both the local staff and international guests.\n\nFinland's Nature Symbols: Six national 'nature symbols' have been chosen for Finland by popular vote and all the symbols carry powerful connotations of popular tradition, stretching back to ancient times.\n\nThey were only officially chosen in the 1980s and '90s, however, so one cannot claim they are based on any formal tradition. The aim in choosing the symbols is to draw attention to Finnish nature and wildlife and to promote appreciation of them.\n\nSymbol Number 6: The brown Bear - Ursus Arctos, is a creature of the wilds which has adapted easily to life with people. Bears are very seldom sighted, but many bears may see people every day!\n\nI am happy I didn't see one in person, but this lovely wooden carving at the Ikaalinen Street Festival gives you a idea of what it might be like to encounter one!"
