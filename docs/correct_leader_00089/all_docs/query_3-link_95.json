        "text": "Distinguished war veterans, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour for me to give my first speech as a defence minister to you.\n\nI find it especially significant that my first appearance is in Ostrobothnia, which traditionally represents the stronghold of national defence in Finland.\n\nIt is suitable on the National War Veteran Day to remind us of the highly tense international situation that prevailed before the Winter War and the Continuation War. Our chances to survive imminent wars as a sovereign nation did not seem promising. The prospect of the outbreak of the Winter War in 1939 and, later, of the large-scale Soviet offensive in summer 1944 could have led to utter despair but your generation had the strength to believe in a better future and you endured.\n\nAt the beginning of my speech I want to pass on to you the deep appreciation that younger generations feel for your heroic deeds during the wars - as a result we live today in an independent country. Your sacrifices are highly appreciated. Finland is a good and safe country to live in - thanks to you.\n\nThe new Government started its term of office in April. The programme published on 17 April states that the Government develops the Defence Forces and national defence as has been laid down in the Reports to Parliament. The most recent Report was submitted in 2001 and the next one is scheduled for 2004. This procedure allows us to observe our security environment on a long-term basis and to make well-balanced decisions while taking into consideration national interests. Traditionally, thorough consideration, stability and continuity are key elements in our security policy.\n\nAccording to the Government programme, new types of risks and threats will be taken into account in national contingency planning and development of national defence. Planning and development underline the significance of national emergency supply, civil defence, protection of information systems and capabilities of communications. Also environmental damage and other threats of major catastrophes are taken into account in contingency planning. All the mentioned elements call for a comprehensive approach between ministries when the new Report on Security and Defence Policy is prepared.\n\nDistinguished war veterans,\n\nas was stated in the Government programme, the status and regular rehabilitation of war veterans and war-disabled will be improved. The Government is going to make a plan, which incorporates measures of different administrative branches to make preparations in a view of the growing number of the elderly. The primary goal is to provide support so that the elderly can live at home longer. This naturally applies to the war veterans, too. A special focus is on improving health care and the care for the aged. The number of staff in the welfare for the aged will be increased, the status of carers of elderly relatives will be improved and state subsidies to municipalities will be enhanced so that municipalities are able to meet the requirements.\n\nI believe that the connection between defence administration and war veteran organisations remains close and ensures that the views of our veterans will be taken into consideration also in developing national defence. I can assure you that also in the future our choices in security policy will be made in a spirit that honours the legacy and ideas of the war veterans - the free and independent Finland.\n\nDistinguished war veterans,\n\nI wish you all a very special day today."
