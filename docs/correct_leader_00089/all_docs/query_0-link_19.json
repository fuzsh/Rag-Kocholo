        "text": "(Check against delivery)\n\nDear Honorary Consul Okuda,\n\nMembers of the Kansai-Finland Society,\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nMy visit to Japan, my second visit here, began only a few hours ago which means that this is my very first meal on Japanese soil during this trip. I am absolutely delighted that it takes place in Kyoto, the ancient capital city of Japan, famous for its beauty and cultural heritage. Besides delicious food, I have already had the pleasure of lively discussions and exchange of views on various mutually interesting subjects.\n\nAlthough there are differences between our countries - the geographical location, the language, the size of the population and so on - I would rather like to emphasise the similarities: our people have an almost identical living standard. Both nations are facing the challenge of ageing population. We also seem to have a strong emotional contact with nature and a surprisingly similar aesthetic taste -- be it about visual arts, fashion or music. And actually we are almost neighbours! -- there is only one country between us.\n\nIt can be said without hesitation that the political relations between Finland and Japan are not only good but excellent. In developing these relations, the Kansai Japan-Finland society has played an important role in the course of its 29 years of existence. The society promotes an active annual cultural exchange programme between Japan and Finland. In Finland we are particularly grateful for the chairman of the society and the former grand master of the Urasenken tea school, Dr. Genshitsu Sen, for the generous donation of a genuine Japanese tea-room to Suomenlinna.\n\nIn the beginning of the previous decade, in 1990, there were just two weekly flights between Japan and Finland -- now there are about 15 non-stop flights a week. For air and train transportation, Finland is the first entry point from Japan to the European Union and to North-Western Russia, a true gateway. Today the destinations in Japan include Narita, Osaka and Nagoya. This illustrates very well the growth and the increased intensity of contacts between our countries.\n\nIt is hardly an exaggeration to say that our relations in both the private and public sector are flourishing at the moment. The potential opportunities for Finnish companies and the Japanese business community to establish new networks as well as to strengthen already existing relations have reached new heights.\n\nNext year the Kansai-Finland society will celebrate its 30th anniversary and it will also be the 90th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Finland and Japan.\n\nBy raising my glass to thank for this wonderful dinner, I wish long life and vitality for the Kansai-Finland society and equally to the ever-warming relations between our countries!"
