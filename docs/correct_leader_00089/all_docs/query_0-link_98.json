        "text": "'Let me introduce you to the sexiest man in Finland.\" With these words, the French president Jacques Chirac guided the Spanish leader José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero into a top-level international summit this weekend. The object of his remark was not a rock or sport star, not the lead singer of Eurovision winners Lordi, nor racing driver Kimi Raikkonen. It was Finland's 50-year-old prime minister, Matti Vanhanen. And Chirac was not lying.\n\nHe may dress like a bureaucrat - he wears boring two-piece suits, severe rectangular glasses and the straightest haircut in Christendom - but Vanhanen is a Finnish sex bomb. Voted the sexiest man of 2005 by readers of the women's weekly Eeva, his love life is a subject of speculation in the press. But Bill Clinton he ain't. \"Our readers saw him as calm, safe, basic,\" says an editor at Eeva. \"He's an ordinary Finnish man and that's something that is attractive to Finnish women.\"\n\nIt really seems that if you want to score in the land of Nokia and saunas, you have to be a regular Joe (or Jari). Despite rumours that he was dating a former Miss Finland - now, coincidentally, a member of his cabinet as culture minister - Vanhanen has always denied an affair.\n\nEverything that is said about Vanhanen is that he is a safe, boring guy. \"Vanhanen is honest and he takes his work seriously. People in Finland respect that a lot,\" says a journalist at a national daily. \"Personally, he's not to my taste, but I guess attraction is in the eye of the beholder.\" Another writer, meanwhile, speaks more warmly (though off the record - Finland is a small place): \"He's tall. He has dimples on his cheeks when he laughs. And I guess power makes men very sexy,\" she says.\n\nA father of two, Vanhanen was divorced from his wife last year and is now going out with a single mother he met at Ikea. Apparently, Susan Kuronen was struggling to get a heavy item off a shelf, until the gentlemanly premier flew to her rescue. They appeared together for the first time this summer at a fair in a small rural town. In many ways, it seems, Vanhanen is living proof that it is always the quiet ones who get the girls.\n\nWhich brings us back to Chirac. Speculation suggests that he made his flattering observation in an attempt to make up for his past gaffes against the Finns. Last year, he said Finland had the worst food in the world and, just last week, he was reported as describing the Finnish foreign minister as incompetent (a comment Chirac's office denied). This week, when not describing Vanhanen as a stud, Chirac has been busy kissing the hand of the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen. But given the Finns' propensity for the down-to-earth, it seems unlikely to get him anywhere. \"Finns don't like flashy personalities,\" says one of the journalists. \"Chirac would never be successful here\"."
