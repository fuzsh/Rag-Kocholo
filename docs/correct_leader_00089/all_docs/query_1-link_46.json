        "text": "The most burning question in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Finland is which party will emerge as the biggest , the Centre Party or the Social Democrats (SDP)? The outcome will determine whether the next Prime Minister is Matti Vanhanen of the Centre Party or Eero Heinäluoma of the SDP, writes Kyösti Karvonen, Managing Editor of the newspaper Kaleva.\n\nWhen Finns aged 18 or more go to the polls on Sunday, March 18, it will not be just another day in the history of the country's democracy. The date will mark almost exactly 100 years since March 15-16, 1907, when the first elections ever were held in which all Finns over the age of 24 were entitled to vote and to stand for office.\n\nUniversal suffrage was a huge development, especially for Finland's women. With this radical reform they became the first women in Europe to gain the vote. It was a great change for Finland's men, too, since most of them had not been entitled to vote or stand for office previously either, not being members of the four Estates.\n\nThe unicameral 200-member parliament elected in spring 1907 included 19 women. Since then, the percentage of women in the legislature has increased steadily, and the parliament approaching the end of its present term includes 76 women - over a third of the members. There is no longer a single high government office in Finland that has never been held by a woman.\n\nNo major causes of discontent\n\nThe celebratory nature of the elections does not mean that they will not be for real. The result of the elections will determine how easy -or difficult - it will be to form the next government. Because Finland does not have a simple two-party system, the winner in parliamentary elections (i.e.the party that wins the most seats in parliament) does not automatically form a government, nor do the less successful parties automatically end up in the opposition.\n\nTwo of the three largest parties are always needed to form a majority government, and accordingly the new government may well be formed by winner and loser together. Because of this dependence on the three dominant parties, Finland's domestic politics are very stable and predictable. This stability is strengthened by the fact that governments usually include parties from both sides of the political divide. That is the crucial reason why Finland's domestic politics operate very differently from those of neighbouring Sweden.\n\nThe key question in the elections is which party will win most seats in parliament. The chairman of that party will have priority in opening talks on the formation of a government and will very probably be chosen by parliament to be Prime Minister for the new four-year electoral period.\n\nFinland's second EU Presidency, which ended on the last day of 2006, had the effect of postponing campaigning for the parliamentary elections until now, and also toned down domestic politicking.\n\nIndeed, the campaign may turn out to be relatively subdued up to the end. This may be inferred from the fact that the parliamentary debate on this year's budget towards the end of 2006 was unusually amicable, even though elections were only a few months away. Another factor that restrained electioneering was the assertion by the major parties, well in advance, that the issue of NATO membership would not be brought up seriously in the electoral period soon to begin. These elections will thus not be about NATO.\n\nMoreover, the Finnish economy grew briskly, by about 6%, last year. Official figures put unemployment lower now than at any point in the past 15 years, and taxation has been eased. . Hence there are no causes of discontent among the people of Finland big enough to awaken calls for profound political change."
