A relationship that dates back 90 years is quite a long history. It is my wish that our cooperative relations will continue as we go forward.\"\n\nAt the joint press conference that followed, Prime Minister Fukuda said, \"Prime Minister Vanhanen and I exchanged a wide range of opinions on international aspects of Japan-Finland bilateral relations.
