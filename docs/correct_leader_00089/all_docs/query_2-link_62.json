        "text": "Ted (technology, entertainment and design) talks were conceived on the notion that radical ideas can change the world. The same could be said to be true of innovative ideas in government. Integrating policy across government could transform the way it is delivered.\n\nLocal councils, central government and non-departmental public bodies each hold duplicated policy. A common policy framework could cut through this duplication â€“ Scotland and Finland are two good examples of where integrated approach has shown results.\n\nIn the case of Scotland, from the outset the devolved government was adamant it wished to move from the departmentalism that had characterised Whitehall to a unified cross-departmental identity. This was achieved by matching minsters to policy rather than departments. While it's recognised that Scotland had the advantage of redesigning the relational lines between local and national government from scratch, inspiration can be drawn from the fact that there are alternatives to the status quo.\n\nIn Finland, the Matti Vanhanen government, troubled by the fragmentation of state institutions, set about making horizontal government a key part of their civil service reform programme. In practical terms, this meant the administration had to reduce its priorities to a small number of cross-cutting policy areas assigned to minsters and civil servants. This contributed to more coherence across departments, which have largely been cited as making Finland a world leader in integrated government.\n\nThe questions is then: how could these principles of integration work for the UK?\n\nCurrent organisational and institutional structures within Whitehall require policy to fall neatly into departmental silos. However, the problems governments face are rarely so clear cut, which requires a co-ordinated approach across a number of Whitehall departments and agencies. There is a case to be made that ministerial portfolios and budgets, traditionally linked to any one Whitehall department, should instead be linked to policy portfolios that span multi-ministry or departmental lines.\n\nThere would also need to be an infrastructure and framework that would bring a redesign of the civil service to life. Working in a joined up way does not lend itself well to the vertical accountability models historically found within the public sector.\n\nA move to horizontal government would need to allow for further changes in terms of responsibilities, accountabilities and relationships between strands of government. Arm's length agencies, such as the Highways Agency, historically siphoned off to provide a narrow spectrum of state functions, should be included in the conversation and made accountable for how broader government policy is delivered. Inter-agency task forces complemented by cross-departmental committees would also play a role in monitoring accountability.\n\nWhile an accompanying cultural change would need to be embedded over time, adjusting current job descriptions to take account of boundary-spanning roles would be a first step in this process.\n\nThere are examples of where policy is already being integrated across all levels of government. This includes green and environmental policy targets and strands of public administration. In addition, there are attempts to co-ordinate health at NHS (national) level, NHS primary care trusts (regional) level, and the delivery of personal by local authorities.\n\nTo ensure success, common ground needs to be found between different levels of government and the bringing together of shared targets and objectives with bespoke, and fair actions for each player.\n\nThe vision for this idea is to build intra-state relationships between those involved in delivering local services to those at the centre of government, while linking these to the distinct identities of non-governmental agencies."
