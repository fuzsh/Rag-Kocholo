        "text": "(check against delivery)\n\nDear Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\nIt is a great pleasure to speak at this Innovation Day. I feel privileged to be here with you. Innovation is a crucial topic today. However, I somehow feel that I should be the one listening to you, rather than you listening to me.\n\nI understand that this Innovation Day has become an annual event. In Finland we have an annual Information Security Day since 2003, which brings together business, regulators and government to focus on improving data security. This is about promoting secure internet use by emphasising user responsibility and taking adequate safeguards. Internet is an important everyday tool for all of us and we want to keep it safe.\n\nFinland currently holds the Presidency of the European Union. Innovation is a major priority for our Presidency. Europe needs innovation to stay competitive and I think we need to take a hard look at European innovation policy. We need to do more and get better results.\n\nFinland takes innovation very seriously. As Prime Minister, I chair the Science and Technology Policy Council, which brings together government, business and academia. Its main task is to review Finnish science and technology policy and I think that we benefit from having a direct business input into this policy discussion.\n\nAs Prime Minister, I also personally lead the Finnish government’s Information Society Programme, which promotes the use of IT in developing Finnish society and government. Innovation is high on our political agenda, both for Finland and for the EU. And my close personal involvement, as Prime Minister, sends a strong signal that innovation and development of the information society are important priorities for government.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nInnovation is really the key issue for European competitiveness. European prosperity has always relied on innovation and, in the past, Europe had a reputation for being at the cutting edge of technological development. However, we need to recognise that others have overtaken us – first the United States and more recently Asia. Europe needs to take innovation policy seriously if we are to prosper in the future.\n\nI recently saw a global survey of R&D spending by companies. Of the top ten companies in terms of R&D, only three were from Europe. I believe that Microsoft was number five on that list. Among the top fifty, only 17 companies were from the EU. These are not good results for a region that is supposed to become the most competitive in the world by 2010.\n\nAt the same time it is encouraging – for a Finnish Prime Minister – that Finland, a nation of five million people, features among the top ten R&D countries. However, I don’t think that this has much to do with Finnish excellence. It is rather that other countries and companies are under-investing in R&D.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nEurope is not innovation poor, but we have a real European paradox – we invest substantially in education and R&D spending is increasing but, for some reason, the investment does not translate into successful companies, new products and good jobs. This is the problem which European innovation policy must address.\n\nI strongly believe that Europe needs an innovation policy that is more company-driven. And we in government should focus on removing barriers to innovation. Creating the right market conditions is the key to improving Europe’s innovation potential. There is no sense in increasing R&D spending if the market conditions are not conducive to innovation, and good for business. Europe needs to take a critical look at these market conditions – and this includes issues that have nothing to do with science and technology: issues such as taxation, bankruptcy legislation and risk capital, for example.\n\nWe also need to remember that Europe’s best underlying competitive strength is the single market and the competition it entails. Without this common European market, our companies would be lame ducks in a globalising world. The European Union needs to take the single market further, especially in services.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nThis October, we had a Summit meeting in Lahti between EU leaders. We had a good discussion about innovation. Innovation policy is an ongoing process and its scope needs to be very wide. At Lahti we touched on a few key issues, mainly intellectual property rights, standards, technology platforms and the European Institute of Technology.\n\nFirst and foremost, Europe needs a more efficient and Europe-wide policy on intellectual property rights. We need to make the European patent system more cost-effective and reliable without compromising quality. We haven’t been able to agree on the Community patent, but we could proceed with the London Protocol, which would simplify patent procedures. We also need to improve the litigation system by developing the European Patent Litigation Agreement.\n\nWe should also look at the way we set European standards. The process is too slow, which means that standards are usually set by others. We have one European success story – mobile telephony, where the GSM standard has become a successful global standard, a leader in its field – but there are few others.\n\nR&D in Europe is too fragmented. By pooling efforts, technology platforms provide a new way to achieve a critical mass, so to speak. Many European companies have chosen to cooperate in given areas – from nanotechnology to embedded systems – and at EU-level these platforms can be transformed into Joint Technology Initiatives, eligible for funding from the 7th Framework Program on Research. I am very pleased that one of these technology platforms – Artemis, which focuses on embedded systems – has received a strong endorsement from the Commission and will go ahead as the first Joint Technology Initiative.\n\nTechnology platforms may sound very boring, nerdy and technical, but today I know I have an audience that can see beyond that. Technology platforms are a practical, new way of improving our research performance and making the whole process more private-sector driven, which has been one great weakness in European innovation policy. With technology platforms, it is companies – not civil servants or committees – that identify promising areas. Of course, companies need to put money on the table, but it will be matched by public funding from the EU and national sources. Technology platforms are public-private partnership at its best.\n\nTo sum up the challenges facing Europe in terms of innovation policy, I would say that we need to make Europe more innovation friendly and encourage the private sector to innovate by making structural reforms.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nAs I said at the beginning, innovation is high on the Finnish government’s agenda. Innovation and R&D in Europe need to be more business-driven, and geared more toward the private sector. Europe has a history of heavy government and we need to identify a useful, value-added role for government.\n\nI am not proposing a full and comprehensive list of what governments should be doing on innovation and what the big challenges are, but from my own experience in government, I would like to make a few suggestions and remarks.\n\nFirst, regulation is the core business of government. Issues like competition rules are very important.\n\nDemanding regulation can also spur companies into becoming more efficient, as we have witnessed in Finland with the telecommunications sector.\n\nSecond, education matters very much. A high-standard and universal education is important for innovation, especially in an age when everyone needs IT skills for their job, whether they are farmers or professors.\n\nThird, an ageing population is a real challenge for Europe. We need to be able to do more with fewer people, and this is where information technology and innovation can really help. Innovation is not only about new better machines and products. It is also about changes in the way we do things.\n\nFourth, government can also promote the use of IT and create a demand for innovation through its own activities – in public procurement, for example.\n\nFifth, the public sector still needs to be active in financing research and development, especially basic research. This is the foundation for innovation, on which businesses can build their innovation work.\n\nThe EU has set the target that all member states should devote at least 3 % of their GDP to research and development. If we were to reach this target, this would mean an increase of about 100 billion euros per year. I am convinced that this would generate a huge amount of new innovations and also research jobs in Europe. Spending in R&D is really about investing in our future.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen,\n\nDuring the Finnish EU Presidency I have put great emphasis on developing cooperation between the EU and rapidly developing Asian economies. However, we also need to make a sustained effort to combat poverty in the world at large. Sustainable development can be advanced by developing simple and robust technologies that can be easily deployed and put to good use in the Asian and African countryside. With new technology, we can bring a better life to the poor and give them a fair chance to improve their livelihoods. This is the real challenge.\n\nThank you."
