        "text": "Colonel Erik Erroll is a recent appointment to the position of head of the Department of Strategic and Defence Studies at the Finnish National Defence University in Helsinki. He came from a post as Defence Attaché in Stockholm, a position he held between 2005 and 2008.\n\n\"I have also been Chief of Staff at the Uusimaa (Nyland) Brigade, in addition to having worked at the Ministry of Defence,\" he tells us as we meet up at his office in the Kronohagen district of Helsinki.\n\nDid the events in Georgia come as a surprise to the Finnish Defence Forces?\n\n\"Altering European borders by force of arms, in the twenty-first century, is a surprising turn of events\"\n\nDid you predict that it could happen...?\n\n\"Our defence policy is the answer to that question. We have held on to a national defence doctrine.\"\n\nErik Erroll emphasises that the Finnish Defence Forces' primary task is to guard and defend Finland and her territory.\n\n\"The equipment and competencies that we posses within the Defence Forces also have to be made available to other public authorities, the police and so on.\"\n\n\"Our international obligations come are priority number three. The Government has the ambition of keeping a thousand Finnish soldiers on international duty.\"\n\n\"History has taught us\"\n\nPrevious experience, and geopolitical realities, naturally play a critical role in forming the Finnish way of thinking.\n\n\"History has taught us that the unexpected can occur, and in such times the Armed Forces are the tool we need to meet any existential threats. The Finnish Defence Force is well known to posses a sophisticated ability to asses developments concerning the mighty neighbour to the East.”\n\nErrol points out that note was made of security concerns regarding the Caucasus region and the Far East as early as the review, undertaken by the then government, of security and defence policy of 1997. He argues that Russian operations in Georgia confirm the validity of the Finnish defence policy.\n\n\"We have a vast area requiring defence and it is as a result of our history that we have a strong artillery offering ballistic support to our troops.\"\n\n80% of a year\n\nGeneral conscription will also continue as before.\n\n\"It's most cost effective and has served us well. We train 25,000 soldiers a year and that's around 80% of any particular year performing National Service.\"\n\nIn this way, nearly all Finnish citizens come into contact personally with the Armed Forces. \"What's your perspective on the Swedish decision to discontinue military exchanges and cooperation with Russia? Could Finland consider taking the same step?\n\n\"We wouldn't have any problems taking part in a common EU initiative along those lines. But, otherwise, no, I don't think so.\"\n\n\"We have a carefully calibrated programme of co-operation with Russia, for example we do not engage in any joint exercises, and I think it's worth keeping to that. Whatever occurs, we have to be able to keep open lines of communication with our neighbour.\"\n\nIncrease last year\n\nColonel Erik Errol notes that Finland, as regards materiel, is largely NATO compliant. Last year the Finnish Defence Forces received a budgetary increase of around eight percent to a level of circa 2,400 million euro, and the budget was pegged at the same total this year.\n\n\"The issue of resources had been raised long before the events in Georgia. We have many weapon systems that are to be phased out over the next decade or so. Nordic initiatives, like the one presented in the summer by the defence chiefs of Finland, Sweden and Norway, are excellent.\" Errol argues.\n\n\"Collaboration on international on operations can be further developed. The Nordic rapid reaction force was certainly one of the EU's best, but it had a motley selection of equipment which could have a caused a logistic nightmare in a 'live' situation.\"\n\n\"… a positive factor for security\"\n\nWhat can the Nordic countries do at home?\n\n\"One could, for example, extend co-operation regarding specialist training, like naval mine disposal. Swedish and Finnish officers use the same system, so training together is possible.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of empty flying space up in the north. We fly different aircraft and employ somewhat different tactics, so some extremely valuable exercises could be arranged. Together we form a large fighting force and certainly do not need to be modest on that point. Norway, Sweden and Finland have together around 300 combat aircraft. A jointly trained resource like that is definitely to be counted as a positive factor as regards our security.\"\n\nAfter spending three years in Sweden, Erik Errol sees more similarities than differences between the two countries.\n\n\"Sweden has enjoyed a high international profile. But in the Defence Commission's report from 2007 there was a unmistakeable focus on the areas nearest to Sweden and the Baltic Sea region.\"\n\n\"NATO … in the long term\"\n\nErroll does not believe that the Georgian crisis has had a serious effect on the climate of debate in Finland. He does, however, predict that Finland will one day come knocking on the door of NATO.\n\n\"Developments since the end of the Cold War have, step by step, led to an ever deeper integration with the West. We are members of the EU, in the monetary union and even contribute to the development of the EU's military capabilities.\"\n\n\"The EU, however, is only concerned with crisis management and, in the long term, I think it would be odd if we didn't participate in the basic security collaboration that NATO offers.\"\n\nBy Sören Viktorsson\n\nPhotography by Kjell Fredriksson\n\n\"Finland is not defended by anyone other than Finland herself ...\""
