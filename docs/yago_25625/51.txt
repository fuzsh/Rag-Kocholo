Critical Reception[]

Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times said: "Watching this film is like eavesdropping on bright children and observing the process by which their intelligence builds their personalities, their beliefs, their strategies and their minds."

The Austin Chronicle praised Victoire Thivisol's performance, writing: "The naturalism and expressiveness of this child as she moves through a host of difficult emotions is more like experiencing the unabashed realism of a fragile soul bared than the witnessing of a great performance."

Keith Phipps from The A.V. Club wrote: "Director Jacques Doillon's almost documentary-like film is strongest when almost fully immersed in the psyche of [Victoire] Thivisol's mournful character. Though her elaborate, incompatible religious fantasies of reunion—never depicted through any means other than dialogue—follow no recognizable logic, the film, due largely to four-year-old Thivisol's remarkable performance, makes them thoroughly, painfully believable, making its magic-realism finale seem like something like a cop-out."

James Berardinelli from ReelViews said: "From start to finish, [Victoire] Thivisol is nothing short of amazing. This is the kind of portrayal that would be labeled as a standout from an actor of any age, but from someone who's only four, it's astonishing."
