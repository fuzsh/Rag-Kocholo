Thomas insists on bringing his friend Juliette, a girl of his own age with whom he enjoys a close platonic relationship. When it comes to physical love, Juliette is wise beyond her years. She will only sleep with men older than herself and has no intention of committing herself to a long-term relationship.",

        "text": "It may have had something to do with the poor copy I was watching and the badly translated subtitles, but this came across as pretentious and dull.\n\nFlat direction, stilted dialogue and unconvincing acting by the director combine to make it a pretty unbearable watch. The unusual relationship between the two teenagers is the only remotely interesting part of the film, but when the boy's father becomes involved the whole thing becomes turgid.\n\nThe classic \"parent/son' or daughter's friend\" charm intrigue offers a mixture of finely written lines sounding true and lots of crappy Rohmer imitation, badly acted by the director himself and two very young actors.\n\nGodr√®che, wich is the point of all attentions, has the perfect look for her half-clumsy teen seductress burned at her own game, an old enough body with a kid's face. Poupaud, as cute as expected at that age, looks even younger than her than the roles are, and despite his experience doesn't deliver well either.\n\nThat the scenario chooses to sink its game of seduction too soon to replace it with some doubtful \"I want you but I can't\" loop makes the film even less tolerable than it could have been.\n\nA nice innovation: the chapters each named after a line from the dialogue.\n\nScore: 4?5/10\n\nEnjoyment: 3/5"
