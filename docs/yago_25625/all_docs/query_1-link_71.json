        "text": "There are acting performances in film, theater and stage that stay with you long after your first viewing experience. It’s not often when that performance is done by a 4 year old. That is precisely the case with Victoire Thivisol as the title role in Jacques Doillon’s “Ponette”, which in heartbreaking fashion, deals with the difficulties of losing a parent at a young age.\n\nThe first scene shows Ponette being fitted with a cast on her broken arm caused by a car accident that claimed the life of her mother. In the days following the tragedy while staying with her Aunt Claire (Claire Nebout) and cousins Delphine (Delphine Schiltz) and Matiaz (Matiaz Bureau Caton), that her aunt tells her about Jesus’ resurrection and how her mother will do the same. That belief contrasts with her secular father’s (Xavier Beauvois) view that she’s gone and never coming back. As Ponette and her cousins attend a boarding school, she withdraws herself from her peers in the hope that she can see her mother again.\n\nThe best screenplays are the ones written by the director themselves because the story comes from the mind of that person who then brings the words to life. Jacques Doillon’s story is the tale that is shared by millions of children around the world who have lost a parent. “Ponette” is as realistic a story that just breaks anyone’s heart. It’s as if Doillon studied the behaviors of these children and incorporated their traits into this one very simple story. Everything from the confusion, to the adult advice all the way down to the tears shed is what makes “Ponette” stand out above so many coming of age films. The more universal the message and the story is, the more touching and down to earth the film winds up being.\n\nThe performances by Thivisol, Schiltz and Maton, exhibit a mixture of the usual childish shenanigans and adult-like bonding. The way that Delphine and Matiaz support Ponette in her grieving period just shows the altruism and moral compass that all children should possess in their upbringing. You need more filmmakers that show this compassion in order to make an example to all children in how they treat their elders and peers. Also, the dialogue that they exchange reminded me of episodes of “Kids Say The Darnest Things”; random things that really make little to no sense. But more importantly, Thivisol, at only 4 years old, proved in a matter of 90 minutes that she is better than half of the wannabe actors in Hollywood today. Anyone who is able to cry on cue without having had a single acting lesson is among the best of the best. It also reflects Jacques Doillon as a phenomenal director who can work well with children like Francois Truffault, Rene Clement and Robert Altman, to name a few.\n\n“Ponette” was one of the hits at the 1996 Venice Film Festival, where it won 4 awards; the FIPRESCI Prize, the OCIC Award, the Sergio Trasatti Award and the Volpi Cup for Victoire Thivisol’s performance, which is probably a record for the youngest actor winning a major award for a performance. It also won Foreign Film prizes at the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Board of Review as well as various prizes from the Sao Paulo and San Sebastian festivals and the Young Artists Award, which Thivisol also won at. Surprisingly, “Ponette” was snubbed by the Cesar Awards which after watching this film, I see as a travesty. In any case, what can’t be denied is the sheer excellence in children’s characterization that Jacques Doillon created and should be emulated by other directors."
