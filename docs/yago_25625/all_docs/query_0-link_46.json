        "text": "Ponette is a 1996 film about how a little girl copes with her mother's death. She withdraws from all the people around her, waiting for her mother to come back.\n\nDirected and written by Jacques Doillon.\n\nPonette\n\n[edit]\n\nMommy, where are you?\n\nGod Almighty, you know my mommy is dead because she is with you. I want to talk to my mommy.\n\nLa tante\n\n[edit]\n\nPonette, I take care of you now. Jesus is counting on me to do that.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nFather: Mommy is dead. Do you know what that means?\n\nPonette: Yes. She is flying with her magic mirror.\n\nLa Fille de l'Internet: You shouldn't be so sad.\n\nPonette: Yes, I should.\n\nLa Fille de l'Internet: Your mother was sad, too. She cried on her way to Heaven. God cried as He waited for her. When God was on earth as Jesus, He cried, too. But usually He was as joyful as a child.\n\nPonette: It isn't joyful to be a child.\n\nPonette: I'm waiting for my mommy.\n\nMatiaz: Dead people don't come back.\n\nPonette: Jesus did it for his friends. I'm more than a friend. I'm my mommy's daughter.\n\nMatiaz: Grandpa never came back.\n\nPonette: That's because no one was waiting for him.\n\nPonette: I saw Mommy.\n\nFather: You went to the cemetery by yourself? Are you crazy?\n\nPonette: She came in her flesh and blood so she wouldn't scare me. She told me to learn to be happy.\n\nMatiaz: Ponette's waiting for her mom.\n\nLa tante: It's just a game.\n\nMatiaz: No, she's really waiting.\n\nLa tante: Ponette, why don't you play with Matiaz?\n\nPonette: I can't.\n\nLa tante: What are you doing?\n\nPonette: I can't tell you.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoire Thivisol — Ponette\n\nXavier Beauvois - Ponette's father\n\nClaire Nebout - La tante (Aunt Claire)\n\nMatiaz Bureau Caton - Matiaz, Ponette's cousin\n\nDelphine Schiltz - Delphine, Ponette's cousin\n\nLéopoldine Serre - Ada\n\nAurélie Vérillon - La Fille de l'Internet\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nPonette quotes at the Internet Movie Database\n\nPonette at Rotten Tomatoes"
