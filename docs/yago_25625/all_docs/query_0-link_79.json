Behind the scenes, there is the hustle and bustle of writing and planning and casting and lots of financing going on for both of my two upcoming features and for a few short documentary films, while we wait for the world to open up again.\n\nOne of the things that bring comfort meanwhile, is film. I’m hosting an online edition of my filmclub and yesterday we watched Ponette (1996). A film by Jacques Doillon. The storyline is simple and powerful. 4-year-old Ponette loses her mother in a car crash. But Ponette refuses to let go of her. She wants her mommy.\n\nThe 4 year-old lead actress was awarded the Best Actress Award in Venice and that shows the bewilderment of the audience, including myself, on how such a young child was able to bring such a moving performance to the screen. Call it great acting. Or directing. Or a little filmmaking miracle."
