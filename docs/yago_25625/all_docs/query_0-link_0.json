The film centers on four-year-old Ponette (Victoire Thivisol), who is coming to terms with the death of her mother in a car crash.\n\nThe film received acclaim for Thivisol's performance, who was only four at the time of filming.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore the film begins, Ponette's mother dies in a car crash, which Ponette herself survives with only a broken arm (she consequently must wear an arm cast).\n\nFollowing her mother's death, Ponette's father (Xavier Beauvois) leaves the young girl with her Aunt Claire (Claire Nebout), and her cousins Matiaz (Matiaz Bureau Caton) and Delphine (Delphine Schiltz). Ponette and her cousins are later sent to a boarding school. There, the loss of her mother becomes even more harsh and painful when she is mocked on the playground for being motherless.[2]\n\nNot yet having come to terms with her mother's death, Ponette searches for her.[2] Ponette becomes increasingly withdrawn, and spends most of her time waiting for her mother to come back.\n\nWhen waiting alone fails, Ponette enlists the help of her school friend Ada (Léopoldine Serre) to help her become a \"child of God\" to hopefully convince God to return her mother, in vain.\n\nIn the end, Ponette visits a cemetery and cries for her mother, who suddenly appears to comfort her and ask her to live her life and not be sad all the time. Her mother (played by Marie Trintignant) says she cannot keep coming back, so Ponette must move on and go be happy with her father.\n\nThen, it appears that her mother gives her a sweater that she did not bring to the cemetery, and her father comments when he sees her that \"I haven't seen that sweater in a while\".\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nVictoire Thivisol as Ponette\n\nDelphine Schiltz as Delphine\n\nMatiaz Bureau Caton as Matiaz\n\nLéopoldine Serre as Ada\n\nMarie Trintignant as Mother\n\nXavier Beauvois as Father\n\nClaire Nebout as Aunt Claire\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91%, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10.[3]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward / Film Festival Category Recipients and nominees Result National Board of Review Award Top Foreign Films Won New York Film Critics Circle Award Best Foreign Language Film Won Online Film Critics Society Award Best Foreign Language Film Nominated Online Film & Television Association Award Best Breakthrough Performance - Female Victoire Thivisol Won Best Foreign Language Film Nominated São Paulo International Film Festival Critics Prize Won Satellite Award Best Foreign Language Film Nominated Society of Texas Film Critics Awards Best Foreign Film 2nd place Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup for Best Actress Victoire Thivisol Won FIPRESCI Prize Won OCIC Award Won Sergio Trasatti Award Won Golden Lion Nominated Young Artist Award Best Family Foreign Film Won Best Young Performer in a Foreign Film Victoire Thivisol Won\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
