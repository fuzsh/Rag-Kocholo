        "text": "We did have two pieces of luck. One was the Centre National de la Cinématographie, which gives the Advance on Receipts; the other was a television channel, Canal Plus. It wasn’t public television. It was a private company. It was founded by friends of François Mitterrand. Nobody believed in it. But it invested in the cinema. And these people—I’m talking about André Rousselet and Pierre Lescure—were men of culture. And so, of course, they supported an alternative cinema. Not totally, but enough to help. And so, between the Advance and Canal Plus, we were able to get some money. Say, 400,000 francs. And, with not enough money to make a film, we made a film.\n\nA certain kind of film, with two or three characters, a small crew. We were very limited. But within these limits, we had remarkable freedom.\n\nToday the system has become an obstacle. Now we’re isolated in a way that we weren’t in the eighties.\n\nIt’s a little desperate. In the eighties I made ten films. Despite everything. It wasn’t comfortable, it wasn’t easy, I had to fight. Now the bosses are television, and they all want to make what will work in prime time.\n\nProducers aren’t producers anymore; they go to the television stations. The producers have three per cent equity at most; they’re minor subtenants.\n\nNow, the cinema has sold out to the system. Everybody has a hand in the screenplay. Filmmakers put a little too much water in the wine. So the French cinema is making no progress.\n\nLook at Italy. Imagine if Antonioni or Fellini were 26 years old today, let alone Rossellini. If they submitted their screenplays to R.A.I. or to Canal Plus or to France 2, do you think they’d get money? I doubt it.\n\nIf I want to amuse myself, I take a film by Ingmar Bergman, any of the great ones from the nineteen-sixties, like “The Silence”; imagine you took the screenplay, and took Bergman’s name off it, and submitted it to a television station today. The readers’ reports would be hilarious. It wouldn’t get a cent.\n\nIt’s always my desire, my pleasure, to shoot with young people. I had always wanted to make a film with a very young child. I didn’t do it for my first film nor even for my fifth. I didn’t do it to be original. If one has the taste for childhood, it’s an exciting thing to do. I thought, not a eight-month-old, but a four-year-old, can I do it? I wrote the script. People told me, “You’re crazy.” But there’s nothing richer than the lives of four-year-old children. They’re so much richer than the lives of thirty-year-olds. For them, every experience is new. Their fantasy, their invention is perpetually new. They have a freedom of imagination that’s so much greater than that of adults.\n\nBut today, that film would be impossible. “You want to shoot with a child? You’re crazy.” They’d look at the script and say, “A story about death? With a four-year-old child? It’s morbid, sinister, cruel.”\n\nThey came out at almost the same time, didn’t they? In any case, I hadn’t seen it when I made my film. But I knew Jean Eustache. At the time, he had the idea that we should make a three-man film: him, me, and Philippe Garrel. Eustache would make a film about me or Garrel, Garrel would make a film about Eustache, and so forth. We recognized that we were part of the same cinema family, so to speak. It didn’t get made. But what’s funny is that a few years later I made “The Crying Woman” with really no money. I didn’t have the money for an actor so I decided to play the role myself—I used my daughter, my house, and myself. And I thought I was so terrible as an actor that I would never act in a movie again. And then, two people asked me to act in their films: Garrel and Eustache."
