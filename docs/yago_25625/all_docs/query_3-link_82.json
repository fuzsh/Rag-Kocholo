        "text": "French authorities on Monday, July 1, detained leading film directors Benoît Jacquot and Jacques Doillon for questioning over accusations of sexual abuse, sources close to the case have told Agence France-Presse (AFP). An AFP journalist saw both men, who have denied the allegations, arrive at a Paris police station on Monday morning, accompanied by their lawyers.\n\nJudith Godrèche, a 52-year-old actor and director, has formally accused Jacquot of rape and Doillon of sexual assault when she was a minor, accusations both men have denied. She has described Jacquot of having an unhealthy \"hold\" over her during a relationship with him that started when she was 14, from 1986 to 1992. Godrèche has accused Doillon of abuse on set when she acted in one of his films.\n\nFellow actor Isild Le Besco, 41, has also formally accused Jacquot of raping her between 1998 and 2007 during a toxic relationship that started when she was 16 and he was 52.\n\nActor Julia Roy, 34, has also filed a complaint against him for sexual assault, during \"a context of violence and moral constraint which lasted several years,\" a source close to the case said.\n\nThe director's lawyers said there had been no need to detain them in order to question them, and stressed they should be considered innocent until proven guilty. Jacquot's lawyer, Julia Minkowski, said her client would \"finally be able to express himself before the law.\"\n\nDoillon's attorney, Marie Dosé, said no legal criteria could justify his being detained for questioning \"36 years\" after the incident alleged by Godrèche.\n\nGodrèche on Instagram wrote she was deeply moved that police had finally summoned the two directors. \"I'm crying... From all this... I don't know if I have the strength but I will have it. I will have it... For her,\" she wrote, posting a picture of her teenage self next to Jacquot, 25 years her senior.\n\nThe French film industry is reeling from accusations it has too long provided cover for abuse, including after a series of allegations against 75-year-old screen legend Gérard Depardieu, all of which he denies.\n\nSince breaking her silence, Godrèche has become a leading voice in France's #MeToo movement. After she appealed for a cinema oversight body, parliament in May voted to create a commission to investigate sexual and gender-based violence in the film industry and other cultural sectors.\n\nRead more Subscribers only Cinema's devastating obsession with girls and young women\n\nLe Monde with AFP"
