"Love at Twenty" is anthology film on the titular theme by five filmmakers, Shintaro Ishihara, Marcel Ophuls, Renzo Rossellini, François Truffault, and Andrzej Wajda, united with a score by Georges Delerue and photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson.

Truffaut's short is the second of five films which follow his alter-ego, Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud). The films in the Antoine Doinel series are "The 400 Blows" (1959), "Antoine and Colette" (1962), "Stolen Kisses" (1968), "Bed and Board" (1970), and "Love on the Run" (1979).

Antoine, now aged 17, falls in love for the first time to the lovely Colette (Marie-France Pisier), whose feelings, though tender, are not reciprocated.

Set in and shot on location in Paris.

8 x 10 inches. Near Fine.
