        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton WRITTEN BY: Savannah Sher\n\nWe envyt he best friends who fall in love in movies. For this list, we'll be looking at friends-turned-lovers in our favorite films. Our countdown includes \"Friends with Benefits,\" \"13 Going on 30,\" \"Harry Potter,\" and more!\n\n#20: Rosalee Futch & Pete Monash\n\n“Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!” (2004)\n\nIt’s pretty much every guy’s worst nightmare: the girl you’re in love with ends up getting the chance to go out with the hunky celebrity that she has a crush on. This unfortunate situation comes to pass for Piggly Wiggly employee Pete, when his friend Rosalee wins a competition to go out with actor Tad Hamilton in LA. Of course, by the end of the movie Rosalee realizes just how wrong for her Tad is, and after Pete confesses his feelings for her, she comes to her senses and realizes who she is actually supposed to be with.\n\n#19: Emma Kurtzman & Adam Franklin\n\n“No Strings Attached” (2011)\n\nEmma and Adam have known each other since their days at camp as teenagers, but haven’t exactly kept in touch over the years. During a difficult moment in his life, Adam calls Emma and the two end up sleeping together but deciding to have a “no strings attached” arrangement where they hook up, but don’t engage in any of the typical relationship behaviors. Because Emma is a successful doctor, she doesn’t have time for an actual boyfriend - or so she thinks. But the more time they spend together, the more they realize that they might actually want to make the leap to being more than friends with benefits.\n\n#18: Monica Wright & Quincy McCall\n\n“Love & Basketball” (2000)\n\nAs a kid growing up in Atlanta, Quincy McCall is a huge basketball fan, and when Monica Wright moves from LA and becomes his neighbor, he’s shocked to find a girl who loves the game as much as he does. The two become childhood sweethearts, and their relationship goes through many phases as they go from childhood to adolescence to adulthood. When Quincy becomes engaged to be married to someone else, Monica knows it’s her last chance to give this relationship a shot. This is a sweet and totally underrated love story that’s great for fans of romance movies and sports movies alike.\n\n#17: Hannah & Tom\n\n“Made of Honor” (2008)\n\nThese two meet in college when they accidentally find themselves in bed together in a case of mistaken identity, but what follows is a years-long friendship that has always been platonic, until Tom realizes that he wants something more. Despite his playboy status, when Hannah leaves for Scotland, he notices the void in his life when she’s not around. Unfortunately though, she announces that she’s become engaged to a Scotsman and wants Tom to be her maid of honor, a job that he only takes on in the hopes of getting closer to her. Of course, since this is a rom com, you can probably guess how it all turns out!\n\n#16: Dylan & Jamie\n\n“Friends with Benefits” (2011)\n\nJamie and Dylan only become friends as adults when Jamie recruits Dylan for a job, but their friendship progresses quickly, and before long they’re best buds. Neither of them are having any particular success in the dating game, and they discuss how they wish they could just have casual sex. They decide to give it a shot together, keeping up appearances of just being pals during their arrangement; but, as always seems to happen in these situations, feelings end up getting involved, despite their best efforts. By the romantic climax of the film, the audience is totally convinced that these two are meant to be so much more than just friends.\n\n#15: Wallace & Chantry\n\n\"The F Word\" (2013)\n\nReleased in some countries as \"The F-Word\" and in others as “What If?”, this charming story follows Chantry and Wallace, who meet during a difficult time in Wallace’s life, after he found out his girlfriend was cheating on him, and he then dropped out of med school. Chantry had a boyfriend at the time, so their relationship is strictly platonic, but the pair becomes gradually closer. These two only get together at the very end after circumstances finally align, but it was worth the wait, because they get their happily ever after.\n\n#14: Chris Brander & Jamie Palamino\n\n“Just Friends” (2005)\n\nEven Ryan Reynolds has trouble escaping the “friendzone”. As former high school nerd turned successful music producer Chris Brander, Reynolds gets a second chance to confess his true feelings to his old high school crush, Jamie, during a trip to his old hometown. While the movie mostly adheres to rom-com clichés, the chemistry between Reynolds and co-star Amy Smart, as well as a hilarious performance by Anna Faris as unhinged pop-star Samantha James, make this an enjoyable ride that’ll leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy.\n\n#13: Zack Brown & Miriam ‘Miri’ Linky\n\n“Zack and Miri Make a Porno” (2008)\n\nAs always, Kevin Smith gives us a story of romance blooming in the most unlikely of places. The writer and director offers his signature blend of gross-out laughs and heartwarming moments in this sex comedy about the two titular roommates. Played by Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks respectively, they decide to make pornographic movies in order to pay the bills. While Zack and Miri try to keep things platonic, they eventually start falling for each other in between takes, which obviously becomes complicated, given their chosen profession. Don’t be fooled by the title; this one’s a corny romance through and through.\n\n#12: Forrest Gump & Jenny Curran\n\n“Forrest Gump” (1994)\n\nYou can run all you want Forrest, but you can’t outrun love. Robert Zemeckis’ epic and crowd-pleasing film spans several decades and portrays many important historical events, but at the heart of the story is the unconditional love Forrest has for his childhood friend, Jenny. It takes Jenny a while to reciprocate those feelings, but thanks to Forrest’s relentlessly positive attitude, she eventually sees that she loves him too. While their reunion and marriage is painfully brief and tinged with tragedy, it’s still just as sweet as a box o’ chocolates.\n\n#11: Dexter Mayhew & Emma Morley\n\n“One Day” (2011)\n\nConsider yourselves warned, this one is a tearjerker. “One Day”, based on the book of the same name, follows two friends, Emma and Dexter, giving us a glimpse into their lives on the same day every year: July 15th. It’s a unique concept that lets us watch their relationship unfold in little snippets, as their bond becomes more and more complicated over the years. They each go through many ups and downs, both individually and together, but their relationship always seems to be at the forefront of their lives. You may need to grab the tissues for the ending though, so be prepared.\n\n#10: Bianca Piper & Wesley Rush\n\n“The DUFF” (2015)\n\nBianca and Wesley were neighbors and good friends growing up, but by the time they reach high school he has become a popular jock and she is the group’s DUFF (Designated Ugly Fat Friend), who people use to get into the cool crowd. Though the two had grown apart, they find themselves becoming close again, despite the fact that he’s dating one of the school’s mean girls, on and off. Wesley and Bianca end up sharing a kiss but both act like it didn’t mean anything, even though it clearly does. By the end of the movie he’s showing his feelings for her in front of the entire school, cruel labels be damned!\n\n#9: Simba & Nala\n\n“The Lion King” (1994)\n\nWho would have thought that one of the best stories of friends becoming lovers is from one of our favorite Disney movies? Simba and Nala are besties as kids, roaming around Pride Rock and getting into trouble by tormenting Zazu. Though they’re separated for a decent amount of time after Simba flees following his father’s murder, when they come back together, it’s like no time has passed. In the end they’re destined to rule over the Pride Lands together, with Simba naming Nala as his queen, and the entire story coming full circle when their cub is revealed to the world.\n\n#8: Troy Dyer & Lelaina Pierce\n\n“Reality Bites” (1994)\n\nUnderneath all that flannel is plenty of heart. In Ben Stiller’s directorial debut, Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke play two disenfranchised Gen X-ers who find comfort in the fact that they both have uncertain futures. They’re clearly attracted to each other, but Troy’s aimlessness conflicts with Lelaina’s ambitions of becoming a documentary filmmaker. Then there’s the fact that Lelaina is already dating a TV executive. A quintessential nineties soundtrack serves as the background music as Lelaina and Troy slowly realize that they belong together- at least for the time being.\n\n#7: Paulie Bleeker & Juno MacGuff\n\n“Juno” (2007)\n\nRomance may not be the focus of this quirky film, but it still holds an unconventional love story. After a brief dalliance with her friend Paulie, the precocious and now very pregnant Juno brushes off the notion that the two are dating, despite the fact that Paulie is the father of her unborn child. However, as the plot progresses Juno realizes that besides her parents, Paulie is the one person who has constantly supported her. So she decides to confess her feelings like any normal sixteen year old would; by stuffing Paulie’s mailbox full of orange Tic Tacs. We’ll take that over a love letter any day.\n\n#6: William Matthew ‘Will’ Hayes & April Hoffman\n\n“Definitely, Maybe” (2008)\n\nMore like “Definitely, Eventually”! In a twist on the typical rom-com formula, this film plays out as a mystery. Recent divorcee Will (played by Ryan Reynolds) tells his daughter Maya the story of the three women he’s been with over the years, leaving clues as to which one eventually became the girl’s mother. However, thanks to his daughter, Will realizes that his true love isn’t his ex-wife, but his friend and one-time co-worker, April. While it takes several years, a broken marriage, and a lot of heartache, Will and April finally become a couple, all with the help of a very perceptive little girl.\n\n#5: Keith Nelson & Watts\n\n“Some Kind of Wonderful” (1987)\n\nWe’re not sure why, but “Some Kind of Wonderful” seems to have taken a back seat to some of John Hughes more popular teen comedies. But this movie features a memorable story and a great cast, along with a heartwarming tale of love. Keith and Watts are friends, but Watts is cruelly bullied because people suspect her of being gay, due to her tomboyish appearance. But when Keith shows interest in another girl, Watts realizes that she has to do something to show him how she feels. She teaches him how to kiss, but he still doesn’t understand what she really wants until the end of the movie, when the two finally make it work.\n\n#4: Matt ‘Matty’ Flamhaff & Jenna Rink\n\n“13 Going on 30” (2004)\n\nIt took a bit of wishing dust to get these friends to see they were made for each other. In 1987, 13-year old Jenna, after being tricked into Seven Minutes in Heaven with her geeky best friend Matt, brushes him off and wishes she were 30. Jenna’s wish is granted, but to her dismay, she has grown into an adult with pretty questionable morals. What’s more, she realizes she has feelings for the man Matt has grown into, but he’s engaged to another woman. Luckily, her realization sends her back to 1987, and in her newfound maturity, she kisses Matt, allowing the two to start a new, better life with each other.\n\n#3: Rosie Dunne & Alex Stewart\n\n“Love, Rosie” (2014)\n\nBased on the novel “Where Rainbows End” by Cecelia Ahern, this eventual love story follows Alex and Rosie, who have been friends forever. On Rosie’s 18th birthday, the two kiss, but because of a series of misunderstandings, it ends up pushing the two further apart. Both of their lives quickly begin to spiral, as they each sleep with other people, and then the movie jumps forward several years into their adulthood. Though they’re friends first, they can’t deny that there’s something more to their relationship, despite all of the issues they are faced with.\n\n#2: Ron Weasley & Hermione Granger\n\n“Harry Potter” franchise (2001-11)\n\nEven though fans saw this relationship coming from a mile away, it didn’t make its inevitable conclusion any less satisfying. In the earlier films, Ron and Hermione have a friendly but combative relationship and spend a lot of time arguing with each other. As the story progresses though and the two mature, it becomes clear that there’s more than friendship behind their passionate feelings for one another. Through all the adventures they share over the next few years, their feelings become more obvious until they finally kiss near the end of “The Deathly Hallows: Part 2”. Too bad that pesky Battle of Hogwarts was happening at the same time!\n\n#1: Harry Burns & Sally Albright\n\n“When Harry Met Sally…” (1989)\n\n“Can men and women just be friends?” Definitely not this classic rom com couple, who despite their natural chemistry and the fact that they keep entering each other’s lives, take years to realize that they’re meant to be together. Both Billy Crystal’s Harry and Meg Ryan’s Sally are flawed but lovable characters, with plenty of memorable quirks. It’s these quirks that keep them together through thick and thin, and even though they hit a few speed bumps along the way, they still can’t stay away from each other, leading to one of the most memorable and romantic scenes in film history. Now that’s what we call a New Year’s resolution!"
