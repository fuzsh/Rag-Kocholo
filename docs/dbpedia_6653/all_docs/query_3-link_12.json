These are the tenets of any great love and romance.\n\nThough not my personal favourite, Romance is one of the most popular and bestselling genres of all time.\n\nSo, let’s explore the beating heart of this genre and explore the true meaning of romance to find out why it is so well-loved.\n\nWhat is Romance?\n\nFrom Jane Austen to Helen Fielding to E.L. James this genre takes many different forms, but what exactly do we mean by romance?\n\nThe definition given by Wikipedia describes it as…\n\n“…a type of genre fiction novel which places its primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and usually has an “emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.”\n\nA romance arc is frequently used in both film and literature, with some iteration appearing as either the main or subplot of most stories. This makes it arguably both the most popular and the most widely used genre across the board.\n\nFun and Laughter: An In-Depth Look at the Comedy Genre\n\nExploring the different ways that comedy is expressed through literature and film…\n\nmedium.com\n\nExpected tropes\n\nAll genres, no matter what type, have certain tropes that identify them.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of tropes classic to romance but with the help of shereadsromancebooks.com and WritersWrite I have shortlisted some of my favorites:\n\nArmed Forces\n\nHero/ine falls for someone in the armed forces, or is in the armed forces and falls for a colleague, the job creates conflict for the love story. Example: Purple Hearts (Tess Wakefield)\n\nBeauty & the Beast\n\nThe hero, often disfigured or injured in an accident, must overcome his physical and emotional scars to find love with the heroine. Example: Beauty & The Beast (1991)\n\nBetrayal / Revenge\n\nHero/ine is betrayed by love interest, maybe purposefully or maybe due to a misunderstanding, often leading to central character wanting retribution. Example: Dance with the Devil (Sherrilyn Kenyon)\n\nBodyguard / Guardian or Ward\n\nHero/ine is in danger or must be protected, they fall in love with their protector. Example: The Bodyguard (1992)\n\nForbidden Love\n\nA connection between two people who shouldn’t be together due to certain oppositional factors. Example: Romeo & Juliet (William Shakespeare)\n\nLove Triangle\n\nHero/ine is caught in a three-way romantic relationship, usually with a stable and dependable, but boring match, vs the exciting partner who is wild and destructive, but filled with passion.\n\nThe hero/ine must chose between their lovers or risk losing both of them. Example: The Notebook (Nicholas Sparks)\n\nSecret Baby / Unexpected Pregnancy\n\nHeroine has a baby too young and must adapt to a slightly derailed life, fighting adversity and finding love in the process / a hero learns that he has a secret baby with an old flame that could destroy a current relationship.\n\nOr more optimistically, help him fix his wild ways and be the father and partner he was destined to be. Example: Love, Rosie (2014)\n\nSingle Parent\n\nHero/ine must grieve the loss of their spouse while caring for their kids. They navigate finding love under their new circumstances.

While films can range between 90 minutes to 2–3 hours depending on the subgenre.\n\nThe popularity of this genre likely stems from their sense of wish fulfilment and upbeat, generally breezy and lighthearted plots. A nice story while you relax on holiday or to melt away a stressful work week.\n\nIt’s escapism in its truest form where everything works out and you don’t have to dwell on life’s grittier problems. The main target audience for the romance genre is women, who are said to make up 84% of the total audience.\n\nAccording to the Nielsen’s Romance Book Buyer Report (yep, that’s a real thing) the average age for romance enthusiasts is 42 years old, down from 44 in 2013, with a significant portion being in the 18–44 age bracket.\n\nWhile researching this article, I came across this reddit thread asking why there are not really any romance books targeted at the male demographic, which I’m not sure I agree with.\n\nI think there are some romance orientated books that follow a male perspective, including Paper Towns by John Green and The Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides.\n\nYou maybe wouldn’t paint these as your typical romance books due to their sad natures, but that could speak to the ways in which men and women romanticise love. I’d have to do more research on the subject, but it’s an interesting thought.\n\nIs this currently in fashion?\n\nDespite being an extremely popular book genre, romance is often looked down on or considered a “guilty pleasure” (as so many things targeted at women are, unfortunately). However, despite this, it still persists in being one of the bestselling genres ever.\n\nAlthough, like so many things, it appears that people’s opinions on the romance genre have had a bit of a renaissance in recent years.\n\nAccording to an article by I-D, following the pandemic (and a reduction in the systemic poo-pooing of “things women typically like”), has seen a huge surge in popularity as of 2022.\n\nWhich, while this is a great thing for romance writers the world around, I doubt this genre will ever be considered unpublishable. Practically all people have felt the familiar joy (or sting) of falling in love — even if they don’t really care to read about it.\n\nRELATED: An All-Encompassing Definition of Horror\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many different facets to the romance genre. It is one of the most flexible genres due to the fact it can be placed in almost any scenario.\n\nYou can turn almost any situation into a romance, which is probably another reason it is so popular.\n\nYou are able to make it fit almost any reader’s sensibilities (provided they are not a love hating robot).\n\nWhile Romance isn’t necessarily my favourite genre to read, or write in, I have got a romance story kicking about in my head that I have every intention of writing… someday.\n\nArticle originally posted to ObsidianElephant.com\n\nOur aim at Obsidian Elephant is to help writers learn about the industry through practical examples without them having to spend lots of money on courses and programs.
