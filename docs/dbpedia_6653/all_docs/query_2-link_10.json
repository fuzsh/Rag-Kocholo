        "text": "Subject-verb agreement is the grammatical rule that the verb or verbs in a sentence must match the number, person, and gender of the subject; in English, the verb needs to match just the number and sometimes the person. For example, the singular subject it and the plural subject they use different versions of the same verb: “it goes . . . ” and “they go . . . ”\n\nLearning the rules for subject-verb agreement can be difficult at first, but with enough practice, you’ll find they start to make more sense. Below, we explain everything you need to tackle any subject-verb agreement exercises you come across, including demonstrations of how they work with lots of subject-verb agreement examples.\n\nWhat is subject-verb agreement?\n\nSubject-verb agreement, also called “subject-verb concord,” refers to matching the subject and verb of a sentence in tense, aspect, and mood (abbreviated as TAM), which translates to number, person, and gender.\n\nEnglish doesn’t use grammatical gender (except for pronouns), and only the verb be changes based on whether it’s first, second, or third person. That means most English subject-verb agreement is about quantity: if the subject is singular, the verb must be singular; if the subject is plural, the verb must be plural.\n\nEven this can get confusing, though, because talking in the first-person singular (“I climb the fence”) uses the same verb format as talking in the first-person plural (“We climb the fence”). Aside from the verb be, subject-verb agreement in English adapts verbs to the third-person singular (“It climbs the fence”).\n\nUsage and subject-verb agreement examples\n\nBasically, most subjects except third-person singular use the standard form of a verb in the present tense.\n\nThe dogs roll in the mud.\n\nI need to catch my breath.\n\nYou look like a celebrity!\n\nHowever, if the subject is third-person singular, you must use the singular form of the verb when speaking in the present tense. Most of the time, this means adding an -s to the end of the verb.\n\nThe dog rolls in the mud.\n\nShe needs to catch her breath.\n\nHe looks like a celebrity!\n\nIf the verb ends in -x, –ss, –sh, –ch, –tch, or –zz, you add –es to the end to match the third-person singular.\n\nMy snake hisses to say “I love you.”\n\nShe only matches with creeps in online dating.\n\nIf the verb ends in a consonant + y, remove the y and add –ies to match the third-person singular.\n\nAtlas carries the world on his shoulders.\n\nThe new drone flies higher than the old one.\n\nHowever, with words that end in a vowel + y, follow the normal format and add only –s to make the third-person singular.\n\nMy roommate stays in his bedroom from morning to night.\n\nWith the exception of the verb be, these guidelines apply to irregular verbs as well as regular verbs.\n\nOur father eats with the ferocity of a tiger.\n\nSo why does the verb be have so many exceptions? The most common verb in English, be doesn’t just represent a general state of existence; it’s also an auxiliary verb necessary for the continuous tenses.\n\nIn English, be is the only verb that changes based on the person. If you’re using the verb be, alone or as part of a continuous tense, the subject-verb agreement rules require that you match both the number and the person. Here’s a quick reminder of how to conjugate be in the singular and plural of each person:\n\nSingular Plural First person (I) am (we) are Second person (you) are (you) are Third person (he/she/it) is (they) are\n\nConsidering how frequently be is used in English, it’s best to memorize this chart so you can apply the proper subject-verb agreement instinctively.\n\nYou are always welcome in our home.\n\nI am running a marathon tomorrow.\n\nIt is raining even though it is sunny.\n\nIf the subject-verb agreement rules seem complicated, there is some good news: the simple past and simple future don’t change based on the number or person of the subject. Both singular and plural subjects use the same form for those tenses.\n\nThey will be here tomorrow.\n\nHe will be here tomorrow.\n\nThe potatoes grew overnight!\n\nThe potato grew overnight!\n\nThe only exception is, again, the verb be, which changes between was and were based on the subject in the simple past tense.\n\nI was young once.\n\nWe were young once.\n\nOn the other hand, the perfect tenses change their auxiliary verb depending on the number of the subject. Singular subjects use has, and plural subjects use have.\n\nThey have not seen the movie yet, so no spoilers.\n\nShe has not seen the movie yet, so no spoilers.\n\nThat covers the basics for subject-verb agreement in English. Still, there are some particularly difficult areas and more precise rules for special situations, which we explain below.\n\nAdvanced subject-verb agreement rules\n\nHere’s a list of some additional subject-verb agreement rules to clear up the more problematic areas. If you’re still confused, review the subject-verb agreement examples to see how they work.\n\n1 When using the negative form in the present tense, only the verb do needs to match the subject.\n\nShe does not like reading before bed.\n\nShe likes reading before bed.\n\n2 Likewise, in questions that involve the word do, only do needs to match the subject.\n\nDo you know where the train station is?\n\nDoes anyone know where the train station is?\n\n3 If the subject consists of multiple nouns joined by the conjunction and, treat the subject as plural and use the plural form of the verb.\n\nLucas and Maxine are in love!\n\nOnly Lucas is in love.\n\nHowever, some common phrases that form a single unit can act as singular.\n\nThis bed and breakfast is delightful!\n\n4 If the subject consists of multiple singular nouns joined by or, treat the subject as singular.\n\nPenne or rigatoni works fine for the recipe.\n\nHowever, if the subject consists of multiple plural nouns joined by or, treat the subject as plural.\n\nCats or dogs make good friends.\n\nIf there’s a combination of singular and plural nouns joined by or, the verb follows the number of the final one listed.\n\nThe teacher or the students have to inform the principal.\n\nThe students or the teacher has to inform the principal.\n\n5 If there is more than one active verb, as with compound predicates, all the verbs must agree with the subject.\n\nAfter work, I go shopping, pick up the kids, cook dinner, and then relax for the night.\n\n6 Mass nouns, otherwise known as “uncountable nouns” or “noncount nouns,” act as singular subjects.\n\nLove makes the world go around.\n\n7 Collective nouns can be either singular or plural, depending on whether they act together or separately.\n\n[Together, singular] The team goes to practice at 4:00.\n\n[Separately, plural] The team go to their own homes after practice.\n\n8 Verbs used in alternative forms, such as gerunds, infinitives, or participles, do not need to follow subject-verb agreement. However, the main verbs of the sentence still do.\n\nThe coach makes running mandatory.\n\nThe coaches make running mandatory.\n\n9 Unless you’re using an appositive or other descriptive phrase, do not put a comma between subjects and verbs.\n\nThe holiday is becoming a total disaster.\n\nThe holiday, which I was looking forward to, is becoming a total disaster.\n\n10 The words each and every count as singular when they’re used as the subject, even if they’re followed by multiple nouns.\n\nEach window and door needs to be sealed.\n\nEvery doctor, nurse, and technician gets free training here.\n\n11 Likewise, these words always act as singular subjects, even when they describe more than one thing:\n\nanybody\n\nanyone\n\neither\n\neverybody\n\neveryone\n\nneither\n\nno one\n\nnobody\n\nsomebody\n\nsomeone\n\nEverybody loves using correct grammar!\n\nEither blue or green works for the wallpaper color.\n\n12 If additional phrases come between the subject and the verb, the verb must still agree with the subject. These sentences can be tricky, so be careful.\n\nA group consisting of Professor Lidenbrock, the Icelandic guide Hans Bjelke, and the professor’s nephew Axel departs for the volcano.\n\nBe particularly careful of subjects that use the phrase “one of . . . ” The word one is singular, even when followed by plural nouns.\n\nOne of the world’s leading scientists still has trouble speaking in public.\n\n13 In the active vs. passive voice debate, the verb in the passive voice still follows whatever word acts as the subject.\n\nThey pay the electric bill online.\n\nThe electric bill is paid by them online.\n\n14 When choosing between “there is . . . ” and “there are . . . ,” the verb should match the number of the noun that follows it. The same goes for sentences beginning with “here . . . ”\n\nThere is a new map in the DLC.\n\nThere are new maps in the DLC.\n\n15 Similarly, words that indicate a portion, including percentages, use the number of the noun they describe. This noun is typically the object of the phrase “of . . . ”\n\nAll of the book is ruined!\n\nAll of the books are ruined!\n\nSome of the film is funny.\n\nSome of the films are funny.\n\nFifty percent of the house is made of wood.\n\nFifty percent of the houses are made of wood.\n\n16 When referring to distances, periods of time, or amounts of money—taken as a whole—use the singular form of the verb.\n\nTwenty dollars is too much for IMAX!\n\n17 Be careful of nouns that exist only in the plural form; they sometimes act as singular.\n\nThe news has been depressing lately.\n\nPolitics is getting too combative.\n\nHowever, some of these nouns act as plural.\n\nThe scissors do not work.\n\nIf a plural noun is preceded by the word pair, treat the subject as singular because pair is singular.\n\nThe pair of scissors does not work.\n\nSubject-verb agreement FAQs\n\nWhat is subject-verb agreement?\n\nSubject-verb agreement is the grammatical rule that the subject and verb in a sentence should use the same number, person, and gender. With the exception of the verb be, in English subject-verb agreement is about matching the number.\n\nHow does subject-verb agreement work?\n\nIn English, if a subject is singular, use the singular form of the verb; if the subject is plural, use the plural form of the verb. The only exception to this rule is the verb be, which uses different forms based on both number and person.\n\nWhat are examples of subject-verb agreement?"
