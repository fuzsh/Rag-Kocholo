Twenty years after THE 400 BLOWS, Antoine (Jean Pierre Léaud) remains an adolescent at heart. In the week following his divorce from Christine, he relives his former affairs, meeting in turn his ex-wife (Claude Jade), his first unhappy love (Marie-France Pisier, who co-scripted) and his tough-minded mistress (Dani), as well as an odd fellow, Monsieur Lucien (Julien Bertheau), who was the lover of Antoine's mother. A shamelessly happy ending throws Antoine into the arms of new love Sabine (Dorothée). DIR/SCR/PROD François Truffaut; SCR Jean Aurel, Marie-France Pisier, Suzanne Schiffman.
