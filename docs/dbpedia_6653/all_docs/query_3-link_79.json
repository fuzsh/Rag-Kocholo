For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen.\n\nNASB If someone says, 'I love God,' and yet he hates his brother or sister, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother and sister whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen.\n\nCSB If anyone says, \"I love God,\" and yet hates his brother or sister, he is a liar. For the person who does not love his brother or sister whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.\n\nNLT If someone says, 'I love God,' but hates a fellow believer, that person is a liar; for if we donât love people we can see, how can we love God, whom we cannot see?\n\nKJV If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?"
