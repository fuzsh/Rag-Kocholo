        "text": "Actor Peter Gallagher (Sex, Lies, & Videotape and The O.C.) met his wife, Paula Harwood, over forty years ago in college in a stairwell meet-cute. Since then, theyâve maintained a loving marriage and managed to raise a family while navigating the world of show business.\n\nWe talked to Peter on his 41st wedding anniversary, and he read us the Modern Love essay âFailing in Marriage Does Not Mean Failing at Marriageâ by Joe Blair. Despite the essayist being kicked out of the house by his wife five times, the couple managed to remain married and learn that a relationship can mean trying together and failing together. Reflecting on the essay, Peter gave us his advice for staying the course.\n\nPeter Gallagher will be performing on Broadway this fall in Delia Ephronâs play âLeft on Tenth.â\n\nOn the Emmy- and Peabody-winning series âThe Bear,â Liza ColÃ³n-Zayas plays Tina Marrero, a cook at the Chicago restaurant at the center of the story. Tina and her fellow workers are in a constant struggle for the survival of their restaurant, and they fight just as fiercely with one another. Only at rare moments do we see them drop the tough exterior and show one another love or respect.\n\nToday, ColÃ³n-Zayas reads âA Web Between Her Body and Mine,â by Karen Paul. Itâs a Modern Love essay about two friends who also met at work, but have a different kind of bond: Karen has no problem showing affection to her best friend, Miriam. But after Miriam has a terrible accident, Karen finds herself in uncharted territory, not certain when, or how, to support her. Itâs a story ColÃ³n-Zayas says she relates to personally, and her reaction to it takes her by surprise.\n\nEmily Ratajkowski is doing a balancing act many famously beautiful women have to perform. In her 2021 book âMy Body,â she reflects on what itâs been like to build a career based on her public image, and her struggle to control that image in an industry largely run by men. Since getting divorced a few years ago, sheâs been thinking a lot about gender dynamics and the type of agency she wants to have in dating, too.\n\nToday, Ratajkowski reads âWhy I Fell for an âIâm the Manâ Man,â by Susan Forray. Forray is also a successful, self-sufficient woman, dating after divorce. Sheâs surprised to find herself falling for a man with old-fashioned ideas about who does what in a relationship. (He pays for dinner, handles the finances and initiates sex). As a single mom who handles everything, Ratajkowski says, she can relate to the desire to be cared for once in a while. And that doesnât have to mean playing into a sexist stereotype.\n\nLaufey, the 25-year-old singer-songwriter, has risen to prominence by taking the trials of todayâs dating world â casual relationships, no labels and seemingly endless swiping on apps â and turning them into timeless love songs.\n\nToday, Laufey reads Coco Mellorsâs essay, âAn Anxious Person Tries to Be Chill,â which is about a woman trying to work through her deep-seated relationship anxieties and attachment issues in an on-again, off-again situationship. Laufey says she, too, has been an anxious partner. While she thinks a toxic relationship, like the one in the essay, can make for a great love song, she now knows secure relationships can make beautiful music, too.\n\nThe actor John Magaro is picky about whom he goes to dinner with. Magaro is an adventurous eater. So whether heâs buying offal from the butcher, making stews from the 1800s or falling in love over a plate of rabbit, he says itâs important to him that the people he shares a meal with are willing to be curious. For Magaro, itâs about more than personal preferences. Sharing a meal and connecting with other people, he says, is the bedrock of society.\n\nMagaro played Arthur in âPast Lives,â one of our favorite movies last year. His character is constantly working to understand his wife on a deeper level. And Magaro sees that quality in âMy Dinners With Andrew,â by Sara Pepitone, a Modern Love essay about food as a love language, and a series of dinners that make, and break, two relationships."
