It was entered into the 12th Berlin International Film Festival.[2]\n\nThe first segment, titled \"Antoine and Colette\", is by François Truffaut and returns actor Jean-Pierre Léaud to the role of Antoine Doinel, a role he played three years earlier in The 400 Blows and would return to again in 1968 (Stolen Kisses), 1970 (Bed and Board) and 1979 (Love on the Run). It concerns the frustrations of love for the now 17-year-old Doinel and the unresponsive girl he adores.[3]\n\nThe second, titled \"Rome\", is the directorial debut of 21-year-old Renzo Rossellini, son of Roberto Rossellini and later a noted producer. It tells the story of a tough mistress who loses her lover to an older, wealthier and more appreciative woman.[4]\n\nThe third, \"Tokyo\" by Japanese film director Shintarō Ishihara, has been described as a \"weird, grotesque\"[3] and \"clumsy\"[5] tale of obsessive and morbid love.\n\nThe fourth, \"Munich\", is by Marcel Ophüls and was described as a \"charming, but somewhat sentimental\"[3] story of an unwed mother who contrives to trap her baby's father.\n\nThe fifth and final segment, \"Warsaw\" by Andrzej Wajda, depicts a brief intergenerational liaison based upon multiple misunderstandings.[5] The episodes are tied together with still photos by Henri Cartier-Bresson and a wistful jazz soundtrack by Georges Delerue.\n\nTruffaut's and Wajda's segments (the first and the last, respectively) are considered the highlights.[6]\n\nJean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel (segment Antoine and Colette)\n\nMarie-France Pisier as Colette (segment Antoine and Colette)\n\nPatrick Auffay as René (segment Antoine and Colette)\n\nRosy Varte as La mère de Colette (segment Antoine and Colette)\n\nFrançois Darbon as Le beau-père de Colette (segment Antoine and Colette)\n\nJean-François Adam as Albert Tazzi (segment Antoine and Colette)\n\nPierre Schaeffer as himself (segment Antoine and Colette)\n\nCristina Gaioni as Christina (as Christina Gajoni)\n\nGeronimo Meynier as Leonardo\n\nEleonora Rossi Drago as Valentina\n\nNami Tamura as Fukimo\n\nKoji Furuhata as Hiroshi\n\nBarbara Frey as Ursula\n\nChristian Doermer as Tonio\n\nVera Tschechowa as Self\n\nWerner Finck as Professor Zeifer\n\nBarbara Lass as Basia (segment \"Warszawa\")\n\nZbigniew Cybulski as Zbyszek (segment \"Warszawa\")\n\nWładysław Kowalski as Wladek (segment \"Warszawa\")"
