        "text": "NASHVILLE, TN (October 20, 2023) — Dave Stewart — the highly acclaimed Rock & Roll Hall of Famer, Songwriter Hall of Famer, UK Music Hall of Famer, GRAMMY Award, Brit Award and Ivor Novello Award-winning musician — recently formed a new creative collective, The Time Experience Project. Today (10/20) they have released their inaugural project, WHO TO LOVE, a 10-song modern rock opera via Bay Street Records. Along with Stewart, who is also a successful music and television producer, and all-around creative force, The Time Experience Project is made up of writers, actors, filmmakers, composers and performers.\n\nThe album’s release is underscored with a pulsating focus track, “Electrified,” that’s backed with an official music video starring Greta Scarano.\n\nWatch the music video for “Electrified” below.\n\nStream the WHO TO LOVE album here.\n\nWHO TO LOVE will also have a movie — which premiered yesterday at the Rome Film Festival — to accompany the album. With WHO TO LOVE, Stewart writes a new page in his incredible career which also includes being a Golden Globe Award winner and Eurythmics co-founder. For this project, Dave Stewart called to his side the great Italian television, stage, and film actress, Greta Scarano and legendary Italian band Mokadelic for this adventure that inextricably joins music and images — weaved together with a strong emotional impact that investigates the deepest folds of the human soul through music, memories and nightmares that intertwine in an alienating journey.\n\nLyndsey Parker of YAHOO! ENTERTAINMENT notes, “Dave Stewart conjures sweet dreams with ecstatic new rock opera [WHO TO LOVE],” while additional international praiseworthy coverage poured in from outlets like NME, AMERICAN SONGWRITER, HOT PRESS, THE HOLLYWOOD REPORTER, and more.\n\nWatch the music video for “Brings Me Home” here.\n\n“Brings Me Home,” the lead single and accompanying music video for WHO TO LOVE, is equally musically stunning as it is visually gripping. “It’s a song about the power of real love; about how something as simple as holding someone’s hand or seeing their face can make us feel at home, even amid chaos,” says Stewart. “In a world that is constantly changing and moving at a rapid pace, it is important to slow down and connect with others in a meaningful way. This song reminds us that we all need a place to call home, both physically and emotionally.”\n\n“The songs on this album are centered around the elusive nature of time, how it seems to speed up or slow down depending on your mental state,” shares Dave Stewart. “Through the music and lyrics we try to interpret this feeling and how life’s journey can become serpentine and surreal as we wander through moments of sadness, melancholy, love addiction and pure ecstasy.” Stewart adds: “The short film revolves around a character who is struggling with anxiety and loneliness, reflected in both the music and the actions of the protagonist.”"
