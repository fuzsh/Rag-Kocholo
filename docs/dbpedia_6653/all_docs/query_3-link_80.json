        "text": "Welcome to the Open Thread, everyone! Thanks for joining in on this group watch of this very special show! ❤️\n\nAs I mentioned in my announcement post, these are my notes, exactly as they appear on Patreon.\n\nZERO SPOILER POLICY\n\nWe will be adopting a ZERO SPOILER POLICY for this Open Thread, except for events that have happened in the show, up to this point.\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to, how characters &/or relationships develop, later in the show.\n\nThe spoiler tags don’t work in email notifications, therefore, please take note that WE WILL NOT BE USING SPOILER TAGS FOR THIS OPEN THREAD.\n\nWe need to protect the innocent! 😉\n\nWithout further ado, here are my reactions to this set of episodes; have fun in the Open Thread, everyone! ❤️\n\nMy thoughts\n\nEpisodes 17-18\n\nE17-18. I have decided that Show is essentially a drug lord who’s keeping me around, watching stuff that I’m sometimes not very interested in, and then dangling bits of OTP crack at me, just often enough, that I’m willing to stick around to wait for the next hit. 😅\n\nFor example, I have to admit that I’m not truly that interested in the armaments case that Buyi’s been investigating, even though it’s clearly a very big and important thing to him.\n\nI try to pay attention, I do, but I have to also admit that sometimes, when all the political talking goes on for too long, my eyes glaze over and my mind starts to wander. 😝\n\nBut of course, if the scene requires Buyi to be all fierce and badass, I sit up and pay attention, even if the scene has nothing to do with Shaoshang.\n\nThis set of episodes, I’m inordinately amused that in our opening scene, Buyi’s extra fierce when fighting, because he’s grumpy that this thing with Fan Chang breaking out of prison, has prevented him from escorting Shaoshang back home.\n\nTee hee hee. That feels kinda petty coming from our honorable general, which makes it extra funny. 😁\n\nI wasn’t suuper interested in Buyi’s conversation with Wingman Emperor about Lord Yong and the rebellion, but it tickles me quite a bit, that after a serious topic like that, Wingman Emperor’s first thought about He Zhaojun, is to curse Prince Xiao for enticing her to leave Lou Yao, thus creating a situation where Buyi’s all alone because Lou Yao’s snatched Shaoshang away.\n\nOur emperor really is fixated on getting Buyi married off to the girl whom he likes, and it’s completely unbelievable that an emperor would behave like this, but it’s also utterly endearing, that this particular emperor does behave like this, heh.\n\nI’m now more than halfway convinced that Wingman Emperor would bend the rules willfully, if it meant that he’d be helping Buyi gain Shaoshang’s heart and hand. 😁\n\nThis set of episodes, I have to confess that I don’t have much interest in Yuan Shen inviting himself to be a tutor to the Cheng family’s kids, all because he wants to be around Shaoshang.\n\nI.. actually have no idea what Yuan Shen’s actually thinking. He knows that Shaoshang is about to be betrothed to Lou Yao, and he’s not about to try to interfere with that.\n\nSo.. his purpose is just to be near her, for as long as possible, just for the sake of seeing her?\n\nBut, when he does see Shaoshang, he’s more sarcastic than anything else, like he’s trying to provoke her.\n\nI don’t get it?\n\nMaybe this is just his way of enjoying her presence, for as long as he can, before she gets married to Lou Yao – and then he can pine for her on his own, like his Master has done for Third Aunt, all these years?\n\nI also have to admit that my interest in the marriage talks between the Lou and Cheng families, really only goes as far as a curiosity around how Show is going to avoid this marriage between Shaoshang and Lou Yao, since we all know that Lou Yao isn’t romantic endgame.\n\nMeaning, Show will likely have to throw a spanner in the marriage works, but.. how, is the question.\n\nThe other thing that is starting to show up a bit, is that Shaoshang doesn’t understand what love is, and has decided to marry Lou Yao more because she finds him a helpful and agreeable companion, than someone for whom she has strong feelings.\n\nCertainly, I do find it somewhat surprising that talk about love is fairly commonplace in our story world, since, like I mentioned before, arranged marriages were the order of the day, and love matches were the exception rather than the norm.\n\nHmm.. Actually, perhaps people around Shaoshang are talking about love to her because this is a match she’s chosen for herself, and most people who choose matches for themselves (versus being matchmade), choose love matches, unlike Shaoshang, who’s pretty much chosen a friend and playmate.\n\nI do like that even when Shaoshang is faced with the snide remarks of Lou Yao’s aunt, during her visit to the Lou household, she remains cheerful and unfazed.\n\nI’m also taken by surprise, to learn that Snooty Socialite #2, whom we’ve seen at several banquets now, is actually Lou Yao’s cousin, Lou Li.\n\nI’d have thought that this might make Shaoshang feel less enthused about marrying Lou Yao, since they would mean crossing paths with Lou Li a lot more, but Shaoshang isn’t deterred at all.\n\nI guess she’s just that eager to move away from her family home, and start a new life of her own?\n\nI’m glad to see that Shaoshang isn’t at all daunted by Lou Li’s taunts, and gives as good as she gets, in terms of provocative statements.\n\nI’m even gladder, that Yuanyi steps in to speak up on Shaoshang’s behalf, when the elder folks come across the younger women arguing.\n\nHonestly, I’m just that eager to see Yuanyi and Shaoshang on the same side, for a change, that I’m happy to roll with this.\n\nIn the end, though, Shaoshang remains undaunted in her desire to marry Lou Yao, and that’s a little perplexing for me as a viewer, because I’m honestly rooting for her to fall in love with Buyi the way he’s fallen in love with her.\n\nI perk up at every instance when Buyi and Shaoshang share the screen, like in episode 18, when he meets her at the roadblock, and offers to escort her back home.\n\nThe way he looks at her, is extra gentle, and the way he speaks to her, is extra gentle as well.\n\nIt shows up every single time he is interacting directly with her, whether there are other people present or not, and that detail does make me melt.\n\nI feel like he’d be able to hide his tenderness towards her if he wanted to, but.. he doesn’t want to, and just lets it all hang out, unabashedly, even if her mother is watching. That’s very endearing to me. 😍\n\nOn Shaoshang’s side of things, though, I can understand why she’s reflexively putting distance between herself and Buyi.\n\nAlthough her parents have made it clear to her that Buyi has feelings for her, she’s hearing this after having chosen to marry someone else, so it’s completely improper for her to have a personal sort of connection with Buyi.\n\nThat’s why she’s doing all the proper things, of mentioning to Buyi that her marriage to Lou Yao is imminent, and that she’s just been to the Lou residence for marriage talks.\n\nOof. Buyi’s subtle-but-distinct crestfallen expression is like a punch to the gut, honestly. I feel so bad for him, that this is what he’s facing right now, in response to his feelings for Shaoshang.\n\nAnd yet, he continues to be so steadfast, like how he requests the emperor to grant her imperial favor by praising her, even as he bestows the wedding gift of a pair of jade artifacts that he’s decided on.\n\nIt’s as if he knows exactly what she’s going through, with so many people looking down on her, and wishes to impart credibility and honor to her, in a way that others wouldn’t be able to refute.\n\nI also love that he’s the one to deliver the edict, as if he’d volunteered for it, because he wants to see her receive this honor with his own eyes.\n\nAnd when she doesn’t know what to do, he tells her, in that same gentle tone, to receive the edict.\n\nAnd then, when she trips and falls, he’s right there to catch her, his gaze never leaving her face. Ahhhh!!!\n\nBasically, the electric tension between them doesn’t escape the eyes of anyone present. 🔥\n\nI feel bad for Buyi, that Shaoshang’s instinct is to jump away from him, but like I said before, this is just Shaoshang observing the proper distance expected of them, particularly given that she’s getting betrothed to someone else.\n\nPoor Buyi though. I feel like that single moment, of Shaoshang jumping back away from him, is like a sucker punch to his gut.\n\nHe looks so stoically forlorn, even as he offers the edict to her, sighhh. 😭\n\nEpisodes 19-20\n\nE19-20. This set of episodes, a big highlight for me, is when Buyi asks to see Shaoshang alone, after she’s received the edict.\n\nThat scene, with the sun’s rays shining so poetically over the both of them, is so beautiful, seriously. 🤩\n\nIn particular, I love how the lighting plays with the shadows on Buyi’s face; it makes him look ethereally beautiful, like he’s walked out of a painting.\n\nI’m also very tickled by how Buyi gets Shaoshang to meet him in the first place, where his third message is that if she doesn’t come as requested, that he’ll seek her out himself, which would be improper, and which would then force her to marry him, as recourse.\n\nHahaha! I bet Buyi would be quite happy with that outcome, actually. 😁\n\nI do love that in this meeting, which Buyi believes will likely be the last time they see each other, his main aim, is still to understand her better.\n\nThe way he asks her what her dreams are, and what she’d like to do, aside from getting married, and then soaks up her answers, like they’re music to his ears, is such heart-wobbly stuff. 😍\n\nOn the other hand, as sweet as this is, it’s just as poignant, to hear him say that they are not on the same path, and this will likely be the last time they see each other.\n\nOof. That hurts to hear, even though I know that this surely can’t be the last time they see each other.\n\nI do respect that through all of this admittedly very poetic melty time with Buyi, Shaoshang conducts herself with utmost decorum.\n\nEven when she hears that there’s a good chance he might die in battle this time, and hasn’t properly heard her play the flute, she doesn’t respond in any way that would be deemed inappropriate.\n\nInstead, she simply tells him that she will play the flute for him, when he comes back victorious.\n\nAugh. Such a beautiful and poignant scene.\n\nAfter that, I’m actually really relieved that we get a one-month time skip, so that we don’t actually have to contend with a month’s worth of screen time, when Buyi’s away at battle. 😅\n\nI have to confess, that when we learn that General He’s dying wish is for his daughter Zhaojun to marry Lou Yao as originally betrothed, I was ready to jump on that and go, “YESSS. Let’s break off this engagement between Shaoshang and Lou Yao!!” 😅\n\nWhich is quite terrible of me, really, since this would entail a good amount of suffering for Lou Yao, as we’ve seen in earlier scenes when he’d been betrothed to Zhaojun.\n\nIn my feeble defense, it was my OTP reflexes kicking in; I just want the way to be paved for Buyi and Shaoshang to fall in love already. 😅\n\nIt’s unsurprising that the Lou family is keen to accept this betrothal, because it would be politically advantageous to them, but it’s sad for poor Lou Yao, who’s expected to just go along with everything, even though he has no interest in marrying Zhaojun.\n\nOne of the most satisfying scenes for me, this set of episodes, is when Yuanyi and Shaoshang go over to the Lou residence, and basically end up being awesome partners, as they take on Lou Yao’s aunt, and Lou Li, respectively.\n\nThe sharp words are one thing, but that slap that Yuanyi delivers is so sharp and satisfying. And then, Show takes it one step further, by giving us a bonus slap, which Shaoshang delivers to Lou Li.\n\nAhhh. Yuanyi and Shaoshang are so alike, and when that similarity is channeled fruitfully like this, with them standing on the same side, and defending each other, it’s just glorious to behold. 🤩\n\nI just.. don’t get the part where Shaoshang still asks Lou Yao whether he wants to cancel their betrothal. I mean, isn’t it out of his hands by this point, since Yuanyi’s literally just slapped his aunt, and declared that they will henceforth have nothing to do with the Lou family..?\n\nI’m admittedly slightly surprised that our stoic general kills Lord Yong in such an unauthorized manner, but it makes a lot more sense in context, when we realize that he’s made it his goal to seek vengeance for his uncle, and everyone else who’d died as a result of Lord Yong’s treachery.\n\nPlus, we also get glimpses, this set of episodes, of the kind of trauma that Buyi had experienced as a child, together with his mother.\n\nNo wonder his anger towards Lord Yong runs so deep, and no wonder the manner in which he kills Lord Yong, feels so personal.\n\nIt’s a little startling, in that it feels rather cold-blooded, but it’s not hard to rationalize, since Buyi has had to kill so many, in the course of his duty, and also, since Lord Yong’s actions have resulted in so much suffering and bloodshed.\n\nAlso, it helps that Buyi is ready to receive any kind of punishment that the Emperor would give him, for his misconduct. He knows that his actions were against protocol, but he’s willing to pay the price for it.\n\nAnd finally, there’s our final arc, where Zhaojun takes Shaoshang with her, to not just witness Prince Xiao’s execution, but carry it out.\n\nThat’s.. wild, really.\n\nBecause, you certainly need a significant amount of strength and skill, to be able to decapitate someone successfully. And she’s a dainty noble lady with no experience or skill with the sword.\n\nBut Show lets her succeed on the first try anyway – which is when Shaoshang turns away reflexively, right into Buyi’s arms.\n\nEeee!!! I love how he’s such a rock, and how he instinctively enfolds her in his embrace, with one hand cradling her head.\n\nAnd then, he says his signature line, “Don’t be afraid. I’m here.”\n\nGurgle. It’s such swoony stuff, really.\n\nFlail. Melt. Swoon.\n\nWhere do we go from here?? I’m extremely curious to know! 😍😍"
