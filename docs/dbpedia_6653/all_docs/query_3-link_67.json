        "text": "Falling in love is exhilarating, overwhelming, sometimes complicated, but all-around electrifying. You can’t help but picture a future together — whether that’s going to prom together, attending the same college, moving to the same city post-high school, getting married... whatever long-term love looks like to you, you dream about it. But, how do you know if your significant other is the one? In other words, how do you know if they’re... your soulmate?\n\n“Soulmate” is a small but powerful word, and tbh, the concept can be a little intimidating. But soulmate relationships don’t come down to destiny, the stars aligning, or finding a missing puzzle piece. It’s about building a deep, intimate, and passionate connection with someone and nurturing that love through the ups and downs. Sometimes, it doesn’t last forever.\n\n“I believe that soulmates aren’t born, they’re created. You can spend the rest of your life with one person and have a deep and beautiful love story, but that process is co-created. [It is] not a Prince Charming who arrives perfectly ready to sweep you off your feet,” Dr. Christie Kederian, a relationship expert and licensed family and marriage therapist, explains. “They are a person you build an equally fulfilling life with, that isn’t always perfect, but helps you grow more into the person you’re meant to be.”\n\nSure, some people don’t believe in “soulmates,” but it is nice to think that there is someone out there (or a few people even) meant for you. Dr. Kederian points out that family and friends can be platonic soulmates, and when it comes to your S.O., they might not be yours forever. Just remember: Relationships are journeys, especially when you’re still figuring out who you are and what you want in life and love. But if you can’t stop wondering whether or not your partner is your ideal match, here are 20 soulmate signs that will help you figure out if you’ve found a true ~love~ connection.\n\n1. You just know\n\nNo test will help you determine if you’ve found your soulmate or not. You have to feel itz in your gut that this person is the right one for you. We know it sounds trite, but when you get that feeling, you’ll know what it means. You should feel energized by their presence, comfortable enough to completely open up, and just giddy with love. Of course, connections manifest themselves in different ways for everyone, and feelings can change over time.\n\n2. They’re your best friend\n\nA friendship is the best foundation for any relationship — why do you think so many rom-coms are about two besties who get together? If you are in a trusting, positive friendship with your S.O., that’s an amazing sign!\n\n3. Being with them feels like home\n\nNo matter where you are in the world, being with your soulmate feels like home. There’s an unmistakable feeling of comfort and ease when they’re by your side. You spend so much time together, so being with them should make you feel at peace. There will probably be butterflies and nerves at first, but after you get comfortable with each other, it feels completely natural.\n\n4. You have lots of empathy for them\n\nWhen they fail a test, you might as well have failed it, because, in a sense, you feel each other’s feelings. Seeing them upset upsets you, but conversely, you share in each other’s happiness. No one is more proud of their S.O. than you, and when they succeed, nothing makes you happier.\n\n5. You respect each other\n\nA relationship is nothing without respect. If your S.O. doesn’t admire you for who you are, they’re probably not your soulmate. They should care about your feelings and ideas — not write them off. They should appreciate and love you and always treat you well.\n\n6. You balance each other out\n\nYou don’t have to be a replica of your S.O. to be soulmates. You two can have different temperaments, interests, and backgrounds and still be meant for each other. The key is how you two, as very different people, come together. Does your chill nature compliment their always-on-the-go demeanor? Does your love for environmentalism match well with their interests in engineering? Are they the ying to your yang?\n\n7. You respect each other’s differences but agree about the important things\n\nYou may never be able to decide what TV show to watch together or what toppings to get on the pizza, but when it comes to the important things in life, like your values, you’re on the same page.\n\n8. You share the same life goals\n\nSpeaking of the important things... when it comes to life goals, you guys have similar plans. We’re not saying you both want the same career or you want to go to the same college. But you both agree on whether or not you want to start a family or the values you want to live your lives by. There will be disagreements here and there, but you guys are on the same page about the big stuff.\n\n9. You challenge each other\n\nYour soulmate should bring out the best in you, and that means pushing you a little to become the best you can be. Yes, you should admire and respect your partner and who they are, but you should also motivate them to reach their goals, try a little harder when they need a nudge, and aid with their personal development. Relationships are all about growth, and soulmates help each other grow together.\n\n10. You can totally be yourself\n\nThere’s no faking it when it comes to your soulmate. You can be totally yourself around them and you know they’ll love you for you. You share your guilty pleasures, your weird quirks, your deepest secrets, and you know it will just make them love you more.\n\n11. You fight for the relationship\n\nRelationships aren’t always easy, even between soulmates, but you two work hard for your relationship. This often means compromising, working on yourself, or talking through issues. You might argue or disagree over something, but you come out of the situation stronger and more understanding of each other. The fact that you two are showing that you’re willing to take these steps to work together and fight for each other is a sign you’re soulmates.\n\n12. You understand each other’s emotional languages\n\nIf you don’t know what your love language is, take the quiz. Basically, there are five different love languages, aka how you like to give and receive love. Your love language might be Words of Affirmation, which means that your heart skips a beat when your SO tells you how much they love you. On the other hand, their love language might be Physical Touch, so they like to show their love with cuddles. You can totally be with someone who has a different love language than you — you just need to understand how you both express love and what you expect from each other.\n\n13. You’re each other’s biggest fans\n\nYour S.O. should be rooting for you constantly, and vice versa. Their wins are your wins, meaning when they hear big news, you’re just as excited as they are. If just seeing your partner happy makes you happy, that’s something special.\n\n14. There’s chemistry\n\nOf course, the physical aspect of a relationship is important and with you and your S.O., it’s definitely there. Sometimes you feel like you can't keep your hands off each other, but you’re also very respectful of each other’s boundaries.\n\n15. You’re there for each other\n\nYes, being in a relationship is a lot of fun, but soulmates are there in good times and in bad, meaning when you’re going through something tough, you know you can count on your S.O. to listen and be there with you through it all.\n\n16. You’re secure in the relationship\n\nIt’s normal to get jealous sometimes, but you should 100 percent trust your person. No one will get in between you two, so your S.O. can hang with friends, maybe go to a party you have to miss, and you don’t worry about the status of your relationship.\n\n17. You just want to be around each other\n\nYou don’t always feel the need to plan elaborate dates. Simply being around each other is the best. You can sit in silence and feel each other’s presence and it lifts you up. In fact, sitting in silence together feels completely comfortable. You don’t need to fill it with small talk because it feels totally natural to just be near each other and read a book, scroll TikTok, or journal. There are rarely conversations that feel forced or clumsy.\n\n18. You feel like you’ve known them forever\n\nWhether you’ve been dating for five months or five years, being with your soulmate feels like you’ve known them your whole life. It oftentimes feels unimaginable that they weren’t there for certain events in life, simply because you hadn’t met them yet.\n\n19. Sometimes, you feel like you can read their mind\n\nIt's easy to communicate with your significant other — so easy that you might even feel like you can read their mind at times. Maybe it’s because you’re on the same page about upcoming plans, or just know what they’re going to say before they say it. You might also just know their facial expressions so well, that you understand how they’re feeling without them having to say a word.\n\n20. Your friends and family get along\n\nA good sign that you’re with the right person is if your friends and family get along with them well. In most situations, your besties and fam been in your life for longer than your S.O., and they want to see you in a happy and healthy relationship. Their approval means a lot. Trust your gut, but if there’s a reason that someone important in your life doesn't like your partner, listen to their concerns and try to engage in an open, honest conversation with them."
