        "text": "Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despair, verse collection by Chilean poet and diplomat Pablo Neruda, published in 1924 as Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada. The book immediately established the author’s reputation and went on to become his most popular book; it became one of the most widely read collections of poetry written in Spanish.\n\nThe 20 love poems of the title poignantly describe remembered affairs with two women: a girl from the poet’s native town of Temuco and a classmate at the University of Santiago. The collection begins with intensity, describing sensual passion that slackens into melancholy and detachment in the later verses. The closing poem, “A Song of Despair,” is bitter and hopeless."
