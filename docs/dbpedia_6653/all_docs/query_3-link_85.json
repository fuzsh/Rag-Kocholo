        "text": "The Avett Brothers last released a full-length studio album in 2019, continuing their steady collaborative streak with Rick Rubin on Closer Than Together. In the five years since, the band and producer have been putting together the pieces for their next record, a self-titled album set for release on May 17. Their first offering from The Avett Brothers, a nine-track project, is the devotional “Love of a Girl.”\n\nSiblings Scott and Seth Avett are one and the same on the rock single. “I got one older brother, he’s a fighter and a lover/And every other day, he seems to rediscover/What the underlying meaning of the dreaming and the scheming is,” the second verse details, with the chorus adding: “Never find him waiting patient/For someone to come explain it/Why he suffers so/Well it’s all for the love of a girl.”\n\nThe Avett Brothers was recorded between Malibu, Nashville, Mar Vista, and the band’s North Carolina hometown of Concord. In a release, the record is described as “a collection of songs seen through a lens of independently studied spirituality; questions and considerations in the interest of the divine unknowable.”\n\nThe album’s tracklist leads with simplicity. There’s “Cheap Coffee” and “We Are Loved,” which, from the title alone, offer brief insights into finding meaning in the mundane. Also within the list are songs titled “2020 Regret,” “Same Broken Bones,” and “Country Kid,” which point toward deeper introspection as the band gives into “reveling in the fun and surrender of what we cannot understand,” as the release suggests.\n\nTrending\n\nThe album’s release will coincide with the launch of an expansive tour featuring appearances alongside Sierra Ferrell, Luke Combs, and Sammy Rae & The Friends. Complete dates and ticket information can be found on the official Avett Brothers website."
