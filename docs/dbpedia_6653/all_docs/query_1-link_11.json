Overhearing Romeo ask about her, Tybalt recognizes his voice and is enraged at the intrusion.\n\nRomeo then meets Juliet, and they fall in love. Not until they are separated do they discover that they belong to enemy houses.\n\nServingmen come forth with napkins.\n\n⌜FIRST⌝ SERVINGMAN 0604 Where’s Potpan that he helps not\n\n0605 to take away? He shift a trencher? He scrape a\n\n0606 trencher?\n\n⌜SECOND⌝ SERVINGMAN 0607 When good manners shall lie\n\n0608 5 all in one or two men’s hands, and they unwashed\n\n0609 too, ’tis a foul thing.\n\n⌜FIRST⌝ SERVINGMAN 0610 Away with the joint stools, remove\n\n0611 the court cupboard, look to the plate.—\n\n0612 Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane, and, as\n\n0613 10 thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone\n\n0614 and Nell.—Anthony and Potpan!\n\n⌜THIRD⌝ SERVINGMAN 0615 Ay, boy, ready.\n\n⌜FIRST⌝ SERVINGMAN 0616 You are looked for and called for,\n\n0617 asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.\n\n⌜THIRD⌝ SERVINGMAN 0618 15We cannot be here and there too.\n\n0619 Cheerly, boys!

Ladies that have their toes\n\n0622 Unplagued with corns will walk ⌜a bout⌝ with\n\n0623 20 you.—\n\n0624 Ah, my mistresses, which of you all\n\n0625 Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,\n\n0626 She, I’ll swear, hath corns. Am I come near you\n\n0627 now?—\n\n0628 25 Welcome, gentlemen. I have seen the day\n\n0629 That I have worn a visor and could tell\n\n0630 A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,\n\n0631 Such as would please. ’Tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone.\n\np. 53\n\n0632 You are welcome, gentlemen.—Come, musicians,\n\n0633 30 play.Music plays and they dance.\n\n0634 A hall, a hall, give room!—And foot it, girls.—\n\n0635 More light, you knaves, and turn the tables up,\n\n0636 And quench the fire; the room is grown too hot.—\n\n0637 Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well.—\n\n0638 35 Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,\n\n0639 For you and I are past our dancing days.\n\n0640 How long is ’t now since last yourself and I\n\n0641 Were in a mask?\n\nCAPULET’S COUSIN 0642 By ’r Lady, thirty years.\n\nCAPULET\n\n0643 40 What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much.\n\n0644 ’Tis since the nuptial of ⌜Lucentio,⌝\n\n0645 Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,\n\n0646 Some five and twenty years, and then we masked.\n\nCAPULET’S COUSIN\n\n0647 ’Tis more, ’tis more. His son is elder, sir.\n\n0648 45 His son is thirty.\n\nCAPULET 0649 Will you tell me that?\n\n0650 His son was but a ward two years ago.\n\nROMEO, ⌜to a Servingman⌝\n\n0651 What lady’s that which doth enrich the hand\n\n0652 Of yonder knight?\n\nSERVINGMAN 0653 50I know not, sir.\n\nROMEO\n\n0654 O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!\n\n0655 It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night\n\n0656 As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear—\n\n0657 Beauty too rich for use, for Earth too dear.\n\n0658 55 So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows\n\n0659 As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.\n\n0660 The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand\n\n0661 And, touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.\n\n0662 Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight,\n\n0663 60 For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.\n\np. 55\n\nTYBALT\n\n0664 This, by his voice, should be a Montague.—\n\n0665 Fetch me my rapier, boy.⌜Page exits.⌝\n\n0666 What, dares the slave\n\n0667 Come hither covered with an antic face\n\n0668 65 To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?\n\n0669 Now, by the stock and honor of my kin,\n\n0670 To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.\n\nCAPULET\n\n0671 Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?\n\nTYBALT\n\n0672 Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,\n\n0673 70 A villain that is hither come in spite\n\n0674 To scorn at our solemnity this night.\n\nCAPULET\n\n0675 Young Romeo is it?\n\nTYBALT 0676 ’Tis he, that villain Romeo.\n\nCAPULET\n\n0677 Content thee, gentle coz. Let him alone.\n\n0678 75 He bears him like a portly gentleman,\n\n0679 And, to say truth, Verona brags of him\n\n0680 To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.\n\n0681 I would not for the wealth of all this town\n\n0682 Here in my house do him disparagement.\n\n0683 80 Therefore be patient. Take no note of him.\n\n0684 It is my will, the which if thou respect,\n\n0685 Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,\n\n0686 An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\n\nTYBALT\n\n0687 It fits when such a villain is a guest.\n\n0688 85 I’ll not endure him.\n\nCAPULET 0689 He shall be endured.\n\n0690 What, goodman boy?
