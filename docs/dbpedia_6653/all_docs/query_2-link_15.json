        "text": "Comedian Mitch Hedberg is set to be the focus of a forthcoming documentary, nearly two decades after his death.\n\nDirector Jeff Siegel, who is nominated for a 2024 Emmy, is helming the feature that has wrapped principal photography after a filming process that began five years ago. The project, which is currently untitled and does not yet have a planned release date, is set to include archival footage, home movies and interviews with loved ones, childhood friends and fellow comics.\n\nThe filmmakers have conducted more than 100 interviews across the country for the film. Among those offering perspective on Hedberg’s life and career are Lewis Black, Jim Gaffigan, B.J. Novak, Margaret Cho, Dave Attell, Doug Stanhope, Todd Barry, Felicia Michaels, Al Madrigal, Todd Glass, Greg Fitzsimmons, Brendon Small, Gary Gulman and Nick Swardson.\n\n“A lot of people have had a lot to say for a very long time, but no one to say it to until now,” said Siegel in a statement. “It’s taken many years to connect with nearly everyone who was a part of Mitch’s life and piece together his largely unknown story. All that most people know is that he was hilarious and died young, but he was so much more than that.”\n\nAdded Novak, “We talked about him as if he was too special for this world. He had this energy that he was from another planet.”\n\nKnown for his absurdist, one-liner-style delivery, Hedberg was beloved by fans and fellow comics alike. He made 10 appearances on The Late Show With David Letterman and released three stand-up albums, including 2003’s Mitch All Together, which was certified gold in 2021. Among his onscreen credits were appearances on such series as That ’70s Show and in films including Almost Famous and Lords of Dogtown. Time magazine had dubbed Hedberg “the next [Jerry] Seinfeld.”\n\nHedberg died from a drug overdose on March 30, 2005, at age 37. His sister Angie Anderson said in a statement about the documentary, “Mitch would want us to be laughing. I miss him, but it would be unfair for all of us to be sad, because he wouldn’t want that. Not for one second.”\n\nThe documentary hails from 222-2222 Films, a partnership between Siegel and Michael Blieden, with the company’s name referencing a Hedberg joke. (Hedberg’s bit goes, “I hope next time I move, I get a real easy phone number, you know? Something like, (222) 222-2222.” He continues, “People would say, ‘Hey, Mitch, how do I get a hold of you?’ I’d say, ‘Just press 2 for a while, and when I answer, you will know you have pressed 2 enough.'”)\n\nSiegel produces alongside Julie Seabaugh and Becca Kinskey. Executive producers include Blieden and Jack Vaughn. Siegel is nominated for an Emmy Award at this year’s ceremony for his work on the CBS concert special Billy Joel: The 100th — Live at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe documentary about Hedberg is represented by TFC Management."
