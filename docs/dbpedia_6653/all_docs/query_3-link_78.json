        "text": "2020 has been a challenging year for us all to say the least. Our realities have been turned upside down. The world feels unsettled. And this can make us all feel rattled, stressed out, and powerless.\n\nChange is without a doubt messy and uncomfortable, and it is tempting to tune out the noise and pretend as if it’s not happening. However, for the sake of our own mental health, we have to confront change head on – and the first step in that process involves some self-reflection.\n\nSome of the questions I have been asking myself lately are:\n\nAm I doing okay?\n\nHow am I coping with the changes around me?\n\nIs there anything I can do better?\n\nAm I listening to the voices and needs of those around me?\n\nAm I doing enough to respond?\n\nI have also turned to music to help find answers to some of these questions. Here is a lighthearted playlist featuring 20 songs with profound messages about self-evaluation, change, and transformation.\n\nThe Lily-Jo Project’s Playlist for Inspiring Change\n\n#20. “Backup” – Ripe\n\nChange is not just uncomfortable – it can be scary. And we all need to lean on our pals for ‘backup’ from time to time. That’s why this newly released song from Ripe called “Backup” has made the 20th spot on this playlist.\n\nIf you are struggling with a negative inner voice that is holding you back – give this mellow tune a listen!\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nBack-up is on the way\n\nTo fight the enemy\n\nThe fear in me\n\nWhen I’m not sure about most anything\n\nI’m not afraid to call\n\nBackup is on the way\n\n#19. “What’s Going On” – Marvin Gaye\n\n“What’s Going On” by Marvin Gaye is a social justice song released in 1971 in response to a police brutality incident in the United States.\n\nThis song made our list because it is not only astonishingly relevant to the current political situation, but because it promotes love and understanding as the way to conquer hate in our world.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nWe don’t need to escalate\n\nYou see, war is not the answer\n\nFor only love can conquer hate\n\nYou know we’ve got to find a way\n\nTo bring some lovin’ here today, oh oh oh\n\nPicket lines and picket signs\n\nDon’t punish me with brutality\n\nTalk to me, so you can see\n\nOh, what’s going on\n\n#18. With My Own Two Hands – Ben Harper\n\n“With My Own Two Hands” by Ben Harper is a reggae-inspired, folk song all about how each individual has the power to change the world. This song is a great reminder that, though they may seem small, our own individual actions can actually make a massive difference.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nI can change the world, with my own two hands\n\nMake a better place, with my own two hands\n\nMake a kinder place, oh with my, with my own two hands\n\n#17. “Change” – Christina Aguilera\n\n“Change”, a mellow pop song by Christina Aguilera, takes the 17th spot on our list. This song is a reminder about why change in our world is necessary. It is too easy to turn inward, become complacent, and ignore the immense difficulties that others face. However, by staying tuned in to what’s going on and practicing empathy, we can be more proactive individuals and change the world.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nWho you love or the colour of your skin\n\nOr the place that you were born and grew up in\n\nShouldn’t decide how you will be treated\n\n‘Cause we’re all the same when everybody’s breathing\n\n#16. “Love Is Still the Answer” – Jason Mraz\n\nThe title of this song, “Love is Still the Answer” by Jason Mraz says it all. By listening to this song, we are reminded of how beautiful our world actually is. No matter how frustrated, down, or angry we are, the only way that we can move forward together as a society is to treat others with love, respect, and empathy.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nThere’s only one answer that matters\n\nEven if your heart has been shattered\n\nWhatever you want, whatever you are after\n\nLove is still the answer\n\n#15. “Living for the City” – Stevie Wonder\n\n“Living for the City” is a cry for change by the incredible musician, Stevie Wonder. Through his lyrics, he sheds light on the real challenges that people of colour face daily. This song teaches us that if we want the world to be a better place, we have to be honest with ourselves. We have to make an effort to recognize the faults in our own neighborhoods and communities – and most importantly, we have to listen to those who are struggling.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nI hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow\n\nAnd that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow\n\nThis place is cruel nowhere could be much colder\n\nIf we don’t change the world will soon be over\n\nLiving just enough, stop giving just enough for the city\n\n#14. “11:59” – Michael Franti and Spearhead\n\nIf you only had a few moments or days left to live, what would you do? Who would you spend it with? This song by Michael Franti and Spearhead makes us think about what’s really important, and that’s the health and wellbeing of the people of this world. It’s our collective common thread that should drive our actions and decisions – especially during times of change.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nOne love, one blood, one heart, one soul and one drum and only one rhythm.\n\nOne child and all of them singin.\n\nOne life, one time, one child and only one mind and one voice,\n\nstill just one moment, six billion people and all of them singing.\n\n#13. “Burning Gold” – Christina Perry\n\nBurning Gold by Christina Perry is an anthem for anyone looking for a change in their own life. Whether you are coping with an addiction, toxic people, or you just simply want a better future for yourself and your family, this song is for you.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nHoney you won’t get there if you don’t believe…\n\nI’ve had enough\n\nI’m standing up\n\nI need, I need a change\n\nI’ve had enough\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aNxhQKAXxE\n\n#12. Changes – Justin Bieber\n\nWe don’t always turn to Justin Bieber for inspiration, but “Changes” takes a raw and honest look at what it’s like to experience change and transformation in our lives. Change can make us feel vulnerable, exhausted, and overwhelmed, and sometimes we just need to take a breather. We also need to let the ones that we love know that even though we are going through changes, we still care about them.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nI just wanna be the best of me\n\nEven though sometimes, we might disagree\n\nSo that I can be the best for you\n\nThat’s all I wanna do\n\nI’m going through changes\n\nI’m going through changes\n\nThough I’m going through changes\n\nDon’t mean that I changed\n\n#11. “Where is the Love” – The Black Eyed Peas\n\n“Where is the Love” by The Black Eyed Peas was a massive hit when it came out in 2003, and the message still rings true today. We are reminded through this powerful ballad that we should still look for love, positivity, and humanity even in the most difficult times. We can all do better, we just need to embrace love.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nPeople killin’, people dyin’\n\nChildren hurt and you hear them cryin’\n\nCan you practice what you preach?\n\nAnd would you turn the other cheek?\n\nFather, father, father, help us\n\nSend some guidance from above\n\nThese people got me, got me questionin’\n\nWhere is the love?\n\n#10. “Something’s Got to Give” – Labrinth\n\nChange doesn’t just happen overnight, it takes a lot of time and an immense amount of effort. That’s why we love this song “Something’s Got to Give” by Labrinth. It’s an upbeat song that can provide motivation when you feel like throwing in the towel.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nGotta give a little more\n\nWoah, yes\n\nWhen the going gets tough\n\nGotta give a little more\n\n#9. “Stand by You” – Rachel Platten\n\n“Stand by You” is another powerful ballad that we love by Rachel Platten. Through these lyrics, we are reminded that it is important to stand up and stand by those who are hurting. Even if we are not personally struggling, we should listen, understand, and empathize with others – no matter how different they are from us.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nIf your wings are broken\n\nBorrow mine so yours can open too\n\n‘Cause I’m gonna stand by you\n\n#8. “Count on Me” – Bruno Mars\n\n“Count on Me” by Bruno Mars is a happy, mellow tune all about the importance of reminding our friends that we are there for them when they are experiencing periods of darkness. Even if we don’t completely understand what they are going through, simply saying “I’m here for you and I support you” can make a huge difference.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nIf you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea,\n\nI’ll sail the world to find you\n\nIf you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can’t see,\n\nI’ll be the light to guide you\n\nFind out what we’re made of\n\nWhen we are called to help our friends in need\n\n#7. “Put a Little Love in Your Heart” – Jackie DeShannon\n\n“Put a Little Love in Your Heart” by Jackie DeShannon is an upbeat, retro song all about the importance of simply showing love to others. We believe that living life with love and compassion is the best way to ignite real change in the world – and that’s why we’ve listed this song in our number seven spot.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nIf you want the world to know\n\nWe won’t let hatred grow\n\nPut a little love in your heart\n\n#6. “Treat People With Kindness” – Harry Styles\n\n“Treat People With Kindness” – found on Harry Styles’ latest album, is a simple reminder of the importance of being kind. Tensions are high in the world right now, but it is so important that we do not lose our sense of humanity. Be kind to one another, both online and in-person, and the world will be a better place.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nMaybe we can\n\nFind a place to feel good\n\nAnd we can treat people with kindness\n\n#5. “Stand Tall” – Childish Gambino\n\n“Stand Tall” by Childish Gambino offers us an encouraging message about standing tall and being strong in the face of adversity. We are all guilty of feeling pessimistic about the world, and this song is a great reminder that it’s okay to have dreams and to want something better for ourselves and our communities.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nKeep all your dreams, keep standing tall\n\nIf you are strong you cannot fall\n\nThere is a voice inside us all\n\nSo smile when you can\n\n#4. “You Never Let Go” – Guvna B, Travis Greene\n\nThis upbeat anthem from Guvna B and Travis Greene reminds us that no matter what we are going through, there is always someone there supporting us and cheering us along. Oftentimes change can be stressful and isolating. Never forget that there are others out there who are on our side.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nOh no, You never let go\n\nThrough the calm and through the storm\n\nOh no, You never let go\n\nIn every high and every low\n\nOh no, You never let go\n\n#3. Be the Change – Lily-Jo\n\nWe couldn’t forget our own Lily-Jo for this list! Lily-Jo’s latest single, Be The Change, is an encouraging song that celebrates the power we have within ourselves to drive change. We can all feel powerless sometimes, especially when it feels like the world is spiraling out of control. However, through Lily-Jo’s lyrics, we are reminded that we can all do our part to ‘be the change’ that we want to see in the world.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nIf we can stand together\n\nthen we can make it right\n\nIf we can fight the battle\n\nLove will win it every time\n\n#2. “Man in the Mirror” – Michael Jackson\n\n“Man in the Mirror” is no doubt a timeless classic from pop singer/songwriter Michael Jackson. This song has a very powerful message of the importance of personal reflection. If we want to make a real difference in the world, we have to be honest with ourselves – even when it makes us feel uncomfortable.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nIf you want to make the world a better place\n\nTake a look at yourself, and then make a change\n\n#1. “Change For Me” – Brasstracks with Samm Henshaw\n\n“Change For Me” takes the number one spot on our list because it’s upbeat, funky, and has a super inspiring message about how we all have to cope with change in our lives. We learn from the song’s lyrics that change is inevitable, and we have to be in tune with ourselves if we want to make a real difference in our lives and in our communities.\n\nLyrics we love:\n\nMaybe I’m stuck\n\nMaybe I’m doing too much\n\nCould have been luck\n\nBut maybe I ain’t doing enough\n\nSo safe to stay in season\n\nAs time flies so do my reasons to change for me\n\nThat’s a Wrap: What We’ve Learned\n\nThrough music, here are five things we’ve learned about mental health and coping with change:\n\nWe should approach change from a place of love and compassion for ourselves and our communities.\n\nTaking the time to listen to other people’s stories is a crucial part of the change-making process.\n\nWe must be honest with ourselves and others if we want to see real change.\n\nSmall acts of kindness often make a huge difference in the lives of others, and this can have a profound impact on the world.\n\nIt’s okay to lean on friends, family, and other support services when you feel vulnerable and uncomfortable.\n\nIf you would like to explore more of our resources on mental health, visit www.thelilyjoproject.com/#help for self-advice on depression, anxiety, childhood trauma, eating disorders, and so much more.\n\nYou may also enjoy our playlist on bravery!
