        "text": "North by Northwest: Trailer for Alfred Hitchcockâ€™s 1959 film\n\nNorth by Northwest hits TV screens today at 1:45pm on BBC Two. The iconic spy movie directed by Alfred Hitchcock has gone down in history as the \"original\" James Bond movie - but it was wrapped up in some controversy.\n\nIt all started when Hitchcock began looking at Cary Grant as the lead actor for the movie.\n\nUnfortunately for Hitchcock and Grant, there was a big problem.\n\nHitchcock had previously promised James Stewart the role of the protagonist, Roger Thornhill.\n\nSome reports claim the director \"accidentally\" promised the role to Stewart.\n\nBut either way, Hitchcock had to get rid of Stewart any way he could to bring Grant onto the picture.\n\nSo he got a bit devious.\n\nHitchcock knew Stewart's schedule, so he looked at what filming was coming up for him.\n\nHe noted that Stewart was about to start filming his 1959 movie Anatomy of a Murder.\n\nBecause of this, he knew he could create a clash.\n\nHe purposefully delayed the shooting of North by Northwest so that Stewart's filming would begin to run into his new movie.\n\nREAD MORE: Cary Grant behind Alfred Hitchcock's audacious 'double bluff'\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
