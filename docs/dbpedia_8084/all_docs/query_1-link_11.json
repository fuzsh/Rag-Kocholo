Thornhill, a hapless New York advertising executive who’s mistaken for a government agent by a group of foreign spies and is forced to go on the lam with an American agent (Eva Marie Saint). Hitchcock’s sure-handed comic drama pits Grant against a crop duster and lands him in a fight for his life on Mount Rushmore — a true cliffhanger if ever there was one."
