        "text": "Almost every preview of “North by Northwest” shows the classic shots of Cary Grant running from the crop duster or climbing down the faces of Mount Rushmore.\n\nThis was one of the Alfred Hitchcock films I had not seen before, and I expected another classic thriller with those action-packed scenes prominently on display. I was, however, completely overlooking another — dare I say better — aspect of the movie.\n\nWhile there were plenty of scenic adventure sequences throughout the movie, the real fun was in the dialogue.\n\nFrom the opening shot, “North by Northwest” established itself as a beautiful scenic film. Throughout the movie, I was impressed by the big city shots, the vast, empty fields where Cary Grant runs from the killer crop dusting plane and, of course, the final scenes scaling Mount Rushmore. If any part of this movie was made better on the big screen, this would definitely be it.\n\nBut what really surprised me was the amount of laughter I heard in the theater. I had grown up around Hitchcock classics such as “Psycho” and “The Birds,” where comedy wasn’t exactly prominent in the script. Even in “Rear Window,” which had a few good laughs in it, there was still more of an ominous sense of danger. But “North by Northwest” felt different from other Hitchcock films.\n\nCary Grant’s character, Roger Thornhill, is mistaken for a imaginary agent, and in all his confusion and frustration, he uses his dry sense of humor as his go-to remark. When he is dangling off the edge of Mount Rushmore, Thornhill mentions his two ex-wives divorced him because he “led too dull a life.” Even as the danger got more and more deadly and Thornhill got into more and more trouble, I never felt like he was actually anywhere near death. This advertising guy was way too funny to be brutally murdered by spies.\n\nThough this film definitely leaned more toward other action spy movies than most Hitchcock films, there still wasn’t enough danger to be truly life-threatening to Thornhill. The primary gun used in the movie was always filled with blanks, and Thornhill never got into a big fight with another spy, like what you might see in other action spy movies. Instead, Thornhill just ran a lot. He even climbed down the side of George Washington’s face without really having to fight.\n\nBut I don’t think “North by Northwest” would have been as good if it had been any other way. We wouldn’t want to see Thornhill fight or fire a gun like he was James Bond. Hitchcock wrote a character that wasn’t an action hero or a super spy. Any audience member in the theater probably would have stood just as much of a chance against the foreign spies as Thornhill did. All he used was some improvisation to make the spies think he was who they believed he was. That, and the off-handed humor we all love so much.\n\nThough most of us automatically associate the movie with the most action-packed parts of the film, we are missing the key element of the film.\n\nBig impressive scenery doesn’t always make or break a movie. Though the shots and imagery in “North by Northwest” are great, Hitchcock made a classic simply out of a plot with a big misunderstanding and a protagonist that was willing to go with the flow and give us some good dialogue along the way.\n\nJulia Ferrell is still suspicious of every crop duster she sees.
