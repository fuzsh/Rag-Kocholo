        "text": "Newly restored 70mm print screening July 23-25 only!\n\nSixty-five years ago, Alfred Hitchcock released his stylish, brilliantly self-parodic espionage thriller, which changed every Hollywood action production in its wake. This summer, for three days only, it returns to Film at Lincoln Center on a newly restored 70mm print. A successful, handsome Madison Avenue executive (Cary Grant) is mistaken for a Fed by foreign agents (led by James Mason, villainously debonair) and pushed into a cross-country medley of imposing set pieces. Wryly referred to as the first James Bond film, this VistaVision marvel deploys the director’s familiar-sounding The Wrong Man plot structure but exaggerates every detail—including Bernard Herrmann’s kaleidoscopic score and Saul Bass’s kinetic opening title sequence—on a dizzying scale, taking us everywhere from the posh and modernist interiors of New York City and Chicago to a vast, flat, Midwestern cornfield to, finally, the gigantic faces of Mount Rushmore above Rapid City."
