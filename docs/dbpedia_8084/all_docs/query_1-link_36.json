        "text": "There are easier ways to see America than to stow away on a Chicago-bound train, dodge a biplane in an Indiana cornfield, and scramble down the face of Mount Rushmore.\n\nBut not for Alfred Hitchcock.\n\n\"North by Northwest,\" often described as the \"quintessential\" Hitchcock thriller, was one of several Hitchcock movies that were almost like perverse travelogues. \"The 39 Steps\" (1935) sent its hero racing across England and Scotland. \"Saboteur\" (1942) was a cross-country chase that began in California and ended in New York (the villain winds up dangling from the Statue of Liberty). And in \"North by Northwest,\" Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), an ordinary New York ad man, finds himself mistaken for a spy and goes on the lam, simultaneously dodging the police and chasing after the real spies as they head — yes — north by northwest.\n\nThe hugely entertaining 1959 film, a staple of must-see lists, is getting a two-day theatrical revival thanks to Fathom Events and TCM Big Screen Classics. Turner Classic Movies host Ben Mankiewicz will provide wraparound commentary. Locally, you can see screenings in Wayne, Clifton and Paramus on April 2 and 5.\n\nLots has been written about \"North by Northwest,\" not only about the expert direction of Hitchcock, but also the witty screenplay by Ernest Lehman, the nervy score by Bernard Herrmann, the memorable performances by Grant, Eva Marie Saint, James Mason and Martin Landau (in an early role). It's been said that the film inspired the \"James Bond\" franchise, and that the helicopter attack in \"From Russia, with Love,\" in particular, was a swipe of the famous crop-duster sequence in \"North by Northwest.\" One NPR commentator even did an entire feature on Cary Grant's gray suit, which weathers the film's adventures with the same aplomb as Grant himself.\n\n\"North by Northwest.\" 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. April 2 and April 5 at Wayne 14, 67 Willowbrook Blvd., Wayne; Clifton Commons 16, 405 Route 3 east, Clifton; and Garden State 16, 1 Garden State Plaza, routes 4 and 17, Paramus.
