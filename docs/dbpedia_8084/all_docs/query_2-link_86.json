        "text": "On the evening of November 24, 1971—the day before Thanksgiving—a dark-haired man dressed in a black raincoat, dark suit and thin, black tie, white shirt, and brown loafers approached the Northwest Orient Airlines desk at Portland International Airport and purchased a $20, one-way ticket on Flight 305 to Seattle. In an era in which proof of identity for travel was not required, the man signed the ticket “Dan Cooper” (a reporter later mistakenly referred to him as “D.B. Cooper”). He boarded the sparsely-filled plane, sitting alone in the back row, and ordered a bourbon and soda, and then handed the stewardess a note claiming that he had a bomb. The man later parachuted from the plan, holding onto $200,000 in cash, somewhere over the Oregon-Washington border, never to be seen again. The incident remains the only unsolved airline hijacking in history.\n\nIf you’re a fan of Cary Grant, or the 1959 movie North by Northwest, then this essay may actually be of interest in a humorous or possibly serious way. North by Northwest is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, as well as one of the greatest train & railroad related films of all time. The name of the film has even been said to be a reference to Northwest Airlines. The main character even looks like D.B. Cooper with his sunglasses, olive skin, and dark suit & tie. Whoever wrote the letters to Max Gunther had a flair for dramatics. So, using this famous film as a part of the hijacking might not be so hard to believe.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nNorth by Northwest is a 1959 American thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint, and James Mason. The screenplay was by Ernest Lehman, who wanted to write “the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures.”\n\nNorth by Northwest is a tale of mistaken identity, with an innocent man pursued across the United States by agents of a mysterious organization trying to prevent him from blocking their plan to smuggle out microfilm which contains government secrets.\n\nNorth by Northwest is listed among the canonical Hitchcock films of the 1950s and is often listed among the greatest films of all time. It was selected in 1995 for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress as being “culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.”*\n\nThere are a number of parts about the D.B. Cooper hijacking that seem out of place, and even almost staged (the sunglasses, the dyed black hair, hiding in the lavatory, the flight attendant lighting his cigarettes). In the movie North by Northwest there are a series of scenes and lines that make me think that D.B. Cooper was a fan of the film. North by Northwest begins in New York City, and is even filmed at Grand Central, just a few miles from where William J. Smith worked. The main character is a dapper middle aged man with olive skin, slicked black hair, a dark suit, black tie, and dark sunglasses. He is running from the FBI, yet ends up helping the government in the end.\n\nPictures are more telling here than words, so most of this essay will be photos.\n\nBourbon plays a big role in this movie, just like in the D.B. Cooper hijacking. Here Roger Thornhill (played by Cary Grant) is forced to drink a bottle of bourbon. Later in the film he will order bourbon to calm his nerves in the hospital. Also, he is here with his mother Clara pointing out the perpetrators. Clara is the same name used in the letter to Max Gunther, and one of the main characters in his book. Clara is played by Jessie Royce Landis, who coincidentally lived in the same town as author Max Gunther in Ridgefield, CT.\n\nRoger Thornhill is falsely accused of murdering a diplomat. The newspaper headline from November 25, 1958 describes the crime and the manhunt. Exactly 13 years later, in 1971 on the same day, the headlines will tell of the hijacker D.B. Cooper. Could D.B. Cooper have chosen the night of November 24th for a reason? One of the busiest travel days of the year (with an almost half moon) is an odd choice to hijack a plane.\n\nHere Roger Thornhill is talking to his mother Clara from Grand Central. The dialogue goes like this:\n\n“I’ll take the train, it’s safer”…“Because there is no place to hide on a plane if anyone should recognize me”…“You want me to jump off a moving plane?”\n\nFollowing the murder, Roger Thornhill escapes by train at Grand Central in New York City. He is now wearing sunglasses as a disguise, tries to buy a ticket in his gray suit & black tie, and boards a New York Central Railroad train.\n\nOn the train Roger Thornhill meets a beautiful blonde woman, they spend the rest of the film together. Here he is having cigarettes with her, just like D.B. Cooper with the attractive blonde flight attendant Tina Mucklow on Flight 305. Tina lit D.B. Cooper’s cigarettes, here Roger Thornhill lights Eve Kendall’s.\n\nDuring the train ride, Roger Thornhill hides in the lavatory while law enforcement and train personnel are looking for him. D.B. Cooper unusually went into the lavatory while Flight 305 was on the tarmac in Seattle. This act seemed out of place, and was more than just to use the toilet.\n\nHere is another coincidence from the movie and the hijacking. Roger Thornhill is seen here walking through the ticket area for Northwest Orient Airlines, the same airline that D.B. Cooper would hijack in 1971. D. B. Cooper had a choice of a number of airlines he could have hijacked, yet he chose Northwest Orient.\n\nTowards the end of the film, Roger Thornhill communicates with Eve Kendall using a note written on a matchbook. Could this be similar to the note D.B. Cooper used to communicate with the flight attendants on Flight 305?\n\nAt the end of the film Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall are hanging from Mount Rushmore. The dialogue goes as follows:\n\nRoger Thornhill: “If we ever get out this alive, let’s go back to New York on a train”\n\nEve Kendall: “Is that a proposition?”\n\nRoger Thornhill: “It’s a proposal sweetie”\n\nThey end up surviving and the movie ends on a Southern Pacific Railroad train heading south.\n\nDid North by Northwest in some way play a role in the D.B. Cooper hijacking? Maybe, maybe not. It would be an interesting twist if so. Another coincidence related to Cary Grant is from the 1955 Alfred Hitchcock movie To Catch a Thief starring Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, and Jessie Royce Landis (again). Bourbon plays a role in this film as well. Also, Cary Grant’s character uses an alias Mr. Smith, who happens to be from Portland, Oregon. Coincidently, actress Jessie Royce Landis appears in both films, as well as the 1970 film Airport about a man who hijacks an airplane using a briefcase bomb. Jessie Royce Landis lived in Ridgefield, CT, down the street from Max Gunther who wrote “DB Cooper: What Really Happened.” Ridgefield was also the setting for the fictitious town named Bridgefield in Cary Grant’s film “In Name Only.”\n\nRepublished with gracious permission from dbcooperhijack.com.\n\nThe Imaginative Conservative applies the principle of appreciation to the discussion of culture and politics—we approach dialogue with magnanimity rather than with mere civility.
