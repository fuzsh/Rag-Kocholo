        "text": "In spite of a few flaws, North by Northwest remains an unqualified triumph. It’s got some of the best humor, dark and otherwise, in any Hitchcock film and it never lags for a second of its run time.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A | Jul 25, 2024\n\nAn effortless two hours and sixteen minutes of classic set-pieces, unlikely traps and amusingly off-the-cuff escapes, all starring the handsomest tan ever to step onto a film set.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Feb 11, 2024\n\nIt’s lighter, flashier, and more stylish than some of Hitch’s other classics, but those are the things that make it a unique but fitting part of Hitchcock’s wonderful filmography.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | Aug 24, 2022\n\nIt is consistently entertaining, its excitement pointed by but never interrupted by the jokes... But it is on Mr. Grant's own performance, intent, resourceful, witty, as always beautifully timed, that a large part of the pleasure depends.\n\nFull Review | Aug 10, 2022\n\nThough not as cleverly original as Strangers on a Train, or as cleverly sexy as Notorious, this is one of Hitchcock’s most entertaining American thrillers.\n\nFull Review | Jul 6, 2022\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's new thriller, North by Northwest, is one of those no holds barred films. For better than two hours, he lets the Technicolor melodrama ramble across the VistaVision screen while gleefully setting traps for his hero.\n\nFull Review | Jun 9, 2021\n\n[North by Northwest] gives Grant full play in the sort of role he does best -- and has the added virtue of being done by the master of suspense.\n\nFull Review | Jun 9, 2021\n\nThe brilliant director has outdone himself by piling thrill on thrill for the delectation of an enraptured audience.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jun 9, 2021\n\nYou get a lot of entertainment for your money. You get a couple of clever, sophisticated screen actors and an elegant actress with a fine-drawn, exciting face. You get one scene that will be talked about as long as people talk about films at all.\n\nFull Review | Jun 9, 2021\n\nThe acting in North by Northwest has that brilliant, cool surface that represents the perfect polish for the best of Hitchcock. Grant, to be sure, is the director's Number 1 hand at this sort of thing. Mason, nevertheless, comes close to matching him.\n\nFull Review | Jun 8, 2021\n\nVery little of it makes sense, but no matter. From the moment Mr. Cary Grant, a Madison Avenue advertising man, is kidnaped by a band of foreign agents who think he's someone else, North By Northwest stays on a rollercoaster that operates on laughing gas.\n\nFull Review | Jun 8, 2021\n\nGrant's technique, so well established, shines brightly under Hitchcock's guidance. The two seem completely en rapport in movie making. Miss Saint, effective in her former sweet or drab roles, makes the switch to glamour as a lovely Mata Hari type.\n\nFull Review | Jun 8, 2021"
