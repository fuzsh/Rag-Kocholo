        "text": "Your travel insurance could be invalidated if you travel against advice from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).\n\nAreas where FCDO advises against travel\n\nFCDO advises against all travel to Burkina Faso, except to the capital, Ouagadougou.\n\nFCDO advises against all but essential travel to Ouagadougou, up to the toll booths on all roads out of the city.\n\nThis is due to the threat of terrorist attacks and terrorist kidnap, and the unstable political situation in the country.\n\nFind out more about why FCDO advises against travel.\n\nSecurity situation in Burkina Faso\n\nThe security situation in Burkina Faso has deteriorated significantly in recent years and remains volatile. The political situation also remains unstable following the military coup on 30 September 2022. Further coups are possible. If you choose to travel to Burkina Faso, you should remain vigilant and monitor local media.\n\nLimited consular support\n\nThere is no British Embassy in Burkina Faso and all consular support is provided from the British Embassy in Accra, Ghana. They cannot provide in-person assistance.\n\nIf there is serious violence, unrest or a deterioration in the security situation, it could be difficult to leave safely. Do not rely on the British government to evacuate you as they may not be able to do so. Have your own plans on how you would leave the country, make sure you keep all travel documentation up to date and monitor the local situation.\n\nBefore you travel\n\nNo travel can be guaranteed safe. Read all the advice in this guide. You may also find it helpful to:\n\nsee general advice for women travellers\n\nread our guide on disability and travel abroad\n\nsee general advice for LGBT+ travellers\n\nread about safety for solo and independent travel\n\nsee advice on volunteering and adventure travel abroad\n\nTravel insurance\n\nIf you choose to travel despite FCDO advice, research your destinations and get appropriate travel insurance. Insurance should cover your itinerary, planned activities and expenses in an emergency.\n\nAbout FCDO travel advice\n\nFCDO provides advice about risks of travel to help you make informed decisions.
