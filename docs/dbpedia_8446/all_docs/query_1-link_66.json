        "text": "During a trip to Burkina Faso and Benin, German Development Minister Svenja Schulze visited a media project of DW Akademie and its local partner Fasocheck in the Burkinabe capital Ouagadougou on Tuesday, March 5, 2024. Fasocheck is an established local organization working on news verification and also trains media professionals in fact-checking. Their work ensures that more journalists are better equipped to combat growing disinformation in the country and can provide the population with reliable information.\n\nGerman Development Minister Svenja Schulze: \"Targeted disinformation endangers our democracies, our open societies and our mutual peace. This is true for us in Germany, and also for Burkina Faso and other West African countries. That's why we support local organizations that check facts, train journalists and teach media skills, thus making an important contribution to development and peace.\"\n\nIn terms of press freedom, Burkina Faso has long been considered one of Africa's success stories. However, in the current press freedom ranking by Reporters Without Borders, the country has recently slipped 17 places and is now ranked 58th out of 180. Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world and is situated in a region characterized by political instability, Islamist terror and the consequences of climate change. The security situation ̶ including for media professionals ̶ has deteriorated dramatically in recent years. In addition, journalists are generally paid very little, driving many to be dependent on paid reporting. A high illiteracy rate and a lack of access to information ̶ especially in rural areas ̶ means that many people are susceptible to rumors and manipulation.\n\nThe German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) has been supporting DW Akademie's long-term projects for freedom of expression and media development in the Sahel region since 2015. The focus in Burkina Faso is on training media professionals and developing dialogue formats that enable disadvantaged population groups to participate and access reliable information. DW Akademie also works to strengthen the media skills of young people here and in the neighboring countries of Mali and Niger.\n\nBoureima Salouka, Project Manager at DW Akademie in Burkina Faso: \"Well-trained journalists, media users who can distinguish fact from fiction and innovative dialogue formats strengthen social cohesion. Together they enable a constructive exchange of arguments in the spirit of an open, pluralistic society.\"\n\nIsidor Bouda, Managing Director of Fasocheck: \"We counter hate speech with verified facts. Quality journalism makes an important contribution, especially in crisis situations, to contextualizing news events, promoting mutual understanding and fostering public, fact-based debate.\"\n\nAbout DW Akademie\n\nDW Akademie is Deutsche Welle's center for international media development, journalism training and knowledge transfer.
