        "text": "Overview: Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that depends on adequate rainfall. About 90% of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture and cotton is the main cash crop. The country has few natural resources and a weak industrial base. Cotton and gold are key exports. Since 1998, Burkina Faso has begun to privatize state-owned enterprises and in 2004 revised its investment code to attract foreign investment. As a result, the country has seen an upswing in gold exploration, production, and export. The Burkinabe economy experienced high levels of growth over the last few years but growth is highly dependent on swings in gold and cotton prices. In 2013 Burkina Faso experienced a number of public protests over the cost of living, corruption, and other socioeconomic issues. To defuse tensions the government has offered higher housing bonuses, reduced income taxes, and price controls. Turmoil in neighboring Mali, unreliable energy supplies, and poor transportation links pose longer-term challenges.\n\nGross Domestic Product:\n\nGDP (PPP): $26.51 billion (global rank: 123)\n\nGDP per capita (PPP):$1,500 (global rank: 203)\n\nreal growth rate: 6.5% (global rank: 29)\n\ncomposition by sector: agriculture: 33.6%, industry: 23.6%, services: 42.8%\n\nCurrency:\n\ncurrency: Communaute Financiere Africaine Francs (XOF)\n\nexchange rate (per US Dollar): 500.7\n\nPoverty:\n\npopulation below poverty line: 46.7%\n\nunemployment rate: 77%\n\nAgricultural Products:\n\ncotton, peanuts, shea nuts, sesame, sorghum, millet, corn, rice; livestock\n\nIndustries:\n\ncotton lint, beverages, agricultural processing, soap, cigarettes, textiles, gold\n\nExports Commodities:\n\ncotton, livestock, gold\n\nImports Commodities:"
