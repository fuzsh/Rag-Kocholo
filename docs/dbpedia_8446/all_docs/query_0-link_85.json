        "text": "• Market Management: The issue of the commercialisation of food products is at the centre of municipal policy.\n\n• School Feeding Programme challenges: Concerns regarding food availability in schools, and in most cases, the meals served are not nutritious and diversified.\n\n• Urban Agriculture and Land Use: The availability of land is a major issue due to urban sprawl.\n\n• Multi-stakeholder governance: Most of the city’s food system players (civil society organisations, NGOs, decentralised technical services, and private operators) know and talk to each other.\n\n• Malnutrition and childhood stunting: The city has one of the country’s lowest malnutrition rates, not only because it is the capital city but also because of its role as an economic hub and crossroads.\n\n• Climate change and extreme weather events: Producers consistently implement strategies to mitigate frequent dry spells caused by climate change. These initiatives include constructing small wells for water retention, employing organic manure to enrich the soil, adopting drip irrigation to conserve water, and more."
