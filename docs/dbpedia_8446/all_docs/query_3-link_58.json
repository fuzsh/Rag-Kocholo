        "text": "Day 1\n\nArrival in the capital, Ouagadougou, whose name tastes particularly good to many foreigners. Ouagadougou is located in central Burkina Faso and has a population of around 2.5 million. We will transfer you to your hotel and, depending on your arrival time, we can either take you on a city tour or at least pop in for an evening of live music or otherwise enjoy a drink in the evening in Ouagadougou. We can also explore the city on your return journey, depending on your flight schedule. We stay overnight in Ouagadougou.\n\nDay 2\n\nFrom Ouagadougou, we head towards Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso's second largest city. It's about 360 kilometres, or just over five hours, to the city. Often known simply as \"Bobo\", the town is a major centre of the textile industry and has also gained a reputation as a cultural city with its various festivals. Bobo is also home to around one million inhabitants, most of whom belong to the Bobo ethnic group.\n\nThe atmosphere in Bobo-Dioulasso is relaxed and there is plenty to see. We visit the city museum to learn about Bobo culture. For example, we will see the home of a Bobo family, which are often still inhabited by ordinary people outside the city. The main attraction is the 19th century Grand Mosque, also known as the Dioulassoba Mosque. Built of mud and wood, it is an excellent example of the architectural tradition of the Sahel region. We enter the obscure mosque, which is still in active use.\n\nThe small old town of Kibidwe in Bobo-Dioulasso is located immediately next to the Grand Mosque. Kibidwe is divided into four parts, quarters, based on their inhabitants. Visiting the Animist, Muslim, Griot and Blacksmith quarters, we see that the old town is like a living museum, as all the houses are still inhabited. Even in the oldest house, which dates back to the 1000s. We stay overnight in Bobo-Dioulasso.\n\nDay 3\n\nAfter breakfast, we drive just under two hours to Banfora, home to just over 100 000 people. The city is powered by the sugar cane industry and we see a large number of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Banfora.\n\nBanfora usually attracts all travellers to Burkina Faso, as there are many interesting things to see in the surrounding area. We will visit Lake Tengrela, home to hippos. We will take a boat trip on the lake. Seeing hippos depends largely on the time of year, with less chance of seeing them during the rainy season, for example. We visit the nearby village of Toumousseni to see the sacred baobab tree. To the west of Banfora is the Karfigu√©la waterfall, which we visit, as well as the Fabedougou rock formations, which are around two million years old. We stay overnight in Banfora.\n\nDay 4\n\nToday we return to Ouagadougou, which is about 440 kilometres from Banfora. It takes between seven and eight hours. Depending on your flight schedule, we can now continue exploring Ouagadougou, after which we will take you to your hotel or airport."
