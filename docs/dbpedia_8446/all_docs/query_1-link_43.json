The book also listed the “The Places to go in Ouagadougou,” such as: an artisan village, gift shops, an animal reserve (zoo), a sculpture symposium, gardens and parks, markets, flea markets, churches and mosques, and city parks.\n\nThere were no places listed for cheap travelers like me, so I went to the nearby bus station and asked for help. Luckily, a French backpacker who spoke better English than I did French, and I ended up sharing a room near the train station.\n\nI ate dinner, walked to the train station, and bought tickets to Abidjan in the nation of Ivory Coast.\n\nNext Week: Abidjan"
