        "text": "Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa. It is bordered by Niger in the east, Benin in the southeast, Togo and Ghana and Ivory Coast in the south, and in the west and north by Mali.\n\nThe country consists, for the most part, of a vast lateritic plateau in the West African savanna, approximately 650-1000 ft above sea level. This plateau is slightly inclined toward the south and notched by valleys formed by the three principal rivers, the Black, White and Red Voltas, and their main tributary, the Sourou. These rivers flow southward and meet in Ghana. They are alternately dry or in flood and all are unnavigable. In general, the land is dry and poor."
