        "text": "Burkina Faso's self-declared leader says the man he ousted a day ago in a coup is plotting a counter-attack.\n\nCapt Ibrahim Traoré also accused the French army of harbouring Lt Col Paul-Henri Damiba at one of its bases - but France denies any involvement.\n\nGunshots were heard in Burkina Faso's capital city Ouagadougou on Saturday and helicopters have circled overhead.\n\nProtesters started a fire outside the French embassy - an attack condemned \"with the greatest firmness\" by Paris.\n\nThe French foreign ministry told AFP news agency that the security of its compatriots was the greatest priority, adding that a crisis centre had been opened in Ouagadougou.\n\nEarlier, witnesses said troops blocked main roads around the city and shops that had been open were later shut.\n\nIn the country's second city, Bobo-Dioulasso, the gate of the French Institute was also reportedly set ablaze by protesters.\n\nFriday's apparent takeover had been announced on state TV and was the second time this year that the country's army had seized power.\n\nOn both occasions the coup leaders said they had to step in because national security was so dire.\n\nBurkina Faso controls as little as 60% of its territory, experts say, and Islamist violence is worsening. Since 2020 more than a million people have been displaced in the country due to the violence.\n\nThe African Union has demanded the return of constitutional order by July 2023 at the latest, agreeing with the regional group Ecowas that the ousting of leader Lt Col Damiba was \"unconstitutional\".\n\nEcowas earlier said it was \"inappropriate\" for army rebels to seize power when the country was working towards civilian rule.\n\nThe latest international criticism has come from the UN, whose chief António Guterres says he \"strongly condemns\" the coup.\n\nFor the second time in under 24 hours the coup leaders have issued a statement on state TV, signed by their leader Capt Traoré.\n\nThis time they claimed Lt Damiba was planning a counter-attack because of their own willingness to work with new partners in their fight against the Islamists. The statement did not name these potential new partners, but rights groups say troops in neighbouring Mali have been working closely with Russian mercenaries from the Wagner group - although both nations deny this.\n\nOn Friday evening flanked by rebel soldiers in fatigues and black facemasks, an officer had read an announcement on national TV stating that they were kicking out Lt Damiba, dissolving the government and suspending the constitution.\n\nThat statement was also read on behalf of Capt Traoré, who said Lt Col Damiba's inability to deal with an Islamist insurgency was to blame.\n\n\"Our people have suffered enough, and are still suffering\", he said.\n\nLittle is known about Capt Traoré, the 34-year-old soldier who led an anti-jihadist unit in the north called Cobra.\n\nHis statement effectively declared himself the interim leader of Burkina Faso. But in Friday's announcement came the promise that the \"driving forces of the nation\" would in time be brought together to appoint a new civilian or military president and a new \"transitional charter\".\n\nBack in January, Lt Col Damiba's junta overthrew President Roch Kaboré and his elected government, saying they had failed to deal with Islamist violence. Lt Col Damiba told citizens \"we have more than what it takes to win this war.\"\n\nBut his administration has also not been able to quell the jihadist violence. Analysts told the BBC recently that Islamist insurgents were encroaching on territory, and military leaders had failed in their attempts to bring the military under a single unit of command.\n\nOn Monday, 11 soldiers were killed when they were escorting a convoy of civilian vehicles in Djibo in the north of the country.\n\nMany citizens feel no safer under military rule, and there have been protests in different parts of the country this week."
