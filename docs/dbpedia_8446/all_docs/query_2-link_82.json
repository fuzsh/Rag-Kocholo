        "text": "An itinerary that leads the capital of Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou, to Accra, the capital of Ghana. Two neighboring countries, but with cultural legacies linked to colonialism, very different from each other.\n\nIf Burkina Faso falls within the sphere of influence of the French-speaking world, when you cross the border, you immediately feel a political-economic management, which is affected by the former English mother-country. However, in the border regions there is a cultural continuity that goes back to a common substrate of the pre-colonial era, demonstrating how well the traditions have remained in the two countries. It is precisely the traditions, the true cultural richness of these two countries. In the Burkinabé region of Tiebelé, and in the Ghanaian region of Bolgatanga, the wonderful houses painted and shaped with clay, recall African fairytale atmospheres. It is the savannah of baobabs and the last colonies of elephants, animist traditions and the cult of fetishes. It is necessary to arrive in the very green central region of Kumasi to perceive a greater influence of colonialism and conversion to Christianity. But even here the ancestral traditions of the rich and powerful Ashanti lords have survived intact to this day. It is the region of traditional ceremonies, which for centuries have celebrated the splendor and glories of the Ashanti kings, holders of the monopoly of gold mines, and once also that of slaves, who were sold to European slavers, who sailed with their loaded ships, from the castles of Elmina and Cape Coast.\n\nDay 1 :\n\nItaly/Ouagadougou\n\nWelcome and transfer to the hotel.\n\nDay 2 :\n\nOuagadougou/Sabou/Bobo Dioulasso\n\nThe sacred caiman lake of Sabou and the lively town of Bobo-Dioulasso.\n\nDay 3 :\n\nBobo Dioulasso/Sindou/Banfora\n\nThe peaks of Sindou, the troglodyte village of Niansogoni and the Hippos of Tengrela.\n\nDay 4 :\n\nBanfora/Pays Lobi/Gaoua\n\nThe animist traditions of the Lobi, the houses of fetishes and the soukhala, clay fortresses.\n\nDay 5 :\n\nGaoua/Leo/Nazinga\n\nSafari in search of elephants in the Nazinga Ranch.\n\nDay 6 :\n\nNazinga/Tiebelé/Po/Sirigu/Bolgatanga\n\nThe decorated villages of the Gourounsi, on both sides of the border.\n\nDay 7 :\n\nBolgatanga/Tongo Hills/Tamale\n\nThe Telensi villages and the powerful fetishes of Tengzug.\n\nDay 8 :\n\nTamale/Techiman/Kumasi\n\nThe Kintampo waterfall and the Techiman fruit and vegetable market.\n\nDay 9 :\n\nKumasi\n\nThe Kejetia market, craft villages, Ashanti funerals and voodoo ceremonies.\n\nDay 10 :\n\nKumasi (Akwasidae)/Anomabu\n\nKing Ashanti’s exciting festival, before heading down to the palm-fringed beaches of Anomabu.\n\nDay 11 :\n\nAnomabu/Elmina/Cape Coast/Accra\n\nMemories of the slave trade in the castles of Cape Coast and Elmina.\n\nDay 12 :\n\nAccra/Italy\n\nArrival at the destination airport."
