        "text": "Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in western Africa. A former French colony, the name Burkina Faso means \"Land of Incorruptible People.\" About nine-tenths of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture or livestock raising. Difficult economic conditions, made worse by severe intermittent droughts, have provoked considerable migration from rural to urban areas within Burkina Faso and neighboring countries. Furthermore, Burkina Faso is located in a region where Islamist groups have a vast and growing influence.\n\nThe central government is fragile, particularly in the east of the country, where Islamic law is informally implemented by Jihadi groups that have gained control. On January 23rd, 2022, Burkina Faso's army announced on state television that it had ousted President Kabore, suspended the constitution, dissolved the government, and closed its borders. The announcement described Kabore's inability to unite the West African nation and effectively respond to critical challenges, including the Islamist insurgency.\n\nNow is the time to stand for Burkina Faso and pray for the church in the country to stand firm and cling fast to the imperishable, undefiled, and unfading inheritance waiting for the \"Incorruptible ones\" in heaven. Ouagadougou, pronounced wa-ga-du-gu, is the capital and largest town of Burkina Faso."
