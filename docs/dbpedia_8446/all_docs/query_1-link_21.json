        "text": "When?\n\nOur operations in Burkina Faso started in the capital, Ouagadougou in 2001. With so much need identified, the work rapidly expanded to 11 districts, across the country. By 2017, 425 children had benefitted from full scholarship and /or from our welfare projects. The attainment rates of our supported children is among the highest across the 8 countries where work, in 2017 boasting a 90% completion rate for secondary school with about 20 university students and graduates.\n\nWe launched the Sustainable Whole Life Skills Training Programme in 2007 with initial grants from a UK charitable trust alongside funds raised from individuals and fundraising events. The project helped fund the development of training materials and manuals which are in English and French and have been translated to local languages in communities around the 8 African countries where we work.\n\nACT Facts:\n\nSince 2000 a total of 114 orphan children have been educated across the country. More than 90 percent have completed secondary school of which 12 attended university and 4 have graduated. Nearly 300 women have benefited from the ACT Widowâ€™s project and received training in business skills so they can generate sustainable income. A significant number of the widows have set up their own enterprises successfully. Read the story of Collette.\n\nIn 2011 ACT formed partnership with Samaritan Purse (Operation Christmas Child). Since then, ACT children have each year received a present at Christmas as part of the Operation Christmas Child.\n\nOur Projects:"
