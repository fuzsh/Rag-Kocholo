        "meta_description": "Burkina Faso</span><span> is a </span><span>landlocked country</span><span> in </span><span>West Africa</span><span>. In recent years, the government has made education in general, and youth entrepreneurship and vocational training in particular, a budgetary priority, efforts bolstered by an unprecedented influx of aid to the sector. The economic growth rate is high; Burkina Faso has a wealth of natural resources and there is a growing food processing industry and a nascent tech sector. Other bright spots include high rates of social media use amongst youth, growing mobile and internet phone penetration, and an active culture of youth associations. Above all, the energy and dynamism of the youth themselves present a significant source of untapped potential for future growth.",

        "text": "Opportunities for the vast majority of young people are limited. An underdeveloped private sector offers few options, the portfolio of work activities influenced by the seasonal agricultural calendar and migration. Agriculture dominates the economy, but training in the agro-sylvo-pastoral field is under-resourced, and despite its potential, the majority of young people do not perceive agriculture as a rewarding option.\n\nSwisscontact is developing market-friendly and contextual vocational training that meets local developmental needs and ensures participation and inclusion of local stakeholders.\n\nSwisscontact contributes to the improvement of the living conditions of rural youth, by the establishment of training-systems and the integration of trained youths into the labour market."
