        "text": "Burkina Faso is a land-locked country in the heart of the West African savanna. The country's name, which means \"land of the proud and honest people,\" was adopted in 1984. The name combines key words from the three main local languages. A total of sixty different language groups are recognized within the country's boundaries.\n\nA former colony of France, Burkina Faso was previously known as Upper Volta, a name that reflected the importance of the local Red, Black, and White Volta Rivers. As a result of colonization, the political, economic, and educational systems of the country are of French origin. The official language is French."
