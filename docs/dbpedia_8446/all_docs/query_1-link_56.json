        "text": "Burkina Faso, literally âthe land of upright people,â has a population of 13.6 million, a landlocked nation in West Africa, south of the Sahara, and a country known for its simple and hard-working national character. Thirty percent of its citizens are Muslim and many local languages are spoken including MoorÃ© and Dioula in addition to the official language which is French. Burkina Faso is subject to extreme heat during its dry season and is said to be one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\nThe country is still relatively new to JICA projects; Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers (JOCV) was dispatched the first in 2000. The local JOCV coordination office became a JICA branch in April 2006."
