        "text": "Ouagadougou in five words\n\nHospitality, culture, singed chickens, mopeds\n\nSound of the city\n\nThis sound conveys all the activities in the great Rood Wooko market of Ouagadougou. Located in the middle of the city, it is the centre of social activity, culture and trade. Butchers, clothing vendors, electrical shops, salons – you name it, it’s got it. In the clip you can hear the call of street vendors, the honking of vehicles and the sound of customers arguing for the best price.\n\nBest building\n\nThis hall of fame is located at the end of boulevard Muammar Gaddafi. Originally called the Memorial to National Heroes, it was renamed the Hall of Martyrs in May 2015 in homage to the victims of the popular uprising in Burkina Faso, and in memory of those who died.\n\nWhat this city does better than anywhere else\n\nThe kitchen is rich and varied in Burkina, and during a trip to Ouaga, you should sink your teeth into the singed chicken known as poulet bicyclette. This delicious dish can be eaten with different vegetables accompanied by Brakina, the local beer, or various other natural juices (tamarind and tropical fruits juices). Boiled beans, peas and other leaf dishes are also local delicacies. You can order these in restaurants – but for the most authentic taste, go to the local markets.\n\nHomegrown talent\n\nSa Majesté Askoy is a young Burkinabé rap artist, and currently one of the most popular musicians in Ouagadougou, who performs in the local Mooré language. He has participated in many music festivals and performances in the west African region, and in our city, he can be seen performing at the Institut Burkinabè or P’tit Bazar.\n\nStreet style\n\nThe Faso Dan Fani is a colourful local cotton fabric used by many Ouagalais to promote the country’s culture.\n\nHow green is the city?\n\nOur city is full of many beautiful green spaces, like the Bangreweogo nature reserve, which is a perfect place to take a stroll away from the heat. Or, catch a live music performance in the Jardin de l’amitié, a culture park with a relaxing atmosphere. In order to protect these parks and other green spaces in Ouaga, a law prohibits the importation, marketing and distribution of packaging and non-biodegradable plastic bags in the country. This really helps to keep our spaces free from garbage.\n\nBest Instagram\n\nInstagram is not a well-used social media platform in Burkina Faso as the number of people with a mobile internet connection is very low. However, this popular account provides a nice insight into what everyday life is like living in Ouaga.\n\nBiggest controversy\n\nThe most recent controversy in Ouagadougou and elsewhere in the country is linked to a vigilante-style defence group called Koglweogo. This militia group, whose name means “guardians of the forest” in Mooré, was created by rural populations to stop, punish and judge criminals. The Koglweogo have multiplied around the major cities in central Burkina Faso, to counter increasing instances of robbery. Some are volunteers; others work on behalf of people who believe they have suffered, in most cases, from livestock or crop stealing.\n\nSome of the population believes that this group contributes to the safety of neighbourhoods, while others oppose the violent practices of Koglweogo, which they believe do not respect human rights.\n\nWorst building\n\nNot quite a building, but the Boulevard des Tansoba is the worst road in the city. Connecting the interchange of the East National Highway 4 with the Ouaga 2000 road, the Boulevard runs through four districts for a total of 6.5km, and is the worst piece of construction and infrastructure, according to many Ouagalais.\n\nBuilt in the early 1990s, the road is seriously deteriorating, with huge potholes causing accidents. Due to complaints from the public, the authorities planned to renovate the route before the end of 2016. But 2017 is fast approaching ...\n\nMoment in history\n\nThe fight against the amendment of Article 37 of the constitution – which limits presidential time in office to two terms of five years – led to a popular uprising in October 2014. Former president Blaise Compaoré wanted to amend the constitution to become a candidate once again, after already holding power for 27 years. And so, millions of Burkinabé took to the streets in big cities like Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, to demand his resignation. Being the capital and the seat of power in the country, Ouagadougou was home to a significant political uprising.\n\nThe National Assembly and several other public buildings were burned, and Compaoré was forced to resign, and fled across the border to Ivory Coast.\n\nInsider’s tip\n\nLocated about 30km from the heart of Ouagadougou, the site of the Sculpture Symposium on Granite Laongo is a field of artistic expression, where many sculptors from Africa and the whole world have left their mark. Artists come here in February to leave their work on the stones.\n\nThe biannual Fespaco festival, devoted to Pan-African cinema, is also worth visiting, to catch some of the best up-and-coming African films screened across the city.\n\nFive to follow\n\nBurkina Cahier Culture\n\nAmélie Gué\n\nSmockey Abazon\n\nBoukari Ouédraogo\n\nKindo Bassératou\n\nAbout me"
