Our efforts aim to help improve agricultural production, expand access to quality family planning services, combat infectious diseases, improve nutrition, spur vaccine development, improve sanitation, and expand maternal and newborn health programs.\n\nDespite limited natural resources and the challenges of a changing climate, Burkina Faso has achieved both economic growth and improved health outcomes in recent years as a result of government investment in human capital and inclusive development. The progress has included reductions in child and maternal mortality, improved vaccine coverage, and better child nutrition.\n\nAgriculture plays a key role in food security, economic growth, and poverty reduction in Burkina Faso, as it does throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Through our partner the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), we help empower smallholder farmers across the continent with information and tools to help them increase their productivity."
