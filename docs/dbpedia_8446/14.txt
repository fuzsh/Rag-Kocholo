The city is known for hosting the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO), the biggest film festival in Africa, held every two years. Ouagadougou is also home to the National Museum of Burkina Faso and several other cultural and educational institutions.

Where is Ouagadougou?

Ouagadougou occupies the central location in Burkina Faso, a landlocked country in West Africa. The city lies on the central plateau, characterized by flat terrain and savanna grasslands.

The geographical coordinates of Ouagadougou are approximately 12.3714 °N latitude and 1.5197 °W longitude. The city is about 305 meters (1,000 feet) above sea level.

It’s also situated about 150 kilometers (93 miles) west of the country’s eastern border with Niger and roughly 250 kilometers (155 miles) southeast of the northern border with Mali.

History of Ouagadougou

Ouagadougou, initially an insignificant tribal settlement, was established in the 11th century and became the capital of the Mossi Empire under the reign of Emperor Oubri around the 15th century. During this time, the city grew in importance and prominence, becoming a regional trade and culture center.

The city was repeatedly invaded in the 18th century, first by the Jula people and later by the Fulani Empire. However, the Mossi managed to regain control of Ouagadougou each time.

In the late 19th century, the city fell under French control when Burkina Faso, then known as Upper Volta, was colonized. This period of colonial rule shaped much of the city’s infrastructure and urban planning, and the influence can still be seen today.

Burkina Faso achieved independence from France in 1960, and Ouagadougou became the capital of the newly independent nation. It has remained the political and administrative hub of the country ever since, despite periods of political instability and changes in governance.

Recently, Ouagadougou has been the site of protests and uprisings, particularly in 2014 when a popular revolt ousted President Blaise Compaoré, who had been in power for 27 years. The city has also grappled with substantial safety concerns stemming from regional instability and actions of extremist factions in the Sahel region.

Despite the challenges, Ouagadougou hosts several meaningful events today and continues to be a vital cultural and economic hub in Burkina Faso and the broader West African region.
