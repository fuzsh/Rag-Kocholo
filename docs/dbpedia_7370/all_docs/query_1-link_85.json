        "text": "Dalvin Cook, Charles Gaines\n\nFlorida State's Dalvin Cook, left, outruns the pursuit of Louisville's Charles Gaines to score a touchdown during the second half of their NCAA college football game in Louisville, Ky., Thursday, Oct. 30, 2014. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley)\n\n(Timothy D. Easley)\n\nFlorida State running back Dalvin Cook's attorney said the battery charges against his client are unwarranted and the result of pressure from recent high-profile legal cases involving athletes in Tallahassee.\n\n\"Dalvin Cook did not strike this woman,\" Cook's attorney, Ricky Patel, told ESPN on Monday. \"Players were leaving the scene at the same time. But Dalvin walked away before it got out of hand.\"\n\nPatel said witnesses in the case were intoxicated, investigators were given three different versions of what happened, and one witness was not actually there.\n\n\"There are conflicting statements,\" he said. \"The woman and her dad -- who was not there -- identified Dalvin after being shown social-media pictures of Dalvin and some random people. It was an extremely unfair lineup. The pressure is so high, the assumption is 'he did it.'\n\nCook, FSU's leading rusher last fall as a freshman, faces a misdemeanor battery charge for allegedly punching a 21-year-old woman in the face multiple times during an argument outside of a Tallahassee bar last month. He has been suspended from the team.\n\nIt is the second incident involving violence by a player toward a woman in the last two months. Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher last month dismissed freshman quarterback De'Andre Johnson after seeing a video in which Johnson punched a woman at a different Tallahassee bar.\n\nThe university and the Tallahassee Police Department were also embroiled in controversy last year about how they handled a sexual assault allegation involving Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston.\n\nFlorida State president John Thrasher on Monday met with the team to reiterate the importance of maintaining appropriate personal conduct. \"They must remember that playing football for FSU is a privilege, not a right,\" Thrasher said in a statement afterward. \"The actions of a few have the capacity to do serious damage to the reputation of our entire university.\"\n\nIn Cook's case, Patel said not only did the running back not hit the woman, but she struck Florida State receiver Travis Rudolph. He added that he's concerned reports that Cook was previously cited for mistreatment of three pit bull puppies could prejudice a jury should the case go to trial.\n\n\"I am hoping it doesn't create a bias,\" Patel said. \"This is not a Michael Vick situation.\"\n\nPatel added that unlike the incident involving Johnson, there is no video to back up the accusation. He said he and Cook \"are not interested in a plea,\" and will consider civil action against the accuser."
