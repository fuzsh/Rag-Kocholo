        "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Florida State sophomore running back Dalvin Cook was found not guilty in a Leon County court on Monday of a misdemeanor battery charge.\n\nCook, now 20, was accused of hitting a 21-year-old woman outside a Tallahassee bar on June 23. He did not testify during the trial, which lasted for about 10 hours. The jury took less than 25 minutes to deliberate.\n\nCook, who had been suspended since July 11 after he was charged and turned himself in at Leon County Jail, had his suspension lifted by the school on Monday night.\n\nHe'll have his first practice of the fall with the Seminoles on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm just thankful and blessed that the truth came out,\" said Cook, who became the first freshman in school history to rush for more than 1,000 yards last season.\n\nCook's grandmother, Betty, screamed \"hallelujah, Lord\" after the verdict was announced. She was one of several members of Cook's family in the courtroom.\n\nMadison Geohegan, the alleged victim/accuser, wanted to drop charges after seeing Cook out several nights after the original incident because she was embarrassed of her injuries and involvement in the matter, but was encouraged by others to proceed with the charge, she said.\n\nShe remembered Cook after he \"smirked\" at her when they made eye contact at Mint Lounge, located on West College Avenue, \"like he was invincible. Like he was untouched.\"\n\nJurors determined that Cook was trying to defuse an argument between the accuser and FSU freshman wide receiver Da'Vante Phillips during the original incident on June 23 outside Clyde's and Costello's on South Adams Street.\n\nGeohegan said Phillips began to call her names and yelled obscenities. The argument escalated after Geohegan told Phillips, \"If I'm a ho, your mom's a ho.\" Phillips' mother died in January 2013.\n\nPhillips walked away from Geohegan when Cook intervened. Cook was \"really nice\" and said \"chill out, chill out\" while intervening in the argument, Geohegan said. She also asked Cook to walk her to her car when he intervened.\n\n\"I know those guys look up to me so I just try to set a good example for them,\" Cook said after the trial, regarding his teammates and the incident. \"I know what I was doing that night, and I was making peace.\"\n\nGeohegan then got into an argument with FSU sophomore receiver Travis Rudolph, saying he was poor for wearing army fatigue clothing.\n\nShe said she pushed Rudolph away, but he did not do anything to retaliate. After the push, she said she was trying to leave the scene with her friend when she was punched by Cook.\n\nA photo of the accuser's injuries after the altercation were presented in court. The accuser had a bloody lip and blood drops on her chin and neck. She also had dirt on her knee from a fall.\n\nCook, in an interview with a Tallahassee Police Department investigator several days after the incident, said he did not remember getting into a fight or any argument occurring with the accuser. He also could not remember if he was drinking.\n\nThe accuser and her friend both admitted to being intoxicated.\n\nThe investigator, Jarritt Federico, said there was no video of the incident. He also interviewed managers and employees at Clyde's and Costello's, but no one witnessed the altercation.\n\nRudolph, Phillips and freshman quarterback Deondre Francois each testified during the trial. They all said they — including Cook — were not drinking alcohol during the night of the event. Each player also said Geohegan hit Rudolph in the back of the head, and Rudolph did not retaliate. They also said Cook did not touch Geohegan in any way.\n\nBut the FSU players gave varying statements to authorities.\n\n\"They were all inconsistent with who was present and what occurred,\" Federico said.\n\nAn off-duty sergeant from Tallahassee Police Department was at the scene of the incident, but did not see the altercation occur. His first contact with the accuser was when she and her friend were waiting by his police car after the incident. He was not the responding officer to Geohegan's 911 call.\n\nGeohegan distinctly remembered Cook's hair and facial features from the incident, but could not identify him immediately after the incident.\n\nAfter several days of conferring with her friend, she was able to recognize Cook from online searches and an Instagram photo of multiple FSU football players from Rudolph's account. The picture was taken during the team's trip to the Rose Bowl last season.\n\nGeohegan also conferred with her father — an avid FSU fan, she said — who identified Cook.\n\nShe was able to pick Cook out of a photo lineup several days after the incident and the second encounter.\n\nGeohegan's friend, who also testified, was unable to complete a written statement to police after the incident because of her intoxication level.\n\nCook's attorneys, Joey McCall and Ricky Patel from Miami, called only one person to the stand — FSU finance major Grant Jenkins, who had no intention of involving himself in the case until he read a news story about the incident.\n\nJenkins said he was present roughly 10 feet away from the altercation with friends. He stuck around the club after it closed solely to people watch.\n\n\"That's all we were there for,\" Jenkins said. \"To watch the argument.\"\n\nJenkins testified Cook never hit anyone.\n\nAfter all the evidence and testimonies, the jury of four men and two women had reasonable doubt to acquit Cook. Cook later spoke to the media outside the courtroom.\n\nCook's attorneys intervened when he was asked by media why the accuser accused him, and why he told investigators he didn't remember being in an altercation.\n\n\"I know I did not do no crime or did no wrong,\" Cook said.\n\nAdded Cook's grandmother from a post on her Facebook page on Cook's 20th birthday Aug. 11: \"The devil is trying to destroy, but just wait because all these tests that God is giving us now will soon be testimonies.\"\n\nSafid Deen writes for The Tallahassee Democrat."
