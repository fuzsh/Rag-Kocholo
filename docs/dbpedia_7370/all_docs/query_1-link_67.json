        "text": "Image via Complex Original\n\n1.\n\nYou know that we couldn't leave 2014 without one last(?) headline from the Florida State University football program.\n\nToday, Seminoles leading rusher Dalvin Cook was named an associate in an on-going investigation concerning a Tallahassee, Fla. aggravated assault case.\n\n2.\n\nTally PD: FSU RB Dalvin Cook part of active investigation as associate of 2 men in aggravated assault, alleged to wave firearm at victim\n\nâ€” Brett McMurphy (@McMurphyESPN) December 24, 2014\n\n3.\n\nAs ESPN points out, this doesn't necessarily make Cook a suspect in the case; his role in the incident is unknown.\n\n4.\n\nTallahassee police are investigating whether two men brandished a firearm at a neighbor on July 17, according to the release. Cook's involvement, if any, in the alleged incident isn't known. He was not named as a suspect in the report, according to Tallahassee police.\n\n5.\n\nArguably, it's of greater note here that it took the Tallahassee P.D. this long to name Cook as an associate, given that the event took place back in July. For a police department that is nationally renowned for their fair play and ethics, it's a shocking delay. Just completely unexpected.\n\nCook, however, is still slated to play for the Seminoles on January 1, when they take on the Oregon Ducks in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff.\n\n[via Black Sports Online]"
