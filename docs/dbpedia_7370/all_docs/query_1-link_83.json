        "text": "Florida State running back Dalvin Cook, who was arrested and charged Friday after punching a woman in the face outside a bar in June, is actually looking at his third strike as a member of the FSU football program.\n\nAccording to Andy Staples of SI.com, Cook, who is currently serving an indefinite suspension, was charged with criminal mischief last October for his participation in a BB-gun fight in June 2014 that damaged several vehicles. And on July 25, 2014, the City of Tallahassee Animal Services cited Cook for the mistreatment of three pit bull puppies.\n\nCook is currently facing a misdemeanor battery charge after a woman claimed Cook punched her in the face outside of a bar on June 23. The partially redacted police report, which was obtained by the Tallahassee Democrat, said the victim was intoxicated and had suffered “minor abrasion/bruises.”\n\nThis incident occurred a day after quarterback DeAndre Johnson also punched a woman in the face at a bar. Johnson was released from the program after surveillance video surfaced.\n\nCoach Jimbo Fisher responded to the incidents by banning Florida State football players from bars.\n\nWhile Johnson’s punishment was swift, it might take some time before we know Cook’s fate. He was, after all, the Seminoles’ leading rusher last season, so Fisher will likely let the entire legal process play out before making a final decision.\n\nFor more Florida State news, visit Warchant.com.\n\n-----\n\nGraham Watson is the editor of Dr. Saturday on Yahoo Sports.
