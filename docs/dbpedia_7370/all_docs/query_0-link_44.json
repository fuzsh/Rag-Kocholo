        "text": "If you know me, you know Florida State University. If you know Florida State University, you know it is the best institution in the world that I could not be more proud of to have attended. My grandfather first became a fan of the Noles when Bobby Bowden was hired in '76. It wasn't just regional ties that inspired his FSU fandom, but Bowden's process. This program was going to do things the right way. They would develop young leaders who would make the world better. My mother attended Florida State University in the late 80's when the results of this process were starting to translate into championship-caliber football on the field. I grew up running down my hallway pretending to be Jameis Winston, Dalvin Cook, Deondre Francois--the list goes on and on. I always dreamt of being a part of such a special place. You can only imagine how psyched I was when I was accepted into the school of my childhood imagination. The surreal part was getting to actually be a part of the team with creative media and eventually becoming a student manager my freshman year for football, working with QBs, TEs, and play calling for the offense. Being able to learn under Coach Norvell was one of the greatest influences to learn how to thrive in the battle of life and a rare opportunity to actually live out my childhood dream, and I will always be thankful for that. Just like football, the community and academic environment at FSU gave me myriad opportunities to grow as a person, a student, a professional, a leader, and a friend. I am so grateful to the FSU Dr. William T. Hold/The National Alliance Program in RMI for all of the career opportunities and exposure they give to us students. The professors pour into us and make my peers and I feel like someone has always got our best interest at heart. The direction and confidence this school gave me to advance on my journey is invaluable. In just three years, I was able to meet some of the most remarkable and inspirational individuals of my life from attending this school, whether it be a roommate, classmate, peer, athlete, coach, professor, or friend. I love this school and love these people. You know who you are. Attending this university was the best decision I have ever made. Thank you, Florida State."
