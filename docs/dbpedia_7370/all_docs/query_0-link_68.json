        "text": "TALLAHASSEE | Florida State University administrators looking for mentors to help football players understand that their bad behavior could have long-term effects should perhaps call Jacksonville attorney Stephen A. Smith.\n\nSmith travels often for FSU alumni events and football games, but he recently messaged the athletic department to ask if he could speak directly to the team after two players' arrests on charges of assaulting women. He would join a list of speakers, many of them alumni, and a possible new classroom course to educate student athletes on how to make better choices and avoid negative headlines.\n\nThat would be in addition to the normal orientation activities, speeches and cautionary tales that players at any top-tier football program are used to hearing. The question is, will it finally sink in at FSU?\n\nPresident John Thrasher said he is thinking about creating a course that teaches student-athletes about ethics, responsibility and how to withstand the glare of playing for a high-profile school. Many athletic scholarship recipients come from disadvantaged backgrounds and need extra resources and mentoring, he said.\n\nIf invited, Smith would bring an old copy of the local newspaper. His own mugshot is splashed across the front page with an article about the then-student government leader being charged as a member of a check-cashing scheme.\n\n\"I was wrong as all outdoors is the bottom line,\" Smith said about his arrest. But it caused him to reflect on his life and choices in a way he had never done.\n\n\"I, myself, made mistakes in my youthful ignorance, and I had to come to the conclusion that really my character was poor,\" Smith said. \"It was not up to par. It was not where it should be. And I decided I did not want to be that guy anymore.\"\n\nSmith was president of the Student Senate when he was charged with two felonies in 2001 after cashing a fraudulent check earlier that year. FSU suspended him from classes, although he ultimately was allowed to finish coursework and graduate.\n\nSmith pleaded no contest and was punished with probation and community service although adjudication was withheld. He could have faced up to 10 years in prison.\n\nTWO RECENT CASES\n\nHe believes members of the FSU football team need to learn those same lessons, preferably before another one finds himself in trouble. The team is already down two players this summer because of off-the-field incidents involving the alleged abuse of women.\n\nDe'Andre Johnson, a Jacksonville native and highly touted freshman quarterback, was kicked off the team after surveillance video showed him punching a woman in the face at a local bar June 24.\n\nThe day before, a woman had accused FSU running back Dalvin Cook of assaulting her outside a different watering hole. A warrant for Cook's arrest was issued several days later. He is now suspended from the team.\n\nJohnson remains enrolled at FSU on scholarship through the summer, but the school is working with him, his family and attorneys to facilitate a transfer to a new school so he can continue playing football elsewhere. Thrasher believes he deserves a second chance, just not at FSU.\n\n\"This one young man's split decision, De'Andre Johnson, who I'm told is just a really fine young man, but at that particular moment he made a bad decision,\" Thrasher said. \"But the worst decision he made is the fact he was there to begin with.\"\n\nCook's suspension is indefinite based on the outcome of his case, which consists of conflicting witness testimony. If he is cleared of the charges, Thrasher will recommend he be reinstated on the team.\n\nThrasher wants the remaining members of the football team to avoid negative attention, so he has asked them to stay away from the nightclubs and bars that entice the 70,000 students in this three-college town.\n\nDuring a visit with the team Monday, Thrasher told players that when they get in trouble the whole school is affected.\n\n\"I just felt that it's important for these young men to hear from not just the athletic side of the administration but the university administration to let them know that the ramifications of their actions really bleed over outside of the athletic department,\" Thrasher said. \"They're student-athletes, and so we're going to get a lot of scrutiny.\"\n\nThe negative publicity surrounding the rape allegations against star quarterback Jameis Winston, as well as resulting civil lawsuits although he was never charged in a criminal case, increased the attention on FSU. So did a recent ESPN investigative report that said athletes at FSU and rival University of Florida are the least likely to face prosecution after being accused of crimes compared to the general public.\n\nThrasher asked head football coach Jimbo Fisher to develop a plan that includes speakers addressing the team about character-building and decision-making. The schedule will likely include prominent former players who have done well for themselves, such as safety Myron Rolle, a Rhodes scholar, and NFL Hall of Famer and philanthropist Derrick Brooks.\n\nMotivational speaker Tyrone White spoke to the team on Thursday about violence against women, the Tallahassee Democrat reported.\n\nSmith said if he is allowed to address the team, he will tell the players that they have to consider the long-term effects of their decisions and choose to be better people.\n\n\"You can't allow your impulsive actions to define you for a lifetime,\" Smith said. \"You have to be able to have self-control, temperance.\"\n\nHis arrest and resulting soul-searching caused Smith to change course. He had grown up poor in Jacksonville, the oldest boy out of six children raised by a single mother. He was the first to attend college, but the arrest threatened his plan to become a lawyer.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys on his case saw his potential and gave him a second chance.\n\nSmith is now both a practicing attorney and the pastor at Hephzibah Evangelistic Pentecostal Church on Jacksonville's Northside. He is married with a baby on the way.\n\nThrasher said he hopes the speakers who address the football team help the message stick so that players avoid circumstances and places where they can get in trouble. It isn't just about the university's reputation but their own futures, he said.\n\nEnding his speech Monday, he pointed his finger at the players one-by-one and asked a question: \"Are there any leaders in here?\"\n\nAbout eight to 10 young men stood up right away, likely the captains.\n\nThrasher asked them again.\n\nEventually, every player was standing.\n\n\"I said are you with me to try to help me get this resolved so it doesn't happen again?\" Thrasher recalled. Everyone replied, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nTia Mitchell: (850) 933-1321"
