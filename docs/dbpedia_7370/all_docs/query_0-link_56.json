The former Notre Dame star finished with 302 yards, four touchdowns and no turnovers before giving way to backup Sean Maguire late in the fourth quarter.\n\nHe reminded me of Jameis (Winston), junior receiver Bobo Wilson said. He made some really good throws.\n\nThats an awfully high standard, but, for at least a night, Golson led a smooth transition from the Winston era.\n\nTeammates said Golson made proper checks at the line, read the defense properly and  most importantly  took good care of the ball.\n\nGolsons arm talent was on full display, too. He was near perfect on a throw between two defenders that landed square in JaVonn Harrisons chest for a 22-yard gain over the middle of the field.\n\nAnd he floated a pretty pass to the back of the end zone that tight end Ryan Izzo caught for a touchdown that gave FSU a 35-10 lead and all but put the game away.\n\nIn practice, (Golson) makes it look easy, Izzo said. He does this every day. Seeing it out there, I was just kind of used to it.\n\nCook, meanwhile, helped the Seminoles keep the Bobcats (0-1) at a distance in the early goings.\n\nBehind four new starters on the offensive line, Cook rushed for 156 yards (122 by halftime) and two touchdowns while averaging more than eight yards per carry. He became the first Seminole to reach the 100-yard mark in four straight games since Greg Jones in 2001-02.\n\nI knew Dalvin was going to make some magic out there, junior defensive end DeMarcus Walker said.\n\nAnd redshirt junior Mario Pender proved a perfect balance for Cook, posting 92 yards and a TD of his own.\n\nFlorida State went to halftime with 23 rush attempts while throwing the ball just nine times. But by the time the clock hit zero, the Seminoles had achieved a near perfect offensive balance.\n\nFSUs 370 passing yards and 266 rushing yards added up to its highest offensive output (636 yards) since beating Idaho in 2013.\n\nThats due in large part to Fisher unleashing Golson in the second half.\n\nGolson went in to halftime having thrown only nine passes. He then went 9 for 13 for 149 yards and two touchdowns in the third quarter alone. Each of Golsons four TDs came in the third and fourth quarters, and all were thrown to a different receiver.\n\nWe know we loosened up, Fisher said. The receivers got comfortable in what we were doing and it came out.\n\nGolsons last touchdown, a 55-yarder to a wide-open Harrison, was his easiest of the night.\n\nHe threw the ball nicely, Fisher said. It was crisp, sharp, ball came out of his hands very well. He was precise in his decisions tonight. Thats what I liked.\n\nAll told, Golson completed passes to nine different targets. Sophomore Travis Rudolph led the way with 44 yards and a TD on four catches. Junior Bobo Wilson (3-53, TD) and Harrison (2-77, TD) had strong outings as well.\n\nOn the other side, FSUs defense kept the Bobcats mostly under wraps.\n\nTexas State didnt cross the 200-yard threshold until the fourth quarter  after subbing in quarterback Connor White for start Connor Jones  and went nearly 35 minutes between scores.\n\nFSUs defenders set an early tone with a fast, physical first possession that they believe changed the way the Bobcats played.\n\nIf you strike somebody, trust me, theyre scared, junior defensive end DeMarcus Walker said. We could just tell we were putting fear into those guys.\n\nStill, the Seminoles left Saturdays game with plenty of room to grow, especially on special teams.\n\nFSUs specialists struggled across the board Saturday night. New punt returner Marquez White muffed one punt that led to a TSU touchdown, and he failed to catch another that gave the FSU offense poor field position.\n\nWhites replacement, Rudolph, muffed his attempt, too. Finally, Fisher sent Wilson back deep to settle things down.\n\nIts nothing serious, youve just got to get underneath the ball, Wilson said. Keep your eyes on the ball.\n\nEven the Seminoles normally steady kicking game suffered some early-season missteps. Cason Beattys first punt travelled just 26 yards (he later hit a long of 44), and All-America kicker Roberto Aguayo sailed two kickoffs out of bounds.\n\nTexas State also caught the Seminoles off-guard with a fake punt that led to a field goal.\n\nWeve got to get those things fixed because we need (special teams) to be a strength, Fisher said. Have to get those things ironed out quickly.\n\nEspecially because, after a late start on Saturday (kickoff was delayed about an hour by lightning), the Seminoles next game comes early.\n\nFSU hosts South Florida, a 51-3 winner over Florida A&M on Saturday, at 11:30 a.m. on Sept. 12.\n\nTheres a lot of work to be done, but you can see the potential for this football team, Fisher said. If it will keep its nose down and worry about the process of getting better, I think we have chance to be a good football team.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Texas St-San Marcos 0 10 0 6 16 Florida State 14 7 14 24 59\n\n1st 7- 0 Dalvin Cook, 1, run (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 6:23 14- 0 Dalvin Cook, 28, run (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 0:41 2nd 14- 3 Opp, 26, field goal, 11:30 14-10 Opp, 4, run (kick), 9:06 21-10 Mario Pender, 1, run (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 5:44 3rd 28-10 Travis Rudolph, 5, pass from Everett Golson (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 9:11 35-10 Ryan Izzo, 13, pass from Everett Golson (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 4:11 4th 42-10 Bobo Wilson, 14, pass from Everett Golson (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 13:30 49-10 Ja'Vonn Harrison, 55, pass from Everett Golson (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 11:04 49-16 Opp, 4, pass (kick failed), 5:39 56-16 Johnathan Vickers, 24, pass from Sean Maguire (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 4:03 59-16 Roberto Aguayo, 22, field goal, 2:18\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 30 17 Rushes-yards 41-266 33-132 Passing 370 168 Att-Comp-Int 32-25-0 42-26-0 Total Yards 73-636 75-300 Punt Returns 5-21 1-10 Kickoff Returns 3-127 3-51 Interception Ret. 0-0 0-0 Fumble Returns 1-3 1-0 Punts 3-36.3 7-46.6 Sacks By-Yds 1-12 2-11 Fumbles-Lost 3-1 1-1 Penalties-Yds 5-35 1-5 3rd Down Conversions 8-12 4-17 4th Down Conversions 0-0 3-5 Time of Posession 32:01 27:59 Attendance 80,917 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Dalvin Cook 19 156 2 36 Mario Pender 14 92 1 18 Jacques Patrick 3 13 0 5 Freddie Stevenson 1 6 0 6 Everett Golson 4 -1 0 10 --------------------------------------------- FSU 41 266 3 36 Opp 33 132 1 26 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Ja'Vonn Harrison 2 77 1 55t Bobo Wilson 3 53 1 28 Travis Rudolph 4 44 1 21 George Campbell 3 42 0 23 Kermit Whitfield 1 35 0 35 Mario Pender 3 34 0 17 Johnathan Vickers 1 24 1 24t Ermon Lane 2 23 0 12 Ryan Izzo 2 21 1 13t Dalvin Cook 1 13 0 13 Mavin Saunders 1 5 0 5 Freddie Stevenson 1 2 0 2 Da'Vante Phillips 1 -3 0 -3 --------------------------------------------- FSU 25 370 5 55t Opp 26 168 1 25 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Everett Golson 19 25 0 302 4 55t Sean Maguire 6 7 0 68 1 24t ----------------------------------------------- FSU 25 32 0 370 5 55t Opp 26 42 0 168 1 25 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Bobo Wilson 2 22 0 18 Marquez White 2 0 0 2 Travis Rudolph 1 -1 0 -1 --------------------------------------------- FSU 5 21 0 18 Opp 1 10 0 10 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Kermit Whitfield 2 90 0 59 Jalen Ramsey 1 37 0 37 --------------------------------------------- FSU 3 127 0 59 Opp 3 51 0 20 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Cason Beatty 3 109 44 ---------------------------------------- FSU 3 109 44 Opp 7 326 57 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tyrell Lyons 5 2 7 0.5- 1.0 . . . . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nFlorida State 34, South Florida 14\n\n09/12/2015, Tallahassee, Fla.\n\nFrom the FSU Website, seminoles.com.\n\nNoles' Defense Overcomes, Corrals Bulls.\n\nBy Tim Linafelt, Seminoles.com Senior Writer\n\nTALLAHASSEE, FL  With a morning kickoff leading to a sleepy start, Florida States defense kept South Florida at bay long enough for the Seminoles offense to shake off its cobwebs.\n\nAside from Dalvin Cooks heroics, quarterback Everett Golson and Co. sputtered in the first half, posting just 110 yards of total offense. Golson in particular took a while to get going, completing just one pass for nine yards in the first two quarters.\n\nEnter the FSU defense.\n\nFacing a USF attack that racked up 556 yards and 51 points last week, the Seminoles corralled the Bulls for just 274 total yards in a 34-14 victory. And a large chunk of that came on a 71-yard trick play that occurred after the game was mostly decided.\n\nOn defense I thought we played outstanding except for the one trick play that caught us on a blitz and we had a busted assignment, FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said. But for the most part, our guys rallied to the ball, kept the quarterback contained most of the time.\n\nThey dug their way out of some difficult, spots, too.\n\nMidway through the first quarter, a 46-yard punt return set USF up at the FSU 11-yard line. Two plays later, they faced a third-and-3 and lined up Elkanah Dillon, a 6-foot-5 tight end, across from FSUs 6-foot corner, Marquez White.\n\nThe one-on-one match sounded an alarm in Whites mind.\n\nI noticed they put a bigger dude in, White said, I knew they would probably go to the jump ball. Thats what I would do if I was the offensive coordinator.\n\nWhite was right. USF quarterback Quinton Flowers floated a pass to the back corner of the end zone, only White beat Dillon to the ball and caught it easily for FSUs first interception of the season.\n\nThat was a critical play right there, Fisher said. To do what they defense did was extreme. I mean, theyre tremendous.\n\nNot only was Whites interception the first and only turnover of the day for either side, but it was also one of 12 third-down stops for the Florida State defense.\n\nThe Seminoles allowed only one third-down conversion on 13 USF tries and forced 11 punts.\n\nThey got to the quarterback, too. Flowers is one of the best dual-threat runners the Seminoles will see this season, yet they held him to just 38 yards on the ground (23 of which came on one play) and sacked him three times.\n\nThrough two games, the Seminoles have posted four sacks, nearly a quarter of their 2014 total of 17.\n\nWe got good pressure on the quarterback, Fisher said. I mean, we did a good job.\n\nAnd they did it all without the services of their starting safety for much of the game.\n\nLamarcus Brutus, a fifth-year senior who earned a starting job in fall camp, was ejected in the first quarter after officials ruled he targeted a USF player during a punt return.\n\nBrutus loss is measured in more than just tackles and pass breakups  hes also responsible for making the defensive calls and getting his teammates lined up in proper position.\n\nIn Brutus absence, sophomore star Trey Marshall moved back to safety and senior Tyler Hunter filled Marshalls spot.\n\nThat worried me, Fisher said.  With Trey Marshall going to the back end and Tyler Hunter coming in showed our depth because Brutus is a really good player and is pivotal to what we do.\n\nFishers worries proved to be mostly unfounded. Save for the long score in the fourth quarter, FSUs secondary held firm for the rest of the game.\n\nFlowers finished with just 125 passing yards and completed only 50 percent of his attempts.\n\nIts really rewarding (to overcome adversity), White said. Its in our DNA, for real. Last year, we had a lot of tight games. Thats not something we want, but I feel like we know how to deal with adversity.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total South Florida 0 7 0 7 14 Florida State 7 0 17 10 34\n\n1st 7- 0 Dalvin Cook, 74, run (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 4:45 2nd 7- 7 Opp, 1, pass (kick), 11:57 3rd 14- 7 Dalvin Cook, 24, run (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 13:08 17- 7 Roberto Aguayo, 30, field goal, 6:40 24- 7 Bobo Wilson, 23, pass from Everett Golson (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 0:38 4th 24-14 Opp, 71, pass (kick), 14:50 27-14 Roberto Aguayo, 38, field goal, 8:46 34-14 Dalvin Cook, 37, run (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 1:55\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 21 11 Rushes-yards 46-278 36-149 Passing 163 125 Att-Comp-Int 26-14-0 24-12-1 Total Yards 72-441 60-274 Punt Returns 6-40 2-46 Kickoff Returns 2-56 4-99 Interception Ret. 1-0 0-0 Fumble Returns 0-0 0-0 Punts 7-40.6 10-44.5 Sacks By-Yds 3-8 3-31 Fumbles-Lost 1-0 0-0 Penalties-Yds 7-50 2-21 3rd Down Conversions 3-13 1-13 4th Down Conversions 1-1 1-1 Time of Posession 33:23 26:37 Attendance 72,811 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Dalvin Cook 30 266 3 74t Mario Pender 7 29 0 21 Team 1 -2 0 -2 Everett Golson 8 -15 0 6 --------------------------------------------- FSU 46 278 3 74t Opp 36 149 0 23 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Travis Rudolph 6 55 0 18 Bobo Wilson 3 54 1 23t Ja'Vonn Harrison 2 20 0 11 Kermit Whitfield 2 19 0 15 Freddie Stevenson 1 15 0 15 --------------------------------------------- FSU 14 163 1 23t Opp 12 125 2 71t Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Everett Golson 14 26 0 163 1 23t ----------------------------------------------- FSU 14 26 0 163 1 23t Opp 12 24 1 125 2 71t Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Bobo Wilson 6 40 0 18 --------------------------------------------- FSU 6 40 0 18 Opp 2 46 0 46 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Kermit Whitfield 1 56 0 56 Freddie Stevenson 1 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 2 56 0 56 Opp 4 99 0 34 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Cason Beatty 7 284 46 ---------------------------------------- FSU 7 284 46 Opp 10 445 56 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Jacob Pugh 6 1 7 1.0- 2.0 1.0- 2.0 . . . . . . .

STARTERS\n\nFlorida State 14, Boston College 0\n\n09/18/2015, Chestnut Hill, Mass.\n\nFrom the FSU Website, seminoles.com.\n\nShut Out: Noles Blank BC in Chestnut Hill.\n\nBy Tim Linafelt, Seminoles.com Senior Writer\n\nCHESTNUT HILL, MA  Not satisfied to only hold Boston College off the scoreboard on Friday night, the Florida State defense scored a few points of its own.\n\nAfter nearly three quarters spent preserving a seven-point lead, FSUs defenders took matters into their own hands when Terrance Smith forced a fumble and Jalen Ramsey picked up the ball and returned it for a 36-yard touchdown that sealed the No. 6 Seminoles 14-0 win here at Alumni Stadium.\n\nFSU is 3-0 for the fourth consecutive season and won its third straight ACC opener. The Seminoles have a bye week before visiting Wake Forest on Oct. 3.\n\nI said at halftime, If they dont score, we win, FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said. Then they went out and got seven points. Thats what happens. Im extremely happy and proud for those guys and our team.\n\nThe Seminoles earned the first shutout of coordinator Charles Kellys tenure and first since blanking Maryland in 2013.\n\nFSU last shut out an opponent on the road in a 37-0 win over Notre Dame in 2003.\n\nIts always great when we can pitch a shut out, Ramsey said. It was great play-calling by Coach Kelly, great execution by the players. It was a complete game by us.\n\nIt came at the right time, too.\n\nBecause after marching down the field for an eight-play, 83-yard touchdown drive to start the game, FSUs offense found little easy against a BC defense that came into the game ranked No. 1 in the country.\n\nQuarterback Everett Golson started the game 5-for-5 and gave FSU a quick 7-0 lead with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Travis Rudolph.\n\nAfter that, the Seminoles remaining offensive drives ended like this: punt, punt, punt, missed field goal, punt, punt, punt, punt, turnover on downs. (Golson ran out the clock on a fourth-down play.)\n\nWhich meant a busy night for punter Cason Beatty.\n\nFortunately for the Seminoles, Beatty was up to the task, punting seven times for 366 yards  good for an eye-popping 52.3 average yards per punt.\n\nThe Charlotte, N.C., native also booted a career-high four punts of 50-plus yards, the last of which went for 58 before rolling to a stop at the Eagles 1-yard line.\n\nI talked with the defense today, Beatty said. Punting is defensive. The offense needed us as a defense and Im on the defense. It was time for us to step up and the defense did an amazing job today.\n\nAs a result, the Eagles offense spent most of the night with poor starting field position.\n\nThey started four drives inside their own 20-yard line, and they never made it past FSUs 39.\n\nWere not good enough against that kind of team to go 90 yards, BC coach Steve Addazio said.\n\nI thought [Beatty] was huge in the game, Fisher said. I mean, that guy was hitting punts and keeping field position. Thats a guy who went through a couple rough weeks, not playing as well as he was capable of playing. But we knew.\n\nIt took FSU four minutes and 53 seconds for the Seminoles to take a lead.\n\nIt took nearly three full quarters for them to extend it.\n\nFinally, after a combined 12 punts, FSU earned some breathing room.\n\nIts appropriate then that, as the Seminoles defense looks to regain its championship-level form from 2013, that two of the few players left from that team helped swing the tide.\n\nIt was Smith, now a fifth-year senior, who jarred the ball loose from BCs Jon Hilliman.\n\nAnd it was Ramsey, now a junior, who scooped and scored.\n\nIt was just kind of in the right place at the right time, Ramsey said. I saw it, I just picked it up and started running to the end zone.\n\nWith their lead finally extended to two scores, the Seminoles could afford to be more aggressive.\n\nBy the time the clock hit zero, the Eagles had mustered just 195 yards of total offense and a meager 3.4 yards per play.\n\nNot that FSU fared much better.\n\nAfter driving 83 yards to start the game, the Seminoles managed just 134 for the rest of the game.\n\nGolson finished 15 of 24 for 119 yards. And FSUs running game, fresh of a record-setting performance last week, was held in check by a BC defense that entered the game ranked No. 1 in the nation.\n\nThat defense, as well as an apparent injury, limited star running back Dalvin Cook to 67 yards on 15 carries. He went to the locker room midway through the second half but later returned to the game.\n\nFisher said Cook was banged and bruised but that he was fine.\n\nI dont think its anything major, Fisher said.\n\nFisher admitted that, after how the game started, he was surprised to find yards and points at such a premium.\n\nHe credited Boston College, but also counted several instances where the Seminoles had the right play call but failed to execute it.\n\nThat starts with me, he said. Ive got to do a better job on offense of getting these guys executing better, playing better. Then weve got to play better.\n\nStill, Fisher had few complaints about a conference win on the road.\n\nEven if the defense had to do more heavy lifting than usual.\n\nWere going to have to get better all year. I knew that, Fisher said. But Im very proud of our team, went on the road and was able to shut a team out. ... Our defense played outstanding and thats where it starts.\n\nIf they dont score, you dont lose. Thats for sure.\n\n1st 2nd 3rd 4th Total Florida State 7 0 0 7 14 Boston College 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1st 7- 0 Travis Rudolph, 9, pass from Everett Golson (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 10:07 2nd 7- 0 Roberto Aguayo, 42, field goal failed, 1:59 4th 14- 0 Jalen Ramsey, 36, fumble recovery/return (Roberto Aguayo, kick), 12:20\n\nTEAM STATISTICS\n\nFSU OPP First downs 15 12 Rushes-yards 33- 98 43-139 Passing 119 56 Att-Comp-Int 24-15-0 15-5-1 Total Yards 57-217 58-195 Punt Returns 4--7 3-25 Kickoff Returns 1-17 2-47 Interception Ret. 1-0 0-0 Fumble Returns 1-36 0-0 Punts 7-52.3 7-47.9 Sacks By-Yds 2-14 2-21 Fumbles-Lost 0-0 1-1 Penalties-Yds 4-26 6-66 3rd Down Conversions 4-13 5-15 4th Down Conversions 0-1 0-1 Time of Posession 26:28 28:36 Attendance 39,111 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS Rushing No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Dalvin Cook 15 54 0 28 Kermit Whitfield 2 19 0 15 Mario Pender 9 19 0 14 Everett Golson 6 5 0 14 Freddie Stevenson 1 1 0 1 --------------------------------------------- FSU 33 98 0 28 Opp 43 139 0 18 Receiving No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Kermit Whitfield 4 52 0 26 Travis Rudolph 4 33 1 13 Bobo Wilson 4 31 0 14 Dalvin Cook 2 3 0 7 Mavin Saunders 1 0 0 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 15 119 1 26 Opp 5 56 0 20 Passing C- A- I Yds TD Lng ----------------------------------------------- Everett Golson 15 24 0 119 1 26 ----------------------------------------------- FSU 15 24 0 119 1 26 Opp 5 15 1 56 0 20 Punt Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Bobo Wilson 4 0 0 3 Javien Elliott 0 -7 0 --------------------------------------------- FSU 4 -7 0 3 Opp 3 25 0 13 Kickoff Return No Yds TD Lng --------------------------------------------- Jalen Ramsey 1 17 0 17 --------------------------------------------- FSU 1 17 0 17 Opp 2 47 0 24 Punting No Yds Lng ---------------------------------------- Cason Beatty 7 366 58 ---------------------------------------- FSU 7 366 58 Opp 7 335 57 |---------Tackles---------| |---Sacks---| |---Pass Def---| |-Fumbles-| Blkd DEFENSIVE STATISTICS UT AT Total ForLoss No - Yards Int-Yds BrUp QBH Rcv-Yds FF Kick Saf ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ro'Derrick Hoskins 6 1 7 1.0- 1.0 . . . . . . . .

The Seminoles will put their perfect record on the line next week when they return home to face Miami,\n\nMy mindset is, when the ball is in the air, its mine, Hunter said. I just had to go and get it.\n\nMidway through the third quarter, there wasnt much indication that Hunter would even be in position for late-game heroics.\n\nThe Seminoles (4-0, 2-0 ACC) took a 14-10 lead into halftime then gained some separation thanks to an Everett Golson touchdown pass and a 25-yard field goal from Roberto Aguayo that made it 24-10.\n\nWake Forest (2-3, 0-3 ACC), though, stayed within arms reach and, after a pair of fourth-quarter field goals and two defensive stops, had both the ball and the chance to give the Seminoles a scare.\n\nThanks to three completions and a personal foul penalty, Wake reached FSUs 20-yard line with 21 seconds to play before Hunter finally allowed the Seminoles to exhale.\n\nFSU spent the night beleaguered by penalties, drawing 10 flags for a total of 100 yards.\n\nToo many silly penalties on defense, FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said. Interference, facemask. Some crazy things.\n\nStill, Fisher was in no mood to apologize for a win, especially with Cook, Smith and Andrews in street clothes. (Second-team running back Mario Pender also missed the game due to a lung ailment.)\n\nCook dazzled from his very first carry, rushing up the middle and bouncing off of Wake defenders for a 94-yard touchdown run that was the third-longest in school history.\n\nBut he touched the ball just twice more and, after an eight-yard reception, limped off the field and did not return.\n\nFisher said after the game that Cook has a hamstring injury and is day-to-day. He finished with 104 total yards (94 rushing, eight receiving) and a score.\n\nMeanwhile Smith, FSUs most experienced linebacker, played just one series before leaving the game with a right leg injury. And just a few moments later, starting safety Nate Andrews injured his left knee while making a tackle on Wake tight end Cam Serigne.\n\nAndrews is scheduled to have an MRI to determine his injury.\n\nThats three key guys, Fisher said. But you know what? Next guy up. Thats life. Thats ball. The next guy has got to step up and play.\n\nWith injuries piling up FSU saw a number of players take advantage of increased opportunities.\n\nJohnathan Vickers, a Quincy, Fla., native who played at Tallahassees North Florida Christian School, took over at running back and carried 10 times for 33 yards.\n\nHis first career rushing touchdown  a tough, 9-yard run up the middle  extended the Seminoles lead to 14-3 midway through the second quarter.\n\nIt was exciting, Vickers said. I was just doing what Ive got to do  do the little things and the big plays will come. Youre not really worried about touchdowns, youre trying to make plays.\n\nReggie Northrup and RoDerrick Hoskins, who entered the game tied for the team lead in tackles, bore the brunt of Smiths absence. They finished with 10 and eight tackles, respectively, with Northrup also posting five quarterback hurries.\n\nAnd freshman safety Derwin James got his first extended action, finishing with six tackles while also harassing Wake QB Kendall Hinton as an edge rusher.\n\n\"Derwin got in there and did a nice job,\" Fisher said.\n\nFSUs passing game bounced back from an uneven showing in its last outing  and a few early hiccups on Saturday.\n\nQuarterback Everett Golson finished 20 of 31 for 202 yards and a touchdown. More encouraging than Golson"
