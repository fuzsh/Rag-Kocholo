        "text": "Florida State running back Dalvin Cook has declared for the 2017 NFL draft.\n\nCook announced his decision Saturday afternoon on his Instagram account.\n\nCook, a junior, has set every nearly major record in Florida State rushing history. He leads the Seminoles with 4,464 rushing yards for his career, and in rushing touchdowns with 46.\n\nHe is also the season record holder for rushing yards with 1,765, set this season.\n\nIn a memorable homecoming Friday night, Cook led the Seminoles to a 33-32 victory over Michigan in the Orange Bowl at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nCook was named the game's MVP, rushing for 145 yards on 20 carries, including a 71-yard burst. He also caught three passes for 62 yards, giving him 207 total yards in the game.\n\nFollowing the game, Cook said he wanted to enjoy the victory.\n\n\"I’m just blessed to be up here and proud to be a part of this group,\" he said.\n\nWhen FSU coach Jimbo Fisher was asked at the post-game press conference if he expected Cook to return to FSU for his senior season, he said, \"Our job is to get the proper information for him to make the proper choice and support him in anything he does, just like we’ll always do. He’ll never not be part of this family and we want the best for him.\n\n“But I know one thing, if we get him, we’ll be the luckiest team in the world. Whoever drafts him will be the luckiest team in the world. Somebody is going to be happy.’’\n\nThe NFL deadline for underclassmen to declare for the draft is Jan. 16.\n\nCook came to Florida State as a five-star running back recruit from Miami, Florida, and quickly moved himself into the rotation just a couple games into his freshman season. By the fifth game, against Syracuse, Cook was starting.\n\nPowerfully built at 5-foot-11 and 213 pounds, and blessed with an exceptional burst of speed, Cook is the second running back in FSU history to rush for 1,000 yards in three straight seasons along with Warrick Dunn.\n\nHe is also the first running back in ACC history to rush for more than 4,000 yards in three years.\n\nIn an interview with the Tallahassee Democrat last November, Dunn said he was thrilled Cook was able to become the program's new career rushing leader. Dunn's mark of 3,959 yards stood for two decades.\n\n“He can have it, he can have it,” Dunn said.\n\n“It has been 20 years, it’s time. It was a good run. It is surprising, shocking because there have been so many great runners at Florida State. Dalvin came at a good time in his career and he has been able to shatter all that.”\n\nCook finished his junior year with 1,765 rushing yards (135.7 yards per game) and 19 touchdowns. He also turned in an exceptional season as a receiver. Cook had 33 receptions for 488 yards and a touchdown.\n\nHe finished his career with 79 catches for 935 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nCook is projected as a first round pick in the NFL Draft, with some projections putting him inside the top-10. He would be the first FSU running back selected in the first round since Dunn was selected 12th by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1997.\n\nCook would be the first FSU running back selected in the top-10 since Sammie Smith was selected ninth by the Miami Dolphins.\n\nThe 2017 NFL Draft is scheduled to be held in Philadelphia from April 27 to 29."
