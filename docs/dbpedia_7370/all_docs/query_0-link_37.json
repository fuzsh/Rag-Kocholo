        "text": "The nationwide perspective on Florida State is not a positive one.\n\nThat’s not that surprising of a statement on its face, given the last year and a half, but you never really realize it until you venture outside of the Tallahassee area. This is not to say that all of Tallahassee blindly follows and accepts the actions of the university, rather it is a more nuanced discussion, one that happens with knowledge of context.\n\nFor example, it became an almost widespread belief that State Attorney Willie Meggs favorited football players in the wake of the Winston investigation, where he announced that there was no credible evidence to pursue a case with a smile that was nowhere near appropriate for the seriousness of the allegations. It’s understandable to think that Meggs was biased towards football players, if that was your first, and only, experience with him.\n\nIf you were to look into Meggs’ presence in the years of Florida State football, you would perhaps learn about the 1999 season, when Peter Warrick and Laveranues Coles walked out of a Dillard’s with $412.38 worth of clothes for $21.40. Warrick, a Heisman Trophy favorite, was charged with felony grand theft and suspended for two games. The charges were reduced to misdemeanor petty theft, and Warrick ended up finishing sixth in Heisman voting.\n\nYou would maybe stumble upon the story of Travis Johnson, who was accused of raping a track athlete in 2003. The alleged rape had happened 14 days after Johnson had shoulder surgery, and an all-female jury acquitted him in less than 30 minutes.\n\nOn Monday, August 26, Dalvin Cook was found not guilt on a misdemeanor battery charge in a similar amount of time. Cook was the one of two Seminoles charged with battery this summer; the other, of course, being De’Andre Johnson, who was caught on tape striking a woman just a day after Cook was accused of doing the same.\n\nA large part of the reason Cook was found not guilty was due to the lack of evidence in the case and a lack of trust in the account’s of the witnesses of the alleged crime. The only evidence that was present was a photograph of the accuser’s bloody lip, which according to the testifying police officer didn’t appear to be the result of getting punched in the face. It was a confusing case that included a story about a homeless man, who had expressed a desire to sue New Zealand, giving the phone number of a potential witness, who had been listening to those desires, to a police officer, and in the end, a case that a juror in the case expressed to the Tallahassee Democrat that was “a shame it went to trial.”\n\n“I understand they had to go that route,” the juror, Robert Kuhn, went on to say. “If they hadn’t, it would have been just letting a football player getting away with something. Obviously, people are still going to say that.”\n\nJohnson’s crime, both reported and had video released before the Cook investigation became public, triggered an apology from both head coach Jimbo Fisher and President John Thrasher. Cook’s charges garnered a much more widespread response; according to the Orlando Sentinel, FSU is looking into the “creation of a course designed to provide more in-depth instruction concerning the various responsibilities of student-athletes,” in addition to becoming a part of Russell Wilson’s “Pass the Peace,” a campaign against domestic violence.\n\nFlorida State has also hosted several speakers, including Maurice Clarett, Tim Brown and a team of Navy Seals, that have spoken on topics including domestic violence, peer pressure, anger management and sexual assault.\n\nMore or less, this was the first response that the university has had to the controversy that’s surrounded it recently, which is interesting because realistically, this is the first chance that it has had to have a response. Most of the outrage towards the university in the past was begat by Jameis Winston, and since Winston was never charged and was cleared in his student code of conduct hearing, there was no reason to ever punish him beyond his suspensions in baseball and football for taking crab legs and for cursing in the union, respectively.\n\nJohnson’s incident helped reinforce the image of the school, while Cook’s alerted the university to a potential problem. For a school that has had the appearance of standing by idly the response has been well-received, though it’s to be seen what the effect will be on how people perceive the program and school. Cook, who started practicing the day after the trial, will play for the Seminoles this year, and as one of the more talented running backs in the country, will probably have a successful year. Florida State, who has the 10th most arrests in the last five years with 16, is now on record on its desire to change the culture at the university.\n\nTwo years ago, there wasn’t enough evidence to charge Jameis Winston with sexual assault. This week, lack of evidence was the downfall of the state’s case against Dalvin Cook. While the State Attorney’s office wants to prove that it isn’t going easy on football players, the university is on a mission to make sure that there’s no reason to ask that question in the first place. After the last year and a half Tallahassee, and Florida State specifically, is being held to a higher standard, and the way that each deal with it are interesting."
