        "text": "Florida State running back Dalvin Cook will likely be drafted in the first round of the NFL Draft tonight. On the morning of his big day, it's cool, and a bit nostalgic, to look back at Cook before he was the star he is today.\n\nNoles247 has exclusive video of Cook at FSU's camp back in the summer of 2012. Cook was heading into his junior year of high school at Miami Central. He was also committed to Clemson at this point in his recruitment.\n\nIn the video you can see Cook being put through drills by then FSU running back coach, Eddie Gran. Gran is now the offensive coordinator at Kentucky."
