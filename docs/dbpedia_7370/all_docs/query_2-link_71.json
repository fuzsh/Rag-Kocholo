        "text": "Heisman hopeful Dalvin Cook entered the storied Florida State record books on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after passing Warrick Dunn’s single-season rushing record.\n\nCook took a carry to the right side of the offensive line, waited for his blocks to develop with a subtle stutter step, dropped his shoulder, and displayed that trademark acceleration to tear past defenders on the right side of the offensive line and into the record books.\n\nIt was a trademark carry.\n\nThe following play would be another classic Dalvin Cook run. His standard one cut and go. Cook planted a leg, exploded up the middle of the offensive line, ran through an arm tackle, and sauntered into the end zone to give Florida State the lead over North Carolina State.\n\nEvery dynasty has its unique icons. They define the great teams we root for. They give each era its own personality and story that fans use to banter back and forth with and identify with. Eighteen years ago, at the height of its record-shattering dynastic run, Florida State welcomed one of its greatest. Warrick Dunn stood at five foot eight. If you caught him after finishing off a bowl of jambalaya, you might have found his weight to be just north of one hundred and seventy pounds. Soft spoken. Unassuming.\n\nHe was the last person who you would think would hold the single season rushing record for twenty years at Florida State University. He came in as a defensive back, but he made a promise with Bobby Bowden. He would get a shot at running back. Florida State had an overabundance of running backs, and Florida State was in the running for a national title, but he would get his chance.\n\nIn 1993, during summer practice, Dunn got his chance. Dunn took a break from defensive back drills and got his opportunity to play running back in a scrimmage. Mickey Andrews, the legendary defensive coordinator, just shook his head in disbelief. He knew he lost a body on his defense. There was no way he was ever going to play defensive back. Warrick Dunn wasn’t big but he had the long, smooth stride of an Olympic sprinter and a heart the size of the Louisiana coastline. Dalvin Cook was a big time recruit from Miami. He spurned the University of Florida, toyed with Clemson and decided on Florida State. Cook looked the part of a star running back from the start of his collegiate career.\n\nFlorida State is in the middle of a special run. An era like this just does not come around very often. There is no time to wait around. Like Cook said, “The time is now.” From Jameis Winston to Dalvin Cook, to Jalen Ramsey, and Devonta Freeman. These are the icons we will look back at after we graduate college and identify with.\n\nAs for the Heisman trophy talk and if he should win it, Cook said, “yeah.” Straight to the point. Let’s enjoy the ride and see how many records have \"Cook\" next to them."
