        "text": "Associated Press\n\nJameis Winston had two interceptions in the first four minutes. And he added a third interception before the first quarter was over.\n\nFlorida State University has dug itself out of deficits before this season—but never with Winston playing this poorly, finishing with a career-high four interceptions and a career-low 125 passing yards.\n\nThat's when FSU coach Jimbo Fisher went with Plan B: Dalvin Cook to the right, Dalvin Cook to the left and Dalvin Cook up the middle. Cook ran 24 times for 144 yards, with both counting as season-high marks.\n\n\"The trump card today was Dalvin Cook,\" Fisher said. \"That defense is extremely good, and our offensive line did a very good job.\"\n\nIt's not ideal to take the ball out of the hands of a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback and put it into the hands of a heralded true freshman. But it worked.\n\nUsually, it's Winston who helps FSU piece together drives. But on Saturday, he completed just 12 of 24 passes, and two of them went for touchdowns to tight end Nick O'Leary.\n\nThis time, it was Cook who was the workhorse. With senior Karlos Williams injured and on the sideline, Fisher went to Cook.\n\nPhelan M. Ebenhack/Associated Press\n\nWith the game in doubt, FSU took possession of the ball after Florida's Austin Hardin missed a 42-yard field-goal attempt. FSU led just 21-19 with 9:42 on the clock, and Fisher decided to hand off to Cook.\n\nCook ran six times and caught a pass in a 10-play drive that ate up six minutes and 19 seconds. While the drive ended in a Roberto Aguayo field goal, FSU had drained the clock down to 3:23 left.\n\nWith Florida having to drive the length of the field and score a touchdown to win, the Gators couldn't deliver.\n\nBut Cook certainly did.\n\n\"It just says a lot about that guy's character and his heart—the way he fights and claws for those inches,\" FSU receiver Rashad Greene said. \"And we continue to go down and move that football.\"\n\nCook has come through in some pressure situations for FSU. With Williams (ankle) and Mario Pender (concussion) out against Syracuse University on Oct. 11, Cook ran 23 times for 122 yards and a touchdown. And at the University of Louisville, he had nine carries for 110 yards and two touchdowns, as FSU stormed back from a 21-0 deficit.\n\nTwo weeks ago, in his hometown of Miami, Cook had 92 yards and a pair of second-half touchdown runs.\n\nFSU's offense is often driven by a senior-filled offensive line, a senior playmaker (Greene) and a senior tight end (O'Leary). And Winston is usually the engine of the offense. But on Saturday, it was a freshman.\n\n\"Dalvin's just getting better and better as each week goes by,\" FSU center Cameron Erving said. \"He's a dynamic player. He can break tackles, he's fast [and] he's elusive. There's not enough positive things you can say about Dalvin. He's been very, very vital to our success.\""
