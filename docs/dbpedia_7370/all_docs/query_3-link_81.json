Why did you choose (Enter school name)? A: My college was a true a maturity phase. I played in two offensive systems, that I believe helped me become versatile and a student of the game. Because I had to learn more schemes than some players had to in their career. I attended Southern Virginia solely on the opportunity to grow as a athlete under a former Division 1 coach and a former NFL player on the staff.\n\nQ: What would you consider to be your biggest accomplishment in your sports career so far? A: My biggest accomplishment was to be the first SVU player to receive first team all conference back to back years and to hold several records at my school.\n\nQ: What do you consider to be one of the more important things you learned from the coaching staff while playing at (Enter school name)? A: While attending Southern Virginia, playing under Ed Mulitalo he instilled that in life you create good habits or bad habits. Consistency of good habits become routinely.\n\nQ: How was your career impacted due to the 2020 pandemic and what have you learned from the adversity? A: The 2020 pandemic caused me to lose the opportunity to perform in front of scouts at my pro day.\n\nQ: What was your major and what are your plans if football doesn’t work out? A: My major was business administration. If football fails I plan to find a opportunity to coach.\n\nQ: What would your current/past teammates say about you and your qualities? A: I’m a leader, disciplined and strict in my craft, determined, and goal driven. Coachable, playmaker, and great team player. (Mamba mentality)\n\nQ: What has been one of the most memorable plays of your career at any level? A: One of the most memorable plays I have made is during my career is being placed in a wildcat formation (QB) on the last offensive drive of the game with 1 minute left to play. Driving our offense all the way down to the opposite side of the field to set up the game winning touchdown the next play.\n\nQ: What has been your biggest challenge and how do you manage it? A: My biggest challenge was trusting my speed my junior year. I took the time and opportunity to run track and build confidence in my speed. Also with the support of my coaches to just trust my abilities.\n\nQ: If you could compare yourself to a pro athlete, who would that be and why? A: Dalvin Cook is my best comparison. I resemble him the most due to his vision, patience, balance, speed, and his ability to catch out the back field. His ability to cause defenses to adjust to his skills, creating open lanes through the passing game. His ability to see cut back lanes develop as the blocking scheme plays through.\n\nQ: What is your biggest strength that you bring to a professional team and why should pro scouts consider you? A: My biggest strength I possess is my ability to be a factor in not only the run game, but the pass game as well. I also take pride in protecting my quarterback. My passion for the game is contagious, when I step on the field it is strictly business and I want to get better in all categories. Pro scouts should consider me because I have great contact balance, power, strength, agility, ball security, vision, and receiving abilities.\n\nQ: Are you involved in mentoring, a charity or do you “give back” or ”pay it forward” in your community? A: Yes, I am involved in summer camps to help the youth develop quality football traits.\n\nA: I’m a leader, disciplined and strict in my craft, determined, and goal driven. Coachable, playmaker, and great team player. (Mamba mentality)\n\n~ Akiva Wdge\n\nQ: How are you preparing for the 2021 National Scouting Combine and what are your goals? A: I am training with a track coach to prepare for my forty yard dash, also showing me techniques for my L drill and shuttle. Then I have a strength and conditioning coach.\n\nQ: What would be your ultimate achievement? A: Being able to play in the NFL and to move my mother out of rough area she raised me in. Q: What do you enjoy doing when not playing football? A: If I’m not working out, I tend to watch boxing.\n\nQ: If you could make a positive impact on all of society what would it be and why? A: Buying back houses and apartments and helping them be affordable for the people that struggle to pay rent or own homes.\n\nQ: Who is or has been the most influential person in your life? A: My mother has been the biggest inspiration in my life. Seeing her some nights sacrifice food and time for I can be in position to thrive. Work multiple jobs to make ends so we can survive. She is my rock and I work my hardest, so she can retire her one day and enjoy life.\n\nQ: What is something unique about you that people would find interesting? A: Something that no one knows, but may find interesting. Is that I wanted to be a offensive lineman growing up. I used to love watching offensive tackles."
