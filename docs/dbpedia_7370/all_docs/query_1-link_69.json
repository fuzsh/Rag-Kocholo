        "text": "Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher thinks Dalvin Cook belongs in New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony.\n\nMichigan fans believe Jabril Peppers should be there as well.\n\nOne or both may get an invitation, but the Cook-Peppers battle might be one of the biggest star-power matchups of bowl season as No. 10 Florida State meets No. 6 Michigan at the Orange Bowl on Dec. 30.\n\nMiami also happens to be Cook's hometown.\n\n“He’s motivated everywhere he goes, but I’m sure he’ll want to play well in front of his home crowd, there’s no doubt,” Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher said tonight via teleconference. “But I think Michigan will try and have something to say about that, too.”\n\nThe Seminoles will travel less than 500 miles, deep into the heart of their prime recruiting territory and fan base, after a 9-3 season in which they lost to No. 3 Clemson, No. 15 Louisville and North Carolina.\n\n►Related: Windsor: Hard to believe Orange Bowl is a consolation prize for U-M\n\n►Related: U-M vs. Florida State: Orange Bowl scouting report, prediction\n\nCook, Florida State's star running back, could be playing in his final college game before heading to the NFL. The 5-foot-11, 213-pound junior has run for 1,620 yards and 18 touchdowns on 268 carries this season, adding 30 catches for 426 yards and another score.\n\nCook has been the driving force behind an offense that averages nearly 475 yards and scores 35.3 points per game.\n\n“I think it’s a blessing that his family can be in his hometown to watch him play in a major bowl game and possibly his last game at Florida State,” Fisher said. “You don’t know, he hasn’t made a decision, and when we get the information back, he’ll make that. But you’re talking about one of the all-time greats in Florida State history – I think in college football history. He’s a dynamic player.”\n\nUSA TODAY handicapper and sports analyst Danny Sheridan last week listed Peppers as a 20-to-1 shot for the Heisman and Cook a 25-to-1 pick. Those are the fifth- and sixth-best odds to win it, with Louisville QB Lamar Jackson and Clemson QB Deshaun Watson the favorites.\n\nThe athletic Peppers could be charged with spying on Cook and keeping him bottled up to try and make FSU quarterback Deondre Francois beat the Wolverines with his arm. The redshirt freshman has passed for 3,128 yards and 18 touchdowns with six interceptions this season.\n\n►Related: U-M players accept missing out on College Football Playoff\n\nFisher said he remembers watching Peppers play in high school. ESPN.com ranked Peppers the No. 2 prep player in the class of 2014 out of Paramus, N.J., while Cook was rated No. 21. A third-year sophomore, Peppers also could declare for the NFL draft following the season.\n\n“He’s one of the unique guys that’s physical enough to play where he does at the line of scrimmage,” Fisher said of Peppers. “Almost like a nickel back, like a linebacker but can go play safety or corner or whatever he has to do. … He’s a very, very unique player and is one of the great players in college football.”\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh said he has just a rudimentary knowledge of Florida State right now after traveling much of the day.\n\n“We’ve really just been able to look through a keyhole and seen Florida State but just a few times on TV,” Harbaugh said. “I haven’t been able to watch any of the coaches’ tape yet. … That’s what I know. Not much at this point.”\n\nThey’ll find out soon enough, just as Peppers and Cook will about their Heisman hopes."
