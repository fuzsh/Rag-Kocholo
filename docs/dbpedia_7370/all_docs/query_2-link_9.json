        "text": "Minnesota Vikings running back Dalvin Cook already has a few accolades.\n\nThe 25-year-old is a two-time Pro Bowler with the Vikings. Last season, in 14 games with the Vikings, he had a career-high 1,557 yards rushing and four total touchdowns. In college at Florida State, he played in the 2014 College Football Playoff and was first-team All-American and All-ACC twice in his three seasons with the Seminoles. In his career as a Seminole, Cook set several school records, including breaking Warrick Dunn's mark for career rushing yards."
