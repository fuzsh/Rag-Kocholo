        "text": "Dalvin Cook\n\nFlorida State running back Dalvin Cook was found not guilty of punching a woman, likely paving his way to return to the Seminoles.\n\n(Associated Press)\n\nFlorida State running back Dalvin Cook was found not guilty of punching a woman on Monday, a decision that could pave the way for the return of the Seminoles' leading runner.\n\nThree of Cook's teammates, as well as an FSU graduate student, testified that Cook did not punch Madison Geohegan on June 23, according to reports from the trial.\n\nCook, a 19-year-old sophomore, had been suspended from the FSU football team by coach Jimbo Fisher pending the resolution of the case. The running back rushed for 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns on 170 carries last year, an average of 5.9 per touch. He is likely FSU's top returning offensive player. Syracuse plays at Florida State on Oct. 31.\n\nGeohegan and her friend alleged that Cook punched her after she said she wasn't impressed that the four players competed for Florida State. The incident was one in a wave of high-profile problems FSU players have had with football players regarding women. Six players have been charged with violence against women while Fisher has been coaching the team, according to the Miami Herald, but few have been convicted.\n\nAccording to reports, Cook's lawyer argued that Geohegan's story \"didn't add up,\" and a Tallahassee police officer said the injuries did not look consistent with a woman being hit in the face by a football player.\n\nAnother FSU player, De'Andre Johnson, was kicked off the team earlier this year after video surfaced of punching a woman, and quarterback Jameis Winston, the quarterback of last year's team and No. 1 NFL Draft pick, was accused of rape before being found not guilty.\n\nThe Seminoles are ranked No. 10 in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 and are one of the leading candidates to win the ACC and challenge for a spot in the College Football Playoff."
