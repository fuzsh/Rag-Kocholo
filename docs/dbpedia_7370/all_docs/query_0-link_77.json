        "text": "Despite their successes and setbacks, the Cook brothers continue to treasure their experience in the NFL, both as a brotherhood and as individuals. “Having him as an older brother is a plus” for James Cook as he said once. However, apart from Dalvin Cook, James also has 5 more siblings including 3 sisters and 2 half brothers.\n\nWhile his older brother Dalvin Cook is currently a player for the Baltimore Ravens, James Cook is a running back for the Buffalo Bills. NFL veteran James Cook has six siblings, to be exact. Apart from Dalvin Cook, James has two half-brother brothers: Demarcus Cook, and DeAndre Burnett. And Daneisha Cook, Jameisha Cook, and Jamiya Cook are Cook’s three sisters. Dalvin and James Cook have two half-siblings as well who are Demarcus Cook and DeAndre Burnett.\n\nWho are James Cook’s six Siblings?\n\nJames Cook’s only other sibling who plays in the NFL is Dalvin Cook. James was chosen by the Buffalo Bills with selection number 63 in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Cook began the Bills season as Devin Singletary’s backup running back in his first season. He made 89 rushing attempts for slightly over 500 yards, averaging 5.7 yards per carry, and scored two touchdowns on the ground. The 24-year-old Miami native has credited his brother Dalvin Cook for being his mentor and supporting him in all things football-related. The two brothers have a strong relationship with one another.\n\nDalvin Cook, James Cook’s older brother, is a 28-year-old NFL player who was born in Opa-Locka, Florida, on August 10, 1995. James Cook, on the other hand, was born in Miami, Florida on September 25, 1999. As a running back, Dalvin Cook played for the Florida State Seminoles football team for three years in college, becoming the program’s all-time leading rusher. 46 running touchdowns and 4,464 rushing yards were his final two-year total with the Seminoles.\n\nWhile both Dalvin Cook and James Cook shone in their respective careers, their half-brother 18-year-old Demarcus Cook had quite an unusual life. He was even arrested in mid-2022 when he was located at the crime scene with a gunshot wound.\n\nDeAndre Burnett is the Cook brothers’ other half-brother who does not have the same last name. Out of the entire family, he is the only one who has started playing basketball. Burnett, who is a year older than Dalvin, spent one season as a collegiate basketball player at the University of Miami before transferring to Ole Miss.\n\nAfter being left out of the 2018 NBA Draft, Burnett sought his fortune overseas. He spent a year as a player for the Leicester Riders in the British Basketball League, signed with Kharkivski Sokoly in November 2019 to play in the Ukrainian Basketball Superleague, and announced his retirement on February 24, 2020.\n\nApart from brothers, James Cook has three sisters who live in Miami sharing a close bond with their family. Daneisha Cook, the eldest sister is a graduate of American Senior High School and maintains a relatively private life. Daneisha has been featured on her mother Varondria White’s social media, particularly in her birthday appreciation posts.\n\nBorn on July 19, 2001, Jameisha is the second youngest of the Cook siblings. She graduated from Miami Central Senior High School in 2019. Jameisha has aspirations of becoming a model and has expressed interest in various creative fields.\n\nThe youngest of the sisters, Jamiya was born on September 13, 2002. She graduated from Miami Central Senior High School in 2021. Jamiya has previously worked with the Northside Panthers Optimist Club. Last year, on her birthday, Jamiya Cook’s mother shared a beautiful video where we can see lively Jamiya having so much fun!"
