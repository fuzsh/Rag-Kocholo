        "text": "Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher and President John Thrasher have promised changes at the school after running back Dalvin Cook was charged with misdemeanor battery Friday for allegedly striking a woman.\n\nCook, who was indefinitely suspended from the football program, is the second Seminole player in the past week to be charged with hitting a woman.\n\nIn a joint statement, Fisher promised FSU “will do better” and he will “not tolerate anything less” when it comes to educating and holding players responsible for their actions while Thrasher said Fisher will meet immediately with his team “to reiterate, in no uncertain terms, our expectations of them.” Thrasher also plans to speak and will set up a meeting with State Attorney Willie Meggs and the Seminoles.\n\n“I have no tolerance for the type of behavior alleged in these cases,” Thrasher’s statement read. “We expect all of our students, especially our student-athletes who represent this university in the public spotlight, to adhere to the highest standards.”\n\nCook, 19, was charged for allegedly striking a 21-year-old woman outside of a Tallahassee bar on June 23. The incident occurred one night before former FSU quarterback De’Andre Johnson was caught on security cameras punching a woman at a bar. Johnson, a freshman, was charged with misdemeanor battery and Florida State dismissed the quarterback after the video surfaced.\n\n“I do not tolerate the type of behavior that was captured on video and that was most recently alleged,” Fisher’s statement read. “We spend a good deal of time educating our student-athletes about appropriate behavior and their responsibilities as representatives of Florida State. The majority of our players are exemplary, but clearly we must place an even stronger emphasis on this, and I personally promise we will.\n\n“I remain committed to educating our young men and holding them accountable for their actions. … We will do better. I will not tolerate anything less.”\n\nMeggs told ESPN he sought a warrant for Cook’s arrest after meeting with the woman, who is not a Florida State student, and a female witness.\n\nThe woman told ESPN that Cook punched her several times in the face after an argument. According to ESPN’s report, the woman said she refused to give her phone number to a man who approached her, who was not Cook. When the argument became heated, Cook began to strike her.\n\nThe woman, who spoke to ESPN on the condition she remain anonymous, said the men “kept telling me to Google them. They told me they were football players and they could buy me in two years.”\n\nAccording to ESPN:\n\nThe woman who said Cook punched her (said) that her bottom lip was split and her nose was sore the next day. The woman said she identified Cook as the man who struck her in a photo lineup with two (Tallahassee Police Department) investigators on July 1. She told police she wanted to pursue criminal charges against him.\n\nCook, a rising sophomore, was the Seminoles’ leading rusher last season with 1,008 yards. He is on several pre-season All-ACC teams and even mentioned as an outside candidate for the Heisman Trophy. He was a former Florida “Mr. Football” at Miami Central High School.\n\nCook was involved in two other legal issues while at Florida State. Cook was involved in “a BB-gun battle” in which cars and residences at an apartment complex in Tallahassee were damaged. According to ESPN, Cook was charged with criminal mischief and given pre-trial intervention in December, which he completed on June 16.\n\nLast July, Cook was named as an “associate” in an aggravated assault case in which police were investigating whether two men brandished a firearm at a neighbor. The incident happened at Cook’s apartment, but one of the accusers told ESPN’s Outside the Lines he didn’t believe the weapon belonged to Cook."
