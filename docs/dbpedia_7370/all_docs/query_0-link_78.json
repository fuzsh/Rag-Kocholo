        "text": "TALLAHASSEE — Wearing a backward black Adidas hat and a relaxed smile, Florida State safety Derwin James posed for pictures and cracked jokes with visiting Jaguars cornerback Jalen Ramsey during the Seminoles' Pro Day on Tuesday.\n\nWhile former teammates went through position drills in the last public phase of the NFL pre-draft process, James rested comfortably knowing he's done enough to become one of the coveted players in this year's class.\n\n\"I just feel like I’m the best player in this draft,\" James said. \"There's no question. I’ve shown everything I can show and proven everything I can prove.”\n\nJames, a possible top-10 pick who along with N.C. State defensive end Bradley Chubb is considered a game-changing talent on defense, skipped Florida State's bowl game last season to begin preparing for the draft. That decision looked wise after his impressive performance at the Scouting Combine.\n\nThe redshirt sophomore ran the 40-yard dash in a speedy 4.47 seconds, showed off a 40-inch vertical jump and put up a respectable 21 reps on the bench press. James said his agent advised him to skip doing any position drills at FSU's Pro Day.\n\n“It kind of shocked me because I wanted to do it; I wanted to compete,\" James said. \"I’m 100 percent healthy, so I was kind of mad. But he told me what was best and I had to take it.”\n\nThe team that takes James is getting a chiseled 6-foot-3 safety who totaled 84 tackles with 11 pass break-ups, two interceptions and a sack for the Seminoles last season. His high level of play helped allay concerns after James missed most of his sophomore season when he suffered a lateral meniscus tear in his left knee during a Week 2 game against Charleston Southern.\n\nJames said the knee injury was a topic he discussed with many teams during meetings at the Scouting Combine. Questions will likely continue to be asked about the injury as James goes through private meetings with teams — he said Tuesday that several are scheduled — but he has no concerns.\n\n“I know how I feel about me,\" James said. \"Whatever team does decide to take me, the rest will take care of itself.”\n\nRamsey, who starred at Florida State before being selected No. 5 overall by the Jaguars in 2016, said he returned for the Seminoles' Pro Day to support James. Last year, Ramsey stumped for FSU running back Dalvin Cook to be a high pick. On Tuesday, he spoke effusively of the type of player he believes James will be for the team that picks him.\n\n“They’re getting the best player in the draft — easily,\" Ramsey said. \"There’s no other guy, no other safety, no other person in the secondary, no other person on the defensive side of the ball who is better than Derwin.\n\n\"The impact that he’ll make from Day 1 is crazy. I can’t even say the sky is the limit because he doesn’t have any limits. He can be as good as he wants to be.”\n\nJames was the star of a Florida State contingent that included defensive end Josh Sweat, cornerback Tarvarus McFadden and receiver Auden Tate.\n\nSweat, a junior, totaled 12 1/2 sacks over the past two seasons and has seen his stock rise after running a 4.53 in the 40 at the Combine and displaying versatile edge rush abilities that NFL teams desire.\n\nMcFadden and Tate, also juniors, are interesting prospects as well. McFadden had eight interceptions as a sophomore in 2016 and totaled 10 pass break-ups last season. Tate caught 10 touchdowns in 2017, including three during a 42-13 bowl victory against Southern Mississippi.\n\n“Training for the Combine, training for the 40, is very stressful,\" McFadden said. \"You just want to do so well. You want to exceed limits. It’s almost over now. You’ve got team workouts and things like that, but now it is getting closer and closer to the time, so I’m getting more and more excited.”\n\nSaid Tate: “I feel like a weight lifted off my chest. Last time running the 40, last time doing those drills. It’s football. Some of that can translate, some can’t. At the end of the day, everything happens between the white lines.”\n\nMost of the time James spent between the white lines Tuesday was to soak in one more moment before continuing to prepare. James said he will attend the draft at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, and is ready to compete as a rookie.\n\n“I came in relaxed and confident,\" James said. \"It’s football. People try to make it harder than what it really is. At the end of the day, it’s football. Football is just easy to me.”"
