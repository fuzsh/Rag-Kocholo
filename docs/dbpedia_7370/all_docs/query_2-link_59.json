        "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The last time No. 17 Florida State visited Syracuse, running back Dalvin Cook was third on the Seminoles’ depth chart and looking for an opportunity to prove himself.\n\nTwo years later, Cook is on the precipice of becoming the Seminoles’ career rushing leader.\n\nThe junior, who has 3,941 career yards, needs 19 yards on Saturday to break Warrick Dunn’s 20-year-old mark. He is also 59 yards away from becoming just the sixth player in Atlantic Coast Conference history to reach 4,000 yards and would be the first to do it in three years.\n\nTed Brown, the former North Carolina State standout, is the A.C.C.’s career rushing leader, with 4,602 yards from 1975 to 1978. He is also the quickest to have reached 4,000 yards, having done so in his 38th game. Saturday will be Cook’s 36th.\n\nCook said that he had talked to Dunn before the Oct. 29 game against Clemson but that there had not been any discussion about the record. Cook reiterated this week how much he admired Dunn for what he had done on and off the field."
