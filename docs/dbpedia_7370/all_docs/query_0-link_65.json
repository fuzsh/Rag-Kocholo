        "text": "Personal Life\n\nFor the longest time, James Cook was known only as the little brother of Dalvin Cook and not one of the top running backs in college football and an NFL prospect. Dalvin Cook was a prolific high school running back prospect coming out of South Florida, an All-American at Florida State and is now with the Minnesota Vikings. “(James) would drag his shoulder pads, take it to practice to him,” Cook’s mother, Varondria Burnett, said. “James would do everything Dalvin did. I think at first it was really hard for him. My brother is this. They want me to be that.” But James Cook eventually carved his own path through the recruiting process, signed with Georgia out of Miami Central and is a key reason why the Bulldogs played for a national title in the 2021 season."
