He played college football at Georgia and was selected by the Bills in the second round of the 2022 NFL draft.\n\nCook is the younger brother of fellow NFL running back Dalvin Cook.[1]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nCook grew up in Miami, Florida, and attended Miami Central Senior High School. He rushed for 709 yards and eight touchdowns on 99 carries as a freshman.[2] After his freshman year, Cook took extra courses and reclassified from a sophomore to a junior.[3] As a senior, he rushed for 782 yards and 10 touchdowns on 91 carries. Cook rushed for 2,019 yards and 30 touchdowns during his high school career.[4]\n\nCook was a highly rated recruit and initially committed to play college football at Florida State, where his brother was playing, after his freshman year of high school.[5] He later decommitted during the summer before his senior year.[6] Cook later signed a letter of intent to play at Georgia after considering offers from Louisville and Florida.[7] Cook transferred to Miami Northwestern Senior High School after his senior football season for his final semester of high school.[8]\n\nCollege career\n\n[edit]\n\nCook played in 13 games as a freshman and gained 284 yards and scored two touchdowns on 41 carries with eight receptions for 89 yards.[9] He played in all 14 of Georgia's games and rushed 31 times for 188 yards and two touchdowns while also catching 16 passes for 132 yards in his sophomore season.[10] In 2020, Cook was the team's second-leading rusher with 303 yards and three touchdowns on 45 carries and caught 16 passes for 225 yards and two touchdowns.[11] Cook missed the 2021 Peach Bowl following the death of his father.[12]\n\nCook rushed for 728 yards and seven touchdowns and caught 27 passes for 284 yards and four touchdowns as a senior as the Bulldogs won the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship.[13] He was the leading receiver for Georgia with 112 yards and one touchdown on four receptions in the team's 34–11 win over Michigan in the Orange Bowl semifinal game.[14] After the end of the season, Cook declared that he would be entering the 2022 NFL draft.[15]\n\nCollegiate statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason GP Rushing Receiving Att Yds Avg TD Rec Yds Avg TD 2018 10 41 284 6.9 2 8 89 11.1 0 2019 13 31 188 6.1 2 16 132 8.3 0 2020 8 45 303 6.7 3 16 225 14.1 2 2021 15 113 728 6.4 7 27 284 10.5 4 Career 46 230 1,503 6.5 14 67 730 10.9 6\n\nProfessional career\n\n[edit]\n\nPre-draft measurables Height Weight Arm length Hand span 40-yard dash 10-yard split 20-yard split Vertical jump Broad jump 5 ft 11 in\n\n(1.80 m) 199 lb\n\n(90 kg) 30+3⁄4 in\n\n(0.78 m) 9+3⁄8 in\n\n(0.24 m) 4.42 s 1.54 s 2.59 s 33.0 in\n\n(0.84 m) 10 ft 4 in\n\n(3.15 m) All values from NFL Combine[16][17][18]\n\nCook was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the second round, 63rd overall, in the 2022 NFL draft.[19] In Week 1, Cook made his NFL debut against the Los Angeles Rams. On his first career carry, Cook fumbled after a 2-yard gain. He did not receive another offensive touch for the remainder of the game.[20] In Week 5, against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cook scored his first professional touchdown on a 24-yard rush in the 38–3 victory.[21] In Week 13, against the New England Patriots, he had 105 scrimmage yards in the 24–10 victory.[22] Overall, as a rookie, Cook appeared in 16 games. He finished with 89 carries for 507 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns to go along with 21 receptions for 180 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.[23] Cook scored a rushing touchdown in the Wild Card Round 34–31 victory over the Miami Dolphins.[24]\n\nCook became Buffalo's primary running back for the 2023 season with previous starter Devin Singletary departing for the Houston Texans in free agency,[25] though goal-line and pass protection snaps went to veteran signing Latavius Murray. Against the Dallas Cowboys in week 15, Cook attained career highs in several single-game categories, including rush attempts (25), rush yards (179), total scrimmage yards (221), and total touchdowns (2), as the Bills routed Dallas 31–10.[26] The following week against the Los Angeles Chargers, Cook surpassed 1,000 rushing yards on the season, becoming the first Bills running back to do so since LeSean McCoy in 2017.[27]\n\nNFL career statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team Games Rushing Receiving Fumbles GP GS Att Yds Y/A Lng TD Rec Yds Y/R Lng TD Fum Lost 2022 BUF 16 0 89 507 5.7 33 2 21 180 8.6 41 1 1 1 2023 BUF 17 13 237 1,122 4.7 42 2 44 445 10.1 48 4 4 2 Career 33 13 326 1,629 5.0 42 4 65 625 9.6 48 5 5 3\n\nPostseason\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Team Games Rushing Receiving Fumbles GP GS Att Yds Y/A Lng TD Rec Yds Y/R Lng TD Fum Lost 2022 BUF 2 0 17 52 3.1 13 1 0 0 0.0 0 0 0 0 2023 BUF 2 2 36 140 3.9 12 0 8 26 3.3 8 0 0 0 Career 4 2 53 192 3.6 13 1 8 26 3.3 8 0 0 0\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nCook was arrested by Athens police in December 2019 for driving with an open alcohol container and driving without a valid license.[28]\n\nIn July 2020, Cook crashed into five unoccupied parked cars near downtown Athens. Moments before, according to police, Cook was traveling up to 85 mph, nearly striking an oncoming vehicle. Athens-Clark County deputy solicitor Janna Landreth offered to drop additional charges in the case if Cook pleaded guilty to reckless driving, for which Cook would have to pay a $670 fine, supply financial restitution to at-most two of the five damaged vehicles, and complete a defensive-driving course. Cook subsequently failed to appear in court relating to this case, for which Georgia Bulldogs football Director of Player Support Bryant Gantt claimed responsibility. Cook was not penalized for the missed date.[29]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
