        "text": "Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n\nFlorida State running back Dalvin Cook is being investigated as an associate in an aggravated assault incident by Tallahassee police following a July situation.\n\nESPN's Brett McMurphy first reported the case:\n\nThe Tallahassee Police Department also issued a statement confirming the veracity of the case, citing an ESPN FOIA request regarding Florida State football players. Public records show ESPN requested potential arrest records of 360 Florida State athletes though Cook is the only one named. Another closed case involving an unnamed former player was also mentioned, but the TPD declined to offer the student-athlete's name or give case details.\n\n\"We are committed to ensuring that every citizen of this community, including our university students, know that we take every report of possible criminal activity seriously,\" Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said. \"We also have an obligation, under state law, to respond to national media requests such as this and have done so professionally and with a commitment to openness.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nCook, a true freshman from Miami, rushed for 905 yards and eight touchdowns during the regular season. He was named the ACC Championship Game Most Valuable Player after rushing for 177 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries in the Seminoles' 37-35 win over Georgia Tech. As the season has progressed, Cook has taken an increased role and for large chucks supplanted senior running back Karlos Williams.\n\nThe Seminoles' level of knowledge about the case is unclear. According to records released, Cook is listed as an \"associate\" in an altercation where two men brandished firearms at another resident. Aggravated assault cases involving guns in Florida are subject to a minimum three-year prison sentence if found guilty.\n\nThe case against Cook is still ongoing. Neither DeLeo nor the Tallahassee Police Department offered further details on the investigation.\n\nFlorida State has not indicated whether the case will affect Cook's status for the College Football Playoff. The Seminoles play Oregon at the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1."
