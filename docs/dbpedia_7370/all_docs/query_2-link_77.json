        "text": "December 31, 2016\n\nMIAMI GARDENS -- Dalvin Cook, the star junior tailback whose dazzling displays re-wrote the Florida State record books, will forgo his senior year after declaring for the NFL Draft.\n\nCook was widely expected to leave FSU and announced Saturday on Instagram he would be leaving to pursue a professional career. It comes less than 24 hours after his team's 33-32 victory over Michigan in the Capital One Orange Bowl at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nIn his final performance, the Miami native rushed for 145 yards and a touchdown about 25 minutes away from his boyhood home.\n\nCook's announcement was a live broadcast which drew more than 5,000 viewers. He thanked his coaches, teammates and FSU fans for their support before making the announcement.\n\nHe leaves FSU as one of the program's all-time greatest players. Cook will end his career with a school-record 4,464 rushing yards and 46 touchdowns. The author of several records, he ran for 1,765 yards in his final season. Cook re-set the school mark for most rushing yards in a season, a distinction he held when running for 1,691 yards last season.\n\nCook also tied the record for most touchdowns in a season. He shares the mark with Greg Allen, who ran for 20 during the 1982 season.\n\nSeveral mock drafts project Cook as a first-round pick who will be taken in the middle of the first.\n\nRated as a five-star prospect by Rivals, capturing Cook was one of the biggest masterstrokes of Jimbo Fisher's career. Cook, a one-time Clemson commit, signed a financial grant-in-aid agreement with Florida, FSU and Miami before signing with the Seminoles.\n\nThe former Mr. Florida Football winner ran for a freshman school-record 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns in his first season. That year, FSU reached the College Football playoff semifinal where it lost to Oregon.\n\nCook's sophomore year was when he became one of college football's biggest stars. He played through ankle and hamstring issues to rush for a then-single season school record 1,691 yards and 19 touchdowns. His consistency buoyed an inconsistent offense with FSU reaching the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl and finishing the season 10-3.\n\nBoth he and the Seminoles entered the 2016 season with high expectations. FSU was set to challenge for a national title while Cook was a Heisman Trophy favorite. He was held below the 100-yard barrier in his first three games but ended the regular season rushing for more than 100 yards in six of the team's final seven games.\n\nCook's leadership also came into play following the team's jarring 3-2 start. Both he and senior defensive end DeMarcus Walker spearheaded the group into a New Year's Six and/or BCS national championship game for a fifth straight year. Only Alabama, with six, has a longer active streak.\n\n\"What I going to miss is watching him in practice talk to the young guys,\" Fisher said after the Orange Bowl. \"What I am going to miss is in the weight room in the summer when he's working hard or harder like DeMarcus [Walker] and these guys.\n\n\"His work ethic and his demeanor and the way he's changed these guys, the meetings we had, and I would call and say, 'Would you talk to so and so. We've got to get him to do right.' Anything I ever ask him to do, and the effect he had on his teammates, is what I'm truly going to miss.\""
