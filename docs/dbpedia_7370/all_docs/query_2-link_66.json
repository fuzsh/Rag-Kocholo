        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Dalvin Cook grew up watching Miami running backs, and never did he imagine being where he is today: the face of rival Florida State.\n\nMORE: Top 40 college football players | Preseason Top 25\n\nThe Miami native chose to be a Seminole rather than a Hurricane more than two years ago and has prospered as a running back ever since. Back then Cook was a 5-11, 190-pound recruit. Today, he's a dominant 213-pound junior and one of the nation's premier players.\n\n“I think at any point in a game I can bust out a run,” Cook said Friday at the ACC Kickoff in Charlotte. “That’s part of being a game-changer, and I think that’s what I am.”\n\nAs a former No. 1 prospect in Florida and No. 2 running back nationally, Cook set a Florida State freshman record with 1,008 yards and eight touchdowns on just 170 carries. Then, he put up even better numbers as a sophomore: 229 carries for 1,691 yards and 19 touchdowns. He rewrote Florida State history — again — as he became the all-time single-season leader in rushing yards and all-purpose yards, passing a 20-year record of 1,242 yards set by his idol, Warrick Dunn.\n\nBut there wasn't much, if any, Heisman talk — until now.\n\nMORE: Heisman Trophy all-time winners\n\nThough already an early candidate for college football's highest honor, Cook is not paying attention.\n\n“It can either mess with you or it can motivate you,” Cook said. “I’m self-motivated. I have to motivate myself and push myself. And my teammates, they can push me.”\n\nSenior DeMarcus Walker has watched Cook grow into a mature player and teammate. As a defensive end, however, Walker said he’s not allowed to hit Cook during practices, per coach’s orders.\n\nNot that the 6-4, 280-pound defensive stalwart wants to, though.\n\n“He’s on my team,” Walker said. “I don’t want to hurt him, the best running back in college football.”\n\nMORE: Clemson has even better shot at perfection\n\nBesides, Walker knows Cook is fast. Really fast. Even better for the Seminoles is that Cook is healthy again, after sitting out their spring season with a shoulder injury that required surgery. Now, he’s 100 percent — feeling stronger and faster — and going into the 2016 season as, in his words, a “healthy Dalvin.”\n\nThe artillery is locked, loaded and ready to go for Cook to have yet another standout season. Florida State’s offense returns all 11 of its starters, but its positions won’t just be handed over to them on a silver platter. Coach Jimbo Fisher, entering his seventh season with the Seminoles, preaches that every position must be earned.\n\n“If you don’t want to play, we’ll replace you,” he said. “That’s the way it has to be, and it’s not a threat. It’s a standard.”\n\nMORE: Top Seminoles of all time | Preseason All-Americans\n\nAs one of four team captains, Cook also holds his teammates accountable. They can’t slack off on his watch. They have to give it their all, always.\n\n“His ability to see them not doing it and go put his arms around them, talk to them or actually get on them, he has grown into the role of his responsibility [in order] to leave his legacy here as the guys did before him,” Fisher said.\n\nAnd it’s not just in front of his coach that Cook shows maturity.\n\nWalker believes he and Cook are a lot alike. They’re both vocal leaders with a similar mindset, but they’re always able to talk things through and come to a mutual understanding.\n\n“Going in, usually people think two head coaches clash, or two leaders clash — me and him never clash,” Cook’s fellow team captain said.\n\nMORE: Top 16 programs since 2000 | Top 25 running backs\n\nCook knows his teammates won’t let him down. He's right beside them, counting down the days.\n\n“I see it in their eyes, their demeanor, the way they go about themselves,” he said. “They’re getting ready for Sept. 5.”\n\nFlorida State kicks off its season in Orlando, Fla., against Ole Miss. Come that Monday, the Seminoles best believe the Rebels studied Cook’s play in films. A lot.\n\nIn fact, every defense slated to take on the Seminoles will monitor Cook this season, and he knows it."
