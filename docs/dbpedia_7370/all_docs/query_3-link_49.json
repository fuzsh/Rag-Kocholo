If you wish to have the online presence removed, you can contact us to remove the guestbook online. Changes to an online obituary can be handled through the obituary desk. Call us with further questions.\n\nPayment Procedure:\n\nPre-payment is required for all obituary notices prior to publication by the deadline specified below in our deadline schedule.
