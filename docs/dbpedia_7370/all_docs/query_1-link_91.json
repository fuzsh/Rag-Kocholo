        "text": "TALLAHASSEE - Dalvin Cook helped send Florida State’s seniors out on a high note in their final home game.\n\nCook rushed for 106 yards and two touchdowns, and the 16th-ranked Seminoles beat Chattanooga 52-13 on Saturday.\n\nCook needed just 15 carries to record his seventh 100-yard game of the season. The sophomore, who set the school’s single-season rushing record in last week’s win over North Carolina State, broke the single-season, all-purpose yardage mark held by Greg Allen since 1981 (1,605 yards).\n\nFlorida State (9-2) earned its 21st straight win at Doak Campbell Stadium, and the seniors ran their home record to 27-1 during their four years. It also was the 48th victory for the seniors, tying them with last year’s class for the most in school history.\n\nNext up for the Seminoles is their annual showdown with Florida.\n\nAfter going three-and-out on its opening possession, Florida State scored on its next eight drives. Sean Maguire was 12 of 17 for 152 yards and two touchdowns in two-plus quarters, and J.J. Cosentino and Everett Golson also led scoring drives.\n\nCook had a 13-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, and a 2-yard TD in the third. He has 1,682 yards (1,475 rushing, 207 receiving) in 10 games this season, to go along with 16 rushing touchdowns, tied with Amp Lee for the second-most in school history.\n\nKermit Whitfield had five receptions for 91 yards and two touchdowns while Jacques Patrick ran for 77 yards and two scores.\n\nChattanooga (8-3), which has clinched a spot in the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs, took a 3-0 lead on Henrique Ribeiro’s 29-yard field goal after the Mocs recovered a Whitfield fumble on the opening kickoff. Jacob Huesman (115 all-purpose yards) and Derrick Craine (36 yards rushing) each went over the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the season.\n\nAfter the Mocs closed to 7-6 on another Ribeiro field goal, the Seminoles scored 38 straight points and outgained Chattanooga 332-29. The Mocs pulled most of their starters midway through the third quarter after a pair of turnovers. Coming into the game, Mocs coach Russ Huesman said that he wanted his team to compete but was going to mindful of playing time since the postseason start next week.\n\nFlorida State goes into next Saturday’s matchup at No. 8 Florida with an outside chance of making a New Year’s Six bowl game. The Seminoles are 14th in the latest College Football Playoff rankings."
