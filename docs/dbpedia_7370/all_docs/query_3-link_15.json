        "text": "Kids struggle to decide on which pair of shoes to wear, Alford said, let alone a college to attend.\n\nAnd coaches aren't making the process any less messy. Just the opposite, in fact.\n\n\"Unfortunately, that's just a part of it,\" Auburn running backs coach Tim Horton said. \"It's not a part of recruiting that, I think, anybody likes. You like to get guys who commit to you and stick with you; it's like your bride. But everything that happens, it's just part of the process.\"\n\nAuburn, on the heels of a Southeastern Conference championship and BCS title game appearance, has benefited from the epidemic of flipping. Nearly half the players in the Tigers' 2014 class first pledged to another school.\n\nCornerbacks Stephen Roberts of Opelika (Ala.) High, No. 62 in the ESPN 300, and Kalvaraz Bessent (No. 84) of Kingsland (Ga.) Camden County jumped to Auburn from rival Alabama.\n\nOffensive tackle Casey Tucker (Chandler, Ariz./Hamilton), rated No. 39 overall, flipped from USC to Stanford. Guard Viane Talamaivao (Corona, Calif./Centennial), No. 96, jumped to the Trojans from Alabama, even before the Crimson Tide hired ex-USC coach Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian left Washington to take over in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Sarkisian move, which prompted coach Chris Petersen to leap from Boise State to Washington, set off shock waves that impacted recruiting at all three programs.\n\nIt was the same at Texas and Penn State after coaching moves. The Longhorns lost five commitments for the 2014 class and two for 2015 after the departure of coach Mack Brown.\n\nDefensive tackle Zaycoven Henderson of Longview (Texas) High, once committed to TCU, joined the Texas class in December before flipping to Texas A&M a month later.\n\nWide receiver Saeed Blacknall, the nation's No. 118 prospect from Manalapan (N.J.) High, flipped from Rutgers to Penn State, but the Nittany Lions lost defensive tackle Thomas Holley (Brooklyn, N.Y./Lincoln), No. 51, to Florida.\n\nDefensive end Lawrence Marshall of Southfield (Mich.) High, ranked 121st, flipped from Ohio State to Michigan. Offensive tackle Andy Bauer (St. Louis/De Smet Jesuit), No. 99, flipped from Missouri to Ole Miss and back to Missouri.\n\nGuard Ross Pierschbacher of Cedar Falls (Iowa) High, No. 64, flipped from Iowa to Alabama. Cornerback Jalen Tabor, No. 11 out of Washington, D.C., Friendship Academy, jumped from Arizona to Florida.\n\nReceiver Markell Pack of Purvis (Miss.) High, No. 90, flipped from Florida State to Ole Miss.\n\nThe list goes on.\n\n\"It's gotten so bad that it's almost not even worth taking commitments in the spring,\" Utah safeties coach and recruiting coordinator Morgan Scalley said.\n\nReally, though, few programs would turn down a pledge from a prospect like Cook, who said he got caught up in the emotion of recruiting.\n\n\"The recruiting process can take over people,\" Cook said. \"[Clemson and Florida] were schools that I really liked and grew up watching.\"\n\nAs recruiting continues to accelerate into the freshman and sophomore years, prospects often reach decisions without an understanding of their opportunities.\n\n\"We just keep recruiting until the first Wednesday in February every year,\" UCLA defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator Angus McClure said. \"That's all you can do.\"\n\nMost recruiting experts anticipate a typical signing day; despite the widespread flipping, don't look for more surprises than the usual few on Wednesday. But if you're looking for a candidate to flip at the last minute, watch cornerback J.C. Jackson of Immokalee (Fla.) High, ranked No. 79 and pledged to Florida, or Ohio State-committed offensive tackle Jamarco Jones of Chicago De La Salle, rated 74th.\n\nFor all the flipping, it could be much more rampant. Many top recruits continue to take pride in staying solid. Of the nation's top 10 prospects, none have switched allegiances. And only No. 9 Adoree' Jackson, a cornerback from Gardena (Calif.) Junipero Serra, remains undecided.\n\n\"Personally, I wouldn't make a decision until I knew it was final,\" said defensive tackle Andrew Brown of Chesapeake (Va.) Oscar Frommel Smith, ranked No. 5 overall and enrolled at Virginia. \"If you flip, that means you probably don't respect one program as much as you should.\n\n\"But I understand. After all, this is your life. It's your decision.\""
