        "text": "Vikings running back's younger brother is expected to be picked in the second or third round of the NFL draft. And he's hoping to keep his No. 4.\n\nBy Mark Craig\n\nApril 24, 2022 at 9:20PM\n\nGeorgia running back James Cook, younger brother of Dalvin Cook, is expected to be picked during the second day of the NFL draft. (Lynne Sladky, Associated Press/Star Tribune)\n\nJames Cook Sr. lived for moments like the one that's all set to unfold during this week's NFL draft.\n\n\"It's going to be a big party, lots of family and friends, definitely,\" said Betty Cook, aka Miss Betty, who is James Sr.'s mom and grandmother to Vikings running back Dalvin Cook and Georgia's soon-to-be-drafted running back James Cook Jr.\n\n\"I told Dalvin the other day, 'You know your dad is in heaven smiling down on us right now, don't you? He'll be with us.' Two of my grandsons in the NFL. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.\"\n\nThe family has rented a hall near the homestead in Miami for Friday night, when James Jr. is expected to be selected in either the second or third round. James Sr., who died in December 2020 from complications with diabetes at 46, had been looking forward to this night, just like 2017, when the Vikings selected Dalvin in the second round.\n\n\"All my friends are saying, 'You know the Dolphins are taking James, right?' \" Miss Betty said. \"They say, 'Get ready. You never been a Dolphins fan, but James is coming.' I said, 'Well, I was never a Minnesota Vikings fan, but I am now.' \"\n\nThe first thing Miss Betty will do when James Jr. is drafted? Check to see if that team plays the Vikings this season.\n\n\"I'm going to get one of those jerseys that are half Minnesota Vikings and half whichever team James ends up with,\" she said. \"It'll be the number four, too.\"\n\nMiss Betty laughed at that last part. She had just been trying to explain her family tree's obsession with No. 4.\n\n\"Mentally, I'm better in that number,\" Dalvin said. \"It's better for my family and for everybody [in Minnesota]. They're going to see a version of me they've never seen before. You're going to see something special.\"\n\nThe first No. 4 in the family\n\nNaturally, James Jr. wore No. 4 at Georgia, where he helped the Bulldogs to the national title last season while sharing the backfield with fellow hot draft prospect Zamir White. A 5-11, 190-pounder, James runs a 4.42 40-yard dash, averaged 6.5 yards per carry over 46 games and is a gifted receiver out of the backfield and split out wide.\n\n\"James and Dalvin are similar players,\" said their older brother, Deandre Burnett, who took their mother Varondria's maiden name. \"Great jump cut, great hands, nightmare matchups.\"\n\nDeandre, 28, stopped playing football at 16 to focus on a basketball career that took him to the University of Miami and University of Mississippi and then overseas. He played in the British Basketball League and the Ukrainian Basketball SuperLeague before joining the police academy in Coral Springs near Miami in February.\n\nDeandre also is the reason Dalvin started playing football. And the reason he started wearing No 4.\n\n(Carlos Gonzalez, Star Tribune/Star Tribune)\n\nMark Craig\n\nReporter\n\nMark Craig has covered the NFL nearly every year since Brett Favre was a rookie back in 1991.
