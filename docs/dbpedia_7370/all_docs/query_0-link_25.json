        "text": "In 2014, Dalvin Cook took the college football world by surprise. The then, true freshmen emerged as one of the best backs in the country after making his way up from third on the Florida State depth chart.\n\nBy the time the 2014 season was all said and done, Cook totaled 1,008 yards and eight rushing touchdowns on 170 carries, averaging a robust 5.9 yards per carry.\n\nCook was not only the Seminole's leading rusher by over 300 yards, but he also became the first freshmen in FSU history to surpass the 1,000-yard mark.\n\nCook and his team of lawyers went to court early Monday morning to complete a trial on a charge of battery. The seven-member jury only needed twenty minutes to decide on their verdict, as Cook was found not guilty on the charge.\n\nAlmost immediately after the verdict, Florida State released a statement regarding Cook's status with the team.\n\n\"In light of today's ruling in his misdemeanor battery case, FSU football player Dalvin Cook's indefinite suspension from the team has been lifted, and he will be eligible to practice and to compete representing the university effective immediately,\" the school statement said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cook was spotted fully participating in practice.\n\n\"He's in good shape, looked well-conditioned,\" Fisher said following Tuesday's practice. \"He was able to train on his own (while suspended) with our practice script.\"\n\n\"Everyone was excited to see him out there again,\" defensive end DeMarcus Walker added. \"That man has some wheels on him, we had to tell him to slow down today.\"\n\nWhat does his return mean for FSU less than two weeks away from their first game?\n\nFirst and foremost, the Seminoles get their best offensive player back on the team. Cook showed in 2014 that he is one of the college game's elite backs and was being counted on as a leader for the 2015 offense.\n\n\"He's a leader, works hard, and takes the time to speak with the younger guys,\" Fisher said. \"He also plays well on the field and from that standpoint, I think the players look to him.\"\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if Cook gets the nod to start over Mario Pender for the first game or two of the season, especially considering how much time Cook missed. Pender, Johnathan Vickers, and Jacques Patrick each received plenty of reps in Cook's absence, which should bode well for FSU this season. Fisher has been raving over Pender, especially this fall, and has plans to give both plenty of carries during the season with the starting unit.\n\n\"Pender feels like he's the number one (mentally) and we will use both with the ones,\" Fisher said.\n\nInevitably, Cook will move back into the starting role and should continue right where he left off last season. The two-headed attack with Cook and Pender in the backfield is likely the best tandem in the ACC, perhaps one of the best in the country.\n\nEither way, the addition of Cook back to the team adds offensive fireworks to a squad that could see its season expectations rise as a result of having one of its best players back."
