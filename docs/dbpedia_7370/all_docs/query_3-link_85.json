        "text": "Minnesota Vikings' running back Dalvin Cook has denied allegations of abuse made against him by a former girlfriend.\n\nCook is accused of causing a concussion to the woman and holding her hostage in his home last year. Cook however, has made a counter claim.\n\nHis attorney David Valentini, alleges his client was assaulted by the woman after she broke into his residence, \"repeatedly attempted to provoke\" him and has been trying to \"extort money\" from the NFL player since the incident.\n\nThe woman has identified herself as Gracelyn Trimble, a 29-year-old Sergeant 1st Class in the U.S. Army.\n\nAccording to Star Tribune, a local newspaper in Minnesota, Trimble filed a lawsuit against 26-year-old Cook for assault, battery and false imprisonment for an event that took place on November 19, 2020. She is said to be seeking monetary damages and \"accountability.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings and the NFL released statements confirming they were aware of the incident and claims but declined to comment further at this time.\n\nBefore the lawsuit was sent to Cook late on Tuesday, Trimble and her attorney Daniel Cragg, held settlement discussions with Cook and Valentini, but no agreement was reached.\n\nAccording to Trimble's account specified in the lawsuit, as obtained by the Star Tribune, she flew to Minnesota last year to break up with Cook and get her things from his Inver Grove Heights home. She entered through the garage and grabbed some mace she knew was stored there on her way in. She recounts that Cook got angry after she asked him for help gathering her things and he \"grabbed her arm, and slung her whole body over the couch, slamming her face into the coffee table and causing her lower forehead and the bridge of her nose to bust open.\"\n\nTrimble's account continues as she states that she attempted to spray mace at Cook but he overpowered her and the mace went into her own eyes. She went to shower and was allegedly assaulted again. Trimble then went into the bedroom and grabbed Cook's gun then tried to call her friend, but Cook allegedly heard her and threatened her before beating her with a broomstick.\n\nThe next morning, the lawsuit states Cook drove Trimble to the airport where she covered her injuries with a hooded sweatshirt, sunglasses and a face mask. When she sought treatment for her injuries on November 25, 2020, she told medical staff she had been in an ATV accident.\n\nPhotos included in the lawsuit allegedly show a screenshot of a conversation between the pair exchanged on a social media app. In the message, Cook wrote: \"I know what I did can't be rewind...If you wanna go to the police I'll respect that I'll take my punishment for what I did!\"\n\nCook's attorney Valentini has shared an alternative version of events, claiming his client was the victim of assault that night.\n\nIn a statement, Valentini wrote: \"We are confident a full disclosure of the facts will show Mr. Cook did nothing wrong and any injury Sgt. Trimble may have sustained that evening was the result of Sgt. Trimble's own unlawful conduct.\"\n\nValentini states Cook defended himself after Trimble entered the house without consent, punched and maced Cook, then held him hostage with a firearm. Valentini claims Trimble was knocked to the ground when Cook tried to stop an attack on one of his guests.\n\nValentini states Trimble has been attempting to extort money from Cook ever since the incident. At the time of the incident, no criminal charges were filed and the police were not notified.\n\nCook's team Minnesota Vikings released a statement saying they'd \"recently received notification from Dalvin Cook's legal representative regarding a situation that occurred between Dalvin and a female acquaintance in November 2020 and led to an ongoing dispute between the parties.\" They immediately notified the NFL, set about gathering more information and are withholding comment at this time.\n\nESPN confirmed the NFL said it was notified by the Vikings of the matter but declined further comment.\n\nIn 2020, Vikings coach Mike Zimmer named Cook a team captain and he received a five-year, $63 million contract, making him one of the NFL's highest-paid running backs.\n\nThe Vikings play the Charges on Sunday."
