        "text": "Pro Football Focus went down memory lane with a post about Dalvin Cook’s startling numbers at Florida State.\n\nOn Twitter, Cook requested PFF to dig up his college stats when he played Florida schools in the state of Florida. PFF researched his statistics against Florida State’s in-state foes and swiftly responded to his solicitation.\n\nThe numbers included his record and performance against South Florida, Miami and Florida. Cook finished his collegiate career with a 7-0 record in these games.\n\nHe had 177 carries, 1,436 total yards, and 11 total touchdowns against the 3 Florida schools. Cook forced 48 missed tackles in those games, per PFF:\n\nIn 2016, which was Cook’s final season at Florida State, he helped the Seminoles defeat all 3 teams in the same season. The Florida matchup was his final regular season game at Florida State. In that 31-13 win over Florida, he rushed for 153 yards and 1 touchdown. It was a great performance that cemented his status as one of the best running back prospects in the 2017 NFL Draft.\n\nCook ended his time at Florida State with 4,464 rushing yards and 46 rushing touchdowns. His success against the other Florida schools made him a hero in the state. Cook, who currently plays for the Minnesota Vikings, will return to Florida to play the Miami Dolphins in Week 6."
