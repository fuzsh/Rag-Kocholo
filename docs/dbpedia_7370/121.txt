TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) -- As Dalvin Cook prepares for the NFL, he wanted to say "Thank You" to Florida State University and its fans one last time.

Cook penned an emotional letter to the university and its fan base Monday, saying that attending FSU was one of the best decisions he ever made.

"I can say that coming to Tallahassee was one of the best decisions I have ever made. And being coached by Coach Graham and Coach Jimbo, and being around some of the teammates that I have been around, I feel like I have grown a lot on and off the field," Cook wrote in his letter.

Cook goes on to describe one of his favorite memories as a Seminole: Running out of the tunnel at Doak Campbell Stadium for the first time, against Citadel in 2014, later rushing for a touchdown.

He also thanks FSU coaches and support staff, including Jimbo Fisher.

"You pushed me and got my best out of me," he wrote of Fisher.

Cook ends the letter by thanking the fans.

"I hope you think of me in a positive way. I hope I left my stamp on the program. And I hope that you remember me forever." He writes before ending his letter with "Forever a Nole, Dalvin Cook."

Cook declared for the NFL Draft after winning the Orange Bowl his Junior season late last year. In 2016, he also surpassed Warrick Dunn as the school's all time leading rusher.
