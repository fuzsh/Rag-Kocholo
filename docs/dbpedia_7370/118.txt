Dalvin Cook- 5â€™11 206lbs., RB (JR.)-Florida State University

Dalvin Cook followed up an impressive Sophomore year with an all-time campaign for a Seminole running back. Shattering the single-season record with 1,691 yards (7.4 ypc) and 19 TDs. Additionally he was 4th on the team in receptions with 24 catches for 244 yards and 1 TD. Cook shined brightest against the top competition on the Seminole schedule. Rushing for 222 yards against Miami (FL), 163 yards against Louisville, 194 yards at National runner-up Clemson and 183 yards at SEC East champion Florida. Missing one full-game and parts of others dealing with a hamstring injury, Cook still churned out a school record season. Cook is expected to be ready for fall camp after offseason shoulder surgery. Overall; Dalvin Cook shows game-breaking speed, elite vision, soft hands and a willingness to put his head down in pass protection. This projects him as a 3-down running back in the NFL with All-Pro potential.
