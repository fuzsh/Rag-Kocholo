        "text": "Ricardo Bofill, the Catalan architect, who has died from complications of Covid-19 aged 82, seldom did anything on a small scale; his fantastical, breathtakingly gigantic buildings and utopian urban development projects could be relied upon to divide architectural and public opinion.\n\nBofill rose to fame in the 1970s and 1980s as a pioneer of postmodernism, an architectural style involving flamboyant combinations of loud facades and irreverent pastiches of earlier architectural styles – classicism in Bofill’s case.\n\nThough he was born in Barcelona, the city of Antoni Gaudi, Bofill’s Left-wing views caused him problems in Francoist Spain. Instead he established his reputation in France with a series of huge precast concrete housing schemes on the outskirts of Paris in, inter alia, Noisy-le-Grand.\n\nThere, his monumental apartment complex Les Espaces d’Abraxas, designed in 1978 and completed in 1982, became famous – or notorious – due to its use as background in such dystopian movies as Brazil and The Hunger Games. But as an experiment in urban housing it proved a failure. Few people, it seemed, wanted to live in the dark shadows of its oversize fluted columns and concrete pediments reminiscent of Albert Speer’s designs for Germania.\n\nYet at their best, Bofill’s designs could be thrilling. His early work in Spain, inspired by villages he had visited on travels in north Africa, included Xanadu (1968), a stunning complex of 17 apartments in Calpe near Alicante, consisting of a vertical core staircase surrounded by clusters of articulated cubes. Described as “a garden city in space” it complemented its rocky site overlooking the Mediterranean.\n\nEven more spectacular was the nearby citadel-style La Muralla Roja (1968-1973), a housing project inspired by the architecture of North African casbahs, its 50 apartments rising from the rocky landscape below amid a riot of luminescent coloured walls and exterior features made up of M C Escher-style winding, interlocking staircases, platforms and bridges.\n\nBofill was once quoted as saying that in the case of les grands projets, it was dangerous to let the popular will decide: “In these cases, the elite decides and the people follow.” He once declared his enthusiasm to work in England on condition that he could design an entire town and replace the National Gallery with a completely new building. Not surprisingly his offer was never taken up.\n\nBut after he moved from concrete to glass and steel in the mid-1980s and later dropped the faux classicism altogether, Bofill’s work lost most of the bombastic touches that marred some of his earlier buildings.\n\nOne of his biggest projects, beginning in the early 1990s, was the redevelopment of Barcelona–El Prat Airport, including the modernisation and expansion of a pre-existing terminal and the construction of two further terminals, along with jetways for direct access to the aircraft.\n\nThe huge international terminal in particular, on which Bofill’s British partner Peter Hodgkinson played the leading role, opened in 2009 and was widely acclaimed. Shaped like a sword and featuring huge airy spaces under curvilinear glass and steel, it suggested a new maturity in Bofill’s work, with only the massive columns punching the ceilings giving a hint of his roots. His idea, he said, was “to make the people bigger than the planes” – a far cry from his earlier approach.\n\nRicardo Bofill was born in Barcelona on December 5 1939, just after the end of the Spanish Civil War. His father Emilio was an architect, builder and developer. His mother Maria, née Levi, was an Italian of Jewish descent who became a prominent sponsor of Catalan literature and culture in postwar Barcelona.\n\nRicardo was educated at Barcelona’s Catholic Escuela Andersen then at the Lycée Français de Barcelone. In 1957 he enrolled at the Barcelona School of Architecture, where he joined the outlawed Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia, and was soon expelled from the university and from Spain.\n\nMoving to Switzerland, he studied at the Haute École d’art et de design in Geneva, returning in 1960 to Spain, where he established his multi-disciplinary practice Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura in 1963.\n\nAs well as his projects in Calpe, one of Bofill’s most impressive achievements was his conversion of a disused cement factory, set in the hills outside Barcelona and consisting of more than 30 silos, subterranean galleries and huge machine rooms, into an airy home and practice headquarters, amid gardens overflowing with eucalyptus, palms, olive trees and cypresses.\n\nDue to the tense political situation in Spain in the 1970s, Bofill set up a second studio in Paris, where he was soon busily employed on grandiose social housing projects in the suburbs of French towns and cities .\n\nHis projects included the huge new Antigone district of Montpellier in southern France that between 1979 and 2000 extended the city to the River Lez. An impressive exercise in post-modern axial planning, it featured Greco-Roman-style triumphal arches, grand agoras and oversized pediments, pilasters and cornices, the whole effect striking one architectural writer as “grubbily Stalinist”.\n\nBack in Spain, Bofill’s Walden 7 (1975), near Barcelona, a dramatic 14-storey cluster of apartments grouped around five courtyards, on which Peter Hodgkinson also played a leading role, made the cover of Architectural Design magazine but suffered prolonged teething problems as vast nets had to be installed to catch the red ceramic tiles which originally covered its facade and which had a habit of falling off. A refurbishment in the 1990s replaced most of the tiles with red paint.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s, though still using an ersatz classical style, Bofill moved from using concrete to glass and steel, as seen in National Theatre of Catalonia in Barcelona.\n\nAfter the turn of the century, Bofill moved on from classicism, his later buildings including the all-glass sail-like “W” hotel (2009), perched on the furthest reach of Barcelona’s harbour and built on land reclaimed from the sea.\n\nAn admiring article in Building Design in 1995 described Bofill as a member of the “elite group [of international architects] whose personalities and activities lift them beyond the realms of normal professional practice into something approaching cult status.”\n\nBy the end of his life futuristic creations like Walden 7 and La Muralla Roja had indeed acquired cult status among a new generation of admirers, not least because they are rumoured to have inspired the design of video and computer games featuring fantastical architecture.\n\nBofill had two sons, one with the Italian actress Serena Vergano and the other with the French artist Annabelle d’Huart. From the 1980s he lived in Barcelona with the Catalan designer Marta de Vilallonga.\n\nRicardo Bofill, born December 5 1939, died January 14 2022"
