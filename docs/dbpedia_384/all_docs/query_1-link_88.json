        "text": "Ricardo Bofill\n\nBarcelona's Post-Modern Starchitect\n\nBorn in Barcelona in 1939, Ricardo Bofill Levi is the city's best known late 20th/21st-century architect. He grew up in a liberal well-to-do household; his father was a developer and like many Catalans, an ardent anti-Franco-ist.\n\nBofill attended the Barcelona School of Architecture but after joining a student protest against the regime, was expelled from the university, but continued his education a architectural school in Geneva. In 1963 he returned to Barcelona and joined his father's firm, and with a group of friends (architects, engineers, planners, sociologist, writers, musicians, movie makers and philosophers) founded an architectural and urban design firm Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura."
