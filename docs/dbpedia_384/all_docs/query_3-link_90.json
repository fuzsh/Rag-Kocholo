        "text": "In January 2022, the world of architecture lost one of its greatest influences of modern times, the Catalan architect Ricardo Bofill. However, just two months before his departure, Bofill left us with a new vision: an independent villa inspired by a classical temple that sits on a single plot within the Palmares Ocean Living & Golf complex. Today, a new opportunity presents itself to bring one of his final designs to life.\n\nThe Palmares Ocean Living & Golf complex, from Kronos Homes, is located in the Algarve, the southernmost region of Portugal. With plots for sale either with or without an architectural project, the resort is owned and operated by Kronos Homes and its Clubhouse won a National Real Estate Award last year in the Tourism category. There is now an opportunity for a buyer to purchase their own Ricardo Bofill designed villa.\n\nRelated article: RCR Arquitectes design a new luxury residential complex in Portugal\n\nBorn in Barcelona, Ricardo Bofill was one of Europe's most representative postmodern architects. Known for the bold colours and vibrant geometry that he exploded in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he was able to leave behind the modernism of earlier years. His work encompassed different disciplines such as poetry, mathematics, literature and economics, which he combined with his architectural designs. Some of these include Kafka Castle and Walden 7 in Catalonia, the Red Wall in Alicante, Ax Majeur in Paris and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco.\n\n\"The villa sits in the undulating coastal landscape with its bold form and materials. There is an undisguised intention to make it visible from a distance, a presence that evokes a classical temple with its interplay of columns\" - Ricardo Bofill Architecture Workshop\n\nCombining influences from Arab and Mediterranean design, Bofill made them fit into both his native Barcelona and the history of Arab architectural influence in Portugal. In fact, his architectural design in Palmares is a reflection of these influences since, as the studio points out, it is a design that pays homage to light and shadow.\n\n\"Internally, everything is organised around a central courtyard that divides the programme while bringing natural light into all the rooms. The courtyard, open to the ocean, focuses the whole house towards the sea view and transforms the front façade into the social area, with a swimming pool, outdoor living room, dining room and the option of a fireplace. The house is designed on a modular principle that allows it to respond to different needs without losing spatial quality and identity. The proposed grid focuses not only on the building, but also incorporates the variations of the landscape throughout the year. The addition of oscillating textiles to the columns will add a soft, contrasting layer to create shadows that move and dance with the position of the sun\" - Ricardo Bofill Architecture Workshop"
