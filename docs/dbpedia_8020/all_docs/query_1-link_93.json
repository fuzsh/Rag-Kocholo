        "text": "“Killed Holmes,” reads a complacent entry in Arthur Conan Doyle’s journal for 1893. He had written “The Final Problem,” the story in which Sherlock Holmes takes a fatal plunge while grappling with the villainous Professor Moriarty, and was pleased to have freed himself  and his readers  to concentrate on his weightier, more serious work. That was the idea, anyway.\n\nIn one of the sweeter ironies of modern fiction, the character who’d been marked for death would come to overshadow not just his creator’s other work but the creator himself. Holmes seemed so real, so magnificently lifelike, that some readers thought he really existed, and even now a few like to say that Conan Doyle was merely the literary agent for Dr. Watson, who actually wrote the tales. In the topsy-turvy afterlife of reputation and esteem, Holmes is the one doing the killing.\n\nWith the catalog of Sherlockiana growing by the year (lately, he’s starred in novels by Michael Chabon and Caleb Carr, to say nothing of television and the movies), Conan Doyle now gets his best chance yet to wrest some attention from his spotlight-hogging creation. Mining an enormous trove of the author’s freshly released letters, diaries, unpublished manuscripts and more, two new books depict his life in thorough and unprecedented detail. If Conan Doyle was right, and there are good reasons for caring about him that owe nothing to any moody, brilliant, resolutely unkillable superdetectives, we’re likely to find them here.\n\nThe title of Andrew Lycett’s biography announces that, unlike some of his predecessors, he won’t build a case for Conan Doyle’s significance by diverting our gaze from the fun at 221B Baker Street. In “The Man Who Created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,” Lycett, a former foreign correspondent (and biographer of Rudyard Kipling and Ian Fleming) gives a scrupulous, authoritative account of how an undistinguished doctor from Portsmouth climbed to the pinnacle of late-Victorian literary fame.\n\nBorn to an Irish family in Scotland in 1859, Conan Doyle derived what Lycett calls his “fantasist” streak from his mother, who had a genius for telling stories, and from a childhood devouring Poe’s mysteries, Verne’s sci-fi adventures and Sir Walter Scott’s historical romances  all genres he later explored. His reverence for fact and logic was rooted in his medical training at Edinburgh, where the most colorful bunch of professors this side of Hogwarts exposed him to their powers of deduction, zeal for forensics and enthusiasm for cocaine.\n\nBut “the central paradox of Arthur’s life,” as Lycett puts it, is that this trained doctor and inventor of the superrational Sherlock Holmes somehow fell completely in thrall to spiritualism. Séances, spirit photos and other weird phenomena that Holmes (and many of the rest of us) would dismiss as mumbo jumbo proved an endless fascination. Lycett’s elegant explanation is that, strange as it sounds, Conan Doyle regarded spiritualism as “a natural extension of science.” This insight sets up a curious twinning effect. Both Conan Doyle and Holmes, in their ways, personified the Victorian ethos that sent forth reason to make sense of a confusing and newly godless world, in the process allowing some old Romantic coloring to seep back in.\n\nThis intersection with the zeitgeist makes Conan Doyle significant and interesting. Yet not long after a popular outcry and pots of American money led to Holmes’s resurrection, a sense of anticlimax besets Lycett’s story. The knighted and prosperous Conan Doyle wrote a few more valuable books, including the still-exciting dino-adventure, “The Lost World,” and performed some good deeds  as when he used his Sherlockian sleuthing skills to exonerate a half-Indian man who’d been unjustly imprisoned (the incident that inspired Julian Barnes’s novel “Arthur and George”). But to the extent that this account of Conan Doyle’s later years holds much appeal, it lies in watching him gradually exhaust his biographer’s sympathy.\n\nOne letter Lycett cites provides the strongest reason yet to suspect that Conan Doyle was sleeping with the woman who would become his second wife, even as tuberculosis was killing his first one. Other letters document his stingy, high-handed treatment of his children. Lycett doesn’t stint on the details of Conan Doyle’s growing political and cultural conservatism, his puffy gentleman’s vanity (which frequently smacks of Gilbert and Sullivan) or his reinvention as the globe-trotting St. Paul of spiritualism, which left him “in danger of becoming a bore.” Well before his death in 1930 that danger seemed amply realized.\n\nThe impression left by Lycett’s biography  that many of Conan Doyle’s exploits, like most of his non-Sherlockian efforts, deserve the obscurity into which they have fallen  is only confirmed by the other book extracted from the new archival material. Jon Lellenberg (the American agent of the Conan Doyle estate), Daniel Stashower (author of a 1999 biography, “Teller of Tales: The Life of Arthur Conan Doyle”) and Charles Foley (Conan Doyle’s great-nephew and the estate’s present executor) have assembled a 706-page volume of correspondence, “Arthur Conan Doyle: A Life in Letters.” Marketing concerns presumably steered them away from a fitter if less salable title  like, say, “A Massive Document Dump for the Conan Doyle Completist.”\n\n“Conan Doyle lived a life as gripping as any of his own adventure tales,” the editors write in their introduction. If that was the case  and based on Lycett’s dogged research, I have my doubts  they’ve picked a funny way of showing it. Some of the letters are compelling, especially Conan Doyle’s vivid account of working at a field hospital in the Boer War. But the book is hobbled by the fact that an overwhelming majority of his letters are addressed to his mother, forcing the editors to rely on extensive patching to make the narrative cohere. Worse, these missives tend to be either cloying (“the Mam” had long apron strings) or boring, touching bottom when he devotes an entire 148-word paragraph to the stained-glass windows in his new house.\n\nThe sheer imposing weight of the book and the editors’ indulgence of their subject make you think that here, at last, is Conan Doyle as Conan Doyle would want to be seen: a man of many parts whose diverse and lofty interests (including two campaigns for Parliament) merely happened to extend, now and then, to the odd detective yarn. The approach backfires. After endless pages of financial updates, cricket scores and assorted effusions to Mam, you begin to feel that a wiser man would have spent less time complaining about the shadow cast by Sherlock Holmes and more time feverishly thanking the literary gods for its existence. For in its absence, who would notice, let alone publish, humdrum notes like these? Conan Doyle might have been annoyed to hear it, but “The Hound of the Baskervilles” or “A Scandal in Bohemia” and all those other deathless stories are the finest tribute their author is likely to get, or deserve."
