        "text": "Arthur Conan Doyle wrote 62 stories of Sherlock Holmes published between 1887 and 1927.\n\nThe 62 stories includes 4 novels and 58 short stories. Within the short stories, 56 were serialized in UK / US magazines and collected in the volumes known as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (x12), The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (x12), The Return of Sherlock Holmes (x13), His Last Bow (x7) and The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (x12), and two short stories were published for special occasions : The Field Bazaar (1896) and How Watson Learned the Trick (1924).\n\nAll other stories written by other writers, even those written by Arthur Conan Doyle's son, Adrian, are pastiches and cannot be used when studying Sherlock Holmes.
