Holmes’ deductive genius, modeled on Doyle’s medical school mentor Dr. Joseph Bell, remains to this day the standard against which all Great Detectives are judged. /Content /EditorialReview EditorialReview Source Amazon. com Review /Source Content Arthur Conan Doyle’s Study in Scarlet is the first published story involving the legendary Sherlock Holmes, arguably the world’s best known detective, and the first narrative by Holmes’s Boswell, the unassuming Dr. Watson, a military surgeon lately returned from the Afghan War. Watson needs a flat mate and a diversion. Holmes needs a foil. And thus a great literary collaboration begins.\n\nWatson and Holmes move to a now famous address, 221B Baker Street, where Watson is introduced to Holmes’s eccentricities as well as his uncanny ability to deduce information about his fellow beings. Somewhat shaken by Holmes’s egotism, Watson is nonetheless dazzled by his seemingly magical ability to provide detailed information about a man glimpsed once under the streetlamp across the road.\n\nThen murder. Facing a deserted house, a twisted corpse with no wounds, a mysterious phrase drawn in blood on the wall, and the buffoons of Scotland Yard Lestrade and Gregson Holmes measures, observes, picks up a pinch of this and a pinch of that, and generally baffles his faithful Watson. Later, Holmes explains: ‘In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward…\n\n. There are few people who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result.’ Holmes is in that elite group.\n\nConan Doyle quickly learned that it was Holmes’s deductions that were of most interest to his readers. The lengthy flashback, while a convention of popular fiction, simply distracted from readers’ real focus. It is when Holmes and Watson gather before the coal fire and Holmes sums up the deductions that led him to the successful apprehension of the criminal that we are most captivated. Subsequent Holmes stories The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, and The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes rightly plunge the twosome directly into the middle of a baffling crime, piling mystery upon mystery until Holmes’s denouement once more leaves the dazzled Watson murmuring, ‘You are wonderful, Holmes!’ Generations of readers agree.

ORG Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long, white, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back his left shirt cuff. For some little time his eyes rested thought fully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet lined arm chair with a long sigh of satisfaction. Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but custom had not reconciled my mind to it. On the contrary, from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest. Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty. His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\n‘The Hound of the Baskervilles is a crime novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, originally serialized in the Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902 and mainly set on Dartmoor in Devon in England’s West Country. At the time of researching the novel, Conan Doyle was a General Practitioner in Plymouth, and thus was able to explore the moor and accurately capture its mood and feel. Conan Doyle’s former school, Stonyhurst College is thought to have provided the inspiration for the description of Baskerville Hall. In the novel, the detective Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson are called to investigate a curse which is alleged to hang over the house of the Baskervilles.’ Quote from wikipedia. org\n\nAbout the Author\n\n‘Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, DL 22 May 1859 7 July 1930 was a British author most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes, which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of crime fiction, and for the adventures of Professor Challenger.

He is most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes, which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of crime fiction, and for the adventures of Professor Challenger. He was a prolific writer whose other works include science fiction stories, historical novels, plays and romances, poetry, and non fiction. His first significant work was A Study in Scarlet, which appeared in Beeton’s Christmas Annual for 1887 and featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes, who was partially modelled after his former university professor, Joseph Bell. Other works include The Firm of Girdlestone 1890, The Captain of the Polestar 1890, The Doings of Raffles Haw 1892, Beyond the City 1892, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes 1892, The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard 1896, The Great Boer War 1900, The Green Flag 1900, The Hound of the Baskervilles 1902, and The Lost World 1912.\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\n\nSherlock Holmes is a fictional character of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who first appeared in publication in 1887. He is the creation of Scottish author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A brilliant London based ‘consulting detective’, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and is renowned for his skilful use of astute observation, deductive reasoning and forensic skills to solve difficult cases. Conan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty six short stories that feature Holmes. The first story, A Study in Scarlet, appeared in Beeton’s Christmas Annual in 1887 and Lippincott’s Monthly Magazine in 1890, respectively. The character grew tremendously in popularity with the beginning of the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine in 1891; further series of short stories and two serialised novels appeared until 1927. The stories cover a period from around 1875 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. All but four stories are narrated by Holmes’ friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson, two are narrated by Holmes himself and two others are written in the third person. In two stories ‘The Musgrave Ritual’ and ‘The Adventure of the Gloria Scott’, Holmes tells Watson the main story from his memories, whereas Watson becomes the narrator of the frame story. Conan Doyle said that the character of Holmes was inspired by Dr. Joseph Bell, for whom Doyle had worked as a clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Like Holmes, Bell was noted for drawing large conclusions from the smallest observations. wikipedia\n\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\n\n‘I am afraid, Watson, that I shall have to go,’ said Holmes, as we sat down together to our breakfast one morning. ‘Go! Where to?’ ‘To Dartmoor; to King’s Pyland.’ I was not surprised. Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed upon this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our news agent, only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favorite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama it was only what I had both expected and hoped for. This volumes includes ‘Silver Blaze,’ ‘The Yellow Face,’ ‘The Stock Broker’s Clerk,’ ‘The ‘Gloria Scott’,’ ‘The Musgrave Ritual,’ ‘The Reigate Puzzle,’ ‘The Crooked Man,’ ‘The Resident Patient,’ ‘The Greek Interpreter,’ ‘The Naval Treaty,’ and ‘The Final Problem.’\n\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes\n\nPurchase one of 1st World Library’s Classic Books and help support our free internet library of downloadable eBooks. Visit us online at www. 1stWorldLibrary. ORG IT was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances. The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation; but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts. Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain. The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life. Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind. Let me say to that public which has shown some interest in those glimpses which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to have done so had I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month.\n\nHis Last Bow\n\nGathering together in one volume the later exploits of the saga of Sherlock Holmes, the world’s first consulting detective, His Last Bow includes tales published individually between 1908 and 1917, plus one early story, 1892’s ‘The Adventure of the Cardboard Box,’ previously considered too ‘scandalous’ for American audiences, with its themes of adultery. Here, Holmes must contend with mysterious bearded men, stolen secret submarine plans, a missing lady aristocrat, and his own near fatal illness in stories including: . ‘The Adventure of Wisteria Lodge’ . ‘The Adventure of the Cardboard Box’ . ‘The Adventure of the Red Circle’ . ‘The Adventure of the Bruce Partington Plans’ . ‘The Adventure of the Dying Detective’ . ‘The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax’ . ‘The Adventure of the Devil’s Foot’ . ‘His Last Bow‘ Scottish surgeon and political activist SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE 1859 1930 turned his passions into stories and novels, producing fiction and nonfiction works sometimes controversial The Great Boer War, 1900, sometimes fanciful The Coming of the Fairies, 1922, and sometimes legendary The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, 1892.\n\nThe Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes\n\n‘Mr Sherlock Holmes, the well known private detective, was the victim of a murderous assault this morning which has left him in a precarious position’. Dr Watson stops dead in his tracks when he reads of the attempt on his friend’s life. The forces of nature turn against man, love breeds hatred and cowardice, mothers appear to attack their own children, and Sherlock Holmes, the one man who can redress the balance, seemingly lies at death’s door…\n\nWhen an assassination attempt is made on the great detective’s life it seems that no one can escape the death and dread which blights Britain…\n\nThe Exploits and Adventures of Brigadier Gerard\n\nHaving killed off Sherlock Holmes, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle began a new series of tales on a very different theme. Brigadier Gerard is an officer in Napoleon’s army?recklessly brave, engagingly openhearted, and unshakable, if not a little absurd, in his devotion to the enigmatic Emperor. The Brigadier’s wonderful comic adventures, long established in the affections of Conan Doyle’s admirers as second only to those of the incomparable Holmes, are sure to find new devotees among the ardent fans of such writers as Patrick O’Brian and George MacDonald Fraser.\n\nThe Adventures of Gerard\n\nPurchase one of 1st World Library’s Classic Books and help support our free internet library of downloadable eBooks. Visit us online at www. 1stWorldLibrary. ORG I hope that some readers may possibly be interested in these little tales of the Napoleonic soldiers to the extent of following them up to the springs from which they flow. The age was rich in military material, some of it the most human and the most picturesque that I have ever read. Setting aside historical works or the biograp hies of the leaders there is a mass of evidence written by the actual fighting men themselves, which describes their feelings and their experiences, stated always from the point of view of the particular branch of the service to which they belonged. The Cavalry were particularly happy in their writers of memoirs. Thus De Rocca in his ‘Memoires sur la guerre des Francais en Espagne’ has given the narrative of a Hussar, while De Naylies in his ‘Memoires sur la guerre d’Espagne’ gives the same campaigns from the point of view of the Dragoon. Then we have the ‘Souvenirs Militaires du Colonel de Gonneville,’ which treats a series of wars, including that of Spain, as seen from under the steel brimmed hair crested helmet of a Cuirassier. Pre eminent among all these works, and among all military memoirs, are the famous reminiscences of Marbot, which can be obtained in an English form. Marbot was a Chasseur, so again we obtain the Cavalry point of view. Among other books which help one to an understanding of the Napoleonic soldier I would specially recommend ‘Les Cahiers du Capitaine Coignet,’ which treat the wars from the point of view of the private of the Guards, and ‘Les Memoires du Sergeant Bourgoyne,’ who was a non commissioned officer in the same corps. The Journal of Sergeant Fricasse and the Recollections of de Fezenac and of de Segur complete the materials from which I have worked in my endeavour to give a true historical and military atmosphere to an imaginary figure.\n\nThe Lost World\n\nBoys are mysterious creatures, with rich imaginations and inner lives at which most can only guess. Luckily, a few writers have the talent to capture their fantasies of extraordinary adventure and epic bravery. Inspired by the success of The Dangerous Book For Boys, the six titles of the Penguin Great Books For Boys collection celebrate the adventurer within every boy with tales of shipwreck, murder, espionage, and survival. With a striking series look that is nostalgic and, at the same time, completely modern, these Great Books For Boys are sure to appeal to boys young and old. Unlucky in love, but desperate to prove himself in an adventure, journalist Ed Malone is sent to interview the infamous and hot tempered Professor Challenger about his bizarre South American expedition findings especially his sketches of a strange plateau and the monstrous creatures that appear to live there. But rather than being angry at his questions, Challenger invites him along on his next field trip. Malone is delighted; until it becomes clear that the Professor was telling the truth about the terrible lost world he discovered. Will they all survive the terrifying creatures on the island? And will anyone ever believe what they saw there?\n\nThe Poison Belt\n\nBeing an account of another adventure of Prof. George E. Challenger, Lord John Roxton, Prof. Summerlee, and Mr. E. D. Malone, the discoverers of The Lost World.’…\n\nbobtail of insignificant satellites, we float under the same daily conditions towards some unknown end, some squalid catastrophe which will overwhelm us at the ultimate confines of space, where we are swept over an etheric Niagara or dashed upon some unthinkable Labrador. I see no room here for the shallow and ignorant optimism of your correspondent, Mr. James Wilson MacPhail, but many reasons why we should watch with a very close and interested attention every indication of change in those cosmic surroundings upon which our own ultimate fate may depend.”Man, he’d have made a grand meenister,’ said McArdle. ‘It just booms like an organ. Let’s get doun to what it is that’s troubling him.’The general blurring and shifting of Fraunhofer’s lines of the spectrum point, in my opinion, to a widespread cosmic change of a subtle and singular character. Light from a planet is the reflected light of the sun. Light from a star is a self produced light.

Visit us online at www. 1stWorldLibrary. ORG If you please, mum, said the voice of a domestic from somewhere round the angle of the door, ‘number three is moving in. Two little old ladies, who were sitting at either side of a table, sprang to their feet with eja*culations of interest, and rushed to the window of the sitting room. ‘Take care, Monica dear,’ said one, shrouding herself in the lace curtain; ‘don’t let them see us. ‘No, no, Bertha. We must not give them reason to say that their neighbors are inquisitive. But I think that we are safe if we stand like this.’ The open window looked out upon a sloping lawn, well trimmed and pleasant, with fuzzy rosebushes and a star shaped bed of sweet william. It was bounded by a low wooden fence, which screened it off from a broad, modern, new metaled road. At the other side of this road were three large detached deep bodied villas with peaky eaves and small wooden balconies, each standing in its own little square of grass and of flowers. All three were equally new, but numbers one and two were curtained and sedate, with a human, sociable look to them; while number three, with yawning door and unkempt garden, had apparently only just received its furniture and made itself ready for its occupants. A four wheeler had driven up to the gate, and it was at this that the old ladies, peeping out bird like from behind their curtains, directed an eager and questioning gaze.\n\nThe Parasite\n\nReadHowYouWant publishes a wide variety of best selling books in Large and Super Large fonts in partnership with leading publishers.

CHAPTER I. Friar’s oak. On this, the first of January of the year 1851, the nineteenth century has reached its midway term, and many of us who shared its youth have already warnings which tell us that it has outworn us. We put our grizzled heads together, we older ones, and we talk of tho great days that we have known; but we find that when it is with our children that we talk it is a hard matter to make them understand. We and our fathers before us lived much the same life, but they with their railway trains and their steamboats belong to a different age. It is true that we can put history books into their hands, and they can read from them of our weary struggle of two and twenty years with that great and evil man. They can learn how Freedom fled from the whole broad continent, and how Nelson’s blood was shed, and Pitt’s noble heart was broken in striving that she should not pass us for everTable of Contents CONTENTS; chapter page; I Friar’s Oak 1; 11 The Walker of Cliffe Royal 18; III The Play actress of Anstly Cross 33; IV The Peace of Amiens ? 50; V Bcck Tregellis 65; VI On the Threshold 80; VII The Hope of England 98; VIII The Brighton Road 121; IX Watier’s 136; X The Men of the Ring 153; XI The Fight in the Coach house 179; XII The Coffee room of Fladong’s 201; XIII Lord Nelson ? ? ? 221; XIV On the Road 234; XV Foul Play 253; XVI Cbawley Downs 261; XVII The Ring side 277; XVIII The Smith’s Last Battle 294; XIX Cliffe Royal 314; XX Lord Avon 326; XXI The Valet’s Story 340; XXII The End ? 355; LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS; page; Down we thundered together Fionthpiece; I saw him look hard at his antagonist 1G; ‘I find him very passable, Mary ‘ 73; ‘Lost like the deuce,” he snapped 150; The old prize fighter’s story 171; Jim appeared in the ring 187; They shouted and stamped and raved in their delight 219; Sir Lothian Hume was smiling and nodding his head 302Abou\n\nUncle Bernac\n\nI DARESAY that I had already read my uncle’s\n\nletter a hundred times, and I am sure that I knew\n\nit by heart.

In these days of universal press agencies, responsive to the slightest stimulus, it may well seem incredible that an international incident of such importance should remain so long unchronicled. Suffice it that there were very valid reasons, both of a personal and of a political nature, for holding it back. The facts were well known to a good number of people at the time, and some version of them did actually appear in a provincial paper, but was generally discredited. They have now been thrown into narrative form, the incidents having been collated from the sworn statements of Colonel Cochrane Cochrane, of the Army and Navy Club, and from the letters of Miss Adams, of Boston, Mass. The Korosko was turtle bottomed, round bowed stern wheeler, with a 30 in. draught and the lines of a flat iron, started upon the 13th of February in the year 1895, from Shellal, at the head of the first cataract, bound for Wady Halfa. The little Korosko puffed and spluttered her way up the river, kicking up the white water behind her, and making more noise and fuss over her five knots an hour than an Atlantic liner on a record voyage. The passengers of the Korosko formed a merry party, for most of them had traveled up together from Cairo to Assouan, and even Anglo Saxon ice thaws rapidly upon the Nile. They were fortunate in being without the single disagreeable person who, in these small boats, is sufficient to mar the enjoyment of the whole party. On a vessel that is little more than a large steam launch, the bore, the cynic, or the grumbler holds the company at his mercy. But the Korosko was free from anything of the kind. The pleasure trip was drawing to its climax.\n\nA Duet, with an Occasional Chorus\n\nSir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, DL 1859 1930 was a Scottish author. He is most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes, which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of crime fiction, and for the adventures of Professor Challenger.

Events have been transposed to the evident of some few months in this narrative in order to preserve the continuity and evenness of the story. I hope so small a divergence may seem a venial error after so many centuries. For the rest, it is as accurate as a good deal of research and hard work could make it. The matter of diction is always a question of taste and discretion in a historical reproduction. In the year 1350 the upper clas*ses still spoke Norman-French, though they were just beginning to condescend to English. The lower clas*ses spoke the English of the original Piers Plowman text, which would be considerably more obscure than their superiors’ French if the two were now reproduced or imitated. The most which the chronicles can do is to catch the cadence and style of their talk,\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCONTENTS; PAGE; I THE HOUSE OF LORING 3; II How THE DEVIL CAME TO WAVERLEY 8; III THE YELLOW HORSE OF CROOKSBURY ? 14; IV How THE SUMMONER CAME TO THE MANORHOUSE; OF TILFORD 29; V How NIGEL WAS TRIED BY THE ABBOT OF; VI; VII; VIII; WAVERLEY; IN WHICH LADY ERMVNTRUDE OPENS THE IRON; COFFER; How NIGEL WENT MARKETING TO GUILFORD ?; How THE KING HAWKED ON CROOKSBURY; HEATH 8z; IX How NIGEL HELD THE BRIDGE AT TILFORD 93; X How THE KING GREETED HIS SENESCHAL OF; CALAIS ? 102; XI IN THE HALL OF THE KNIGHT OF DUPLIN ? 113; XII How NIGEL FOUGHT THE TWISTED MAN OF; SHALFORD ? ? 125; XIII Ho~v THE COMRADES JOURNEYED DOWN THE; OLD, OLD ROAD ? ? 139 XIV How NIGEL CHASED THE RED FERRET ? 159; XV How THE RED FERRET CAME ‘1’0 COSFORD ? 180; XVI How THE KING’S COURT FEASTED IN CALAIS; CASTLE ? ? 190; XVII THE SPANIARDS ON THE SEA ? 200; XVIII How BLACK SIMON CLAIMED FORFEIT FROM; ; ? 220; XIX How A SQUIRE OF ENGLAND MET A SQUIRE; OF FRANCE 230; XX How THE ENGLISH A\n\nThe Maracot Deep\n\n1929.

The one which stretches away to the north of us, and to which our ice anchor is attached, cannot be smaller than an English county. To the right and left unbroken sheets extend to the horizon. This morning the mate reported that there were signs of pack ice to the southward. Should this form of sufficient thickness to bar our return, we shall be in a position of danger, as the food, I hear, is already running somewhat short. It is late in the season, and the nights are beginning to reappear. This morning I saw a star twinkling just over the fore yard, the first since the beginning of May. There is considerable discontent among the crew, many of whom are anxious to get back home to be in time for the herring season, when labour always commands a high price upon the Scotch coast. As yet their displea sure is only signified by sullen countenances and black looks, but I heard from the second mate this afternoon that they contemplated sending a deputation to the Captain to explain their grievance. I much doubt how he will receive it, as he is a man of fierce temper, and very sensitive about anything approaching to an infringement of his rights. I shall venture after dinner to say a few words to him upon the subject. I have always found that he will tolerate from me what he would resent from any other member of the crew. Amsterdam Island, at the north west corner of Spitzbe rgen, is visible upon our starboard quarter a rugged line of volcanic rocks, intersected by white seams, which represent glaciers. It is curious to think that at the present moment there is probably no human being nearer to us than the Danish settlements in the south of Greenland a good nine hundred miles as the crow flies. A captain takes a great responsibility upon him self when he risks his vessel under such circumstances. No whaler has ever remained in these latitudes till so advanced a period of the year.\n\nMy Friend The Murderer And Other Mysteries And Adventures\n\nReadHowYouWant publishes a wide variety of best selling books in Large and Super Large fonts in partnership with leading publishers.

Visit us online at www. 1stWorldLibrary. ORG I quite recognise the force of your objection that an invalid or a woman in weak health would get no good from stories which attempt to treat some features of medical life with a certain amount of realism. If you deal with this life at all, however, and if you are anxious to make your doctors something more than marionettes, it is quite essential that you should paint the darker side, since it is that which is principally presented to the surgeon or physician. He sees many beautiful things, it is true, fortitude and heroism, love and self sacrifice; but they are all called forth as our nobler qualities are always called forth by bitter sorrow and trial. One cannot write of medical life and be merry over it. Then why write of it, you may ask? If a subject is painful why treat it at all? I answer that it is the province of fiction to treat painful things as well as cheerful ones. The story which wiles away a weary hour fulfils an obviously good purpose, but not more so, I hold, than that which helps to emphasise the graver side of life. A tale which may startle the reader out of his usual grooves of thought, and shocks him into seriousness, plays the part of the alterative and tonic in medicine, bitter to the taste but bracing in the result. There are a few stories in this little collection which might have such an effect, and I have so far shared in your feeling that I have reserved them from serial publication. In book form the reader can see that they are medical stories, and can, if he or she be so minded, avoid them.\n\nRound the Fire Stories\n\n‘The reader who takes up the book may make sure of having quite enough thrills to last him for some time’. The Spector, October 17, 1908\n\n‘Again and again the sly and highly intellectual humor of the author is in evidence, even in his quite seriously conceived tales’. The News York Times, November 21, 1908\n\nOriginally published in 1908 and out of print for more than half a century, this collection of stories, complete with a Preface by the author, presents Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at his finest. These are seventeen tales of suspense and adventure, of the mysterious and fantastic, mean to be read ’round the fire’ upon a winter’s night. Murder, madness, ghosts, unsolved crimes, diabolical traps, and inexplicable disappearances abound in these exciting accounts narrated by doctors, lawyers, gentlemen, teachers, burglars, dilettantes, and convicted criminals. The titles are inviting ‘The Pot of Caviare’, ‘The Clubfooted Grocer’, ‘The Brazilian Cat’, ‘The Sealed Room’, and ‘The Fiend of the Cooperage’ and the stories are riveting.

The North African coast, with its broad hem of golden sand, its green belt of feathery palm trees, and its background of barren, red scarped hills, shimmered like a dream country in the opal light. Save for a narrow edge of snow white surf, the Mediterranean lay blue and serene as far as the eye could reach, In all its vast expanse there was no break but for a single galley, which was slowly making its way from the direction of Sicily and heading for the distant harbour of Carthage. Seen from afar it was a stately and beautiful vessel, deep red in colour, double banked with scarlet oars, its broad, flapping sail stained with Tyrian purple, its bulwarks gleaming with brass work. A brazen, three pronged ram projected in front, and a high golden figure of Baal, the God of tho Phoenicians, children of Canaan, shone upon the afteTable of Contents CONTENTS; I; TAG ; I The Last Galley 3; II The Contest 15; IIT Through the Veil 26; IV An Iconoclast 34; V Giant Maxjmin 45; VL The Coming or the Huns 68; VIL The Last of the Legions 84; VIII The First Cargo 94; IX The Home coming 105; X The Red Star 124; II; I The Silver Mirror 139; II The Blighting of Sharkey 154; III The Marriage of the Brigadier 173; IV The Lord of Falconbridge 187 V Out of the Running 223; VI, ‘De Profundis0 245; VIL The Great Brown Pericord Motor 260; VIII The Terror of Blue John Gap 273About the Publisher Forgotten Books is a publisher of historical writings, such as: Philosophy, Classics, Science, Religion, History, Folklore and Mythology.

This little known volume is a tour of Doyle’s bookcase. He talks about the authors and their books he cherishes and their affect on his life. Doyle opens with the following. ‘I care not how humble your bookshelf may be, nor how lowly the room which it adorns. Close the door of that room behind you, shut off with it all the cares of the outer world, plunge back into the soothing company of the great dead, and then you are through the magic portal into that fair land whither worry and vexation can follow you no more. You have left all that is vulgar and all that is sordid behind you. There stand your noble, silent comrades, waiting in their ranks. Pass your eye down their files. Choose your man. And then you have but to hold up your hand to him and away you go together into dreamland. Surely there would be something eerie about a line of books were it not that familiarity has deadened our sense of it. Each is a mummified soul embalmed in cere cloth and natron of leather and printer’s ink. Each cover of a true book enfolds the concentrated essence of a man. The personalities of the writers have faded into the thinnest shadows, as their bodies into impalpable dust, yet here are their very spirits at your command.’\n\nThe British Campaign in France and Flanders 1915\n\nCONTENTS The Opening Months of 1915 Neuve Chapelle and Hill 60 The Second Battle of Ypres Stage I.

This was after the death of his son Raymond during World War I. While researching the topic of fairies, some photographs from a working class family in rural Yorkshire were brought to Doyle’s attention by a Theosophist friend. These photographs appeared to show diminutive fairies cavorting in the presence of humans, specifically two teenage girls, Elsie and Frances. They had taken the photographs by themselves, and there were no overt signs that the negatives had been tampered with. Doyle championed the photographs, and in the process destroyed his reputation; which is probably why this book, out of all of the Doyle corpus, has not been put into etext until now. The Coming of the Fairies was possibly a bigger disappointment for Doyle fans than when he killed off Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThese photographs, which caused a sensation at the time, are easily recognizable as blatant fakes by modern eyes, sensitized to seeing much more photorealistic computer generated elves and fairies. The fairies are statically posed, and are neatly coiffed and dressed in period clothing, hardly what one would expect from wild nature elementals. They are just too flat looking and high contrast to be anything other than cardboard cutouts positioned in the scene, and could be constructed by adolescent girls with artistic leanings. And indeed, many years later the pair did admit that they had faked the photos.\n\nHowever, even a skeptic will have to admit that just because these photos are fake, it does not logically imply there are no such beings. Just because some UFO photos are fake, doesn’t mean that there are no UFOs! But ‘extraordinary claims demand extraordinary proof’. While we may not have extraordinary proof of fairies, there is more to the phenomena than meets the eye. Enough data that some explanation must be attempted. Doyle barely scratches the surface of the massive literature on fairies here; for a comprehensive survey, for instance, refer to Evan Wentz’ The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries. The real reason that this charming little book is of interest today is historical, and of course, because of the author. ‘ Quote from sacred texts. com\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nPublisher’s Preface; Preface; How The Matter Arose; The First Published Account ‘strand’ Christmas Number, 1920; Reception Of The First Photographs; The Second Series; Observations Of A Clairvoyant In The Cottingley Glen, August 1921; Independent Evidence For Fairies; Some Subsequent Cases; The Theosophic view Of Fairies\n\nAbout the Publisher:\n\nForgotten Books is a publisher of historical writings, such as: Philosophy, Classics, Science, Religion, Esoteric and Mythology. www. forgottenbooks. org\n\nForgotten Books is about sharing information, not about making money.

It has brought the entire planet closer together and changed almost every aspect of how we live today. Along the way, the airplane has inspired writers in every decade of the twentieth century to celebrate this world changing creation. From the wild first years of aviation when daredevil men challenged each other to set altitude records to the terrible three dimensional landscape of combat in the air through all the wars of this century, authors from around the world have written of the airplanes and the men and women who fly them. Now, bestselling author Stephen Coonts has collected some of the finest fiction about flying in one volume. On Glorious Wings contains stories and excerpts from world renowned authors, including Dale Brown, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Louis L’Amour, James Michener, Joseph Heller, Len Deighton, Frederick Forsyth, William Faulkner, Ralph Peters and Stephen Coonts himself. From the rickety wire and wood contraptions of the 1920s to the possible future of warfare in 2020, this collection invites you to take to the skies with some of today’s most acclaimed authors, including:’Five Weeks in a Balloon’ by Jules Verne: Take a fanciful trip through the air as imagined by one of the great authors of the nineteenth century.’All of the Dead Pilots’ by William Faulkner: One of America’s greatest storytellers looks at Britain in World War II, where a brash American pilot and an unflappable British officer clash over the same woman.’Wings over Khabarovsk’ by Louis L’Amour: The great Western writer also penned many tales for the pulp magazines of the 1930s and ’40s, including this classic of the genre about an American pilot framed for spying on the far side of the world.’An Hour to San Francisco,’ from The High and the Mighty, by Ernest K.
