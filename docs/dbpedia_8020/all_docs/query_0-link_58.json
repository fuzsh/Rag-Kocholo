        "text": "I'm going to answer by taking issue with the question itself. I think we can demonstrate that while Conan-Doyle might not be truly considered \"first-rate\", his work is taken seriously by academics and literati and is taught and studied in the English-speaking world.\n\nLet's begin by trying to define \"first-rate\" here. There is no hard and fast definition of the English canon, but I haven't found a listing of canonical authors which includes Conan-Doyle. However, given the volume of literature produced in English, inclusion in the canon is an extremely high bar and is generally reserved for authors whose work was exceptionally innovative and influential. As worthy as you may feel Conan-Doyle's work is, I'm sure you can see that he doesn't really belong in that truly exalted club.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of academics who study and teach well-respected authors who are not on the canon list. The poet Wilfred Owen is an excellent example: his work is studied by almost every schoolchild in the UK and remains revered. It's also taught at university in greater detail, but it's stressed that, while highly emotive and well-written, the content is relatively simple and straightforward. It's difficult to mine for deeper and more complex meanings. That doesn't make it, in any way, bad. Only a less rewarding object for study.\n\nThis is the camp that Conan-Doyle falls into as an author who was technically highly accomplished, but whose work does not tend to reward repeat readings with additional insight. And he is studied and taught at a similar level to Owen. There is at least one academic in the UK, Dr Christopher Pittard at the University of Portsmouth, who lectures and publishes on his work:\n\nMy first book, Purity and Contamination in Late Victorian Detective Fiction (2011; reissued in paperback by Routledge 2016), arose out of an AHRC funded project at the University of Exeter and considers how detective fiction published in 1890s periodicals engaged with ideas of material and social purity, ranging from Sherlock Holmes cleaning the face of criminality in “The Man with the Twisted Lip” to the moral policing carried out by the Social Purity movements and late Victorian antivivisection campaigns.\n\nLiterary critic Harold Bloom, whose work has, arguably, done more than any other to establish and define the literary canon did not include Conan-Doyle in his list of canonical works but still saw fit to include him in a collection that he edited, Classic Mystery Writers (ISBN: 9780791022108). Canonical or not, to have met Bloom's standards for inclusion is passing a very serious test of quality.\n\nFinally, Conan-Doyle is quite commonly taught at high-school level. The Sign of the Four is part of the current GCSE (the secondary school level exam of the UK) syllabus module Shakespeare and the 19th-century novel. Previous set texts for GCSE have also included The Study in Scarlet.\n\nIn short, then, Conan-Doyle is not seen as a truly \"first-rate\" author, nor as canonical, but in the wider view this seems entirely fair. He is, however, absolutely celebrated, studied and taught as the talented and brilliant second-tier writer that he clearly is."
