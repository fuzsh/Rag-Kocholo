        "text": "“Elementary,” said he. “It is one of those instances where the reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little point which is the basis of the deduction.\n\nThese are the very words that for me are the foundation of all great mystery stories – and for me they start with Sherlock Holmes. I have read Wilkie Collins’ The Moonstone and Edgar Allan Poe’s Murders in the Rue Morgue (which Arthur Conan Doyle actually mentions in Holmes’ first outing A Study in Scarlet!), but neither managed to capture my imagination and admiration as much as the Sherlock Holmes stories.\n\nIt is only just, therefore, that I dedicate a reading project to the famous consulting detective and his faithful friend Dr. Watson.\n\nAnd what could be better than starting this project off with a buddy read with my friend over at KnightofAngels.com, a true Sherlockian and awesome blogger and apparently she has completely forgotten about my exasperating rants that accompanied our James Bond buddy read. (Shhh!)\n\nSeriously, tho, I am honoured and excited to embark on this new reading adventure that will see us re-examine another shared favourite: Holmes, the man, the mystery, the myth.\n\nFor this little project, I will be listening to Stephen Fry’s narration of The Definitive Audio Collection and read The Complete Sherlock Holmes: with an introduction from Robert Ryan (Simon & Schuster UK. Kindle Edition.)\n\nSo, here we go …\n\nA Study in Scarlet (1887) – 3* – Review\n\nThe Sign of Four (1890) – 3* – Review\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892):\n\nA Scandal in Bohemia – 5* – Review\n\nThe Red-Headed League – 4* – Review\n\nA Case of Identity – 3* – Review\n\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery – 2* – No review. I have nothing to say about this one.\n\nThe Five Orange Pips – 4* – Review\n\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip – 3*\n\nThe Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle – 5*\n\nThe Adventure of the Speckled Band – 5* – Review\n\nThe Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb – 4* – Review\n\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor – 3* – Review\n\nThe Adventure of the Beryl Coronet – 2* – Review\n\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches – 3.5* – Review\n\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1893):\n\nThe Adventure of Silver Blaze – 2.5* – Review\n\nThe Adventure of the Cardboard Box\n\nThe Adventure of the Yellow Face\n\nThe Adventure of the Stockbroker’s Clerk – 3.5* – Review\n\nThe Adventure of the Gloria Scott\n\nThe Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual – 4* – Review\n\nThe Adventure of the Reigate Squire\n\nThe Adventure of the Crooked Man\n\nThe Adventure of the Resident Patient\n\nThe Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\n\nThe Adventure of the Naval Treaty\n\nThe Adventure of the Final Problem – 5* – Review\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–02) – Review\n\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes (1903-04)\n\nThe Adventure of the Empty House\n\nThe Adventure of the Norwood Builder\n\nThe Adventure of the Dancing Men\n\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\n\nThe Adventure of the Priory School\n\nThe Adventure of Black Peter\n\nThe Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\n\nThe Adventure of the Six Napoleons\n\nThe Adventure of the Three Students\n\nThe Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\n\nThe Adventure of the Missing Three-Quarter\n\nThe Adventure of the Abbey Grange\n\nThe Adventure of the Second Stain\n\nHis Last Bow (1908-17)\n\nThe Adventure of Wisteria Lodge\n\nThe Adventure of the Red Circle\n\nThe Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans\n\nThe Adventure of the Dying Detective\n\nThe Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax\n\nThe Adventure of the Devil’s Foot\n\nHis Last Bow\n\nThe Valley of Fear (1914–15)\n\nThe Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes (1921-27)\n\nThe Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\n\nThe Problem of Thor Bridge\n\nThe Adventure of the Creeping Man\n\nThe Adventure of the Sussex Vampire\n\nThe Adventure of the Three Garridebs\n\nThe Adventure of the Illustrious Client\n\nThe Adventure of the Three Gables\n\nThe Adventure of the Blanched Soldier\n\nThe Adventure of the Lion’s Mane\n\nThe Adventure of the Retired Colourman\n\nThe Adventure of the Veiled Lodger\n\nThe Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place\n\nObviously, I am neither a historian nor a true Sherlockian, so anything I have written in connection with this reading project is purely based on my own impressions from ACD’s stories. This is not meant to be an exhaustive source of information on all things Holmes (there are actual societies dedicated to that – google them!), this is just a fan’s reading journal."
