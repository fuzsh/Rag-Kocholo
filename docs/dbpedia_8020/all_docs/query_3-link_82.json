One reason is that mankind derives endless fascination from the detective genre, perhaps because the present state of our existence centers on a kind of criminal event that occurred bygone ages ago in a garden called Eden. Since that fateful fruit selection, man’s life is inextricably bound up with sorting out the precise details and implications\n\nof this or that deception or crime.\" -From Marcus Schwager's guide\n\nLook Inside the Guide\n\nThe Worldview Guides from the Canon Classics Literature Series provide an aesthetic and thematic Christian perspective on the most definitive and daunting works of Western Literature. Each Worldview Guide presents the big picture (both the good and the bad) without neglecting the details. Each Worldview Guide is a friendly literary coach—and a treasure map, and a compass, and a key—to help teachers, parents, and students appreciate, critique, and begin to master the classics.\n\nThe bite-size WGs are divided into these ten sections (with some variation due to genre): Introduction, The World Around, About the Author, What Other Notables Said, Setting, Characters, & Argument, Worldview Analysis, Quotables, 21 Significant Questions & Answers, and Further Discussion & Review.\n\nA free classics test and answer key are also available here.\n\nWhat People Are Saying about the Worldview Guides:\n\n\"The content is excellent\" -Cathy Duffy, Homeschool Reviewer\n\n\"this book is nice enough I'll probably get the paper copy of the next canon classic worldview guide I get.\" -student"
