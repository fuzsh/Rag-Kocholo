Find out more here.\n\nFree UK courier delivery for orders over £25!\n\nThis collection includes all volumes of Sherlock Holmes mystery, murder and detective tales by Arthur Conan Doyle:\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes – Illustrated by David Mackintosh\n\nThis classic collection of Holmes tales includes many of the detective’s most-loved exploits: Holmes is confronted by a venomous snake in ‘The Adventure of the Speckled Band’, mystified by a missing thumb in ‘The Adventure of the Engineer’s Thumb’ and beguiled by a beautiful opera singer in ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’, never once losing his famous cool.\n\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes – Illustrated by David Mackintosh\n\nWith Sherlock Holmes’s reputation as the scourge of the criminal underworld preceding him, the ingenious detective, with the aid of Dr Watson, is confronted in these stories by some of his most fiendishly difficult cases yet.\n\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes\n\nThree years have passed since Holmes and the evil mastermind Professor Moriarty fell, locked in combat, into the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland, and when Doctor Watson collides with an odd-looking old book collector in the street, little does he know that the world’s greatest detective is about to return…\n\nHis Last Bow\n\nPublished a quarter of a century after the first book of Holmes adventures, and including the famous titular story His Last Bow: An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes, this collection shows the detective’s powers of deduction at their most dazzling, proving that Conan Doyle’s ability to entertain and surprise remains undiminished.\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles – Illustrated by David Mackintosh\n\nThe most famous novel in Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes cycle, The Hound of the Baskervilles is a masterpiece of terror, suspense and mystery which has enthralled readers young and old since it was first published in 1902.\n\nThe Sign of the Four\n\nFirst published in 1880, The Sign of the Four – the second Sherlock Holmes novel after A Study in Scarlet, published three years earlier – will sweep the readers away into a story of murders, betrayals, double-crossings and stolen treasures, and is an enduring testament to the storytelling genius of Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nA Study in Scarlet\n\nFirst published in 1887, when the author was only twenty-seven years old and still working as a medical practitioner in Portsmouth, this novel introduced to the reading public what would become the most famous pair of sleuths in the world – as well as a number of other iconic characters, such as Lestrade and the “Baker Street Irregulars” – and changed, in the process, the course of crime and detective fiction for ever.\n\nThe Valley of Fear\n\nThe fourth and final novel in the Sherlock Holmes canon, originally published in the Strand magazine between September 1914 and May 1915, The Valley of Fear is a riveting whodunit that showcases all of the classic elements that have ensured the enduring popularity of the stories featuring Conan Doyle’s most famous creation.\n\nThe Casebook of Sherlock Holmes\n\nThe final collection of Holmes adventures, containing twelve brilliant, unpredictable stories, The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes is a fitting conclusion to its protagonist’s long career and a powerful send-off for Conan Doyle’s greatest creation."
