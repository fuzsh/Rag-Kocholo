        "text": "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, best known for creating the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, was a multi-faceted personality -- a doctor, a writer, journalist, and public figure. He was born as Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle on May 22, in the year 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\nDid you know that the birthday of Sherlock's sidekick, Dr Watson, in whose voice Doyle writes the mystery tales, actually coincides with that of the author?\n\nadvertisement\n\nListed below are some lesser-known facts about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle:\n\n1. Doyle played cricket: He was on the same cricket team as Peter Pan writer JM Barrie.\n\n2. Debut of Sherlock Holmes: Sherlock Holmes made his first appearance in 'A Study of Scarlet', published in Beeton's Christmas Annual in 1887.\n\n3. Killing and resurrection of Holmes: In 1893, Conan Doyle killed off Holmes, hoping to concentrate on more serious writing. A public outcry later made him resurrect Holmes.\n\n4. Doyle helped in popularising skiing: In 1823, Doyle moved to Davros, Switzerland where he helped to popularise the winter sport. Doyle was also the first Englishman to document the thrill of skiing: \"You let yourself go,\" he said.\n\n\"Getting as near to flying as any earthbound man can. In that glorious air it is a delightful experience.\" Doyle correctly predicted that in the future hundreds of Englishmen would come to Switzerland for the 'skiing season.'\n\n5. Doyle played as goalkeeper: Under the pseudonym AC Smith, the writer played as a goalie for amateur side Portsmouth Association Football Club.\n\n6. He ran for Parliament, twice: Doyle ran for parliament (representing the Unionist Party) once in Edinburgh (in 1900) and once in the Border Burghs (in 1906). Although he received a respectable vote both the times, he was not elected.\n\n7. He coined the caption 'Licensed to Kill': When Arthur Conan Doyle obtained his Bachelor of Medicine and Master of Surgery degree, he drew a funny sketch of himself receiving his diploma, with the caption 'Licensed to Kill'. It became the tagline for another sleuth, James Bond.\n\n8. Doyle not only wrote mysteries, he actually solved a few: One such example was the case of George Edalji, who, thanks to Doyle's efforts, was exonerated for charges of sending threatening letters and mutilating animals.\n\n9. He died clutching a flower: Doyle died on Monday, July 7, 1930, in his garden, clutching a flower. His last words were addressed to his wife. He whispered, \"You are wonderful.\"\n\n10. Doyle believed in fairies: When a photograph surfaced purportedly showing a young girl surrounded by fairies, Doyle enthusiastically hailed its authenticity and believed it was clear evidence of psychic phenomena. He even wrote a book called The Coming of the Fairies.\n\n11. He started an ophthalmology practice in London: But not a single patient ever crossed his door, which made Doyle resort to writing for killing time.\n\n12. He was friends with famous illusionist Harry Houdini: However, their friendship soured when Conan Doyle and his wife called him for a seance. There, they claimed to have contacted Houdini's mother from beyond the grave. As proof of her communication, they showed her a letter which was written in English, a language which Houdini's mother didn't speak! Houdini was outraged and publicly denounced the author and his wife.\n\n13. Knighted by King Edward: In the year 1902, King Edward VII Knighted Doyle, not for his famous fiction stories on Sherlock Holmes, but for his book that justified Britain's involvement in the Boer War.\n\n14. He popularised 'dinosaurs': Can you imagine Jurassic Park without dinosaurs? At the time Doyle wrote The Lost World, the term dinosaur hadn't even been around for two centuries.\n\nRead | Sherlock Holmes' birthday mystery solved!\n\nInterested in General Knowledge and Current Affairs?
