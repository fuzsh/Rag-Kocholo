        "text": "When I started thinking of writing this post, I didn’t even suspect that there might be different ways of reading Sherlock Holmes stories. Naturally, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was rather prolific, in spite of his developed frustration with the character that brought him fame, but it never occured to me that somebody could read the stores not in the publicated order - because it was the way I read them as a child.\n\nI don’t remember how I was introduced to Sherlock Holmes stories. They seem, just like The Three Musketeers (although with that book I do remember the first time I read it), to always have been in my life. I think that it might have been my grandfather who introduced me to Sherlock Holmes. Or perhaps, I watched the tv show first. I honestly can not recall.\n\nHowever, I do remember always reading the stories by starting with A Study in Scarlet.\n\nHere is the list of all stories in chronological order by the publication date (taken from Baker Street Wiki):\n\n1887: A Study in Scarlet\n\n1890: The Sign of the Four\n\nJuly 1891 to December 1892: Stories that would make up The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes published in The Strand magazine\n\nDecember 1892 to November 1893: Stories that would make up The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes published in The Strand\n\n1901-2 (serial): The Hound of the Baskervilles\n\nOctober 1903 to January 1905: Stories that would make up The Return of Sherlock Holmes published in The Strand\n\n1908–1913, 1917: Stories that would make up His Last Bow (short stories) published.\n\n1914-15: The Valley of Fear\n\n1921–1927: Stories that would become The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes published.\n\nAfter looking into some forums and discussions and thinking about it, I was surprised to see that many people suggest skipping A Study in Scarlet, as it is the first story written by Doyle and therefore not as polished and a bit too long, and just dive into The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and then The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.\n\nWell, personally, I would not skip A Study in Scarlet, no matter how boring it is, as it introduces the main characters to us and just like the first episode of many Sherlock Holmes adaptations - you don’t want to miss that.\n\nSo, in honour of January being a Sherlock Holmes reading month and the read-a-long #SHReads18, I decided to introduce you to my favourite reading order of all Sherlock Holmes stories. I am participating in this January event, however, I have a bigger goal in mind. One of my reading challenges for 2018 is to re-read all of Sherlock Holmes stories and for that I am listening to them as audiobooks - the complete collection of stories read by Stephen Fry (one of my most favourite narrators)! The complete collection is an exclusive production by Audible and was released last year.\n\nAs I am writing this, I have already listened to A Study in Scarlet and started on The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Follow me on GoodReads, if you want to follow me on my epic re-read :)\n\nThere is no right or wrong way to read the stories - besides Doyle himself sometimes messed up facts and dates. However, The Final Problem and The Empty House have to be read together as they are tied in plot. Save The Hound of the Baskervilles for the last, as it is pretty good.\n\nHere is my reading order, in which I will be doing this:\n\nI. A Study in Scarlet (novel, 1887)\n\nII. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\n\nThe Red-headed League, 1891\n\nA Case of Identity, 1891\n\nThe Boscombe Valley Mystery, 1891\n\nThe Five Orange Pips, 1891\n\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip, 1891\n\nThe Blue Carbuncle, 1892\n\nThe Speckled Band, 1892\n\nThe Engineer's Thumb, 1892\n\nThe Noble Bachelor, 1892\n\nThe Beryl Coronet, 1892\n\nThe Copper Beeches, 1892\n\nA Scandal in Bohemia, 1891 (I plan to read this story the last in the book)\n\nIII. The Sign of the Four (novel, 1890)\n\nIV. The Valley of Fear (novel, 1914-15)\n\n(or read this novel between the stories from The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, but before The Final Problem)\n\nV. The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\n\nSilver Blaze, 1892\n\nThe Yellow Face, 1893\n\nThe Stock-broker's Clerk, 1893\n\nThe 'Gloria Scott', 1893\n\nThe Musgrave Ritual, 1893\n\nThe Reigate Squires, 1893\n\nThe Crooked Man, 1893\n\nThe Resident Patient, 1893\n\nThe Greek Interpreter, 1893\n\nThe Naval Treaty, 1893\n\nThe Final Problem, 1893\n\nVI. The Return of Sherlock Holmes\n\nThe Empty House, 1903\n\nThe Norwood Builder, 1903\n\nThe Dancing Men, 1903\n\nThe Solitary Cyclist, 1903\n\nThe Priory School, 1904\n\nBlack Peter, 1904\n\nCharles Augustus Milverton, 1904\n\nThe Six Napoleons, 1904\n\nThe Three Students, 1904\n\nThe Golden Pince-Nez, 1904\n\nThe Missing Three-Quarter, 1904\n\nThe Abbey Grange, 1904\n\nThe Second Stain, 1904\n\nVII. The Hound of the Baskervilles (novel, 1901-02)\n\nVIII. The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes\n\nThe Illustrious Client, 1924\n\nThe Blanched Soldier, 1926\n\nThe Mazarin Stone, 1921\n\nThe Three Gables, 1926\n\nThe Sussex Vampire, 1924\n\nThe Three Garridebs, 1924\n\nThor Bridge, 1922\n\nThe Creeping Man, 1923\n\nThe Lion's Mane, 1926\n\nThe Veiled Lodger, 1927\n\nShoscombe Old Place, 1927\n\nThe Retired Colourman, 1926\n\nIX. His Last Bow\n\nWisteria Lodge, 1908\n\nThe Cardboard Box, 1893\n\nThe Red Circle, 1911\n\nThe Bruce-Partington Plans, 1908\n\nThe Dying Detective, 1913\n\nLady Frances Carfax, 1911\n\nThe Devil's Foot, 1910\n\nHis Last Bow, 1917\n\nIt is not, by any means, a strict reading order. I might mix things as I go, but if you are new to Sherlock Holmes stories or haven’t had a chance to read them all - I hope you find my little guide handy.\n\nMy book reviews\n\nSources:"
