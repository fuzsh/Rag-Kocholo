        "text": "Arthur Conan Doyle Biography\n\nArthur Conan Doyle was born on May 22, 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was the eldest son of Charles Altamont Doyle and Mary Foley Doyle. His father was an artist and his mother was a homemaker. Doyle showed an early interest in storytelling and adventure, which was nurtured by his mother’s love for literature.\n\nDoyle attended the Jesuit preparatory school, Hodder Place, and later Stonyhurst College. He excelled in his studies, particularly in languages and literature. During his time at Stonyhurst, he developed a keen interest in detective stories and crime fiction.\n\nAfter completing his education, Doyle pursued a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh. He graduated in 1881 and started practicing medicine in Southsea, England. However, his medical career did not fulfill him creatively, and he turned to writing in his spare time.\n\nIn 1887, Doyle published his first detective novel, “A Study in Scarlet,” which introduced the iconic character Sherlock Holmes. The novel received mixed reviews initially but gained popularity over time. Doyle went on to write three more novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes and his loyal companion, Dr. John Watson.\n\nBesides the Sherlock Holmes series, Doyle wrote several other notable works. He explored various genres, including historical fiction, science fiction, and supernatural stories. One of his most famous historical novels is “The White Company,” which depicts the adventures of a group of medieval English mercenaries.\n\nDoyle also delved into the realm of science fiction with his novel “The Lost World,” where a group of explorers discovers a hidden plateau inhabited by prehistoric creatures. This novel laid the foundation for the popular “lost world” genre in literature and film.\n\nDoyle married Louisa Hawkins in 1885, and they had two children together. However, their marriage faced difficulties, and they eventually separated in 1907. Doyle later married Jean Leckie in 1907, with whom he had three children.\n\nArthur Conan Doyle’s contribution to literature, particularly through the creation of Sherlock Holmes, has had a lasting impact. Holmes became a cultural icon and influenced the development of detective fiction. Doyle’s works continue to be celebrated and adapted into various forms of media, including films, television series, and stage plays."
