Doyle is the creator of two of the most well-loved and widely recognized fictional characters of modern literature—the brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes and his faithful friend and assistant Dr. John Watson. For more than a century, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson have remained the defining figures of detective fiction. The visual image of Holmes, characterized by his deerstalker cap, large, curved pipe, and magnifying glass, has become an iconic symbol for the archetypal detective hero. Doyle wrote a total of four novels and fifty-six short stories featuring Holmes and Watson, originally published between 1888 and 1927. Holmes has continued to impress generations of readers with his masterful use of deductive reasoning and keen observation in order to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes. Doyle's most highly regarded Holmes stories include the novel The Hound of the Baskervilles (1902) and the stories \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band,\" \"The Red-Headed League,\" \"The Man with the Twisted Lip,\" and \"The Five Orange Pips,\" among others. In addition to his Holmes mysteries, Doyle also authored several works of historical fiction as well as adventure novels, poetry, and plays.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nDoyle was born May 22, 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland, the eldest son in an Irish Catholic family. Throughout Doyle's childhood, his father, an artist and civil servant, had difficulty supporting the family and was later institutionalized for alcoholism. Doyle received his education at the Jesuit institutions of Hodder Preparatory School and Stonyhurst College. Determined to become a doctor, he entered medical school at Edinburgh University, where he worked as the assistant to Dr. Joseph Bell, an eccentric surgeon and university professor. Doyle was impressed by Bell's uncanny powers of observation and his ability to determine the occupations of his patients based on seemingly insignificant details of their dress and mannerism, a skill which Doyle later incorporated into the character of Sherlock Holmes. In order to support himself through school, he obtained temporary work as a medical officer on an Arctic whaling ship. Upon earning his medical degree in 1881, Doyle spent several months working as a ship's doctor on a freighter voyage to Africa. After his return to England, he set up a medical practice, but struggled throughout the early 1880s to earn a living, as he failed to attract a sufficient number of patients. During this period, Doyle, who had sold his first short story to a magazine in 1879, began to supplement his income by selling several additional stories. In 1885 he married Louisa Hawkins, a wealthy woman whose income provided him with financial security for the first time in his life, allowing him to devote more of his time to writing, although he continued to practice medicine. His first Sherlock Holmes story, published in 1888, was a novel entitled A Study in Scarlet, with illustrations by Doyle's father, Charles Doyle. Though not an immediate sensation, subsequent Sherlock Holmes stories eventually earned Doyle an international readership and established Holmes as one of the most beloved fictional heroes of all time. By 1891 Doyle was able to retire from his meager medical practice and support his family as a full-time writer. Doyle had two children with his first wife, who died of tuberculosis in 1906. The following year, he married his longtime friend Jean Leckie, with whom he had three children. Extending his fictional detective work into real life, Doyle's reputation for crime-solving earned him the status of unofficial consultant to the English police, and Sherlock Holmes stories became required reading for English police detectives in training. Though he is now remembered primarily for his detective stories, Doyle was a prolific writer who also published numerous novels in a variety of genres, as well as a number of plays, books of poetry, spiritual treatises, political pamphlets, histories, and other works of nonfiction. When the Boer War broke out, Doyle, who at forty-one was too old to enlist for combat, served as a surgeon near the South African front. He was knighted in 1902 for his historical account of the incident, The Great Boer War (1900), as well as for a pamphlet in which he defended the British action in the Boer War. In his middle-age, Doyle became increasingly interested in spiritualism, writing and publicly speaking in defense of the belief that it is possible to communicate with the dead through a gifted \"medium.\" During World War I, Doyle cleverly relayed information to British prisoners-of-war in Germany by sending them copies of books in which he made pinpricks under specific words throughout the text, in order to form a message. Doyle died of a heart attack at home in Sussex, England, on July 7, 1930.\n\nMAJOR WORKS\n\nReaders were first introduced to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in A Study in Scarlet. Doyle modeled his detective hero as a composite character derived from traits of a favorite uncle, his former teacher Dr. Bell, and the detective characters of Edgar Allen Poe, Wilkie Collins, and others. Holmes and Watson first meet each other in A Study in Scarlet when a mutual friend suggests they share lodgings to save money. At their first meeting, Holmes correctly deduces that Watson is a medical doctor who has been serving in the British wars in Afghanistan, has been wounded, and has recently returned to England. Thus begins one of the most enduring friendships in the history of literature. Watson is also introduced as the narrator of all of the Holmes stories, a meticulous chronicler of his friend's astounding genius. Commissioned by an American publisher, Doyle soon published a second Sherlock Holmes novel, The Sign of Four (1890), a detective story concerning an Indian treasure. After this minor success, Doyle conceived to create a series of short stories featuring the same central characters that, unlike the standard serialized novels of the time, could stand alone as complete narratives in themselves. \"A Scandal in Bohemia,\" the first Holmes short story to appear in a magazine, in 1891, begins when the King of Bohemia surreptitiously hires Holmes to retrieve a scandalous and incriminating photograph in the possession of a young woman with whom he has had a clandestine affair. Holmes discovers the location of the photograph through a clever series of disguises and ruses, but in the end, the young woman outsmarts Holmes and manages to flee the country with the photograph. With the astounding success of his first few Holmes short stories, Doyle became internationally famous. The first twelve Holmes short stories were collected in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1892), followed by The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (1894), which contained the next set of twelve stories.\n\nBy the early 1890s, however, Doyle had grown weary of writing Holmes mysteries, which he considered to be of lesser literary merit than his historical novels, such as Micah Clarke (1889) or The Great Shadow (1892). In \"The Final Problem,\" published in 1893, Watson describes the death of Holmes during a struggle with his arch-enemy, Professor Moriarity, in the mountains of Switzerland, in which he falls off the edge of a cliff. Though thousands of readers mourned and protested the death of their detective hero, Doyle did not write another Holmes story for nearly ten years. Then, in 1902, he published the novel The Hound of the Baskervilles, which is now regarded as one of the best of the Holmes stories. Through Dr. Watson, Doyle's narrator in The Hound of the Baskervilles, the author explains that the events in the novel took place before Holmes' death in Switzerland. Watson assists Holmes in solving the case of a series of untimely deaths of family patriarchs in the line of the Baskerville family. Located on the moors of rural England, the Baskerville family estate bears a legend that a giant beast-like dog prowls the grounds and attacks each new generation of Baskerville heirs. Holmes is called upon to solve the most recent Baskerville murder and thereby protect the newest heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, from a similar fate. The success of The Hound of the Baskervilles inspired Doyle to revive his hero, and in a subsequent story, \"The Adventure of the Empty House,\" Watson explains that Holmes had faked his own death, deceiving even Watson himself, in order to work undercover as an international detective. Having succeeded in this aim, Holmes returns to London three years after his apparent death to once again take up residence with Watson and resume his previous work. Doyle's subsequent Holmes stories, which comprise over half of the total body of Holmes fiction, were collected in The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905), His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences on Sherlock Holmes (1917), and The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes (1927). In the title story of His Last Bow, a sixty-seven-year-old Holmes manages to capture a German spy just before the outbreak of World War I. Doyle's fourth and final Holmes novel, The Valley of Fear, a \"locked-room\" murder mystery, was published in 1915. Doyle's last Holmes tale, \"The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place,\" was published in 1927, three years before the death of the author. Doyle also wrote two plays featuring Watson and Holmes—Sherlock Holmes (1899), based on the short story \"The Strange Case of Miss Faulkner,\" and The Speckled Band (1910), based on the short story of the same title.\n\nContrary to the opinions of his readers and critics, Doyle considered his seven historical novels to be among his greatest and most serious literary works. In the tradition of Sir Walter Scott's \"Ivanhoe\" novels, Doyle's historical novels concern the knightly adventures, chivalrous romances, and thrilling battles of medieval English legend. These novels, however, soon faded into obscurity and only The White Company (1891), which concerns the exploits of a band of knights in fourteenth-century England, is still read today. Like his historical novels, Doyle's several science fiction novels have for the most part fallen into obscurity. Of these, only The Lost World (1912) continues to be read today and was adapted to film in 1925 and 1992. The Lost World features Professor Challenger, a character who appears in several of Doyle's science fiction novels. In this adventure tale, Challenger leads an expedition of men to Brazil, where, on an isolated mesa, they discover a lost civilization of apemen who represent the \"missing\" link in the evolution of homo-sapiens.\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nLiterary critics and audiences alike have agreed that Doyle's creation of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson will stand as his greatest literary achievement. Indeed, to some extent, the characters themselves have transcended the stories, in the sense that, while many recognize them by name and image, many fewer have actually read Doyle's fiction. The character of Sherlock Holmes has frequently been compared to such immortal fictional heroes as Hamlet, Don Quixote, and Robinson Crusoe. By no means a brilliant stylist, Doyle has been recognized for his lucid, straightforward, and uncomplicated prose. Andrew Lang, writing in 1904, remarked of Doyle's style, \"his is a simple narrative, manner,\" and went on to state, \"In short, we read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for the story, and are very glad that we have such stories to read; rapid, varied, kindly, and honest narratives.\" Critics have praised Doyle's skill in evoking a sense of setting and atmosphere, rendering such locations as the streets of London, the moors of rural England, and the interior of the Holmes/Watson living quarters tangibly familiar to his readers. Many reviewers have noted that, in contrast to his two central characters, Doyle's minor characters tend to be lifeless, one-dimensional stock characters. He has been heavily criticized for his portrayal of women in the Holmes stories, which are based on stereotypes and are generally considered to lack depth and complexity. In the early twentieth-first century, critics began to examine Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and other fictional works within the historical and ideological context of late-Victorian British culture, particularly in regards to conceptions of empire. These critics have pointed out that Doyle's detective stories, though on the surface devoid of political content, express an underlying investment in promoting the values of British empire, which Doyle openly supported in many of his nonfiction writings. Lesli J. Favor, for example, has argued that Doyle's representations of women as well as foreigners in his stories function to subject both to the ideological strictures of the British empire. Favor has asserted that Doyle \"presents heroes and villains in ways that assert the eminence of the English over the Other-than-English and the Male over the Other-than-male.\" Discussing the powerful appeal of Doyle's fiction during his lifetime, Catherine Wynne has stated that, \"[i]n works that span the last decades of Victorianism across the Edwardian era into the years that saw the advent of modernism, Doyle tapped cultural and societal fears. His fictions and his public commitments register the preoccupations and anxieties of his time; his work engages with the rise and consequent decline of empire, ideas of racial theory, scientific progress, degeneration, the crisis of faith, and changes in gender relations.\"\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\n\"Sherlock Holmes\" Series\n\nA Study in Scarlet [illustrations by Charles Doyle] (novel) 1888\n\nThe Sign of Four (novel) 1890\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes [illustrations by Sidney Paget] (short stories) 1892\n\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes [illustrations by Sidney Paget] (short stories) 1894\n\n*Sherlock Holmes: A Drama in Four Acts (play) 1899\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles [illustrations by Sidney Paget] (novel) 1902\n\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes [illustrations by Sidney Paget] (short stories) 1905\n\n†The Speckled Band: An Adventure of Sherlock Holmes (play) 1910\n\nThe Valley of Fear: A Sherlock Holmes Novel [illustrations by Arthur I.

New York, N.Y.: G. K. Hall & Co., 1992.\n\n[In the following essay, first published in The Quarterly Review in July 1904, Lang—acclaimed folklorist and compiler of the Color Fairy books—evaluates Doyle's historical novels and Sherlock Holmes tales, commenting on the \"superficial character of [Holmes'] knowledge and methods.\"]\n\nIf this country's education were conducted on truly scientific principles, we ought to have statistics of the great Novel industry. It is not enough to know how many copies of popular novels are sold; on that point the publishers often give us ample information. From 80,000 to 150,000 copies of a novel that really reaches the heart of the English people are promptly disposed of; and, allowing only ten readers for each copy, the millions are plainly being influenced by our authors of genius. This is a grave thought for conscientious novelists; the making of the spiritual life of England is in their hands. They feel it, and are all but overborne by the too vast orb of their responsibilities. In their photographs, which accompany the reports of interviews with them, we mark with sympathy the ponderous brow, supported by the finger so deft on the type-writing machine; and, as we read the interview, we listen to the voice that has whispered so many thousands of words into the phonograph.\n\nThe popular novelists of England and of America are serious men; they occupy at least in their own opinion a position which, since the days of the great Hebrew prophets, has been held by few sons of earth. Now and again they descend, as it were, from the mountain and wearily tell the world the story of their aims, their methods, and their early struggles, before they were discovered by enterprising publishers, before their books provided the text of many a sermon, just as did Mr. Richardson's \"Pamela.\"\n\nThese men and women are our social, spiritual, religious, and political teachers. This is an important fact, for their readers take fiction seriously; their lives are being directed, their characters are being framed, by authors such as Mr. Hall Caine, Miss Marie Corelli, Mr. Anthony Hope, Mr. Rudyard Kipling, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unluckily we have, for lack of statistics, no means of knowing the nature and limits of the moulding of character and direction of life exercised by these energetic authors. Can it be possible that they sometimes neutralize each other's effects, and that the earnest reader of Mr. Wells finds the seeds of his doctrine blown away on the winds of the mighty message of Mr. Hall Caine? Does the inquirer who sets out to follow the star of Miss Marie Corelli become bewildered and \"pixyled,\" as they say in Devonshire, by the will-o'the-wisps of Mr. Kipling?\n\nThe serious writers on \"the Novel,\" in the Press, like the late Mr. Norris, author of \"The Octopus,\" assure us that all is well, that the Novel is, or ought to be, everything; that the novelist is our inspired teacher in matters theological, social, political, and perhaps (when we think of Mr. H. G. Wells) scientific; not to mention that the historical novelist writes the only sort of history which should be, and which is, read by the world. But the pity of it is that novelists, like other teachers, differ vastly in doctrine among themselves; so that, if we read all the popular authors, we \"come out,\" like Omar Khayyám, \"no wiser than we went,\" but rather perplexed in our intellects.\n\nThe owners of the stores in America which gave away a celebrated British novel as a bounty on soap, are said to have expressed themselves thus:—\n\nOur hands were never half so clean,\n\nOur customers agree;\n\nAnd our beliefs have never been\n\nSo utterly at sea.\n\nThe beliefs of the public may, of course, be brought back to dry land by some more orthodox novelist, but the whole process is unsettling. Yet it may be that the populace, in various sections, cleaves to one teacher, neglecting others. Do the devotees of Miss Marie Corelli read the discourses of Mr. Hall Caine; and do the faithful of Mrs. Ward peruse either, or both, of the other two spiritual guides? Lacking the light of statistics we can only guess that they do not; that the circles of these authors never intersect each other, but keep apart; just as a pious Mussulman does not study \"Hymns Ancient and Modern,\" while a devotee of Mr. Swinburne seldom declines upon \"The Christian Year.\" Meanwhile the mere critic fails to extract a concrete body of doctrine from the discourses of any of our teachers.\n\nConcerning Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who is, we trust, nearly as popular as any teacher, it may be said with gratitude that he aims at entertaining rather than at instructing his generation. We venture to think that the contemplative and speculative elements in his nature are subordinate to the old-fashioned notion that a novelist should tell a plain tale. A handsome and uniform edition of his works lies before us, with manly, brief, and modest prefaces by the author. The volumes are fair to see; the type and paper are good, though the printing is not incapable of correction, and the spelling is sporadically American.\n\nThere are authors whom we like best in stately \"library editions,\" others whom we prefer in first editions—of such are Keats and Charles Lamb; and, handsome as is the format of Sir Arthur's collected works, there are a few of them which please us most \"in the native pewter.\" Now the native pewter of Sherlock Holmes is a sixpenny magazine, with plenty of clever illustrations; he takes better in these conditions than in a sumptuous text with only one or two pictures. Sir Arthur is an unaffected writer. His style is not \"a separate ecstasy,\" as in the case of Mr. R. L. Stevenson's writings; his is a simple narrative manner. He does not pass hours in hunting for le mot propre; and a phrase is apparently none the worse in his eyes because it is an old favorite of the public, and familiar to the press and the platform. However, like Aucassin in the cantefable, \"we love a plain tale even better than none,\" and love anything better than the dull and tormented matter of the prigs who, having nothing that deserves to be said, say it in a style which standeth in an utterly false following of Mr. George Meredith. \"The Author's Edition\" is a delightful set for a smoking room in a club or in a country house.\n\nBy a laudable arrangement, Sir Arthur has confined his speculative and contemplative exercises to a pair of books, The Stark Munro Letters and A Duet. In the former, a young man has his \"first fight\" (not at all in the style of the author's Rodney Stone ) \"with the spiritual and material difficulties which confront him at the outset of life. There is no claim that his outlook is either profound or original.\" Indeed his outlook is not remarkable for subtlety or distinction. Sir Arthur is not a Pascal; and, if he were, his \"Pensées,\" presented in a work of fiction, would fail to exhilarate. As he says, Tom Jones and Arthur Pendennis and Richard Feverel \"do not indicate their relation to those eternal problems which are really the touchstone and centre of all character.\" Thank heaven they do not!\n\nAn eternal problem can hardly be \"the centre of a character\"; and, if it were, we do not always pine to read a novel about an eternal problem. A little of \"Obermann\" goes a long way. If a problem is eternal it has obviously never been solved; and what chance had Thomas Jones, a foundling, of solving eternal problems. As for Pen, he frankly abandoned the attempt. The narrator in the Stark Munro Letters ends his speculation by deciding that \"something might be done by throwing all one's weight on the scale of breadth, tolerance, charity, temperance, peace, and kindliness to man and beast.\" Having arrived at this acceptable solution, we do not care to follow the mental processes by which the young thinker reaches the result. We have ever been of his mature opinion, which, moreover, has the sanction of the Church, and of the best heathen and Christian philosophers.\n\nThere is no speculation and no preaching of doctrines, no nonsense about a \"message\" or a \"mission,\" in the rest of Sir Arthur's books, where the good people are plucky, kind, and honorable, while the bad people are usually foiled in their villainous machinations. The quality which recommends Sir Arthur's stories to his readers, and to ourselves, is a quality which cannot be taught or learned; which no research, or study, or industry can compass; which is born with a man; which can hold its own without the aid of an exquisite style; and which is essential. Sir Arthur can tell a story so that you read it with ease and pleasure. He does not shine as a creator of character. Perhaps Micah Clarke, an honest English Porthos, is the best of his quite serious creations; while Sherlock Holmes, not so seriously intended, has become a proverb, like Monsieur Lecoq. But Brigadier Gerard is Sir Arthur's masterpiece; we never weary of that brave, stupid, vain, chivalrous being, who hovers between General Marbot and Thackeray's Major Geoghegan, with all the merits of both, and with others of his own.\n\nThe ladies who pass through the novels play their parts, and are excellent young women in their rôles, but they are not to be very distinctly remembered, or very fondly adored. There is not a Sophia Western, an Amelia, a Diana Vernon, a Becky Sharpe, an Anne Elliot, a Beatrix Esmond, or a Barbara Grant, in their ranks; and indeed such characters are scarce in all fiction. The greatest masters but seldom succeed in creating immortal women; only Shakespeare has his quiver full of such children as these. In short, we read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for the story, and are very glad that we have such stories to read; rapid, varied, kindly, and honest narratives. As Mr. Arthur Pendennis remarked about his ancestral claret, \"there is not a headache in a hogshead\" of them.\n\nWe shall first glance at Sir Arthur's historical novels, Micah Clarke, The White Company, The Refugees, and Rodney Stone. The public is very far from sharing the opinion professed by James II in exile, that \"history is much more instructive than novels, and quite as amusing.\" For ourselves we deem his Majesty's own historical work vastly more entertaining than any novel written during his lifetime; but, in the opinion of the public, history only exists as material for historical romances, just as the engineer said that rivers exist for the purpose of feeding navigable canals.\n\nSir Arthur's earlier historical novels are influenced, more than he probably suspects, by those of Sir Walter Scott. Micah Clarke, like Mr. Blackmore's Lorna Doone, is a tale of the last romantic rebellion with a base in England—the futile attempt of Monmouth. The big Porthos-like hero is, in some ways, akin to John Ridd; but he occupies, as regards politics and religion, the juste milieu that Sir Walter favored when he wrote history, and assigned to such romantic heroes of his own as Henry Morton, and even Roland Graeme. Though \"a simple-hearted unlettered yeoman,\" Micah Clarke is really wise with the wisdom of the later Victorian time, and, in one remark, speaks as if he had read Mr. Herbert Spencer with approval, so far as the problems of religion are concerned. He takes a calm view of history, and is no fanatic of the Protestantism of his period—that of Titus Oates. \"The mob's ideas of Papistry were mixed up with thumbscrews\" (not a Catholic implement, by the way) \"and Fox's Martyrology.\" Micah is the son of a church-woman, and a Puritan, and himself has no particular bent, except in favor of freedom and fighting. \"I believe that there was good in Papistry, Church, Dissent, but that not one was worth the spilling of human blood.\" King James was the rightful King, and Monmouth, black box and all, was a bastard, to Micah's mind; but, as fighting was toward, he fought for the son of Lucy Walters.\n\nDecimus Saxon, the pedantic soldier of fortune, a most entertaining character, with his Latin and his professional skill, his indifference as to the cause for which he draws his sword, and his eye for \"caduacs and casualties,\" is an English Dalgetty, and almost as amusing as the immortal laird of Drumthwacket, \"that should be.\" He is a grandson, as it were, of Dugald's father, Sir James Turner, who was learned, but not pedantic, and a far better-hearted man than either Decimus or Dugald. Indeed Decimus \"doth somewhat lean to cutpurse of quick hand.\" A more original character is the \"Malignant\" Monmouthite, the ruined, kind, dandified, and reckless Sir Gervas Gerome, so full of fight and foppery.\n\nRather to the surprise of the reader, at a given moment, while escorting a preacher and his rustic flock of \"slashing communicants\" to join Monmouth, Decimus suddenly ceases to be Dalgetty, and becomes John Balfour, called Burley. A cornet of the King's Horse approaches the psalm-singing conventicle with a flag of truce, and we quote what follows.\n\n\"Who is the leader of this conventicle?\" he asked.\n\n\"Address your message to me, sir,\" said our leader from the top of the wagon, \"but understand that your white flag will only protect you whilst you use such words as may come from one courteous adversary to another. Say your say or retire.\"\n\n\"Courtesy and honor,\" said the officer with a sneer, \"are not for rebels who are in arms against their lawful king. If you are the leader of this rabble, I warn you if they are not dispersed within five minutes by this watch\"—he pulled out an elegant gold time-piece—\"we shall ride down upon them and cut them to pieces.\"\n\n\"The Lord can protect His own.\" Saxon answered, amid a fierce hum of approval from the crowd. \"Is this all thy message?\"\n\n\"It is all, and you will find it enough, you Presbyterian traitor,\" cried the dragoon cornet. \"Listen to me, you fools,\" he continued, standing up upon his stirrups and speaking to the peasants at the other side of the wagon. \"What chance have ye with your whittles and cheese-scrapers? Ye may yet save your skins if ye will but give up your leaders, throw down what ye are pleased to call your arms, and trust to the King's mercy.\"\n\n\"This exceeds the limits of your privileges,\" said Saxon, drawing a pistol from his belt and cocking it. \"If you say another word to draw these people from their allegiance, I fire.\"\n\n\"Hope not to help Monmouth,\" cried the young officer, disregarding the threat, and still addressing his words to the peasants. \"The whole royal army is drawing round him and—\"\n\n\"Have a care!\" shouted our leader, in a deep, harsh voice.\n\n\"His head within a month shall roll upon the scaffold.\"\n\n\"But you shall never live to see it,\" said Saxon, and stooping over he fired straight at the cornet's head. At the flash of the pistol the trumpeter wheeled round and rode for his life, while the roan horse turned and followed with its master still seated firmly in the saddle.\n\nHere we have Drumclog, and Cornet Graham, and Burley's slaying of him under a flag of truce, with his excuse for so doing, all over again; whereof the author must have been as unconscious as Sir Walter himself when he annexed a verse by the poetical valet of his friend Rose. The Shirra justly said that, like Captain Bobadil, he \"had taught many gentlemen to write almost or altogether as well as himself.\" This English Drumclog ends like the other, after a pretty fight; and the adventures reach Taunton, where the condition of that unhappy and pious town, and of Monmouth's scythemen and other rude levies, is depicted with much fire and energy. The hero, with great self-sacrifice, hands over the love-making business to a humorous friend named Reuben, and is free to devote himself to manly adventure. At this point comes the news of the failure of Argyll; and Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth and Sir John Cochrane (whom Claverhouse had prophetically damned) receive from Decimus the same critical hard measure as Macaulay gives them. \"The expedition was doomed from the first with such men at its head,\" says Decimus—with truth; for Argyll, if alone, would have been safe, though the Lowland leaders, in any case, being odious to the Remnant, could have raised no stir in Scotland.\n\nMonmouth himself appears to us to be very well designed, though he was more fair to outward view than he seemed in the eyes of Micah Clarke. Though his Stuart blood was doubted by all but Charles II, his weakness, waywardness, and loss of nerve when [the] Sedgemoor fight went against him, were quite in the vein of the Chevalier de St. George at Montrose, of Queen Mary at Langside, and of Charles Edward in the first hours after Culloden. Each one of that forlorn four had shown courage enough on other fields, but as leaders of a lost hope the terror of betrayal overmastered him. Unlike the rest, Monmouth was a sentimentalist of the most modern fashion. A worse commander could not have been found for a very bad cause.\n\nRobert Ferguson is described as almost a maniac from sheer vanity; but the unique character of the Plotter cannot be unriddled in a novel, if it can be unriddled at all. Still, we do not recognize him when he speaks to Monmouth in the wildest manner of the Remnant. \"Why was Argyll cutten off? Because he hadna due faith in the workings o' the Almighty, and must needs reject the help o' the children o' light in favor o' the bare-legged children o' Prelacy, wha are half Pagan, half Popish.\" The terms do not apply to the Campbells; and Ferguson had humor enough if Dalrymple says truly that he tided over a day's lack of supplies by inducing Monmouth to proclaim a solemn fast for the success of his arms. Probably Sir Arthur bases his account of Ferguson's demeanor on a passage of Burnet: \"Ferguson ran among the people with all the fury of an enraged man that affected to pass for an enthusiast, though all his performances that way were forced and dry.\" He would not perform in this forced way before Monmouth.\n\nMicah's personal adventures are excellent romantic reading, especially his captivity in a mysterious dungeon whence the most experienced reader, though he knows that the hero must escape, cannot imagine how he is to do it. Through \"The Onfall at Sedgemoor\" the author, like Scott at Flodden, \"never stoops his wing,\" for Sir Arthur is a master in the rare skill of describing a battle with lucidity and picturesque vigor. There is no better account of Waterloo, from the private soldier's point of view, than that given in his brief novel, The Great Shadow ; and Sedgemoor also is excellent.\n\nThe picture of Judge Jeffreys may be cited: probably it is quite accurate; yet Dryden admired this man!\n\nLast of all, drawn by six long-tailed Flemish mares, came a great open coach, thickly crusted with gold, in which, reclining amidst velvet cushions, sat the infamous Judge, wrapped in a cloak of crimson plush with a heavy white periwig upon his head, which was so long that it dropped down over his shoulders. They say that he wore scarlet in order to strike terror into the hearts of the people, and that his courts were for the same reason draped in the color of blood. As for himself, it hath ever been the custom, since his wickedness hath come to be known to all men, to picture him as a man whose expression and features were as monstrous and as hideous as was the mind behind them. This is by no means the case. On the contrary, he was a man who, in his younger days, must have been remarkable for his extreme beauty.1 He was not, it is true, very old, as years go, when I saw him, but debauchery and low living had left their traces upon his countenance, without, however, entirely destroying the regularity and the beauty of his features. He was dark, more like a Spaniard than an Englishman, with black eyes and olive complexion. His expression was lofty and noble, but his temper was so easily aflame that the slightest cross or annoyance would set him raving like a madman, with blazing eyes and foaming mouth. I have seen him myself with the froth upon his lips and his whole face twitching with passion, like one who hath the falling sickness. Yet his other emotions were under as little control, for I have heard say that a very little would cause him to sob and to weep, more especially when he had himself been slighted by those who were above him.\n\nMicah Clarke is a long novel of five hundred and seventy pages; but nobody, when he has finished it, remembers that it is long—which is praise enough for any romance.\n\nIn the preface to Micah Clarke the author says:—\n\nTo me it always seems that the actual condition of a country at any time, a true sight of it with its beauties and brutalities, its life as it really was, its wayside hazards and its odd possibilities, are [sic] of greater interest than the small aims and petty love story of any human being. The lists, the woodlands, and the outlaws are more to me than Rebecca and Rowena.\n\nPasse pour Rowena, but surely Diana Vernon or Beatrix Esmond is not of inferior interest to Locksley, Friar Tuck, and the lists of Ashby de la Zouche? \"To others the story of one human heart may be more than all the glamor of an age, and to these I feel that I have little to offer.\"\n\nThis is very true, and marks one of Sir Arthur's limitations. He does not interest us in love affairs, or in his women. Fielding could not only give us life \"with its wayside hazards,\" but also bring us acquainted with Amelia and Sophia, whom to have known is [a] great part of a liberal education, in the famous old phrase. In The White Company we have lists, indeed, and a scene reminiscent of that immortal passage in \"Ivanhoe,\" where the Disinherited Knight smites, with the point, the shield of the Templar. Sir Arthur's romance of Froissart's age in some ways resembles \"The Cloister and the Hearth\"; its main interest lies in its \"wayside hazards,\" whether in England, or with the wandering White Company in southern France. The hero, leaving the monastery where he has been educated with that useful old favorite, a gigantic, hard-hitting lay-brother, John of Hordle, marches to join a very good knight of fantastic chivalry, Sir Nigel Loring, and fights under his standard, south of the Pyrenees. It is a tale of swords and bows, and we cannot refrain from quoting \"The Song of the Bow,\" which provokes the very unusual wish that the author had written more verse.\n\nWhat of the bow?\n\nThe bow was made in England:\n\nOf true wood, of yew wood\n\nThe wood of English bows;\n\nSo men who are free\n\nLove the old yew-tree\n\nAnd the land where the yew-tree grows.\n\nWhat of the cord?\n\nThe cord was made in England:\n\nA rough cord, a tough cord.\n\nA cord that bowmen love;\n\nAnd so we will sing\n\nOf the hempen string\n\nAnd the land where the cord was wove.\n\nWhat of the shaft?\n\nThe shaft was cut in England:\n\nA long shaft, a strong shaft.\n\nBarbed and trim and true;\n\nSo we'll drink all together\n\nTo the gray goose feather\n\nAnd the land where the gray goose flew.\n\nWhat of the mark?\n\nAh, seek it not in England:\n\nA bold mark, our old mark\n\nIs waiting oversea\n\nWhen the strings harp in chorus\n\nAnd the lion flag is o'er us\n\nIt is there that our mark shall be.\n\nWhat of the men?\n\nThe men were bred in England:\n\nThe bowmen—the yeomen—\n\nThe lads of dale and fell.\n\nHere's to you—and to you!\n\nTo the hearts that are true\n\nAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\n\nThe roadside adventures, especially that of the man who has taken sanctuary, and of the pursuing avenger of blood, are brilliant studies of life in Chaucer's time; and, though they are many, they are not too many. The little fighting Sir Nigel, the soul of chivalry, is a very tall man of his hands—almost too excellent a swordsman for his weight and his inches—while the very plain middle-aged wife whose favor he wears, proclaiming her la plus belle du monde, is a figure as original as her lord. He is an expert in heraldry, and, his sole object being \"advancement\" in the way of honor, he holds his own in single combat with du Guesclin, though the natural odds are those of Tom Sayers against Heenan. Like the hero of the old song who\n\nMet the devil and Dundee\n\nOn the braes of Killiecrankie,\n\nSir Nigel \"fought by land and fought by sea\"; and the adventure of the \"Yellow Cog\" with the rover galleys is one of the best fights in a book full of fighting. Even after \"Ivanhoe\" the tournament at Bordeaux and the adventure of the unknown knight seem fresh and stirring; and the unknown knight, du Guesclin, is quite equal to his reputation, when we reach the Jacquerie, which was a predestined incident. The siege of a house is always a lively affair, though the artist does not represent the bald and unhelmeted Sir Nigel as a very dangerous opponent; his attitude of self-defence rather resembles that of Mr. Pickwick, which was \"paralytic\"; indeed he is offering a tame and unheard-of kind of lunge, or rather poke, from the shoulder at an almost naked adversary, who \"takes it very unconcernedly.\" When an archer shoots six hundred and thirty paces, we must presume that the author has warrant for such a prodigious deed with the long bow; to be sure the bowman makes use of his feet, \"turning himself into a crossbow.\" Sir Arthur relies on \"one chronicler,\" criticized by Mr. C. J. Longman in the Badminton \"Book of Archery\"; and that chronicler, Giraldus Cambrensis, does not stand the test of modern experiment.\n\nAs Sir Arthur adds historical notes, he might as well name his \"old chroniclers,\" with their dates; otherwise their evidence is of no great value. The novel reader, who is terribly afraid of coming to know anything accurately, is not likely to look at the notes, and be frightened away by a name and a date. The White Company is a lively romance, and very good reading for boys and friends of old times and tall knights. There is a love story; but, by separating hero and heroine early in the tale, the author ingeniously avoids a subject in which he does not pretend to shine. The mystic Lady Tiphaine, wife of du Guesclin, with her limited clairvoyance, is not a success; and the author has never distinguished himself in dealing with the supernormal. In consulting with seeresses, \"physical contact\" is very properly \"barred,\" so as to avoid \"muscle-reading\"; but Lady Tiphaine (who has a view of the future glories of the British Empire) \"would fain lay hands upon someone\" when she practices her clairvoyant art. After her success with the vision of the Union Jack, or the English banner, at all events,\n\n\"It is over,\" said du Guesclin, moodily.... \"Wine for the lady, squire. The blessed hour of sight hath passed!\"\n\nHere the author is more patriotic than imaginative, though du Guesclin was naturally vexed, being a good Frenchman, at hearing of our superior colonial expansion.\n\nThe Refugees, a tale of the court of Louis XIV, about the time of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, ends in the Iroquois country, whither the Huguenot characters have fled. The story, though full of life and action, deals with a theme which does not \"set the genius\" of the author. He has not the finesse for a romance of the court of France; and his foil to all its artificialities, Amos Green, a young English colonial trapper, is of incredible simplicity. He certainly would not have been allowed to shoot at casual birds in the streets of such rising American townships as Boston and New York, and he could not have expected such sporting privileges in Paris. Yet he is amazed and annoyed when he is not permitted to go about gunning in the midst of the French capital. He is, of course, very shrewd, much too shrewd to be so innocently simple, and he is our old friend the useful Porthos of the novel, like John of Hordle in The White Company. It is well to have a character who can open any door without a key, and fight more than the three enemies at once, whom Major Bellenden, in \"Old Mortality,\" found too many for any champion except Corporal Raddlebanes. As to the Iroquois, we know their fiendish cruelties even too well from the \"Lettres Edifiantes\" of the Jesuit missionaries, and we do not care to make closer acquaintance with them in a novel. The following passage shows the courtiers waiting for the king to get out of bed.\n\nHere, close by the king, was the harsh but energetic Louvois, all-powerful now since the death of his rival Colbert, discussing a question of military organization with two officers, the one a tall and stately soldier, the other a strange little figure, undersized and misshapen, but bearing the insignia of a marshal of France, and owning a name which was of evil omen over the Dutch frontier, for Luxembourg was looked upon already as the successor of Condé, even as his companion Vauban was of Turenne.... Beside them, a small, white-haired clerical with a kindly face, Père la Chaise, confessor to the king, was whispering his views upon Jansenism to the portly Bossuet, the eloquent Bishop of Meaux, and to the tall, thin, young Abbé de Fénelon, who listened with a clouded brow, for it was suspected that his own opinions were tainted with the heresy in question. There, too, was Le Brun, the painter, discussing art in a small circle which contained his fellow-workers Verrio and Laguerre, the architects Blondel and Le Nôtre, and sculptors Girardon, Puget, Desjardins, and Coysevoix, whose works have done so much to beautify the new palace of the king. Close to the door, Racine, with his handsome face wreathed in smiles, was chatting with the poet Boileau and the architect Mansard, the three laughing and jesting with the freedom which was natural to the favorite servants of the king, the only subjects who might walk unannounced and without ceremony into and out of his chamber.\n\n\"What is amiss with him this morning?\" asked Boileau in a whisper, nodding his head in the direction of the royal group. \"I fear that his sleep has not improved his temper.\"\n\n\"He becomes harder and harder to amuse,\" said Racine, shaking his head. \"I am to be at Madame de Maintenon's room at three to see whether a page or two of the 'Phédre' may not work a change.\"\n\nThis passage cannot but remind us of the scene with the wits at Button's in \"George de Barnwell,\" and also of an imaginative reporter's account of people at a private view, or some such function. At the period indicated, we need not be told, as we are, that people were not talking about \"the last comedy of Molière\" or of \"the insolence of Pascal.\" Molière was dead; Pascal was dead; and Paris did not talk for ever about the \"Lettres Provinciales.\" The rivalries of Madame de Montespan and Madame de Maintenon, the night ride of Amos—as adventurous, for a short distance, as that of the musketeers to Calais—remind us of Dumas, and do not bear the comparison. Montespan's attempt to have his wife beheaded is much less convincing than the decapitation of Milady. Here it is.\n\nAnd thus it was that Amory de Catinat and Amos Green saw from their dungeon window the midnight carriage which discharged its prisoner before their eyes. Hence, too, came that ominous planking and that strange procession in the early morning. And thus it also happened that they found themselves looking down upon Françoise de Montespan as she was led to her death, and that they heard that last piteous cry for aid at the instant when the heavy hand of the ruffian with the axe fell upon her shoulder, and she was forced down upon her knees beside the block. She shrank screaming from the dreadful red-stained, greasy billet of wood; but the butcher heaved up his weapon, and the seigneur had taken a step forward with hand outstretched to seize the long auburn hair and to drag the dainty head down with it when suddenly he was struck motionless with astonishment, and stood with his foot advanced and his hand still out, his mouth half open, and his eyes fixed in front of him.\n\nWe think of the terrific scene when Barbazure's head was struck from his cruel shoulders as he was directing the execution of his innocent and injured spouse, for,\n\nQuick as a flash de Catinat had caught up the axe, and faced de Montespan with the heavy weapon slung over his shoulder, and a challenge in his eyes.\n\n\"Now!\" said he.\n\nThe seigneur had for the instant been too astounded to speak. Now he understood at least that these strangers had come between him and his prey.\n\nHowever, Montespan stabs \"his bearded seneschal through the brown beard and deep into the throat\"—strange doings in the golden prime of Louis XIV. The Iroquois adventures are more plausible, and very exciting; while for villain, we have a Franciscan, more fierce and tenacious than any Dominican, who pursues a French heretic into the heart of the Iroquois country, where he gets his end more easily than the brave Père Brébeuf.\n\nA more interesting novel, despite the wild improbabilities of the plot, is Rodney Stone, where the author is on English soil, among the bloods of the Regency and the heroic bruisers of an heroic age. The prize-fighters and country folk may be more truly drawn than the dandies; but every one who, like the Quaker lady known to George Borrow, adores \"the bruisers of England\" will find this a book to his heart's desire. From the old champion, Harrison, to that Sir Nigel Loring of the fancy, young Belcher, and the strange old Buckhorse with his bell-like cry, all Sir Arthur's fighting men are painted in a rich and juicy manner, with a full brush; and his hard-driving Corinthian blackguards are worthy of them, while the Prince Regent is more successful, as an historical portrait, than Louis XIV. There are plenty of \"spirited rallies\" and \"rattling sets-to\" in Sir Arthur's short stories; but \"The Smith's Last Battle\" is his masterpiece, and the chivalrous honesty of that excellent man would have made him justly dear to Borrow's Quakeress.\n\nThe best of the author's tales of times past, we have little doubt, are collected in the volume of The Exploits of Brigadier Gerard. This gallant, honest, chivalrous, and gay soldier represents a winning class of Frenchmen of the sword, with a considerable element of sympathetic caricature. The vanity of the Brigadier and his extreme simplicity are a little exaggerated; perhaps the author did not know at first how dear Gerard was to grow to himself and to his readers. In Napier's famous \"History of the Peninsular War\" we meet many young French officers doing things as desperate as Gerard does, and doing them, like the great Montrose, with an air, with a flourish, with a joyous acceptance of a dramatic opportunity. The English officer who captures Gerard, and plays a game of écarté with him for his liberty, was just such another as himself; but \"Milor the Hon. Sir Russell. Bart\" could never have told his own story. Like Thackeray's General Webb, and like General Marbot, the Brigadier \"is not only brave, but he knows it,\" and is not at all diffident in making his hearers aware of his prowess. His fight with the Bristol Bustler is not the least audacious of his combats, though, being ignorant of the rules of the fancy, the Brigadier kicked his man. \"You strike me on the head, I kick you on the knee\"; he thinks that this is perfectly legitimate. \"What a glutton he'd have made for the middle-weights,\" exclaims the Bustler's admiring trainer, after observing, \"it's something to say all your life, that you've been handled by the finest lightweight in England.\" The Bible, as Izaak Walton observes, \"always takes angling in the best sense\"; and Sir Arthur takes boxing in the same liberal way. Keats would have sympathized with him deeply, for the poet was a man of his hands, and is said to have polished off a truculent butcher. But the Brigadier, of course, shines most with the sword, and mounted; and there is not a tale in the collection which we cannot read with pleasure more than once; indeed they are so equally good that it is hard to select a favorite. Perhaps \"How Gerard Won His Medal\" and \"The Brothers of Ajaccio\" come back most pleasantly to the memory, with the Brigadier's remarkable feat in saving the Emperor at Waterloo.\n\nTo prefer this book among Sir Arthur's is as much as to say that we deem him better at a conte than in the composition of a novel of the conventional length. This is natural, as adventure and description, rather than character and analysis and love stories, are his forte. He has omitted \"The Firm of Girdlestone\" from this collection, though we prefer it to \"A Duet,\" where the story is one of young married affection, and there are neither swords in the sun nor wigs on the green. Ladies may write love letters about merinos and alpacas, and \"a little white trimming at neck and wrists, and the prettiest pearl trimming. Then the hat en suite, pale gray lisse, white feather, and brilliant buckle.\" These things may be written, but the wooer would be as much bored as Bothwell probably was by Queen Mary's sonnets, if she really defied \"the laws of God, and man, and metre\" (especially metre) in the poems attributed to her by her enemies.\n\nNot here, oh Apollo,\n\nAre haunts meet for thee.\n\nWe cannot pretend to be interested in Frank and Maude, and \"the exact position of the wife of the assistant accountant of the Co-operative Insurance Company\"—certainly no lofty position for a bride whose father, we learn, had a billiard-room of his own, and everything handsome about him, at \"The Laurels, St. Albans.\" Francis writes \"critical papers in the monthlies,\" and here is an example of his discourse when, with his bride, he visits Westminster Abbey:—\n\nWhat an assembly it would be if at some supreme day each man might stand forth from the portals of his tomb. Tennyson, the last and almost the greatest of that illustrious line, lay under the white slab upon the floor. Maude and Frank stood reverently beside it.\n\nSunset and evening star\n\nAnd one clear call for me,\n\nFrank quoted. \"What lines for a very old man to write! I should put him second only to Shakespeare had I the marshalling of them.\"\n\n\"I have read so little,\" said Maude.\n\n\"We will read it all together after next week. But it makes your reading so much more real and intimate when you have stood at the grave of the man who wrote. That's Chaucer, the big tomb there. He is the father of British poetry. Here is Browning beside Tennyson—united in life and in death. He was the more profound thinker, but music and form are essential also.\"...\n\n\"Who is that standing figure?\"\n\n\"It is Dryden. What a clever face, and what a modern type. Here is Walter Scott beside the door. How kindly and humorous his expression was! And see how high his head was from the ear to the crown. It was a great brain. There is Burns, the other famous Scot. Don't you think there is a resemblance between the faces? And here are Dickens, and Thackeray, and Macaulay. I wonder whether, when Macaulay was writing his essays, he had a premonition that he would be buried in Westminster Abbey. He is continually alluding to the Abbey and its graves. I always think that we have a vague intuition as to what will occur to us in life.\"\n\n\"We can guess what is probable.\"\n\nTo find a likeness in the faces of Burns and Scott is certainly original criticism. These young married people certainly \"do not overstimulate,\" whether they moralize in Mr. Carlyle's house or in the Abbey.\n\nIt may be a vulgar taste, but we decidedly prefer the adventures of Dr. Watson with Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Watson is indeed a creation; his loyalty to his great friend, his extreme simplicity of character, his tranquil endurance of taunt and insult, make him a rival of James Boswell, Esq., of Auchinleck. Dazzled by the brilliance of Sherlock, who doses himself with cocaine and is amateur champion of the middleweights, or very nearly (what would the Bustler's trainer say to this?), the public overlooks the monumental qualities of Dr. Watson. He, too, had his love affair in The Sign of Four ; but Mrs. Watson, probably, was felt to be rather in the way when heroic adventures were afoot. After Sherlock returned to life—for he certainly died, if the artist has correctly represented his struggle with Professor Moriarty—Mrs. Watson faded from this mortal scene.\n\nThe idea of Sherlock is the idea of Zadig in Voltaire's conte, and of d'Artagnan exploring the duel in \"Le Vicomte de Bragelonne,\" and of Poe's Dupin, and of Monsieur Lecoq; but Sir Arthur handles the theme with ingenuity always fresh and fertile; we may constantly count on him to mystify and amuse us. In we forget what state trial of the eighteenth century, probably the affair of Elizabeth Canning, a witness gave evidence that some one had come from the country. He was asked how he knew, and said that there was country mud on the man's clothes, not London mud, which is black. That witness possessed the secret of Sherlock; he observed, and remembered, and drew inferences, yet he was not a professional thief-taker.\n\nThe feats of Sherlock Holmes do not lend themselves as inspiring topics to criticism. If we are puzzled and amused we get as much as we want, and, unless our culture is very precious, we are puzzled and amused. The roman policier is not the roof and crown of the art of fiction, and we do not rate Sherlock Holmes among the masterpieces of the human intelligence; but many persons of note, like Bismarck and Moltke, are known to have been fond of Gaboriau's tales. In these, to be sure, there really is a good deal of character of a sort; and there are some entertaining scoundrels and pleasant irony in the detective novels of Xavier de Montépin and Fortuné du Boisgobey, sonorous names that might have been borne by crusaders! But the adventures of Sherlock are too brief to permit much study of character. The thing becomes a formula, and we can imagine little variation, unless Sherlock falls in love, or Watson detects him in blackmailing a bishop. This moral error might plausibly be set down to that overindulgence in cocaine which never interferes with Sherlock's physical training or intellectual acuteness. Sir Arthur writes in one of his prefaces:—\n\nI can well imagine that some of my critics may express surprise that in an edition of my works from which I have rigorously excluded all that my literary conscience rejects, I should retain stories which are cast in this primitive and conventional form. My own feeling upon the subject is that all forms of literature, however humble, are legitimate if the writer is satisfied that he has done them to the highest of his power. To take an analogy from a kindred art, the composer may range from the oratorio to the comic song and be ashamed of neither so long as his work in each is as honest as he can make it. It is insincere work, scamped work, work which is consciously imitative, which a man should voluntarily suppress before time saves him the trouble. As to work which is unconsciously imitative, it is not to be expected that a man's style and mode of treatment should spring fully formed from his own brain. The most that he can hope is that as he advances the outside influences should decrease and his own point of view become clearer and more distinctive.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, who, in his carelessly prodigal fashion, threw out the seeds from which so many of our present forms of literature have sprung, was the father of the detective tale, and covered its limits so completely that I fail to see how his followers can find any fresh ground which they can confidently call their own. For the secret of the thinness and also of the intensity of the detective story is that the writer is left with only one quality, that of intellectual acuteness, with which to endow his hero. Everything else is outside the picture and weakens the effect. The problem and its solution must form the theme, and the character-drawing be limited and subordinate. On this narrow path the writer must walk, and he sees the footmarks of Poe always in front of him. He is happy if he ever finds the means of breaking away and striking out on some little sidetrack of his own.\n\nNot much more is left to be said by the most captious reviewer. A novelist writes to please; and if his work pleases, as it undeniably does, a great number and variety of his fellow-citizens, why should his literary conscience reject it? If Poe had written more stories about Dupin—his Sherlock Holmes—and not so many about corpses and people buried alive, he would be a more agreeable author. It is a fact that the great majority of Sherlock's admirers probably never heard of Poe; do not know that detective stories date from Dupin, and stories of ciphers and treasure from \"The Golden Bug,\" or beetle, as the insect is usually styled in English. Of Sir Arthur's debt to Poe there is no more to say than he has said. Perhaps he has not himself observed that his tale of \"The Man with the Twisted Lip\" is a variant of the adventure of Mr. Altamont in the \"Memoirs of James Fitzjames de la Pluche.\" The \"mistry\" of that hero's \"buth,\" by the way, seems to have revealed in his Christian names, which, like the motto of Clan Alpine, murmur, \"My race is royal.\" Readers who remember the case of Mr. Altamont are not puzzled by the disappearance of Mr. Neville St. Clair.\n\nPossibly the homicidal ape in \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" suggested the homicidal Andaman islander in The Sign of Four. This purely fictitious little monster enables us to detect the great detective and expose the superficial character of his knowledge and methods. The Andamanese are cruelly libelled, and have neither the malignant qualities, nor the heads like mops, nor the weapons, nor the customs, with which they are credited by Sherlock. He has detected the wrong savage, and injured the character of an amiable people. The bo:jig-ngijji is really a religious, kindly creature, has a Deluge and a Creation myth, and shaves his head, not possessing scissors. Sherlock confessedly took his knowledge of the bo:jig-ngijji from \"a gazetteer,\" which is full of nonsense. \"The average height is below four feet!\" The average height is four feet ten inches and a half. The gazetteer says that \"massacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.\" Mr. E. H. Man, who knows the people thoroughly, says \"no lengthened investigation was needed to disprove this long-credited fiction, for not a trace could be discovered of the existence of such a practice in their midst, even in far-off times.\"\n\nIn short, if Mr. Sherlock Holmes, instead of turning up a common work of reference, had merely glanced at the photographs of Andamanese, trim, elegant, closely-shaven men, and at a few pages in Mr. Man's account of them in \"The Journal of the Anthropological Institute\" for 1881, he would have sought elsewhere for his little savage villain with the blow-pipe. A Fuegian who had lived a good deal on the Amazon might have served his turn.\n\nA man like Sherlock, who wrote a monograph on over a hundred varieties of tobacco-ash, ought not to have been gulled by a gazetteer. Sherlock's Andamanese fights with a blow-pipe and poisoned arrows. Neither poisoned arrows nor blow-pipes are used by the islanders, according to Mr. Man. These melancholy facts demonstrate that Mr. Holmes was not the paragon of Dr. Watson's fond imagination, but a very superficial fellow, who knew no more of the Mincopies (a mere nickname derived from their words for \"come here\") than did Mr. Herbert Spencer.\n\nSherlock is also as ignorant as Dickens was of a very simple matter, the ordinary British system of titles. He has a client, and he looks for that client in another \"book of reference,\" not the light-hearted gazetteer which he consults with the pious confidence that Mrs. Gallup bestows on the Encyclopædia Britannica. He discovers that the client's name is \"Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral\"—not a plausible title at best. Yet, knowing this, and finding, in the \"Morning Post,\" the client's real name, both Sherlock and the egregious Watson speak of Lord Robert St. Simon throughout as \"Lord St. Simon\"! The unhappy \"nobleman,\" with equal ignorance of his place in life, signs himself, \"Yours faithfully, St. Simon.\"\n\nOf course we expect that so clumsy a pretender to be the second son of a duke will be instantly exposed by the astute Sherlock. Not so; Sherlock \"thinks it all wery capital.\" Now would Sherlock have called the late Lord Randolph Churchill \"Lord Churchill,\" or would he have been surprised to hear that Lord Randolph did not sign himself \"Churchill\"? Anthropology we do not expect from Sherlock, but he really ought to have known matters of everyday usage. The very \"page boy\" announces \"Lord Robert St. Simon\"; but Sherlock salutes the visitor as \"Lord St. Simon,\" and the pretended nobleman calls his wife \"Lady St. Simon.\" But do not let us be severe on the great detective for knowing no more of anthropology than of other things! Rather let us wish him \"good hunting,\" and prepare to accompany Dr. Watson and him, when next they load their revolvers, and go forth to the achieving of great adventures.\n\nNote\n\n\"The painting of Jeffreys in the National Portrait Gallery more than bears out Micah Clarke's remarks. He is the handsomest man in the collection.\" (Author's note.)\n\nPeter Haining (essay date 1986)\n\nSOURCE: Haining, Peter. \"Introduction.\" In The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Completing the Canon, edited by Peter Haining, pp. 7-36. London, England: W. H. Allen & Co., 1986.\n\n[In the following essay, Haining provides an introduction to The Final Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a collection of twelve \"items\" featuring Sherlock Holmes, which were written by Doyle, but never previously collected in a single volume.]\n\nSomewhere in the vaults of the bank of Cox & Company, at Charing Cross, there is a travel-worn and battered tin dispatch box with my name upon the lid. It is crammed with papers, nearly all of which are records of cases to illustrate the curious problems which Mr Sherlock Holmes had at various times to examine.\n\nSo wrote Dr Watson in 'The Problem of Thor Bridge', and one of the most deeply-felt wishes of Sherlockians everywhere has long been that these illusive documents might come to light and at last be published. Of course, many another writer apart from the revered Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has attempted to create new Adventures for the Master of Detectives and his faithful chronicler—not a few of these tales based on hints and clues contained in the existing stories—but as in the case of all great originals (which Holmes undeniably is) no substitute can ever surplant the model. For would anyone deny that in under a century Sherlock Holmes has become one of the three most famous characters in literature, the other two being Hamlet and Robinson Crusoe?\n\nAccording to the generally accepted viewpoint the Complete Adventures of Sherlock Holmes consist of sixty cases—fifty-six short stores and four novel-length tales. But, as this book will show and as more than one Sherlockian expert has already proclaimed,1 there are in fact twelve more Sherlock Holmes items which should rightly be included in the canon. What, in fact, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle left us of his immortal sleuth was seventy-two items which are all essential to a full understanding of the genius of Holmes. The reasons for these twelve items being omitted will be discussed here in detail, item by item. They are all being collected together in one volume for the very first time, and as such form an essential addition to the existing definitive two-volume edition of the stories. The assembling of these rare and difficult-to-obtain items has naturally called for considerable detective work of its own—such has been their obscurity—and fellow-Sherlockians in both Britain and America have assisted me so that we can at last make easily available the complete canon of Sherlock Holmes Adventures. It is also satisfying to be publishing these illusive items on the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Conan Doyle (he was born in May 1859 and died in July 1930), and it is the passing of his work into the Public Domain which has assisted in their publication.\n\nIf, first, we examine these remaining items, they may be categorized as follows:\n\nTwo commentaries by Conan Doyle on his famous detective: 'The Truth about Sherlock Holmes' and 'Some Personalia about Sherlock Holmes'.\n\nTwo Conan Doyle parodies featuring Holmes: 'The Field Bazaar' and 'How Watson Learned the Trick'.\n\nTwo Sherlockian cases: 'The Adventure of the Tall Man' (completed by another writer) and 'The Case of the Man Who Was Wanted' (which is the subject of some controversy as to its authorship).\n\nTwo short stories by Conan Doyle, in which Holmes emerges as the writer of important letters to the Press and which help solve baffling mysteries.\n\nTwo plays, a one-act drama—'The Crown Diamond' —and a comedy sketch—'The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes' —in which the actor William Gillette may have had a hand.\n\nAn early Conan Doyle story, 'The Mystery of Uncle Jeremy's Household', in which the prototypes of Holmes and Watson make their bow; and a poem, 'The Case of the Inferior Sleuth', in which Conan Doyle disassociates himself from Holmes's view of other literary detectives.\n\nShould any fervent Sherlockian immediately dispute the inclusion of two of the items listed, namely 'The Case of the Man Who Was Wanted' and 'The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes', the total of twelve extra items still holds good, for there are also in existence two other full-length plays by Conan Doyle—Sherlock Holmes and The Speckled Band. Sherlock Holmes was certainly written by Conan Doyle though William Gillette who made it famous may well have amended parts of it, while The Speckled Band was all his own work, a three-act drama based on the short story of the same title. These are not included in this collection, although they are undeniably part of the Sherlockian canon, for the simple reasons that they would have made this volume prohibitively long and, more importantly, both are readily available in editions published by Samuel French Ltd. So instead I have, as you will find, included in the book by way of an Appendix three other items of Sherlockiana, all by Conan Doyle. They each have a special relevance to completing our picture of the Great Detective.\n\nFor the sake of this completeness, I believe I should also mention one or two other items found among Conan Doyle's papers by his biographer, John Dickson Carr, while he was researching his Life of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1949), though neither could in my opinion be justifiably given a place in this book. In a packet marked 'Envelope XXIX', Carr tells us, he found a 'Map of Holmes's and Watson's Clash with the Enemy'—but before anyone can get excited at such a potentially important discovery he adds, 'This is a joke, not of Holmesian relevance.' More interesting, however, were three exercise books bound in thick cardboard which he came across among a collection of more than fifty of Doyle's notebooks and commonplace books. They contained a three-act play entitled Angels of Darkness, written in the author's neat and distinctive hand. Of this, Dickson Carr says:\n\n'He had written the first two acts at Southsea in 1889, the third in 1890, when Sherlock Holmes seemed to have no possible future. Angels of Darkness is chiefly a reconstruction of the Utah scenes in A Study in Scarlet ; the whole action takes place in the United States. Holmes does not appear in it. But Dr John H. Watson does very much appear.\n\n'Angels of Darkness presents a problem to any biographer. The biographer, in theory at least, must be an unrelenting Gradgrind; he should not indulge in those glorious Holmes-Watson speculations which have caused controversy on both sides of the Atlantic. But the devil of temptation prods horribly. Anyone who turns over the pages of Angels in Darkness, then, will be electrified to find that Watson has been concealing from us many important episodes in his life.\n\n'Watson, in fact, once practised medicine in San Francisco. And his reticence can be understood; he acted discreditably. Those who have suspected Watson of black perfidy in his relations with women will find their worst suspicions justified. Either he had a wife before he married Mary Morstan, or else he heartlessly jilted the poor girl whom he holds in his arms as the curtain falls on Angels in Darkness.\n\n'The name of the girl? There lies our difficulty. To give her name, a well-known one, would be to betray the author as well as the character. At best it would impeach Watson in matters other than matrimonial; at worst it would upset the whole saga, and pose a problem which the keenest deductive wits of the Baker Street Irregulars could not unravel.\n\n'Conan Doyle . . . knew he must put aside that play forever. There were good things in it, notably the comic scenes not present in A Study in Scarlet ; but a play about Watson without Sherlock Holmes would leave the public aghast; and it has not been published even yet.'\n\nDickson Carr's verdict is certainly one that all Sherlockians will, I am sure, share!\n\nBut I have dwelt long enough on items which have no place here; let me now sketch in the background to the twelve items which do complete the canon. I have arranged them in chronological order of publication, from 'The Mystery of Uncle Jeremy's Household' in 1887 to 'How Watson Learned the Trick' written in 1924 (excluding, of course, 'The Truth about Sherlock Holmes' which Conan Doyle wrote in 1923, but which reads more conveniently at the beginning of the collection) and this more than spans the whole period of the saga from when it was begun in 1887 with A Study in Scarlet to His Last Bow which appeared in 1917. If these contributions are added to the sixty Adventures we already have, they at long last bring to a triumphant finale the authentic life and cases of the 'Master of Detectives'.\n\n\"The Truth about Sherlock Holmes\" (1923)\n\nI think it would be difficult to find anything more suitable than this essay by Conan Doyle to open a collection of his last writings about Sherlock Holmes—save, of course, arranging for him to compose a completely new Introduction from beyond the grave. He actually wrote it back in 1923 for Collier's, the American magazine firm who published many of the Holmes stories, and it appeared in their journal, The National Weekly in the pre-Christmas issue of 29 December 1923. In the piece he describes how he created Holmes, the initial difficulties he had in finding a publisher, and then his genuine amazement at how the public took to his detective. This popularity in turn created its own problems as far as his literary career was concerned, and he deals with this quandary in a frank and engaging way. Sir Arthur later utilized the facts in this essay in his long out-of-print autobiography, Memories and Adventures (1924), but this marks its first republication in its original form.\n\n\"The Mystery of Uncle Jeremy's Household\" (1887)\n\nAs Conan Doyle has admitted, Holmes and Watson did not spring fully finished into his mind, but rather developed from his musing on his old university Professor, Dr Joseph Bell, and the detective story genre as a whole. Their first appearance in the form we now know and value was, of course, in the novel, A Study in Scarlet, published in Beeton's Christmas Annual of 1887. But they were actually taking shape before this and made their first bow in prototype in a tale Conan Doyle called 'The Mystery of Uncle Jeremy's Household' published in Boy's Own Paper almost twelve months prior to Beeton. It is significant to note that in his essay, 'The Truth about Sherlock Holmes', Conan Doyle makes reference to the fact that he wrote some of his earliest stories for several journals, including Boy's Own Paper, but dismisses all these efforts and trusts they will remain 'forever in oblivion'. On examination of 'The Mystery of Uncle Jeremy's Household', published in seven episodes during January and February, 1887, a reason for this attitude immediately becomes apparent: the tale is actually an early working of the idea of an intelligent and resourceful detective, complete with partner, solving a baffling mystery—the self-same format which was to make the Holmes and Watson stories so successful. Examination of Conan Doyle's work shows that he, in fact, recycled several of his early themes in later works: 'The Mystery of Sasassa Valley', for instance, which is reprinted later in this book, has at its heart a 'frightful fiend with glowing eyes', which turns out to be a rather more commonplace object. The parallel with the story of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' will be obvious to the reader. My opinion concerning 'The Mystery of Uncle Jeremy's Household' is also shared by a distinguished Sherlockian, James Edward Holroyd, who has also had a chance to read the now extremely rare and coveted issues of the BOP in which the Conan Doyle detective story appeared. In the Sherlock Holmes Journal of spring 1967 he says the story is 'remarkable as containing various echoes of Holmes and Watson before the first Baker Street adventure appeared in print.' He goes on:\n\nIn the story, Hugh Lawrence, the narrator, had lodgings in Baker Street. His friend was John H. Thurston. Sherlockians will scarcely need to be reminded that Watson's front names were John H. and that Thurston was the name of the man with whom he played billiards at the club. Lawrence, like Watson, studied medicine, while Thurston, like Holmes, was devoted to chemistry, spent his time \"happily among his test-tubes and solutions\" and even had \"an acid-stained finger\"...If 'Uncle Jeremy's Household' was indeed written, or conceived before A Study in Scarlet, all the parallels I have quoted would become precursors of the Saga and would answer the question, \"Did Sherlock Holmes originate in BOP?\"\n\nIn reading this fascinating story, brought back into print for the first time in almost a hundred years, the reader will also find some other Sherlockian parallels not quoted by Holroyd. Hugh Lawrence, like Holmes, makes a practice of studying people to discern their characters, is good as cross-examination, and is quite indifferent to the charms of women. He is also strong, brave and resourceful and prefers to solve the mysterious goings-on in the household himself rather than call in the police. The reader will, I believe, find many other features in 'The Mystery of Uncle Jeremy's Household' that were repeated in A Study in Scarlet and later Holmes's adventures, thereby making it a legitimate precursor to the saga and qualifying it for a place in the canon.\n\n\"The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes: 'The Field Bazaar'\" (1896)\n\n'The Field Bazaar', which Conan Doyle wrote in 1896, is not only a genuine early Sherlockian adventure, but also one of the first parodies of Holmes and Watson—the type of story which subsequently became very popular with other writers, and has exercised pens as diverse as those of J. M. Barrie, Bret Harte, O. Henry, Stephen Leacock, R. C. Lehmann, A. A. Milne and Mark Twain to mention just a few. The parody is one of only two that Doyle himself wrote, the other being 'How Watson Learned the Trick' which is also republished in this collection. 'The Field Bazaar' is an amusing piece about a conversation between Holmes and Watson over their breakfast table and was written by Conan Doyle to help raise funds at Edinburgh University where from 1876 to 1881 he had studied to become a doctor. (The money was to help enlarge the University cricket ground and Conan Doyle was, as we know, a great cricket enthusiast.) It appeared in the university magazine, The Student on 20 November 1896, and has subsequently been referred to, because of its elusiveness, as a 'lost adventure'.\n\n\"The Story of the Man with the Watches\" (1898) \"The Story of the Lost Special\" (1898)\n\nThese two detective stories by Conan Doyle which appeared in the Strand within a month of each other (July and August, 1898) have been exercising the minds of Sherlockians for almost fifty years. As far back as 1936 they were being described as 'Two suppressed Holmes episodes' by the noted authority Christopher Morley, and ever since argument has waged back and forward about their place in the canon. I myself have never been in any doubt, and this viewpoint is emphatically supported by perhaps the greatest expert on the saga, the American Edgar W. Smith, editor of The Baker Street Journal, who in 1956 wrote: '\"The Lost Special\" and \"The Man with the Watches\" are certainly, in my opinion, Canon-fodder. I am convinced that these accounts were written by Holmes, as were \"The Adventures of the Lion's Mane\" and \"The Adventure of the Blanched Soldier\". The style is certainly not Watson's; but it reminds me very much of \"His Last Bow\" which many, including myself, now believe to have been written by Holmes.'\n\nKnowing the delight of Sherlockians in discussing any contentious points concerning 'The Master', it is no surprise to find that there have been quite a number of articles published over the years on this issue, but almost to a man the writers support the view that both stories are part of the canon. That eminent English Sherlockian, Lord Donegall, is a strong advocate and has cited two particular quotations in the stories which he believes settle the matter beyond dispute. Writing in the Sherlock Holmes Journal, Winter 1969, he deals first with the case of 'The Lost Special' and says, 'But there can be no doubt, even in the face of Watson's silence, that the \"amateur reasoner of some celebrity\" [referred to in the story] who volunteered a solution of the case in a letter printed in the London Times on 3 July 1890, was indeed the sage of Baker Street. On this point, the evidence of the opening sentence of the letter as it has come down to us is final and conclusive.' Lord Donegall then turns to the other story: 'Nor can there be any doubt that the \"well-known criminal investigator\" [mentioned in the tale] who similarly volunteered a solution of the baffling mystery of \"The Man with the Watches\", two years later, was also Sherlock Holmes. Here again the explanation offered—in a letter to the Daily Gazette, written probably late in March or early in April 1892—did not jibe exactly with the facts as ultimately revealed; and here again the Watsonian reticence may be condoned both on this ground and on the ground of Holmes's preoccupation with other more pregnant things. But the letter itself rings true—the cold, systematic logic of the synthetic reasoning employed, and the condescending didacticism which marks the style and method of expression throughout, attest unerringly to the Master's hand.' In the light of such convincing argument, I find it impossible to deny that these two stories are not both deserved and important parts of the complete Sherlockian canon. (As a matter of record, both stories have for many years been included in all French editions of the Complete Adventures.)\n\n\"The Adventures of the Tall Man\" (C. 1900)\n\nThis is a particularly unusual and interesting item of Sherlockiana for it is the plot outline for a Holmes Adventure which Conan Doyle never wrote in full. It was discovered by another of Conan Doyle's biographers, Hesketh Pearson, while he was burrowing among the author's voluminous papers in the early 1940s. Most appropriately, he chose the pages of the Strand magazine to announce his discovery, revealing in the issue of August 1943: 'Among Doyle's papers I discovered the scenario for an unwritten Sherlock Holmes story, in which the detective, baffled by the criminal's cunning, is reduced to the strategem of frightening the villain into a confession of guilt. This is done with the help of an actor, who makes himself up to resemble the murdered man, pokes his ghostlike head into the bedroom window of the murderer and cries out his name in \"a ghastly sepulchral voice\". The criminal gibbers with fright and gives the game away.' When this announcement was made by Pearson there were some who immediately expressed doubts about the authenticity of the outline—yet these were soon swept aside by Edgar W. Smith, who retorted in The Baker Street Journal, 'I think the plot is authentic. Yes, this doubtless came from the deed-box at Cox and Co!' The item is reprinted here just as Conan Doyle left it, and apart from its intrinsic value in providing us with details of yet another case of deduction by the Master, it also gives us a fascinating insight into the way the author wrote his stories, first mapping out his characters, plot and denouement before writing the actual tale. In 1947, another well-known American Sherlockian, Robert A. Cutter, took on the difficult task of clothing this literary skeleton with flesh: it is included here and is, I think, a work of which Conan Doyle would have approved.\n\n\"The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes\" (1905)\n\nThis is another illusive and puzzling piece of Sherlockiana—a one-act play in which Holmes solves a mystery without speaking a word! It is illusive because copies have been of the utmost rarity for over half a century, and puzzling because we cannot be sure whether the author was Conan Doyle or William Gillette, the American actor who first brought Holmes to the stage in New York in 1899. Of this original four-act drama, to which I referred earlier, Peter Richard tells us: 'In 1897 Doyle wrote his Sherlock Holmes play. Both Henry Irving and Beerbohm Tree considered producing it—but eventually the play was put aside until Charles Frohman procured the rights for the American actor, William Gillette . . . It had a long and successful history, Gillette playing the part in many revivals for some thirty-five years, including a London run at the Lyceum Theatre in 1901.'\n\nIt was in 1905, when the play, Sherlock Holmes, was already an established favourite with audiences, that 'The Painful Predicament of Sherlock Holmes' was first performed in London, with Gillette in the title role. At the time the American actor was appearing in a new comedy entitled 'Clarice', but wanted a short curtain-raiser to amuse his audience. According to a contemporary report he had planned to use a humorous sketch entitled 'The Silent System' but this apparently became unavailable and a substitute had to be found. Gillette decided to look no further than the character with whom he was already becoming identified and who had aided his career immeasurably—Sherlock Holmes. And at this point the speculation begins. Some Sherlockians are of the opinion that Gillette himself dashed off the 'Painful Predicament' although there is no manuscript in existence in his hand to substantiate this, while others, notably Edgar W. Smith, feel the actor may well have called on Conan Doyle—with whom he was already friendly—to whip up something quickly for him. We do know for certain that Doyle wrote several plays and pastiches at this time (for example the already mentioned Sherlock Holmes and 'The Field Bazaar' ) and it seems not unreasonable to speculate he could easily have produced this light-hearted sketch in a matter of days, if not hours. It is also a fact that Holmes was protected by copyright in England and Conan Doyle would have had to have been consulted. In any event, the play was staged on 23 March 1905, with Gillette and a Miss Barrymore as Holmes's talkative client. Just how hastily the production had been put on was revealed in a review in the New York Times the following day: 'Miss Barrymore played her part after only twenty minutes' study, a remarkable feat of memory, and only once did she slip up on her lines. During the whole course of the playlet, Mr Gillette did not speak once, but he has certain business of writing on slips of paper and handing them to Miss Barrymore. By this means he was enabled to write the cues out for her!' As an interesting footnote to this long-forgotten play, the actor who played the only other important character in the sketch, a page boy named Billy, was destined to enjoy a form of immortality more than equalling that of Sherlock Holmes. His name was Master Charles Chaplin.\n\n\"The Case of the Man Who Was Wanted\" (C. 1914)\n\nThis is without doubt the most controversial of all the Holmes items associated with the canon. It was discovered among Conan Doyle's papers by Hesketh Pearson, and later published in America with the recorded permission of the Executors of the Conan Doyle Estate—and yet it is claimed that the story was actually the work of a retired English architect, Arthur Whitaker, who sold it for its plot to Conan Doyle for the ridiculous sum of £10! Let us, though, examine the facts. Pearson revealed his discovery in the same issue of the Strand (August 1943) in which he had reported finding the outline for 'The Adventure of the Tall Man'. He wrote, 'Another discovery of mine was more interesting: a complete adventure of the great detective called \"The Man Who Was Wanted\". It is not up to par, and Doyle showed wisdom in leaving it unpublished; though when news of my discovery reached America the threat of its suppression almost created an international incident, one Holmes fan going so far as to suggest that the future relationship between the two countries might be imperilled if this addition to the Sherlock saga was not given to the world.' Despite his lack of enthusiasm for the quality of the story, Pearson did add significantly, 'The opening scene between Holmes and Watson betrays the hand of the Master . . . By the time he wrote that story, Doyle was thoroughly sick of Sherlock Holmes.' John Dickson Carr also refers to the story in his Life of Conan Doyle (1949): 'He never tried to force a story. One Holmes story, \"The Man Who Was Wanted\" he rejected and put away. Since it has not been published, those of us who have read it can say that the central plot-idea—how a man may disappear from ship-board, under the eyes of witnesses—is worthy of that unwritten tale of Mr James Phillimore . . . But it is written casually, almost impatiently, with its author's mind and heart turned towards other matters.' Carr was not quite correct in one of his assertions, however, because 'The Man Who Was Wanted' had been published, albeit only in America. Ever since the news of Pearson's find had become common knowledge, American magazine publishers had relentlessly pursued Denis Conan Doyle, the Literary Executor of his father's Estate, for permission to reprint this 'lost adventure'. Finally, Denis succumbed to the advances of the giant Hearst Group in New York and granted permission for them to run it in their enormously popular magazine, The Cosmopolitan, in August 1948. Naturally enough, the story was heralded by a striking announcement: 'The most famous detective of all time solves his last case! A recently discovered and heretofore unpublished novelette starring the immortal Sherlock Holmes.' From that day to this the argument about the authorship has continued, although the disbelievers of its authenticity would appear to be in the stronger position as a result of the Executors actually making a payment of royalties to Mr Arthur Whitaker. Despite all that has been said and written about 'The Man Who Was Wanted', I still cannot help wondering whether Conan Doyle did not figure in its creation somehow. Sadly, neither Arthur Whitaker nor Denis Conan Doyle are still alive so that we might go over the matter anew. Perhaps, though, Sir Arthur might have had something to do with the concept or even written part of it (vide Hesketh Pearson's comment), and I find myself unable to dismiss the story as spurious as many Sherlockians have done. There is no denying the mystery surrounding 'The Man Who Was Wanted', but all the same I feel it deserves a place here. I trust you will agree.\n\n\"Some Personalia about Mr Sherlock Holmes\" (1917)\n\nSherlock Holmes was a world-wide favourite when the Editor of the Strand, Greenhough Smith, anxious to keep the detective's name featuring in the magazine, persuaded Conan Doyle to write this article about the legend he had created. The essay makes a particular point of the belief that had grown up regarding Holmes being a real person, and cites a number of instances of people writing to the sleuth of Baker Street imploring him to help them solve real-life crimes of one sort or another. Understandably, Conan Doyle also mentions the occasions when he found himself being asked to play Sherlock Holmes, with results quite as spectacular as those enjoyed by the Great Detective! 'Some Personalia about Mr Sherlock Holmes' was first published in the December 1917 issue of the Strand and has remained difficult to find ever since.\n\n\"The Case of the Inferior Sleuth\"(c. 1919)\n\nIn Holmes's first book, A Study in Scarlet, he addresses some rather unflattering remarks about two of his predecessors in detective fiction: C. Auguste Dupin, created in 1841 by Edgar Allan Poe, and Monsieur Lecoq, devised by the French writer, Emile Gaboriau, in 1866. Conan Doyle, of course, admitted that he drew considerable inspiration from the works of Poe and Gaboriau in creating Holmes, so it should be born carefully in mind that it is Sherlock who speaks these lines in that first story:\n\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. 'No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,' he observed. 'Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.'\n\n'Have you read Gaboriau's works?' I asked. 'Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?'\n\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. 'Lecoq was a miserable bungler,' he said in an angry voice; 'he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or more. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.'\n\nWatson, apparently, was not the only one to be perturbed by such ungenerous remarks about two literary characters he admired. In 1915 the American critic and poet, Arthur Guiterman, addressed some strong lines of complaint to Conan Doyle. Poor Sir Arthur saw at once that the words he had put into the mouth of his character had been attributed equally to himself. He took up his pen to defend himself in a like manner. These two poems now form a unique and important addition to the canon—Conan Doyle's lines comprising the only Sherlockian verse he ever wrote—and in them the author sets the record straight once and for all on his opinion of Holmes's literary predecessors. The Guiterman poem first appeared in a collection of light verse called The Laughing Muse, and Doyle's riposte was published some years later in Lincoln Springfield's reminiscences, Some Piquant People (1924). This is the first time they have appeared together in a collection.\n\n\"The Crown Diamond: An Evening with Sherlock Holmes\" (1921)\n\n'The Crown Diamond' is the second of Conan Doyle's short plays featuring Sherlock Holmes and is unique among his work in that it was later turned into one of the Holmes cases, 'The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone', rather than having been adapted from existing material. Records indicate that this 'Evening with Sherlock Holmes' was given its first trial performance at the Bristol Hippodrome on 2 May 1921, and then transferred to London, opening there at the Coliseum on 16 May. Although the run continued, with one break, until the end of August, there is no indication that it has ever been performed again in England, and it has certainly never been staged in America. All the evidence points to the fact that Doyle astutely adapted the play into a short story for the Strand while it was still running at the Coliseum: in any event it appeared in the magazine in the October 1921 issue. Doyle also made certain changes to the story in the transition from stage to printed page, the most important one being that the villain of the play, the notorious Colonel Sebastian Moran, became Count Negretto Sylvius in the story. Though no one would claim that Conan Doyle was an outstanding playwright, his Holmes and Watson plays do have a sense of theatre about them which must have made their performances well worth attending, and it would indeed be nice to see them revived today. It is a particular pleasure to be rescuing 'The Crown Diamond' from obscurity and placing it in the Sherlockian canon as it has only once ever been printed—and that was in a private edition of just fifty-nine copies.\n\n\"How Watson Learned the Trick\" (1924)\n\nThe writing of this Holmes and Watson parody, which Conan Doyle undertook towards the very end of his life, may well be the most curious story in the saga. In 1924 a remarkable doll's house belonging to the then Queen of England, was being put on exhibition in London. The beautifully made toy, with its exquisite miniature furniture and fittings, possessed a small library with rows of tiny books. At the time none of these books contained any text, and the idea was mooted to invite the leading literary figures of the day to write short stories which could then be painstakingly reprinted in the little volumes. Not surprisingly Sir Arthur was one of the authors who was approached and—staunch patriot that was—agreed soon thereafter producing a story he knew would be acceptable: a brief Sherlock Holmes episode called 'How Watson Learned the Trick'. On its receipt, says a contemporary report, it was 'printed and bound in one of the miniature volumes comprising the library of this elaborate Lilliputan structure.' Although the story naturally generated a considerable amount of interest while the exhibition was on, once the doors of the doll's house had been closed to the public it was soon forgotten and the text has since become excessively rare. It was briefly rescued from this obscurity in April 1951 when it appeared in a typewritten copy in The Baker Street Journal—from which it has been taken for this book. Aside from its rarity, 'How Watson Learned the Trick' is interesting because it seems to confirm the belief that Sherlock Holmes was born in Surrey. During the course of the episode, which takes place while the two friends are at breakfast, Holmes exclaims at the success of Surrey in a game of cricket. Commenting on this in his ess"
