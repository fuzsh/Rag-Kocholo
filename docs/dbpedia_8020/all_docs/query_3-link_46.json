        "text": "Jessica Plummer just released her “definitive” list of all the original 60 Sherlock Holmes stories, ranked from worst to best.\n\nNothing I do is definitive, but I’m game to follow her lead, and it should be easy because I belong to the Stormy Petrels of British Columbia and we rank the stories all the time, or at least rate them. Problem is I’ve forgotten most of the ratings, and besides I keep changing my mind.\n\nCan you really rank them anyway? Can you distinguish between, say, The Resident Patient and The Greek Interpreter? Except for the very best and the very worst (I’m looking at you, Mazarin Stone), who can sift these things?\n\nSo what I mostly hope you enjoy are my summaries: all 60 stories in bite-sized installments. Why, you can master the canon in half an hour or less.\n\nSo herewith a list, but from best to worst: let’s start with the good stuff (but it’s mostly good stuff)\n\nCopper Beeches. Watson shoots a mad dog. The heroine finds her own hair in a drawer. Another character is like Rapunzel in the tower. You must sit here and here and here. What is going on? There’s horror, adventure, and detecting all in one. And some of the detecting is done by, gasp, a woman. No, not THAT woman but another woman who interests Holmes perhaps as much as Irene Adler. Watson even hopes for a little romance, but …\n\nSilver Blaze. The curious incident. A horse race. An explanation of what men really want (to win a horse race, of course). Holmes gets his own back at an uppity colonel and makes sure that everything is fair and square (sort of). And there’s binoculars.\n\nThe Red-Headed League. Hilarious. A red-headed league? Oh, come on. But really it’s about robbing a bank. Or is it? Maybe it’s a chance to show off Holmes’s powers and have him debate rationality with Watson. What is stranger, truth or fiction? Trust a work of fiction to tell us (or don’t).\n\nThe Cardboard Box. Ooh, ears in a box, but what’s going on? Very puzzling. And some Holmesian mind-reading. What could be better? Oh, and adultery.\n\nThe Naval Treaty. It’s roses, roses, all the way. Such free association. Such problem-solving. A locked-room mystery. A boiling kettle. And the bell that rang from the empty room. And those beacons of the future, the Board Schools.\n\nA Study in Scarlet. The brilliant first story. Well, brilliant in its first part, then Utah? Oh, well. But Part One is worth the price of admission. RACHE.\n\nThe Man with the Twisted Lip: Birds, lighthouses, opium, disguises. And the joy of begging. True, Holmes gets things wrong, but it doesn’t matter.\n\nThe Engineer’s Thumb. Ooh, more gore. First ears in a box, then a thumb that isn’t there. And strange international intrigue. And an engineer who can’t find worthwhile work. Plus a thrilling escape.\n\nThe Sign of the Four. The horrifying face in the keyhole, the nervous Thaddeus Sholto, a chase on the Thames. Oh, and a boring romance between Watson and Mary Morstan, but never mind that. And don’t forget the blow darts and the wooden leg: Long John Silver, eat your heart out.\n\nThor Bridge. What a plot! (I won’t give it away.) And a tempestuous New World beauty, a Gold King, a fairy tale. It’s from the Case-Book, but they weren’t all bad.\n\nThe Creeping Man. Another Case-Book entry. Monkey glands! The problems of old age (if old age means being 61). Climbing, leaping, bounding. Egad!\n\nA Scandal in Bohemia. Here’s the one with THAT woman, the woman. She’s very clever, she outsmarts Sherlock. Some people really love it (and her). But really this is the story where the relationship with Watson takes off: Watson throws a smoke bomb! He’s on the team now.\n\nThe Missing Three-Quarter. Such comedy: You mean you don’t know who I am? How can you not know who I am? But then tragedy. The funniest story and the saddest.\n\nThe Second Stain. Another intersecting story: a document is stolen à la Naval Treaty. But then there’s a murder! How do they fit together? Well, maybe they don’t. And maybe spouses should talk more.\n\nThe Blue Carbuncle. The Christmas story! Who could fail to like it? And poor Henry Baker and his marriage and his hat. Sigh. Keep your carbuncles; what you need is a goose to share with someone, though a woodcock will do.\n\nThe Beryl Coronet. Keep your business close and your family closer. Or something. If you get it wrong, you’ll end up running down the street like a madman.\n\nThe Musgrave Ritual. Oaks and elms and catechisms. Who can figure out the real meaning of the old ritual? Sherlock Holmes, of course. Brilliant! But the ending deteriorates into speculation. Ah, well.\n\nThe Dancing Men. Another one that begins well, with another cipher, but at the end isn’t it a bit of anti-climax? American gangsters? We hoped for something more other-worldly.\n\nThe Solitary Cyclist. Ooh, adultery, sort of. Love triangle or quadrangle or who knows how many angles? Bearded men on bicycles. Holmes and Watson to the rescue!\n\nThe Six Napoleons. Statue, statue, who’s got the statue? Clever plot. And a journalist scooped on his own doorstep, with an allusion to Dracula. A bit xenophobic, though.\n\nA Case of Identity. Holmes solving. Holmes awing Watson. Holmes arguing with Watson. And an Angel. Some loose ends, though. And icky quasi-incest.\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles. Some would rank it higher. It drags in the middle, though, when Holmes disappears: what is a Holmes story without Holmes? But when he and Watson are together, it’s the old magic after the long hiatus. And there’s a Sherlock Holmes impersonator: what cheek! Not to mention the Hound.\n\nThe Priory School. A counterweight to The Six Napoleons. Here the foreigner is hero and victim, not villain. And there’s a hilarious opening scene featuring Thorneycroft Huxtable, MA, PhD, etc. And some nasty aristocrats. And bicycles.\n\nWisteria Lodge. Suppose you slept over at a friend’s and when you woke up everyone was gone? That’s an intriguing beginning. But the end trails off into a political backstory, though there is voodoo.\n\nThe Three Garridebs. Comedy, sort of. Not as funny as The Red-Headed League, which it resembles, but there’s the absurd Nathan Garrideb clearing bones away so that Holmes can sit down. But it’s really about decline, isn’t it? The passing of old glories. Also friendship: Holmes cares about Watson! Who knew?\n\nThe Bruce-Partington Plans. Speaking of resemblances, here’s one resembling The Naval Treaty. A bit of a rehash, but I do like that Cadogan West (one of the good Arthurs in the canon). And there’s Mycroft. And the top of a train.\n\nThe Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax. She disappears so well that we hardly see her in the story. Instead, there’s one of those bearded villains again: or maybe he’s not the villain, or maybe he is. And Holmes is in one of his let’s upbraid Watson moods when Watson actually did well. Does one dislike the story as a result or relish the strange relationship?\n\nThe Sussex Vampire. Vampires? There’s no such thing as vampires. Holmes figures out what’s really going on. Watson realizes he’s growing old. Holmes realizes Watson is not very bright. (Why does Watson share these things with us?)\n\nThe Reigate Squires. Oh, those nasty squires. And the Holmes-Watson relationship, with Watson totally misunderstanding what Holmes really needs (a case). And why does Holmes need a case? Because he loves solving puzzles, and we love watching him solve them, especially when he can get in some cryptic remarks that baffle the local constabulary.\n\nThe Speckled Band. I know, Conan Doyle ranked it first, but he couldn’t even remember its name. Swamp adders, evil things from abroad, even more evil things from at home. Don’t listen to your fiancé. And watch out for the phallic symbolism.\n\nThe Norwood Builder. What is art? Holmes gives a lesson here: don’t spoil your masterpiece by making one last revision. Oh, and where there’s smoke there’s a Norwood Builder.\n\nThe Yellow Face. Trying not to be racist, is the story racist all the same? But the real point is the husband-wife relationship and the recurring theme of trusting your spouse. Very touching.\n\nThe Greek Interpreter. Mycroft! His first appearance, and Conan Doyle gets so caught up in introducing the smarter brother and developing the fraternal rivalry that he forgets to make sense of the plot. Still, Mycroft!\n\nThe Noble Bachelor. Runaway bride! America and England united! Holmes making fun of Lestrade! No actual crime, but does that matter?\n\nThe Retired Colourman. Time to say goodbye. One last hurrah by Holmes, confronted by a criminal so brazen he calls in Holmes himself to solve the crime. Interesting, but it’s the end.\n\nThe Illustrious Client. Oh, that Kitty Winter. So vitriolic. Not like Violet de Merville. And ooh, the evil Baron Gruner. Not much mystery here, though, except to figure out why this Violet is so foolishly above it all.\n\nThe Blanched Soldier. No Watson, but James Dodd fills in nicely. Leprosy – or is it pseudo-leprosy? Good detective work by Holmes, mostly. A bit of a misfire about the Lancet.\n\nThe Resident Patient. A struggling doctor adopts an unusual approach to make ends meet. Conan Doyle’s autobiography? No, no: a story in which Sherlock Holmes proves it’s not suicide, but murder. (It’s never suicide, is it? No, that’s not true.) Mostly backstory, though.\n\nThe Crooked Man. Another backstory tale. What really matters is what happened in India long ago. Oh, and a Biblical quotation.\n\nThe Stockbroker’s Clerk. A bit of a rehash of The Red-Headed League. Some clever deduction by Holmes about Watson’s medical practice (except maybe he’s sort of wrong). Amusing jab at anti-Semitism. Lots of doubles or doubling. And brothers.\n\nThe Abbey Grange. Domestic violence stirring Holmes’s sympathies, but first he has to figure out what’s really going on, which means starting afresh after being misled. How to be a good detective – and a good human being?\n\nThe Golden Pince-Nez. Another criminal smoked out. Well, not a criminal perhaps, or is she? Not for now, but back then? More political backstory. Holmes does good deducing, though.\n\nBlack Peter. Harpoon practice. Good use of the hiring hall. Be careful about initials. Don’t jump to conclusions. Good detecting advice. But we lack a client, and the ending is mystifying.\n\nBoscombe Valley. Blackmail is worse than murder. Moonshine is better than fog. Watson should learn to shave. A pretty standard reputation-is-the-motive story, but it’s hard to accept letting the murderer go like that.\n\nThe Three Students. An anti-xenophobic story, so that’s nice. There’s a staircase and a Bannister (ha ha) and a kerfuffle over cheating on an exam. Hmm. Oh, well, cheat on an exam and you get sent to the colonies. So there.\n\nShoscombe Old Place. This time Conan Doyle indulges in a little anti-Semitism of his own. Still, an interesting story about the decline of England. Clever use of a dog. Echoes of the Fall of the House of Usher. Not all that much detective work, unless you count hanging out at a crypt.\n\nThe Three Gables. I know, I know, racism, a sort of minstrel show, but an interesting mixture of that with a sad tale of unrequited love and the depiction of a powerful but villainous woman. And some Keats.\n\nThe Gloria Scott. Holmes’s first case. But no Watson, except as an audience. You lose something. But the typical reputation-as-a-motive theme is here. And the distant past. But we miss Watson.\n\nThe Lion’s Mane. Another story without Watson, and no James Dodd to fill in. And the criminal is a – well, I won’t say. Don’t go swimming, that’s all I’ll say, at least not in Sussex tidal pools. And such skin problems.\n\nThe Veiled Lodger. Another lion story. Another domestic violence story. But Holmes and Watson mostly listen to a confession rather than solving anything. Still, there are all sorts of symbols and allusions.\n\nThe Valley of Fear. A cipher! Holmes and Watson bickering. Good times. But too much theorizing (a capital error). And Part Two? The Scowrers in America? It’s an interesting thriller, but is it Sherlock Holmes? And such a gloomy ending.\n\nThe Red Circle. The lodger is not the lodger! There’s another lodger. Capital deduction. But it’s downhill from there, ending with a long account of goings-on in a Mafia-like organization. Like the Scowrers? Like the Nihilists in the Pince-Nez? Like the criminal gang in The Resident Patient? The Central American politics in Wisteria Lodge? I see a theme here.\n\nThe Five Orange Pips. Brain attics and lumber rooms. Interesting stuff. But what a mess Holmes makes of things. The client dies, the criminals are never caught, and we never really figure out what it was all about. Except perhaps that even god-like detectives have their limitations.\n\nThe Dying Detective. Is Holmes dying? Not again! No, no, it’s all a ruse because of the murder of somebody’s nephew. Wait, the murder of somebody’s nephew? Where is that story? Indeed.\n\nThe Empty House. The return from the Dead. But do we want Holmes back from the dead? Wouldn’t it be good if we blew him up again with an airgun from the house across the street? Ah, well, perhaps not. We will have to subside into Tree Worship: do trees come back from the dead too? Too bad there’s no case for Holmes to solve.\n\nThe Final Problem. This is not a Sherlock Holmes story; it’s an anti-Sherlock Holmes story. Next thing you know we’ll have Watson wanting to settle down and give up adventures (oh, wait, he said that already before). Conan Doyle really had to learn to stop trying to kill off the best thing he ever did. Oh, and Moriarty? Please.\n\nThe Devil’s Foot. Wow, hallucinations. And bleak moors, and death trap bays. A mysterious murder, but mysterious only in its means. A howdunit. Things are more interesting when we have to discover the why, not the how. But Watson’s visions are impressive.\n\nCharles Augustus Milverton. Reputation, reputation, reputation, I will commit a murder for my reputation and in plain sight of Holmes and Watson, so we know exactly who did it – and where’s the mystery in that? Very dramatic, though, and there’s a cat.\n\nHis Last Bow. An east wind. Motorcars. Sherlock Holmes goes to war. All that’s missing is a mystery to solve and narration by Watson. All.\n\nThe Mazarin Stone. Well, we couldn’t end with His Last Bow, but is this the best Conan Doyle could do as a revival? No Watsonian narration, a rehash of the airgun and the dummy plot, a boring sleight of hand trick. Some old furniture and the pageboy Billy. Sigh. The story that gave The Case-Book a bad name.\n\nFor more details on each of the stories, see my book of Sherlockian Musings, available at Amazon Canada, Amazon USA, and Amazon UK.
