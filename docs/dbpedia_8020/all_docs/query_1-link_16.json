        "text": "Sherlock Holmes is easily the most famous detective of all time. And I absolutely love a good Holmes mystery. A couple of years ago, I decided to read all the Sherlock Holmes adventures, including the four novels and the 56 short stories over the course of one year. And I had a blast! But, author Arthur Conan Doyle’s feelings toward the famous detective were decidedly more complicated. Sure, Holmes made him famous, but with this fame came a sort of typecasting, and Conan Doyle, try as he might, was never able to crawl out from under Sherlock’s shadow. Even killing off the detective in “The Final Problem” was not enough, as legions of fans clamored for the detective’s return. And while he wanted to write about other things, including a newfound passion for spiritualism, he was mostly known as the man who wrote Sherlock Holmes.\n\nSo, today, we’ll be looking at the works of Conan Doyle…but not Sherlock Holmes. There will be adventure, mystery, and more, but no Dr. Watson and no hawk-nosed detective in a deerstalker hat. Holmes hardly needs any more promotion (although I love the detective dearly!). So, whether you’ve read all the stories multiple times or if you’ve never been a fan of Sherlock’s I encourage you to check out this list. Fans will enjoy finding more by this wonderful author while non-fans can appreciate the scope and talent of Conan Doyle, without having to see Sherlock at all. Who knows? You just might find something new to love!\n\nA quick word of warning: When I started this list, I expected to find only a handful of non-Sherlock titles. But, what I found was a huge, almost overwhelming list of short stories, novels, and non-fiction titles. While I’m sure I’m still missing some things, I’d like to present to you this list of 40+ books for your reading enjoyment. To make things easier, I’ve also divided my huge list into categories, loosely grouping the titles by genre.\n\nFiction\n\nThe Firm of Girdlestone. A father and son run a business together.
