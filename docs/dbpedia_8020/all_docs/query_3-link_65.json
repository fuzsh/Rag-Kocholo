        "text": "As Holmesians are aware, the literary works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are referred to as the Canon of the Sacred Writings. The title of this collection of short stories reflects my desire to belong to the extensive list of authors and fans that want to grow the literary and entertainment history of Sherlock Holmes. In the five short stories, readers will note Holmes’ continued mastery of forensic science and logical reasoning as the cornerstones of resolving the thorny issues presented. Holmes’ analysis and deductions are the centerpieces of the stories that form this collection. I hope you enjoy your time with Sherlock."
