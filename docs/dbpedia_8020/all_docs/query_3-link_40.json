        "text": "\"Echoes of Sherlock Holmes: Stories Inspired by the Holmes Canon\" edited by Laurie R. King and Leslie S. Klinger (Pegasus Books, 348 pages, in stores)\n\nCome Watson, the game is afoot!\n\nAnd how! If you are a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's consulting detective series — the original 56 short stories and four novels, also known as the Holmes Canon, differentiating those tales from those told by other authors through the decades following Conan Doyle's death — you owe it to yourself to read this collection, a follow-up volume to \"In the Company of Sherlock Holmes,\" a 2014 anthology of stories inspired by the canon.\n\nI found myself laughing with delight, and turning pages with trembling fingers, driven to see what came next as each new author spun a tale related, in some way, to Conan Doyle's immortal characters in \"Echoes of Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nJohn Connolly, in \"Holmes on the Range,\" explores the fantasy of popular literary characters who come to life upon the deaths of their creators — picture Oliver Twist dining with Don Quixote within the walls of a private library. Except, in this case, because Conan Doyle tried to kill off Sherlock Holmes in 1893 in the story \"The Final Problem,\" Holmes and his companion Dr. John Watson show up at the Caxton Private Lending Library & Book Depository before their time and, to the consternation of the librarian, Mr. Headley, Conan Doyle decides to resurrect his characters in a new series of stories. Would this mean, upon the author's death, a second set of Holmes and Watson would appear?\n\nMeg Gardiner, in \"Irregular,\" introduces us to Shaz, a sharp-eyed lass who works for Croft Security, who determines a woman's apparent leap from her office window is not suicide, but murder.\n\nDana Cameron's \"Where There Is Honey\" sends Holmes and Watson on an adventure that explains Holmes' decision, upon retirement, to become a beekeeper.\n\nTasha Alexander's \"Before a Bohemian Scandal,\" as suggested by the title, introduces us to Holmes' romantic interest, Irene Adler, in events that help set up Conan Doyle's \"A Scandal in Bohemia.\"\n\nDavid Morrell, in \"The Spiritualist,\" has Holmes again taking solid form to confront his creator, Conan Doyle, during the author's later years when he became rather obsessed with life after death, photos of faeries and seances.\n\nTony Lee and Bevis Musson, in \"Mrs. Hudson Investigates,\" provide an illustrated look at how Holmes' housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, takes on the task of consulting detective in the days following Sherlock's apparent demise at Reichenbach Falls. (Some readers might be shocked at what is suggested to be going on between Watson and Inspector Lestrade.)\n\nHank Phillippi Ryan's \"The Adventure of the Dancing Women\" introduces a more modern female team of Holmes and Watson as they attempt to decipher emails containing only emojis to determine why a dance instructor's fiancee is so terrified.\n\nWith other stories by Anne Perry, Michael Scott, Hallie Ephron, Gary Phillips, William Kent Krueger, Catriona McPherson, Deborah Crombie, Jonathan Maberry, Denise Mina and Cory Doctorow, the reader is sure to be amazed, delighted and entertained from one end of the book to the other."
