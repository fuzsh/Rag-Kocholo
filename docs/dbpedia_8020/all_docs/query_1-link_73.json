        "text": "About the Book\n\nCollection of (1) The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes ; The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle, featuring his most famous fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. The individual stories had been serialized in The Strand Magazine between June 1891 and July 1892, and the book was first published in October 1892. Homes and Dr. Watson are common to all twelve stories. The stories are told by first-person narrative from the point of view of Dr. Watson. (2) The Return Of Sherlock Holmes; The Return of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of thirteen very interesting Sherlock Holmes stories that were published in 1903-04 in the Strand Magazine in UK and Collier’s in the United States. (3) The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes; The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of Sherlock Holmes stories, originally published in 1894 by Arthur Conan Doyle. In the American edition there are eleven stories, while in others there are twelve. All these stories appeared in the Strand Magazine. The stories in the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes are very popular. Each story has been adapted in TV series. (4) The Hound of the Baskervilles; The Hound of the Baskervilles is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s third crime novel featuring the detective Sherlock Holmes. It was originally serialized in The Strand Magazine from August 1901 to April 1902 and published in the book form in 1902. The story is set largely on Dartmoor in Devon in England’s West Country and revolves around an attempted murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin. Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson investigate the case.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nARTHUR IGNATIUS CONAN DOYLE (May 1859 – July 1930), a British writer and physician, is most noted for his fictional stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes. His stories are widely acclaimed as milestones in the field of crime fiction. Doyle is also known for writing the fictional adventures of Professor Challenger, another character created by him, and for popularising the mystery of the Mary Celeste. He was a prolific writer and his writings include fantasy and science fiction stories, plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels. From 1876 to 1881, Doyle studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He began writing short stories while studying. His first published piece, “The Mystery of Sasassa Valley”, a story set in South Africa, was printed in Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal in 1879. The same year, he published his first academic article, “Gelsemium as a Poison” in the British Medical Journal, a study which was regarded by the Daily Telegraph as potentially useful in a 21st century alleged murder investigation. Doyle’s first work featuring Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson was A Study in Scarlet, which appeared in the Beeton’s Christmas Annual in 1886 and received good reviews in The Scotsman and the Glasgow Herald. It is said that despite the roaring success of Sherlock Holmes, he wanted to wind up the character “for good and all” as he “took his mind from better things.” But the publishers demanded more Holmes stories and were willing to pay him the large sums he asked. As a result, Doyle became one of the best-paid authors of his time. Holmes featured in a total of 56 short stories—the last published in 1927—and four novels by Doyle, and has since appeared in many novels and stories by other authors. Arthur Conan Doyle influenced Agatha Christie and many other detective fiction writers with his famous detective/fiction stories."
