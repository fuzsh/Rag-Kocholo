        "text": "Eddy Webb\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n3 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 29, 2022\n\n--\n\nA friend recently asked me for a curated list to the seven Sherlock Holmes list written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and I thought I’d share it more widely.\n\nTLDR: If you read one book, make it The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. If it’s two, add in The Hound of the Baskervilles. From there, I’d hit the other short story collections, and finally the other three novels if you’re really interested. The cases aren’t presented in chronological order anyway, so skipping around doesn’t hurt much.\n\nA Study in Scarlet: It’s the origin story, but it’s pretty skippable. Doyle was still figuring things out, and it literally turns into a different novel halfway through. That said, the second novel is deep American West weirdness, and thus somewhat entertaining in its own right, but it’s only half a Holmes story.\n\nThe Sign of the Four: One of the weaker novels. I’d skip it if you’re just hitting the high points.\n\nThe Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Probably the high point of Doyle’s work. Most of the stories are iconic: “A Scandal in Bohemia” (featuring Irene Adler), “The Redheaded League,” “The Adventure of the Speckled Band,” and my personal favorite, “The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle”. Do not skip.\n\nThe Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes: The second half of Doyle’s high point. This is where Moriarty gets introduced in “The Final Problem,” but there are also some good stories like “The Greek Interpreter” and “The Musgrave Ritual.” If you have to skip it, though, at least read “The Final Problem” for the iconic showdown with Moriarty.\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles: The most well-known Holmes story, which is wild because Holmes isn’t actually in it very much. But a great Gothic story with an eclectic cast of characters, and a decent mystery to boot.\n\nThe Return of Sherlock Holmes: Worth it for “The Adventure of the Empty House” (which is a sequel to “The Final Problem”), and most of the remaining stories are decent, like “The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton,” “The Adventure of the Second Stain, “The Adventure of the Dancing Men,” and “The Adventure of Black Peter.” But if you skip the rest, you’re not missing much.\n\nThe Valley of Fear: Doyle only came back to writing Holmes for the money, and it starts to show here. Aside from a Moriarty retcon (that is handled badly), you can skip this, even though it has my favorite minor character, Fred Porlock.\n\nHis Last Bow: Let’s be charitable and call this the most “experimental” of the Doyle volumes. Granted, it has some genuinely good stuff like “The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans” which is very early 20th century technothriller stuff, or “His Last Bow” where Holmes gets involved in World War I. Really, though, “His Last Bow” is the main story anyone remembers, because it talks about Holmes’ retirement period."
