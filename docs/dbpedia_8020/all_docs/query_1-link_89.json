        "text": "Portland has long been home to filmmakers and video game developers who love to mix and match genres. In another example of that kind of culture-crossing creativity, a new puppet-based TV pilot and videogame project aims to blend comedy, mystery and some Sherlock Holmes-style atmosphere.\n\nThe TV pilot for the project, “Fogtown,” will premiere Aug. 22 at the Tomorrow Theater, the Southeast Portland venue operated by PAM CUT, the Portland Art Museum’s Center for an Untold Tomorrow.\n\nCreated and directed by Austin Hillebrecht and Sean Parker, “Fogtown” is described as a “hand-crafted comedic mystery-adventure series made entirely with miniature sets, immersive 3D-rendered backgrounds, and quirky puppets supported by equally professional sound design, voiceover artists, and an original score by local composer Bryan Christopher Saylor.”\n\nThe crime-solving characters include “Sherblock,” and his best friend, “Blockson.” You don’t have to be a detective to deduce that they’re inspired by Sherlock Holmes and Watson, the duo created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nIn the pilot for the proposed TV series, Sherblock “yearns for recognition,” and matches wits with a nemesis described as the “mysterious, dreaded Moth Napper.”\n\nAs the creators said in an Oregonian/OregonLive story in 2022, they originally had an idea for a story “involving a writer who gets writer’s block, which manifests by turning his head into a blockhead. Ultimately, that kernel of an idea evolved into ‘Fogtown,’ with a Sherlock Holmes character with a square noggin.”\n\nAnother source of inspiration came from the filmmakers’ being intrigued by the “Sherlock” TV series that starred Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.\n\nAt the Aug. 22 event at the Tomorrow Theater, the creators and cast members will talk about the decade-long journey to make “Fogtown.”\n\nIn addition to the TV project, the “Fogtown” universe also includes an interactive videogame franchise. The first installment of that franchise, “A Rum Case in Fogtown,” is scheduled to be released as a demo later this year.\n\nAt the “Fogtown” pilot event on Aug. 22, attendees will also get to play the game on the Tomorrow Theater screen, by making suggestions about what should happen.\n\n“Fogtown” received a fiscal sponsorship from PAM CUT, as part of a program available for multimedia artists working in such media as TV, film, gaming, interactive media, animation, and podcasts to engage in tax-deductible fundraising.\n\nThe “Fogtown Grand Showcase” event begins at 7 p.m., Thursday, Aug. 22, at the Tomorrow Theater, 3630 S.E. Division St. Tickets are $15.
