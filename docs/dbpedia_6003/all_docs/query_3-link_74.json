If it's here, we use it. We don't plug shit for profit.\n\nWhy Spend a Weekend in Freiburg?\n\nWhen Europe has so many options, with so much to offer, why spend a weekend in Freiburg?\n\nSimple, because it has everything from rocking parties, beers by the steins and food that will have Road Runner stopped in his tracks. Numerous bars brace the slowly flowing Grewerbekanal in a kind of Amsterdamesque party zone. Nights rage on from the bars to the clubs with live bands. Likewise, parties bellow from the trees throughout Schlossberg.\n\nIf nights out aren't for you, do not worry! There are loads of things to do in Freiburg. The Black Forest awaits your daily daring adventures whilst the beauty of the Dreisam and Seepark lie in wait a little closer to home. Hikes, mountain bike trails and other crazy activities surround Freiburg. So, if you can't fall ass-over-tit and break an arm here, you won't be able to do it anywhere.\n\nFoodies, hands up! I hear you.\n\nAs with nature lovers, partygoers and sunset chasers, the city is for you too. Flavourful meats roast over an open flame at the aromatic market, and fresh baked goods and veg play a crucial supporting role. Similarly, restaurant foods are to die for, with traditional German foods making an appearance throughout the city and after trying many, they come highly recommended by me.\n\nSpend a weekend in Freiburg. I dare you. You will not regret it.\n\nWhat's Freiburg Like?\n\nWhilst small, homely and easily negotiable, Freiburg packs out levels of fun and excitement you'd expect of both Berlin and Munich.\n\nAt the heart of Freiburg is its old town, which, in turn, is dominated by Freiburger Münster, a 12th-century gothic cathedral. The market square surrounding the cathedral, Münsterplatz, is the life and soul of the city. Every morning, bar Sundays, Münsterplatz transforms into a fragrant, kaleidoscopic market. The sounds of sizzling sausages, laughter and the pitter-patter of feet running around looking for the day's ingredients, flowers, and little treats fill the air. It's buzzing!\n\nIt feels cosy, warm and friendly whilst still sneaking a few euros from your wallet. However, you don't mind! Giving up a few euros for a mouthwatering delight is like lending your old grandad a fiver for a pint at his old man's club. It feels good.\n\nUniquely, these vibes then course throughout the city streets like blood pumping from the heart.\n\nEveryone has a smile on their face, and the city feels upbeat, happy and has a zest for life. Truthfully, who wouldn't, when you have the beauty of the Black Forest on your doorstep, the cooling waters of the Dreisam running through the city and stunning walks and views on every surrounding ridge?\n\nAfter dinner comes the lull before the storm, the quiet time. However, as darkness falls on Freiburg, the city roars back to life as the students turn from workbooks to steins of beer. Once again, the city transforms. It's like festival season twenty-four-seven. Where love and romance complete the city's picture. Couples, friends and potential lovers meet through the bars and clubs.\n\nSimply put, I love the city, and if you do too, it will return that love and more.\n\nAdvertisement (sorry, man's gotta eat...)\n\nHow to Get To Freiburg\n\nFirstly, Freiburg is in the southernmost west corner of Germany and has an airport. Although, it only has about ninety-five flights out a day, and they're pretty much only to and from Europe and a couple from North Africa.\n\nHowever, if you're flying, the best option is to fly into Basel, Switzerland. Although the airport is actually in France. Sounds crazy, right?\n\nYet, it is essential to know, as French air traffic control loves to strike. Likewise, as with the recent pandemic, France had very different entry rules from Germany and Switzerland. Who, at times, both had contrasting regulations from each other.\n\nTo mask or not to mask, that was the question.\n\nFrom Basel\n\nAnyhoo, from Basel, you can get one of many trains from Basel Bad to Freiburg, including the slick and sensible ICE, which takes just under forty minutes. Your other option is to take the local trains, the RE7, which do the same route, only cheaper and slower, coming in at around forty-two minutes.\n\nThankfully, both are comfortable and on time. Remember, as I note on my Backpacking Germany page, the €9 ticket for public transport could return, and you can buy these in Basel.\n\nOn the other hand, if you hire a car and drive, the fasted toll-free route would be up the E35 to Karlsruhe, then dive off onto the 31A to Freiburg.\n\nFrom Almost anywhere in Germany (not including flights)\n\nGet yourself to Stuttgart. Why here? Because it's the nearest biggest city that you may know. From here, you have options.\n\nTrain - Take the ICE918, change at Karlsruhe on to the EC9 or take the ICE1968, then change at Karlsruhe on to the ICE279.\n\nDrive - Hit up the B14 tunnel south and join the L1187 west onto the A8 to Karlsruhe. Just south of Karlsruhe, merge onto the A5 south. Keep going until you get to the B31A into Freiburg. You're looking at a two-hour fifteen-minute journey.\n\nBus - Jump down to Stuttgart Vaihingen station and hop onto the Flixbus, which goes via Karlsruhe and takes around two hours and forty-five minutes.\n\nTiming your Trip\n\nHow Long Should You Spend in Freiburg, Germany?\n\nWell, this is awkward.\n\nAs the blog title is \"a fun-packed weekend in Freiburg, Germany\", I have to say, a weekend. However, if you have longer, take it. Let's be fair - it's just a catchy, shitty title.\n\nTherefore, take a long weekend. Four days in Freiburg is enough to munch your way through the markets and restaurants and enjoy a night out. Equally, you'll have time to spend a day in the Black Forest or visit the nearby Colmar or Basel, if you wish.\n\nThe Best Time Of The Year For a fun-packed weekend in Freiburg.\n\nIn truth, the best time to visit Freiburg depends on you and what you want from your travels.\n\nDuring the summer, the weather is warmer, the sun comes out to play, and the streets are alive with laughter. It is fantastic, not to mention the sunsets rock.\n\nAlthough, from April to October, you'll be able to enjoy the markets, which, in my view, is a must.\n\nHowever, there is a flip side. Have you ever heard of Christmas?\n\nFreiburg and the nearby town of Colmar in France are known for their Christmas Markets and sublime atmosphere. I haven't had the pleasure of visiting Freiburg during this season yet. But I will.\n\nTherefore, the best times of year to visit Freiburg are April to October or December for those oh-so-pretty Christmas markets.\n\nAdvertisement (sorry, man's gotta eat...)\n\nWhere to Stay Whilst Visiting Freiburg, Germany\n\nWhilst I love the city, there is only one place to stay. Ideally, in the old town itself.\n\nHowever, if you cannot find somewhere within it, anywhere within a ten-minute walk will suffice. If you're further out, you will cover more miles than you need to. Either that or spend more on public transport, that is, unless the €9 ticket makes a reappearance.\n\nElsewise, there isn't much to say. You know the standard of accommodation you like and your price range.\n\nAs always, I can only talk about the accommodation I've visited. Nevertheless, below I've added links to three booking platforms covering differing costs, styles and levels of comfort.\n\nStadthotel Freiburg\n\nWhat: Basically, a standard 3-star hotel with plenty of conference and function rooms near the old town.\n\nWhere: A six-minute walk northeast of the old town. (map)\n\nWhy: Clean, friendly and well-priced, not to mention in a good location.\n\nWhy Not: It's a little clinical and made me feel like I should be in a suit, prepping for an important meeting.\n\nThis review is tricky because I was within a short walk of Münsterplatz (the old town), and the room was cosy, clean and well-equipped. All the staff I met were friendly and helpful. Honestly, it was lovely. Therefore, everything points to a glowing review.\n\nHowever, I just felt out of place.\n\nAs mentioned, if I was staying in Freiburg for a business conference, I'd have been more than happy. But I wasn't. I was there to see the city. It left me feeling out of place and awkward.\n\nLikewise, it's also hard to give a glowing review when my key card failed serval times in two days, and I had to move rooms because the door reader eventually packed up completely.\n\nIn conclusion, for the money, it just wasn't worth it. It's not like this is a cheap place to crash for two nights.\n\nIn July 2022, I paid around £127 (€145) for two nights.\n\nFurther Accommodation\n\nFirstly, there will be better accommodation in Freiburg than Stadthotel, and probably cheaper, especially if you're visiting Freiburg on a budget.\n\nIf that is the case, try the Hostelworld link below. It is what I would have done. However, like a travel newbie, I left it way too late, and this was about the only place available.\n\nAs I found out, there aren't that many hostels in Freiburg. Therefore, my advice is - if you want cheap accommodation, especially for a weekend in Freiburg, book it early.\n\nNevertheless, if there's a small group of you, there are many Airbnb options in and around the old town.\n\nIf you have further questions, please drop me a message on Instagram or a comment at the bottom of the blog.\n\nAdvertisement (sorry, man's gotta eat...)\n\nBest Things to do in Freiburg, Germany\n\nWhilst the blog is dubbed what to do on a fun-packed weekend in Freiburg, you don't have to be here on the weekend. There are so many things to do in Freiburg and the surrounding area you'll have a blast no matter the day of the week.\n\nNevertheless, one of my favourite experiences in Freiburg, bar the food, was exploring the city on foot. I found that whilst you could use the trams, you didn't really need them unless you were going out of the centre to Seepark or the Black Forest.\n\nHowever, there are some obstacles. Little streams called Bächle run throughout Freiburg, and they're easy to fall in. Rumor has it that if you fall in the Bächle, you will marry a girl from Freiburg. I mean... not against the idea. There are some very-attractive girls in town.\n\nOh no, I fell.\n\nBut, on a serious note, keep an eye out for the Bächle, and you'll be grand.\n\nOutside the Bächle and my list below, you can hike the Black Forest or spend a day in Colmar, Basel or the nearby Europa Park.\n\nHow to spend the best weekend in Freiburg: The Highlights\n\nIn no particular order:\n\nVisit the Gothic Freiburger Münster\n\nGrab a Bite to Eat at the Münstermarkt\n\nMarvel at the Arts within the Augustiner Museum\n\nRelax in See Park\n\nClimb Aussichtsturm Schlossberg at Sunset\n\nVisit the Gothic Freiburger Munster\n\nWhy: For me, it's because of the architecture, prowess and beauty.\n\nWhere: In the heart of the old town, in Münsterplatz. (map)\n\nHow long: You won't need long. Fifteen to twenty minutes should suffice.\n\nHow much: Free entry and free to walk around.\n\nFreiburger Münster is, without question, the centrepiece of Freiburg.\n\nThe gothic, early 1200s cathedral is exquisite in every way. From the base to the tip of the spire, the cathedral oozes elegance, craftsmanship, beauty and almost impossible levels of detail.\n\nYou can capture the exterior from afar as it thunders above the surrounding old town, or you can, and should, experience it from close up and get hands-on from Müsterplatzs.\n\nOnce there, stroll under the grand doors pointing west of the square and soak up the immediate peace within. Everything is on a scale unseen by the rest of Freiburg - it's massive. Similarly, the interior is sublime and worth a visit.\n\nIf you want to learn and explore more of the Münster, you can take a guided tour for €5. Your call.\n\nGrab a Bite to Eat at the Münstermarkt\n\nWhy: Traditional fresh foods, delicious flavours and irresistible smells. Need I go on?\n\nWhere: Right next to Freiburger Münster in Münsterplatz. (map)\n\nHow long: Generally speaking, an hour is more than enough unless you eat everything in view.\n\nHow much: Yeah, right. It depends on how much of a foodie you are.\n\nBetween 07:30am and 1:30pm, Monday to Saturday, the vibrant square of Münsterplatz plays host to an unmissable and lively market.\n\nOver one hundred stalls scatter around the impressive Freiburger Münster, selling everything from fresh and fragrant flowers to sizzling sausages and freshly baked goods. You'll predominantly find meats (hot and cold), cheeses, fruit and veg, honey, hot and cold drinks, wine and handicrafts. The smells and sounds are irresistible as you mingle with the crowds. Heaven is how I would describe it. Enjoy!\n\nA morning mooching around the stalls is a morning well spent and something everyone should do during their weekend in Freiburg.\n\nSome advice: Whilst you can pay with a card at some stalls, many do not accept them. Therefore, it's better to have cash on you.\n\nMarvel at the Arts within the Augustiner Museum\n\nWhy: Not a massive museum or a religious artefact fan, but it's interesting as hell.\n\nWhere: less than five minutes walk south of Freiburger Münster. (map)\n\nHow long: Honestly, an hour will do it, after breakfast next door at manna - die Spezerei.\n\nHow much: Eight euros - it has to be worth that, surely.\n\nIf you are into history or if you're a religious person, this will get your spidey senses tingling. Frankly, it's not my thing. Yet, weirdly, I did enjoy it.\n\nFollowing the path through the exhibits leads you on a journey of discovery as you weave through the old monastery, meandering through the ages of religion.\n\nThere are so many impressive statues, stain-glassed windows, artefacts and a mighty impressive beast of an organ. You'd be silly to miss out, especially as it's only eight euros.\n\nRelax in See Park\n\nWhy: Ice cream, clean air, relaxing Japanese Garden and a lake for water activities.\n\nWhere: Fifteen minutes northwest of the old town on the tram. (map)\n\nHow long: You'll need a minimum of two to three hours here.\n\nHow much: Free entry to the park, swimming and the Japanese Garden. Sadly though, the ice cream will cost you.\n\nAs with any city break, it is always nice to get out of the city for a half day, or in this case, where you only have a weekend in Freiburg, a few hours.\n\nObviously, will the hills and the Black Forest on your doorstep, you do have other options to get out of the city. However, Seepark is easily accessible from the old town via tram 1 to Landwasser.\n\nIn the park, you can relax amid the greenery, grab an ice cream, climb the lookout tower and swim in the cooling lake. Hell, you can jump from the bridges if you like. It's all fun and games during the summer when it's nice and hot, not so much in the cold winters.\n\nOverall, it's just somewhere lovely to lay back and relax. However, my favourite part of the park is the beautiful petit Japanse Garden behind the restaurant.\n\nCheck it out and enjoy a few hours of pure relaxation.\n\nClimb Aussichtsturm Schlossberg at Sunset\n\nWhy: The views are astonishing. Sunset is even better.\n\nWhere: On top of a big hill just east of the old town. Enjoy the climb. (map)\n\nHow long: Until the sun dips behind the northern horizon, or if you're like me - until you get hungry.\n\nHow much: Another one of Freiburg's free attractions. Get in!\n\nHidden with the slopes of Schlossberg, just outside the old town, is the cleverly designed Aussichtsturm Schlossberg.\n\nHaving reached the top, you will have climbed 153 steps, standing at 463 meters above sea level and a commanding 185 meters above the city. Wait for the wobble as the whole structure blows in the breeze. Don't worry, it's designed that way.\n\nThe walk up the mountain consists of winding s-bend pathways weaving through the trees, and honestly, it's not as easy as you first think it would be.\n\nHowever, the hike is well worth the effort.\n\nNo matter when you make your ascent, you will find a stunning view of Freiburg. Although, for me, the sunset just rocks, and that, my friends, is when I suggest you visit too.\n\nYou'll also catch incredible views of Freiburger Münster on your way down as the sky lights up with those fantastic reds, oranges and yellows.\n\nAdvertisement (sorry, man's gotta eat...)\n\nWhere to Eat on a Fun-Packed Weekend in Freiburg\n\nListen up foodies, one of you is talking.\n\nAs we know, traditional German foods are amongst the best in the world, and you can find them all right here in Freiburg.\n\nOrdinarily, when I talk about going out for lunch or dinner, my advice is to steer clear of the main squares. However, this is not the case in Freiburg. Some of the best meals were in or around the main square, Münsterplatz.\n\nNevertheless, one rule you should stick to in Freiburg is to eat local dishes. After all, the chefs of Freiburg have grown up cooking traditional German foods, and they're bloody good at it.\n\nFor the most part, you will be eating in restaurants, but do not limit yourself to them. The famous Münstermarkt rustles up some of the freshest ingredients, treats and flavours around town.\n\nFurthermore, I found the prices and portion sizes very reasonable, and it's not often I say that, especially in Europe.\n\nSo, without further ado, let's dive into these tasty treats.\n\nZum Bunten Onkel\n\nWhat: Typical German grub done right.\n\nWhere: On the south fridges of Münsterplatz. (map)\n\nHow much: A hearty meal will set you back around €10-€15 -(£8.50 - £12.50). (menu)\n\nAs far as the first forage into German cuisine goes in Freiburg, there is nowhere better than Zum Bunten Onkel.\n\nAfter all, how often do you eat a delicious meal surrounded by the magical atmosphere of Münsterplatz and the staggeringly impressive Freiburger Münster?\n\nAnd that's before you open the menu.\n\nAs with all my choices in this blog, you'll have a superb selection of German classics to select from. All you have to do is pick one.\n\nGoldener Anker\n\nWhat: Schnitzel specialists along with other sumptuous German crowd-pleasers.\n\nWhere: A ten-minute walk due south over the Dreisam from Freiburg Müster (map)\n\nHow much: The meal in the picture was €19.90 (I'd pay that again). On average, meals cost between €15-€20 (£12.50-£17). (menu)\n\nA stylish boutique restaurant that you'd expect to find in the Instergrammable parts of Barcelona or Madrid than Freiburg.\n\nThe beautiful outdoor decking area adds to an-already impressive ambience that the outstanding team have created for you.\n\nHowever, none of this comes close to stealing the show. That accolade goes to the delicious schnitzel drizzled in that sauce and a mouthwatering customary German side.\n\nIf you don't come here during your weekend in Freiburg, you've missed out big time.\n\nMartinsbräu\n\nWhat: Without sounding like a broken record, it's another traditional german restaurant with a brewing twist.\n\nWhere: Next to Martinstor on the western flank of the old town. (map)\n\nHow much: A delicious dish here will set you back between €11-€14 (£10-£12). (menu)\n\nAtmosphere, home brewing, and proper stoggy German classics. That is what you can expect from this beautiful laid-out location.\n\nAim for the sausage, schnitzel, pork or other traditional meals and a craft beer specially brewed for you.\n\nEach one tastes like a colossus dish of perfection.\n\nFrankly, the place couldn't be more German unless it was covered in lederhosen at a Christmas market, and I, for one, love it.\n\nGive it a try, it's fantastic. The only issue is deciding on which meal to try.\n\nManna - die Spezerei\n\nWhat: Freiburg's breakfast specialists - with a fresh yet traditional twist.\n\nWhere: Next to the Augustiner Museum entrance, just south of Freiburger Münster. (map)\n\nHow much: A divine start to the day (tea, fruit, traditional German bread and juice) will set you back around €20 (£17). (menu)\n\nIf you want to wake up properly every morning in Freiburg, wake up with a brekkie at Manna - die Spezerei. The juice is freshly-squeezed, the staff are super happy and friendly, and the tastes are mouthwatering.\n\nThey have everything your stomach would want, including just-out-of-the-oven loaves of bread to sliced meats, fruit that has just been hand-picked and flavoursome yoghurts that are so fresh they're still fermenting. It's divine.\n\nIdeally, weather depending, grab a table outside and enjoy those rocking flavours with the sounds of the little sparrows playing in the trickling bächle.\n\nAnother plus! You're right next to the Augustiner museum, so you don't have far to go if you want to see that. You won't regret it.\n\nAdvertisement (sorry, man's gotta eat...)\n\nWhere to Party on a Fun-Packed Weekend in Freiburg\n\nFirstly, Freiburg is a well-renowned university city, which means two things; students and beer. Both help create a fun and friendly environment to dive headfirst into debauchery within a swinging party atmosphere.\n\nWe all know that Germans love to party. So, when you add a university, quality vibes, and everything from live Jazz cellars to hilltop bars with a view, you know you're in for a good night.\n\nAs with any city nightlife, safety is paramount. Having experienced the city, I think it was extremely safe, and despite a lot of drunkness, I never saw any issues involving violence or other concerning behaviours. However, it is a city, which means problems will occur, as with any other city, so keep that in mind during your weekend in Freiburg.\n\nNow that's out the way, let's look at the fun-packed areas, bars and nightclubs to grab a chilled drink or get completely wrecked.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nKastaniengarten\n\nWhat: Hilltop student hangout with exceptional views.\n\nWhere: On the southeast corner of Schlossberg near the beautiful Schwabentor. (map)\n\nLocated on the edge of a green and leafy hilltop, this fun and friendly outdoor bar provides stunning views of the city below and the valley out to the west.\n\nAs translated into English, the Chestnut Garden is a quirky student haunt and is ideal for groups, hikers returning from the hills and those looking for a relaxing leafy environment. With fantastic beers on tap, a buzzing, excitable atmosphere and delicious small bites, the Kastaniengarten is your perfect summer spot in Freiburg.\n\nIt's not the most tricky hill to climb, but after a few steins, it's undoubtedly steep enough to roll back to the city fairly quickly.\n\nBiergarten Brauerei Feierling\n\nWhat: Large venue for the beer-guzzling, fun members of society with a lively atmosphere.\n\nWhere: Nestled within, what I call, the Amsterdam area of the city, a short hop, skip and jump from Schwabentor. (map)\n\nNo weekend in Freiburg is complete without a few beers on the balcony of Biergarten Brauerei Feierling. In English, this translates as Beer Garden Brewery Celebration, and it's easy to see why.\n\nAs with several places in Freiburg, the beer garden is known for its brewing techniques and unique hand-crafted beers.\n\nWeekend evenings here celebrate all things good in the world, with the ambience to match. It gets busy, and I mean busy, but it's all good. The beers flow like the Rhine and also like the Rhine - it never looks like stopping. People plunder in until the early hours, and the party stays in full swing deep into the early hours.\n\nSadly, this only opens during the warmer months, and the beer garden is weather-dependent. If it's open, it's a no-brainer - enjoy.\n\nMamita Club\n\nWhat: Large Latino-styled nightclub with raving at its heart.\n\nWhere: A block north of Freiburg Münster. (map)\n\nIf this Latin club doesn't have you up on your feet dancing like a rabid warthog, then nothing will.\n\nThink German techno club meets Latin America ballroom, and you're halfway to understanding the madness within.\n\nIn truth, it's a nightclub where you go to loosen your inhibitions and let the night take you wherever it takes you. Great fun and well worth a session during your weekend in Freiburg.\n\nAdvertisement (sorry, man's gotta eat...)\n\nIs Freiburg Safe?\n\nOf course, all cities have their issues, but the only problem you're likely to stumble upon during a weekend in Freiburg is enjoying yourself too much.\n\nIn reality, there are very few safety concerns surrounding Freiburg. If anything, your main issues are not looking where you're going or getting drunk and falling into a bächle.\n\nLikewise, if you are walking in the Black Forest or up Schlossberg and don't look where you're going, you are likely to trip over a branch, root or something underfoot.\n\nThe old town is effectively completely pedestrianised, so there are few concerns regarding road safety. All I will say is keep an eye out for the trams, but even they don't pick up too much speed.\n\nWith this in mind, I have to declare Freiburg a safe and friendly place to visit.\n\nAdvertisement (sorry, man's gotta eat...)\n\nLeave a comment\n\nThank you for reading my Freiburg blog. Hopefully, I have clarified a few thoughts you may have had or given you a few ideas to help you make the most of your time here.\n\nUltimately, as you can probably tell, I loved the city. Although admittedly, after a long weekend in Freiburg, you would soon run out of things to do. Nevertheless, until that point, it's well worth a visit.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of both the city and my blog in the comments below. Have I missed any key ingredients or overlooked something I shouldn't have? Likewise, has anything changed since my visit in July 2022? If so, let me know.\n\nOnce again, thank you, and I hope you now agree with me that you should spend a weekend in Freiburg despite Europe having so many other fantastic places to visit.\n\nIf you're visiting Freiburg, you may be interested in these nearby places...\n\nKarlsruhe, Germany – A Travel Guide\n\nJoin me as I look into a sinister story and enter the gateway to the Black Forest.\n\nMunich, Germany – A Travel Guide\n\n… And for breakfast, how about a nibble on a bit of sausage and a couple of pints.\n\nBerlin, Germany – A Travel Guide\n\nJoin me for wild nights and sobering mornings in the electric city of Berlin."
