        "text": "I'm assuming you don't plan to rent a car.\n\nHow practical it will be to stay in other towns in those regions (as opposed to less-touristy neighborhoods in those towns/cities) will sometimes depend on your sightseeing plans. For week-long stays with multiple day trips, it can get annoying to have to start out every day with a train or bus trip to the transportation hub and then often have to immediately transfer to another train or bus to get where you really want to go.\n\nI favor long stays myself, and I always choose the big city as my base, but I like cities, and I spend a lot more time in museums than the average visitor. Plenty of folks much prefer the more intimate environment of a smaller place.\n\nBarcelona has a lot of sightseeing in the city itself, but there are lots of good side trips available. How do you think you might spend your time in that area? I sometimes recommend that folks spend a few nights in Girona, north of Barcelona. It does get a lot of tourists itself, but many are just daytrippers. Girona has a feel that's very different from Barcelona, and it's very well-positioned for side trips to the Dali Museum in Figueres, the attractive former fishing village of Cadaques and medieval Besalu.\n\nIn Barcelona you might like to look at the neighborhoods of Eixample and Gracia. The local subway system is very useful, and of course there are also buses.\n\nNice is the transportation hub for the Riviera. There's a very handy regional train line running along the coast, so you can visit the coastal towns quite easily from a base other than Nice, as long as you're staying near a train station. However, the towns up in the hills usually require a bus trip, and the buses tend to fan out from Nice. Seven days is long enough that you'll probably be taking a bunch of side trips, so staying in Nice itself would be more efficient. It's not essential, though, if you want yo be in a smaller town. Two options others have mentioned are Villefranche-sur-Mer and Antibes. Do look at a map, though, to be sure your planned side trips won't be excessively long from the base you're considering. The coastal trains are not fast. I wouldn't choose to,stay somewhere east of Nice if most of my sightseeing was going tombe west of Nice, or vice versa.\n\nSeven nights would be a very long time in the Cinque Terre. Are you hard-core hikers? The towns are totally swamped during day tripping hours, and there's not much sightseeing that doesn't involve hiking. I think a week would feel like a long time in any of them if you weren't heading uphill to hike just about every day. What are your plans in that area? We need that information to suggest alternatives.\n\nA week in the Lauterbrunnen Valley suggests that you are hikers. I think folks will be in favor of your staying in Lauterbrunnen or higher up if your main goal there is to hike. But that's a very popular area, and it may be getting late to find lodging there for the peak summer period. Others will be able to advise you better.\n\nI don't know Bavaria well at all. Other posters should be able to make suggestions if they have an idea of how you plan to use your time there. Munich is not a city where I'd expect to find a week's worth of sightseeing, but I could be mistaken about that.\n\n7 days in Barcelona is fine if you are happy with day trips: there are plenty to choose from. But 5-6 days would be enough.\n\n7 days in Nice is perhaps a bit long even with day trips: consider maybe 5?\n\nWith these 2 adjustments, you could spend 3-4 days in Nîmes as a midway point between Barcelona and Nice, to visit Arles, Nîmes itself, and Pont du Gard. There are direct trains from Barcelona to Nîmes.\n\nFor the Italy portion, a week in Liguria is a good idea, but not in Cinque Terre. I would consider S Margherita Ligure or nearby Rapallo or Camogli as a base. Sestri Levante is another option. That way, you can easily explore the entire coast from Genoa to La Spezia without having to deal with the crowds of Cinque Terre. 5-6 days would probably enough but nothing wrong with extra days for R&R!\n\nLugano does not align well with the train route from Liguria to the Lauterbrunnen valley: I would suggest Lake Maggiore instead. Stresa, Baveno are good bases. Cheaper than Lugano, as a bonus. 2 full days/3 nights is enough.\n\nNo comment on Lauterbrunnen valley.\n\nBavaria is a large region: what do you want to do there? 7 days means you'll need to make choices, but as mentioned above you could probably steal a few days from other stops and make it 9-10 days in Bavaria if it makes sense.\n\nA general question about your chosen stay lengths: 7-night stays are often required by self-catering tourist accommodation in high-season. Is that the reason for your trip layout? If\n\n\"...the goal is to blend some of the typical tourist activities with some of the daily activities of people living in the region.\"\n\nNoble and mostly achievable, I think. But for me your chosen destinations appear to be mostly \"shiny objects\" that will probably work against your objectives. To get closer to the people and their everyday lives, book stays in places which are not highlighted in Rick's materials; In Germany, while there might be a few good choices for you on this page, the specific place names should all be viewed with suspicion. I would categorically avoid places like Rothenburg, Füssen and the Romantic Road in favor places where tourists from around the planet do not outnumber locals. If you follow his rec's at all, you would probably do well to start with the BOTTOM of his list (under \"More time\") where places well outside Bavaria are mentioned.\n\nWürzburg (also near the bottom... Rick recommends it only if you have 21 days or more for Germany) might be a good starting point for your research as there are many interesting places nearby where you might stay or visit. This corner of Bavaria (except for Würzburg and Rothenburg) is somewhat underappreciated by the international tourist crowd but at the same time is full of historical/cultural/recreational opportunities that might suit tourists with goals like yours. The city of Nuremberg (lovely place) is nearby, and the airports of Munich and Frankfurt are both accessible. Here's a snapshot of the area that shows how the towns are connected by railways:\n\nhttps://unterfranken.bayern-online.de/uploads/pics/mainfrankenbahn_liniennetz.jpg\n\nWe have previously booked apartments in Neustadt-an-der-Aisch and in Bamberg and traveled by train on day outings to visit Würzburg, Nuremberg, and the smaller places named below. But I'm sure that other smaller towns like Bad Windsheim and Iphofen could serve as good base towns as well. Local beer breweries abound. For more cultural experience, perhaps you'll find a vacation rental on a farm or at the home of a local winemaker. There are great walking/hiking/biking options throughout the region as well.\n\nBad Windsheim (and the excellent Franconian Open-Land Museum)\n\nIphofen\n\nOchsenfurt\n\nSommerhausen\n\nNeustadt-an-der-Aisch (photos)\n\nBad Kissingen\n\nBamberg\n\nMarktbreit\n\nCloser to Lauterbrunnen than Bavaria: consider the Black Forest region (Schwarzwald in German) just north of the Swiss/German border; skip Freiburg and Baden-Baden, focus on the rural locations for a glimpse at local life, maybe stay at a local farm... great train connections exist around the Black Forest as well.\n\nA site that inspires and informs on farm stays in the Black Forest and around Germany:\n\nhttp://bensbauernhof.org/\n\nRail transport in the Black Forest:\n\nhttps://prospektbestellung.toubiz.de/media/prospekt/file/5736289_KONUS_GB_2022.pdf\n\nI lived in Augsburg, Germany (on the Romantic Road for four years).\n\nThe road has several walled medieval towns that are well preserved and great places to visit.\n\nTourists do not flock to all these towns, in fact, Rothenberg ob der Tauber is mainly the one that draws lots of tourists.\n\nhttps://www.romanticroadgermany.com\n\nThe first visitors were friends and families of the American soldiers stationed in the large bases in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg but the idea of the trail from Würzburg to Füssen soon became wildly popular.\n\nIt's not too hard to see the reason for the popularity - despite the modern roots of the idea, the tour combines the historic cities of Würzburg and Augsburg with the three medieval walled towns of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Dinkelsbühl and Nördlingen, and then finishes off with the tourist highlights of Neuschwanstein Castle and the Alps.\n\nDonkelsbuhl is similar to Rothenburg, but without as many tourists\n\nNördlingen, however, is far less crowded than the other two and offers an additional attraction of geological interest - being located in the crater of a meteorite impact and with its impressive tower being built of the rock formed from that impact.\n\nThe walls of the city were built on the edge of the meteoite crater.\n\nDonauwörth goes back to the 12th Century and has many impressive medieval buildings.\n\nAugsburg is a larger city that was founded over 2000 years ago during Caesar Augustus reign. The Town Hall is amazing as well as the first settlement (17th Century) for the poor were people still live.\n\nMost of the smaller towns sustained little or no bomb damage in WWII. Places like Munich and Nuremberg were pretty much bombed out and rebuilt."
