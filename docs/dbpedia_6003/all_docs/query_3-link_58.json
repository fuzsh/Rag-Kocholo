        "text": "I didn’t find any maps that included the actual lengths of stretches, but I found two that at least tell you the speed limit (or absence of one). I entered the legs into Google maps to get their lengths.\n\nI found one map on autobahn-speedhunter.com from 2012 (according to copyright) and another from autobahnatlas-online.de (link to the second map’s colours’ explanation; solid blue streches have no limit) from 2009. The autobahnatlas map is from 2009 and no longer maintained due to the work involved. The speedhunter one relies on input by users to report new (or removed) speed limits thus it may or may not be entirely accurate. To the best of my knowledge there is no official source and documentation of the beginning and ending of speed limits.\n\nContestants for longest stretches with the validity caveat given above, taken from the autobahn-speedhunter map:\n\nA 38, A 14 and A 4 from Göttingen to Dresden (c. 312 km)\n\nA 20 from Lübeck to Prenzlau (c. 290 km)\n\nA 7 from Bad Hersfeld to Aalen (c. 252 km)\n\nA 31 from Papenburg to Bottrop (c. 185 km)\n\nA 96 from Munich to Lindau (c. 170 km)\n\nA 3 and A 92 from Passau to Erding (c. 148 km)\n\nA 5 from Karlsruhe to Freiburg (c. 116 km)\n\nA 81 from South of Stuttgart to Singen (c. 109 km)\n\nNote that I have the feeling that the map is not entirely accurate; e.g. autobahnatlas mentions speed limits in the Landshut area on the A 92. Many people have confirmed similar issues with the A96 (a 120 km/h section in the centre around Memmingen), and the A5 (speed limit around Rastatt). I don’t know whether your information will get any better than this, though.\n\nTraffic-wise, I would assume the A20 and A31 to be the ones with the least other cars and no significant lorry traffic (although most of these stretches are probably empty at 3 a.m. as Gayot mentioned). The A20 especially was criticised as being just some tarmac in the countryside without any cars travelling on it.\n\nA note on the safety aspect\n\nOther answers have already said this, but it bears repeating. Be especially careful when driving at very high speeds, especially if you are not familiar with the car! Deceleration is quadratic with respect to distance so if ‘some idiot’ decides to pull over into the left lane at 130 km/h and you shoot in from behind you’ll have some serious braking to do. Worse if there was a curve.\n\n90 % of all drivers think that they are among the best 10 % of drivers. Go figure.\n\nI can not comment yet on this SE, and this is not an answer to the question, but I feel like I have to warn you. And the other two answer you got (Jan's and Tor-Einar Jarnbjo's) are still pretty good.\n\nBefore you go racing, you may want to check this video about a situation identical to yours:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/fUapNMXiz0k\n\nThis happened a year ago on a Hungarian highway. There are absolute speed limits in the country, but the guys did not care... The initial situation is pretty much like what you planned: they rent a Lamborghini Huracan, took it on the highway, and drove it at 330kmph., while the passenger was recording. The highway there is a really high quality one, as close as you could get to a raceway in an Autobahn. (As a Hungarian I have been there occasionally.) Still, the event happened:\n\nThey lost control of the supercar, It wrecked, turned upside down and burned completely out. The driver suffered, miraculously, only light injuries, could get out of the car and pull the seriously (permanently!) injured passenger before it burned to ashes, thus they survived the impossible. The recording they made also survived, making it possible for the Hungarian Police to submit it.\n\nThe moral is that you must be extremely careful when you do what you planned. This was an identical situation, and the result was nearly fatal. And considering most of the German Autobahns were built long before this part of highway, they might be in worse condition, making this outcome more likely.\n\nThere is absolutely no part of any German highway guaranteed to have no speed limits. Even if there is usually no speed limit, road works are quite common, not always announced in advance and usually bring with them a speed limit of 80 or even some time 60 km/h.\n\nIf you still want to give it a try, you can find several helpful resources online. The web site http://autobahnatlas-online.de/ (unfortunately only in German) has several maps with information about the German highway network. You can find a map of all highways with their speed limits here and an explanation of the colours here (highways without speed limits are dark blue).\n\nMy persional suggestion would be to try the eastern part of A20. Between the junction 'Uckermark', the eastern end point of the highway and Jarmen, you have about 100km without any regular speed limits. After a short stretch with 100 km/h where the highway goes through the city of Jarmen, you have another long strech of highway without any speed limits. The A20 is also one of the highways in Germany with the least traffic. I have only driven the suggested eastern part a few times, but even in the daytime, there was almost no traffic on the road.\n\nA few disadvantages is of course that this particular strech of highway is in an area without much tourism, there is not incredibly much to see and even the scenery is rather boring."
