        "text": "People, no matter in which part of the world, are increasingly opting for settling in a metropolitan context: by 2030 the world urban population is expected to rise to an all- time high of 70%. Therefore, cities will play a crucial role for the future of the planet: this is why their structure and their future planning must follow the so-called “best practices”, to guarantee the development of these urban areas must follow the criteria and the principles of sustainability, avoiding excessive soil and resource consumption and limiting emissions, as well as guaranteeing affordable housing for everyone and a decent living standard: in shorter words, limiting their “ecological footprint”1. Worldwide, one of the most famous sustainable city examples is the German municipality of Freiburg im Breisgau, which is well known for its “green” orientation: it will be analysed as a case study throughout this paper, with the objective to gather some indication for other cities which aim at becoming greener; on the other hand, limits of the Freiburg model will also be investigated.\n\nIn recent years, sustainable urban development has emerged as a relevant but contested field in urban studies. A broad and diverse literature has discussed sustainable development from various perspectives. Some authors have researched urban sustainability from a technocratic perspective, looking for technical and managerial solutions. Others have shed light on the political dimension of urban sustainable development in our times of urban neoliberalization. This branch of literature focuses on the problematic relationship between market-oriented growth on the one hand and aspects of equality and justice on the other hand, which come along with the idea of sustainability. This article argues that the professionalization and new forms of urban management, as well as a shift towards urban governance and citizens’ participation have inten- sified consensual practices of urban regulation. Sustainable politics that have occurred in many cities around the world place emphasis on justice, tolerance and participation as the principal drivers for urban development. Empirical evidence shows, however, that these goals are subjugated to economic growth. Drawing on empirical work carried out in Freiburg, Germany – a city long hailed as a forerunner of urban sustainable development – this article promotes the opinion that the idea of ‘sustainable development’ in its current form is nothing more than an oxymoron, aimed and invented as a fuzzy concept in order to disguise the fundamentalist believe in growth that lies beyond such development.\n\nThe concept of sustainable development has promoted around the world for years by taking action to implement it on a global scale. Hence, as a development paradigm, it appears in many strategic documents at every planning level. The main goal of the research is to determine whether and to what extent the idea of sustainable development manifests itself in the contemporary urban concepts. The analysis covered publications, events and selected urban projects. As the beginning of the time frame, the 1960s were adopted, which together with the 1970s are the background to the changes that led to the crystallization of the idea of sustainable development. This is a period of decline and criticism of the idea of modernism, the crisis of cities, as well as the beginnings of the trend of postmodernism. The following years-the 80s, 90s and the beginnings of the 21st century-is a gradual development of the concept: a compact city, a green city, an intelligent city, as well as searching for ways to implement sustainable development in cities. The analysis of the contemporary concepts of shaping cities has shown a lack of consistent, uniform planning and urban planning criteria for sustainable development. However, this does not necessarily mean the faults of the idea itself, but the advantage of an individual approach to each city and the possibility of its flexible implementation. The conducted analysis also showed that particular contemporary concepts are based on similar assumptions, or even are opposed to each other. None of them offers the perfect city. Individual ideas of urban development can be implemented separately or creatively combined with each other. Although none of the ideas of shaping cities is fully complete and universal, it is important to treat the city as one organism, and seeking for its sustainability, consistently use selected planning tools, adapting ideas to the context and scale of the city. Further search for the right direction of urban development is a task that in a given time perspective may lead to an improvement in the spatial, social, economic and environmental situation, and consequently to a higher quality of life for the residents."
