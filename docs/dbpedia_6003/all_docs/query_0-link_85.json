        "text": "Dendrometers offer a useful tool for long-term, high-resolution monitoring of tree responses to environmental fluctuations and climate change. Here, we analyze a 4-year dendrometer dataset (2014-17) on European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), co-occuring in a mixed broadleaved forest in northeastern Germany. In our analyses, we focus both on seasonal growth dynamics as well as on the environmental forcing of daily stem-size variations. Over the study period with contrasting weather conditions, we observed species- and year-specific differences in growth phenology (i.e., growth onset, cessation and duration). Oak was characterized by early growth onset and long growth duration in all years as compared with beech and hornbeam. The analysis on the environmental forcing of daily stem dynamics revealed, however, highly similar responses for the studied species, with current-day vapor pressure deficit and sunshine d...\n\nStudies of intra-annual growth are particularly useful for understanding tree growth because of their high temporal resolution. This study was performed in Austria and included hourly band dendrometer data of 244 annual tree recordings from six tree species ( (L.) Karst., L., Mill., Mill., L., spp. ( (Matt.) Liebl., L.) sampled on five sites with contrasting site conditions in pure and mixed stands and on trees of different social position. Measurements encompassed 1â7 years. Cumulative diameter increment was modelled by logistic mixed-effects models with random effects at the tree and year level. The results showed large differences in seasonal growth patterns between sites, with a clearly shorter growing season at the drier sites. Species specific response on dry sites could be linked to drought characteristics, whereas response on more humid sites was related to light requirements or successional status. The deciduous trees showed earlier growth culmination and shorter gr...\n\nTree growth is expected to be responsive to climatic drivers across a spectrum of temporal scales, ranging from yearly growth to daily water use and photosynthesis. Automatic dendrometers offer the potential to provide continuous high-resolution measurements of tree radius changes. The signal recorded contains three components: (1) a long-term seasonal growth component, (2) a mid-term component representing swelling after rainfall and subsequent drying and (3) daily cycles of water-uptake related to tree transpiration. For 91 trees at 4 sites (Picea abies: 58, Pinus cembra: 17, Fagus sylvatica: 14, Pinus sylvestris: 2) monitored in Austria between 2012 and 2015, we simultaneously modelled these three processes using a hierarchical nonlinear mixed-effects model represented by two logistic growth curves. The focus was on the mid-term and daily component, and therefore long-term growth that is typically modelled by including tree size, competition or site variables was represented by r..."
