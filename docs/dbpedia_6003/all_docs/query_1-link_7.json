        "text": "I am thinking of booking a two week holiday near the black forest area of Germany last week of july 1st week of august,does anybody know what the general weather is like for this time off year in this area? i have looked in a couple of brochures and this apparently it is the sunniest? part of Germany.\n\noften scorchio, like this year when I was there, on the other hand it can be cold, wet & windy like last year. Same week in August.\n\nBlack Forest climate is as reliable and predictable as in Wales\n\nWhat won't change is how busy it will be during those 2 weeks.\n\nGo with a free and easy attitude and if one spot is a bit busy then move elsewhere. Perhaps cross the Rhine into the Vosges area of France, which might be a little less busy.\n\nIt should be pretty good, we have been twice in September and it has been warm, it is a the wine growing region so I guess that should mean sunny?\n\nThis is a great value place to stop in the heart of the area:\n\nhttp://www.pension-williams.com/\n\nI am booked in here for a few nights next year (for the third year running)\n\nTwo weeks is also plenty of time as the area is not all that large, handy as it can all be reached from one location, you could also zip to the Harz mountains for a couple of days, or the Vosges.\n\nMore info from my last visit:\n\nhttp://www.ukgser.com/forums/showthread.php?t=249110\n\nI'd agree with the 35-40 degrees generally but there was 20 odd degrees and horrendous rain from Offenburg to the Dutch border on the last Saturday in July this year...\n\nWhaaaaat!\n\n35-40C would be highly exceptional - it probably got that hot during the hot part of 2003, but not since.\n\n23C-27C would be much more usual, occasionally 30C, rarely more.\n\nThunderstorms are a feature of Aug-Sep in this part of the world and they can be very severe\n\nWeather underground site for historical data.\n\nWhat will the weather be like?\n\nWhat would you tell a visitor from Germany to your home town about the weather in late July / early August? Generally good, I guess? Well, it will be much the same in the Black Forrest, maybe quite a bit better if a high pressure system sits over Europe.\n\nOf course it can rain (and hard).... Expect the best, prepare for the worste. You will be unlucky if it snows.\n\noften scorchio, like this year when I was there, on the other hand it can be cold, wet & windy like last year.

Perhaps cross the Rhine into the Vosges area of France, which might be a little less busy.\n\nyep agree with this, last june it was hot dry and sunny....glorious....previous years we have had cold,rain and really slippy roads where drizzle and debris mix!\n\nIt is a forest area at altitude, so climate can be unpredictable...cant beleive it is the sunniest area of germany....?\n\nWhaaaaat!\n\n35-40C would be highly exceptional - it probably got that hot during the hot part of 2003, but not since.\n\n23C-27C would be much more usual, occasionally 30C, rarely more.\n\nStolzy - using Wunderground, in July it reached 37.4C at Lahr. Airport info, not GS dash after left out in the sun.\n\nIt was hot in Germany. Dunno where you were only getting 23-27...\n\nWhaaaaat!\n\n35-40C would be highly exceptional - it probably got that hot during the hot part of 2003, but not since.\n\n23C-27C would be much more usual, occasionally 30C, rarely more.\n\nThunderstorms are a feature of Aug-Sep in this part of the world and they can be very severe\n\nObviously you where not in Germany in July 2010 where the temperatures did reach up to 40C.(Hein Gericke Underwear was a lifesaver by the way worked brillantly keeping the Gear sticking to your Skin\n\nObviously you where not in Germany in July 2010 where the temperatures did reach up to 40C.\n\nI was and I live less than 100 miles from Freiburg and yes it was hot, but I doubt it was 40C (people always exaggerate temperatures, especially when they come from cooler climates).\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Freiburg (the lowest and therefore likely hottest part of the Black Forest) was 39C in 2003.\n\nNot to say that a local temperature may not have been hotter, but a temperature hotter than the hottest ever recorded is likely to be a very, very rare event.\n\nAverage max daytime temp in Freiburg in July is 24C.\n\nDunno where you were only getting 23-27...\n\nMet office stats via BBC weather page for Freiburg\n\nI was and I live less than 100 miles from Freiburg and yes it was hot, but I doubt it was 40C (people always exaggerate temperatures, especially when they come from cooler climates).\n\nThe highest recorded temperature in Freiburg (the lowest and therefore likely hottest part of the Black Forest) was 39C in 2003.\n\nNot to say that a local temperature may not have been hotter, but a temperature hotter than the hottest ever recorded is likely to be a very, very rare event.\n\nAverage max daytime temp in Freiburg in July is 24C.\n\nMet office stats via BBC weather page for Freiburg\n\nHallo Stolzy,I do not come from Alaska infact if I am not in Cumberland iam, in the Rhineland (Lahnstein)where i was borne and spent most Sommers there,around 35C is quiet normal around there in Midsummer.Happy new Year to you anyhow and to everybody else a sunny Biking Season.\n\nIn mid september 2009 we had what was easily high 20's in Seebach which I believe is at about 500m, every day was like that Blue Skies and very hot.\n\nLast year we where there for a couple of days in early September and on the way there from the Alps we rode the length of the B500 in wonderful weather, then we had two days of cloudy / wet weather.\n\nLike most of Europe the weather changes, June has most daylight but apart from that the rest is a bit of a lottery, from May - September is summer, July and August are probably hottest, I prefer june and September to avoid the crowds and school holiday prices.\n\nIn 2008 we had a lot of wet weather in the Pyrenees (after a 3 week heatwave we just timed it wrong) in 2009 we had great weather in the Black Forest (but had rain in France on way in and out) last year in the Alps and Black Forest we had - Mixed / Mainly Wet / Mixed / Hot & Sunny / Mixed / Mainly Wet / Hot & Sunny / Sunny / Hot & Sunny / Hot & Sunny / Mixed / Very Wet / Mixed - I expect similar this year."
