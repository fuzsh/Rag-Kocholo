        "meta_description": "The Paris Climate Agreement requires a rapid and efficient shift to renewable energies and a decarbonization of the energy system. Combined heat and power provision from biomass is one way to efficiently provide renewable heat. Despite this, many bioenergy plants in Germany are mainly used to generate electricity and the provision of externally usable heat still has untapped potential. In this study, we investigated gross quantities as well as the economically viable potential of Germany’s current bioenergy plant stock in supplying renewable heat. We used a top-down GIS modeling approach to spatially and explicitly assess the heat demand of three different categories of heat sinks at sub-municipal level. These included residential, commercial, and industrial areas, as well as large individual heat consumers. We then calculated the plant-specific heat sales potential for two different district heating network options. In addition, we developed a method for assessing the economic efficiency of the previously identified technical heat sales volume for a set of 20 different clusters of bioenergy plants. The results show that about 50% of the bioenergy plants have potential heat consumers in their immediate proximity. The overall technical heat sales potential for all three categories totals around 150 TWhth/a. However, this potential is not evenly distributed throughout Germany. Certain regions appear to be more favorable for investing in district heating networks powered by heat from biomass. The economically viable heat sales potential related to electrical energy generation ranges from − 0.128 to 0.160 €/kWhth. We concluded that, under certain conditions such as location or supply and demand structure, German bioenergy plants have the potential to provide a significant share to renewable energies in the heating sector. In addition, the heat sales potential is highly relevant for plant operators as the importance of heat as a business segment is set to increase. Furthermore, bioenergy plants could contribute 2.1% (16.3 TWhth/a) to the total demand for space heating in Germany (765 TWhth/a) when considering certain technical and economic constraints.",

        "text": "Modeling scheme\n\nIn order to determine the technical heat sales potential (tHSP) for each plant individually, it is necessary to identify suitable heat sinks close to the respective plant. Consequently, the tHSP is defined as the heat demand of suitable heat sinks within a defined maximum distance to the respective BEP. While spatial information on BEPs is available through the bioenergy plant database of the German Biomass Research Centre (DBFZ) [18], the spatially explicit heat demand related to these plants is missing and needs to be identified. The modeling consisted of two separate steps. First, we modeled the heat demand at a spatial resolution below the municipal level. For the residential sector, this means the level of individual residential blocks and for the industrial sector the level of industrial and commercial areas as recorded in the ATKIS Basis Digital Landscape Model (DLM) [19]. The ATKIS Basis DLM offers a description of these topographic elements in vector data format for all of Germany on a scale of 1:25,000 [19]. For the LIHC, this means their exact geographical location. In a second step, we calculated the tHSP for each plant individually and concluded the overall tHSP.\n\nBased on the tHSP, we developed an estimation approach to assess the economically viable heat sales potential (eHSP, see Fig. 5). The basic method for calculating tHSP as well as the input data used is illustrated in Fig. 1.\n\nMost of the data used in the model is publicly available. The content of the respective datasets, their origin and the latest update are listed in Table 1. Only the municipal level heat demand (later referred to as “IZES heat demand”) and the DBFZ BEP database contain internal data of the respective institutions and are therefore not publicly available.\n\nModeling the heat demand at a high spatial resolution\n\nHeat is required and consumed in three different sectors: residential, TCS, and industrial. As the German Environment Agency states, heat in the residential and TCS sectors is primarily required for space heating, while the industrial sector requires the largest share for process heat [1]. Consequently, the methods for determining the total heat demand per sector and for its spatial modeling vary.\n\nFor the residential, TCS and industrial sectors, we followed a top-down modeling approach as described by Fleiter et al. and applied by Baur et al. [3, 17]. The basic principle of this approach is to disaggregate the heat demand from the existing aggregated level into smaller spatial units. In our case, we used data on the heat demand per sector for each municipality, calculated by Baur et al. [20], and allocated it to the residential areas and the commercial and/or industrial areas of each community.\n\nWe simultaneously applied a bottom-up approach for LIHCs, such as hospitals, commercial greenhouses, schools, and public outdoor swimming pools, which are particularly suitable for DHNs fueled by heat generated from biomass [26]. This means that we calculated their yearly heat demand on the basis of an object-specific key such as kWhtha/bed (hospitals), kWhtha/student (schools), kWhtha/m2 (commercial greenhouses), and kWhtha/m2 water surface (public outdoor swimming pools).\n\nResidential sector\n\nThe heat demand of residential units on a municipal level was assessed using building stock grouped by building type (single family dwelling, townhouse, etc.), year of construction, and municipality. This data was extracted from the 2011 census database [27]. We multiplied the number of buildings, divided into building class and municipality, by the corresponding heat demand in kWhth/a and respective residential unit, derived from the German building typology of IWU 2003 [28]. Additionally, we took an average annual domestic hot water demand of 500 kWhth per capita into account, based on the municipal population on December 31, 2011 [27]. The overall methodology of assessing the heat demand is discussed in more detail in Baur et al. [20].\n\nWithin the ATKIS Basis DLM, the utilization of a given area is defined by unique codes related to object type. Subsequently, we selected all objects that are assigned to the residential sector including the object types 2102 (dwelling), 2111 (residential area), and 2113 (area of mixed use). These objects were then labeled as residential area objects (RAO) and are hereinafter referred to as such. All other objects (e.g., parks, bodies of water, train tracks, and stations) were no longer considered in the model and were therefore removed from our analysis. We then calculated the residential area factor (RAF), which represents the share of each individual RAO in the total residential area of the municipality, with\n\n$$ RAF=\\frac{\\ {A}_{\\mathrm{RAO}}}{A_{\\mathrm{total}\\ \\mathrm{residential}\\ \\mathrm{area}}\\ } $$\n\n(1)\n\nwhere RAF is the residential area factor, RAO is the residential area object, and A is the area (m2).\n\nSince the heat demand in the residential sector also depends on the number of inhabitants per area, it was necessary to determine the number of inhabitants for each RAO individually. To do so, we used population data from the 2011 census which is available in a nationwide grid with raster cell sizes of 100 m × 100 mFootnote 2 [25]. The geodata for the grid is provided by the German Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy (BKG) [22]. We intersected the RAOs with the population data and calculated the population figures per RAOFootnote 3. Subsequently, we determined the population factor (PF), which is the ratio of any given RAO to the municipality’s total population with\n\n$$ PF=\\frac{\\ \\mathrm{Inhabitants}\\ \\mathrm{per}\\ \\mathrm{RAO}}{\\mathrm{Inhabitants}\\ \\mathrm{of}\\ \\mathrm{municipality}} $$\n\n(2)\n\nwhere PF is the population factor and RAO is the residential area object.\n\nIn the next step, we calculated the RAO-specific heat demand using the heat demand per municipality provided by IZES in combination with the previously introduced factors RAF and PF. For RAOs containing information on the number of inhabitants, the specific heat demand (Q) is\n\n$$ {Q}_{\\mathrm{RAO}}={Q}_{\\mathrm{municipality}}\\times PF $$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Q is the heat demand (GWhth/a), PFis the population factor, and RAO is the residential area object.\n\nFor RAOs with missing information on the number of inhabitants it is\n\n$$ {Q}_{RAO}={Q}_{municipality}\\ast RAF $$\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Q is the heat demand (GWhth/a), PF is the residential area factor, and RAO is the residential area object.\n\nFinally, the heat density (kWhth/m2a) was determined for each RAO by dividing the RAO-specific heat demand (GWhth/a) by its area.\n\n$$ {HD}_{RAO}=\\left(\\frac{Q_{RAO}}{A_{RAO}}\\right) $$\n\n(5)\n\nwhere HD is the heat density (kWhth/m2a), Q is the heat demand (kWhth/a), A is the area (m2), and RAO is the residential area object.\n\nThe result is a dataset for the whole of Germany with very detailed spatial information on the heat demand and heat density of residential areas.\n\nTCS and industrial sector\n\nThe heat demand of the industrial sector on a district level (NUTS 3) was estimated by multiplying the number of employees in the manufacturing sectorFootnote 4 by the corresponding average heat demand per employee and industry derived from the national statistic on industrial energy demand [31, 32]. Due to the lack of corresponding data for the TCS sector, we determined the heat demand of the TCS sector by using the gross added values of the related economic sectorsFootnote 5 [33]. They were multiplied by the average heat demand of the corresponding sectors derived from the reference scenario, which is described by Kirchner et al. [34]. In order to also determine the heat demand of both the TCS and industrial sector on a municipal level (LAU 2), we multiplied the calculated heat demands by the ratio of the number of employees at a municipal and district level [35].\n\nAs with the residential sector, the DLM was the basis for modeling the heat demand for the TCS and industrial sectors. Here, we used the object types “Industrial and commercial area” (2112) and “Area with special functional characteristics” (2114). We recognized that the DLM alone is only partially suitable for spatially modeling the heat demand of industrial and TCS areas. There are numerous objects (areas) assigned in the classification 2112 that have not been developed, as well as objects which do not have actual heat demand, like landfills or substations. To exclude such areas from the assessment, we added the OpenStreetMap (OSM) buildings dataset to the model [24]. During the modeling process, we only considered the DLM objects which intersect with the OSM buildings dataset. We then created new area objects by calculating minimum boundary polygons around the buildings inside the objects classified as 2112 and 2114 and labeled them as “TCS area objects.” Analogous to the residential sector, we then assessed an area factor for those TCS areas and assigned them their object-specific heat demand (GWhth/a) and heat density (kWhth/m2a).\n\nThe quality of the DLM dataset varies strongly for objects within object type 2112. Only the federal states of Brandenburg, Berlin, Saarland and Hamburg provide detailed information about how an area is actually used, e.g., for industrial purposes or for commercial functions like trade or storage. We were only able to distinguish between the heat demand for the industrial sector and the TCS sector in these states. Since no distinction could be made in the other states, we used the combined heat demand of the industrial and the TCS sector to model the heat demand of TCS areas.\n\nLarge individual heat consumers\n\nWe identified four categories of LIHC which are particularly suited for DHNs fueled by heat generated from biomass: schools, hospitals, public outdoor swimming pools, and commercial greenhouses [26]. For the categories “schools” and “hospitals,” we used the POI-Bund Dataset which contains both spatial and content-related information on schools and hospitals such as the number of students per school or the number of beds per hospital [23].\n\nFor the category “public outdoor swimming pools,” we used the DLM which contains outdoor swimming pools (object type 2345). The values for heat demand per square meter of water surface vary in the literature between 280 kWhth/m2a and 700 kWhth/m2a [36, 37]. In order to define an appropriate value for our model, we evaluated municipal energy reports on ten public outdoor swimming pools and used the mean value of 435Footnote 6 kWhth/m2a.\n\nThe spatial information for the category “greenhouses” has been extracted from the OpenStreetMap buildings dataset. As this dataset does not contain any information on whether a greenhouse is used commercially, we have set the threshold of 100 m2 floor spaceFootnote 7 as an indicator for this.\n\nThe heat demand for each object of those four categories was determined on the basis of object-specific key figures and object-specific reference units. Those key figures and their respective reference units are shown in Table 2. This enabled us to model the heat demand for a total of 55,465 individual objects.\n\nAssessment of the BEP-specific heat sales potential\n\nTo determine the BEP-specific heat supply potentials, we looked at two different options on how BEPs can feed heat into a potential DHN. The spatial and technical information needed to do this was taken from the DBFZ bioenergy plant database. This database is continuously updated and contains detailed information on BEPs in Germany. It is based on information which the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur, BNetzA) publishes on BEPs as part of the German Renewable Energy Act (Erneuerbare Energien Gesetz (EEG)) remuneration scheme and explained in more detail in Scheftelowitz et al. [18]. It is not possible to derive from the data whether a BEP already feeds into a DHN or not. For the following analyses, this aspect is not taken into consideration. It is also not possible to determine from the BEP database whether a BEP is actually a production unit or if it is a satellite CHPU which cannot be operated independently of its production unit. For this reason, all investigated BEPs are considered to be production units, an assumption which distorts the actual situation.\n\nDistance-related heat supply scenarios\n\nTo determine the plant-specific tHSP, we looked at two different design options for DHNs: A and B. These are defined as follows: in Option A the heat produced at the BEP site is transported to the consumers via a directly connected local heating network, whereas in Option B biogas is transported via a raw biogas pipeline to a CHPU located directly on the site of the heat sink and the DHN commences at this point. Since the way heat is transported in Option A involves losses of up to 10%, the heat sink must be located in the immediate vicinity of the BEP [48]. The minimum overall heat density for a DHN in year-round operation is defined by the Quality Management (QM) system of the German/Swiss initiative “QM Holzheizwerke” as being 2 MWh/line meter and year [48]. In a comparable calculation for a region in Rhineland-Palatinate made in 2010, IZES and the Institut für Energie- und Umweltforschung (ifeu) [49] stated that there should be a heat sink within a radius of 1000 m around a BEP to reach this value. Daniel et al. [50] found a higher figure for the whole grid and concluded that losses must not exceed 20% to ensure sufficient profitability. Losses up to this value occur with total grid lengths of between 1000 m and 5000 m and depend on the capacity of the respective CHPU [50]. Taking this assumption into account, we defined for our model a maximum distance of 1500 m between the BEP and the heat sink. This option is applicable for all BEPs.\n\nOption B is applicable for biogas plants only. Since biogas can be transported over longer distances with only minor losses, the distance between the heat source and heat sink can be greater for this option. Obviously, this distance depends again on the capacity of the installation. IZES and ifeu [49] reported that BEPs with an installed capacity of 500 kWel can reach a distance of up to 5000 m for raw biogas pipelines without losing their economic feasibility [49]. In our case, we followed the assumption of this maximum distance between BEP and heat sink (5000 m) even though the mean value of the installed capacity of biogas plants throughout Germany is only 435 kWel [51]. A visual illustration of the two options for district heating networks under consideration is provided in Fig. 2.\n\nTo identify the plant-specific heat sales potential, we then used the spatial information on BEPs from the DBFZ bioenergy plant database and conducted a spatial query into whether there are suitable heat sinks at the respective distances. For residential areas and TCS areas, we defined that the minimum heat densityFootnote 8 of the nearest heat sink has to be higher than 50 kWhth/m2 × aFootnote 9 in order to be suitable for the DHN design options presented above. For the LIHCs, we did not define such a precondition, but instead considered the total heat demand of the respective LIHC.\n\nCategorizing the heat supply potential using line density modeling\n\nSo far in the spatial modeling approach, all heat sinks with a corresponding heat density of 50 kWhth/m2a in the vicinity of the respective BEP are initially selected as potential heat sinks. However, the gross heat demand (in GWhth/a) of the heat sink can be insufficient for achieving an economically viable DHN. Therefore, the spatial model required enhancement. To do this, we introduced the line density factor LDF. This factor represents the ratio of the heat demand of a heat sink in relation to the total potential network length and the funding conditions of the German Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) for DHNs in GermanyFootnote 10 and was calculated as follows:\n\n$$ LDF=\\left(\\frac{Q_{RAO}}{D\\times NLF}\\right)\\times 500\\ kWh/a $$\n\n(6)\n\nwhere LDF is the line density factor, Q is the heat demand (kWhth/a), D is the linear distance bioenergy plant-heat sink (m), NLF is the network length factor, and RAO is the residential area object.\n\nWe assumed that if the annual heat demand of a given heat sink was unable to generate the required heat turnover of 500 kWhth per line meter [53], it was highly unlikely that a DHN would be built. This much more simplified method is a suitable way to eliminate inadequate heat sinks from the model. Values for a line density factor below 1 indicate that the annual heat turnover of a potential DHN would be too low. All heat sinks with a line density factor < 1 were therefore excluded from the model, which subsequently only contained heat sinks suitable for DHNs.\n\nIn order to determine the line density factor, it is necessary to know the total length of the DHN. Within the GIS model, however, only linear distances from the heat source to the potential first consumer are known. The total network length must be estimated. For this purpose, we introduced the network length factor NLF. It describes the ratio of the total network length of a DHN to the distance between the heat source (the BEP) and the initial heat consumer and was calculated using Formula 7.\n\n$$ NLF=\\frac{L_{tot.}}{D} $$\n\n(7)\n\nwhere NLF is the network length factor, Ltot.. is the total network length (m), and D is the linear distance bioenergy plant to heat sink (m).\n\nThe NLF had to be assessed empirically. For this purpose, we analyzed 20 existing biomass-fueled DHNs for which the total network length is known [54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67]. We measured the distance between the heat-generating plant and the potential first consumer of these DHNs and calculated the NLF. Our data on the respective DHNs only includes cases where the distance between the plant and the first consumer is less than 500 m. For these systems, the median value of the NLF is 26.1.Footnote 11 For systems where there is a distance > 500 m between the heat source and the initial consumer, which occurs in our GIS data, the NLF was determined with the corresponding degression (see Fig. 3).\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the correction process described above. If heat sink 1 is located within the search radius of 1500 m around a BEP and has a heat demand of 1.9 GWhth/a then, to develop the area, the heating network would have to be 6500 m long (assumption). However, to receive financial support, an annual heat turnover of at least 3.25 GWhth (6500 m × 500 kWhth/a = 3,250,000 kWhth/m×a) is required. Heat sink 1 does not have a sufficient heat demand to operate the DHN economically and can therefore not be considered suitable for a local heating network (line density factor < 1). Heat sinks 2 and 3, on the other hand, have a sufficient heat demand and can therefore be considered for a DHN (line density factor > 1).\n\nEconomic viability of heat sales potential\n\nThis section presents the methodology used for assessing the economic heat sales potential (eHSP), since a second objective of this study was to evaluate the economic viability of the specific heat supply potential of the current German BEP stock. Here, the same dataset for BEPs was used as shown in Table 1.\n\nEven though this study aimed to gain initial insights into the market potential of heat as a by-product of electricity generation, a full techno-economic feasibility assessment was not within the scope of our study. In our approach, economic viability depends on the potential of heat sales (demand/supply) and the associated estimated costs for heat distribution infrastructure (pipelines, peak load boilers, and storage facilities) as well as the earnings from heat sales.\n\nEvaluation scheme and main assumptions\n\nIn order to assess the eHSP, we developed an evaluation scheme that consisted of four main steps (Fig. 5). We first established individual BEP-heat sink relationships (Step 1) and then derived relevant indicators based on plant-specific data (Step 2). Before transferring all the information onto a bigger scale (Step 3), we grouped all the individual BEPs into clusters according to their EEG remuneration key. This enabled us to obtain the desired overview of the German BEP stock without compromising plant-specific data and provided the basis for the final economic assessment (Step 4).\n\nIn addition to the information on location and the related potential heat demand from spatial heat demand modeling (see above), we used energy-related BEP inventory data (Table 3) obtained from two databases: publicly available data published by the German Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) and datasets retrieved from annual plant operator surveys by the DBFZ (see [51]).\n\nIn this approach, we assumed four factors to be determinant for the economic viability of heat sales from BEPs (Table 4). Whereas the distance between the heat sink and the BEP (1), the type of heat sink (2) and the heat supply-demand ratio (3) all govern the choice and size of the heat distribution infrastructure (pipelines, peak-load boilers, and storage facilities), the heat market price (4) ultimately determines income from heat sales. Other factors (e.g., local conditions underground which influence the excavation costs or regional differences between temperature profiles) may also have an influence on economic viability but their consideration would go far beyond the scope of this study.\n\nSteps 1-3: assessment indicators\n\nIn the first step of this evaluation scheme (Fig. 5), we used the spatial and energy-related information (derived from the above presented assessment of tHSP) to establish single BEP-heat sink relationships. We assumed specific heat delivery costs would decrease (economies of scale) as potential heat demand increased. Therefore, we linked each BEP to a single heat sink within a radius of 1500 m (Option A of the DHN design options) that had the highest potential heat demand (see Fig. 4 for an illustration). Since we expected that heat distribution costs would significantly affect economic viability, we excluded the option of exploring a larger radius or possible connections between multiple producers and consumers We deliberately excluded biogas plants with potential heat sinks within a radius of 1500-5000 m and the construction of a raw biogas pipeline from this assessment (Option B of the previously described DHN design options). Also, our methodology is only suitable for a 1:1 ratio between BEP and heat sinks, so we were unable to incorporate cross-linked networks.\n\nWe operationalized the BEP-heat sink relationship by introducing the “Q-factor” (FQ) which is heat demand (Qsnk) divided by net heat production (Qsrc) (Formula 8). Furthermore, we decided to use this indicator as a main reference point for the economic assessment.\n\n$$ \\mathrm{FQ}=\\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{snk}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{src}}} $$\n\n(8)\n\nwhere FQ is the heat source-sink-ratio, Qsnk is the heat demand of a heat sink (GWhth/a), and Qsrc is the net heat production of BEP (GWhth/a).\n\nTo refine this assessment, we considered seasonal fluctuation in heat demand depending on the characteristics of the type of heat sink (TyHS). Here, we distinguished between three TyHS for which we created synthetic heat load profiles according to a methodology that was presented by [68] (Table 5). For reasons of simplicity, we allocated the annual heat demand over the course of a year (8760 h) and decided not to create regionally explicit heat load profiles but to use only one climate reference dataset (weather station in Potsdam [69]).\n\nIn the second step of the evaluation scheme (Fig. 5), we extended the plant-specific data and derived other indicators that influence the economic viability of heat sales, i.e., the maximum cogeneration utilization rate (CURmax) and a heat pipe capacity factor (Ftk).\n\nThe maximum cogeneration utilization rate (CURmax) indicates how much of the BEP’s gross heat generation could be sold on the market, taking into account a seasonal fluctuation in heat demand. For reasons of simplicity, we do not consider flexible operation of BEPs but assume 24-h operations that result in a constant heat supply at full capacity (net heat production) throughout the year. When both power and heat have to be considered at a temporal resolution, the analysis becomes much more complex. We focused on varying heat demands and used heat load profiles, we had generated previously (Table 5) to calculate the CURmax for each TyHS and for the FQ at intervals of 0.1 until a CURmax of nearly 100% was reached (see Fig. 6).\n\nFurthermore, we assumed that the investment costs of heat pipelines depend not only on their length but also on their diameter (heat transmission capacity). When heat storage facilities (HST) and bio-fueled peak load boilers (PLB) were used to supplement cogeneration and maintain heat supply, we also needed to adjust the heat pipeline diameter accordingly. Therefore, we introduced a heat pipe capacity factor (Ftk), defined as the ratio of net heat supply to annual peak loads as observed in the generated load profiles (Table 5).\n\nIn the third step of the evaluation scheme (Fig. 5), we transferred the single-source sink-related data to the cluster level by aggregating the previously gathered information (FQ, CURmax, Ftk) and the cluster-related information (Table 3). To do this, we divided each cluster into five groups each of which represented 20% of the BEPs in the respective cluster (quintiles) and which referred to equally sized classes of FQ. The FQ values assigned to each previous BEP-heat sink pair (Formula 8) were used for this statistical division. Whereas quintile 1 represents the 20% of BEPs with the smallest FQ values, quintile 5 represents the 20% of BEPs with the largest FQ values. Using this approach, we then assigned each BEP-heat sink pair to a cluster quintile and calculated the arithmetic mean of the CURmax and Ftk.\n\nStep 4: economic assessment\n\nIn the fourth and final step of the evaluation scheme (Fig. 5), we assessed the economic heat sales potential (eHSP) of German BEPs for all cluster quintiles based on the previously generated dataset. The remainder of this section will describe how we calculated the capital expenditures (CAPEX) for the heat distribution infrastructure and how we related these costs to expected earnings from heat sales.\n\nThe CAPEX in this assessment included investment costs such as annuities for heat pipelines, peak load boilers (PLB), and heat storage facilities (HST). For all cost calculations, we fixed the interest rate at 5% and assumed no price increase during a depreciation period of 15 years for PLBs and HSTs, and 25 years for heat pipelines. As a requirement for heat sales from BEPs, we first calculated the CAPEX for heat pipelines for all BEP-heat sink pairs. Then, we defined the PLBs and HSTs to those pairs that fulfilled a specific set of criteria (Table 6) and calculated the additional CAPEX from using them (including fuel costs for PLB). Finally, we calculated the mean CAPEX for each BEP cluster quintile and added the expected earnings from heat sales. Hence, we determined the economic viability of heat sales from German BEPs, including additional earnings from using PLBs and HSTs.\n\nTo calculate the CAPEX for heat pipelines (Cpipe), we derived specific pipeline costs and multiplied them by the length of the heat pipelines required to connect each BEP with a heat sink (Formula 9). We introduced a correction factor (CF) to account for the fact that a heat pipeline will need to deviate from a direct line in order to overcome infrastructural barriers like residential areas, roads, or rail lines. We multiplied this CF by the distance between each BEP and heat sink to derive the required pipeline length (Formula 9). However, we did not consider the local distribution and transmission infrastructure that would be required, e.g., for district heating in residential areas [70].\n\n$$ {L}_{\\mathrm{T}}=D\\times CF $$\n\n(9)\n\nwhere LT is the length of a heat pipeline that is equal to the distance between a BEP-heat sink pair (Step 1, Fig. 5) multiplied by a correction factor (CF). CF is equal to the square root of 2 which results from applying the Pythagorean theorem. Streamlining deviations, we divided the alternative way (the sum of the two legs of a right-angled triangle) by the direct distance between the BEP and heat sink (hypotenuse).\n\n$$ {C}_{\\mathrm{pipe}}=\\left({C}_{\\mathrm{T}}+{C}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\right)\\times {L}_{\\mathrm{T}} $$\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Cpipe is the cost of the heat pipeline calculated for each BEP-heat sink pair (Step 1, Fig. 5). CT is the cost of the heat pipelines per meter (as a function of Pth and Ftk). Cc represents other construction-related costs per meter (underground work and planning), and LT is the length of heat pipeline (m).\n\nServing peak loads or storing heat in times of low demand might be economically reasonable if the expected additional earnings outweigh the additional CAPEX for HSTs and PLBs (including fuel costs for a PLB). Furthermore, the use of HSTs and PLBs would have an impact on the CAPEX for heat pipelines, affecting the required heat transmission capacity (diameter). We therefore established a set of rules for three different heat marketing concepts based on the level of FQ (Table 6). According to these rules, we decided whether to use peak load boilers (PLB) and/or heat storage (HST) for each BEP-heat sink pair and adjusted the required heat pipeline capacity accordingly.\n\nFollowing a “full supply” marketing concept, we used HST and PLB and placed them close to the source (here the BEP). By adapting the pipeline capacity, all peak loads of heat could be potentially served via the heat pipeline (Ftk×Pth). The “basic supply” marketing concept differs as it prescribes only the use of an HST. Due to periods of peak demand, heat pipelines should be able to transport heat produced by the BEP and discharge the capacity of the storage. We therefore proposed that a heat pipeline’s capacity should be double the value of the BEP’s thermal capacity (Ftk = 2) while both the charge and discharge rates are equal to the BEP heat capacity. The “full feed-in” option assumes there is no need for a PLB or HST so that we based the transmission capacity of the pipelines solely to the BEP’s capacity (Ftk = 1).\n\nIn addition to considering the use of PLB and HST for the “full supply” and “basic supply” concepts, we optimized their size aiming to find the most cost-efficient combination of both. For this purpose, we used a cost function (Formula 12) that builds upon an optimization approach which suggests that the investment costs for HST and PLB depend on their volume and power capacity [71].\n\nThe optimization approach for an ideal combination of PLB and HST is described in [71]. Here, we only accounted for the different heat load profiles for each quintile in every cluster (based on the previous TyHS and CURmax) in order to find minimum overall costs.\n\n$$ {C}_{\\mathrm{opt}.}=f(V)+f(P)+\\left({C}_{\\mathrm{fuel}}-{C}_{\\mathrm{h}@\\mathrm{POS}}\\right)\\times {P}_{th}\\to \\mathit{\\min} $$\n\n(12)\n\nwhere Copt. is the cost optimum, f(V) and f(P) are functions of the CAPEX for HSTs and PLBs [71] and Pth is a cluster’s power capacity (see Table 3), Cfuel represents fuel costs and Ch@POS is the heat price at the point of sale. For simplification purposes, we fixed the potential heat losses from heat storage at a value of 10%, the PLB efficiency (η) at 85%, the Ch@POS at 50 €/MWhth and the Cfuel at 30 €/MWhth.\n\nWe are aware of the fact that we created an inherent incentive to use PLB (Ch@POS > Cfuel) and real prices for heat would be influenced by many factors such as the locality, market characteristics, and the type of heat sink. For instance, factors that affect local demand for heat from BEPs include existing access to the gas grid, availability (and abundance) of solid biogenic fuel (from wood), and a fossil-fueled heat source that is already connected to existing heat pipelines. However, due to the scope of this study, we did not specify and adjust the calculations to these factors. Finally, we determined the economic heat sales potential (eHSP) from German BEPs for all the cluster quintiles by calculating the annual heat sales potential in terms of heat earnings (Esale) (Formula 13) minus the financial expenditure for heat distribution (PLB, HST, and heat pipelines) (Formula 14).\n\n$$ {E}_{\\mathrm{sale}}={C}_{\\mathrm{h}@\\mathrm{POS}}\\times {W}_{\\mathrm{th}}\\times {\\mathrm{CUR}}_{\\mathrm{max}} $$\n\n(13)\n\nwhere Esale is the annual heat earnings (€), Ch@POS is the price of heat at the point of sale fixed at 50 €/MWhth, Wth is the net heat production (Table 3), and CURmax is the maximum cogeneration utilization rate for each BEP cluster quintile.\n\n$$ \\mathrm{eHSP}={E}_{\\mathrm{sale}}-{C}_{\\mathrm{opt}}-{C}_{\\mathrm{pipe}} $$\n\n(14)\n\nwhere eHSP is the economically viable heat sales potential, Esale is the annual heat earnings (€), Copt. is the cost optimum, and Cpipe is the cost of heat pipeline from BEP to heat sink (€)."
