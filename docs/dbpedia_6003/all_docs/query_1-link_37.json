The average temperature ranges from about 74°F (23°C) in July to 28°F (-2°C) in January, but there have been some years when temperatures have gone below 0°F (-15°C) or above 95°F (35°C). If you are not sure when to come visit, read on.\n\nSpring can be a good season for visiting. Be prepared for rain.\n\nSummer is the ideal time to visit if you like to spend most of your day outside. We have hot summer days and warm nights, many times a thunderstorm in the afternoon or evening. Summer storms are pretty frequent, heavy and short, with the months June through August seeing the most precipitation.\n\nFall is a good time to come visit. The weather is cooler, but usually still pretty nice. Not hot, but warm days. You need to be prepared for rain. Fall is the best time for a Winery our Harvest Tour. It’s a great time to attend wine festivals or other traditional festivities. It’s still a good time for mountain biking, nordic walking and other outdoor activities.\n\nWinter. We can get a lot of snow in the Black Forest. If you are into winter sports, this is the time to come visit. The Black Forest offers cross-country and downhill skiing. You can attend a major sporting competition (ski jumping), or you can see a dog sled race or go snow shoeing or snowboarding.\n\nWe do offer tours year-round.Once you know your approximate date of arrival get in touch with us and we will figure out your options."
