        "text": "Economy\n\nGermany has the largest economy in Europe and one of the largest economies in the world. It has long been an industrial powerhouse and a leading exporter of manufactured goods. Services form the largest sector of the economy.\n\nThe country has what it calls a social market economy. This economic system is based on free-market capitalism but incorporates more government regulation, in an attempt to ensure fairness in the marketplace, to protect workers, and to avoid very large inequalities. Germany’s extensive system of social services and welfare benefits provides a “social safety net” for all its citizens. The government also subsidizes certain industries and shares with industry the costs of research and development.\n\nThis social market system was first established by West Germany when Germany was divided. Although the German economy was severely damaged in World War II, the economy of West Germany was rapidly rebuilt after the war. Its remarkable growth became known as the “economic miracle.” By 1960 West Germany had one of the strongest economies in Europe.\n\nThe economy of what became East Germany also suffered greatly during the war, as well as during the postwar Soviet occupation. At first the Soviets ran their occupation zone solely for their own requirements. Many factories were dismantled and the machinery moved to the Soviet Union, and other factories were used to produce goods as payment to the Soviets for war reparations. A communist-style economic system was introduced. From the 1960s to 1989 the East German economy became more stable and was one of the most advanced in eastern Europe, though its economic problems were still great. It could not be compared with that of West Germany, which became western Europe’s leading economic power.\n\nAfter reunification in 1990, integrating the two different economies was expensive and difficult, and economic growth slowed considerably. The industries in the east were unable to compete with those in the west. Eastern Germany’s industrial output dropped rapidly, and its unemployment soared. The government used enormous amounts of money from western Germany to modernize the industries and transportation and telecommunications systems in the east. The national debt ballooned and taxes were raised. The economy also had other problems unrelated to reunification.\n\nGermany began to implement reforms intended to strengthen the economy as well as to reduce the costs of the expensive social welfare system. Economic growth eventually started to increase and unemployment began to fall, but the economy entered a recession in late 2008 because of the global economic downturn. Although this recession ended in 2009, Germany still faced significant economic challenges.\n\nAgriculture, Fishing, and Forestry\n\nGermany is one of the largest food producers in Europe. Although agriculture contributes less than 1 percent of GDP and employs only a small percentage of the country’s workers, it produces more than 80 percent of its food requirements. The country also exports many agricultural products.\n\nAbout a quarter of Germany’s land is planted with crops, while about a fifth is pasture. Much of the cropland is used to grow grain crops, especially wheat, barley, corn (maize), rye, and oats. Other important crops include potatoes (for both human and animal consumption and for industrial use), sugar beets, rapeseed (for making canola oil), cabbages and other vegetables, and apples and other fruits. The growing of grapes for wine is a major activity in southwestern Germany. The valleys of the Rhine, Neckar, Main, and Moselle rivers in the west are the main wine-producing areas. Various types of white wine are exported around the world. Hops for brewing beer are grown mainly in Bavaria. Barley is also an ingredient of beer, which is the most popular alcoholic drink in Germany and is also exported.\n\nThe raising of livestock is important. The country has one of the world’s largest stocks of pigs, and pork is a popular meat in German cooking. Milk and eggs are also major farm products.\n\nGermany maintains a deep-sea fishing fleet, but its size has been drastically reduced since the late 20th century, in part because the traditional fishing grounds have been overused. The fleet’s catch comes from the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the North Atlantic Ocean. The main fishing ports are Bremerhaven, Cuxhaven, and Hamburg, where canneries are located. Inland waters are fished on a much smaller scale, and carp and trout are raised at fish farms. Because of the high demand in Germany for fish, especially pickled herring, considerable quantities are imported.\n\nA little under a third of Germany is forested. The forestry industry meets only part of Germany’s great demand for timber for such purposes as construction, pulp and paper, and cellulose production, so wood and wood products are imported.\n\nManufacturing\n\nManufacturing accounts for about a fifth of GDP and employs about a fifth of Germany’s workers. This sector also produces the vast majority of the country’s exports, which are vital to the economy. Although manufacturing supplies a great variety of products, it is dominated by the automobile, electrical equipment and electronics, chemical, and machinery industries. German engineering is respected around the world for its high quality and technological sophistication.\n\nIndustry was formerly based primarily on coal, of which Germany has large supplies. The coal of the Ruhr basin was used as a basis for German industrial development in the late 19th century. An iron and steel industry arose, which became the largest in the world next to that of the United States by the 1930s. Supplies of iron ore, however, were not adequate, and ore was imported. Germany is still one of the world’s leading producers of steel. With the drop in the demand for steel in the late 20th century and the rise of less expensive steel from other countries, however, the German industry is not as prosperous as it was in the past. The country also produces other refined metals and metal products, though it must import most of the raw material.\n\nAutomobile manufacturing is important. The industry is concentrated in the states of Baden-Württemberg, Lower Saxony, Hessen, North Rhine–Westphalia, Bavaria, Saarland, and Thuringia. Leading automobile manufacturers in Germany include Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Opel, and Volkswagen. Many cars are exported.\n\nGermany is also one of the world’s top exporters of electrical and electronic products. It first became a leader in the production of electrical equipment in the late 19th century. Today, the industry is located largely in Nuremberg-Erlangen, Munich, Stuttgart, and other cities of southern Germany and includes the internationally known firm Siemens as well as numerous smaller companies.\n\nThe German chemicals industry is likewise more than 100 years old. It was first based on the use of coal, lignite, and rock salt and produced fertilizer and artificial dyes. The industry now produces a wide variety of chemical products, including polymers, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Chemical plants are located largely in the Ruhr region and along the Rhine and its tributaries, including at Leverkusen, Ludwigshafen, and Hoechst (near Frankfurt). There are also chemical plants on the coal fields of eastern Germany. Industry giants include the corporations BASF and Bayer.\n\nOther leading German industries produce machinery and equipment, processed foods, optical and precision instruments, medical equipment, computer software, renewable energy and energy efficiency products, biotechnology, and aircraft. Although the manufacture of textiles remains significant, it has declined greatly because of competition with countries that have lower wages. After reunification, many textile factories in eastern Germany closed. The shipbuilding industry gained considerable importance in the 1960s, but it too has suffered from overseas competition in recent years.\n\nMining and Energy\n\nGermany has a relatively small variety of mineral resources. The most important by far is coal. Deposits of bituminous (soft) coal are located in the Ruhr region and in the smaller Saar, Aachen, and Ibbenbüren fields. The country’s output of this type of coal, which has been expensive to extract, however, decreased markedly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Germany also produces significant amounts of the lower-grade lignite, or brown coal, which is found west of Cologne, east of Halle, south and southwest of Leipzig, and in Lower Lusatia in Brandenburg. Potash and rock salt are found in large deposits and are used in the chemical industry. There are some scattered deposits of low-grade iron ore, along with some copper, lead, zinc, tin, and uranium.\n\nApart from coal, energy resources are small. Germany has modest reserves of petroleum and natural gas but not enough to provide more than a fraction of the country’s requirements. Electric power production comes mainly from coal. Nuclear power plants are the other major source of electricity, though in 2000 the government committed to phasing them out over time. Some of the rivers of the Bavarian Alps are used to generate electric power as well.\n\nServices\n\nAs is common in countries with advanced economies, services dominate the labor market. Roughly two- thirds of German workers are employed in service industries, which contribute about a similar share of GDP. This sector includes such industries as commerce, transportation and communications, travel and tourism, real estate, trade, public administration, and information technology services. Finance, banking, and insurance are important. Germany’s chief financial center is Frankfurt am Main, which is the site of the central banks of Germany (the Deutsche Bundesbank) and the European Union, as well as numerous commercial banks and the country’s leading stock exchange.\n\nTrade is a major component of the German economy. The country is one of the world’s top exporters and has long maintained a favorable balance of trade. The main markets for Germany’s products include France, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, and other EU countries. Among the leading exports are automobiles, electrical and industrial machinery, steel and other metal products, and chemicals, including pharmaceuticals. Germany’s imports fall into remarkably similar categories as its exports, but the country also imports crude petroleum and other fuels, food products, and raw materials and unfinished products for industry. Import sources include France, the Netherlands, China, the United States, Italy, the United Kingdom, and other countries of the EU.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nGermany has a highly efficient transportation network. Railroads are mostly state-owned and well run and constitute one of the densest networks in Europe. In spite of their important role in the development of the country’s economy, the railroads carry much less freight and passengers than do highways. High-speed passenger rail service now links major German urban centers with one another and with other European destinations.\n\nThe highway system is excellent. The construction of the Autobahn, or motorway, system began in the 1930s, and by the end of the 20th century it totaled some 7,150 miles (11,500 kilometers), linking the major cities and regions of the country. Most German families own automobiles, and highways are often extremely congested.\n\nThe largest German airline is Lufthansa. It offers both domestic and international flights. Germany’s largest airport—and one of the busiest in Europe—is in Frankfurt am Main. Düsseldorf, Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, and Cologne-Bonn also have important international airports.\n\nGermany’s foreign exports are transported largely by ship. The major seaports are Hamburg, Bremen-Bremerhaven, and Wilhelmshaven on the North Sea and Lübeck and Rostock on the Baltic Sea. The movement of freight by internal waterways is also of great importance. The length of navigable rivers and waterways is about 4,500 miles (7,300 kilometers). Duisburg, Dresden, and Magdeburg are important inland ports. Apart from the Rhine River and its tributaries and the Danube River, there are such major canals as the Mittelland and Dortmund-Ems canals, which link the Ruhr region to the North Sea, and the Main-Danube Canal, which permits traffic to flow between the North Sea and the Black Sea. There are also several canals in a system that connects the Oder and Elbe rivers. With this extensive inland waterway system, it is possible for coal and other bulky raw materials to be moved cheaply by barge between the major industrial centers of the country.\n\nThe country has an advanced telecommunications system. German broadcasting is known for its high-quality news coverage and political and social reporting. There are both public and commercial television and radio stations. While some public stations are national, others are financed by individual states, and their programming often reflects regional and local issues and tastes. Numerous daily and weekly newspapers and periodicals are published.\n\nHistory\n\nGermany has been a unified country for only a small portion of its history. In ancient times, peoples who spoke Germanic languages occupied much of what is now northern Germany, while peoples who spoke Celtic languages lived in the south. After Germanic peoples moved into the south, the Celtic peoples probably gradually adopted Germanic culture. The numerous different Germanic tribes did not, however, share a common ethnic identity.\n\nAs Germanic tribes migrated south- and westward in the 1st centuries bc and ad, they also encountered the Romans, who were expanding their territory northward. In 113 bc two Germanic tribes—the Cimbri and the Teutoni—began invading the Mediterranean regions. The Roman general Gaius Marius defeated them in 102 and 101 bc. To discourage further invasions, Julius Caesar crossed the Rhine to make raids into Germanic land in 55 and 53 bc. In a famous battle in the Teutoburg Forest in ad 9, the Germanic leader Arminius, chief of the Cherusci, destroyed three Roman legions under Publius Quinctilius Varus. Historians believe that this rout convinced the Romans not to try to conquer the Germanic tribes. Instead, the Romans built a line of fortifications, called the Limes Germanicus, from the Rhine to the Danube to define and protect the Roman frontier. Trade and cultural exchange between Germanic peoples and the Roman Empire continued.\n\nWhen Roman power weakened, waves of Germanic tribes migrated to various regions of the empire. The Franks crossed the Rhine into Gaul (most of which is now France). The Goths migrated to the Balkans. The Alemanni moved into the Rhineland, and the Burgundians and Vandals entered the Main River valley. In the 4th century ad the Huns, a non-Germanic people from Asia, swept into Europe and pushed many more waves of Germanic tribes into Roman land.\n\nBy the beginning of the Middle Ages, the western part of the Roman Empire had come to an end, and Germanic peoples were spread throughout its territory. These tribes accepted Christianity and adopted much of Roman culture. They included the Frisians, between what are now the Netherlands and Denmark; the Saxons, between the Rhine and Elbe rivers; the Thuringians, in what is now central Germany; the Alemanni, on the upper Rhine in Swabia; and the Franks, on the lower Rhine.\n\nIn the late 5th century Clovis, king of the Franks, extended Frankish rule over northern Gaul. Clovis and his successors, who were of the Merovingian dynasty, eventually also ruled over much of what is now Germany. Another line of Frankish rulers, the Carolingians, came to power in the 8th century. Under the Carolingian ruler Charlemagne the kingdom covered most of western Europe, including Germany to the Elbe. In 800 the pope crowned Charlemagne emperor; his empire is today often called the Holy Roman Empire, though that term first came into use in 1254.\n\nCharlemagne died in 814. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 divided his empire among three of his grandsons. Louis the German acquired the eastern part, which developed into Germany. Charles the Bald ruled the west, which became France. Lothair obtained the middle part. The monarchy’s authority in the German kingdom was weak, and the power of regional dukes increased. There arose five great tribal, or Stamm, duchies—Saxony, Franconia, Bavaria, Swabia, and Lotharingia (Lorraine).\n\nIn 911 the Carolingian rule of Germany ended, and the German nobles elected Conrad I, the duke of Franconia, king. Rule soon passed to Henry I (919–936), the founder of the Saxon dynasty. The strongest Saxon king was Otto I the Great (936–973). He revived the Holy Roman Empire, which then included Germany and northern Italy but not France.\n\nReligious Conflicts and the Rise of Prussia\n\nIn 1024 Conrad II, founder of the Salian dynasty, was elected to rule. Soon the empire was torn by the Investiture Controversy, a conflict over whether the German ruler or the pope had the right to appoint high clergy. It was begun between Henry IV and Pope Gregory VII. Conflicts between the rulers and the popes over their relative authority continued under the next German ruling dynasty, the Hohenstaufens, especially under Frederick I (Barbarossa) and Frederick II. The Hohenstaufens ruled Germany and the Holy Roman Empire for most of the period from 1138 to 1254.\n\nWars between various local feudal rulers weakened the empire. The duchies were split into hundreds of smaller powers. Some cities became free cities, many of which banded together into powerful alliances. One such alliance, the Hanseatic League, dominated commercial activity in northern Europe. This league consisted of increasingly independent and powerful north German towns and commercial groups who defended their own trade concessions.\n\nThe decline of the Hohenstaufen dynasty resulted in the Great Interregnum, from 1250 to 1273, when the princes could not agree on a candidate to elect as king. Eventually, influenced by Pope Gregory X, they chose Rudolph of Hapsburg. To minimize election disputes and papal interference in German politics, in 1356 Emperor Charles IV issued a proclamation, known as the Golden Bull, that designated seven princes as electors, with the right to elect the ruler by majority vote.\n\nAlthough Rudolf’s successor was not a Hapsburg, the Hapsburgs eventually established themselves as the ruling dynasty. From 1452 until 1806, when the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved, all the emperors came from the House of Hapsburg.\n\nIn the 16th century, during the rule of Charles V, the German priest Martin Luther led the Reformation, the religious revolt against the Roman Catholic church. Germany and later Europe were bitterly divided into Catholic and Protestant camps. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 granted some religious tolerance by giving each German prince the right to choose either Catholicism or Lutheranism for his domain. Religious struggles continued, however, in the Thirty Years’ War (1618–48), which devastated Germany. The Peace of Westphalia, which ended the war, almost entirely eliminated the central authority of the empire. It made the empire a loose confederation of hundreds of essentially sovereign principalities, duchies, free cities, and other territories.\n\nTwo of these territories—Prussia and Austria—grew into major states. Austria was ruled by the Hapsburgs. The duchy and later kingdom of Prussia, centered in what is now northeastern Germany, began its rise to power under the Hohenzollern family. Frederick William I created a military state there. His son Frederick II the Great, who ruled from 1740 to 1786, made Prussia a leading power of Europe. After he seized Silesia from Austria, he annexed part of Poland, greatly increasing Prussia’s territory.\n\nIn the European wars accompanying the French Revolution and Napoleon I’s rise to power, French troops occupied western Germany. Prussia and Austria joined other European powers in some of the wars against France. After Napoleon formed the Confederation of the Rhine—a union that eventually included all the German states except Prussia and Austria, with Napoleon as “protector”—the Holy Roman Empire collapsed in August 1806. A few months later the French crushed the Prussians at Jena. Prussia then undertook reforms. Its leaders abolished serfdom, organized local self-government, and established universal military training.\n\nLater Prussia and Austria helped defeat Napoleon at Leipzig in 1813. By then, Germany was no longer divided into several hundred states, as the larger ones had taken over most of the smaller ones. The Congress of Vienna (1814–15), an international assembly that reorganized Europe after the wars, created a Germany with 39 states grouped into a loose German Confederation. Austria and Prussia struggled to control the Confederation. In 1848 a revolutionary movement failed to unify Germany under a democratic government.\n\nBismarck Creates the Second Reich\n\nThe Prussian prime minister Otto von Bismarck was to finally unify Germany in 1871. In 1864 Prussia and Austria occupied the Danish provinces of Schleswig and Holstein; after Bismarck maneuvered Austria into the Seven Weeks’ War in 1866, Prussia annexed the two provinces, as well as Hanover and other northern German states. Bismarck reorganized Germany and excluded Austria. The German states north of the Main River united with Prussia in 1867 in the North German Confederation.\n\nBismarck wanted to stir up German patriotism in order to build support for a united Germany, and he did so by having the German states fight a common enemy. In 1870 he provoked France into declaring war, and Prussia led the German states to victory. Defeated, France was forced to cede Alsace-Lorraine (a humiliation that was later to be reversed, when Germany had to return the territory in 1919). Before the war ended, the southern German states joined Prussia and the other North German states in forming a new German empire (or Reich). The king of Prussia, William I, was proclaimed emperor (or kaiser) of the Second Reich on January 18, 1871, at Versailles. (The first German Reich was the Holy Roman Empire.) Bismarck became the empire’s first chancellor.\n\nAs chancellor, Bismarck built up Germany’s industries. He also laid the foundation for a colonial realm in Africa (Togoland, Cameroon, German South West Africa, and German East Africa), China (the Jiaozhou Bay area in Shandong Province), and the Pacific (Kaiser Wilhelm’s Land, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Caroline Islands).\n\nWilliam II succeeded Frederick III (who had reigned for only a few months) as emperor in 1888. He dismissed Bismarck and built the country into a military nation. In 1914 Germany backed Austria in a conflict with Russia, and World War I was launched. Germany sought to enlarge its territory. Planning to fight a war on two fronts, Germany swept through Belgium and invaded France in the west and also fought Russia in the east. Germany, Austria, and Turkey together fought against the Allies, a coalition that included mainly France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, Japan, and later the United States.\n\nIn 1918 Germany was defeated, William II abdicated, and the German empire came to an end. Under the Treaty of Versailles, Germany ceded land to France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Lithuania, and Czechoslovakia, and it also lost its colonies. Its military powers were greatly restricted. Moreover, the treaty concluded that Germany was responsible for the damages the Allies had suffered in the war and so was required to pay them huge sums in reparations.\n\nWeimar Republic\n\nThe German people in 1919 elected a national assembly. At Weimar it drew up a constitution for a democratic republic, and Friedrich Ebert was elected the first president. The new republic faced enormous challenges, as Germany had been thrown into political, social, and economic turmoil by the war, the collapse of the empire, and the terms of the peace treaty. Unemployment and hunger mounted. In the Treaty of Rapallo of 1922, the new Soviet Union waived the war reparations due to it, but Germany still had to pay the other Allies. The following year France and Belgium occupied Germany’s Ruhr industrial region when reparation payments lagged. In response, the Germans shut down the Ruhr’s factories. Inflation soared disastrously, until a thousand billion marks (the German currency) equaled one prewar mark. People found that their life savings was now not even enough to buy a subway ticket.\n\nThe German government took steps to restabilize the currency in late 1923. In 1924 the Allies aided Germany with the Dawes Plan on reparations, and the troops withdrew from the Ruhr by the following year. The German economy began to recover. In 1925 President Ebert died, and Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg succeeded him. Germany signed a nonaggression pact at Locarno, Switzerland, and in 1926 joined the League of Nations. The Young Plan in 1929 fixed the amount of reparations to less than one third of the original amount. Soon after, however, the U.S. stock-market crash of 1929 plunged the whole world into a severe depression. It was only a one-year moratorium on debts in 1931 that saved Germany from bankruptcy.\n\nDictatorship Under Hitler\n\nDuring the depression Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party rose to power. Exploiting the deep resentment of the German people at the harsh terms of the peace treaty and the ruinous economy, Hitler promoted an extreme and virulent form of German nationalism, in which the Germanic people (the “Aryan race”) was considered better than all other ethnic groups. He offered a humiliated people a worldview in which they were superior, and he also offered a scapegoat, the Jews. Hitler claimed that the Jews were responsible for all of Germany’s recent problems, including its defeat in World War I, the reparations, the inflation, and the depression.\n\nA charismatic speaker, Hitler attracted a mass following. He had tried to overthrow the government in 1923. After the failure of his attempted coup, known as the Beer Hall Putsch, he tried to take power by legal means. In 1932 the Nazi Party was very successful in elections to the Reichstag (the lower house of parliament), winning 37 percent of the vote. Hitler ran for the presidency that year, but Hindenburg was reelected. In 1933, however, Hindenburg was persuaded to appoint Hitler chancellor.\n\nTo help Hitler seize absolute power, the Nazis began a campaign of terror. When the Reichstag building burned in a mysterious fire in February 1933, Hitler took advantage of the opportunity to assume emergency powers, suspend civil liberties, and arrest communist and other opposition leaders. In March he forced through the Enabling Act, which provided a constitutional basis for his dictatorship. The Länder, or states, lost their powers, and the Nazi Party was the only political party allowed. The Nazis called their new regime the Third Reich. When Hindenburg died in 1934, Hitler abolished the office of president and took the title Führer, or “leader.”\n\nThe totalitarian police state increased in power. Heinrich Himmler was chief of the Gestapo, or secret police. Joseph Goebbels directed the propaganda ministry. Cultural institutions, including the press, theater, and arts, were regimented. Schools and the Hitler Youth indoctrinated young people.\n\nThe Nazis persecuted both Roman Catholic and Protestant churches, and the infamous Nuremberg Laws of 1935 deprived Jews of citizenship. The Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) in 1938, during which many Jews and their property were brutally attacked, ushered in a new and more violent phase of their persecution, and the Jewish property that was left undestroyed was confiscated. The Nazis also began to send Jews to concentration camps.\n\nHitler talked peace but prepared for war. In 1933 Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and began rearming, secretly at first and openly from 1935. It moved troops into the Rhineland, in western Germany, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles in 1936. In that year Germany also formed a coalition, the Berlin-Rome Axis, with Italy. During the Spanish Civil War, Germany aided Spanish general Francisco Franco and tested its new weapons. By 1938 Hitler had the most powerful mechanized army and largest air force in the world.\n\nGreat Britain and France followed a policy of appeasement. They offered no opposition in 1938 when Hitler annexed Austria. Later that year they signed the Munich Pact with Germany and Italy to prevent Germany from invading Czechoslovakia and starting a new war: the treaty handed over a section of Czechoslovakia known as the Sudetenland to Germany. Nevertheless, in 1939 Germany seized all of Czechoslovakia and took territory from Lithuania. Hitler next demanded that Poland give Germany the city of Danzig (Gdańsk), but Poland refused. Britain and France pledged aid to Poland. Hitler concluded a nonaggression pact with Joseph Stalin of the Soviet Union, which removed the danger of Germany’s having to fight a war on a second front.\n\nHitler Launches World War II\n\nThe German army invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and began World War II. Two days later France and Britain declared war on Germany. Ultimately, the war involved the Axis powers of mainly Germany, Italy, and Japan fighting the Allied powers, or Allies, of mainly France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter crushing the Poles in 1939, Germany quickly took Norway, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France in 1940. Hitler’s plan to invade Britain was foiled when the German Luftwaffe, or air force, lost the air battle of Britain. Hitler seized the Balkans and North Africa after Italy’s invasions there failed. Despite the German-Soviet nonaggression pact, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. He swept on to many victories. After Japan attacked the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December 1941, the United States entered the war.\n\nTo relieve their manpower shortage, the Nazis imported millions of people, of what they called the “inferior races,” from conquered countries of Europe to use for slave labor. Those who resisted were herded into concentration camps. The Nazis also began rounding up Jews throughout Europe and shooting them or sending them to camps to be killed or used for slave labor. In a program of systematic mass slaughter now known as the Holocaust, the Nazis ultimately exterminated about 6 million Jews as well as millions of Roma (Gypsies), homosexuals, and others.\n\nGermany’s defeat at Stalingrad (now Volgograd), in the Soviet Union, in February 1943 marked the turning point of the war. The Allies drove the Nazis out of Africa, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Germany became a battleground as the Allies closed in from east and west. Just before defeat came, Hitler committed suicide. On May 7, 1945, Germany surrendered unconditionally.\n\nAllied armies occupied all of Germany. They found it a wasteland. Allied bombers had almost pulverized the large cities. Many thousands of German civilians had died in air raids, and some 3.5 million German soldiers had been killed in the war.\n\nThe war left Germany shrunken in size. In early 1939 it had been a country of 183,000 square miles (474,000 square kilometers) with a population of about 60,000,000. In 1945 it was reduced to 144,000 square miles (373,000 square kilometers) and was also reduced by several million inhabitants. The Soviets annexed northern East Prussia. Poland administered southern East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia, and Germany’s eastern border was pushed back to the Oder and Neisse rivers.\n\nAllied Nations Occupy Germany\n\nPending a peace treaty, Allied leaders met at Potsdam in 1945 and divided Germany into four occupation zones—French in the southwest, British in the northwest, U.S. in the south, and Soviet in the east. Berlin, deep in the Soviet zone, was also divided into four sectors.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg tried 22 Nazi leaders as war criminals. The Nuremberg trials ended in 1946 with 19 convicted, of whom 12 were sentenced to death. Civilian courts held denazification trials; those convicted were banned from public office and imprisoned.\n\nAlthough the division of Germany into occupation zones was intended to be only temporary, it made possible the future development of two separate German countries. The breakdown of the alliance between the democratic Western powers and the communist Soviet Union—which became known as the Cold War—further led to the partition of Germany. In 1947 the Americans and the British merged their zones to foster economic recovery there, and the Germans were allowed to set up state parliaments in all three Western zones. These moves laid the foundations for the emergence of the West German state. In 1948 cooperation between the Soviets and the Western occupation powers broke down amid disagreements over reform of the German currency and the joint administration of Berlin. After Soviet occupation forces blockaded the Western-controlled sectors of Berlin, the United States and Britain carried out a massive airlift of supplies to those sectors. By the spring of 1949 the blockade had been abandoned by the Soviets along with attempts to force West Berlin to become part of a Soviet-controlled city.\n\nAfter the blockade, the Western powers merged the French and U.S.-British occupation zones, and a new constitution was drawn up. On May 23, 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, was proclaimed, with Bonn as its capital. On October 7 of the same year, the Soviet zone was proclaimed as the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany. Its capital was East Berlin. West Berlin, which was entirely surrounded by East German territory, was treated as part of West Germany. West Germany became a multiparty democracy, while East Germany developed into an essentially one-party communist state under Soviet control. West Germany included the western two-thirds of what is now Germany, and East Germany included the eastern third.\n\nWest Germany\n\nAt first, West Germany was not a fully independent country, as the Western occupation powers maintained control over such areas as foreign policy and military affairs. The country was set up as a federal form of parliamentary democracy with a two-house parliament and a chancellor as head of government. The lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, was the main center of power at the federal level. The first federal elections, in 1949, resulted in the victory of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). Konrad Adenauer, the leader of the Christian Democrats, formed a coalition government with other smaller parties and became the first chancellor of the new state. Adenauer was one of the great political personalities of postwar Europe. He was a strong believer in an alliance with the United States and the Western powers and hoped for an eventual united Europe based on the federal principle. At the same time he hoped for a reunification of Germany—but only as a democratic state free of communist control.\n\nAdenauer was faced with pressing problems. One of the most urgent was caused by the arrival of millions of ethnic German refugees from the Polish-occupied areas of what had been eastern Germany as well as from East Germany and other countries of eastern Europe. The assimilation of these refugees presented both economic and social problems, but as the economy began to improve they found jobs and in fact contributed greatly to the country’s revival.\n\nOther problems, including the status of the Saar and its coal mines, were a result of the Allied occupation. Before World War I the Saar had been German territory, though France had controlled it at times in its earlier history. After World War I the French had attempted to obtain control of the Saar permanently. They had been forced to hand the territory over to the control of the League of Nations, who in 1935 gave it back to Germany. After World War II the area was initially part of the French occupation zone. The French detached the region from their own zone, joined it in a customs union with France, and gave it its own currency. A government was elected that gave France a 55-year lease on the coal mines. Adenauer opposed these moves strongly. With West Germany’s prosperity growing, the people of the Saar voted against its becoming an autonomous territory in a referendum of 1955. It became a state of West Germany, the Saarland, in 1957. Relations between Germany and France were improved by personal contacts between Adenauer and the French leader, Charles de Gaulle.\n\nSovereignty and economic recovery\n\nOn May 5, 1955, the occupation of West Germany ended, and it became fully sovereign. The country was then completely free to develop its own policies. In 1953 Adenauer had been reelected, and he had begun to lead West Germany into a period of economic prosperity. He proved to the Germans that democracy could bring success, an idea that helped to counter any pro-communist sympathy among the population. The poor economic performance of East Germany strengthened pro-Western feelings among West Germans, and in 1956 the communist party was declared illegal in West Germany.\n\nThe Social Democratic Party, which formed the largest group in opposition to the government, was critical of Adenauer’s policies. The party was unhappy with the continued employment in the government of people who had been Nazis. Moreover, education, especially at the universities, was still largely for a small elite, and in general society had changed little since the 1930s except for the political system.\n\nThe Social Democrats fought the rise of a new German army, but in 1953 the government received the necessary support from the two legislative houses to proceed. In 1955 West Germany joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The country had become a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952, and in 1957 it became an original member of the European Economic Community (EEC), or Common Market, which later formed the core of the European Union. It therefore became one of the leaders of Europe along with France and Great Britain.\n\nEnd of Adenauer era\n\nAdenauer was reelected chancellor in 1957 and again in 1961. In the latter election, however, his party lost seats in the Bundestag, and many hoped he would resign. He did so in 1963 and was succeeded by Ludwig Erhard, who as Adenauer’s economics minister had been the chief architect of the country’s impressive economic recovery. As chancellor, Erhard was not as strong as Adenauer and was under constant criticism from Adenauer, who remained a member of parliament and party leader.\n\nErhard was reelected in 1965. The economy was in difficulties, however, and there was no strong political leadership. The Free Democrats withdrew from the coalition cabinet in 1966 to protect their political future, and Erhard resigned. A new chancellor, Kurt Georg Kiesinger of the Christian Democrats, was chosen. He formed a coalition government with the Social Democrats; Willy Brandt, a leading Social Democrat, became vice-chancellor and foreign minister. This coalition lasted only three years. During this period West Germany tried to improve its relations with eastern Europe, but this policy of détente was curtailed for a time by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.\n\nThe Social Democrats\n\nThe Social Democrats won the 1969 elections, which reflected a trend toward the left. Willy Brandt became chancellor and formed a coalition with the Free Democrats. His political strength lay largely in the fact that during the war he had actively opposed the Nazis while in Norway and Sweden. His main interest was foreign policy; he was less successful in dealing with domestic matters. He revived the pursuit of East-West détente, termed Ostpolitik (eastern policy), which he had begun as Erhard’s foreign minister. At the end of 1970 he signed a treaty with Poland that recognized Poland’s rights to the German territories Poland had annexed after the war. Brandt had also visited Moscow that year to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union in which West Germany agreed to respect the frontiers and territories of all states in Europe. By this act West Germany renounced all claims to Polish and Czechoslovakian territory and recognized the boundary between West and East Germany. In 1972 relations between the two Germanys were normalized. Brandt still refused to recognize fully the claim of East Germany to be a sovereign, independent state, as this would have put the stamp of approval on the partition of Germany. West Germany and East Germany joined the United Nations separately in 1973.\n\nSoviet leader Leonid Brezhnev paid a visit to Bonn in 1973, an event welcomed by some as a sign of the end of Soviet–West German hostilities and of the Cold War. But Soviet approaches to West Germany were prompted more by a desire to obtain West German technology than by a desire for friendship. The Soviet Union in turn offered German industry raw materials and energy supplies, particularly oil and natural gas.\n\nThis period of seemingly improved relations with the Eastern bloc was brought to an end in 1974 by the revelation that one of Brandt’s personal staff was an East German spy. Brandt accepted full responsibility for the mistake and resigned as chancellor.\n\nThe new chancellor was Helmut Schmidt, a practical, well-respected leader and a good speaker. He was reelected in 1976 and 1980, leading a coalition government of his Social Democratic Party and the Free Democrats.\n\nThe new government faced the problem of growing domestic terrorism, especially from the West German radical left-wing group known as the Red Army Faction. The RAF bombed government offices, embassies, military bases, and corporations and kidnapped and murdered judges, politicians, and business people. In 1977 RAF terrorists hijacked a West German airliner and took it to Mogadishu, Somalia, where the passengers were rescued by a special team of West German police. The RAF was later found to have been supported by the East German secret police.\n\nAnother problem arose from the decision by the government to develop nuclear power in order to reduce petroleum imports and to diminish air pollution from the excessive use of coal. Fear of nuclear accidents caused public opposition to those plans, and demonstrations and blockades took place at nuclear plants and proposed construction sites. Much opposition came from the ranks of the ruling Social Democratic Party, but a new party devoted to the protection of the environment arose. Known as the Greens, it won a surprising 43 seats in the Bundestag in 1987. Dissension among party ranks, however, and diminished interest among voters in western Germany contributed to the Greens’ loss of all but seven seats in the 1990 all-German elections (after the two Germanys were reunified).\n\nIn 1981 the international economic recession began to affect West Germany, and unemployment rose sharply to a peak of more than 10 percent in 1983. Many of the 2 million foreign workers—mainly Turks and Yugoslavs—lost their jobs. In 1981 Schmidt visited East Germany in an attempt to improve relations between the two states. When the four Free Democrats in his cabinet resigned over differences of economic policy in 1982, the coalition government collapsed.\n\nChristian Democrats return to power\n\nHelmut Kohl of the Christian Democratic Union was chosen as chancellor, and in March 1983 he was given a clear mandate when his party was returned to power. He was reelected in 1987, but his party lost some of its seats. The United States government was particularly pleased with Kohl’s policies, but the chancellor did not neglect the problem of relations with East Germany. Ultimately, Kohl led the drive to unify the two Germanys.\n\nEast Germany\n\nControlled by the Soviet Union, East Germany developed along different lines. In May 1949 a constitution establishing the government of an East German state was adopted by the legislative body that became the Volkskammer (People’s Chamber), or parliament. The Socialist Unity Party, which had been formed in 1946, assumed power. It consisted mainly of Social Democrats and communists, with the latter dominating all party decisions. Wilhelm Pieck, a communist from the Socialist Unity Party, became president. The government essentially served as an agent of the all-powerful communist-controlled party. A Soviet-style Politburo controlled the party, with Walter Ulbricht, another veteran communist, as the party’s general secretary.\n\nThe period from 1949 to 1953 was marked by great unrest within the Socialist Unity Party and the country. Many people who were thought to be politically unreliable were expelled from the party, and some were imprisoned. At the same time the government was preparing for future economic development and taking control of industries and other economic resources. Its first Soviet-style five-year plan began in 1951. This plan stressed the construction of new heavy industry and gave a low priority to consumer goods industries. In 1952 East German authorities began the collectivization of agriculture.\n\nThe political upheavals, the agricultural collectivization, and the low standard of living caused many people to leave for the West. In 1952 East Germany closed off its borders with West Germany, but East Germans were still able to leave by traveling from East Berlin to West Berlin. From 1952 to 1954 about 700,000 people left East Germany, a loss of workers that hampered the planned development of farming and industry.\n\nUnrest among workers who remained led in 1953 to strikes in a number of cities, including East Berlin. These strikes grew into a rebellion that was put down with the aid of Soviet armed forces. In the wake of this uprising, the Soviet Union proclaimed East Germany a sovereign country in 1954. West Germany and other Western countries did not recognize East Germany until the early 1970s.\n\nAfter Pieck died in 1960, the office of president was abolished. Its role was assumed by the new Council of State, with Ulbricht as chairperson.\n\nThe communists maintained what had become a totalitarian dictatorship with the aid of a secret military police and espionage agency known as the Stasi. The Stasi was widely feared and hated. It sought to infiltrate every aspect of people’s lives, with its own spies as well as an enormous network of informants—ordinary East Germans who spied on and denounced their friends and neighbors. Those suspected of opposing the state were persecuted or sent to prison.\n\nThe Berlin Wall\n\nSome 3 million East Germans left for the West between the end of the war and 1961. In that year East Germany built a wall separating East and West Berlin to halt the exodus of badly needed skilled workers and others. It marked a turning point. East Germans could no longer go to the West without official permission, which was difficult to obtain. Those who tried to escape by climbing the wall risked being shot by guards.\n\nAt the same time economic reforms that eased central planning controls were introduced. Industrial production increased rapidly, more consumer goods began to appear in stores, and a mood of optimism began to spread through the population. By the mid-1960s the standard of living was higher than in most other Soviet-bloc countries.\n\nIn 1968 the rise of a more liberal regime in Czechoslovakia alarmed the Soviet and East German governments. East German military units took part in the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. In spite of this development, relations with West Germany began to improve.\n\nEnd of the Ulbricht era\n\nUlbricht resisted opening relations with West Germany, and the Soviet Union forced him to retire in 1971. He was replaced by Erich Honecker, another hard-line communist. One of Honecker’s first acts was to nationalize all the remaining private enterprise. Attempts were made to counter the influence of West German television, which was easily received in many parts of the country. The unique nature of East Germany and its culture was stressed, and loyalty to the state was firmly emphasized.\n\nBy the 1970s the economy was one of the most industrialized and successful in eastern Europe, but shortages of labor and natural resources began to occur. A serious food shortage developed in 1982. East Germany had meanwhile been building considerable debt to Western banks, and problems arose with the repayment of interest and capital. The Soviet Union sharply criticized these foreign loans.\n\nReunification\n\nIn 1989 the two Germanys individually celebrated their 40th anniversaries as separate states. As the Soviet Union began to adopt liberal economic and political reforms in the late 1980s, so too did its satellite countries in eastern Europe. As it gave up its control of eastern Europe in 1989–90, reunification of the two Germanys became suddenly possible.\n\nThe totalitarian East German government at first ignored—and then opposed—the gradual political liberalization that was occurring in the Soviet Union. In 1988 Honecker pressed for even tighter ideological control. In the summer of 1989 a new reformist government in Hungary began allowing East Germans to escape to the West through Hungary’s newly opened border with Austria. West German embassies in Poland and Czechoslovakia were flooded with East German refugees trying to emigrate, and huge numbers of East Germans streamed into West Germany. Enormous pro-democracy demonstrations and marches broke out in cities across East Germany.\n\nThe communist government of East Germany fell quickly. Honecker was removed from office in October 1989 and was replaced by his hard-line protégé, Egon Krenz. Amid the mass exodus of East Germans, the government promised freer East-West travel; the culmination of this promise was the opening of the Berlin Wall on November 9. That night tens of thousands of jubilant East Berliners poured through crossing points in the wall to celebrate their new freedom.\n\nIn larger and larger demonstrations East German citizens demanded change. In mid-November Krenz was replaced with a reform-minded communist who promised free, multiparty elections, which took place in March 1990. Although the Socialist Unity Party was reconfigured and renamed, it suffered a major defeat. East Germans voted overwhelmingly for a conservative alliance that proposed quick reunification with West Germany. The new coalition government was led by the Christian Democratic Union, with the party’s Lothar de Maizière as prime minister. His administration began dismantling the communist system that had been in place for 40 years and working with West German leaders to reunify the two Germanys.\n\nIn July 1990 the West German deutsche mark became the sole legal currency in East Germany. Later that month, the last major obstacle to reunification—Soviet control—was removed. West German chancellor Helmut Kohl persuaded Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to agree to accept a united Germany as a member of NATO. In return, West Germany provided the Soviet Union with substantial financial aid.\n\nBecause of East Germany’s ruined economy and its outdated industries, many West German companies were hesitant to invest there. Nearly half of the East German workforce was unemployed, and nearly three-quarters of the businesses failed by the end of 1990. Poland expressed concern that the country might not accept post-World War II borders. Eventually, however, Germany stated that it would respect the borders with Poland.\n\nThe unification treaty was signed on August 31, 1990, and in September some further issues were resolved during the “two-plus-four” negotiations (a phrase referring to the two Germanys and the four Allied powers). Germany was officially reunified on October 3, 1990. Berlin became its capital.\n\nThe integration of the two Germanys proved to be a very long and expensive process. Large sums of money—more than expected—were required to modernize the industries and infrastructure in what had been East Germany. The east’s economy was restructured, and the standard of living there was raised. Nevertheless, significant economic, social, and cultural differences remained between east and west. Some 20 years after reunification the unemployment rate in the east remained about twice as high as in the west. The difficulties of reunification led to disillusionment and resentment between some westerners and easterners.\n\nGermany Since Reunification\n\nOn December 2, 1990, the first free all-German parliamentary elections in 58 years were held. Former West German chancellor Helmut Kohl, representing the Christian Democratic Union party, was elected Germany’s new chancellor. The following year Kohl helped negotiate the treaty that created the European Union (EU). Kohl was reelected in 1994, but his popularity declined throughout the 1990s. His efforts to integrate Germany into the EU led to the introduction of harsh fiscal measures in order to bring the country’s economy in line with those of other European countries. That effort was rewarded in May 1998, when Germany qualified for entry into the European economic and monetary union. (This allowed Germany to replace its national currency with the euro in 2002.) Kohl’s 16-year reign as chancellor came to an end, however, when the Social Democrats were victorious in national elections in September 1998.\n\nThe leader of the Social Democrats, Gerhard Schröder, became chancellor and formed a coalition government with the Greens. Schröder’s government focused on improving the sluggish economy and reducing the financial costs of the country’s robust social welfare programs. Germany began to phase out its use of nuclear energy, pledging to curtail it entirely by about 2025, a goal especially important to the Greens. Schröder sent German troops to Kosovo in 1999 and to Afghanistan in 2001 but was critical of U.S. policy toward Iraq. The latter position helped boost his personal popularity, and despite the country’s continuing economic problems, his Social Democrat/Green coalition narrowly won reelection in 2002. Schröder was a forceful and vocal critic of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. His welfare program cuts, however, proved highly unpopular.\n\nWith Germany’s economy still worsening, elections were held a year early, in 2005. The Christian Democrats, led by Angela Merkel, won by a very small margin. After weeks of negotiations, they formed a “grand coalition” government with the Social Democrats, their largest opponent. Merkel became not only the first woman to hold the chancellorship but also the first former East German to do so. She was returned to office for a second term in 2009. This time, however, her party won just enough seats in the Bundestag to form a coalition with its traditional partners, and the Social Democrats became an opposition party.\n\nUnder Merkel the government took some modest steps to tackle economic and welfare system reform. The official retirement age, for example, was raised from 65 to 67. In 2006–07 the economy began to rebound. The overall growth increased, and the persistently high unemployment rate fell. In 2008–09, however, Germany was hard hit by the global financial crisis. The country’s exports dropped, and it entered a deep recession. Although the recession ended in the second half of 2009, the country still faced slow economic growth and a large public debt.\n\nIn other parts of Europe, public debt levels soared to exceptionally high levels. This created an economic problem in the EU called the euro-zone debt crisis. Germany took a leadership role in the handling of the crisis. To deal with the high debt levels, Merkel promoted measures such as government spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Germany pursued a closer relationship with the United States. Merkel was widely hailed for her mediation skills. She generally continued Germany’s strong promotion of European integration, though after the economic crisis tensions arose between Germany and the rest of the EU over economic policy. Nevertheless, Germany remained a leader in Europe, central to its stability and prosperity.\n\nBy the time of the 2013 federal elections, Merkel’s personal popularity was bolstered by strong economic numbers. The unemployment rate was the lowest since reunification. Merkel’s handling of the economy and her approach to the euro-zone debt crisis appeared popular with voters. In the 2013 parliamentary elections the CDU and CSU captured nearly 42 percent of the vote. They won almost an absolute majority of the seats. Merkel became the third chancellor in the post-World War II era to win three elections. However, her government’s junior partner, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), failed to reach the 5 percent threshold for representation for the first time in the postwar period. After more than two months of negotiations, Merkel formed a grand coalition government with the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SDP).\n\nIn her third term, Merkel was faced with a severe refugee crisis. Huge numbers of refugees escaping conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere fled to Europe. Many of them chose to go to Germany, which was among the EU’s most prosperous countries. For humanitarian reasons, Merkel stated that Germany would welcome refugees in the face of the emergency. More than one million migrants entered the country in 2015. The number of new migrants strained public services, including the police and border guards. Merkel’s open-door refugee policy was deeply unpopular among many Germans. This was particularly true after a series of violent attacks in Germany in 2016.\n\nDuring New Year’s celebrations in 2016, gangs of men attacked hundreds of women in Cologne and other German cities. Several of the attackers were migrants to Germany. The country was also the site of a pair of terrorist attacks in July 2016 carried out by migrants. In December of that year, a Tunisian migrant intentionally drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people.\n\nA backlash against migrants led to street protests in Germany. In local and regional elections far-right political parties turned anti-immigrant feelings to their advantage. Alternative for Germany (AfD) was one such anti-immigrant party that met with new success. In the 2017 federal elections the AfD won about 13 percent of the vote. That was enough to secure the party seats in the parliament. It was the first time since World War II that Germany had a nationalist party serving in the parliament. On the other hand, Merkel’s CDU-CSU alliance received its lowest vote percentage in the postwar era. With about a third of the vote, however, it won the largest share of seats. Merkel was returned for a fourth term as chancellor.\n\nFurther evidence of waning support for the CDU-CSU came in 2018. In October the CSU turned in its worst performance in more than half a century in regional elections in Bavaria. The CDU suffered a similar setback in regional elections in Hesse later that month. Merkel subsequently announced that she would step down as chancellor at the end of her term in 2021. She also gave up her role as head of the CDU in late 2018. She was replaced in the CDU leader’s post by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who was widely thought to be Merkel’s preferred choice to succeed her as chancellor. Kramp-Karrenbauer, however, struggled to maintain party unity. Although the CDU had declared a ban on any alliances with the AfD, CDU delegates in Thuringia openly defied the ban by voting with the far-right party in the state election held there in February 2020. Uproar over the election led Kramp-Karrenbauer to step down as CDU leader. The post was later filled by Armin Laschet, another Merkel loyalist.\n\nGermany, like other countries around the world, soon had to confront the outbreak of COVID-19, an illness caused by a coronavirus. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global pandemic. By that time COVID-19 cases had been confirmed in all 16 German federal states. Germany’s response to the public health crisis was initially hailed as a model for how to handle the pandemic. Lockdown measures and an effective strategy for testing and contact-tracing helped keep COVID-19-related deaths and infection rates relatively low during the pandemic’s early stages. Following a period during which lockdown measures were eased, however, a second wave of COVID-19 cases struck the country. Tougher lockdown restrictions were imposed before the second wave peaked in mid-January 2021. Merkel’s government faced strong criticism over the slow rollout of Germany’s vaccination program. A third wave of cases began in March, but infection rates declined by May as the vaccination campaign eventually gathered pace. A fourth wave began later in the year that consisted primarily of cases among unvaccinated Germans.\n\nHaving lost ground in the polls as the pandemic wore on, the CDU-CSU could not recover by the time the 2021 federal elections were held on September 26. Though Merkel actively campaigned for the CDU-CSU and Laschet, the alliance’s candidate for chancellor, the Social Democrats, led by finance minister Olaf Scholz, prevailed over the CDU-CSU to earn a narrow plurality of seats in parliament. The Greens also made notable gains, placing third with about 15 percent of the vote. The strong showing for the Greens reflected growing concern among Germans over climate change, particularly in the wake of catastrophic flooding in western Germany over the summer. Following the elections the Social Democrats began negotiations on forming a coalition government. In November the Social Democrats agreed to form a coalition with the Greens and the Free Democrats. Merkel remained in office until Scholz was sworn in as the country’s new chancellor on December 8."
