        "text": "Could you explain why different analyses come out with such different numbers when trying to calculate how many people died during a particular heat season or event?\n\nGM: The reason why estimates of heat-related deaths differ is because different studies use different approaches to calculate the numbers. The approaches, while methodologically robust, can vary in terms of the data used, the criteria considered, and the statistical models employed.\n\nSome studies focus solely on direct heat-related deaths (e.g. where the cause of death was registered as heat stroke), while others consider excess all-cause mortality. This means the deaths above what might be expected for the period of analysis, and includes deaths from indirect heat effects related to heat sensitive diseases such as cardiovascular, respiratory or renal disease.\n\nSK: Heat deaths can be estimated statistically in terms of the impacts on all cause mortality for days above a heat threshold (usually temperature) over a heat season, and also for individual heatwave events.\n\nIt’s worth noting that there’s no single correct answer, as heat related mortality covers a range of outcomes. It can be used to describe estimates for an average year, or for a specific hot year for temperatures above a threshold (this is similar to how air pollution impacts are estimated). Many heat-related deaths also occur on hot days outside a recognised heatwave event.\n\nThe estimates of individual heatwaves are also likely to vary, because impacts across events and locations will differ significantly depending on many factors, including population exposure, vulnerability and behaviour.\n\nChanges in impact patterns can be more interesting for researchers and policy makers than total mortality figures, for example looking at the locations or age groups most affected.\n\nJSG: The availability and quality of data also play a crucial role in estimating heat-related deaths. Some countries may have robust health surveillance systems and comprehensive reporting mechanisms, resulting in more accurate data. However, in many areas, there may be underreporting or misclassification of heat-related deaths, leading to an underestimation of the true impact. Incomplete data can skew the estimates and contribute to the disparities observed.\n\nStudies like Ballester et al. are robust in their approach and helpful to provide a standardised measure of what is happening across different countries, which individually, may use different methods to measure this impact.\n\nMP: In France, two approaches are used to assess the impact of heat on mortality. Firstly, excess deaths during heatwaves are estimated by comparing observed mortality with expected mortality. Calculations of excess mortality provide quick and easy, but do not reveal the specific causes of the excess deaths.\n\nSecondly, models are used to estimate the fraction of heat-related deaths during summer. These models consider various factors and have shown that approximately 33,000 deaths in France from 2014 to 2022 were due to heat, with the highest impact in 2022. These findings align with similar conclusions reached by other research teams.\n\nWhen comparing estimates, it’s important to consider the temporal precision of the data. The risk of mortality from heat is highest within 0 to 3 days of exposure, so it’s best to have daily data. However, if daily data is not available, using weekly data can still provide some useful insights, although it tends to underestimate the true impact.\n\nFor example, the European Observatory on Climate and Health provides national estimates of heat-related mortality for 2014-2020, based on weekly temperature and mortality data. When we compare their results with ours for France, we found differences ranging from 7% to 60%, depending on the year. Differences are larger during summer with more daily variations in temperatures. This is also the main explanation for the difference in numbers estimated by the Ballester et al. study..\n\nRegardless of the variations that result from methodological differences, all these findings highlight the need to adapt and prepare for heat-related risks and take action to mitigate climate change.\n\nEO: Most heat-related deaths are due to an exacerbation of underlying health conditions, so the death is not likely to be recorded as heat-related through the deaths registration process in most countries. Therefore, we can only use indirect methods such as those used in France to produce estimates of the impacts of heat.\n\nIdeally, a number of different methods are used, as each approach has strengths and weaknesses. For example, estimating the number of excess all-cause deaths during a heatwave provides a reasonably simple measure of the wider impacts. It is an approach used across other risks, including COVID-19, so also lends some consistency. However, where there is a delay in availability of deaths data and a need for more rapid assessment – for example, to support policy decisions and action – it may be helpful to use the evidence from previous episodes to develop an epidemiological model. This model can be applied to the heatwave scenario to provide estimates of the likely impacts. Applying both of these methods to a single heatwave event will produce different estimates of the impacts, although both estimates are ‘valid’.\n\nDepending on the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, different users may have a preference for one measure over another. For example, estimates of excess all cause deaths are a useful measure for public health organisations, as it is a metric also used for other public health risks and in some countries these data may be available quickly. However, individual measures are rarely considered in isolation and generally other evidence and supporting data will also be used to develop a wider understanding of the impacts, for example, on healthcare service use.\n\nDifferences in estimated impacts that use the same method for seemingly very similar heat events also highlight the dynamic nature of heat risk, of which exposure is just one aspect. Other factors, such as behaviour and the role of concurrent risks like air pollution, also play an important part. Using different methods to estimate the impacts helps us to understand some of the drivers behind these differences."
