        "text": "This list of flight options should be used as a guide only, and you should check each airline’s website for current routes, frequency and schedules. Not all flights operate daily, and may not run for the entire season. You should also heed the latest flight arrival time and earliest flight departure time stated in the connecting travel section, as it may not be possible to arrange connecting travel outside these times. Please do not book your flights until we have confirmed your accommodation to you. Alternatively, our expert reservations team will be happy to offer advice and to make flight bookings for you for any of the options listed above. We charge £35 per person for our flight booking service. Your flights are then covered by our package-booking conditions, which give you greater protection in the event of delay or cancellation, as well as providing ATOL cover.\n\nI'd recommend if travelling this route by train to expect delays (apparently a recent stat reported only 58% of German trains are on time) and if you are delayed try to relax and go with the flow!\n\nAfter arriving an hour late and a bit travel frazzled at the Hotel Peterle (just before 8pm) we quickly relaxed as we were served a delightful meal of local seasonal food with accompanying wines. The hotel provided me with a beautifully decorated breakfast table for my birthday.\n\nLoved seeing red (black) squirrels running around, the fish in the Feldsee and a hummingbird hawk moth feeding from the geranium flowers on our balcony.\n\nA personal highlight was a cold beer after arriving at the Hotel Sonne after a long enough hot walk from Hinterzarten.\n\nFreiburg was delightful to stroll around at leisure and there were so many lovely old buildings to appreciate. When staying at the Hotel Oberkirch do not leave your window open at night, the quarterly chimes are loud enough and the vigorous bell ringing at 6am will ensure you are awake. The hotel supplies earplugs for a reason.\n\nI have just finished two back to back walking trips, 'Castles, Vines, Forests of Alsace', and 'A Walk in the Black Forest with Freiburg', separated by two nights in Colmar, and I would encourage anyone thinking of walking in this part of Europe to consider this combination. Even though geographically the walks are close, they are complementary from a cultural, cuisine, and landscape perspective. On the French side the route goes from a series of ancient villages set amongst some of the most famous white wine vineyards in France through forests with many viewpoints over the Rhine Valley. On the German side the routes go from idyllic Black Forest pastoral landscapes, through deep forests to mountaintop lookouts, and one appreciates why many Germans consider themselves to be a \"forest people\" with a mythological link to the Schwarzwald, Black Forest. Colmar is a picture perfect traditional French Alsacian city with canals and half-timbered buildings lovingly preserved with a distinct legacy of its many Germanic roots.\n\nA wonderful holiday - the routes are well thought out, instructions thorough and alternative options at each location good in the event of poor weather. We experienced rain at the start of Day 1 so decided to walk the Shepherd Boys' Trail and were pleased we did as it is very scenic and lovely to read about the history. As mentioned by other reviewers, it may be best to consider completing the Ravenna Gorge early in the day before the coaches arrive. If you do this walk in the morning the Titisee circuit is a nice combination to do in the afternoon. The St Peter trail is very picturesque but would recommend getting the train back from Himmelreich rather than walk the valley floor back to Kirchzarten. We enjoyed the trail over to Freiburg and can recommend a lunch stop at the Forest Restaurant St.Ottilien - lovely outdoor area and friendly staff (at about halfway, after the ascent). As we had a full Sunday in Freiburg and didn't depart until late Monday afternoon we added an extra walk - the Schónberg Gipfel loop from Vauban (Komoot app). We can recommend this circuit on a sunny day if you wish to experience the wonderful views from the other side of Freiburg. The Schónberghof half way around being another ideal place for lunch. Lovely area of Germany for its scenery, wildlife and hospitality. Hotels Peterle, Sonnen and Oberkirche are all excellent.\n\nThis was the first time we had been to the Black Forest. The villages and towns where we stayed and the well chosen walks provided an excellent view of what is very pretty countryside. We were surprised at the wild flowers still blooming in September and can imagine that the walks would be spectacular in the spring. It is hard to pick favourites but the walk through and up out of the Ravenna Gorge and the walk from St Peter to Kirchzarten were definitely highlights. In the case of the latter don't bother with the dull walk back along the valley floor into Kirchzarten. Catch the train back (free with the Gastekarte) and use the time saved to enjoy a glass of wine or coffee instead. There is plenty of interest to see in Freiburg but, if you have a spare day, it is easy to take the train out of the city to see more of the Black Forest. The Freiburg Information Centre is very helpful in this regard. We took the train to Schluchsee and had a walk along the lake since we had not had time to take Option C when staying in Falkau.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our active walking holiday in the Black Forest followed by a relaxing couple of days in the beautiful small city of Freiburg. The Inntravel itinerary has been well thought out with options each day for different levels of difficulty. The perfect walking terrain varied between dense forests of magnificent trees and lush green meadows and valleys. Even in August, we could walk for hours without seeing anyone, although the top of Feldberg (we added an extra 2 miles to reach the actual summit) and the visitor centre of the Ravenna Gorge were quite busy. We were grateful to a previous reviewer who recommended walking to Sankt Peter (and taking the bus back) rather than starting with the bus and walking downhill back to Kirchzarten. We decided to do the same as we much prefer to walk before reaching our goal for the day … and also enjoy the challenge of walking uphill. The views along the way were amazing. We felt we made the most of our single day in Hinterzarten where there were two recommended walks. We completed the Ravenna Gorge walk in the morning, then walked though the forest to Titisee in the afternoon and took the train back.\n\nWe particularly enjoyed the Hotel Peterle with the passion of its owners and staff really shining through. The Hotel Sonne with its great restaurant and wonderful position in Kirchzarten was another highlight. We also loved our room at the Hotel Oberkirch in Freiburg where we looked directly at the Munster and had a great view of all the activities of Munsterplatz with its daily market and evening entertainment. All in all a wonderful holiday in a beautiful part of Germany. We're already looking forward to our next Inntravel adventure.\n\nWe loved the varied and beautiful walks and the rich variety of flowers butterflies insects and birds. The trails apart from the Ravenna gorge were also astonishingly quiet. We especially loved each of the walks between the hotels. The Shauinsland route was tough as it was a continuous descent on loose stones and our calves struggled. It was incredibly hot and humid during our stay with temperatures getting into the 30s so on one day we booked into Aquafun in Schluchsee. Lovely views with shade and pool and lake swimming to cool off.\n\nThe food was hearty and tasty but for us the highlight was the menu at the hotel Sonne, delicious.\n\nFreiburg is a beautiful little city and a fun way to complete the holiday.\n\nAnother great Inntravel holiday, well organised as ever, with superb hotels and walks. The walks were a very peasant mix of woodlands and meadows, often with amazing views. The tracks were well signposted and easy to follow. The grading was about right for us; we averaged just under 10 miles per walking day.\n\nWe had an extra night at the Hotel Peterle and therefore could do both the Feldburg-Falkau circuit and the Shepherd Boys' trail. Both excellent walks, especially the former with its far-ranging views.\n\nWe were very luck with the weather, and did not need waterproofs or fleeces at all.\n\nFreiburg is well worth visiting. Our full day there was a Sunday when all of the shops were closed (meaning the city was very quiet), but the museums were open. While dining at the Hotel Oberkirch's restaurant on Sunday evening, we were treated to a concert by the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra in the Munsterplatz as part of Freiburg's music festival.\n\nOnce again, many thanks to Inntravel for a fantastic holiday.\n\nThanks to Inntravel I had the best 60th birthday ever, it was perfect from start to finish…we loved every minute and we were blessed with wonderful weather too. This is our fourth holiday with Inntravel and our third one in Germany and it did not disappoint. The owners and staff at the Hotel Peterle were friendly and the father and son cooked together creating some wonderful food. The walks on the holiday were great, the only one we found a little short and touristy was the Ravenna Gorge as it was teaming with three coach loads of American tourists and unfortunately we were also in the German school holidays so were warned of going to Lake Titisee for the same reasons. However all the rest of the walks were beautiful and so picturesque. Be mindful to look out for the schnapps cupboard on the tree towards the end of the Shepherd Boys' Trail as it is not mentioned in the notes, but really was the highlight of our day…it was so unexpected and highlighted the honesty and integrity of the people in the area that such a thing could exist. As always with Inntravel holidays we never ever tire of the sense of adventure making your own way around on foot and meeting amazing people along the way. Thanks again for such a wonderful trip.\n\nThis is an excellent and varied walking holiday. We are two fit 66 year olds and some of these walks require a bit of stamina because of the ups and downs and the varied terrain underfoot - if you're not a young whippersnapper, we'd recommend you get some time in your legs before you undertake this. Having undertaken a 'training' regime', we had no problems with seven days back to back walking though (we added a couple of extra days). We've found it hard to decide which was our favourite walk, they were all enjoyable in different ways. Our highlight hotel was the Peterle - wonderful friendly service and charming people. Food and wine were excellent - the family are great hosts and really do care for their guests. The church at St Peter is an absolute gem and we enjoyed this walk very much. A caveat for the Hotel Oberkirche - if you are in the building in Schustersrasse, make sure they explain the code to get back in the buidling in the evening. They didn't tell us (and others) and it's not good to be left locked out at 10pm. We spoiled ourselves on our last night in Freiburg with dinner at the Wolfshohle - what a great evening of food and wine that was. Highly recommended. A further highlight on our final morning was hearing someone play the organ (or might have been all four organs judging by the sound!) in the Munster - it was an incredible experience with the music filling the whole space, almost as if it were a surround sound system. If you hear the organ start to play - get inside quick. Finally a word for Inntravel themselves - our return flight was cancelled when we were waiting at the boarding gate. Inntravel were simply superb - they booked us accomodation and a flight back via Frankfurt the following day as there was no flight home from Basel until three days later. This was all done calmly and speedily - what a relief it was in a very stressful situation. How a company responds when things go wrong is always the true mark of their quality and we could not have asked for more of them.\n\nThis was a wonderful holiday. The area is so beautiful, the walking was varied and your routes were excellent, although occasionally challenging. Your instructions and the walkers' signs everywhere made following the routes easy. The hotels were all very good and our rooms were lovely but we particularly liked Peterle and the Waldhotel where we had a very friendly welcome and the food was fantastic. Our favourite was Peterle where we were very glad had booked an extra night in order to do 2 walks. Our highlight was the wonderful walk from Alpersbach to Feldkirch with 360 degree views from the Hinterwalkopf.\n\nTips - the walk into Freiburg does not take 6 hours! Out timings were usually close to yours but we did this walk in 5.\n\nIf you don't want to do the steep climb back out of the Ravenna Gorge, you can use Inntavel's instructions for the return from Hinterzarten from the Titisee walk-useful in poor weather, not steep and very attractive.\n\nDo ask for the wine list to see prices before you let Herr Fehrenbach give you his recommendations!!\n\nOur friends laughed when we told them we were going walking in Germany. You will be eating pork and potatoes all week they said. In fact nothing could be further from the truth. The gourmet meal with curated wines to match at Hotel Peterle was incredible. We also loved Josef's cooking at Waldhotel Fehrenbach which included lichen soup and a deconstructed black forest gateau. Both hotels served beautifully presented food which massively exceeded our expectations. This was our 7th holiday with Inntravel and one of the best. An Inntravel holiday feels like travelling independently but all the research and arrangements have been taken care of behind the scenes. Smooth and worry free slow travel. We loved the walking through forests and butterfly filled meadows. The Black Forest was stunning in all respects including the weather which was dry every day we walked and in fact a little too hot at 30C one day. There was an amazing thunderstorm one night - when it rains, it really rains. The cuckoo clock shop at Ravenna made us smile. We also did the Freiburg add on with 2 nights at Hotel Oberkirch. There was a wine festival in the Munsterplatz just outside the hotel for both the nights we were there. Our hotel was perfectly located both for this and wandering around the Altstadt of Freiburg which was beautiful. We would highly recommend this holiday.\n\nEvening meals at Peterle, Waldhotel & Sonne were all superb. Highlight was the five course gourmet menu including wine at Peterle absolutely excellent.\n\nJosef Fehrenbach the owner of the Waldhotel Fehenbach is indeed a master chef and very intensive host who delights in explaining his locally sourced mouth watering creations. It was my wife's birthday on the second night and Josef very kindly made her a birthday cake making our stay even more memorable.\n\nThe views looking out over the Windeckkopf ski ramp emerging from the forest are breath taking and truly spectacular.\n\nBrillantly well organised holiday by Inntravel, accommodation is all of a very good standard and the meals provided are superb. A great way to experience South West German hospitality and warmth, very happy with everything from efficient luggage transfers to superb walks with plenty of guide notes; would not hesitate to recommend this marvelous experience."
