        "text": "Over lunch the other day my colleagues and I were discussing an upcoming conference in Barcelona. Almost immediately, the conversation turned to how to get there without flying. I find this kind of conversation to be a very European thing, or perhaps a very Freiburg thing. Many of my friends in Germany would not consider flying unless they needed to cross a large body of water; even then they are happy to take ferries and underground tunnels to help make land travel possible.\n\nThe most direct flight to Barcelona is two hours long and costs €100. I know, because I traveled to Barcelona last summer for a long weekend; it didn’t even occur to me to take a train when I was booking my travel arrangements. But the fact that train travel from Freiburg to Barcelona is twice the price and takes five times as long as air travel didn’t phase my colleagues. They are living their values, and their everyday choices reflect that."
