        "text": "Advertisement disclaimer: This travel guide to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg is made in collaboration with Tourismus Marketing GmbH Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. As always, we share our honest opinion and everything is written by us.\n\nA state full of wonders\n\nBaden-WÃ¼rttemberg, also sometimes shortened to BW or BaWÃ¼, is a state in the southwestern part of Germany.\n\nWe have previously spent a lot of time in its neighbouring state of Bavaria â and in the summer of 2023, we finally had the opportunity to explore more of Southern Germany when we visited Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg on a road trip.\n\nThis sunny state combines traditional German culture with a laidback attitude (perhaps more similar to how life is lived in its South European neighbour countries).\n\nWhile we thoroughly enjoyed exploring the scenic towns, what really made us love Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg was the natural landscapes; the dark forests, the green hillsides and the deep blue lakes.\n\nIn this travel guide to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, we share the best things to do and see in the state, road trip itinerary inspiration, where to stay, when to visit, how to get around, our best travel tips and much more.\n\nWhy visit Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\n\nAs if being the German state with the most hours of sunshine (and Michelin-starred restaurants!) isnât enough, hereâs why you should visit Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg:\n\nNatural beauty: Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg is known all over the world for its stunning landscapes. From the picturesque Black Forest with its magical waterfalls to the serene lakes and rolling hills, nature lovers will find plenty of breathtaking scenery to explore. We sure did!\n\nOutdoor activities: Whether you enjoy hiking, cycling, skiing or water sports, Ba-WÃ¼ offers a wide range of outdoor activities throughout the year. The varied terrain and well-maintained trails cater to outdoor enthusiasts of all levels.\n\nCultural riches: The state boasts a rich cultural heritage, including historic towns with modern museums, charming villages with half-timbered houses, marvellous churches, medieval monasteries, grand palaces, elegant gardens and hundreds of castles.\n\nWine and food: Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg is one of Germanyâs top wine-producing regions. If youâre a wine enthusiast, itâs possible to tour vineyards, attend wine festivals and sample some of the best wines in the country. The regionâs gastronomy is also considered one of Germanyâs finest.\n\nGerman roads: Germany is famous for its quality roads, and road-tripping in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg certainly lives up to the hype. You can easily get anywhere (fast!) with four wheels here â including some very scenic drives in the Black Forest.\n\nMap\n\nBaden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the southwesternmost state in Germany, borders the German states of Rheinland-Pfalz, Hessen and Bavaria.\n\nIt also shares its western border with Franceâs Alsace region and its southern border with Switzerland.\n\nThis unique location creates a cultural blend enriched by its neighbouring regions; full of culture, history and diverse landscapes.\n\nStuttgart is Baden-WÃ¼rttembergâs capital city (and Germanyâs fourth-largest metropolitan area).\n\nWhat to do in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\n\nWhat to do in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg?\n\nDuring our time in the state, our road trip itinerary took us to some amazing destinations including a legendary spa town, an even more legendary forest, one of Germanyâs prettiest (and most tropical-looking!) waterfalls, the origin of the Danube, a relaxing lake and a dynamic, historic town full of innovative thinking.\n\nWe truly hope youâll have as good of a time as we did exploring this beautiful corner of the country.\n\nThe 10 best things to do and see in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg:\n\nTake a bath in Baden-Baden\n\nDiscover Schwarzwald (the Black Forest)\n\nCount the waterfalls at Allerheiligen-WasserfÃ¤lle\n\nVisit the origin of the Danube in Donaueschingen\n\nRelax at the shores of Titisee\n\nGo on an E-boat trip on Titisee\n\nExplore historical Freiburg im Breisgau\n\nWitness the miracle of Freiburg Minster\n\nExperience Freiburg from above\n\nGet green inspiration in the neighbourhood of Vauban\n\n1. Take a bath in Baden-Baden\n\nArriving in Baden-Baden, it quickly becomes apparent that this town is full of wealth.\n\nThe elegant architecture seamlessly blends into the hills, and the air is filled with a certain sense of opulence and relaxation.\n\nâBadenâ means âbathingâ, and bathing is certainly something you can do in Baden-Baden.\n\nBeing a part of the transnational UNESCO World Heritage Site called âGreat Spa Towns of Europe,â Baden-Baden holds a distinguished place among the worldâs historic spa destinations, celebrated for its cultural and wellness significance.\n\nSome of the townâs most famous spas are the Friedrichsbad Spa (built in Renaissance style) and the Caracalla Spa.\n\nWhere to stay in Baden-Baden?\n\nWe stayed at Heliopark Bad Hotel zum Hirsch in the middle of Baden-Baden.\n\nThe sophisticated hotel has an old-world vibe, perfectly fitting that of the town.\n\nCheck prices and availability at Heliopark Bad Hotel zum Hirsch here (adlink).\n\n2. Discover Schwarzwald (the Black Forest)\n\nThe first word that most often comes to mind when people think of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg is the legendary Schwarzwald; the Black Forest.\n\nAnd no, the forest isnât black per se. The name comes from the denseness of the trees making the forest appear black when seen from a distance.\n\nCome closer though, and youâll discover a wide variety of colours â especially if you visit in spring and early summer when the wildflowers are blooming.\n\nHiking and biking are perfect here during spring, summer and autumn, while winter transforms the Black Forest into a skiing destination with cross-country skiing and downhill runs.\n\nHow to best experience Schwarzwald?\n\nOne of the best ways to experience Schwarzwald is to drive along the windy Black Forest High Road (B500) going south from Baden-Baden.\n\nHere youâll have plenty of opportunities to catch the expansive vistas from roadside viewpoints or to park your car and go on one of numerous hikes.\n\n3. Count the waterfalls at Allerheiligen-WasserfÃ¤lle\n\nLocated at the edge of Nationalpark Schwarzwald, Allerheiligen-WasserfÃ¤lle (All Saints Waterfalls) are the largest natural waterfalls in the northern Black Forest and a true highlight of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.\n\nThe Grindenbach (Lierbach stream) tumbles down in a series of seven natural waterfall tiers, creating a total descent of 83 meters.\n\nNot only are each of the waterfalls beautiful; the path between the falls is also a wonderful hike in and of itself.\n\nWe unfortunately missed that the ruins of Kloster Allerheiligen (All Saintsâ Abbey) is located near the entrance to the waterfalls.\n\n4. Visit the origin of the Danube in Donaueschingen\n\nOn our road trip through Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, we visited the small town of Donaueschingen after having explored the Black Forest.\n\nDonaueschingen is a typical Schwarzwald village.\n\nDonau is the German word for the Danube â Europeâs second-longest river which originates here.\n\nAfter having travelled east through most of Central and Southeastern Europe (passing 4 capital cities on its way!), the Danube River flows into the Black Sea.\n\n(That the river originates here at the edges of the Black Forest is just a naming coincidence.)\n\nWhere to stay in Donaueschingen?\n\nWe stayed at Flair Hotel GrÃ¼ner Baum in Donaueschingen â a quaint family-run hotel just outside of the city centre.\n\nFor dinner, we had a four-course vegan menu with local, seasonal produce. Kudos to the chef!\n\nCheck prices and availability at Flair Hotel GrÃ¼ner Baum here (adlink).\n\n5. Relax at the shores of Titisee\n\nEach summer, Titisee in the south of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg truly comes alive as locals and tourists alike flock to the lakeâs shores for swimming, sailing, hiking and leisurely strolls along the promenade.\n\nThe spa town of the same name is located on the lakeâs northern shores. Here youâll find all kinds of health hotels and wellness treatments including various forms of therapy and massages.\n\nIf you visit Titisee outside of the high season, you can still enjoy the townâs many health facilities or go for a circular hike around the lake (with a distance of about 6 kilometres).\n\n6. Go on an E-boat trip on Titisee\n\nElectric cars, E-scooters, E-bikesâ¦ And E-boats?\n\nWe must admit we didnât know E-boats existed before we tried sailing one on Titisee.\n\nIt was a clear, sunny day â absolutely ideal for cruising on the water.\n\nThe surrounding green hills made the perfect backdrop to the still water, which we silently glided over with no noise from the electric engine.\n\nKnowing that our leisure cruise didnât pollute the pristine lake made it an even better experience.\n\nWe rented the E-yacht from Drubba Bootsvermietung & Rundfahrten Titisee, located at the promenade on the northeastern shore.\n\n7. Explore historical Freiburg im Breisgau\n\nBeing known as one of the sunniest cities in Germany, Freiburg im Breisgau (usually just called Freiburg) perfectly blends the experience of Southern Europe with Germanyâs culture and atmosphere.\n\nBaden-WÃ¼rttembergs 4th largest city is a popular university town, bustling with modern culture and progressive thinking â all in a place full of history.\n\nIn the beautiful Old Town (Freiburgâs city centre), it felt like there were young people enjoying life on every street and corner.\n\nPerhaps we visited on some especially lucky days, who knowsâ¦ But it really seemed like an amazing place to live with lots of creative and happy energy in the air.\n\nFreiburg is not to be missed.\n\nWhere to stay in Freiburg?\n\nWe (fittingly) stayed at Hotel Alex (adlink), located close to both Old Town and the central station.\n\nThe hotel was very modern and our room had all of the facilities one might expect.\n\nCheck prices and availability at Hotel Alex here (adlink).\n\n8. Witness the miracle of Freiburg Minster\n\nFreiburg Minster (also called Freiburg MÃ¼nster or The Cathedral of Our Lady) is the cathedral of Freiburg.\n\nMost of the builders of the cathedral never saw their work completed as the construction took over 300 years â finishing in the year 1513.\n\nRemarkably, most of the surrounding buildings were destroyed by bombs during World War II â but Freiburg Minster luckily survived. If thatâs not divine intervention, we donât know what is!\n\nA market with local produce is held on the market square in front of the church every day (except on Sundays).\n\n9. Experience Freiburg from above\n\nThereâs no better place to get an overview of Freiburg than from the Schlossberg (Castle Hill) just east of the Old Town.\n\nWhile there are no castles up here anymore, there are some remaining fortifications from ages past that have been uncovered.\n\nThe real star of the show, however, is the much more modern Schlossbergturm (turm meaning tower).\n\nAfter having scaled the stairs of the 35-metre tall tower, youâll get unparalleled views over Freiburg located about 200 metres below.\n\nHiking up here is definitely doable, but if you want to conserve your breath for those last stairs of the tower, itâs also possible to go with the Schlossbergbahn (Castle Hill Railway) at least a part of the way.\n\n10. Get green inspiration in the neighbourhood of Vauban\n\nAlthough itâs not full of actual touristy âthings to doâ, visiting the neighbourhood of Vauban (located to the southwest of Freiburgâs centre) is still one of the most interesting things to experience in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.\n\nVauban, established on the grounds of a former French military base, was conceived as a pioneering âsustainable model district,â welcoming its first residents in 2001.\n\nSince then, Vauban has become internationally known as a pioneering example of environmentally conscious urban living.\n\nââA while before going here, Alex had read about Vauban in a sustainability-focused book where Vauban was highlighted as a way to build the cities of the future, so it was really cool to experience it in person.\n\nTip: In the spirit of Vauban, we encourage you to visit the neighbourhood by public transport. Getting here from Freiburgâs Old Town only takes around 12 minutes by tram.\n\nRoad trip itinerary inspiration\n\nWhether you spend a weekend, a week or more exploring Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, you definitely wonât find a shortage of things to do.\n\nTo explore all of the destinations mentioned in this travel guide on a road trip, we recommend you spend at least 3 nights.\n\nThat way, you will be able to wake up in both Baden-Baden and Freiburg. Either spend two nights in one of the two or spend an extra night in between (like in Donaueschingen).\n\nThis road trip itinerary can also easily be stretched to fit a week.\n\nBoth Baden-Baden and Freiburg are interesting places to stay in their own right while also being great bases to explore the region (and the Black Forest!).\n\nHow to get around Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\n\nWe travelled around Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg by car and it was super convenient.\n\nParking is usually easy to find and often free of charge â except in city centres of larger cities (like Baden-Baden and Freiburg).\n\nIn the case of paid parking, remember to always bring euro coins for the machines as credit cards arenât accepted everywhere.\n\nIf you donât have your own wheels, itâs definitely also possible to travel around the state by public transport.\n\nHow to get to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\n\nBy car\n\nItâs easy to reach Germany by car from other countries in Europe as there are lots of motorways connected to neighbouring countries.\n\nAs soon as you are in Germany, you can get to the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg via Germanyâs famous autobahn (motorway).\n\nBe aware that cars on the autobahn generally drive fast â and by fast, we mean up to 200 km/h!\n\nThere are several sections with no speed limit at all so itâs important to look thoroughly in the rearview mirror and side mirror before changing lanes and overtaking.\n\nBy train\n\nThe train network in Germany is extensive, relatively cheap and very reliable.\n\nBaden-WÃ¼rttembergâs largest train stations are Stuttgart Hbf and Karlsruhe Hbf.\n\nFor the locations mentioned in this travel guide, travelling into Baden-Baden, Donaueschingen or Freiburg im Breisgau makes the most sense.\n\nWe have previously used the Deutsche Bahn website to order train tickets.\n\nBy plane\n\nTo get to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in Germany by plane, we recommend either flying into Stuttgart Airport (Flughafen Stuttgart) or Baden-Baden Airport (Flughafen Karlsruhe/Baden-Baden).\n\nLocated in Stuttgart, the stateâs capital, Stuttgart Airport is the largest and busiest airport in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. It serves as a major international gateway to the region and offers a wide range of domestic and international flights.\n\nBaden-Baden Airport primarily handles low-cost and charter flights. Itâs a convenient option for you if youâre looking to explore the Black Forest and the surrounding area.\n\nFor visiting the south of the state (like Freiburg, Titisee and Donaueschingen), consider flying into Basel or ZÃ¼rich in Switzerland.\n\nUse our adlink to find the cheapest tickets: Search for the cheapest flight tickets on Momondo.\n\nWhen to visit Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\n\nThere is really no bad time to visit the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. Each season just offers its own charms.\n\nSo when is the best time to travel to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg?\n\nWe were there ourselves in June and enjoyed warm, perfect summer days.\n\nLike almost all tourist destinations in the world, itâs wise to plan your trip around the most common holidays and instead visit in shoulder periods (if possible).\n\nThat way you can avoid any tourist crowds and generally get cheaper accommodation and save on car rentals.\n\nIf itâs not possible to travel outside the holidays, fortunately, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg doesnât really get crowded.\n\nSeasons\n\nSpring (March, April and May) is a beautiful time to visit Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg with sunny days and blooming flowers. The weather starts to warm up, although it can still be a bit chilly at times. Itâs a great time to visit if you enjoy milder temperatures and seeing nature come back to life after the winter.\n\nSummer (June, July and August) is the hottest season of the year, with July and August seeing the highest temperatures. However, itâs worth noting that summer is also the rainiest season, so packing a rain jacket or umbrella is a good idea. The sun is usually shining from early morning until very late in the evening. The summer holidays in Germany are spread out between mid-June and mid-September.\n\nAutumn (September, October and November) is a wonderful time to visit Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg. The landscape comes alive with vibrant shades of yellow, orange, and red as the leaves change colour. The most breathtaking autumn foliage usually appears towards the end of September and throughout October, and you might still catch some of this beauty in early November before the leaves fall off the trees.\n\nWinter (December, January and February) offers a quieter and less crowded experience. Just be prepared for colder temperatures and the possibility of snow, especially in the higher elevations of the Black Forest. If youâre planning to visit during Christmas or New Year, itâs smart to book your accommodation ahead of time.\n\nOur best tips for visiting Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\n\nCredit cards can be used in most shops, but as in the rest of Germany, cash is still often used and itâs not unusual for cash to be used in parking and ticket machines, at cafÃ©s and the like.\n\nGet up early and be one of the first at an attraction if you want to avoid crowds in the high season.\n\nDrink tap water. Itâs not only good for the planet, itâs also good for your wallet. The tap water in Germany is absolutely safe to drink â so bring a refillable bottle.\n\nTravel to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg outside of the holidays. Accommodation prices are lower, good deals are easier to find and there are fewer tourists.\n\nWhat to bring to Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg\n\nTravel insurance (adlink). Never travel without it!\n\nA good camera â hereâs a guide to the gear we use.\n\nSunscreen (adlink). Especially if you visit Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg in summer. We recommend that you use an organic, vegan sunscreen without oxybenzone and other harmful chemicals.\n\nHiking shoes, sneakers or other shoes you can walk in comfortably.\n\nSwimwear and a towel if you plan to swim in the summer or if you are staying at a hotel with a spa area.\n\nA refillable water bottle and snacks. You can drink the tap water in Germany.\n\nCash for parking and other small purchases, especially 1 and 2-euro coins. Not all places in Germany accept credit cards.\n\nSustainable travel tips\n\nTo travel as sustainably as possible, we recommend the following:\n\nBring your own drinking water in a refillable bottle.\n\nAvoid single-use plastics.\n\nDispose of waste properly and do not throw it on the ground.\n\nTake only photos, leave only footprints. Let everything stay in its natural place.\n\nRespect wildlife.\n\nWhat do you think of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg?\n\nThanks for reading our take on the best things to do in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg!\n\nWe hope this travel guide to the German state has been useful.\n\nWhat do you think of Germanyâs sunny southwest?\n\nIf you have been to the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, it would be great to hear about your best memories and what you did in the area.\n\nAnd if you havenât been there yet, donât hesitate to ask us anything in the comments.
