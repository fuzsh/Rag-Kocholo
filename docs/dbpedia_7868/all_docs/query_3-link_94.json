        "text": "Hinterland festival returned to Saint Charles, IA for another year full of live music.\n\nThis year's event featured some big names in the indie/folk/alternative space. Artists like Vampire Weekend, Noah Kahan, and Hozier headlined each night of the festival.\n\nThe latter's set proved to be a big draw for event officials.\n\nHozier at Hinterland\n\nThe Irish singer returned to the festival for the second time. He made an appearance at the music festival in 2019.\n\nIn 2024, he headlined the Hinterland music festival on Friday, August 2nd.\n\nOther prominent performers who took to the stage included Josiah and the Bonneviles, The Last Dinner Party, Sam Barber, Hippo Campus, and Orville Peck.\n\nWhile the festival goers were singing and dancing along to these stellar artists, the energy in the crowd shifted completely at 9:30 PM when Hozier and his band took to the stage.\n\nThe night before, they were performing at Lalapalooza in Chicago.\n\nFriday was an incredibly hot Iowa summer day. Temperatures were in the 90s with humidity that you could almost swim in.\n\nAfter singing a few songs Hozier swept aside his long hair and remarked to the thousands of people in the crowd, \"...you guys left the heating on.\"\n\n\"You guys must be built for this heat. When you go on vacation, do you go to the surface of the sun?\"\n\nEven with this suffocating heat, the show went on.\n\nAnd it was phenomenal!\n\nOne of my favorite moments from his set involved an unreleased song that had been trending on social media.\n\nEntitled 'Nobody's Solder,' the song details the feeling of witnessing global violence in the digital age, while feeling helpless to do something about it. Hozier described it in an interview as having \"anti-war vibes.\"\n\nThere is no word on when the song is set to be officially released to the public. Hozier continues to say that the song will drop \"soon.\"\n\nWatch a clip from the performance down below.\n\nStay up to date with everything going on in Eastern Iowa by downloading the free station app from your app store.\n\nAlso, do not forget to follow the station across all social media platforms for the latest news and entertainment updates."
