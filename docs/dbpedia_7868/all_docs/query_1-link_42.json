        "text": "While performing at KROQ's 28th annual acoustic Christmas show in Los Angeles on Saturday (Dec. 9), Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme kicked a female photographer in the face while returning to the stage from the catwalk. Video of the incident was captured and posted on the photograper's Instagram page and Homme has since issued two apologies, one as a statement and the other in the form of a video.\n\n“It was obviously very intentional,” Lauren, who works for Shutterstock, told Variety in the wake of the incident which required a trip to the emergency room. “Josh was coming over and I was pretty excited, I’ve never actually photographed Queens Of The Stone Age before, I was really looking forward to it. I saw him coming over and I was shooting away. The next thing I know his foot connects with my camera and my camera connects with my face, really hard. He looked straight at me, swung his leg back pretty hard and full-blown kicked me in the face.\"\n\nA video of what took place Saturday, which was during a multi-band holiday concert for a local radio station, can be seen below, as well as Lauren's photos taken just before Homme kicked her camera. In an update posted to the photgrapher's Instagram, Lauren says she was released from the hospital and is fine save for a sore neck, bruised eyebrow and nauseousness.\n\n\"Hello, last night at a Queens of the Stone Age performance I kicked the camera of a photographer and that camera hit a photographer in the face and that photographer's name is Chelsea Lauren. I'd just like to apologize to Chelsea Lauren. I don't have any excuse or reason to justify what I did — I was a total dick and I'm truly sorry and I hope you're okay. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life and last night was definitely one of them and I apologize for that to you,\" the frontman said in an apology video (seen below).\n\n\"I want to be a good man but last night I think I definitely failed at that. That means I failed my family and my friends as well. I don't want them to ever be ashamed or embarrassed about being around me or knowing me,\" continued Homme. \"So I apologize also to my bandmates and my mom and my dad, my wife, my brother and my kids. I'm gonna have to figure out some stuff, I think, because rock 'n' roll is a wonderful thing. It's supposed to save and help people not mess them up. So, Chelsea Lauren, I hope you're okay and I'm truly sorry. I understand you have to do whatever you have to do, I just want you to know that I'm sorry. Goodnight. Godspeed.\"\n\nThe video apology came hours after an initial statement was made. “Last night, while in a state of being lost in performance, I kicked over various lighting and equipment on our stage,” the statement began. “Today it was brought to my attention that this included a camera held by photographer Chelsea Lauren. I did not mean for that to happen and I am very sorry. I would never intentionally cause harm to anyone working at or attending one of our shows and I hope Chelsea will accept my sincere apology.” Upon release, these words drew harsh criticism from the online community, which presumably prompted Homme's video follow-up.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age will continue to promote their latest album, Villains, into 2018 with a handful of U.S. dates in Jan. and Feb. and more dates scattered over the next couple months.
