        "text": "Queens Of The Stone Age / Beaver - \"Split 10-Inch\" 10-Inch Vinyl EP.\n\nOriginal 1998 US-issue 4-track Limited Edition, Peppermint-Green Marbled Vinyl 10-Inch on Man's Ruin Records.\n\nGenuine original copy, Complete with the original double-sided fold-out sleeve.\n\nClassic \"Stoner Rock\" on Mans Ruin - with 2 tracks from Josh Homme's Queens Of The Stone Age and 2 tracks from Dutch band Beaver.\n\nThis original official edition was limited to just 2000 copies in total.\n\nImmaculate condition all round (See detailed gradings below).\n\nAll \"as new\" - you simply won't find a better original copy !!\n\nCatalog Number - MR 141.\n\nI have a few other similar items on auction at the moment -\n\nCheck out my other items!\n\nPart of a huge collection for sale in the next 12 months and beyond!\n\nTracklist :-\n\nQOTSA - The Bronze / These Aren't The Droids You're Looking For\n\nBeaver - Abscence Without Leave / Morocco\n\nCondition :-\n\nVinyl - EX Plus\n\n- All pretty much clean and unmarked.

No wear, writing or sticker marks. No fading. No spindle marks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUK Shipping :-\n\n3.30 GBP\n\nThese shipping costs are adjusted to reflect a small increase in UK Royal Mail prices from April 30 2012 - However, there is some good news as well !!\n\nDue to changes in the Royal Mail domestic weight bandings which come in to force at the same time, it now costs the same to ship two LP/12\" records as it does for one, so the \"additional item\" rates are as follows :-\n\nAdditional LP/12\" in the same package :-\n\n**** 2nd LP/12\" in the same package = FREE ****\n\n(Total of) 3 x LP/12\" = 4.50\n\n(Total of) 4 to 7 LP/12\" = 6.40\n\n(Total of) 8 to 15 LP/12\" = 9.90\n\n(Note - Double LP's (and items with unusually heavy packaging!) count as two additional - Triples as three additional, and so on). Royal Mail \"Second Class Standard\" service is used. If you require a different service, please request it before paying for your item(s), so the cost can be adjusted accordingly.\n\nWhere the total value of your shipment is 45 GBP or more, Recorded Delivery must be used (additional 95p flat rate per package).\n\nPlease wait for your payment total to be adjusted if the total value of your item(s) is 45 GBP or more.\n\nNon-UK Shipping :-\n\nThese shipping costs are adjusted to reflect a substantial increase in UK Royal Mail international shipping prices from April 30 2012.\n\nEurope = 5.30 GBP\n\nUSA/Canada = 7.75 GBP\n\nAsia (incl. Japan) = 7.75 GBP\n\nAustralia/NZ = 8.00 GBP\n\nExtra LP's/12-inch at the following rates :-\n\nEurope = 1.25 GBP each\n\nUSA/Canada = 2.50 GBP each\n\nAsia (inc. Japan) = 2.50 GBP each\n\nAustralia/NZ = 2.60 GBP each.\n\n(Note - Double LP's (and items with unusually heavy packaging!) count as two additional - Triples as three additional, and so on).\n\nWhere the total value of your shipment is 45 GBP or more, Signed-For/Confirmed/Recorded Delivery must be used (additional 5.60 GBP).\n\nPlease wait for your payment amount to be adjusted if the total value of your item(s) is 45 GBP or more.\n\nWhere the total weight of your shipment is 2 KG or more, (normally the max. for this weight is 6 or 7 LP/12-inch)\n\n- it will need to be split into 2 separate shipments - or shipped via courier - as the UK Royal Mail does not currently offer a reasonably-priced Shipping Service for such parcels. These shipments will be charged/quoted \"at cost\" when required.\n\nBuyers From OUTSIDE The European Union (EU) â€“ Please Note:\n\n- Any Import Duties, Taxes and associated Charges levied by your country are not included in the item price or P&P charges. These charges are the buyer's responsibility.\n\n- Please check with your country's customs authorities to determine whether these charges may apply (and what they will be) prior to bidding/buying.\n\n- These charges are normally collected by the courier company (or when you pick the package up). Do not confuse them for additional P&P charges.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPayment :-\n\nPaypal, Cheque, Postal Order or Bank Transfer.\n\nCheques must be in Pounds Sterling (GBP), and drawn on a UK bank.\n\nPlease Pay within 7 days of the auction close.\n\nI reserve the right to Re-List or Re-Offer the item if payment is not made within a reasonable time.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDespatch and Packing :-\n\nAll items are normally posted within 48 hours of receiving payment.\n\nWhere payment is by Cheque (or Paypal's eCheque), items will not be despatched until the cheque has cleared.\n\nPurpose-designed mailing/packaging materials will be used.\n\nYour record(s) will be well protected against the rigours of normal handling/shipping, including getting wet in the rain!\n\nAll records are packed outside of their main packaging (in a new plain inner where necessary), to avoid sleeve splits in transit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGradings :-\n\nI use the UK \"Record Collector Magazine\" grading system for vinyl.\n\nFor those not familiar with this standard, it's reproduced here on eBay :-\n\nhttp://reviews.ebay.co.uk/VINYL-RECORD-GRADING-GUIDE_W0QQugidZ10000000001916909\n\nVinyl Gradings are visual unless otherwise stated.\n\nItems are graded honestly and conservatively - I know how it feels to get overgraded stuff through the mail !\n\nBid with confidence.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhotos :-\n\nAll photos in this listing are of the actual item for sale.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther Information :-\n\n- To be fair to everyone who may want to place a bid, I don't end auctions early.\n\n- Sorry, I don't have audio files (MP3's, WAV's etc) to trade or share.\n\nCheck out my other items!\n\nBe sure to add me to your favourites list!"
