        "text": "After five years off the road, bassist Michael Shuman of Queens of the Stone Age says it feels fantastic to get back on tour again.\n\n“I think we’re having the most fun we’ve ever had together,” he says. “Having the most fun on stage together. And yeah, you don’t realize it ’til it’s gone.\n\n“But when you take away that side of us, you do take away part of our identity as individuals and as a band,” Shuman says on a recent phone call. “So to get that back, I feel like myself. I feel a little more whole.”\n\nQueens of the Stone Age will play its 68th show of 2023 when the End Is Nero Tour reaches the Kia Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, Dec. 16. The British band Spiritualized opens the show, and before that, Queens Colosseum, a pre-show party on the Forum grounds, delivers includes burlesque curated by Kitty Lane and friends from Jumbo’s Clown Room, carnival games, flash tattoos, live music and more.\n\nYet while things might be great now – “In Times New Roman…” the band’s eighth studio album in June is up for a pair of Grammys – it wasn’t always clear when or if the band would make it out of the studio and back on the road, Shuman says.\n\n“Making the record was not easy for us,” he says. “It was a hard one to make. So I’m just glad we’re out of that part of it, and just back to laughing with each other and playing with each other.”\n\n‘That perfect moment’\n\nSinger-guitarist Josh Homme, who founded the band in 1996, is the sole member to have been in the band ever since. But guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen joined in 2002, Shuman and multi-instrumentalist Dean Fertita five years later, and drummer Jon Theodore in 2013.\n\nIt’s a consistency born not just of musical kinship but genuine friendship, Shuman says.\n\n“Most bands are not as fortunate as us to be so close-knit, and to like each other and want to hang out with each other all the time,” he says. “I mean, a lot of bands either are fighting on the road, or if they’re a big band, have lots of dough, they get their individual cars and get the (bleep) out of the venue the minute the show’s done.\n\n“But we’re eating together. We’re walking together. We’re hanging out together. We don’t soundcheck a lot anymore, so we get to enjoy the day together. And it’s basically us just sitting in a room, talking (bleep) and laughing with other.”\n\nEven now, there’s a thrilling moment that comes each night at the threshold of the stage, he says.\n\n“There’s something which we’ve discussed as a band, that moment right before you go out on stage,” Shuman says. “When kind of the possibilities are endless and you haven’t (bleeped) anything up yet. The crowd is so excited.\n\n“It’s just that perfect moment,” he says. “Things could go wrong on stage. And that’s what we like, too, that we never know what’s going to happen. We like a little danger up there, and that it could all collapse at any moment.”\n\n‘The weight in the room’\n\nFive or six months after the pandemic started, as Queens entered the studio to make its next album, a different threat of collapse loomed over the band.\n\n“There were moments during this record where I was like, ‘I don’t know if we’re gonna finish this thing. I don’t know if we’re gonna be able to go on tour,’” Shuman says. “We all were just dealing with a lot of personal stuff, and you could feel the weight in the room.\n\n“Not saying we weren’t having a great time, but when it was difficult, it was the worst (stuff) ever,” he says. “And you’re trying to support each other, but sometimes there’s nothing you can do.\n\nShuman declined to talk about the personal elements, but it is public knowledge that Homme spent several years in a bitter divorce and custody battle with the Australian singer Brody Dalle, which overlapped with the start of recording and the year-long hiatus before Homme and Shuman went back in the studio to do the album’s vocals.\n\n“We did about 35 days straight, just me and him and our engineer,” Shuman says. “And even though we’re brothers, it was an even deeper bonding experience. I think that’s why it’s such a special record, but I don’t ever want to make a record like that again.\n\n“Every record we make actually, we’re like, ‘Please, can we have fun next time?’” he says. “And then it’s always a (bleepin’) nightmare. But yeah, I’m proud of the record. It’s not a modern rock record, that’s for sure. And that’s what I think we pride ourselves in, too. Taking risks.”\n\n‘It keeps Queens fresh’\n\nUnlike some bands, Queens of the Stone Age has always embraced the opportunity to mix things up. Early on, that often was reflected in the changing lineups Homme put together. Former members Nick Oliveri and the late Mark Lanegan used to share lead vocals with Homme, and albums often featured guest artists.\n\nAt other times, that’s taken the shape of side projects. Homme plays at times with Eagles of Death Metal, records guest artist collections under the name The Desert Sessions, and also formed the supergroup Them Crooked Vultures with Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl and Led Zeppelin’s John Paul Jones.\n\nHe also did the music for the 2017 German film “In The Fade,” which took its English title from a Queens song and won the Golden Globe for best foreign language film.\n\nShuman has recorded and played with the group Mini Mansions and currently has a solo project called GLU. Fertita formed the Dead Weather with Jack White and the Kills’ Alison Mosshart. He and Homme recorded with Iggy Pop on the album “Post Pop Depression.” Van Leeuwen joined Homme as part of Pop’s band on that tour and has also toured with Eagles of Death Metal and the Damned among others.\n\n“It keeps Queens fresh,” Shuman says. “When we come back home, it’s exciting and hopefully everyone’s gone and learned from these other experiences and musical endeavors. And hopefully brought some other knowledge back to the band and can share that in the next record we make.\n\n“Again, our music is really diverse,” he says. “A lot of people think of us just like a hard rock band. Which is like, ‘Well, maybe you haven’t listened to all the records.’\n\n“We need that as musicians, as human beings, to have other outlets,” he says. “I think it’s important. Now, does it sometimes get in the way? Yes. And although Queens is our priority, I think overall it’s healthy for us. I feel like there would be some resentment if you didn’t get certain things out of your system.”\n\n‘Being true to yourself’\n\nSeventeen years into his life with Queens, Shuman says the band has remained true to its essence, while also experiencing small points of change.\n\nThe thunder of early Queens of the Stone Age music has lifted on more recent albums due to a simple change: For the most part, they no longer record and write with instruments tuned to C, which typically gives chords a heavier sound, Shuman says.\n\nWhile Homme has always been the founder and leader of the band, that role gets more credit today from bandmates and fans alike, he adds.\n\n“I just think we’ve gotten bigger, too, which is crazy to me,” he says, noting that after shifting from a major label to the indie Matador Records, the band seemed to step up to a higher level of success. Shuman says he’s not entirely sure of the reasons why more than 30 years into the band’s life it continues to grow in size and success.\n\n“If I knew, I’d bottle it up,” he says. “The only thing I can think is that by being true to yourself – and I’ve learned this from watching Josh all these years – is that if we’re just true to ourselves it will be real to us and people will be able to see that, and be like, ‘Oh, I like that authenticity and I connect with that.’\n\n“I mean, I know that we’ll never be one of the biggest rock bands in the world, right?” Shuman says. “We’ll never get to that, and that’s OK. And we accept that we’re, in some ways, the underdogs of those rock bands left standing.”\n\nQueens of the Stone Age\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 16\n\nWhere: Kia Forum, 3900 W. Manchester Blvd., Inglewood\n\nHow much: $39.50-$129\n\nAlso: Queens Colosseum, a pre-show festival with burlesque performers, carny games, tattoos, and live music kicks off on the Forum grounds at 4 p.m. Saturday.\n\nFor more: See qotsa.com for information on the band, tour and tickets."
