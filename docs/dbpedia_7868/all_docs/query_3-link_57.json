Here is something you should drop to your knees for...and worship. But you're too stupid to realize yourselves. A song for the deaf that is for you.\n\nafter Song for the Deaf\n\nDJ (Dave Catching): You're listening to W-A-N-T, the high desert, wonder valley favorite radio station. It's been a good night. Dave Catching here. Not saying goodnight, just saying. Producer:\n\nEric Valentine produced the first cut of the album in late 2001. The band didn't like it, so they got Chris Goss to help them produce it themselves in 2002. From the Masters of Reality site (News update April 20):\n\nGoss has also been doing quite a bit of guitar and vocal recording along with Dave Grohl on new songs being cut for the still unfinished QOTSA lp \"Songs for the Deaf\". The Queen's have broken off their relationship with producer Eric Valentine...creative differences. Whatever the squabble was, we know that QOTSA did the right thing. Chris touts the new lp, \"I've never heard anything like it. Homme wants his dick sucked, and he deserves it. As a matter of fact, so do I.\"\n\nGuests:\n\nGene Ween - guitar on Six Shooters, Mosquito Song, and I'm Gonna Leave. Vox on Mosquito Song (?).\n\nPaz (from APC) - strings on Mosquito Song.\n\nAnna (Paz's sister) - strings on Mosquito Song.\n\nAlain Johannes (Eleven) - DJ on First It Giveth, and some of the following: E-bow, Organ on Another Love Song, Piano on Mosquito Song, Flamenco Guitar on Mosquito Song and First It Giveth (?), Theremin on Six Shooters, Lap Steel.\n\nNatasha Shneider (Eleven) - DJ on Song for the Deaf, and some of the following: E-bow, Organ on Another Love Song, Piano on Mosquito Song, Theremin on Six Shooters, Lap Steel.\n\nCasey Chaos (Amen) - KLONE radio DJ (?).\n\nProduction/Recording Dates:\n\nJuly 6, 2001 thru mid-August 2001 - pre-production; Song for the Deaf and two other tracks with Dave Grohl on drums (possibly Song for the Dead) recorded with Eric Valentine\n\nDecember 2001 - recording with Eric Valentine completed.\n\nsometime between January 2002 and March 2002 - QOTSA splits with Eric Valentine and gets Chris Goss to re-record and produce the album.\n\nend of April - recording with Chris Goss completed at Conway studios in Los Angeles.\n\nFirst Single:\n\nNo One Knows\n\n\"A few weeks ago the label informed the band that the raucous \"Millionaire\" would be the leadoff radio cut, then it became a tossup between that song, the tumbling but melodic \"First It Giveth_#1\" and the less rugged, hook-saturated \"No One Knows.\"\n\n'We were gonna get everyone with decision making power at the company to wear a T-shirt with one of the song titles on it,' joked singer/guitarist Josh Homme. 'Then we'd have them all fight in a big steel cage and whoever was left standing, the song on their shirt would be the single.'\" - from MTV news July 12, 2002.\n\nThe video for the song was shot in two parts: the first half on June 26 and 27, and the second half finished on July 15. Michel Gondry shot the video. Says Josh: \"Michel Gondry did all those videos for Björk, and we're huge fans of Björk and those videos, so we're excited.\" - from MTV news July 12, 2002.\n\nNME says the single will be released in October.\n\nPromos:\n\nSongs for the Deaf promo photos, stickers, etc. have been available at concerts since May 27, 2002.\n\nQOTSA will release a short story either before the album is out or with the album in a limited form (perhaps with the vinyl edition):\n\n\"Queens of the Stone Age have launched their comeback album by publishing a bizarre, decadent short story featuring the band snorting drugs off an air stewardess. In a nod to their druggy single Feel Good Hit Of The Summer, the in-flight menu in the story only serves \"nicotine, Valium, Vicodine, marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol\". The story is a promotional device in the style of a pulp fiction book that may be given away in some form with the album, according to sources.\" - from NME's Queens of the Story Age\n\nI'm Gonna Leave in Spanish\n\nNick said on the Radio 1 interview that there is such a track and that it will be a b-side, but Nick could be shitting everyone.\n\nA Limited Edition DVD with SftD:\n\nAccording to an add in the August issue of Guitar World, a limited edition DVD of will be sold with Songs for the Deaf. The DVD could be the March 7, 2002 show. The band recorded it with the intention of releasing it....\n\nLittle Sister:\n\nThis song was supposed to be on the album, but it's not on either version of the album that's surfaced so far. Will it be a b-side? Does it even exist? Who knows...."
