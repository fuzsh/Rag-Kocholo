Was this our Matt Cameron or just someone of the same name?\n\nnewwetkojak wrote:\n\nmatt cameron ( yes, THE matt cameron) was the original queens of the stone age drummer. actually, they weren't even qotsa yet, they recorded under the name gamma ray. i do know that there is an officially released recording, i think it was a split single with the last kyuss recordings (josh homme's pre-qotsa group). or maybe it was released as gamma ray. shit. i can't believe i don't know for sure or own this motherfucker. 99.99999% sure it was released on frank kozik's \"man's ruin\" record label. i think van conner from the screaming trees was the bassist at the time too."
