        "text": "via Blabbermouth\n\nKYUSS LIVES!, the project featuring three-quarters of KYUSS — the influential American stoner rock/metal band, originally from Palm Desert, California — will record a new studio album following its upcoming tour. The group features bassist Nick Olivieri, drummer Brant Bjork and singer John Garcia along with guitarist Bruno Fevery, who most recently played with Garcia in the GARCIA PLAYS KYUSS project.\n\nSpeaking to U.K.’s Rock Sound magazine, Garcia said, “Our rehearsals are going so well that we’re thinking of doing another record . . . Brant, Nick and myself have collectively agreed that once everything is done live and we’re done with our solo projects, we’re going to do another record.”\n\nRegarding why KYUSS guitarist and founding member Josh Homme is not involved in the reunion, Garcia told Rock Sound, “I have nothing bad to say about Josh — he’s extremely intelligent, very smart, a great guitar player, great songwriter, a great vocalist — he is a bad-ass, there is no question, and I love him dearly but he is busy with his own thing. He has THEM CROOKED VULTURES, QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, he’s a father, a businessman and even if we asked him to do it, I don’t think he’d say yes, so I don’t want to set myself up for a big fat no which is 99.9 percent what he would say.”\n\nKYUSS LIVES!will embark on Australian tour next May. A European tour will take place in March/April.\n\nOlivieri, Bjork and Garcia last played together when they reunited this past June for an appearance at the Hellfest, which took place in Clisson, France. Nick and Brant joined John on stage to perform the songs “Gardenia” and “Green Machine” during a headlining appearance by Garcia‘s GARCIA PLAYS KYUSS project. Video footage of that performance can be viewed below.\n\nKYUSS, the inventors of Desert Rock, have been in the last ten years much more popular than when they were still around in the early Nineties. So, due to massive public demand over the years to play songs from his old cult band KYUSS, John finally made the decision to give the fans what they want.\n\nThe last couple of years John Garcia thought often about reviving his KYUSS legacy on stage. The more he thought about it, the more he really wanted to do this. John commented: “I don’t want to do this just for myself, but especially for the fans. Both for the ones that have seen KYUSS live back in the days, and especially for the ones who haven’t had that chance. This could be as close as they could get to the real thing.”"
