        "text": "Fatso Jetson was formed in Palm Desert, CA, in 1994 and are often credited as one of the fathers of Desert Rock . Fatso Jetson incorporate a broad variety of musical influences that includes punk, blues, jazz and rock music. prone to experiment with many musical textures, angular instrumental epics, and bizarre lyrics to create a punk, blues art rock all their own.\n\nIn 1995, the group recorded their debut “Stinky Little Gods” and followed that up in 1997 with “Power of Three” — both discs appeared on SST Records.\n\nThe band then teamed up with Bongload Records (Beck) who then released thier third full-length disc, “Toasted”, in 1998. The album produced by Chris Goss (Masters of Reality, Queens of the Stone Age).\n\nThe fourth LP was “Flames for All” in 2000 for Artist Frank Kozik’s Mans Ruin Label . Fatso Jetson also contributed to “The Desert Sessions” releases that Josh Homme (Kyuss,Queens of the Stone Age) . At these sessions Mario Lalli co-wrote two songs with Homme (“You think I aint worth a dollar but I feel like a Millionaire” and “Monster in the Parosol”) these would eventualy make their way on to the Queens of the Stone Age albums “Rated R” and “Songs for the Deaf”.\n\nIt was Homme’s record lable Rekords Rekords that would release the next Fatso album in 2001 “Cruel and Delicious”. For this session the band was joined by Vince Meghrouni (Bazooka, Mike Watt, BellRays) on Sax and harp adding a new dimension to Fatso’s hard to pin sound.\n\nThe band continues with this line up in 2015.\n\nwww.fatsojetson.com\n\nInfluenced by everything from the psychedelic to the folkloric, jazz, hard rock, roots punk, world music, the sound of this trio while hard to describe is visual and cinematic , heavy and melancholy. driving & daydreaming.\n\nYawning Man are quite a different musical beast from those they inspired. Drawing heavily from the SST roster of artists which set the world ablaze in the 1980s – Black Flag, Minutemen, Meat Puppets – their music is caught in the nexus of surf, psychedelia, Krautrock and the Spaghetti Western soundscapes of Ennio Morricone. Or, if you will, a missing link between the worlds of Dick Dale, Syd’s ‘Floyd, instrumental Black Flag and Pell Mell.\n\nMore than twenty years later, Yawning Man still is going strong; not specifically the band itself as a name, but as that which inspired and drove the members thereof to do what they do, which is an innate drive to create and connect landscapes of the real to surreal- the end result being the beautiful, swirling and other-worldly music you know as Yawning Man.\n\nwww.yawningman.com\n\nPowder For Pigeons is an Australian/German two piece that was founded in 2012 in the dusty regional back drop of Western Australia.\n\nInspired by the rugged surroundings they have crafted a gigantic sound that fills the frequency spectrum with punchy, warm, low, fuzzy guitar riffery and thumpin drums to be heard for miles around.\n\nwww.facebook.com/PowderForPigeons\n\nArena Vienna / small hall / adv 14 € / doors 17 € / 20.00h"
