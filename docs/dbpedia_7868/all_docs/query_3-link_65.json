Photo by David Goggin.\n\nIggy Pop and Josh Homme began secretly working on the new album “Post Pop Depression” in early 2015 and recorded brass and strings at United Recording studios last April. The clandestine Pop and Homme self-financed recording was without a record label at the time and with no outside influences on the project.\n\nThe new album was produced by and features vocal and instrumental contributions from Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. Fellow band member Dean Fertita, as well as drummer Matt Helders of the Arctic Monkeys, also played on the album. Additional musicians included Danny T. Levine on valve trombone, trumpet, and marching French horn; Jordan Katz on trumpet; David Moyer on baritone sax, flute; Philip Blake Cooper on tuba; Eric Gorfain and Daphne Chen on violin; Lauren Chipman on viola, and Richard Dodd on cello.\n\nIggy Pop first reached out to Josh Homme by text message to ask if he was interested in writing music together. After they spoke by phone, Pop sent Homme some lyrics by mail, along with notes about Pop’s time working with David Bowie. Three months later, Homme sent lyrics to Pop, and they agreed to work together on recording songs in a studio. They brought incomplete ideas as opposed to finished songs, so that they could work on them together. Pop described the album as discussing issues of what happens when your utility is at an end, and dealing with your legacy.\n\nConsisting of nine songs, the album was recorded at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, California, over the course of two weeks, and another week at Pink Duck Studios in Burbank, California. Dean Fertita recorded guitar and keyboards, while Matt Helders recorded drum tracks. Brass and strings were recorded in United Recording’s renowned Studio A, which was designed and built by studio founder Bill Putnam in 1957.\n\n“Post Pop Depression” debuted at number 17 on the Billboard 200, making the album Iggy Pop’s highest charting in the US. The tour in support of the Loma Vista Recordings album began March 28 in Seattle, WA and runs through May 15 at Le Grand Rex in Paris, France.\n\nAbout United Recording\n\nUnited Recording was founded in 1957 by the legendary recording engineer and electronics inventor Bill Putnam with the backing of Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. The studios were acquired and renamed Ocean Way Recording in 1977, and after acquisition in 2013 by Hudson Pacific Properties, re-launched under the original name in 2014. United Recording, one of the world’s most recognized music recording studios, with more awards than any other recording enterprise, is responsible for record sales of more than one billion units.\n\nMore info: http://www.unitedrecordingstudios.com/"
