        "text": "ATLANTA (WANF/Gray News) - Ford Motor Company’s recall of the 2016-2022 Ford EcoSport and Focus 1.0L engines has put owners in a difficult position. Their cars have defective parts that could potentially ruin the engine, but the replacement parts will not be available for at least six months.\n\nAccording to the recall, “the oil-drive belt tensioner arm may fracture or separate, causing a loss of vehicle power and power braking assist, increasing the risk of a crash.”\n\nSeveral plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit in June 2023 alleging “the defect presents a serious safety hazard because it can cause catastrophic engine failure without warning while driving, lost motive power, and/or sudden limp mode activation, increasing the likelihood of a collision.\n\n“Moreover, because Ford is aware that the failures – which attract the owners’ notice – occur frequently, just outside the warranty, it is unfairly transferring the cost of the warranty repairs to unsuspecting consumers of the economy vehicles in which these engines are equipped,” the lawsuit said.\n\nVenessa Stevens has been dealing with the consequences for three months. Stevens was on her way to work when her 2019 Ford EcoSport’s warning lights came on.\n\n“It’s slowing down ever so slowly and slowly and slowly,” Stevens said. “My engine light pops up, but no, the oil light pops up. So I’m thinking I need an oil change.”\n\nFive Star Ford of Stone Mountain confirmed the parts listed in the recall failed.\n\nThen came the really bad news: the replacement parts weren’t available until early 2025. Stevens said a Ford Motor Company service representative advised her to ask the dealership for a loaner car, but Stevens said her dealership could not offer one.\n\n“They don’t give out loaner cars because they don’t know how long it will take for them to receive the part,” Stevens said.\n\nStevens was then forced to rely on friends, coworkers, ridesharing and rental cars. She said she’s spent $2,000, and says the worst part is not being able to get to her mother, who lives 300 miles away in South Carolina.\n\n“She’s 88 years old,” Stevens said. “She’s in full-on dementia. progressing; that’s where my fear lies, Not being able to get to her in a timely manner. She depends on me for everything, even though I’m here in Georgia, four hours away.”\n\nMaking matters worse, Stevens can’t afford to sell the car or trade it in because of its depreciated value. However, she is still required to make her monthly car payments and maintain insurance.\n\nFord Motor Company did not immediately respond to Atlanta News First Investigates. However, Stevens says on the day of the inquiry, she received a call from a Ford representative to ask if there was anything the company could do.\n\nFive Star Ford of Stone Mountain confirmed that Ford Motor Company had authorized a replacement engine.\n\nSince then, the dealership provided a loaner car, replaced the engine and returned the car three weeks later. Ford has since updated the recall on its website to include a replacement engine as an alternative.\n\nFord Motor Company says it updated its recall on June 9 (prior to Atlanta News First’s Investigation) to make the engine replacement alternative available.\n\n“If the engine in your vehicle fails due to a damaged oil pump belt and/or oil pump belt tensioner, Ford has authorized your dealer to replace the engine assembly as an interim repair before the availability of remedy parts for the final repair. This repair will be free of charge (parts and labor).”\n\nFord Motor Company also requested Stevens’ receipts for rideshares and rentals for reimbursement."
