        "text": "Rock beasts rarely come as urbane as Iggy Pop (68) and Josh Homme (42), producer of Pop’s 23rd record – his last major outing, Pop avers. Sure, Iggy invented punk in the late 60s, strutting and fretting over the brutalist guitar shapes of the Stooges, slashing his chest and ingesting more drugs than anyone bar Keith Richards. But you only need to tune into his 6 Music show to understand there is more to the man born James Osterberg than dissolute sinew, exposed in all weather.\n\nYou wouldn’t want to cross Homme, 6ft 5in of brooding six-string authority, superfan of Iggy’s Berlin period, benevolent dictator of a granite empire that includes Queens of the Stone Age, the Desert Sessions series, Arctic Monkeys productions and the Eagles of Death Metal (he is a non-touring member). Add in members of Homme’s extended bandwidth – QOTSA’s Dean Fertita and Monkey Matt Helders – and you have a record in which the last of the 70s Berlin roués (RIP David Bowie, Lou Reed) ponders his situation with a band primed to detonate – and slinkily, at that.\n\nThey don’t. Despite the pedigree of all involved, Post Pop Depression was never intended as a heavy rock record, Homme has revealed. Instead, the first track, Break Into Your Heart, virtually recalls Scott Walker strolling down a urine-stained alleyway, guided by brass.\n\nYou’d imagine a track called American Valhalla to be the apotheosis of louche sturm und drang. But it begins with a delicate East Asian melody and finds a rueful Osterberg searching for salvation, one cut to his size. “Is there anybody in there? Who do I have to kill?” he muses.\n\nThis album would be operatic, if opera were not trilled but drawled. Iggy’s erstwhile producer, Bowie, haunts it, even before his death. On Gardenia, Pop’s vocal is an echo chamber, channelling Bowie, channelling Pop. Even though some of these songs are less than the sum of their parts, it’s hard not to warm to a collaboration that comes up with a track as funky and modal as Sunday. “This house is as slick as a senator’s statement,” sneers Iggy."
