Them Crooked Vultures = amazingsauce and I thought they were going to put another LP together this year?\n\nHonestly, re-recording of an old album could be awesome. I want Trent to redo Pretty Hate Machine in a bad way. If not re-record it, at least clean it up so it sounds shiney. i am sure the \"die hards\" will think that saying something like this is blasphemy but what if the artist was not able to make the album to their standards because of restricted access to equipment due to funding or technology then why not let them redo it?\n\nAlso, Eagles of Death Metal anyone? The bassist is being treated for cancer and hopefully everything works out with him but there was an announcement of a new album in the works so who knows whats going on with that.\n\n0\n\nmorocka wrote:\n\nI believe it is a re-issue of their self titled debute. This has been promised for a while, finally happening. I don't know all the details, but I'm prettty sure it's been remastered. His comments seem to back that up. Lets hope we also get some bonus material.\n\nYea it's def the re-isse/re-master of self-titled, which I am very excited about. Now I can finally have my hands on a copy. I'll prolly get both CD and LP. Rumor is there will be some B-sides on it just like the Rated R deluxe CD which would be \"Spiders and Vinegaroons\" and \"These Aren't the Droids You're Looking For\" and \"The Bronze\"\n\nThere was an interview with Homme basically confirming this would be out by the end of the year/beginning of next.

It was an amazing show! The extended version of Scumbag Blues was the biggest highlight for me. Interlude with Ludes was amazing live, it gave me a whole new appreciation for that song.\n\nI haven't heard the new artic monkeys yet but I gonna check it out right now.

On it was a sticker that says...\n\nCOLLECTORS ITEM.\n\nThe record you hold in your mitts is one from the legendary LOST PALLET. The mystery has finally been solved: The CD's were discovered in a government warehouse in Seattle right next to the Lost Ark of the Covenant. This is one of the final remaining 8,000 of the original pressing. Brought to you by RekordsRekords. \"Nobody brings our music to you better than we do & that's our promise.\"\n\n...I was surprised to find it but didn't realize how rare it really was. Glad I bought it, that's for sure. The re-issue thing is cool but I'd be more interested in a new album with all new material.\n\nNot to be a downer but I thought Era Vulgaris pretty much sucked (save a few songs),...the best ones are self titled, Songs for the Deaf and Lullabies To Paralyze.\n\nHope to hear a new one soon.\n\n0\n\nI agree, Era Vulgaris is the weakest of all their Albums...but all the others are freakin sweet. I imagine there will be some b-sides included w/ the Re-issue of S/T as there were b-sides w/ the re-issue of Rated R. Most of their obscure shit can be found online via torrent sites...check out any of the Desert Sessions...all good shit\n\nMansfield, MA - Jul 02, 2003; Mansfield, MA - Jul 03, 2003; Mansfield, MA - Jul 11, 2003; Boston, MA - Sep 29, 2004; Reading, PA - Oct 01, 2004; Hartford, CT - May 13, 2006; Boston, MA - May 24, 2006; Boston, MA - May 25, 2006; Hartford, CT - Jun 27, 2008; Mansfield, MA - Jun 28, 2008; Mansfield, MA - June 30, 2008; Hartford, CT - May 15, 2010; Boston, MA - May 17, 2010; [EV - Providence, RI - June 15, 2011; EV - Hartford, CT - June 18, 2011]; Worcester, MA - Oct. 15, 2013; Worcester, MA - Oct. 16, 2013; Hartford, CT - Oct. 25, 2013; Boston, MA - August 5, 2016; Boston, MA - August 7, 2016...\n\n0\n\nLast month, Queens of the Stone Age reissued their landmark 2000 album Rated R and scored a Best New Reissue from us in the process. And later this year, the band will follow it up by reissuing their out-of-print 1998 self-titled debut, along with three extra tracks that were deleted from the original album. This is the album that Josh Homme and co. recorded soon after the breakup of their previous band, the legendary stoner-rock outfit Kyuss.\n\nThe QOTSA reissue arrives November 26, Black Friday, in a 180-gram double-gatefold colored vinyl edition with download. If you'd prefer the CD version by itself, that's coming December 7. QOTSA frontman Josh Homme is putting out the reissue on his own Rekords Rekords label, through a partnership with Mike Patton's Ipecac Recordings.

It's his own solo vehicle/outlet, and I love it. I love TCV too. I really would love to see them live. I've seen Queens several times, but seeing JH with Dave and JPJ on the same stage would make my head explode.\n\nGimli 1993\n\nFargo 2003\n\nWinnipeg 2005\n\nWinnipeg 2011\n\nSt. Paul 2014\n\n0\n\nPaul David wrote:\n\nthe disappointing part of the bonus tracks on Rated R is that they were all already on iTunes.

Vultures open for Queens Dave Grohl should just can Foo Fighters - IMO he's a better drummer than singer/guitar player - and be the permanent drummer for Queens...JPJ - shit, add him on there, trade him out whatever, its freakin JPJ!!! The other dude is already in the Queens....and Josh...yes indeed he needs to keep busy..like I mentioned earlier w/ his work w/ the Arctic Monkeys and not to mention Eagles of Death Metal..it seems like the guy just cant sit still - which is totally cool with me.\n\nMansfield, MA - Jul 02, 2003; Mansfield, MA - Jul 03, 2003; Mansfield, MA - Jul 11, 2003; Boston, MA - Sep 29, 2004; Reading, PA - Oct 01, 2004; Hartford, CT - May 13, 2006; Boston, MA - May 24, 2006; Boston, MA - May 25, 2006; Hartford, CT - Jun 27, 2008; Mansfield, MA - Jun 28, 2008; Mansfield, MA - June 30, 2008; Hartford, CT - May 15, 2010; Boston, MA - May 17, 2010; [EV - Providence, RI - June 15, 2011; EV - Hartford, CT - June 18, 2011]; Worcester, MA - Oct. 15, 2013; Worcester, MA - Oct. 16, 2013; Hartford, CT - Oct. 25, 2013; Boston, MA - August 5, 2016; Boston, MA - August 7, 2016...\n\n0\n\nDrop1The0Leash wrote:\n\nPaul David wrote:\n\nthe disappointing part of the bonus tracks on Rated R is that they were all already on iTunes.
