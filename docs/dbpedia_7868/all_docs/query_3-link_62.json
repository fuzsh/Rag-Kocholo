        "text": "The remarkable story of underground DJ icon, music producer and global trip hop mogul James Lavelle, who played his first DJ set at 14, launched pioneering record label Mo’Wax at 18 and released the genre defining UNKLE album Psyence Fiction at 22. Featuring DJ Shadow, 3D of Massive Attack, Futura, Ian Brown, Grandmaster Flash and Josh Homme, the documentary is built from over 700 hours of footage including exclusive personal archive spanning three decades.\n\nUnearthing the astronomic rise and unprecedented fall of an extraordinary man, The Man from Mo’Wax shines new light on one of the most enigmatic yet influential figures in British culture."
