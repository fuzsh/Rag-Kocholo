        "text": "Heaven & Hell – The Devil You Know\n\n2009\n\nRoadrunner\n\nReleased on 28th April 2009, The Devil You Know the debut and sole record of Heaven & Hell was met with critical acclaim from critics and long time Sabbath fans alike. Essentially, The Devil You Know is an un-official Black Sabbath record; the band consisting of Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice had sought to reform and tour with Iommi and Butler in particular keen but in the end finally tired of waiting for Ozzy. Iommi and Butler came to put their differences aside with Dio and even released a best of from the Dio years, recording three new tracks to boot. The newly reunited Sabbath with Dio felt they might even tour under the Sabbath name, however $haron Osbourne had other ideas and the band was instead named for after the seminal 1980 release of Sabbath’s Heaven and Hell, the first of course to feature the late great Ronnie James Dio as vocalist after the departure of a certain Mr. Osbourne. After a successful tour of Japan and over drinks and dinner according to Iommi “someone said “does anybody fancy writing a new album? and everybody replied with “yeah, that’s an idea, why don’t we do that?”. The album was recorded by the band at Rockfield Studios, Wales and was produced by the band. Speaking to Ultimate Guitar after the records release Iommi stated of the writing process; “we just wrote some material at my studio… continued to write some riffs and gather some other ideas placing them onto a CD. The other members did the same. When we finished writing [the record] in L.A. we went into the pre-production stage where we played everything live and just kept on playing that material until we got used to playing each song. When we went to Wales we could just enter the studio and play these songs… we could play them within the first two takes”.\n\nThe Devil You Know kicks off with “Atom and Evil” and any doubts longtime time Sabbath fans had of this particular reunion is quickly quashed with an excellent crushing Iommi riff backed by mid tempo drums from Appice and rumbling bass from Geezer. The track marauders along in a fiendish dirgy manner with a dissonant sounding bass underpinning an at odds sounding angelic chorus vocal from Dio before an impressive solo from Iommi. The track sounds rich and vibrant throughout and a memorable opener to the record. Next up is “Fear” beginning with a fairly frantic sounding riff from Iommi with Appice and Geezer laying down a heavy groove and Dio’s typical fantastical vocals and lyrics leading into a strong chorus section leading to another heroic guitar solo. This song screams “Heavy Metal” throughout and epitomizes everything great about the genre, then again, it’s no real surprise given the guitar player is the creator of Metal itself.\n\n“Bible Black” the one and only single from the record follows and it is, perhaps, the track that is most reminiscent of Heaven and Hell era Sabbath. Beginning with spare acoustic guitar and wailing electric overdubs accompanied by a solemn vocal by Dio; the track does a great job of building tension through the initial fist verse before an explosively heavy riff and ominous sounding walking bass leading into a memorable defiant chorus section with another devastating guitar solo from Iommi leading into a melodic bridge section before the tracks pessimistic conclusion. It’s no stretch to say that this is one of the best songs this group of musicians have ever written. Next up is “Double the Pain” beginning with gloriously ominous sounding layered bass leading into an impossibly heavy mid tempo section with a chugging main riff in the verse sections before then leading into a memorable pre and chorus section with Dio in his element (he excels throughout this record) with such fiendish lyrics as “a stab in the back, it worth waiting for tonight, he’s seen enough joy for today, a sudden attack, would just set the evening right and maybe a penance to pain”. This song features yet another stunning solo, a blistering nimble screamer which will destroy your speakers; that’s if they have survived the opening bass. An anthem of sorts for those who have suffered the track is a definite highlight of the record.\n\nNext up is “Rock and Roll Angel” beginning with a semi bluesy almost half time feel with an interesting staggered ballad like chorus section. The track is quite unlike what has come before and perhaps sounds slightly out of place as a result but it is a nice juxtaposition to the much darker material with a very bluesy sounding atmospheric bridge section and in all truth it is a track which doesn’t outstay it’s welcome. “The Turn of the Screw” follows beginning with a suitably doomy main riff before am almost semi poppy verse section then leading into a sing along fists-n-the-air chorus section. It is clear at this juncture that the band wanted to introduce some more experimental aspects to the records sound and they do just that rather successfully with the last couple of tracks. The fast “Eating the Cannibals” follows a track that screams “NWOBHM” and is all the better for it with a gun-metal main riff and it is the shortest track on the record; it’s brevity is a plus point as is it’s guitar solo and it has to be said that Tony Iommi has been on fire throughout this record, the man is just talented beyond belief.\n\n“Follow the Tears” is next up with an intro Slayer would be proud of with a cast iron metal riff anchoring the track throughout. The song feels like the inside of an oppressive metalworks and while the track may not be quite as good as what has come before, it is still a decent track with a beautiful vocal from Dio in the tracks midway point. “Neverwhere” begins with another suitably metal riff, however it is quite samey to what has come before. The track feels more like an extended jam then a fully coherent track and the band, with the previous tracks on the record, has already played these kind of cards before. Still, it’s hardly an awful piece of music and it’s a pretty inoffensive track overall. The Devil You Know ends with the epic “Breaking Into Heaven” a heavily wistful coda to Dio era Sabbath beginning with a heavy lumbering riff with soaring vocals from Dio in the chorus sections with an excellent middle section and solo from Iommi and the heavy doomy riff then relentlessly seeing out the tracks conclusion with Dio’s poignant refrain of “breaking into Heaven” concluding what has been an insanely heavy record.\n\nThe Devil You Know is something of an underrated gem. I personally feel the first half of the record is the strongest but the record as a whole is strong if not particularly innovative not that that was ever really the point; it’s a decent slab of traditional heavy metal and frankly anything that has Tony Iommi and Ronnie James Dio attached to it is going to be a quality product (insert Humanizer joke here if you wish just be glad it wasn’t with Ian Gillen). If you missed out on this record when it was released or just haven’t given it a listen in a while, do return to it again. This record is heavy and a dense listen throughout which requires the listener to pay attention in full. Ozzy may have come back to Sabbath with 2013’s 13 but The Devil You Know is Dio’s swan song; for that alone this record should be mandatory listening.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nGray, Robert.,(May 2009) Heaven and Hell’s Tony Iommi Discusses ‘The Devil You Know’, Ultimate Guitar.com\n\nThin Lizzy – Thin Lizzy\n\nDecca\n\n1971\n\nOn the 30th of April 1971, legendary Irish rockers Thin Lizzy released their debut studio album to generally favorable reviews. Casual fans of the band may point to 1973’s stunning Vagabonds of the Western World as the real starting point of the band, owning to the release before and around the same time of that record of the “Whiskey in the Jar” and “The Rocker” singles respectively. However, Lizzy had already been a going concern for over two years at that point and was slowly but surely honing their craft and while the twin guitar attack – the tried and true Lizzy template, would not appear until 1974’s Nightlife with the addition of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham, on Thin Lizzy there was more than enough evidence that this was a band that could not only write good songs but could rock hard in a live setting as well largely owning to the glorious psychedelic playing of original guitarist Eric Bell.\n\nThin Lizzy in ’71 where the classic rock three-piece template; Phil Lynott on bass, the criminally underrated Brian Downey on drums and the aforementioned Belfast native Eric Bell. A brief flirtation with a keyboard player called Eric Wrixton was eschewed because of financial constraints (although keys would feature heavily in later albums) and the young band from Ireland were determined to make a name for themselves, no matter the cost. Lizzy were already earning something of a reputation in Ireland for their barnstorming live sets and were easily packing out venues across the country as Bell states; “our ambition at the time was to get a reputation as a really good musical band. It was basically a little band and that was it. Suddenly we got rated as one of the brightest hopes everywhere…it was around then we started to realize that something was happening”. All the band needed was a record deal, but there was none forthcoming until a curious turn of events involving Lizzy’s manager at the time. Brian Tuite who had recently taken over management of the band had heard that a representative from Decca Records was travelling to Dublin to check out a singer by the brilliant name of Ditch Cassidy for a possible record deal and knowing that there was a slight problem (Ditch didn’t have a backing band) politely suggested Lizzy to provide the backing music. So transfixed was the rep by the band fronted by a “black Irishman” that the man from Decca ended up signing Lizzy instead. The rest is history.\n\nFrantically recorded between 4th and 9th of January 1971 at Decca Studios in West Hampstead and ‘produced’ by Scott English; “We were totally bombed for the duration of that record” recalls Bell “…English turned up with this enormous bag of grass. We ended up on the moon”, Thin Lizzy kicks thing off with the intriguingly titled “The Friendly Ranger At Clontarf Castle” beginning with a bongo like tom pattern from Downey accompanied by a monologue of sorts from Lynott with suitably trippy guitar swathes from Bell; for the causal fan, this is quite a different sound to anything off of Jailbreak and it is this otherworldly fantastical soundscape that would come to define the Bell era Lizzy. The track kicks of proper with a grooving bass riff with syncopated drums and washed out guitar with sincere autobiographical lyrics from Lynott before and entirely unsure rest in the track leading into an extended outro jam. The song is a charming, memorable, fascinating glimpse into the songwriting of the band at the time, especially Lynott’s and while it is far from the best track Lizzy ever wrote, all the essential ingredients are there.\n\nNext up is “Honesty Is No Excuse” a line Metallica would modify for their track “Damage INC” to “honesty is my only excuse” on their 1986 record Master of Puppets. This track, however, is markedly more mellow, beginning with pensive strummed guitar from Bell and Lynott showcasing his impressive vocal range with a kind of Van Morrison hero-worship throughout. Essentially a track rooted in the Morrison blues school of rock, the song is a pleasant enough ballad esque affair and a recurring theme for all Lizzy records from here on out. “Diddy Levine” follows with more wistful guitar and percussion from Downey with Lynott in full on story mode extolling the variables of young love and lost opportunities. The track however really takes off after the songs bridge section with an excellent extended solo from Bell with a riff that will get stuck in your head before a maudlin ending with Lynott finishing up his tale of the sad and lonely Diddy Levine. Next up is “Ray Gun” and it is something of an Eric Bell showpiece beginning with a Hendrix infused guitar riff with suitably spacey lyrics from Lynott and a high-pitched yelp in the chorus sections. The track groove along like it’s nobodies business and doesn’t outstay its welcome. “Look What The Wind Blew In” follows and it is one of the strongest tunes on Thin Lizzy beginning with a jaunty bluesy riff and syncopated drums with Lynott in fine form vocally (It is interesting to note his vocal progression throughout the course of the record as he becomes more comfortable) before leading into a catchy chorus section. The track is a fun bouncy tune and although it is only a fraction as innovative as future compositions, it is clear to the listener that the band has already honed their songwriting craft, which would only get better in time.\n\nAlways a man proud of his roots “Eire” is Lynott’s love letter to his native country; a theme which would re occur on at least several occasions throughout the band’s career. Beginning with a Celtic infused riff Lynott solemnly gives the listener a brief history lesson in ancient Irish history and a brief lesson it is; “Eire” is just a mere 2′ 08′ long. Next up is “Return Of The Farmer’s Son” beginning with an excellent bluesy riff from Bell and heavy driving bass from Lynott which ever so slightly hints at the band more embryonic heavy side. The track is not a bad one per se, but feels more like a collection of good ideas bolted together rather than a fully cohesive track; it is certainly the most experimental song on Thin Lizzy but lacks a certain direction. “Clifton Grange Hotel” serves as an ode to Lynott’s mothers hotel in Manchester England. Thin Lizzy is a deeply personal record and this track is no different. Lynott as a child (he was raised by his grandparents in Dublin) and later in life would often visit his mother Philomena in Manchester and this track recollects his memories of a rather bonhomie establishment which catered for those in the entertainment business with lyrics such as “Pack up your bags, leave family society, oh come with me where they treat you well…at the top you’ll find another brother , go ask my Mother she knows them all very well hotel”. The track is another brief exposition and is musically fine if nothing more than an extended jam. Next up is “Saga Of The Ageing Orphan” a suitably maudlin sounding track with spare guitar and stripped back percussion held together by Lynott’s pensive bass. Lyrically it’s more of the same, figures from Lynott’s formative years re imaged into abstract characters. The track is a charming one and reveals a softer side to Lynott’s writing which would remain a feature throughout his career. Thin Lizzy ends with “Remembering” (I am reviewing the release as it original appeared in 1971 and not the expanded later editions) another wholly pensive introspective track. It is interesting to not that this record is split evenly into two distinct parts. The original A side, as it were, the more ferocious and driven whilst side B more introspective and brooding. Beginning with a drum roll from Downey and jangly guitar with Lynott recalling times past with old friends and acquaintances before a more driven memorable chorus section before one last flamboyant solo from Bell before the track turns on a dime and becomes one last frantic extended jam. The track is a fine way to finish what has been a mostly excellent debut record.\n\nThin Lizzy is a fascinating glimpse into the formative years of what would become one of the greatest rock bands of the 70’s and 80’s and an inspiration to countless more down through the decades. It is a shame that this record, rough around the edges as it may be, does not get more recognition from fans which is understandable enough given the band has such a vast back catalog ranging from good to excellent. I feel it is something of a ‘lost’ record and a perceived poor relation to the Robertson/Gorham era records. Nonetheless, you can’t argue with the level of musicianship and songwriting even if by times it is somewhat primal and the record as a whole rocks and soothes in equal measure. If you missed this record back in the day when you first got into Lizzy or just haven’t heard it a while do return to it again; there’s a lot to love here and it is the musical birth of a true icon.\n\nWorks Cited: Putterford, Mark., Phil Lynott: The Rocker, Omnibus Press, London, 2002.\n\nNirvana – “Bleach”\n\n1989\n\nSub Pop\n\nOn June 15th 1989, Nirvana released their debut album titled “Bleach” to favorable reviews from critics. Despite the record not charting at all after its initial release, after the runaway success of Nevermind Geffen would re- release the record in 1992 which did chart quite well, but back in 1989 nobody knew, or indeed very much cared, about the band from Aberdeen Washington with the lanky bassist, tiny drummer and the awkwardly compelling guitarist/front-man. Many artists’ first record more or less comes and goes under the radar and “Bleach” is no exception; in fact in the short discography of the band “Bleach” is often unfairly overlooked even today. Many things have been written about Nirvana and the music that they recorded over the ensuing decades but I have always felt that “Bleach” often gets little to no credit or recognition. If you listen very careful and deconstruct the music contained within, as we will shortly do, you can hear the beginning of a cultural centerpiece the likes of which, quite frankly, we are unlikely to see ever again. To think that all of it started with a little record recorded for a mere $606 (courtesy of sometime Soundgarden bassist Jason Everman and very briefly of Nirvana after the record’s release) is equal parts remarkable and unfathomable. It was also, perhaps more importantly, an early primitive showcase for the obvious tortured genius of a certain Mr. Cobain.\n\n“Bleach” was recorded in Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle between December 1988 and January of 1989 by Sub Pop producer Jack Endino. Initially there wasn’t going to be a record at all; the cash strapped Sub Pop had only sanctioned an EP initially and even that was later shelved for the release of the “Love Buzz” single, not even an original Nirvana composition much to the chagrin of Cobain. However “Love Buzz” did well enough within Sub Pop’s Singles club that the label decide to sanction a full length LP, there was one problem though; the band would have to pay for the recording upfront themselves. Sessions began sometime after Christmas 1988 and continued off an on until January with the band well rehearsed and familiar with the material so that recording could be completed as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Preliminary demos had been recorded before this with Dale Crover of the Melvins on drums for that particular session and indeed some of his performances were carried over for the “Bleach” sessions; namely “Paper Cuts”, “Floyd The Barber” and “Downer”.\n\n“Bleach” kicks things off with “Blew” beginning with a growling bass before being joined by original drummer Chad Channing’s drums and a heavy fuzzy guitar riff from Cobain changing to an angular metal sounding riff in the chorus sections with a rare traditional sounding extended guitar solo. “Blew” is the first introduction of the verse/chorus dynamic from Nirvana which would change-up and swap sides according to the composition at hand to often great effect. Next up is the heavy, moody “Floyd The Barber”. In a 2009 interview with Seattle Weekly bassist Krist Novoselic described the records sound as “Doom Pop” and he’s not too far wrong. The track evokes Sabbath at their heaviest but with a total pop sensibility which is infectious as it is curious sounding beginning with a glimmer of feedback a straight up metal riff with accompanying syncopated pounding floors toms and distorted bass leading into a high register guitar solo which lefts the track momentarily out of the heavy dirge before ending in a chaotic manner with the pop of bass ending the track.\n\n“About A Girl” follows, probably the most recognizable song to longtime and causal fans alike so far with a clear Beatles influence throughout. The track begins with a an instantly memorable guitar riff which anchors the song throughout with grooving bass and serviceable drums. This track showcases Cobain’s incredible knack for writing, well, pop tunes with an interesting middle section featuring new wave style drumming and an extended guitar riff, which this reviewer had genuinely forgotten about and a section of music which sounds incredible even after all these years. Interestingly it was Channing who suggested the song’s title, in the same interview for Seattle Weekly Channing states; “Working on About A Girl”, the song didn’t have a title by that time, so I asked Kurt “What is that song about?” He said “About a girl”. I said “Why don’t you just call it that?” So he made this quirky smile and said “OK!”.\n\n“School” follows, beginning with a distorted snakey guitar riff before been joined by drums and bass with a jangley riff in the tried and true loud chorus to the soft verse leading to another extended frantic solo before Kurt’s agonized cries of “You’re in high school again!”. The track is a memorable one and much like the preceding couple of tracks evokes yet more personal storytelling from Cobain. Next up is “Love Buzz” Nirvana’s very first single and included here in the 1992 re- release of the record which is of course a cover of Shocking Blue’s rather tepid spacey original composition. Nirvana’s version is anything but; featuring vibrant bass tones that will get stuck in your head and raging guitar, with an excellent drum bass motif in the verse sections before the heavy chorus sections (already the band has perfected the dynamic) before ending out in chaotic fashion. The track is an improvement on the original, mostly essential if a cover version is to succeed and is a worthy addition to the record.\n\n“Paper Cuts” follows and it’s probably the weakest track on the record. Beginning with heavy distorted riffs and thundering drums, the track features an odd vocal performance from Cobain which is equal parts disconcerting and disjointed with an almost Alice in Chains esque chorus. “Paper Cuts” is easily the most ambitious track on “Bleach” and that is part of its downfall; Nirvana where always at their best when the music was primal, bouncy, brief and fun and while the track is not a bad song per se, it has a dirgey feel to it which soon gets repetitive after repeated listens. “Negative Creep” is next up beginning with a twisty schizophrenic riff and the track is perhaps, along with “About A Girl”, the most recognizable tune off of “Bleach” with Cobain”s memorable demented refrain of “Daddy’s little girl ain’t a girl no more” anchoring the song throughout and the track is a definite standout as a result. “Scoff” follows, beginning with a snappy drum pattern replicated on guitar and is a frantic rocker with metal undertones. Most interesting is Chad Channing’s use of double kick after the impossibly catchy chorus sections which is quite an anomaly for Nirvana’s music but as Novoselic himself said of the influences of the band around this time, in a 2002 interview with Rolling Stone; “We had one tape in the van, this was before we recorded “Bleach” and on one side was The Smithreens and on the other was a heavy metal band called Celtic Frost. That tape was always getting played, turned over and over again. I think back now and go “Yeah, maybe that was an influence”.\n\n“Swap Meet” is next up beginning with another moody angular riff accompanied during the chorus sections by a marching snare type pattern from Channing before transitioning into a brief idiosyncratic solo complete with Cobain’s equally idiosyncratic lyrics “they make their living off of arts and crafts, the kind with seashells, driftwood and burlap, they make a deal when they come to town, the Sunday swap meet is a battle ground”. The track is charming, almost like a raging nursery rhyme, and doesn’t outstay its welcome. “Mr. Moustache” follows with a rapid snare from Channing before a gloriously paranoid riff kicks in with a stop/ start chorus. The track is the typical bouncy Nirvana song (with a very knowing ending) that would come to be perfected on Nevermind; short, snappy and a lot of fun. “Sifting” begins with a staggered drum pattern and a clunky metal riff with a tonal shift from the previous few tracks. The song feels more like a collection of good ideas tacked together and the results are fairly average; much like “Paper Cuts” the track is a tad over ambitious in its composition and doesn’t quite warrant many repeated listens. The opposite can be said for “Big Cheese” originally the B-side to the “Love Buzz” single (I am reviewing the 1992 reissue that most fans are familiar with and has become the industry standard) as a result the track feels slightly unfinished and more like a demo; anybody that owns the With The Lights Out box-set will be familiar with the stomping live version of the song. On “Bleach” the song still retains that bouncy fun factor (lyrically something of a dig at Sub Pop) and is a track that was written for the live setting in mind. “Bleach” ends with the short but sweet punk infused “Downer” beginning with rumbling bass, off kilter drums and a frenetic riff from Cobain. The track is the ideal schizophrenic closer to what was then a most unique debut record from a band in a long long time.\n\n“Bleach” is not without its faults; the production is rough, some of the material falls a bit flat when it enters a slightly more ambitious arena and the playing is sometimes lacking but in some ways that’s entirely the point. The record still to this day is a fascinating snapshot in time of a band learning its trade before global and cultural domination. It’s not Nirvana’s best record, but it does contains some of the bands most memorable material and at least one stone cold classic. More pertinently, Cobain sounds like he’s having fun on this album, something which was essentially gone by the time In Utero came to be released. It’s the sound of three young guys jamming tunes and having a good time and in 1989 that’s really all that mattered then and everything else after a bonus – many musicians can relate to that. If you haven’t, like me, listened to this album for a while give it a spin, I was pleasantly surprised to find that much of the material still holds up and sounds vibrant in 2019. I guess that’s the biggest complement one can give any piece of work and genius.\n\nStill have no real clue what Kurt is singing about half the time though.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nFricke, David.,(Sep 2001) Q&A: Krist Novoselic Looks Back On Nirvana’s ‘Nevermind’, Rolling Stone.\n\nNovoselic, Krist.,(Oct 2009) Bleach: Krist Novoselic Interviews Chad Channing, Seattle Weekly.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age – Lullabies to Paralyze\n\nInterscope\n\n2005\n\nOn March 21st 2005, Queens of the Stone age released their forth studio album to mostly favorable reviews. After the runaway commercial success of 2002’s Songs for the Deaf and extensive touring in support of that record, and following the departure of Bassist Nick Oliveri in 2004 whilst on tour in Australia and with on/off band member Mark Lanagan seemingly concentrating on his own solo career it can be said that QotSA were in something of a state of flux. Nevertheless, front-man Josh Homme had plenty of material written ready to be hammered out and swiftly recruited present guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen and drummer Joey Castillo to round out the band with contributions, from among others, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Shirley Manson of Garbage, Brody Dale, Josh Freese and Hollywood Jack himself, Mr. Jack Black. Recording took place throughout much of the summer of 2004 at Sound City studios in Van Nuys California with the record produced by Joe Barresi of Weezer fame and co produced by Homme himself. Said Homme at the time of the records release and addressing the relative upheaval in the band in a 2005 interview with Rolling Stone magazine; “[I feel] like an underdog again… Every time you make a record, you’re trying to prove something a little. You can always put it out but you can never take it back. I’d hate to suck”.\n\nLullabies to Paralyze kicks things off with “This Lullaby” beginning with pensive guitar and the trademark baritone vocals of Mark Lanegan; a pretty brief introduction into the new record which really kicks off proper with the schizophrenic “Medication” beginning with fuzzy guitars and driving drums and essentially picking up musically were Songs for the Deaf left off. Next up is ” Everybody Knows That You Are Insane” beginning with agonized guitar and suitably eerie atmospherics leading into a driving chorus section which transitions into an idiosyncratic verse section. The track was written to be played live and it is a satisfying stomper of a tune. “Tangled Up In Plaid” follows beginning with ominous keys and spare snare drum before transitioning into jaunty guitar and swelling bass throughout. The track is fairly different brooding track for Queens (a theme that runs throughout this record) and it is an interesting sounding song that doesn’t outstay its welcome.\n\n“Burn the Witch” is next up beginning with a dark incantation before a transition into a down and dirty rockabilly guitar riff courtesy of the great Billy Gibbons who also shares vocals with Homme, with the track’s bridge suitably spacey. “Burn the Witch” is a fun track if not entirely essential listening and interestingly was the albums third and final single, nearly a year after the records release. “In My Head”, the records second single ( interestingly co written by Josh Freese) and arguably the most commercial sounding single from the band follows. The track had a past life; a version of the song appears on a record called Volume Ten: I Heart Disco from a musician collective of sorts that Homme contributed to called the Desert Sessions in 2003, however most hardcore and causal fans are most likely to remember this track from the game Need For Speed Underground 2. Petrol head or no, the track proved to be immensely popular and even was accompanied by a pretty dire music video. The track begins with a repeating riff before transitioning into a beautifully paranoid main riff with a strong catchy memorable chorus complete with suitably maudlin lyrics; ” I keep on playing our favorite song, turn it up when your gone”.\n\nThe charming “Little Sister” follows, the lead single from the album released a full four months before the record dropped. Beginning with a clarion call of jam-block (not cowbell folks) and an angular guitar riff, “Little Sister” is a damn catchy tune, even today with a strong chorus and tight turn on a dime verse sections showcasing the chops of the excellent Joey Castillo. The track is a firm fans favorite and is still played live today. Next we have “I Never Came” beginning with rim shots and a double tom pattern accompanying a ripply guitar riff with excellent mournful vocals from Homme before leading into a maudlin chorus section with great guitar work from Van Leeuwen with a devastating bridge section which sees out the tracks soaring wistful conclusion. “I Never Came” is the records best track in this reviewers eyes and a criminally underrated tune.\n\n“Someones In The Wolf” is next beginning with disjointed guitars and drums leading into Homme’s banshee like wailing vocals throughout before at the 5′ mark the track slows into an eerie sounding desolate dirge with a demented ending section. The track feels more like an extended jam rather than a wholly cohesive track but perhaps that was the whole point and it the weakest track on Lullabies To Paralyze so far. “The Blood Is Love” is next and initially continues the vibe of its predecessor before turning on a time with a grungy sounding riff and wailing guitars. The track is a fairly straight ahead rock tune, neither bad nor particularly remarkable and ticks along nicely if so what inoffensively. Next up is “Skin On Skin” beginning with a droney guitar riff which pulsates along to great effect, but the track is utterly redundant and doesn’t really offer the listener anything particularly new to what has come before; at this point in the record things are starting to sound a bit samey.\n\nThankfully “Broken Box” is more sonically interesting and a tried and true Queens track which brings back a bit of the fun factor again with sinewy bass, driving percussion and demented keys and hey, it’s got Jack Black clapping hands on it too. “You’ve Got A Killer Scene There Man” is next up with wistful mournful guitars and the backing vocals of Mark Lanegan once again along with help from Misses Dale and Manson. The track plays out as a kind of washed out semi blues tune and is all the better for it all cigarettes and whisky glasses. Lullabies To Paralyze ends with “Long Slow Goodbye” beginning with a strummed country esque riff before leading into a jaunty verse section with crying guitars and lamentable vocals from Homme and features a hidden outro section courtesy of The Main Street Horns. The track is a decent way to end an album which has had a certain commercial vibe to it yet surprisingly experimental in parts too.\n\nIn a lot of ways, Lullabies To Paralyze had an impossible task to follow-up a cult fan favorite like Songs For The Deaf which happens for so many artists and in all truth it mostly fails to live up to that standard. However, the record has a certain charm which is hard to ignore and features some of the best songs the band has written in their career. It is obvious that the band upheavals had some effect on some of the material to a greater or lesser degree and the second half of the record is pretty weak compared to the first half as a result; not that the buying public seemed to mind too much as the record still charted well and went gold in Australia, Canada and the UK. If you somehow missed out on Lullabies To Paralyze back in the day, are a new fan, or you just haven’t given this record a spin in a while do check it out; the album has dated very well and most of the material still sounds fresh today. It’s not Queens best work but it is still an interesting record to listen and jam to. Now where’s my Jamblock…\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nAppleford, Steve., (Jan 2005) QOTSA Sing Lullabies – Josh Homme Puts Finishing Torches On New Record, Rolling Stone.\n\nGojira – The Way of All Flesh\n\nListenable\n\n2008\n\nOn 13th October, 2008, French metallers Gojira released their fourth studio album titled The Way of All Flesh to mostly favorable reviews. Anticipation among fans was high after the break out success of the band’s 2005 effort, the stunning From Mars… to Sirius and by the time of this record’s release, Gojira were critical darlings among established members of the metal community and rightly so; From Mars had been something of a sleeper hit for the band(everyone remembers the first time they heard “Heaviest Matter of the Universe”, my neck has never been quite the same since) with more and more people gradually becoming aware of their unique brand of Gallic progressive death infused metal. As such the band had something to prove with The Way of All Flesh and as we shall see later they mostly delivered whilst continuing to become a force in the mainstream metal world.\n\nThe album was recorded at the bands home studio in Bayonne, France and was produced, interestingly, by frontman Joe Duplantier, something that Duplantier himself sees as being almost crucial for the band when speaking to Metal Sucks in a 2008 interview; “For me, for my part, I consider myself more of a producer than a singer or a guitar player or composer. Producing is really what we do with Gojira even when we compose a song… we are producing ourselves with the artwork, the shows, the light shows, the videos, everything. We are the producers”. The drums however were recorded in L.A and engineered by none other than sometime Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader (a sign of the bands growing recognition in mainstream metal) who also mixed and mastered the record.\n\nProduction for the new record was surprisingly short with the album written and recorded in just six months with drummer Mario Duplantier attributing the relatively short timescale from previous records as a result of ongoing touring commitments (thanks u/vegmeister for the additional info!). As of the records themes, Duplantier described the album as addressing the death of the planet; I feel concerned about what is happening to the planet Earth, human beings, animals, plants, mountains and water. I feel truly and deeply concerned”. Over a decade later these concerns are sadly more real than ever.\n\nThe Way of All Flesh kicks things off with “Oroborus” a track that immediately announces all the characteristics of the band’s work so far with elongated proggy guitar work and off kilter drumming from the excellent Mario Duplantier before transitioning into a heavy guitar riff and growled behind clenched teeth vocal style of Joe Duplantier before transitioning into an interesting proggy middle section with a pensive outro section. The song is a decent introduction into a record that would attempt to mesh the traditional Gojira sound into a slightly more accessible commercial sound and “Oroborus is fairly representative of that. The excellent intriguingly titled “Toxic Garbage Island” is next beginning with heavy, demented, syncopated guitars and drums leading a glorious head banging main riff with blistering kick drums which then slows to an almost mid tempo, pre bridge section with Duplanier’s agonized screams of “pain is killing me” leading to an extended kick drum workout from brother Mario and ending in a chaotic refrain of “Plastic bag in the sea!” which admitably back in 2008 was somewhat humorous on first listen, but now a message which has never resonated as much as it does today with a serious plastic problem in the world’s oceans gaining mainstream media attention in recent times.\n\n“A Sight to Behold” follows, an odd sounding tune, beginning with dissonant synthesizer esque sounds and talk box complete with a mid tempo verse section and Joe Duplantier lamenting the current state of the planet before the song turns on a dime with a snaky descending riff leading into a raging heavy middle section which is more reminiscent of traditional Gojira closing out the track. “A Sight to Behold” is an excellent track, utterly Gojira, yet something more sonically different and dare say, more accessible to the casual listener. “Yama’s Messengers” is next up beginning with the atypical Gojira crunch riff (which is almost a calling card of the band) before leading into a blistering verse section replete with blasting from Mario Duplantier. The track is certainly ferocious if a little disjointed; the song feels more like a collection of very good ideas rather than a coherent track but it is still a brutal enjoyable listen which doesn’t outstay its welcome. The quite, pensive sounding “The Silver Cord” follows, an instrumental which serves as a kind of intermission for the record, beautifully executed and evocative in its feel, when certain people who dismiss metal as being, well, shit and essentially music for the lowest common denominator in society, they should be made to listen to this record and this track. Preferably extremely loud.\n\n“All The Tears” follows with the track beginning with a sound similar to From Mars with frenzied idiosyncratic guitars leading to more insane blasting from Mario Duplantier (his performance on this record is excellent throughout and a career high) however the track suffers from much the same issue as “Yama’s Messengers”; a collection of good ideas better than the sum of the track itself. and at this point the record is beginning to sound slightly samey. “Adoration for None” follows and it’s a track ruined by guest vocalist and Lamb of God’s irritant front man Randy Blythe, more or less straight away. It’s the musical equivalent of pairing David Bowie with Nicki Minaj. Nothing against Lamb of God in particular; although I’m not a fan, the track simply doesn’t mesh well with Blythe’s vocals and it feels as though the song was written just for him and is yet another indicator of Gojira’s ascension into the mainstream metal world and in all honesty the song suffers all the more for that here.\n\nThankfully the next track “The Art of Dying” is excellent beginning with an atmospheric tribal percussion and drone like incantation, the track explodes into a demented riff and off beat drums with Duplantier extolling the virtue of dying; “I haven’t closed my eyes in a long time”. The track does a good job of creating a certain tension throughout before the esoteric middle section kicks in with the track ending out in a vast sounding outro which in turn becomes the intro to the excellent “Esoteric Surgery” beginning with a driving guitar riff and drums leading into an impossibly heavy verse riff with a semi catchy chorus section; this track always makes me want to get up and do something. The tracks middle section is a clash of riffage and blistering drum leading into a chaotic outro section which will induce severe whiplash if the listener is not careful.\n\n“Vacuity” follows and it is a sinewy, pulsating track which is quite different to what Gojira has written before. An attempt, perhaps, at a more accessible sound, the track was the lead song from the album and had a suitably trippy music video to boot. The track is almost entirely mid tempo and more focused than the typical proggy Gojira tune and the chorus is memorable with a satisfying heavy middle section complete with yet more blasting from Mario Duplantier. “Vacuity” is a fairly inoffensive track which doesn’t outstay its welcome. “Wolf Down the Earth” is next beginning with that tried and true Gojira crunch riff leading into an off kilter feeling verse section before the track turns on a dime in an almost slow break down feel. “Wolf Down the Earth is probably the weakest track on The Way of All Flesh in that is doesn’t really offer anything new to what has already come before on the record. The Way of All Flesh ends with its title track; a massive bludgeoning slab of metal with demented syncopated guitars courtesy of Duplantier and lead guitarist Christian Andreu and driving drums with a chorus like a drill to the head. The tracks plays as a kind of death rattle for the record, the last the band would write for Listenable Records with the hidden ambient instrumental track acting as a coda to what has been a dense, mostly enjoyable listen.\n\nThe Way of All Flesh is a fine metal record worthy to the Gojira discography. It is not the bands best work; most fans will cite From Mars… To Sirius as the bands magnum opus, however this reviewer personally feels the stunning Terra Incognita best placed for that claim. Some of the material here doesn’t quite match up to the bands first three records, however, as we have seen, there is still a lot to apprentice about The Way of All Flesh. It was never going to be an easy task for the band to top From Mars… as we have seen of many artists down through the years, it can be a difficult job to surpass a seminal album. That being said, this record would be considered most metal bands best and I think that says a lot of the sheer talent of Gojira; granted some of the musical structures can be repetitive, but the band is so brave in their writing that really anything in their unique soundscapes is to be expected and the music has its own cultural unique flavor. If you missed out on this record when it came out, do give it another go, it’s a solid, sometimes breathtaking Gojira record that will leave you wanting more and get you very cross at all the plastic in the sea.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nVN&AR.,(Jan 2009) Gojira’s Joe Duplantier: The official Metal Sucks Interview, Metal Sucks.\n\nInterview Gojira Metalship: https://youtu.be/jSd2djuIAPU"
