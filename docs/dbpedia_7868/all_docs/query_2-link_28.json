        "text": "Man's Ruin\n\nGlasgow\n\nManâs Ruin comprise five of Scotlandâs leading exponents of experimental folk music. These cross-genre folk rebels have earned international recognition for their soul-twisting interpretations of modern folk and roots music on the contemporary stage. Whether it be folk, funk, country, rock or electronica they seamlessly blend styles through careful and considered musical craft work. The resulting effect is a semi-acoustic fireball of funk-flavoured folk.\n\nMan's Ruin Musicâs tracks\n\nSanjay by Man's Ruin Music\n\npublished on 2013-05-23T09:02:17Z\n\nWorking For The Man by Man's Ruin Music\n\npublished on 2013-05-23T09:02:17Z\n\nDays of the weak by Man's Ruin Music\n\npublished on 2013-03-29T09:11:35Z\n\nFrantic Funk by Man's Ruin Music\n\npublished on 2013-03-29T09:11:35Z\n\nWash that World Away by Man's Ruin Music\n\npublished on 2013-03-29T09:09:01Z\n\nBreak Out by Man's Ruin Music\n\npublished on 2013-03-29T08:58:12Z"
