        "text": "Following the release of the Foo Fighters frontman’s rockumentary Sound City: Reel To Real and its associated soundtrack, a newly recorded tracc has surfaced as a result of the jam session including Josh Homme, Dave Grohl, and Trent Reznor, in an all-star track that rivals last year’s Paul McCartney-fronted Nirvana reunion on the ‘sheer awesome’ scale.\n\nThe track, christened ‘Mantra’ is an epic eight-minute long jam, and as Rolling Stone reports, the long awaited musical collaboration between the three rock legends features as the closing track for the Sound City soundtrack, featuring vocal performances from all three with Grohl on drums, Homme on guitar, and Reznor on keys.\n\nVideo filmed at the recording of the track, featured in the documentary (and can be viewed in the banner), shows the Queens of the Stone Age frontman, the Foo Fighter and the Nine Inch Nails/How To Destroy Angels main man laying down the initial instrumentation for ‘Mantra’ and is an intruiging insight how the three work together in the studio.\n\nThis comes after the release of the documentary, that provides insight into the human element of music, the lost art of analogue recording, and the history of America’s greatest unsung recording studio, Sound City.\n\nThe soundtrack is also one of the most impressive film sondtracks of all time featuring Paul McCartney, Stevie Nicks (Fleetwood Mack), John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival), Rick ‘Jessie’s Girl’ Springfield, Rick Nielsen (Cheap Trick), Brad Wilk (Rage Against The Machine), Alain Johannes (Queens of the Stone Age), Chris Goss (producer), Lee Ving (Fear), Jessy Greene (Geraldine Fibbers), and the Wallflowers’ Rami Jafee – just to name a few.The track, christened ‘Mantra’ is an epic eight-minute long jam… [featuring]Grohl on drums, Homme on guitar, and Reznor on keys.\n\nOn top of that, many of those iconic musicians feature in the ranks of Sound City Players an all-star supergroup headed by Grohl that debuted at the Sundance Film Festival‘s Park City Live gig, taking their marathon two-hour live show of covers and originals around the world, and will be making the trip down under to perform a one off show in Sydney as a part of the Sound City World Tour.\n\nTo add to his already busy schedule, Grohl will also be appearing at this year’s SXSW festival, taking place in Austin this March, appearing as a keynote speaker on Thursday, March 14, 2013 at the Austin Convention Center.\n\nThe recent reassociation of Grohl, Reznor, and Homme also comes after the announcement of an extended hiatus from the Foo Fighters that was only recently renegged by a Reddit Q&A session with Grohl. It was revealed that the Foo Fighters were in fact not on extended hiatus and beginning work on the new Foo Fighters album; with Grohl stating that “like Pat Smear says… we’re not on hiatus… we’re on “i hate us” and yes, we are already writing the new record.”\n\nOn the Reznor front, the Nine Inch Nails frontman has slammed fans on a Reddit Q&A whilst promoting the new How To Destroy Angels LP, giving a withering response to a fan for questioning his motives for returning to a major label for the debut release of his latest musical project with his wife Mariqueen Maandig and longtime collaborators Rob Sheridan and Atticus Ross.\n\nLet’s just say Reznor was anything but pleasant in responding to the troll, in one of the best replies of all time:\n\nQ: “As millionaires, why did you sign up with a record label to promote your new album?”\n\nA: [Reznor] “Sorry, the wifi on our yacht is having issues, we can’t get your full question to load. Try sending me an email at [email protected]”\n\nIn tandem with the Columbia Records release of the How To Destroy Angels debut, Welcome Oblivion, was the announcement of the return Nine Inch Nails in an upcoming “full-on arena tour” of the US this year, as well as “lots of other dates worldwide to follow through 2014.” Including an appearance at Japan’s 2013 Fuji Rock Festival. This promptly led to speculation stirring around the possibility of a Nine Inch Nails appearance at this year’s Splendour In The Grass.\n\nAll this also comes with the revelation that the new Queens of The Stone Ages record, due for release this year, will feature Reznor, along with Dave Grohl, Josh Homme and the rest of the QOTSA lineup.\n\nThe group’s first album since 2007s Era Vulgaris is set to feature a lineup consisting of the three aformentioned rock superstars as well contributions from none other than Elton John and Scissor Sisters’ Jake Shears.\n\nThe album, already one of the year’s most anticipated, will also feature Homme’s estranged bassist Nick Oliveri and legendary Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan – making the sixth QOTSA studio album a virtual reunion and spiritual successor to landmark 2002 album, Songs For The Deaf.\n\nIt’s safe to say that Grohl, Reznor, and Homme have a lot on their plate at the moment… and you were complaining that your weekly schedule was becoming too clutered."
