UK Shipping :-

3.30 GBP

These shipping costs are adjusted to reflect a small increase in UK Royal Mail prices from April 30 2012 - However, there is some good news as well !!

Due to changes in the Royal Mail domestic weight bandings which come in to force at the same time, it now costs the same to ship two LP/12" records as it does for one, so the "additional item" rates are as follows :-

Additional LP/12" in the same package :-

**** 2nd LP/12" in the same package = FREE ****

(Total of) 3 x LP/12" = 4.50

(Total of) 4 to 7 LP/12" = 6.40

(Total of) 8 to 15 LP/12" = 9.90

(Note - Double LP's (and items with unusually heavy packaging!) count as two additional - Triples as three additional, and so on). Royal Mail "Second Class Standard" service is used. If you require a different service, please request it before paying for your item(s), so the cost can be adjusted accordingly.

Where the total value of your shipment is 45 GBP or more, Recorded Delivery must be used (additional 95p flat rate per package).

Please wait for your payment total to be adjusted if the total value of your item(s) is 45 GBP or more.

Non-UK Shipping :-

These shipping costs are adjusted to reflect a substantial increase in UK Royal Mail international shipping prices from April 30 2012.

Europe = 5.30 GBP

USA/Canada = 7.75 GBP

Asia (incl. Japan) = 7.75 GBP

Australia/NZ = 8.00 GBP

Extra LP's/12-inch at the following rates :-

Europe = 1.25 GBP each

USA/Canada = 2.50 GBP each

Asia (inc. Japan) = 2.50 GBP each

Australia/NZ = 2.60 GBP each.

(Note - Double LP's (and items with unusually heavy packaging!) count as two additional - Triples as three additional, and so on).

Where the total value of your shipment is 45 GBP or more, Signed-For/Confirmed/Recorded Delivery must be used (additional 5.60 GBP).

Please wait for your payment amount to be adjusted if the total value of your item(s) is 45 GBP or more.

Where the total weight of your shipment is 2 KG or more, (normally the max. for this weight is 6 or 7 LP/12-inch)

- it will need to be split into 2 separate shipments - or shipped via courier - as the UK Royal Mail does not currently offer a reasonably-priced Shipping Service for such parcels. These shipments will be charged/quoted "at cost" when required.

Buyers From OUTSIDE The European Union (EU) â€“ Please Note:

- Any Import Duties, Taxes and associated Charges levied by your country are not included in the item price or P&P charges. These charges are the buyer's responsibility.

- Please check with your country's customs authorities to determine whether these charges may apply (and what they will be) prior to bidding/buying.

- These charges are normally collected by the courier company (or when you pick the package up). Do not confuse them for additional P&P charges.

Despatch and Packing :-

All items are normally posted within 48 hours of receiving payment.

Where payment is by Cheque (or Paypal's eCheque), items will not be despatched until the cheque has cleared.

Purpose-designed mailing/packaging materials will be used.

Your record(s) will be well protected against the rigours of normal handling/shipping, including getting wet in the rain!

All records are packed outside of their main packaging (in a new plain inner where necessary), to avoid sleeve splits in transit.

Gradings :-

I use the UK "Record Collector Magazine" grading system for vinyl.

For those not familiar with this standard, it's reproduced here on eBay :-

Vinyl Gradings are visual unless otherwise stated.

Items are graded honestly and conservatively - I know how it feels to get overgraded stuff through the mail !

Bid with confidence.
