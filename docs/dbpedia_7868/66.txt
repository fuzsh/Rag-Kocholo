In the midst of touring with Them Crooked Vultures and writing new material for Queens of the Stone Age, among other projects, Josh Homme has decided to revive his record label Rekords Rekords. He has already decided on a bunch of future releases as well it seems. A new Desert Sessions album, that will have a box set of all the recordings from the infamous recordings, will be released. Also, a solo album from QOTSA guitarist Alain Johannes is slated for arrival on shelves. Homme even has plans for DVDs and books as well. When speaking on the revival to Rolling Stone, he said, “I want to make Rekords Rekords like the Wolfman Jack of releasing stuff. You listened to him for his taste. I want to build up a trust with the audience. Our slogan is ‘Where the “Shit” Hits the Fan’ — with the ’shit’ in quotes.” His label, which has been around in several forms since 1997, has recently joined forces with Los Angeles-based indie label Dangerbird for a series of releases, including Johannes’ solo outing. The labels will also put out the debut album from LA-based Mini Mansions, which features QOTSA bassist Mikey "Shoes" Shuman. When commenting on this partnership, Homme noted, “"The reason I went [to Dangerbird] in the first place was because they're about getting things done — 'nuff said. There's no reason to wait or belabor the point about releasing records. This is the time to focus on the consistency of your art.” For more information on future releases visit the label’s site at www.rekordsrekords.com. Recommended Listening:
