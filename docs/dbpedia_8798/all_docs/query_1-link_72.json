        "text": "Overflowing bins, long queues and, many disappointed consumers. The first few months of a new plastic bottle recycling system has become unpopular in Hungary.\n\nAbout 3.5 million bottles are thrown into the machines every day, which is far more than the designed capacity. For each empty drink container returned, consumers should be refunded 0.13 cents.\n\n\"Once we came with a lot of bags, but the machines didn't work. Then we went to another one, and that was bad too. Finally we took the rubbish home,\" Fruzsina, a Hungarian girl, said.\n\nOther problems include the machine not recognising bottles. The organising company, MOHU, is being blamed for the lack of recyling points in the country.\n\nHungary has one year left to reach the EU target of nearly 6.5 million recycled bottles per day."
