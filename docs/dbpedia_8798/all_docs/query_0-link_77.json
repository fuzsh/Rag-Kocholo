What reasons motivated the Poles to use sticks and hunting weapons to launch Russian cannons and rifles in line with the recommendations of Ludwik Mierosławski?\n\nMateusz Balcerkiewicz\n\n5.1K\n\nToday, 07:00\n\nYou can read this text in 5 minutes\n\nBranka of Poles to the Russian army (author: Aleksander Sochaczewski, public domain)Branka of Poles to the Russian army (author: Aleksander Sochaczewski, public domain) - Aleksander Sochaczewski / Historical portal Histmag.org\n\nThe Crimean War in 1853-1856 exposed the military weakness and imperfections of the army of the Russian Empire. The Russians lost not only because of inferior-quality weapons - the organization of the army also failed, and the situation was additionally worsened by widespread corruption and thefts in the administration. It even happened that the defending Russian troops suffered greater losses than the attacking side! This gave the Poles under Russian occupation hope that there was another chance to gain independence.\n\nBefore the January Uprising started, there were many more reasons for this. As a result of the Crimean War, not only Russia's military strength declined. In the West, Tsar Nicholas I was blamed for the outbreak of the bloody conflict, which claimed a total loss of half a million. In the west, Tsarist Russia appeared to be a barbaric power against which a victorious war had just been waged. Therefore, the nations oppressed by it (including Poles) and their independence aspirations were viewed favorably.\n\nSocial movements, initiated by the Spring of Nations, continued to gain momentum. The Italian il Risorgimento , lasting from 1859 , which two years later led to the final unification of the Apennine Peninsula, showed that such aspirations made sense and stimulated the imagination in the partitions.\n\nThe January Uprising - causes: conspiracies and demonstrations on the eve of the outbreak\n\nAs early as 1856, independence organizations began to form. The General was established at the university in Kiev, later transformed into the Trojny Union. The Circle of Polish Officers in St. Petersburg was established in the capital of the empire. In Warsaw, it was conspiratorial mainly in academic circles - secret circles were created, among others, at the Medical and Surgical Academy or the School of Fine Arts. Even in the Warsaw Main School, opened with the consent of the tsar in 1862, illegal organizations quickly arose. In May 1858, Narcis Jankowski came to Warsaw from Kiev, who was not only involved in organizing underground activities, but also in military training of students.\n\nThe plans for the outbreak of the uprising began in 1859. Two years later, the Polish Military School was established in Genoa. About 200 people attended it, who were to lead the fight in the future. Increasingly hotter social moods were expressed in a series of patriotic speeches. The most famous are: the convention on June 11, 1860 on the occasion of the funeral of the widow of General Józef Sowiński, the disruption of the convention of monarchs in Warsaw in October 1860, or the demonstration on November 29 this year, on the 30th anniversary of the November Uprising.\n\nDuring the latter event, the song of Jan Nepomucen, Piotr Kraszewski, known to us today with a changed text under the name \"God, Something Polskę\" was sung. The original text was the work of Alojzy Feliński, commissioned in honor of Tsar Alexander I by Prince Konstanty. The Poles removed the regalistic threads from the song, and the ending line \"Our King, save us, Lord\", changed to \"Our Lord, please come back to us free.\"\n\nThe wrath of the ruler of Russia\n\nThe growing independence sentiment could not remain unanswered by the tsar. And it was an extremely brutal response. The celebration of the aforementioned anniversary of the events of 1830 was interrupted by soldiers who dispersed the crowd demonstrating. Similarly, on February 25, 1861, participants of the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the battle for Olszynka Grochowska were driven away. Two days later, firearms were used against demonstrators in Krakowskie Przedmieście.\n\nAs a result, five participants were killed. The fallen - a tailor's apprentice, metal worker, high school student and two landowners - represented various social groups and environments. Their death became a symbol of Russian repression against the entire Polish society. The solemn funeral on March 2 turned into another demonstration, and the event was even loud in the provinces. There have been cases of officials being thrown out by angry landowners, which the Russian garrisons could not always react to, as most of the soldiers were deployed to protect the capital.\n\nIn April of the same year, demonstrators were shot again at Castle Square. This time there were many more victims - one hundred killed and a further several hundred wounded. The former governor of the Kingdom of Poland died in May, and Nikolai Suchozanet, who was taking his office, further aggravated the repressions. Prison was threatened for any manifestation of Polishness - even provocative clothes could lead to arrest. The enthusiasm of Poles, however, did not diminish, and therefore Tsar Alexander II decided to create a certain form of self-government at the level of cities and poviats. By orders of June 18, a new law was proclaimed and the repression eased somewhat by the end of the elections.\n\nThe stubbornness of Poles\n\nHowever, it did not have the intended effect. The demonstrations continued and only grew stronger. After the thousand-strong speech in Vilnius was suppressed, martial law was announced on August 22 in the Vilnius, Grodno and Kaunas governorates. On October 14, 1861, the new governor, General Count Charles Lambert, took the entire Kingdom under martial law. Nevertheless, a day later, a solemn celebration of the anniversary of Tadeusz Kościuszko's death was organized. The pacification of this event turned into a bloody slaughterhouse - soldiers were breaking into churches and kidnapping people there. As a sign of protest, the diocese of Warsaw decided to close all churches in the city. After a few days, Lambert bowed - he released most of those arrested during the October 15 ceremony and resigned.\n\nCossacks chasing participants of a patriotic demonstration in the church of St. Anna (public domain)Cossacks chasing participants of a patriotic demonstration in the church of St. Anny (public domain) - Domena publiczna / Portal historical Histmag.org\n\nGeneral Count Aleksandr Lüders was to try to calm the Poles. It is worth mentioning here a certain Russian captain who heroically defied the tsar. In April 1862, a cable from Russia arrived in Warsaw, which specified the method of counteracting potential demonstrations on the anniversary of last year's massacre. It was recommended to use a slash weapon, and in case of major problems - to shoot at demonstrators with cannons. The head of the military telegraph station Captain Alexandrov decided to change its content and order conservative handling of the demonstrators. However, his fraud was uncovered and he himself was sentenced to be shot by a military court. The tsar decided to change this sentence into a life sentence.\n\nReforms and the idea of ​​Wielopolski\n\nAleksander Wielopolski (photo: Karol Beyer, public domain)Aleksander Wielopolski (photo: Karol Beyer, public domain) - Karol Beyer / Historical portal Histmag.org\n\nThe issue of Poland was becoming problematic for the ruler of Russia, the more so as it involved more and more troops and resources that were needed elsewhere. Thus, at the beginning of 1862, a decision was made to introduce reforms to calm the mood. This time it was not supposed to be just a substitute for local governments, but the entire civil government. However, there was no question of a constitution, military or any political autonomy. The government was to be headed by a Pole - Aleksander Wielopolski, a man whose draft \"law on concurrents\" made it possible to shoot a hundred demonstrators on April 8, 1861.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the other hand, with his actions, he curbed the arbitrariness of many tsarist officials, introduced Poles to offices and fought for the development of education, also in Polish. It was thanks to his persuasions that the tsar agreed to the project of quite serious concessions and did not withdraw from them, despite the fact that in 1862 there was a series of unsuccessful attacks - in June on governor Lüders, in July on the brother of tsar prince Konstanty Mikołajewicz and in August twice on Wielopolski itself.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the Kingdom strove for open military confrontation. The Polish underground was divided into two camps - the Red group planning a fight and fueling the militant mood in the country, and the White party, which saw opportunities in organic work, forcing concessions and waiting for more favorable circumstances. The latter, seeing the risk of an uprising prepared by the Reds, even wanted to cooperate with Wielopolski, who was striving for the status quo , but the latter refused. Nevertheless, he introduced a new school law, compulsory renting of peasants and equality for the Jewish population, which he hoped to calm the moods.\n\nThey came for them at night\n\nWielopolski knew about the active red group and the fact that they were preparing an uprising. His idea to deal with the rebels was a prisoner to the army organized every year. Drafting into the tsarist army was almost tantamount to a death sentence - few of the called-ups managed to return home after the service, and even if they were, they were usually sick or severely mutilated. This time, however, the captive was not to take place by drawing, but on the basis of a carefully prepared list of people suspected of belonging to the anti-Russian movement. It became the direct cause of the accelerated outbreak of the uprising.\n\nBranka of Poles to the Russian army (author: Aleksander Sochaczewski, public domain)Branka of Poles to the Russian army (author: Aleksander Sochaczewski, public domain) - Aleksander Sochaczewski / Historical portal Histmag.org\n\nThe planned action could not be kept completely secret, therefore, on January 3, the National Central Committee, consisting of Oskar Awejdy, Józef Kajetan Janowski, Jan Maykowski, Zygmunt Padlewski and priest Karol Mikoszewski, decided to start the uprising with the start of the captivity. The one in Warsaw took place on the night of January 14-15. Many conscripts managed to escape, and then began to organize into armed groups. On January 19, the Central National Committee appointed the first dictator of the uprising, quoted in the introduction by Ludwik Mierosławski. In the provinces, captives were to take place on January 25, so the Russians had to be scavenged. On the night of January 22-23, 1863, the National Central Committee issued a manifesto in which it declared itself the Provisional National Government and called on all Poles to fight.\n\nBibliography:\n\n155 years ago the January Uprising broke out [in:] czas.pl , January 17, 2019 [accessed January 17, 2019]\n\nŁossowski Piotr, Zygmunt Młynarski, Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians in the January Uprising , National Institute of Ossoliński, Wrocław 1959.\n\nPawliszczew Mikołaj, Weeks of the Polish Rebellion , vol.
