        "text": "January 10, 1991\n\nFollowing the election of a new non-Soviet government on February 24, 1990, the parliament or Seimas of Lithuania, on March 11, 1990, re-establishes the independent Republic of Lithuania and re-instates its constitution. In January of 1991, Gorbachev demands the restoration of the constitution of the USSR in Lithuania and the revocation of all laws contrary to the Soviet constitution.\n\nHe warns that military intervention to quell the unrest in Lithuania could be possible within days.\n\nLithuanian officials demand that Moscow not send in armed troops but receive no reply from Gorbachev.\n\nSpecial Soviet military units, a counter-terrorism team and paratroopers are already stationed in Lithuania as of January 8-9.\n\nUsing Soviet special forces, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, the Soviets' plan is to occupy government buildings, seize communications facilities and arrest the non-Communist government.\n\nIn response to increased Soviet military activities, people from Vilnius and from all over Lithuania are called to protect and encircle the main strategic buildings: the Supreme Council – the parliament (Seimas), the Radio and Television Centre, the Vilnius Television and Communications tower and the main telephone exchange.\n\nJanuary 11, 1991\n\nOn January 10th, Head of the Supreme Council and first head of state of Lithuania, Vytautas Landsbergis is presented an ultimatum to comply with Gorbachev‘s request by a deadline of 15:00 hours on January 11th.\n\nSoviet military units begin seizing key buildings: National Defence Department, Vilnius’ main Publications House, and the Vilnius railway station. The Soviets allow the use of live ammunition against civilians.\n\nJanuary 12, 1991\n\nCrowds surround the main government buildings in Vilnius. They are unarmed, display signs of protest, sing patriotic songs that had been banned by the Soviets for 50 years. They chant „Lietuva, Lietuva, Lietuva“ (Lithuania,Lithuania, Lithuania) and pray.\n\nA column of Soviet military vehicles leaves the military base and heads toward the city centre.\n\nJanuary 13, 1991\n\nA second column of military vehicles leaves its base and heads for the Vilnius Television and Communications tower.\n\n1:25 am Soviet troops arrive at the tower and fire blank rounds\n\n1:50 am Soviet tanks and soldiers encircle the tower. Soldiers fire live ammunition overhead and then into the civilian crowd. Tanks drive through lines of people. Fourteen people are killed, most are shot but 2 are crushed by the tanks. One Soviet Alfa unit member is killed by friendly fire. Vytautas Landsbergis broadcasts to the nation calling on the people to offer no armed resistance, and states that Lithuania will be free.\n\n2:00 am Soviet tanks surround the Radio and Television Communications building. Soldiers fire live ammunition over the heads of unarmed civilians. The live TV broadcast is suddenly terminated. Paratroopers move into the building and remove everyone they find inside.\n\n2:30 am A small TV studio from Kaunas goes on air unexpectedly and tries to broadcast events as they are unfolding in as many languages as possible in an effort to reach media around the world.\n\nLarge crowds (20,000 during the night and over 50,000 by morning) gather around the Supreme Council Building – the parliament (Seimas). People build anti-tank barricades around it and surrounding buildings and set up defences inside the parliament (Seimas). The crowd prays, sings, and shouts pro-independence slogans. Despite the columns of military trucks and tanks in the vicinity, Soviet military forces retreat instead of attacking.\n\nAlthough occupation and military raids continued for several months following these attacks, there were no large, open military encounters after January 13th.\n\nThree videos depict the events of January 13th, 1991.\n\nWarning: The middle video below contains scenes of violence.\n\nEach video is in English and Lithuanian.\n\nTranscribed from an interview on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1991\n\nAlgis Pacevicius, President, Canadian-Lithuanian Community, Toronto, Ontario\n\nThe President (of Lithuania Vytautas Landsbergis) conveyed to me his feeling of profound disappointment in the Western governments – actually, the governments of the World. Although he is very encouraged by the statements of support that Lithuania and the new government are getting from all sources, he feels that the Western governments and the governments of the world could go one step further. They could make that important step – that is to grant full diplomatic recognition to the new government of Lithuania…. Canada’s response has been relatively strong.\n\nThey called in the Soviet ambassador’s assistant, I believe, yesterday in Ottawa and indicated to them that trade relations and relations in general between Canada and the Soviet Union would be in jeopardy depending on what happens in Lithuania. I think that was a very very strong statement. I think that the fact that the External Affairs Minister met with the Soviet representative personally is rather profound. On the other hand, with respect to the question of diplomatic recognition, the External Affairs Minister said that they’re reserving their judgement on that at the present time….\n\n…I think that the Western governments are very very careful at this point in time, but we are still confident that they will do the right thing and that one government, hopefully Canada, will take that moral step and that moral stand and will give full diplomatic recognition to Lithuania immediately. Interviewer: this puts the most progressive Soviet government in a difficult situation. Let’s turn that around a little bit. Mr. De Klerk in South Africa, he’s enacted a lot of reforms. He’s a liberal. If we were saying let’s not go too quickly, let’s not take the chance of defrocking him, he wants to, let’s say, bring in a 5year or a 10year plan for apartheid, nobody’s going to listen. They’re going to want apartheid finished TODAY, because it’s a moral question, it’s a question of principle. And that’s exactly what’s happening in Lithuania. It’s a moral question. It’s a question of principle. There should be no delay and it should happen immediately.\n\n…The Soviet Union, I think, has been watching very keenly as to how the world reacts. They watched very keenly as to how Senator Kennedy reacted yesterday when President Gorbachev indicated to him that force will not be used unless lives are in danger. Before that it was just simply “force will not be used”. Now he added that little, I think significant, few words “unless lives are in danger”. President Landsbergis says this is a clear signal that they are getting ready to orchestrate an incident, provoke violence and then come down very very strong and use force. Now, the result of that could be disbanding Parliament, arresting the leaders of the government, and the President of the Soviet Union invoking his executive powers putting in a Soviet-controlled government.\n\n…The West has to show Mr. Gorbachev very very clearly that there’s going to be a high price to pay if he interferes with the actions that the Lithuanians have taken in Lithuania. This is something we have to remember about the Declaration of Independence. It came about as the result of a process that began in Moscow. Everything that was done followed the letter of the law. What kind of a signal is that sending out to the other republics – every one of them wants independence. If they do as the Lithuanians do, peacefully and democratically and constitutionally, they’ll be crushed. On the other hand, maybe they’re sending out a signal that violence is the only way for them.\n\nTranscribed from an interview on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1991\n\nKarla Gruodis, Canadian student in Vilnius\n\n…A lot of [Lithuanian] people probably didn’t understand the legal complexities of what has happened in the Parliament and then they were also apprehensive about what would happen next. Now in the last week there is a real shift in people’s reaction and if there’s one thing that’s happening as a result of this increased military presence and this real pressure that is being put on Lithuania, is that people are going to be mobilized to this cause even more than ever before, I think. They might not show it outright, but I think each person or almost every person will feel even more strongly than ever that they don’t want to be part of…to live in the Soviet Union…\n\nInterviewer: how did you end up there? I actually came here to study and about halfway through my stay here, which started in September, I was approached to edit an English newspaper that started coming out and that’s been my main work since then… Interviewer: there’s other Canadians with you? Yeah, there’s actually about half a dozen Canadians in Vilnius, quite a lot. In fact, when all the students who are now helping out and doing various things in relation to what is going on here, when we’re all together, …sometimes it looks as though there are more Canadians than Americans which is rather odd but very nice. Most of them are people I’ve known for a long time.\n\nInterviewer: Moscow wants foreigners out – have you heard about that and does it apply to you?) We heard about that a couple of hours ago. It actually asked all foreign citizens to leave Lithuania and then said this includes diplomats, foreign correspondents and businessmen, so clearly it includes us. However, this is when the situation gets interesting and it will be very telling what happens on this issue because the people who are here, including myself, consider that they are in Lithuania not the Soviet Union, so what does an order from Moscow mean? What we will see in the next couple of days is whether or not Moscow is really serious about that or if that’s just another one of its tactics to make people uncomfortable, to get people worried or whether or not there will be some kind of attempt to implement it. If the Soviet government actually gets to the point of forcing us to leave, then that will be a very very bad sign. That will be a clear sign that some kind of major use of violence is ahead because that’s what the Soviet Union has done almost every time it’s used force in a large way. They just got rid of all the foreigners. They did the same thing in Baku, in Armenia. There’s very few journalists in Tbilisi last April, in Georgia. So that will be a very very bad sign. I hope, I’m hoping it won’t get to that. That in fact this is just another empty threat or empty order from Moscow."
