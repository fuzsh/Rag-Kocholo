        "text": "Licensed Real Estate Salesperson\n\nMarissa enjoys getting to know each client so she can efficiently find their perfect place to call home. Highly motivated, meticulous, and a clear communicator, her clients appreciate the calm energy she brings to a process that is often hectic. They also appreciate her devotion to them. Marissa’s clients have described her as \"so intuitive that she knows what they need without even saying it,” and a “rare” find because of how much she truly cares.\n\nMarissa researches every detail leaving no stone unturned, has uncompromised determination and brings a competitive edge to every deal, ensuring her clients get the best possible outcome. She is a highly skilled negotiator, extremely perceptive, and has a freakishly, super human memory. She consistently provides exclusive insight so clients can make informed, confident decisions.\n\nWhile Marissa can assist clients in any part of the city, she currently specializes in Midtown and below. Her specific neighborhoods include: Flatiron, Union Square, Gramercy, West Village, Greenwich Village, Lower East Side, East Village, and Seaport.\n\nMarissa is a multi-tasker by nature and has boundless energy and focus. She completed her coursework and passed her real estate exams in 3 weeks while working her full time job as a personal fitness professional. She works closely with four families training each family member ranging from teen to adult. Marissa learns from each individual as much as they learn from her. She is in tune with how her clients feel and what they need and adjusts accordingly. Marissa chooses to work in real estate because she loves architecture, appreciates design and is a natural salesperson.\n\nOriginally from Dallas, Texas, Marissa relocated to the city in 2012. She currently calls the Lower East Side home and loves everything about the neighborhood from its restaurants, bars, and rooftop venues to its pilates and yoga studios, salons and galleries. For Marissa, the sense of community her neighborhood offers is a huge selling point.\n\nWorking by the mantra: “Finding your home is like dating; when you know you know,” Marissa makes it her mission to help each client “know.” When she’s not assisting her clients she is pursuing her many interests: interior design, modern art, live music, comedy, travel and being a foodie. Volunteer : Meals on Wheels and working with a private middle school teaching group cardio classes. She is also passionate about giving back and is a donor of Terra Firma National, The United Breast Cancer Foundation, Alzheimer's Association, and SPCA."
