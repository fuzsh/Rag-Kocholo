        "text": "Land Records\n\nThere is a land record in Chester County of interest in showing George Chandler's intent to come to America and that his residence was indeed Wiltshire. It is a Lease and Release dated December 1725, but the history of the land includes the sale of land by William Penn beginning in 1681 to several parties in the county of Wilts [England]. These parties began selling off portions of the land to other parties in the county of Wilts. These sales included one by Daniel Smith on 29 September 1687 of 2000 acres excepting 100 acres that Daniel Smith had sold to George Chandler (Abstracts of Chester Co Land Records, Vol 2, page 56).\n\nAnother record in Volume 4 of a deed recorded 13 September 1753 also contains land history of interest: \"Whereas James Brown by deed dated 9 March 1687 granted to John Chandler and Jane his wife, the 100 acres. Whereas John Chandler died and said land descended to his wife Jane, who by her deed dated 1695 granted to George Chandler, the 100 acres. Whereas John Taylor, Sheriff by virtue of a writ obtained in the court of Common Pleas seized 100 acres and by deed dated 18 July 1724 granted to George Chandler (the son of the aforesaid Chandler). Whereas Swithon Chandler, William Chandler and Thomas Chandler, sons of Jane Chandler, and Robert Jeffries and Jane his wife and Ann Romine (Jane & Ann being daughters of Jane Chandler) did release 100 acres to George Chandler, release being dated 26 March 1726... .\" This deed goes on to mention transactions by Robert Jeffries and George Chandler concerning the land. One almost needs a program to follow the relationships! The John Chandler with wife Jane appears to actually be George Chandler I and wife Jane and seems to refer to the same 100 acres that George Chandler purchased while still in England. Jane then granted the 100 acres to her son George Chandler II, and finally the land went to George Chandler III when seized by the Sheriff. Daughter Jane's marriage to Robert Jeffries is proven. The mention of Ann Romine is not so clear - was it actually Ann Robbins?\n\nAnother deed (Vol 1) dated 11 Oct 1700 refers to a land transaction of one John Gibbons. It refers to a deed by William Penn dated 1 and 2 Aug 1681 to John Gibbons for 500 acres and \"whereas William Hawks of Chichester had a tract lying in the Governor's manor adjoining the land of John Gibbons Sr., containing 150 acres. William Hawks devised the tract to his wife Jane Hawks and Jane Hawks for the natural love she bears to her sons George Chandler and Swithin Chandler. George Chandler and Swithin Chandler by their deed dated 23 April 1696 granted 150 acres to John Gibbons...\"\n\nWills\n\nTwo wills are of interest to us in proving the names of the children of George and Jane Chandler. The first is that of William Hawkes of Chichester Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. He wrote his will 11/30/1693 and it was proven 11/20/1694 in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. In his will he names his wife Jane (sole executrix) and left legacies to his sons-in-law and daughters-in-law Chandler. In that time period the term \"in-law\" was often used instead of \"step.\" Robert Jeffries witnessed the will but his name was blotted out by the testator (as husband of Jane Chandler, Jr., he would have been too closely related to act as witness.) Further proof that Jane was wife of William Hawkes is found in Chester County land records. A release on 31 Oct 1738 includes reference to a sale of land granted by deed of William Penn in 1681 to John Gibbons. It continues \"whereas William Howkes late of Chichester had a certain tract of land, joining the said land of John Gibbons containing 150 acres. William Hawkes devised the said tract to his wife and executrix Jane Hawkes and the said Jane Hawkes out of natural love did freely give the 150 acres to her sons George Chandler and Swithin Chandler, who by their deed dated 23 Apr 1696 granted the 150 acres to John Gibbons.\" (Abstr of Chester Co Land Records, Vol 3, page 71)\n\nThe second is a will of John Chandler of Chichester, Chester County, Pennsylvania, written 11/30/1699 and proven 9/30/1703 in Philadelphia County. In it he names his kinsman George Chandler and wife Ruth; Friends Richard Edmunds of Warr in Wiltshire; Ann Chandler; William Chandler; James Baylis; and Jane Jefferes. Executors were kinsmen Swethen Chandler and Thomas Chandler. Overseers were Jacob Chandler and Walter Martin. Mary Bezer the wife of Ezekial Hardin deposed as to the execution of the will on 4/21/1703 so we know John died before that date. John Chandler administered the deposition on October 6, 1703. There are several points of information in this will and several questions. While it is clear that John Chandler was a close relative of George and Jane Chandler it is unclear who Jacob and John Chandler, the administrator, were. If they were sons of John, Sr., they are not named in the will, but could have already received their legacy in land. A Jacob and Elizabeth Chandler jointly witnessed a deed on 7 March 1692, probably husband and wife. John Chandler is mentioned as owning land in 1691 near Chester Creek. The name of Jane Chandler's husband, Robert Jeffries is proven. The name of James Baylis, third husband of Jane Chandler, Sr. is proven, but it is unclear why Jane herself is not named - we know she was still alive in 1713 when her son George wrote his will (below) It may be nothing more than the fact that females were not recognized as entities separate from their husband in this time period. The name of George Chandler Jr's wife is proven as Ruth, and it likely was Bezer, since Mary Bezer would have been acting on her behalf when she made her deposition. Charity Chandler was apparently deceased as she is not named. And we know that only George and Jane Chandler, Jr. were married by 1699, making it likely that they were the two oldest children.\n\nMore on the Children of George and Jane Chandler\n\nGeorge Chandler Jr Family\n\nSon George Chandler of Chichester, Chester County, Pennsylvania, wrote his will on 11/12/1713 and it was proven 8/5/1715 in Chester County. His will also proves some of the relationships above. Unfortunately he does not mention the names of his children: \"all children to have equal shares except eldest son, his share and his mother's to be double that of the other children.\" Will executors were wife Ruth and brothers Swithin and Thomas Chandler. A codicil of same date as the will gives to mother Jane Bayliss, 5 pounds, so we know she was still alive at that time. Ruth Bezer has been proposed as the name of his wife, and as discussed above in the will of John Chandler is probably correct.\n\nGeorge and Ruth Chandler had a son, George Chandler, who married Esther Taylor. They had a son, Isaac Chandler, born 10/30/1732, who married Esther Chandler, daughter of Swithin and Ann Wilson Chandler. Swithin Chandler who married Ann Wilson was son of Swithin and Ann Chandler below. Isaac and Esther Chandler had a son, Spencer Chandler, born 2/23/1759, who married Hannah Taylor on 3/16/1837 at Kennett Monthly Meeting in Chester County, Pennsylvania.\n\nGeorge Chandler owned land in Chichester which is mentioned in a land deed recorded 30 March 1747 as lying in Chichester, bounded by the western branch of Naamans Creek, land of George Chandler, the middle branch of Naamans Creek, and land of Robert Eyers and Robert Booth. This appears to be the same land as mentioned above in the first paragraph of our discussion - as that deed mentions land bounding Naamans Creek. A deed on 14 Oct 1752 contains a reference to the same bounding of a tract but says land \"late of George Chandler.\" Evidently he no longer owned the land. Another deed in 1754 references land on Naaman's Creek and land of George Chandler and Francis Bowater containing 51 acres and land of Walter Martin and William Chandler containing 3 acres.\n\nOther children mentioned for George and Ruth Chandler:\n\nFrom First Families of Chester County, Vol 2, page 82, Jacob Hollingsworth, son of Thomas and Grace Hollingsworth married 2/23/1729 at Centre Meeting House, to Rachel Chandler of Birmingham, spinster daughter of George and Ruth (Bezer) Chandler. We do not know if (Bezer) was inserted by the author or is found in the original Newcastle County, Delaware marriage records;\n\nFrom will of Thomas Chandler, brother of George, he leaves a bequest to John and Isaac Chandler, children of \"brother George.\"\n\nSwithin and Ann Chandler Family\n\nSon Swithin Chandler, with brother Thomas, settled on the Brandywine just below the line in Newcastle County, Delaware. We do not know the maiden name of Ann for sure: both James and Bowater have been proposed (Bowater may be a mixup for Ann Bowater who married William Chandler).\n\nThe children of Swithin and Ann Chandler were: Jacob Chandler, born 2/9/1705, married Martha Greave; Charity Chandler, born 1/20/1707, married John Nichols; Ann Chandler, born 2/1/1709, married George Dixon; Jane Chandler, born 3/11/1711, married John Greave; Sarah Chandler, born 3/20/1713, married Jonathan Greave; Swithin Chandler, born 10/1/1715, married Ann Wilson; Thomas Chandler, born 10/3/1718, married (1)Elizabeth Gibson, and (2) Ann Hickline; Margaret Chandler, born 5/6/1721; Mary Chandler, born 5/18/1723; Phebe Chandler, born 3/31/1726; Betty Chandler, 1/25/1729; Hannah Chandler, born 4/4/1732. All the information on the children is from \"Delaware Quaker Records: Newcastle County\" on Genealogylibrary.com. They are referenced to Cope's Chandler Genealogy, page 281. (We have found errors in these records as one might expect, being a third transcription.)\n\nSwithin Chandler, son of Swithin and Ann Chandler married Ann Wilson, a Woodward descendant (see Swithin and Ann Wilson Chandler page.)\n\nJacob Chandler, son of Swithin and Ann Chandler, married Martha Greave, daughter of Samuel and Sarah Greave, on 7/3/1730 at Center Monthly Meeting, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. They had children: Sarah Chandler; Miriam Chandler; Martha Chandler; Ann Chandler, married William Smith; Lydia Chandler; Mary Chandler, married Amor Hollingsworth; and Hannah Chandler\n\nThomas Chandler, son of Swithin and Ann Chandler, married Elizabeth Gibson on 1/23/1742. Elizabeth died young, probably in childbirth, and Thomas married second to Ann Hickline in 1747. His will was proven 4 June 1782 and names wife (not by name), sons Thomas and Jesse Chandler; father, Swithin Chandler, dec'd; brother Swithin Chandler and Ann his wife; cousin Thomas Chandler; daughter Dinah Gregg and her husband; granddaughter Elizabeth Hollingsworth. Executors were sons Thomas and Jesse Chandler. We believe the cousin Thomas Chandler, named in the will, to be son of uncle William Chandler (below) but do not have definitive proof. We are not certain which child belonged to which wife, except that the marriage record of the widow of son Jesse Chandler (Martha Tate) to Samuel Painter in 1787 names Thomas and Ann Chandler of Christiana Hundred as the parents of the deceased Jesse Chandler. This is quoted in Vol 2 of First Families of Chester County, Pa, page 123, and it is also noted there from records of Kennett Monthly Meeting that Martha had one child by Jesse, Sr., named Jesse, Jr. There is also a notation in Vol 1, First Families, page 56 that Jesse Chandler, son of Jesse and Martha Chandler of Christiana Hundred married in 1806 to Rebecca Marshall, daughter of Thomas and Mary Grubb Marshall. When time permits we will examine the Quaker records ourselves to see if there is additional information.\n\nWilliam and Ann Bowater Chandler Family\n\nWe are fairly certain that William's wife was Ann Bowater, daughter of John and Frances Corbett Bowater. On August 22, 1713 when Francis Bowater of Chichester, widow, sold 115 acres of land on Chichester Creek for 130 pounds to William Flower, William Chandler was witness. Frances Corbett Bowater in her will of 1720 names daughter Ann Chandler. Some of the land records of John Bowater are given on our John and Sarah Bowater Beals page (Sarah was a niece of John Bowater).\n\nWe are not totally certain that the cousin Thomas mentioned in the will of Thomas above refers to Thomas, son of William and Ann. We do know that William and Ann had a son Thomas as he is mentioned in the will of William's brother Thomas, below. The will mentions Thomas with a wife Hannah and a daughter Mary which is a match.\n\nThomas Chandler, son of William and Ann Chandler, was born 6/11/1724 He married Hannah Wilson 9/15/1749 at Center Monthly Meeting, Chester County, Pennsylvania (Quaker records - Kennett Monthly Meeting, Chester County). Hannah was daughter of Christopher and Esther Woodward Wilson. Hannah was then granddaughter of Richard and Esther Davis Woodward. Thomas and Hannah Wilson Chandler had children: Mary Chandler, born 7/9/1750, married William Harvey as second wife; Jane Chandler, born 5/21/1752, died 6/17/1777; Joshua Chandler, born 11/18/1757, died young; Rebecca Chandler, born 3/18/1760, died young; Hannah Chandler, born 6/7/1674, died young; Ann Chandler, born 12/7/1767, died young; Thomas Chandler, born 4/28/1773.\n\nThe will of Thomas Chandler below mentions additional children of William: Ann, Mary and Moses. William's own will mentions a son William. We have further information only on Ann.\n\nFirst Families of Chester County, Vol. 1, page 138, quoting Births, deaths and marriages of the Nottingham Quakers, by Alice Beard, tells us that Ann Chandler, daughter of William and Ann Chandler of Londongrove, married Joseph Trimble as second wife on 2/22/1753 at East Nottingham Meeting. She was born 12/27/1721 and died 11/31/1793 and is buried at Nottingham graveyard. They had children: Joseph Trimble, Jr 10/29/1754; Thomas, 5/4/1756; Jacob 2/27/1758; Sarah, 5/23/1760, married Job Sidwell; James 4/20/1762; Elisha 3/18/1765, married Anna Wilson.\n\nWith the above identification of children we were able to recognize the will of William Chandler of Londongrove written 6/30/1745 and proven 12/16/1746 as being this William Chandler. He does not mention a wife so she was likely deceased. He left to his son John his house and land containing about 100 acres, he paying to daughter Anne 15 pounds at age 21. To son Thomas 10 pounds at 21. To son Moses 20 pounds at 21. To daughter Mary 15 pounds and other articles named. To son William 15 pounds. Executor was son William so he was evidently over age 21. Witnesses were Thomas Carleton, Joshua Pusey, and Joshua Mendenhall.\n\nWilliam Chandler purchased land from James Brown of Chichester on 17 November 1700. His occupation is given as cordwainer. The land was a lot in Chichester bounded by New Street, lots of James Brown and Walter Martin. The price was 4.3 pounds.\n\nThomas and Mary Chandler Family\n\nWe have a probable wife's maiden name of Mary Mankin. A Mankin Web Site gives Mary Mankin, daughter of Richard Mankin, as marrying a Thomas Chandler whose father died at sea.\n\nFrom Thomas Chandler's will, written 10/8/1753 and proven 6/25/1761 in Birmingham, Chester County, we learn more about other Chandler relationships. His will provides for wife Mary. He leaves his watch, large Bible and desk to Thomas Chandler, son of brother William. To his sister Ann Jones and her two daughters and grandson Henry Chads he leaves 15 pounds to be divided. To son John Chandler, son of brother George 15 pounds. To Isaac son of brother George 20 pounds. To Ann, Mary, and Moses, children of brother William 15 pounds to be divided. To Mary, daughter of Thomas and Hannah Chandler 5 pounds. To George Chandler, son of brother George 5 shillings. To Thomas Chandler, son of brother William \"plantation where I now live subject to wife's interest, also residuary legatee and Executor.\" It appears from this will that Thomas and Mary did not have living children in 1753. The bequests are interesting - he leaves a great deal to his nephew Thomas, probably his namesake, and leaves only the minimum required by law of 5 shillings to the son of his brother George.\n\nAnn Chandler, daughter of George and Jane Chandler\n\nMore research is needed on Ann, daughter of George and Jane. She was not yet married on 11/30/1699 when her kinsman John Chandler wrote his will. She is named as Ann Romine, daughter of Jane Chandler, in a 1726 land record. She is named as Ann Jones in the 1753 will of her brother Thomas above. The name Romine is not seen elsewhere in Chester County so may well be an error but Robbins seems a far stretch. In 1753 Ann had two daughters, one married to a Chads, as grandson Henry Chads is mentioned in John Chandler's will.\n\nEstate of George Chandler\n\nA True Inventory of the goods & Chattelle of George Chandler who Deceased the xiii day of December 1687, in his passage to pennsilvania; Taken & apprized by us Whose Names are heer under written the xth Day of the Seaventh mo'1688.

He has numerous family documents and is willing to share information. He also has comments from \"A Record of the Descendants of George and Jane Chandler (who immigrated to Pennsylvania from Wiltshire, England in 1687) with a Pedigree of the Chandlers of Oare, Wiltshire\" published by the Chandler Family Reunion Committee in Philadelphia in 1937. Unfortunately I have misplaced his address so cannot put anyone in contact with him.\n\nAdvertisement"
