        "text": "*Hello Connections,* I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you today with a heavy heart to share a difficult situation my family is currently facing. My mother, Sarita Devi, has been suffering from a severe spine injury and doctors have advised her to undergo immediate surgery. Unfortunately, our family was hit with another blow when my mother accidentally slipped on the stairs and sustained critical injuries. We have already *paid 3.5 lakh* towards the medical expenses, but we *still need 4 lakh more* to cover the remaining costs. This has put our family in both emotional and financial trauma, as my mother's pain is unbearable to watch. I am humbly requesting your help in raising funds for my mother's surgery. Any amount you can contribute will be greatly appreciated and will go towards helping my mother heal and recover. *Donation link:* https://lnkd.in/dUxPBiVv #fundraiser #help #support #kindness #Impactguru #fundraising #extendhelp #charity #humanity #connections #people #donations#ICU#help#pain#mother#painfree#illness#painfree#spreadkindness#spreadhappiness#beinghuman#heart#brain#wife#spreadhappiness#behope#givehope#bekind##beinghuman#heart#behope#givehope#bekind#urgent#trending#beahope#helpus#cbfr#healing#trending\n\nMichigan Patients Need YOUR Help! I hope this message finds you well and warm during these snowy, cold weeks we've had! I am one of the blood drive coordinators for my local Alger Heights (Grand Rapids) community and would love to see you at our upcoming drive this month! Please join us on Tuesday, January 30th from 1:30pm - 6:00pm at Seymour Christian Reformed Church (840 Alger St. SE, Grand Rapids MI 49507) to donate your precious life source! Click the link or QR code below to sign up for an appointment: https://lnkd.in/gyqCRXXd Blood Donation Facts You Probably Didn't Know: - Someone needs blood every 2 seconds. - Just one blood donation can save up to 3 lives. - There is no substitute for human blood. - On average, 1 in every 7 people entering a hospital will need blood. - A single car accident victim can require as many as 100 units of blood. - More than 75% of all Americans reaching age 72 will need donated blood within their lifetime; 97% will have a loved one who will need blood. - 17% of people who don’t give blood cite “never thought about it” as the main reason for not donating, while 15% say they’re “too busy.” - Donating blood burns 650 calories. Donating blood is one of my favorite things to do because I know I am helping save lives of those in my community. What a rewarding way to give back to others, especially this month as we honor and celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.! I truly thank you for your consideration in signing up to donate blood this month. The need continues to increase with a decrease in donors. I know life is busy and we have other priorities, but I implore you to think what just an hour or so out of your day could do for someone else. If it was your family or friend's life on the line, would you make the time?\n\nHelp save Mrs. Riskat Soliu’s life We are reaching out on behalf of Mrs. Riskat Soliu, a resilient individual facing the challenges of Type II Mandibular Ameloblastoma.

Genetic testing can help them find the cause of their child's symptoms and get the right treatment. However, some insurance companies do not cover genetic testing, leaving these families with a huge financial burden. That's why donating to Take Part Foundation is so important. Take Part Foundation is a nonprofit organization that provides funding for families who get denied access to genetic testing by their insurance but need the test to help diagnosis their child in order to get coverage for their needs. By donating to Take Part Foundation, you can make a difference in the lives of these families and help them get the care they deserve. We have currently started a fund at St. Louis Children's Hospital to help close the financial gap for families pursuing this testing - testing that could result in access to resources that can dramatically improve their child’s ability to thrive! Will you join us? https://lnkd.in/g_xG-6dg\n\nHi all! I would like to share that I will be participating in STEPtember to raise awareness for cerebral palsy.

Bharat's friends, relatives and myself are helping to raise funds for Bharat's family. https://gofund.me/2a7192da Bharat is currently fighting for his life in the Memorial Hermann Memorial City Medical Center in Houston, after experiencing a severe cardiac arrest on November 6th, 2023. Despite a quick surgery and the placement of a stent for a major block, he has not regained consciousness and remains in critical condition with only ventilator support. Although his heart is functioning to an extent, Bharat has suffered a severe brain injury based on an MRI, and 80% of his brain is not functioning. Unfortunately, Bharat's condition has deteriorated in the last couple of days and the doctors hold very little hope to none for his recovery. This has become a life-shattering event for his wife and child, who find themselves lost in this very life changing and challenging situation. Bharat is just 39 years old. Bharat was born in India and recently moved to Houston, Texas, six months ago. He was working as a Software Engineer, and was widely known to be a calm, composed, well-mannered and wonderful human being. Bharat is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a great friend to many. Bharat's kind and helpful nature has touched many lives around him. Bharat is the sole support for his wife and 6-year-old daughter, who are both financially and emotionally dependent on him. In an effort to provide assistance during this difficult time, friends and family have initiated a GoFundMe campaign on behalf of Bharat's wife and child. Your donation, regardless of size, will contribute significantly to ensuring financial support for them throughout this crisis. Here's how you can help: https://gofund.me/2a7192da 1. Donate: Your financial support will make a significant impact on Bharat’s family. 2. Spread the word: Please share this campaign with your network. The more people who know about it, the better the chances of reaching our goal. 3. Send prayers and positive vibes: Even if you are unable to donate for any reason, your thoughts and prayers mean the world to us. We understand that times are challenging for many, but any form of assistance is greatly appreciated. Your generosity will not only touch the hearts of Bharat's family but will also make a significant difference in their lives. Thank you for your compassion and support during this extremely challenging time. #jobpostings"
