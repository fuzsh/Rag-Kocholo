        "text": "Have you met Debbie and Bobby Chandler? The Chandlers joined Mountain Brook Baptist on December 10, 2023. We hope you'll get to know them a little better through this latest \"Meet Our New Member\" blog, and that you'll have the chance to connect with them one Sunday in worship.\n\nTell us about your family. We have been married for 27 years. We have one son, Cars, who is married to Libby McKee Chandler. They graduated from Auburn in May 2022 and moved to Huntsville.\n\nWhere do you work and where did you go to school? Debbie: I am from Muscle Shoals and went to Auburn. I was in sales for many years but I am now the COO of our home. ðŸ˜ƒ Bobby: I am a partner at Precision Pipe and Products and went to Mountain Brook High School and The University of Alabama.\n\nWhat led you to Mountain Brook Baptist Church? Debbie: We were looking for community, along with gospel and Bible-centered teaching and had good friends who were very happy here. Bobby: Our good friends Sara Lynne and John Keith were very happy there, and when we visited many people, including Wayne and Mary, were so friendly and the messages were Christ and gospel-centered.\n\nWhat is your favorite Bible story or verse, and/or your favorite hymn or praise song? Debbie: Isaiah 40:8 - the grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of God endures forever. Bobby: Proverbs 3:5 - lean not on your own understanding.\n\nWhat are some of your hobbies and interests? Debbie: Gardening, tennis, community events, and projects; Bobby: Fishing, hunting, golf, and Big Time Ministry."
