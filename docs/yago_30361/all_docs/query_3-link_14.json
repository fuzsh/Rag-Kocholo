        "text": "Deceased May 22, 2022\n\nView alumni profile (log in required)\n\nRead obituary\n\nIn Memory\n\nDonald Chandler Young Jr. died in Tampa, Fla., on May 22, 2022, at the age of 87, after a brief hospitalization. He was born on Feb. 26, 1935, in Springfield, Mass., the son of Donald Chandler Young Sr. and Barbara Davis Young of Amherst.\n\nChandler matriculated at Amherst in 1954 after graduating from St. Peter’s Preparatory School in Tampa, Fla. He majored in American studies and pledged Beta Theta Pi fraternity, where he was elected recorder. Chandler joined the Outing Club; earned freshman numerals in swimming; and also played baseball, football and lacrosse.\n\nAfter graduating from Amherst, Chandler served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy. While on a tour of duty in Adak, Alaska, Chandler met Sandra Hope Ferebee, whom he married after leaving the Navy in 1962. At the time of his death, Chandler and Sandra had been married 60 years.\n\nAfter the military, Chandler enrolled in Tufts University in Medford, Mass., where he completed his master’s degree under the G.I. Bill. During this period, his children, Heather and Bo, were born.\n\nChandler’s initial career was in secondary education, first as a teacher and eventually as a principal. After a dozen years, Chandler left education to pursue a business career. Starting in sales, he joined Sandra’s thriving business as vice president. He later joined Helveston-Fox Premier Sales as a manufacturer’s representative, a position he maintained for many years, not retiring until he was well into his 70s.\n\nChandler’s superb people skills not only served him well in business but also made him a great father and an outstanding grandfather to his three grandchildren. In retirement, he and Sandra enjoyed traveling in the United States and abroad, taking numerous photos to record their travels.\n\nNed Megargee ’58"
