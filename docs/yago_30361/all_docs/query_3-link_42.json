        "text": "Bonita Springs, FL, and Bangor - James E. Chandler, Jr., 85, died December 13, 2016, in Florida, following a long struggle with Parkinson's. Chandler, a graduate of Boston University's College of Business Administration, was the son of Mabell and J. Earle Chandler, of Rumford, Maine. He was married to Donna Holmes Chandler in 1954 and later to Pearl Arnheim Nibur in 1986.\n\nChandler, an Air Force officer and reservist, began his civilian career in his father's mercantile establishment in Rumford, before moving to Bangor. He worked at Cortell-Segal before opening his own store, J E Chandler, Ltd., in Orono in 1963. The business moved to Bangor and then Brewer, and also had a summer location in Northeast Harbor, Maine. Not content with retirement, Chandler worked in economic development and chamber of commerce management, in Belfast and Biddeford/Saco, attaining his CAE certification. He relocated to Estero, Florida, in 2009.\n\nJim was an avid boater and was active in the United States Power Squadron, Penobscot Bay, as well as serving on the District 19 Bridge. He enjoyed cruising the New England coast in his Viking 33, and later a Hatteras 53, both named WinterSong. A music lover, Jim was a longtime member of the Anah Temple Shrine Band, playing tenor sax and clarinet. He enjoyed reunions with his Alpha Kappa Psi brothers in Boston and Florida.\n\nJim is survived by his daughter, Jamie Chandler Grofik and husband Michael of Bonita Springs, FL, grandson Lt. Justin C. Grofik, USN and wife Jennifer of Hanford, CA, and several nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his son, James E. \"Jay\" Chandler III, and wives Donna and Pearl.\n\nFollowing Jim's wishes, there will be no formal services. The family will host a memorial gathering in Maine at the time of interment in the spring of 2017. For those who wish to contribute in Jim's name, please consider the Parkinson Association of SW Florida, 1048 Goodlette-Frank Road, Ste 201, Naples, FL 34102, or a charity of your choice. Condolences to the family may be expressed at ."
