No.: 03x68\n\nQuantity:49 items\n\nLocation:9 A 5\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL STATEMENT\n\nTheophilus Parsons Chandler was assistant treasurer at the Customs House in Boston and a financial backer of the Dupont Company. He married Elizabeth Julia Schlatter, who was from a prominent Philadelphia family, and lived in Brookline, Mass. The Chandlers had at least four sons (Charles, who died around 1865, Theophilus Jr., Alfred Dupont, and Sumner) and probably three daughters (Mary, Alice, and Fannie or Fanny). Elizabeth corresponded with Sophie Madeline du Pont, the wife of Admiral Samuel Francis du Pont, with friends from Wilmington, Del., and with her Clark relatives in Pennsylvania.\n\nTheophilus Parsons Chandler, Jr. (1845-1928) was an important architect in late 19th century Philadelphia. He studied at Harvard and the Atelier Vaudremer in Paris and worked in Boston before moving to Philadelphia in the early 1870s. Among the buildings he designed was the train station of the Winterthur estate, near Wilmington, Del. He also planned alterations on the Winterthur house in the 1870s and 1880s. Although he drew plans for cottages which were published in Godeys Ladys Book, Chandler was especially noted for his church designs. He founded the Department of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and was a member of the American Institute of Architects and a number of civic and social organizations. The Philadelphia Athenaeum houses additional papers of his. On March 8, 1873, Chandler married Sophie Madeline du Pont (1851-1931), the daughter of Louisa Gerhard and Henry du Pont.\n\nAlfred Dupont Chandler (born 1847) graduated from Harvard, studied law with his father and R. H. Dana, Jr., and was a lawyer in New York and Boston. He married Mary Merrill Poor on December 27, 1882; they lived in Brookline. Alfred was a leader in many local and state reform movements.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nA group of letters, most of which are addressed to Elizabeth Julia Schlatter Chandler or to her husband Theophilus Parsons Chandler. The letters are from a number of different relatives and friends and discuss many topics, but there is no long run of correspondence with any one person. Also included is a small group of letters written by Philadelphia architect Theophilus Chandler, Jr. in which he mostly comments about social events and office work. His sister Alice visited him in October 1882, and her letters to their parents talk about his work. In one letter she sketched part of a Methodist church on which he was working. As well, the collection includes some business letters to Alfred Chandler, chiefly concerning some project to take place on Mt. Desert Island, Maine.\n\nORGANIZATION\n\nThe letters have been divided into three groups: letters to Mr. and Mrs. Theophilus Parsons Chandler; letters written by Theophilus Chandler, Jr., and his wife Sophie; and letters to Alfred D. Chandler. They are arranged in chronological order within each group.\n\nPROVENANCE\n\nPurchased from aGatherin of West Sand Lake, New York.
