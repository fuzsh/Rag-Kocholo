        "text": "James Francis Ward Jr. passed away peacefully on the evening of November 14, 2022, at the age of 91, with his family members by his side. Jim was born in Chicago, IL in 1930, to parents James F. Ward Sr. and Helen Drexel Ward. He was predeceased by his wife of 65 years Joan, his brothers Thomas and Neal, and is survived by his brothers Jack and Bernie, and his sister Susie.\n\nFollowing a courtship that began in high school, he married the true love of his life Joan Fields in 1954. They soon moved to South Carolina, where Jim began his career with the DuPont Company. Prior to their marriage, Jim graduated with a B.S. Degree in Chemical Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\nWithin the next ten years, they had seven children: Jimmy, Terry, Kevin (Karen), David, Carol, Lynn (Wayne) and Patrick (Loretta). Jim loved his family above all else. Jim was then transferred to DuPont headquarters in Wilmington DE, where they remained to raise their children and complete their life. Included in that completion was the addition of seven grandchildren: Cody and Owen Robinson, Rachel, Kelly, and Charlotte Ward, Amanda and Samantha Ward.\n\nJim also enjoyed all sports, especially golf. He was fortunate enough to attend the Masterâ€™s Tournament for several years, always accompanied by his lifelong friend Kish. There was always a crowd at the Ward household, and usually a game of wiffleball, basketball, football, tag, kick the can or some other game to keep everyone entertained.\n\nWe will all miss Dad but find solace in knowing he will be reunited with our mother.\n\nGoodbye for now Dad.\n\nA Funeral Mass will be held on Wednesday, November 23, 2022 at 11:00 AM at St. Mary Magdalen Church, 7 Sharpley Road, Wilmington, DE 19803. A visitation will be held prior from 10:00 to 11:00 AM. Interment will be private."
