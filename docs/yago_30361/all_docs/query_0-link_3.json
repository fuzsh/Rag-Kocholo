        "text": "Krystal found Marissa working at a massage parlor. The law student had just lost her parents and Krystal managed to get her fired; the two were arrested in a raid on the massage parlor before they could leave.\n\nLater, it came out that Krystal and David were Marissa's biological parents and Babe was her twin. Marissa began a life in Pine Valley and went to law school. She flirted with Scott, but ended up marrying JR Chandler and helped him beat cancer.\n\nAfter JR slept with Annie and Marissa slept with Scott, the couple decided to break up, but were soon engaged in a nasty custody battle over AJ. During this time, she passed the bar exam, began working for Caleb and saw Scott head off to prison for stealing the nanotech project from a deceased Palmer."
