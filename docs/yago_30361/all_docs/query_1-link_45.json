        "text": "PORTSMOUTH — Hand-blown glass sparkling with vibrancy, tie-dyed T-shirts in every bright color imaginable, scenic photographs of beautiful New England and handmade pottery creations are just a few examples of the crafts and arts one can find at this year's 38th annual Bow Street Fair.\n\nUnder numerous tents along both sides of Bow Street, craftsman and artisans display a wide range of artistic pieces. The fair serves as a fund-raiser for the Seacoast Repertory Theater, a not-for-profit arts and educational institution that provides theater entertainment at its Bow Street location.\n\n\"It's a two-day juried arts and crafts festival with the street fair flair that brings people into the downtown area - and to have the crowds that we usually do, it says a lot about the city,\" said Stacey Baker-Chilicki, the theater's director of marketing and publicity. \"It is one of our biggest fund-raisers of the year.\"\n\nBegun in 1966, the event each year has consistently drawn crowds of both locals and tourists, and has been a continued success for both the theater and the artisans who participate.\n\n\"I like the Portsmouth clientele and the tourism that the city offers,\" said Devitt Liptak, a pottery maker who featured her work inside one of the tents. \"There is something for everyone here, and it's a lot of fun.\"\n\nNeil Troost, a local photographer who has been working professionally since 1991, has only missed one out of the past dozen fairs.\n\n\"It is really just a wonderful street fair setting in historical Portsmouth on the waterfront,\" said Troost, who admitted that the entertainment is his favorite part. \"It's always a priority for me to come out here each year.\"\n\nTraditionally included in the two-day event, which completely shuts down Bow Street to vehicular traffic, is an assortment of food and refreshments, as well as live music and theatrical performances on both the main stage and the youth stage inside the theater. And, of course, the popular artisan booths - which Baker-Chilicki said include both high-end and low-end art - always serve as the main attraction.\n\n\"We enjoy walking up and down the street, taking a look at all of the things,\" said Linda Marsh, who came out to the fair with her family for the fifth time. \"There are excellent crafts, and the selection is good. The quality of stuff is just really beautiful.\"\n\nFirst-time fair attendees Dawn Rose and John Beleskas, a vacationing couple from Weymouth, Mass., joined the early crowd on Saturday to take in the artistic sights.\n\n\"It's eclectic,\" said Beleskas.\n\n\"We like the vendors with the pictures,\" said Rose. \"There are some really nice pictures of the area.\"\n\nAccording to Baker-Chilicki, over the years, the fair has become more than a fund-raiser, transforming itself into a community event.\n\n\"Even if it weren't a fund-raiser for us, we would still have it,\" she said. \"It has been 38 years of success and fun for the community. How do you stop that?\"\n\nThe Bow Street Fair continues today, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. For more information on the event, call the Seacoast Repertory Theater at 433-4793."
