        "text": "Hull strikes gold! Couldn't resist sharing a few lines from our Vice-Chancellor's Opinion piece in The Yorkshire Post. Wonderful ... absolutely doesn't cover it - that we have such a brilliant accolade to shout about! Professor Dave Petley, Vice-Chancellor at the University of Hull: \"It’s no secret: I’m absolutely delighted that we’ve been recognised as ranking with the best. A Gold rating – the highest award possible for student experience and student outcomes and a clear signal of excellence – will be celebrated on campus and beyond with students, staff and the local community sharing in our University’s success at a national level. \"You may be wondering what Hull did differently to receive this accolade – and the answer is, actually, quite a lot. Firstly, we’ve used feedback from our students to drive transformation of our approach to teaching, and to enhance our academic and pastoral support, empowering them to achieve their own personal and professional success. Our education is a partnership between the students and ourselves in which we both take responsibility for getting the best outcome for each and every learner. We’ve worked hard to ensure that our students are engaged with developments at the cutting edge of research, practice and scholarship. The TEF panel has recognised this. ... \"Since joining the University of Hull a little over a year ago, I’ve often remarked that the University is rather a hidden gem, a well-kept secret. I am certain that our Gold TEF award confirms we’re on a new, positive, trajectory and that this new – and undeniably exciting phase – will attract the attention of applicants, researchers and the HE sector as a whole. \"Students, staff and our many partners have given me a wonderful welcome to Hull. Everyone told me it’s a friendly university, with a real community feel on campus. That’s absolutely true – and you can be certain that our staff will be going out of their way to welcome all our new and returning students in the coming weeks. Our staff give so much of themselves – working above and beyond – and that’s why we are Gold! It is both thanks to the dedication of our staff and the application of our amazing students that we are celebrating this outstanding result.\" https://lnkd.in/dd7mpaSY #TEF2023 #highered #highereducation #studentexperience #teaching #Hull #Yorkshire"
