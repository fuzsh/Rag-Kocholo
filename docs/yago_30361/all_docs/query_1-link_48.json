        "text": "Soap Opera Digest is reporting the upcoming departures of All My Children's Adam Mayfield (Scott Chandler) and Brittany Allen (Marissa Tasker Chandler). According to SOD's source at AMC, the actors' exit is a result of the show's decision to take the characters in a different direction. There's speculation that the characters will eventually be recast. Former As the World Turns and Guiding Light star Daniel Cosgrove (Chris, ATWT; Bill, GL) previously portrayed Scott from 1996 - 1998.\n\nMore on Vincent Irizarry's character David's exit soapoperasource.com/amc/news/all-my-chil dren-cuts-allen-mayfield-from-cast.html\n\nSOD also reported \"Jordi Vilasuso (ex-Tony, GL) and Lindsay Hartley (ex-Theresa, PASSIONS), whose stint as DAYS's Arianna will come to an end this October, have been signed to contract roles on AMC. Vilasuso will play Griffin Castillo; Hartley's character is named Cara Finn. Both characters will be connected to Jake and Amanda's storyline. Vilasuso will debut on November 15; Hartley on December 8. \"\n\nLesli Kay, who finished her stint as Molly on ATWT with no surprise is returning to the Bold & the Beautiful as Felicia Forrester in October\n\nThe search is on for a new Joey for One Life to Live, the show put out a casting call. The last actor to play the role was CASTLE star Nathan Fillion, who popped in for two episodes in 2007 and had previously filled Joey's shoes from 1994-97. When OLTL was looking to recast the role last year, Daniel Cosgrove was up for the part, but reportedly turned it down. Joey was once paired in a popular romance with Gina Tognoni's Kelly.\n\nAnd the big news this week was As the World Turns signed off the air after 54 years! What happened to citizens of Oakdale? You can watch it on youtube here.\n\nPart 2 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-BeuyCk5UQ&feature=related\n\nPart 3 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTQWeYAYles&feature=related"
