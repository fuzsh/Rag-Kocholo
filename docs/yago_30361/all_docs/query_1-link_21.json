        "text": "Brittany Allen is a Canadian actress, songwriter and composer. She shot to fame as a series regular on the long-running US soap opera All My Children, playing the role of Marissa Tasker from 2009-10. She received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress.\n\nShe has had a long career on North American television and film, acting on shows such as Bomb Girls, Lost Girl and Schittâ€™s Creek. Expanding into film, she has taken lead roles in prominent Canadian thrillers and horror, in films such as Extraterrestrial, It Stains the Sand red, and What Keeps You Alive. The films were directed by her husband Colin Minihan, and in the latter two she acted as executive producer.\n\nHer passion for all the different aspects of filmmaking is also exemplified in her career as a composer. She attended a public high school with a keen focus on the arts, and then attended the Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning to study Music Performance. She composed the score of What Keeps You Alive, her introduction into this aspect of filmmaking. Most recently, she composed the score of the film Z (also directed by Minihan), the soundtrack of which is available on Spotify.\n\nMost recently she has continued to act, in the horror film The Prodigy as well as the Amazon Prime show The Boys, which is subversive take on the superhero genre."
