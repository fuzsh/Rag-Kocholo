        "text": "Albert Benjamin \"Ben\" Chandler Jr., a skilled newspaperman, the father of former U.S. Rep. Ben Chandler, and the son of the late Kentucky Gov. and Major League Baseball Commissioner A.B. \"Happy\" Chandler, died Saturday at the age of 87.\n\nChandler Jr. was born on Aug. 8, 1929 and spent part of his childhood in the governor’s mansion and went on to graduate from the Darlington School in Rome, Ga., and the University of Kentucky. He was a U.S. Air Force veteran of the Korean War era.\n\nFor many years he owned and published The Woodford Sun, which his father bought in the early 1940s. He was the last living offspring of the former Kentucky governor.\n\nHe was selected for induction into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nAccording to his Hall of Fame information, Chandler, who took over as publisher of the Woodford paper in 1957, was one of the longest-tenured publishers in Kentucky history.\n\nOne nominator wrote that \"his sustained contributions are rare.”\n\nThe Hall of Fame said that his “Happy Landings” column \"showed his editorial leadership through the weekly newspaper’s reliable, well-edited and comprehensive news pages. He has included aggressive coverage of planning, zoning and development issues, a major focus of public concern in Woodford County during most of his tenure.\n\n\"Ben’s paper publishes more public records than most in Kentucky and reaches a high percentage of households in the county. The paper, owned since 1940 by the family of A.B. “Happy” Chandler, then U.S. senator, who names his son – a Korean War veteran and University of Kentucky graduate – publisher during second term as governor.\"\n\nAnother nominator called Ben Chandler “a true institution in the community.”\n\nChandler’s son Whitney Chandler has served as publisher of the paper since 2014.\n\nChandler was a member of St. John’s Episcopal Church in Versailles, and he was a resident of Versailles at the time of his death.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Lucie Chandler, and sons Albert Benjamin “Ben” Chandler III and his wife, Jennifer; Whitney Chandler and his wife Shaoqian Chandler; and Matthew Chandler, all of Versailles, along with four grandchildren.\n\nVisitation will be from 5 to 7 p.m., Tuesday, Oct. 25, at the Pisgah Presbyterian Church Academy Building in Versailles. Graveside services will be at 1 p.m., Wednesday at Pisgah Cemetery. A reception will follow services.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations are suggested to a charity of one's choice.\n\nInformation for this story was provided by the Lexington Herald-Leader."
