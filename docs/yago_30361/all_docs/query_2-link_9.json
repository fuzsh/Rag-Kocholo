        "text": "The sexed-up version of All My Children made its online debut this week and it answered the question longtime fans have been waiting almost a year and a half to know: Who did JR shoot? Read our recap to get all the dramatic details:\n\n5 things to expect from the new All My Children\n\nIn the five years since JR descended upon the Chandler party, many Pine Valley residents have struggled to move on. Brooke is still tormented by nightmares, for which her (now hot) teenage son has no sympathy. AJ is too focused on his best friend Miranda, who in turn is infatuated with high school bad boy Hunter. When Hunter eventually asks Miranda out, her over-the-top excitement - and sexy outfit - push AJ over the edge, causing a minor rift between the longtime besties. Miranda's happiness is soon extinguished when she discovers that Hunter only wanted a threesome because he thought she would be a \"freak\" like her mother. Overflowing with testosterone, AJ punches Hunter right in that pretty face of his. (Get it, boy!)\n\nMeanwhile, Opal is bursting with joy at the thought of her dear Petey coming home again. He thinks it's just for a brief visit, but if she has her way, he'll never leave her side again. As a way to make him stay, Opal begs Pete to revive his father's company Cortlandt Electronics, something he only agrees to once he meets the stunning Celia. (What better reason to stick around than a pretty girl?) Of course, Celia has her own issues to deal with.\n\nThough she's 18, Celia's life is dominated by a controlling (and conservative) mystery guardian. After a brief rebellion, Celia agrees to try and live by his rules - until he forbids her from volunteering for Brooke at the Miranda Clinic. Even though it means getting financially cut off, Celia throws caution to the wind and ignores his demand. Maybe her new, rich suitor Pete will be able to help her out a little?\n\nWhile the younger Pine Valley residents are overwhelmed by lust and puppy love, the older residents have more serious issues to fret over. Jesse had planned the ultimate surprise for Angie: a visit from their daughter Cassandra. Worried when Cassandra doesn't show up or answer her phone, Jesse secretly investigates and discovers that she's been kidnapped by the Russian mob, which wants to get a piece of Zack's casinos. Afraid of upsetting Angie, Jesse refuses to let his wife in on their daughter's perilous situation.\n\nOne Life to Live: Answers to 8 burning questions about the online reboot\n\nJesse isn't the only one to get an unpleasant surprise. At the hospital, Cara is shocked to see that David is out of jail (all thanks to Angie, who spoke at his parole hearing). In the past five years, Cara never visited David and only wrote one letter, telling him that she lost their child. But things might not be so simple. Cara's hiding a big secret from David that he's set on finding out. Could their child be alive?\n\nBut before he can get the answer, David has something else to take care of: JR! The man who wreaked havoc at the Chandler party is now in a coma. David considers pulling the plug, but decides that a coma is more of a punishment. That all changes when David notices JR's fingers twitching and immediately reaches for this throat. While many Pine Valley residents would decry David's attempted murder, we're sure there's one who wouldn't mind JR dying: Bianca Montgomery. It turns out, as JR and David struggled with the gun five years ago, the stray bullet struck her partner Marissa Tasker and killed her.\n\nTeasers/Burning Questions for Next Week\n\nJR wields power over Cara's future, while David attempts to get back into medicine. Things heat up between Celia and Pete when they go on an adventure together. Meanwhile, Opal receives a surprise visitor and AJ gets a present that may change everything.\n\nNow that we're a full week in, what do you think of the revamped All My Children?
