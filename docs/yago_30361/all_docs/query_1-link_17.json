        "text": "\"A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.\" Today is my first day back LIS: The London Interdisciplinary School for my final year as an undergraduate student. I remember my first step through the doors of LIS in 2021. I was not sure what to expect and where the journey would lead me, but I was curious and hopeful that this was the place for me. One of the great things about milestones is that it gives you a point to reflect on distance travelled. Distance travelled is personal and shouldn't be compared to anyone else's journey, because we've all had different starting points. For example, I left sixth form with grades C, E and U. I was embarrassed, but also, at that time in my life, academic grades were the least of my concerns. The journey of being a mature student has been difficult, but I've enjoyed the discomfort (at times), and during the times it has been less enjoyable, I've had people who care enough to support me through it. If I were asked to give advice to students starting their first single step at LIS today, it would be: 👉🏾 Learn to ask for help early and often. 👉🏾 Keep your eyes on the path you are on. 👉🏾 The journey will go quickly; enjoy it as much as you can. P.S. I had the best summer - if anyone notices something different about me in this picture, I'll share more about what happened in my summer this week 😁"
