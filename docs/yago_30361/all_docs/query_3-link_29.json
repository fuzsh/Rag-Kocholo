        "text": "Joseph Chandler Kinsey, Jr. (Chandler), born May 20, 1933, died peacefully on December 29, 2021 at Azalealand Nursing Home.\n\nChandler was born in Savannah, GA, the only son of Joseph Chandler and Gladys Nelson Kinsey. His father was sent to Brazil with Anderson Clayton Co. While they lived there, Chandler had the honor of meeting Amelia Earhart when she had dinner at his home. They returned to Columbus, MS where he grew up, until entering high school at Druid Hills High in Atlanta, GA. Upon graduation in 1951, he went to Clemson College, graduating with a BS degree in 1955, and then entered the Air Force. He became a pilot and served until 1958.\n\nIn June of 1958, Chandler married the former Rebekah (Becky) Duncan of Anderson, SC. They have three children. He retired to Tybee Island GA in 1997 after a long career in the iron and steel business in Atlanta. He joined Trinity Chapel UMC and became very active in many areas of the church especially active in the choir and the Staff Parish Committee. He and Becky also became active in the duplicate Bridge Club at WIC. They both loved playing Bridge with friends.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Becky, Chandler leaves behind his daughter, Cathy (Paul) Crafton of Kennesaw, Ga; his son, Chandler III of Savannah, Ga; and his son, David (Clare) of Savannah, Ga. A treasure in his life was his grandchildren: Laura Crafton, Matthew (Audrey) Crafton, Mark (Katie) Crafton, and Joseph Kinsey. Teaching them to play tennis was a real joy. He and all of them built great sand castles!!\n\nA memorial service will be held at Trinity Chapel United Methodist Church on Tybee Island on Friday, January 7, 2022, at 3:00 p.m.. A private memorial graveside will be held at Greenwich Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family suggests that you consider a donation to Trinity Chapel UMC in Chandler's memory."
