        "text": "David “Denny” Chandler Jr., 47, of Louisville, Kentucky passed away on February 5, 2024 at Norton Hospital. He was born on June 16, 1976 in Louisville, Kentucky son of David Chandler Sr. and the late Laura Chandler. Denny was a truck driver with a zest for life that extended beyond the open road. He had a love for motorcycles which added an exhilarating chapter to his adventures, as the wind in his hair mirrored the freedom he found on two wheels.\n\nBeaches held a special place in his heart, where the waves and shores became cherished moments and at the center of his joyous escapades was his loving wife Sherri, who was his constant companion in their journey through life’s twists and turns. They shared together memories of laughter, dreams and wonderful adventures. Denny loved to agitate his family and make them laugh.\n\nDenny is survived by his loving wife, Sherri Chandler; children, Janae Chandler, Trevin Chandler, Brandenn Finch, Jocelyne Finch; sister, Angel Brooks(Terry); brother, Jimmy Chandler; father, David Chandler Sr.; along with 3 grandchildren, Carleeno, Elijah, Cassandra.\n\nCremation was chosen and entrusted with Legacy Funeral Center, 921 Main Street, Jeffersonville, Indiana 47130. There will be a Celebration of Life held on Tuesday, February 20, 2024 from 5-7pm with service to follow at Southeast Christian Church, Chapel in the Woods located at 1407 Moser Road, Louisville, Kentucky 40299.\n\nPlease consider making a donation to family by clicking on Donation up at top of page."
