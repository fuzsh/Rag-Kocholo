        "text": "SOMERSWORTH — The Tasker family has come to the Somersworth Children's International Festival for 15 years, starting before the Berwick couple had children of their own to enjoy the experience.\n\nThe family of five now were among the thousands who packed Somersworth's Main Street Saturday, testament that the event is still going strong after 27 years. Estimates varied on the number of people attending, but most agreed the total was somewhere in the thousands.\n\nThe two-day event kicked off with fireworks Friday night, but really began in earnest Saturday morning as throngs of baby carriages, tots and teens flocked downtown. Visitors to the Hilltop City's biggest festival shopped, ate french fries and enjoyed the sights and sounds.\n\nFestival organizer Sue Gregoire pegged the number of visitors throughout the day at over 25,000, noting there were more people at the festival than in previous years.\n\n\"Good; really good,\" Gregoire said, about how everything went.\n\nGregoire said was pleased that this year all of the vendor slots were full and the festival included a lot more nonprofit groups.\n\n\"We do it every year,\" said Marissa Tasker, sitting beneath some shade by the city's library.\n\nThe family spent the afternoon enjoying the festival with their three sons in tow.\n\nDylan, 9, Nash, 6, and Ian, 3 had a great time, but for different reasons.\n\nFor Dylan it was the magic; Nash loved the vanilla ice cream cookie; Ian liked the animals at Noble Pines Park, especially the goat.\n\nThe three had plenty to choose from.\n\nIt was a celebration of all things children love.\n\nThe festival offered four stages making for a near-continuous mix of multicultural and children's entertainment; exotic and traditional foods; an enormous selection of crafts and activities; a petting zoo, pony rides and excitement for all ages with over 250 activities and vendors.\n\n\"It's been fun,\" said Micheal Menas, of Somersworth. \"We've done everything.\"\n\nMenas and his two children, Billy and Maria, made their way up and down Main Street.\n\n\"I liked everything,\" 6-year-old Maria said.\n\nVisitors also had a chance to tour a multicultural area.\n\nGroups from Brazil, Poland, Armenia, Thailand, Belize and others demonstrated aspects of their heritage and offered native foods.\n\nAs children walked around, stamps from each country in the multicultural area were applied to \"passports.\" If a child had all the stamps, they received a prize and were entered into a drawing for a bike donated by Tony's Cyclery in Dover.\n\nThe festival was also a hit with many of the vendors that lined Main Street.\n\nEileen Lawrence-Ellis sold plants from her Epping farm.\n\nShe sold quite a few, with air plants being the top sellers.\n\n\"It's great,\" Lawrence-Ellis said. \"Lots of really nice people.\""
