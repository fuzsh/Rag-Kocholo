Lotte Reiniger (1899 â€“ 1981) was a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best-known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed from 1926 - thought to be one of the oldest surviving feature-length animated films - and Papagenofrom 1935.

In devising a forerunner of the multiplane camera for certain effects, she anticipated Ub Iwerks and Walt Disney by a decade. She made more than 40 films, all using her invention.
