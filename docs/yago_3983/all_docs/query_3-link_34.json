        "text": "Introducing Lotte Reiniger\n\nCharlotte ‚ÄúLotte‚Äù Reiniger (2 June 1899 ‚Äì 19 June 1981) was a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation, anticipating Walt Disney by over ten years. Reiniger made over 40 films over her career, all using her invention. Her most well known film is The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926).\n\n. What animation has Lotte inspired us by?\n\nSiholouette animation is a a type of stop motion animation. Stop motion animation is a technique that uses still objects. In Lotte‚Äôs case she uses imaginative static siholouettes.\n\nIn my research I gathered silhouette animation is very much inspired by European shadow play. This is using not the puppets as the feature. Instead using the shadow from the puppets. This was used as a form of entertainment internationally throughout the 1900‚Äôs. To this day we use the technique Lotte invented to make different stop motion animations. Although there are different stop motion animation. Silhouette, cut out and claymation being great examples of the range. I find that Lotte did not know of different animators or there adaptation of stop motion animation.\n\nI found out that Lotte Reiniger first established many standard silhouette animation rules. She inspired and sparked several animators.\n\nThe importance of her in animation is significant. Squences of digital and drawn siholouette animations are used today; Southpark is a prime example of this. When the lights are turned off in scenes they use silhouette stop motion technique.\n\nTechniques our Siholouette Animator uses\n\nAs simple as Lotte Reingers technique may seem, my research showed my the extravagance of her animations. I am going to break down Lotte‚Äôs technique to demonstrate I have gained an understanding and hopefully I can teach you something new to! I mainly used https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LvU55CUw5Ck&feature=youtu.be Which is a documentary featuring Lotte herself in her house in Germany.\n\nThis is an actual photograph taken of Lotte in action. She says;\n\n‚Äò First of all select an idea that you like very much, the work takes a very long time‚Äô\n\nIn my opinion it is important you have passion behind any stop motion animation you make, it can be time consuming. You must know what story you wish to complete with structure. Otherwise you may get confused along the way.\n\nLotte‚Äôs technique in order‚Ä¶\n\nüî∑Storyline and characters.üí≠ Below is Lotte holding a peice of paper with a character named ‚ÄòPapagedo‚Äô. She obtained Papagedo from the famous Mozart.üé≠\n\nWhen selecting characters take time. She makes sure they are fairy like, magical and unique, still demonstrating human features. You can see above Papagedo has human hands legs and arms, but has feathers around his lower body and head.\n\nI think this is a prime example of the characters and catagoery Lotte most enjoyed working on. He is a birdman. Initially half bird, half man. She has based her work on fairytale and I believe this essence is displayed within her work.\n\nPapagedo is the first character that will be used within her animation. Part of Lotte‚Äôs technique is keeping order. You must do the characters 1 by 1 to avoid complications.\n\nüî∑ 2. Design verious sets and charactersüé®‚úèÔ∏è\n\nNow Lotte would design different characters and sets. This step is important because Lotte thinks the setting completes the whole image and overall magical essence. When watching ‚ÄúD√§umelinchen‚Äù completed mid career. I really found it displayed how the setting brings together the whole magical animation.\n\nThe flower child is rising from the flower that is part of the larger set. Different siholouette flowers, you can see surround the whole set and finish the un-naturalistic yet flowful essence Lotte successfully demonstrates.\n\nüî∑ 3. The blueprint-Storyboard ‚è≥üé¨\n\nI think this is a significant part of Lotte‚Äôs technique. The magic of the story is extremely important. The way in which anyone wishes to complete an animation in the style of Lotte should listen to this tip;\n\nThe quality and interpretation is regardless if there is no story behind the unique characters.\n\nTherefore Lotte Reinger uses a storyboard to make sure her animation is planned out well.\n\nI think she influenced many animators and still does. This is a simple storyboard but is proven successful in every production its used in.\n\nAs you can see she plans out her animation by drawing frames. Underneath these frames are captions she can refer to which explain what‚Äôs happening in the frame. The silhouettes are sketched out on to peice of paper.\n\nI made this diagram to simplify the steps of creating the siholouettes. This is Lotte Reinger herself- I learnt from the best and so did 100‚Äôs of stop motion animators.\n\n‚òëÔ∏èCut you‚Äôre character, figure, flower, or which ever static image you wish to create an animation with. In to individual pieces. Papagedo has his parts cut up into individual pieces as you can see. Label these pieces so you can keep order. Each piece has tiny holes, which I have circled to show clearly. The number of pieces depends on how advanced your character is. The more effective you want your character to be- unfortunately there are more pieces, ultimately proving you must fiddle around more. This will all prove worthwhile when people see you‚Äôre final result.\n\n‚òëÔ∏èJoin these individual pieces with small hidges. You can use blutac, pins or anything to keep the pieces connected without jepridising the whole character. This gives the ability to move each part individually and intricately.\n\n‚òëÔ∏èThis is Lotte hammering the pins into the tiny holes.\n\n‚òëÔ∏èThe final step-Flatten the character on to a piece of led using a roller. This makes sure that the figure is flat, it also ensures the siholouette is a lot more sercure. Led for Lotte also meant that the paper would be a better quality, deteriorate less.\n\nüí°Lotte Reiniger understood her silhouettes are going to be hot because of the lighting. This is where she needed something more substantial that wouldn‚Äôt be affected by heat- Led made sense to her and was easy to access. Pioneers to this day use led in there where work. Another way Lottes small ideas have made big impacts.\n\nüî∑4.Silhouette in actionüí°üë•\n\nI think of this as the science behind Lotte Reiniger‚Äôs technique. This is how I perceived her technique;\n\n‚è≥‚Äî-Firstly Lotte places the siholuette/s on to her set. As you can see abound this is Papagedo. The video States it must be in the correct position, attention to detail is important.\n\nAlthough not very clear images,these are just two come the Camera Lotte has used in production\n\nThe multiplane camera is a special motion picture camera used in the traditional animation process that moves a number of pieces of artwork past the camera at various speeds and at various distances from one another.\n\nThe second picture is a wind-up camera in 1950s Lotte used. Using any type of stop motion camera you wish.\n\nI discovered a really good site. Choosing a camera for stop motion animation . This wil lead you to A site that can direct you on what camera to use when following the technique of Lotte‚Äôs. Many animators use different cameras to achieve different things.\n\n‚åõÔ∏è‚Äî‚ÄìSecondlyüé•üé•\n\nTake a shot with the camera. Double check the siholouette is in the correct position as mentioned. This is a basic instruction but in my option after doing research; the quality of th sthe hits in the frames are with a doubt the most important thing. Each shot will be displaying the story you are animating.\n\n‚åõÔ∏è‚Äî‚ÄìThirdlyüìπ\n\nMove your static silhouette into another position. When Lotte Reiniger would carry out her technique she would refer to her storyboard in order to know what place to move her silhouette to. Papagedo is being moved by Lotte.\n\n‚åõÔ∏è‚Äî-The end result üì∫\n\nAs you can see above took a print screen of Papagedo before steps 1-3 and then after. Although I have not completed this, if I continued I would create a stop motion animation.\n\nYou must repeat these steps until you have enough mages for your frames.\n\nMonty Python by Terry Gilliem in 1958. Underneath is Wallace and Grommit in 2007. Cut out animation is th style of Monty Python, whilst Wallace and Grommit is a great example of claymation. Both techniques gave me the ability to gain a deeper understanding of stop motion animation and materials envoled. The infulence that Lotte Reinger had is astounding. You can use her techniques across the animationspectrum.\n\nTips\n\nI found a really good website that give 5 great tips in making a stop motion video. Creating a stopped motion piece is the perfect way to unite your inner photographer and videographer through a trendy and fun medium. Blending the creativity of photography with the motion of video, stopped motion brings hundreds and thousands of images together to tell a sequential story.\n\nI hope if you wish to make a stop motion video these tips help, think of them as the stop motion rules. These tips demonstrate exactly how Lotte would produce her silhouette animation.\n\nThese 5 tips will help you in creating or if you are not so interested in producing I am hoping you now understand in greater detail how important different elements of stop motion is.\n\nUse of soundüéµüéªüé∑üé∂üéºüé§üéßüéµüéºüé≠\n\nSound in animation is in my opinion a factor that must be understood. Sound in my opinion brings the whole animation together. Helping us understand;\n\nThe storyline\n\nEmphasis\n\nAtmosphere\n\nEmotion\n\nConsidering we are looking at Papageno, let me tell you what I learnt. 1935‚Äôs Papageno uses the new technology of synchronized sound to the full. Mozart‚Äôs playful classical music from comedy opera The Magic Flute is brought to life by Reiniger‚Äôs rhythmically animated fantasy interpretation. Long before Disney‚Äôs Fantasia. Lotte was, a fan of the hyperreal arts of shadow theater and opera, showed that animation could be used to popularize supposedly elite art forms like opera.\n\nLotte would use different sounds but mainly synchronised and classical.\n\nEquipment NeededüìÄüì°üí°üî¶üî®üìã‚úíÔ∏è\n\n*Camera‚Äì You can use any camera as earlier mentioned. I have added a link to what is best to invest in.\n\n* Animation/ pike table‚Äì This is a table with a fraction of it being glass, this is where to light shites through to create the shadow.\n\nLotte Reiniger said;\n\n‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have anything like a pike table at home, you take a dining table and cut a hole in it‚Äù.\n\nüî¶üî¶üî¶üî¶üí°üí°üí°üí°üî¶üî¶üî¶üî¶üî¶üî¶\n\n*The glass plate‚Äì where the light shines through.\n\n*A light- to shine from underneath.\n\n*Transparent paper‚Äì also known as tracing paper.\n\nLotte continues to say;\n\n‚ÄúOnce a hole is cut in the table, put a glass plate over it. Put transparent paper on top of this. And then you put some light on form underneath‚Äù.\n\nI found it interesting how Lotte manages to make it sound so easy. This told me that once you get used to you‚Äôre own technique it does become increasingly easy.\n\n*Rostrum stand- to keep the camera in place which is placed above the silhouette and set.\n\n*Studio- Where you have your equipment.\n\nIn today‚Äôs world‚Ä¶\n\nThere are of course many programmes and softwares available to complete a stop motion animation. Although I feel it is beneficial to know how to make the animation as Lotte Reinger her self would.\n\nMaterials being used üî®üì∞‚úÇÔ∏èüìêüìö\n\nTo create the silhouette figures,Lotte used one main material and did so from 1917 throughout her long career. This is black cardboard.\n\nThe importance of the cardboard is essential. The cardboard brings to life the figures and make sharp, consistent and bold characters.\n\nScissors are also maybe now an obvious material to have within the production of animation. This was key and Lottenew just how much the edges of what she was cutting was accurate.\n\nSemitransparent tissue paper was needed to create the setting/scenery. The backgrounds are to be two dimensional and rather large. The scenery would change never the position of the camera.\n\nUse of colour üî≤‚óæÔ∏è‚óºÔ∏è‚ñ™Ô∏è\n\nSilhouette films are traditionally monochrome. This means the foreground solid black and the background is lots of different shades of grey.\n\nThe more distant an elements in intended to be, the paler the shade of grey, thus creating an illusion of depth.\n\nIn Die Geschichte des Prinzen Achmed, different scenes were tinted in different all-over colours, as was the standard practice among features of the time.\n\nDas Geheimnis der Marquisin (The Marquise‚Äôs Secret, 1922) is a reversed, white-on-black silhouette film.\n\nJack and the Beanstalk (1955), which Lotte Reiniger was forced to shoot in colour. She uses full-colour painted backgrounds with the black silhouettes. Though she seems to have made the most of this expanded format, she went back to making many monochrome animations.\n\nLater on filmmakers, realised the main method of shooting silhouette films in colour has been to imitate the tinted look of Prinzen Achmed by using backgrounds with many different tones of one colour, or sometimes two close or complementary colours. Full-colour cutout animation in which the characters are mainly seen in profile is sometimes described as colour silhouette film.\n\nQuoteüì∞\n\nWhen analysing this quote I think this can help anyone understand Lotter Reinigers mentality. She believes in the truth of fairy -tales more then in newspapers. This underlines her passion for fairy-tales. It shows us she believes in the messages behind fairy-tales rather than behind newspapers. For years animators have aspired to this and I think she‚Äôs allowed fairy-tales to have a significant place in to stop motion world.\n\nI love this briefly, enlightening us a little of the fairy-tale Cinderella and explaining how we will see this story with Lotte‚Äôs special technique. I found out she was famous for having her scissors in her right hand and cardboard in her left.\n\nWhere might you see Lotte Reingers animation?üëÄ\n\nThe institute of cultural research was the first place in which Lotte‚Äôs work was shown; In 1918. Though in my studies it is obvious in today‚Äôs age you can see her work and animations displayed anywhere, from museums, to personal blogs.\n\nBy 1926 Lotte was making many adverts. Not long after making feature length animated films for Turner Classic Movies.\n\nContinually making films that brodcast internationally. Lotte‚Äôs films in my opinion got more and more known. The audience is a wide range of people. Starting with children to viewing her fairy-takes and adult pincers watching her techniques of stop motion."
