        "text": "Haxan is a 1922 documentary directed by Benjamin Christensen that explores and depicts the history of witchcraft and witch hunts in the middle ages.\n\nUsing various devices such as stills of medieval woodcuts and manuscripts, dramatisations of actual events, recreations of recollections, stop motion animations, and some pretty lurid sex and nudity (by 1920s standards, at least), Haxan isn’t so much a documentary as a near two hour nightmare, surprisingly unsettling in many ways, not least the wholly demented behaviour of the witch-hunting clerics and monks.\n\nThis was banned on release across a lot of Europe, and in America too, just as much for it having the temerity to portray the church as absurdly evil as for its nudity and naughtiness (there’s a wonderful scene of the witches all giving Satan a surprisingly chaste kiss on the arse).\n\nEven a hundred years later there’s still a strange, mesmerising power to its imagery, the ferocity of the performances and the sheer strange delight in some of the black mass scenes that’s kind of unsettling, a weird energy that’s impossible to ignore.\n\nThe final section, where it contrasts witch hunt mania to 20th century psychiatric diagnoses of female hysteria, feels startlingly modern, too, after all that’s gone before, and ends the film on a fittingly upsetting note.\n\n___________\n\nNotes\n\n1. I watched this on an old Tartan Video DVD.\n\n2. Which contained two versions – the original 1922 version, with Danish intertitles (basically this youtube version that I took the screenshots from), and various different soundtracks (included what supposedly was the original score from its premiere), and a 1968 American re-edited version called Witchcraft Through The Ages, with a William Burroughs narration and a wonderfully demented 60s jazz soundtrack.\n\n3. I hadn’t seen that version before and it was wonderful, especially the nice stark black and white look, which I like a lot more than the red tinting on the majority of the 1922 version.\n\n4. And William Burroughs has the best voice. He really does.\n\n5. Anyway I’d seen this a couple of times before.\n\n6. Once was the original version on Film Four a few years back.\n\n7. And the other time was about ten years ago in a pub in Chelmsford, where a textless edit of the film was being projected onto a sheet while a very loud band played a live soundtrack to it very loudly.\n\n8. Which was wonderful obviously\n\n9. I have no idea who the band were I’m afraid.\n\n10. They sounded quite a lot like Earth\n\n11. But they were not Earth.\n\n__________\n\nFilm Information\n\nTitle: Haxan\n\nDirector: Benjamin Christensen\n\nYear: 1922\n\nDuration: 1 hour 46 minutes\n\nWatch: youtube; Mark Kermode BFI Intro\n\nThe Cameraman’s Revenge is a Russian animation from 1912, directed by Ladislas Starevich, in which he uses stop motion animated dead insects to tell a slightly baffling tale of infidelity, voyeurism and revenge, for some reason.\n\nTwo beetles in a loveless marriage run off whenever they can to have affairs, one with an artist (another beetle), the other with a showgirl (a dragonfly), while the projectionist at the local cinema (he’s a grasshopper, I think) uses his camera to film the showgirl’s affair through the keyhole in the hotel door.\n\nThen there’s just about enough time for some fist fights and confrontations and other odd convolutions of plot before we reach the end.\n\nAnyway, and unsurprisingly, I liked this a lot. The animation’s great (although the picture quality is terrible, so obscures a lot of it), there’s some wonderful touches (especially when everyone goes to the cinema and their watching the scenes we’ve already seen projected onto their little cinema screen), and it’s surprisingly prescient in it’s prediction of mobile phone and hidden camera voyeurism, although the idea that the local cinema would be where you showed all this rather than on the grottier corners of the internet is quite wide of the mark.\n\n_________\n\nNotes\n\n1. I watched this on youtube.\n\n2. There’s probably other versions available.\n\n3. And hopefully better quality ones somewhere (although I didn’t find any).\n\n4. This is one of the problems of watching old films on the internet, all the general degradations of film over time combined with video conversion fuzziness and youtube compression artefacts until everything’s a complete visual mess.\n\n5. Which is a shame, because I expect this looked incredible at the time.\n\n_________\n\nFilm Information\n\nTitle: The Cameraman’s Revenge\n\nDirector: Ladislas Starevich\n\nYear: 1912\n\nDuration: 13 minutes\n\nWatch: youtube\n\nCinderella (or Aschenputtel) is a short film from 1922, directed and animated by Lotte Reiniger in her signature paper cut outs and shadow silhouette style. It’s beautiful.\n\nAn adaptation of the traditional Cinderella story (unsurprisingly, given the title), this includes almost everything you could want from such a thing: evil mothers, grotesque sisters, wonderful transformations, beautiful costumes, dancing, surprisingly horrific mutilations, and even an exploding step-mother.\n\n(Also there’s a nice example of the perils of outdated old language usage changing the entire meaning of the piece, when poor old Cinderella isn’t allowed to the party because she’s a “slut”.)\n\nLots of early cartoons seem to start with a sequence showing the artist drawing a characters before they magically come alive, and this has a nice variation on that with a pair of magical scissors cutting blank lumps of paper into shape, which I liked a lot. And as ever with Lotte Reiniger’s work is the sheer expressive artistry of it all.\n\nThe Secret Of the Marquise is also from 1922, and it seems to be unique (as far as my inexpert knowledge of Lotte Reiniger’s career can tell) in that it’s been reversed/inverted, so that the cutouts are in white and the backgrounds in black, which gives it all a nice ethereal air. It’s only short (2 minutes or so), but it’s as charmingly animated as ever, and whhen I watched this I was assuming it was another one of Lotte Reiniger’s fairy tale adaptations, so the reveal of what the Marquise’s secret actual was was unexpectedly funny, like some long lost 1920s Reeves and Mortimer sketch.\n\n________\n\nNotes\n\n1. I watched this on various BFI collections (Cinderella is on the Lotte Reiniger Fairy Tales collection DVD, and The Secret Of The Marquise is an extra on The Tales Of Prince Achmed blu-ray).\n\n2. But they’re also on youtube, which is where, as usual, I grabbed the screenshots from. The Secret Of The Marquise is exactly the same as the disc version, while Cinderella has music on youtube, and also maybe a clearer picture).\n\n3. I’ve reviewed a couple of Lotte Reiniger’s other films here before: Der Fliegende Koffer (1921) and Das Ornament des verliebten Herzens (1919).\n\n4. I don’t know why I gave them the German titles and these the English ones but I did so there.\n\n5. Also I liked both of those just as much as I liked these probably.\n\n6. Lotte Reiniger also made a version of Sleeping Beauty in 1922, but I can’t find any versions of it anywhere so is presumably lost. Although it might just be that my cursory Tuesday afternoon searching skills are off.\n\n7. She remade that, and also Cinderella, in the 1950s, but that’s a long way beyond the scope of this website.\n\n8. (But it’s good I liked it).\n\n__________\n\nFilm Information\n\nTitle: Cinderella\n\nDirector: Lotte Reiniger\n\nYear: 1922\n\nDuration: 12 minutes\n\nWatch: youtube\n\nTitle: The Secret Of The Marquise\n\nDirector: Lotte Reiniger\n\nYear: 1922\n\nDuration: 2 minutes\n\nWatch: youtube\n\nThe Haunted Hotel (which was directed by J. Stuart Blackton and released in 1907) and Hôtel Électrique (which was directed by Segundo de Chomón and released in 1908) are two variations on almost exactly the same theme (that theme being haunted hotels, where everything inside moves around in marvellous stop motion ways).\n\nThe Haunted Hotel mixes live action, stop motion (and pixilation) animation, as well as a bunch of other film trickery techniques, to create a series of short scenes where a weary traveller is haunted first by his dinner, then by a napkin, and finally by the entire room itself. It’s wonderful. Especially the end.\n\nThis is one of the oldest surviving stop motion films (some of the same director’s earlier attempts are among the many lost), but it’s not only remarkably technically adept, but pretty funny too (I laughed at least three times in six minutes, which is fairly good going I reckon).\n\nThe Haunted Hotel was so successful in Europe that apparently every film maker in France spent the next year trying to work out all of Blackton’s techniques (according to wikipedia, at least), which is presumably how Segundo de Chomón’s Hôtel Électrique came about.\n\nHôtel Électrique copies the basic template of the first film, but upgrades the setting from some dismal single room to a plush, posh French hotel, at the cutting edge of modernity. No expense is spared in providing the guests with the luxuries deserving of their class. Suitcases are unpacked, shoes are shined, hair is brushed, faces are shaved, all in perfect stop motion.\n\nIn this film, though, it’s not ghosts pestering people, but electric automation. What starts off as smoothly gliding suitcases and carefully swirling razor blades devolves into chaos when the inevitably of technological failure rears its head and everything turns to horror. The only thing to do is escape with your lives.\n\nIt would be another 80 years until Stanley Kubrick remade these two films as The Shining. Never once did he admit his inspiration.\n\n____________\n\nNotes\n\n1. I watched both of these on youtube\n\n2. The Haunted Hotel here\n\n3. And Hotel Electrique here\n\n4. The picture quality on both is disappointingly terrible\n\n5. Which is a shame\n\n6. I don’t know if there’s better quality versions available elsewhere\n\n7. But I assume there must be, because the gif of the woman having her hair brushed in Hotel Electrique on wikipedia looks utterly marvellous\n\n8. Although maybe that’s simply because it’s been squidged down to almost nothing\n\n9. I watched an earlier J. Stuart Blackton cartoon previously on here\n\n10. Although it was so awful I hid it in the comments rather than give it any prominence on the main part of the article.\n\n11. But The Haunted Hotel is so excellent I have forgiven him now\n\n__________\n\nFilm Information\n\nTitle: The Haunted Hotel\n\nDirector: J. Stuart Blackton\n\nYear: 1907\n\nDuration: 7 minutes\n\nWatch: youtube\n\nTitle: Hôtel Électrique\n\nDirector: Segundo de Chomón\n\nYear: 1908\n\nDuration: 10 minutes\n\nWatch: youtube\n\nThe Acrobatic Fly and Birth Of A Flower are two films released in 1910 by the brilliant nature film and stop-motion pioneer F. Percy Smith (whose incredible To Demonstrate How Spiders Fly I watched and reviewed previously).\n\nThe Acrobatic Fly was a part of an ongoing series of similarly themed short films, in which F. Percy Smith decided to use stop motion to make it look like insects were engaged in a series of pointless acrobatic displays.\n\nI’m not entirely sure why, but I found this fairly disconcerting (presumably because of the use of real flies nailed to a pole).\n\nI much preferred Birth Of A Flower. This film is a series of time lapse sequences, showing flowers opening up their petals into full bloom, and it’s really quite beautiful. Of course, watching it now, these sequences aren’t anything we haven’t seen before (although they’re still beautiful staged), but I expect a hundred and ten years ago footage like this would have been a pretty wonderful novelty.\n\nAlthough maybe not as much of a commercial success as flies carrying dumbbells.\n\n__________\n\nNotes\n\n1. I watched these both on youtube – The Acrobatic Fly here, and Birth Of A Flower here\n\n2. That version of Birth Of A Flower is only an extract, but it’s been soundtracked by some Erik Satie music, so I preferred that version to the full version\n\n3. Which can be viewed here\n\n4. But which unfortunately has a fairly ugly watermark ruining it, unfortunately.\n\n5. If you’d like to know more about F. Percy Smith, this Atlas Obscura article is pretty wonderful\n\n6. And well worth your time.\n\n7. This BFI article about Birth of A Flower is also interesting (but a lot shorter).\n\n__________\n\nFilm Information\n\nTitle: The Acrobatic Fly\n\nDirector: F.

Percy Smith\n\nYear: 1910\n\nDuration: 7 minutes\n\nWatch: youtube (extract only); youtube (full version)\n\nTo Demonstrate How Spiders Fly is a very short educational film (it’s only a minute long), made using stop-motion animation to explain how spiders travel across unexpectedly large distances. It was directed by F. Percy Smith, a naturalist and photographer who helped pioneer the use of many now-familiar film-making techniques, such as time-lapse sequences.\n\nI love spiders and I love stop-motion creatures and I utterly love this. What a wonderful thing.\n\nAnd a hundred and ten years old.\n\n__________\n\nNotes\n\n1. I watched this, yes, via the BFI Player – To Demonstrate How Spiders Fly\n\n2. I think this may be my favourite thing\n\n3. I just wish I’d seen it earlier so I could have incorporated this knowledge into Spiders Are Wonderful (multiple winner of the factual book of the year award in 2011).\n\n__________\n\nFilm Information\n\nTitle: To Demonstrate How Spiders Fly\n\nDirector: F.
