        "text": "91 years after its German premiere, Lotte Reiniger’s enchanting silhouette film still stands as one of the greatest works of animation. Rather than using the prevalent method of painting onto translucent cells, Reiniger created models out of cardboard and lit them from below, creating the illusion of elaborate shadow figures with subtle yet incredibly evocative movement and an amazing expressivity. The first full-length animated film—eleven years before Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs—Prince Achmed was hailed a masterpiece by Jean Renoir. Based on tales from One Thousand and One Nights, the film follows Prince Achmed and his magical flying horse as they soar headlong into a series of wondrous adventures. The recently restored hand-tinted and toned 35mm print will be accompanied by live piano—adding an extra dimension of presence and pleasure to this beautifully rendered tale.\n\nLive Piano Accompaniment by Robert Humphreville"
