At school, she learned about paperschnitte, or papercuts, which helped her create her signature style of silhouettes. She grew up to make more than forty films throughout her long career, most of which were fairytales that used her stop-film animation technique of hand-cut silhouettes. Reiniger is now seen as the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation and the inventor of an early form of the multiplane camera.",
