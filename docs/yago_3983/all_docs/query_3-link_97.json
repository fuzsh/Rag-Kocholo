        "text": "Lotte Reiniger (director, animator)\n\nN.p. N.p., Circa 1950s. Collection of eight vintage photographic prints, produced in the 1950s, each with six illustrations from eight different films directed by noted German animator Lotte Reiniger. The films represented include \"Sleeping Beauty\" (1922), \"Cinderella\" (1922), \"The Magic Horse\" (1953), \"Thumbelina\" (1954), \"The Three Wishes\" (1954), \"Caliph Stork\" (1954), \"The Gallant Little Tailor\" (1954), \"The Frog Prince\" (1954), and \"Hansel and Gretel\" (1955).\n\nReiniger was a pioneer of scherenschnitte, the German art of silhouette, heavily inspired by the ancient Chinese art of paper cutting and silhouette puppetry. She worked on over 40 films throughout her career, the most notable, \"The Adventures of Prince Achmed\" (1926), being the oldest surviving feature-length animated film.\n\nEight photographic prints, each 6.5 x 8.5 inches (16.5 x 21.5 cm). All Near Fine, two with numeric annotations in manuscript ink on the recto and one with a diagonal dampstain affecting the left edge.\n\n[Book #160657]"
