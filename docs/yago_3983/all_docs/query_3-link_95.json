        "text": "THURSDAY II: Myths, Legends, and Folk Tales: A Brief History of Animation\n\nProgrammed by Solana Adedokun\n\nEmerging in the late 19th and early 20th century, live-action and animated films share an intertwined history of development and growth that have transformed the world’s entertainment industry forever. Despite animation’s groundbreaking power, it is often underappreciated and relegated as a medium solely for children’s entertainment. This series exists not only to break that harsh stigma, but to cultivate the audience’s appreciation and interest in this challenging, unforgiving, yet utterly rewarding medium.\n\nEach fantasy-adventure film that will be shown epitomizes the very best of animation in its respective time period, demonstrating not only the strength of animation as a serious storytelling method, but also as an artform unto itself. Whether it's the method of animation the filmmakers choose when bringing a story to life, or the way each technique lends a kind of character to the film that live-action cannot, audience members are sure to find something special in each movie.\n\n9:30PM Thursday, September 29th\n\nThe Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926)\n\nLotte Reiniger · 65m · 35mm\n\nConsidered by many to be the oldest surviving animated film in the world, The Adventures of Prince Achmed is a masterful work of cutout, silhouette animation by German director Lotte Reiniger. Drawing from Hanna Diyab's contributions to the \"Arabian Nights,\" the film focuses on the many adventures of its titular character, who embarks on a demon-slaying, princess-wooing escapade after a wicked sorcerer tricks him into riding a magical, flying horse.\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n10:00PM Thursday, October 6th\n\nBelladonna of Sadness (1973)\n\nEiichi Yamamoto · 86m · DCP\n\nAn extremely violent, graphic, and disturbing cult film that has recently gained in popularity, Belladonna of Sadness is a 1973 Japanese film by Eiichi Yamamoto. It follows Jeanne, a French peasant woman who is raped on her wedding night. In a series of Faustian pacts with a phallic devil, Jeanne simultaneously grows in power amongst the villagers and brings misery to those around her, all shown in psychedelically beautiful watercolor.\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n9:30PM Thursday, October 13th\n\nSon of the White Mare (1981)\n\nMarcell Jankovics · 90m · DCP\n\nDirected by famous Hungarian director Marcell Jankovics, Son of the White Mare is based on Hungarian narrative poetry and legends. The main story follows Fehérlófia, meaning \"Son of the White Mare,\" who is the youngest son of a magical horse. As he grows older and gains powers from his mother, he listens to her ancient tales of dragons prophesied to destroy his world. With the help of his brothers, Fehérlófia sets out to slay the dragons.\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n10:00PM Thursday, October 20th\n\nThe Thief and the Cobbler: A Moment in Time (1992)\n\nRichard Williams · 89m · DCP\n\nDirected by Richard Williams, The Thief and the Cobbler is infamous for its nearly thirty year production cycle that left it incomplete. While grossly over budget and meeting critical and commercial failure upon release, the film would later become revered by critics and fans. Doc is proud to present the A Moment in Time Academy restoration, the closest to Williams' intended 1992 version, saved before the studios radically altered it for release.\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n9:30PM Thursday, October 27th\n\nPersepolis (2007)\n\nMarjane Satrapi & Vincent Paronnaud · 96m · 35mm\n\nBased on the graphic novel of the same name, Persepolis tells French-Iranian cartoonist Marjane Satrapi's life story growing up in revolutionary Iran. After the Shah is deposed, Marji must navigate her interests in counter-culture, education, and boys in the face of the Islamic fundamentalist government. Persepolis is simultaneously a film about coming-of-age, politics, and womanhood, all told through Satrapi's signature graphic novel style.\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n9:30PM Thursday, November 3rd\n\nLa casa lobo (2018)\n\nCristobal León & Joaquín Cociña · 73m · DCP\n\nDirected by Cristobal León and Joaquín Cociña, La casa lobo is a horror stop-motion animated film that follows María, who attempts to find refuge after leaving a religious fanatic cult. Eventually, she finds a home inhabited by two pigs, but the longer María stays in the house, the more unsettling it becomes. Though this film uses fairy-tale-like imagery at times, the film is inspired by the real Colonia Dignidad, a post-WWII German cult in Chile.\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n9:30PM Thursday, November 10th\n\nCoraline (2009)\n\nHenry Selick · 100m · DCP\n\nOne of the most-well known stop-motion animation films of all time, Coraline follows the story of young Coraline Jones who moves to a new town with her parents. Neglected by her parents, she struggles to adjust to her new surroundings until she finds an alternate world that, though perfect, is not all it seems. With the help of a stray black cat, Coraline not only needs to find a way home, but to unravel the mysteries of this other world.\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n9:30PM Thursday, November 17th\n\nThe Night Is Short, Walk on Girl (2017)\n\nMasaaki Yuasa · 93m · DCP\n\nWith an utterly surrealist style of Japanese animation painting an unforgettable drunken night, The Night is Short, Walk on Girl follows two unnamed students at Kyoto University. While the girl is enjoying a night full of parties, drinking contests, and supernatural beings, the guy is determined to find a successful way to ask her out. But will he be able to as he fights back strange characters, exorbitant drinks, and the common cold?\n\nTickets can be bought here.\n\n9:30PM Thursday, December 1st\n\nWolfwalkers (2020)\n\nTomm Moore & Ross Stewart · 103m · DCP\n\nSet in Ireland in 1650, Wolfwalkers follows young Robyn Goodfellowe, who has moved to the town of Kilkenny with her dad at the request of the Lord Protector to kill the last remaining wolf pack.

While forging new friendships, Robyn has to decide whether to remain a hunter, or to help Mebh’s wolfpack.\n\nTickets can be bought here."
