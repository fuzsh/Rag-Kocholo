        "text": "Buy the DVD or Blu-ray\n\nWhen The Adventures of Prince Achmed premiered in Germany on September 23, 1926, it was hailed as the first full-length animated film. More than seventy-five years later, this enchanting film still stands as one of the great classics of animation — beautiful, mesmerizing and utterly seductive.\n\nTaken from The Arabian Nights, the film tells the story of a wicked sorcerer who tricks Prince Achmed into mounting a magical flying horse and sends the rider off on a flight to his death. But the prince foils the magician’s plan and soars headlong into a series of wondrous adventures — joining forces with Aladdin and the Witch of the Fiery Mountains, doing battle with the sorcerer's army of monsters and demons, and falling in love with the beautiful Princess Peri Banu.\n\nThis cinematic treasure has been beautifully restored with its spectacular color tinting and with a new orchestral recording of the magnificent 1926 score by Wolfgang Zeller. Thrilling, sensuous and dazzling, Prince Achmed will enthrall children and film enthusiasts of all ages.\n\nThe DVD collector's edition includes a marvelous 60-minute documentary on pioneer animator Lotte Reiniger and a 1921 commercial, The Secret of the Marquise, she did for a beauty cream company.\n\nThe Blu-ray two-disc edition includes the following short films by Lotte: The Secret of the Marquise, 1921; The Flying Coffer, 1921; Dr. Dolittle: Lion’s Den, 1923 (German and English versions); Dr. Dolittle: A Trip to Africa, 1923.; Dr. Dolittle: Cannibal Land, 1923; The Death-Feigning Chinaman, 1928; The Caliph Stork, 1935; The Magic Horse, 1953; Aladdin and His Magic Lamp, 1954; The Star of Bethlehem, 1956; The Lost Son, 1974.\n\nAlso available in beautiful hand-tinted and toned 35mm prints for theatrical and nontheatrical screenings. Please, contact Milestone for price and availability!\n\nAn Explanation of Home, Classroom, and Public Performance Rights\n\nIndividuals and non-profit institutions purchasing DVDs, DVD-Rs, or Blu-rays — or streaming — at published home-use sale and rental prices are authorized to use the film only for private home screenings and legitimate classroom showings (a regularly scheduled class with an instructor present), per the United States Copyright Law. You can learn more about the distinction between classroom and public performance screenings here.\n\nThrough our distribution partner, Kino Lorber, Milestone provides a variety of licensing to suit all needs. Our standard institutional licensing packages are designed to provide colleges, universities and qualified non-profits with the best value for multiple uses, and our one-time community screening licenses allow any organization to exhibit high-quality films for a reasonable fee. Please note that all licensing carries restrictions on audience numbers and/or geographic range.\n\nSTANDARD INSTITUTIONAL LICENSING\n\nCLASSROOM RIGHTSallow unlimited use in face-to-face classroom situations for the life of the media, restricted to a single campus or location. Please note that this license doesn't include public screenings or digital transmission of any kind.\n\nPUBLIC PERFORMANCE RIGHTS (PPR) allow educational and nonprofit groups to exhibit our films to groups of 100 or fewer individuals where admission is not charged. The term of the public performance license is for the life of the DVD. However, if you intend to charge admission, expect an audience over 100, or publicly advertise the screening, then we ask that you contact us regarding an exhibition fee. Films purchased without Public Performance Rights are restricted for individual viewing or face-to-face teaching in the classroom only.\n\nDIGITAL SITE LICENSES (DSL) allow colleges, universities and nonprofits to locally host and stream to their community on a closed, password-protected system for the life of the digital file.\n\nK-12 PPR comes with limited performance rights so films can be shown in classrooms, at PTA meetings, during after school programs, and transmitted on a closed-circuit system within a K-12 school building or on a single campus.\n\nFor all educational licenses and screenings, please Estelle Grosso, Director of Educational and Non-Theatrical Sales & Distribution at Kino Lorber (Milestone’s distribution partner) at: egrosso@kinolorber.com.\n\nThe purchase of DVDs, DVD-Rs, and Blu-rays at the institutional rate by anyone outside of a North American non-profit educational institution does not grant rights for public performance or streaming.\n\nAny continuous or loop screenings as part of a museum exhibition must also be licensed separately.
