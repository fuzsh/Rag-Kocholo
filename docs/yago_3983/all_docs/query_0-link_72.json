        "text": "Here it is, the oldest surviving animated film ever made. It is also the third animated feature ever made and the first one from a country other than Argentina. Thankfully Germany is much better at preventing fires than Argentina (the complete works of Quirino Cristiani were lost in various fires). It was a big success almost 100 years ago, but is it still enjoyable after all this time?\n\nIt premiered in 1926, eleven years before Snow White and was directed, written and practically completely animated by Lotte Reiniger. To make this she used silhouette animation, which makes it stick out from modern films, and it is amazing how expressive some of the silhouettes are.\n\nThis is a silent movie with a few narration bubbles telling us some dialogue and sometimes identifying who a character is, and it starts with introducing a few 1001 Nights characters I am unfamiliar with and Aladdin. I can now guess who will save everyone at the end. It is probably for the best that their is no dialogue, as Reiniger made a prequel in 1954 about Aladdin and a few other later works using the same animation style but with dialogue, and most of the dialogue is pretty bad and distracts more than it helps.\n\nIt starts with the villain, “The African Sorcerer” showing off his shapeshifting by lifting his head out of his chest, then he grabs his torso making it longer. He then summons pieces of various animals to make a mechanical/biological flying horse. The animation style and movements are so cool I forget that the bottom is not even animated. At the Caliph’s birthday he shows off the flying horse and steals the flag of the top of the palace showing what he really wants. He refuses gold for it and the Caliph promises by “The Prophet’s Beard” he can can have any treasure he wants, “anything.”\n\nThis results in the Caliph’s daughter, Dinarzade (I am using the subtitle spelling, not Wikipedia’s) watching with interest (more on that later) and Achmed looking with suspicion. The sorcerer demands Dinarzade’s hand in marriage resulting in the Calpih and her looking too frightened to move, but Achmed gets in when he sees his sister fall to her knees in grief. The magician in the disguise of a peace offering or something (it can be a little confusing) lets Achmed on the flying horse. He pushes a lever on the flying horse that makes it fly straight up as to the audience, the caliph, and the sister’s horror, Achmed flies to space. The sorcerer is seized and reveals for the audience’s sake that there is a lever at the butt that makes the horse go down.\n\nThe look of the sorcerer is great, as he is disappointed in himself for not thinking this through, but also annoyed that they think they can hold him. I still do not know the plan, but based on later events I think he just got distracted form his plan of marrying Dinarzade.\n\nThis ends act 1, and this is not what I expected when I watched it. I have watched almost every animated film from the late ’30s to ’40s, and besides Dumbo they are always slow paced. This is very fast paced. The animation makes this stick out so well. The stills do not do it justice, as they move so well, especially the eyes. I should add Reiniger used 24 frames per second. Normally animated movies use 12 double frames, and the only exception I can think of is another movie set in the middle East that was supposed to have no dialogue (I wonder if Richard Williams saw this). Since it is hard to tell the motivations of everyone watching this reminds me of reading Shakespeare. I cannot be sure what the motivations are, and every time I watch it I see something differently.\n\nIn Act II Achmed does what I would do, pull parts of the horse until he goes down. After the sky looks like space he finds the right lever and goes down to the magical islands of Waq Waq. Then the pace really gets slow. He lands on a palace full of women who serve Princess Peri-Banu, and they have a long scene of them making out until Achmed flees on his flying horse and then comes back just to fly right over them. I have no idea if he was flirting just so he could escape later or if he at first enjoyed it. He flees to a lake where he spots his future love interest, Peri-Banu, bathing and watches like a creep. He steals her cloak of feathers, which allows her to fly, kidnaps her, and takes her to China. Our hero.\n\nIn his defense he then gives her back the cloak, promises to be her servant, and she immediately views this more of a rescue, as Waq Waq is controlled by hordes of demons. She agrees to go back to the Calpih with him and marry him presumably due to the act of humility. That or she is just desperate to leave Waq Waq. Meanwhile the sorcerer uses magic to know where his horse is (seeing Achmed and Peri-Banu), shape shifts out of his chains and turns into a bat to fly off.\n\nThe sorcerer turns into a kangaroo monster and steals the cloak, and Achmed chases after him and gets stuck in a pit with a python about to kill him. He strangles the python and uses its corpse as a rope to escape, but by then the sorcerer has kidnapped Peri-Banu and left on the flying horse. Achmed is trapped, and being in China it is probably time for Aladdin to save the day. (He was “Chinese” in the short story).\n\nThe sorcerer sells her as a sex slave to the Emperor of China. He then transforms the money into bird like monsters (Why not turn birds into gold instead), seizes Achmed, and places him on a volcano whole saying he will “…return to your sister.” Very god except the volcano is also the home to his greatest enemy, the witch of the flaming mountain. Still this wizard is better at planning than Dumbledore.\n\nShe was going to kill Achmed until she realized they share an enemy and declare friendship. She gives him weapons designed to counter magic, and they go to rescue Peri-Banu. It goes surprisingly easily until the Demons of Waq Waq arrive and kidnap Peri-Banu for the third time. Achmed pursues but the mountain closes, as it is the gate of Waq Waq and only the magic lamp can open it. How do the demons open it?\n\nHe finds a Snuflepagus/Heffalump attacking a man and saves him who in a flashback scene reveals himself to be Aladdin. He tells the story of Aladdin how the sorcerer tricked him and left him for dead while trying to find the lamp, he found a genie, he used it to gain the favor the Princess (Dinarzide, Achmed’s sister), and the Caliph since Achmed left. Remember the two of them were very impressed by magic earlier. He then lost the lamp resulting in the palace and Dinarzade disappearing. Like in the story he is now declared an outlaw and, he fled. Again this is very fast paced and surprisingly efficient. Even though Aladdin is really wimped down. The witch arrives to form a heroic trio, inform them that The African Sorcerer has the lamp, and that the demons are going to kill Peri-Banu for leaving.\n\nThe Witch and Sorcerer have a duel where they shape shift into animals to battle inspiring the best scene from The Sword in the Stone which results in the Witch killing the main villain and returning the lamp.\n\nThe climax of the movie is great and works to the movie’s strengths, animation. Achmed rescuer Peri-Banu, while Aladdin summons benevolent spirits to help.\n\nThen the demons take the lamp and use it summon their own help. This is the guy who inspired Green Lantern, yet he is a bigger damsel in distress than Peri-Banu.\n\nThe Witch takes it back and uses far more power showing giving it back was a mistake. At least Aladdin can still throw rocks.\n\nThe biggest highlight is when the Witch and Achmed battle the Hydra by using the lamp to burn its neck wounds meaning the heads cannot regrow (Accurate to Greek Mythology). It kidnapped Peri-Banu for the fourth time, as she does not want to be outdone by Aladdin. They defeat the demons and use the lamp to go back home where both couples marry, and the Witch gets to keep the lamp.\n\nThe story is fast paced and detailed, the characters are hard to define, the animation is unique and terrific, the villain is dumb, yet fun to watch, and I loved this odd experience.\n\nFor heroic characters the witch is mixed, as she is a deus ex machina and never feels threatened due to how powerful she is, yet I always enjoyed watching her pummel the villains mercilessly. Achmed (I still do not know how to pronounce his name) and Aladdin have a much better friendship than their Disney counterparts, I enjoy watching them interact, and I can always feel they are in danger. The love interests are very dull.\n\nIt is only 65 minutes long and being public domain it was easy to find online. I have praised it in the past, and I think most animation fans would love giving it a watch.\n\nNext time\n\nAfter several months of rewatches I am finally ready to publish my Disney rankings. They will be up soon."
