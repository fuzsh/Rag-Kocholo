        "text": "Chapter Preview\n\nTop\n\nIntroduction\n\nLotte Reiniger has become a worldwide celebrity with her silhouette films. She is the first woman director who made the first full length silhoutte animation of the world. She is a director of early age of animated cinema and her films represent the aesthetic principles of early age animation. She had examined and applied the Chinese art of silhoutte puppetry techniques. Reiniger was influenced by Melies’s and Paul Wegener’s films and their creative and innovative film aesthetics. She is an important animated cinema figure in the scope of fairy tales from the silent era. All these different features made her one of the leading directors of her era. The political conjuncture of her era inevitably affected her artistic life. The productive and strong relationship with intellectuals and artists of the era have played an important role in building Reiniger’s artistic future.\n\nBefore Lotte Reiniger left Nazi Germany and moved to England in November 1935, had been deeply immersed in the cultural and intellectual avant-garde world of pre-World War II Berlin. Among her circle of friends in 1920’s Berlin were such well-known artists as Walther Ruttmann, who contributed to Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed, and playwright Bertolt Brecht. The earliest films that Reiniger realized with full creative freedom and responsibility were produced by the Institut für Kulturforschung [Institute for Cultural Research] in Berlin. These early films include Das Ornament des Verliebten Herzens/The Ornament of Hearts in Love (1919), Amor und das Standhafte Liebespaar/Love and the Steadfast Lovers (1920), Der Fliegende Koffer/The Flying Suitcase (1921), and Der Stern von Bethlehem/The Star of Bethlehem (1921)1 The films, which have all these different aesthetic principles have brought the artist to an important position in the history of animated film. The masterful craftsmanship which requires a great deal of handmade, united with an orientalist attitude and opened a new door in the Western cinema art. Her friendship with artists from different perspectives broadened the Reiniger’s vision and allowed her to apply the visual arts of different cultures to her animation films. That's why in Reiniger's films a great visual richness stands out. But, because of the political enviroinment created it’s own facts, Reinger draw his ways acoording to this political conditions of her country.\n\n…Carl Koch and Lotte Reiniger were closely identified with leftist politics (Bertolt Brecht counted them among their good friends) and deplored the rise of Nazism. They immediately tried to leave Germany in 1933, but were not able to get emigration visas into France, England or other European countries. Lotte worked on a Pabst film in France in 1933, but had to return to Germany, where she made six more films, between frequent “vacations” to England, Greece and other places in search of asylum. In 1936, Carl and Lotte resolved to leave Germany for good, even if it meant a transient existence, which it did. Jean Renoir employed Carl in Paris, while Lotte found some backing for silhouette films in England but both had to leave the country where they were every few months and re-enter on a new tourist visa, sometimes only meeting in the terminals at Dover and Calais (Guerin et al, n.d) 2"
