Krezip has been one of the top pop bands in the Netherlands for several years now. Founded as a schoolband, the quintet from Tilburg made their astonishing debut in 2000 with the album Nothing Less. They chalked up two hitsingles with I Wonâ€™t Cry and I Would Stay. The current album What Are You Waiting For marks a turning point for the band. The album offers a new sound with a host of dynamic punkpop songs and beautiful ballads.
