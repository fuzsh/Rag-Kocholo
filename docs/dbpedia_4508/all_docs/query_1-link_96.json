        "text": "Krezip\n\nKrezip is a Dutch band from Tilburg. Founded in 1997 with the Belgian band K's Choice as the greatest source of inspiration. Besides Jacqueline Govaert, the hard core consists of Anne Govaert on guitar, Annelies Kuijsters on keys and vocals, and Joost van Haaren on bass. On June 27, 2009, the band said goodbye in the Heineken Music Hall. In 2019, Krezip returned after a ten-year break, with an interview in De Wereld Draait Door on Tuesday, January 29, and with performances in the Ziggo Dome and Pinkpop. In 2020 they performed at Friends of Amstel Live.\n\nAny day now\n\nKrezip's new album, released on 180 grams of crustal clear vinyl, contains 11 titles. Front woman Jacqueline Govaert's strong vocals, combined with the uplifting pop song, including a guest appearance by Danny Vera, make this sixth studio album a strong post-reunion album."
