        "text": "published on 2017-03-08T21:24:25Z\n\nKrezip is an old Dutch band that has some great songs. This is my favorite one, for sure. I also think my voice fits their songs kinda well :) - Recorded this one on my phone with earphones in, and a crappy microphone (for calls). Well, I tried. #Dontjudge"
