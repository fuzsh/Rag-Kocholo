        "text": "Larry Mullen Jr had a front-row seat to watch his band U2 play at The Sphere in Las Vegas.\n\nThe drummer underwent neck surgery and was unable to take part in the Las Vegas residency. Bram van den Berg, who is the drummer for Krezip, performed with Bono, The Edge and Adam Clayton for the 40-show residency.\n\nLarry, 62, reunited with the band on Friday night as he enjoyed the band's second-last show from a special box seat. Bono said: \"Not since October 1978 have we played shows without Larry Mullen Jr and it's only right I start by introducing the man who saved the day when Larry Mullen could not make it.\n\nBono tells crowd to 'shut up' during passionate speech about Israel and Palestine\n\nU2 make history with Grammys performance from Las Vegas Sphere\n\n\"His name is already legend around here to people who can pronounce it. The flying while sitting-in Dutchman, Bram van den Berg on drums\", reports The Irish Mirror.\n\nBefore the concert, there were rumors that Larry might take to the stage at The Sphere for the last two concerts. But Bono said: \"The rumors that Larry will be playing with us tonight are not true sadly. But he is here with us!\n\n\"That is the man who pinned the note on the notice board at Mount Temple Comprehensive School all those years ago. And we are very grateful that he did and that he's here with us tonight.\n\n\"We wish him a speedy, speedy, speedy recovery. We love you, Larry Mullen Jr\".\n\nHe dedicated the final song, Beautiful Day, to the band's drummer. Bono said: \"It's a beautiful night Larry, and this is Beautiful Day.\" Bono changed the lyrics and sang, \"Larry Mullen, you're beautiful.\"\n\nAlicia Keys, Lizzo, Jason Kelce, and Adam Sandler see U2 at Las Vegas Sphere\n\nU2 joke that they’re ‘giving Vegas back’ as they suspend residency\n\nMullen later said it was an \"emotional\" night for him. He said: \"What an incredible night at the Sphere. So grateful to Bono, Edge and Adam and of course Bram for an amazing job. Very emotional night for me personally.\""
