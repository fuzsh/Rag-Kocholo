        "text": "The Sphere Las Vegas will once again welcome U2 for a run of immersive concerts. The upcoming string of shows take place from Friday, January 26.\n\nThere will be 15 shows in total, continuing on from the run of shows Bono and Co completed in 2023. Fans who have already had the chance to see the show were blown away by the performance and the incredible effects they experienced inside the Las Vegas Sphere.\n\nDemand for the shows is clearly high as U2 announced in December that they were adding four more dates to their 2024 run of shows in Vegas. Attendees have been blown away by the experience and incredible drone footage gives ticket holders a glimpse at what they can expect from the concert.\n\nRead more: Las Vegas Sphere records nearly $100 million loss in latest quarter\n\nWith images and clips circulating online showing off the experience, those who were lucky enough to get tickets are in for a treat.\n\nHow to get to Sphere Las Vegas for U2\n\nThe Sphere Las Vegas is located at 255 Sands Ave, Las Vegas, NV 89169. U2 fans can reach the venue by taking the LVM Monorail or the 119, 202, or 203 bus routes.\n\nFrom the Las Vegas Strip, it is a 28-minute walk. Head down E Flamingo Road and turn left onto Koval Lane, then turn right onto Sands Avenue.\n\nWhat dates are U2 playing Sphere Las Vegas?\n\nThe U2 Las Vegas shows begin this Friday, February 26. The band will play at The Sphere on the following dates:\n\nJanuary 26\n\nJanuary 27\n\nJanuary 31\n\nFebruary 2\n\nFebruary 3\n\nFebruary 7\n\nFebruary 9\n\nFebruary 10\n\nFebruary 15\n\nFebruary 17\n\nFebruary 18\n\nFebruary 23\n\nFebruary 24\n\nMarch 1\n\nMarch 2\n\nAre there still tickets for U2 in Vegas?\n\nTickets for U2 at the Las Vegas Sphere are available for select dates via Ticketmaster.\n\nWhat time does the U2 concert in Las Vegas start?\n\nThe U2 concerts at The Sphere Las Vegas begin at 8pm.\n\nIs the U2 Sphere show good?\n\nIt's safe to say that the U2 concert at The Las Vegas Sphere will be like nothing you have ever seen before. However, some fans have claimed that the overhang inside the Sphere is \"ruining\" the experience.\n\nBesides that, most fans have given the show positive reviews. Ticket holders are not only in for amazing visuals inside the Sphere, but they will be treated to a top-class performance from U2.\n\nBono has impressed fans with his enduring vocals and even uses an ancient Irish style of singing during the show. There have also been a few surprises during the band's last run at the groundbreaking venue, including a special appearance on stage from Lady Gaga.\n\nIs Larry Mullen Jr playing at U2:UV Achtung Baby Live at Sphere?\n\nU2's drummer, Larry Mullen Jr, did not play at The Sphere Las Vegas for the band's first round of shows at the venue. The 61-year-old was forced to pull out of a number of performances due to a planned surgery to take care of lingering back issues.\n\nDutch drummer Bram van den Berg from the band Krezip took his place for these shows. Larry Mullen Jr will not join his bandmates for their 2024 Las Vegas Sphere shows and U2 will once again be joined by Bram van den Berg."
