        "text": "Post by Kim on\n\nEveryone knows that memory recollection is triggered most strongly by your sense of smell. Sound would have to be a close second if not a tie. Just the way a certain chord hits you when you're at a milestone in your life, can trigger that feeling you had at that moment years later, even if you don't even like the song anymore!\n\nSo what songs bring back strong associations for you? It doesn't have to be rock, it can be anything. Our tastes evolve as we do, so if someone says that Marky Mark brought back a fond memory, don't give them a hard time about it. Give a short summary of the history of what that song means to you.\n\nI'll go first--\n\n\"If You Could Only See\" by Tonic.\n\nSo many songs I associate with high school (naturally), and I really loved this song (still do). I remember hanging out with the few friends I had at the time, singing it whenever it would come on the radio. Good times. I love that slide guitar, that was just so unique and is what really brings back memories for me.\n\n\"I Wish You Were Here\" by Incubus.\n\nI'd been living on my own for a year or two when this came out. I was in a stage of transition in my spiritual life, still connected with a lot of New Age-y stuff, and whenever this song came on, I felt like I could just float away in the sunset on the beach, \"and in this moment I am happy....happy...\"\n\n\"Closure\" by Chevelle\n\nThis one is triggered by the set of chords, at :28 intro, and during the chorus, \"You will nev-er be-long to meeeee....\", and at 1:39, right after the line, \"hold my breath till you rupture\". Almost orgasmic for me when the song first came out. It's not as intense now, but I still feel it deep in my gut.\n\n\"Purity\" by Slipknot\n\nA friend that used to go to my school, Dan, played a bootleg of this CD in the car one night when me, my friend Jane and him were driving around one October night in Ohio. We went nuts, it was so insane and incidentally, was my introduction into the metal genre. When Corey launched into the chorus at 2:05 \"You all stare, but you'll never see, there's something inside me\", the weird mix of drums, vocals and sound in the background gave me chills. It's also really hard to sing along to, and not fall on a flat note. I remember telling a few people about it at school the next day, but it hadn't been on the radio yet, and the cd hadn't been released either. That came out around Xmas of that year, and it just caught fire with the other kids who were into it. I played the shit out of that cd!\n\nWell, there are a few of mine. I have so many more that I have stories for, but I figure these are a good start.\n\nPost by shroomfairy on\n\nI'll have to keep thinking and post more later, great thread idea!!!\n\n\"She drives me crazy\" by the Fine Young Cannibals freaks me out!!! The summer that this song was a huge hit I read the Stephen King book 'It'. I could not put the book down and read it in 2 days. That song must have played on the radio every hour and every time I hear it I think of the clown in the sewer and it's scares me a little, lol!\n\n\"Not Falling\" by Mudvayne has awesome memories for me. I was not a Mudvayne fan until this video made it on MTV. I would often leave the tv on while I was doing chores and when I heard Chad's voice I was trying to figure out who was singing. It took me a few days to catch the video at the beginning so I could see their name. I was so surprised! I was thinking \"What about all that weird make up?\" & \"Damn! He is cute!\" I was soon hooked. After getting the Cd and listening over and over, Not Falling helped me through some tough times.\n\n\"Don't Forget Me\"By Red Hot Chili Peppers is so sweet for me. My hubby and I went to see them in concert by ourselves. (we usually go to shows with a group of friends) We were enjoying the show so much and when this song came on we were singing it to each other. (hubby usually does not sing along) Every time I hear it I think of that awesome show shared with my hubby!\n\nPost by mudvayner on\n\nLet's see:\n\nHoly Wars...The Punishment Due by Megadeth 'cause it was the first Megadeth song I ever heard. In fact, it was the first Metal song I've ever heard. Thank you Lord Mustaine xD\n\nRuins of the Future by Borknagar. When I heard Vortex screaming in the intro and the line: \"Upon the ruins of future...\" for the first time, I was like: Wow who the fuck is this guy? He sings amazingly! and right after that it began my BorknagarAddiction (especially for ICS Vortex work) xD\n\nNot Falling by Mudvayne. First song I ever heard from them. Also, this song reminds me of the time I was searching on the net for some Mudvayne sites in order to get to meet people who also liked Mudvayne and share opinions, pictures, info, etc..and I found Mud-World Forums...Well, I got to meet cool people there (especially those who really liked the band) and made awesome friends too\n\nSleepwalker by Megadeth...First song LIVE I ever heard from my favorite band in the world...When I saw and heard Mustaine's guitar intro of this song I almost fainted... man they're so awesome live and I'm really thankful they came here on tour. Weee I still can't believe I got to see Mustaine live. Awesomeness ;D\n\nForgotten Love by Elis...reminds of how much I got disappointed with this guy I was really into, and how sad I was because of the way it all ended.\n\nDrowse by Queen. I love this song. It makes me feel very good and at peace with myself everytime I listen to it.\n\nHmmm I guess that's pretty much it.\n\nPost by Kim on\n\nAwesome! Just the kind of stuff I was hoping for\n\nI always had a problem with the dark after seeing \"It\" on tv one night when I was 7 or 8. I couldn't make it past the clown ripping off Georgie's arm when he reached down into the sewer drain. Got up and left! I've rewatched it since, read the book at least a dozen times, and I'm over it now, but man, that messed me up for a good portion of my childhood! That, and some cheesy B movie that had a spider the size of a car in the sewer/subway system. It wove huge webs that people got tangled in and then you'd hear the scratching of it's legs on the tunnel walls as it came back to devour its meal. Ugn.\n\nAnother song I forgot to mention:\n\n\"Dont You Forget About Me\" by Simple Minds.\n\nI used to sleepwalk and have waking dreams when I was little, and this happened before my parents divorced, so I'd say I was around 5 years old. I remember being in the den room late at night, mom and dad were elsewhere in the house. The lights and tv were on, and a music video playing this song was on VH1. Except this wasn't the real video. This video was of a dark cave, firelight illuminating these gigantic sand-colored cobras (these things had to have been at least 50 feet long, they were thick as tree trunks). They were positioned in a circle around this huge bonfire that had a massive cauldron of boiling liquid suspended above it. The lead singer was slowly being lowered into the pot by ropes, singing out to a woman who was walking by the entrance of the cave, \"Don't you forget about me.\" The snakes were hissing and weaving back and forth the whole time. The song ended when his head went under the water. It was pretty fucking surreal. I always think of that when I hear that song on the 80's station.\n\nPost by hvymtlmom on\n\nhere's a few of mine:\n\nMetallica-\"Nothing Else Matters\":My daughter & I have always loved this song, especially the meanin behind the lyrics. Back in 2003 her and I drove 4 hours to Orlando to see Summer Sanitarium together (also our first Mudvayne experience!) We had a fun day despite the rain and when Metallica started doing this song, she put her arm around me and hugged me tight during the whole thing. We've always had a great relationship, but the spontaneity of that moment still overwhelms me. Whenever I hear that song now, it brings back memories of that awesome day, Seeing Chad for the first time up on that big screen, being out in the rain during Linkin Park, wishing the pyro would blow Fred Durst off the stage, standing under the stadium eating kettle corn, giggling as we watched from a distance the guys entering the restroom who didn't notice that the door was wide open and in full view of the urinals! But mostly it reminds me of how much I enjoy roadtrips with just her & I talking the whole way, listening to music and how fortunate that I am to have a daughter as who is such a caring, compassionate, intelligent, free-thinking individual. I had been thinking a long time about having a small butterfly (my very first tattoo) on my ankle redone and made \"prettier\". When I mentioned this to her, she got really upset because (unbeknown to me) she had always loved that tattoo and remembered even as a baby being fascinated by it. She reminded me that just because it wasn't what most people perceive to be ideal, that didn't mean it wasn't special...in other words, when I got that tattoo many years ago, there must have been a reason I chose it, so it didn't matter what other people thought so why change it? That once again brought home the meaning of the lyrics \"forever trusting who we are, and nothing else matters\" and a week after seeing Metallica again with her in 2004, I had those words tattooed on above the butterfly. It doesn't have her name on it, but that tattoo is definitely for my daughter and everytime I look at it, we're back at Summer Sanitarium listening to that song!\n\nAerosmith-\"Dream On\" I'm giving away my age here, but whenever I hear it, I'm reminded vividly of my high school years. It was on the jukebox in our cafeteria and it was played quite often. Aerosmith was also my second concert ever (and it was on Halloween)...and in those days, I used to get really wasted at shows so Dream On always brings back visions of the weed-smoke filled auditorium and the awesome people I went with, including one of my boyfriends. At one point him & I were sitting on the floor making out and I remember 2 security guys coming up to us and telling us to knock it off! For some reason, I actually remember what I wore too...even though I can't remember shit from yesterday, I can remember THAT from so many years ago?! It was jeans with a gold weed leaf sewn onto it LOL\n\nDeftones-\"Change In The House Of Flies\" I've never particularly been much of a Deftones fan (yeah, yeah, I know some of you on here are). The second time I saw them, it was at Family Values 2006. I was there with my husband and daughter. We had fairly close seats, which was a good thing because (as often happens in West Palm) it rained like hell during the later half of the show. But even with seats, we were getting soaked because it was blowing in. During this particular song, everyone around us was standing up, singing along but my daughter and I were sitting, huddled together, the rain blowing into our faces, yet the rain felt good, listening to everyone singing was awesome (I love when concerts turn into sing-a-longs). I don't know how else to describe it, but it was such nice, calming experience, which if you've ever been to an all day festival, is a rare occurrence in such a hectic day! I wouldn't actually call myself a Deftones fan, but hearing this song brings it all back\n\nPost by Naomi on\n\nMy music taste, has always been, and always will be, quite... diverse..\n\nCreep-Stone Temple PilotsI was really young when I first heard this. It was the very first song I felt a connection with.\n\nThousand Words - Savage Garden I was just a kid when I got their cd (I grew up on tapes, it was one of my first cds)... It was one of the first songs I heard in my life that I could actually relate to.. (mind you the 90's on the radio here ignored the metal/grunge/rock--they played pop)\n\nCradle-Mudvayne This was my very first Mudvayne song.. I was only a sprog but I knew it was special.. I only caught a few words that day, but I remembered them enough that when I rediscoverd Mudvayne the next year it was the first song I recognised.\n\nAlone-Korn I grew up listening to Korn, but when this song first came out.. It was quite a difficult time.. It was one of the few songs that nursed me through that time.\n\nIn her Sun-Krezip This song was one of the first tracks on a cd a friend of mine in Germany sent me.. It really caught my attention.. I couldn't relate to it the initial way, but through contextual meaning, it was a jewel.\n\nProtection-Krezip As soon as I heard the first verse of this song I fell in love with it. It nursed me right on through until I found myself a better situation.. Now I listen to it to remember where I came from.\n\nDer Rebell-Die Aerzte This song says it all if you understand German. It was excellent for me: upbeat, something I could completely relate to, and it WASN'T English! It gave me room to vent out what I needed to, but without being in English so it also provided me with a place to hide. \"Ich nenn es Freiheit, ihr nennt es Mangel an Respekt!\"\n\nRaspberry-I Mother Earth A friend gave me their album Scenery and Fish and I tried it out. I already knew the band but this song struck a chord with me, ensuring my fanship.\n\nPayback-Flaw My first flaw song.. Everytime I hear it it reminds me of my friend who gave it to me.. we did some really retarded things in those days, and we'd prolly still do them now haha\n\nLose Yourself-Eminem This was a time when EVERYONE was bitching at me about my love for music.. It handed me hope and it helped me grow stronger by helping me realise that I just got to keep pushing forward.\n\nWon't Cry-Krezip One day I went walking out in a thunderstorm.. it was so intense and calming at the same time, when I got back I was soaked to the skin, I didn't bother to change, I didn't mind the soaked feeling somehow when I turned on that song.. finally felt okay, I can't even describe the feeling.. Now when I listen to it I remember that feeling it gave me.\n\nWorld So Cold-Mudvayne This song always reminds me of being in high school in the lunch room with my best friend...\n\nNever Born-Guano Apes This song reminds me of those days when life sucked more; puts me back in my place but in a relaxing way..\n\n(Per)Version of a Truth-Mudvayne When my best friend moved away this song was the only thing that got me to get myself together.. It helps me remember him, as he like the song, but it also reminds me of healing, I guess..\n\nUso Mitai Na I Love You-Utada Hikaru I love this song. Something freaky happened last october (3rd anniversary of owning the song), right when she sang (I'll write it in English) \"As I watch the fleeing shadows run along the road\" Leaves blew off the trees and the shandows almost danced across the road!\n\nEven freakier: It's a song about chasing after something unreachable that no matter how close you're never sure if you touched it, and if you did, you keep losing grip on it.. ; after the leaf incident: the guy it became about (before it was just about my friends to me) passed me in his car! I was nervous for over 2 hours and I still get cold shivers every time I listen to this song--even on repeat!"
