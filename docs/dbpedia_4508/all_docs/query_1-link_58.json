        "text": "Pinkpop, the most iconic festival the Netherlands has ever known. And for a good reason, because the world's greatest artists have performed at the pink coloured festival.\n\nFor some this meant their big breakthrough, for others another opportunity to show what they have to offer.\n\nUnfortunately, that's not the case this year. Reason enough to take a look at the most iconic acts of all time!\n\n5. Foo Fighters 2011\n\nPinkpop was closed in style in 2011 by the Foo Fighters, arguably the best rock band in the world at the time.\n\nAnd despite previous attempts by the likes of Coldplay Kaiser Chiefs, 30 Seconds To Mars and Deadmau5 to make the entire audience go crazy, Dave Grohl seems to have no problem doing so.\n\nDuring the performance we saw rain, sun and a beautiful rainbow decorate the beautiful festival site. Goosebumps looking back on it!\n\n4. Krezip 2000\n\nKrezip, perhaps the odd one out, would experience their big breakthrough in 2000. Jacqueline Govaert was only 18 years old when she appeared at the festival with her band for the first time, but it certainly didn't stop there..\n\nSeveral songs from the debut album ‘Nothing Less’ entered the Top 40 after the performance and their song 'I Would Stay' stayed at number 1 for 3 weeks.\n\n3. Metallica 2014\n\nDuring a wonderful weekend with the Rolling Stones, John Mayer, Arctic Monkeys, Ed Sheeran and Stromae, among others, Metallica faced a tough task. The band was the closing act on the line-up.\n\nHowever, it didn't quite go as planned..\n\nCrouched on the ground, the audience takes cover from rain and lightning, waiting to see if the show can go on at all.\n\nBut when the first notes were played, the release was enormous among the fans who had just had to endure the terrible storm.\n\nWould you also have braved the storm for Metallica?\n\n2. Rage Against the Machine 1993\n\nDuring their spectacular show in 1993, Rage Against the Machine didn't just get the audience moving. The overwhelming sound and jumping fans caused an earthquake of no less than 1 on the Richter scale. Unheard of, right?\n\nWhen the audience left, the damage really became apparent!\n\n26 years later, they returned in an attempt to recreate this iconic show. Eddie had even donned the same green Tivoli-shirt for it!\n\nWe can endlessly discuss what the most iconic Pinkpop performance ever is. We are therefore very curious about your stories! Let us know what your favourite Pinkpop show is and don't forget to add the gig in the app!"
