        "text": "The drummer of Krezip about drumming and his new band.\n\nMany successful hits in one year. That is how you can best describe 2005 for drummer Bram van den Berg. Last week he hit The Netherlands to a new world record with eight other drummers, as if it was just another drum case in his tight schedule with Krezip. So, a new world record, a new band, a well selling new cd and his own fanclub. Reasons enough to ask this sticksman about his activities and experiences of the past year.\n\nWe're writing November 11, 2005. Location: Nighttown, Rotterdam in The Netherlands. Tonight Bram is performing with Krezip, a very famous Dutch Rock band that released her new album 'What Are You Waiting For' in May this year. After the sound check Bram is eager to talk about the band and drumming. \"Just guys talking drums, aren't we?\", he says. What we directly noticed is the full and warm sound of his drum kit.\n\n\"Yeah, awesome isn't it! I am so happy with the sound I have now. It is my new Tama Starclassic. Much better then my old Sonor, that I still use in our rehearsal room by the way. This set has just everything I need for playing with Krezip. It is the sound I have been looking for.\"\n\nSo you enjoy playing with Krezip, I figure?\n\n\"Very much indeed! Particularly now on our current tour where we play in the major concert halls of The Netherlands and Belgium. Earlier this year we did a lot of festivals and this tour is different, just as working in the studio is. It's all nice to do but with this tour we know people are coming for us, they buy the tickets just to see us. On a festival you can't be really sure of that.\"\n\nAnd you already feel comfortable in the band and the music? When you joined Krezip your first job was to record the new album.\n\n\"Well, actually all felt good in Krezip right away. Not only because I knew these guys and girls already but musically we are on the same level as well. I am a song drummer. And in Krezip that is exactly what I get to do. With One in a Million [my former band] I could play much more, straight forward noise making, really. In Krezip I am more focussed on the band as a whole, the songs, but I still can do the things I want when I feel to. It doesn't have to be that technical for me, I must say. Don't get me wrong, I love the heavy technical drummers but I rather focus on songs: serving the song, so to speak. That is probably why I didn't have too much trouble with recording the new album when entering the band. I love these kind of challenges actually. It keeps me focussed and on the edge and that is when I am at my best.\"\n\nIn the video with this article you can see that Bram's technique is better then he probably would like to admit. The video contains Bram's drum solo during the show.\n\n\"That was an idea of Jacqueline. She wanted a drum solo in the show but I didn't really do that kind of thing as of yet. So I withdrew from the band for a while and sat down to figure something out. I came up with something that the band liked right away.\"\n\nYou are an intensive player, like watching Kenny Aronoff play.\n\n\"I just want to create a full sound and try to create that by playing as I do. And on this drum set it is really possible. It is the way I like to play. My greatest influences actually do the same. Drummers like Roger Taylor, Taylor Hawkins and Dave Grohl. Man, their sound is just awesome. But at the same time they are also drummers who focus on the songs, not the heavy technical stuff. For instance take 'We Will Rock You' of Queen. It's boom boom tak, boom boom tak. That rhythm is totally nothing but everything at the same time. The public knows it, remembers it and claps his hands on it. That's how it should be.\"\n\nBut don't you have to do a very good warming up when playing like this?\n\n\"I have some Cesar therapy kind of exercises. A little pulling and stretching to get my muscles warm before the show starts. And I do the good old excercises of course.\"\n\nDo you practice often?\n\n\"Almost every day. We have our own rehearsal room with Krezip and I go there every day to play for a few hours. To keep me in shape which is necessary for the tour of course. I do not practice the songs or the set we're going to play in the evening. I go there to study my grooves. That's what I am doing right now and want to get better at. Recently I bought this cool Bop drumming method of..er..what's his name? Well, you get the picture, right? Hahaha!\"\n\nBram's style and determination are a perfect fit within Krezip. Asking Jacqueline Govaert, lead singer of the band, how she looks back on Bram's first eleven months with Krezip so far, she replies:\n\n\"Eleven months already? Haha, time flies! But Bram was a full member of Krezip from the moment he walked into our rehearsal room. He is a great drummer and we can rely on him all the time. When I look at him on the stage he is there, listening and keeping an eye on each and every one of us. What else do you need from a drummer who's playing is already great?\"\n\nJust one last question for you, Bram. Tell us about the World Record and playing for 102 hours in a row.\n\n\"That was just awesome! Playing with nine drummers in sessions of 2 or 4 hours and changing the team with every session. A great experience but, when starting at 6 pm. it takes a while before you're back into the game, haha. But playing with a drummer like Erwin Gielen, that guy is just great! And Mark van Tilborg, man, this guy does all kind of Latin things. Very cool stuff. Yes Latin, I want to get into that as well. Do you know any good methods for that? Here, write them down for me...\""
