The festival lived up to its legendary reputation with rain-soaked fun, but that didn't stop the incredible energy and unforgettable moments. Dancing in the mud has never been this joyfull! 🌧️💃 Huge thanks to everyone who braved the weather and partied with us. You made this weekend truly special! 🙏\n\nWhat an incredible festival weekend we've had once again! This time, we lit up the heart of our own country. De Amsterdamse Zomer (The Amsterdam Summer) is a musical celebration, and we had the honor of illuminating the Olympic Stadium. ❤️🔥 💡 We used our follow-me system to track all the artists on stage, making sure they were always perfectly showcased. 📷 by Set Vexy 4Light Technical Projects\n\nLast weekend, we had an amazing time working on SAGA festival! We took charge of the Techno Area, creating detailed technical drawings and providing one of our expert operators to ensure the light show ran smoothly. Festival season is our favorite time of year! ❤️\n\nWe're thrilled to reflect on another successful year at Neversea Festival! From careful preparations in our studio to precise timecode programming, we ensured every lighting detail was perfect for the artists and the live show. ✨ On-site, our skilled team delivered an unforgettable experience. We are extremely pleased with the results. Thank you to everyone involved and the amazing crowd who made this event truly special. See you next time! 💃🕺\n\nJust like last year, we took charge of the light shows at Panama Open Air in Bonn, Germany. It was a pleasure illuminating the festival and creating unforgettable moments in such an electric atmosphere. ✨ Thanks to everyone who joined us and danced under the lights! 🙏\n\nWhat an incredible night we had at the unique Blueprint Open Air Festival in Eindhoven! Under the majestic dome of the iconic Evoluon, which looks like a gigantic UFO, we lit up the city with our light show. 🚀✨ We played a real 'home game' in this beautiful Dutch city, and we absolutely loved it! While we enjoy traveling all over the world, there's nothing quite like performing in our own backyard. 🇳🇱🌍 Thank you to everyone who was there and made this night unforgettable. Until next time, whether it's here or somewhere else in the world! 🌟\n\nFor many years, we've been teaming up with Afrojack to create unforgettable shows. His beats and our lights merge into a seamless harmony. 🎶✨ We've been on tour with him for a while now, ensuring every performance looks captivating. While he's rocking the stage, we're behind the scenes making it all happen. During those busy weekends, we're advancing and perfecting every detail. We are grateful for this collaboration and the amazing work we get to do every day. 🤩\n\nTouring with Krezip is always a blast, and this theater tour was no exception! 🎭✨ Swipe through to get an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at how we bring our lighting visions to life on stage. We've wrapped up some unforgettable theater shows and festival performances, and now we're gearing up for open-air theaters starting in a few weeks. After that, we're looking forward to Krezip’s club tour this fall! 📷 pics by Ben Houdijk\n\nWhat an incredible weekend at EDC Las Vegas! 🔥 Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) is the largest electronic music festival in the USA, transforming the Las Vegas Motor Speedway into a vibrant, otherworldly spectacle. ❤️🔥🎡✨ For over a decade, The Art of Light has been proud to be a part of this magical experience, commissioned by TWOFIFTYK. 💡 This year, we brought the Cosmic Meadow stage to life, creating an unforgettable atmosphere with our innovative lighting design. From dusk till dawn, our lights dazzled the diverse crowd, enhancing every beat and performance. Thank you to everyone who joined us for this epic celebration. 🙏 See you next year, EDC!"
