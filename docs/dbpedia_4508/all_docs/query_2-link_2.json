It is their second album on their new label Sony BMG. The album was released on May 11, 2007. It notably features a disco-inspired sound on most of its songs as opposed to the alternative rock sound of earlier albums. This was because the band decided they needed a big change to their sound after ten years. Lead singer Jacqueline Govaert decided to base this new sound on bands such as Blondie and The Sounds;[1] in fact, members Jesper Anderberg and Felix Rodriguez of The Sounds co-wrote some of the album's tracks.\n\nA special edition of the album was released on February 29, 2008.\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Play This Game With Me\" (Jacqueline Govaert, Felix Rodriguez, Jesper Anderberg) - 04:00\n\n\"Life Is Sweet\" (Govaert, Adel Dahdal, Peter Mansson) - 03:31\n\n\"Plug It In & Turn Me On\" (Govaert, JanPeter Hoekstra) - 03:41\n\n\"Ordinary Day\" (Govaert, Hoekstra) - 03:27\n\n\"Can't You Be Mine\" (Govaert, Wizardz of Oz) - 03:02\n\n\"Easy Way Out\" (Govaert, Hoekstra) - 03:13\n\n\"Not Tonight\" (Govaert, Malcolm Pardon, Fredrik Rinman) - 04:10\n\n\"Bored\" (Govaert, Malcolm Pardon, Fredrik Rinman) - 03:29\n\n\"You're Wrong\" (Govaert, Rodriguez, Anderberg) - 03:25\n\n\"Hey There Love\" (Govaert, Hoekstra) - 04:35\n\n\"All My Life\" (Govaert, Rodriguez, Anderberg) - 03:36\n\nBonus tracks on Special Edition:\n\n\"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime\" (James Warren) - 04:27\n\n\"Plug It In & Turn Me On\" - Live @ HMH (Govaert, Hoekstra) - 03:43\n\n\"I Would Stay\" - Live @ HMH (Govaert) - 06:39\n\n\"All My Life\" - Live @ HMH (Govaert, Rodriguez, Anderberg) - 04:00\n\n\"Venus\" - Live @ HMH (Robbie van Leeuwen) - 03:21\n\n\"Look What You've Done\" (Govaert, Hoekstra) - 02:16\n\nCredits\n\n[edit]\n\nBand members:\n\nJacqueline Govaert - Vocals, piano\n\nAnne Govaert - Guitars, backing vocals\n\nJanPeter Hoekstra - Guitars\n\nAnnelies Kuijsters - Keyboards, backing vocals\n\nJoost van Haaren - Bass\n\nBram van den Berg - Drums\n\nPersonnel:\n\nAdel Dahdal & Peter Mansson - Recording, production and mixing (Original album tracks)\n\nDjoum - Assistant engineer\n\nBjorn Engelmann - Mastering (Original album tracks)\n\nPontus Hagberg - String arrangements on \"All My Life\" and \"Ordinary Day\"\n\nTijmen Zinkhaan - Production, recording and mixing on \"Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime\" and live bonus tracks\n\nJanPeter Hoekstra & Hans Hanneman - Recording and mixing on \"Look What You've Done\"\n\nDarius van Helfteren - Mastering (bonus tracks)\n\nRuud Baan - Photography\n\nPascal Duval - Art direction and design\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]"
