        "text": "The Story of Armin van Buuren\n\nArmin van Buuren, born 25 December 1976, is a Dutch music producer and DJ. He is known for mostly playing progressive trance and uplifting trance. He has won a number of accolades, including the #1 spot on DJ Magazine’s Top 100 DJs fan poll a record of 5 times, including an unprecedented four consecutive years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and again in 2012. He is currently the #2 DJ on DJ Magazine’s Top 100 DJs poll for 2013. Since 2001, Armin van Buuren has hosted a weekly radio show called A State of Trance, which has 20 million weekly listeners in 26 countries. This radio show propelled him to superstardom and garnered an intense following of trance fans around the world. His 2008 studio album, Imagine, entered the Dutch album chart at No. 1, a first for a dance music artist in Dutch music history.\n\nPersonal life\n\nArmin van Buuren was born in Leiden, Netherlands, on 25 December 1976, but grew up in Koudekerk aan den Rijn. Van Buuren started making music when he was 14. He was inspired by French electronic music composer Jean Michel Jarre. He graduated from the Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden in 1995, and studied law at Leiden University. He began working as a DJ in Club Next, playing multiple sets a week, most of which lasted six or more hours. As his musical career began to take off he put his law degree on hold, although he returned to graduate from law school in 2003.\n\nCareer of Armin van Buuren\n\n1995–1999: Early career and success\n\nIn 1995, Armin van Buuren had his first major success with a track called “Blue Fear”, which was released under the Cyber Records label; he was 19 years old. This track, which was produced in the euro-trance mold, made it onto the UK Chart. Another successful track, “Communication” was released under the same label, and became popular in Ibiza, Spain in the summer of 1999. After being signed to AM PM Records, this track entered the UK Chart at No. 18 in 2000.\n\nArmin van Buuren began his DJ career at club Nexus in Leiden, where he learned to play long DJ sets, which were regularly six to seven hours per set. During school holidays he played more than four times a week. In 1999, he met Dave Lewis who introduced him as a DJ in England and the United States. His career accelerated, entering the DJ magazine Top-100 in November 2001 at Number 27. He has played in more than 25 countries and can often be found on the main stage at big summer festivals. Armin van Buuren played a record-breaking twelve and a half-hour set for Dancetheater in The Hague, Netherlands. In the United Kingdom he performs regularly at Passion (resident 2002), Godskitchen, Gatecrasher, Slinky, Ministry of Sound, Peach and Golden.\n\nIn the beginning of 1999, Armin van Buuren started his label Armind together with United Recordings. The first release, Gig – “One,” was well received. The second release “Touch Me,” under the name Rising Star was signed to Ministry of Sound in the UK, before the record was released.\n\nBy the time of his third release, Gimmick – “Free” was signed to R&S Records, his label was popular. Under the surname Gaia he released “4 Elements” on Captivating Sounds, a sub-label of Warner Brothers. Teaming up with Tiësto, two new projects were born: Major League – “Wonder Where You Are?” was released on Black Hole Recordings and Alibi – “Eternity” was released on Armind. “Eternity” received club and chart success and was signed to Paul van Dyk’s imprint Vandit Records. Another major collaboration followed this. Together with Ferry Corsten, Armin van Buuren recorded a riff titled “Exhale” for the System F. album. Released as a single, this track reached gold status in less than a month.\n\n2000–2004: A State of Trance and 76\n\nIn 2000, Armin van Buuren started his own Armin van Buuren compilation series. He found a balance between progressive house, and vocal trance music styles. His first compilation album, A State of Trance (not to be confused with his weekly A State of Trance radio shows), sold 10,000 copies and contains Van Buuren’s remix of Moogwai, “Viola”. His second album, Basic Instinct featured a new track: “Perpetuous Dreamer” – “The Sound of Goodbye”. This track entered the Dutch charts in June 2001 at number 26. Later in the year, the track hit No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The third album, In Motion was released 6 August 2001. A fourth album, Transparence, followed in 2002. In 2003, he worked with such artists such as DJ Seth Alan Fannin throughout a global tour on Dance Revolution in Europe, selling out to crowds of 20,000 people in the Netherlands.\n\nIn March 2001, Armin van Buuren started his own radio show on ID&T Radio (traditionally broadcast in Dutch and later English since ASOT 183). In this weekly two-hour show, entitled A State of Trance, he plays the latest popular trance music tracks. His show and the artists he features are popularized by publishing the artists and track titles on his website. When ID&T Radio changed genres in 2004, Van Buuren left and took A State of Trance with him. The show then moved to Fresh FM and later SLAM!FM, two Dutch radio stations. It is now a weekly feature on Radio 538, another Dutch radio station, DI.FM, an online radio station, and on XM Satellite Radio, channel 80 in the United States and Canada.
