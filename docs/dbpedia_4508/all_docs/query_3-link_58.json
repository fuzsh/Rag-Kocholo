        "text": "Over the past few months, Las Vegas’ Sphere has gained a bit of a reputation for being a pricey place to catch concerts.\n\nHowever, when the Super Bowl comes to town, tickets for all other events in the big game’s vicinity go up and down more than ever.\n\nExhibit A: For the first time in months, fans can snag seats to see Rock and Roll Hall of Famers U2 live as part of their ongoing residency at Sphere for under $250.\n\nBased on our findings, at the time of publication, our team found seats going for as low as $230 before fees on Vivid Seats.\n\nAlthough that sounds expensive, just last week tickets were nearly $70 more (!) for the same exact show.\n\nAnd once you factor in that this is a one-of-a-kind, visually spectacular concert experience you won’t want to miss live, this just might be your best bet if you’re looking for things to do in Las Vegas during Super Bowl week.\n\nWant to see Bono and The Edge rock out at Sphere in the very near future?\n\nWe’ve got everything you need to know and more below.\n\nAll prices listed above are subject to fluctuation.\n\nU2 ticket prices\n\nA complete calendar including all show dates, start times and links to the cheapest tickets available versus what they cost last week can be found here:\n\n(Note: The New York Post confirmed all above prices at the publication time. All prices are in US dollars, subject to fluctuation and include additional fees at checkout.)\n\nVivid Seats is a verified secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\n\nThey offer a 100% buyer guarantee that states your transaction will be safe and secure and your tickets will be delivered prior to the event.\n\nOther shows at the Las Vegas Sphere\n\nWhen U2 isn’t literally lighting up the stage at the Sphere, you can catch Academy Award-nominated director Darren Aronofsky’s immersive film “Postcard From Earth” on most nights.\n\nAlso, from April 18-21, jam band legends Phish are scheduled to play four back-to-back-to-back-to-back gigs.\n\nThen, in May and June, Dead and Company with John Mayer will take over Sphere for 18 shows.\n\nIf you’re planning a Las Vegas trip, you can find a complete calendar of all events at the Sphere here.\n\nThings to do in Las Vegas during Super Bowl week\n\nIf you find yourself in Sin City leading up to the Chiefs-49ers rematch on Feb. 11, there will be no shortage of shows, parties and games to check out.\n\nFor those unsure of where to start, check out our list of the 12 biggest concerts, comedy shows, parties, golf and hockey games in Las Vegas leading up to the Super Bowl here.\n\nU2 set list\n\nThe Irish rockers headlined at The Sphere on Dec. 16.\n\nHere’s what they played that night, courtesy of Set List FM:\n\n01.) “Zoo Station”\n\n02.) “The Fly”\n\n03.) “Even Better Than the Real Thing”\n\n04.) “Mysterious Ways”\n\n05.) “One”\n\n06.) “Until the End of the World”\n\n07.) “Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses”\n\n08.) “Tryin’ to Throw Your Arms Around the World”\n\nTurntable\n\n09.) “All I Want Is You”\n\n10.) “Desire”\n\n11.) “Angel of Harlem”\n\n12.) “Love Rescue Me”\n\nAchtung Baby\n\n13.) “Acrobat”\n\n14.) “So Cruel”\n\n15.) “Ultraviolet (Light My Way)”\n\n16.) “Love Is Blindness”\n\nEncore:\n\n17.) “Elevation”\n\n18.) “Atomic City”\n\n19.) “Vertigo”\n\n20.) “Where the Streets Have No Name”\n\n21.) “With or Without You”\n\n22.) “Beautiful Day”\n\nU2 band members\n\nThe genre-bending legends have largely been a steady four-man unit since the group’s inception in 1976.\n\nHowever, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. will sit out the Las Vegas residency to recuperate from surgery according to U2’s website.\n\nAs a result, the lineup for all shows will include Bono on lead vocals, The Edge on guitar and Adam Clayton manning bass.\n\nThe trio will be joined by keyboardist Terry Lawless and replacement drummer Bram van den Berg.\n\nPrior to playing with U2, van den Berg performed with Dutch pop-rock group Krezip.\n\nClassic rockers on tour in 2024\n\nU2 has been tearing up the charts since the early days of MTV.\n\nHere are just five of our favorite contemporaries of theirs on the road this year.\n\n• Billy Joel\n\n• Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\n\n• The Rolling Stones\n\n• The Eagles\n\n• Stevie Nicks"
