        "text": "Cold and Staind are probably the most depressing bands out there but maybe these can help too:\n\nYellowcard (can be depressing for me...)\n\nK's Choice (Belgian band, maybe some people know them)\n\nEric Carmen - All By Myself (now that's a pretty depressing song, to me at least)\n\nSome other slow sad songs but I can't really remember...\n\nWhile that doesn't apply to me, you have a valid point there.\n\nAnd it's not necessarily the message behind the song I was talking about, it's a slow moody ballad. It can easily be interpreted as depressing.\n\nYea a couple of people mentioned Hello, that song is creepy, her voice is so haunting. sends shivers down my spine\n\nMy December - Linkin Park\n\nLet It All Out - Relient K\n\nIf I Were You - Hoobastank\n\nThat's all I can really think of. x.x\n\nFixed it for you.\n\nProject 86 - Something We Can't Be\n\nDemon Hunter - The Tide Began to Rise\n\nI had a few more, but I forgot what they were. I'll come back and edit this when I can remember them.\n\nLimp Bizkit - Behind blue eyes (Ah, yes...Fred Durst...very depressing... )\n\nCreed - Don't stop Dancing\n\nI can't seem to think of any other depressing stuf...why didn't you ask for agressive songs?...I'd know a butt-load of those\n\nmaybe some other day i'll ask for some agressive ones.\n\nOkay well I just so happen to like a lot of depressing songs, so heres some of the most depressing ones..\n\nOutside - Stand & Fred Durst\n\nYesterday - The Beatles\n\nMost Dashboard Confessional songs\n\nWhat Sarah Said - Death Cab For Cutie\n\nWish You Were Here - Fred Durst & Johnny Reznick\n\nMad World - Gary Jules (Already been mentioned)\n\nIris - Goo Goo Dolls (Also been mentioned)\n\nSometimes - Grey Daze\n\nKill The Messenger - Jack's Mannequin\n\nDrugs or Me - Jimmy Eat World\n\nGround Xero - Mark Wakefield\n\nLife and Death - Michael Giacchino\n\nSuteki Da Ne - Rikki Nakano/Nobuo Uematsu\n\nEchoes - The Rosewood Fall (Good luck finding it though)\n\nDirty Little Secret - Sarah McLachlan\n\nChasing Cars - Snow Patrol"
