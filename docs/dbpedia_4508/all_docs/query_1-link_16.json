        "text": "With a voice that's both silvery and raw, Dutch singer and pianist Jacqueline Govaert began writing songs at age 12. As lead singer and main songwriter, she formed the English-language Dutch alt-rock group Krezip in Tilburg in 1997 while still in her midteens. Their first full-length album, 2000's Nothing Less, featured hit song \"I Would Stay\" and topped the album charts in the Netherlands and Belgium, going 3x platinum.\n\nTwo more albums followed, 2002's Days Like This and What Are You Waiting For in 2005. A more electronic, disco-influenced album, Plug It In, arrived in 2007. Their final (multi-platinum) album, Best Of, which included hit single \"Sweet Goodbyes\", was released in late 2008 after which Krezip officially disbanded.\n\nGovaert quickly embarked on a solo career, releasing Good Life in the summer of 2010. It hit number three on the Dutch album chart. The intimate Songs to Soothe followed in 2014, and topped the chart. Recorded in Los Angeles with Crowded House producer Mitchell Froom and guests including drummer Matt Chamberlain, bassist Bob Glaub, and guitarist Val McCallum, the more soulful Lighthearted Years became her third straight Top Ten album after its release in 2017.\n\nOn January 28, 2019 -ten years after disbanding- Krezip reformed and released come back single “Lost Without You” followed by their fifth full length album \"Sweet High\" later that year. Both releases went platinum.\n\nJacqueline Govaert and FabFilter\n\n\"I love working in my home studio so I can work at my own pace.
