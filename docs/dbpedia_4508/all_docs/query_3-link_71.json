        "text": "Personal life\n\nArmin van Buuren was born in Leiden, Netherlands, on 25 December 1976,[1] but grew up in Koudekerk aan den Rijn. Van Buuren started making music when he was 14.[18] He was inspired by French electronic music composer Jean Michel Jarre.[18][19] He graduated from the Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden in 1995, and studied law at Leiden University. He began working as a DJ in Club Nexus, playing multiple sets a week, most of which lasted six or more hours.[20] As his musical career began to take off he put his law degree on hold, although he returned to graduate from law school in 2003.\n\nOn 18 September 2009, Van Buuren married Erika van Thiel, with whom he had been together for nine years.[21][22] Their daughter Fenna was born in July 2011. Van Buuren announced just hours before he was due to headline the main stage at Tomorrowland (Saturday, 27 July 2013) that his wife had given birth to a son, Remy.[23]\n\nIn 2011, Van Buuren was appointed Officer of the Order of Orange Nassau for his services to music.[24]\n\nCareer[edit]\n\n1995–99: Early career and success[edit]\n\nIn 1995, Van Buuren had his first major success with a track called \"Blue Fear\", which was released under the Cyber Records label; he was 19 years old. This track, which was produced in the Eurodancemould, made it onto the UK Chart. Another successful track, \"Communication\" was released under the same label, and became popular in Ibiza, Spain in the summer of 1999. After being signed to AM PM Records, this track entered the UK Chart at No. 18 in 2000.\n\nVan Buuren began his DJ career at club Nexus in Leiden, where he learned to play long DJ sets, which were regularly six to seven hours per set. During school holidays he played more than four times a week. In 1999, he met Dave Lewis who introduced him as a DJ in England and the United States.[25] His career accelerated, entering the DJ Magazine Top-100 in November 2001 at Number 27.[25] He has played in more than 25 countries and can often be found on the main stage at big summer festivals. Van Buuren played a record-breaking twelve and a half-hour set for Dancetheater in The Hague, Netherlands.[26][27] In the United Kingdom, he performs regularly at Passion (resident 2002),Godskitchen, Gatecrasher, Slinky, Ministry of Sound, Peach and Golden.\n\nIn the beginning of 1999, Van Buuren started his label Armind together with United Recordings. The first release, Gig – \"One\", was well received. The second release \"Touch Me,\" under the name Rising Star was signed to Ministry of Sound in the UK, before the record was released.\n\nBy the time of his third release, Gimmick – \"Free\" was signed to R&S Records, his label was popular. Under the pseudonym Gaia he released \"4 Elements\" on Captivating Sounds, a sub-label of Warner Brothers. Teaming up with Tiësto, two new projects were born: Major League – \"Wonder Where You Are?\" was released on Black Hole Recordings and Alibi – \"Eternity\" was released on Armind. \"Eternity\" received club and chart success and was signed to Paul van Dyk's imprint Vandit Records. Another major collaboration followed this. Together with Ferry Corsten, Van Buuren recorded a riff titled \"Exhale\" for the System F. album. Released as a single, this track reached gold status in less than a month.\n\n2000–04: A State of Trance and 76[edit]\n\nIn 2000, Van Buuren started his own Armin van Buuren compilation series. He found a balance between proper progressive house, and vocal trance music styles. His first compilation album, A State of Trance (not to be confused with his weekly A State of Trance radio shows), sold 10,000 copies and contains Van Buuren's remix of Moogwai, \"Viola\". His second album, Basic Instinct featured a new track: \"Perpetuous Dreamer\" – \"The Sound of Goodbye\". This track entered the Dutch charts in June 2001 at number 26. Later in the year, the track hit No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The third album, In Motion was released 6 August 2001. A fourth album, Transparence, followed in 2002.

His show and the artists he features are popularized by publishing the artists and track titles on his website. When ID&T Radio changed genres in 2004, Van Buuren left and took A State of Trance with him. The show then moved to Fresh FM and later SLAM!FM, two Dutch radio stations. It is now a weekly feature on Radio 538, the Dutch marketleading radio station, DI.FM, an online radio station, and on XM Satellite Radio, channel 80 in the United States and Canada.
