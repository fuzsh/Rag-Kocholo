        "text": "Article Cleanup\n\nThis article requires a cleanup to meet The Sims Wiki's quality standards.\n\nReason: The list is incomplete; either make each list complete or only partial. List format of each game series is inconsistent.\n\nPlease improve this article if you can.\n\nFor other articles on music, see Music (disambiguation).\n\nTo give more realism and promote celebrities, the producers added Simlish songs (most of which are actual songs). They are present throughout The Sims series. Here are the following games and the songs.\n\nThe Sims[]\n\nIn The Sims: House Party, Sims sat around a campfire may sing Simlish versions of \"She'll be coming 'round the mountain\", \"On top of Old Smokey\", and \"Michael Row the Boat Ashore\".\n\nSome of the music for The Sims: Unleashed was composed by Zydeco Flames. While many of the songs are original compositions made for the expansion, one of the songs is a Simlish version of one of the group's existing songs.\n\nThe Sims: Superstar features different songs that can be performed by Sims in the Fame career, either live or for a music video shooting. The dance song featured in the game is Glabe Glarn, a noticeably Auto-Tuned eurodance song. There are two Sims in The Sims 2 that are named after the song: Glabe Curious and Glarn Curious. The other songs are Thonsivee (pop ballad), Frettesche (rock), Stambadoo (country), Chebadoo (big band). Special versions of these songs were made available by Maxis as a free download in the game soundtrack .\n\nThe Urbz[]\n\nThe music heard in The Urbz: Sims in the City (console), featured original as well as Simlish covers by the The Black Eyed Peas, who were celebrity NPCs. The Urbz console soundtrack was released digitally on Last.fm as an album for download in March 2007. However, due to licensing issues the music done by BEP was not present.[1][2]\n\nThis is a list of Urbz songs featured on the official soundtrack, in order as the are officially listed.\n\nArtist Song District John Cobbett \"Na Na Lae\" Gasoline Row Rod Abernathy \"High Nrg\" Neon East John Cobbett \"Melinka\" Central Station Rod Abernathy \"Downjazz\" South Side Bridge Jacen Touchstone \"Glowstick Juice\" Neon East John Cobbett \"Dee Bamow\" Kicktail Park John Cobbett \"Gofuork!

The station \"BEP-d Beat\" featured a number of songs by BEP.\n\nArtist Song District Black Eyed Peas \"Friddy Dope\" Cozmo Street/ Skyline Beach Black Eyed Peas \"Jaba Dew Wah\" Skyline Beach/ Intro Black Eyed Peas \"Let's Go\" Cozmo Street Black Eyed Peas \"Steppin\" Cozmo Street Black Eyed Peas \"Shut Uprah\" Skyline Beach Black Eyed Peas \"Peace With Love\" Cozmo Street Black Eyed Peas \"Games\" SkyLine Beach Black Eyed Peas \"Countdown\" Cozmo Street Black Eyed Peas \"Ga Ra Ta Da\"[note 1] Intro\n\nThe Sims 2[]\n\nThe Sims 2 soundtrack music was set up by Maxis' audio director Robi Kauker, with composers like The Humble Brothers or John Cobbett. The music took about a year to record and was restricted from being repetitive. Kauker says, \"Diehard Sim fans spend virtual lifetimes playing, so the music can't be repetitive.\"[3]\n\nThe theme music and music from the Create-A-Sim portion of the game was created by Mark Mothersbaugh, a founding member of Devo, whom Maxis enlisted.[3]\n\nMusic from The Sims 2 and The Sims 2: University was remixed by real DJs in The Sims 2: Nightlife.[3]\n\nUniversity[4][]\n\nAll songs are on the new College Rock station. This expansion also added the Jazz station. Since the music on that station is purely instrumental, it is not listed here.\n\nArtist Song Station Abra Moore \"Big Sky\" College Rock Acceptance \"This Conversation Is Over\" College Rock Charlotte Martin \"Beautiful Life\" College Rock Dexter Freebish \"Pretty People\" College Rock Go Betty Go \"Very Very Rich Town\" College Rock Steadman \"Come On\" College Rock The Daylights \"Outsider\" College Rock The Perishers \"Sway\" College Rock\n\nOpen for Business[5][6][]\n\nAll songs are on the new New Wave station.
