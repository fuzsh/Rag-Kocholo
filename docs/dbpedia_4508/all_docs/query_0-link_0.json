Krezip was a Dutch band from Tilburg, formed in 1997 and consisting of Jacqueline Govaert on vocals, Anne Govaert and Annelies Kuijsters on guitar, Joost van Haaren on bass guitar and Thijs Romeijn on drums. The band has had several successful albums and singles in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. The origin of their name remains unclear, though a popular explanation is that the name is an anagram of perzik, the Dutch word for peach. The band gained exposure after their show at the Dutch Pinkpop festival, with the ballad I Would Stay being received exceptionally well. I Would Stay became a #1 hit in Belgium and #2 in the Netherlands. It was the #1 song of 2000 in Belgium. In 2008, Krezip's breakthrough single I Would Stay was given a one-time-only people's choice based award for 'all-time best Dutch single', by Dutch national radio station 3FM. In the same year, Krezip announced their break-up, at the peak of their success. Their last hit single Sweet Goodbyes stayed in the top of the charts for 25 weeks. During their 11 active years they gained enormous success and released over 20 singles. The best hit singles are featured on this compilation. All the way from their 2000 debut single Won't Cry until the 2008 hit Sweet Goodbyes. Best Of Krezip was originally released in 2008, reached the top of the Dutch charts and remained in the charts for over a year. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of this compilation, Best Of Krezip is now available on vinyl for the first time.\n\nSatisfaction Guarantee* 30-day returns & exchanges\n\nDetails\n\nTrack List\n\nPlug It in & Turn Me on , Go to Sleep , I Would Stay , Won't Cry , Play This Game with Me , All My Life , Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime , You Can Say , Play This Game with Me , All My Life 1 Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime 1, You Can Say 1, In Her Sun (Stupid) 1, That'll Be Me 1, Everything and More 1, Let's Take It Slow 1, Sweet Goodbyes\n\n*See our return policy for details."
