Krezip's members formed a cover band while in high school, and were still remarkably young when they broke through, playing all original songs, at the nationally televised Pinkpop festival in 2000.\n\nThe band has since had several successful albums and numerous hit singles in the Netherlands, as well as live success, playing at festivals in Belgium and Germany. The band has four consistent core members, centered around lead singer and songwriter Jacqueline Govaert.\n\nIn 2008, Krezip's breakthrough single \"I Would Stay\" received a once-only, people's choice award for \"All-time best Dutch single\" from the Dutch national radio station 3FM.[1]\n\nIn 2008, Krezip again made headlines in the Netherlands, announcing they would break up in 2009, at an average age of just 27, after being active for twelve years. In 2009, they played at the prominent Pinkpop festival again before their official farewell concerts."
