        "text": "On the Cloudmachine YouTube-channel we’ve posted 2 new clips that were filmed in the spring for the festivities around the 10 year anniversary of Dutch Indie music station 3VOOR12. Richard and Ruud performed Big Love and Safe Haven acoustically.\n\nThe last few days we’ve spent recording vocals for the new album. Marco en Ruud stayed at a friends house with lovely recording facilities, in the countryside. Next Sunday we will be recording some exclusive electric piano sounds at Oscar Holleman’s(Krezip/Within Temptation/My Favorite Scar) studio. Almost done recording, then: mixing! To be continued.\n\nToday, Tuesday 9 September we’ve brought our engineer back to the airport. We’ve spent 12 intense days at the E-Sound Studio’s in Weesp, The Netherlands. A vintage studio with great acoustics, lots of 60-ies mics and a wonderful old mixing desk. It was a fruitful collaboration, one we’d planned carefully and everything went like clockwork. Next weekend we’ll start working on recording the vocals. The 24th we’ll get on a plane to the USA to do the mixing. To be continued!\n\nAt the end of August the respected sound engineer we are looking forward to record the new album with, will arrive at Schiphol Airport. He will be our guest for about 12 days and we’ll be working in a studio near Amsterdam. At the end of September Marco and Ruud will depart for San Francisco to mix the album with the same man in his favorite and legendary studio in Northern California . We’re a bit secretive about it to tease you a little bit. All flights and studio’s have been booked. Keep you posted.\n\nSanta Cruz probably makes the best sounding acoustic guitars in the world at the moment. Many famous names are on the players list, on the website of the brand. It’s nice to notice Cloudmachine is on that list aswell (at the bottom of the H section).\n\nCurrently we’re preparing for the recording of the new album. This means : rehearsals, finding guest musicians (strings and brass), fine tuning the arrangements, orchestrate the string and brass parts (where would we be without Marco…), finding extra gear and instruments to broaden our sound palet, travel planning, align all agenda’s, book studio’s, arrange catering,, worry about money, getting excited, and not forgetting things. So, everybody’s celebrating summer, and we’re working!\n\nMy Little Phoenix is the name of the song Ruud and Michiel wrote for Tarja Turunen, former singer of Finnish gothic act Nightwish. The album My Winter Storm, her first solo album, is doing very well internationally. There already were platinum sales in Finland and gold in Russia. Now there are also gold awards in the Czech Republic and Hungary. In Germany the sales are also heading towards gold. The album was released in over 70 countries.\n\nAt this time there are 3 new video’s online of live performances on YouTube and LastFM. Multi media expert Thijs Vrij filmed a complete show in the Parktheater this spring and we’ve uploaded some brand new songs for you.\n\nThe last few months we’ve been working on songs just about every second we could. But now there’s serious progress towards recording the 3rd album. We’ve booked a studio for 10 days, late August. After a short break we will then follow up with a mixing session. There’s nice and very special stuff going on. We’ll keep you posted the coming months.\n\nSaturday May 31st Cloudmachine will pay popular regional radio station Haarlem 105 FM a visit. The item will start appr. 11:30 a.m. GMT and can be heard live via the stations website. The band will be interviewed (dutch, sorry) and wil perform a few songs acoustically."
