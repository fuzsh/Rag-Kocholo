        "text": "The following is an excerpt from an interview with AFTER FOREVER vocalist Floor Jansen translated from Dutch. It appears at the band's fan forum and focuses on Jansen's career as a vocalist:\n\nQ: The Lowlands show was pretty good. It's surprising, too, to hear you sing in Dutch.\n\nJansen: \"Thanks. It was a a nice project, anyway. Beatles songs were sang by the singers of famous Dutch bands such as THE SHEER, RANCID and KREZIP. I really enjoyed being a part of it. I was surprised at the tremendously full marquee, though - that took some getting used to.\"\n\nQ: Was it a preview of you post-After Forever plans? Light music and musicals?\n\nJansen: \"No, no, no. I'm a musician with a wide scope of interests. After Forever is really my number one passion, but I didn't study classical song and musical theater for nothing. I wouldn't just want to do theater. And post-After Forever? Well, rock, metal, pop, musical, everything is possible.\"\n\nQ: You've also studied at the Rock Academie (Dutch pop/rock music school), as one of the first students I think. Would you recommend it?\n\nJansen: \"I was indeed among the first students. Jaqueline from Krezip was my classmate. I can't really tell what it's like now. We were the guinea pigs, really, there were still some flaws. Can I recommend it? Well, critics say it doesn't teach you anything that experience won't. That may be true, but it has done a lot for me. You learn a lot business-wise, you build a network, you get better technically. I did want to widen my scope as far as singing is concerned. That's why I went to the Tilburg Conservatory, to study musical theater.\"\n\nQ : How do the people at the conservatory react to your band performances?\n\nJansen: \"Really good, actually. Our music is very theatrical, melodic and musical as well. They like my voice. They generally like the grunts less, but musical theater people do understand that it adds emotion.\"\n\nQ : And how about the loud music at shows? Did your teachers warn you a lot?\n\nJansen: \"Actually, I realized I had to be careful myself pretty soon. Singing is my passion, what I'm good at, but you do need ears for that. I started using an in-ear monitor system early on. I'm always amazed at how little musicians care for their hearing. If I'd go to a concert without earplugs myself, I'd go mad. It's really stupid not to do anything about it. Hah, put that in your story!\"\n\nQ : So Lowlands was a bit of an outing. You're really busy with After Forever now.\n\nJansen: \"Yes, we're rehearsing the new After Forever album, our fifth. We're going to record it in the Rooftop Studio with producer Gordon Groothedde! He's worked with Sheer and Intwine before, among others, and he'd like to produce a real heavy band.\"\n\nQ: What do you expect of the 'sound' of the CD, with this producer?\n\nJansen: \"I think we can present all our potential in one package, now.\"\n\nQ: How do you mean?\n\nJansen: \"Well, we've obviously shown very different sides of ourselves in the previous four CDs. Heavy tracks and melodic, more quiet work. You'll hear all those elements on the new album. We're exploring the boundaries. We're showing the extremes in a new package.\"\n\nQ: And the album title?\n\nJansen: \"I won't tell you, we're not making that public yet. It'll probably be out in spring 2007. You'll have to wait a bit.\""
