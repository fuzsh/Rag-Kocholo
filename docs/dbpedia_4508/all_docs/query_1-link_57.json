        "text": "Q: Analog or digital and why?\n\nA: Both. For different things. The recallability with digital is a must these days as recalling analog is too time consuming for modern mixing processes. On the other hand it can be quicker to reach a certain sound with analog. Especially in the recording stages. When mixing, I use analog processing as a “flavour” on the mix bus and on other tracks and buses sometimes. Not because it’s better necessarily, just a different sound that I may not be able to get \"in the box\" at the time. For me, one is not better than the other, just different, and a great mix can be accomplished with just digital, just analog or any combination of both.\n\nQ: What's the biggest misconception about what you do?\n\nA: Not everybody understands that mixing is very much part of the production process and therefore communication between the producer and the mixing engineer is an integral part of the mixing-process.\n\nQ: What questions do you ask prospective clients?\n\nA: What is your vision and what is the vibe we should be aiming for with your song? Do you have specific artists or songs in mind as references and inspiration for the mix? What should I feel when I listen to the song?\n\nQ: What do you like most about your job?\n\nA: Getting to work with so many talented artist is a true blessing. And mixing is such a rewarding process - it’s like a new little puzzle to solve with every song so it never gets boring either. I can honestly say that I have fun every day doing this.\n\nQ: What advice do you have for a customer looking to hire a provider like you?\n\nA: Great results are often a team effort, so make sure you surround yourself with others who excel at their role in the process.\n\nQ: What was your career path? How long have you been doing this?\n\nA: I started off as recording engineer at a music publishing companys studio, recording demos for prospective artists. Then I basically went from there to professional producer, and for the past ten years I'm also/mostly a professional mixing engineer.\n\nQ: What type of music do you usually work on?\n\nA: Mainly contemporary pop music across all sub-genres. But I also mix everything from jazz to rock and singer songwriter tracks.\n\nQ: What's your strongest skill?\n\nA: I think it’s my ability to balance vibe with the technical aspects of an accomplished, radio ready and professional sounding mix.\n\nQ: What do you bring to a song?\n\nA: Dedication and experience. Both as a mixing engineer and as a producer/musician.\n\nQ: What's your typical work process?\n\nA: If one is provided,I like to start with listening to the rough mix for a couple of times. Then I’ll ask the client about their vision of the mix and if they have any reference tracks from other artists that I should keep in mind while working on their song. When I feel that I fully understand the clients vision and needs, I will get to work. And once I have a mix that I think is getting very close to what the client wants I will send it out to them for feedback and start the revision process. And I will work until everyone involved are absolutely amazed by the results.\n\nQ: Tell us about your studio setup.\n\nA: Working in a digital/analog hybrid setup, I have a professionally, acoustically treated studio that I’ve had the fortune to design from the ground up together with professionals studio designers/acousticians. The studio is based around Antelope Audio converters and clocking for pristine AD/DA conversion, which gives me great detail when monitoring and going through outboard gear, as well as when going back in to the box. I’ve been a Logic user for more than 20 years and love how it’s become an extension of my mind so I don’t consciously need to think about what I’m doing, it just happens intuitively and I can focus on listening to what I’m working on. For the same reason I also use controllers to control the mixer and plugins in Logic so I can mix with my ears and be less distracted by mousing around on the screen.\n\nQ: What other musicians or music production professionals inspire you?\n\nA: There are many, but to mention a few, Manny Marroquin, Tony Maserati and Jaycen Joshua are very inspiring mixing engineers. Regarding producers and artists in general, there are so many good ones out there. So I would say most artists/producers who dedicate themselves fully to music are a big inspiration - regardless if they are super successful or not.\n\nQ: Describe the most common type of work you do for your clients.\n\nA: Mainly mixing, but also mastering and sometimes additional production to help nail the song and mix. Usually I work across a wide range of genres but my most prominent credits and awards are in the wider contemporary pop-genre including electronic, dance, singer songwriter, indie and many other sub-styles."
