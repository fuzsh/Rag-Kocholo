        "text": "A chart-topping adult alternative group in their native Netherlands, Krezip is led by singer, songwriter, and pianist Jacqueline Govaert. The band made their debut at number one at home with their second full-length, 2000's Nothing Less, before repeating the feat with their next two albums, 2002's Days Like This and 2005's What Are You Waiting For. Though they temporarily disbanded in 2009, Krezip returned ten years later with their sixth long-player, Sweet High. It went to number two in 2019. Formed in Tilburg in 1997 while members were still in secondary school, Krezip was started by Jacqueline Govaert, guitarists Anne Govaert and Annelies Kuijsters, bass player Joost van Haaren, and drummer Thijs Romeijn. They built a fan base with slots at a number of festivals but remained unsigned until 2000. In the meantime, they issued an album of demo material, Run Around, in 1999. Warner soon came calling and released the group's second official single, \"I Would Stay,\" in 2000. Their breakout hit, it went to number one in Belgium while stalling at number two on the Dutch singles chart. The accompanying album, Nothing Less, went to the top of the chart in both countries. Featuring two Top 20 singles (\"You Can Say\" and \"Promise\"), 2002's Days Like This also peaked at number one in the Netherlands, reaching number 13 in Belgium. It saw Kuijsters move to keyboards to make room for Thomas Holthuis on guitar. The concert album-video package That'll Be Unplugged (And More) followed on Warner in 2003 before the label decided not to renew its contract with the band. Holthuis and Romeijn left the group, and Bram van den Berg took over drums in time for Krezip to eventually sign with Sony BMG. The label issued what proved to be the group's third straight Dutch number one, What Are You Waiting For, in 2005. It included the Top Ten hit \"Out of My Bed.\" That same year, the band's song \"Same Mistake\" was featured in the romantic comedy Het Schnitzelparadijs, the highest-grossing film of 2005 in the Netherlands. Krezip delivered another Top Ten single, \"All My Life,\" in 2007, from the same year's Plug It In. It peaked at number three on the Dutch album chart. The original song \"Sweet Goodbyes\" from late 2008's Best of Krezip reached number two on the singles chart the following year, while the collection went all the way to number one. Claiming that they wanted to go out on top, the group played two farewell shows at Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam in June 2009. The final concert was captured on Sweet Goodbyes, issued just a few weeks later by Sony. Jacqueline Govaert then embarked on a successful solo career, releasing a trio of Top Ten albums between 2010 and 2017, including the chart-topping Songs to Soothe (2014). After a decade apart, word arrived in early 2019 that Krezip would reunite for a performance at that June's Pinkpop Festival. In addition, they debuted a song, \"Lost Without You,\" on the talk show De Wereld Draait Door. Another album eventually followed before the end of the year. Titled Sweet High, it reached as high as number two in the Netherlands. Krezip returned in 2021 with the original song \"You Are Not Alone.\"\n\n&copy Marcy Donelson & Chris True /TiVo"
