Peter Krause and Lauren Graham were playing siblings on "Parenthood" when they began dating in 2010. They broke up in 2022.

Krause and Graham played Adam and Sarah Braverman, respectively, on NBC's "Parenthood" from 2010 to 2015, and during that time, they began dating.

"We couldn't stop talking," Graham told Good Housekeeping in 2016. "Not about ourselves, but about the world and books and family. Once we got together, there was no game play. It was like, 'You like me, and I like you.' It gave me an understanding of life: This is how things happen, and it's completely random."

In June 2022, it was reported they'd "quietly" broken up the year prior after more than 10 years together.

Jennifer Carpenter and Michael C. Hall were married (and divorced) while they played siblings in "Dexter."

Hall played the titular character in "Dexter," a serial killer with a code, while Carpenter played Deb, his foul-mouthed adopted sister. The two went through many stages in their relationship, but their bond was the heart of the show.

In real life, Hall and Carpenter started dating in 2007, tied the knot in 2008, and announced their divorce in December 2010. However, they kept working together for another three years, until "Dexter" aired its finale in 2013.

They even reunited in 2021 to once again play the Morgan siblings (albeit with Carpenter playing a ghost) for "Dexter: New Blood."

Rita Wilson briefly played her husband Tom Hanks' sister in "Sleepless in Seattle."

Hanks and Wilson had been married for five years when Wilson made, essentially, an extended cameo as Hanks' character Sam's sister, Suzy, in "Sleepless in Seattle." The two are still married today, and are one of Hollywood's longest-lasting couples.

We actually have Wilson to thank for Hanks' appearances in rom-com staples "Sleepless in Seattle" and "You've Got Mail" — Wilson introduced Hanks to writer/director Nora Ephron, according to a memorial he wrote for Ephron.

In "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," Matthew Broderick and Jennifer Grey played antagonistic siblings, but in real life, they were in love.

Broderick played Ferris, the epitome of a cool kid, while Grey played his sour older sister Jeanie, who only wanted to catch Ferris in his lies in the 1986 classic.

"I was as surprised as anyone when our relationship morphed from on-screen sibling rivalry to off-screen illicit romance," she wrote in her 2022 memoir, "Out of the Corner."

Their relationship was revealed to the world in August 1987 when, while driving together on vacation in Ireland, the two were involved in a serious car crash that left two people dead.

The pair were briefly engaged in 1988 but split up soon after.

Chris Pratt and Emily VanCamp fell in love while playing siblings on teen drama "Everwood."

Pratt and VanCamp both got their start on "Everwood," a teen drama that aired on the WB from 2002 to 2006. In it, VanCamp played Amy Abbott, while Pratt played her older brother Bright. The pair ended up dating for a couple of years.

Pratt spoke about their relationship to TV Guide, right after the show ended. "We've pretty much gotten used to the response of, 'Eww, that's weird. That's creepy.' The people who know us are happy, and probably expected it to happen eventually. But yeah, every once in a while we get that one person that's like, 'That's really creepy. You just kissed your sister,'" Pratt joked.

"It never really weirded us out that we played brother and sister, because, you know, it's all fiction."

Maureen McCormick and Barry Williams played step-siblings on "The Brady Bunch," but "couldn't keep their hands off each other" off-screen.

McCormick and Williams played Marcia and Greg Brady for all five seasons of "The Brady Bunch," from 1969 to 1974. Towards the end of the show's run, McCormick and Williams developed feelings for each other, as teenagers are wont to do.

McCormick wrote in her book, "Here's the Story: Surviving Marcia Brady and Finding My True Voice," that even she was creeped out sometimes to be kissing her brother, writing, "Oh my God! I'm kissing my brother. What am I doing?'

She wrote that their first kiss took place during the cast's trip to Hawaii in season four. But, she said, their relationship was an "on-and-off-again game," and they never officially became boyfriend and girlfriend.

Shannen Doherty and Jason Priestley played the Walsh twins in "Beverly Hills, 90210," but their real relationship was more like Brenda and Dylan.

Doherty played the rebellious Brenda Walsh for the first four seasons of the show before being written off, while Priestley played the more popular Brandon during seasons one through nine (he was shown in archival footage for the 10th and final season in 2000).

In his book, "Jason Priestley: A Memoir," Priestley shared that "Various combinations of people slept with each other over the years. Nobody ever got attached. We never let it get in the way of what we were doing. I will let you know that nobody ever got — work always superseded everything."

Even if their relationship wasn't serious, we'll always have these photos of them making out on the 1991 Emmys red carpet to look back on.

Ian Somerhalder and Maggie Grace played step-siblings with crushes on each other in "Lost," and those crushes translated off-screen.

The two played step-siblings Boone and Shannon during "Lost's" first two seasons, with Boone's death at the end of season one being one of the most shocking moments of the show. Throughout the course of the season, it gradually was revealed that Boone was into his step-sister, and she took advantage of those feelings rather frequently.

In real life, the two dated for around a year, from 2006 to 2007, a year after Somerhalder's character was killed off.

"Ian and I are still very good friends," Grace said in 2015.

Amy Poehler and Will Arnett were already married when they played incestuous siblings in "Blades of Glory."

Poehler and Arnett, who were married from 2003 to 2016, co-starred in 2007's "Blades of Glory" as the ice-skating Van Waldenberg siblings, the villains of the film. The two clearly have a vibe throughout the film, but it all comes to a head at the end of the film when they kiss.

Kirstie Alley and Parker Stevenson were already married when they played siblings in the Civil War miniseries "North and South."

Alley and Stevenson were married from 1983 to 1997, but the two had been together for even longer before tying the knot.

While they were married, Alley began starring in the historical miniseries "North and South," which released its first installment in 1985. She played Virgilia Hazard, the sister of main character George Hazard. There was another Hazard sibling, Billy, who was played by John Stockwell in the first season.

When season two returned in 1986, Billy had been recast and was played by Alley's husband, Stevenson.

According to Alley, at the time, she was also falling in love with her other "North and South" costar, Patrick Swayze. "We did not have an affair," she said. "But again, I think what I did was worse. Because I think when you fall in love with someone when you're married, you jeopardize your own marriage and their marriage. It's doubly bad," as per The Hollywood Reporter.
