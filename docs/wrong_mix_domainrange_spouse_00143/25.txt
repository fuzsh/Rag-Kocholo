Michael C. Hall picked a very special occasion to introduce his new girlfriend, Morgan Macgregor, to the world!

The Dexter actor, 41, brought the tattooed blonde book critic to the 64th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards at the Nokia Theatre in L.A. September 23. The couple held hands on the red carpet and packed on the PDA once they got inside. "They're totally together and cute," an onlooker tells Us Weekly.

According to Macgregor's official website, she "likes public radio, lattes and doing her makeup in public." She's also "working on a novel and plans to open a bookstore called Dead or Alive."

Hall, who suited up in Paul Smith, was married to his Dexter costar Jennifer Carpenter, 32, from 2008 to 2011. Though they were spotted looking cozy in February 2012, an insider assured Us the actors "are just good friends. Their divorce was the most amicable in the world."

Indeed, during a 2011 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Carpenter admitted Hall will always have a place in her heart. "He is and always will be one of my best friends in the world," said the actress, who helped nurse Hall through a battle with lymphoma. "And just because the marriage ended doesn't mean the love isn't still there."
