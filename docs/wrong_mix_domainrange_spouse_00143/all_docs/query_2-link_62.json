        "text": "Actor, author, and woodworker Nick Offerman paid his fifth visit to Late Night with Seth Meyers on October 5, promoting his latest book, Where the Deer and the Antelope Play.\n\n\"You're giving off a very 'author' vibe,\" Host Seth Meyers told Offerman, who looked dapper in a three-piece suit and red and white plaid tie. Meyers also noted that Offerman was clean shaven (many fans might be used to seeing him with a beard, as he was in his guest role on The Last of Us).\n\n\"I am,\" Offerman confirmed. \"After 23 years, Megan Mullally and myself—Megan Mullally? hold for applause,\" he said, as the audience clapped.\n\n\"I hope for all of you that you find a partner that, when you say her name, people applaud like you won an Olympic event,\" Offerman told Meyers.\n\nNick Offerman tells Meyers that Megan Mullally Asked Him to Shave\n\nOfferman broke down the reason why his beard is gone. \"After 23 years, Megan Mullally said to me, 'I've had enough of a mouth full of thistles when we're making sweet love—and otherwise, other times than every Tuesday,'\" he joked. \"And so she asked me to be clean shaven, and I said, 'I will. I want to stay married to you.'\"\n\nOfferman said that he was \"pretty cool with it\"—until he realized that having a shaved beard, \"if you have any Homer Simpson happening,\" your face and neck are completely exposed.\n\n\"Everybody can see the real you,\" Meyers laughed.\n\nHow did Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally meet?\n\nOfferman, who played Ron Swanson on the classic NBC comedy Parks and Recreation and co-hosted the craft competition series Making It with Amy Poehler, has been married to Will & Grace star Mullally since 2003. As the two detailed in the 2018 dual memoir about their relationship, The Greatest Love Story Ever Told: An Oral History, Mullally met Offerman in 2000 when they cast in a play.\n\nRELATED: Watch Seth Meyers' Supersized \"A Closer Look: To the Max\""
