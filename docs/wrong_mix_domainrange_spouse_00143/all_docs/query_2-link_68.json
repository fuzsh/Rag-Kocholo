The couple were first linked by fans in 2019, but speculation about their relationship didn't start heating up until 2020. Shortly after the pair first went public, Viall admitted in February 2021 that they met after Joy slid into his Instagram DMs. \"It was very romantic,\" he joked during an episode of his podcast. “We kind of kept hanging out, and she finally got to a point where she was like, ‘I want to date,’ and I was kind of like, ‘I don’t know.’ … She just was like, ‘OK, this is what I want. It’s fine, no big deal, but I’m gonna go do my thing,’ and she did, and I was like, ‘What?!’ … She went and showed me exactly what I’d be missing.” A source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that the pair's relationship is \"very real,\" adding, \"They're pretty much inseparable. You can say she practically lives with him because she's at his house that much.\" [sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"APAUaIMt2K-2841577-14453\"] Viall and Joy announced their engagement via social media in January 2023, followed by another milestone that summer: Joy's pregnancy. Their daughter, River Rose, was born in February 2024.

And I'm like, 'Listen, you seem great, but I literally don't date anyone in Bachelor Nation.'\"\n\nCredit: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nJoy gushed about Viall on his 41st birthday in September 2021.\n\n“This man!!!! you are one of the best ones and anyone who’s met you knows it too. I am so lucky to not only share this life with you but to love you, and to be loved by you,” she gushed. “You flipped my whole world upside down and given every dream and goal a new meaning and purpose. your sense of humor, honesty, generosity, talent, creativity, drive, heart and passion just blows my mind. cherishing your existence forever!! you tear every single fariytale [SIC] to shreds. happy birthday baby i love you like nothing else!!”\n\nIn the comments section, Viall thanked his love, writing, “Thanks for liking me. Love you ❤️❤️.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Nick Viall/Instagram\n\nJuly 2022\n\nDuring an episode of \"The Viall Files\" podcast, Joy defended her boyfriend in response to Katie Thurston's comments about him.\n\n\"It really got me when I get tagged in a cute little TikTok reel on Instagram of Ms. Katie Thurston speaking about Nick. I watch it and I was just very confused because [it starts off] with someone asking, 'Why does Nick Viall hate you?' And she says, 'Nick Viall is blocked from my phone.' Like she has some sort of reason to block Nick,\" the model explained at the time. \"I know for a fact that Nick has only ever tried to help her and give her advice. Which she has never taken.\"\n\nThe Maryland native added: \"I think she is platforming a lie, and I think we need to show the truth.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy Nick Viall/Instagram\n\nAugust 2022\n\n\"I'm very grateful for the relationship I have with Natalie,\" the podcaster exclusively told Us, noting that he didn't feel pressured to pop the question. \"[I'm] really excited [about] the direction it's going and the pace in which it's going. We often talk about, you know, our future together and our relationship and, you know, I'm not trying to [rush]. I don't think either of us [is] trying to get ahead of ourselves, but we're definitely grateful for the direction it's going. ... Stay tuned.\"\n\nCredit: Image Press Agency/NurPhoto/Shutterstock\n\nJanuary 2023\n\n\"We're definitely anxious to get married,\" the former reality star told E! News. \"We definitely didn't get engaged to have a long engagement, so it's been great. It's exciting.\"\n\nThe soon-to-be husband and wife were already looking into making arrangements for their big day. \"Last night, we just started talking about how we should start making a list,\" he explained. \"Everyone tells us, 'You've got to find the venue.' For me, it's an excitement level, but I've been told that if you can find that, it gets a lot easier. But that's the big hurdle. So now I'm excited to figure that out. It is intimidating.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Nick Viall/Instagram\n\nMay 2023\n\nThe former reality star recalled during an appearance on “The Squeeze” podcast that he was hesitant to date Joy due to their 18-year age gap. \"We started messaging [online], and I carded her,\" Viall confessed. “I wanted to make sure she was a real person.”\n\nHe explained: \"The age at the time, I was very self-conscious about. I was very guarded.”\n\nJoy, for her part, was confident about the relationship from their first in-person meeting, which took place in New York City. “I knew after that weekend, I was like, ‘I’m going to spend the rest of my life with this man.’ And I knew it and he didn’t,” she told listeners. “So I was like, ‘I’m just going to hang on because he’ll come around.’ So I asked him several times to date me.”"
