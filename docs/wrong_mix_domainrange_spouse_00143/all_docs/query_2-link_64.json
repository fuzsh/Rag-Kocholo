        "text": "From their humble beginnings as a summer 2018 romance to their elaborate wedding celebrations, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas have become a major celebrity power couple. Here, relive their Met Gala meeting, Chopra's latest emotional birthday montage, and every moment in between. Plus, see the heartfelt messages they penned for the second anniversary of their first date.\n\n2016\n\nIt was revealed in a December 2018 Vogue cover story that Jonas made the first move via Twitter DM on September 8, 2016. \"I'm hearing from a few mutual friends that we should meet,\" he wrote to Chopra. She responded, 'My team can read this. Why don't you just text me,' along with her phone number.\n\nThe future couple would text for several months, although Chopra admits she had never allowed her relationships to go public before. But when it came to Jonas, she told Vogue she thought, \"What is happening? I've not known myself like this.\" Jonas had been previously linked to Olivia Culpo and Miley Cyrus.\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nIn the same Vogue interview, the pair remembers reconnecting at the 2017 Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. Jonas recalls that when he saw Chopra walk into the room, he put his drink down and got on one knee to say (in front of a crowd), \"You're real. Where have you been all my life?'\"\n\nMay 2017\n\nMonths later, Ralph Lauren coincidentally invited both Jonas and Chopra to attend the Met Gala in his designs. A week before the event, Jonas and Chopra grabbed a drink together at the Carlyle Hotel. She also invited Jonas to her apartment for a night that ended not with a kiss, but a platonic back pat. However, Joe Jonas told Vogue that after the Met Gala and its afterparties Chopra \"kind of knocked him off his feet. He was just this little puppy dog.\"\n\nLater that month, Chopra told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live that while she wouldn't rule out a future flirtation with Jonas, the two were just friends.\n\nMay 2018\n\nA whole year later, a source told Us Weekly that the pair was dating. \"They are dating and it's brand new,\" the insider said. \"It's a good match and they are both interested in each other.\" This news was solidified over Memorial Day weekend, where the duo saw Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl, attended a Dodgers game, and were spotted on a friend’s boat. Another source told People, \"They're flirtatious and have been hanging out and text all the time,\" although their relationship is \"very casual.\" However, fans noted that Chopra and Jonas had been liking each other's Instagram posts for months prior.\n\nJune 2018\n\nJonas commented, \"That smile ❤️\" on an Instagram of Chopra. \"Burgers and Chanel...my favourite combo with my fav girls,\" she captioned a meal at In-N-Out.\n\nChopra soon began commenting on Jonas's posts. On a photo of the musician posing with a koala bear at an Australian zoo, she wrote, \"Who is cuter?\"\n\nNext, the potential couple was spotted at JFK airport for a trip where Chopra reportedly met Jonas's parents in New Jersey. \"It's a huge deal that Nick brought Priyanka to his cousin's wedding,\" a source close to the couple told People. \"He's dated a lot over the last couple years but it's never been anything serious, so this is a big step.\" The source added, \"Nick and Priyanka really like each other, and his family enjoyed getting to know her as well. She'll fit right in!\"\n\nWeeks after Chopra accompanied Jonas to his cousin’s wedding, the new couple flies to India for a week-long vacation so Jonas can meet Chopra's family. A People source said, \"They're very happy. It's getting serious.\"\n\nDuring the visit, the couple went IG official. Jonas shared a video of Chopra walking toward him across a balcony with the caption,\"Her 😍.\"\n\nNext, the burgeoning couple goes to Brazil where Jonas performs at the VillaMix festival. \"Him 😍,\" Chopra wrote alongside a clip of him onstage.\n\nJuly 2018\n\nAround this time the couple was also spotted wearing matching gold bands, although no engagement was announced just yet. They ware reportedly on display for a Citi biking excursion with Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner through NYC over Fourth of July weekend.\n\nJonas and Chopra went on a double date with Joe, Turner, and Kevin in London's Mayfair. E! reports that the pair could be moving in together soon. \"Priyanka and Nick are still very serious,\" a source told the outlet. \"They have a very healthy relationship and truly are a good pair. Nick has basically been living in Priyanka's New York City apartment with her and they spend a lot of time together. They next step is him permanently moving in, and it has been a discussion.\"\n\nOn July 27, a source close to the couple told People that Jonas and Chopra were engaged in London on her 36th birthday. Jonas later clarified for Vogue that he had shut down a Tiffany & Co. in London to select the ring with his brother a few weeks earlier. He popped the question at midnight after Chopra's birthday while in Crete. \"I got down on one knee, again, and I said: Will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?\" Jonas told the outlet. \"No joke—she took about 45 seconds. Forty-five seconds of silence.\" Finally, the musician said, \"I'm going to put this ring on your finger now unless you have any objections.\"\n\nAround that time, Us Weekly reported that the newly-engaged pair visited newlyweds Prince Harry and Chopra's close friend, Meghan Markle at their country home.\n\nAugust 2018\n\nA couple of weeks after the engagement, a source told People that Jonas and his family were traveling to India to meet Chopra's family. \"Nick has been obsessed with Priyanka since they started dating,\" the source said. \"He obviously thinks she’' beautiful, but he’s also drawn to her intelligence. She has this charisma and energy that draws you to her, and she's fit in so well with his friends and family.\"\n\nE! ran a report that the Jonas family was traveling to India expressly for an engagement party hosted by Chopra's family. \"It's going to be the first time that their families intermingle and get to know each other,\" a source said. The insider alludes to a short engagement by saying, \"Priyanka wants everything to be traditional to respect her family's values, and definitely an Indian wedding. Priyanka and Nick are excited for everyone to meet and to celebrate. Everything is very secretive but guests are expected to head there starting tomorrow. All of the plans are moving quickly and Priyanka and Nick do not want to have a long engagement.\"\n\nOn August 18, Chopra and Jonas finally confirmed their engagement by posting matching photos of them looking into each other's eyes. Chopra's engagement ring was on full display.\n\nChopra captioned her post, \"Taken.. With all my heart and soul..\" \"Future Mrs. Jonas. My heart. My love.\" Jonas captions his.\n\nThey also posted sets of photos from their familial engagement party. Chopra wrote, \"The only way to do this... with Family and God. Thank you all for your wishes and blessings 🙏🏼♥️🎉\" Jonas wrote, \"Prayer, family and loved ones as the foundation to this new chapter. 🇮🇳\" The trip also includes a visit to St. Catherine’s orphanage, which Chopra shares to social media.\n\nFellow husband-and-wife-to-be Joe and Turner each gave well wishes to the couple. Turner posted, \"Wow. First I'm blessed with an incredible future brother-in-law, and now such an beautiful, inside and out, future sister-in-law. I'm so excited to welcome you into the family @priyankachopra. I love you both @nickjonas.\"\n\nJoe wished his younger brother well by writing, \"I couldn't be happier for my brother. Welcome to the family @priyankachopra We love you.\"\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nThe month kicked off with Chopra showcasing her future Instagram Spouse skills with a picture of Jonas posted to Instagram.\n\nThe couple each shared a photo of themselves on a double date with Joe and Sophie at the U.S. Open. \"It’s a #famjam at #usopen,\" Chopra captioned the pic.\n\nThe couple brought it back to the roots of their relationship by attending Ralph Lauren's 50th anniversary celebration during New York Fashion Week. Some even claimed that Chopra and Jonas recreated Meghan and Harry's engagement photos during a similarly posed shot.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jonas admitted his fiancée liked \"Prick\" as their celebrity couple name.\n\nFor Jonas's 26th birthday, Chopra posted a sweet selfie of the couple with the caption, \"Happy birthday baby. 💋❤️@nickjonas.\"\n\nChopra also spent time in September with her future husband's family, sharing several pictures at a ranch from an Oklahoma trip.\n\nOctober 2018\n\nAt the beginning of the month, Chopra posted footage of Jonas playing soccer in Mumbai. \"Bae in Bombae!! 😍\" she captioned the post.\n\nBy mid-October both People and Us Weekly reported that wedding plans are well underway for Jonas and Chopra. \"The wedding is coming soon and they really want to blend wedding traditions from both of their cultures that are important to them,\" said the Us source.\"Priyanka is having a really good time planning the wedding because it's a mix of Indian and American styles and customs, which she knows so much about.\"\n\nBoth Chopra and Jonas's Instagram posts indicated that they were looking towards the future. Jonas posted a picture of himself and Chopra looking out at a sunset with the caption, \"When the future looks oh so bright... 😎 @priyankachopra.\"\n\nChopra shared a photo of Jonas with her nephew, writing, \"Nephew and boo.. 😍❤️.\"\n\nThe bride-to-be capped off the month with a bachelorette party at Tiffany & Co's Blue Box Cafe in New York City. Guests included Kelly Ripa, Lupita Nyong’o, and Kevin's wife, Danielle.\n\nNovember 2018\n\nChopra seemingly headed from one bachelorette celebration to another. The actor posted several shots from the weekend in Amsterdam, which included costume changes and pajama parties. In one post, Chopra declared herself and Turner #TheJSisters.\n\nOn one photo from the weekend, Jonas commented, \"I am fully insta stalking you….you are so beautiful.\"\n\nEntertainment Tonight reported that the couple moved up their wedding to the end of 2018. \"For Priyanka and Nick, they know that they love one another and are going to be married, so they don't see the appeal in waiting too long,\" a source said.\n\nThe Blast claimed that the couple went to a Beverly Hills courthouse to fill out paperwork for a marriage license.\n\nFor Thanksgiving (and some pre-wedding festivities), the couple headed to India. It is a true family affair, as even members of the Jonas clan travel there.\n\nBoth Chopra and Jonas shared photos from the visit, which included a puja ceremony, a traditional spiritual event that happens before a major event, such as a wedding.\n\nAs people began to suspect that all of the festivities are a pre-wedding agenda, sources explained to Us Weekly why two high-profile friends wouldn't be in attendance. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were unable to travel due to the Duchess of Sussex's pregnancy.\n\nDecember 2018\n\nOn December 1, the couple tied the knot at the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Chopra wore a custom Ralph Lauren gown, with the designer also making a suit for Jonas. Jonas's father officiated the Christian ceremony, per People. The following day, Indian fashion designer Sabyasachi outfitted the bride and groom for the Hindu ceremony.\n\n\"One of the most special things that our relationship has given us is a merging of families who love and respect each other's faiths and cultures. And so planning our wedding with an amalgamation of both was so so amazing,\" both captioned photos of the pre-wedding Mehendi.\n\nThe next night, both the bride and groom shared footage from the Sangeet (musical night) of the pre-wedding rituals.\n\nOn December 3, the newly married couple shared a sneak peek of their Vogue cover, where they talked in-depth about how they met, the proposal, and what's next.\n\nSoon, the couple shared photos from each of their wedding ceremonies. \"And forever starts now... ❤️ @nickjonas,\" Chopra captions snaps from both the Hindu and Christian ceremonies. \"Happiest day of my life. @priyankachopra,\" Jonas captioned his.\n\nBoth Jonas and Chopra also shared family portraits from their nuptials on Instagram.\n\nIn the post-wedding afterglow, Mr. and Mrs. Jonas showed off their Chopard wedding rings.

Jonas captioned a photo of the couple by a pool, \"Mr. & Mrs. Jonas.\" An E! source said that Jonas was tasked with planning the honeymoon. The insider said, \"(Priyanka) had no idea it was going to be the Caribbean and Nick is planning everything for the trip, it's all a complete surprise to Priyanka.

When I actually started dating Nick, he surprised me so much.\" She went on to say, “He’s such an old soul, extremely smart, so good for me because he grounds me so much. I’m a wild child, I do whatever I want whenever I want and he always supports me.”\n\nChopra supported him right back that same month, attending a Jonas Brothers show in Pennsylvania with Danielle and Sophie.\n\nMay 2019\n\nChopra accompanied Jonas to the Billboard Music Awards, where the brothers reunited to perform new music.

Jonas captioned a shot from the evening:\n\n\"One year ago today I went to go see Beauty and the Beast at the Hollywood bowl with a group of friends. One of those friends was the woman that would become my best friend, my confidant, my muse, my beautiful wife. I am so grateful for our journey together so far. You make me smile every day and you inspire me to be the best version of myself. I am honored to be your husband. I love you. ❤️ @priyankachopra\"\n\nJune 2019\n\nChopra went as Jonas’s plus one for the premiere of his Amazon documentary, Happiness Begins.\n\nThe same month, the album Happiness Begins dropped, solidifying the return of the Jonas Brothers. \"I Believe,\" a song off the album further solidified the connection between Chopra and Jonas. In the song, Nick sings, “Call me crazy / People saying that we move too fast / But I’ve been waiting, and for a reason / Ain’t no turning back / ‘Cause you show me something I can’t live without / I believe, I believe, I believe.”\n\nDuring an interview for InStyle, Chopra opened up about hurtful comments over her and Jonas’s ten-year age difference.\n\n“People gave us a lot of shit about that and still do,” she said. “I find it really amazing when you flip it and the guy is older, no one cares and actually people like it.”\n\nOn June 18, Chopra captioned a sweet selfie, \"That kinda day.. 😍❤️💋😊💏#husbandappreciation.\"\n\nJuly 2019\n\nIn an interview with ELLE UK, Chopra discussed how things have changed since becoming Mrs. Jonas. “I’d never realised having a husband and a boyfriend are such different things,\" she said. \"When you say your vows, it’s like, this person is my family, and it’s the family I chose. There’s a weird responsibility to them. And a safety that comes from it. We are learning about each other every day.”\n\nThe couple headed back to Miami for some boating and PDA-filled posts. \"My 💓,\" Chopra wrote alongside a photo of the couple.\n\n“Date night cooking extravaganza,” Jonas captioned a video of himself and Chopra making pasta in Italy.\n\nFor Chopra’s birthday, Jonas shared two photos of his wife smiling for the camera, writing, “Light of my world. My whole heart. I love you baby. Happy birthday.”\n\nAugust 2019\n\nOn August 8, Chopra documented another #JSisters concert appearance in Miami.\n\nTMZ reports that the couple was searching for a new home in Bel Air or Beverly Hills with a price tag at around at $20 million. The outlet also said that Jonas quietly sold his bachelor pad in Beverly Hills for $6.9 million in July.\n\nSeptember 2019\n\n\"So proud. When you own your own tequila at 27! @villaone❤,\" Chopra captioned photos of her husband for his birthday. The only problem? At the time, Jonas was still 26. However, Jonas didn’t seem to notice the age issue, commenting, “My beautiful forever date.”\n\nBabies are seemingly on the brain for Chopra and Jonas. In an interview with Vogue India, Chopra says,“Buying a home and having a baby are on my to-do list.”\n\nOn September 16, Chopra shared a proper birthday tribute to Jonas with a montage of their love story. She captioned it, “The light of my life. Everyday with you is better than the last. You deserve all the happiness in the world. Thank you for being the most generous loving man I have ever met. Thank you for being mine. Happy birthday Jaan. I love you @nickjonas.”\n\nNovember 2019\n\nA few weeks before their wedding anniversary, Chopra surprised Jonas with an early present. She filmed herself giving her husband with a pet puppy, which they named Gino. (Naturally, the dog’s Instagram account soon followed.) \"Pri came home with the absolute best surprise this morning,\" Jonas wrote alongside the video, which he posted on IG. \"Please meet our new pup @ginothegerman I haven’t stopped smiling since I woke up this morning and finally realized what was going on.

He just happens to look like GI joe in those leather pants!! 😍 #husbandappreciationpost.\"\n\nJonas posted three black-and-white photos of the pair backstage. \"My Valentine. ♥️,\" he wrote alongside the pictures.\n\nMarch 2020\n\nAt the start of the month, Chopra and Jonas went horseback riding in Carpinteria, California.

In an article written for Vogue, Chopra said Jonas had begun teaching her how to play piano. \"I’ve also started the piano—I make my husband teach me,\" she wrote. \"I’ve never played, but I’ve always wanted to learn an instrument, so I make him give me a half-hour or 45-minute lesson every day.\" Not only is Jonas her \"in-house piano teacher,\" but an \"in-house physical trainer, and in-house writing partner,\" Chopra noted. On April 25, she posted a photo of herself and her husband, writing, \"Felt like wearing a saree. So I did...At home. Miss everyone. ❤️ @nickjonas.\"\n\nMay 2020\n\nHowever, not all of Jonas’s hobbies have been beneficial to Chopra.

It’s been incredible watching her discover new things.\" Chopra also said she was \"trying to learn the piano\" from her husband.\n\nThat same month, the couple celebrated a few more events on the ‘gram. Jonas posted a sunlit photo of himself and Chopra for her latest birthday. \"I could stare into your eyes forever. I love you baby.

I am the luckiest girl in the world! I love you @nickjonas.\"\n\nAugust 2020\n\nAnd then the Chopra-Jonas clan welcomed a new member to the family.

Let’s get it!! I love u babu! 😍\"\n\nMay 2022\n\nThe couple welcomed their daughter Malti Marie Chopra Jonas, after she was delivered via surrogate in early 2022. Four months later on May 8, they shared their first photo of the newborn on their Instagram pages. In the picture, Chopra is holding the baby for skin-to-skin contact with Jonas at her side. The baby is in pink with a white headband featuring a bow, and her face is discreetly covered.\n\nIn the caption, they shared how Malti needed to remain in the NICU for more than 100 days, causing them a great deal of stress and worry.\n\n“On this Mother’s Day we can’t help but reflect on these last few months and the rollercoaster we’ve been on, which we now know, so many people have also experienced,” the actress wrote. “After 100 plus days in the NICU, our little girl is finally home.”\n\nShe continued, “Every family’s journey is unique and requires a certain level of faith, and while ours was a challenging few months, what becomes abundantly clear, in retrospect, is how precious and perfect every moment is. We are overjoyed that our little girl is finally home, and just want to thank every Doctor, nurse and specialist at Rady Children’s La Jolla and Cedar Sinai, Los Angeles, who were there selflessly every step of the way. Our next chapter begins now, and our baby is truly a badass. Let’s get it MM! Mommy and Daddy love you.”\n\nNovember 2022\n\nThe couple has kept Malti’s face mostly private, but will occasionally share a little glimpse of her cuteness. In November, Chopra shared a shot of the 10-month-old bundled up in her car seat, with a little pink beanie partially covering her face.\n\nChopra captioned the image, “I mean…” along with two heart-eyed emojis.\n\nAn insider told E! News this summer that the couple are \"very in love.\"\n\nThe insider added, “It’s like Malti has brought them good luck with how amazing things seem for them all around right now.”\n\nAugust 2023\n\nIn an interview with People, Jonas reflected on the “surprisingly difficult” part of his 2018 wedding to Chopra.\n\n“There’s this one moment in Indian weddings where the bride and groom are lifted on the shoulders of their family members and there’s sort of a game that’s played where this garland is put on each other,” he said. “They try to be the first to put the garland on the other. And it’s surprisingly difficult, especially when you have someone as competitive as me and Pri. But whoever is the one to put it on first, that side of the family is the more dominant.”\n\nHe added, “So it’s really for the family members to feel pride and that’s just a funny game. But it’s really heartwarming and a great way for the families to all connect.”\n\nThe couple had a second wedding officiated by Jonas’ dad, Kevin Jonas Sr. and Jonas said the contrasting ceremonies showed “how similar the different religions actually are and the ceremonies themselves have a lot of heart.”\n\n“That allowed us to really connect with our families and with each other,” Jonas explained. “Which is the most important thing.”\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nOn Sunday, September 3, Chopra shared some shots of herself with Jonas as they traveled to Austin, Texas. First, she shared a picture of herself sitting next to her husband in the car with the words, “See you soon.”\n\nShe was wearing a white top and silver necklace and earrings.

The couple held hands as they walked.\n\nDecember 2023\n\nOn Friday, December 22, Chopra shared new pictures with Jonas and Malti in a carousel of photos that she captioned, “Lately,” along with the prayer hands emoji. It seems like lately Chopra has been spending time with friends during the holidays, sitting in her husband’s lap, and playing with Malti in the yard.\n\nIn one photo, the proud mom hugs 23-month-old Malti from behind as she makes her way across the grass.

He’ll be starring across from comedian Paul Rudd, and Chopra seemed to be excited about the timing of their work—she just finished filming Prime Video film, Heads of State with Idris Elba and John Cena.\n\n“Husband appreciation post: As I finish one he starts one,” Priyanka wrote on May 9 in the caption of a picture of Jonas. “The universe keeps us in sync. So happy to be reunited as he starts filming Power Ballad. Congratulations on your first day, baby. There is no one who works harder than you.
