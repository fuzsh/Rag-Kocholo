        "text": "Nick Valentine is a synth residing in Diamond City as well as the owner and sole detective of Valentine Detective Agency in the Commonwealth in Fallout 4. He is a possible companion of the Sole Survivor.\n\nBackground[]\n\nLong believed by himself to be a prototype that was created by the Institute in-between the second generation and third generation of synth development, possibly explaining why he exhibits sapient intelligence and is not innately hostile towards non-Institute humans,[1] Nick is generally well respected throughout Diamond City despite his mysterious origins.\n\nCreation[]\n\nIn truth, the synth that became Nick Valentine was created over a century prior to 2287 within the Institute. He was one of two prototypes for the Gen 2 model, intended to test if and how synths could handle independent thinking and personalities. Nick himself was implanted with an artificial personality based on memory recordings of pre-war humans while the other, named DiMA, was allowed to develop his own personality based on personal experience.\n\nFor years the first synth was experimented on, having various personalities and memories from former humans loaded into him before they achieved success. Despite this, he and DiMA grew a family-like bond to one another due to being the first and only synths of their kind. Gradually, however, DiMA grew to resent the experiments being performed on him and his \"brother.\" At some point, the two synths managed to escape, but not before the Institute uploaded another new personality and memories into DiMA's brother.[2][3]\n\nThe synth, now identifying himself as a pre-War police officer named Nick Valentine, was left in a state of confusion due to suddenly \"waking up\" 200 years in the future. With the human Nick's memories taking priority, he attacked DiMA, who he did not recognize, forcing DiMA to knock Nick out and leave him behind.[4] After regaining consciousness in a pile of garbage an unknown amount of time later, Nick wandered the wasteland for several weeks.[5][6] Due to the limited capacity of his prototype brain, the memories of his \"brother\" DiMA were eventually forgotten entirely.[7]\n\nWandering the Commonwealth[]\n\nDue to an unfamiliarity with the Institute and its technology during that time, most wastelanders regarded Nick with equal parts fear and awe. However, he was eventually accepted into a small local community where a mechanic helped repair the damage he had sustained in his travels. During this time Nick befriended a child named Jim who became the first instance of human contact Nick had since escaping the Institute. To him, the community was the first group to treat Nick as a human being rather than a mechanical monstrosity. Nick eventually left that settlement to continue wandering; when he tried to go back years later, he found that it had been destroyed by raiders.[8]\n\nSometime after, Nick eventually arrived at Diamond City. Although the people there held no small amount of hatred for the Institute and their synths, due to the combined trauma of the Massacre of the CPG and the Broken Mask incident, Nick gained their respect by unknowingly saving the daughter of Henry Roberts, the mayor at the time, after she ran away with a caravan trader. The trader and his companions were, unbeknownst to the girl, actually kidnappers who proceeded to take her hostage, but Nick managed to stumble upon the scene by pure accident. Finding himself being held at gunpoint, the synth scared them away by claiming that he had a bomb inside him and making beeping sounds (literally by saying the word \"beep\" repeatedly).[9]\n\nDiamond City's Detective[]\n\nWhen the mayor's daughter told Nick what had happened, he brought her back to her father, who rewarded Nick with a house in Diamond City despite the objections of some citizens. Nick gradually eased the citizens' fears by offering to act as the city's handyman, along with continuing to help track down missing people. His formidable detective skills were revealed when he helped to find a wife who was presumed dead; Nick discovered that she had only run away with her lover. In time, people stopped asking Nick to fix things as it became clear that he had found his true calling as Diamond City's private investigator.[10] Eventually, Nick made it official and founded the Valentine Detective Agency, later hiring a secretary, Ellie Perkins to help him manage the influx of cases coming across his desk.\n\nAt some point, Nick had an association with Marty Bullfinch, though as he claims, theirs was a shaky partnership due to Marty's alcoholism, and eventually they parted ways on sour terms. Marty visited the agency again at a later time and left a holotape with details about his scheme to uncover the treasure of Shem Drowne by going to Faneuil Hall and recovering the gilded grasshopper, hoping Nick might be interested in helping him.[11] In a similar vein, Nick once worked on a case that led to him meeting Kenji Nakano and involved the use of the fisherman's boat to find a lost heirloom; when they returned it to the client, they were double-crossed, and Kenji ended up getting shot in the hip and the lead left inside after he'd healed. Kenji was nevertheless happy to help Nick and still remembers him, to the point that when his daughter goes missing, he immediately turns to Nick for help.[12]\n\nAround a couple of weeks before the Sole Survivor woke up in Vault 111 on October 23, 2287, Nick went out on a case to find a missing woman named Darla believed to have been kidnapped by gang boss Skinny Malone (an \"old pal\" of Nick).[13] However, when he cornered Skinny and his gang inside the Park Street station and Vault 114 beneath it, Nick discovered both that Darla wasn't kidnapped but actually joined with Skinny of her own volition, and that Skinny's gang was in control of the Vault as their new hideout. The result was the synth detective getting incapacitated and imprisoned in the Vault overseer's office until the Sole Survivor later came to Vault 114 and fought past the Triggermen to rescue Valentine in order to get his help finding their missing son, Shaun.[14]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDue to having the memories of a police officer from the time before the Great War, Nick has an established moral compass and always tries to act on the side of justice, though even he understands that, in the lawless wasteland, sometimes justice can only be delivered from the barrel of a gun.[15] He has little to no love for those who selfishly exploit other people and have no qualms about stepping on the weak who get in their way, like raiders and super mutants. Even so, he's not above cracking wise and laying on a thick layer of snark at times, especially to those he dislikes.[16][17][18]\n\nHowever, ever since realizing his true nature and his supposed origins, Nick has grappled with a severe existential crisis. Troubled by the knowledge that everything he knows, everything that makes him who he is, it all came from someone else, Nick carries a sense of extreme self-loathing, unable to reconcile that he could ever be anything other than the plastic-skinned ghost of a dead man from a bygone era.[19] This dichotomy has ultimately caused Nick to define himself as a separate person from the pre-War Nick Valentine, feeling as though he owes that Nick for giving him a name and personality -- a sense of identity even if it was one he was given rather than created with. However, the influence of the human Nick's memories means Nick also still carries some of his emotional attachments, particularly anger over his past with Eddie Winter who was responsible for the death of Nick the human's fiancé, Jennifer Lands.\n\nAs someone who is between worlds, remembering the Old World while inhabiting its post-apocalyptic aftermath, Nick is desperate for a sense of belonging not easily granted to him. Created as a prototype synth tossed out into a Commonwealth that hated and feared him just for existing, Nick worked very hard to ingratiate himself to those around him despite the uphill battle it presented. Lending aid to settlements and wastelanders wherever he went, Nick's efforts eventually paid off as he gained an uneasy place of notoriety within Diamond City as \"Nick the detective,\" even though some there still heave heavy discrimination upon him as \"Nick the synth.\"\n\nInteractions with the player character[]\n\nFallout 4[]\n\nThe player is directed towards Diamond City by Mama Murphy during the main questline, and several NPC's can direct them towards the Valentine Detective Agency in their search for their missing son Sean. However- Nick is absent, working a disappearance case that results in him being imprisoned in Vault 114 by Skinny Malone, and the Sole Survivor is directed to find them by his secretary Ellie Perkins.\n\nThe Sole Survivor uncovers Nick in the old Overseers office, and while the player may be shocked at his synth nature, Nick directs their focus towards escaping. Once that is accomplished Nick will make his way back to his office in Diamond City willing to aid the Sole Survivor in the 200-year old cold-case of their missing son. Sitting down to go over the events of Sean's kidnapping Nick will determine the most likely culprit is the mercenary Kellog, and try to break into his abandoned house. Once successful they uncover some of Kellog's San Francisco Sunlights it allows Dogmeat to track Kellog to Fort Hagen. Nick will offer to accompany the Sole Survivor during the journey.\n\nEither way once Kellog is dead, Nick meets up with Piper Wright at Publick Occurences to discuss the next stage of the investigation, determining that they could use Dr. Amari's memory loungers to sift through some of Kellog's dead memories. They make the trip to Goodneighbor and recruit Dr. Amari to the cause, using Nick Valentine as a proxy, however the process leaves a brief imprint of Kellog on Nick though it passes.\n\nNick Valentine grows to see the Sole Survivor as a partner in crime solving, the first in a long while, and as they travel the Commonwealth he unveils more of his background to in his words 'even the playing field' since Nick Valentine has learned so much of the Sole Survivor's background. After enough trust has been built, Nick asks that the Sole Survivor aid him on a long-dead case: The hunt for Eddie Winter. Nick still holds a grudge against winter for killing the fiance of the original Nick Valentine, and believes that thanks to a radiation experiment he lives as a ghoul. Together they scour much of the Commonwealth's old police offices for old records of Eddie Winter that will give the access to code to his secret bunker and eliminate him.\n\nFar Harbor[]\n\nIn addition, Nick's services are called upon by an old contact of his, the Nakano family whose daughter has gone missing. Nick Valentine and the Sole Survivor search their property learning she believes she is in fact a synth and sought refuge in a synth colony on the Island. The two make their way to Acadia, where they find DiMA who is shocked by the arrival of his long-lost 'brother'. DiMA explains that both he and Nick were prototype Synth's until the managed to escape.\n\nInteractions overview[]\n\nInteractions This character is essential. Essential characters cannot be killed. This character is a permanent companion. They grant the Close to Metal perk. This character is a temporary companion. This character starts quests.\n\nLong Time Coming\n\nThis character is involved in quests.\n\nUnlikely Valentine\n\nGetting a Clue\n\nReunions\n\nDangerous Minds\n\nCompanion[]\n\nNick Valentine becomes available as a companion after picking up the San Francisco Sunlights found in the secret room of Kellogg's house in Diamond City during Getting a Clue.\n\nHe has the unique trait of being able to hack terminals, akin to having the Hacker perk. His chance of successfully hacking decrease in ascending order from Novice to Master. If he fails to hack the terminal in four attempts, then he will be locked out permanently from that terminal, unable to hack it again. It is therefore advised to save right before he begins hacking a high-difficulty terminal to prevent this.\n\nHe will refuse to hack terminals that are marked as \"owned\" by another person.\n\nIf they are not owned, he can be used to hack otherwise inaccessible terminals that do not become relevant until during specific quests.\n\nNick Valentine cannot be romanced.\n\nHe cannot change clothing, as he is restricted to his detective outfit. He may, however, enter power armor, thus the only way to increase Nick's carrying capacity is with power armor. Unlike other characters, Nick will exit the power armor after he is dismissed.\n\nNick can, however, be upgraded in terms of defense. If the faded trench coat given by Ellie is customized with ballistic weave after completing Jackpot for PAM in the Railroad HQ, it can then be equipped to Nick. This will restore his right hand, although it appears to be slightly shorter than his left hand.\n\nOne can restore his original metal hand at any point by re-equipping his unique coat via selecting him in console commands and typing equipItem 0010c3ca to execute.\n\nNick Valentine has about 30-40 more HP than most other companions, with the exceptions of Strong and Curie in her Ms. Nanny body. This is balanced out by his inability to wear armor. However, as a prototype synth, he has an innate damage resistance of 25 (about equal to a full set of girded leather armor) and an energy resistance of 5, offering him some modest protection in combat. This is the same innate damage/energy resistance that Codsworth has. Like Codsworth, this innate resistance receives a moderate increase at very high levels but is less than what would be provided by a good suit of armor.\n\nEffects of player's actions[]\n\nAchieving maximum affinity with Nick Valentine grants the Close to Metal perk, which offers one extra attempt when hacking and a 50% reduced lockout time upon failing a hack. However, until Long Time Coming is completed, of which itself is not triggered until after completing Dangerous Minds, his affinity rating will remain at 999.\n\nNick Valentine will comment on the Sole Survivor's decisions after completing the main questline, responding negatively to choosing the Institute and completing Nuclear Family. He typically will act vaguely disappointed, as he believed the Institute to be the only way to figure out who he really was. Even if the player were to progress the Far Harbor quest line, his reaction will remain the same.\n\nOther interactions[]\n\nNick will comment if taken to Nate/Nora's corpse in Vault 111.[20]\n\nIf the Mysterious Stranger perk is taken and he makes an appearance in V.A.T.S. while Nick Valentine is an active companion, Nick will comment on it, unlike every other companion.[21]\n\nOne can find a case file under Nick's bed in the Valentine Detective Agency building, which details his investigation of the Mysterious Stranger and contains references to the Stranger's appearances in previous games, specifically noting past appearances and rumors of past appearances in Shady Sands (Fallout), the New California Republic (Fallout 2), and the Capital Wasteland (Fallout 3), though the file leaves the Mojave Wasteland (Fallout: New Vegas) unmentioned.\n\nAfter completing Dangerous Minds, and following a misc. quest to talk to Nick in the Memory Den, he briefly speaks in Kellogg's voice in an amused and resigned tone, suggesting that part of Kellogg may have survived in some way through Nick. However, this only happens once, and it has no in-game effect afterward as Nick never says anything else in Kellogg's voice. Nick himself will seem unaware of speaking as Kellogg at all, offering the explanation from Doctor Amari that some mnemonic impressions from Kellogg's brain may have remained after the procedure. He will get a little upset if the player character says there might be something wrong with him.\n\nIf Nick is an active companion during the random encounter where a three-man group of raiders waits until the Sole Survivor gets very close before attacking, there is a chance for one of them to tell the group to stop attacking. He will then remark that had he recognized Nick sooner, they would not have attacked, as Nick apparently helped him in the past. Nick replies awkwardly due to not remembering the incident but is thankful for the peaceful end.\n\nWhen fighting mirelurks, one of Nick's comments is to say \"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyestalks!\", a reference to a battlefield order (\"Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!\") attributed to Col. William Prescott, and repeated by Israel Putnam at the Battle of Bunker Hill during the American Revolution, by which the Continental Army was ordered to reserve ammunition and attack at shorter ranges due to the need to conserve their scarce supplies of gunpowder.\n\nVault residents, settlers, and members of the Brotherhood of Steel may occasionally insult Nick when near him, with Nick responding in kind.\n\nSome Brotherhood members will question if the player character isn't worried that Nick is \"a spy.\" In addition, Elder Maxson will question the Sole Survivor's judgment for traveling with \"that thing\" if he's brought aboard the Prydwen. Despite this, the Brotherhood will not become hostile to the Sole Survivor or Nick at any point.\n\nNick will have different responses if taken to Acadia after completing Best Left Forgotten, depending on whether the Sole Survivor suggested that he refuse DiMA's offer of being family[22] or accept DiMA as his brother.[23]\n\nRange of interests[]\n\nAffinity reactions Approvals Disapprovals\n\nLikes\n\nDoing selfless or kind acts.\n\nHacking unowned computer terminals.\n\nHealing Dogmeat.\n\nPersuading Mama Murphy to lay off the chems and go clean during The Sight.\n\nPutting the deathclaw egg back in the nest and leaving it there during The Devil's Due.\n\nSympathizing with Phyllis Daily's loss at Egret Tours Marina.\n\nTelling Phyllis Daily the best way to heal is to help others.\n\nRemarking to Blake Abernathy that farming is hard work.\n\nHelping the Minutemen retake the Castle during Taking Independence.\n\nLikening the synths' plight to slavery when speaking to Desdemona during Road to Freedom.\n\nSaying \"Slavery is wrong.\" when speaking to Desdemona during Road to Freedom.\n\nSiding against Dr. Roslyn Chambers and the Compound during Human Error.\n\nPassing Charisma checks to lower a caps payment (asking for more caps will instead garner dislike).\n\nComplimenting Magnolia in the Third Rail, saying her song \"was perfect.\"\n\nHumoring Captain Ironsides during Last Voyage of the U.S.S.

Life inside the Institute... they keep you isolated. A single test chamber was my whole world for years. And someone was always watching. Then one day you wake up on the other side. And that's it. They've cut you loose. Welcome to the Brave New World... with such people in it.\"\n\n\"The story gets even more twisted. The arrogant bastard wanted to cheat death. Live forever... So he could come out of that shelter someday, into this brave new world. Sound familiar? Only Eddie didn't want to be a frozen banana. No cryo sleep for him. No, he invested his money in some sick, crazy radiation experiment.\"\n\n\"Well, there were a lot of questions I was hoping the Institute could answer, but I've already made it this far without 'em. I think I'll manage. This is a brave new world you've ushered in. But I suppose it'll do.\"\n\nThe Nucleus: After activating the nuclear payload and destroying the Children of Atom. \"I am become death, the destroyer of worlds...\"\n\nFallout: The Board Game[]\n\nNick Valentine can be acquired at the shop by any player character that has Charisma. When the player character has him as the active companion and there is an enemy within two spaces, the player character can exhaust him to move the target enemy one space in any direction. When the player character performs the camp action, he will become unexhausted. However, if there are any active level 3 enemies on the map at that time, he must be discarded.\n\nInventory[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nMeeting Nick Valentine in Vault 114 before visiting Diamond City will automatically start Unlikely Valentine. After leaving Vault 114, he will have unique dialogue asking about how they found him.\n\nAfter Dangerous Minds, conversing with Nick in the Memory Den and choosing an option where Nick does not accompany the player character, Nick may say, \"I'll return to Diamond City...\" However, if one has had Nick as a companion prior to Dangerous Minds, and at some point dismissed him and sent him to a settlement, he will actually go to the last settlement he was assigned to. This may account for some of the reports of Nick disappearing - the player character has previously assigned him to a settlement, forgotten and the game dialogue hasn't accounted for that.\n\nWhile normally essential and therefore unkillable, Nick Valentine has a death quote, \"Not like this...\"\n\nDespite being an early model synth and therefore made of \"gears & sprockets\" as he puts it, when injured as a companion, Nick can be revived with a stimpak as if he were flesh and blood.\n\nLike with Preston Garvey, random townspeople may occasionally offer Nick a gift for his help in the past. However, he will not accept, and nothing will be found in his inventory afterward.\n\nDuring the latter half of Reunions, Nick may be waiting only in his or Piper's office, even if sent to a settlement.\n\nDuring The Glowing Sea, while he will recommend that they take him with them into the Glowing Sea, as he is immune to radiation, because the game makes all human companions immune to environmental radiation, Nick is as good a choice as Piper or MacCready.\n\nDuring Long Time Coming, it's advisable to ask Nick to leave his power armor before collecting the last tape, otherwise he will remain in it until the quest is finished since the \"Talk\" option will trigger quest-relevant dialogue instead of the usual options which include the prompt to exit power armor. However, it may be still possible to get him out by trying to \"Talk\" again right after answering his question.\n\nNick appears briefly in the Fallout 4 official trailer walking under a streetlamp outside the Memory Den in Goodneighbor.\n\nIf sent back to a settlement, before visiting the Memory Den during Dangerous Minds, he will instead go to the Memory Den and his movement will be locked to the quest progression.\n\nIf sent to Longfellow's cabin, Nick may spend his time wandering around the outskirts of Far Harbor instead.\n\nBoth Nick Valentine and DiMA have the able to read Holotapes seen in the Best Left Forgotten and Long Time Coming Quests\n\nNotable quotes[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nNick Valentine appears in Fallout 4, Fallout: The Board Game, Fallout: Wasteland Warfare, and Fallout Shelter Online.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nVoiceover[]\n\nTalking about his performance as Nick Valentine, voice actor Stephen Russell stated he took inspiration from the style of noir detective that Nick is based upon, in particular the actor Humphrey Bogart, whom Russell said he has seen just about every film he starred in. Russell stated that Nick is one of the \"most soulful\" characters he has played, owing to his moral compass and being \"intentionally ironic\" in a way, given his status as a synth with the memories of a human. When recording for Nick, Russell did not yet even know what the character looked like, as he only had a script to work with. After seeing the in-game model, he thought that Nick's final appearance ultimately fit the character very well.[Non-game 1]\n\nNick's voiceover in Far Harbor is somewhat different from the tone and pitch of his voice in the base game, being slightly deeper and slower in delivery. Although Russell returned for Far Harbor, Nick sounds moderately different in the two appearances due to taking place in different recording sessions happening at different times.\n\nAlthough Nick and DiMA are both voiced by Russell and share many scenes with each other, their lines were recorded by him in different sessions.[Non-game 2][Non-game 3] One challenge that Russell encountered while voicing DiMA was balancing the need to differentiate him from Nick with a different voice range to show that while they are brothers, they are two different entities with differing personalities.[Non-game 4]\n\nIn localized versions of the game, Nick's voice is dubbed by Jorge García Insúa (Spanish), Luc Bernard (French), Shigeru Ushiyama (Japanese) and Renzo Ferrini (Italian).\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nAccording to Emil Pagliarulo, Nick was one of the first characters created for Fallout 4. An original design document contained concepts for Nick even before the setting of the game was finalized.[Non-game 5] His origins lie in a sketch by Adam Adamowicz during the early pre-production of Fallout 4, which describes an idea for a \"scraped up metallic ken doll detective\" inspired by The X-Files.[Non-game 6] Pagliarulo then created a deeper concept for Nick based on his love for film noir detectives.[Non-game 7]\n\nEmil Pagliarulo and Jeff Gardiner, lead designer and lead producer respectively, have both stated that Nick is their favorite character in the entire Fallout series. Pagliarulo enjoyed seeing designers Liam Collins and William Shen[Non-game 8] take the concept of Nick and flesh it out into a well-developed character.[Non-game 9]\n\nCultural references[]\n\nNick displays an awareness of human culture and literature throughout the game. He quotes Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven if he is present when the Prydwen arrives in the Commonwealth. He also quotes Percy Bysshe Shelley's sonnet \"Ozymandias\" if he is brought to General Atomics Galleria and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World during his second approval talk if one chooses to ask him what he remembers about the Institute. In addition, he quotes William Shakespeare's The Tempest and paraphrases Polonius from Hamlet at different points.\n\nIf he is present during the explosion of the Nucleus, he quotes the Bhagavad Gita, \"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\" This exact sentence was quoted by J. Robert Oppenheimer after witnessing the first nuclear test detonation.\n\nBugs[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nFallout 4[]\n\nFallout: Wasteland Warfare[]\n\nFallout Shelter Online[]\n\nMagic: The Gathering[]\n\n[]\n\nNick Valentine on Wikipedia\n\nReferences[]\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"Worst of all, no one knows why they do it, what their plan is, or where they are. Not even me, and I'm a synth myself. A discarded prototype, anyway.\"\n\nSole Survivor: \"You're a prototype?\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"As far as I know. Never seen any other synth like myself. There's the older ones that are dumb as rocks and all metal, then there's the newer ones that are almost human. I'm somewhere in between.\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's dialogue)\n\n↑ DiMA: \"This all started over a century ago, when we were first created... We were prototypes, Nick. The first synths capable of independent thinking and judgment. I couldn't let them do it to you anymore. We were the only two prototypes they made. I literally saw myself in you... You were my brother, Nick. I helped you escape the Institute. We left together.\"\n\n(DiMA's dialogue)\n\n↑ DiMA: \"One of the Institute's experiments had to do with how our brains could process personality. If we could handle individualized feelings and behaviors. I was allowed to develop mine based on experience. But with you, they wanted to try transferring an entire personality into you. It took several attempts before the personality imprint worked. I saw you wake up not knowing who or what you were so many times...\"\n\n(DiMA's dialogue)\n\n↑ DiMA's Memory #4\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"I woke up in a junk pile ages ago. Just another discarded prototype.\"\n\n(CompanionNickValentine.txt)\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"I'm still mechanical, not bioengineered like the fancy synths giving everyone the willies these days. I get tune-ups now instead of check-ups. But my memories, my personality, they're all lifted from some cop who volunteered for an experiment back before the war. They scanned his brain and copied it onto the hardware that runs between my ears.\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's affinity dialogue)\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"If I were your brother, I'd remember!\"\n\nDiMA: \"That's where you'd be wrong. This happened over a century ago. There's... there's only so much memory that can fit into the prototype brains we have...\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's companion dialogue and DiMA's dialogue)\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"Folks didn't really know much about synths back then, so when I finally ran into people, they mostly treated me with caution rather than hostility. But the kids, they weren't afraid. I think his name was Jim. The first person to actually speak to me after I got the boot from the Institute. My first human contact in this world. Grilled me for an hour. Once they'd seen I wasn't going to hurt anyone, the other folks in the neighborhood came out to ogle the mechanical man. It eventually turned into a pretty swell soiree. Local mechanic even gave me a once over, free of charge. Those people, they treated me like a human being. I've been trying to return the favor ever since. It's a surprisingly rare trait out here sometimes. Something I've noticed you got a fondness for. Part of the reason I've stuck around this long.\"\n\nSole Survivor: \"Where's that town? We should go visit.\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"I tried to go back and say thanks, once I'd gotten myself established, but the place was wiped off the map. Raiders. Don't know what happened to the people.\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's affinity dialogue)\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"Thank goodness I found Diamond City. It's got its flaws, sure, but it beats the hell out of anywhere else in the Commonwealth. Course, when I took up there back when, people were just as scared of the Institute as they are now, maybe more. The massacre of the CPG was still pretty fresh in people's minds at that point, and folks were still losing sleep over the Broken Mask. Plenty of people assumed I was just a saboteur, moving in to melt down the reactor or poison the drinking water. But, at the time, they couldn't exactly turn me away.\"\n\nSole Survivor: \"Why'd they let you in?\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"Because I'd rescued the mayor's daughter. Gal of about fifteen, pride and joy of the mayor back then, man by the name of Henry Roberts. The young miss Roberts decided she'd run off with some caravan hand she'd known for an evening. Turns out the guy was part of a gang of kidnappers. I didn't even know who I was rescuing, just stumbled on a crying girl and four toughs. I took her home and the Mayor dubbed me a hero, offered me a place in town. Lots of folks protested, said I was a spy, but he wouldn't have it. Taking up in the city was tricky at first, but I never tried to hide what I was and people seemed to warm to that.\"\n\nSole Survivor: \"You took down four guys by yourself?\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"Didn't have to. Back then synths were even more of an unknown quantity than they are today. I told them I was rigged to explode and started going 'beep, beep, beep.' Hardest part of that rescue was keeping from laughing as they climbed over each other to get away.\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's affinity dialogue)\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"I started off doing the jobs no one else wanted. I got more banged up being Diamond City's handyman than I ever did living out in the ruins. But I guess folks never forgot I rescued the Mayor's daughter, so they started coming to me when people went missing. Wife runs off with a new paramour and takes the rent money with her? Talk to the Synth. An upset father decides moving him and the kids to Goodneighbor in the dead of night's not the worst damn idea since the bomb? Go get Nick. After a while, the jobs got so backed up, they didn't even ask me to do the handyman stuff anymore. Hell, I was so happy to do it, it was months before I started charging anyone. I never stopped being Nick the Synth, but it was Nick the detective folks came to see. It was about then that things, things finally started feeling normal.\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's affinity dialogue)\n\n↑ Ellie Perkins: \"The Marty Bullfinch case. Marty was Nick's partner. Emphasis on the \"was.\"\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"Marty and I never exactly saw eye to eye. Mostly because he was usually passed out on the barroom floor.\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's companion dialogue and Ellie's dialogue)\n\n↑ The Sole Survivor: \"So what's the story with you and Nick?\"\n\nKenji Nakano: \"Nick didn't tell you? Ran with him on one of his cases a few years back. Searching for some sort of lost heirloom. He needed a boat. Things... didn't end well. We were double-crossed by the client once we had what he was looking for. Still have some lead lodged into my hip.\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"Uh... right. Yeah, it's starting to come back to me... Sorry things ended sour.\"\n\nKenji Nakano: \"We got out, that's all that mattered. And now you can return the favor by finding my daughter...\"\n\n(Kenji Nakano's and Nick Valentine's dialogue)\n\n↑ Nick Valentine: \"Darla's a runaway. Her father wanted me to bring her back home.

Why kill Eddie Winter, even if he is still alive? This sounds like some kind of vendetta.\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"It's... it's nothing. Just some old business of Nick's that needs to taking care of. Justice has to be served. Now, are you in or not?\"\n\n(Nick Valentine's companion dialogue)\n\n↑ Finn: \"Well, well, it's the detective.

You feel. You're more than pretending, Nick.\"\n\nNick Valentine: \"Nice of you to say, but your kind don't usually have to deal with someone else's whole life trapped inside their skulls. Don't get me wrong. I know I'm in Nick's debt. These memories, they've kept me alive. Nick was a hell of a cop, a guy with good instincts, and a good heart. I always counted myself lucky they didn't load me up with some ex-con or whatever type might volunteer to let folks tinker with their gray matter. But it's thanks to Nick that I pass for human. Why I get to live cushy in Diamond City and every other synth is shot on sight. I know I got it good, but... my entire life I owe to Nick. Everything that makes me who I am - my judgment, my speech, hell, even my name - they're his. And I can't do a damn thing about it because without them... without them I'm nothing. A shell.
