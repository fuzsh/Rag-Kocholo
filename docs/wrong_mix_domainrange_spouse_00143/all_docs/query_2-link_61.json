        "text": "Nick Cannon has been surprisingly open about the births of his dozen children (and counting) in the media.\n\nThe 43-year-old entertainer said he practises “consensual non-monogamy” and selects the mothers of his children wisely. “Trust me, there’s a lot of people that I could’ve gotten pregnant that I didn’t. The ones that got pregnant are the ones that were supposed to get pregnant,” he said on his on his syndicated radio show in July 2021.\n\nCannon has also spoken at length about how he prioritises all of his many children. “I wake up being a father thinking about my kids and everything else comes after that,” Cannon told Tetris Kelly at a Billboard Live event in November 2022.\n\nSo, with that out the way, who are all Cannon’s children … and their mums?\n\nTwins Monroe and Moroccan with then-wife Mariah Carey\n\n(April 2011)\n\nMariah Carey and Cannon got married in 2008 after a brief courtship. They had twins, Moroccan and Monroe, who they and the press nicknamed #dembabies, in 2011. The couple separated in 2014 and their divorce was finalised in 2016. They continue to co-parent, and Cannon said on The Jason Lee Show in May 2023 that it was “healthier” for both them and their children to remain separated.\n\nCannon has shared some of their parenting challenges, including a squabble over when the twins would be allowed to get a mobile phone, on The Nick Cannon Show.\n\nSon Golden ‘Sagon’ with model Brittany Bell\n\n(February 2017)\n\nBrittany Bell, a former pageant queen who was crowned Miss Arizona in 2010 and Miss Guam in 2014, has dated Cannon on and off for years.\n\nBell’s first pregnancy was reported in November 2016, and Cannon confirmed that he was the baby’s father in an interview on The Breakfast Club. “God said be fruitful and multiply. I’m doing the lord’s work,” he said on air.\n\nDaughter Powerful Queen, Cannon’s second child with Bell\n\n(December 2020)\n\nBell announced that she and Cannon were expecting their second child together by posting an image of Golden sporting a Spider-Man costume with a cape that read “big brother” on the back in June 2020.\n\nThey announced the birth of their daughter, Powerful Queen Cannon, by posting a Christmas-themed family photo on Instagram.\n\nTwins Zillion and Zion with radio personality Abby De La Rosa\n\n(June 2021)\n\nAbby De La Rosa announced that she and Cannon were expecting twins with an Instagram post in April 2021. She said Cannon was her “dearest friend” and had won her heart with “openness and honesty”.\n\nSon Zen with model Alyssa Scott\n\n(June 2021)\n\nAlyssa Scott worked on Cannon’s comedy improv show Wild ‘n Out. She announced that she and Cannon were expecting a child together with a now-deleted Instagram post in January 2021. Their child Zen was born in June 2021.\n\nSadly, Zen died from brain cancer when he was five months old, in December 2021. The loss inspired Cannon to start a foundation dedicated to paediatric healthcare.\n\nSon Legendary Love with model and property agent Breana Tiesi\n\n(June 2022)\n\nBre Tiesi, who joined the cast of Selling Sunset in season six, told the Know for Sure podcast in June 2022 that she and Cannon had been dating on and off for 10 years. The couple also worked together on Cannon’s Wild ‘n Out comedy show.\n\nThey welcomed their son, Legendary Love, in June 2022. They shared the news on Instagram with a photo shoot where they wore all white.\n\nDaughter Onyx Ice with photographer and model Lanisha Cole\n\n(September 2022)\n\nCannon announced their new addition in a September 2022 Instagram post featuring a snapshot of himself, Lanisha Cole, and their baby girl in hospital. He expressed his admiration for Cole in the caption of the post.\n\nCannon previously said he probably spends the most time with Onyx out of all his children. In a May 2023 interview on The Jason Lee podcast, Cannon said he saw the then eight-month-old three times a week and even had a nursery for her connected to his office.\n\nSon Rise Messiah, Cannon’s third child with Bell\n\n(September 2022)\n\nCannon announced the birth on his Instagram and also posted a video of the “blessingway” ceremony he and Bell hosted. Cannon said in his caption that they needed the support because Bell experienced a difficult labour.\n\nDaughter Beautiful Zeppelin, Cannon’s third child with De La Rosa\n\n(November 2022)\n\nCannon and De La Rosa welcomed their daughter Beautiful Zeppelin in November 2022.\n\n“Damn! 1 night turned into 4 years and 3 kids real quick,” De La Rosa joked on her Instagram story, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nDaughter Halo Marie, Cannon’s second child with Scott\n\n(December 2022)\n\nScott revealed her pregnancy in an October 2022 Instagram post, and she and Cannon confirmed that he was the child’s father by sharing a series of images from their maternity shoot the following month.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Insider."
