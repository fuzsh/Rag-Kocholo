        "text": "Almost four years ago, I realized I was a terrible husband. I was lazy, unintentional, unreliable, and more. If not for a chance encounter with a couple who would quickly become my friends and mentors, I have no doubt that I‚Äôd be writing about my former marriage by now.\n\nSince then, I‚Äôve spent four years learning and applying as much as I can to improve my relationship and by sharing my favorite lessons learned from the pros, help you improve yours, too, no matter how great your relationship already is!\n\nIf you‚Äôre new to the site, the best ways to get into my head and take advantage of the research I‚Äôve done (and mistakes I‚Äôve made) already are to pick up my book, Confessions of a Terrible Husband: Lessons Learned from a Lumpy Couch, check out more posts right here, follow me on social channels, or listen to the podcast (It‚Äôs on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, and more. Just hover over the word ‚Äúpodcast‚Äù on the top of any page on the site!).\n\nAlthough my marriage is much improved, it‚Äôs definitely been more of a roller coaster than a rocket ship launching into space. We have ups and downs, like any relationship, although the ups are ‚Äúuppier‚Äù and the downs are less ‚Äúdownish.‚Äù Yes, I made those words up. It‚Äôs my blog. I can do that. üôÇ\n\nWe‚Äôve had periods where we make great progress and then weeks or months where things feel a bit stale and need a kickstart.\n\nWhen that happens, these three things help regain focus, direction, and momentum!\n\nIf you want to hear more detail about these, don't miss the podcast episode based on this! You can listen to it right here, or on your preferred podcast app like iTunes, Spotify, iHeartRadio, Stitcher, and more!\n\nChange your dinner plans.\n\nIt‚Äôs no secret that Dan and Joanne Miller were the first marriage mentors who I connected with to help me transform my relationship. Since meeting them, I‚Äôve been very intentional to surround myself with many other men, women, and couples with great marriages so I can learn as much as possible. As motivational speaker Jim Rohn famously said, we‚Äôre the average of the five people we spend the most time with.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to start with this is to just begin making dinner plans with couples you believe have great marriages. Keep it simple. You don‚Äôt need any magic words or to ask any specific questions. Just spend more time with people who have relationships like you want to build and less time with people who don‚Äôt. You can learn a ton just by being around people with great marriages.\n\nChange your programming with new books, podcasts, or video content.\n\nIf you can‚Äôt find people with great marriages to spend more time with, find virtual mentors by reading books, listening to podcasts, or watching great video content. If you can do this with your spouse, even better. But if not, that‚Äôs okay. Make the first move by consuming content that can help you improve your relationship and applying the lessons you learn.\n\nBefore I turned 30, I had read fewer than 10 books for personal growth, and those were all finance and business books. After turning 30, I started reading more business and marketing books. Although my finances looked great and my career was going well, my personal life was pretty . . . well, you know the name of this blog, so that pretty much says it all. üôÇ\n\nNow, I‚Äôm constantly either reading a book, listening to a podcast, or watching a video about improving my relationship and then committing to applying at least one thing I learned from the material. My favorite way to do it is through audiobooks, which I can listen to while emptying the dishwasher, cleaning my office, and more. I highly recommend everyone subscribe to Audible where you can get a new book every month. If you aren‚Äôt a member yet, you can get a free month and a free book to keep (even if you cancel) by heading here.\n\nHowever you consume content, direct some of it on a regular basis to improving your relationships, and commit to applying one lesson you learn from each piece of content to put a jolt in your relationship.\n\nTake a guided challenge!\n\nWhen you‚Äôre just starting to intentionally improve your relationship, or if it‚Äôs been weeks or months since you last made an intentional effort, one of the easiest and best ways to build positive momentum is to take a guided challenge.\n\nThe best part about taking a guided challenge is it takes all the thinking out of improving your relationship! You don‚Äôt need to look for a lesson or get anyone‚Äôs buy-in. You just follow the instructions.\n\nI‚Äôve made it a point to take at least one challenge every year and each time I take one, my marriage gets a great boost!\n\nThis year, I‚Äôm taking a FREE 7-day challenge by the Ziglar family (yes, that Ziglar family!) that starts Monday, March 27, 2017, and I‚Äôd like to invite you to do it with me.\n\nAfter taking a deep dive behind the scenes of the free 7-day challenge, I saw three things that made me quickly become more excited about this free challenge than about many paid challenges I‚Äôve seen.\n\nFirst, it‚Äôs only 7 days long. Anyone can stick to a challenge for 7 days.\n\nSecond, it touches 7 key areas of family life, including relationship, communication, physical health, work‚Äìlife integration, community, financial, and‚Äîif you‚Äôre spiritual in nature‚Äîspiritual.\n\nFinally, the challenge is led by seven leading experts on their relevant subject matter.\n\nGet this:\n\nDay 1: Gary Chapman (Relationships)\n\nDay 2: Michael & Gail Hyatt (Communication)\n\nDay 3: Dr. Josh Axe (Physical Health)\n\nDay 4: Tony Dungy (Work‚ÄìLife Integration)\n\nDay 5: Brian Buffini (Community)\n\nDay 6: Dave Ramsey (Finances)\n\nDay 7: Zig Ziglar‚Äôs own children ‚Äì Cindy, Julie, and Tom (Spirituality).\n\nNeedless to say, that‚Äôs seven sorts of awesome right there. And each of them shares their best advice for you during the challenge!\n\nI hope you join me in taking the challenge! I liked it so much I agreed to help promote the free challenge for them in addition to taking it myself. It‚Äôs totally free to sign up. They also have other great free content there to check out and a paid membership and coaching program if you want to go even deeper, so be sure to check it out.\n\nAre you ready to kickstart your marriage?\n\nHow will you do it? Will you change your dinner plans? Will you change your programming? Will you join me in the FREE 7-day challenge? All 3? Something else?\n\nIn the comments, share how you‚Äôre going to kickstart your relationship.\n\nIf you‚Äôre going to join me in the Ziglar family challenge, be sure to come back here and share your progress in the comments to this post and look out for more great posts (and a surprise podcast episode) from me!\n\nMany of you know I left my career as a corporate lawyer earlier this year to become a full-time ghostwriter and content coach. Although the point of that transition was to lean into my family life, little did I know how much that process would impact me from a relational perspective‚Ä¶.\n\nI started the transition in late 2015 after someone approached me with a manuscript by an accomplished speaker, trainer, and coach, who wanted a professional set of fingers to help him finish it in a way that made sure he served his readers well. She thought I'd be a good fit and a part of his core audience and suggested I accept this as my first big project. So I did.\n\nThe book was by Brett Campbell, who had created a 4-part framework for designing business and personal lives that he'd been using with clients and audiences through speaking engagements, live training events, and one-on-one coaching and consultants. His clients and audiences had been seeing great results.\n\nBut his challenge was to find a way to translate a message and system that was conveyed effectively on stage or the phone to something that worked well on paper, a completely different animal, and a skill I developed by writing millions of words in a professional and creative setting.\n\nOver the course of working with Brett to ensure his book delivered on the promise to give actionable, effective steps and a new perspective to accomplishing goals far larger than you would imagine are possible, I started quietly applying his system to my personal and business life.\n\n(If you know anything about me, you know that I'm constantly asking myself how I can apply business lessons to my marriage to consistently improve my relationship. Working on this book was no different.)\n\nIn the months working with Brett, I became inspired by his 4-part book and personal improvement framework to be even more deliberate with my business and personal life.\n\nBecause of that, I asked Brett to come on the Confessions of a Terrible Husband podcast to share his framework with us and talk with me about using it to improve relationships. Although Brett designed the system for more broad application to your life overall, many of you know that I'm a big proponent of asking how great systems, lessons, or content can apply specifically to improving relationships.\n\nYou can listen to the interview right here:\n\nIf you prefer, you can also listen (and subscribe) on iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, iHeartRadio, Facebook, and more, where you'll see dozens of other episodes and be able to get new ones sent right to your phone!\n\nI'm excited that Brett agreed because our conversation was so much fun and useful for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it's a great conversation about the substance of his framework and the steps you can take to improve many areas of your life. That alone is awesome.\n\nSecond, it's a great peek into how I approach great content to apply it to improving marriages. You can hear me do out loud what I normally do in my head, taking the content and applying it to relationships. You can even hear Brett react to some of that and further that discussion.\n\nDefinitely check it out, and if you want to check out Brett's book, he's doing a presale now on his website right here where he's giving away $347 in bonuses if you preorder the book. If you prefer, you can even get the book on Amazon right here. Brett's special preorder page has additional purchase options. Once you buy, send your email to Send or forward your receipt to: bonus@brettcampbell.net and if you buy it on time he'll email you the bonuses. Pretty awesome. I have already been through two of the bonuses and they're awesome.\n\nRemember, one of the most effective ways to consistently improve your marriage is to be consistently searching for new lessons and perspectives on personal improvement and asking yourself how this can apply to the most important areas of your life. If you want to get started doing that, this episode is a great example of how to do that with an even better example of a substantive 4-part framework to help you do it!\n\nWhen you have a listen, I'd love to hear what resonated with you about the framework or the process we demonstrate about applying content like this to relationships! Be sure to come back and let me know what jumped out to you in the comments!\n\nUPDATE: This post has turned into one of the most popular posts on Confessions of a Terrible Husband!

My wife and 4-year-old daughter were asleep.\n\nI was up reading.\n\nWe normally tell Pavlos when he wakes up to look at the clock and if it is before 7am he can get up, brush his teeth, and get changed, but he then has to get back into bed until at least 7.\n\nHe's pretty good with that routine.\n\nAt about 6am yesterday, I heard the thud of him jumping out of his bed followed by the pitter patter of his tiny little footsteps going from his bedroom to our bedroom.\n\nFor some reason, however, I decided to interrupt his routine yesterday.\n\n‚ÄúPavlos,‚Äù I yelled.\n\nThe footsteps stopped, and then started again, growing louder and louder as he bolted down the stairs.\n\nHe turned the corner and, as Zig Ziglar would say, smiled so wide he could eat a banana sideways.\n\nI smiled, too, said good morning, and gave him a big hug and kiss.\n\nHe knew I wasn't sending him back to bed, so he asked me if I could help him find his bag of popsicle sticks and some post-it notes because he and his friends had planted jellybeans at school and the kindergarteners kept digging them up.\n\nHe wanted to make ‚Äúflags‚Äù to put around the jellybeans so the kindergarteners would know there were plants there that the first graders were wanting to grow into lollipops.\n\nWe made flags.\n\nIt was such a fun time, with him writing ‚Äúplants here‚Äù nice and neatly on the post-its, me making some, too, and then me reinforcing the post-it notes on the sticks with scotch tape.\n\nWhen we were done, he gathered his ‚Äúflags,‚Äù put them in a ziplock bag, and stuck the ziplock bag in his backpack.\n\nHe was so excited.\n\nI then asked him if he wanted to take a walk with me.\n\nWe had never taken a walk before school, and we hadn't taken a walk at all since well before winter.\n\nWe both put on the closest gear available, him wearing bright red rain boots, the first coat he could find, and a baseball cap, and me wearing black pajama pants, a white t-shirt, a wool hat, and my winter coat.\n\nWe took a 10-15 minute walk to the end of the cul-de-sac and back.\n\nI led him in conversation a bit, but mostly let his mind wander and asked him questions about things that are important to him.\n\nWhen we got home, he grabbed the post-it notes, again, and ran to the corner of the room.\n\nI got ready for work.\n\nHe told me when I get to work to look in my backpack and ‚Äúdig deep.‚Äù\n\nI did.\n\nAt the bottom of my backpack was the crumpled post-it note you see right here.\n\nI called my wife to let her know about the note because I knew she would find it cute.\n\nShe told the kids that I was on the phone and to say hi.\n\nPavlos yelled in the background:\n\n‚ÄúHi Dad! I had a great time with you this morning!‚Äù\n\nThe sincerity and joy in his voice were obvious.\n\nI melted.\n\nThen I paused.\n\nThen I realized that I sometimes let my mind speed through the day, racing through the minutes and hours like an athlete training to win the next race. I spend the whole day focused on what I need to do next to accomplish a goal I have set for my personal or professional life.\n\nI stick to my routine, wanting to finish my reading goal, have a certain amount of quiet time, or otherwise just continue according to my ‚Äúplan.‚Äù\n\nI spend the whole day focused on what I need to do next to accomplish some personal or business goal months or years out.\n\nOther times, I slow down and realize that I'm already winning, right now, in ways that are way more important than whatever comes next.\n\nHow can you slow down today?\n\nWhat can you interrupt?\n\nWhat can you say yes to?\n\nHow are you already winning in ways that are more important than whatever comes next?\n\nListen Here:\n\nThink back to your last argument with your spouse.\n\nAlmost without exception couples who have been married more than ten minutes will have at least one story where a discussion turned into an argument.\n\nThey said something they didn't mean.\n\nThey focused more on being right than achieving or solving something together.\n\nOr they don't even remember what they were arguing about, but just remember arguing about something.\n\nFor some couples, we're talking looking back a matter of hours. Others days, weeks, or months.\n\nBut as strange as it seems to terrible husbands like me, some couples have gone years or even decades without arguing.\n\nGet this. They have ‚Äúconversations‚Äù instead.\n\nAnd not ‚Äúair quotes‚Äù conversations. Actual, productive, calm, respectful conversations to resolve differences in opinions, goals, or plans, for the good of the marriage.\n\nSure, it's normal to argue. But that doesn't mean it should be accepted as part of ‚Äúreal life.‚Äù\n\nWhich is why eliminating arguments from my marriage, something we haven't been completely successful at doing yet, is my next big focus on becoming a better husband and creating a marriage worth modeling.\n\nThe more I study, it seems as if one secret to having a marriage free from arguments is to have a marriage full of love, respect, and perspective.\n\nWork those three concepts into your mind, body language, and words and you will be well on your way to reducing or eliminating arguments from your marriage.\n\nYou will treat ‚Äúissues‚Äù differently. It will become less personal. Less emotional. More conversational.\n\nDon't take it from me, though. You can hear it straight from a great friend of the blog, Fawn Weaver, of the Happy Wives Club, (and the first guest on the Confessions of a Terrible Husband podcast), who recently shared her story of achieving an argument-free marriage in a Ted Talk.\n\nShe also has a brand-new book coming out called The Argument-Free Marriage: 28 Days to Creating the Marriage You've Always Wanted with the Spouse You Already Have, which I encourage you to check out, particularly because of the whole ‚Äúspouse you already have‚Äù angle‚Ä¶ because without that things could get pretty awkward over the next 28 days‚Ä¶.so‚Ä¶.\n\nHow does Fawn Weaver ‚Äì the happy wife from The Happy Wives Club ‚Äì keep arguments out of her marriage?\n\nAs you will see, she doesn't give up her identity. She doesn't give up her opinions. She doesn't give up her hopes or dreams.\n\nHer secret is a heavy dose of perspective. Here's her talk. I'll let her explain. Let me know what you think in the comments.\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nIs it possible to have a marriage free from arguments?\n\nHave you been able to reduce or eliminate arguments from your marriage?\n\nWhat has worked best for you?\n\nAnd once again, be sure to check out Fawn's book and make the next 28 days the catalyst for an incredible marriage!"
