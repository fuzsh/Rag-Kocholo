        "text": "On Showtime’s Dexter, evil doers should be afraid of Michael C. Hall. He’ll slice them up into little pieces and deposit them into the ocean.\n\nIn real life, though, it’s an awful disease that should have known better than to mess with this incredible actor.\n\nHall released a statement today that said: “I feel fortunate to have been diagnosed with an imminently treatable and curable condition (Hodgkin’s lymphoma), and I thank my doctors and nurses for their expertise and care.”\n\nHis spokesman, Craig Bankey, said his client is in remission, but will continue with scheduled treatments.\n\nWe wish Hall the absolute best – and can’t wait to see how he takes this pain out on various bad guys next season on Dexter."
