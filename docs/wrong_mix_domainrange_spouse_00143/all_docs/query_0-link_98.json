But what if The Warden is female? Who would be the actor? --Rocketai (talk) 05:01, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nDeborah Ann Woll? (Jessica from True Blood- 'cuz she's smokin'!)LVTDUDE (talk) 05:07, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCorrection! Summer Glau would be my female Warden.LVTDUDE (talk) 05:12, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHmmm... Summer Glau to make a female human Noble/Mage? I don't think it fits... Of course, The Warden can be anyone! From Meryl Streep to Dakota Blue Richards! --Rocketai (talk) 05:21, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nJack Black would be hilarious as Oghren. Don't ya think? The female could be Jessica Biel. She did some physical stuff in Blade 3. LVTDUDE (talk) 05:24, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHaha, agreed... Or John Rhys-Davies! The same actor that played as Gimli back on The Lord of the Rings. --Rocketai (talk) 05:29, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNice cast, but you have to keep in mind that the more A-List Actors you have the bigger the budget for the movie is going to be. And, I do not think any Studio would be willing to put up e kind of coin it would take for those A-Listers you have, but it would be great if they did. Anya (talk)05:41, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nUmm, this isn't going to happen. I didn't think realism would matter, otherwise we'd be casting the film with friends and family and we'd be shooting at the local park- with plastic weapons. LVTDUDE (talk) 12:11, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI'm impressed nobody chose Tim Curry to play Howe, seeing as he looks the part (if he lost a bit of weight) and he was the voice of Howe in DA:O!\n\nI didn't see Arl Eamon anywhere. I'm thinking Morgan Freeman would be good for that role.\n\nThe Warden........................................................Christian Bale\n\nLoghain...........................................................Liam Neson\n\nDuncan............................................................Johnny Depp\n\nEamon.............................................................Harrison Ford\n\nAlistair...............................Bradley Cooper (it works if u think about it and look at him)\n\nMorrigan..........................................................Kiera Knightly\n\nHowe..............................................................Tim Curry\n\nKing Calian............................................Danial Craig (or Maric for a flashback or sumthing)\n\nWynne.............................................................Helen Miran\n\nFlemeth...........................................................Meryl Streep\n\nLeliana...........................................................Eva Green (with red hair)\n\nSten..............................................................probaly CGI\n\nKoligram..........................................................Gerard Butlar\n\nZevern............................................................Antonio Banderas (20 trs ago lol)\n\nQueen Anora.......................................................Kate Bosworth or Kristen Bell --Kingkain21 (talk) 07:50, August 4, 2010 (UTC)KingKain21\n\nI’m not that much into movies and actors (I guess it’s an American thing) but I diffidently like the idea about seeing DA:O on the big screen. Only problem, we can only have one warden, most of you had a role list with a warden of every origin, but how would that even work? We need to chose one, and for all that’s holy I can’t figure out which one that would be best. Perhaps any of you have a suggestion about which one would work best.\n\nOh an Anyamarie, Miley Cyrus as Leliana, seriously dud, seriously. Miley Cyrus! Seriously? I’m not even going to comment of that, I’m just going to refer you to this: “South.Park.S12E02 Britney's New Look” -rphb- (talk) 08:29, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe idea even remotely but interesting would be great, though I would like it even more if it were made digitial like \"Final Fantasy: The spirits within\", that way they can make it look as real as possible and with the original actors and actresses like the trailer of the urn of sacred ashes for their voices, besides what origin could it be told?. Its a nice idea and one can only hope that the franchise would get to that hight of popularity to make a movie and not to be lame like Mario bros hehehe.--Anthonior(talk)\n\nI have to agree with rphb about the Miley, but perhaps people on this forum is younger then expected. My choice for a warden would bed a female city elf, actor Liv Tyler, she has already proven to be a pretty elf in Lord of the rings. And for Leliana find a pretty red haired french girl age 30 who speaks english, they are plenty. --PeterR (talk) 10:00, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI don't like or watch South Park, so I threw in Miley Cyrus in there mainly because she sings and is young enough to compliment the new Wardens, but I am sure there are others who could play the part. Picking just one origin would not do any film about Dragon Age justice, so you have to have all of them and they have to be Unknowns or D-List Actors to keep the budget of the film down, though if the film was made digital like Final Fantasy then some A-List Actors could work for the roles. I could have casted every single role, but that would have taken up too much space and time, so I chose just a few to post. Now if some one wants to do a complete casting feel free to do so. Anya (talk)10:46, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nAnimated only... no poorly decided cast pleazzz -gse\n\nSorry but i saw the name Miley Cyrus and nearly vomited. She is a crap actor. and Kiera Knightly as morrigan? she has no chest XD! PinkOldShoes (talk) 13:19 04/08/2010\n\nI think the warden will be male due to the fact that all the trailers for DAO are all male warriors so this indicates that most likely the warden would be a male human noble and the how could milary cirus be leliana! i think i could do better! I also agree with the person who said Morgan freeman would be good with the role of arl eamon i think he would be perfect for that role beacuse he is such a calm actor User Talk:Domlen Cousland14:45,August 4, 2010\n\nI don't think the budget needs to be low, making a film of DA:O could not only be a succes if done properly, but would also be a great commercial for the seting it self. Of course it could backfire terrible if the movie becomes a flop. Personally I am not a fan of Final fantasy and I think that it would be a bad idea making an animated movie that is supposed to look real, it makes it look fake, Miley Cyrus fake.\n\nNo the best thing would be to use relative unknown actors to keep the budget down, but still not be so cheep as to spare on the special effects. The one to play Zevran bust be from Spain, not Hispanic South America, Spain. Leliana's actor from France, and most of the rest from England. Finding good relativly unknown actors from across the world that are still somewhat known in their own countries would really ad to the fantasy setting, a known actor would steel to much attention.\n\nThe really big problem is which origin will be the one the warden in the film will have. We have twelve options, six origens times two genders.\n\nA female warden can have a romance with Alastair with conflicting feelings for Zevran. A male on the other hand, can led to a very interesting showdown between Morrigan and Leliana. I imagine him being to gutless to chose or really going all the way with either of them, leading to some nasty cat-fights between them. Can you imagine that?\n\nThe ending itself it is almost as difficult, will the warden sacrifice him/herself, take the ritual or let Loghain take the final blow, I wont for a minute consider letting Alastair take it, I hope you all agree.\n\nWhile the origin is completely impossible a question also arises as to what the movie should be focusing on. Runing after the warden as (s)he completes the quests would be too trivial. However I hope you can agree with me that the best way to solve the main quests is: To Save the Circle, all of Eamons family, cure the werewolf’s of their curse and make Bhelen king.\n\nI diffidently feel that Loghain should have more camera time and Ser Cauthrien as well, but must of all that deliciously evil Rendon Howe.\n\nWhowever what I think would work best, is if we instead of making it a movie, make a serial with these episodes.\n\n1) Origin and Ostagar, ends with the Orge’s defeat and Loghains retreat.\n\n2) Lothering to first visit to the party camp\n\n3) Circle Tower\n\n4) Redcliffe\n\n5) Brecilian Forest\n\n6) Orzammar\n\n7) Orzammar continued\n\n8) Denerim\n\n9) Urn of Andraste\n\n10) Howe!\n\n11) Elven Alienage and the Landsmeet\n\n12) Endgame Part I\n\n13) Endgame Part II\n\nAny DLC may or may not be introduced depending on the budged and number of episodes in the Serial. The Stone Prisoner is the one I consider most important, Return to Ostagar the second, they can be introduced anywhere before 10, when it is time for the landsmeet I really don’t think that there will be room for random questing if the serial wants to keep its momentum.\n\n---rphb- (talk) 14:01, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSeveral problems would accure if you try to make a movie to similar to the game. You would have a lot of important characters, far to many for those i dont know the DAO universe. You would have to many locations confusing for those who dont know the game, borring for those who do, because they/we dont see anything new. Yo could make a origins to grey warden to ... to killing the archdemon story but the ... would have be something new.\n\nRemember the movie will a lenght of 3 hours at the very most a quickplay of DAO takes more then 20 hours if you know the game. Also remember DAO isn't Lord of the rings, so there will be much fewer money and much fewer who is going to see DAO the movie, i dont think there will be an option to e.g. make three movies. I persanally like the idea of animation but perhaps more shrek-like then FF-like. I dont like the anime idea however.\n\nOne note there is seven origin stories human mage and elven mage is not exactly the same, hence two slightly different origins. --PeterR (talk) 14:14, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYeah, The Warden can be anyone since there are six origins, two genders and three races. --Rocketai (talk) 16:28, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI've got a better idea; why not let 3D models be the characters, let voice actors speak for them, and let film celebrities, if they want to play a video game character, audition for it like anyone else. I don't see how sitting and watching a passive medium will do anything to improve my experience of an interactive one. DokEnkephalin (talk) 16:46, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI think it's about the novelty enjoyment of selecting a cast for a movie about the game. Reminds me of L4D with the load screen of Zoey played by such-and-such. It's a lot of fun in my opinion. I didn't come up with everyone, but here's what I think, and I included a movie or tv show since actors sometime's have a very wide range of characters and some would work better than others:\n\nMorrigan played by Eva Green (Casino Royale)\n\nEven though it doesn't fit at all, Duncan gratuitously played by Gerard Butler (300)\n\nZevran played by Johnny Depp (I don't know, but he's awesome...maybe once upon a time in mexico?)\n\nLeliana played by Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil to some extent, and she speaks fluent French)\n\nSten also gratuitously played by Mickey Rourke (Sin City)\n\nSpirit of the Forest played by Angelina Jolie (Beowulf)\n\nLoghain played by Mel Gibson (Braveheart and he's pretty disliked already) or Russell Crowe (Gladiator)\n\nHowe played by Gary Oldman Rtalencar (talk) 17:15, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI think it would translate better if instead of a movie it was made as a Cable T.V show on a movie channel (HBO, Showtime, Starz ect...)The story would get very watered down in a 2 hour long movie but if each episode was 1 hour long and it was say 13 or 14 episodes most of the DAO story would get told.\n\nI think that making a movie about the story of the old Blights would be better. I think we all here know how \"great\" and generic movies-from-games turn out to be, specially on fantasy. They would make the darkspawn extremelly human-like, and only Alistair and Morrigan would be recruited, the Warden would be a Human Noble Warrior badass ('cuz the main character in those movies is AWAYS human, even if he originaly was a elf) and he would bed Morrigan like halfway in the film in a ridiculous scene. He would kill the werewolfs AND the elves, let the king who paid him best take the throne of Orzammar, would forget about Redcliff and let the Templars destroy the Circle of Magi, 'cuz his a badass. Meaning, terrible movie. So a prequel is the best bet, they would have greater freedom to make it. The Bard From Hell (talk) 18:42, August 4, 2010 (UTC) The Bard From Hell\n\nAgreed... If they are going to make a movie based on Dragon Age, it would be most likely a male human noble badass and it would destroy the game... Would be better if they make a movie based on The Stolen Throne or The Calling. --Rocketai (talk) 21:47, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThey're already making a Dragon Age movie. Though some may not like this, it's going to be an anime movie made collaboratively by BioWare and FUNimation Entertainment. Back in June I asked David Gaider if he was writing it, sadly he's not (sad I know), but he and the other writers are working with those that are to make sure they get the lore right. It's supposed to be a direct to DVD movie for release some time in 2011. --Aedan Cousland (talk) 19:36, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSo long they don't screw it all up with this movie, I'll probably like. People usually think that videogames are a waste of time, even more if there's a bad or \"silly\" movie conected to it. The Bard From Hell (talk) 19:39, August 4, 2010 (UTC) The Bard From Hell\n\nDA:O is so animated anyway but something I have always dreamed of is a movie based on Baldur's Gate, I think an animated serial would be best, at least to test the water, a real movie could be made later if the cartoon turns into a hit, while DA:O is good, it still can't top the story and atmosphere of good old BG.-rphb- (talk) 20:37, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nBetty White is Flemeth.\n\nAfter reading all of these post I realized that I was wrong in suggesting just one film. Now if BioWare teamed up with one of the major Studios(Paramount, Fox, Universal, ect...) and one of the Cable Networks(HBO, Showtime, Stars, ect...) and instead of doing several films on the game which they would have to do they did a Maxi or Mini Series based on the game, then they could have all the Origins as well as the various places the Wardens travel to. Anya (talk)21:38, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nMeryl Streep should be Flemeth! --Rocketai (talk) 22:28, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI think if they made this into a TV series there would be 4 origins all introduced at the same time. The human noble rogue (male), a dwarven noble warrior, a female human mage and a male elven rogue. The party would consist of these characters, Alistair, Morrigan and Leliana. Leliana would be a love interest for the human noble and the female mage would be a love interest for Alistair. The irony being that she is a mage and he a templar. She would also be sympathetic to Alistair, while Morrigan is berating the heck out of him. The male elf wouldn't have a love interest until the very end, as his marriage just went bad, and they would have to work up to that over a longer period (heck, maybe he didn't want to be married, turns out to be a homosexual and ends up with Zevran- plot twist!) Sten, Oghren, Wynne and Zevran would be the focal points of single episodes or possibly arcs of a few episodes, but not major players. The initial 2 hour episode would cover the 4 origins and climax with them meeting up with Duncan and Alistair at Ostagar.LVTDUDE (talk) 22:50, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI was thinking that the male human noble would go for Morrigan because Alistair and Morrigan are important characters in the game while the others are most secondary. Yeah, the irony is interesting in the series... A female human mage who grown up in the Circle being surrounded by Templars, being watched every step, every move you do and she falls in love with a templar. Oh, I do so love the irony. --Rocketai (talk) 23:04, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI'm also going on the assumption that like Luke and Leia, Morrigan and Alistair are related (though not quite as closely) and though there may be some tension between the two, maybe even attraction, they wouldn't end up together. Besides, Morrigan has to eventually leave and make her way in the world- with or without OGB. LVTDUDE (talk) 23:34, August 4, 2010 (UTC)\n\nb\n\nI don't like the idea of introducing several wardens at once, it makes it too confusing, if there is anything I have learned from writing it is the principle \"cut your darling\" you need to get rid of everything unnecessary, even if you love it, almost especially if you do.\n\nMaking a movie or a serial based on DA:O could easily turn out to be a disaster, many of my favourite books have been completely ruined when they tried to make it into a movie. A book or a game can hold many more details then a film can, trying to force to much into it will just make it confusing and blurry. I don’t think that DA:O could possibly be a movie, you can’t cut that much off without losing the meaning. It can be made into a serial, but even then it would pretty much just tell the same story as the one we can already see in the game.\n\nThe solution: Make a movie in the DA universe that tells a related story to the one in DA:O, one that can stand on its own, without being confusing for these that know nothing of the DA universe, but with lots of pointers that would make it extra interesting for these that do.\n\nThe script should be written by David Gaider to make sure that it is of high quality and involve classical themes like “an intolerant dogmatic church” (The Chantry), betrayal, love, and desperation. The movie could tell the story of Liselle the Orlaiseean flower merchant in Denerim Market District, it could also focus on one of the companions in the game at an earlier stage in his or her life, like Zevran for instance, or Leliana. It could also tell the story of a completely unknown character that just happens to live in the same world. A dwarven castles for instance or an Alienage elf.\n\nI can see it now. Leviria is a young elf, she and her family have been in the services of Bann Esmerelle for many seasons, it has been tough and they had to accept much indignation but when she one day come home to her humble shark in the woods behind the Bann’s castle, she discoverer the bann’s eldest son, the powerful and strong lord Baily raping her kid sister with their old father beaten to a plum in the corner, she snaps. Harvesting power she didn’t know she had, she summons a powerful lightning ball that strikes the lord, killing him instantly.\n\nAs a murderer and an Apostate she and her kid sister Lily fleas Amaranthine. Hunted by zealous templar and the notorious assassins (Antivan Crows) send by the vengeful bann, they tries to find a place where they can be free of persecution. .\n\n---rphb- (talk) 10:24, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell if you are going to go that route then how about this, someone spies on the Joining Ritual then as Duncan and Allister are bent over your Warden, that person takes the Joining Chalice and Drinks from it and becomes an Unofficial Grey Warden. Or they Could have been mistaken about Daveth and he somehow survived, but was only in a coma, he awakes after the battle and the Darkspawn are leaving, he discovers the bodies of Duncan and Cailain on the battle field and thinks he is the only Grey Warden left, remembering the treaties they recovered, he sets off to gather the army he will need to defeat the Darkspawn, he then learns about Allister and you from Flemeth and sets off to find you, but you are one step ahead of him. Until the final battle when you and Allister meet him just before the ArchDemon is killed. Anya (talk)14:28, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nKeanu Reeves for Sten. As a voice actor alone, since it'd be kind of hard to pull off Sten with his build. ReaperZ (talk) 14:49, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI think Morrigan should be played by Claudia Black and Flemeth should be played by Kate Mulgrew. They are both great actresses and they will sound the same too.\n\nI love Claudia Black, but I don't know if she can pull off the role of a 20-something anymore. Although, I'm being a bit hypocritical as I put Nathan Fillion in the role of Alistair. Nathan Fillion is so awesome though, he should have a part in all my favorite shows. LVTDUDE (talk) 17:30, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nNo Anyamarie that would just be another way to retelling the story that have already been tolled in DA:O. Rocketai is right, scroll op to his post about “Greet” movie and Badass human noble warden. A movie based on the story in DA:O would end up like he describes, and it would be just terrible, and not just Miley Cyrus terrible either, “Pirate’s of the Carbines” terrible.\n\nNow about Daveth, it’s an interesting perceptive, but it won’t work as a movie, it won’t. It can work as a DLC, making Daveth another recruitable character, but even then I think it would be milking it.\n\nMy idea was to make a movie in the universe, about a completely unrelated story. Like the story about the elf girl Leviria that just have found out that she is a mage and is now being hunted for the murder of her patrons son, in a desperate attempt to reach the Dalish. That story has everything: Injustice, suppression, desperation and drama. It would be closely related to the universe, also taking place in Ferelden, but taking place before the Blight, before the pc becomes a warden. The story holds the possibility of including characters we already know, like Howe, Loghaim and Maric but it won’t interfere with anything we do in DA:O and would really just be about two sisters escape to freedom, not an epic battle against an arch demon.\n\nThis story holds the potential of being made into a movie, we can expand or cut it as we will depending on the amount of reference to DA:O we want it to have. We can tell another story if we want, but a movie in the DA universe, cannot be about the event in DA:O, course that have already been tolled, it need not be said twice.\n\n-rphb- (talk) 17:27, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nPersonally I would prefer a Dragon Age TV Series. It would give the writers more time to develop and flesh out the characters, story and setting. We don’t want a repeat of The Last Airbender do we? Also, if a studio were to make a Dragon Age movie with just the main story it would still be longer than Return of the King. Anyway, here is who I think would be good as the characters from the game. This cast list is from a Dragon Age Series where the Warden is male and from the Circle Mage Origin.\n\nDuncan …… Viggo Mortenson\n\nThe Warden …… Christian Bale\n\nAlistair …… Chris Pine\n\nLeliana …… Gemma Aterton\n\nMorrigan …… Eva Green\n\nOghren …… Ray Winstone\n\nSten …… Michael Clarke Duncan\n\nWynne …… Meryl Streep\n\nZevran …… Neil Patrick Harris\n\nArl Eamon…… Gary Oldman\n\nKing Cailan Therin…… Jensen Ackles\n\nTeyrn Loghain Mac Tir…… Mark Strong\n\nFlemeth…… Kate Mulgrew\n\nArl Rendon Howe…… Tim Curry\n\nJowan…… James Franco\n\nVoice of Shale …… James Earl Jones\n\nAnd here is who I think would be a good cast in a spin off show based on Awakening:\n\nSeneschal Varel …… Liam Neeson\n\nAnders…… Anton Yelchin\n\nMhari…… Emma Stone\n\nNathaniel Howe…… Sam Worthington\n\nJustice…… Patrick Stewart\n\nSigrun…… Ellen Page\n\nValanna…… Allison Mack\n\nVoice of the Architect…… Ralph Fiennes\n\n--JackfieldsA113 (talk) 18:51, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI think Helen Mirren would be better as Wynne... And Kate Mulgrew?! The actress who made Kathryn Janeway on Star Trek Voyager?! I love that series... --Rocketai (talk) 18:55, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nggg I like Janeway too. But back to topic.\n\nI think a CGI Movie will be the best. Someone mentioned Final Fantasy, but therefore I would put the attation on \"Final Fantasy: Advence Children\". This was just great. I have seen many films with reference to computer game (Dungeons and Dragons and so on) and they all were all very poor (maybe someone could assinate Uwe Boll *ggg) I like the idea to introduce all kind of wardens, but there is the problem to make it in one movie. A TV Series could handle thisFinnyanne (talk) 19:28, August 5, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI was thinking that if some of us got together and used the cut scene editor in the toolset, we could make our own film. Anya (talk)00:25, August 6, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe only problem with running a series you would end up with something like \"Lengend of the Seeker\". I think the best actors would be unknown. To many of todays actors are prima donnas and would cost to much to cast. The series could be set as the origin and ending with the archdemon to finish off the series. Some of the ultimate battles can be used as series high point. The Orign and talking with Duncan would be the first show then the Kocari Wilds and so on. LiF LostInFangorn (talk) 23:48, August 6, 2010 (UTC)LiF\n\n@Anya: I could handle the toolset within the first Neverwinter Nights edition, after this.... I get lost. And please do not underestimate (hopping I use the right vocabulary here) the time you have to invest just for creating a simple weapon on the toolset. I have the highest respect for the people, who are creatin such mods like Highever Castle.\n\nDuncan: Liam Neeson\n\nCailan: Hugh Jackman\n\nLoghain: Christian Bale\n\nSten: Michael Clarke Duncan\n\nAlistair: His voice actor, Steve Valentine\n\nOghren: Danny DeVito\n\nZathrian: Nicolas Cage\n\nIrving: Christopher Lee\n\nGreagoir: Gerard Butler\n\nI think\n\nRussel Brand would be a great Anders, and anyone think Vin Diesel would fit into anywhere? Elbryan the Nightbird (talk) 20:39, August 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI don't know a whole lot of actors, but here's a few I think would fit well:\n\nMorrigan: Claudia Black (she voices her in the game and plays a sort of similar character in StarGate SG-1 as Vala Malderan)\n\nAlistair: Ben Browder (he plays in a lot of the same shows as Claudia Black, including SG-1, where he plays an Alistair-like character named Mitchell)\n\nDuncan: Liam Neesan (why? because he's awesome)\n\nLoghain: Jonny Depp (not too sure about this one, but he looks about right and might could pull it off)\n\nGameMasterZX | There is no ignorance, there is GameFAQs. 20:54, August 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI also think Rufus Sewell would be a cool as Loghain, he is good at acting as a bad guy. Elbryan the Nightbird (talk) 21:01, August 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI cast Rufus Sewell as Duncan, but I'm sure he'd be a convincing Loghain. However, I used Christian Bale as Loghain. Why? Well, nothing plays crazy better than crazy, I say. Most of the actors I cast I didn't even have to think about. Take Daveth. I'd love him to have a bigger part in the story, just so Calum Blue could play the crap out of his part. Anyone that has seen \"Dead Like Me\" could appreciate how Blue's delivery would be perfect for the witty Daveth. LVTDUDE (talk) 23:38, August 7, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHere are a couple of sites you need to look at when doing your casting for the DAO movie The Celebrity 100 and Are celebrities overpaid?. Then you will see why Unknown Actors is the way to go for the parts of the Wardens and have some known Actors play some of the supporting roles. Anya (talk)00:42, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI'm going on the assumption that we are casting the ideal actors, since THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. They're doing an anime' movie. This thread is purely fantasy. LVTDUDE (talk) 02:43, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSo? It is fun to think about it and you get to put your favorite actors into rolls you would like to see them in, or ones you think they would be good at. Elbryan the Nightbird (talk) 03:16, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYes it is fun, that is why I started this thread. And, if I has 1 billion dollars I would cast every A-List Actor I could get and either Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, David Lynch, Tim Burton, Werner Herzog, Michael Bay, Martin Scorsese, Christopher Nolan or Frank Oz to direct the film. Of course if I wanted to make it a comedy I would get Mel Brooks and do it right. Anya (talk)03:34, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThat would be awesome, i would definitely do that. Elbryan the Nightbird (talk) 04:52, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI never said it wasn't fun. I just was stating that there's no reason to limit who you could have in certain roles if it's never going to happen anyway. LVTDUDE (talk) 04:56, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nYes there is, because its interesting think about if it DID happen, I'm not saying it will but you never know... Elbryan the Nightbird (talk) 05:07, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nWell, if we were to go on the assumption that this actually had a snowball's chance in hell of happening, it would be on the Syfy channel, and the top actor you could get would probably be Michael Shanks. You might get Jeremy Irons, as he doesn't seem to mind being an A-list guy doing less than A-level movies. Other than that, you'd get a bunch of sci-fi/fantasy retreads (Rhona Mitra, etc., etc.) Then we could all rule out 80% of the actors listed above and this would be a boring thread. You either have to allow anyone and everyone to be considered (fantasy) or severely limit who would possibly do this (reality), you can't have it both ways. LVTDUDE (talk) 06:05, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nI can't understand why you are still talking about this, didn't we all come to the agreement that a DA:O movie is a bad idea, that the story is too complex to be compressed to 1,5 hour and that it wont ad anything anyway, as we have already completed it in game form. If a movie is going to be made in Thedas it would be about something else then the fifth blight, that could be cool, very much unlike an exact replica of the game, which would properly redefine the word \"lame\". -rphb- (talk) 12:01, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nThe OP asked, \"who would play\" not \"who is going to play?\" It's just a hypothetical question. Of course, everyone here has to get all worked up that it might actually happen, and starts adding rules to the actor assignments. Heck, I think I'll have Heath Ledger play Alistair. LVTDUDE (talk) 13:29, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nCan humphrey Bogart also get a part, and why don't we let William Shakespeare do the directing? And we can get Plato to write the dialogue. Don't worry about the finance, I'll pay for everything course I'm the Queen of Sheba-rphb- (talk) 14:36, August 8, 2010 (UTC)'\n\nAs long as I can have Dom DeLuise play shale, we're good. Come to think of it, maybe we should start the \"all-dead\" DAO cast thread. LVTDUDE (talk) 16:03, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nSarcasm is totally wasted on you isn't it? -rphb- (talk) 18:56, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nHow about Merlym Monroe for Leliana? The Bard From Hell (talk) 18:59, August 8, 2010 (UTC) The Bard From Hell\n\nHeck no, I'm enjoying the sarcasm! Which is why I'm also recommending that if we're going to cast Merlym Monroe for a part, we should ask her twin sister Marilyn to join in, too. LVTDUDE (talk) 19:58, August 8, 2010 (UTC)\n\nOoops! I'm terrible with names! I can barely remember my own sometimes! Kidding 'bout the part concernin' my name The Bard From Hell (talk) 20:39, August 8, 2010 (UTC)The Bard From Hell\n\nThe Warden: UKN Actor\n\n- Duncan: Sean Bean - Alistair: Chris Pine - Morrigan: Lena Headey - Flemeth: Kate Mulgrew - King Cailan: Sam Worthington - Wynne: Helen Mirren - Loghain: Liam Neeson - Leliana: Gemma Arterton - Shale: Geraldine Blecker (voice) - Sten: Djimon Hounsou - Arl Eamon: Jeremy Irons - Lady Isolde: Cate Blanchett - Queen Anora: Keira Knightley - Zevran: Orlando Bloom - Oghren: Steve Blum - Bann Teagan:Jake Gyllenhaal - Arl Howe: Ian McKellen King Cousland\n\nI am gonna have to go with the option of most if not all of the actors being European actors. i think that the mainstream actors would demand too much money and fuck it up!! I also think that the Warden should be a woman. So that the mael warden is not overshadowing Alistair! I think that the concept of having a small love triangle between The Warden, Alistair and Zev is a great idea. Hopefully she picks Alistair. What the hell kinda future is there with Zevran?05:48, August 9, 2010 (UTC)~~RhiannonCousland."
