        "text": "San Diego Comic-Con 2021, the second Comic-Con@Home edition of the beloved pop culture event, kicks off its three-day run Friday.\n\nThe free online event, which runs through Sunday, isn’t anywhere near as packed with panels as the famed in-person SDCC usually is, but a decent number of studios and networks will still be hosting Q&As and digital screenings for their TV shows and movies.\n\nAs TheWrap reported exclusively earliest this month, HBO (which did present at the 2020 event) will be skipping this year’s online con, but its sibling streaming service HBO Max is presenting a virtual event for the show, “gen:LOCK.”\n\nOther notable absentees from the second (and hopefully last) pandemic-forced virtual San Diego Comic-Con include Marvel Studios and DC Films, both of which did not attend the first Comic-Con@Home last year.\n\nSan Diego Comic-Con International plans to return Comic-Con to an in-person event in the summer of 2022, with a smaller special edition convention set for Thanksgiving weekend this fall.\n\nSee below for the date, time and descriptions for all of 2021 Comic-Con@Home’s must-see TV and film-centric panels.
