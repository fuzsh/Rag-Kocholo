        "text": "Legends of Tomorrow is an American television series, developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim, Phil Klemmer, and Andrew Kreisberg, based on several characters from DC Comics. The series premiered in the United States on January 21, 2016, for The CW television network, and it finished its first season on May 19, 2016. The second season premiered in October 2016 and ended in April 2017. The third season premiered in October 2017 and concluded in April 2018, while the fourth season premiered in October 2018 and wrapped up in April 2019. The fifth season premiered in January 2020 and finished in June 2020.\n\nLegends of Tomorrow's first season follows Time Master Rip Hunter (Arthur Darvill) in his mission to stop Vandal Savage (Casper Crump) from killing his wife and child and destroying the world. To help him, he forms a team of Legends consisting of Martin Stein (Victor Garber) and Jefferson Jackson (Franz Drameh) / Firestorm, Ray Palmer / The Atom (Brandon Routh), Sara Lance / White Canary (Caity Lotz), Kendra Saunders / Hawkgirl (Ciara Renée), Carter Hall / Hawkman (Falk Hentschel), Mick Rory / Heat Wave (Dominic Purcell), and Leonard Snart / Captain Cold (Wentworth Miller); with the A.I. Gideon (Amy Pemberton) providing assistance. By the end of the season, Snart sacrifices himself to save the Legends and Kendra and Carter depart following Savage's defeat.\n\nThe second season focuses on the remaining Legends fixing \"aberrations\" in time as well as confronting the Legion of Doom, composed of Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash (Matt Letscher), Damien Darhk (Neal McDonough), Malcolm Merlyn (John Barrowman) and a time-displaced Snart. Along the way, they are joined by historian Nate Heywood / Steel (Nick Zano) and Justice Society of America member Amaya Jiwe / Vixen (Maisie Richardson-Sellers). Though the Legends defeat the Legion, they accidentally destroy time and Rip disappears under mysterious circumstances.\n\nThe third season sees the Legends repairing anachronisms across the timestream. In addition, they also face opposition from Rip's Time Bureau and a demonic entity called Mallus (John Noble), whose disciple, Nora Darhk (Courtney Ford), has resurrected her father Damien and Amaya's future granddaughter Kuasa (Tracy Ifeachor). Though the team loses Stein and Jackson, they gain new allies in computer hacker Zari Tomaz (Tala Ashe), speedster Wally West / Kid Flash (Keiynan Lonsdale), and Time Bureau agents Ava Sharpe (Jes Macallan) and Gary Green (Adam Tsekhman). In the end, Rip dies fighting Mallus while Amaya and Wally depart following the demon's defeat.\n\nIn the fourth season, the Legends must capture a group of mythical creatures that were released when they freed Mallus. Along the way, they must also stop the demon Neron from unleashing Hell on Earth. The team is joined by occult detective John Constantine (Matt Ryan), shapeshifting fugitive Charlie (Maisie Richardson-Sellers), Kaupe Mona Wu (Ramona Young), and a reformed Nora. After changing the timeline while defeating Neron, Zari is erased from the team and replaced by her brother, Behrad Tarazi (Shayan Sobhian).\n\nIn the fifth season, the Legends track down and stop evil historical figures called \"Encores\" after they are resurrected by Astra Logue (Olivia Swann), whom Constantine accidentally sent to Hell. Along the way, they discover Charlie is actually Clotho of the Fates, who is being hunted by her sisters, Lachesis (Sarah Strange) and Atropos (Joanna Vanderham), for destroying the Loom of Fate. Though Mona leaves the Legends to start her writing career and Ray and Nora also leave after getting married, Ava and Gary join the team after the Time Bureau gets shut down, the new Zari from the changed timeline joins them, and Astra ends up joining the team after the Fates betrayed her. The team regains their memories of the old Zari when they learn she has been transported to the World Between Worlds in the Air Totem however she can't co-exist with her counterpart for too long as her timeline will bleed into the new one, risking Behrad's life. After defeating her sisters, Charlie departs to reunite with her old band.\n\nIn the sixth season, the Legends deal with rescuing Sara from the scientist human shapeshifter Bishop (Raffi Barsoumian) while dealing with alien creatures released by Sara in different times. The team is joined by alien hunter Esperanza Cruz (Lisseth Chavez). Zari Tomaz learns she can switch places with her counterpart in the Air Totem, allowing her to rejoin the team on a part-time basis and continue dating Nate. John and Mick depart following Bishop's defeat.\n\nIn the seventh (and final) season, the team fights their very own Waverider. After Bishop (pre-villain) is returned to his time with his memory wiped, he wakes with a hard drive containing Gideon. After removing her \"humanity protocol\" (installed by Rip Hunter), he creates \"Evil Gideon\" the antagonist of the season. After recreating the Waverider he and his \"Ava 1.0\" travel to the bridge between season 6 & 7 and destroy the Waverider marooning the legends in 1925. The team are forced to seek the help of Gwyn Davies, a scientist and World War One veteran who is also the inventor of time travel. He aids the team in their fight against Evil Gideon as he joins them after they make his time machine work properly. After defeating Evil Gideon, their robot clones and saving the life of Alun Thomas, Gwyn's best friend, who died during World War One, Nate and Zari Tomaz leave the team when Nate moves into the Air Totem with her. The rest of the team are double-crossed by the time-fixer, Mike who they met and they were all arrested by the Time Police, alongside Mike and Alun Thomas, for 'time crimes.'\n\nThe following is a list of characters that have appeared on the television series.

After the Legends killed the latter and destroyed the Loom of Fate, Lachesis imprisoned Clotho in the Museum of Bad Ideas and used Gideon to create an app based on the Loom.

When Sara found him, Bishop saved her mind when she was succumbing to the Zaguron poison and placed it in a clone body that has Kriblix DNA in it. With help from Mick and Gary, the Ava clones help Sara to shut down Bishop's operation. Kayla later downloaded 94% of Bishop's genome into the Waverider so that he can create a new body. While kept prisoner, Bishop was able to override Gideon due to the other 6% of his genome coming from Sarah. He assisted in delivering Kayla's eggs from Mick's head declaring them the latest members of the Legends. Afterwards, Bishop returns to his confinement while secretly contacting him about helping to restore his magic. While Constantine didn't go with the deal, his dark side took Bishop's offer.

After Mick stepped on Lord Knoxicrillion much to the dismay of the Legends, Mick gathers what they learned from him and states that they should look for Kayla so that she can take them to Sara. She was later found in Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis where the Cubans mistook her for the United States' mutant soldiers. When she was freed by the Legends, Kayla put on her Image Inducer ring and agreed to take Mick to where Sara is. Kayla helps to rescue Sara and buys them time to get away from the Zagurons. It was later discovered that Kayla used her tentacles to lay eggs in Mick's ear. Kayla survived the Zaguron attacks and helps Mick and Gary fix the jump drive. Her severed tentacle attacks Gary and she does the Necrian love pinch on Mick upon learning about the eggs. She did that out of an allegiance to someone who helped her escape the planet.
