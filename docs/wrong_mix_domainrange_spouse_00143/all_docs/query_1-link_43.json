        "text": "The networks continued their big Television Critics Association (TCA) presentations this week, with Showtime making the biggest splash thanks to new details on its Dexter reboot, New Blood, and some frank admissions about how the original series ended. Not to be outdone, ABC made news with an historic first for Dancing with the Stars. Plus there are tons of new trailers – including a look at the second season of Apple TV+’s The Morning Sow – and big casting news, including LaKeith Stanfield’s return to scary stories as the lead of the adaptation of hit thriller novel, The Changeling. Check out all the week’s biggest stories below.\n\nTOP STORY\n\nUpcoming Dexter Limited Series: Showtime President Says ‘I Think This Is Going to Be Brilliant’\n\n(Photo by © Showtime)\n\nOne of the best things about Showtime’s upcoming Dexter: New Blood limited series is that it finally gives all us Dexter devoted a chance to see a proper ending for the serial killer of serial killers.\n\nAnd it turns out viewers weren’t the only ones dissatisfied with the 2013 original series finale, which saw Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) faking his death … and going off to work for a lumber company in the northwest.\n\n“You know what? Dexter is a jewel in the crown of Showtime, and we didn’t do it justice in the end, I think,” Showtime president of entertainment Gary Levin said during the network’s Television Critics Association (TCA) presentation on Tuesday. “And that has always been a burr under my saddle.”\n\nHall also said viewers’ unhappiness with the original series was a big reason why he finally said yes to revisiting the role that earned him five Emmy nominations.\n\n“I think a lot of what was mystifying or dissatisfying to people is a lot of what creates the appetite that we’re hopefully satisfying now,” Hall said during the New Blood TCA session. “The show did not end in a way that was definitive for people or gave anybody a sense of closure. We didn’t hear from Dexter. He didn’t say anything to us when the show ended, and I think it left audiences, if nothing else, (in) a sense of suspended animation. Yeah, I think a big part of our motivation was to definitively answer the question of what happened to this guy.”\n\nLevine said he thinks they nailed it this time. “We always wanted to see if there was a way to do it right,” he said. “I have to say, we finally got to a place that I am just – I can’t wait to show it to you and the world. I think this is going to be (brilliant).”\n\nAnd we can confirm the limited series – or “special event series,” as the network is officially calling it – gets off to a good start. Picking up about a decade after Dexter went off to live his lumberjack life, in New Blood he’s now residing in a small town in upstate New York, going by the name Jim, and ingratiating himself with the townsfolk while he successfully resists the urges of his Dark Passenger.\n\nFor a while, anyway … and that’s all we’ll say about that.\n\nThe 10-episode event series was filmed in Massachusetts during the pandemic, with original series showrunner Clyde Phillips (who left the series before it ended) back on board, and is intended as a one-off. But would a great ratings performance for the show mean Dexter could become a regular visitor to the Showtime lineup?\n\n“You’re way ahead of me,” Levine said. “I’m trying to finish producing the special event series. Expectation is so high for it. And, again, the series is so special to our network and to me, that that’s my focus right now. Let’s make it great. The future will take care of itself.”\n\nDexter: New Blood premieres on Showtime Nov. 7.\n\nMore from Showtime: Your Honor Gets Surprise Second Season as the Ray Donovan Movie Lands a Date(ish)\n\n(Photo by Skip Bolen/Showtime)\n\n— Though the finale of the Bryan Cranston thriller Your Honor was quite definitive, Showtime announced the limited series will return for a second season, after Cranston became intrigued with a storyline idea from writer and showrunner Peter Moffat. Levine said he is still “completely in the dark” about that idea, but Season 2 is a go anyway.\n\n— The Ray Donovan movie that will wrap up that series after its abrupt cancelation with multiple storylines left dangling, is tentatively planned for a 2022 winter premiere. Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight return as Ray and Mickey, with most of the rest of the cast also return, according to Levine.\n\n— The last five episodes of Billions Season 5 premiere Sept. 5, and Levine said despite their pandemic delay, they “come back just shot out of a cannon, and you are immediately thrown back into the story.” Season 6 is scheduled to premiere in January.\n\n— Desus & Mero was renewed for a fourth season.\n\n— Levine said Showtime swapped a long-in-development Halo series for The Man Who Fell to Earth with Paramount+ because Halo was always “an odd fit” with Showtime’s drama-heavy lineup.\n\n— The Wood writer and director Rick Famuyiwa is teaming up with The Chi and Snowfall writer Justin Hillian to adapt the 1999 comedy movie as a potential Showtime series.\n\nAt ABC, The Connors Are Set to Go Live, Kevin Hart Swims with Sharks, and A First for Dancing with the Stars\n\n(Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)\n\n— During its TCA panel, ABC revealed the first two contestants for Season 30 of Dancing with the Stars: Olympic gold medalist gymnast Suni Lee, and, in what will be the competition’s first-ever same-sex pairing, pop star JoJo Siwa, who will compete with one of the female pro dancers. The rest of the cast will be revealed on Sept. 8, and the season premieres live on Sept. 20.\n\n— The Connors’ cast is doing live Season 4 premieres for the East Coast and West Coast on Sept. 22.\n\n— Kevin Hart will be a new guest shark on Season 13 of Shark Tank, which premieres Oct. 8.\n\n— John Carroll Lynch’s character didn’t make it out of Big Sky’s first season alive, but Lynch has been confirmed as a returning presence for Season 2. His character, it’s important to note, did have a twin …\n\n— The Goldbergs Season 9 premiere will give George Segal a proper send-off, with a storyline that includes the death of his character.\n\n— Steve Harvey will star in a primetime court show called Judge Steve Harvey.\n\nNEW TRAILERS: The Morning Show Season 2 Trailer Reveals a Surprise New Cast Member\n\nThe Morning Show, Season 2, finds even more drama surrounding the UBA network’s morning show, as Jennifer Aniston’s Alex and Reese Witherspoon’s Bradley appear to no longer be co-hosts!
