But because of vague memories of other Russian ice dancers who were, at the time, higher ranked complaining about being passed over for assignments for D/S (and maybe one other team as well?).

Like others.\n\nBut my comment was in response to using FB/S as an example of the power of IAM not being able to take a top five team and give them a world medal before they retired. It was clear last year that possibility existed in the minds of the judges.

I know people like to pretend this reality didn't exist once the news broke this season but it did. Hence me saying they are not a good example of IAM failing to take a top five team to the podium before they retire.\n\nNow let's wait and see if that holds for Fear/Gibson, then we can talk\n\nSure.

The obvious reasons why they didn't capitalize on last season's momentum this season are 1) poor RD (you'll never not convince me that Val/Kazimov had the better \"Top Gun\" RD this season), 2) even worse FD, 3) critical errors in major competitions (Finlandia, GPF, Worlds). None of those reasons have anything to do with why IAM failed to get them on the podium this year except maybe the critical errors but, as others have noted, that is hardly something new with them so the argument that last season was actually the aberration has some validity to it.\n\nI do agree, though, coming off last season, that they certainly seemed to be on a trajectory that would have gotten them a 'thank you very much for competing, here's your retirement gift' bronze at their home Worlds but just their RD and FD material alone was going to set them back if all three of the top teams came out with better programs (and it seems clear to me that Chock/Bates had a much better RD while both Gilles/Poirier and Guignard/Fabbri had much better FDs than FBSoer).\n\nI don't feel like the reasons were \"obvious\" if by obvious you're referring to the allegations about Soerensen.

I suppose they could have robbed G/F blind but I doubt it.\n\nI will say one of the reasons I never got behind this team (her styling and skating aside, just an assault on the eyes) is that I saw them as a team that got advantages and opportunities because of who the mother was and not their own merit.

I will admit I am curious to see how they present with the change but theirs is a story I am not invested in or endeared by in any way.\n\nThis is what makes me mad about the whole situation. I totally agree that the kids should not be responsible for their parents actions and should not be blamed for it. However, Davis/Smolkin have been using Tutberidze's influence & money for several seasons and for various reasons. They wanted to go to the Olympics - they went there over way better and more deserving teams. They wanted to escape Russia - here you are, please, take your release. A release after just a year, when someone like partner-less Dario Chirizano was denied of such thing (and he didn't even go to the Olympics or wasn't on the main National team). Literally no one except Davis/Smolkin has been released. Yes, they posted their anti-war statements on social media - but who pays for their coaching? Their mother, who now stars in Russian trashy reality shows and just got a new big ice rink from Moscow's mayor. Again, I am not judging her for doing that as I understand the situation in Russia all too well, but they are literally trying to sit on both chairs.\n\nOverall, it's not too surprising, as figure skating and ice dance in particular has always been about politicking and block judging, no matter the country and coaching group (just some are admitting it more openly). I am intrigued to see where they will end up and how it will go. Yet, no way I will ever even slightly be rooting for them.\n\nGiven the recent news of splits, I did a stock take on the likely status of junior teams heading into the new season - assuming no change to the age rules for now, since we haven't yet seen the proposals or know how much support they're likely to get. Not too many teams ageing up this season (outside of Italy) - PinPog are the only one from the JGPF or the top group at Junior Worlds - but there will be a fairly wholesale clearout after junior worlds next year. And several teams have choices to make about whether to move up early or do a split season (Neset/Markelov, Tkachenko/Kiliakov, Grimm/Savitskiy, Zehnder/Sieber, Kudryavtseva/Karankevich). Plus the Canadian field is looking very thin on the ground after another round of splits, though I'm sure there will be some new teams by the summer competitions.\n\nArmenia\n\nKristina Dobroserdova / Alessandro Pellegrini – ageing up\n\nAustralia\n\nRegina Ng / Dominik Mautner – 1 more season (junior eligible through JWC 2025)\n\nRenee Yuen / Oliver Ma – 5 more seasons (junior eligible through JWC 2029)\n\nAustria\n\nElisabeth Havers / Leo Havers – 3 more seasons (junior eligible through JWC 2027)\n\nAnita Straub / Andreas Straub – 2 more seasons (junior eligible through JWC 2026)\n\nBelgium\n\nSofia Beznosikova / Max Leleu – 4 more seasons (junior eligible through JWC 2028)\n\nBrazil\n\nCatharina Guedes Tibau / Cayden Dawson – split (she’s looking for a new partner and has moved to IAM Ontario)\n\nCanada\n\nVictoria Carandiuc / Andrei Carandiuc – 3 more seasons\n\nCharlotte Chung / Axel Mackenzie – ageing up\n\nAurea Cincon-Debout / Earl Jesse Celestino – 2 more seasons\n\nJamie Fournier / Everest Zhu – ageing up\n\nAudra Gans / Michael Boutsan – split (both looking for new partners)\n\nEmma Goodstadt / Christian Bennett – split (she’s retired, he’s ageing up and looking for a new partner)\n\nSophia Gover / Billy Wilson French – 1 more season\n\nAlisa Korneva / Kieran MacDonald – ageing up\n\nCaroline Kravets / Jacob Stark – split (she’s looking for a new partner)\n\nJordyn Lewis / Noah McMillan – split\n\nSavanna Martel / William Oddson – split (he’s looking for a new partner)\n\nChloe Nguyen / Brendan Giang – ageing up\n\nDana Sabatini-Speciale / Nicholas Buelow – split (she’s looking for a new partner)\n\nLayla Veillon / Alexander Brandys – 1 more season\n\nChina\n\nXuantong Li / Xinkang Wang – 1 more season – but may move up since they’ve already done a couple of split seasons\n\nYufei Lin / Zijian Gao – ageing up\n\nTong Liu / Quanshuo Ge – 3 more seasons\n\nXinyi Yu / Tianyi Liu – 2 more seasons\n\nCyprus\n\nAngelina Kudryavtseva / Ilia Karankevich – 1 more season – but have suggested they may move up\n\nCzechia\n\nLauren Batkova / Jacob Yang – 1 more season\n\nNatalie Blaasova / Filip Blaas – 2 more seasons\n\nAndrea Psurna / Jachym Novak – split (both looking for new partners)\n\nKristyna Stanclova / Karel Kostron – 3 more seasons\n\nKlara Vlckova / Tomas Vlcek – 3 more seasons\n\nEliska Zakova / Filip Mencl – 1 more season\n\nSpain\n\nSarah Marcilly Vazquez / Jolan Engel – 4 more seasons\n\nMaite Ojeda Lindholst / Hector Gonzalez Elvira – 3 more seasons\n\nElena Pena / Antonio Pena – split (he’s looking for a new partner)\n\nAthena Roberts / Eric Alis – ageing up\n\nEstonia\n\nKsenia Sipunova / Miron Korjagin – 3 more seasons\n\nFinland\n\nEnna Kesti / Oskari Liedenpohja – 3 more seasons\n\nCilla Laine / Urho Reina – 1 more season\n\nHilda Taylor / Nolen Hickey – ageing up\n\nFrance\n\nEva Bernard / Amedeo Bonetto – ageing up\n\nEstelle Bouillet / Martin Chardain – split (she’s looking for a new partner)\n\nMaissane Chine / Lucas Chataignoux – split (he’s now skating with Lou Koch)\n\nLouise Duprat / Tahory Taddei-Dugue – 4 more seasons\n\nCelina Fradji / Jean-Hans Fourneaux – 1 more season\n\nDiane Gallix / Elod Egyed-Zsigmond – 3 more seasons\n\nLea Hienne / Baptiste Ferrand – 1 more season\n\nLena Maliqueo-Repoux / Illia Synelnikov – 3 more seasons\n\nDania Mouaden / Theo Bigot – 5 more seasons\n\nAmbre Perrier Gianesini / Samuel Blanc Klaperman – 2 more seasons\n\nDiane Sznajder / Joseph Booth – split (she’s looking for a new partner)\n\nAgathe Tournadre / Thomas Gipoulou – 1 more season\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nMolly Hairsine / Alessio Surenkov-Gultchev – 1 more season\n\nAshlie Slatter / Atl Ongay-Perez – 4 more seasons\n\nGeorgia\n\nMariia Alieva / Yehor Barshak – ageing up\n\nGermany\n\nDarya Grimm / Michail Savitskiy – 1 more season – have suggested they may do a split season\n\nAlexia Kruk / Jan Eisenhaber – 2 more seasons\n\nMia Lee Mayer / Davide Calderari – 3 more seasons\n\nSavenna Pache / Korbinian Steinsailer – 1 more season\n\nLilia Schubert / Nikita Remeshevskiy – ageing up\n\nIreland\n\nLaura Hegarty / Kevin Hegarty – ageing up\n\nIsrael\n\nElizabeth Tkachenko / Alexei Kiliakov – 1 more season – may do a split season\n\nItaly\n\nZoe Bianchi / Pietro Rota – 4 more seasons\n\nGiulia Paolino / Andrea Tuba – ageing up\n\nVittoria Petracchi / Daniel Basile – 3 more seasons\n\nAlice Pizzorni / Massimiliano Bucciarelli – 1 more season\n\nNoemi Tali / Noah Lafornara – ageing up\n\nBeatrice Ventura / Stefano Frasca – ageing up\n\nJapan\n\nSara Kishimoto / Atsuhiko Tamura – 1 more season\n\nKaho Yamashita / Yuto Nagata – ageing up\n\nKazakhstan\n\nEva Shelaeva / Ivan Solovyev – 4 more seasons\n\nSouth Korea\n\nJinny Kim / Namu Lee – split (she’s retired, he’s looking for a new partner)\n\nMexico\n\nHarlow Stanley / Nikita Sosnenko – split (she’s now skating senior with Seiji Urano, he’s looking for a new partner)\n\nPoland\n\nSofiia Dovhal / Wiktor Kulesza – 1 more season -
