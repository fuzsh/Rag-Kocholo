        "text": "I’ll continue to update this page throughout the month of February.\n\nAs always, readers can stay informed of all blog updates/additions via Twitter (@voiceroy) and Facebook. I also regularly post celebrity voice news items through Facebook and Twitter which I don’t publish on the blog.\n\nUpdate: 2.19.2010\n\n– Via Animated Views by Ben Price: Premiering on HBO Friday, Feb. 19th at 9PM is The Ricky Gervais Show, an animated version of the Guinness World Record-holder for “most downloaded podcast.” It features the voices of comedian/actor Ricky Gervais (popular BBC sitcom The Office), Stephen Merchant and Karl Pilkington. You can watch the first full episode online at HBO.com.\n\n– Via TVSquad.com: Gilbert Gottfried now has a new title to add to his credit: “TV pitchman,” as the spokesperson for “ShoeDini”:\n\n– Via LA Times’ Hero Complex: Rockers Gene Simmons and David Lee Roth howled for “Wolfman” film vocal effects.\n\n– Added two photos to the press release for Goodspeed Musicals gala event honoring Paul Williams.\n\n– Via Zachary-Levi.com: Disney’s Rapunzel changes title (again) to “Tangled.” (Currently confirmed voice cast previously reported here.)\n\n– Via DivineCaroline: “Name That Voice: 10 Celebrity Commercial Voice-Overs.”\n\n– Via WalletPop: “The Celebrity Voices Behind the Commercials.”\n\n– Via DailyFill.com: “15 Secret Celebrity Voice Overs.”\n\n– Via toonzone.net: Archer‘s Aisha Tyler (The Boondocks, The Wild) and series creator Adam Reed (Frisky Dingo, Sealab 2021) discuss the show and the voice cast.\n\nUpdate: 2.15.2010\n\nThe LA Times Hero Complex blog has an interview with Tim Burton discussing Barbara Windsor, who voices the Dormouse in Burton’s Alice in Wonderland.\n\nIn related news, there will be an Alice in Wonderland “fan event” in Hollywood on Feb. 19th with in-person appearances by Tim Burton and “some cast members” whose names have yet to be announced. Hero Complex has more details on the event.\n\nThe world premiere of Alice in Wonderland will take place in London on Feb. 25th. Expected to attend the red carpet event: Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Avril Lavigne, Alan Rickman, Anne Hathaway, Christopher Lee, Mia Wasikowska, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas, Timothy Spall, Paul Whitehouse, Barbara Windsor and Michael Sheen.\n\nOther details on the film were previously reported below.\n\nUpdate: 2.14.2010\n\n– Via toonzone.net: Saturday Night Live’s Chris Parnell will guest star on Nick at Nite’s Feb. 15th episode of Glen Martin D.D.S. as the voice of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n– Comics/TV/film writer/producer Neil Gaiman says via his blog that he will be providing a voice for an upcoming episode of the PBS’ kids show Arthur. As of his Jan. 21st post, he had only received the script and does not mention when he would be recording. [Source: toonzone.net]\n\n– PBS kids show WordGirl has an impressive voice cast which includes many celebrity guest voices such as Ed Asner, Elliot Gould, Peter Graves, John C. McGinley and Jeffrey Tambor. Read my review of the show here.\n\nUpdate: 2.13.2010:\n\n– Reuters reports:\n\nJames Marsden has signed on to star opposite Russell Brand in “I Hop,” a live-action/computer-animated hybrid comedy.\n\nTim Hill, who directed the hybrid “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” is pushing his resume into hipper territory with this tale of an out-of-work slacker (Marsden) who accidentally injures the Easter Bunny (voiced by Brand) and must take him in as he recovers. As Fred struggles with the world’s worst houseguest, both will learn what it takes to finally grow up.\n\nI’ve never heard of a movie being named after an actual restaurant chain, but I guess there’s a first time for everything? I predict this “working title” doesn’t last three months.\n\n– TV.com has an interview with Tim Daly, voice of Superman in Superman: The Animated Series and Batman/Superman: Public Enemies. He indirectly discusses his voiceover work and briefly mentions his role as Superman:\n\nQ: You’ve done a little bit of everything in television—hour-long network drama, sitcoms, voiceovers for animation, TV movies, prestige cable shows. Is there any format you like working in more than others?\n\nQ: No. Every step, every character, every medium has its own particular challenges, but essentially, I consider my job finding a way to tell the truth, to deliver the truth to people in a way that effects them, that makes them say, “Wow, that moved me or enlightened me or made me laugh.” I think that’s the job of pretty much any artist. We listen to music and it makes us weep—why? Because it speaks truth to us. I think TV should be the same way. It should strike a chord in us where we say, “That struck a human chord in me and it moved me.”\n\nQ: So it’s not all just a let-down after playing Superman?\n\nA: [laughs] Well, a little bit. I mean, come on, it’s Superman, after all. Superman was a great role, and I loved doing it, and I would welcome doing it more, especially with Andrea Romano, who’s such a great director. I hope that opportunity presents itself again.\n\n– Via SeattleWeekly.com: Simpsons‘ creator Matt Groening and cast member Hank Azaria will appear as guest judges on the upcoming seventh season of Top Chef. It is not known when the show will air; production is scheduled to begin in April 2010.\n\n– On December 22, 2009, Atari/Cryptic Studios issued a press release announcing that Leonard Nimoy would be narrating the intro as well as key scenes and events throughout the game for Star Trek Online (which released Feb. 2nd):\n\n“I am happy to be involved with Star Trek Online. In this game, the essence of Star Trek – exploration and adventure – lives long and prospers,” said Nimoy. “I’m pleased that a whole new generation of fans will be able to discover new frontiers in the Star Trek universe.”\n\nIGN.com has footage of Nimoy’s voiceover session for the game.\n\nElsewhere, Nimoy is interviewed in the Winter 2010 print issue of NVISION Magazine which includes an 8-page feature on the game. The magazine is available on newsstands through March 2nd, 2010 and can also be ordered online.\n\nOn Dec. 12, 2009, Zachary Quinto, who played Spock in the J.J. Abrams Star Trek movie, announced at the Spike Video Game Awards that he would be the “the voice of” Star Trek Online. He does not, however, reprise his role as Spock. According to a Jan. 27th interview on Wired.com, Quinto “provides the voice for a holographic doctor — the Emergency Medical Hologram Mark VI…[new] players of the MMO will hear Quinto’s voice as they make their way through the game’s opening tutorial.”\n\nQuinto also discussed the game in a Feb. 2nd interview with the New York Daily News, and IGN.com has footage of Quinto’s voiceover session. SciFiWire.com has a video interview with Quinto detailing his voice work on the game.\n\n– Voice cast info on some upcoming animated films and live-action/CGI features:\n\n> Alice in Wonderland (March 5th, 2010): I’ll bypass mentioning the main stars in the Tim Burton-directed *sequel* to the Lewis Carroll classic children’s novel since you’ve likely seen your fill of them in recent TV ads. What I’m personally looking forward to hearing/seeing are the performances by Crispin Glover as The Knave of Hearts, Stephen Fry as The Cheshire Cat, Christopher Lee as The Jabberwock, Alan Rickman as The Caterpillar and Matt Lucas as both Tweedledum and Tweedledee.\n\n> The Hero of Color City: No specific release date has been announced yet, but this computer-animated film from Magnolia Pictures is supposed to be released sometime in 2010. According to IMDb.com, it will feature the voices of Christina Ricci as “Yellow,” David Kaye (Transformers Beast Wars, Beast Machines) as “Black,” and Craig Ferguson and Rosie Perez in yet-unannounced voice roles.\n\n> Guardians of Ga’Hoole (September 24, 2010): Based on the popular children’s book series, this film has been generating some advance buzz based on the voice cast which includes Emilie de Ravin, Hugo Weaving, Helen Mirren, Abbie Cornish, Geoffrey Rush, Sam Neill, Jim Sturgess and Miriam Margolyes. (Complete voice cast linked via IMDb on the movie title above.)\n\n> Holy Cow! (release date unknown): Variety first reported March 5th, 2009 that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson would voice a Texas steer in this computer-animated feature and I have yet to see any announcements since. The film doesn’t even have an IMDb page. I guess maybe this one has fizzled like the Johnny Bravo live-action movie starring Johnson that was announced back in 2004.\n\n> Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (July 30, 2010): This is a sequel to the 2001 live-action/CGI talking-animal film, but only a handful of the original cast reprise their roles. According to IMDb.com, returning to voice their canine characters are Alec Baldwin (Butch), Michael Clarke Duncan (Sam) and Joe Pantoliano (Peek), while Bette Midler voices the villain Kitty Galore with Carlos Alazraqui (Reno 911, Camp Lazlo, The Fairly Odd Parents) in a supporting role as the voice of “Cool Cat.” IMDb lists comedian/actor Paul Rodriguez as “Crazy Carlito,” but does not specify whether the role is voice-only.\n\nI know the original was your average kids/family film, but I admit I enjoyed it..mainly for nostalgic reasons: the first dog I ever owned in grade school was a beagle, so I must admit I’m disappointed that Lou (as voiced by Tobey McGuire) does not appear to be returning for the sequel. And other favorite noteworthy performances from the original don’t seem to be returning either: Sean Hayes (Mr. Tinkles), Jon Lovitz (Calico) and voice actors Danny Mann and Billy West as the Ninja cats.\n\n> Yogi Bear (December 15, 2010): *Sigh* Why, Warner Bros…why would you do this? Oh yeah, money…that’s why. At any rate, it features the motion capture performances and voices of Dan Aykroyd (Yogi), Justin Timberlake (Boo-Boo) [yikes!], and Christine Taylor (Cindy). I’m not looking forward to this movie. I will wait to see the reviews, but even then chances are slim that I will ever watch it.\n\nIn unfortunately related news, LA Times‘ Hero Complex blog reports that Warner Bros has named Alex Zamm to direct its planned live-action/CGI Marvin the Martian feature film. (Zamm is also contracted to helm yet another similar feature for Hong Kong Phooey.) Two TV writers — Paul Kaplan and Mark Torgove — have also signed on for the Marvin screenplay (who in turn are writing the CHiPS remake).\n\nThe LA Times says that the producers are “talking to a number of stars” and mentions Mike Myers as “one name that’s come up.”\n\nI guess there really is no animated property that’s safe from this sort of treatment.\n\n– toonzone.net reports that David Spade is in talks with cable channel TBS to develop an animated series based on the Joe Dirt feature film.\n\nHey, TBS! If you’re going to produce an animated series based on a feature film and expect it to be successful, you might want to pick a film that was actually good.\n\n– Via toonzone.net: Olympic figure skating champion Michelle Kwan will guest star on Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! Sunday, February 21, 2010, at 7:00 PM (Eastern).\n\n– toonzone.net reports (via Adult Swim press release) that Robot Chicken has been renewed for two more seasons, with an “unprecedented” order for 40 new episodes. toonzone adds, “No information was provided on when the new seasons will begin production or when they will air.”\n\nSays co-creator Seth Green in the press release: “We’re very excited,” says Green, “we never expected to do a second season, let alone a fifth and sixth, so we are thrilled by the audience response and how the show continues to grow internationally.” Matt Senreich says, “We love Adult Swim. It’s really that simple. From the get-go, we’ve always said that Robot Chicken was a show where we play with friends and we look forward to doing that for years to come!”\n\nAnd I’ll add that it could be a really long before we see new episodes since Green and Senreich along with Tom Root are developing an untitled pilot for FOX (previously reported here).\n\n– Leonardo DiCaprio will narrate the NASA space documentary Hubble 3D. The film arrives in theaters March 19th, 2010.\n\nAnd some of my own celebrity-related reports outside of this article:\n\n– 2.13.2010 — Toy Story 3 Cast News (Woody’s) Round-Up\n\n– 2.13.2010 — Paul Williams Honored\n\n– 2.11.2010 — Jonathan Winters Rumored to voice Papa Smurf\n\n– 2.11.2010 — Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s Cheryl Hines and Star Trek‘s George Takei guest star on the 2-part season finale of The Superhero Squad Show. (Link includes interviews with Hines and Tom Kenny.) Mark Hamill also guest-starred in January as the voice of the Red Skull.\n\n– 2.11.2010 — Next Animated DC DVD: Batman: Under the Red Hood (which includes cast info).\n\n– 2.11.2010 — Neil Patrick Harris Guests on Nick’s ‘Penguins’\n\n– 2.11..2010 — In a Futurama Cast Round-Up of news on the upcoming sixth season of the show, I reported that late-night talk show host Craig Ferguson will guest on the second episode of the new season.\n\nUpdate: 2.11.2010:\n\n– Robin Williams, Hank Azaria and Elijah Wood have recently been in Sydney, Australia recording dialog and filming motion capture for the computer-animated Happy Feet II. On Feb. 9th, Williams gave an impromptu stand-up performance in a Sydney bar and received a standing ovation.\n\nOn a related note, Movieline.com reported Jan. 15th that Matt Damon and Brad Pitt had also been cast in the film, although Warner Bros has declined to confirm this. Movieline says their sources state that both Damon and Pitt were in the studio recording dialog for the film that week.\n\nIt is assumed that “Gloria,” the character voiced by the late Brittany Murphy, will return for the sequel because Murphy had plans in early December 2009 to fly to Sydney with Elijah Wood to record the dialog, and then afterwards was allegedly fired by Warner Bros. There has been no announcement since whether Gloria’s role in the sequel will be cut or if Warner Bros will cast a replacement.\n\n– Added another update to my August 2009 news on DreamWorks’ computer-animated superhero adventure, MegaMind (formerly “Oobermind,” which was originally “Master Mind”).\n\n– The live-action/CGI hybrid Marmaduke, voiced by Owen Wilson, arrives in theaters June 10, 2010 and features the voices of Steve Coogan, Ron Perlman, Jeremy Piven, Fergie, George Lopez, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Thomas F. Wilson, Emma Stone, Damon Wayans and Marlon Wayans.\n\n– Movieweb.com attended DreamWorks’ 2010 film presentation on Jan. 15th, and for those who enjoy spoilers Movieweb describes the action from previews of the upcoming computer-animated films MegaMind, Shrek Forever After and How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nShrek Forever After features returning cast members Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas. Other confirmed cast members: Kathy Griffin and Kristin Schaal (Flight of the Conchords) as ogre-hunting witches, Jane Lynch (Glee), Jon Hamm (Mad Men) as the ogre leader of an underground resistance group, Megan Fox (Transformers film series) as a princess, and Walt Dohrn as Rumpelstiltskin [Dorhn voiced several incidental characters in Shrek the Third].\n\nWikipedia has an alleged “confirmed cast” list, but its validity is already challenged by listing Beatles’ frontman Paul McCartney as the voice of Rumpelstiltskin which the USA Today refuted in a Nov. 2009 article.\n\nAnd here’s the most recent trailer (as of this writing):\n\nAnd DreamWorks’ How to Train Your Dragon arrives in theaters March 25th, featuring the Movieweb-confirmed voices of Jay Baruchel, Gerard Butler, America Ferrera, Craig Ferguson, Jonah Hill, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Kristen Wigg. Chris Sanders, who wrote and directed (and voiced) Disney’s Lilo & Stitch, is the film’s co-writer and co-director.\n\nOriginally posted 2.10.2010:\n\n– Kevin McKidd, who plays Poseidon in the feature film Percy Jackson and the Olympians, revealed in an interview on DailyRecord.co.uk that he was “asked to provide a voice in Pixar’s Scottish animated movie, The Bear And The Bow,” which will feature the voices of Reese Witherspoon, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson.\n\nMcKidd adds, “[My son was delighted that I’m] doing a voice in a Pixar film. I haven’t done the recordings yet so I’ll know more in March when I start. I’m dead excited about it – and that I’m working with Billy Connolly.”\n\n– Via Adweek: Dexter‘s Michael C. Hall is the image voice for the Dodge Charger.\n\n– Via TheFlickCast.com: Ron Perlman narrates the trailer for Fallout: New Vegas video game.\n\n– Via toonzone.net: T.C. Carson, voice of Kratos in the God of War video game series, will be doing a signing Feb. 14th at Rose Bowl Comics in Pasedena, CA.\n\n– Via ComicBookResources.com: Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s Cheryl Hines voices Stardust, herald of Galactus, on the 2-part season finale of The Superhero Squad Show airing Feb. 13th and 20th at 7:30 PM on Cartoon Network.\n\nSays Hines of her voice acting experience:\n\nThe first time you do this, it’s such a strange feeling, because you’re in this booth that has this big glass window and there are usually, I don’t know, five to eight people on the other side staring at you with their headphones on. You can’t really hear what they’re saying, unless they want you to hear what they’re saying, and then they push a little button and say something to you. Otherwise, you’ll do a take and see them all talking. “Oh no, what’s going on in there?” Then they’ll push the button and go, “That was good, but let’s just try it one more time.” [Laughs] They’re always super calm when they talk to you, because they don’t want you getting rattled.\n\nI remember the first time I did it, I was sweating. You’re not sure if you’re doing it right. You don’t really know what you’re doing. After you do a few [takes], you realize that there’s actually no right or wrong. The people on the other side of the glass, they’re listening and they’re really good at imagining the world that you’re creating.\n\nYou are so exhausted at the end of recording something like this. It’s very draining. I mean, let’s be honest, I’m not digging ditches, but your whole body is all tense and you’re trying to get it right and you’re so in it and concentrating so hard for three or four hours at a time. When it’s over, it feels like you just ran a marathon. Plus, with everybody’s eyes all on you, everyone’s listening to every little swallow, and God help you if you have any other body noises. [Laughs] It can be very stressful! But it’s weird. It’s a different way of working.\n\n– Via CreativeLoafing.com: Aisha Tyler (Archer, Boondocks, The Wild) discusses voice acting:\n\nCreative Loafing: You’re currently doing the voice for the character Lana Kane on the animated TV show Archer. What’s that like?\n\nAisha Tyler: Well, I have done a good number of animated parts already; a show called the The Boondocks that Aaron McGruder created for Adult Swim, shows for the Disney channel, and also a big Disney movie, The Wild. So, I’ve done a good amount, but this is the first time I have done a series. It’s great. It’s much easier than regular TV. You don’t have to do hair and make-up and you just get to go into a booth. The workload is cake, and it’s really fun actually.\n\nCL: How is that working right now with your comedy tour kicking off?\n\nAT: We finished all the episodes for this season. But, what’s great about voice-overs is that as long as you have access to a high quality sound booth in any city, we’re able to do it from any part of the country. So, it’s not too difficult.\n\n– toonzone.net reports that Classic Media and Vivendi Entertainment will release a brand new animated direct-to-DVD title, Kung Fu Magoo, on May 11th. It features the voices of:\n\nJim Conroy (Celebrity Death Match, Grand Theft Auto IV) as Mr. Magoo\n\nDylan & Cole Sprouse (The Suite Life of Zack & Cody)\n\nAlyson Stoner (Camp Rock)\n\nChris Parnell (Saturday Night Live)\n\nKenny Mayne (Dancing With The Stars)\n\nFred Travalena (Bogey from Shirt Tales)\n\nAlso on May 11th, Classic/Vivendi will release the 1964 Magoo classic, Mr. Magoo in Sherwood Forest, starring the original voice of Mr. Magoo, Jim Backus (Gilligan’s Island).\n\nTVShowsonDVD.com has a look at the cover art for both titles.\n\n– BBC.co.uk has an interview with Family Guy’s Mike Henry discussing the celebrity guest voices featured on the Family Guy spin-off The Cleveland Show, which include Kanye West, T-Pain, will.i.am (Black Eyed Peas), U2 drummer Larry Mullen Jr and film director David Lynch.\n\nHenry says of Kanye:\n\nKanye could not be a cooler guy at our show – we do definitely have some jokes where he makes light of himself.\n\nHe does some things out in public that stir up controversy and opinions. He knew that and we contacted him and he was totally up for doing the part. He’s a recurring character [as Kenny West]. He does an extended rap-off with Cleveland Jnr in an episode first season and he and Cleveland hook up and do another rap in season two.\n\nThe first time we had actually written a rap for him. Five of our writers sat down to write this rap and they were like, ‘I wonder how he’s going to like it?’.\n\nBut he was genuinely laughing. He very humbly asked if we could change one line which didn’t feel right. He was even joking that we should write a song for his next album.\n\nT-Pain and will.i.am will play Cleveland Jr.’s sidekicks in season 2. “We just recorded [will.i.am] last week and he was absolutely hilarious,” Henry says. “He could do his own animated show he’s got so many voices.”\n\nOf Larry Mullen Jr. Henry says, “We just recorded him doing a couple of different parts and he was very funny. He plays a mobster in one episode; he plays a bad Elvis impersonator by design in another episode. He’s got his own studio so we just record it from Dublin. You don’t have to record at a certain time. It’s an easy gig and one that people like to do.”\n\nHenry adds, “It’s very cool to have all these people from different walks of entertainment participating in what we’re doing.”\n\nA related interview with Cleveland Show executive producer Rich Appel on HollywoodReporter.com mentions that this Sunday’s episode (2.14) guest stars the Black Eyed Peas’ Fergie, and adds that episode 16 in season 2 will feature guest stars Carl Reiner, will.i.am and T-Pain.\n\n– Via toonzone.net: …and speaking of T-Pain, he spoke with ABCNews.com about his role in Freaknik: The Musical, a hip-hop animated musical scheduled to air on Adult Swim March 7, 2010 (previously reported here) The much-hyped special also features the voices of Rick Ro$$, Andy Samberg, Lil’ Wayne, Bill Hader, Kelis, Snoop Dogg, George Clinton, Young Cash, Sophia Fresh and Charlie Murphy.\n\nAdditional sources: IMDb.com, Wikipedia.org, Screenhead.com, Wikipedia’s 2010 in film"
