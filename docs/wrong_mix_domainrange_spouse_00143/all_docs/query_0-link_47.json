        "text": "My father Philip Richebourg conducted his own orchestra every day of his life. Dedicated to each task at hand whether in business or in service to his community, in his life-passions as pilot, musician, archivist, my father approached all things in life as if resolute in achieving one goal, that of consistency, precision and perfect harmony. As ASO’s First Board President and for seven consecutive years, my father’s mission in the formative years was to solidify the orchestra financially and administratively with bold and creative ideas, ensuring its longevity. Today the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra has soared to the heights that my father dreamed would one day come true. I can think of no greater legacy than naming the ASO Music Director’s Chair after my father Philip Richebourg.\n\nElizabeth Richebourg Rea is a fine art photographer and curator. Rea’s art career began in the 1970s working for The Museum of Modern Art and Leo Castelli. Curator of numerous exhibitions of Joseph Cornell, she was also catalogue editor and research consultant for two Roy Lichtenstein Museum Retrospectives. Elizabeth is President of the Dungannon Foundation, sponsor of The Rea Award for the Short Story and Rea Visiting Writers/Lecturers series at the University of Virginia. She is active on the Peggy Guggenheim Advisory Board in Venice and is Honorary Trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Elizabeth lives in Connecticut.\n\nThe mission of the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra is to inspire, educate and enrich lives near and far by creating extraordinary musical experiences with uncompromising artistic excellence.\n\nWith a 61-year history of artistic excellence, the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra is recognized as the largest and most distinguished performing arts organization in Maryland’s capital city.

Funding for the Maryland State Arts Council is also provided by the National Endowment for the Arts, a federal agency which believes that a great nation deserves great art.\n\nThe Annapolis Symphony Academy is changing lives by providing a high-level musical education to students of all cultural and economic backgrounds. Music has the power to change lives. It is soulful, invigorating, challenging, emotionally charged, and immensely rewarding. It affects us all every day in virtually any situation we find ourselves in.\n\nAllow us to introduce you to the wonders of music and in return, introduce us to something unique about yourself. We can create a family together, a musical roof over a shared vision that our lives can be changed for the better with the power of music.\n\nWhile classical music embraces all, it is not always accessible to everyone. Studies show that only a staggering 4% of orchestral players come from a minority background in the United States*. The Academy is structured in a unique way that promotes accessibility to classical music.\n\nThrough the incredible generosity of our donors, the Academy awards up to fifty percent of its annual tuition revenue in need-based scholarships. We believe this model provides a truly diverse student body, as it merges two overlapping, yet nonidentical, concepts of equality onto one program: our students are selected for the program strictly based on merit as well as their drive to learn and become better musicians.\n\nHalf of the Annapolis Symphony Academy student body is composed of under-represented minorities in a model that emphasizes interaction and mutual respect.\n\nEdward Ross Goldstein\n\nJuly 29, 1954 - January 6, 2023\n\nEdward Goldstein was the principal tubist with the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra from 1974 to 2018 and performed with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. He received his Bachelor of Music Education and Master of Music degrees from the Peabody Conservatory of Music of the Johns Hopkins University. In addition to being a founding member of the Peabody Ragtime Ensemble in 1974, he was also the founder and director of the Baltimore Jazz Orchestra, the Swanee River Ragtime Band, the Brass Menagerie Brass Quintet and the Bourbon Street Ramblers. Ed was co-author of the definitive, 656-page, scholarly work on his instrument, The Tuba Source Book, published by Indiana University Press. Ed was the Music Contractor for Center Stage and Everyman Theater in Baltimore, MD. In addition to private teaching, Ed was on the music faculties of Loch Raven High School in Baltimore County and the Peabody Institute Preparatory Department. On April 3, 2022, Ed received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Baltimore Musicians Union. Contributions in his memory may be made to Shaarei Tfiloh Synagogue, 2001 Liberty Heights Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21217 or the Peabody Preporatory General Scholarship Fund, www.peabody.jhu.edu/preparatory/.\n\nDr. Michael J. Kurtz\n\nMay 8, 1949 - December 17, 2022\n\nDr. Kurtz served at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) for 37 years, during which time he held significant leadership positions, supervised hundreds of staff in multiple locations, and led national efforts in electronic records preservation and management, declassification, and transparency of government records. Dr. Kurtz was the author of several highly cited publications in the areas of archives management and administration. His 2006 book, \"America and the Return of Nazi Contraband: The Recovery of Europe’s Cultural Treasures\" (Cambridge University Press, 2006) was the key inspiration for the 2014 film \"The Monuments Men” (directed by George Clooney).\n\nA longtime supporter of the ASO, Michael Kurtz served as Trustee and Vice Chair of the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra (ASO) Board of Trustees and President of the Friends of the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra (FASO). Michael's passion for music was evident in his financial leadership and organizational drive behind the ASO's international tour to Spain (2021) and his ongoing support for the Annapolis Symphony Academy. Michael was preceded in death by his wife Cherie, who passed away in November 2019. Both Michael and Cherie were very fond of the piano. Michael's friends and colleagues from FASO believe it is fitting to honor his memory at this Masterworks concert, which features guest artist Jon Nakamatsu playing the piano in Beethoven's \"Emperor\" Concerto. FASO will underwrite a portion of Mr. Nakamatsu's fee in Michael's memory. FASO requests that memorial contributions to this purpose can be made by sending a tax-deductible check payable to Friends of the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra, PO Box 1974, Annapolis, MD 21404 by the end of February."
