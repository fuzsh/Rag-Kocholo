        "text": "Governing Body members host this reception for attendees to open the event with an evening of peer networking and an opportunity to participate in a team building challenge.\n\nTeam work, creativity, and perseverance, are just a few of the skills your team will need to win this unique Minute to Win it style game show! A combination of skill testing challenges and brain teasers will have your team firing on all cylinders.\n\nAs the attack surface continues to grow and the number of attacks increases, there still remains a gap when it comes to validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the enterpriseâ€™s cyber posture. Hackers are on 24/7, so how can CISOs validate their defenses like a hacker for round-the-clock assurance?\n\nJoin this interactive conversation to:\n\nOrganize and execute testing\n\nTurn the report into an action plan\n\nWhat to share with clients and auditors\n\nData doesnâ€™t move itself. Peopleâ€”whether they are negligent, compromised or maliciousâ€”move data in secure and risky ways. The growth in remote work from anywhere and everywhere has redefined the global security perimeter and increased the risk of insider-led data loss for organizations. At the same time, the frequency and volume of insider threats keeps rising, placing a significant burden on security teams to keep pace. Where do you start to stop insider threats?\n\nJoin this session to discuss:\n\nMoving beyond legacy data loss prevention approaches\n\nManaging insider threats and risks in your organization\n\nIncreasing visibility across multiple channels to accelerate incident response\n\nExecutive boardrooms are intimate and interactive sessions designed to foster dynamic dialogue around a specific, strategic topic. These private, closed-door discussions encourage attendee participation and are limited to 15 attendees (seating priority is given to CxOs).\n\nTo reserve your seat, please contact Nick Hall at nick.hall@evanta.com\n\nDigital transformation is a powerful business enabler that is compelling leaders to fundamentally change their technology ecosystems. The potential of technology to unlock value and drive progress has never been greater and the imperative to transform your business, securely, has never been more urgent. With data, users, and devices everywhere, how can CISOs reimagine cybersecurity in a world without boundaries?\n\nJoin this keynote to hear strategies on:\n\nAccelerating transformation with innovative security services, and communicating their value to the business\n\nScaling and simplifying security across the organization, minimizing risk and gaining agility\n\nProtecting today's cloud-first, hybrid workforce with a proactive, intelligent, and radically simple security architecture\n\nUnlike the CISO role of just a few years ago â€“ where many could still focus heavily on the bits and bytes â€“ todayâ€™s security leader is also expected to be a business leader. Uncover strategies with your peers to help you become fluent in the languages of risk, finance and strategy and to effectively convey your message, including:\n\nHow to educate your board on cybersecurity so they become champions for security in your company\n\nWhat the board really wants to hear from CISOs\n\nWhich metrics will help you craft a compelling story that inspires action\n\nThere are two types of organizations â€” those that have been breached and those that will be. Data breaches may be inevitable and do not correlate with the maturity of cyber security programs. Financial services and defense organizations that spent hundreds of millions of dollars on building the most mature security programs still get breached. So, what happens after a breach? Is there still life after a data breach?\n\nJoin this keynote session with Mike Melo as he discusses:\n\nLeading and navigating your company through a data breach and what to do to prepare for it\n\nCommunicating risk to the Board and building their confidence in your security program\n\nChallenges and best practices in managing major security events\n\nAs the role of the CISO becomes increasingly business-oriented, the skill set of todayâ€™s IT leader must become business-technology centric. CISOs are now challenged to identify and mentor those on their teams who possess both the technology skills and business leadership necessary to drive their organization into the future. Leaders have a responsibility to prepare their teams as they face an increasingly complex business and threat landscape.\n\nJoin this session to learn:\n\nHow to elevate the team you have\n\nTactics to upskill and mentor the next generation of talent\n\nSourcing and developing a robust and diverse leadership bench\n\nWhether it comes from across the globe or down the street, the ever-looming threat of a ransomware attack is always in the back of the IT and security executiveâ€™s mind. Get your collaborative and creative juices flowing in this gamified choose your own adventure.\n\nIn this interactive session attendees will:\n\nCollaborate to identify threat responses\n\nRespond to choices and forces out of their control\n\nDiscuss pitfalls and best practices\n\nIn a world of evolving roles and responsibilities, it can be a challenge to decide where to make your next career move. Do you switch to a larger organization with more growth opportunity or move to a smaller company where you can have a larger impact? Peers who have made big moves will share their insight on how they view the chessboard of job progression.\n\nJoin this session to learn:\n\nWhen to say 'yes' or 'no' to that next job\n\nHow to prioritize the right fit\n\nWays to proactively find new opportunities\n\nThe World Economic Forum named creativity one of the top must-have skills for success in all industries. It is the key to thriving in this era of rapid innovation and change. But very few organizations have truly invested in the development of this essential capability. Why? Because creativity is considered too intangible to measure, too messy to fit into a strategic plan or simply something that is only for a few specially talented people. In this engaging presentation, Artist/Author Noah Scalin pulls back the curtain on his own creative practice to explain the real ROI of creativity.\n\nIn this session, we will learn:\n\nWhy creativity is a crucial skill for fostering innovation at your organization\n\nHow to use creativity strategically for long-term impact\n\nSimple strategies that anyone can use to innovate, grow and inspire others"
