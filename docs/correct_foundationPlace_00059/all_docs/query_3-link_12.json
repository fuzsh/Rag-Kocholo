        "text": "Small American publishing house\n\nSibling Rivalry Press is a small press publishing house based in Little Rock, Arkansas founded by Bryan Borland in 2010.[2][3] It features both online and print components as well as the non-profit SRP Foundation, which financially supports the arts.\n\nBryan Borland originally conceived of Sibling Rivalry Press as a vanity press through which to disseminate his collection of poetry, but decided to expand it to encompass other authors whose work focused on similar themes. Authors since published by Sibling Rivalry Press include Ocean Vuong,[4] Michael Klein,[5] Saeed Jones,[6] Kaveh Akbar, Kazim Ali, Franny Choi, Matthew Hittinger, Dorothy Allison,[7] Raymond Luczak,[8] Bushra Rehman,[9] and Stephen S. Mills.[10]\n\nThe SRP website describes its purpose as catering to queer writers of poetry, albeit not exclusively.[11] In 2014, The American Library Association honored nine \"of SRP's titles...on its annual list of recommended LGBT reading\".[12][13]"
