Mr. Krishna synthesizes targeted effort from multiple organizations staffed with government service, military, and contractor personnel to advance the design and integration of command, control, communications, computers, combat systems, and intelligence (C5I) systems planned for the Ohio Replacement Submarine. Specifically, he leads the Ohio Replacement C5I Process Integration Team that oversees the sonar, exterior communications, navigation, radar, imaging, electronic surveillance, fire control, countermeasure launcher, and torpedo tube control system integration teams as part of the Ohio Replacement Design Build Sustain Team. In 2013, he established new procedures and guidance, advanced the C5I design, and set a course that will lead to NPES success throughout the design, construction, and deployment of OHIO Replacement submarines. Employing tremendous foresight, he achieved a C5I design maturity level that supported setting the length of the Command and Control Systems Module (CCSM) an unprecedented eight years ahead of construction start. This enabled the CCSM to be the first Ohio Replacement module with an established length and ultimately supports setting the overall length of the submarine. His mature design also enabled detailed planned for hull mechanical and electrical systems such as electronic auxiliary freshwater, ventilation, and electric power distribution. Mr. Krishna developed a process for the development, review, and submittal of Government Furnished Information (GFI), and submitted the first Ohio Replacement GFI to the prime contractor. Under his guidance the Navy provided all 25 scheduled GFI submittals to the prime contractor on or ahead of schedule. Mr. Krishna developed and implemented a plan to use highly permeable flexible metal conduit for government furnished electrical data cables used to connect electronic bays. He proved his concept is technically feasible by developing a test procedure and then executing the procedure at a government laboratory. His concept reduces electromagnetic interference risk, reduces installation cost, and adds the flexibility to modify government cabling without incurring an additional cost of updating shipbuilder drawings. In addition, Mr. Krishna established noise-monitoring hydrophone count and location to optimize cost and performance, modified the baseline multi-function antenna plan to improve performance while reducing cost, and gained fleet wide support of a plan to improve external communication reliability while minimizing cost to the Ohio Replacement Program. In his current position, Mr. Krishna guides the advancement of submarine C5I.\n\nCAPT Didier A.

While leading her division to Fleet-level recognition, ENS Provenzano has also managed seven of the most critical information related programs on board Gettysburg!\n\nCAPT Jeffrey M. Rohman, USMC\n\n13th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), I Marine Expeditionary Force\n\nCaptain Rohman, as Assistant Communications Officer, has led the planning, systems engineering, systems acquisitions, training, and execution for Pacific Command, Central Command, and Africa Command deployment, three coalition exercises, and five MEU certification exercises. In order to support a variety of missions, MEU communications capabilities have to range from small, highly mobile systems to fully operational joint task force headquarters that could operate at sea or deployed ashore. This task required redesigning of communications systems to make them smaller, faster, and more rapidly deployable. Using the latest technology, Captain Rohman designed systems and networks capable of transmitting tactical data from remote locations to anywhere in the world. Today, many of these innovations are being adopted throughout the Marine Corps. Captain Rohman designed a communications suite around an inflatable satellite communications (SATCOM) antenna. The newly designed system proved to be more capable, lighter, and easier to move. The solution he created is currently supporting units in theater and is being adopted by both the 22nd MEU and Special Marine Air Ground Task Force Crisis Response. In addition, after recent upgrades in Central Command and Africa Command, Captain Rohman coordinated directly to replace outdated terminals with current terminals for all MEUs in the Marine Corps. Captain Rohman also spearheaded an initiative to facilitate the installation of the Department of Defense's standard situational awareness tool on all LSD- and LPD-class ships. Captain Rohman has made a tremendous impact in the command and control field by engineering smaller, more expeditious communications systems that improved capabilities for both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\nSamuel C. Serman\n\nNorfolk Ship Support Activity (NSSA)\n\nMr. Serman is a senior electronics technician for the Satellite Communications Branch within the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Information (C4I) Systems Division. He provides Distance Support, Onsite Technical Assistance, Onsite System Assessments and \"over the shoulder\" training to Fleet Assets, within the NSSA’s area of responsibility (AOR). Mr. Serman developed a new \"streamlined\" process for testing the full functionality of the Satellite Communication Sets (AN/WSC - 6 variants) during technical assist visits, Total System Readiness Assessments (TSRA) and pier side refurbishment efforts. This process includes the use of satellites which provide a loop-back path for the signal under test. This loop-back path allows a technician to send and receive data, testing both transmit and receive circuits, as well as the antenna functions for tracking and movement . Previously, the set -up process for obtaining satellite access was cumbersome and fraught with pitfalls. Many times, NSSA was unable to accomplish its tasking because it could not access satellites. Without this loop-back testing and connection to a satellite, there is no clear way to verify complete system operability. Previously, a ship had to request access 30 days in advance via a Satellite Access Request (SAR) which defines the period of time the access is required. In response, a Satellite Access Authorization (SAA) was returned to the requesting activity defining the parameters, time frame and satellite the ship can interface. Due to ships schedules, world events, personnel availability, etc., assessment event dates are fluid and change constantly unlike the SAAs. Since technical assist visits are usually unscheduled events, satellite access is in most cases not available or if the TSRA schedule slips by a few days, and fails to meet the SAA timeframe. The resolution was to re-work the SAR process for NSSA and all the Regional Maintenance Centers (RMCs) worldwide. The new process provides a clear interface between the satellite controllers and the local RMC accomplishing the test, allowing access to a test channel for a specific satellite. This new process allows almost immediate access to a satellite test channel providing the time to troubleshoot this system faster and more efficiently. This process has been in use now for almost 12 months and has proven itself for nine technical assist visits and multiple TSRAs.\n\nMAJ Jason R. Shockey, USMC\n\n12th Marine Regiment, 3d Marine Division, III Marine Expeditionary Force\n\nMajor Shockey leads, trains, and mentors the Communications Platoon to facilitate planning, installing, operating, and maintaining regimental command and control systems. As the Communications Officer, he has made many specific demonstrable contributions to enhance command, control, communications, and computer capability.

Demonstrating his commitment to advancing the understanding of today’s cyber environment and complex infrastructure, Major Shockey has both educated the regiment (through monthly newsletters and classified briefs, which increased critical information asset protection, increased awareness, created efficiency, and allowed the staff to more thoroughly understand today's cyber threat environment and complex interdependent command and control infrastructure), and also educated the local community (in information and online security through public speaking engagements during off-duty hours). He has assisted with investigations by taking action to detect and respond, report, isolate and contain, acquire, and preserve potential digital evidence. Major Shockey has also created an information technology business continuity/disaster recovery plan to ensure that essential, prioritized business functions can continue with minimal interruption. His specific contributions prove his expertise and have advanced the regiment to a more secure, combat ready state.\n\nLT Charles E. Steele, II, USN\n\nPatrol Squadron Five\n\nLieutenant Steele, the Tactics Officer, is responsible for providing training and integration of the P-8A Poseidon's Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4I) systems across Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing Eleven. He also oversees the Intelligence Department which is responsible for all intelligence tasking operations requirements. While attached to the P-8A Fleet Integration Team, he single-handedly brought to light the incompatibility of the instant messaging program designed for the P-8A and the program used across the Departments of the Navy and Defense. His insight led to a critical change in requirements which will now enable the P-8A to meet Initial Operational Capability and deploy with a compatible instant messaging program. He was significantly responsible in the implementation and training of International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) capabilities on the P-8A. His forward thinking and perseverance resulted in the authorization of critical INMARSAT funding in order to properly train aircrew prior to deployment. He was hand-selected by the Maritime and Patrol Reconnaissance Weapons School to develop Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures on INMARSAT utilization. This included his ingenious method to upload images to a website while airborne. This streamlined the process of data forwarding and allowed for multiple users to have immediate access to critical intelligence data. He was also responsible for the integration of the Expendable Mobile ASN Training Target (EMATT) Portable Target Programmer. This device allows for manipulation of the pre-programmed profiles embedded in the EMATT which enabled users to expeditiously adapt it to mimic current targets. He was also responsible for increasing the efficiency and usage of the EMATT. Due to time constraints, a normal flight consists of approximately three hours on a single EMATT. Realizing this was only approximately 35% of the EMATT's capacity, he coordinated joint exercises across P-SA, P- 3C, and MH - 60R squadrons to use the EMATT to its full potential. A staunch proponent of professional development and initiative, LT Steele dedicated his time to develop the P-8A's first Naval Aviation Technical Information Product publication. This publication contains the technical information of all of the C4 I equipment on the P-SA. He was also responsible for single-handedly developing the P-8A Aircrew Pocket Checklist. During the development, he quickly recognized the inefficiencies of the current process and recommended a change to the Deputy of Airworthiness. This resulted in a significant reduction in content errors and reduced product delivery by six months.\n\nLCDR Yolanda M.

Commander Tripp expertly led five watch teams of more than 300 personnel, managed communications at the most complex communications facility in the Navy, and delivered vital command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence services to surface, subsurface, air, and ground forces in support of U.S. Naval, Joint, and Coalition operating forces worldwide. During her tenure as JFTOC Watch Officer, she led a team of 60 sailors and civilians in providing real-time management of communications within the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Middle East AORs. She expertly performed critical communications shifts for 10 Carrier and Expeditionary Strike Groups ensuring uninterrupted C2 for operational forces, balancing limited resources with rapidly changing operational requirements. She superbly managed all technical and military training for 380 personnel in the Operations Department. Recognizing training deficiencies, she was instrumental in developing and implementing a seven-week Training Academy for command personnel. Using 21 internal subject matter experts, she led the development of 57 podium lectures tailored in three functional areas. The program achieved unprecedented results. Sailors who completed the Academy experienced a 50% reduction in watch station qualification time and were better prepared for mission success. One-hundred seven personnel qualified in their positions and 74 Sailors were promoted after completing the training. Her effort is being shared to improve Navy schoolhouses and saved the Department of Defense $200,000 in contracting costs to develop similar training. Under her leadership, the Operations Department had 85% retention, 25 Basic and Intermediate Qualified Information Professional Officers, 176 Enlisted Information Dominance Warfare Specialist qualifications, and 166 Information Assurance certifications leading to 110 Navy Enlisted Classification designations enabling her Sailors to receive significant re-enlistment bonuses.\n\nLCDR Justin A. Ward, USN\n\nCarrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron 117\n\nLieutenant Commander Ward, as the Training Officer, is responsible for unit combat readiness and proficiency, technical and tactical proficiency and ensuring aircrew progression along the Fleet Air Combat Training Continuum. The E-2C Hawkeye 2000 has supported the Fifth Fleet with Airborne Early Warning and Command and Control for multiple deployments. As the theater operations have matured, the increase in requirements of airborne command and control has driven tasked assets to maximize. The U.S. Air Force Central Command Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in Southwest Asia conducts continuous intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions for theater contingency operations. The CAOC is heavily reliant on U.S. Air Force and shore-based Navy airborne ISR assets. In addition to the theater maturing, the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 has added capability to include an Integrated Broadcast System (IBS) receiver, Automatic Identification System receiver, a Combined Emitter Database electronic intelligence search engine and an Iridium based Internet Relay Chat system. Commander Ward was instrumental in developing and training aircrew on mission systems ensuring 100% maximization. Previous use of new systems was nonexistent across the squadron because of lack of experience and a complex interface. Commander Ward led the efforts to understand and simplify the use of these systems. His efforts provided a significant increase in the find-fix capability of the Hawkeye 2000. Operationally the CAOC was less familiar with the E-2C Hawkeye 2000 and its Electronic Support Measures (ESM) capabilities, including the IBS receiver to collect and track commercial and military electronic emissions, than a legacy E- 2C. Commander Ward helped to integrate the Hawkeye 2000 into the CAOC ISR Division. His efforts led the CAOC to add the Hawkeye to the Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition (RSTA) Schedule. This new tasking helped to build the pattern of life for the Air Component Commander during persistent flights conducted by the Hawkeye. (This was in addition to the maritime surveillance support already provided to the Maritime Component Commander.) Commander Ward also educated the Hawkeye community on the method to gain tasking via the RSTA providing lessons learned to the Hawkeye Weapons School and Type Wing Commander. Having a carrier asset with access to off-board sensor information and local corroborating information speeds the kill chain. Using off board IBS information with correlating local detections greatly increases the number of available mission sets for the Hawkeye 2000. In addition, the access to IBS information provides enhanced situational awareness to the Hawkeye's primary repertoire of airborne command and control, airborne early warning, maritime surveillance, and electronic support. Never before has the Hawkeye~ 2000 been capable of being its own ISR and Command and Control asset. The marriage of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance with trained airborne command and control war fighters is critical to the success of the Navy and its combat capabilities.\n\nSusan E. Whitley\n\nNaval Air Systems Command\n\nMs. Whitley is the Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) Integrated Product Team Lead (IPTL) in the Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209). The MFOQA program is a software application that provides data analysis and visualization of flight data that was initiated in 2005 by the Secretary of Defense in order to reduce aircraft mishaps. MFOQA provides a knowledge management process designed to identify potential human error and other aircraft causal factors before they lead to mishaps. Ms. Whitley is responsible for overall design, development and deployment of the Navy MFOQA program. Ms. Whitley resurrected a program that was behind schedule, over cost, and headed for termination. The Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) described her Herculean efforts as \"the most impressive program turnaround that I have seen in my career.\" Determining that external requirements growth was imposing unacceptable life-cycle cost growth, Ms. Whitley led a 2011 re-baselining effort that created a foundation for success. Ms. Whitley is currently guiding MFOQA to an on cost, on schedule Milestone C decision followed by an Initial Operational Capability. Echoing the MDA’s comments, the Test Readiness Review (TRR) Panel members said that the MFOQA TRR was one of the best they had seen. As a result of her efforts, the MFOQA program is now positioned for true success and the Navy will save millions of dollars that would have been lost if the program had been cancelled. One of her many tasks during the re-baselining was socializing and gaining buy-in for this new methodology with the many MFOQA stakeholders. She also championed the introduction of the MFOQA Engineering Tool (MET), a prototype of the program of record, and successfully campaigned for its fielding at VAQ-129 to support the EA-18G Growler. The MET has subsequently been expanded to four additional fleet squadrons. The result has been acceleration and early development of the next phase of the program which will provide the much needed capabilities at an earlier date for each new type of aircraft. Ms. Whitley masterfully negotiated a contract award that secured government purpose rights to software that was $7.1 million below the originally proposed price and identified other substantial life-cycle cost reductions. One example of this was the architecting of a common data reader that eliminates the need for proprietary readers for each aircraft type, model, series and reduces life-cycle costs by an estimated $85 million.\n\nAward Winners\n\n2013 Copernicus Winners (Accomplishments in 2012)\n\nRobert J. Beers\n\nHopper Information Services Center, Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI)\n\nMr. Beers is Chief Architect, Service Centers and Communications, at the Hopper Information Services Center. He is responsible for the architecture and design of ONI internal networks and for data center planning. Mr. Beers is one of the key players in the Navy's \"Journey to the Cloud.\" He was nominated by Hopper to support the Consolidated Single Network Tiger Team, and served as the team's lead technology architect. The work of Mr. Beers helped jump-start Task Force Cloud for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Dominance (OpNav N2/N6). Concurrently, he supported the first installation of a major cloud computing node at ONI, successfully relocated from the Naval Research Laboratory, where it was prototyped. In early 2012, Hopper designated Mr. Beers the Tiger Team Lead to bring the ONI cloud node to production. The task was made significantly more complex when the Navy committed to using the National Security Agency cloud computing architecture, known as the \"Ghost Machine,\" meaning Mr. Beers could not simply advance from the previous prototype; he and his team had to start over with a totally new baseline. Under the superb technical leadership of Mr. Beers, the high-visibility transition to the ONI cloud node, now called Ghost Machine ONI, is well under way and on trajectory. Mr. Beers has built new bridges to bring ONI into the cloud and positioned ONI to be part of the broader intelligence community cloud that is rapidly taking form. Through his superior vision, extensive technical knowledge, and \"no nonsense\" approach to team leadership, Mr. Beers successfully broke ground to develop, demonstrate, and accelerate the adoption of cloud computing in support of maritime intelligence. His transformational work will enable ONI and the Fleet to bring the power of vast stores of cloud-based data and analytics to bear against today's most challenging threats while setting conditions for the success of tomorrow's fight in the maritime domain.\n\nLT Charles R. Blackwell, USN\n\nPatrol Squadron Five (VP-5), Jacksonville, FL\n\nLieutenant Blackwell epitomizes the best of naval aviation with his charisma, leadership ethos, technical know-how, and tactical expertise. Lieutenant Blackwell seized the initiative when VP-5 was chosen to lead the Fleet introduction of the command, control, communications, and computers for antisubmarine warfare (C4ASW) modification to P-3C aircraft. He formed a select team to test, evaluate, and develop techniques, tactics, and procedures for C4ASW tactical operation. His efforts have redefined the applicability of patrol aviation in the operational and strategic realms, adding Link-16 and international maritime satellite capabilities to P-3C aircraft. The incorporation of these technologies into the P-3 revolutionized maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft’s role with strike group and theater commanders. Lieutenant Blackwell's dedication ensured the introduction of this technology was exploited to its fullest. During the initial introduction, Lieutenant Blackwell and his team tested the user manual and technical publication's applicability in the air, providing valuable feedback that led to streamlined and corrected checklists and publications, and Lieutenant Blackwell co-authored two articles about techniques and procedures for C4ASW implementation to educate the rest of the Maritime Patrol Fleet. He also forged the way in operational use of the C4ASW system in the USS Iwo Jima (LHD-7) for the Composite Training Unit Exercise and Bold Alligator 2012, the largest U.S. amphibious exercise in 10 years. The pinnacle of Lieutenant Blackwell's performance has been in the introduction of C4ASW to the Pacific Command and Seventh Fleet area of responsibility. VP-5 was the first P-3C squadron to receive and use the C4ASW aircraft modification. Lieutenant Blackwell authored a tactics, techniques, and procedures report (TTP) that focused on operationalizing commercial chat technology during reconnaissance operations, providing a critical communication node that enabled missions that would have normally been aborted to continue on-station. He perfected a method to transfer and upload high-resolution handheld digital imagery of contacts of interest onto a squadron intelligence division-built webpage, which has dramatically reduced the reporting cycle and allowed Seventh Fleet headquarters immediate access to high-resolution imagery. His C4ASW TTP has provided a secure reachback communication path for aircrews on detachment to remote locations where standard classified architecture does not exist.\n\nCDR Joseph E. Brennan, USN\n\nTotal Force Requirements Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO)\n\nCommander Brennan is assigned as the Navy Information Dominance Enterprise Manpower Integration Requirements Officer within OpNav N122, Current Manpower Allocations Branch, and serves as a Programming and Policy Advisor to the Chief of Naval Personnel on information dominance corps manpower strategy.

He provided support and training to the OpNav Nl leadership and has briefed the Chief of Naval Personnel and the Director, Navy Cyber Forces, on cyber manpower strategy implementation. Commander Brennan is truly making a significant difference in current and future planning, programming, and execution decisions, which are directly connected to the success of the Navy's cyber warfare mission.\n\nET1 Dustin J. Bruner, USN\n\nCoastal Riverine Squadron Four\n\nElectronics Technician First Class Bruner supervises the day-to-day responsibilities and operations for a department that supports more than 500 personnel in all aspects of communications and network operations for Coastal Riverine Squadron Four. During the merger of Riverine Squadron One and Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron Four, Petty Officer Bruner fused two communications departments into one integrated department. He developed maintenance and operating procedures for the Mobile Ashore Support Terminal System, Radar Sonar and Surveillance Center System, and five Tactical Operations Centers during the first Coastal Riverine Squadron’s establishment. His plan to train current and newly reporting personnel on Coastal Riverine Force communications was adapted as the standard for all future squadrons to follow. Petty Officer Bruner was the driving force during the receipt, testing, training, and acceptance of the first four Deployable Joint Command and Control Rapid Response Kits/Network Enterprise Command and Control (RRK/NETC2) Systems within Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC), providing subordinate commands with the ability to rapidly process and distribute time-sensitive information and intelligence. Applying his technical acumen, Petty Officer Bruner directly contributed to the first successful establishment of Internet protocol connectivity using the wideband global satellite communication constellation's X-band capabilities and saved the Navy approximately $1,500/day per RRK system. Devoted to improving the Navy's command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) capabilities, Petty Officer Bruner committed more than 300 man-hours to overseeing the system operability and performance testing. He worked hand-in-hand with system engineers, leading to increased system reliability for more than 20 systems. A devoted advocate for professional development, Petty Officer Bruner has dedicated his leadership to the design and delivery of the unit-wide Tactical Communications Qualification Program. Due to the effectiveness of this program in Coastal Riverine Squadron Four, it will be fused into the merging of future Coastal Riverine Squadrons.\n\nJoseph M. Burkot\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Operations Systems Center\n\nAs Operations Systems Center (OSC) IT Specialist, Project Officer, Mr. Burkot is in charge of the Coast Guard Portal Enterprise Application within the Operations Systems Center and is responsible for technical oversight of the Coast Guard Portal (CG Portal). He expertly led all aspects of a complete technology upgrade from a complex suite of multiple products on more than 100 servers, to a single MS SharePoint 2010 solution hosted on 50% less hardware. In late 2011, the Coast Guard faced a recurring CG Portal budget increase of more than $600K to cover escalating vendor license fees. No funds were identified in out-year planning for the increases, and no funds were available for an acquisition project. Mr. Burkot’s meticulous fiscal planning and project execution oversight allowed the upgrade to occur under the existing budget and without additional staff. He executed the upgrade project and provided all legacy CG Portal maintenance support with no impact to operational effectiveness. Mr. Burkot also provided distribution-ready communications for sponsor dissemination to the field. These kept key stakeholders informed of any impacts to their roles and responsibilities and resulted in minimal help desk calls after the roll to production. Mr. Burkot’s leadership and focus on legacy system retirement ensured that the project was delivered on schedule to provide the cost containment required in 2013. In addition to the financial benefits, the upgrade provides easier navigation, new capabilities, increased security posture, and alignment with industry and government standards. The disparate toolsets of the legacy portal resulted in a unit’s information, documents, and collaboration activities residing in multiple locations, making it very difficult for users to locate. Users cannot easily access all information from one unit home page. The upgraded portal also provides document management, a capability lacking in the legacy system that drove users to develop costly workarounds. SharePoint 2010 also provides new features “out of the box,” such as the ability to develop workflows. This is functionality desired by users can now be offered without the expense of additional software products. Enhanced security was implemented through the use of a gateway appliance methodology centrally managed by an enterprise team. It also resulted in the retirement of specialized software, the associated hardware, and reduced the complexity of portal maintenance. The upgraded portal also provides the foundation for consolidation of other preexisting SharePoint sites into the governed enterprise environment. This will reduce the Coast Guard’s information assurance risk exposure, retire redundant hardware, and reduce license costs. The SharePoint Coast Guard Portal has provided immediate cost containment, improved security, enhanced user functionality, and positions the Coast Guard of additional benefits in the future.\n\nLCDR Robert C.
