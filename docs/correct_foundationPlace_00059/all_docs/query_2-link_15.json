        "text": "Borland To Support Linux Desktop With Upcoming Kylix[tm] Development Platform\n\nLas Vegas, Nev. — November 15, 2000 — Inprise Corporation (Nasdaq: INPR), herein referred to as Borland, today at the Linux Business Expo announced its reaffirmed commitment to open-source development by joining the GNOME Foundation Advisory Board. Borland teams with firms such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Red Hat and Helix Code to foster development of the GNOME desktop environment and application framework.\n\n“The GNOME Foundation is pleased to have the support of Borland,” said Miguel Icaza, founder of the GNOME Project. “Borland’s long history of component architecture experience will be invaluable to helping further the Bonobo component project in creating reusable software components and compound documents. We are looking forward to their contributions to GNOME and their work to help developers bring their applications to the GNOME platform using Kylix[tm].”\n\nBorland is introducing the first rapid application development (RAD) platform, Kylix, which aims to enable users to quickly and easily build and deploy native Linux® applications. Kylix will be based on the design of Borland’s award-winning Delphi[tm] and C++ Builder[tm].\n\n“We’re delighted to become a part of the GNOME Foundation and to help take GNOME award development to RAD developers,” said Michael Swindell, director of product management of the RAD Tools group at Borland.\n\n“Borland’s participation in the GNOME Foundation aims to help developers build great GNU/Linux applications that look, feel, and behave natively in multiple desktop environments,”continued Michael. “A significant part of this effort will be working closely with GNOME’s Bonobo component project and companies like Eazel and Helix Code to deliver Bonobo component support to Kylix developers.”\n\nAbout Kylix[tm]\n\nKylix is intended to be the first high-performance rapid application development (RAD) platform for the Linux platform. Kylix is a component-based development environment for two-way visual development of graphical user interface (GUI), Internet, database and server applications. Kylix will be powered by a new high-speed native Delphi/C/C++ compiler for Linux and will implement a native Linux, and cross-platform version of the Borland VCL (Visual Component Library) architecture called CLX[tm]. CLX is designed to radically speed native Linux application development and simplify the porting of Delphi and C++ Builder applications between Windows® and Linux operating systems.

The GNOME Foundation will provide organizational, financial and legal support to the GNOME project, and help determine its vision and roadmap. GNOME is part of the GNU project, an effort to build a completely free Unix-like operating system better known as GNU/Linux or Linux. Additional information is available at http://www.gnome.org/.\n\nAbout Borland\n\nInprise Corporation, referred to in this press release as Borland, is a leading provider of Internet access infrastructure and application development tools and services for all major platforms, including Linux, Solaris[tm] and Windows.
