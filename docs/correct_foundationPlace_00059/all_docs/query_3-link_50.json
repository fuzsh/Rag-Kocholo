Second, the firm is consistently ranked by Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, and CapitalIQ as a leading advisor to companies and underwriters based on the number of completed IPOs and other public offerings. And third, the firm was recently ranked among the top firms worldwide, based on the number of M&A deals, in the 2024 Global M&A Review published by LSEG.\n\nIn addition, we are consistently ranked as the nation's leading law firm representing venture-backed companies, counseling thousands of entrepreneurs starting new businesses and advising on initial formation, equity structures, investor negotiations, intellectual property rights, and other issues vital to their success.\n\nEstablished Connections to U.S. and Non-U.S. Investment Sources\n\nThe firm has an established, ever-growing network of contacts in the most important investment communities for start-ups and growth companies. From angel investors and accelerators to investment banks and venture capital firms, we offer clients important connections to funding sources throughout the U.S. and in many key non-U.S. markets.\n\nComprehensive U.S. Corporate, Commercial, IP, Employment, Regulatory, and Litigation Representation\n\nWith more than 950 attorneys and 19 offices in technology and business hubs worldwide, Wilson Sonsini has the capacity to meet the diverse U.S. needs of technology-driven companies based outside of the U.S., and sophisticated transactional practices to assist clients as they grow and evolve.\n\nWhen our clients are ready to raise additional capital, our corporate finance attorneys help them complete equity, debt, and structured finance transactions. As our corporate clients expand, they rely on the firm's finance, M&A, IP, technology transactions, tax, and real estate practices, among others. Our attorneys have also handled numerous spin-off and going-private transactions on behalf of corporate clients.\n\nIn addition, Wilson Sonsini has experienced employment, executive compensation, and employee benefits attorneys to help our clients manage people, products, and processes, and retain and manage talented executives and staff.\n\nOur intellectual property and trade secret practices protect the valuable, innovative products and business processes that form our clients’ foundation. As these ideas and innovations continue to develop, our attorneys are able to provide strategic patent and trademark counsel. We also help our clients manage their global IP portfolios, including patent and trademark filings and maintenance in U.S. and non-U.S. markets. Further, we advise companies on how to retain their IP rights and trade secrets as employees leave their organizations.\n\nWilson Sonsini frequently represents clients in scores of proceedings involving federal and state regulatory agencies, particularly the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), and their state equivalents. We have successfully defended clients against claims of anti-competitive behavior, consumer fraud, privacy law violations, cybersecurity breaches, and securities law infractions. Further, as regulatory pressures have increased with respect to the exportation of goods to (and business conduct in) global markets, our attorneys, many of whom previously held positions with the SEC, Department of Justice, and other government agencies, are well-placed to assist clients facing government inquiries and/or investigations, including those related to export controls and economic sanctions, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) laws, and matters involving Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and national security issues.\n\nAs companies grow, unfortunately, they often become involved in a proportionately larger number of business disputes. Our attorneys have successfully represented clients engaged in litigation with competitors, suppliers, service providers, employees, and other entities, with disputes ranging from private antitrust lawsuits to high-stakes patent litigation. We have also successfully defended companies in class actions, including antitrust, consumer, and securities litigation matters. In addition to representing companies in federal and state courts throughout the U.S., our attorneys represent corporate clients in arbitrations and mediations.\n\nAs our clients continue to expand in the U.S, we are well-positioned to provide support with respect to the following areas, among others:\n\nEarly corporate organization\n\nVenture financing and private equity\n\nCorporate (M&A and public equity-IPO exit)\n\nTax\n\nIntellectual property\n\nTechnology transactions\n\nEmployment and executive compensation/benefits matters\n\nCommercial contracts and partnerships\n\nData privacy\n\nRegulatory (antitrust, privacy and data protection, exports, FCPA/CFIUS)\n\nLitigation\n\nReal estate\n\nThis interdisciplinary approach, along with the breadth and depth of our practice, allows us to serve as a strategic advisor through each stage of a company's growth.\n\nWhen technology-driven companies decide to enter the U.S. market—whether to expand, raise investment capital, or pursue a key transaction—Wilson Sonsini offers those companies distinct advantages:\n\nUnmatched experience representing U.S. and non-U.S. growth companies\n\nEstablished connections to U.S. and non-U.S. investment sources\n\nComprehensive U.S. corporate, commercial, IP, employment, regulatory, and litigation representation\n\nThe firm’s U.S. expansion team has advised hundreds of non-U.S. start-up and growth-stage technology companies, including clients based in Canada, South and Central America, Australia, Greater Asia, the U.K., Israel, and much of the EMEA region.\n\nWe also work closely with key local stakeholders in those regions—investors, accelerators, incubators, professional advisors, strategic partners, and government economic development agencies—to provide home market support on U.S. matters and ensure our clients have the right teams around them to succeed in the United States.\n\nUnmatched Experience Representing U.S. and Non-U.S. Growth Companies\n\nNot only does the firm have attorneys focused on advising companies expanding into the U.S., but our 60-plus years of experience representing growth-oriented enterprises have helped us become the premier legal service provider to U.S. technology, life sciences, and energy companies.\n\nFirst, Wilson Sonsini is consistently ranked No. 1 for the number of company-side deals handled each year, according to LSEG.
