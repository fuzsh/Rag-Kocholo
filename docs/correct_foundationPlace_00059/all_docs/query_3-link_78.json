        "text": "Leslye Heilig, Co-Chair of Together Women Rise Advocacy Group with RESULTS\n\nAdvocacy, News\n\nAdvocacy Accomplishments in 2022\n\n2022 was a very successful year for Together Women Rise’s Advocacy Group with RESULTS. There were many accomplishments to celebrate: the successful replenishment of The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria; the passage of the Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act; progress toward passage of both the End TB Now Act and the READ Act Reauthorization. It has truly been an exceptional year. Details\n\nTogether Women Rise\n\nNews, Together Women Rise\n\nBoard Happenings: Our Recent Fall Retreat\n\nBy Jo DeBolt, Together Women Rise Board Chair\n\nDuring the first weekend of October, the Together Women Rise Board of Directors met in Charlotte to reflect on our past and plan for the future, especially as we approach our 20th anniversary next year. We came armed with data on our grant making, chapter development, participation in programs and events, and responses from the recent member survey. We started, though, with stories. Over dinner on our first night, Co-Founder Barb Collins shared stories of several early grantees. Some of these grantees went on to gain significant recognition and extended their work far beyond what they originally imagined might be possible. It reminded us that we don’t spend enough time learning from the relationships we’ve built and celebrating their successes. It’s fuel for the soul. Details\n\nTogether Women Rise\n\nNews, Partnerships\n\nAnnouncing Our First Transformation Partnership!\n\nLast year, we announced our plans to launch new Transformation Partnerships that will allow us to better address the root causes of gender inequality. We must take a systems change approach in order to reach our goal of global gender equality. This includes addressing the social and cultural norms, beliefs, practices, and laws that prevent women from having equal access to resources, decision-making power, and opportunity. We are now thrilled to announce our first-ever Transformation Partnership! Details\n\nTogether Women Rise\n\nNews, Partnerships, Together Women Rise\n\nTransformation Partnerships Coming Up!\n\nBy Scott Osborne and Sue Malick, Co-Chairs of the Transformation Partnerships Committee\n\nYou have probably heard about Transformation Partnerships at your local chapter meeting, at one of our national webinars, or here in The Dish. (See below for links to previous blogs.) Transformation Partnerships are our newest grants, dedicated to funding the root causes of gender inequality.

I wanted to take this opportunity to introduce myself to you today and also make myself a resource for you moving forward. Details\n\nTogether Women Rise\n\nImpact, News, Partnerships\n\nImpact Partnership Grants Fund Collaborative Approach to Gender Equality\n\nThanks to your generous support of Together Women Rise in 2021, our Board has approved two, $50,000 Impact Partnership Grants to AMPLIFY Girls and The Colectivo.\n\nIn the past, we awarded Impact Partnership Grants to UNICEF USA and the Peace Corps. Our new Impact Partnership Grants are taking us in a new direction, funding “collectives” — networks of organizations working together to increase their impact on a shared goal. “By funding this collective approach, we can have a deeper impact and more sustainable outcomes for women and girls,” said Betsy Smulyan, Interim President and CEO. “We are particularly excited to invest in AMPLIFY and The Colectivo because these networks include several of Rise’s past grantees.”\n\nDetails\n\nTogether Women Rise\n\nGrantees, News\n\nRecent Events in Haiti and Afghanistan\n\nOur hearts go out to the people of Haiti following the August 14 earthquake, and to the people of Afghanistan whose country is in crisis. We have reached out to our grantees in both countries to find out how they are being affected and what members can do to help, and we have put together a summary of what we have learned. Pleases follow our social media for regular updates about our grantees and the situations in Haiti and Afghanistan. Details\n\nTogether Women Rise\n\nGrantees, News\n\nNepal Hit by Second Wave of COVID-19: Updates from Our Grantees\n\nThe news reports out of India over the past few months have been heart-breaking as the country has experienced a disastrous, second COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in over 400,000 new cases daily at its peak. Now, Nepal is suffering a similar fate with a devastating second wave of COVID-19. Latest reports are that Nepal is considering declaring a health emergency as the virus rampages across its country. BlinkNow Foundation, a Together Women Rise grantee, recently posted on its Facebook page that the number of COVID-19 cases in Nepal has increased over 2000% in the past month. BlinkNow also states that nearly 65 per cent of COVID-19 tests in their region have been positive. Details\n\nBeth Ellen Holimon, President & CEO\n\nGrantees, News, President's Perspectives, Together Women Rise\n\nUpdate on Modifications to Grants Program Due to COVID\n\nI am very excited to share two announcements in regards to Together Women Rise’s grant making!\n\nWhen the COVID pandemic negatively affected donations last spring, Together Women Rise took some precautionary measures to address the challenging and uncertain times that all nonprofits were facing. We wanted to ensure that we could continue to support our grantees while also keeping our organization sustainable throughout the crisis. Details\n\nBeth Ellen Holimon, President & CEO\n\nNews, Together Women Rise\n\nNone of Us Will See Gender Equality in Our Lifetimes\n\nThis is a sobering statement. It was also one of the headlines in late 2019 when the World Economic Forum released its latest Global Gender Gap Report. According to the report, it will take 99.5 years — more than a lifetime — for women and men to reach parity across health, education, work, and politics.\n\nThat is why Dining for Women is more committed\n\nthan ever to achieving global gender equality.

Less than a year ago we were hammering out the details of our 2020 Vision and on March 8th we met the First Lady of the United States to celebrate our partnership with the Peace Corps’ Let Girls Learn program.\n\nDFW’s Partnership Program is now initiated with this proactive, issue-based funding for girls education. This partnership allows us to coordinate our work with other organizations to make a global impact. It is the necessary balance to our Featured Grants in which we are able to respond to needs identified by in-country organizations. Now, in the company of organizations like Proctor and Gamble, Amy Poehler’s Smart Girls, J. Crew, and Salesforce Foundation, we are part of a bigger movement to eliminate the barriers to education for girls all over the world. Details\n\nBarb Collins\n\nConnections, News, Together Women Rise\n\nIt’s Personal\n\nYes, being in the same room with change-maker champions and meeting First Lady Michelle Obama was a big moment for Dining for Women. Announcing a cross-sector strategic partnership through a $100,000 grant to the Peace Corps’ Let Girls Learn Fund is a defining moment. But at the end of the day, it’s all about impact. It’s all about the girls. And it’s personal. Details\n\nTogether Women Rise\n\nChapters, For chapters, For leaders, For members, Fundraising, News, Together Women Rise\n\nNEW!!
