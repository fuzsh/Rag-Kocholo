        "text": "We serve with visionary leadership\n\nWe strive for collaborative and equitable relationships to benefit the future of our community.\n\n“Leadership is the art of giving people a platform to spread ideas that work.” - Seth Godin\n\nWe steward investments with integrity\n\nWe tend your generous contributions with active engagement, opportunities for growth, and long-term considerations.\n\n“Investing isn’t a value system, it’s an investing strategy, but it works better if you’re fighting for something you truly believe in.” -Phil Town\n\nWe cultivate a culture of giving and caring\n\nWe make a difference through local philanthropy.\n\n“Philanthropy, like charity, must begin at home; from this center our sympathies should extend in an ever-widening circle.” – Charles Lamb\n\nWe embrace excellence\n\nWe strive for excellence through reliability, accountability, and professionalism.\n\n\"Excellence is never an accident; it is the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction, skillful execution and the vision to see obstacles as opportunities\" - Aristotle\n\nWe forge innovative growth\n\nAs catalysts in our community, we work to move peoples’ passions to actions while acknowledging our foundation of diverse histories, cultures, and experiences.\n\n“Sometimes you have to create a vision, a path for a vision. It may not be apparent, and you may have to forge it yourself.” - Herbie Hancock\n\nAt Onward, A Legacy Foundation, together, we elevate our communities.\n\n“There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about.” - Margaret Wheatley\n\n\"With the support of Onward!, The Hive was able to have a licensed therapist on site for 10\n\nhours per week. This individual offered one on one session for 32 youth participants, 6 family\n\nmembers and 4 of our Hive staffers. It was recognized that in order to provide healthy and\n\nmindful programs, our Staff sometimes needed the therapeutic support to be present with our\n\nyouth everyday. The youth that received support came in consistently to meet with her each\n\nweek and we feel like the one on one offering provided the most significant impact for youth and their families.\n\nWe truly appreciate the support of Onward Foundation and look forward to working with you\n\nin the future!\"\n\nKelsie Borland\n\nThe Hive DGO\n\nGrant Awardee\n\n“We feel that placing our $150,000 endowment fund with Onward has increased our credibility among community members, especially among the business community, and enhanced ongoing fundraising.”\n\nBarbara Stagg\n\nMontezuma County Historical Society dba Montezuma Heritage Museum\n\nGrant Awardee\n\n\"There were ten juveniles who completed substance abuse evaluations and had nice counseling sessions as a result of those evaluations. The funds helped the ten juveniles with identified risk factors learn more effective coping strategies along with resistance skills that will help them remain clean and sober.\"\n\nAnn Welton\n\nThe Recovery Center\n\nGrant Awardee\n\n“Onward! A Legacy Foundation’s financial support played a crucial role in helping our organization navigate the challenges of the past few years and ensured that we could continue providing essential services to people with disabilities in the region. We are deeply grateful for your partnership in these very trying times.”\n\nLisa Branner\n\nCommunity Connections, Inc.\n\nGrant Awardee\n\n“We are so thankful to Onward! for their funding and support of our organization. It's difficult\n\nto express in words what it means to have a building that we can be proud of and only seems\n\nto get better with each year's passing. We have always been proud of our ROCK building, but\n\nevery time we drive up and see how much better it looks with a new deck, it puts a smile on\n\nour faces.”\n\nCarol Marie Howell\n\nReaching Out to Community and Kids (ROCK)\n\nGrant Awardee\n\n\"The Board of Directors of SouthWest Colorado Concerts are very appreciative of Onward!
