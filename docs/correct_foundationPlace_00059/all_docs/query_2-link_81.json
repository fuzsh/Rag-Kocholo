        "text": "ABOUT NES FOUNDATION\n\nThe Nickajack Elementary Foundation is a non-profit organization operated by a Board of Directors comprised of parents, faculty, and staff for the benefit of our school. We receive our funds from individual donors and businesses who receive a tax benefit for their donation.\n\nThe foundation was formed in 2010 by parents and the administration to supplement the school’s curriculum and programming budget, ensuring a competitive education in all areas of learning. Our mission is to raise money for the school that will allow our school’s administration to fund elements of and/or enrich curriculum programs and student services.\n\nThe Foundation raises money each fall through the Back the Jack Campaign, which runs from late August to late September. At the completion of the campaign, the Foundation works with the administration and teachers to determine which curriculum and technology programs/areas would benefit from Foundation support. This past year, in addition to our signature STEAM Days, STEAM Night, we supported programs including: WriteScore, Orton-Gillingham Phonics Training, Typing Club, Imagine Learning, the Share Your Story writing program, as well as acquiring the newly installed NASA Trailer! For the past 10 years, we have also supported our teacher grant program, providing teachers direct support for their classroom needs, funding projects such as art kits, classroom books, 3D printers, gardening supplies, and sensory bins as well as professional development opportunities and conferences. The 2024-2025 school year presents another exciting opportunity to support the schools’ projects such as continued Teacher Grants, enhanced Phonics training, Literacy Kits for first grade, school-wide STEAM days throughout the year, physical improvements, and support for Specials classrooms.\n\nIf you would like to help raise money for our programs, please donate to the NES Foundation and volunteer for any of our upcoming events.\n\nThe Nickajack Elementary Foundation is a 501(c)3 organization and is committed to providing our children with a competitive, twenty-first century education. Your donations are tax deductible."
