        "text": "Biographical Information\n\nPrincipal Kenneth Borland's vision of a progressive, technological future for his students was a guiding force behind the 1993 establishment of Walnut Creek Middle School in Fairview. The school's extensive media resources include videoconferencing and broadcasting capabilities, which have been used for everything from interacting with students in Ireland to discussing curricular issues with educators across Pennsylvania. Dr. Borland provides a wide spectrum of educational and extracurricular programs, including a daycare center; peer mediation and conflict resolution programs; intergenerational activities involving area senior citizens, known as \"Wisdom Keepers;\" student-run community recycling; and a highly involved PTA. A team-oriented leader, Dr. Borland frequently solicits input from his staff and has formed several partnerships with local businesses and universities."
