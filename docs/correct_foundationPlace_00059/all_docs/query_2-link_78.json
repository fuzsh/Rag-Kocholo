        "text": "It’s been three and a half years since Chris Borland shockingly retired from the NFL at the age of 24 after one season with the 49ers. The former Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and star at Wisconsin cited concerns about brain injuries as his reason.\n\nThese days, Borland is a consultant for a variety of groups. He works on incorporating meditation into athletics by conducting original research with the Center for Healthy Minds in Madison. He does similar work for SIYLI (Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute), and he is an advocate for the Concussion Legacy Foundation, Gridiron Greats and the After the Impact Fund.\n\nBorland spoke Thursday in Chicago at an event benefitting the Brain Research Foundation. He sat down with The Athletic to discuss what he has learned since he retired and the future of the NFL.\n\nWhy did the Brain Research Foundation appeal to you as an organization to come speak?\n\nIt seemed (to be tilted) toward youth, which was exciting. And that’s true because the first people that reached out to me were from the young leadership board. And with that (comes) more innovation, a more positive approach. I think particularly with mental health more broadly, there’s still a stigma attached and largely I think that’s the old guard. Younger people are more open about their mental health and I’m all for that. A combination of those factors was why this was appealing to me.\n\nYou’re speaking tonight in front of an audience that is made up of majority millennials. How different is it to talk to young people about this than older generations?\n\n(It’s different) in terms of stigma specifically —I think we’re more open, generally, as millennials and more transparent and like to talk about what’s going on and that includes personal issues and mental health. I think some of that may have to do with social media. Other differences are just difference in upbringing. Certainly with brain injuries, I think it’s really changed the last decade. Sadly it’s a huge problem in football. I think one silver lining to that is it’s illuminated middle America to the importance of mental health. I think millennials are open to talking about it and I have noticed a difference between generations past and kids today.\n\nWhen do you miss football?\n\nI don’t really miss it unless I’m around it, and I’m rarely around it. It’s faded a lot in the past three years. I can tell you the first season and probably the second, I felt viscerally, like when August was rolling around I could feel like I was ready to play, but there were no games. That was just something to adjust to. I wouldn’t say I miss it. A lot of it is really difficult and even when you’re in it, the parts you cherish are the locker room and the games and there’s a lot else you have to do between those spaces. I really miss 5-10 percent of it, and I could do without 90-95 percent of it.\n\nSome people try to have a cognitive dissonance with the game, where they acknowledge the health risks, but also that it’s an exciting sport to watch. Can you have that cognitive dissonance and separation when you watch football?\n\nI haven’t watched. I don’t, and it’s not out of protest. It’s not taking a stance. I just don’t think it’s worth it with what’s a stake. I’ve seen how the sausage is made. I empathize with fans because I’ve had that cathartic experience. I’ve played and I got to see it all. If you’ve never had that, it may be a chance each Sunday to tap into that more primal enjoyment of the violence and of the spectacle. For me, I’ve lived it and I’m doing a lot now where I’m busy and fulfilled. I don’t really dwell on it.\n\n“Throwing a flag on a routine tackle to make a point isn’t substantive.”\n\nIs the helmet rule a good thing for the NFL?\n\nI think it’s disingenuous. 110 of 111 brains didn’t have CTE because quarterbacks are being sacked. To throw a flag when a player is tackled, the G-force he’s experiencing to his brain is far less than every single snap at the line when they’re running an offensive play. It includes the whole box, so anywhere from 7-9 guys on both sides of the ball. I think it’s for PR. I don’t think it’s a substantive measure. And it’s a red herring. They want people to talk about that rather than to talk about the fact that the core of the game is how these problems develop. The inaction beyond that is problematic. There’s no support for former players. The settlement isn’t what it’s been portrayed to be. (The NFL is) a $15 billion annual business — that’s on the books. They make a lot of money in other ways, too. Yeah, you could allot 3-10 percent of that money, a tremendous amount of money, they would never do it, but to actually help people. Throwing a flag on a routine tackle to make a point isn’t substantive.\n\nFrom your research, have you learned if there is anything that can be done at the NFL level to alleviate some of the risks that come from the sub-concussive hits?\n\nThere are some novel ideas about having everybody start in a two-point stance or having accelerometers in the helmets. I think between the lines, the game is about as safe as it can be while still being football. I’m not even a proponent — people are befuddled when I tell them, because I have an advocate hat on, but also a linebacker hat on, so I’d be pissed if I were making a routine tackle and got a flag and fined. Because oftentimes, that very tackle is going to be used in promotion of the next week’s game. If you’re going to make money and have an industry built on a game, let the players play the game. I think players should be informed and I still don’t think that’s going on. In terms of changing the game, I think we’re at a point where it’d be hard to change it anymore within the lines. I’m all for waiting (until high school to play tackle football), all for reducing contact at the college level, compensating and insuring players, which is a whole other can of worms, but holistically, this problem exists not just in the NFL but in the lifespan of an NFL player. There are studies on players who started later being healthier. I think it’s a little bit of a shell game to say we need to change the game itself. I think a true approach to be effective would be to change all levels of the game. Change the finances and ensure health insurance for players.\n\nRecently, the Panthers hired an in-house psychological clinician to help players with mental health. How can that benefit players if organizations make it available?\n\nI think it’s good in the short-term. We had a sports psychologist in San Francisco. I work with Wisconsin’s athletic department in meditation. There’s a meditation and mental skills coach for the Seahawks. Yeah, I think it’s great in the short-term. I don’t think it’s meant to, and it doesn’t address longer-term issues. But absolutely, absent an injury, it’s a difficult life to live in that milieu. No one’s going to empathize with you because you’re making a lot of money and you’re famous, but it is hard, and people playing football are human beings. A lot of these guys also come from backgrounds that are tough, and they’re the meal ticket for as many as a dozen or more people in their family. So to have an outlet, to have someone to talk to and to work on mental skills I think is a great idea. I think every team in the NFL, every team in sports, every company should have someone in that type of role.\n\nWhere do you think football will be in 10 years, and is your answer to that the same as where you want football to be in 10 years?\n\nI’m not passionate about football’s future. I’m apathetic. If it’s banned in five years, it doesn’t affect my life. Where I want it to be, I want it to be honest. I don’t care what the game looks like. To me, I was never turned off by the violence, more about the deceit and the industry-funded science that continues. Just let players know. Sadly, players think they know, but if you look into who’s telling them and what they’re saying, they don’t. So I’d like for in 10 years for football to be honest.\n\nOne tangible thing I’d like for there to be is no tackle football for children. I think that’s absurd in a lot of ways and for a lot of reasons. I think if you wait until high school, 95 percent of people don’t play beyond high school, so I’d like to see football move in that direction. I’ll mention amateurism again — that’ll take forever, too. But I think giving people their basic economic rights is inevitable and it’s hard to justify. I had lunch with Kirk Ferentz in Iowa two days ago. We have the same agent. He makes like $5 million-6 million. That’s hard to justify when the players don’t get a dime. This is a rambling answer, but I’d like for football to be honest, delay and waiting (at the youth levels), reduced contact overall. The likelihood of that happening is very low. There’s so much money at stake. I just don’t see it happening in 10 years. I think unfortunately it will play out in lawsuits. It doesn’t have to happen that way, but every kid who wears a helmet and gets brain damage has a case against the league they played for and the helmet manufacturer, and that’s starting to happen. It’s unfortunate but I understand that’s their only recourse.\n\nHave you ever met with Roger Goodell?\n\nNo.\n\nIs that something you would want to do?\n\nI don’t even feel like I’d be talking to a person. I’m not going to waste my time with that.\n\nWhat did you think when you saw Vontae Davis retire at halftime?\n\nHe’s played for 10 years in the pros, those guys deal with a lot. I can understand. I don’t think you walk out at halftime no matter what, but no judgment of him, that’s his prerogative. I get it. There’s a lot of guys who have those moments, particularly when you’re hurt and you’re not immersed in the game and you take a step back and look at it more objectively, ‘What the hell am I doing?’ I heard Gary Plummer, former linebacker for the 49ers, say that recently, and I’ve had that experience. I was away from football for four months after quitting and I went to Oregon State’s spring game, and I had run a marathon, I had lost weight, I hadn’t been around football. I’m just seeing these 320-pound men collide into one another and I couldn’t really believe I was doing that five months ago. I get what he’s going through. I would have gone about it a different way, but you’ve gotta respect a man’s decision to stop hurting himself.\n\nWe’re seeing with Earl Thomas and Le’Veon Bell players pointing out the injury risks in their respective contract situations. You’ve discussed the need for fully guaranteed contracts, and when you see what those two players are going through, what do you think of their tactics, and can this become a trend?\n\nWithout knowing the specifics of either, I’ve kind of heard it second-hand, I think it’s easy to make a scapegoat out of a player who’s holding out or wants more money or whatever. Most of the time, the players are right, and they have no other recourse other than to take that action. Their hand has been forced, but it’s something that can be built on the front end (with) guaranteed contracts. The only sport without guaranteed contracts is probably the No. 1 sport that should have them. I understand them and I’d encourage people to empathize a little bit with what’s going on. You’ve got an average of about three years to make a living as a pro football player and so, most people would do the same thing in their career if faced with that type of situation playing a sport that’s so violent. It’s hard because it’s a team sport and you want to be there for your teammates and you want to win. I think family has to come first and that’s the decision they’re making.\n\nDo you ever receive negative feedback from anyone still in the league considering how outspoken you’ve been about the negative aspects of the sport?\n\nI’ve gotten criticism. Never to my face. There are guys that will say things in a roundabout way, like, ‘We know what we’re getting ourselves into,’ or they’ll call me soft. I’d happily discuss the intricacies of brain injury and the research and what I’ve done the past three years.\n\nIf they called you soft they probably didn’t watch you play.\n\nYeah, I mean, it’s not a well-thought-out opinion, I don’t think. I’ve gotten some blowback. My friends, actually people would be surprised to see how cordial it is. We just agree to disagree. I’m there for them if they ever need help or need advice or have questions. I’ve done that dozens of times for active players. It’s OK to disagree with people. In society we’ve forgotten you can have friends you disagree with and I’ve got plenty of those.\n\nYou said in April that it was criminal that Colin Kaepernick and, at the time, Eric Reid didn’t have jobs in the NFL. You have two brothers in the military, you played with both players in San Francisco, so what’s been your view over the past two years on the national anthem and how Kaepernick, Reid and others have been treated?\n\nThe fact that it was allowed to ever be construed as an anthem protest is bullshit. Rosa Parks wasn’t protesting public transportation either. That’s just nonsense. Certain media outlets trying to blow up a story and pit people against one another. The military is maybe the most diverse population of any American company, government organization, entity. It draws from every class, every race. To use military members as a pawn in some political game, or even to juxtapose them with Colin’s stance — he was advised to kneel by a Green Beret. It’s foolish, to put it kindly.\n\nI have two brothers who are active duty army. One is in the JAG corps in DC, the other teaches at West Point. When you join the military, you sign up to defend the constitution, not a flag. They fight for Colin to be able to do that. It’s this false dichotomy. Kaepernick is not anti-military in the least bit. The flag stands for every American whether you’ve served at war or whether you’re a black kid in Chicago. There’s nothing really to fight over. This is a fake fight going on. I don’t know if you saw Beto O’Rourke’s comments, but I think he put it perfectly. And rather than fight, we can actually have a genuine conversation about what he’s protesting, because it is a real problem and there’s progress to be made. A lot of NFL players have spearheaded substantive efforts with Congress members to make change. Kap and E-Reid, Chris Long, Malcolm Jenkins, the list goes on and on. Here are men who have donated all of their salary in some cases, like Chris, putting their money with their mouth is, same with Kap — he’s donated over a million dollars of his own money, does work in the inner cities constantly. I’m in full support of him and in full support of my brothers. I know they feel the same way. And I think it’s a shame military members are used as a pawn in a political argument. They didn’t sign up for that. That’s not fair to them.\n\nEarlier, you described almost a utopia NFL, if they were up front about the risks, had fully-guaranteed contracts, etc. Is this even possible, and if the league got more progressive in that way, could you see yourself being involved in the game in some way?\n\nFirst off, I don’t think they’re going to do that. They’ve literally hired the same firms that represented “Big Tobacco” to work for them. [Editor’s Note: The New York Times published a piece in 2016 about the NFL’s connections to the tobacco industry. The Times found “no direct evidence that the league took its strategy from Big Tobacco” but “records show that the two businesses shared lobbyists, lawyers and consultants.” A lawyer for the league said the NFL had “no connection to the tobacco industry.”] I’m not holding my breath. But yeah, I keep an open mind. If there were scientific breakthroughs and we had a better understanding of who is pre-disposed genetically and all these factors, and you could find a way to play it safely, I’d get on the first flight back to Madison and try to coach the linebackers. Not holding my breath on that either. There’s going to be no utopian NFL. Because of the settlement and the language in the settlement, players can’t sue for CTE for 65 years. Frank DeFord, the sports journalist, before he died talked about this issue not as being a commentary on brain health, but more on class and race. So long as there are kids who don’t have other options, they’re going to play football. I think that’s already happening in college football and the SEC and the NFL. It’s a very touchy subject, but I’d be hard-pressed to say it’s not true.\n\n(Photo: Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images file)"
