CLIENT-SERVER TOOLS BULLETIN January 2001 - Page 7407© 2001 ComputerWire PLC Produced by ComputerWire and Distributed by Section 7: Digest of Client/Server Tools Borland Corporation Product Overview Microsoft and — on a smaller scale — the new Borland Software Corporation have the client/server tools market pretty much to them- selves. In Borland’s first incarnation, the applica- tion development tools space was extremely crowded (remember PowerBuilder?), but the rise of Microsoft left a great many fatalities (or at least stretcher cases). “Borland is on the move again,” proclaimsFrankSlootman,VP&GeneralManager of Borland’s Software Products operation. It would have been hard to predict Microsoft’s rapid retreat from the Java space. Back in the spring of 2000, Microsoft evangelists were en- couraging developers to code Windows applica- tions in Java. But by the end of 2000, Microsoft’s Visual J++ product had vanished. C# — Microsoft’s response to Sun’s lawsuit — will not kill Java; indeed, in the enterprise space, it is un- likely to even dent it. Visual Cafe — a long time front runner — is now owned by BEA/WebGain, and seems to have lost the independent image it possessed with Symantec. It is therefore not sur- prising to see Borland’s Java products gaining ground: 50% up in revenue from 2Q00 to 3Q00; 250% up from 3Q99 to 3Q00. Borland has not forgotten its RAD customers, nor have the customers forgotten Borland: Delphi and C++ Builder retain a loyal following and con- tinued attention from Borland. A Linux Journal readers’ poll rated Delphi as the most requested port to Linux out of all possible applications. The Borland Kylix project is the response to this, and Company Profile It’s “Borland” again. Inprise, the company formally known as Borland, is Borland once more. Those who admire its technology and wish the company well might breathe a sigh of relief. But history does not repeat itself. Back in the 1980s, Borland’s do- main — primarily client/server application develop- ment tools — was the high ground of the new IT. The landscape looks different now, as does Borland. The constant feature is Borland’s commitment to providing the highest quality tools for technologists who implement e-business systems. The new Borland’s value proposition and market position might at last have made sense of that. Borland was founded in 1983 with Turbo Pascal, a compiler that sold at $50 a copy. By 1992, it had become perhaps the most important client/server tools vendor, with revenue around $500 million. But the following year the company reported a rev- enue drop of 35%, and had Microsoft close on its heels. Borland’s response was to move up market — acquiringtheOpenEnvironment Corporationin1996 (the source of the Entera DCE middleware product) and then Visigenic (source of the VisiBroker ORB products) in 1998. The two acquisitions helped the company gain a significant presence in the Unix market, something that has been capitalized on with the more recent Java products. Dale Fuller took over as CEO from Del Yocam in April 1999, with the company at a low point: the Inprise brand had not delivered a new market to the company, and seemed to have alienated some part of its established customer base. Fuller based the turnaround on the company’s core products: •Delphi/C++Builder—HighperformanceRADtoolset for client/server and distributed computing. • JBuilder & AppServer — Java development and deployment for enterprise systems. • VisiBroker — Industry-leading CORBA services implementation. • InterBase — Embedded relational database. Other products are now growing up around these, but theessential principal remainsthesame: Borland must concentrate on a limited expression of its core competence — technology for technologists — lo- cating the value-add in quality and strong platform independence. According to the company, Borland is highly focused on assembling and packaging its products into comprehensive platforms for imple- menting e-business applications, providing devel- opment, deployment and management software technologies in a single offering. Its acquisition of BedouinInc.lastNovembersetsthestageforBorland to deliver a comprehensive framework of hosted de- velopment services which will leverage the software implementation platforms and its sizable user base. Third-quarter 2000 results, reported October 24, showed revenues at $47.6 million, up marginally from $45.7 million in the previous year’s Q3. In- come was $8.5 million, up from a loss of $1.4 million in the previous year’s quarter. The company’s cash and short-term investments now total around $250 million. The results were consistent with those for Q2, which showed revenues at $46.7 million, up from $40.2 million in Q2 fiscal 1999. Borland’s customers include technology companies such as Compaq, NEC, and National Semiconduc- tor, and government agencies including the UK trea- sury, US Navy, and NASA. Borland has partner- ships with Arthur Andersen, Ernst & Young, KPMG and MCI Systemhouse. Borland employs approxi- mately 900 staff, with all technology development being carried out in the US. Around 50% of rev- enues are domestic. Borland Corporation 100 Enterprise Way Scotts Valley, CA 95066 Tel.: (831) 431-1000 E-mail: info@borland.com WWW: http://www.borland.com/\n\n2. January 2001 - Page 7408 © 2001 ComputerWire PLC CLIENT-SERVER TOOLS BULLETIN Section 7: Digest of Client/Server Tools Produced by ComputerWire and Distributed by will shortly deliver the Delphi for Linux product now also branded Kylix. Borland retains its focus as the applications tools and technology vendor of choice for technolo- gists — recent customer gains such as UUNet in the UK illustrate this. Borland is consolidating its position, but some question remains about whether the position is viable. Many of the other high-profile technology vendors now talk about a shift from nuts and bolts to solutions. Borland is also busy assembling its product components into platforms for implementing e-business sys- tems. So what’s the value proposition? PRODUCTS RAD PRODUCTS Delphi and C++ Builder continue to develop qui- etly. Judging by the industry hype, it would be easy to imagine that client/server RAD has now been overtaken by Java distributed application development or is now confined to Microsoft Visual Studio. But more than half a million down- loads of Borland’s most recent C++ compiler sug- gests otherwise. Delphi 5 Delphi has long been something of a reference standard for 3GL developer productivity and per- formance of executable code. The Delphi IDE was the model for the JBuilder IDE (though the latter now has a completely different architecture and independent code base). The runtime services now available to Delphi application builder also resemble the Java Enterprise platform. Delphi 5 retains the three editions: Enterprise, Professional, and Standard. The higher two ver- sions ship with the Borland WebBroker, giving Delphi developers similar deployment options available to Java developers. Delphi 5 adds multiprocess debugging, with step- ping possible across process boundaries, together with support for PVCS and other versioning systems. A big stack of new compo- nents — more than 200 in total — are available, these include an HTML client, together with Microsoft Office automation elements. Delphi remains Windows-centric, but is open to the outside world: thus, it includes Borland’s ADOExpress for access to Microsoft Active Data Objects. At the same time, Borland’s MIDAS ser- vices gives Delphi access to CORBA, COM, and HTTP clients. MIDAS 3 The Multi-tier Distributed Application Services suite (MIDAS) provides both Delphi and C++ Builder developers with a collection of middleware services. MIDAS covers both COM/Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), and open technologies over TCP/IP. It supports CORBA, Java, and MTS distributed component clients, HTTP thin clients, and disconnected/roaming clients, in the context of database applications. MIDAS makes use of the Delphi Remote Data Broker. This provides a general purpose solution for supplying data from an application server to a range of client types. The Remote Data Broker can act as a transaction hub; an alternative Stateless Data Broker can act as an MTS client. Other ser- vices include server object pooling, and the abil- ity to propagate database constraints to a client. A Java client component for MIDAS allows any type of pure Java client to interoperate with MIDAS applications. MIDAS continues to gain new functionality — its functionality now resembles that of the Java Enterprise platform specification. MIDAS is a pro- prietary solution (and is limited in deployment to Windows platforms), but its open connectivity options enable it to operate within any mixed en- vironment. InterBase 6.0 The big news is that InterBase has gone open source. InterBase is now available in binary form for Linux, in addition to Solaris and Windows. As of July 2000, Borland has made the source code available. The code can be downloaded from the Borland Web site, and is controlled by the Mozilla Public License — developers can modify the source code, but are required to make the source modifications available. The InterBase product was first released in 1985. Since then, it has gained plenty of new functional- ity, but it has retained the original design goal,\n\n3. January 2001 - Page 7409© 2001 ComputerWire PLC CLIENT-SERVER TOOLS BULLETIN Section 7: Digest of Client/Server Tools Produced by ComputerWire and Distributed by attempting to provide enterprise features while minimizing maintenance requirements. InterBase now provides SQL-92 entry-level compliance, together with distributed transaction support: multiple InterBase databases can take part in the same operations, and are controlled by a two- phased commit. The InterBase license developments are comple- mentary to the Kylix Project, which aims to supply application development tools in an open source environment. However, InterBase will not be the only database supported by Kylix products. Kylix The Kylix project began in 1999, coincident with the first Linux World conference. Kylix is in the process of creating native application develop- ment tools for Linux: the first of these is the Kylix product itself, which represents the implementa- tion of Delphi on Linux; C++ Builder will follow later. Kylix is intended to be used to create both open source Gnu Public License (GPL) applica- tions, as well as proprietary applications. For the former category to be addressed properly, some of the Kylix tools themselves will be open source. C++ Builder and Delphi would not be the first application development tools to be ported to Linux: the original Gnu C compiler (GCC)/Emacs editor combination have already been joined by MetroWerks Code Warrior and Cygnus Code Fusion. Borland’s position is that all of those tools are best suited to system-level development work, while Delphi is about end-user applications that run both client and server-side. Linux system services are substantially different to those for Windows, and this will prevent all but the simplest Delphi applications being ported to Linux without modification. However, the required changes are not expected to be substan- tial. A key aspect of the move to Linux centers around the Borland Visual Component Library (VCL). This is being presented as CLX, a cross- platform library of user interface, database, network, and Internet components. The GUI com- ponents can target both Gnome and KDE Linux user interfaces. CLX has been closely modeled on VCL, but is not fully compatible with it. Kylix was announced on January 31 and will ship in 1Q01. Java PRODUCTS The evolution of Borland’s Java products reflects that of the language itself. What began life as a (much hyped) programming oddity, is now install- ing itself as a key enterprise integration platform. JBuilder’s future has now been mapped out: it in- cludes UML modeling, together with support for Rational products — that probably means that JBuilder will be supported within the Rational UnifiedProcess(RUP)forsoftwarelife-cycleman- agement. JBuilder Enterprise edition now comes with sup- port for the BEA WebLogic server, in addition to the Borland AppServer. Integration between TIBCO middleware and the Borland AppServer is now also possible. The next integration target is IBM WebSphere; delivery of this is planned for 1Q01. JBuilder 4 JBuilder began life as a heavily modified Version of Delphi. Since then, JBuilder has acquired a wholly new design and code base, thus JBuilder 3 and 4 are both coded completely in Java. The final result is excellent — here is a development envi- ronment with all the productivity strengths of Delphi, but with its own optimized implementa- tion. It is interesting to observe that the Oracle JDeveloper toolset is also based on JBuilder, but on a much earlier cut of the product. Thus, JDeveloper — although it contains some exclu- sive Oracle extensions — lacks both the polish and the portability of JBuilder 4. The latest version of JBuilder retains the 100% Pure Java output and — although a significant amount of development work can be done visu- ally or by coding wizards — JBuilder does not introduce any proprietary markers into the source code. IDE changes over previous versions are minor, and will not be significant to many devel- opers. But debugging and deployment changes are very significant: the toolset can now detect thread deadlock, and race conditions; it also sup- ports Servlet and Java Server Pages (JSP) debug- ging, with breakpoints inside JSP pages. The Enterprise edition of JBuilder 4 includes an Entity Bean Modeler; this removes much of the complexity in developing Entity JavaBeans (EJBs)\n\n4. January 2001 - Page 7410 © 2001 ComputerWire PLC CLIENT-SERVER TOOLS BULLETIN Section 7: Digest of Client/Server Tools Produced by ComputerWire and Distributed by — it includes visual descriptions of relationships between EJBs and database table entity. This edi- tion also ships with the Borland AppServer. Professional and Enterprise editions are also shipped with the Borland JDataStore embedded Java database. Forthefirsttime,JBuilderhasacquiredsomeWire- less Application Protocol (WAP) and Wireless Mark-Up Language (WML) support: WML can be generated by the JSPs managed by JBuilder; the Borland AppServer also carries WAP sup- port. The JBuilder Handheld Express add-on extends deployment options to the Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME). The most important J2ME plat- form is the Palm operating system. JDataStore 4 JDataStore was designed to fulfill the common requirements of an embedded database: small footprint, high performance, portability, zero ad- ministration, high security, and the ability to syn- chronize with any JDBC source. JDataStore can also act as a JDBC SQL database in its own right, either in-process with an application, or as a net- worked server. In addition, it can act as a self- contained portable file system, carrying any files, including serialized Java objects. Although JDataStore can act as a flexible RDBMS in its own right (particularly for relatively small data sets), Borland presents it as complementary to the mainstream primary data stores: Oracle, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server. To this end, JDataStore carries its own resolvers that can syn- chronize modified data with remote JDBC data- bases. JDataStore helps to answer the question about the possible performance of Java database en- gines: particularly for Java applications. Java databases have a number of significant advan- tages over systems written in C: databases can run in process, sharing the same heap, and remov- ingallnetworkinganddatamarshallingoverheads. The database can also share the same runtime libraries, minimizing the footprint. JDataStore is also able to exploit thread handling optimizations in the Java HotSpot server virtual machines. SERVER PRODUCTS The most important two areas of activity for the development of Borland server products are stan- dards implementation, improved integration, and 64-bit support. The former is already obvious, with much improved integration between JBuilder 4 and Borland AppServer 4.5. JBuilder, VisiBroker for Java, and the AppServer can already target the Intel Itanium 64 on Windows 2000 now; Red Hat LinuxsupportforItanium64willbedeliveredsoon. VisiBroker 4 CORBA has already become the standard arrange- ment for cross-language integration for enterprise systems; Borland VisiBroker is now the de facto standard CORBA implementation — VisiBroker has been adopted by HP, Ericsson, Netscape, and Oracle. “We’re the i in Oracle8i” points out Borland’s Enterprise Products General Manager. The purpose of a CORBA Object Request Broker (ORB) is to make the interaction between distrib- uted application components, both language-in- dependent and location independent. ORBs such as VisiBroker add enterprise features such as clus- tering, load balancing, and failover. The VisiBroker product group also includes a CORBA interoperable Naming Service, providing a hierar- chical namespace for registered objects. ThecoreofVisiBrokerdatesbacktotheearly1990s with VisiGenic, and the product continues to de- velop within Borland: the VisiBroker Gatekeeper now provides packaged connectivity facilities for clients outside of a firewall. It enables requests and call-backs to take place over HTTP, including SSL connections. Visigenic originally proposed a Distributed Application Platform. This was essen- tially a set of design patterns for business ser- vices over VisiBroker; the Distributed Application Platform has since been superseded by the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) specification and imple- mented by Borland AppServer. AppServer 4.5 The Borland AppServer is presented as an ex- tremelyhigh-performanceJ2EEimplementation,in addition to its maximal compliance with published Java standards. Performance is primarily as a re- sult of the underlying VisiBroker CORBA Object Transaction Service (OTS) module — the CORBA layer is not normally visible to the applications\n\n5. January 2001 - Page 7411© 2001 ComputerWire PLC CLIENT-SERVER TOOLS BULLETIN Section 7: Digest of Client/Server Tools Produced by ComputerWire and Distributed by developer, but it is responsible for much of the work behind the scenes. A number of subtle but important features set AppServer 4.5 apart from competing J2EE imple- mentations • Session Beans — Maintaining session state using a scalable method is now a well-recog- nized problem for J2EE developers. Borland uses a highly efficient “passivization” tech- nique for session beans, and claims orders of magnitude performance benefits. AppServer 4.5 also provides failover for session state. • Container Managed Persistence (CMP) — CMP is an elegant but potentially inefficient methodofimplementingEJBs.Borland’s CMP support includes both JDBC standard map- ping, and optimized mapping to Oracle, Informix,Sybase,DB2,SQLServer,InterBase, or JDataStore databases. The CMP engine can cache EJB data, and uses a number of optimi- zations to minimize traffic to the back-end da- tabase. • Object-Relational Mapping — Single EJB classes can be mapped on to any number of tables, views, or even multiple databases. An- other clear differentiator here is that bean-man- aged persistence and container-managed per- sistence can both be used within one EJB. AppServer 4.5 is itself written entirely in Java 2, and has no native code on any platform. This should finally put an end to the Java performance debate. The AppServer 4.5 also includes a highly optimized single-phased commit JTS/JTA service. The server has its own GUI console — presented both as part of JBuilder 4 Enterprise edition, and accessible independently. AppServer applica- tions can best be managed with the separate AppCenter application management product. AppCenter 4 AppCenter 4 is an application management toolset, specifically designed to work at the com- ponent level. In this respect, AppCenter is comple- mentary to resource or systems management systems such as Tivoli — AppCenter itself can act as a Tivoli managed resource. AppCenter can manage J2EE and DCOM compo- nents, CORBA objects, and their containers. The application models that are developed and used within AppCenter supports the migration and redeployment of components, together with other component aspects such as containment, group- ing, dependency and failover — all these relation- ships are displayed visually, in real time. AppCenter provides its own visual “cockpit” or design studio, in which the application manager can compose descriptions, performance metrics, exceptions, and events related to application struc- tures and functionality. Future versions of AppCenter will be able to man- age Jini networked devices. AppCenter will also embrace the Java Management eXtension (JMX) and WEB/CIM standards, when these are finalized. With AppCenter, Borland makes a strong case in favor of component-level management for com- ponent-based applications: put simply, structural or platform-based management tools cannot see the application structure, and functional-based management cannot determine where a fault or bottleneck occurs, at least not to a sufficiently fine level of granularity. SECURITY SERVICE 4.1 The Borland Security Services is integrated with VisiBroker and AppServer — InterBase and JDataStore security is handled differently, and in any case, Borland anticipates that databases will effectively be hidden behind an application server. The Security Service handles the following issues: • EJB Container — The security aspects of an EJB are described and implemented using the standard CORBASec security model. • Web Services — An HTTPS service is built into the Borland AppServer; this is integrated into the Security Service. • Perimeter defense — The Security Service is integrated with the VisiBroker Gatekeeper. This effectively allows the creation of virtual private networks. • Transport — The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is used as the transport layer for all Security Service communications.\n\n6. January 2001 - Page 7412 © 2001 ComputerWire PLC CLIENT-SERVER TOOLS BULLETIN Section 7: Digest of Client/Server Tools Produced by ComputerWire and Distributed by • Authentication — This is based on public key authentication and X.509 certificates. Authen- tication can use the Unix Network Information System (NIS) or Windows domains. Borland does not act as a certificate authority, but can work with any of the established public authorities. The Security Service is in part a soft- ware product, and in part a service offering — as part of a small but useful collection of developer services.

OPINION Strengths • Quality — Borland products have a habit of doing exactly what they say on the package, with few if any nasty surprises. Software qual- ity for development tools is not a factor that analysts’ reports normally cover, but an excep- tion has to be made here. • Timeliness—BothinJavaandCORBAdomains, Borland has normally been very quick in imple- menting new standards as they are ratified. This comes in part because the architecture of the products allows for this (in contrast with IBM Visual Age), and in part because Borland takes an active role in specifying the standards. • Responsiveness — Borland has historically been good at listening to developers. It’s Community Web site has greatly enhanced this process. • Performance — Right from the beginnings of Delphi, applications written with Borland tools have run fast. Currently, the advice for anyone intending to demonstrate an EJB application has to be: demonstrate it on Borland AppServer. WEAKNESSES • Deployment options — Even on Version 4, JBuilder still has limited automated EJB deploy- ment options. BEA WebLogic is now fully sup- ported, IBMSphere is necessary, and will be delivered soon. CA Jasmineii and SilverStream would also be useful. But is there a conflict of interest between JBuilder and AppServer?"
