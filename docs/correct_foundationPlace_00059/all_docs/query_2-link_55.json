        "text": "Carlos Vasquez, an Engineering Honors Student at Texas A&M University, explores the fascinating intersection of ethics and technology, specifically within the realm of artificial intelligence.\n\nHis research centers on understanding the effects of LLM-enabled classrooms on education and the ethical development of AI systems.\n\nNoah Taylor, a junior Biomedical Engineering major, took 20 credit hours for the 2023 Spring semester.\n\nHe is a member of the Corps of Cadets, a member of Rudder’s Rangers (an advanced training program) and a member of the Parsons Mounted Cavalry. He is the Platoon Sergeant of Company K-1 and the coordinator of Academics, Career Readiness and Recruiting.\n\nWhile taking 20 credit hours, Noah also took the MCAT a year early.\n\nNoah has a cumulative 4.0 GPA and scored 97% on the MCAT.\n\nHe was admitted to EnMed using the E2 EnMed EAP pathway.\n\nAnish Easwaran, a junior Biomedical Engineering major, is a member of Engineering, Inc., the NSF I-CorpsSite program, Engineering Honors Executive Committee, Vice-President and Co-Founder of Aggies to Medicine, and TAMECT and a member of the Aggie Entrepreneurial Committee (his entrepreneurial efforts include StimuCalm, Aegis Armor, PillSafe and an app for pre-med students).\n\nHe is a Brown Foundation Freshmen Leadership Officer and was one of the three group leaders of the inaugural MSC Brown Smith UK Honors Leadership trip.\n\nAnish and his teammates placed in the top 3 for the Rice Health Policy Hackathon, 3rd and 4th at Aggies Invent and Top 6 at Aggie Pitch.\n\nHe was a Gathright Dean’s Excellence Award winner for the College of Engineering and has a cumulative 3.9 GPA.\n\nAnish was admitted to EnMed using the E2EnMed EAP pathway.\n\nSarah Voon, a junior Biomedical Engineering major, received her Aggie ring and completed her undergraduate thesis as a sophomore.\n\nShe is a Brown Foundation Freshmen Leadership Organization officer and was one of the three group leaders of the inaugural MSC Brown-Smith UK Honors Leadership trip.\n\nSarah was inducted into Alpha Eta Mu Beta, the National Biomedical Engineering Honor Society. She is a member of TAMECT.\n\nSarah has a cumulative 4.0 GPA and she took the MCAT a year early and scored 98%.\n\nShe was admitted to EnMed using the E2EnMed EAP pathway.\n\nDawson Benner, a junior Interdisciplinary Engineering major, spent the summer at IIT Gandhinagar, India researching the use of red carbon dots (produced from mango leaves) to: reduce cancer cells counts by 50% without damaging benign cells; close wounds between cells and increase cell counts; and differentiate neurons and cause connections between them, an avenue for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.\n\nDawson was first co-author of “Red Emitting Carbon Dots: Surface Modifications and Bioapplications” published in Nanoscale Advances.\n\nDawson has a cumulative 4.0 GPA and began fast-track coursework for the Master’s in Quantitative Finance at Mays Business School as a sophomore.\n\nMy name is Cathryn Gunawan, and I am a proud member of the Aggie Class of 2026, a biomedical engineering major, and I was admitted to the E2EnMed program. This summer I am researching in Dr. Villapol’s lab in the Department of Neurosurgery. Our lab studies the treatment of traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer’s disease through regeneration and the interaction between the gut and the brain. My research involves improving the characterization of shape changes in microglia—immune cells in the brain that cause inflammation—via 3D analysis to supplement our understanding of the neuroinflammatory response. I specifically looked at these immune cells after traumatic brain injury and treatment with probiotics to determine if probiotics are a viable treatment for traumatic brain injury. In addition to learning technical lab skills, I have also developed communication and presentation skills along with adaptability and independent thinking. I am so grateful to Mrs. Sue Smith and Mr. Craig Brown for providing and sponsoring this opportunity as well as the entire Villapol Lab for their support and encouragement. This experience has deepened my appreciation for research and broadened my understanding of the efforts that go into advancing medicine."
