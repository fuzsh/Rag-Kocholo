Frost, Charles C. Henderson (1928)\n\nHistory of the Development of Building Construction in Chicago, Frank Randall, 1949\n\nBORLAND MANUFACTURING buildings, at 610-732 S. Federal street, were built on piles with one basement—that at No. 610 and that at No. 626, eight stories, in 1910; at No. 638, nine stories, in 1910; and at No. 712 and at No. 732, 12 stories, in 1913. Charles S. Frost was the architect. In 1928 an addition of three stories and one basement, on spread foundations, was made to No. 732 by Charles C. Henderson, architect.\n\nChicago Tribune, June 22, 1913\n\nTHE BORLAND MANUFACTURING BUILDINGS\n\nThe group of Borland buildings, covering 594 feet of frontage, located at 610-736 Federal street, within one block of the loop and one block of State street, is an example of high-class buildings offered for manufacturing purposes. The three lower buildings are of concrete and have been occupied for three years, whereas the two twelve-story buildings have just been completed, are built of steel and tile, equipped with automatic sprinklers, have four plunger elevators in each, and, due to the method of construction, have good light on all four sides. The buildings are handled by C. B. Borland, with oftices in the Borland building, and were designed by Charles S. Frost.\n\nPolk’s Chicago Numerical Street and Avenue Directory, 1928\n\nBorland Building\n\nSanborn Fire Insurance Map\n\n1927"
