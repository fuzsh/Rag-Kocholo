        "text": "Borland Free Clinic was the dream of a few people who believed there were ways to help community members with physical, emotional and spiritual needs. They decided to look for an alternative approach to caring for the medical needs of the uninsured, underinsured and those falling in the insurance gap.\n\nThe dream of bringing hope and healing to vulnerable community members resulted in the birth of Borland Free Clinic in 2012. As the foundation began to be built, committed volunteers sought to bring their ideas to fruition and the clinic officially opened in May 2017 with the offering of free Diabetes Prevention Classes. A year later the clinic became a Primary Care Clinic providing free medical care to vulnerable people in our community.\n\nWe are located in the lower level of Rolling Hills Community Church’s main building in Tualatin, Oregon, right off I-205 at the Stafford Exit. RHCC is graciously providing this space for the clinic to use at a highly reduced rental rent so that it can bless the community with a top-notch clinic that is easily accessible for those in need in the South Metro area. The space is almost 3,300 square feet and is perfectly suited to being home to the Borland Free Clinic."
