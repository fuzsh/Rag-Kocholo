Certuche, Aegis' software development life-cycle architect.\n\n\"Customers, partners and employees now expect higher-quality services, 24/7. To meet their increasing expectations, we needed to provide new and enhanced offerings faster than the competition, which is why we made the strategic decision to adopt SOA,\" said Certuche. \"Prior to deploying Borland Together, we had no way to build a library of visual patterns for SOA without the proper tools. Now we have a way to build our visual patterns, and that has significantly improved our internal IT communications.\"\n\nThe growing number of patterns created using Borland Together serve as templates for developers to customize and apply, so they don't have to begin from scratch, thus saving Aegis' deployment team members time, as they can immediately understand what they have without needing to navigate through code, noted David Hauck, Borland Software's director of product marketing.\n\n\"At Aegis Mortgage, the focus is on building an architectural foundation that promotes rapid growth. Borland Together helps further that goal by providing a way to overcome technical complexity as a result of creating conceptual models and patterns,\" said Hauck."
