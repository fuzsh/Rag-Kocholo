THE BORLAND MANUFACTURING BUILDINGS

The group of Borland buildings, covering 594 feet of frontage, located at 610-736 Federal street, within one block of the loop and one block of State street, is an example of high-class buildings offered for manufacturing purposes. The three lower buildings are of concrete and have been occupied for three years, whereas the two twelve-story buildings have just been completed, are built of steel and tile, equipped with automatic sprinklers, have four plunger elevators in each, and, due to the method of construction, have good light on all four sides. The buildings are handled by C. B. Borland, with oftices in the Borland building, and were designed by Charles S. Frost.
