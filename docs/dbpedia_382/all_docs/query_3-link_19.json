        "text": "A large majority of Taiwanese Americans (95%) hold a favorable view of Taiwan, including 75% who say their opinion is very favorable.\n\nThough nearly all Taiwanese adults in the U.S. have a positive attitude toward Taiwan, only three-in-ten say they would consider moving there, our survey analysis finds.\n\nAbout nine-in-ten have a positive view of Japan, and roughly three-quarters see the U.S. positively. South Korea is also seen favorably by about two-thirds of Taiwanese Americans.\n\nTaiwanese Americans generally hold neither favorable nor unfavorable views of Vietnam, the Philippines and India.\n\nTaiwanese Americans see China the most unfavorably out of the places they were asked about. Just 2% of Taiwanese U.S. adults have a positive opinion of China. Conversely, 84% have an unfavorable view of China, including 62% who have a very unfavorable view.\n\nTaiwanese Americans’ views of many of the places included in the survey differ significantly from those of other Asian Americans. They are much more likely than other Asian adults to hold a favorable view of Taiwan (95% vs. 56%) and Japan (87% vs. 68%). Compared with other Asian Americans, they also hold less positive views of China (2% vs. 20%)."
