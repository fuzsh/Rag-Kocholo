        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nFirst inhabited by Austronesian people, Taiwan became home to Han immigrants beginning in the late Ming Dynasty (17th century). In 1895, military defeat forced China's Qing Dynasty to cede Taiwan to Japan, which then governed Taiwan for 50 years. Taiwan came under Chinese Nationalist (Kuomintang, KMT) control after World War II. With the communist victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949, the Nationalist-controlled Republic of China government and 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and continued to claim to be the legitimate government for mainland China and Taiwan based on a 1947 Constitution drawn up for all of China. Until 1987, however, the Nationalist government ruled Taiwan under a civil war martial law declaration dating to 1948. Beginning in the 1970s, Nationalist authorities gradually began to incorporate the native population into the governing structure beyond the local level. The democratization process expanded rapidly in the 1980s, leading to the then illegal founding of Taiwanâ€™s first opposition party (the Democratic Progressive Party or DPP) in 1986 and the lifting of martial law the following year. Taiwan held legislative elections in 1992, the first in over forty years, and its first direct presidential election in 1996. In the 2000 presidential elections, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power with the KMT loss to the DPP and afterwards experienced two additional democratic transfers of power in 2008 and 2016. Throughout this period, the island prospered, became one of East Asia's economic \"Tigers,\" and after 2000 became a major investor in mainland China as cross-Strait ties matured. The dominant political issues continue to be economic reform and growth as well as management of sensitive relations between Taiwan and China.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nEastern Asia, islands bordering the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, South China Sea, and Taiwan Strait, north of the Philippines, off the southeastern coast of China\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n23 30 N, 121 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 35,980 sq km\n\nland: 32,260 sq km\n\nwater: 3,720 sq km\n\nnote: includes the Pescadores, Matsu, and Quemoy islands\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 139\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland and Delaware combined\n\nLand boundaries\n\n0 km\n\nCoastline\n\n1,566.3 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm\n\nClimate\n\ntropical;

the \"National Banner Song\" has gained popularity in Taiwan and is commonly used during flag raisings\n\nEconomy\n\nEconomy\n\nEconomy\n\nEconomy - overview\n\nTaiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy that is driven largely by industrial manufacturing, and especially exports of electronics, machinery, and petrochemicals. This heavy dependence on exports exposes the economy to fluctuations in global demand. Taiwan's diplomatic isolation, low birth rate, rapidly aging population, and increasing competition from China and other Asia Pacific markets are other major long-term challenges.Following the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) signed with China in June 2010, Taiwan in July 2013 signed a free trade deal with New Zealand - Taipeiâ€™s first-ever with a country with which it does not maintain diplomatic relations - and, in November of that year, inked a trade pact with Singapore. However, follow-on components of the ECFA, including a signed agreement on trade in services and negotiations on trade in goods and dispute resolution, have stalled. In early 2014, the government bowed to public demand and proposed a new law governing the oversight of cross-Strait agreements, before any additional deals with China are implemented; the legislature has yet to vote on such legislation, leaving the future of ECFA uncertain. President TSAI since taking office in May 2016 has promoted greater economic integration with South and Southeast Asia through the New Southbound Policy initiative and has also expressed interest in Taiwan joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as bilateral trade deals with partners such as the US. These overtures have likely played a role in increasing Taiwanâ€™s total exports, which rose 11% during the first half of 2017, buoyed by strong demand for semiconductors.Taiwan's total fertility rate of just over one child per woman is among the lowest in the world, raising the prospect of future labor shortages, falling domestic demand, and declining tax revenues. Taiwan's population is aging quickly, with the number of people over 65 expected to account for nearly 20% of the island's total population by 2025.The island runs a trade surplus with many economies, including China and the US, and its foreign reserves are the world's fifth largest, behind those of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland. In 2006, China overtook the US to become Taiwan's second-largest source of imports after Japan. China is also the island's number one destination for foreign direct investment. Taiwan since 2009 has gradually loosened rules governing Chinese investment and has also secured greater market access for its investors on the mainland. In August 2012, the Taiwan Central Bank signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cross-Strait currency settlement with its Chinese counterpart. The MOU allows for the direct settlement of Chinese renminbi (RMB) and the New Taiwan dollar across the Strait, which has helped Taiwan develop into a local RMB hub.Closer economic links with the mainland bring opportunities for Taiwanâ€™s economy but also pose challenges as political differences remain unresolved and Chinaâ€™s economic growth is slowing. President TSAIâ€™s administration has made little progress on the domestic economic issues that loomed large when she was elected, including concerns about stagnant wages, high housing prices, youth unemployment, job security, and financial security in retirement. TSAI has made more progress on boosting trade with South and Southeast Asia, which may help insulate Taiwanâ€™s economy from a fall in mainland demand should Chinaâ€™s growth slow in 2018.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$1.189 trillion (2017 est.)\n\n$1.156 trillion (2016 est.)\n\n$1.14 trillion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 22\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$572.6 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n2.9% (2017 est.)\n\n1.4% (2016 est.)\n\n0.8% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 119\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$50,500 (2017 est.)\n\n$49,100 (2016 est.)\n\n$48,500 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 28\n\nGross national saving\n\n34.9% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n35.5% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n36.3% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 17\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 53% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 14.1% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 20.5% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: -0.2% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 65.2% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -52.6% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 1.8% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 36% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 62.1% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\nrice, vegetables, fruit, tea, flowers;
