        "text": "Introduction: With over 360 blood group antigens in systems recognized, there are antigens, such as RhD, which demonstrate a quantitative reduction in antigen expression due to nucleotide variants in the non-coding region of the gene that result in aberrant splicing or a regulatory mechanism. This study aimed to evaluate bioinformatically predicted GATA1-binding regulatory motifs in the RHD gene for samples presenting with weak or apparently negative RhD antigen expression but showing normal RHD exons. Methods: Publicly available open chromatin region data were overlayed with GATA1 motif candidates in RHD. Genomic DNA from weak D, Del or D- samples with normal RHD exons (n = 13) was used to confirm RHD zygosity by quantitative PCR. Then, RHD promoter, intron 1, and intron 2 regions were amplified for Sanger sequencing to detect potential disruptions in the GATA1 motif candidates. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed to assess GATA1-binding. Luciferase assays were used to assess transcriptional activity. Results: Bioinformatic analysis identified five of six GATA1 motif candidates in the promoter, intron 1 and intron 2 for investigation in the samples. Luciferase assays showed an enhancement in transcription for GATA1 motifs in intron 1 and for intron 2 only when the R 2 haplotype variant (rs675072G>A) was present. GATA1 motifs were intact in 12 of 13 samples. For one sample with a Del phenotype, a novel RHD c.1-110A>C variant disrupted the GATA1 motif in the promoter which was supported by a lack of a GATA1 supershift in the EMSA and 73% transcriptional activity in the luciferase assay. Two samples were D+/D- chimeras. Conclusion: The bioinformatic predictions enabled the identification of a novel DEL allele, RHD c.1-110A>C, which disrupted the GATA1 motif in the proximal promoter. Although the majority of the samples investigated here remain unexplained, we provide GATA1 targets which may benefit future RHD regulatory investigations.\n\nBackground The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the pattern of the ABO and rhesus D (RhD) blood group distribution among voluntary blood donors attending five blood donation centers at Nigist Eleni Mohammed General Hospital in Hossana, Ethiopia. Methods A total of 1,120 participants who fulfilled the “who can give blood” criteria of the World Health Organization were selected randomly. Blood samples were collected, transported to the laboratory, and analyzed for ABO and RhD typing. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square correlation analysis. Results The study found that the O blood group was the most prevalent (39.0%), followed by A (32.2%), B (22.5%), and AB (6.4%). When considering both the ABO and Rh blood groups together, 92.9% of blood donors were RhD positive, while only 7.1% were RhD negative. The distribution pattern of the ABO blood groups in Gurage Zone, Hadiya Zone, Kembata Zone, and Silte Zone showed that the O blood group was the most prevalent, followed by A, B, and AB, in that order. Conversely, the ABO blood group distribution pattern in Halaba Zone was A > O > B > AB. Civil servants from different occupational statuses were the most dominant voluntary blood donors, accounting for 53.2%, followed by students from different high schools and universities (41.9%), self-employed individuals (4.1%), and others (0.7%). The ABO blood group system had observed allele frequencies significantly different from the expected frequencies (p = 0.007), while the RhD system did not (p = 0.037). Allele frequencies for A, B, and O in the ABO system were 0.3531, 0.2576, and 0.3893, respectively. Observed frequencies for RhD-positive and RhD-negative alleles were 0.9647 and 0.0531, respectively. Conclusion This study highlights the regional ABO and RhD blood group variations in Ethiopia, noting disparities from expected ABO allele frequencies, and identifies the O blood group predominance among donors with a high RhD-positive prevalence.\n\nRh hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn is a potential risk for D-negative mothers who produce anti-D during pregnancy, which can lead to morbidity and mortality in subsequent pregnancies. To prevent this hemolytic disease, Rho(D) immune globulin (RhIG) is generally administered to D-negative mothers without anti-D at 28 weeks of gestation and shortly after delivery. However, current guidelines suggest that pregnant mothers with molecularly defined weak D types 1, 2, 3, 4.0, and 4.1 do not need RhIG as they are unlikely to produce alloanti-D when exposed to fetuses with D-positive red cells. This issue and the necessity of RHD genotyping have been extensively discussed in Western countries, where these variants are relatively common. Recent evidence indicates that women with Asian-type DEL (c.1227G>A) also do not form alloanti-D when exposed to D-positive red cells. We report that mothers with molecularly defined Asian-type DEL, similar to those with weak D types 1, 2, 3, 4.0, and 4.1, do not require RhIG before and after delivery. Collectively, this review could pave the way for the revision of international guidelines to include the selective use of RhIG based on specific genotypes, particularly in women with the Asian-type DEL.\n\nBACKGROUND Rh-DEL type is not detected on routine serology and requires specialized adsorption elution methods which are laborious. Identifying the DEL phenotype in blood donors is important to prevent alloimmunization in transfusion recipients. The present study aimed to determine the frequency of DEL phenotype in RhD-negative North Indian blood donors and correlate the results with Rh Cc/Ee phenotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this prospective descriptive cross-sectional study, a total of 205 blood donors with historic blood group RhD-negative were enrolled. All samples were subjected to blood grouping using a fully automated immunohematology analyzer and samples that typed as RhD negative by two different anti-D antisera were tested for Weak D. Weak D-negative samples were subjected to adsorption and elution for DEL phenotype. All samples were also tested for extended Rh phenotype for C/c and E/e antigens. RESULTS Of the total 11934 donors during the study, 6.2% ( n = 743) donors were RhD negative. Of the 205 donors enrolled in the study, two donor samples were serologically weak D positive. None of the remaining 203 donors tested positive for the DEL phenotype. The extended Rh phenotype performed for these donors showed that 6.83% ( n = 14) donors were positive for RhC antigen and 1.46% ( n = 3) were positive for Rh E antigen. Both weak D-positive donors were also positive for the Rh C antigen. CONCLUSION The prevalence of DEL phenotype is low in the Indian population and studies with larger sample sizes are required to determine the effectiveness of routine C/E typing as a strategy to identify DEL-positive individuals.\n\nThe DEL phenotype represents an intriguing and challenging aspect of blood group serology. This condition is characterized by an extremely weak expression of the D antigen on red blood cells, to the extent that it often eludes detection through routine serological methods. Identifying the DEL phenotype necessitates more specialized techniques, such as adsorption and elution tests, to reveal the presence of the D antigen. This distinctive phenotype underscores the complexity and subtlety of blood group genetics and highlights the importance of using advanced methods to accurately classify individuals with this condition, as their ability to form anti-D antibodies can have clinical implications during transfusion and pregnancy scenarios. There is a paucity of data for the DEL phenotype in the Indian population, and the molecular basis has not been elucidated yet. Our investigation delves into the genetic underpinnings of two distinct DEL phenotype cases that pose challenges for resolution through conventional serological techniques. We employ next-generation amplicon sequencing to unravel the intricate genetic landscape underlying these cases. In the D-negative donor, the DEL phenotype was first identified serologically, which was subsequently confirmed by molecular analysis. In the second case, it was associated with an anti-D antibody in a D-positive patient. Initial data analysis unveiled a substantial reduction in coverage across the exonic segments of the RHD gene in both samples, suggesting the potential presence of RHD exon deletions. On both occasions, we identified a homozygous intronic RHD polymorphism that is well established to be linked to the RHD*01EL.32/RHD*DEL32 variant.\n\nBackground and Objectives The Rh blood group system is the most polymorphic human blood group system. Previous studies have investigated variants in the RHD and RHCE promoter. The relevance of these variants to the Chinese Han population is further clarified in this study. Materials and Methods In total, 317 donors (223 Rh D‐positive [D+], including 20 Del and 94 Rh D‐negative [D−]) were randomly selected. The promoter regions and exon 1 of RHD and RHCE were amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) whose products were directly sequenced using forward and reverse primers. Results Expected PCR products of the RHD promoter and exon 1 were amplified in 223 D+ individuals, including 20 Del individuals, and were absent in 81 of 94 D− individuals. Expected PCR products of RHCE were observed in all donors. Two single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were observed in the RHD promoter region. Moreover, 11 SNVs were observed in the promoter and exon 1 of RHCE . rs4649082, rs2375313, rs2281179, rs2072933, rs2072932, rs2072931 and rs586178 with strong linkage disequilibria were significantly different between the D+ and D− groups. [A;C] was the most common haplotype in the RHD promoter (NC_000001.11:g.[−1033A>G;−831C>T]). [G;T;T;A;T;A;C;G;A;C;G] was the most predominant haplotype in both total and D− groups. In D+ individuals, [A;C;T;G;C;G;C;G;C;C;C] was the most frequent haplotype in the RHCE promoter (NC_000001.11:g.[−1080A>G;−958C>T;−390T>C;−378G>A;−369C>T;−296G>A;−144C>G;−132G>A;−122C>A;28C>T;48C>G]). Conclusion We speculate that the SNVs/haplotypes found in this article cannot significantly affect gene expression. The present study findings should help elucidate the molecular basis of the polymorphic expression of RHD and RHCE promoter regions.\n\nb> Introduction: DEL is known to be one of the weakest D variants, which can be detected by the adsorption-elution technique or by molecular study. Currently, in Thailand, we do not routinely test for DEL variants serologically or genetically among serologic RhD-negative blood donors. Case Presentation: We reported 2 cases of alloimmunization after transfused with Rh DEL, RHD*DEL1 allele, in the Thai population. The first case was a 73-year-old male with anemia who presented with post-cardiac arrest and septic shock. The patient was group B, RhD-negative, and was transfused with RhD-negative red blood cells (RBCs). Antibody screening and identification found that the patient developed anti-D and anti-Mi<sup>a</sup> during the admission course. The second case was a 38-year-old woman with pseudomyxoma peritonei who developed anti-D after receiving four units of RhD-negative RBCs during cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Both patients did not receive anti-D immunoglobulin and had no previous history of anti-D detection. We retrospectively investigated and found two units of RHD*DEL1 among the RBCs transfused to these patients. Discussion: Previous reports of several cases of anti-D alloimmunization in RhD-negative recipients transfused by RHD*DEL1 , an Asian-type DEL, are limited only to East Asia. We first identified 2 patients with anti-D alloimmunization after receiving the RHD*DEL1 RBCs in the Thai population. This raises concern about Rh DEL screening among D-negative Thai blood donors and whether to remove DEL units from the D-negative inventory to improve patient safety."
