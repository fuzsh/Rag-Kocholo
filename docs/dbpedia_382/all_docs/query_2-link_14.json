        "text": "2020 Census demographic characteristics on 41 detailed Asian groups released today show that the Nepalese population increased over 250% and was the fastest growing Asian alone and Asian alone or in any combination group among those with populations of 50,000 or more in 2010 (Table 1).\n\nThe Nepalese alone population increased 295.5% from 51,907 in 2010 to 205,297 in 2020. The Nepalese alone or in any combination population grew from 59,490 to 219,503, a 269.0% increase over the decade.\n\nIn this article, we present data from the race question on detailed race alone and race alone or in any combination populations.\n\nThe race alone population includes respondents who reported one response, such as Filipino. The race alone or in any combination population includes respondents who reported one response, such as Filipino, and it also includes respondents who reported more than one, such as Filipino and Asian Indian or Filipino and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander. The race alone or in any combination population represents the maximum number of people who identified as that detailed group.\n\nAs our country becomes much more diverse and multiracial, this information is important to frame the discussion of racial and ethnic composition and help us understand our country’s changing demographics.\n\nThe Asian Indian alone population increased 54.7% to 4,397,737 between 2010 and 2020 to become the most populous Asian alone group in the nation.\n\nThe next largest Asian alone groups and their population change from 2010 to 2020:\n\nChinese, except Taiwanese alone, 4,128,718 (up 31.6%).\n\nFilipino alone, 3,076,108 (up 20.4%).\n\nVietnamese alone, 1,951,746 (up 26.0%).\n\nKorean alone, 1,508,575 (up 6.0%).\n\nJapanese alone, 741,544 (down 3.2%).\n\nThe Japanese alone population and the Laotian alone population were the only detailed Asian groups to experience a decrease during the decade but their alone or in any combination populations increased by 20.6% and 9.5%, respectively.\n\nThe Chinese, except Taiwanese alone or in any combination population, which was the largest group in 2010, remained so in 2020, increasing 37.2%, from 3,794,673 to 5,205,461.\n\nThe Asian Indian alone or in any combination population increased 49.8% to 4,768,846 and was the second largest group in 2020.\n\nThe next four largest Asian alone or in any combination groups and their population growth from 2010 to 2020:\n\nFilipino alone or in any combination, 4,436,992 (up 29.9%).\n\nVietnamese alone or in any combination, 2,293,392 (up 32.0%).\n\nKorean alone or in any combination, 1,989,519 (up 16.6%).\n\nJapanese alone or in any combination, 1,586,652 (up 20.6%).\n\nTo learn more about the 2020 population size of all detailed Asian alone and Asian alone or in any combination groups for the nation, states, and counties, including less populous groups such as Laotian, Sikh, Hmong, Bhutanese, and more, explore the Detailed Races and Ethnicities in the United States and Puerto Rico: 2020 Census data visualization.\n\nOf the six largest detailed Asian alone or in any combination groups, the largest share of each group (more than 18%) lived in California in 2020.\n\nNew York had the second largest proportions of the Chinese, except Taiwanese (15.9%) and Korean (8.1%) alone or in any combination populations in 2020.\n\nTexas was the state with the second largest proportions of Asian Indian (10.6%) and Vietnamese (14.2%) alone or in any combination populations in 2020.\n\nHawaii had the second largest proportions of the Filipino (8.6%) and Japanese (19.7%) alone or in any combination populations in 2020.\n\nWashington became an increasingly popular place of residence and is now in the top five home states for all but the Asian Indian alone or in any combination population. That’s a change from 2010 [PDF 2.6 MB] when Washington was in the top five only for the Filipino, Japanese and Vietnamese alone or in any combination populations.\n\nWashington has now surpassed New Jersey to become the state with the fifth largest proportion of the Chinese, except Taiwanese alone or in any combination population and has surpassed Virginia as the state with the fifth largest proportion of the Korean alone or in any combination population.\n\nThe Chinese, except Taiwanese population was the largest detailed Asian alone or in any combination group in six of the 10 counties (Los Angeles, Santa Clara and Alameda in California, Queens and Kings counties in New York, and King County, Washington) with the largest Asian alone or in combination populations in 2020 (Table 2).\n\nThe Filipino population made up the largest share of the Asian alone or in combination population in both Honolulu County, Hawaii (42.9% or 271,235) and San Diego County, California (41.6% or 215,168).\n\nThe Asian Indian population was the largest detailed Asian alone or in any combination group in only one of the 10 counties: Cook County, Illinois (134,169).\n\nSimilarly, the Vietnamese population was the largest detailed group (241,557) in only one of the counties: Orange County, California.\n\nThe Korean population in Los Angeles County accounted for the third largest Asian alone or in any combination group in that county.\n\nThe Japanese population and the Pakistani population were the only groups to appear once among the top three largest Asian alone or in any combination groups.\n\nThe Japanese alone or in any combination population in Honolulu County, Hawaii (244,700) was the second largest Asian alone or in any combination group in that county.\n\nThe Pakistani alone or in any combination population in Kings County, New York accounted for the third largest Asian alone or in any combination group in that county."
