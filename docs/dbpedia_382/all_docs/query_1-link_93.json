        "text": "Background:\n\nA military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan in 1895, but it fell back under Chinese control after World War II. After the Communists' victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government based on the constitution drafted for all of China in 1947.\n\nOver the next five decades, the country democratized. Throughout this period, the island has prospered to become one of the four economic Asian Tigers. The dominant political issue continues to be the relationship between Taiwan (ROC) and China (PRC) and the question of possible reunification.\n\nAccording to U.S. State Department, the United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 U.S.-P.R.C. Joint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. The United States does not support Taiwan's independence, but 'the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act provides the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the United States and Taiwan and enshrines the U.S. commitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability. [U.S. Congress]\n\nIs Taiwan a country?\n\nYes and no. According to the Montevideo Convention, there are four basic requirements for statehood, a defined territory, a permanent population, a functioning government and the capacity to conduct international relations.\n\nTaiwan definitely has a defined area, large enough for being a country. It also has a considerable permanent population and, the island has a functioning government, even a democratic one. Taiwan's problem is the fourth requirement for statehood - the capacity to conduct international relations.\n\nAt Beijing's insistence, Taiwan has been excluded from almost all international organizations. The country competes as \"Chinese Taipei\" at the Olympic Games. The Republic of China (Taiwan) is not a member of the United Nations and its related organizations. Only some countries recognize the government of the Republic of China or maintain some formal diplomatic relations with it. The Taiwanese government states that the ROC has diplomatic relations with 15 countries and substantive ties with others such as Australia, Canada, EU nations, Japan, New Zealand and the United States.\n\n(Sources: CIA - The World Factbook, Encyclopædia Britannica, Foreign Policy Research Institute, Bureau of Consular Affairs ROC)\n\nImage: Uwe Aranas\n\nTaiwan political system\n\nSeal of Taiwan\n\nTaiwan's politics take place within the framework of a unitary, semi-presidential democratic republic.\n\nBecause of the Cold War, most Western countries and the United Nations considered the ROC (Taipei) to be the only legitimate government of China until the 1970s. In 1971 UN members voted to recognize the People's Republic of China instead.\n\nTaiwan has received high marks for holding clean elections and protecting political rights. The public supports democracy in principle and, by and large, approves of the island's system in practice. However, when it comes to performance, the political system does not fare so well. This is partly due to a number of structural factors. The election of the president and the legislature according to the majority principle favors a certain polarization and makes it difficult to work out political compromises.

However, according to media freedom organizations, Beijing is putting pressure on Taiwan's media owners, who often have business interests on the mainland.\n\nAccording to RSF, political interference is rare and less tolerated. However, Taiwan's journalists suffer from a very polarized media environment dominated by sensationalism and the profit motive - a quite capitalistic approach.\n\nCentral News Agency\n\nCNA - Taiwan's national news agency.\n\nChina Post\n\nEnglish-language online news.

In the 17th century, extensive immigration of Han Chinese to western Taiwan began under a Dutch colony and continued under the Kingdom of Tungning. The island was annexed by the Chinese Qing Dynasty in 1683 and ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895. The Republic of China, which had overthrown the Qing Dynasty in 1911, took control of Taiwan after Japan surrendered in 1945 on behalf of the World War II Allies. The resurgence of the Chinese Civil War resulted in the ROC losing mainland China to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) forces and retreating to Taiwan in 1949. Since then, its jurisdiction has been limited to Taiwan and numerous smaller islands.\n\nHistory of Taiwan\n\nSome historical facts and a timeline by the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nWhy China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense\n\nIt's complicated.
