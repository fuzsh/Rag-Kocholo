        "text": "Q: On October 1, while the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women was being held at the UNGA, US Secretary of State Pompeo released a press statement alleging that as part of China's campaign against Uyghurs, \"women are reportedly subjected to forced abortion, forced sterilization\", and that China continues the \"crackdown on the freedoms of expression and association\". Do you have a comment?\n\nA: This is another lie fabricated by Pompeo.\n\nThe Chinese government attaches high importance to protecting women's rights and faithfully implement the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. There has been a notable improvement in women's political status, education level, and health conditions. Women's rights including freedoms of expression and association are safeguarded in accordance with law.\n\nThe so-called \"forced sterilization\" on Uyghurs is completely unfounded. The Chinese government protects the rights and interests of all ethnic minorities in equal measure, with preferential population policies toward minorities groups including Uyghurs. From 2010 to 2018, the Uyghur population in Xinjiang grew from 10.1715 million to 12.7184 million, an increase of 2.5469 million or 25.04%, higher than the region's overall growth of 13.99% and much higher than the 2% of the ethnic Han population. These facts and data fully expose Pompeo's lie.\n\nIn direct contrast, the US has yet to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Women in the US still face systemic, prevalent and institutional discrimination and threat. In the US, women are 21 times more likely to die by firearm homicide than women in other high-income countries; up to 70% of women have experienced physical and or sexual violence from an intimate partner; and nearly a quarter of undergraduate women said they have been the victim of sexual assault or misconduct since entering college. Has Pompeo already forgotten the \"Me Too\" movement initiated by women in the US three years ago? With regard to genocide, due to the US government's massive expulsion, assimilation and killing policies, the population of native Americans nosedived from five million to 250,000. That is the very definition of genocide. On racism, has Pompeo already forgotten about \"Black Lives Matter\"?\n\nFacts are facts. The international community will not be fooled by the lies of Pompeo."
