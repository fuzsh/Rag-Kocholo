        "text": "Ashkenazi Jewish\n\nAshkenazi Jewish people settled in Central and Eastern Europe in the late Middle Ages, but their modern descendants remain genetically more similar to other Jewish populations than to their European neighbors, reflecting shared western Asian origins. In the twentieth century, many Ashkenazi Jewish people immigrated to Israel or to the Americas in search of greater cultural and religious acceptance. Today, over five million ethnic Ashkenazi Jewish people live in the U.S.\n\nAlthough not a country or region, they have their own reference population in Ancestry Composition because Ashkenazi Jews are so genetically distinct.\n\nThe Ashkenazi Jewish population has the following Genetic Groups:\n\nBelarusian Jews\n\nLithuanian Jews\n\nWestern European Jews\n\nSoutheastern Polish Jews\n\nEastern Polish and Western Ukrainian Jews\n\nWest Central Ukrainian Jews\n\nCentral European and Western Ukrainian Jews\n\nBroadly European\n\nMuch of Europe was buried under miles of ice ten thousand years ago. As the glaciers receded over millennia, Neolithic farmers from western Asia joined Paleolithic hunter-gatherers to settle Europe. Some European DNA is difficult to assign confidently to one population and receives a ‘Broadly’ designation.\n\nCentral & South Asian\n\nCentral Asian, Northern Indian & Pakistani | Southern Indian Subgroup |\n\nSouthern South Asian | Broadly Central & South Asian\n\nCentral Asian, Northern Indian & Pakistani\n\nThe people of northern India, Pakistan, and Central Asia have a shared genetic history influenced by the southward migration of peoples from Central Asia around 4,000 years ago.\n\nSouthern Indian Subgroup\n\nThe marriage restrictions imposed by a millennia-old caste system in India have resulted in a unique genetic landscape. There are many genetic clusters within India formed by caste, including groups in both northern and southern India who identify as Brahmin. Of these many groups, we were able to identify a genetic signature that reaches high levels among people with ancestry from southern India who say they are Brahmin. This group, labeled “Southern Indian Subgroup,” was probably identified in our Ancestry Composition analysis because members of these communities migrated to the United States at higher rates than others and are therefore more genetically represented in the 23andMe customer database. In the future, we hope to identify additional genetic communities within India that are more representative of the population as our database grows.\n\nSouthern South Asian\n\nThe genetic similarity within southern South Asia may be due in part to migrations of Dravidian-speaking peoples within the past few thousand years.\n\nBroadly Central & South Asian\n\nCentral & South Asia are represented here by diverse populations from India and Sri Lanka in the south to Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in the north. Some Central & South Asian DNA is difficult to assign confidently to one population and receives a ‘broadly’ designation.\n\nThe Broadly Central & South Asian population has Mauritius as a Country Match.\n\nIndigenous American\n\nIndigenous American\n\nSince time immemorial, humans have called the Americas home, from the wind-battered islands of southern Patagonia to the gently rolling tundra of the North American Arctic. Humans may have lived in North America alongside now-extinct mammoths and giant sloths as early as 23,000 years ago, if not before. But DNA evidence suggests that major migrations into the Americas from northeast Asia began around 16,000 years ago, and it was these later migrations that gave rise to most present-day Indigenous American ancestry. Despite drastic population losses over the past 500 years resulting from colonialism, the genetic legacy of the First Peoples of the Americas persists to this day.\n\nThe Indigenous American population includes the following Genetic Groups:\n\nAlaska\n\nColumbia River Basin\n\nGreat Basin & Lower Colorado Basin\n\nGreat Lakes and Canada\n\nNortheast\n\nPlains\n\nSouth Central\n\nSouthwest\n\nEast Asian\n\nChinese | Northern Asian |\n\nBroadly East Asian\n\nChinese\n\nNorthern Asian\n\nNorthern Asian ancestry reflects a history of rapid, widespread human migrations across the vast Central Asian plains, and along the plateaus and waterways of Siberia.\n\nBroadly East Asian\n\nFrom the expansive plains of central Asia to the islands of eastern Indonesia, the people of East Asia share genetic similarities dating back to the arrival of humans in the region over 40,000 years ago. Broadly East Asian DNA – likely driven in part by the spread of agriculture within the last few thousand years – matches several specific populations and is difficult to assign to just one.\n\nSub-Saharan African\n\nWest African | Northern East African | Congolese & Southern East African |\n\nAfrican Hunter-Gatherer | Broadly Sub-Saharan African\n\nWest African\n\nFor over a millennium before European colonization and the Atlantic slave trade, West Africans were united under a series of powerful empires, resulting in broad similarities in music, clothing, art, and cuisine. A gradient of genetic similarity extending from Senegal to Nigeria reflects a richly complex population history in a region home to over 350 million people who form hundreds of distinct ethnic groups.\n\nNorthern East African\n\nNortheast Africa, which here spans from Sudan in the northwest to Ethiopia and Somalia in the southeast, is home to both Afro-Asiatic and Nilo-Saharan ethnolinguistic groups. The entire region has a rich history of genetic and cultural exchange between indigenous East Africans and immigrants from the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nCongolese & Southern East African\n\nStarting around 3,000 years ago, Bantu speakers carried metallurgy and agriculture from the highlands of Nigeria and Cameroon in two major streams – one southward and one eastward – resulting in ancestry that transcends geopolitical borders. “Bantu” is a term widely used to describe the largest of Africa’s ethnolinguistic families.\n\nAfrican Hunter-Gatherer\n\nAfrican hunter-gatherer populations — including the Pygmy and San peoples of central and southern Africa — represent some of the oldest and most genetically distinct branches in the human family tree. The historically semi-nomadic San peoples of the Kalahari and the closely-related Khoe herders in Namibia, Botswana and South Africa, speak languages characterized by click consonants rarely found in other language families. Pygmy peoples of the central African rainforests, on the other hand, have lost their distinct linguistic heritage, but have preserved many unique cultural traditions.\n\nThis dataset includes people of Biaka Pygmies, Mbuti Pygmies, or San descent. At this time, this dataset cannot be broken down further because the people in those regions mixed throughout history or have shared history, or we might not have had enough data to tell them apart. As we obtain more data, populations will become easier to distinguish, and we will be able to report on more populations in the Ancestry Composition Report.\n\nThe African Hunter-Gatherer population has the following Genetic Groups:\n\nBaka and Biaka\n\nMbuti people\n\nBroadly Sub-Saharan African\n\nThe genetic diversity of Sub-Saharan Africa reflects both the deep history of humans in the region and the recent migrations that have carried people from western Africa to both southern and eastern Africa. As a result of this ancient and complex population history, it is difficult to assign some DNA to a specific population within Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Broadly Sub-Saharan African population has the ‡Khomani San as a Genetic Group.\n\nWestern Asian & North African\n\nArab, Egyptian & Levantine | North African | Northern West Asian |\n\nBroadly Western Asian & North African\n\nArab, Egyptian & Levantine\n\nThe region bordering the Red Sea and the eastern Mediterranean has served as an important crossroads of human migration out of Africa over the last 100,000 years. More recently, the Arab conquests of Egypt and the Levant have reinforced this shared genetic heritage.\n\nNorth African\n\nHumans lived along the southern shores of the Mediterranean as early as 300,000 years ago, but the genetic heritage of most North African people today reflects a mixture of North African, southern European, western Asian, and Sub-Saharan ancestry. Today, indigenous North African ancestry peaks in the Berber people of the Maghreb, while the genetic legacy of the Arab conquest of North Africa and the 16th-century expansion of the Ottoman Empire can be found throughout the region as well.\n\nThis dataset includes people of Algerian, Libyan, Moroccan, Mozabite, Tunisian descent. We experimented with different groupings of populations to find combinations that we could distinguish with high confidence. As we obtain more data, populations will become easier to distinguish, and we will be able to report on more populations in the Ancestry Composition Report.\n\nThe North African population has the following Country Matches:\n\nAlgeria\n\nLibya\n\nMorocco\n\nTunisia\n\nNorthern West Asian\n\nRoughly bounded by Anatolia in the east to Iran in the west, northern West Asia has a shared genetic heritage going back tens of thousands of years. Domestication of grains and livestock emerged 11,000 years ago in this region, sparking the agricultural revolution that spread to parts of Europe, Africa, and other parts of Asia.\n\nBroadly Western Asian & North African\n\nThe peoples of western Asia and North Africa have deep linguistic and genetic connections with one another, dating back to some of the earliest migrations out of Africa. The spread of Islam in the past 1,400 years has also dramatically shaped the region's more recent genetic landscape, making it difficult to confidently assign some DNA to just one population.\n\nMelanesian\n\nMelanesia was first peopled by seafaring voyagers over 45,000 years ago, when the ancestors of indigenous Australian and Papuan peoples reached Near Oceania from Indonesia. These early Melanesians interbred with a now-extinct hominin species – the Denisovans – and their descendants harbor traces of this ancient encounter in their DNA.\n\nThe Country Match included in the Melanesian Reference Population is Fiji.\n\nUnassigned\n\nYou may also see a percentage of your DNA is listed as “Unassigned.” There are two reasons why a piece of DNA might be labeled as Unassigned:\n\nThe piece of DNA matches many different populations from around the world.\n\nThe piece of DNA does not match any of the reference populations very well.\n\nThere is a wide range of human diversity out there, and sometimes our algorithm can't pinpoint a region of your DNA to a specific population. Bear with us as our data and resources continue to expand. We expect the amount of unassigned ancestry our customers see to decrease.\n\nCommon Questions"
