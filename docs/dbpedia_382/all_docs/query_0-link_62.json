        "text": "Summary\n\nBackground\n\nExisting evidence suggests that some individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds are at increased risk of suicide compared to their majority ethnic counterparts, whereas others are at decreased risk. We aimed to estimate the absolute and relative risk of suicide in individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds globally.\n\nMethods\n\nDatabases (Medline, Embase, and PsycInfo) were searched for epidemiological studies between 01/01/2000 and 3/07/2020, which provided data on absolute and relative rates of suicide amongst ethnic minority groups. Studies reporting on clinical or specific populations were excluded. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts. We used random effects meta-analysis to estimate overall, sex, location, migrant status, and ancestral origin, stratified pooled estimates for absolute and rate ratios. PROSPERO registration: CRD42020197940.\n\nFindings\n\nA total of 128 studies were included with 6,026,103 suicide deaths in individuals from an ethnic minority background across 31 countries. Using data from 42 moderate-high quality studies, we estimated a pooled suicide rate of 12·1 per 100,000 (95% CIs 8·4–17·6) in people from ethnic minority backgrounds with a broad range of estimates (1·2–139·7 per 100,000). There was weak statistical evidence from 51 moderate-high quality studies that individuals from ethnic minority groups were more likely to die by suicide (RR 1·3 95% CIs 0·9–1·7) with again a broad range amongst studies (RR 0·2–18·5). In our sub-group analysis we only found evidence of elevated risk for indigenous populations (RR: 2·8 95% CIs 1·9–4·0; pooled rate: 23·2 per 100,000 95% CIs 14·7–36·6). There was very substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 98%) between studies for all pooled estimates.\n\nInterpretation\n\nThe homogeneous grouping of individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds is inappropriate. To support suicide prevention in marginalised groups, further exploration of important contextual differences in risk is required. It is possible that some ethnic minority groups (for example those from indigenous backgrounds) have higher rates of suicide than majority populations.\n\nFunding\n\nNo specific funding was provided to conduct this research. DK is funded by Wellcome Trust (204813/Z/16/Z) and Elizabeth Blackwell Institute Bristol. Matthew Spittal is a recipient of an Australian Research Council Future Fellowship (project number FT180100075) funded by the Australian Government.

We searched Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO for systematic reviews published between January 1, 2011 and July 21, 2021, and the search terms included: (ethnic minority OR migrant OR refugee OR expatriate OR asylum-seeker OR indigenous OR departee OR foreign born OR foreign worker OR foreign student OR international student, OR minority group OR ethnic group OR BME OR BAME OR CALD OR cultural diversity) AND (suicide OR self-harm) AND (systematic review), and found a total of 265 records and seven relevant systematic reviews, however these were restricted to specific groups (n = 3) (e.g. migrants or indigenous groups only) or to a specific area (n = 4) (e.g. Latin America). We found no previous systematic review which aimed to identify and synthesise original research to estimate the absolute rates and rate ratios of suicide in individuals from an ethnic minority background globally.\n\nAdded value of this study\n\nWith evidence from 128 studies and 31 countries, we estimated the absolute rate of suicide in ethnic minority groups to be 12·1 per 100,000 (95% CIs 8·4–17·6), with study estimates ranging between 1·2 and 139.7 per 100,000. There was weak statistical evidence of an increased risk of suicide amongst individuals from an ethnic minority background (RR 1·3 95% CIs 0·9–1·7), with substantial variation between study estimates (RR range 0·2–18.5). When examining suicide rates amongst subgroups, indigenous populations consistently reported high rates of suicide (23·2 per 100,000; 95% CIs 14·7–36·6) as well as higher risk of suicide when compared to the general population (RR 2·8 95% CIs 1·9–4·0).\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\n\nDespite the prevailing homogenous grouping of individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in research and in the public discourse, our study provides evidence of how this practice is inadequate due to high levels of heterogeneity and inherent differences amongst groups. Clinicians and policymakers need to carefully consider this evidence when supporting individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds and creating publicly funded government resources.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver 700,000 people die annually by suicide globally.\n\n1\n\nWorld Health Organisation.

A further post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted including only studies rated as high quality for overall absolute rates and RRs, and sex. Data were synthesised if there were a minimum of five estimates to pool (pre-specified in our protocol). In the absence of this, forest plots of the estimates without a pooled estimate were provided along with narrative synthesis. Where a study only provided an absolute rate of suicide for the minority ethnic group, we calculated (where possible) standardised mortality ratios which we have used as an approximate to RRs using the latest World Health Organisation official data (crude rates) for the corresponding country, when data were within a decade of the mid-point estimates\n\n39\n\nWorld Health Organisation\n\nSuicide Rates.\n\nand used this to represent the majority ethnic suicide rate.

Thus, the approximate RR was 15.1 / 24.1 = 0.63. We estimated the standard error of the approximate RR using standard errors of both these crude rates, which was 0.06 on the log scale. (See Lash et al. equation 18-4 for the formula used to estimate the log standard error.)\n\n41\n\nLash T.L.\n\nVanderWeele T.J.\n\nHaneuse S.\n\nRothman K.J.\n\nModern Epidemiology.\n\nSome studies reported multiple estimates, for example representing rates or RR in several different ethnic groups. In order to have a single estimate in each study for the overall pooled estimates, we first aggregated the estimates for the minority groups using a fixed-effects meta-analysis (which assumed a common rate in the minority groups under observation in each study). This was done for every study that had more than one estimate. These aggregated estimates (and their standard errors) were then entered into the main analyses (see below). Similar aggregations were done for subgroup analyses where we examined migratory status and ancestral origin.\n\nWe conducted a pre-specified subgroup analysis by sex (male/female), continent of residence, and migratory status (Migrant, Non-migrant). Given the diverse ethnic minority groups, we pre-specified a subgroup analysis which aimed to disaggregate ethnic minority groups into slightly more nuanced subgroups. For this analysis, we categorised study estimates into broad categories based on the continent individuals were reported to originate from. For example, if a study reported on suicide rates in individuals from an Italian background, these estimates were categorised as having ancestral origins in Europe. Not all studies, however, were grouped by continent. Estimates related to indigenous people were kept separate, as were estimates which were based on specific reported ethnic groups (e.g., Black, White, or Hispanic). Grouping by continent of origin is problematic due to individuals’ differences across continents, and because someone from Asia, for example, who migrated recently is likely to be distinct from a native who has historical Asian origins (sometimes many generations in the past). However, this is a step closer to a more nuanced understanding than how ethnicity is typically treated in the literature. We had pre-specified two additional analyses by method of suicide and ethnic density, but data were not consistently reported, nor enough variability presented to allow for a meaningful analysis. We present pooled estimates (overall, by subgroup, and sensitivity analysis) for absolute rates and RRs. We assessed the possibility of non-reporting bias through visual inspection (i.e. funnel plot) of all the studies contributing to the overall absolute and relative rate pooled estimates, and formally test for plot asymmetry using an Egger test. We conducted a limited number of additional post-hoc analysis to further investigate sources of heterogeneity and explore the robustness of our findings. The studies included provided data from a wide time period, and some studies included data for a restricted population (e.g. only young people) or specific methods of suicide. To explore whether the time period (split into 5-year bands) the study was published, and the age of the included participants explained any heterogeneity observed, we conducted three additional post-hoc analysis. This was restricted to our primary overall pooled estimates.\n\nBecause we pre-pooled estimates from studies prior to our primary analysis, our second post-hoc sensitivity analysis examined differences in results when the data were instead analysed as a multi-level meta-analysis. The approach respects the nesting estimates within studies (a two-level structure). Failure to account for this structure could result in confidence intervals that are too narrow, especially where the data were pre-pooled using fixed effects methods. As such, we repeated our primary and secondary analyses on rate and rate ratios using a multi-level meta-analysis with a random intercept for study.\n\n42\n\nViechtbauer W.\n\nConducting meta-analyses in R with the metafor package.\n\nAll analyses were undertaken in Stata 16.1 except the multi-level meta-analysis which was undertaken in R 4.1.1.\n\nRole of the funding source\n\nThe funder had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the writing of the report. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nResults\n\nOf 9800 abstracts screened, 919 full texts were assessed for eligibility criteria and 128 met inclusion criteria, with 6,026,103 suicide deaths in individuals from ethnic minority groups living in 23 high-income countries representing 87·5% (112/128) of included studies, and eight LMICs representing 12·5% (16/128) studies (see Table 1, Figure 1, Supplementary File 5). Six non-English articles were included. Most studies had low-quality assessments (69/128, 53·9%), whilst 24 (18·8%) were high-quality, and the remaining 35 (27·3%) moderate quality. Six (5%) of studied reported on a specific method of suicide. Twenty-five (19·5%) studies reported on indigenous populations and 41 (32·0%) on migrants. Roughly half of the studies measured ethnicity by self-report or census linkage (66/128, 51·6%). A list of excluded studies with reasons are provided in Supplementary File 6.\n\nTable 1Characteristics of included studies.\n\nAuthor (Year published) CountryYear (data extracted)No. participants

There was evidence of a high degree of heterogeneity (I2 = 100%) and broad rates range of 1·2–139·7 per 100,000. Whilst there was visual evidence that the included studies in this analysis tended to be larger in size (Supplementary file), there was no statistical evidence of plot asymmetry (p = 0.38).\n\nSubgroups: Twenty of the 42 moderate-high quality studies reported on male, and 18 on female-specific suicide rates. Males had a suicide rate of 22·6 per 100,000 (95% CIs 13·5–37·9), and females had a suicide rate of 6·8 per 100,000 (95% CIs 3·6–12·7). There was a high degree of heterogeneity, with estimates ranging between 2·9 and 138·1 per 100,000 in males (I2 = 99%), and 0·3–41·7 per 100,000 in females (I2 = 98%).\n\nPooled point estimates for North American studies (n = 28) were 8·5 per 100,000 (95% CIs 5·6–12·9) and significant heterogeneity persisted (range 1·2–71·7 per 100,000; I2 = 100%). There were insufficient studies to report on pooled absolute rates of suicide by continent amongst the other continents (Supplementary File 7). Estimates for suicide rates in Oceania (n = 4) were largely consistent with each other (range 22·5–36·7 per 100,000) with one notable exception\n\n94\n\nHerman J.\n\nPeiris-John R.\n\nWainiqolo I.\n\net al.\n\nEpidemiology of fatal and hospitalised injuries among youth in Fiji (TRIP 15).\n\n(139·7 per 100,000 95%CIs 110·2–177·1).

There was still substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 98%). There were insufficient studies to report ancestral origin pooled rates of individuals from Europe, Latino, and White individuals.

A total of 85 studies produced a pooled rate of 12·4 per 100,000 (95% CIs 9·5–16·2) with high degree of heterogeneity I2 = 100% (range 0·1–172·0 per 100,000). Consistent with main results, similar rates were reported amongst studies of any methodological quality for male and female-specific studies (males: 20·6 per 100,000;95% CIs 15·3–27·7, females 6·6 per 100,000; 95% CIs 4·9–8·9). We repeated all subgroup analyses including all studies regardless of methodological quality (Supplementary File 8).\n\nIn Supplementary File 9, we report absolute suicide rates in studies of high-quality only (n = 15). Most were North American (11/15) and based on indigenous populations (8/15). The pooled point estimate was consistent with the findings from the primary analysis with substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 99%; range 1·5–139·7). When examining male and female-specific rates, these were higher than when including moderate quality studies: males 34·0 per 100,000; 95% CIs 15·4–74·8, females 8·2 per 100,000; 95% CIs 3·3–20·1. Substantial heterogeneity remained (I2 > 98%). Substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 98%) also persisted when stratified by when studies were published (5-year periods). The pooled rate of suicide in studies with no age restrictions were consistent with the primary analysis (11.6 per 100,000; 95% CIs 7.5–17.9) and with substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 99%) between study estimates. Excluding studies which presented on specific methods of suicide provided a consistent rate estimate (13.8 per 100.00; 95% CIs 9.6–20.0) to that of the main analysis with substantial heterogeneity ((I2 > 99%) between study estimates.\n\nIn Supplementary file 10, we report the results of the primary and the secondary analysis using a multi-level meta-analysis. These results are largely consistent with the results from the primary and secondary analyses. To illustrate, the overall rate in the moderate and high-quality studies was 10.8 per 100,000 (95% CIs 7.8 to 15.0). The I2 was 65% at the study level (42 studies) and 35% at the study level (145 estimates). Similar results were observed for all other rates.\n\nRate ratios\n\nOverall\n\nA total of 51 studies of moderate-high quality rating provided RR of suicide in individuals from an ethnic minority background compared to the majority ethnic population. Overall, there was no statistical evidence that individuals from an ethnic minority background were any more likely to die by suicide (RR 1·3 95% CIs 0·9–1·7) (Figure 3). There was, however, evidence of substantial heterogeneity (I2 = 100%), with a broad ranging RR: 0·2–18·5. Visual inspection of the funnel plots suggests that smaller studies which indicate a reduction in risk were less likely to be reported/published and therefore included in our review (Supplementary file 12). However, there was limited statistical evidence of plot asymmetry (p = 0.08).\n\nSubgroups: A total of 27 studies reported on male-specific RRs, and 24 on female-specific RRs. There was no statistical evidence of an increased risk of suicide in both sexes (Table 3): males: RR 1·2, 95% CIs 0·8–2·0; females: RR 1·4, 95% CIs 0·8–2·4, and substantial heterogeneity persisted (I2 > 99%). Pooled point estimates by continent found that individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds were more likely to die by suicide in Oceania (n = 6) (RR: 3·3 95% CIs 1·9–5·9), compared to limited evidence of elevated risk in North America (n = 35) (RR: 0·9 95% CIs 0·6–1·1) (Table 3). Within these two subgroups substantial heterogeneity persisted (Oceania: I2 = 98%, RR range 1·5–12·6; North America: I2 = 100%, RR range 0·2–6·6).

Across these studies, risk of suicide for males and females were similar (males:1·1; 95% CIs 0·9–1·5, females:1·2; 95% CIs 0·9–1·6), and consistent with our main findings. We repeated all other subgroup analyses including all studies regardless of methodological quality in Supplementary File 8.\n\nIn Supplementary File 9, we report RR in high-quality studies (n = 20). Most were North American (15/20) and over half in indigenous populations (11/20). There was statistical evidence that individuals from an ethnic minority background were at an increased risk of suicide compared to majority ethnic groups: RR 1·6; 95% CIs 1·0–2·6. All the non-indigenous studies either indicated a reduction in risk or no risk, whereas indigenous studies were consistent with an elevated risk of suicide. There was still substantial heterogeneity I2 = 99% (range 0·2–14·4). When examining male and female-specific RR, this increased risk remained, though the estimates were consistent with chance: males RR 1·5; 95% CIs 0·8–2·8 and females RR 1·4; 95% CIs 0·6–3·1 (I2 = 99%). Subgroup analysis by year of study did not account for the heterogeneity observed (subgroup I2 range 96–100%). The pooled RR in studies with no age restrictions were consistent with the primary analysis (RR 1.0 95% CIs 0.7–1.4) and with substantial heterogeneity (I2 > 100%) between study estimates. The same consistent finding was observed when only studies including all methods of suicide were included (RR 1.4 95% CIs 1.0–1.19 I2 > 99%), with some statistical evidence of an increased risk of suicide in ethnic minority groups.\n\nIn Supplementary file 11, we report sensitivity analyses using a multi-level meta-analyses. The results using this approach were similar to that reported for the primary and sub-group analyses. For example, the overall RR for the multi-level meta-analysis for moderate and high-quality studies was 1.2 (95% CIs 0.9 to 1.7) with heterogeneity largely attributable to the between study effects (I2 = 90% for studies and 10% for estimates). A similar finding was observed when all studies were considered (RR = 1.1, 95% CIs 0.9 to 1.4).\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review reporting suicide mortality rates amongst individuals from an ethnic minority background. Despite the prevailing homogenous grouping of individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in research, policy, and the public discourse, our study provides evidence of how this practice is inappropriate due to high levels of heterogeneity, varying estimates, and inherent differences amongst groups. With evidence from 128 studies, and 6,026,103 suicide deaths across 31 countries, we estimated the absolute rate of suicide in ethnic minority groups to be 12·1 per 100,000 (95% CIs 8·4–17·6), with study estimates ranging between 1·2 and 139·7 per 100,000. There was no statistical evidence of an increased risk of suicide in moderate-high quality studies amongst individuals from an ethnic minority background (RR 1·3 95% CIs 0·9–1·7), with substantial variation (RR range 0·2 to 18·5). However, when examining suicide risk amongst high-quality studies (n = 20), there was statistical evidence for an increased risk of suicide amongst individuals from an ethnic minority background (RR:1·6; 95% CIs 1·0–2·6). In all our subgroup analyses substantial heterogeneity persisted (I2 > 98%). This heterogeneity remained unexplained in our subgroup analysis by migratory status (where this was provided) or broad ancestral origin (which crudely maps to the ethnic minority groups reported elsewhere).\n\nWhen examining suicide rates amongst subgroups, indigenous populations consistently reported high rates of suicide (23·2 per 100,000; 95% CIs 14·7–36·6) as well as higher suicide risk (RR 2·8 95% CIs 1·9–4·0). Most studies were based in high income countries (87·5%), pointing to a major gap in our understanding. Given that close to 80% of indigenous people live in LMICs,\n\n13\n\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations\n\nState of the World's Indigenous Peoples.\n\nthey host 80% of the world's refugee population\n\n168\n\nUnited Nations\n\nInternational Migration 2020 Highlights.\n\nand 80% of all suicide deaths occur in LMICs,\n\n1\n\nWorld Health Organisation.

In our review, studies which were high-quality rated were those which used secure records to identify ethnicity (e.g., census, official records (i.e., linked data where ethnicity is based on self-report), or self-report). This was to identify the studies which had accurately captured ethnicity. Less than a fifth of studies (24/128, 18·8%) were rated as high-quality, with half being indigenous studies which are all consistent with an elevated risk of suicide compared to their majority counterparts. Suggesting that the apparent reduction in risk in other ethnic minority groups might be a consequence of systemic barriers rather than a true risk reduction.\n\nPrevious research has indicated that migratory status of individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds changes risk profiles, with recent migrants being less likely to die by suicide compared to their majority counterparts, whereas descendants of these migrants (i.e., non-migrants) are at elevated risk of suicide.\n\n72\n\nDi Thiene D.\n\nAlexanderson K.\n\nTinghög P.\n\nLa Torre G.\n\nMittendorfer-Rutz E\n\nSuicide among first-generation and second-generation immigrants in Sweden: association with labour market marginalisation and morbidity.\n\nMost studies in non-indigenous populations did not specify migration status thereby making it impossible to disentangle mixed effects. Future work should report on migratory status and include how many generations removed descendants are from their migrant ancestor.\n\nOur review was conducted in accordance with established systematic review guidance. Nonetheless, our study had limitations. First, over half of included studies had low-quality assessments (53·9%) which could indicate increased risk of bias. However, our primary analysis was conducted with moderate-high quality studies, reducing the risk. Second, we limited inclusion to manuscripts with English language titles or abstracts – if they did not have these they would not have appeared in our searches. This may have led to underreporting and exclusion of studies from non-English speaking countries. We attempted to overcome this by searching the references all included papers and previous reviews. Third, we limited our review to peer-reviewed articles, excluding grey literature which may mean our review may be subject to publication bias. Fourth, for several papers relative rates were either not presented or were not able to be calculated from presented data. To avoid exclusion of these studies which presented only absolute rates from our RR synthesis, we calculated a standardised mortality ratio using the WHO suicide rate estimates and assumed this would be the equivalent to a RR. Given that ethnic minority groups make up a small proportion of the overall population, and the number of suicide deaths in this group are likely to be small in comparison to the ethnic majority population the standardised mortality ratio is likely to be equivalent to a RR. However, if these assumptions are not met our estimates may be biased towards the null. Fifth, despite us restricting our searches to papers published in the last two decades, there were papers included in our review which reported on data from the 1960s. Given that suicide rates have changed significantly over time, the inclusion of data spanning a wide period may in part contribute to the large amount of heterogeneity observed. However, in our post-hoc analysis which stratified by publication year, substantial heterogeneity persisted between study estimates. Lastly, we restricted our exploration of heterogenicity to sub-group meta-analyses. This approach does not allow us to investigate the sources of heterogeneity in detail and it would have been better to use meta-regression techniques. We did not conduct a meta-regression given that we would have had very few moderate-high quality studies with all the covariate data required.\n\nDespite the prevailing homogenous grouping of individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds in research and the public discourse, our study provides evidence of how this practice should change in relation to suicide prevention because of high levels of heterogeneity and inherent differences amongst groups. Researchers and governments should be aware of the fallacy of aggregating ethnic minority groups and report on individual ethnic minority groups as appropriate. Ideally in categorising individuals, this should be done with relation to likely risk, and therefore should be based on self-identification of ethnicity and be combined with other pertinent risk data, for example migratory status. When data are insufficient to do this, we need to be circumspect in our interpretation of findings. Furthermore, in the absence of self-reported ethnicity data careful consideration needs to be given to possible misclassification of individuals which might masque suicide and self-harm risk. A possible strategy for overcoming this might be with the use of multiple sources of ethnicity data which may reduce likely misclassification. Clinicians and policymakers need to carefully consider this evidence when supporting individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds and creating publicly funded government resources. Some indigenous and ethnic minority groups may be at higher risk of suicide than the wider population. The reasons for this need to be better understood and appropriate policy and clinical responses must be introduced.\n\nContributors\n\nDK, NK, and MIT had the idea for the study, designed the protocol.
