        "text": "5. Ethnic group by age and sex\n\nThis section focuses on ethnic groups with the largest population, the oldest and youngest age profiles and those with the greatest differences in the percentage of males and females. There is also an interactive tool to explore age-sex composition across the 19 ethnic groups.\n\nThe population who identified as “White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British” in England and Wales has aged since 2011\n\nIn 2021, the “White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British” ethnic group remained the largest ethnic group, accounting for 74.4% (44.4 million) of the overall population in England and Wales.\n\nFigure 3 shows that this ethnic group aged between 2011 and 2021, with an increase in both the percentage and absolute numbers of this ethnic group aged 65 years and over (from 18.8% 8,484,733 to 22.5% 9,970,220).\n\nFigure 3: More people within the “White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British” were aged 65 years and over in 2021\n\nPopulation pyramid for the “White: English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British” ethnic group, England and Wales, 2011 and 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nThose who were aged 100 years and over have been grouped together because of statistical disclosure.\n\nTo ensure that individuals cannot be identified in the data, population counts have been rounded to the nearest five and counts under 10 are not included.\n\nPercentages have been calculated out of the overall population of this ethnic group, using rounded data.\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nThis ethnic group accounted for a smaller percentage of both the female and male population of England and Wales in 2021 when compared with in 2011 (74.1% in 2021 down from 80.6% in 2011 and 74.7% down from 80.4%, respectively).\n\nThe ageing of this ethnic group will have contributed towards the decrease in percentage of the overall population who identified within this ethnic group between the two censuses.\n\nMany factors can cause changes in an ethnic group, including changing age structure, people relocating for work or education and differences in the way individuals chose to self-identify (or how a children's ethnic group is reported) between censuses.\n\nMore of the population who identified as “Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh: Chinese” were female compared with the overall population\n\nOf the 19 ethnic groups, people who identified as “Asian, Asian British, Asian Welsh: Chinese” had the highest percentage of females in 2021, 55.2% up from 52.7% in 2011. This compares with 51.0% of the overall population of England and Wales who were female.\n\nFemales were older than males in this ethnic group, with an average (median) age of 35 years compared with 32 years. This is an increase from the median age in 2011 for this ethnic group: 29 years for females and 27 years for males. In comparison, the median ages, within the overall population of England and Wales, was 41 years for females and 39 years for males.\n\nIn part, the increase in average age for this ethnic group can be explained by the decrease in people identifying their ethnic group this way within student age groups (individuals aged 18 to 23 years, see Figure 4); from 22.0% of the population of this ethnic group in 2011 to 14.1% in 2021. This decrease can be partly attributed to the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on the arrival of international students from China. For further information on how the pandemic may have impacted upon Census 2021 results please see our Quality and Methodology Information for Census 2021.\n\nFigure 4: The “Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh: Chinese” ethnic group peaks around 23 years in 2021\n\nPopulation pyramid for the “Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh: Chinese” ethnic group, England and Wales, 2011 and 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nThose who were aged 100 years and over have been grouped together because of statistical disclosure.\n\n\"Asian Welsh\" and \"Black Welsh\" ethnic groups were included on the census questionnaire in Wales only, these categories were new for 2021.\n\nTo ensure that individuals cannot be identified in the data, population counts have been rounded to the nearest five and counts under 10 are not included.\n\nPercentages have been calculated out of the overall population of this ethnic group, using rounded data.\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nAcross the regions of England, the percentage of females ranged from 56.7% (83,655) of this ethnic group in London to 52.9% (28,585) in the North West of England. Geographic variations in the male and female split may be associated with locations of universities.\n\nA higher proportion of the population who identified as “White: Roma” were male compared with the population of England and Wales overall\n\nIn 2021, the ethnic group with the highest percentage of males was “White: Roma” (55.4%, 55,905), higher than the percentage of males across the overall population of England and Wales (49%, 29,177,340).\n\nThe difference in percentage of males and females was largest in the population aged 16 to 64 years where 56.5% (45,465) were male. Notably, people who identified as “White: Roma” had a higher percentage of respondents aged 16 to 64 years when compared with the overall population (79.7% compared with 62.9%).\n\nFigure 5: The “White: Roma” ethnic group had a higher percentage of people aged 20 to 47 years compared with the overall population of England and Wales\n\nPopulation pyramid for the “White: Roma” ethnic group, England and Wales, 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nThose who were aged 100 years and over have been grouped together because of statistical disclosure.\n\nTo ensure that individuals cannot be identified in the data, population counts have been rounded to the nearest five and counts under 10 are not included.\n\nPercentages have been calculated out of the overall population of this ethnic group, using rounded data.\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nAcross all regions of England, the male population was larger than the female population for this ethnic group. The largest difference was in the South West where males constitute 57.0% of the “White: Roma” population, compared with males accounting for 48.9% of the usual resident population of the South West.\n\nThe smallest difference was in Yorkshire and the Humber where males total 52.8% of the “White: Roma” population, compared with 49.1% of the usual resident population of Yorkshire and the Humber.\n\nThe population who identified as “White: Irish” were older than the overall population of England and Wales\n\nNearly a third of the 507,465 usual residents who identified their ethnic group as “White: Irish” were aged 65 years and over (32.1%), substantially older than the overall population of England and Wales of which nearly a fifth (18.6%) were in this age group. A higher percentage of “White: Irish” females were aged 65 years and over (35.4%) compared with males (28.7%).\n\nFigure 6: The “White: Irish” ethnic group had an older age profile compared with the overall population of England and Wales\n\nPopulation pyramid for the “White: Irish” ethnic group, England and Wales, 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nThose who were aged 100 years and over have been grouped together because of statistical disclosure.\n\nTo ensure that individuals cannot be identified in the data, population counts have been rounded to the nearest five and counts under 10 are not included.\n\nPercentages have been calculated out of the overall population of this ethnic group, using rounded data.\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nIn line with the overall population, “White: Irish” males had a higher percentage of their population aged 16 to 64 years (65.9%) than females (59.9%).\n\nIn contrast, males and females aged 0 to 15 years accounted for a lower percentage of the “White: Irish” population (5.4% and 4.8%, respectively) when compared with the same age group for the overall population of England and Wales (19.4% and 17.7%, respectively).\n\nPeople who identified as “White: Irish” in Wales had an older age profile than those who lived in England. In Wales, 34.1% (4,505) of those who identified as “White: Irish” were aged 65 years and over, compared with 32.1% (158,610) in England. In addition, 3.9% (510) of those who identified in this way in Wales were aged 0 to 15 years, compared with 5.1% (25,380) in England.\n\nAge profiles of the population who identified as “White: Irish” also varied across regions of England where the average age ranged from 49 years in the North East to 59 years in the West Midlands.\n\nThe population who identified as “White and Black African” within the “Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups” had the youngest age profile\n\nIn 2021, nearly half (48.6%, 121,310) of the population who identified as \"White and Black African\" were aged 0 to 15 years. Comparatively, 18.5% of the overall population of England and Wales were aged 0 to 15 years.\n\nFigure 7: The “Mixed or Multiple: White and Black African” has a young age profile when compared with the usual resident population of England and Wales\n\nPopulation pyramid for “Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups: White and Black African”, England and Wales, 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nThose who were aged 100 years and over have been grouped together because of statistical disclosure.\n\nTo ensure that individuals cannot be identified in the data, population counts have been rounded to the nearest five and counts under 10 are not included.\n\nPercentages have been calculated out of the overall population of this ethnic group, using rounded data.\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nThe majority of the remaining population for this ethnic group were aged 16 to 64 years (48.9%, 122,105). This is substantially lower than 62.9% of the overall population that were aged 16 to 64 years.\n\nOnly 2.5% (6,180) of the population who identified as being \"White and Black African” were aged 65 years or over. This compares with 18.6% of the overall population in England and Wales who were aged 65 years and over.\n\nThe average (median) age for those who identified as “White and Black African” was 16 years in both England and Wales. The median age for people who identified with the “White and Black African” ethnic group had a higher degree of variation across the regions of England and ranged from 14 years in Yorkshire and the Humber, West Midlands, North East and the East of England to 20 years in London.\n\nThe population who identified as “White and Asian”, within the “Mixed and Multiple ethnic groups” had a very similar young age profile. Similarly, nearly half of those who identified as “White and Asian” (48.1%) were aged 0 to 15 years.\n\nDiverse age and sex profiles across the 19 ethnic groups\n\nAge profiles across the 19 tick-box ethnic groups can be further explored in our interactive population pyramid in Figure 8, comparing the overall population of England and Wales.\n\nFigure 8: Age and sex profiles for ethnic groups and the overall population of England and Wales\n\nPopulation pyramid for the 19 ethnic groups and the usual residents population, England and Wales, 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nThose who were aged 100 years and over have been grouped together because of statistical disclosure.\n\n\"Asian Welsh\" and \"Black Welsh\" ethnic groups were included on the census questionnaire in Wales only, these categories were new for 2021.\n\nTo ensure that individuals cannot be identified in the data, population counts have been rounded to the nearest five and counts under 10 are not included.\n\nPercentages have been calculated out of the overall population of this ethnic group, using rounded data.\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nFigure 9 is an interactive tool that can be used to explore the age and sex profiles of the 19 ethnic groups in 2021 compared with 2011.\n\nFigure 9: Age and sex profiles for ethnic groups in 2021 compared with 2011\n\nPopulation pyramid for the 19 ethnic groups, England and Wales, 2011 and 2021\n\nNotes:\n\nThere was no “Roma” ethnic group tick-box in 2011.
