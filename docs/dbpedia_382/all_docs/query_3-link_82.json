        "text": "Ethnic Identity and National Identity --\n\nMainlanders and Taiwan-China Relations\n\nCheng-Feng Shih\n\nAssociate Professor, Tamkang University\n\n2002/4/11\n\nIntroductions\n\nNowadays, it is generally agreed that there are four major ethnic groups in Taiwan: Indigenous Peoples (­ì¦í¥Á±Ú, 2%), Mainlanders (¥~¬Ù¤H, 13%), Hakkas («È®a¤H, 15%), and Holos (Åb¨Ð¤H, 70%). Ethnic competitions would be found mainly along three configurations: Indigenous Peoples vs. Hans (Mainlanders¡ÏHakkas¡ÏHolos), Hakkas vs. Holos, and Mainlanders vs. Natives (Indigenous Peoples¡ÏHakkas¡ÏHolos). Owing to differences in race, language, and national identity, ethnic cleavages in Taiwan have so far manifested themselves in the form of clan feuds, electoral competitions, or even armed struggle, not only between the Han setters and the Indigenous Peoples but also among the Hans themselves. In the present day, the most serious ethnic disputes are prevalently found in the extended power struggle between the Natives and the Mainlanders.\n\nAt first glance, it appears that there is ample space for coalition making and reconciliation among the four ethnic groups since their cleavages are not reinforcing. However, while Taiwan is endeavor to consolidate its newborn democracy, ethnic maneuverings seem to be increasingly threatening its national security, especially those between the Natives and the Mainlanders, as they have thus far expressed different degrees of sentimental attachment to Taiwan and to China, and thus have yet to arrive at some consensus on their national identity in the face of both vocal and military menaces from China (People's Republic of China, PRC, ¤¤µØ¤H¥Á¦@©M°ê) across the Straits of Taiwan.\n\nAs descendants of those followers of the late Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek (½±¤¶¥Û), who took refuge in Taiwan after their defeat by the Chinese Communists (CCP, ¤¤°ê¦@²£ÄÒ) in 1949, these Kuomintang (KMT, literally Chinese Nationalist Party, ¤¤°ê°ê¥ÁÄÒ) expatriates and political refugees tend to conceive themselves Chinese diasporas rather than Taiwanese in any sense. Caught in the middle of the protracted disputes between Taiwan and China over the sovereignty of this island state, these loyalists, determined to retain their Chinese identity, seem ready to embrace any political formula of integration with China, which in turn reinforce their distinct ethnic identity. On the other hand, the Natives are to a large degree descendents of earlier voluntary settlers, and have in the main considered themselves native Taiwanese and recognized Taiwan as their motherland.\n\nIn this study, we will look into how ethnic identity and national identity have been formed in the Mainlander case. While primordial perspective would focus on racial/cultural interpretations of identity formation, the instrumental approach would emphasize how structural arrangements have contributed to the creation and development of group identity. Alternatively, we will also take a constructionist view by examining how the imaginations of official nationalism have helped to the construction of ethnic identity within the context of national identity. By so doing, we argue that intra-state ethnic contests have reciprocal relations with inter-state interactions.\n\nPrimordial Conceptions of Ethnic Differences\n\nAccording to proponents of primordialism, identity is naturally born, for which there is an authentic core to be discovered. For them, the essence of identity is made up of some objectively discernable characteristics, such as physical traits, language, religion, or other cultural attributes. This line of conceptualizing identity is also termed essentialism. In the case of Taiwan, conventional and popular understandings of ethnic identity tend to take a primoridial cloth.\n\nIn terms of racial and cultural stocks, most of the Mainlanders, while originating from various provinces in China, would share Han identity, although there are few Manchurians (º¡¬w¤H), Mongolians (»X¥j¤H), Hueis (¦^±Ú, Muslims), Tibetans (¦èÂÃ¤H), Miaos (­]±Ú), Yaos (Ø\\±Ú) and other minority groups. Among the Natives, except the Indigenous Peoples, both Hoklos and the Hakkas are descendents of earlier Han settlers/ immigrants. As they both share a similar sense of cultural and racial superiority over the Indigenous Peoples, neither racial nor cultural characteristics are viable marks for the differentiation between the Mainlanders and the Natives.\n\nCultural differences, in the broader sense, did play an important role in the development of mutual distrust. After fifty years of Japanese colonization, the Natives must have gained certain Japanese cultural characteristics, unintentionally or intentionally, ranging from custom, housing, food, clothing, to language. And they joined the Japanese imperial armed forces proudly. Li Yuan-che (§õ»·­õ), a Taiwanese-American who received the Nobel Prize in 1986, recalled one time that he had never realized he was a Chinese when Taiwan was returned to China. It was therefore not surprising that Mainlanders tended to treat the Natives as Japanese subjects with a suspicious eye.\n\nLinguistic differences appear to have been convenient attributes for ethnic identification, if not prejudice or even discrimination, for all relevant groups in Taiwan. The Mainlanders would employ Mandarin as their mother tongue, the Natives have their own languages: the Hoklos speak Hoklo-wei (Åb¨Ð¸Ü), the Hakkas have their own Hak-hua («È¸Üor«È®a¸Ü), and the Indigenous Peoples are endowed with more than ten different languages, none of which are in the main mutually unintelligible. Since Mandarin has been imposed as the only National Language (°ê»y) and thus enjoying the official status in both education and government, the ethnic line of demarcation between the Mainlanders and the Natives is thus expediently drawn between Mandarin speakers (°ê»y¤H) and non-Mandarin speakers (i.e., Taiwanese speakers, ¥x»y¤H).\n\nDuring the February 28 Incident sparked in 1947, some rebellious Natives, anxiously searching for Mainlanders for retaliation, would provokingly stop any stranger and ask him to speak Hoklo, the most widespread language in the private life on the island. As a Native may also have been a Hakka, a second test would be given if he failed the first one: he would consequently be required to speak Japanese and to sing the national anthem of Japan, as few Mainlanders were able to speak fluent Japanese. Therefore, immediately after the war, one reliable criterion of judging one's Native identity was speaking either Hoklo or Hakka, with Japanese as an auxiliary and yet crucial surrogate.\n\nWhile linguistic differentiations may be conducive to inter-group dissociation, linguistic commonalities may provide for intra-group solidarity. Since the Natives pupils had been forced to learn Japanese in school and were punished for speaking Hoklo or Hakka in public during the Japanese colonial rule, particularly at the heyday of Japanization immediately before the war broke out, Japanese provided the Hoklos and Hakkas, and even the Indigenous Peoples, their first common spoken language. It is thus paradoxical that a language imposed by the former colonists would later be adopted as symbol of solidarity among the native Taiwanese after the arrival of the Mainlanders. Until recently, elder Native elites, who are at times termed as those with \"Japanese spirit,\" would communicate with one another in Japanese as a gesture of protesting the KMT rule, keenly aware that the Mainlanders resented anything Japanese so much. Even some Natives who were born after the war and thus had never been enrolled in Japanese schools would at times venture to speak corrupt Japanese with the same reason.\n\nNonetheless, while language may be conceived as capacity, property, or resource for individuals, it is a form of power for the ethnic group. In this sense, primordial ties are intertwined with structural inequalities. Ostensibly, the so-called National Language Policy promulgated after the war was designed to promote mutual understanding between the Mainlanders and the reunited Taiwanese Compatriots (¥xÆW¦P­M), it was generally understood as one of the KMT's attempts to Sinicize the Natives, which, reflecting political domination, in turn had persistently degraded native culture as vulgar and thus inferior. Since Hoklo and Hakka were degraded as \"dialects\" and thus proscribed in the public sphere, as history had repeated, those Native students who spoke their mother tongues in schools would be punished or fined in tokens.\n\nTo the dismay of the Natives, the hours of programs in native languages per day had been severely rationed since TV became popular in the 1970s. Further, corrupt Mandarin spoken by the Natives had long been ridiculed as Taiwan Guo-yu (¥xÆW°ê»y), with the intention to humiliate the Natives and to deprive their collective self-pride. Earlier on, Taiwanese figures on TV, if ever, would invariably have been portrayed as those who speak clumsy Taiwan Guo-yu. These biased treatments, intentionally or not, had only created resentment, if not hatred, among the Natives. This cultural wall did create mutual alienation, and eventually helped to consolidate separate senses of collective identity on both sides.\n\nWhile it is yet not entirely clear whether or not the former ruling KMT had purposefully used Mandarin to subordinate the Natives, the cultural hegemony may have been a protective shield erected by the numerically minority of the KMT/Mainlander government in the face of the hostile Natives, who, on the other hand, would interpret it as nothing but the disguised continual of the Japanese colonial practice thrust upon by the KMT, which could do nothing but to serve to reinforce their sense of inferiority. Since most of the Natives could only command their mother tongues and Japanese, and thus barely understand Mandarin after been colonized by the Japanese for half a century, Mandarin, before long, had became one of the most humiliating symbols of domination by an alien regime.\n\nIn the past decade, Taiwan has witnessed a renaissance of both Hoklo and Hakka in cultural industries, such as primetime series and news report on TV, and song writing. The approval of Hoklo and Hakka has been singularly noticeable during election campaigns, when Hoklo and Hakka are deemed imperative to attract Native voters in the numerical majority. Even the KMT candidates have been obliged to follow the same populist fashion traditionally adopted by the then opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP, ¥Á¥D¶i¨BÄÒ). Understanding the power of the Native languages, Lee Teng-hui of the born-again KMT, himself a Hakka assimilated by the Hoklos, could not help using Hoklo during his presidential campaign in 1996. In the 1998 mayoral election of Taipei, the KMT candidate Ma Ying-giou (°¨­^¤E), a Mainlander, appealed heavily to the Hoklo constituencies in their language. In the same vein, James Soong (§º·¡·ì), a Mainlander who broke away from the now naturalized KMT, would took pains to campaign in Native languages and thus posed himself as a candidate of rainbow coalition in the 2000 presidential election.\n\nIn recent years, in order to alleviate the political tension resulting from linguistic monopoly of Mandarin, the government has permitted the teaching of Native languages in primary schools; so far, only a toke of a couple of hours per week is sanctioned. Only recently, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU, ¥xÆW¹Îµ²Áp·ù), a newly formed native party, is campaigning heavily to elevate Hoklo as a second official language (©x¤è»y¨¥). In the spirit of multiculturalism, there have been some suggestions to include all languages in Taiwan as national languages or Taiwanese. Still, at issue is which language(s) would be adopted as the common language(s): while some would retain Mandarin, some would welcome Hoklo.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether or not the Mainlanders would consider theses \"naturalization\" (¥»¤g¤Æ) trends as reversal discrimination. In changing political atmosphere, especially the power transfer from the KMT to the Native DPP, young Mainlanders appear much more willing to learn Hoklo in order to fare better in job opportunity, or, in the worst scenario, to disguise themselves as Natives in case ethnic conflicts break out. Nevertheless, it is yet not clear whether the Mainlanders would interpret the self-adjustment as a form of forced assimilation. It is much less certain whether these developments would reinforce their group solidarity and ethnic identity.\n\nStructural Explanations of Ethnic Identity\n\nAccording to structuralism, collective identity starts with unequal distributions of political power, economic resources, and social status among (or between) ethnic groups. Being psychologically deprived, the frustrated elites of the subordinated group are determined to embark on ethnic mobilizations. On the other hand, self-segregated or discriminatory measures may be utilized for the preservation of group interests as well as identity. As the focus of this thread of thoughts is on the role the ethnic elites play in the formation of group identity, it is variously termed \"instrumentalism.\"\n\nAfter Taiwan was retroceded to China in 1945, the Natives initially welcomed the arrival of their Chinese brethren (i.e., Mainlanders) without asking for exercising the right of self-determination. However, in less than two years, the Natives revolted against those who they had greeted not long ago. The ensuing retaliatory massacre aggravated the alienation between the Mainlanders and the Natives, and helped to strengthen the Native consciousness."
