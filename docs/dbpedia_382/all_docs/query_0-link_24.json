        "text": "Ethnic groupsTemplate:SHORTDESC:Ethnic groups\n\nThis article is about the general concept of peoples relating to China. For the dominant Chinese ethnic group, see Han Chinese. For a list of ethnicities in modern China, see List of ethnic groups in China. For a list of ethnicities in historical China, see Ethnic groups in Chinese history. For the concept of the multiethnic Chinese nation, see Zhonghua minzu.\n\nChinese people Gallery Working.. Quotes.. Roles..\n\nThe Chinese people or simply Chinese, are people or ethnic groups identified with China, usually through ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, or other affiliation.[1]\n\nChinese people are known as Zhongguoren (Template:Zh) or as Huaren (Template:Zh) by Chinese language speakers, including those living in Greater China as well as overseas Chinese. Although both terms both refer to Chinese people, their usage depends on the person and context. The former term is commonly used to refer to the citizens of the People's Republic of China - especially mainland China.[2][3][4][5] The term Huaren is used to refer to ethnic Chinese, and is more often used for those who reside overseas or are non-citizens of China.\n\nThe Han Chinese are the largest ethnic group in China, comprising approximately 92% of its Mainland population.[6] They comprise approximately 95% of the population of Taiwan,[7][8] 92% in Hong Kong,[9] and 89% in Macau.[10][11]Template:Better source needed They are also the world's largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 18% of the global human population.[12][13]\n\nOutside China, the terms \"Han Chinese\" and \"Chinese\" are often conflated since those identifying or registered as Han Chinese are the dominant ethnic group in China.[14][15] There are 55 officially-recognized ethnic minorities in China who may also identify as \"Chinese\".\n\nPeople from Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), may also be referred to as \"Chinese\" in various contexts, though they are usually referred to as \"Taiwanese\". The territory of Taiwan is disputed and the ROC has limited recognition of its sovereignty.\n\nThe term \"Overseas Chinese\" is used to refer to people of Chinese origin living overseas as well as Chinese citizens residing outside China, but more commonly the former.\n\nEthnic groups in China and associated territories[]\n\nFurther information: Ethnic minorities in China, List of ethnic groups in China, and Unrecognized ethnic groups in China\n\nA number of ethnic groups within China, as well as people elsewhere with ancestry in the region, may be referred to as Chinese people.[16]\n\nEthnic groups in China[]\n\nHan Chinese people, the largest ethnic group in China, are often referred to as \"Chinese\" or \"ethnic Chinese\" in English.[14][15][17] The Han Chinese also form a majority or notable minority in other countries, and they comprise approximately 18% of the global human population.[12][13]\n\nOther ethnic groups in China include the Zhuang, Hui, Manchus, Uyghurs, and Miao, who make up the five largest ethnic minorities in mainland China, with populations of approximately 10 million or more. In addition, the Yi, Tujia, Tibetans and Mongols each have populations between five and ten million.\n\nChina, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), recognizes 56 native Chinese ethnic groups. There are also several unrecognized ethnic groups in China.\n\nEthnic groups in the Qing dynasty of China (1644–1911)[]\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty the term \"Chinese people\" (Template:Zh\n\nZhōngguó zhī rén\n\n; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) was used by the Qing government to refer to all traditionally native subjects of the empire, including Han, Manchu, and Mongols.[18]\n\nZhonghua minzu (the \"Chinese nation\")[]\n\nZhonghua minzu (Template:Zh), the \"Chinese nation\", is a supra-ethnic concept which includes all 56 ethnic groups living in China that are officially recognized by the government of the People's Republic of China. It includes established ethnic groups who have lived within the borders of China since at least the Qing dynasty (1644–1911).[19] The term zhonghua minzu was used during the Republic of China from 1911 to 1949 to refer to five primary ethnic groups[lower-alpha 1] in China.[20] The term zhongguo renmin (Template:Zh), \"Chinese people\", was the government's preferred term during the life of Mao Zedong; zhonghua minzu is more common in recent decades.[21]\n\nEthnic groups in Taiwan[]\n\n\"What would I do if I were me...?\"\n\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.\n\nPlease help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2021)\n\nTaiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), recognizes 17 native Taiwanese ethnic groups as well as numerous other \"New Immigrant\" ethnic groups (mostly originating from Mainland China and Southeast Asia). Of the 17 native Taiwanese ethnic groups, 16 are considered to be indigenous (Taiwanese indigenous peoples),[22] whereas one is considered to be non-native (Han Taiwanese).[23] There are also several unrecognized indigenous ethnic groups in Taiwan.\n\nThe Han Taiwanese, who are Han Chinese people living in Taiwan, are usually categorized by the Taiwanese government into three main ethnic groups; the Taiwanese Hoklos, Taiwanese Hakkas, and waishengren (i.e. \"Mainland Chinese people in Taiwan\"). The Kinmenese and Matsunese peoples are two other significant Han Taiwanese ethnic groups.\n\nThe Hoklos and Hakkas are both considered to be \"native\" populations of Taiwan since they first began migrating to Taiwan in significant numbers from mainland China (mostly from Fujian and Guangdong) over 400 years ago (they first began migrating to Taiwan in minor numbers several centuries earlier). They are often collectively referred to in Taiwanese Mandarin as \"Benshengren\" (meaning \"people from this province\"). The Hoklos comprise approximately 70% of Taiwan's total population and the Hakkas comprise approximately 14% of Taiwan's total population.\n\nMeanwhile, the so-called Mainlanders (Taiwanese) are mostly descended from people who migrated from mainland China to Taiwan during the 1940s and 1950s, usually in the context of the Second World War, Second Sino-Japanese War, and Chinese Civil War. They are often referred to in Taiwanese Mandarin as \"Waishengren\" (meaning \"people from outside of this province\"). The Mainlanders (Taiwanese) comprise approximately 14% of Taiwan's total population.\n\nCollectively, the various Taiwanese indigenous peoples comprise approximately 2% of Taiwan's total population. The various Taiwanese indigenous peoples are believed to have been living in Taiwan for up to 6000 years prior to the colonization of Taiwan by China which began during the 17th century (CE).\n\nRecognition by the Chinese government[]\n\nThe Han Taiwanese, Native Taiwanese (Benshengren), Hoklo Taiwanese, Hakka Taiwanese, Mainlander Taiwanese (Waishengren), Kinmenese, and Matsunese ethnic groups (all subtypes or branches of the Han Chinese ethnic group) are all unrecognized by the Chinese government. Furthermore, the sixteen Taiwanese indigenous peoples that are officially recognized by the Taiwanese government are also all unrecognized by the Chinese government. The Chinese government also doesn't recognize the ethnic designation \"New Immigrant\".\n\nThe Chinese government instead has its own ethnic designations for Taiwanese people. Han Taiwanese people are considered to be Han Chinese people (no distinction is made), whereas the various recognized and unrecognized (by Taiwan) Taiwanese indigenous peoples are collectively recognized (by China) to be \"Gaoshanren\" (i.e. \"High Mountain People\"). The Gaoshanren are one of the 56 officially-recognized ethnic groups of China.\n\nNationality, citizenship and residence[]\n\nThe Nationality law of the People's Republic of China regulates nationality within the PRC. A person obtains nationality either by birth when at least one parent is of Chinese nationality or by naturalization. All people holding nationality of the People's Republic of China are citizens of the Republic.[24] The Resident Identity Card is the official form of identification for residents of the People's Republic of China.\n\nWithin the People's Republic of China, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport or Macao Special Administrative Region passport may be issued to permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macao, respectively.\n\nThe Nationality law of the Republic of China regulates nationality within the Republic of China (Taiwan). A person obtains nationality either by birth or by naturalization. A person with at least one parent who is a national of the Republic of China, or born in the ROC to stateless parents qualifies for nationality by birth.[25]\n\nThe National Identification Card is an identity document issued to people who have household registration in Taiwan. The Resident Certificate is an identification card issued to residents of the Republic of China who do not hold a National Identification Card.\n\nThe relationship between ROC nationality and PRC nationality is disputed.[26]\n\nOverseas Chinese[]\n\nMain article(s): Overseas Chinese\n\nOverseas Chinese refers to people of Chinese ethnicity or national heritage who live outside the People's Republic of China or Taiwan as the result of the continuing diaspora.[31] People with one or more Chinese ancestors may consider themselves overseas Chinese.[32] Such people vary widely in terms of cultural assimilation. In some areas throughout the world ethnic enclaves known as Chinatowns are home to populations of overseas Chinese.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, people of Chinese descent call themselves\n\n華人\n\n(\n\nHuárén\n\n) instead of (\n\n中國人\n\nZhōngguórén\n\n) which commonly refers to the citizens of the People's Republic of China or the Republic of China.[33] This is especially so in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. The term Zhongguoren has a more political or ideological aspect in its use; while many in China may use Zhongguoren to mean the Chinese ethnicity, some in Taiwan would refuse to be called Zhongguoren.[5]\n\nSee also[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
