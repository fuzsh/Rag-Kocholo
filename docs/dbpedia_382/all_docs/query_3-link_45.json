        "text": "There are 23.5 million Asian Americans living in the US, making up 7.1% of the US population. Among them, 3.8 million identify as Asian in combination with another race.\n\nAsian Americans are sometimes grouped with Pacific Islanders under the “AAPI” umbrella, and the joint Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage month is celebrated annually in May. The AAPI population is the fastest growing racial group in the US, with a population that increased 27% from 2011 to 2021.\n\nThe demographics of Asian Americans vary drastically across ethnic groups. Taiwanese and Indian Americans have the highest educational and income outcomes, while Southeast Asian Americans have lower incomes and educational attainment.\n\nWhich are the largest Asian American ethnic groups in the United States?\n\nSix Asian ethnicities have a US population exceeding 1 million. With 5.3 million people, Chinese Americans are the largest group, representing 22% of the Asian American population. The next largest groups are Indian Americans (20% of all Asian Americans), Filipino Americans (16%), Vietnamese Americans (10%), Korean Americans (8%), and Japanese Americans (7%).\n\nWith an average of 3.4 people, Asian American families are also larger than the average of all US families at 3.2.\n\nThe average Hmong, Burmese, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi American family in the US all have more than four members. Korean and Japanese American families are the smallest among all groups, with an average size of 3.1.\n\nThe agency has never had a checkbox for “Asian” or “Asian American” in its official census forms. In the 2020 census form, there were checkboxes for six Asian ethnicities — Chinese, Filipino, Asian Indian, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese — along with a seventh “Other Asian” category accompanied by a fill-in text area.\n\nThe 2021 American Community Survey provides the latest available demographic data on Asian Americans, with wo datasets for each ethnicity: one that includes multiracial people and another that excludes them. This article includes those who identify as an Asian ethnicity in combination with others. It also lists Taiwanese Americans separately from Chinese Americans.\n\nLearn more about US demographics, Pacific Islander Demographics, the jobs with the most Asian Americans, and get the facts every week by signing up for our newsletter."
