The officially recognized Indigenous population of Taiwan numbers 589,038 people, or 2.51% of the total population.[1]

Sixteen distinct Indigenous Peoples are officially recognized: Amis (also Pangcah), Atayal (also Tayal), Bunun, Kavalan, Paiwan, Puyuma, Rukai, Saisiyat, Sakizaya, Sediq, Thao, Truku, Tsou, Tao (also Yamei), Kanakanavu, and Hla'alua.

Ten lowland Indigenous Peoples’ groups (Pingpu) are not recognized as such by the government and hence not extended the same rights as the 16 recognized groups and thus are also excluded from the Council of Indigenous Peoples’ (CIP) policies and programmes. The 10 unrecognized peoples are: Babuza, Hoanya, Kaxabu, Ketagalan, Makatao, Papora, Pazeh, Siraya, Taokas, and Tavorlong.

The 16 recognized groups enjoy representation at all levels of government, from parliament to central government's CIP and municipal governments, city and county councillors, and local district and township representatives.

Most of Taiwan’s Indigenous Peoples originally lived in the central mountains, on the east coast and in the south. However, nowadays over half of the Indigenous population lives in the urban areas of the country.

The main challenges facing Indigenous Peoples in Taiwan are their rapidly disappearing cultures and languages, encroachment onto their traditional land, the denial of their rights and the exclusion of the 10 lowland (Pingpu) Indigenous Peoples.

The CIP is the State agency responsible for Indigenous Peoples. Taiwan has adopted a number of laws designed to protect Indigenous Peoples’ rights, including the Constitutional Amendments on Indigenous representation in the Legislative Assembly, protection of language and culture and political participation (2000); the Indigenous Peoples’ Basic Act (2005); the Education Act for Indigenous Peoples (2004); the Status Act for Indigenous Peoples (2001); the Regulations regarding Recognition of Indigenous Peoples (2002); the Name Act (2003), which allows Indigenous Peoples to register their original names in Chinese characters and to annotate them in Romanized script; and the Indigenous Languages Development Act (2017).

Unfortunately, serious discrepancies and contradictions in the legislation, coupled with only partial implementation of these laws have stymied progress towards the self-governance of Taiwan’s Indigenous Peoples.

Since Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, it is not party to UN human rights instruments.

200-year commemoration for Central Plains Indigenous Peoples

On the first weekend of December, hundreds of members of plains Indigenous groups (also known as 'Pingpu peoples' 平埔族群) gathered together at a site in Puli town, Nantou County in central Taiwan, to commemorate an important event in history, the 200-year anniversary of Central Plains Indigenous Peoples’ migration to settle in Puli town.[2]

In 1823, the Taokas, Pazeh, Kaxabu, Papora, Arikun, Lloa, and Babuza migrated from their original community lands in the central coastal plains of Taiwan to settle in Puli, in Taiwan's geographic centre, surrounded by high mountains. Members of the seven plains Indigenous groups residing in Puli are aware of this significant milestone and worked with academia and local government to put together activities, cultural fair programmes and entertainment performances.

The celebration included a 16-day special exhibition showcasing, through documents, cultural objects and photographs, the historical accounts of the ancestral land dispossession of the Indigenous Peoples of the coastal plains, and the resulting group migration of over 30 communities to settle in central Taiwan's mountainous regions. The exhibition also highlighted how these Indigenous groups, despite not yet having official Indigenous status, have strived to revitalize their culture, language, rituals, and ethnic identity, including efforts to gain official recognition.[3]

Further, in November-December, a series of lectures was organized by professors and researchers. The lectures focused on telling the story of each of the seven plains groups affected by the land dispossession caused by Han Chinese settlers and which resulted in their migration to central Taiwan.

These seven groups of Taiwan's central region are still not officially recognized by the government and, during the group covenant ceremony, they collectively pledged their commitment to uphold their cultural development and rejuvenate their traditional way of life and ethnic identity, expressing their vision for the future development of contemporary Indigenous communities.

Together, the contributing efforts also resulted in the publication of the “200-Year History of Central Plains Indigenous Peoples, Migration to Puli” (平埔族群入埔200年紀念專書), a special commemoration book authored by Deng Shian-Yang (鄧相揚) and Jian Shih-Lang (簡史郎), two researchers and leading experts on the culture and history of the plains Indigenous Peoples of central Taiwan.[4]

Through the exhibition and commemorative activities, the Indigenous communities aim is to assert the historical significance of Central Plains Indigenous Peoples and seek the respect they rightfully deserve within Taiwanese society.

Paiwan people repatriate ancestors remains

Paiwan Indigenous people from Mudan village of Pingtung County travelled to the University of Edinburgh in the UK to conduct a ceremony for the repatriation of Taiwanese Indigenous ancestral human remains.[5]

In the November visit, the University of Edinburgh held an official ceremony granting the return of four ancestral skulls that were taken from the Mudan community in southern Taiwan by Japanese soldiers during the 1870s. During the ceremony, Paiwan leaders and shamans conducted traditional rituals to guide the ancestors back to their homeland.

This marks the first instance of Taiwan's Indigenous community requesting international repatriation of ancestral human remains and is therefore of historical significance and serves as a pivotal moment in the transitional justice process for Taiwan’s Indigenous Peoples.

In Taiwan, the government-run Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) has stated that Articles 11, 12, and 31 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRP) uphold the right of Indigenous communities to return ancestral remains to their place of origin, and countries should make efforts to enable Indigenous Peoples to obtain such remains held by national governments, and repatriate them to their place of origin.[6]

Damage by Typhoon Khanun

In early August, Typhoon Khanun made landfall and brought heavy rain to mountainous regions in central and southern Taiwan. The medium-strength typhoon triggered landslides in Kaohsiung's mountainous area and caused damage to roads and houses.

This left several Indigenous communities cut off from the rest of the country, with hundreds of people stranded in their mountain villages, and one fatality.[7]

The Taiwan Central Weather Bureau recorded rainfall of 749 and 667 millimetres in the mountains of Nantou County, the highest single-day precipitation in Taiwan since weather records began. This highlights the impact of climate change on weather patterns worldwide, with instances of extreme rainfall affecting mountainous areas in Taiwan and endangering the lives of Indigenous communities.[8]

Many people in the Nantou mountain regions of Taiwan lost their homes and suffered other damage to their property. In response, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen announced that the government would assist the reconstruction efforts in Nantou County and restore road access.[9]

Passing of Thao community female priestess

The Thao Indigenous Community in central Taiwan's Sun Moon Lake area lost their 86-year-old female priestess Malash Katibatu in September. Following her death, there are now only five female priestesses who can conduct and assist in presiding over Thao traditional rituals in the community.[10]

According to the Thao Indigenous Cultural Development Association, the responsibilities of female priestesses, known as “Shinshii”, require extensive knowledge and a lifelong commitment. They play a vital role in various ceremonies, including weddings, funerals, prayers for healing, groundbreaking ceremonies, and house-warming rituals, all of which require communication with the ancestral spirits.

The association also pointed out that in, 2015, the Thao Peoples' “Tungkariri Lus'an” (Ancestral Spirit Ritual) was registered as an important national folk tradition. They therefore stressed that preserving the Thao Indigenous culture and rituals should receive support from the government and society.

In recognition of “Shinshii” Malash Katibatu's lifelong dedication to preserving and promoting Thao Indigenous culture and traditional practice, the Ministry of Culture posthumously awarded her a special commendation, acknowledging her contribution in laying the foundations and preserving the cultural assets of the Thao community.

Amendment to Indigenous Status Act

In December, Taiwan's legislature approved amendments to the “Status Act for Indigenous Peoples” (原住民身分法). The amendments have made the process less stringent for obtaining officially recognized Indigenous status if a person has only one Indigenous parent.[11] The final version of the amendments was the result of a highly participative process following a Constitutional Court ruling in 2022 that deemed the previous version of the Act unconstitutional, as it recognized official Indigenous status only when a person was registered under an Indigenous name, coming either from their Indigenous father or mother.

In a situation where it is still common practice in Taiwan to register under the father's surname, in cases where the father is not Indigenous, or he belongs to one of the “unrecognized” Indigenous groups, the earlier version of the Act prevented individuals from inheriting their mother's Indigenous status.

Following the 2022 Constitutional Court ruling, Indigenous rights activists presented their proposal for changes to the “Status Act For Indigenous Peoples” for consultation and review by the CIP.[12] Activists said other proposed amendments submitted by political parties did not fully address the issues relating to equality and identity rights because, in cases where the mother is Indigenous and her child is born of a mixed marriage, the other proposals retained the requirement for the child to have a traditional Indigenous name to obtain Indigenous status. They contended that this direction was not aligned with the Court's decision regarding “representation of ethnic identity” and the need to respect each Indigenous group's right to self-determination of their personal and collective cultural identity.

The process resulted in CIP releasing a draft of proposed amendments in September, addressing the criteria for individuals to obtain Indigenous status for those born to mixed Indigenous and non-Indigenous parentage, and also for children adopted by Indigenous families.

Meanwhile, Indigenous youth organizations held a national forum in November to discuss the rights associated with issues of Indigenous status and recognition of ethnic group identity.[13] This resulted in a “youth” version of the draft amendments that incorporated the perspectives of the younger generation. This was submitted to the legislature for review and to be taken into consideration when working on the final version of the amendments.

The process throughout 2023 reflected an evolving interaction between contemporary multicultural Taiwan whereby intermarriage among diverse ethnic groups is becoming more common, leading to new issues and changes concerning recognition of Indigenous identity within the framework of national law.

Following the December approval by legislators, CIP officials said that, in practical terms, more people will now gain official Indigenous status, and that the Taiwan government would need to boost the budget for social welfare, education, healthcare, employment subsidies, and other programmes for Indigenous Peoples.[14],[15]
