This course, presented by the Statistics Department, focuses on the conceptual framework of government finance statistics (GFS) as presented in the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), with an emphasis on new concepts introduced in GFSM 2014. The course requires that participants are familiar with the basic GFS framework and classification system. Emphasizing the integrated GFS framework, the course addresses complex cross-cutting GFS issues, such as social protection, government employee pension liabilities, standardized guarantee schemes, contracts, leases, licenses, public-private partnerships, and public sector balance sheets. It also examines coverage of the public sector, giving special attention to borderline and complex cases. The course discusses internal and intersectoral data consistency, coordination between data-producing agencies, as well as data presentation and communication with users. The format is lectures and discussions.

Officials whose main responsibility, for at least three years, has been compiling and disseminating GFS and who are regularly faced with complex GFS methodological and compilation issues, such as those described below.

Participants are expected to have a degree in economics, public financial management or statistics or the equivalent. It is strongly recommended that applicants have completed the online Government Finance Statistics (GFSx) or the Government Finance Statistics fundamental (GFS-F) courses. Selection will be based on the criteria, if an official successfully completed the GFSx or GFS-F.
