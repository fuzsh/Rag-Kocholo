        "text": "Humanity has observed remarkable improvements in life expectancy at birth. These improvements imply a greater longevity risk in the life insurance field, for pension systems and for the individuals involved in retirement planning. Our work aims to give sense of how longevity evolution reverberates into increasing costs for pension provision. We use the Lee-Carter model and the Human Mortality Database (HMD) data of six EU countries. We assess the dynamics of the price of a temporary life annuity, issued in different calendar years. With respect to the past, in all the countries under study, underwriting a life annuity is becoming progressively more expensive, with similarities between countries especially in relation to the cost of longevity risk protection for females.\n\nThe existence of a pure and rational (time consistent) preference over the life cycle is problematic. We propose an ‘existential’ approach to time preference where the subject only cares about his ‘future selves’ insofar as his reasons for living today that involve those selves: his time preference is inversely proportional to the robustness and scope of his current life projects. The empirical measure of such a preference involves building ordinal scores derived from a series of questions, mostly concrete or relating to everyday life. We obtain overall stability of time preference over the medium term, from 2007 to 2020 (until the first Covid lockdown). The variations in this preference for the same individual panel member appear poorly explained by usual covariates, apart from a negative effect of age and of getting married.\n\nLonger lives are an achievement and the course of lifespan is increasingly influenced by unobservable risk factors altering the chronological pace of aging. Then, the present work proposes an analytical approach to characterizing the human lifetime based on the concept of non-chronological age. Starting from a chronological Gompertz mortality framework, we define the non-chronological lifespan and characterize it probabilistically by deriving, in closed-form, the expression for the cumulative distribution function, the density of deaths function, and the mortality hazard function. We find that non-chronological death probabilities are a time-dependent affine transformation of chronological death probabilities for a newborn, and we highlight the link between the non-chronological lifetime and the concept of individual frailty in heterogeneous mortality modelling. We believe that our proposal may contribute to shaping a new perspective on longevity risk measurement and management.\n\nThis paper deals with the estimate of surrender rate with explanatory variables by a Generalized Linear Model for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS) where the response variable is assumed Beta Binomial. In actuarial practice and literature, the Binomial Generalized Linear Model is frequently used to get an estimate of surrender rates per policy count conditional to policy and policyholder features. We suggest a regressive model based on a Beta Binomial assumption of the response variable. Beta Binomial is a discrete random variable that differs from binomial because the probability of success at each of n trials is not fixed, but beta distributed. Beta Binomial random variable is fit to model binomial phenomena where the probability of success is not fixed but is inferred from data. Beta Binomial random variable has greater variance and skewness than a Binomial random variable with the same mean, because in the Beta Binomial approach the uncertainty about what the true probability is, is taken into account. This uncertainty makes values far from mean more plausible. Finally, the Beta Binomial does not belong to the exponential family. For this reason, a GAMLSS model is used to get parameter estimates.\n\nIn actuarial analysis, it is very useful to analyze the behavior of an interval-bounded random variable, as a percentage, a proportion, or a fraction, conditioned to other explanatory variables. For this kind of variables, considering the presence of bounds, in general in (0,1), the estimate of the conditional mean and/or conditional quantiles is more trivial than other continuous or discrete variables. This work aims to show the application of a copula-based regression model on the study of the percentage lapsed in partially lapsed life policies, demonstrating how this approach can be an effective and powerful tool compared to an alternative standard regression models like Beta Regression.\n\nIn this contribution, we consider a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) methodology for predicting specific gift features, particularly the count of donations and the gift amounts. Moreover, we use Garson’s indicator to evaluate the relative importance of the input variables to the output(s) in the MLP model with the aim of enhancing the effectiveness of fundraising campaigns. In the discussed application, the Donors’ behaviors are estimated using a simulated dataset that includes individual characteristics and information about donation history.\n\nWith increasing interest in recent years, investors have devoted attention to the art market as a potential alternative asset class to be included in portfolios. Besides cultural and aesthetic value, investment in art could provide diversification benefits, and a hedge against market volatility and inflation. We use data on the global art auction market to analyze this asset’s risk-return characteristics, and to investigate its inclusion in optimal portfolios, based on the classical Markowitz mean-variance and the mean-CVaR optimization models. The results show that art makes an interesting asset, which enters the optimal portfolios.\n\nDeveloping sustainable business standards for small and me-dium-sized enterprises (SMEs), entailing targets such as the minimization of carbon emissions, the promotion of equality and transparency in business processes, is key to achieve transition towards a greener economy. In light of the challenges in implementing and embedding sustainability practices in small firms, we consider the problem of evaluating the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of listed European SMEs, w.r.t. different sustainability indicators, using a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. Due to lack of agreement over the ‘true’ ESG metrics of firms discussed in the literature, we depart from the practice of constructing a composite indicator based on a sorting of firms, and we assess the stability of the results when the parameters of the preference model are uncertain. Moreover, with the aim of identifying possible sector-specific differences, the sustainability performance is gauged with reference to five economic sectors, based on a unique dataset of SMEs.\n\nThe wind farm performance is often characterized by uncertainty since it depends on unstable condition of wind speed and, consequently, on unstable wind energy conversion. This aspect makes the wind projects valuation quite difficult. The Real Options Approach (ROA) represents an adequate methodology to assess wind energy projects. This work applies the ROA by considering a specific stochastic process that would fit for the wind speed modelling, and other typical characteristics of wind projects, such as their multistage nature. We model the wind turbine performance by including three possible scenarios: cut-in speed, rated output speed and cut-out speed. A numerical example is provided to implement our mathematical valuation approach.\n\nWithin the efficient markets framework, discounted stock prices are typically represented through Brownian martingales. The primary measure for evaluating risk is the volatility of log-returns, under the assumption that higher variability indicates greater associated risk. The theoretical foundation of this claim stems from the characterization of the path regularity of price process through the Lévy characterization theorem of Brownian motion. Since this explanation lacks a financial interpretation when considering more realistic models, such as stochastic volatility models, it is necessary to disentangle volatility and regularity. Replacing volatility by the Hölder regularity provides insights into market deviations from the equilibrium of the martingale model, and - within the Fractional Stochastic Regularity Model - contributes to identify the “fair” volatility aimed by the market.\n\nSince the seminal contribution of Yaari (1965), who showed that individuals with no bequest motive should convert all their retirement wealth into annuities, a number of papers have analysed the annuitization decision under the so-called all or nothing institutional arrangement, where immediate lifetime annuities are purchased just at a one point in time. In this paper, we investigate the effect of linear bequest motives on the annuitization decision for a retired individual who maximizes the market value of future cash flows. Finally, we present numerical examples analyzing optimal annuitization under strong or weak bequest motives.\n\nIn this paper, we develop a longevity swap de-risking strategy to mitigate the impact of the longevity risk related to payments that depend on how long individuals are going to live. In order to ensure the development of an effi-cient capital market for longevity risk transfers, the longevity hedge would allow longevity risk to be shared efficiently and fairly between the parties. Our results show that the fixed proportional risk premium that the counter-party requires to take on the longevity risk varies by changing the mortality model adopted to represent the evolution of the longevity of the population underlying the swap and that, as the risk premium changes, the total transfer of longevity risk may become inefficient.\n\nCyber insurance is a crucial tool for managing risks associated with cyber threats. A challenging task for insurance companies lies in pricing cyber risk. Our study is motivated by the reasonable assumption that firms entering into cyber insurance contracts face diverse cyber threats in terms of types and magnitude. Considering these differences ensures that premiums align with the actual risk exposure of the insured. The study discusses this approach proposing a case study based on the Chronology of Data Breaches provided by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.\n\nThe concept of Sustainability has been identified as a key factor in investment strategies for over a decade. Due to empirical evidence suggesting better risk-return profiles for sustainable investments than non-sustainable ones (under similar conditions), investors consider ESG ratings essential information for investment choices. Despite persistent inconsistencies and methodological uncertainties, new risk measures are perceived as useful in identifying risks associated with the Environmental, Social, and Governance pillars, both individually and collectively. This study aims to assess whether a selected set of financial statement variables and a dynamic measure of systemic risk observed at time t can provide useful information for identifying the ESG rating class of a company at time $$t+1$$ t + 1 . To test this hypothesis, we use companies in the EuroStoxx 600 index for the period 2016–2021 and apply a Machine Learning (ML) model. Using a Random Forest (RF) classification model, we estimate the ESG rating class at time $$t+1$$ t + 1 with unprecedented accuracy. This agile and parsimonious model can provide valuable information to sustainable investors for making strategic investment decisions.\n\nWe consider four technical indicators widely used in financial practice to determine the optimal signal aggregation, trading rule definition, and indicator setting using the Particle Swarm Optimization metaheuristic applied to an important financial fitness function, that is the Sharpe Ratio. We experiment our trading system to the Italian index FTSE MIB and to a set of financial stocks belonging to the FTSE MIB over a multi-year period for training and testing. We generally achieve superior out-of-sample performance, using a standard technical analysis system as a benchmark.\n\nLife annuities are actuarial products based on technical assumptions, such as mortality. The degeneration of the human body leads, in addition to generating long-term care, to a higher mortality of the dependent than that of the general and insured population. Therefore, the period for receiving this benefit would be shorter. The aim of this paper is to determine the economic impact of the change in the beneficiary’s status when receiving this life annuity. It should be stressed that, in the life annuity, the biometric risk is borne by the insurer and that a lower payment expectancy due to the pension beneficiary’s change to dependent status entails a benefit, as this gain is not distributed to the beneficiary. A surplus is created by paying out the same benefit. Thus, the use of an appropriate mortality assumption results in a reduction of the mathematical payout provision, which frees up capital and results in a lower solvency capital requirement.\n\nConducting a financially sustainable business may collide with the constraints imposed by the necessity of the alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals. On the one hand, regulators demand companies to satisfy solvency requirements to operate in the insurance activity. On the other hand, the global transition to a more sustainable economy pushes companies to operate a severe business transformation. We investigate the relationship between the Solvency Ratio and Environmental, Social, and Governance score (ESG) score using an individual fixed effect regression model, including insurance-specific control variables. Our results indicate that an insurance company’s ESG commitment increases its solvency level.\n\nFollowing the principles of a sustainable economy, companies are increasingly adopting business strategies that seek to harmonize profit objectives with their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. The financial sector’s growing awareness of climate and environmental risks underscores the necessity for developing sustainable investments that endorse activities with minimal environmental impact. Sustainability, incorporating environmental, social, and governance considerations, is a strategic priority in this paradigm. This study focuses on the environmental risk aspect, encompassing a company’s overall environmental impact and potential risks arising from environmental issues. The primary objective is to discern the structural features of listed firms that influence their sustainability levels, as measured by their “E” score. Leveraging balance sheet information from a selection of European listed firms, our investigation aims to reveal potential relationships between corporate financial variables and the E score. To unravel complex, non-linear relationships within one of the most environmentally conscious markets, namely the European market, we employ advanced techniques such as the random forest and gradient-boosting machine algorithms. This approach allows us to deeply understand how financial variables interplay with a firm’s environmental sustainability, offering insights into the intricate dynamics shaping sustainable practices in a corporate context.\n\nInvestment decisions in wind projects can be tough considering the uncertain economic performance depending on the stochastic nature of revenues. Thanks to the recent innovation in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this work tries to present an innovative approach based on the Monte Carlo option pricing model and Sentiment Analysis. Treating it as a financial option, the idea is to price the managerial flexibility of changing investment decisions during the project lifetime depending on the wind investment’s profitability. In this way, the Monte Carlo options pricing technique is combined with the sentiment (polarity) score, allowing the modification of transition probabilities from one phase of the investment to another and, consequently, the profitability of the investment.\n\nThe reverse mortgage, in spite of its low uptake, is a tool of protecting the so-called house rich-cash poor persons. It represents an opportunity especially in social realities with a high aging population, pension systems struggling to guarantee acceptable living standards, significant proportion of homeowners with insufficient income to meet daily expenses. The paper is interested in this contract by looking at it from the point of view of the provider/lender who commits to a payment to the borrower/pensioner against the amount that will be made when the house is sold, in which the borrower will continue to live for life. Our focus is on quantifying the risks that impact the contract, due to three main sources of uncertainty. The purpose is to provide formulas for quantifying each of these risks, which are easy to interpret and apply, and useful for proceeding to profitable risk control strategies.\n\nThis study aims to estimate the information efficiency of financial markets based on the Hurst exponent, with a focus on the S&P 500 index. The approach involves using statistical models to estimate the implied Hurst exponent through the historical series of the VIX (a proxy for implied volatility) with a 30-day time lag. In this way, the traditional backward-type Hurst estimation is reconciled with that derived from the VIX, which represents a forward-looking measure (a proxy for 30-day volatility). The test sample also includes the COVID pandemic period. The results reveal a good fit from ensemble stacking models, with the random forest standing out as the most effective approach in estimating the implied Hurst index.\n\nOperational risk (OpRisk) is emerging as a crucial non financial consideration with widespread implications for financial institutions. Shifting away from traditional regulatory tasks, including data collection, capital requirement calculations, and report generation for managerial decisions, OpRisk functions are now adopting proactive strategies to prevent or mitigate risks. The integration of Artificial Intelligence techniques, increasingly essential for managerial insights, is utilized to glean additional information from data. This study propels the utilization of text analysis techniques in the context of OpRisk. A pioneering dimension involves examining pertinent tweet content from social media X for the continuous monitoring of the evolving risk landscape, aiming to identify early warnings about new types of potentially risky events.\n\nThe increases in life expectancy over the last decades have strongly impacted the distribution of ages at death. Its parametric estimation can be complicated by cohort effects. Our addresses the issue by extending a recent three-component parametric model to include cohort effects in a Bayesian framework. The model is fit to male mortality data from five diverse Italian regions between 1974 and 2022. Our results demonstrate significant regional variations in mortality, influenced by cohort effects, particularly among cohorts born around World War I. The model effectively captures the evolution of mortality components, with cohort effects markedly improving fit of complex, even multi-modal curves.\n\nThis article presents a comprehensive study on developing a predictive product pricing model using LightGBM, a machine learning method optimized for regression challenges in situations with limited historical data. It begins by detailing the core principles of LightGBM, including gradient descent, and then delves into the method’s unique features like Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). The model’s efficacy is demonstrated through a comparative analysis with XGBoost, highlighting Light-GBM’s enhanced efficiency and slight improvement in prediction accuracy. This research offers valuable insights into the application of LightGBM in developing fast and accurate product pricing models, crucial for businesses in the rapidly evolving data landscape.\n\nIn this work, we consider a spatio-temporal financial dataset, with $$p=84$$ p = 84 units (a sample of asset returns from the “G7” countries) and $$T=666$$ T = 666 daily observations, from May 2021 to December 2023. Assuming that the p units can be grouped into clusters, we apply a clusterized spatial dynamic panel data model and a multiple testing procedure, to investigate the best partition of clusters for the dataset. We show that, among the three candidate partitions considered in our analysis, the best partition is the one based on the asset’s economic sector.\n\nThis paper introduces the Sparsity-constrained Graphical Lasso (SCGlasso) for the precision matrix, $$\\mathbf {\\Theta }$$ Θ , in a multivariate Gaussian framework. The estimator is designed to produce a shrunk estimate of $$\\mathbf {\\Theta }$$ Θ , while simultaneously imposing a certain degree of sparsity, which is crucial for reconstructing the conditional dependence graph and the partial correlation graph. The proposed method employs an $$\\ell _1$$ ℓ 1 -norm (Glasso) regularization to achieve shrinkage and imposes an $$\\ell _0$$ ℓ 0 -pseudo-norm constraint to ensure sparsity. The proposed approach performs well compared to Glasso on simulated data, also in contexts where the number of variables p exceeds the number of observations n.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic crisis financially impacts the PAYG pension schemes. In the short run, the economic shock induced a decrease in receipts due to the contraction of the GDP. In the medium and long run, the return to the pre-crisis level depends on the ability of the economy to rebound. As to expenses, in the very short term, they do not decrease due to the inertia. However, the fall in contributions is progressively taken into account to calculate the new pensions, which will gradually contract expenditures. The demographic impact is mirrored in a moderate increase in mortality, mainly that of retirees. We develop a macroeconomic model that simulates these changes and is then used to revise the pre-crisis forecasts in pension expenditures and payroll tax receipts. Relying on the US Social Security 75-year forecast, we analyze the impact of the crisis on the financial balance of its pension system. We assess the extent of the additional fiscal adjustments required to restore financial equilibrium through an Automatic Balancing Mechanism (ABM).\n\nReal options have been used to evaluate investment decisions with various structures, but have rarely been put into a game theoretical context. We examine the risk of war over a common resource, whose value is a geometric Brownian Motion, where one country may preemptively appropriate the resource, and the other wage war for it. We derive a closed form expression for the optimal mixed strategy that both countries should follow, and show that the resulting price level that triggers capturing the resource and subsequent war asymptotically follows a power law. The present value of the time until war is triggered also decays slowly asymptotically. In consequence, in spite of both countries’ propensity towards preemption, war may be indefinitely delayed.\n\nCredit card fraud identification is a challenging problem for different reasons: it needs to be suddenly detected; it is based on the use of huge data sets that have to be properly managed; the number of fraudulent transactions is definitely lower than the number of genuine transactions and then, this imbalance requires the use of proper statistical models. Here we discuss how the data reduction, performed through the variable selection, can be combined with the use of Generalized Linear Models with asymmetric link functions which are able to handle imbalanced data. We illustrate how these theoretical results can be used for credit card fraud-detection purposes.\n\nThe paper develops the method of hedging a two-factor diffusion market with a given probability. We construct the maximal perfect hedging set for an option to exchange for another for which a lower bound of option price is achieved. This method is then applied to pricing “pure endowments with a guarantee” equity linked life insurance contracts. The classical approach of pricing such options provides very low gain for investors, the investor may take a given probability of risk in return of a higher gain. Taken into account this argument, the paper develops risk management strategies for this type of insurance and financial mixed instrument.\n\nArea Yield Index (AYI) was considered as the most potential alternative crop insurance policy in Indonesia. To support this policy, delivering accurate paddy productivity prediction is a must. Thus, we purpose a new flexible Be-ta Four Parameter Generalized Mixed Effect Tree and Random Forest predic-tion model that combines the use of tree regression and random forest with a Bayesian beta four parameter GLMM approach. This model takes into con-sideration that paddy productivity has a bounded minimum and maximum distribution or known as a Beta Four Parameter distribution, variation effect of paddy productivity between areas, and captures complex linear and non-linear relationships in the data. This model was incorporated to design a pro-totype AYI crop insurance in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia that can be fur-ther developed in other areas. Farmer survey data integrated with processed satellite data was utilized in the process. Results show that high predictive accuracy was achieved in the proposed model. Therefore, beneficial for accu-rately assessing risk, setting fair premiums, reducing adverse selection, effi-ciently allocating resources, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the paddy crop insurance program.\n\nIn this paper we propose the use of a single hidden layer feed forward artificial neural network as a tool to appropriately capture the nonlinear dynamics of the mortality rates modeled by a Lee-Carter type model. The proposed procedure makes it possible to obtain point forecasts and, by using a bootstrap scheme, the forecast distributions, which allow to take into account the uncertainty of models’ predictions. Empirical evidence on Italian data shows a significant improvement contribution of the proposed methodology.\n\nThis work focuses on the changes among three stock exchange markets after the Brexit referendum. The markets and their indexes are the British FTSE100, the German index DAX40 and the American index S&P500. Using some nested GARCH and OLS models, it is shown that the volatility of the European indices reduced and the FTSE index decorrelated both with DAX and the S&P in a significant way after the referendum.\n\nAttributing the volatility of a portfolio to some exogenous risk factors which are not directly invested in by the portfolio may be a topic of interest to asset managers. Without any restriction on the nature of risk factors, we must take into account that their returns may exhibit strong correlations. Risk factor returns multi-collinearity causes severe problems in estimating their portfolio volatility contributions. In order to solve this issue, we propose a risk attributing pipeline that applies an orthogonalisation algorithm to risk factor returns. Most importantly, the risk factors interpretability is preserved, in the sense that the orthogonalised risk factors are the ones attaining the least Frobenius norm of the matrix of deviations from the original risk factors.\n\nThe zero utility premium principle is generalized under the Cumulative Prospect Theory. Risk attitude and loss aversion are shaped via a utility or a value function, and probabilities of ranked results are replaced by decision weights. Transformation of objective probabilities models probabilistic risk perception. Some properties of the behavioral premium principle are presented.We then discuss an application making specific assumptions about the value function, the probability distortion, and the distribution of the claim. In particular, we study the impact of loss aversion on the premium.\n\nIn the liability-driven life business (i.e., with fixed or participating benefits), the understanding of the reserving process may be out the reach of the policyholder, due to the actuarial principles on which the valuation is based. In particular, the coherence between the costs described under policy conditions and the amount accumulated into the policy reserve may be lost. When the life policy is mainly viewed as an investment by the policyholder, alternative investments may be considered (perhaps erroneously) more convenient and convincing, as their dynamics appears more intuitive. We show that, based on the information available to the policyholder, the reserve dynamics can be reinterpreted in terms of equivalent periodic fees charged to the value of the policyholder’s investment. Most policyholders should understand the meaning of a periodic fee, thus gaining greater awareness of the protection provided by life policies, as well as better insights on their costs.\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach for forecasting stock prices. Specifically, the approach consists of an ensemble of various deep learning models, namely “multi-model”. Each deep learning model produces its own forecast, then all the forecasts are combined into a unique one, according to different strategies and depending on different error metrics. The final forecasts provided by the multi-model have resulted in more reliable predictions than those provided by the individual deep learning models.\n\nThe old-age dependency ratios are indicators of the number of el-derly people who are generally economically inactive compared to the number of people of working age. They significantly affect the financial burden of social public pension schemes, making it essential to analyze the influence of mortality on this ratio. In this paper, the Gompertz model is used to investigate the effect of mortality and fertility on the old-age dependency ratio, with a focus on the impact of changes in life expectancy. Elasticity formulas are derived to analyze this effect, and the results indicate that an increase in life expectancy leads to a considerable rise in the old-age dependency ratio.\n\nThis paper illustrates the main challenges identified in the literature on cyber risk assessment in order to provide possible solutions for the reduction of the gap between supply and demand of cyber insurance. The aim is to contribute to a better understanding in quantifying, managing and pricing cyber risk by means of: a deeper awareness of the economic consequences they produce; the introduction and validation of new actuarial techniques to allow insurers a more efficient management of this class of risks; the design of innovative insurance contracts and alternative ways of risk transfers to reduce the costs of insurance premiums and mitigate the economic impacts.\n\nThe article focuses on Value-at-risk measuring for options in situations characterized by the lack of liquidity when the underlying stock price has motionless periods. A similar behavior can be observed in physical systems exhibiting sub-diffusion. In the considered sub-diffusive model, the bond movement and stock process are time-changed by the stochastic clock with gamma subordinator. In the model, the two techniques for option pricing were considered. The first very common approach for the time-changed model is to find option prices as the discounted expected payoff under the risk-neutral measure. The second technique for option pricing is based on a fractional version of what is called Dupire’s equation. The Value-at-Risk evaluating procedure for the proposed model was discussed and we show that this procedure is based on the Fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE).\n\nThis paper proposes a new fundamental analysis-based strategy to build a remunerative stock portfolio. We believe that the value investing paradigm, applied with consistency and automatically without any external interference, can constitute a competitive advantage for investors. The procedure works by managing the information coming from financial statements into six filtering criteria aimed at evaluating profitability, financial condition and price convenience. As case studies, we consider three separate portfolio selections from the S&P 500 (2000–2017), the STOXX Europe 600 (2002–2017) and the S&P 100 (2001–2017) benchmarked against a passive strategy represented by the Index. The criteria proposed, invariant and irrespective of economics conditions and financial markets forecasts are able to select, ex-ante, stocks producing significantly better results than the benchmark for all the timelines considered.\n\nPension reforms are on the agenda of several governments worldwide, especially those experiencing a serious longevity risk, like Italy, due to the combination of ageing of the population and declining fertility rates. As a result, younger generations will have to cope with late pension age and possibly lower pension incomes, and individuals may opt to subscribe private pensions to sustain their expectations, in terms of retirement age and pension benefits. Propensity to private pension planning depends heavily on financial literacy, as highlighted in the literature (see [3–5], among others). In this context, for the Italian population we propose to resort to model-based regression trees [8] to highlight individuals’ features that entail different effects of pension expectations and financial literacy on propensity to pension planning."
