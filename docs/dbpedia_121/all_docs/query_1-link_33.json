        "text": "Top 10 Types of Graphs\n\nAny good financial analyst knows the importance of effectively communicating results, which largely comes down to knowing the different types of charts and graphs and when and how to use them.\n\nIn this guide, we outline the top 10 types of graphs[1] in Excel and what situation each kind is best for. Learn how to deliver powerful presentations and clear takeaways with these effective chart types. Learn more in CFI’s Excel Dashboards Course!\n\nDownload the Free Template\n\nEnter your name and email in the form below and download the free template now!\n\n#1 Line Graphs\n\nThe most common, simplest, and classic type of chart graph is the line graph. This is the perfect solution for showing multiple series of closely related series of data. Since line graphs are very lightweight (they only consist of lines, as opposed to more complex chart types, as shown below), they are great for a minimalistic look.\n\nTips:\n\nRemove all gridlines\n\nRemove any shading or borders\n\nHighlight each single series with a different color\n\n#2 Bar Graphs\n\nBars (or columns) are the best types of graphs for presenting a single data series. Bar charts have a much heavier weight than line graphs do, so they really emphasize a point and stand out on the page.\n\nSource: Dashboards and Data Presentation course\n\nTips\n\nRemove all gridlines\n\nReduce the gap width between bars\n\n#3 Combo Chart\n\nThe above two types of graphs can be combined to create a combo chart with bars and lines. This is very useful when presenting two data series with a very different scale and might be expressed in different units. The most common example is dollars on one axis and percentage on the other axis.\n\nSource: Dashboard Course\n\nTips\n\nDelete borders and gridlines\n\nAdd a legend\n\nReduce the gap width for the bars\n\nAdjust the axis\n\n#4 Scatterplot\n\nThe scatterplot is excellent for showing the relationship between two data series and determining their correlation. The scatterplot is great for showing what a distribution of data points looks like and drawing a line of best fit for regression analysis.\n\nSource: Budgeting & Forecasting Course.\n\nTips\n\nClearly label each axis\n\nAdd a trendline\n\nHighlight clusters of data\n\n#5 Waterfall Chart\n\nIn Excel 2016, Microsoft finally introduced a waterfall chart feature. In all older versions of Excel, analysts had to create a custom workaround using stacked column charts. If you are in a version of Excel before 2016, then please see our free guide and waterfall chart template. The waterfall chart is excellent for variance analysis and explaining how an “actual” result was different than a “budget” or how something has changed relative to an original data point.\n\nTips\n\nSet the start and end points to be “totals”\n\nFormat positive and negatives\n\nClear away gridlines\n\n#6 Pie Graph\n\nPie charts have a bad reputation and are known for being messy and hard to read. However, if you’re trying to illustrate the percentage breakdown of a small number of data points, they can be very effective. For example, the percentage of people who prefer bananas, pineapples, and grapes.\n\nTips\n\nKeep it 2-D only\n\nDon’t graph more than five items in one pie\n\nUse infrequently\n\n#7 Histogram\n\nHistograms are a type of graph that shows the distribution of a dataset. They graph the percentage or the number of instances of different categories. For example, to show the distribution of age categories (0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc.), we can clearly see which categories are the biggest and how many people fall into each.\n\nTips\n\nSet gap width to zero\n\nAdd a subtle border between bars\n\nAdd data labels\n\n#8 Gauge Chart\n\nThe gauge chart is perfect for graphing a single data point and showing where that result fits on a scale from “bad” to “good.” Gauges are an advanced type of graph, as Excel doesn’t have a standard template for making them. To build one you have to combine a pie and a doughnut. Learn how in our data visualization course.\n\nSource: Advanced Excel Course\n\nTips\n\nBest for a single data point\n\nShows performance on a scale (e.g., bad to good)\n\nLearn via video instruction\n\n#9 Area Graph\n\nAn area chart is a solid area and can be effective when showing stacked, cumulative data series – for example, showing the cumulative sales revenue from different products. This allows the reader to easily visualize the “area” (or weight) of each series relative to each other.\n\nTips\n\nUse stacked area\n\nGraph data that is cumulative\n\nUse colors carefully\n\n#10 Spider chart / Radar graph\n\nA spider or radar graph is a very useful type of graph for showing qualitative data or the overall “score” or comparison of multiple series. For example, a spider/radar can be easily used to compare three different types of phones based on five criteria (speed, screen size, camera quality, memory, apps).\n\nTips\n\nKeep it simple\n\nOnly graph a few series/items\n\nFormat to be minimalistic\n\nRemove markers\n\nVideo Explanation of Types of Graphs\n\nWatch this short video to learn about different types of graphs commonly seen on financial models and dashboards!\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nThank you for reading CFI’s guide on the Types of Graphs.
