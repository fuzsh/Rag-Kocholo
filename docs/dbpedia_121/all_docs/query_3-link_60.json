        "text": "Overview\n\nThe department prepares students for careers in research and teaching at the world’s leading academic institutions, focusing on Asset Pricing and Portfolio Management, Corporate Finance, International Finance, Financial Institutions and Macroeconomics.\n\nWharton’s Finance faculty, widely recognized as the finest in the world, has been at the forefront of several areas of research. For example, members of the faculty have led modern innovations in theories of portfolio choice and savings behavior, which have significantly impacted the asset pricing techniques used by researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Another example is the contribution by faculty members to the analysis of financial institutions and markets, which is fundamental to our understanding of the trade-offs between economic systems and their implications for financial fragility and crises.\n\nFaculty research, both empirical and theoretical, includes such areas as:\n\nStructure of financial markets\n\nFormation and behavior of financial asset prices\n\nBanking and monetary systems\n\nCorporate control and capital structure\n\nSaving and capital formation\n\nInternational financial markets"
