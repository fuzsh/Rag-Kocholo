        "text": "One positive bit of feedback I‚Äôve gotten from several readers as I‚Äôve worked on You Don‚Äôt Need a Budget is that the book is well researched.\n\nI‚Äôm delighted by this and proud of it. As a non-academic person with on-the-job training in journalism, I‚Äôm always proud to show off the integrity of my work. And as an outsider in these establishments who‚Äôs quite fond of listening to her gut, I‚Äôm sometimes irked by the level of third-party support people need to see to consider my claims legitimate.\n\nSometimes I think, Don‚Äôt we already know this is true, if we‚Äôre paying attention?\n\nLGBTQ+ people are twice as likely as non-LGBTQ+ people to feel anxious, overwhelmed or depressed about their finances.\n\nWomen are four times as likely as men to feel like their competency at work is questioned because of their gender.\n\nThe greatest predictor of whether you‚Äôll be rich or poor as an adult is whether your parents were rich or poor when you were growing up.\n\nFinancial education doesn‚Äôt close racial income and wealth gaps.\n\nWho are the statistics for?\n\nAny queer person could tell you how social and professional discrimination, family estrangement and exclusion from health care squeezes their finances and causes daily stress.\n\nEvery woman you meet could share her story of being asked to take meeting notes, plan birthday parties, clean the kitchen or entertain the boss‚Äôs kid well outside of her job description while the men in her office are getting promoted after having lunch with the CEO.\n\nYour working class colleagues and classmates can tell you how much more debt they‚Äôve accumulated, how much less pay they‚Äôve settled for, how much further they are from owning a home, how much less they‚Äôve saved for retirement ‚Äî even if they‚Äôre ostensibly in the same position as someone from the middle class.\n\nBlack people everywhere have been trying to tell us for decades that financial literacy isn‚Äôt their struggle; it‚Äôs financial access and inclusion.\n\nWe don‚Äôt need statistics to know these things are true. We just need to listen to the stories people are telling us.\n\nThe statistics are included for the people who aren‚Äôt willing to listen to the stories. When you‚Äôre not willing to believe someone‚Äôs lived experience, a statistic can shock you out of your disbelief. If a researcher ‚Äî maybe someone who looks more like you? shares your class background? meets your academic standards? ‚Äî can confirm it, it must be true.\n\nWhat if we started from a position of believing people‚Äôs stories?\n\nBelieve the stories\n\nI‚Äôm not completely ridiculous. I respect research and I appreciate skepticism. (After all, my book is, and I quote, ‚Äúwell researched.‚Äù üòè) I question everything and I love diving down a rabbit hole.\n\nBut sometimes I find myself reaching for a study to back up something I already know to be true because so many people have shared their stories. I understand ‚Äúpeople have told me‚Äù won‚Äôt be a sufficient answer to the question How do you know this is true?\n\nSometimes, I think, this should be the answer.\n\nSometimes the story gives you all the information you need. You don‚Äôt need proof; you just need to listen to what someone in front of you is telling you.\n\nStatistics help us understand how a person‚Äôs experience fits into a larger context, and research and education help us understand why their experience is what it is. We need those things so we can effect lasting change. But the story gives us all we need to believe the truth.\n\nDon‚Äôt wait for a shocking statistic to move you to action. Let the story be the catalyst. Just listen. Learn from the experiences of people whose perspectives are different from yours, and act on what you learn."
