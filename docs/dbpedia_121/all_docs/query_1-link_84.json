        "text": "The fields of data science and statistics have many similarities. Both focus on extracting data and using it to analyze and solve real-world problems.\n\nData scientists use statistical analysis. However, data scientists need to be familiar with statistics, among other areas.In some cases, people with a background or education in statistics can gain additional knowledge through a degree program or job training and begin a data science career.\n\nThe similarities may make it seem like data science and statistics are different names for the same professional specialization; that is not the case. Data science is a multidisciplinary field that requires skills in programming, computer science, machine learning and creating algorithms.\n\nData science involves the collection, organization, analysis and visualization of large amounts of data. Statisticians, meanwhile, use mathematical models to quantify relationships between variables and outcomes and make predictions based on those relationships. Statisticians do not use computer science, algorithms or machine learning to the same degree as computer scientists.\n\nThe basic concepts of each specialty can further illustrate the similarities and differences between data science and statistics.\n\nData scientists source, organize, extract and analyze data with the goal of addressing specific problems or answering questions. They focus on creating systems that perform these analyses and produce useful results. Data scientists involved with big data use immense amounts of information. Their role includes finding ways to extract relevant data from information warehouses.\n\nData scientists work with different types of companies. Some analyze data to provide insights that help businesses make decisions. They can also create systems that automate decision making. For example, a data scientist designed a system that collects data from your video viewing history and uses it to make personalized recommendations on Netflix.\n\nIn this way, data scientists are more focused on areas such as machine learning and computer science than statisticians. They are also involved in the creation and use of data systems, whereas statisticians focus more on the equations and mathematical models that they use for their analysis.\n\nBecause of its focus on computers and databases, many people consider data science a branch of computer science.\n\nThe main focus of statisticians is using mathematical and statistical models to analyze data.\n\nLike data science, statistics have a broad range of applications. Also, like data scientists, statisticians collect information and use it to perform analyses. Their focus is on analyzing data to provide answers and insights that can inform decision-making.\n\nStatisticians use mathematical equations and statistical models to analyze data and arrive at conclusions. Though they may work on different subjects and with different sets of data, a statistician uses math to perform quantitative analysis.\n\nInforming decision-making is a goal that data science and statistics share. The difference between these two specialties is the way that they handle that information to inform decision-making.\n\nData scientists and statisticians can work in a variety of fields. Demand for computer and information research scientists, which includes data scientists, is spiking as more companies and organizations begin looking to big data to make better decisions and improve operations.\n\nMany statistics and data science careers require a masterâ€™s degree in a relevant field. In addition to technical knowledge (also known as hard skills), professionals in these fields need specific soft skills and personal traits to succeed.\n\nData scientists typically need a degree in data science or a related field.\n\nStatisticians need a degree or equivalent experience in statistics or mathematics.\n\nBoth data science and statistics have a wide range of applications. However, the concepts that drive these types of analyses can seem abstract to people who are not familiar with them.\n\nHere are some real-world examples of data science and statistics in action."
