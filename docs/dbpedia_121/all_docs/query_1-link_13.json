DIRECTORY SERVICES\n\nThe Site is intended to provide you with certain information from Lending Institutions regarding the self-certification of their Products as Energy Efficient labelled products. The requirements of the Energy Efficient Mortgage Label Convention are intended to increase transparency and improve access to information, but they are not a substitute in any way for each User's independent product, investment and credit evaluation.\n\nThe Product Information on this Site is provided for your convenience only, and does not constitute any form of credit rating, an offer to sell (or the solicitation of an offer to purchase) any Product, nor does it constitute a recommendation, or investment advice (or any other type of advice) upon which reliance should be placed.\n\nUsers shall exercise independent judgment when viewing the Site and its contents, to make their own investigations and evaluations of the information contained on this Site or accessible through it, and to consult their own attorney, business adviser, tax adviser, and/or any other professional necessary, as to legal, business, tax and investment-related matters concerning the Products and Product Information contained on this Site.

Non-sensitive details (your e-mail address etc.) are transmitted normally over the internet, and this can never be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.\n\nOnce we receive your information, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Where we may have been given (or where you may have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.\n\nProfiling\n\nWe do not engage in active market profiling.\n\nHowever, we may analyse the personal information you provided us with (for example your identity, the company or association you work for and your job title) to identify your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information relevant to you (for example invitations to events that might be of interest to you). We may make use of additional information about you when it is available from external sources to help us do this effectively.\n\nUse of ‚ÄúCookies‚Äù\n\nLike many other websites, the EEMLF websites use cookies.\n\n‚ÄúCookies‚Äù are small pieces of information sent by an organisation to your computer and stored on your hard drive to allow that website to recognise you when you visit. They collect statistical data about your browsing actions and patterns, and do not identify you as an individual. This helps us to improve our website and provide you with a better browsing experience.\n\nIt is possible to switch off cookies by changing your browser preferences. Turning cookies off may result in a loss of functionality when using our websites.\n\nLinks to other websites\n\nOur websites may contain links to other websites run by other organisations.\n\nThis privacy policy applies only to our websites‚Äö so we encourage you to read the privacy statements on the other websites you visit. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other sites even if you access them using links from our website.\n\nIn addition, if you linked to our websites from a third-party site, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third-party site, and recommend that you check the policy of that third-party site.\n\nUse of social plug-ins (Twitter & LinkedIn)\n\nThe CBLF website uses social plugins of the social networks, LinkedIn and Twitter. You can identify the plugins by the following icons: (Twitter) and (Linkedin).\n\nBy accessing a page through a plugin, the content of the plugin is directly transmitted to your browser via LinkedIn or Twitter, which then embeds it in the web page. Hence, we have no influence over the scope of the data which LinkedIn or Twitter collects with the help of this plugin.\n\nIf you wish to suppress the linking of your data with LinkedIn or Twitter, please log out before visiting our website. You can also review your privacy policy applicable to your LinkedIn and Twitter usage on the respective websites.\n\n16 or under\n\nWe are concerned to protect the privacy of children aged 16 or under. If you are aged 16 or under‚Äö please get your parent/guardian‚Äôs permission beforehand whenever you provide us with personal information.\n\nTransferring your information outside the EU\n\nAs part of the services offered to you through our websites, the information which you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside of the European Union (‚ÄúEU‚Äù). By way of example, this may happen if you request information that one of our non-EU member associations is better placed to answer, we may transfer your request and contact information to them. We will always inform you if we forward your personal data.\n\nBy submitting your personal data, you are agreeing to this transfer, storing or processing. If you use our services while you are outside the EU, your information may be transferred outside the EU in order to provide you with those services.\n\nReview of this Policy\n\nWe review this Policy in case of policy changes. This Policy was last updated in November 2020."
