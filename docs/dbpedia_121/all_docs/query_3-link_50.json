These statistics support all aspects of the ECB's work, including monetary policy, financial stability and banking supervision.\n\nWhy do statistics matter?\n\nNarrowing the climate data gap\n\nAs part of our climate agenda, we have published an initial set of climate-related indicators to analyse how climate change will affect the financial sector. This is part of our efforts to narrow the climate data gap and monitor the green transition.\n\nClimate-related indicators\n\nRequest statistical information from the ECB\n\nAre you looking for specific ECB statistics? We follow a policy of free access and free reuse for our publicly released statistics. Send us a request specifying what you are interested in and we will get back to you as soon as possible."
