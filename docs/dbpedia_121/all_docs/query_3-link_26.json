        "meta_description": "The Global Financial Development Database is an extensive dataset of financial system characteristics for 203 economies. The database includes measures of (1) size of financial institutions and markets (financial depth), (2) degree to which individuals can and do use financial services (access), (3) efficiency of financial intermediaries and markets in intermediating resources and facilitating financial transactions (efficiency), and (4) stability of financial institutions and markets (stability). For a complete description of the dataset and a discussion of the underlying literature, see: Martin Cihák, Asli Demirgüç-Kunt, Erik Feyen, and Ross Levine, 2012.
