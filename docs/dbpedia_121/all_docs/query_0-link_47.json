Altman M. Implications of Behavioural Economics for Financial Literacy and Public Policy as reported in the National Financial Capability Strategy.\n\nAccording to the State Financial Education Mandates study, it takes time for state financial education mandates to have an effect. While very few positive effects were measured one year after implementation, by the second year after implementation, there were consistently positive results for the students. The authors contend that this lag could be due to both students and teachers adjusting to changes in the course curriculum.

For example, Walter Updegrave, senior editor of Money magazine, points out that nearly half of workers had saved less than fifty grand for retirement, and 15 percent had not saved a single cent. Looking beyond the financial literacy statistics, consider what this means to the 65% of people he referred to. The reality for many is that their senior years will not be so golden and a majority of those will struggle financially due to financial illiteracy.\n\nIn 2012, 56% of people in the US have no ‘rainy day funds’. FINRA Investor Education Foundation\n\nMore than half of millennials (about 54 percent) say debt is their “biggest financial concern.” Wells Fargo Study\n\n39% of millennials worry about their financial future “at least once a week.” Fidelity study\n\nThere’s a $6.6 trillion gap between the pensions and retirement savings of U.S. households and what they should have to maintain their living standards in retirement – and the gap is growing. Retirement Income Deficit report by Retirement USA\n\n41% of baby boomers expect their standard of living to decrease in retirement. Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.\n\nOnly 14% of baby boomers have a written retirement strategy. Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.\n\nHR professionals indicated financial worries continue to contribute to employee stress on the job. MetLife\n\n83% said that personal financial challenges had a large impact or some impact on overall employee performance. Society for Human Resource Management\n\nIn 2012, 56% of people in the US have no ‘rainy day funds’. FINRA Investor Education Foundation\n\n46% of Americans have less than $10,000 saved for retirement. Employment Benefit Research Institute\n\nIn December 2013, 19% of all homes owed at least 25% more on their mortgage than the home was worth. RealityTrac\n\nStudent load debt exceeds $1.1 Trillion. Fastweb and FinAid\n\nAs reported in September 2013, the three-year cohort default rate rose from 13.4% for FY 2009 to 14.7% for FY 2010. US Department of Education\n\nErin Mitchell, Student intern for the National Financial Educators Council\n\nLooking at the financial education statistics it is obvious to me that a lot of people are suffering due to financial illiteracy. The financial literacy statistics clearly show a lack of even the most basic knowledge. Many people wonder why so many are suffering from money problems.\n\nFinancial literacy test results are a crystal ball into the future. Seeing that the majority of college students don’t understand the importance of paying bills on time is a financial literacy statistic that says to me that a lot of those students will have credit problems. Seeing the financial education statistic that states that most do not have a set savings plan shows me that there will probably be a lot of people not able to retire.\n\nI think it’s obvious, that, unless we change these negative financial literacy statistics into positive financial education statistics that many people will still suffer from money problems.\n\nAlthough not an education expert, if money issues are causing people this much trouble – shouldn’t they teach this somewhere? The vast majority of all the financial literacy statistics point to the lack of a financial education as the primary cause of many of the problems. Shouldn’t we address that instead of billions and trillions into the results of lacking a financial education?\n\nThe financial education statistics and trends all lead us to one conclusion. That a practical financial education will take those financial literacy statistics and turn them into something we can all be proud of. How much would it help if we took the 50% of people who have less than $50k saved for retirement, and we could reduce that to 25%? That change in that financial literacy statistic alone would improve the strength of this country and the world.\n\nAs I watched an economist on CNBC discuss leading indicators, I thought how financial literacy survey results can be leading indicators to the future economic strength of individuals, communities, organizations and even the country and world.\n\nFirst let me address the individuals. The statistics from the American Dream Project that shows only 40% of people that will never gain a net worth in excess of $10,000 has some real consequences for that person. With the elimination of social security and pensions this means to the 40% that they will either work their entire life, be supported by family or live off public assistance. In any case, they will struggle with their finances.\n\nThat financial literacy statistics will affect the community and company they are with. As money is a leading cause of stress and unhealthy coping behaviors the company they are working with will likely have a less productive workforce. If the company had a workplace financial education program some of the issues may be mitigated; however, if not that company will likely lose productivity from this employee. Looking at the community the likelihood of this person needing public assistance greatly increases. If that person needs public assistance where does that money come from?\n\nTaking this financial literacy statistics out further and you can see how it impacts the country and world as a whole. The US is a consumption-based economy and if people cannot afford to purchase those items that they used to, you can see this financial literacy statistic will reduce the country’s GDP. With the global economy we are a part of today, this financial education statistic goes even further to show how the world will be impacted by the lack of personal financial education.\n\nIt is critical that we all begin working to improve the financial literacy statistics and empower people with a financial literacy programming. Making members of our community financially knowledgeable will improve the world as a whole."
