Always seem to get empty results. Might be something to do with external pointers ?\n\nIf there's also a general solution, that would download all the key statistics into a dataframe with the relevant labels displayed on the url for each, that would be great too.\n\nIf you can help, that would be fab & would likely help many others too given the API removal."
