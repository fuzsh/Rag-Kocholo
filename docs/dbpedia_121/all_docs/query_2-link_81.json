        "text": "2. Financial Services Survey: assets and liabilities\n\nThis article presents experimental balance sheet statistics for other financial institutions (OFIs). OFIs cover all financial activities except for banking, insurance, investment funds and pension funds. OFIs are the second-largest UK financial grouping by assets after banking.\n\nThe term experimental statistics means that the contributing sources are \"under active development\" and are not directly comparable with national accounts statistics. These experimental balance sheet statistics have been produced outside of current processing of the national accounts and will likely be revised prior to inclusion in future national accounts.\n\nThe primary OFIs data source is the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Financial Services Survey: assets and liabilities (FSS), although complementary experimental statistics are also used. The FSS samples most OFIs' financial activities outside of banking, investment funds, insurance corporations and pension funds.\n\nAs coronavirus (COVID-19)-related restrictions were applied in the UK during the second half of March 2020 during Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, this article compares financial assets and liabilities for the OFIs sectors with the pre-coronavirus experimental statistics for Quarter 4 2019.\n\nA full set of OFIs experimental statistics is provided for Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2019 to Quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2020, inclusive. A full set of FSS results for Quarter 4 2020 is not yet available, so we can only present data from the FSS for securities dealers on own account for Quarter 4 2020. Some OFIs' experimental non-bank lending to households statistics from other sources are also provided for Quarter 4 2020. A full set of FSS results for Quarter 4 2020 will be published in July 2021.\n\nIn previous articles, a fixed sample of securities dealers was used. However, this article presents data from an expanded sample of securities dealers for all quarters.\n\nFinancial instrument definitions can be found in Section 4 of the Institutional sectors and financial instruments in the UK flow of funds accounts matrices.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n4. Securities dealers on own account\n\nUnlike the other 19 Standard Industrial Classifications (SICs) sampled by the Financial Services Survey: assets and liabilities (FSS), experimental statistics on Securities dealers on own account (SIC 64991) are available for Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2020.\n\nSecurities consist of a range of financial instruments including bills, bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, debentures, and shares. Those corporations that specialise in trading in these securities are labelled securities dealers. Such dealers may assist other firms in issuing new securities through the underwriting and market placement of new security issues or may also trade in new or outstanding securities on their own account.\n\nSecurities dealers' total financial assets in Quarter 4 2020 were £2.7 trillion compared with £2.4 trillion in Quarter 4 2019. In Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, securities dealers' total financial assets increased sharply to £3.2 trillion.\n\nDownload this table Table 2: Security dealing on own account (SIC 64991) financial assets, £ billion\n\n.xls .csv\n\nMost of the changes in securities dealers' total assets were because of changes in holdings of derivatives. These financial instruments are contracts, between two or more parties, deriving their value from an underlying asset. As the value of the underlying asset fluctuates, the value of the derivative changes.\n\nSecurities dealers may use derivatives to protect themselves against risk or to take on risk for profit. One party is protecting themselves against risk and another is willing to take on risk for a fee, however, in some cases both parties may wish to protect themselves against risk. Increased economic uncertainty increases the need for risk management and potentially provides enhanced opportunities for securities dealers to trade derivatives.\n\nFrom Quarter 4 2019 to Quarter 4 2020, derivative holdings increased by £0.3 trillion, reaching £1.4 trillion. Of the £283 billion increase in securities dealers' derivative asset holdings during 2020, £260 billion (92%) of contracts were held with overseas (rest of the world) counterparties and £242 billion (86%) were in the form of forward contracts. There was an initial sharp increase in securities dealers' derivative assets in Quarter 1 2020, reaching £1.7 trillion, followed by a decline in the three subsequent quarters, but remaining well above Quarter 4 2019.\n\nBack to table of contents"
