Our aim is to support a shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes and toward nature-positive outcomes, aligned with the Global Biodiversity Framework.\n\nPlay full video\n\nFour disclosure pillars\n\nThe TNFD disclosure recommendations are structured around four pillars, consistent with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).\n\nThey accommodate the different approaches to materiality in use currently and are aligned with the goals and targets of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.\n\nTNFD adoption now over 400 organisations\n\nAt London Climate Action Week, TNFD announced a 30% increase in adopters of their corporate reporting recommendations since January.\n\nNew guidance published\n\nAt London Climate Action Week, we published final Additional sector guidance for eight real economy sectors to apply the LEAP approach alongside updated Additional guidance for financial institutions to apply the TNFD Recommendations and final Guidance on value chains.\n\nThis follows an 18-month process of iterative development, including extensive consultation with the TNFD’s knowledge partners and market participants.\n\nTaskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Recommendations\n\nThis document provides the final TNFD Recommendations. It includes a set of general requirements for nature-related disclosures and a set of recommended disclosures structured around the four pillars of governance, strategy, risk and…\n\nThis download is available in the following languages:\n\nEnglish\n\nFrançais\n\n日本語\n\nPortuguês\n\nEspañol\n\nGuidance on the identification and assessment of nature-related issues: the LEAP approach\n\nThis document provides guidance on the integrated approach that TNFD has developed for the identification and assessment of nature-related issues, called the LEAP approach. It is designed for use by organisations of all sizes and…\n\nDownload (English)\n\nGetting started with adoption of the TNFD Recommendations\n\nThis document provides guidance on getting started with the TNFD Recommendations. It aims to help organisations get started with their adoption journey. It includes a set of suggested key steps for all organisations to consider when…\n\nThis download is available in the following languages:\n\nEnglish\n\nFrançais\n\nWhat is the TNFD?\n\nThe TNFD is a market-led, science-based and government-supported global initiative.\n\nThe recommendations and guidance provide organisations with a risk management and disclosure framework to act on evolving nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities.\n\nThey are designed to provide decision-useful information to capital providers and other stakeholders. While the Additional Guidance helps organisations identify and assess their nature-related issues.\n\nGetting started\n\nThe TNFD recognise that organisations will have their own pathway to adopt our recommendations.\n\nTo help organisations get started, you are encouraged to join the TNFD Forum, explore the Additional Guidance and a range of useful capacity building materials in the Knowledge Hub.\n\n❝I am honoured to be stepping into the role of Co-Chair of the TNFD at this critical juncture. COP28 highlighted that business and finance now accept that climate change and nature loss are not separate challenges, but inextricably linked as integrated planetary systems. We can’t get to net zero without nature. Businesses and financial institutions of all sizes across all sectors and geographies need to start managing their interface with nature as their most important supply chain and value creation partner. I look forward to helping lead the Taskforce’s efforts as we seek to embed the TNFD recommendations in the global corporate reporting architecture aligned with the commitment of over 190 governments around the world to Target 15 of the Global Biodiversity Framework. ❞\n\nH.E. Razan Al Mubarak, Co-Chair of the TNFD, and President of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)\n\n❝Nature provides irreplaceable services to societies and businesses. I applaud the TNFD’s efforts in publishing today a framework that can be utilised to identify, assess, manage and disclose dependencies and impacts on nature, as well as risks and opportunities for organisations. France, along with various French market actors, has been actively supporting TNFD’s prefiguration and work, especially since its launch in Paris in October 2021. I wish to thank the two co-chairs, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema and David Craig, as well as market actors, scientists, public authorities, and NGOs who have contributed to this framework. The integration of biodiversity by all relevant sectors is what will ensure the shift in global financial flows toward sustainability.❞\n\nEmmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic (2021)\n\n❝We congratulate the TNFD on this major milestone that will help investors understand the risks companies are facing when it comes to nature-related issues. We are pleased to note the high-level of consistency within the finalised TNFD recommendations and the ISSB Standards, which both incorporate the architecture of the TCFD recommendations. We will consider the TNFD’s work – subject to the outcome of our recent consultation on future priorities – as we strive to simplify the disclosure landscape to deliver consistent, comprehensive sustainability-related disclosure for investors.❞\n\nSue Lloyd, Vice Chair of the ISSB\n\n❝Unless African politicians and leaders learn the lessons of others to protect nature now, the consequences will be far worse than people realise. For a collapse in biodiversity across the planet does not just mean that we face an extinction of plants and animals, but a collapse in clean water supplies, food security and the health of humans.❞\n\nDr. Donald Kaberuka, former President of the African Development Bank, Co-chair of the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-Level\n\n❝The biggest enemy from the environment are governments that deny the seriousness of climate change, destroy environmental governance, incentivize predatory use of forests without moral scruples blaming the devastation victims, which are poor populations.❞\n\nMarina Silva, Brazil’s Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Environmentalist, UN Champion of the Earth, Goldman Environmental Prize awardee\n\n❝If we put together all the knowledge systems that we have — science, technology, traditional knowledge — we can give the best of us to protect our peoples, to protect our planet, to restore the ecosystem that we are losing.❞\n\nHindou Oumarou Ibrahim, President of the Association for Indigenous Women and Peoples of Chad (AFPAT)"
