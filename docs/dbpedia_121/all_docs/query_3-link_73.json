        "text": "Learn about the Finance Concentration\n\nFinance provides the technical and analytical skills necessary to understand how financial markets function, as well as how businesses operate and make decisions within these markets. This concentration will help prepare you to enter the finance industry – whether in financial institutions and divisions or in government or non-profit institutions.\n\nThe finance curriculum can be divided into two subfields: corporate finance and investments/capital markets. Note that the material in several courses overlaps both subfields. If you are not concentrating in Finance but would like to have some exposure to corporate finance and investment/capital markets, Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) followed by Corporate Finance (FINC-UB 7) provides an excellent overview of these two areas in finance.\n\nThis finance chart lists the advanced electives by the subfield to which they belong and the associated prerequisites.\n\nFinance Concentration Requirements\n\nTo declare a concentration in Finance, you must fill out the concentration declaration form on Stern Life.\n\nRequired Functional Business Core Course:\n\nFoundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2)\n\nYou are required to complete at least 12 credits of upper-level finance courses that consist of:\n\nCorporate Finance (FINC-UB 7)\n\nAny three (3) approved finance electives:\n\nAny “FINC-UB” elective\n\nAny \"FINC-GB 6XXX level\" elective\n\nFinancial Modeling & Analysis (ACCT-UB 23)*\n\nFinancial Statement Modeling (ACCT-GB 6300)*\n\nGlobal Macroeconomics (ECON-UB 230)\n\nMacroeconomic Foundations for Asset Prices (ECON-UB 233)\n\nBusiness, Economy, and Policy in Midst of COVID-19 (MULT-UB 24)\n\nThe Financial System (MULT-UB 27)\n\nFoundations of Fintech (MULT-UB 80)\n\nScientific Computing in Finance (MATH-GA 2048)\n\nAlgorithmic Trading & Quantitative Strategies (MATH-GA 2708)\n\nRisk & Portfolio Management (MATH-GA 2751)\n\nFinancial Securities & Markets (MATH-GA 2791)\n\nContinuous Time Finance (MATH-GA 2792)\n\n*If you are in the BS/MS in Accounting Dual Degree Program, you cannot count these courses towards a second concentration in finance as they overlap with program requirements."
