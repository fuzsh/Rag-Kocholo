        "text": "OVERVIEW\n\nFirms, businesses, institutions and governmental agencies need employees who are experts at obtaining, administering and managing funds efficiently and wisely because every decision made by an organization has important financial implications.\n\nThe finance major prepares students for a broad variety of careers by introducing them to the theory, concepts, applications, institutional environment and analytical tools essential for proper decision-making. Students who major in finance will be prepared for careers in financial management and analysis, commercial and investment banking, financial institutions, financial markets, investments, portfolio analysis and management, financial planning and multinational finance. Finance also is recognized as valuable preparation for graduate study in law or business.\n\nADMISSION REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo be certified to the Finance major, a student must meet the admission requirements for the College of Business. Upon completing all requirements for this major, the student will graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Finance.\n\nCOURSE REQUIREMENTS\n\nCourses for the major are updated each academic year. Students must use the course requirements from the academic year they were certified into the College of Business. Typically, students are certified to the College of Business beginning their junior year, and the academic year runs fall through summer.\n\n2024-2025 Requirements\n\n2023-2024 Requirements\n\n2022-2023 Requirements\n\n2021-2022 Requirements\n\nACADEMIC MAPPING\n\nAcademic Map\n\nMapping is Florida State University’s academic advising and monitoring system that provides each student with a recommended eight semester map for completing their bachelor’s degree in four years. Summer semesters are not included in degree mapping, but the student may use summer terms to either get ahead or catch up in their degree program.\n\nStudents are not required to complete all the recommended classes on their map to remain on course; they simply must meet certain minimum requirements known as \"milestones.\" Milestones include a minimum grade point average (GPA), completion of specific courses and minimum grades (typically “C-” or better, although there are some exceptions) in the milestone classes. Milestones are identified on each major map. All incoming freshmen are monitored for Semester 1 milestone criteria, regardless of the number of hours they previously accumulated through dual enrollment and/or credit by examination.\n\nStudents will be contacted if they are not making the appropriate progress. Students who do not satisfy the appropriate milestones at the end of any semester will be notified by the university. The first time a student is off course, a Hold will be placed on registration; and the student will be required to contact an adviser to have the registration Hold removed. The advisor will discuss: (1) what is necessary to get back on course; and/or (2) possible alternative majors. If the student is off course for two consecutive semesters, a Hold is placed on registration; and the student will be required to change their major to an area outside of business.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe college's Student Investment Fund and Trading Room provide hands-on experience in the real world of finance by training students in financial modeling and portfolio management, giving them an edge in the competitive job market of Wall Street investing. Opportunities for students to learn outside the classroom are offered through our internship program and international programs and numerous networking and leadership opportunities through student organizations, such as the Financial Management Association and the Master of Finance Student Association, and our Closing Bell Speaker Series. Generous scholarships help support students along the way."
