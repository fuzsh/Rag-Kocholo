        "text": "Challenge yourself with a high-level mix of mathematic and finance disciplines\n\nThis mathematically rigorous course is unique in providing training from three top departments at Warwick: Statistics, Mathematics and Warwick Business School. It enables you to develop and apply the quantitative skills in machine learning, computational statistics and mathematical finance used in the financial markets and the finance industry.\n\nBuild on your strong mathematical background to gain both a deep theoretical and conceptual knowledge of finance, together with the requisite high-level probability, statistics and mathematics, to enable you to undertake advanced quantitative modelling. Lab work will give you hands-on experience of using software packages for simulations and time series analysis, as well as learning programming for quantitative finance in three core languages: Python, C++ and R.\n\nOur departments benefit from excellent links to key financial institutions and employers, and this course has benefited from industry recommendations.\n\nDiscover more about our course structure on the Statistics Department website.\n\nPlease note that this course was previously named MSc Financial Mathematics."
