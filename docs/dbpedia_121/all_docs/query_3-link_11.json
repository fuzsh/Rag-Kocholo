        "text": "I think a good book to start in your case is:\n\nAttilio Meucci: Risk and Asset Allocation\n\nI once had a seminar held by Attilio that was based on the book and it blew my mind. The book is very intuitive yet rigorous.\n\nElements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman is one of the most-cited books for your purpose. Although it does not have any direct applications to Finance, this is definitely a good book to have in your professional library and can be used as a reference for most topics.\n\nIf you want to use a book with more financial applications, I would say that Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering by Ruppert is one of the best for you. It contains the necessary basics as well as more advanced topics for time series, regression techniques, copulas, and general multivariate statistical methods. I would suggest that you look through the table of contents to get a good overview. The book also contains R code, which might be useful to you, since it is one of the most used languages in statistical analysis."
