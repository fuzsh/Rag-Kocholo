[Full-Time]\n\nEntry requirements\n\nFormal entry requirements are listed here but since applicants come from many different backgrounds, it will be useful to consider yourself whether you feel as if you have the right background for the course. Some general expectations are listed below, with references to existing courses on that material in Manchester. It should hopefully give you a feel for the course and what is expected of the incoming student. We would only consider a few of these courses as absolutely essential, but some additional background is desirable and will certainly assist you greatly for course preparation. If in doubt then please contact us.\n\nThe normal entry requirements are a good upper second or first class honours degree from a UK university, or the equivalent from an overseas university, in Mathematics, or in a subject with significant mathematical content.\n\nYou are expected to have done well in the above courses and your university should have a high national standing.\n\nA good background in Probability Theory is essential; for example two courses in Probability, Probability 1 and Probability 2.\n\nKnowledge of Statistics is highly desirable, for example Introduction to Statistics. More advanced courses in Probability are highly desirable, for example Foundations of Modern Probability.\n\nKnowledge of measure-theoretical Probability and/or measure theory is desirable as well. An introduction to Markov processes is desirable but not essential, for example Random models or Markov processes, but not essential.\n\nKnowledge of real analysis is essential and of complex analysis is desirable, for example Real and Complex Analysis.\n\nKnowledge of basic calculus, for example Calculus and Vectors A, and ordinary differential equations is essential, Calculus and Applications A.\n\nKnowledge of partial differential equations is highly desirable, for example Partial Differential Equations and Vector Calculus A.\n\nKnowledge of solving partial differential equations numerically is desirable but not essential.\n\nAlthough there is no formal requirement for previous programming experience, a familiarity with writing computer programs (for example, in Python, MATLAB, C/C++ or Java) is desirable.\n\nFull entry requirements\n\nHow to apply\n\nApply online\n\nAs there is high demand for this course we operate a staged admissions process with selection deadlines throughout the year. Details of the staged application deadlines can be found in the application and selection section.\n\nDue to the competition for places, we give preference to students with grades above our minimum entry requirements.Â If we make you an offer, you will have 3 weeks in which to accept. Any offers not accepted within 3 weeks will be withdrawn so that an offer can be made to another candidate.\n\nCourse options\n\nFull-time Part-time Full-time distance learning Part-time distance learning MSc Y N N N\n\nAttend an open day\n\nDownload our course brochure\n\nCourse description\n\nTheÂ Department of Mathematics and Alliance Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester have combined their academic strength and practical expertise to deliver theÂ MSc in Mathematical Finance (UK 1 year), ensuring that students can experience both the mathematical and economic perspective of the subject.\n\nThe course provides students with advanced knowledge and understanding of the main theoretical and applied concepts in Mathematical Finance delivered from a genuinely international and multi-cultural perspective with a current issues approach to teaching. The focus is on mathematical theory and modelling, drawing from the disciplines of probability theory, scientific computing and partial differential equations to derive relations between asset prices and interest rates, and to develop models for pricing, risk management and financial product development.\n\nThe finance industry demands recruits with strong quantitative skills and the course is intended to prepare students for careers in this area. The course provides training for those who seek a career in the finance industry specialising in derivative securities, investment, risk management and hedge funds. It also provides research skills for those who subsequently wish to pursue research and/or an academic career (e.g. university lecturer) or continue the study at doctoral level, particularly those wishing to pursue further/advanced studies in Mathematical Finance.\n\nOpen days\n\nFor details of the next University Postgraduate open day, visit open days and visits\n\nFees\n\nFor entry in the academic year beginning September 2024, the tuition fees are as follows:\n\nMSc (full-time)\n\nUK students (per annum): Â£15,500\n\nInternational, including EU, students (per annum): Â£33,000\n\nFurther information for EU students can be found on our dedicated EU page.\n\nThe fees quoted above will be fully inclusive for the course tuition, administration and computational costs during your studies.\n\nAll fees for entry will be subject to yearly review and incremental rises per annum are also likely over the duration of courses lasting more than a year for UK/EU students (fees are typically fixed for International students, for the course duration at the year of entry). For general fees information please visit: postgraduate fees . Always contact the department if you are unsure which fee applies to your qualification award and method of attendance.\n\nSelf-funded international applicants for this course will be required to pay a deposit of Â£1000 towards their tuition fees before a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS) is issued. This deposit will only be refunded if immigration permission is refused. We will notify you about how and when to make this payment.\n\nPolicy on additional costs\n\nAll students should normally be able to complete their programme of study without incurring additional study costs over and above the tuition fee for that programme. Any unavoidable additional compulsory costs totalling more than 1% of the annual home undergraduate fee per annum, regardless of whether the programme in question is undergraduate or postgraduate taught, will be made clear to you at the point of application. Further information can be found in the University's Policy on additional costs incurred by students on undergraduate and postgraduate taught programmes (PDF document, 91KB).\n\nFor more information, see the Department ofÂ Mathematics Fees and funding Â page orÂ visit the University of ManchesterÂ funding for master's courses website for more information.\n\nCourses in related subject areas\n\nUse the links below to view lists of courses in related subject areas.\n\nMathematics\n\nRegulated by the Office for Students\n\nThe University of Manchester is regulated by the Office for Students (OfS). The OfS aims to help students succeed in Higher Education by ensuring they receive excellent information and guidance, get high quality education that prepares them for the future and by protecting their interests. More information can be found at the OfS website.\n\nYou can find regulations and policies relating to student life at The University of Manchester, including our Degree Regulations and Complaints Procedure, on our regulations website."
