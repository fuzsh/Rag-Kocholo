This interdisciplinary center dedicated to quantitative methods applied to social sciences is composed of four poles: economics, statistics, finance-insurance and sociology. The Palaiseau laboratories are located on the 3rd and 4th floors of the École Polytechnique building, thus facilitating exchanges between students and faculty.",

        "text": "The LabEx EcoDec is a laboratory of excellence in Economics and Decision Sciences associating ENSAE Paris, École Polytechnique and HEC Paris.\n\nENSAE and CREST are also winners of the \"University Research School (EUR)\" call for projects under the PIA (Plan d'investissements d'avenir) within IP Paris, in association with HEC Paris. The EUR Data Science for Economics, Finance and Management is a multidisciplinary project bringing together teams of economists, econometricians, quantitative sociologists, statisticians and specialists in quantitative finance, with the ambition of strengthening the impact and international attractiveness of research and Master's and PhD courses. The EURs are publicly funded by the French National Research Agency (ANR) over 10 years and aim to\n\nstrongly link, at the highest level, education and research by bringing together universities, schools and research organizations in a single dynamic of excellence\n\nenhance the thematic strengths of institutions and sites throughout the country, regardless of their size and the disciplines involved, by organizing the research and training strengths that constitute the signature of these institutions or sites\n\ncontribute to the international influence and attractiveness of the country by building strategic international partnerships and attracting the best students.\n\nThis EUR is very structuring for the development of training in and through research at ENSAE-CREST within IP Paris over the next few years.\n\nENSAE Paris has set up numerous partnerships with companies to finance multi-year research programs whose purpose is to enrich public scientific research.\n\nFor the funders, the aim is to promote academic research in fields that concern them, to get closer to researchers and the latest advances in research, and to benefit from an image effect, a source of attractiveness in their talent recruitment operations. These research programs are built through chairs and research initiatives, which are distinguished from research contracts by their purpose: a contract refers to \"proprietary\" research in the sense that the results of the funded research are the property of the funder. In contrast, the results of chairs and research initiatives are public goods that are intended to be published in freely accessible scientific journals. This is the sine qua non condition for these programs to be considered as sponsorship.\n\nThe ENSAE-CREST chairs and research initiatives are supported by the Louis Bachelier Institute and its foundation (Fondation du Risque)."
