        "text": "The TFFS was created in 1992 under the auspices of the United Nations Statistical Commission to take stock of the activities of the international organizations involved in finance statistics and to make recommendations aimed at streamlining their work, in particular to avoid duplication of activities.\n\nIn the wake of the financial crises of the mid-1990âs, its mandate was broadened in 1998, to coordinate work to improve the methodological soundness, transparency, timeliness, and availability of data on external debt and international reserves.\n\nThe TFFS meets annually either in Washington or in Europe, at the Headquarters of one of its members."
