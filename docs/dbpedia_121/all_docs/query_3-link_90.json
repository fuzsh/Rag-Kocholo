        "text": "Only complaints sent to companies for response are eligible to be published and are only published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship or after 15 days, whichever comes first. The database generally updates daily.\n\nWe do not publish complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.\n\nWe publish the consumer’s narrative description from their complaint if the consumer opts to share it publicly and after the Bureau takes steps to remove personal information.\n\nThis database is not a statistical sample of consumers’ experiences in the marketplace and these complaints are not necessarily representative of all consumers’ experiences with a financial product or company. Complaints are not “information” for purposes of the Information Quality Act.\n\nSee publication criteria\n\nMore about the data we publish\n\nUnderstanding complaint volume\n\nThe lack of complaints or a relatively low number of complaints published in the database about a product, issue, or company does not necessarily mean there is little or no consumer harm. Depending on the nature of the financial product and how consumers use the product, consumers may be harmed in ways that do not cause them to complain to the Bureau or to blame the product or provider for the harm they have suffered.\n\nWhen looking at complaint volume about a company or product, consider company size and/or market share. For example, companies with more customers may have more complaints than companies with fewer customers.\n\nWhen looking at complaint volume for a state or ZIP code, consider the population in that geography.\n\nWe encourage you to pair complaint data with public and private data sets for additional context.\n\nLearn about past changes to the database\n\nViewing trends\n\nRecent complaint data and trends will not yet include all complaints eligible for publication to allow companies 15 days to respond.\n\nView trends\n\nReading complaints\n\nComplaint narratives are consumers’ descriptions of their experiences in their own words. Consider what conclusions may be fairly drawn from reading consumers’ descriptions of their experiences. We do not adopt their views or verify that their experiences are accurate or unbiased.\n\nRecent complaint data will not include all complaint narratives eligible for publication until we have completed our steps to remove personal information from each consumer narrative.\n\nRead complaints\n\nHow we use complaint data\n\nComplaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal consumer financial laws, enforce those laws judiciously, and educate and empower consumers to make informed financial decisions.\n\nMore on how we use complaint data\n\nRead Annual Report to Congress\n\nFind other analyses of complaints\n\nGet the data\n\nDownloading the data\n\nYou can download all complaint data as either a CSV or JSON file here, or you can download a subset of the data—such as all complaints for a specific product—by filtering the full data set and exporting your results.\n\nFilter the full data set before you download\n\nDownload all complaint data | CSV\n\nDownload all complaint data | JSON\n\nSee database field reference\n\nSee past database releases\n\nUsing our API\n\nLooking to export our data and have more control over it?
