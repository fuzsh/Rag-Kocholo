        "text": "10 credits\n\nThis module will cover the theory of assessing risks under uncertainty. It will focus on the practical assessment of risk using simulation methods such as Monte Carlo simulation. You'll develop skills in communicating risk to risk managers as well as formulating practical risk questions that can influence policy decisions.\n\nYou can expect to learn about:\n\nuncertainty and variability\n\nbootstrapping\n\nMonte Carlo Simulation\n\nselecting appropriate probability distributions based on given scenarios\n\nThis module will introduce you to Bayesian statistics and the modern Bayesian methods that are used in a variety of applications. Like with other modules, the focus is on real-life data and using statistical software packages for analysis.\n\nYou will gain experience in working with the following:\n\nvisualising spatial data\n\ngeospatial data, including methods for prediction\n\nbayesian modelling using software to implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n\nareal unit modelling\n\nThis module covers all aspects of statistical consultancy skills necessary for being a successful statistician working in any research or customer environment. You will work on real-life problems in small groups and have the opportunity to interact with stakeholders researchers to formulate hypotheses.\n\nThis module will cover how to:\n\nengage with professionals working in business, industry and the public sector\n\napply their statistical knowledge in different situations\n\neffectively communicate statistical results to non-statisticians\n\nSurveys are an important way of collecting data. This class will introduce you to the methods that are commonly used to design questionnaires and analyse data resulting from these questionnaires.\n\nYou will consider:\n\nhow to design appropriate survey questions\n\na variety of sampling methods\n\nanalysing data for different sampling methods\n\nEvery two days, we generate as much data as the data generated in all human history up to 2003. From online data on every click of the mouse on the internet through the huge upsurge in manufacturing companiesâ€™ use of sensors to sports organisations collecting in game data. With these increased quantities of data comes an increased need for tools to make sense of the main messages coming from these data.\n\nThe class will build on the fundamental multivariate statistics by developing both visualisation and advanced analysis techniques relevant in the area of big data. The focus will be on application and interpretation of techniques and there will be an investigation of what makes good data. The class will develop both new theoretical knowledge in the form of analytics techniques as well as new software skills in relevant analytics software."
