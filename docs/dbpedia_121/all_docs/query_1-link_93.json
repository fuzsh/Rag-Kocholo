        "text": "If you're reading this, you likely already know the importance of data analysis. And you already know it can be incredibly complex.\n\nAt its simplest, research and it's data can be broken down into two different categories: quantitative and qualitative. But what's the difference between each? And when should you use them? And how can you use them together?\n\nUnderstanding the differences between qualitative and quantitative data is key to any research project. Knowing both approaches can help you in understanding your data better—and ultimately understand your customers better.\n\nQuick takeaways:\n\nQuantitative research uses objective, numerical data to answer questions like \"what\" and \"how often.\" Conversely, qualitative research seeks to answer questions like \"why\" and \"how,\" focusing on subjective experiences to understand motivations and reasons.\n\nQuantitative data is collected through methods like surveys and experiments and analyzed statistically to identify patterns. Qualitative data is gathered through interviews or observations and analyzed by categorizing information to understand themes and insights.\n\nEffective data analysis combines quantitative data for measurable insights with qualitative data for contextual depth.\n\nWhat is quantitative data?\n\nQualitative and quantitative data differ in their approach and the type of data they collect.\n\nQuantitative data refers to any information that can be quantified — that is, numbers. If it can be counted or measured, and given a numerical value, it's quantitative in nature. Think of it as a measuring stick.\n\nQuantitative variables can tell you \"how many,\" \"how much,\" or \"how often.\"\n\nSome examples of quantitative data:\n\nHow many people attended last week's webinar?\n\nHow much revenue did our company make last year?\n\nHow often does a customer rage click on this app?\n\nTo analyze these research questions and make sense of this quantitative data, you’d normally use a form of statistical analysis—collecting, evaluating, and presenting large amounts of data to discover patterns and trends. Quantitative data is conducive to this type of analysis because it’s numeric and easier to analyze mathematically.\n\nComputers now rule statistical analytics, even though traditional methods have been used for years. But today’s data volumes make statistics more valuable and useful than ever. When you think of statistical analysis now, you think of powerful computers and algorithms that fuel many of the software tools you use today.\n\nPopular quantitative data collection methods are surveys, experiments, polls, and more.\n\nWhat is qualitative data?\n\nUnlike quantitative data, qualitative data is descriptive, expressed in terms of language rather than numerical values.\n\nQualitative data analysis describes information and cannot be measured or counted. It refers to the words or labels used to describe certain characteristics or traits.\n\nYou would turn to qualitative data to answer the \"why?\" or \"how?\" questions. It is often used to investigate open-ended studies, allowing participants (or customers) to show their true feelings and actions without guidance.\n\nSome examples of qualitative data:\n\nWhy do people prefer using one product over another?\n\nHow do customers feel about their customer service experience?\n\nWhat do people think about a new feature in the app?\n\nThink of qualitative data as the type of data you'd get if you were to ask someone why they did something. Popular data collection methods are in-depth interviews, focus groups, or observation.\n\nWhat are the differences between qualitative vs. quantitative data?\n\nWhen it comes to conducting data research, you’ll need different collection, hypotheses and analysis methods, so it’s important to understand the key differences between quantitative and qualitative data:\n\nQuantitative data is numbers-based, countable, or measurable. Qualitative data is interpretation-based, descriptive, and relating to language.\n\nQuantitative data tells us how many, how much, or how often in calculations. Qualitative data can help us to understand why, how, or what happened behind certain behaviors.\n\nQuantitative data is fixed and universal. Qualitative data is subjective and unique.\n\nQuantitative research methods are measuring and counting. Qualitative research methods are interviewing and observing.\n\nQuantitative data is analyzed using statistical analysis. Qualitative data is analyzed by grouping the data into categories and themes.\n\nAs you can see, both provide immense value for any data collection and are key to truly finding answers and patterns.\n\nMore examples of quantitative and qualitative data\n\nYou’ve most likely run into quantitative and qualitative data today, alone. For the visual learner, here are some examples of both quantitative and qualitative data:\n\nQuantitative data example\n\nThe customer has clicked on the button 13 times.\n\nThe engineer has resolved 34 support tickets today.\n\nThe team has completed 7 upgrades this month.\n\n14 cartons of eggs were purchased this month.\n\nQualitative data example\n\nMy manager has curly brown hair and blue eyes.\n\nMy coworker is funny, loud, and a good listener.\n\nThe customer has a very friendly face and a contagious laugh.\n\nThe eggs were delicious.\n\nThe fundamental difference is that one type of data answers primal basics and one answers descriptively.\n\nWhat does this mean for data quality and analysis? If you just analyzed quantitative data, you’d be missing core reasons behind what makes a data collection meaningful. You need both in order to truly learn from data—and truly learn from your customers.\n\nAddressing bias in data collection and analysis\n\nWhile both quantitative and qualitative data provide valuable insights, it's important to recognize that both are susceptible to bias. Understanding and mitigating these biases is crucial for conducting reliable research and drawing accurate conclusions.\n\nIn quantitative research, selection bias is a common concern. This occurs when the data collected isn't truly representative of the population being studied, potentially leading to skewed results. For instance, an online-only survey might exclude demographics with limited internet access.\n\nQualitative research faces its own bias challenges. Researcher bias can influence data interpretation, while participant selection bias might result in missing important perspectives. Additionally, participants might alter their responses based on what they think the researcher wants to hear.\n\nTo address these issues:\n\nUse careful sampling methods in quantitative studies\n\nEmploy strategies like triangulation and reflexivity in qualitative research\n\nConsider mixed methods approaches when possible\n\nBe transparent about potential limitations in your research\n\nBy acknowledging and actively working to minimize bias in both quantitative and qualitative research, researchers can enhance the validity and reliability of their findings, leading to more accurate and useful insights.\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of each?\n\nBoth types of data has their own pros and cons.\n\nAdvantages of quantitative data\n\nIt’s relatively quick and easy to collect and it’s easier to draw conclusions from.\n\nWhen you collect quantitative data, the type of results will tell you which statistical tests are appropriate to use.\n\nAs a result, interpreting your data and presenting those findings is straightforward and less open to error and subjectivity.\n\nAnother advantage is that you can replicate it. Replicating a study is possible because your data collection is measurable and tangible for further applications.\n\nDisadvantages of quantitative data\n\nQuantitative data doesn’t always tell you the full story (no matter what the perspective).\n\nWith choppy information, it can be inconclusive.\n\nQuantitative research can be limited, which can lead to overlooking broader themes and relationships.\n\nBy focusing solely on numbers, there is a risk of missing larger focus information that can be beneficial.\n\nAdvantages of qualitative data\n\nQualitative data offers rich, in-depth insights and allows you to explore context.\n\nIt’s great for exploratory purposes.\n\nQualitative research delivers a predictive element for continuous data.\n\nDisadvantages of qualitative data\n\nIt’s not a statistically representative form of data collection because it relies upon the experience of the host (who can lose data).\n\nIt can also require multiple data sessions, which can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\nThe takeaway is that it’s tough to conduct a successful data analysis without both. They both have their advantages and disadvantages and, in a way, they complement each other.\n\nNow, of course, in order to analyze both types of data, information has to be collected first.\n\nLet's get into the research.\n\nQuantitative and qualitative research\n\nThe core difference between qualitative and quantitative research lies in their focus and methods of data collection and analysis. This distinction guides researchers in choosing an appropriate approach based on their specific research needs.\n\nUsing mixed methods of both can also help provide insights form combined qualitative and quantitative data.\n\nBest practices of each help to look at the information under a broader lens to get a unique perspective. Using both methods is helpful because they collect rich and reliable data, which can be further tested and replicated.\n\nWhat is quantitative research?\n\nQuantitative research is based on the collection and interpretation of numeric data. It's all about the numbers and focuses on measuring (using inferential statistics) and generalizing results. Quantitative research seeks to collect numerical data that can be transformed into usable statistics.\n\nIt relies on measurable data to formulate facts and uncover patterns in research. By employing statistical methods to analyze the data, it provides a broad overview that can be generalized to larger populations.\n\nIn terms of digital experience data, it puts everything in terms of numbers (or discrete data)—like the number of users clicking a button, bounce rates, time on site, and more.\n\nSome examples of quantitative research:\n\nWhat is the amount of money invested into this service?\n\nWhat is the average number of times a button was dead clicked?\n\nHow many customers are actually clicking this button?\n\nEssentially, quantitative research is an easy way to see what’s going on at a 20,000-foot view.\n\nEach data set (or customer action, if we’re still talking digital experience) has a numerical value associated with it and is quantifiable information that can be used for calculating statistical analysis so that decisions can be made.\n\nYou can use statistical operations to discover feedback patterns (with any representative sample size) in the data under examination. The results can be used to make predictions, find averages, test causes and effects, and generalize results to larger measurable data pools.\n\nUnlike qualitative methodology, quantitative research offers more objective findings as they are based on more reliable numeric data.\n\nQuantitative data collection methods\n\nSurveys\n\nA survey is one of the most common research methods with quantitative data that involves questioning a large group of people. Questions are usually closed-ended and are the same for all participants. An unclear questionnaire can lead to distorted research outcomes.\n\nPolls\n\nSimilar to surveys, polls yield quantitative data. That is, you poll a number of people and apply a numeric value to how many people responded with each answer.\n\nExperiments\n\nAn experiment is another common method that usually involves a control group and an experimental group. The experiment is controlled and the conditions can be manipulated accordingly. You can examine any type of records involved if they pertain to the experiment, so the data is extensive.\n\nWhat is qualitative research?\n\nQualitative research does not simply help to collect data. It gives a chance to understand the trends and meanings of natural actions. It’s flexible and iterative.\n\nQualitative research focuses on the qualities of users—the actions that drive the numbers. It's descriptive research. The qualitative approach is subjective, too.\n\nIt focuses on describing an action, rather than measuring it.\n\nSome examples of qualitative research:\n\nThe sunflowers had a fresh smell that filled the office.\n\nAll the bagels with bites taken out of them had cream cheese.\n\nThe man had blonde hair with a blue hat.\n\nQualitative research utilizes interviews, focus groups, and observations to gather in-depth insights.\n\nThis approach shines when the research objective calls for exploring ideas or uncovering deep insights rather than quantifying elements.\n\nQualitative data collection methods\n\nInterviews\n\nAn interview is the most common qualitative research method. This method involves personal interaction (either in real life or virtually) with a participant. It’s mostly used for exploring attitudes and opinions regarding certain issues.\n\nInterviews are very popular methods for collecting data in product design.\n\nFocus groups\n\nData analysis by focus group is another method where participants are guided by a host to collect data. Within a group (either in person or online), each member shares their opinion and experiences on a specific topic, allowing researchers to gather perspectives and deepen their understanding of the subject matter.\n\nSo which type of data is better for data analysis?\n\nSo how do you determine which type is better for data analysis?\n\nQuantitative data is structured and accountable. This type of data is formatted in a way so it can be organized, arranged, and searchable. Think about this data as numbers and values found in spreadsheets—after all, you would trust an Excel formula.\n\nQualitative data is considered unstructured. This type of data is formatted (and known for) being subjective, individualized, and personalized. Anything goes. Because of this, qualitative data is inferior if it’s the only data in the study. However, it’s still valuable.\n\nBecause quantitative data is more concrete, it’s generally preferred for data analysis. Numbers don’t lie. But for complete statistical analysis, using both qualitative and quantitative yields the best results."
