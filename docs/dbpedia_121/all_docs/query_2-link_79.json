It includes:\n\nrevenue budget and outturn\n\nschool level revenue budget and outturn\n\ncapital forecast and outturn\n\ncouncil tax dwellings, levels and collection\n\nnon-domestic rates estimates and actuals\n\nMode of data collection\n\nData is collected from local authorities, police authorities, fire authorities and national park authorities via Excel spreadsheets which are downloaded from the Welsh Government website. Feedback from respondents suggests this method is the most useful.\n\nFigures are subjected to rigorous pre-defined validation tests both within the form itself, while the form is being completed by the authority, and also by the Welsh Government.\n\nThe spreadsheets allow respondents to validate some data before sending the spreadsheet to the Welsh Government. Respondents are also given an opportunity to include contextual information where large changes have occurred. This ensures that the data received by the Welsh Government is already of a high quality before any internal validation checks are carried out. Examples of validation checks within the forms include year on year changes, cross checks with other relevant data collections and checks to ensure data is within predefined tolerances.\n\nValidation and verification\n\nOnce we receive the data, it goes through further validation and verification checks, for example:\n\nspend per head by local authority\n\narithmetic consistency checks\n\ncross checks with other relevant data collections\n\nthorough tolerance checks\n\noutturn comparison with budgets\n\ncross checks with data from other government departments\n\nverification that data outside of tolerances are actually correct\n\nIf any validation issues are identified, the authority is informed and are asked to submit a revised spreadsheet. The Welsh Government does not input any data into local authority spreadsheets and insists that the authorities make the relevant changes and resubmit the spreadsheet. This ensures local ownership of the data.\n\nThis process continues until the data passes all validation checks.\n\nOnce the data set is fully validated ahead of the publication date, statistical publications are drafted and internal meetings are held to discuss and finalise the data. If any issues are found at this stage then the authorities are contacted again and asked to provide explanations or resubmit the spreadsheet with amendments.\n\nOnce all checks are finalised, the data is cleared for publication.\n\nSeveral of the data collections require signing off by the chief financial officer in each local authority to confirm that the data has been checked and is correct. Non-domestic rates returns are also subject to audit from Audit Wales.\n\nThese statistics follow a vertically and horizontally integrated process. Hence, the data flowing into the statistical first releases and bulletins is automated. However, the key points and commentary are drafted separately.\n\nStandards\n\nThe data that is collected adhere to recognised professional standards. Specifically, the finance data is required under legislation and also must adhere to CIPFA accounting procedures. However, further guidelines are provided by the Welsh Government on the interpretation of these standards to ensure consistency across authorities.\n\nDisclosure and confidentiality\n\nDisclosure and confidentiality are not areas of concern as all the data collected and published must be made publicly available under legislation.\n\nQuality\n\nWelsh Local Government Statistics adhere to a quality strategy, and this is in line with the European Statistical System’s six dimensions as listed in Principle 4 of the Code of Practice.\n\nSpecifically, the list below details the six dimensions and how we adhere to them.\n\nRelevance\n\nThe degree to which the statistical product meets user needs for both coverage and content.\n\nThe suite of statistics produced by Local Government Finance cover all aspects of expenditure (and budgets) by local government. Government users use the data directly for revenue allocation and making policy decisions. Local government and other non-government bodies use the data for benchmarking. Other interest and uses of this data is outlined above.\n\nWe continue to maintain a live list of users and uses. We encourage users of the statistics to contact us to let us know how they use the data.\n\nWe consult with key users prior to making changes, and where possible use vehicles such as the internet, committees and other networks to consult with unknown users.\n\nWe also have a user community which meets quarterly and an online community of practice.\n\nWe actively review all our outputs and welcome feedback. Comments can be emailed to stats.finance@gov.wales\n\nAccuracy\n\nThe closeness between an estimated result and the (unknown) true value\n\nAccuracy can be broken down into sampling and non-sampling error. Non-sampling error includes areas such as coverage error, non-response error, measurement error, processing error.\n\nThe data requested and provided by local authorities, fire, police and national parks are required under legislation. The collection is a 100% survey and as such no estimation of the figures is calculated, and hence there is no sampling error.\n\nNon-sampling error is reduced due to the existence and compulsory adherence to national professional accounting standards, as published by CIPFA. Furthermore, significant additional guidance is provided about the data collections. Where non-sampling error affects the data we provide full information for users to allow them to make informed judgements on the quality of the statistics, particularly if there are limitations of the data.\n\nAll our outputs include key quality information on coverage, timing and geography.\n\nIn the unlikely event of incorrect data being published, revisions would be made and users informed in conjunction with our revisions, errors and postponements arrangements.\n\nTimeliness and punctuality\n\nTimeliness refers to the lapse of time between publication and the period to which the data refer. Punctuality refers to the time lag between the actual and planned dates of publication.\n\nAll outputs adhere to the Code of Practice by pre-announcing the data of publication through the upcoming calendar. Furthermore, should the need arise to postpone an output this would follow our revisions, errors and postponements arrangements.\n\nWe publish releases as soon as practical after the relevant time period.\n\nAccessibility and clarity\n\nAccessibility is the ease with which users are able to access the data, also reflecting the format(s) in which the data are available and the availability of supporting information. Clarity refers to the quality and sufficiency of the metadata, illustrations and accompanying advice.\n\nThe Welsh local government finance statistics are published in an accessible, orderly, pre-announced manner on the Welsh Government website at 9:30am on the day of publication. All releases are available to download for free.\n\nMore detailed data are also available at the same time on the StatsWales website and this can be manipulated online or downloaded into spreadsheets for use offline.\n\nWe aim to use Plain English in our outputs and all outputs adhere to the Welsh Government accessibility policy. Furthermore, all our headlines are published in Welsh and English.\n\nWe regularly peer review our outputs.\n\nFurther information regarding the statistics can be obtained by contacting the relevant staff detailed on the release or via stats.finance@gov.wales\n\nComparability\n\nThe degree to which data can be agreed over both time and domain.\n\nAdhering to the professional code (CIPFA’s SeRCOP) has meant that changes over time have been minimal. Where there have been time series which are not comparable from the start of the time series to the end this will be shown clearly in the outputs. Where advance warning is known of future changes these will be pre-announced in accordance with Welsh Government arrangements.\n\nWhere appropriate we will include links and data to other comparable regions and countries.\n\nWhere standard definitions are not used we will highlight this and explain the reason why.\n\nThe existence of a professional code and our adherence to it provides assurance that the data are consistent across domains, such as local authorities.\n\nCoherence\n\nThe degree to which data that are derived from different sources or methods, but which refer to the same phenomenon, are similar.\n\nThe data are all collected from the same source and therefore will be vertically aligned. Furthermore, as the data adhere to the national professional standard, CIPFA, they will also be horizontally aligned between organisations.\n\nData collections are checked between forms to ensure coherence of the data received.\n\nFurthermore, a close working relationship with CIPFA ensures the data used there also match that which is published by the Welsh Government.\n\nWhere possible data collected in Wales is harmonised to that in England. However, there may be differences with the data published in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nDissemination\n\nAll the data is of sufficient quality following the significant checking outlined above to justify publication. The high level messages are published on the first page of the relevant release and high level tables are included in the release. All the actual data provided is published on our interactive website, StatsWales."
