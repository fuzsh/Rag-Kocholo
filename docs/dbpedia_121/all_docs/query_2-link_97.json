        "text": "If you’re applying for the 2025/2026 academic year, please provide a brief explanation of your financial need when prompted in the application. We’re here to support you on your academic journey!\n\nPaid Teaching or Research Assistantships\n\nGraduate Student Researcher (GSR) appointments are reserved for PhD students; however, a limited number of Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) opportunities are available for MA students each semester. MA students are informed of these opportunities before each semester; at which point they can apply for a position if they wish. Selection will be based on teaching experience, English proficiency, performance in the MA program, the student’s schedule, and approval by the MA faculty chair. Please be aware that new GSIs are required to take a pedagogy course, over and above the regular coursework of the MA program.\n\nTuition and Fees\n\nMA students typically cover expenses through a combination of student loans, private funds, and employer support (for those who are already in careers). Please refer to the information below regarding tuition, fees, and financial support.\n\nThe Office of the Registrar lists the tuition and fees schedule for MA students. (see \"Graduate: Professional - Graduate Division - Statistics\"). All tuition and fees are subject to change. The Student Health Insurance Plan is optional.\n\nLiving Expenses\n\nThe UC Berkeley Financial Aid Office currently estimates living expenses for graduate students for the upcoming academic year. This includes housing, utilities, food, books, supplies, personal, and transportation costs. Your expenses may be lower or higher depending on your lifestyle.\n\nAdditional Financial Resources"
