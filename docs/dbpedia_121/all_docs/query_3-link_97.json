        "text": "What is a financial analyst?\n\nFinancial analysts provide informed guidance to companies or individual investors on important business investment decisions by analyzing economic trends and current market conditions. They conduct research to inform strategy for their clients. To become a financial analyst, you must be comfortable working with data and using math to analyze it all.\n\nFinancial analysts can work for financial companies like banks or investment companies, or within businesses. They commonly have academic backgrounds in finance, economics, accounting, or statistics.Â It can be a fascinating and well-paid career if your skills align with a desire to pursue this field.\n\nWhat does a financial analyst do?\n\nFinancial analysts work with data to help organizations make business decisions. The specifics can vary, but typically a financial analyst is expected to perform the following tasks:\n\nBuild financial models to forecast trends and predict business scenarios and other data analysis to help make business decisions\n\nStudy economic and business trends, including stock and bond performance, to provide context around business decisions\n\nSupport budgeting efforts at organizations\n\nCompile written reports on financial statuses and recommendations\n\nFinancial analyst salary and job outlook\n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the average salary for a financial analyst is $95,570 a year [1]. This amount can vary based on your location, education, and experience.\n\nFinancial analysts are expected to be in demand in the years to come. The BLS estimates that the position will grow 9 percent from 2021 to 2031.\n\nTypes of financial analysts\n\nFinancial analysts are sometimes classified into two categories: buy-side analysts and sell-side analysts.Â\n\nBuy-side analysts create investment strategies for companies that purchase securities and other assets for money management. These companies, commonly called institutional investors, include mutual funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, independent money managers, and nonprofit organizations.Â\n\nSell-side analysts assist and provide guidance to financial services sales agents who sell stocks, bonds, and other investments.\n\nFinancial analyst skills\n\nFinancial analysts generally need to have the following skills to be successful:\n\nTechnical skills\n\nAccounting knowledge\n\nAnalytical skills\n\nFinancial literacy\n\nData analysis\n\nCorporate finance knowledge\n\nFinancial software knowledgeÂ\n\nBudget management training\n\nFinancial reporting skills\n\nResearch skills\n\nFinancial analysis skills\n\nWorkplace skills\n\nCommunication\n\nNegotiation and influencing\n\nCritical thinking\n\nFlexibility\n\nResilience\n\nCollaboration\n\nProblem-solving\n\nHow to become a financial analyst\n\nYouâll need to have the basic qualifications, such as experience, skills, and knowledge to succeed as a financial analyst. Here is a guide to embarking on this career path.\n\n1. Earn a degree.\n\nAn entry-level financial analyst typically has a degree, with 76 percent of professionals holding a bachelor's degree, and 16 percent holding a master's degree [2]. Acquiring a degree in finance, accounting, economics, or a related field can set you up for a career as a financial analyst. If you are looking for a wider scope of opportunity or a higher salary, getting your master's degree in finance or a master of business administration (MBA) may be helpful.\n\n2. Boost your skills with an online class.\n\nBolster your knowledge of a skill by taking a course.\n\nConsider the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate to sharpen your data analysis skills\n\nTake a specialization in Financial Skills from the University of Illinois\n\nLearn how to create Financial and Quantitative Models, a specialization designed for analysts, from UPenn Wharton\n\n3. Get a certification.\n\nSome companies prefer to hire financial analysts who have certifications from the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute. Analysts who want to work specifically in securities can also take its Series 7 and Series 63 exams from FINRA so you can be ready for any available roles.\n\n4. Gain work experience.\n\nApply for an internship with a company that matches your industry interest. Interning can give you experience, knowledge, and networking opportunities within the financial field to help you land a job afterwardâsometimes at the same company.\n\nEntry-level positions tend to be for analysts who are starting out or switching in their careers. If you're already in the job force, it may be tempting to move laterally, but it may be harder to land a job without the appropriate experience. Look for the following titles in your job search that generally indicate an entry-level position:\n\nJunior financial analyst\n\nAssociate financial analyst\n\n5. Prepare for your job search.\n\nSearch for open positions on job sites like LinkedIn and Indeed. Be prepared for interviews by anticipating questions and having potential answers prepared. Interview questions might include:\n\nWhat is your experience with data analysis?\n\nWhat do you do to stay informed about this industry?\n\nHow would you create a quarterly sales report?\n\nWhat would you do if you found an inconsistency in a financial report?\n\nWhat is EBITDA?\n\nDescribe a time you accomplished something as a team.\n\nFinancial analyst career paths\n\nThese careers can be viable options for people who have skills similar to financial analysts:Â\n\nPortfolio managersÂ study the market and work with other financial professionals to determine the best investment opportunities and decisions for a companyâs business portfolio. They have a deep understanding of current business trends, allowing them to better predict the future of the market. Portfolio managers use this knowledge to guide businesses and individuals in their investment decisions.\n\nFund managersÂ work primarily with hedge funds or mutual funds. They stay informed on the overall goals of the fund as well as market trends to help make sound decisions.\n\nRatings analystsÂ evaluate and assess the market and a companyâs financial abilities and strategies in order to make educated recommendations on how a company should proceed.\n\nRisk analystsÂ use a combination of both business and financial knowledge to assist companies in determining the amount of risk in possible investment decisions. They make recommendations based on their analysis findings and help track and minimize a companyâs financial loss. Risk analysts are often responsible for assessing and reporting asset losses, staying current on investment trends, and collecting and analyzing data.\n\nThe jobs above tend to be entry- or mid-senior level roles. As a financial analyst, you may advance to being a senior financial analyst if you manage analysts or interns and oversee larger projects. Then, you might rise to become a manager, director, and potentially, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO).\n\nStart advancing your skills today\n\nEnroll in the Financial Analysis - Skills for Success Specialization from the University of Illinois to explore whether this career is right for you.
