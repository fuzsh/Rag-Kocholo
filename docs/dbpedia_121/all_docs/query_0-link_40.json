The collaboration with member States and partner organizations has shaped the Conceptual Framework and the methodologies to measure IFFs.\n\nThis technical paper shares the results of the work carried out under the auspices of UNCTAD and UNODC as custodians of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 16.4.1 on the total value of inward and outward illicit financial flows with a particular focus on tax and commercial flows."
