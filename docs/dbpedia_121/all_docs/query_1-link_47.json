        "text": "Information on EMOS\n\nThe European Master in Official Statistics (EMOS) is a network of Master programmes providing post-graduate education in the area of official statistics at European level. EMOS is a joint project of universities and data producers in Europe.\n\nEMOS is a label awarded by the European Statistical in System Committee (ESSC) for four years, renewable upon continued fulfilment of EMOS requirements.\n\nIn the EMOS governance structure ESSC is the highest decision making body awarding the EMOS label to the Master programmes and appointing members to the EMOS Board. The Board assists the ESSC in developing the project, especially in awarding the EMOS label and in quality monitoring of the EMOS Master programmes. The EMOS Board is chaired by Eurostat and consists of 14 members representing both universities and producers of official statistics.\n\nThe network builds on existing and nationally accredited Master programmes which, in line with the EMOS learning outcomes, familiarise the graduates with the system of official statistics, production models, statistical methods and dissemination.\n\nEMOS labelled Master programmes also collaborate actively with the National Statistical Authorities, Institutes or other producers of official statistics for relevant master thesis topics and internships in the sphere of official statistics.\n\nProcedure and Criteria for awarding the EMOS label"
