        "text": "HI everyone,\n\nI'm new to these forums and have found it to be a pretty dauting task to sort through all the info provided.\n\nRight now I'm trying to decide between two programs I have been admitted to. A M.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at Georgetown, and a Masters in Financial Economics at Rotman, University of Toronto. I just finished my undergrad degree in economics and math.\n\nI want to get into trading, and am wondering what you would recommend to be the better program? The cost and length of the programs are essentially equivalent. With the Rotman program, there is room for elective courses in the actuarial science/stats and the math department, along with some good applied courses (Risk Modelling and Trading) at Rotman, and an econometrics and financial econometrics sequence. At Georgetown though, there is only one elective at the business school, along with a course in financial mathematics. At the same time, the Georgetown program will provide the better quantitatve background, with PDE, probability, numerical analysis courses, etc. I was in contact with a student there and he says the grads with a finance interest have done well getting interviews with hedge funds in NYC. One actually interened at NASA too which is pretty sweet.\n\nI guess another question that is (very) implicit in what I have written above, is wheter there is a career in trading for financial economics graduates, or in the next few years, will everything be algorithmic trading that requires a more quant background?\n\nThanks a lot, anything is appreciated.\n\nLTCM,\n\nI actually stumbled into a very similar problem just yesterday. My stats professor extended an invite to consider the Statistics graduate program, and I believe he's going to offer me a TA-ship, which is something I don't have in FinMath program I was accepted into.\n\nI am seriously considering making the switch, although I, too would be very interested to hear some comments regarding this matter.\n\nWhen do you have to make your decision by?\n\nI actually sent in a deposit for the masters in financial economics at Toronto a month ago, but the more I read online, the more convinced I am that the math/stats M.S. would be the better choice. The major problem I am having is, as I said, that of the 9 courses I would take for the MS, only 2 would have anything to do with finance.\n\nYou seem to be in a good spot though with the financial math program - it's a perfect mix. Which school? Florida for both? I didn't have time to write the GRE so couldn't apply to a lot of programs deadline.\n\nLTCM,\n\nMy predicament is as follows:\n\nFSU Financial Math Program, sticker price\n\n-OR-\n\nFSU Applied Statistics Program, $24000 TA-Ship (2yr) plus full tuition waiver.\n\nNeither provides reliable placement, HOWEVER, I found out today that the dean of the Finance department at FSU, with whom I have been meeting regularly for the past year or so to discuss taking upper level finance classes (because I am not in the major, so he has to personally add me) is the \"go-to\" guy for internships and recruiters. Basically, he is my \"in\" in the financial networking department.\n\nAt this point, I am leaning very heavily toward the Stats Program. It even seems like they will be willing to let me start in the fall as an UNDERGRADUATE so that I can finish up my second bachelor's degree (Mathematics). This is basically a best-case scenario, and they are laying it all on the table right now.\n\nIn speaking with some people about the comparison, it seems like the Financial Math is certainly the more niche degree, as it is very specific for a certain type of job and therefore it is a tunneled curriculum which hones very specific skills. This is great if you are 100% sure you want to be a quant.\n\nThe Applied Statistics (or Math Statistics in your case) is more general, but is a much more inclusive degree. Personally, I want to work more in the business decision-making side rather than the programming side, and so I think my decision may be clearer than I am letting myself onto presently.\n\nI would look to meet with professors in either department you are applying if possible, or meet with professors at your school in analogous departments and hear their opinions. I think this will help you reach a decision more quickly.\n\nBest of luck and I would be interested to hear your decision when you make it.\n\nIn speaking with some people about the comparison, it seems like the Financial Math is certainly the more niche degree, as it is very specific for a certain type of job and therefore it is a tunneled curriculum which hones very specific skills. This is great if you are 100% sure you want to be a quant.\n\nAnd you know the jobs will be there and that you will be able to snag one of them. Otherwise, keep your options open -- as you seem to be doing. Even if financial engineering recruits fewer people, thee will still be a need in various sectors for experts in statistics, stochastic theory, PDEs, digitial signals processing, scientific computing, and numerical analysis. Why slam the door unnecessarily on these options by taking a degree that is simply too specialised, in an area with uncertain job prospects?\n\nIf you go to Statistics, try to stay close to the finance side. Learn as much as you can about econometrics, time series, and things like stat arb. Stats won't cover anything about pricing though. You will be on your own for that.\n\nAgree with Alain that stats won't teach anything about pricing. Also, since you majored in math, I assume you are familiar with rigorous proofs and theorems in certain pure math classes. I feel that anyone who survives and does well in these classes is able to learn stats fairly comfortably on his/her own.\n\nOn the other hand, pricing is not so straightforward and easy to learn by oneself because one not only needs to know the mathematical underpinnings but also needs to repeatedly get his/her hands dirty with the coding and implementation.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would choose the program that would enable me to learn the \"harder\" things like pricing and math in school and sacrifice the easier things which I can learn on my own later.\n\nThat is not to say all stats are relatively easy. Certain topics like Stochastic Differential Equations which fuses statistics, with real analysis and with differential equations is a rigorous mathematical subject in itself.\n\nAs far as I understand, there are many more job opportunities for people with a Stats degree than for those with Fin Math.\n\nIf you have a Ph.D., or even M.S., in Stats you can find jobs in finance. Yes, they won't involve pricing options, but might involve other things. At the same time you can also look for jobs in pharmaceutical industry, government, and academia.\n\nYou can do a Stats degree with some flavor of MFE (like Stochastic Calculus, C++, Portfolio Management, Financial Time Series). There are jobs in finance that don't require knowing how to price Bermudian options but require you to know factor analysis. So there is always an opportunity.\n\nalain and others,\n\nThe following is my prospective Applied Statistics program curriculum:\n\n[FONT=&quot]FALL 2008[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]STA 5166.
