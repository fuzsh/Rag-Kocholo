Now that yahoo finance appears to have removed their api, I need some code to scrape selected values from the key statistics page.

e.g. for url [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/IPX.L/key-statistics?p=IPX.L]

I wanted the values for "Trailing P/E" (14.68 as of today), "Book value per share (mrq)" (0.93 as of today) & the latest price & time of that (543.00 At close : 06:01PM BST as of now).

Have tried with rvest but can't seem to get there. Always seem to get empty results. Might be something to do with external pointers ?

If there's also a general solution, that would download all the key statistics into a dataframe with the relevant labels displayed on the url for each, that would be great too.

If you can help, that would be fab & would likely help many others too given the API removal.
