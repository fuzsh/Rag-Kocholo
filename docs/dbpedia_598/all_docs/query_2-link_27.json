        "text": "Year Built: 1910\n\nGeneral Information: The building was originally named for the Sanford family from the Courtenay, North Dakota, area, who were the major contributors to the building. It housed approximately 50 students and has served as both a men’s dormitory and a women’s dormitory. The dining room was in the basement from the time it was built until Voorhees Chapel was built in 1917. In the mid-1970s, the building was closed because of low enrollments and the poor condition of the building.\n\nThe building was completely renovated in 1976. Total cost for the renovation was less than $400,000, which was relatively inexpensive compared to a rejected plan to tear down Sanford Hall and build just a nursing building, with a government loan, costing more than $1 million. A historic building was saved, the campus circle was maintained, and 50% more space was created. The building was renamed to honor a major contributor and former Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Dr. Joseph Sorkness of Jamestown.\n\nIn 2016 renovations to the building were completed to house the Mechanical Engineering program. An addition was begun in the summer of 2018 to house the lab for that program. In addition to the Mechanical Engineering program, Sorkness houses the campus IT department.\n\nYear Build: 1913\n\nGeneral Information: This building was financed by the widow of Cyrus McCormick, inventor of the reaper, and named for Henry M. Taber, who was instrumental in reopening the College in 1909 as Chairman of the Board of Trustees. The building is currently a classroom building which also houses the College’s administrative offices.\n\nRenovation: In 2009, this building received a major facelift with the complete renovation of the lower level into a beautiful Admissions welcome center. The main floor is the home of the Business Office, Registrar, Provost, Development and Alumni Relations, and the President’s office. Classrooms continue to be housed on the third floor. The renovation was funded through a gift from Reuben and Clarice Liechty of Jamestown, ND.\n\nYear Built: 1923\n\nGeneral Information: This building was originally built as a memorial to the veterans of World War I. Construction was financed by general contributors. At the time of construction, it was one of the largest buildings of its type in North Dakota and contained the first indoor swimming pool in the state. Lack of seating, changing building codes, and condition of the building caused restricted use of the building in the mid 1970s.\n\nThere was a $750,000 renovation of Memorial Gymnasium in 1993. This renovation was funded primarily by Gordon ’44 and Charlotte ’44 Hansen of Jamestown. The building was therefore renamed the Hansen Center in their honor.\n\nIn 2018, Dr. Jo-Ida Hansen, daughter of Gordon and Charlotte Hansen, funded a renovation which created a student activity space featuring a game room, media room, and study areas.\n\nYear Built: 1930\n\nGeneral Information: This building was built upon the site where old main burned the same year. It is named for Mrs. Watson of Fargo who financed its construction. It was originally a men’s dormitory, later a women’s dormitory, and now men and women occupy alternating floors.\n\nRenovation: There was a major renovation to Watson Hall in 2014. One out of every three rooms was modified to convert the entire hall into a suite-style dorm with the center room being a common area for the outside two rooms. There was also an addition added to the building as an added common area.\n\nYear Built: 1934-35\n\nGeneral Information: The stadium was originally named Roosevelt Stadium, but later re-named for Frank B. Taylor, long time Dean of the College and a sports enthusiast. It was a Civilian Works Administration project of the depression years.\n\nRenovation: A major renovation of the stadium was made in 1985 with the assistance of the National Guard, the Jamestown Park Board, and friends. It included work on the east side to provide for eight running lanes all the way around the track, changing the track from 400 yards to 400 meters, installing a new composition running surface, and installing several composition surface jumping areas. The most recent renovation took place in 1999 for $700,000. This renovation included new grandstands, a new press box, a renovation of the track, and new retaining walls among other things.\n\nYear Built: 1941\n\nGeneral Information: Major funding for this building came from the Benjamin Orlady family. Mr. Orlady was a member of the Board of Trustees at the time. The lower level housed the Jimmie Grill and student union until Westminster Hall was built in 1960. In the 1950s, a campus radio station was also located in the lower level. The building continues to house biology, chemistry, math, and physics facilities.\n\nRenovation: The building underwent a $430,000 renovation in the summer of 1989. Relocated walls, new plumbing, wiring, heating, air conditioning, lighting, and furnishings, along with $106,000 in new instruments makes the facility outstanding for undergraduate science students. Financing came from a $122,500 grant from the Bush Foundation, $100,000 from the Mary (Orlady) Sorkness estate, $75,000 from the Burlington Northern Foundation, $10,000 from Norwest Banks, and generous gifts from Mr. Mel Arnold ’28 and others. In 2013, another renovation took place with an addition named McKenna Thielsch named after contributors. McKenna Thielsch houses nursing and science labs. Orlady contains classrooms and offices for nursing and science faculty in addition to conference rooms.\n\nBuilt During World War II\n\nGeneral Information: The building was built during World War II by the federal government, while Air Force cadets were training on campus. The federal government declared it surplus and it was given to the College in 1946. At first, the College used it as a student union and later converted it into the Little Theater. The Board of Trustees in 2005 voted to dismantle the Little Theater when the building became structurally unsound.\n\nStatus: The Little Theater was torn down in 2000.\n\nYear Built: 1959-60\n\nGeneral Information: This building originally housed the dining facilities, post office, bookstore, and Jimmie Grill on the first floor and the student union and chaplain’s office on the second floor. It currently houses the dining facilities.\n\nA renovation of the kitchen facilities took place in 1997 at a cost of $570,000. A renovation of the dining facilities took place in 2002. This was a $300,000 renovation which fully refurbished the dining room into a very elegant dining room. In 2014 another renovation took place in the dining room at a cost of $850,000.\n\nLead donors Ed ’63 and Elaine Nafus funded a renovation in 2007 with focal point of a two-story atrium entrance leading into an open commons area. In 2015, the upstairs area (formerly named L2) was renovated.\n\nThe building, formerly named Westminster Hall, was renamed Badal Nafus Center in 2018 to honor University President Robert Badal.\n\nYear Built: 1967\n\nGeneral Information: These buildings were built by an investor from Minneapolis named Andrews Allen as a private enterprise on the College’s property to house college students. The buildings were later purchased by the College. These facilities were the first on campus to vary dormitory design from several single or double rooms sharing bathroom facilities to mini-apartments where a family or four students have their own bathroom. Kitchens were included in some of the rooms as well. Wilson Hall was named for John Wilson, a 1926 graduate, former Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and generous donor. New Hall was later re-named for the Nierling family in the mid-90s for their long-time dedication to and support of Jamestown College.\n\nYear Built: 1972\n\nGeneral Information: This building was named for Carl and Harriet Raugust, members of the class of 1927 and major contributors to the library. The south roof line corresponds to the sloped roofs of the older buildings, while the north roof line corresponds to the flat roofs of the newer buildings. The library, while designed to primarily serve Jamestown College students, is also open to the public.\n\nIn 2018, the area on the lower level that previously housed classrooms was renovated into a student support area named the Student Success Center. The Center provides students with tutoring services, study groups, a writing lab, and study abroad and career services offices."
