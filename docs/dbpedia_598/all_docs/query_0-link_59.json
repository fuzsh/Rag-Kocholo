        "text": "Poland's defence strategy, known as Plan Zachód, was designed to protect its borders from any possible aggression by Germany.\n\nThe country's industrial and population centers were situated in the border region, particularly in Silesia, but the extensive length of the border made it exceedingly difficult to defend effectively.\n\nWhile some members of the Polish military and foreign advisors criticized the plan, politicians were hesitant to abandon such a significant portion of the population to the enemy without a fight.\n\nThe Germans, on the other hand, had a clear and decisive plan of attack, known as Fall Weiss. They aimed to commence hostilities before officially declaring war and to employ the Blitzkrieg strategy of lightning war.\n\nGerman units would invade Poland from three directions: the western Polish border, the exclave of East Prussia to the north, and the territory of Slovakia with the aid of Slovakian troops.\n\nAll three prongs of attack would converge on Warsaw, while the main Polish army would be encircled and annihilated west of the Vistula.\n\nThe Battle of the Border commenced at the crack of dawn, as German troops flooded across multiple points of the Polish border.\n\nThe first clash of the war is often attributed to the Battle of Westerplatte, which began with the thunderous salvos of SMS Schleswig-Holstein at 04:45, though some sources contend that the bombings of Polish airfields by Luftwaffe dive bombers a few minutes prior constituted the initial act of aggression.\n\nThe Tczew bridge bombing in the Polish Corridor, executed by Sturzkampfgeschwader 1, has also been identified by several historians as the opening move of the conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, a false flag operation known as Operation Himmler had already been underway for hours.\n\nAt 08:00 on 1 September, German forces, still without a formal declaration of war, launched an attack near the Polish town of Mokra, officially marking the beginning of the Battle of the Border.\n\nAs the day wore on, German troops advanced along Poland's western, southern, and northern borders, with German planes launching air raids on Polish cities.\n\nThe primary German assault came from the west, through the western Polish border, while a secondary route saw supporting attacks from East Prussia in the north.\n\nA third German-Slovak joint attack, carried out by units from the territory of the German-allied Slovakia, targeted the south. All three fronts converged on the Polish capital, Warsaw.\n\nPomorze, commanded by Władysław Bortnowski, who had been charged with defending the Polish Corridor.\n\nThough some units, like those under Admiral Józef Unrug, would continue to defend sections of the coast in battles such as Westerplatte, Gdynia, and Hel for a few more days or weeks, the rest were compelled to retreat alongside the Army Poznań under Tadeusz Kutrzeba from their positions in Greater Poland towards Kłodawa in Kujawy.\n\nTo the south and southwest, the German Army Group South, commanded by Gerd von Rundstedt, struck at the lines that separated the Polish Army Łódź, led by Juliusz Rómmel, from the Army Poznań in the north and the Army Kraków, commanded by Antoni Szylling, in the south.\n\nDespite several tactical victories for the Polish forces, such as at the Battle of Mokra on 1st September, they were ultimately compelled to withdraw.\n\nArmy Łódź was outflanked by the German Eighth Army and the German Tenth Army, while Army Kraków retreated from Silesia, and the Army Karpaty under Kazimierz Fabrycy was gradually pushed north towards the Dunajec and Nida Rivers by the German Fourteenth Army.\n\nThe Bombing of Wieluń on 1st September 1939, was the first air raid of World War II. German Luftwaffe bombers attacked the Polish town of Wieluń, killing an estimated 1,200 civilians and destroying nearly 75% of the town. The bombing was part of the German Invasion of Poland and marked the beginning of the war in Europe.\n\nThe Battle of Chojnice was fought on 1st September 1939, between German and Polish forces during the early stages of the German Invasion of Poland. The outnumbered Polish defenders fought bravely but were eventually overwhelmed by the superior firepower of the Germans. The battle resulted in the capture of the town of Chojnice by the Wehrmacht.\n\nThe Charge at Krojanty was a cavalry charge that took place on 1st September 1939, during the German Invasion of Poland. Polish cavalry units, under the command of Major Henryk Dobrzański, charged at German infantry positions near the village of Krojanty. The charge became a symbol of Polish courage and sacrifice during the war (although a myth also spread that Polish Cavalry had bravely charged German tanks – however, none were present at the battle.)"
