Father Antoni. Mother Helena née Hulanicka. A graduate of the Nikolaev Cavalry School in St. Petersburg and the Military Academy in Warsaw. Brigadier General of the Polish Army\n\n————————————————————————————\n\nHe was a great rider, soldier and great patriot. Poland did not exist on the map of Europe in the year he was born. He wanted to be a soldier, but he could only become one in the ranks of the Russian army, just like thousands of Poles in the Russian Empire. He began his education as a Cadet Corps midshipman at the Naval School, and eventually graduated from the Cavalry School. In 1912 he was a lieutenant, and from February 23, 1916, a captain.\n\nHe had been riding horses since he was a child, which influenced his choice of military specialty.\n\nHis greatest successes were both in the saddle, on horseback, and in creating conditions conducive to the development of Polish horse riding. This became possible only after the end of World War I. He fought there from August 12, 1914. He found himself in Poland in 1908 with the Ukrainian Hussar Regiment, which was stationed in Sierpc. There in the second lieutenant's quarters Sergiusz Zahorski the military police found a pro-independence blotter and accused him of helping an unknown fighter whom he hid in the attic. He avoided a court-martial, but in 1909 he was transferred to a reserve regiment in Novgorod. He used this time to improve his horse riding, which took him to the Olympic Games in Stockholm.\n\n(...)\n\nOn May 19, 1919, he was sent to America to collect horses. A short period of relative peace in the Eastern Borderlands of the Republic of Poland, colonel Sergiusz Zahorski also uses for sports. In April 1919, he was a member of the authorities of the Preparatory Committee for the Olympic Games, which were to be held in Antwerp from August 14 to September 12, 1920. And they did, but without Polish riders. Poland was fighting for its life against Russia.\n\nOn April 1, 1920, the Olympic Equestrian Group was established under the direction of lieutenant colonel Sergiusz Zahorski, deputy commander of the 1st Krechowiecki Uhlan Regiment. The management includes Major Karol Rómmel and Lieutenant Tadeusz Daszewski. Selected horses and riders were transported from Grudziądz to Warsaw. The riders were: lieutenant colonel Sergiusz Zahorski, Captain Stefan Dembiński, Captain Marek Mysłakowski, Lieutenant Bolesław Peretiatkowicz, Józef Trenkwald, Ignacy Sołtan, Trzasko-Jarzyński, Leśniewski, Adam Królikiewicz, Przewłocki, Adam Sokołowski, Ludwik Szwejcer, second lieutenants: Aleksander Bieliński, Stanisław Bukraba, Ryszard Bojankiewicz.\n\n(...)\n\nCommander of the 1st Uhlan Regiment until the end of the war in 1920. From 1922 to 1923, deputy commander of the 16th Uhlan Regiment. In recognition of his achievements and knowledge, he goes to a training course at the Military Academy. Hard work in the army allows him to ride horses every day. In terms of riding technique, he was a supporter, together with Major Karol Rómmel, of natural cavalry fought by Polish officers serving in the former Austrian army, trained at the Militär Reit Lehrer Institut in Vienna.\n\n(...)\n\nColonel Sergiusz Zahorski, as an Olympian in 1912 in Stockholm (together with Karol Rómmel), in the colors of Russia. He dreamed of becoming a Polish Olympian. It is to his credit that two Olympic groups were created preparing for the Games in Paris in 1924. One was in Grudziądz at the Central Cavalry School, and the other in Warsaw near Łazienki, based on the 1st Light Cavalry Regiment. In Warsaw, Colonel Zahorski rode mainly on Zorza.\n\n(...)\n\nIn 1926, colonel Sergiusz Zahorski accomplished a great feat - he led to the creation of the Temporary Committee for International Horse Competitions, which were organized until 1939 in Warsaw, in Łazienki, under the name of the Society of International and National Horse Competitions in Poland. Thanks was launched in the same year Sergiusz Zahorski preparatory work for the construction of a beautiful equestrian stadium in Łazienki. After the winter break, the work gained momentum and on May 27, 1927, the horses could start racing. Colonel Sergiusz Zahorski was from June 20, 1926 to September 21, 1928, the head of the Military Cabinet of the President of the Republic of Poland, Professor Ignacy Mościcki. Thanks to this position, he was able to provide invaluable service to Polish horse riding.\n\n(...)\n\nAuthor: Witold Duński\n\nSource: “Zahorski Sergiusz” (2012) – Witold Duński\n\nEntry updated: 02.05.2024/XNUMX/XNUMX\n\nSergiusz Zahorski died on June 4, 1962 at the age of 76.

Poles for whom the history of our country is inextricably linked with horse breeding and equestrian sports.\n\nBelow we present the introduction to the first issue of the weekly Jeździec i Hodowca from January 1, 1922:\n\n“By starting this publication, we do so in the belief that Polish sport and breeding have already reached the stage of creation, which requires a comprehensive exchange of ideas, critical illumination, and the establishment of the direction and goal of work, and this mediation must be fulfilled by a special body, the creation of which we are starting with the with all your energy. Although the Polish press, perfectly understanding the role of horse sport, has never spared space for all the symptoms of his life, it is our duty today to recognize the burden of the hospitable press, which faces the entire immeasurable area of ​​state life.\n\nOur publishing house is a timid, modest and tentative realization of ambitious dreams: by elevating horse sport to the dignity of a life phenomenon that plays an important role in it, and by dispelling the perfunctory, here and there still lingering opinions about the role - \"fun\" - of sport, to get closer to to Western beliefs in this direction, which placed sport among the most vital educational moments. These most correct beliefs are spread in Western societies through special bodies that enjoy great publishing power. They fulfill their informative, educational and propagating role in an unparalleled way, based on the experienced maturity of the belief that in the life of every nation, sport of any kind is not only a co-creative moment, not only a practical school of character, not only a high-ranking virtue, but that it is at the same time, one of the components of powerful social forces.\n\nThis is not the place to argue for the important role of sport; fortunately, the belief in this importance is becoming more and more widespread and the understanding of the historical role of the Olympic field and stadium arena is becoming more and more profound. The Olympic victor's wreath is one of the most noble and radiant symbols of human glory. The long educational work of special magazines among Western societies has had its effect; Our publishing house, dreaming of such great results, will try to do the same with noble persistence, according to its strength and resources. Often, enthusiasm and energy will have to replace resources, which will not obscure the clarity of our intentions. We are all in a period of hectic construction and foundation laying. And we are laying foundations on which a building may one day be built. We sow the first seed in the field we love with all our hearts. Maybe one day it will produce a rich harvest.\n\nOur modest intentions to serve in every possible way in the field to which this magazine will be devoted, still have in mind a living, contemporary and brilliant example: here is our previous work in the field of sports and breeding, scattered by the war, almost killed, trampled to the ground by the war storm. — she came back to life. Not by a miracle - but by an effort of will. A handful of people who understood that what they do, they do not for public fun, but for the benefit of the Homeland, convinced of the social value of their work, unearthed this work from the ruins, brought it to light and illuminated it. Thanks to this tireless effort, the Polish State is assured of one department of the national economy, standing on the European high: the horse breeding department.\n\nWe will devote our writing to the life of this noblest creature, this most faithful companion in Poland's war and misfortune, to his works and triumphs; a soldier's comrade from Sammossiery, Krechowiec, a participant of the heroic August days, is worthy of more than just a few praises and rhymes. He deserves a painstaking and urgent chronicle, like a patient farm register, which will be a collective document of experiences to be used by everyone who understands the role of the horse in the national farm. Breeding a Polish horse is one of the national commandments. The splendor of its history and, more importantly, the splendor of its future, will be the primary concern of all the words that will appear on these pages.\"\n\nAuthor: Editorial team of the weekly Jeździec i Hodowca.\n\nAll issues of Rider and Breeder have been digitized in cooperation with the Polish Horse Breeders' Association, BoberTeam, the Silesian Digital Library and the Cieszyn Library.

He was the son of Robert, a general of the Austrian army, and Hermina, Countess Fellner von Feldegg. (…)\n\nOn December 7, 1918, he joined the Polish Army and was assigned to the 8th Uhlan Regiment. Prince Józef Poniatowski in Krakow. In 1919, as a platoon commander, he fought against the Ukrainians on the Volhynian front, making bold and very dangerous raids against the overwhelming enemy forces, for which in January 1920 he was presented with the Virtuti Militari War Order. He participated in the Polish-Bolshevik war. He fought with Semyon Budyonny's Horse Army at Berestechko, Artasov and Komarov (August 31, 1920).\n\nHe commanded a squadron in the 1st Mounted Rifle Regiment, which in 1920 fought fierce battles with the Red Army. For his courage on the battlefields, he was twice awarded the Cross of Valor and the Silver Cross of Merit, the Bronze Medal of Valor, the Emperor Charles Cross, the Silver and Bronze Medal of Merit \"Signum Laudis\". In 1919 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and in 1924 - captain.\n\nJózef Trenkwald was a very good rider, and his superiors noticed his skills, qualifying him for the team preparing to participate in the Olympic Games in 1920. Poland was to make its international debut in Antwerp after 123 years of captivity. It was the first riding group that was established at the Central Riding School in Grudziądz based on the order of the General Inspector of Riding in April 1920. The organizers of the group were Lt. Col. Sergiusz Zahorski, Major Karol Rómmel (who took over the leadership) and Lt. Tadeusz Daszewski. In addition to Lieutenant Trenkwald, 14 other players were trained. However, the departure of Polish riders to the Olympic competitions did not take place because in mid-June 1920 the officers were sent to the Eastern Front and fought in the Polish-Bolshevik war.\n\nBefore the next Olympic Games in 1924, he was excluded from preparations due to a fracture of both bones of the left lower leg. In 1928, he received a third chance to compete in the Olympics. This time, no event interrupted the participation of the captain. Trenkwald in the Olympic competition. He qualified for the national team in eventing. The Concours Complet d'Equitation was held from August 8 to 12 in Hilversum near Amsterdam. After the first trial, in which the judges paid attention to the horse's exterior, the Poles placed only 17th place out of 46 teams taking part in the competition, but Captain Trenkwald on Lion's Claw took a high 12th place in the field of XNUMX riders. The field test significantly improved the position of the Polish team, which moved to third place, and the captain. Trenkwald was once again the best in the team. The last attempt at eventing, the show jumping competition was organized at the main Olympic stadium in Amsterdam. The parcours with XNUMX obstacles was overcome by Lion's Claw without any major problems and, ultimately, individually by Captain. Trenkwald took XNUMXth place. The remaining Poles won: XNUMXth place – captain. Antoniewicz and XXVI - Lt. Col. Rómmel, and in the team classification, the Poles won the Olympic bronze medal.\n\n(...)\n\nIn the years 1923-1939, Józef Trenkwald participated many times in international competitions in Poland and abroad. He took part in the prestigious Nations Cup competition three times, and twice he was in the national team that managed to win the trophy. It was in 1931, in June in Warsaw and in August in Riga. In both competitions he rode the mare Madzia. He also competed in the Polish Equestrian Championships held since 1931, standing on the podium three times. In 1931, in Warsaw, on his horse, Partyzant, he became the 1933nd vice-champion of Poland in eventing, in 1937 in Warsaw - on Madzia, he won the title of runner-up in eventing, and in 1935, in Gniezno - on Zwiahel, he won the title of XNUMXnd vice-champion of Poland in the show jumping competition. He was involved in horse riding not only practically, but also theoretically, being the author of numerous professional articles in specialist magazines and cavalry periodicals of the interwar period. In XNUMX, the Polish Equestrian Federation awarded him the Honorary Equestrian Badge for participating in the games and winning the Olympic bronze medal.\n\n(...)\n\nThe entire article and other sources can be found in the Polish Digital Equestrian Library (click)\n\nAuthor: Renata Urban\n\nEntry updated: 14.05.2024/XNUMX/XNUMX\n\nJoseph Trenkwald died November 19, 1956 in London.\n\nHe was buried in Brompton Cemetery in London.\n\nPosthumously promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n\nPublications in the Polish Digital Equestrian Library:\n\nClick on the links below to access related materials in the Polish Digital Equestrian Library (will open in a new tab):\n\n“Origin and activity of CWK in Grudziądz” (2022) – Renata Urban\n\n“Traditions of horse sports in Poland until 1939” (2022) – Renata Urban\n\n“One driving school, different fates” (2019) – Hanna Łysakowska\n\n“Józef Piotr Trenkwald” (2012) – Witold Duński\n\n“Józef Trenkwald – Olympian from Amsterdam 1928” (2012) – Renata Urban\n\n“Polish rider what was Grudziądz for Polish equestrian” (2002)\n\n“History of horse riding, part X” (1992) – Witold Domański\n\n“Reflections on the Polish Riding School” (1976)\n\n“Great Military Riding Schools.

He was the son of Tadeusz and Maria Przyborowska. He graduated from the Real School in Krakow, passing the high school leaving examination in 1909. In the years 1909-1910 he studied at the Vienna University of Technology, and then in the years 1910-1914 at the Agricultural University of Tabor in the Czech Republic, from which he graduated with an agronomist diploma.\n\nFrom August 1914 to October 1918, he served in the Austrian army. He participated in the First World War. In 1916, he was promoted to second lieutenant, and in 1918 - to lieutenant. On November 1, 1918, he joined the Polish Army. He was a professional soldier. In 1920, he was promoted to captain. During the Polish-Soviet War, he commanded a squadron of the 6th Uhlan Regiment.\n\nIn the interwar period, captain Kazimierz Rostwo-Suski served successively in the 6th and 4th Regiment of Uł., in the Cavalry Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, in the School of Professional Cavalry Non-Commissioned Officers in Jaworów (1929-1930), in the 6th Mounted Rifle Regiment in Żółkiew (1931-1935 ) and in 21st P. Uł. Nadwiślańskie in Równe, where he was deputy commander from 1936. In the opinion of his superior (Colonel Col. Adam Korytkowski), he was an officer of upright character, strong will, extremely hard-working, proactive, with great initiative; very intelligent, sharp and precise mind; tactically very good, completely prepared to command the regiment. During this time, he was promoted - in 1931 to major, and in 1937 - to lieutenant colonel. In the spring of 1939, he completed the regiment commanders' course in Rembertów, and on August 13, 1939, he took up the position of commander of the 21st Regiment Commander. In the opinion of Brig. Gen. Władysław Anders, Kazimierz Rostwo-Suski was an outstanding cavalry staff officer and an exemplary quartermaster.\n\nHe became interested in horse sports in the early 1921s. In 12, a Riding Club was established in Warsaw, which in the first days of June organized equestrian competitions on the horse racing track at Pola Mokotowskie. Twelve competitions were held then, and one of the main prizes was won by Captain. Kazimierz Rostwo-Suski on his horse Gogo. As a very good rider, in 1921 he was sent to a horse riding course at the Central Riding School (hereinafter referred to as CSJ) in Grudziądz, and in 1922 he qualified, together with the horses: General, Kleopatra and Qui Vive, for the Olympic group established in Warsaw at 1st Light Cavalry Regiment, led by Maj. Karol Rómmel. The second group led by Maj. Dymitr Exe and Lt. Leon Kon was established in Grudziądz at CSJ. In 1924, representatives of both groups took part in many international competitions, which were a test before the upcoming Olympic Games in Paris and were to ultimately determine the composition of the national team. Rtm. Rostwo-Suski participated in competitions in Nice, where he was part of the team that took 31th place in the Nations Cup on Generale, and in Lucerne, where Polish riders won a total of XNUMX awards.\n\nIn Poland's Olympic debut at the Games in Paris in 1924, he represented the national colors in eventing, held from July 21 to 26. 46 competitors from 13 countries took part in the competition, including 10 national teams. In the Polish team, apart from Rtm. Kazimierz Rostwo-Suski, who, due to an injury to his best horse General, started on the reserve Lady, also included: Lt. Col. K. Rómmel, Maj. T. Komorowski and Lt. K. Szosland. The competition was difficult, most of the Polish horses, shod by a French blacksmith, lost their shoes during the cross-country test, which did not have a positive impact on the course of the competition, but ultimately the entire team finished the cross country. On July 26, the last part of eventing took place - a show jumping competition. All the horses felt the hardships of the previous attempt and jumped reluctantly, but the Polish riders finished the competition intact. Ultimately, Kazimierz Rostwo-Suski was XXIV as the reserve Lady, the rest took the following places: X - K. Rómmel, XXIII - K. Szosland and XXVI - T. Komorowski.\n\n(...)\n\nThe entire article and other sources can be found in the Polish Digital Equestrian Library (click)\n\nAuthor: Renata Urban\n\nEntry updated: 07.11.2023/XNUMX/XNUMX\n\nKazimierz Suski de Rostwo died on March 9, 1974 in Kraków.

Members - founders of the Association were: Society of International and National Equestrian Competitions in Poland, Societies for the Encouragement of Horse Breeding: Lubelskie (Lublin), Małopolskie (Lviv), Piotrkowskie (Piotrków), Pomeranian (Grudziądz), Radomskie (Radom), Wielkopolskie (Poznań) , Vilnius (Vilnius) and Wołyńskie (Równe), Sports and Breeding Club in Grajewo, Kujawsko-Mazowieckie Sports Club (Włocławek), Krakow Horse Riding Club (Kraków), Polo-Club (Warsaw), Przemyśl Horse Riding Club (Przemyśl) , Equestrian Association \"Sport Equestrian\" of Horse Artillery Officers (Warsaw), Association of Horse Competitions of the Kielce Region (Kielce), Greater Poland Horse Riding Club (Poznań), Eastern Borderland Horse Riding Club (Baranowicze).\n\nThen the authorities were elected. Słk Zbigniew Brochwicz-Lewiński, then director of the Cavalry Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs (hereinafter: MSWojsk.), was appointed as the president. The function of vice-presidents was entrusted to Fryderyk Jurjewicz - director of the Department of Horse Breeding at the Ministry of Agriculture and Brig. Stanisław Sochaczewski, Lt. Col. Dipl. Tadeusz Machalski, and for the treasurer - patron Tadeusz Michalski. The board of PZJ also consisted of: Słk dypl. Wladyslaw Anders, hr. Józef Breza, Jerzy Ciechomski, Colonel Leon Dunin-Wolski, Capt. Leon Kon, General Robert Lamezan Sallins and Brig. Stanisław Skotnicki. After the death of Fryderyk Jurjewicz (1929), the position of vice-president was taken over by Eng. Jan Grabowski, director of the Horse Breeding Department.\n\nThe main objectives of the PZJ were:\n\n1) coordinating the activities of all societies promoting equestrian sport in its various forms, with the exception of horse racing, covered by the Act on Racing and Racing Rules; 2) unifying the classification and conditions of competitions;\n\n3) representing Polish horse riding abroad;\n\n4) preparation and organization of equestrian teams for the Olympic Games;\n\n5) joining the International Equestrian Federation (Fédération Equestre Internationale - FEI).\n\nThe implementation of these tasks was not easy and took time. Thus, no abrupt reforms were introduced that could disrupt the normal course of the annual competition. PZJ decided to act systematically and consistently.\n\nAuthor: Renata Urban, Equestrian sport in Poland in the years 1945-1989 (2013), pp. 31-32 (Chapter II - activities of the Polish Equestrian Association in the years 1928-1939).\n\nRead more...
