        "text": "He was born as Joseph von Unruh in Brandenburg, to an aristocratic family of General-Major of His Majesty’s Army of Prussia, Tadeusz Unrug and Countess Isadora von Bünau. The father, although he had served as an adjutant of Emperor William’s I brother for many years, never hid his Polish identity. Therefore, Józef was brought up in the Polish tradition. In his youth he was fascinated by adventure and travel books, which must have inspired him to take up studies in the Navy Academy in Kiln, where he stayed from 1904. In 1907, he was promoted to the officer’s rank. The outbreak of the First World War saw him on board Friedrich der Grosse – the flagship of the Emperor’s Navy. In the years 1915-1919, he served on submarines, among others, as the commander of one, then as the commander of a school for submarines crews and the commander of the submarines fleet.\n\nAfter Poland’s regaining independence in March 1919, upon his own request, he was released from the services. He came back to the country and after having been verified, joined the Polish Navy that was being formed (as one of merely six officers who had been connected with the German fleet). In 1920, he bought with his own money, the first Polish submarine – ORP Pomorzanin. He then held, among others, the function of the Chief of the Fleet Headquarters, working intensively on rebuilding the Navy. In 1923, upon his own request, he was moved to the reserves, yet as quickly as two years later, President Wojciechowski restored J. Unrug to the regular services, by nominating him the Commander of the Fleet in Gdynia. In 1932, he was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral, and six years later he was distinguished with the Commodore’s Cross of the Order of Restoration of Poland.\n\nIn August 1939, he took over the command over Defence of the Coast with its seat in Hel. From the beginning of the War, the post defended by the soldiers under his command was cut off from the rest of the country. Despite that the post was one of the longest-defending strongholds to offer resistance to the aggressor:\n\nWe have been the last defenders of the mother country. We have to keep our post till the last moment to demonstrate to the world that the Polish soldier, even in the hardest conditions, shall not give up an inch of his own land. The greatest sacrifices and the blood shed here will become a living testimony to our lasting at the Polish sea. Soldiers! The defence of Hel is not only a symbol, but also a regular soldier’s duty, which, at this moment, Poland requires us to perform, and which we must dedicate ourselves to fulfil.\n\n(Józef Unrug in September 1939)\n\nIt was not until there was no physical possibility to continue the defence (the overwhelming outnumbering of the enemy forces, lack of ammunition and food, the defeatist morale among the defenders) that the post capitulated on 2 October 1939. J. Unrug, together with his soldiers, was taken prisoner-of war. He was detained in seven different prisoner-of-war camps designed for officers (oflags): X B Nienburg, XVII C Spittal, II C Woldenberg, VIII B Silberberg, IV C Colditz, VIII E Johannisbrunn and VII A Murnau.\n\nHe felt strong solidarity with his companions in distress. When a column of his subordinates were to set out from the camp, during the assembly the Admiral, unexpectedly, joined his officers ready for departure and holding his suitcase in the hand announced that he was going with those he had been with during the defence of Hel. Germans, who in their consternation, respected his decision. With his authority and attitude he exerted a very strong influence on the inmates, keeping up discipline, a high level of the sense of dignity and honour, as well as the belief in the final victory. He demanded showing uncompromising attitude towards Germans, for instance, by refusing to shake hands with the latter. He also categorically forbid to run any talks with Germans, the indispensable official contacts ordered to be maintained by officers especially appointed by himself to do so. “I will always remember his straightened, elegant silhouette when he was strolling around the camp with the inseparable walking stick in his hand. I also remember and will so that the Rear Admiral was polite and kind towards co-prisoners and ostentatiously haughty and dry towards Germans,” Stefan Jellenta recollects. And Jerzy Młodziejewski adds “when Admiral Unrug went out to take a walk around the camp in the company of some commodores – there was some inexplicable majesty walking with them.”\n\nThe stay in seven prisoner-of-war camps did not break his strong character. He did not agree, among others, to receive special treatment offered to him by the German authorities due to his service in the Emperor’s Navy. At the beginning of the captivity he tried not to enter into conversations with German officers without Polish witnesses and an interpreter, although he knew the German language fluently. In the camps he read over 400 books in English and French, but not even one in German. He decidedly spurned offers of his release from the captivity, citizenship of the Third Reich and a post in the Kriegsmarine, whose status would correspond to his position. He resisted all temptations to accept any privileges and remained unyielding:\n\n- You have had your bet on a wrong horse, Admiral.\n\n- The race is not yet over, and I already know which horse will touch the finishing line the first, General – Unrug, in cold blood, replied through the interpreter.\n\n(An excerpt of the talk between General-Major Jesko von Puttkamer, the German commander of Oflag II C Woldenberg and Rear Admiral J. Unrug, held after an unsuccessful attempt to make the latter sign the Volkeslist)\n\nSuch attempts were also undertaken by an Admiral’s cousin of the German line of the Unruhs, yet the Admiral, talking to him in French, refused to comply in a decisive manner. From that moment he broke all his contacts with the German part of his family. In retaliation for his uncompromising approach he was transferred to a special camp with a stricter rigour Oflag VIII B Silberberg (Srebrna Góra). In the next one, in Colditz, due to an dishonourable conduct of the commander of the camp, the Admiral resigned from the function of Man of Confidence.\n\nHe was liberated by American troops from Oflag VII A Murnau in Bavaria on 29 April 1945. He did not want to return to the mother country ruled by the communists so he settled down in Great Britain, where he was active in the Management of the Navy of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. He was promoted to the rank of Vice-Admiral. Two years later he left for Morocco to do a contracted job, and in 1955 – settled down in France. He did not receive any old-age pension. He was buried in the cemetery in the French Montresor, having a handful of earth from Oksywie laid on his coffin, since he was not fortunate enough to be buried in the cemetery there, as he had wished. Despite his German roots and education, throughout his life, he remained a true Pole."
