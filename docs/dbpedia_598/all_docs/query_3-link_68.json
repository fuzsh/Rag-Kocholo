Mr. President, today I am submitting for the Record a study entitled ``Polish Armed Forces Contributions to Allied Victory in World War II.'' The study was prepared for the New Jersey Polish-American Congress and is an overview of Polish military and paramilitary activities dating from the Nazi invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, to the surrender of Nazi forces nearly 6 years later, on May 8, 1945. The study's author is retired Rear Adm. Sigmund Bajak, USNR. A member of the Polish-American Congress, Admiral Bajak is a veteran of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. He is currently completing a doctorate in Polish military history at the University of Warsaw. I hope my colleagues find this study informative. I ask that the full text of my statement, as well as the accompanying study appear in the Record. The study follows: Polish Armed Forces Contributions to Allied Victory in World War II (By Sigmund Bajak) Introduction: On May 8, 1945, when United States Army General Carl Spaatz, together with his Allied military colleagues, accepted the unconditional surrender of Germany in the Berlin suburb of Karlhorst the Polish Armed Forces numbered about 600,000. Of this total, 180,000 Polish soldiers were part of the 400,000-strong Soviet Army which conquered Berlin. The remainder of the Polish Forces served throughout the western front with the Allies. In addition to regular Polish Forces, hundreds of thousands of Poles fought in the Polish underground armies in Poland as well as in the occupied countries of Europe. In Poland itself there were four different underground armies numbering about 500,000 partisans of both sexes and all ages. They were: the Home Army, Peasant Battalions, the Peoples Army and the National Armed Forces. Son of Poland Pope John Paul II, on the 10th anniversary of his pontificate, said, ``In World War II, on every front, Poles shed their blood for independence. Polish independence cannot be measured in geopolitical terms, but only according to authentic criteria of national sovereignty in its own nation.'' It is necessary to elaborate on the participation of Poles in World War II, if only in the briefest terms, to truly understand Polish contributions to allied victory. What follows is a partial review of the efforts of Poles, in and out of uniform, as they fought from 1939 to 1945 for their independence and for the Allied cause. POLAND--SEPTEMBER 1939 Westerplatte (Located in the Baltic Port of Gdansk--a Free City): At 4 AM on September 1, 1939 the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein opened fire on the small Polish military transit depot, at Westerplatte. Major Henryk Sucharski, and his force of about 170 men held their ground for 7 days against overwhelming numbers of German ground troops before being forced to surrender. General Eberhadt, Commander of the German forces in Gdansk, refused to accept the Major's sword because of the uncommon bravery shown by the Polish garrison. The sword was later taken away from the Major at a German prison camp. Bzura River Counteroffensive (The Bzura River lies on a path Leczyca-Lowicz-Sochaczew, and joins the Vistula at Wyszogrod): On the evening of September 9, 1939, General Tadeusz Kutrzeba and his Polish Army of Poznan, located in northwest Poland, attacked the 4th, 8th and 10th German armies as they progressed eastward toward Warsaw. Kutrzeba was successful in delaying the Germans for two days before the Wermacht overwhelmed his forces. Kutrzeba's effort gave the Polish Warsaw and Lublin Armies time for reorganization after the initial German offensive. The Hel Peninsula (Located between the Bay of Gdansk and the Baltic Sea): Polish Admiral Jozef Unrug, a Pole of German heritage, did not surrender his command, located on the Hel peninsula, until October 2, 1939 four days after Warsaw was forced to capitulate. Before doing so he gave his staff permission to attempt escape by sea to Sweden. During the surrender a German trawler was sunk by one of the Admiral's mines. It's reported that the Admiral always insisted on a translator in the Germany prison camp because he said he was a Pole. Defense of Poland: The defense of Warsaw began on September 8, 1939. On the 17th of September the Red Army crossed the eastern borders of Poland and began its march toward Warsaw. Warsaw capitulated on September 28, 1939. German losses were about 45,000 killed and wounded. Poland lost 200,00 or more soldiers killed or wounded. The Germans took some 400,000 Polish soldiers prisoner and about 200,000 were taken by the Soviets. Another 85,000 soldiers were interned in Rumania, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania. Both the victorious Germans and Soviets murdered thousands of Polish prisoners of war. Probably the best known atrocity was the murder of more than 15,000 Police officers and men by the Soviets at Katyn forest. enigma--july 1939 During the period 1933-1938 three Polish mathematician- decryptologists managed to construct their version of a German Enigma code machine. These scientists, Messrs. Marian Rejewski, Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy Rozycki, successfully broke the German code. At the end of July 1939, the Polish General Staff turned over the Polish Enigmas and decoded German ciphers to France and Great Britain. In Britain, operation ``Magic'' made use of the Poles' findings at the Center of Decryptology located in Bletchley. All Enigma and operation ``Magic'' files have not been declassified. Despite this fact, there is no disagreement among historians as to the role the Enigmas, further developed and used by the Allies, had on the outcome of the war. polish army in france--1939 to 1940 On September 20, 1939, Polish General Wladyslaw Sikorski, who would become the Commander-in-Chief of all Polish Armed Forces, was appointed commander of all Polish forces in France by the exiled Polish government in France officially recognized by the Allies on September 30, 1939. On June 5, 1940 when the Germans attacked France, Sikorski had an army of about 82,000 soldiers. In view of the military situation on France, Sikorski and Polish President Raczkiewicz flew to London and met with Winston Churchill who was moved by the Poles determination to continue their fight against the enemy. On June 21, 1939 following the French defeat only 27,000 Polish officers and men were evacuated to Britain with the President of Poland who was welcomed by King George VI. tatra highlands rifle brigade in narvik, norway--spring 1940 When the Germans attacked Norway on April 9, 1940, the Tatra Brigade was sent to Norway as part of an Allied Expeditionary Force to take back Narvik from a strong German force. The attack was successful but in view of the situation in France, the Allies decided to evacuate the Expeditionary Force to Brest and the Tatra Brigade provided cover for the evaluation. Three Polish destroyers, Lightning, Storm and Thunder protected Polish passenger liners, Batory, Sobieski and Chrobry, which were used to transport the Force. Chrobry was sunk on May 16, 1940 in the vicinity of Bodo. The Tatra Brigade reached Brest but was disbanded after France fell. Some members of the Brigade who were able to flee French ports, with great difficulty, reached Scotland to resume the fight. carpathian rifle brigade in tobruk, libya--1941 to 1942 In August 1941 the Brigade, 4,683 strong and under cover of darkness, landed at Tobruk and eventually took up positions at the foot of Ras al-Medauar. Behind Ras al-Medauar were amassed 380 machine guns and another 110 guns of various sizes manned by crack German troops. On December 1, 1941 the Brigade attacked the German positions and at 1000 hours the red and white flag of the Polish Republic flew atop Ras al- Medauar. After the blockade of Tobruk, the Brigade took part in the counter-offensive of the British 8th Army. On the 15th of December they broke through the German-Italian lines at El Gazala. On March 24, 1942 the Brigade returned from the front to Egypt. polish armed forces on the western front from 1942 to 1945 General Maczek's Polish First Armored Division: The 1st Polish Armored Division led by General Stanislaw Maczek began organizing in England on February 25, 1942. It was made up of Poles who managed to flee from France, and Polish soldiers repatriated from the Soviets following Polish-Soviet negotiations which took place on July 30, 1941. At the end of July 1944, the Division was in France; it numbered 885 officers and about 15,000 men. Maczek and his Poles fought in the Falaise--Chambois--Mont Ormel region, breaking through the 1st SS Adolf Hitler Division and the 12th SS Hitlerjugend Division and taking almost 5,000 prisoners including one general and 150 officers. On September 28, 1944 the Division crossed the French- Belgian border and freed Ypres. Moving northward on October 27th they freed Breda, and the village made every member of the Division an honorary citizen. For the next five months the Division guarded the port of Antwerp in Belgium where the Allies shipped war supplies for the European campaign. In April, 1945, the Division was again in combat at the Kusten Canal and on May 4, 1945, participated in the attacks on Wilhelmshaven. The following day the German forces in this area surrendered. The total losses of the First Armored Division were 1,290 dead, 3,803 wounded and 585 missing as it fought for Polish independence and Allied victory. Polish Second Corps on the Italian Front--Monte Cassino, Ancona and Bologna: The Polish 2nd Corps was organized in 1943 from repatriated Polish soldiers who had been captured by the Soviets in 1939. The Corps was composed of 52,692 soldiers led by Polish General Wladyslaw Anders who reported to the British 8th Army Commander General Oliver Leese. General Leese ordered the Poles to take the Monte Cassino complex. The extremely bloody fighting began on May 11, 1944 and ended on May 19th when Monte Cassino was taken by the Poles. This forced the Germans to fall back from the Gustav line to the Hitler line of defense. The Polish losses included 4,290 killed, wounded and missing. British Marshal Alexander sent a signal to the Poles which said that if he had the opportunity to choose those he wanted to serve under his command, his choice would be the Poles of the 2nd Corps. The Marshal ended his signal with a salute of deep respect. Monte Cassino was only a warmup for the Polish 2nd Corps. The following month, June 15, 1944, the Corps was transferred to the Adriatic front. From that date to the first days of September the Corps advanced, fighting brilliantly, taking Ancona and breaking the northern German defense line near Pesaro. The Poles took about 4,000 German prisoners and more than 300 weapons of all types. They buried nearly 3,000 Germans. General Leese congratulated General Anders and his soldiers for conducting a most successful campaign. The Polish Corps moved slowly northward during the winter and early spring over difficult mountain terrain and in very bad rainy weather. By April 9th the Corps began its final thrust to Bologna. The way was mined and trapped. There were seven rivers to cross: Senio, Santerno, Sellustra, Sillaro, Giaino, Idice and Svena. On April 15, 1944 at 0600 hours the Poles entered Bologna following the American 5th Army which entered at 0800. The new British 8th Army Commander, General MacCreery, signalled General Anders: ``In your march on the Vis Emilia to Bologna you fought the 26th and 1st German armored divisions and four parachute divisions, some of the best in the German Army. In these operations you showed admirable fighting spirit, steadfastness and competence in battle. I send you and all your officers and men my warmest congratulations and expressions of admiration.'' The campaign on the Adriatic side of Italy cost the 2nd Polish Corps 2,300 killed, 8,00 wounded and 264 missing. Polish air force and the air battle of britain After the defeat of Poland, much of the Polish Air Force fled to France. During the invasion of France, Poles downed 56 German aircraft and damaged another 9. Polish losses were 26 killed which included 11 pilots. Following the capitulation of France, 986 officers and 3,217 men of the Polish Air Force managed to escape to England. In England, the Polish Air Force was organized into two fighter divisions--the 302 and 303--and two bomber divisions, the 300 and 301. After training conducted by the Royal Air Force (RAF), the Poles contributed to Allied victory in the Battle of Britain during the period August 8, to October 31, 1940. The score for Polish pilots was 203 enemy aircraft shot down, 35 probables, and 35 damaged. This was more than 25 percent of all the German air losses. The Poles lost 33 pilots out of a total of 131 who took part in the battle. polish navy 1939 to 1945 According to an agreement between Poland and Britain signed on November 19, 1939, what remained of the Polish Navy came under the command of the British Admiralty which also leased the Poles a number of ships. With this arrangement the Polish fleet numbered two cruisers, 10 destroyers, five submarines, 30 miscellaneous craft and 47 naval personnel units. The Polish fleet engaged the enemy 665 times sinking seven warships, two submarines, 339 transports and shooting down 20 enemy aircraft. Perhaps the most memorable of these engagements took place the night of May 26-27, 1941, when the Polish destroyer Lightning--as part of the 4th British Destroyer Flotilla--sighted and attacked the crippled German battleship Bismarck. The Bismarck was sunk on the morning of May 27th by the British Fleet. Polish Navy losses during the war were 404 killed and 191 wounded. The fleet lost 13 ships of all types, two submarines and 74,500 tons of shipping. the polish underground 1940 to 1945 HOME ARMY: The Home Army, otherwise known as the AK (an acronym for ``Armia Krajowa'') was by far the largest partisan organization in occupied Poland. On March 1, 1944, the AK numbered 389,129 soldiers. The Army conducted 1,175 recorded actions which included train derailments, burning of trains and the destruction of 38 bridges. In addition, the AK damaged 19,508 railroad cars, destroyed 1,167 containers of gasoline, burned 272 supply warehouses and damaged 4,326 vehicles of various types. German supply lines and communication points were constantly under attack. A number of Gestapo jails were broken into and almost 2,000 Gestapo agents were assassinated. PEOPLES ARMY: The communist dominated Peoples Army was formed on January 1, 1944 and was joined by the Peoples Guards which created a partisan force of about 50,000 soldiers. The Army reported more than 1,550 actions which included 774 attacks on enemy transport and communications. There were 220 counterattacks against German terrorist activities and 190 sorties against the German military suply infra-structure. There were 370 battles recorded against the Wehrmacht and German Security Forces. OPERATION ``BURZA'' (STORM): In January 1944, plan Burza was executed. The AK in an effort to reclaim Polish territories attacked retreating German forces and bands of Ukrainian Nationalists alongside the Red Army. At first there was cooperation between the Poles and the Reds. But in less than three weeks of Operation Burza AK General Okulicki was forced to disband the AK because he had no choice. The Red Army disarmed the Poles and sent some to the Polish Army in Wolyn and interned a portion in Vilno. The remainder were arrested and sent to camps in the USSR. About 200,000 members of the Home Army, including some 50,000 soldiers were deported to the east. WARSAW UPRISING ON AUGUST 1, 1944: The eastern battle front had moved very close to Warsaw by the summer of 1944. This encouraged the Home Army Command (AK), in concert with the Polish government in exile, to liberate Warsaw by attacking the German occupation forces. An attack was ordered and a catastrophe ensued. Promised supplies from the west by air drop never came. In the east, Stalin's armies, which included General Zygmunt Berling's Polish army, were not allowed by Stalin to cross the Vistula to support the uprising. More than 10,000 isurgents were killed, most of them young men and women. Nearly 7,000 were wounded and 5,000 were missing. More than 188,000 civilians were killed. Hitler personally ordered that survivors vacate the city and that the German Army destroy all of Warsaw. polish army in the ussr and the eastern front REPATRIATION OF POLISH ARMY: When Hitler attacked the USSR in June 1941 Stalin found himself on the side of the Allies. This opened the door to diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviets. On July 30, 1941, an agreement was reached between the Poles and the Soviets with the help of the British. General Sikorski met Stalin in Moscow December 3rd and 4th and discussed the repatriation of Polish prisoners of war in the custody of the Soviets and the freeing of Polish civilians. From January 13 to 25, 1942, the Polish Army was transferred from the various Soviet prison camps to southern asiatic republics in the USSR. Polish prisoners were held in far away Soviet camps under extremely difficult conditions. Thousands of Poles died in captivity. An accounting of Poles held prisoner was almost impossible and research concerning those that never returned from captivity continues to this day. Finally, by the summer of 1942 the Poles were evacuated to Persia in two groups. The final count was 115,742 persons. There were 78,470 soldiers and 32,272 civilians which included 12,733 war orphans. The repatriated Polish officers and men evacuated to Persia under the leadership of General Anders formed the 2nd Polish Corps which fought so well on the Italian front. POLISH ARMY IN THE USSR: In April of the following year, the Poles in London and the Soviets broke off diplomatic relations. For Poles who had not managed to leave the USSR with General Anders this was another opportunity to fight the Germans. In May 1943 the 1st Polish Infantry Division was formed in Sielce under the leadership of Colonel Zygmunt Berling. By October 1943 the formation was large enough to be designated the 1st Polish Army Corps. The baptism of battle for the 1st Polish Infantry occurred in the area of Lenino. Action against strong German forces began on October 12, 1943. The Poles showed a great will to fight and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. More than 1,500 Germans were killed and 329 taken prisoner. The Poles lost 502 killed, 1,776 wounded and 663 missing. The 1st Polish Army Corps by March 1944 had grown to the 1st Polish Army commanded by newly promoted, General Zygmunt Berling. At the end of April, the Poles joined Soviet armies at the White Russian (Belorussian) front. THREE POLISH ARMIES AND WARSAW: In the 1944 Soviet summer offensive the 1st Polish Army marched westward freeing Lublin on July 22, 1944. At this time, in accordance with a decree of the communist-controlled Polish National Freedom Committee in Poland, the 1st Polish Army and the underground Peoples Army were joined into one force under the command of General Michal Rola-Zymierski. Two more Polish armies were formed; The 2nd commanded by General Stanislaw Poplawski and the 3rd under General Karol Swierczewski. The armies marched westward and on September 14, 1944 General Berling with his 1st Army entered the Praga section of Warsaw located on the east side of the Vistula River. The Warsaw insurgents were still fighting the Germans in Zoliborz and Mokotow on the west side of the Vistula in city proper. The Polish armies remained on the east side of the Vistula until January 1945 when General Berling was relieved of the 1st command by General Poplawski and the 3rd Army was disbanded. This left General Swierczewski free to take command of Poplawski's 2nd Army. FROM THE VISTULA TO THE ODER: On January 14, 1945 the Soviets launched their great offensive from the Vistula to the west. By March the 1st Polish Army reached the Baltic in the vicinity of Kolobrzeg and by the 29th of March the Polish flag flew over Gdansk. The 2nd Polish Army after February operations in the Kutno-Lodz area reported to the Soviet commander of the Ukrainian front, and then marched westward to take part in the Berlin operation. POLISH FIRST AND SECOND ARMIES AND BERLIN: At the beginning of April 1945 both Polish armies reached a strength of about 390,000 soldiers. April 16, 1945, the 1st Army fought its way across the Oder and four days later was in pursuit of retreating German forces. On May 3, 1945 its troops reached the Elbe. The next day they joined with the American 9th Army in the outskirts of Berlin. The 2nd Artillery Brigade, the 6th Motorized Battalion and the 1st Infantry Division of the 1st Polish Army took part in the conquest of Berlin which took place on May 2, 1945. The Polish flag flew alongside the flag of the USSR over Berlin. The 2nd Polish Army spend most of its time fighting the stubborn German ``Mitte'' (Middle) Army which refused to surrender after the fall of Berlin. On May 7, 1945, five days after the fall of Berlin the 2nd Polish Army crossed the border into Czechoslovakia in pursuit of the Mitte Army. On the 11th, the Germans ceased fighting near Prague. polish war losses 1939-1945 The contributions of the Polish Armed Forces to Allied victory were never well known and are by now mostly forgotten. Poles contributed much as can be seen from the foregoing review. But the Polish nation also lost heavily and suffered terribly while making its contributions and while trying to survive under the oppressor. Hitler's aim was to exterminate not only the Jews but also Poles and their entire culture. Of all the Allies who fought, Poland suffered the greatest losses. It is estimated that Poland lost 220 out of every 1000 citizens during the war. By comparison the Soviets lost 124. The number for France was 13, Great Britain 8 and the United States 1.4. In addition to human losses, Poland suffered enormous material losses which in 1945 were estimated to be near 50 billion dollars. There was also the loss of an estimated 43% of all Polish art, national archival material and other historical and cultural treasures. It is appropriate to end this partial review by repeating the words of Pope John Paul II: ``In World War II, on every front, Poles shed their blood for independence. Polish independence cannot be measured in geopolitical terms, but only according to authentic criteria of national sovereignty in its own nation.'' NB.
