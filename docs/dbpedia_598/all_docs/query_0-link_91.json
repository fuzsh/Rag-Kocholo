        "text": "From eugenics to lysenkoism: the evolution of StanisÅaw Skowron.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDejong-Lambert, William\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThis article describes the relationship between Polish geneticist StanisÅaw Skowron's views on eugenics during the interwar period, his experiences in Nazi concentration camps during World War II, and his response to Trofim D. Lysenko's ban on genetic research in Soviet-allied states after 1948. Skowron was educated at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow and received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation to study in the United States, Italy, Denmark, and Great Britain from 1924 to 1926. His exposure to research being conducted outside of Poland made him an important figure in Polish genetics. During this time Skowron also began to believe that an understanding of biological principles of heredity could play an important role in improving Polish society and became a supporter of eugenics. In 1939 he was arrested along with other faculty members at the Jagiellonian and sent to Sachsenhausen and Dachau. In 1947 he published the first book updating Polish biologists on recent developments in genetics; however, after learning of the outcome of the 1948 session of the Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Moscow, Skowron emerged as on of the most vocal advocates for Michurinism. I argue that Skowron's conversion to Lysenkoism was motivated by more than fear or opportunism, and is better understood as the product of his need to rationalize his own support for a theory he could not possibly have believed was correct.\n\nAndrzej Soltan 1897-1959.

In two experiments, participants completed a Zhong-Yong Thinking Style Scale and performed a redundant-target detection task. Processing capacity was assessed with a nonparametric approach (systems factorial technology, SFT and a parametric (linear ballistic accumulator model, LBA approach. Results converged to suggest a positive correlation between Zhong-Yong tendency and processing capacity. High middle-way thinkers had larger processing capacity in multiple-signal processing compared with low middle-way thinkers, indicating that they processed information more efficiently and in an integrated fashion. Zhong-Yong tendency positively correlates with the processing capacity. These findings suggest that the individual differences in processing capacity can account for the reasons why high middle-way thinkers tend to adopt a global and flexible processing strategy to deal with the external world. Furthermore, the influence of culturally dictated thinking style on cognition can be revealed in a perception task.\n\nCorrespondence regarding Zhong et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2013 Mar 7;14:89.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKuhn, Alexandre\n\n2014-11-28\n\nComputational expression deconvolution aims to estimate the contribution of individual cell populations to expression profiles measured in samples of heterogeneous composition. Zhong et al. recently proposed Digital Sorting Algorithm (BMC Bioinformatics 2013 Mar 7;14:89) and showed that they could accurately estimate population-specific expression levels and expression differences between two populations. They compared DSA with Population-Specific Expression Analysis (PSEA), a previous deconvolution method that we developed to detect expression changes occurring within the same population between two conditions (e.g. disease versus non-disease). However, Zhong et al. compared PSEA-derived specific expression levels across different cell populations. Specific expression levels obtained with PSEA cannot be directly compared across different populations as they are on a relative scale. They are accurate as we demonstrate by deconvolving the same dataset used by Zhong et al. and, importantly, allow for comparison of population-specific expression across conditions.\n\nÄ°kinci DÃ¼nya SavaÅÄ± SonrasÄ± Polonya SinemasÄ±nda MilliyetÃ§i MuhafazakÃ¢r Bir YÃ¶netmen: Andrzej Wajda / A Nationalist-Conservative Director in Polish Cinema After the Second World War: Andrzej Wajda\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSÃ¼leyman SIDAL\n\n2015-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Bu Ã§alÄ±Åma Polonya sinemasÄ±nÄ±n dÃ¼nya Ã§apÄ±nda Ã¼n kazanmÄ±Å yÃ¶netmenlerinden biri olan Andrzej WajdaânÄ±n politik gÃ¶rÃ¼Ålerini gÃ¶zden geÃ§irmeyi amaÃ§lamaktadÄ±r.

I analyze Wajdaâs films, Danton, Les Possedes and Katyn in order to understand his nationalist and conservative attitude. First, I briefly evaluate the meaning of nationalism and conservatism, and then consider his life story and filmography. Yet, I mainly concentrate on those films Danton, Les Possedes and Katyn in the context of the relationship between nationalism and conservatism. Basic argument of the article is that Andrzej Wajda has a nationalist and conservative political tendency which stands against both Nazism and Socialism, and the Enlightenment ideas which to some extend rooted in these ideologies.\n\nAndrzej Wajda : maailm kÃ¼ll teadis, aga ei hoolinud / Eda Post\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nPost, Eda, 1983-\n\n2008-01-01\n\nPoola filmi- ja teatrilavastaja Andrzej Wajda, kes pÃ¤lvis sel aastal president Toomas Hendrik Ilveselt Maarjamaa Risti III klassi teenetemÃ¤rgi.

Moreover, it discusses signiï¬cant relations between Interactive Granular Computing (IGrC) and numerous dynamically developing scientiï¬c domains worldwide, along with features characteristic of the authorâs approach to IGrC. The results presented are a continuation and elaboration of various aspects of Wisdom Technology, initiated and developed in cooperation with Professor Andrzej Skowron. Based on the empirical findings from these projects, the author explores the following areas: (a) understanding the causes of the theory and practice gap problem (TPGP) in complex systems engineering (CSE);(b) generalizing computing models of complex adaptive systems (CAS) (in particular, natural computing models) by constructing an interactive granular computing (IGrC) model of networks of interrelated interacting complex granules (c-granules), belonging to a single agent and/or to a group of agents; (c) developing methodologies based ...\n\nJewish traits in Andrzej Bartâs works. A reconnaissance\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEmilia SÅomiÅska\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The article is an attempt at identifying Jewish traits in Andrzej Bartâs literary work and film documents. The Jewish elements tend to be unevenly distributed and include references to biographies of actual individuals, creating fictional figures, creating visions of real and/or fictional events enriched with symbolic dimensions. The Jewish theme is the core of the plot only in one of the novels (Fabryka muchoÅapek â The Flytrap Factory. The Jewish elements in Bartâs prose complement each other, or comment on each other, co-creating the writerâsÂ narration, and are rarely part of a workâs realistic representation. The elements have many roles to play: contextual reference, attempts to present the multi-ethnic structure of Polish society, tackling the subject of the Holocaust, or antisemitism and the difficult Polish âJewish relations. Bart tends to discuss this issue more frequently in his films, in the ZÅe miasto?

The Sancai (three layers) lifting and thrusting manipulation technique is adopted by Professor WU for getting the qi sensation. And features of 10 kinds of needling sensation such as soreness, numbness, heaviness, distension, pain, cold, hot, radiation, jumping and contracture are summarized. Finger force, amplitude, speed and time length are also taken as the basis of reinforcing and reducing manipulations. Moreover, examples are also given to explain the needling technique on some specific points which further embodies Professor WU's unique experiences and understandings on acupuncture.\n\nBetween Emotion and Intellect. On the Musical Language of Andrzej Panufnik (1914â1991\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBolesÅawska-Lewandowska Beata\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Andrzej Panufnikâs (1914-1991 key objective as a composer was to achieve a balance between emotion and intellect. The composer very often emphasised the role of the relation between these two elements in his works. This topic is the leitmotiv of texts about his own music left behind by the composer. From those texts, it is clearly evident that symmetry (and in later years also geometry played a central role in the composerâs formal concepts. The impulse for the study of the possibility of using geometric shapes for the construction of musical forms came from his 1972 composition for the BBC television entitled Triangles - for three flutes and three cellos.\n\nDu-Zhong (Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.) Cortex Extract Alleviates Lead Acetate-Induced Bone Loss in Rats.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nQi, Shanshan; Zheng, Hongxing; Chen, Chen; Jiang, Hai\n\n2018-05-09\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Du-Zhong cortex extract (DZCE) on lead acetate-induced bone loss in rats. Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: group I (control) was provided with distilled water. Group II (PbAc) received 500Â ppm lead acetate in drinking water for 60Â days. Group III (PbAc+DZCE) received 500Â ppm lead acetate in drinking water, and given intragastric DZCE (100Â mg/kg body weight) for 60Â days. Group IV (DZCE) was given intragastric DZCE (100Â mg/kg body weight) for 60Â days. The bone mineral density, serum biochemical markers, bone histomorphology, and bone marrow adipocyte parameters were analyzed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, biochemistry, histomorphometry, and histopathology, respectively. The results showed that the lumbar spine and femur bone mineral density was significantly decreased in PbAc group compared with the control (PâÂ 0.05, vs. control and DZCE group). Serum calcium and serum phosphorus in the PbAc+DZCE group were greater than that in the PbAc group (Pâcontrol group (Pâcontrol, and DZCE groups (Pâ>â0.05). Serum OPG and OPG/RANKL ration were significantly higher in the PbAc+DZCE group than that in the PbAc group (Pâcontrol group, but those were restored in the PbAc+DZCE groups. The bone marrow adipocyte number, percent adipocyte volume per tissue volume (AV/TV), and mean adipocyte diameter were significantly increased in the PbAc group compared to the control (Pâcontrol group were not significant. The results above indicate that the Du-Zhong cortex extract has protective effects on both stimulation of bone formation and suppression of bone resorption in lead-exposed rats, therefore, Du-Zhong cortex extract has the potential to prevent or treat osteoporosis resulting from lead expose.\n\nA Film Study of Loneliness. About âTatarakâ by Andrzej Wajda\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaÅgorzata Okupnik\n\n2014-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Andrzej Wajda has often taken up the topic of loneliness. In the screen adaptation of âTatarakâ (2009 he showed the loneliness of a married couple in the face of death and serious illness. The director used two stories: âTatarakâ by J. Iwaszkiewicz and âThe sudden callâ by S. Marai. The most important plot of the film is the private confession of the actress Krystyna Janda, who had recently lost her husband. In the analysis of the film by Wajda the philosophical concept mimesis may be used. Paul Ricoeur in âTime and Narrationâ claims that mimesis is not a homogeneous category and distinguishes three variations of it. Behind the three types of mimesis of âTatarak,â lie different meanings of loneliness. In mimesis III two worlds overlap: the world of the artist and the world of the audience. Jandaâs narration leads to an active understanding of what the experience of loss and loneliness is and crystallizes it. The story about loss and loneliness is also a form of therapy for her.\n\nAgnieszka, Antigone: The Antigone Myth in Andrzej Wajdaâs Katyn and in Dominik Smoleâs Antigona\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAndreja N. Inkret\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The article considers two modern works which employ the Antigone myth. The Polish film director Andrzej Wajda included several implicit allusions to the myth in hisÂ KatynÂ (2007,a film about the mass murder of Polish officers and intelligentsia â a Soviet crime which remained a taboo for almost half a century. On the other hand, Dominik Smole, a Slovenian playwright, wrote a play about Antigone (1960, which is set from beginning to end in ancient Thebes. It has been suggested that his play indirectly calls attention to the Slovenian post-war killings of the Slovenian Home Guard members, which were likewise long tabooed. Inquiring how the two works relate to SophoclesâÂ Antigone, the article points out that Andrzej Wajda seems inspired not only by Sophoclesâ ideas but also by his dramatic techniques. A scene that seems especially interesting in this respect presents Agnieszka (Antigone going to the theatre to sell her hair in order to buy a tombstone for her dead brother Piotr (Polyneikes. The action in the theatre is so full of metaphors and subtle imagery that it can be compared to one of the most compelling scenes in SophoclesâÂ AntigoneÂ (801â943. In the latter, Sophocles employs a popular ancient dramatic technique, incorporating ritual elements in the dramatic action in order to create an atmosphere rich in meanings and connotations. While Wajdaâs film includes at least two other scenes which seem directly inspired by the dramaturgical composition of Sophoclesâ tragedy, Dominik Smole does not appear to make much use of Sophoclean techniques. To both authors, however, Sophocles is a key reference for their characters, situations, and dilemmas; both the film and the play refer to the ancient tragedy either through similarities or differences established in relation to the ancientÂ Antigone. With regard to the differences, Smoleâs only newÂ persona dramatis, the page who survives Antigone as her devoted follower, appears to be\n\nâDo you think the end is close?â. Late-modernism, the spirit of cinema and Andrzej Wajda's âThe Weddingâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMiÅosz Stelmach\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The aim of the article is to place Andrzej Wajdaâs work from the early 1970s in the late-moderist trend developing in Polish film at that time. The best example of this is The Wedding (1972, which implements modernist strategies of subjectification, self-reflection and stylisation at the artistic and narrative level. The presence of ghosts in this film especially leads to a theoretical discussion on the spectral nature of the medium of film.\n\nAlteration of radiation-induced hematotoxicity by Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang in mouse\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJang, Jong Sik; Kim, Sung Ho\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study reported here was to investigate the ability of Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang (BZYQT), known to elevate hematopoietic functions, to protect mice undergoing treatment with whole body single gamma-irradiation.

[China University of Mining and Technology (China). Beijing Graduate School\n\n1994-12-01\n\nEmission of large amount of SO{sub 2} from combustion of high sulfur coal causes serious environmental pollution. Pre-combustion desulfurization of high sulfur coal has become a necessity. This paper reports test results of fine coal desulfurization with different flotation technology and the effect of pyrite depressant. Test work showed that when the coal sample from Zhong Liang Shau was processed with a Free Jet Flotation Column its pyritic sulfur content was reduced from 3.08% to 0.84%, with 72.22% recovery of combustible matter in clean coal. The concept of Desulfurization Efficiency Index E{sub ds} for comprehensive evaluation of desulfurization process is proposed, which is defined as the product of the ratio of sulfur content reduction of clean coal and the recovery of combustible matters. 6 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.\n\nGenoprotective effect of the Chinese herbal decoction xiao jian zhong tang.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSzeto, Yim-Tong; Cheng, Ngok-Fung; Pak, Sok-Cheon; Kalle, Wouter\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe Chinese herbal decoction formula Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (XJZT) is one of the classic formulas from the classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies on XJZT found that it is effective for treating peptic ulcer, irritable bowel syndrome, functional gastroenteritis and similar psychosomatic disorders of the digestive organs. It has also been shown that all the herbs used in XJZT contain antioxidants. In this study, we investigated the in vitro DNA protection effect of the individual herb extracts and the whole formula. Water extract of the herbs and XJZT were used to pre-treat human lymphocytes. The lymphocytes were then exposed to hydrogen peroxide. The in vitro DNA protection effect of the herbs was investigated by comet assay. No DNA protective effect (P < 0.05) was found for individual herb extracts, but XJZT showed protection of human lymphocytic DNA upon oxidative stress (P < 0.05). The in vitro DNA protection effect of XJZT was conferred by the synergistic effect of the herbs, while the individual herbs had no such effect.\n\nAutour de NikolaÃ¯Â Leskov et de WilliamÂ ShakespeareÂ : LadyÂ Macbeth sibÃ©rienne d'AndrzejÂ Wajda\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nGÃ©ry, Catherine\n\n2016-01-01\n\nLady Macbeth sibÃ©rienne dâAndrzejÂ Wajda est un film qui joue constamment de codes plus ou moins conflictuelsÂ : cinÃ©ma et thÃ©Ã¢tre (WilliamÂ Shakespeare), mais aussi cinÃ©ma et opÃ©ra (DmitriÂ Chostakovitch), cinÃ©ma et conte oralÂ (NikolaÃ¯Â Leskov).

The number of internal migrants were estimated at 245 million in China in 2013. Results were inconsistent in the literature about the relationship between their health statuses and social integration. The main difference exists on how to measure the social integration and whether health statuses of internal migrants improve with years of residence. To complement the existing literature, this study measured social integration more comprehensively and estimated the internal migrants' health statuses with varying years of residence, and explored the associations between the migrants' social integration and health. We used the data from 2014 Internal Migrant Dynamic Monitoring Survey of Health and Family Planning in ZhongShan, China. Health status was measured from four aspects: self-reported health, subjective well-being, perception of stress, mental health. We measured social integration through four dimensions: economy, social communication, acculturation, and self-identity. The analyses used multiple linear regressions to examine the associations between self-reported health, subjective well-being, and perception of stress, mental health and social integration. The analytical sample included 1,999 households of the internal migrants and 1,997 local registered households, who were permanent residents in ZhongShan. Among the internal migrants, Adults in the labor force, who were aged 25 to 44 years old, accounted for 91.2% of the internal migrant population, while 74.6% of the registered population were in that age group. Median residential time among migrants was 2.8 (1.3-6.2 years, and 20.2% of them were migrating in the same Guangdong province.

His native place is Putian, Fujian Province. Prof. XU has engaged for more than 40 years in clinical medicine since he was graduated from Shanxi Medical University in 1954. From 1958 to 1961, he was released from work to attend the TCM Learning Class for Doctors of Western Medicine for 3 years and granted the first grade prize by the Ministry of Health at graduation. Since then, the integration of traditional Chinese and western medicine (TCM-WM) has been the cause he devoted himself to. Now, he is Chief Doctor in Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, visiting professor of postgraduate education Department of China Academy of TCM, and Director of Specialty Committee of Respiratory Diseases, Chinese Association of Integration of Traditional and Western Medicine (CAIM).\n\nDiscussion of FAN Zhong-yanâs Buddhist Thought and Personality Spirit%è®ºèä»²æ·¹çä½ç¦ ææ³åå ¶äººæ ¼ç²¾ç¥\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\né¢ç½; è¡é\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFAN Zhong-yanâs life ambition is to make the monarch as wise as Yao and Shun.He begged the ancient heart of Habitat for Humanity in his âYueYang Tower Notesâ,ânot pleased,not to have com-passion,âthe implication was obvious Buddhist ideas with.The fusion of Confucianism and Buddhism thought of Fan Zhong-yan for the later generations to establish the âindependent personality model un-moved either by gain or lossâ.His life is spent in the pursuit and practice of Mahayana Bodhisattva âthe highest state of compassion for the world of visionâ,âbeing and not beingâin perfect unity.%èä»²æ·¹çä¸çå¿å¨è´åå°§èããå²³é³æ¥¼è®°ãä¸­ä»âå°æ±å¤ä»äººä¹å¿âï¼âä¸ä»¥ç©åï¼ä¸ä»¥å·±æ²âçææ³ä¿¨ç¶å¸¦æä½å®¶çæå³ãèååéææ³çèä»²æ·¹ä¸ºåæ¥çå£«äººæ ç«äºâå® è¾±ä¸æâçç¬ç«äººæ ¼å ¸èãä»çä¸çé½å¨è¿½æ±åè·µè¡å¤§ä¹è©è¨éâæ²å¿å®æ¿âçæé«å¢çï¼ä¸ºä¸äººè¯ éäºâææ ä¹å¢âçå®ç¾ç»ä¸ã\n\nImprovements to the Root Finding Algorithm in VBBinaryLensing\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHeintz, Tyler; Hoag, Ava; Bozza, Valerio; Oberst, Thomas\n\n2018-01-01\n\nVBBinaryLensing is the leading code for fitting magnification maps to microlensing events by binary lenses, most especially for exoplanet discoveries. The majority of the codeâs runtime is devoted to finding roots of a fifth order complex polynomial arising from the binary lens equation. This is currently accomplished via the ZROOTS subroutine, which employs Laguerreâs method. Skowron and Gouldâs (2012) algorithm, which employs a combination of Laguerreâs and Newtonâs methods, presents the possibility of faster runtimes. We introduce a C++ translation of Skowron and Gouldâs algorithm and test it as a replacement for ZROOTS in VBBinaryLensing. We find that this new implementation both reduces the time spent finding roots and makes the code more robust in extreme regimes.\n\nMain agronomic traits and resistance to rice blast of space-induced mutant lines of Zhong-er-ruan-zhan\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nXiao Wuming; Wang Hui; Liu Yongzhu; Guo Tao; Chen Zhiqiang; Yang Qiyun; Zhu Xiaoyuan\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe main agronomic traits and resistance to rice blast of 34 space-induced lines from an elite rice cultivar, Zhong-er-ruan-zhan were evaluated at their SP 4 . The resistance to blast of the mutant lines had been tested by two blast isolates previously. It was found that the mutant lines showed significant difference in plant height, effective panicles, panicle length and grains per panicle etc. from their parent. The range of variation in 1000-grain weight the largest, followed by the seed-setting rate, and that of effective panicles was the least among all the traits. Except for the line Z34, 33 mutant lines had broader resistance spectra than the wild-type based on the test with 38 different blast isolates, and all the 33 lines were also resistant to the panicle blast in the field. The result confirmed that selection for resistant to blast in lower generations was reliable. Taking account of agronomic traits and blast resistance, promising lines with resistance to blast and good agronomic characters could be selected from those mutant lines. Therefore, the elite rice germplasm with enhanced disease resistance can be produced.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has played a positive role in colorectal cancer treatment. There is a great need to establish effective herbal formula for colorectal cancer treatment. Based on TCM principles and clinical practices, we have established an eight herbs composed formula for colorectal cancer treatment, which is Teng-Long-Bu-Zhong-Tang (TLBZT). We have demonstrated the anticancer effects of TLBZT against colorectal carcinoma in vitro. In present study, we evaluated the anticancer potential of TLBZT, used alone or in combination with low dose of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu), in CT26 colon carcinoma in vivo. CT26 colon carcinoma was established in BALB/c mice and treated with TLBZT, 5-Fu, or TLBZT plus 5-Fu. The tumor volumes were observed. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Caspases activities were detected by colorimetric assay. Cell senescence was indentified by senescence Î²-galactosidase staining. Gene expression and angiogenesis was observed by immunohistochemistry or western blot. TLBZT significantly inhibited CT26 colon carcinoma growth. TLBZT elicited apoptosis in CT26 colon carcinoma, accompanied by Caspase-3, 8, and 9 activation and PARP cleavage, and downregulation of XIAP and Survivin. TLBZT also induced cell senescence in CT26 colon carcinoma, with concomitant upregulation of p16 and p21 and downregulation of RB phosphorylation. In addition, angiogenesis and VEGF expression in CT26 colon carcinoma was significantly inhibited by TLBZT treatment. Furthermore, TLBZT significantly enhanced anticancer effects of 5-Fu in CT26 colon carcinoma. TLBZT exhibited significantly anticancer effect, and enhanced the effects of 5-Fu in CT26 colon carcinoma, which may correlate with induction of apoptosis and cell senescence, and angiogenesis inhibition. The present study provides new insight into TCM approaches for colon cancer treatment that are worth of further study.\n\nJournal of Genetics | Indian Academy of Sciences\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nYu-Song Guo Zhong-Duo Wang Cheng-Zhong Yan Yu-Lan Zhang Jin-Nan Zheng Yuan-Min Xu Tao Du Chu-Wu Liu Â· More Details Fulltext PDF ...

I try to combine both usages. In fact, my approach to composing music is not so much - to develop a consistent language ready for use in multiple instances and thus to attain a recognisable personal style, but rather - to try to build a tool for use in one particular composition on many levels of musical âgrammarâ. Another basic problem is the proportion between impulse and design as defined in a well-known book by Andrzej Panufnik.\n\nOd teatru okrucieÅstwa do Grand Guignolu.

This study explored PD-L1 expression in ASCC patients and its association with patientsâ clinicopathological features, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and prognosis.Methods: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 26 patients with ASCC were retrieved. The levels of PD-L1 expression on the membrane of both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating mononuclear cells (TIMCs were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. CD8+ T cell densities, both within tumors and at the tumorâstromal interface, were also analyzed. Baseline clinicopathological characteristics, human papilloma virus (HPV status, and outcome data correlated with PD-L1-positive staining.Results: PD-L1 expression on tumor cells and TIMCs was observed in 46% and 50% of patients, respectively. Nineteen patients (73% were HPV positive, with 7 showing PD-L1-positive staining on tumor cells and 9 showing PD-L1-positive staining on TIMCs. Increasing CD8+ density within tumors, but not immune stroma, was significantly associated with decreased PD-L1 expression by both tumor cells and TIMCs (P=0.0043 and P=0.0007.

In the Baroque this co-operation was best revealed in monumental decorations inside churches. An example of it is the polychromy in the abbot church in JÄdrzejÃ³w, whose author was Andrzej RadwaÅski. Intention plan includes both theological content and issues connected with spirituality and activity of the Cistercian order. The history of the JÄdrzejÃ³w Abbey was particularly emphasized and so was the person of the Blessed Wincenty KadÅubek, who was connected with it. A correlation between historical and symbolical depictions is very interesting; a method often used by RadwaÅski in his monumental decorative painting.\n\nAuhinnad 2009 - Nike ja Gdynia / Hendrik Lindepuu\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nLindepuu, Hendrik, 1958-\n\n2009-01-01\n\nPoola tÃ¤htsaima kirjandusauhinna Nike sai 2009. aastal luuletaja Eugeniusz Tkaczyszyn-Dycki luulekogu \"Piosenka o zaleÅ¼noÅciach i uzaleÅ¼nieniach\" (\"Laul sÃµltuvusest ja sÃµltumusest\") eest.

The author examines documentaries on art and autobiographical film, which usually comprise glosses on feature films. These non-fiction films, like Wajda's best-known movies, refer to the codes of Polish culture, created by art and literature, and thanks to which the creative output of the maker of Afterimage (Powidoki appears to unusually coherent and consistent, regardless of the genealogical classification. The author selects examples to analyse the connections between Wajdaâs feature films and the conventions of the documentary. Wajdaâs overriding aim in using the poetics of documentary is in each case to undertake mise-en-abÃ®me reflections.\n\nPhenomenological theory of size effects in ultrafine ferroelectric particles (PbTiO3-type)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJiang, B.; Bursill, L.A.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nA new phenomenological model is proposed and discussed to study the size effects on phase transitions in PbTiO 3 -type ferroelectric particles. This model, by taking size effects on the phenomenological Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire coefficients into consideration, can successfully explain the size effects on Curie temperature, c/a ratio, thermal and dielectric properties of lead-titanate-type ferroelectric particles. Theoretical and experimental results for PbTiO 3 fine particles are also compared and discussed. The relationship between the current model and the model of Zhong et al (Phys. Rev.

Les deux sÃ©ries sont produites par le groupe de production X, dirigÃ© par Andrzej Wajda et connu au contraire pour ses films dâauteur du cinÃ©ma de lâinquiÃ©tude morale.

La sÃ©rialitÃ© permet-elle de penser autrement la rÃ©alitÃ© socialisteÂ ?In the seventies, the director of Polish Television launched the \"success propaganda\", an editorial line supposed to be the TV portrayal of the nation's economic modernisation. During that period the cult Polish series Middle-aged man [Czterdziestolatek] was produced. Ten years later, in the heat of the wartime period, another series had great success: John Heart [Jan Serce]. Both series were produced by the production group \"X\", headed by Andrzej Wajda, and were better known for producing independent films that were part and parcel of a cinema that expressed moral concern. How can this unexpected alliance between TV and the cinema be explained? Did the cinema-oriented producers influence the filmic grammar of the two series? Can cinematographers use the tools of TV series to express a socialist reality in a different way?\n\nGombrowicz a polski film fabularny\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJacek Nowakowski\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available This article presents the influence that Witold Gombrowiczâs work has had on Polish cinema.

The article shows that Polish cinema uses Gombrowiczâs works most of all by taking up the issue of lifeâs authenticity and inauthenticity as well as to demythologize Polish tradition and history. As for esthetics, it employs Gombrowiczâs favorite style, i.e. the grotesque.\n\n8 February 2017 - Sri Lanka Hon. Minister of Science, Technology and Research A. D. S.

While many books have addressed its various aspects, Nonlinear Optimization is the first comprehensive treatment that will allow graduate students and researchers to understand its modern ideas, principles, and methods within a reasonable time, but without sacrificing mathematical precision. Andrzej Ruszczynski, a leading expert in the optimization of nonlinear stochastic systems, integrates the theory and the methods of nonlinear optimization in a unified, clear, and mathematically rigorous fashion, with detailed and easy-to-follow proofs illustrated by numerous examples and figures. The book covers convex analysis, the theory of optimality conditions, duality theory, and numerical methods for solving unconstrained and constrained optimization problems.

Interest in health and quality of life is continuing to grow in the second decade of the 21st century, both among professionals actively involved in giving advice to others and among diverse social groups, as well as individually, among those sick and those healthy. Along with recent novelties, traditional Old Polish methods also feature prominently in discussions, but those interested know relatively little about how to access source materials. This letter therefore describes the possibilities for open access to Polish-language health guides from the Renaissance and Baroque era, whose authors included medical doctors and which focused on describing food and herbs used in self-treatment and promoting the healthy life style of the period. The works of Andrzej from Kobylin, Zawacki, Åleszkowski, Olszowski and Haur are briefly described and information is given about their availability in full-text on-line data bases.\n\nDetection of Heart Sounds in Children with and without Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension--Daubechies Wavelets Approach.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohamed Elgendi\n\nFull Text Available Automatic detection of the 1st (S1 and 2nd (S2 heart sounds is difficult, and existing algorithms are imprecise. We sought to develop a wavelet-based algorithm for the detection of S1 and S2 in children with and without pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH.Heart sounds were recorded at the second left intercostal space and the cardiac apex with a digital stethoscope simultaneously with pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP. We developed a Daubechies wavelet algorithm for the automatic detection of S1 and S2 using the wavelet coefficient 'D6' based on power spectral analysis. We compared our algorithm with four other Daubechies wavelet-based algorithms published by Liang, Kumar, Wang, and Zhong. We annotated S1 and S2 from an audiovisual examination of the phonocardiographic tracing by two trained cardiologists and the observation that in all subjects systole was shorter than diastole.We studied 22 subjects (9 males and 13 females, median age 6 years, range 0.25-19. Eleven subjects had a mean PAP < 25 mmHg. Eleven subjects had PAH with a mean PAP â¥ 25 mmHg. All subjects had a pulmonary artery wedge pressure â¤ 15 mmHg. The sensitivity (SE and positive predictivity (+P of our algorithm were 70% and 68%, respectively. In comparison, the SE and +P of Liang were 59% and 42%, Kumar 19% and 12%, Wang 50% and 45%, and Zhong 43% and 53%, respectively. Our algorithm demonstrated robustness and outperformed the other methods up to a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR of 10 dB. For all algorithms, detection errors arose from low-amplitude peaks, fast heart rates, low signal-to-noise ratio, and fixed thresholds.Our algorithm for the detection of S1 and S2 improves the performance of existing Daubechies-based algorithms and justifies the use of the wavelet coefficient 'D6' through power spectral analysis. Also, the robustness despite ambient noise may improve real world clinical performance.\n\nEffects of Post-harvest Storage Duration and Variety on Nutrient Digestibility and Energy Content Wheat in Finishing Pigs.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGuo, P P; Li, P L; Li, Z C; Stein, H H; Liu, L; Xia, T; Yang, Y Y; Ma, Y X\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis study was conducted to investigate the effects of post-harvest storage duration and wheat variety on the digestibility and energy content of new season wheat fed to finishing pigs. Two wheat varieties (Shi and Zhong) were harvested in 2013 and stored in the warehouse of the Fengning Pig Experimental Base at China Agricultural University for 3, 6, 9, or 12 mo. For each storage period, 12 barrows were placed in metabolism crates and allotted to diets containing 1 of the 2 wheat varieties in a randomized complete block design. The experimental diets contained 97.34% wheat and 2.66% of a vitamin and trace mineral premix. With an extension of storage duration from 3 mo to 12 mo, the gross energy (GE) and crude protein (CP) of the wheat decreased by 2.0% and 12.01%, respectively, while the concentration of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and starch content increased by 30.26%, 19.08%, and 2.46%, respectively. Total non-starch polysaccharide, total arabinose, total xylose and total mannose contents decreased by 46.27%, 45.80%, 41.71%, and 75.66%, respectively. However, there were no significant differences in the chemical composition between the two wheat varieties with the exception of ADF which was approximately 13.37% lower in Shi. With an extension of storage duration from 3 mo to 12 mo, the digestible energy (DE), metabolizable energy (ME) content and the apparent total tract digestibility of GE, CP, dry matter, organic matter, ether extract, ADF and metabolizability of energy in wheat decreased linearly (pdigestibility of NDF changed quadratically (pdigestibility (pdigestibility of variety Zhong was stable during 9 mo of storage, while the CP digestibility of variety Shi decreased (p<0.05). In conclusion, the GE, DE, and ME of wheat was stable during the first 3 to 6 mo of post-harvest storage, and decreased during the following 6 to 12 mo of storage under the conditions of this study.\n\nStudies on nitrogen uptake and utilization by rape (Brassica napus L.) under different sowing dates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLiu Qixin; Nie Guangming\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe nitrogen uptake and utilization by low erucic acid variety, Zhong You Di Gai No.2, of rape (Brassica napus L.) under different sowing dates were studied. Total N uptake, the percentage N derived from the fertilizer, the rate of utilization of nitrogenous fertilizer, the production efficiency of N-fertilizer (seed yield g/gN derived by rape plant from the fertilizer), total P uptake and the production efficiency of phosphorus (seed yield g/gP derived by rape plant from fertilizer and soil) were all significantly higher at early sowing than that at later sowing within the range of normal sowing dates. Therefore, the biomass yield, the seed yield and oil content all increased significantly at early sowing treatment, but erucic acid content showed no significant difference\n\nInvestigation on the hematopoietic effect of functional foods using radiation and preparing the provisional product\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKim, Sung Ho; Oh, Heon; Lee, Song Eun; Jeong, Yong Woon [Chonnam National University, Kwangju (Korea)\n\n1999-04-01\n\nWe performed this study to determine the effect of several oriental prescriptions as energy tonic (Chinese medical concept: Bu-Qi) or blood building (Chinese medical concept: Bu-Xie) decoction and its major ingredients on jejunal crypt survival, endogenous spleen colony formation, and apoptosis in jejunal crypt cells of mice irradiated with high and low dose of gamma-irradiation. For the study of evaluation on the biological stability of irradiated chinese medical prescriptions, we performed the experiment to determine the effect of irradiated (10kGy) or unirradiated Si-Wu-Tang, Bu-Zhong-Yi-Qi-Tang and San-Ling-Bai-Shu-San in irradiated mice. Further studies are needed to characterize better the protective nature of the total extract and its ingredients and for preparing the provisional product.

Literatura polska wobec eksterminacji osÃ³b psychicznie chorych\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nArkadiusz Morawiec\n\n2017-12-01\n\nFull Text Available The article concerns the theme of extermination of the mentally ill and handicapped in Polish literature. It outlines the basic facts regarding this crime perpetrated by the Nazis and indicates how Polish literature reacted to it. There are few works which deal with this crime. Writers (and historians probably considered the extermination of the mentally ill to be a fact of insignificance compared to other Nazi crimes, or knew little about it. Thus Polish literature treats it incidentally, by entering it in another, more extensive or âmore importantâ issue (the extermination of the Jews, the extermination of the Polish population, or treats it as an occasion to take up âmore fundamentalâ (ideological problems. The article analyzes famous works, StanisÅaw Lemâs novel Hospital of "
