Titles without attached PDFs may be read, by appointment, at the Museum. Items listed as Alexandria Archaeology Publications, a series of booklets and manuscripts published by the Museum, and photocopies of archaeological reports may also be ordered for a fee, by contacting the museum.\n\nResearchers should take into consideration that the breadth of this bibliography led to the inclusion of a number of outdated entries that do not reflect contemporary scholarship. Also, for those reports involving prehistory, it should be noted that the date ranges for the three traditional American Indian cultural periods (Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Woodland) vary in the reports. Archaeologists continue to develop a regional framework as new finds are made and thus further refine the date ranges. Alexandria Archaeology employs the following timeline: Paleo-Indian circa 11,000 - 7,500 BC, Archaic circa 7,500 - 1,000 BC, and Woodland circa 1,000 BC - 1600 AD.\n\nIf you know of additional titles, please contact us so that they may be added to the bibliography.\n\nHow to Find a Report\n\nThe bibliography is arranged alphabetically by author. If you are searching for a particular site, property name, or subject, select CTR/F on your keyboard and put your search term in the pop-up.\n\nYou can also search by location using the interactive Alexandria Archaeology Report Finder (AARF) map.

International Archaeological Consultants, Rawlins, Wyoming.\n\nStonegate Parcel C (American Indian tool-making area; possible slave/tenant residence; Civil War encampment), 4600 West Braddock Road.\n\nArchaeological survey and testing of the 13-acre project area revealed three periods of occupation. The discovery of a larger and, more importantly, undisturbed lithic assemblage indicated a longer or larger prehistoric occupation of Parcel C than adjacent Parcels A and B. The absence of building nails associated with the remains of the early to mid-19th-century residence pointed to either a house of log construction or the salvaging of materials for reuse. (Archaeologists noted the similarity to the Mark Center/Winkler Botanical Preserve slave/tenant residence, 44AX162 and 163.) Lastly, the few mid-19th-century artifacts were consistent with a Civil War-period encampment, perhaps associated with nearby Fort Ward. (Note: Researchers also should review the five other reports for Stonegate -- four prior and one later -- and the site report for Mark Center/Winkler Botanical Preserve [44AX162 and 163].)\n\n1996 - Report on R, F & P Potomac Yard – Track Relocation Project.

International Archaeological Consultants, Hayes, Virginia.\n\nPotomac Yard/Potomac Yard Center (residence; farm; cemetery; canal; rail yard; United States Military Railroad, Civil War).\n\nBefore developing the project area into a retail center, archaeologists assessed the former location of the Alexander family’s Preston plantation and cemetery, dating to the early 1700s, and the Alexandria Canal (1843–1887). The cemetery’s burials were moved to Pohick Church in 1922. The area was graded in 1933 to accommodate a rail yard, so the plantation and cemetery likely were leveled. The study area played a considerable role in rail transport. Its first line was completed in 1857, and used by the United States Military Railroad during the Civil War. By the turn of the 20th century, it contained probably the largest railway classification yard in the U.S. Unfortunately the area’s several uses were not visible in the highly disturbed soil. The historic topography had been removed through grading and filling so there were no cultural resources present. (Note: Researchers also should review the two other reports for Potomac Yard.)\n\n1994 - The Archaeological Investigation of the Undeveloped Upland Terraces in Mark Center, City of Alexandria, Virginia. International Archaeological Consultants, Rawlins, Wyoming. Public Summary\n\nMark Center/Winkler Botanical Preserve (American Indian tool-making site; slave/tenant residence), 1600 Beauregard Street, 44AX162 and 163.\n\nArchaeological survey and testing of the 62-acre upland terraces resulted in an American Indian tool-making site (44AX163) and a 19th-century historic site (44AX162). Investigation of the prehistoric site produced few artifacts and no features. Excavation of the historic site uncovered a structure, built circa 1800 and destroyed by fire by 1870. Analysis of ceramics, bottle and window glass, nails, and personal items and diet through faunal remains indicated that the occupants were probably enslaved or tenants of George Hunter Terrett, a large land-owner. (Note: Researchers also should review the three other reports for Mark Center—two prior and one later.)\n\n1993 - The Archaeological Investigations of Two Storm Drain Corridors at the Stonegate Development, Alexandria, Virginia. International Archaeological Consultants, Rawlins, Wyoming.\n\nStonegate Parcels A, B, and D (American Indian tool-making area; domestic area), 4600 West Braddock Road.\n\nArchaeologists explored two storm drain outfall corridors on 22 acres, discovering numerous lithic fragments as well as a small number of late 19th-century domestic materials such as ceramic, glass, and metal. The area contained no features and the soil was highly disturbed, making further excavation unnecessary prior to construction of the housing development. (Note: Researchers also should review the five later reports for Stonegate.)\n\n1991 - Archaeological Survey of the Proposed Upper and Lower Ponds at the Winkler Botanical Preserve, Alexandria, Virginia. International Archaeological Consultants, Rawlins, Wyoming.\n\nMark Center/Winkler Botanical Preserve Upper and Lower Ponds (possible American Indian tool-making area), 1600 Beauregard Street.\n\nIn surveying the project area, archaeologists unearthed one prehistoric artifact—a modified flake—and a few historic artifacts, including brick fragments and ceramic sherds. A previously registered site, 44AX12, lying partially within the survey area, yielded one lithic flake. (Note: Researchers also should review the three other site reports for Mark Center—one prior and two later.)\n\nAdams, Robert M.

The structural remains dated from the mid-19th century to the 1950s. Also discovered were three undisturbed Late Archaic lithic scatters, representing three separate tool-manufacturing activities, plus Woodland (or perhaps earlier) cultural deposits along the creek floodplain.

The area was divided into three units: Area A, Area B, and the Silver Leaf (Colored) Black Baptist Cemetery/African American Heritage Park (44AX136). Tellus completed a draft report on the cemetery and preliminary Phase II reports on blocks within Area A but no final reports. (A report on Area B was completed by another firm.) City archaeologists undertook an Area A summary. Area A included most of the land west of Holland Lane in Carlyle. In it were found prehistoric and historic deposits plus railroad features and a roundhouse. (Note: Researchers also should review the site reports for Silver Leaf (Colored) Black Baptist Cemetery/African American Heritage Park/Carlyle Project [44AX136], Alexandria Federal Courthouse [44AX164], Shuter’s Hill Brewery/Klein’s Brewery/Englehardt’s Brewery/Carlyle Project Area II-B [44AX35], United States Patent and Trademark Office/Carlyle Project Block F [44AX189], and Virginia Glass Company/Carlyle Project Block D [44AX181].

Archival evidence confirmed the establishment of a cemetery in 1885 by the Silver Leaf (Colored) Black Baptist organization. It then was buried under landfill in the early 1960s. A second phase of investigation by city archaeologists resulted in three graves, coffin fragments and hardware, and a portion of a man’s vest. Two other individuals were identified: Sarah Hunter and Julia Ann Washington. A third phase of investigation by the same firm that completed the initial phase led to the discovery of 28 burials, identified by grave shafts and coffin fragments and hardware, and shells placed above the graves—common in African American mortuary tradition. In addition, two more of the interred were named: Mary Rome and Matilda Gaines. (Note: This report is not final. It is an incomplete preliminary draft so there is some missing information and the map is not complete. Its inclusion here is a testament to the site’s importance.

Hull and Dennis Knepper\n\n1988 - A Phase IIA Archaeological Study, Old Ford Plant Site, Alexandria, Virginia. Appendices. Engineering-Science, Inc., Washington, D.C.\n\nKeith’s Wharf/Battery Cove/Ford’s Landing/“Old Ford Plant” (wharf; boat launch; shipyard; United States Military Railroad, Civil War, supply depot; coal yard; rail yard; automobile plant; gun factory), 600 block of South Union Street, 44AX119.\n\nA Phase I inquiry into this approximately 9.5-acre waterfront parcel laid out site history along with what archaeologists could expect to find plus how development would affect the archaeological resources. The project area consisted of made-land, filled between 1782 and 1785, creating a wharf that, at the time of inquiry, was composed of a parking lot, the 1932 Ford plant for automobile assembly and shipping, a boiler building, water tower, underground tanks, and a 1943 United States government building, constructed after 1942. (The Navy used the complex as an annex to its Piney Point, Maryland, gun factory.) In the early 19th century, “Keith’s Wharf,” as it was known, served as a commercial wharf for loading and discharging cargo. In the latter part of the 19th century, then again after the Civil War (until 1917), wharf activity consisted of shipbuilding and repair. During the war, the wharf served as the United States Military Railroad Depot. Beginning in 1880, the site also functioned as a coal yard. A rail yard prospered on site during World War I, facilitating industrial access to the waterfront and thereby supporting the shipping industry at Jones Point. Phase IIA testing uncovered large buried timbers associated with the 18th-century wharf, late 19th-century coal and coal residue deposits attributed to the coal yard, and 20th-century fill. Archaeologists recommended further fieldwork prior to development of the project area. The Phase IIB/C and III study of Keith’s Wharf and Battery Cove found remains of the bulkhead of the wharf, marine railway, shipway/building slip, eight derelict vessels, barges, and a keeled vessel, and artifacts, including some prehistoric, ceramic and wine bottle glass artifacts, nails, etc. The derelict vessels were recovered from Battery Cove, a shallow bay stretching from the southern edge of the wharf to the historic Jones Point, used as a dump during early 20th-century river dredging activities. The artifacts were considered incidental inclusion in fill, redeposited from the initial point of discard. The investigation resulted in an extensive site report, which offered much historical information, a reconstruction of Keith’s Wharf, analysis of its construction and comparison to other wharves on the East Coast, discussion of the use of fill to restructure the city landscape, look into wharf construction as a craft, and examination of the economics of wharf construction and operation.

Crowell and Jeff Parker\n\n1987 - The Alexandria Slave Pen: The Archaeology of Urban Captivity. Engineering-Science, Inc., Washington, D.C.\n\nFranklin and Armfield Slave Pen/Alexandria Hospital (residence; slave jail; Civil War soldiers’ prison; hospital; boarding house; tenant residence), 1315 and 1317 Duke Street, 44AX75.\n\nPre-construction archaeological research and excavation of the site, identified primarily as the Franklin and Armfield slave jail, documented five periods of occupation from 1812–1979, three of them transient. The site was first inhabited in 1812 by General Andrew Young. Archaeologists investigated the structures that served as his residence/office and kitchen, as they were still standing albeit significantly altered. Found at the interstate slave-trading complex (1828–1861) were architectural artifacts and features, including wells and postholes, but also a faunal object and a trash pit. During the Civil War (1861–1865), the property became a prison for Union soldiers. Archaeologists excavated a privy from this period. Pharmaceutical bottles, hypodermic needles, and a carpetbag date to the 1878–1885 use of the site as Alexandria Hospital. Lastly, from 1885–1979 there was a boarding house and apartments. The majority of the site’s artifacts date to this period. (Known as Freedom House, 1315 Duke St. is now one of the Historic Alexandria Museums.)\n\nB\n\nBaicy, Daniel\n\n2019 - Braddock Gateway.

John Milner Associates, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia.\n\n1226 North Pegram Street (possible slave/tenant residence; possible target practice or weapons discharge area, Civil War), 44AX198.\n\nResidential development on the 1.87-acre site spurred an archaeological inquiry. Finds dated to the late 18th–mid-19th century. Artifacts, three trash pits, and posthole likely corresponded to the Terrett family occupation period, though not to the Terretts themselves. Archaeologists cautiously associated these findings with a once nearby outbuilding or slave/tenant residence. The finding of a large number of buttons pointed to a laundry area. Other artifacts included ceramic sherds; bottle and window glass pieces; animal bone, brick, nail, oyster shell, and pipe fragments; and two possible prehistoric quartz flakes. A Civil War military artifact concentration primarily consisted of fired ammunition, suggesting that the area was used for target practice or discharging weapons by Union soldiers before returning to camp.\n\nBalicki, Joseph and Bryan Corle\n\n2006 - Archaeological Evaluation and Resource Management Plan for Episcopal High School Faculty Housing, 1200 Quaker Lane, Alexandria, Virginia. John Milner Associates, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia. Public Summary\n\nEpiscopal High School Faculty Housing (Civil War encampment) 1200 North Quaker Lane, 44AX200.\n\nBefore the construction of new faculty housing on the 0.67-acre high school property, archaeologists performed Phase I testing, finding a scatter of Civil War artifacts associated with a summer encampment but also earlier and later artifacts, too, ranging from the 18th through the early 20th century. Tests revealed disturbed stratigraphy due to plowing. The site also suffered from relic hunting. Yet fieldwork and metal detecting found: a 1774 Virginia halfpenny related to an unidentified 18th-century usage or occupation of the site as well as five coins ranging from 1837 to circa 1930; Civil War-era ammunition, uniform buttons, a shoulder scale attachment, canteen spout fragment, two gun cone protectors, and two pieces of carved or shaped lead plus two pieces of melted lead; ten non-military clothing artifacts, including three bearing Episcopal High School designations; and a pocket watch, pocket knife, and watch key. The project area lay within a larger site (44AX173), which encompassed the Virginia Theological Seminary and Episcopal High School. In June of 1861, the whole tract was commandeered by Union troops for a hospital, encampment, barracks, etc., explaining the presence of Civil War material in the project area. (Note: Researchers also should review the site report and inventory for Virginia Theological Seminary Faculty Housing [44AX173a].)\n\nBalicki, Joseph, Bryan Corle, Charles Goode and Lynn Jones\n\n2005 - Archaeological Investigations for Quaker Ridge Housing (44AX195), Alexandria, Virginia. John Milner Associates, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia. Public Summary\n\nQuaker Ridge (Civil War encampment and hospital), 3517–3543 Duke Street, 44AX195.\n\nFive residential lots on approximately 2.5 acres were to be redeveloped into townhouses, thus archaeologists were required to study the site. Civil War-era artifacts suggested the presence of a soldiers’ camp: ammunition, buttons, buckles, cap insignia, knapsack parts, shoe nails, and a decorated pipe bowl. Further supporting this were eight features: seven hearths (five probably kitchen-related and two probably for heating tents) and a remnant of a Crimean Oven, which would have heated the camp hospital tents. The Crimean Oven remnant resembled that found at site 44AX193 on N. Quaker Ln. Archaeologists identified the site as the autumn-of-1861 New York militia camp, potentially that of the 38th New York infantry regiment. (Note: Researchers also should review the reports for 206 North Quaker Lane [44AX193] and Weicking Property.)\n\nBalicki, Joseph, Bryan Corle and Kerri Holland\n\n2006 - Archaeological Testing (44AX199) 108 N.

Seifert\n\n2001 - Archeological Investigations at 1456 Duke Street (44AX188), Proposed Marriott Residence Inn, Alexandria, Virginia. John Milner Associates, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nDuke Street Tannery/Marriott Residence Inn (butchery/slaughterhouse; tannery; store; possible tenant residence), 1456 Duke Street, 44AX188.\n\nThe proposed erection of a Marriott Residence Inn prompted archaeologists to complete two phases of investigation: documentary study followed by excavation. The site’s location in the West End, an unincorporated community outside the city limits until its 1915 annexation, made it the prime location for slaughtering and tanning. The Duke Street Tannery/Tanyard operated from circa 1796 to the mid-19th century, burning down in 1853. Key to the development of the West End was the village’s location on Little River Turnpike (now Duke Street) and Hooff’s Run, a navigable waterway with access to Alexandria’s port (via Hunting Creek). Archival research confirmed that the site gave way to commercial and residential functions after its tanning days. A two-story frame store (1456 Duke St.) appeared in 1902 and 1921 maps; the 1921 map also showed an adjacent brick house thought to be the tenement illustrated on an 1845 map. Since the 1930s, the store structure sustained several additions and alterations, making the discovery of ground disturbance during excavation likely. Archaeologists found no significant artifacts or features. (Note: Researchers also should review the other site report for 44AX188.)\n\nBalicki, Joseph and Kirstin Falk\n\n2008 - Documentary Study for 3510-3618 Wheeler Avenue, Alexandria, Virginia. John Milner Associates, Inc.\n\n3510–3618 Wheeler Avenue (possible prehistoric area; possible Civil War encampment).\n\nA documentary study of the approximately 6.5 acres, which were to be redeveloped into a police facility, showed that they once contained a mid-19th-century structure, such as a barn or other outbuilding. The project area was likely occupied by American Indians and then by Federal troops during the Civil War, but 20th-century grading and other ground disturbing activities removed any trace of these occupations. No further work was advised.\n\nBalicki, Joseph F., Sarah Traum, Walton H.

But the landscape had been so altered that only sites 44AX103 and 44AX105 were recommended for further study. The Bontz site (103), in the former West End Village, encompassed the remains of two early to mid-19th-century residences. Site 105 contained a part of the Civil War-era United States Military Railroad complex, including a commissary and locomotive turnaround. Archaeologists suggested additional analysis to document the location’s pre-Civil War occupation.

Appendices - Public Summary\n\nBontz Site/West End Village, Spring Garden Farms/United States Military Railroad Complex (residence; butchery/slaughterhouse; farm; resort; rail yard; United States Military Railroad, Civil War, complex including commissary and locomotive turnaround), 1100–1900 Duke Street (specifically 1700 and 1200), 44AX103 and 105\n\nThis Phase III report cleared sites 44AX103 and 44AX105 for road-widening work. It included an extensive history of West End Village, with maps, and of the sites in the early 20th century. Archaeologists cited the narrow width of the construction zone and the area’s high degree of disturbance as their reasons for giving authorization. The Bontz site (103), in the former West End Village, encompassed the remains of two structures—both with a history spanning from the late 18th through the mid-20th century. Butchers occupied the structures and may have used one or both for business. Archaeological study turned up several sheet middens at the site and determined that there had been rear additions and renovations to the properties. Many lots in the West End were owned by butchers at this time. The well-preserved Civil War-era United States Military Railroad complex site (105) included a commissary and locomotive turnaround. Formerly the location comprised the Spring Garden Farms subdivision and resort. Then residential gave way to industrial use, which in turn was followed by the railroad. Threats of development prompted archaeologists to call for more fieldwork for the parts of sites not affected by roadwork.

One prehistoric quartz flake and a second piece of debitage -- both found in a disturbed context—represented the extent of the pre-20th-century material. 20th-century artifacts included ceramics, glass, nails, and coal, making an early 20th-century date for the house and outbuilding very likely. Archaeologists noted the possibility of a 19th-century structure existing under or within the 20th-century one.\n\n1993 - Maritime Archaeology at Keith's Wharf and Battery Cove (44AX119): Ford's Landing, Alexandria, Virginia Chapters I-VI - Chapters VII-X - Appendices Washington, D.C.\n\nKeith’s Wharf/Battery Cove/Ford’s Landing/“Old Ford Plant” (wharf; boat launch; shipyard; United States Military Railroad, Civil War, supply depot; coal yard; rail yard; automobile plant; gun factory), 600 block of South Union Street, 44AX119\n\nA Phase I inquiry into this approximately 9.5-acre waterfront parcel laid out site history along with what archaeologists could expect to find plus how development would affect the archaeological resources. The project area consisted of made-land, filled between 1782 and 1785, creating a wharf that, at the time of inquiry, was composed of a parking lot, the 1932 Ford plant for automobile assembly and shipping, a boiler building, water tower, underground tanks, and a 1943 United States government building, constructed after 1942. (The Navy used the complex as an annex to its Piney Point, Maryland, gun factory.) In the early 19th century, “Keith’s Wharf,” as it was known, served as a commercial wharf for loading and discharging cargo. In the latter part of the 19th century, then again after the Civil War (until 1917), wharf activity consisted of shipbuilding and repair. During the war, the wharf served as the United States Military Railroad Depot. Beginning in 1880, the site also functioned as a coal yard. A rail yard prospered on site during World War I, facilitating industrial access to the waterfront and thereby supporting the shipping industry at Jones Point. Phase IIA testing uncovered large buried timbers associated with the 18th-century wharf, late 19th-century coal and coal residue deposits attributed to the coal yard, and 20th-century fill. Archaeologists recommended further fieldwork prior to development of the project area. The Phase IIB/C and III study of Keith’s Wharf and Battery Cove found remains of the bulkhead of the wharf, marine railway, shipway/building slip, eight derelict vessels, barges, and a keeled vessel, and artifacts, including some prehistoric, ceramic and wine bottle glass artifacts, nails, etc. The derelict vessels were recovered from Battery Cove, a shallow bay stretching from the southern edge of the wharf to the historic Jones Point, used as a dump during early 20th-century river dredging activities. The artifacts were considered incidental inclusion in fill, redeposited from the initial point of discard. The investigation resulted in an extensive site report, which offered much historical information, a reconstruction of Keith’s Wharf, analysis of its construction and comparison to other wharves on the East Coast, discussion of the use of fill to restructure the city landscape, look into wharf construction as a craft, and examination of the economics of wharf construction and operation.

It fell into decline until 1974 when the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority preserved it to the period of John Carlyle’s lifetime (mid- to late 18th century) as a historic site within a public park. The NVRPA plan of action involved demolishing the mid-19th-century Mansion House Hotel on the property and remodeling the adjacent Bank of Alexandria. Demolishing the hotel brought the previously obscured house into view. The office and kitchen dependencies were demolished previously in 1855. This report detailed the house’s construction and design influences and offered a history of the property and house itself, including its remodelings and occupations. Results of the archaeological investigation included such features as well shafts and privies holding ceramics, glasswares, bottles, and other artifacts dating to or close to the lifetime of Carlyle. These emanated from both the house property and the Mansion House Hotel/Bank of Alexandria. A separate draft archaeological report presented a history of the site along with a study and catalogue of the artifacts.

John Milner Associates, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nBattery Heights (residence; battery of Civil War fort), 514 North Quaker Lane, 44AX186\n\nPrior to residential development of the approximately 1.6-acre site, archaeologists performed shovel tests and investigated the project area’s previously identified Civil War-era earthwork. Tests gleaned ceramic, glass, and metal fragments associated with the site’s residential past. An 1861 map showed four residences with the project area located between two of them. The ceramics suggested an initial presence in the area circa 1780–1840. The earthwork, dated to circa 1863 (if not before), represented one of the two batteries associated with the Union occupation of the Cooper family plantation, Cameron, also known as Cooper’s Hill and, by Union soldiers, Traitor’s Hill or Fort Traitor (44AX199). (Cameron was one of the four houses shown on the 1861 map, but not one of the two flanking the site.) Archaeologists attributed the absence of Civil War artifacts to relic hunting or the infrequent presence of troops in any numbers at the battery, characterized as an “unarmed fortification.” A line of earthworks ran southeast from this point to Fort Williams, though the existence of a rifle trench at this battery set it apart from others.\n\nFoss, Robert M.\n\n1974 - Excavations at Gadsby's Tavern, Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nGadsby’s Tavern (tavern; residence; hotel), 134 North Royal Street, 44AX2\n\nCharles and Ann Mason opened a tavern on site in 1752. In 1778, the property was divided into seven fronts on Royal Street, but, in 1792, they were reconsolidated for John Wise’s three-story structure. Then, in 1802, John Gadsby’s lease for a tavern called for him to erect a brick stable and dwelling house (outside the site) and to remove any wooden outbuildings in disrepair. In 1878, the American Legion wing was added to what was then the City Hotel. The several occupations and uses of the project area made sorting out the archaeological findings complicated. For example, the courtyard showed evidence of four structures: a brick footing dating to the 1750s, probably from one of the earliest outbuildings on the site; two additional brick footings, dating between 1796–1815, thought to represent an addition to the coach house; and a small section of brick walkway dating to after 1770. Archaeologists recommended exploring the rest of the courtyard prior to it being sealed with concrete. Also, the report called for creating an artifact inventory.\n\nFranz, Karl\n\n2011 - Phase 1 Archeological Survey for the Stream Restoration Project, Winkler Botanical Preserve, Alexandria, Virginia.

Area A was too highly disturbed to justify future survey. Additional disturbances included railroad rights-of-way through the property. This last known plantation site in the city was thought to have been built in 1763; it was destroyed by arson in 1977, when it functioned as the Holly Hill School. Following this preliminary investigation, archaeologists completed three phases of testing and excavation. Despite deep fill horizons, exposed were foundations, a brick walkway, front yard stairway, and midden -- the only in-situ deposit of the earliest phase of the main house’s occupation. (Note: Researchers also should review the other site report for 44AX111 and the report for Cameron Run/Eisenhower Avenue Valley.)\n\nGardner, William M., Gwen Hurst and Kimberly A.

Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia.\n\n118 King Street (wharf; commercial/industrial area; residence; possible inn or tavern)\n\nThree phases of archaeological investigation ascertained that the project area was originally in the crescent bay around which Alexandria was developed. John Fitzgerald and Valentine Peers made the south side of the 100 block of King Street by “banking out” from the bluffs. This block was commercial and residential. Despite the lack of context created by the watery environment archaeologists dated the numerous recovered artifacts from the late 18th to the early 19th century and characterized them as either refuse or representative of wharf activities, possibly even of a nearby inn or tavern. Found were sherds of pottery, glass bottles, tumblers, windowpanes, mortar, and wood; fragments of leather, brick, plaster, bone, teeth, pipes, and sheet iron; clam and oyster shell pieces; nails; a large oval-handled wash pan; flaked shale tool; and black English flint spall. Perhaps most interesting were the gaming stones, thought to be associated with a West African game, thereby suggesting the presence of slaves at the wharf. (Note: Researchers also should review the site report for Fitzgerald’s Wharf [44AX146]. For a more recent study, researchers should read “ Fitzgerald’s Warehouse: King and Union Streets ” by Diane Riker [2008], one of the Office of Historic Alexandria’s Studies of the Waterfront.)\n\nGardner, William M., Gwen J.

Public Summary\n\nStonegate Parcel C (American Indian tool-making site), 4600 West Braddock Road, 44AX176 and 177\n\nPhase III archaeological excavation at site 44AX177 yielded over 17,000 prehistoric artifacts. It was one of only a few intact prehistoric sites discovered at the time in Alexandria. The site represented four use periods, spanning from the Halifax phase at the end of the Middle Archaic (3600–2500 B.C.) to the Late Woodland (900–1700 A.D.) period, though remains dated primarily to the Holmes phase of the Late Archaic (1800–1200 B.C.) period. Additionally, archaeologists recovered 26 prehistoric artifacts from nearby site 44AX176, making it a peripheral activity area associated with 177. (Note: Researchers also should review the five other reports for Stonegate—three prior and two later.)\n\nGardner, William M., Kimberly A. Snyder, Tammy Bryant and Gwen J.

Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia.\n\nStonegate Parcel C (possible tenant residence; farm), 4600 West Braddock Road, 44AX177\n\nThe archaeological record in this Phase III exploration showed architectural and artifactual evidence of a residence dating to circa 1790–1830. The absence of finery among the ceramic and glass sherds and other cultural remains pointed to lower-middle- to middle-class occupants, probably tenant farmers of Ludwell Lee, Benjamin Dulany, or Thomas Watkins. This was further supported by the house’s log construction, as opposed to more expensive brick, supported by the deficiency of building nails. (Note: Researchers also should review the five earlier reports for Stonegate and the site report for Mark Center/Winkler Botanical Preserve [44AX162 and 163].)\n\n1995 - Phase II, Archeological Investigations of an Historic Area Within 44AX177, City of Alexandria, Virginia . Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia.\n\nStonegate Parcel C (American Indian tool-making site; possible tenant residence), 4600 West Braddock Road, 44AX177\n\nPhase II excavation unearthed the circa 1790–1830 residence, identified as a possible log structure. Archaeologists purported that tenants of Ludwell Lee, Benjamin Dulany, or Thomas Watkins lived there. Found at the site were: middens containing ceramic, glass, oyster shells, and other refuse, a possible summer kitchen, domestic artifacts, including some luxurious items like china, and numerous unrelated prehistoric lithics. (Note: Researchers also should review the five other reports for Stonegate - two prior and three later.)\n\nGardner, William M., Kimberly A. Snyder, and Gwen J.

Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia.\n\nVan Dorn Street Metro Station (residence; possible cemetery; railroad), 5651–5701 Eisenhower Avenue, 44AX178\n\nA Phase I study of these 11.5 acres discovered intact structural remains and refuse from a 1820s–1840s occupation. Architectural finds pointed to a large brick house, and expensive ceramics suggested fairly well-off inhabitants. The structure was razed, probably in the 1850s or 1860s, to make way for the railroad. An unused railroad bed, predating the Civil War, was found on site; archaeologists connected it to site 44AX54, lying just outside the project area. Phase II work was recommended to more fully investigate and preserve evidence and search for a possible cemetery. (Note: Researchers also should review the reports for Cameron Run/Eisenhower Avenue Valley and Eisenhower Avenue Earthwork Site/Van Dorn Street Metro Station [44AX54].)\n\nGardner, William M., Kimberly A.

Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia.\n\nSpring Garden/Old Town Village (possible prehistoric area; residence; farm; resort; Orange and Alexandria Railroad; United States Military Railroad, Civil War), 1000–1100 Duke Street\n\nArchaeologists expected to focus on the Civil War-era United States Military Railroad complex, but investigations resulted in five periods: prehistoric; 1690–1800; circa 1800 to early 1850s (Spring Garden and Orange and Alexandria Railroad); early 1850 to mid-1861 (military takeover of railroad); 1861–1865 (Civil War); and post-1865. Much of the project area’s topography was altered, but some major features were discovered: a circa 1805–1850 well, an octagonal United States Army Engineers privy, used during the Civil War and into the 1890s—the largest found to date in Alexandria—and the foundations of a pre-war house, which functioned as a hospital during the war. It contained some remarkably well-preserved artifacts, including fragments of fabric and leather. (Note: Researchers also should review the other report for Spring Garden and the reports for 1100–1900 Duke Street, including 44AX103 and 105, Fannon Petroleum Fuel Company, and Whole Foods/Royalton Project [44AX190].)\n\nGardner, William M. and Michael Clem\n\n2000 - Archeological Monitoring of Wall Construction at Christ Church, Alexandria, Virginia . Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia.\n\nChrist Church Churchyard Wall Reconstruction (Anglican/Church of England then Episcopal church; cemetery), 118 North Washington Street, 44AX88\n\nArchaeologists monitored the removal of masonry elements on site during the reconstruction of a portion of the east churchyard wall, and identified, mapped, and photographed 12 grave shafts in the area of construction. (Identification errors resulted in the destruction of human remains and the loss of data in nine graves.) Also found was a brick footing, most likely associated with an earlier wall or structure removed to make way for this wall in the 1820s. There was no evidence of a mass grave of Confederate soldiers, despite an on-site monument’s assertion that one existed within the project area. Archaeologists contended that burials lay outside the churchyard, under the sidewalk and probably the roadway, meaning potentially hundreds of unmarked burials. During the reconstruction of a portion of the north churchyard wall, four grave shafts and a French drain materialized. By the west wall, there were 33 graves, represented by coffin remains or grave shafts. Four of these held human remains. (Note: Researchers also should review the five other site reports for 44AX88—two prior and three later.)\n\nGeneral Services Administration\n\n1992 - Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement: Naval Systems Command Consolidation.

The former Seaport Inn and Restaurant, on the west side of the project area, was known as Fitzgerald’s Warehouse in the late 18th century and Irwin’s Warehouse in the 19th century. The site was a wharf this whole time. In 1877, there was a brick building on site. From 1885–1907, it functioned as a “Junk and Rags Warehouse” then, from 1907–1912, a second-hand store. It was vacant from 1921–1941. In 1958, records showed an empty lot so the building had been demolished by this time.

Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia. Public Summary\n\n1400 Janney’s Lane (residence; Civil War encampment), 44AX191\n\nLocated on property known as Stump Hill, Oak Hill, or Oak Grove, the approximately six-acre site served two primary purposes until its most recent use by the Second Presbyterian Church. Residential occupation began in 1832 with the construction of a house, though because of disuse the structure fell into disrepair. It was destroyed and a new house with outbuildings built in the 1850s. Yet another house went up in 1911. The site’s second function was as a Civil War-era encampment, well centered between Fort Williams, gun batteries, and rifle pits and directly adjacent to a hospital. The archaeological record revealed domestic artifacts like ceramic sherds, architectural fragments, food waste, and large amounts of coal and slag, speaking to the site’s first purpose. (Union camp refuse, that is, glass bottles, bullets, and metal hardware associated with military uniforms and equipment, also was found.) Also found was a brick foundation, probably belonging to either the 1832 or 1850s house, though the disturbed soils surrounding it prevented its dating. (Note: Researchers also should review the site report for 206 North Quaker Lane [44AX193].)\n\n2004 - Phase I – Phase III Archeological Investigations at 206 North Quaker Lane, Alexandria, Virginia . Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia. Public Summary\n\n206 North Quaker Lane (residence; farm; Civil War encampment and possible hospital), 44AX193\n\nTobacco importer Josiah Watson’s property, Stump Hill, was subdivided after he filed for bankruptcy in the late 1790s. Two roads were created through the property, providing access to the lots; one of these was today’s Quaker Lane. On the west of this thoroughfare lay the Cooper family plantation, Cameron, also known as Cooper’s Hill and, by Union soldiers, Traitor’s Hill or Fort Traitor (44AX199). Excavation here turned up a brick Crimean Oven, which likely would have heated the camp hospital tents. It was preserved, making it the only feature of its kind ever discovered. The feature resembled that found at the Quaker Ridge site on Duke Street (44AX195). Also discovered was 19th-century artifact scatter, including bottle glass fragments mostly from alcoholic beverage bottles, metal hardware associated with uniforms and equipment, munitions, ceramics, and architectural materials. The high proportion of refined versus utilitarian ceramics indicated higher status personnel, that is, officers. Archaeologists purported that the 38th New York infantry regiment camped here; they were stationed in the area in the winter of 1861. Archaeologists recommended no additional work due to extensive disturbance by relic hunters. (Note: Researchers also should review the reports for 1400 Janney’s Lane [44AX191], Quaker Ridge [44AX195], and Weicking Property.)\n\n2004 - Archeological Investigations at the Elliott House, 323 Fairfax Street, Alexandria, Virginia . Thunderbird Archeological Associates, Inc., Woodstock, Virginia. Public Summary\n\nElliot House (residence), 323 South Fairfax Street, 44AX192\n\nThe house was built by 1842, then occupied by the household of Charles Unruh, who sold it in 1855. It sustained various additions after its sale, though the main house was virtually untouched. The Old Presbyterian Meeting House, which took control of the property in 1979, planned to build a partly subterranean addition to the house, so archaeologists excavated in the rear and north yards prior to construction, discovering a number of features including a cistern and well, both dating to the Unruh occupation or earlier. The cistern apparently was abandoned long before the well; it was filled after 1848. Artifacts included food refuse, ceramics, bottle glass, glass tableware, chimney lamp glass, windowpane glass, nails, and personal items. The well was not abandoned and filled until after 1910. It contained bottle glass primarily, some ceramics and personal items, and large quantities of oyster shells and furnace/stove waste.\n\nJohn Cullinane Associates\n\n1988 - Historic Resources Assessment of the Old Ford Plant, Alexandria, Virginia . Washington, D.C.\n\nKeith’s Wharf/Battery Cove/Ford’s Landing/“Old Ford Plant” (automobile plant; gun factory; warehouse), 600 block of South Union Street, 44AX119\n\nThis architectural assessment provided a history of the site’s ten extant structures built after 1932 by Ford or the United States government (specifically the Navy) and recommended buildings for restoration and demolition. Ford occupied the project area from 1932–1942 with a plant designed by Albert Kahn for automobile assembly and shipping, a boiler building, water tower, and underground tanks. After buying the property from Ford in 1942, the U.S. government built an extension in 1943 and used the complex as an annex to its Piney Point, Maryland, gun factory. The Navy then constructed a “machinist shop” in the early 1950s. After 1960, the site functioned as a government warehouse facility until it was sold for private development in 1984.

West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nChrist Church (Anglican/Church of England then Episcopal church; cemetery), 118 North Washington Street, 44AX88\n\nThis Historic Structure Report of the “Church of Alexandria,” built in 1773 and attended by George Washington, offered a detailed discussion of the evolution of the building, modeled after an English village church by designer James Wren, and its surroundings, including cemetery, enclosures, and walks. The churchyard served many functions, housing a residence, library, vestry house, school, and fire company engine house through the years, but, in 1853, these buildings were replaced by a two-story brick parish house. During the Civil War, the church functioned while other city churches were appropriated for military (non-religious) purposes. The report examined the church in 1979 compared to its completion in 1773 plus all modifications, repairs, and improvements in between. Finally, the report laid out restoration and preservation objectives for the historic property. (Note: Researchers also should review the five other site reports for 44AX88—one prior and four later.)\n\n1978 - Christ Church, Alexandria, Churchyard Wall . West Chester, Pennsylvania.\n\nChrist Church Churchyard Wall (Anglican/Church of England then Episcopal church; cemetery), 118 North Washington Street, 44AX88\n\nChrist Church was completed in 1773, with its earliest burials taking place by that time. It adhered to the model of an English village church. By 1809, most burials were banned, both for sanitation and space concerns. Before 1787, the churchyard was not enclosed, but was by 1806. Then, from 1829–1830, a wall and railing with an entrance gate went up along the public, or south, side. The church fenced the north and west sides in 1844 with board fencing; this was repaired after the war then kept up through three quarters of the 19th century. In 1898, a masonry and iron fence was erected. This documentary report advocated for archaeological fieldwork on site in an attempt to find the earliest churchyard enclosures. (Note: Researchers also should review the five later site reports for 44AX88.)\n\nJohnson, Edward and John Mullen\n\n2008 - Results of Construction Monitoring of the 1300 Block of Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia . Thunderbird Archaeology.\n\nFannon Petroleum Fuel Company (residence), 1300 block of Duke Street\n\nSignificant ground disturbance after the mid-20th century left next-to-no trace of the buildings and features that once stood in the project area. Archaeologists also monitored construction activities where earth-moving could expose artifacts or features still remaining. Revealed were three brick features: two brick foundations, built in the 1840s, and one brick-lined water filtration cistern, built between 1836 and 1852. The foundations were thought to be associated with the John P. Emerson house, demolished in 1953. These features were disturbed and partially destroyed in the construction of a service station (standing on the property until 2007). Archaeologists supervised the removal of the filtration cistern, which also showed signs of disturbance, recording the feature and collecting artifacts. It was cleared out in the early 1900s to be used solely for refuse, explaining the presence of late 19th- and 20th-century fill. (Note: Researchers also should review the other report for Fannon Petroleum Fuel Company and the reports for 1100–1900 Duke Street, including 44AX103 and 105, Spring Garden, and Whole Foods/Royalton Project [44AX190].)\n\nJohnson, Edward and Tammy Bryant\n\n2012 - Letter Report: Archaeological Investigations within Landbay L, Potomac Yard Property, City of Alexandria, Virginia.

This report also included preliminary research on Maryland brewers and bottlers.

Custer\n\n1992 - Cameron Station Alexandria, Virginia Cultural Resource Investigation Report . Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nWashington Quartermaster Depot/Cameron Station/Clermont Avenue Interchange (possible prehistoric site; World War II Army Quartermaster Depot), 4700–5200 blocks of Duke Street, 44AX158\n\nThe proposed Clermont Avenue Interchange precipitated a historical survey of the site in which archaeologists suggested its nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Covering 166 acres, the Army’s Washington Quartermaster Depot (later known as Cameron Station) comprised 22 structures, with 17 dating to the World War II period. A second building phase in the late 1950s/early 1960s raised a convenience store, guard house, pavilion, and service station. The World War II-era structures adhered to military construction standards for the time—concrete, brick, and frame rather than precious steel; buildings added after the war conformed to the style of these earlier structures. The focus of the facility was its eight warehouses, which in 1962 were converted into office space. The warehouse interiors were altered while the footprints were not, remaining essentially unchanged up to this 1991 study. In the 1990s the facility served as a commissary and Post Exchange System for Washington-area military personnel. Attached correspondence noted that the facility was to be closed and also that it was determined ineligible for the NRHP. The 1992 report testified to the site’s low archaeological potential because of the area’s large amounts of fill and historic wetlands environment. In 1998, because of a proposed housing development, geomorphological and archaeological investigations, specifically soil coring and shovel testing, took place, to find the historic grade beneath all the fill. From this horizon archaeologists found one piece of glass, one piece of metal, one quartzite flake, and two small debitage. The presence of these lithic artifacts, the site’s proximity to a stream, and the historic wetlands environment suggested that the area may have been occupied by American Indians in the past; however, the minimal findings and extent of disturbance at the site led archaeologists to conclude that no further study was warranted. (Note: Researchers also should review the report for Clermont Avenue Interchange.)\n\nKlein, Mike, Danae Peckler, Joseph R.

Engineering-Science, Inc., Washington, D.C.\n\nRoberdeau’s Wharf/Harborside (distillery; wharf; warehouse; sail loft; brewery; shipyard; foundry; Civil War complex including warehouses and freed black/contraband residence; coal yard; rail yard; power plant), 400 South Union Street, 44AX114\n\nMost of the 3.5-acre waterfront lot was made-land, built as a wharf in the late 18th century, and serving as a commercial wharf and shipyard into the 19th century, including a brewery, foundry, and locomotive works. An electric power plant functioned in the first half of the 20th century. Archival research plotted ownership and usage of the property, beginning with Daniel Roberdeau’s rum distillery in 1774. By the 1790s, Roberdeau extended the wharf into the water, switching over to the businesses of shipping and trade. By 1791, the distillery served as a warehouse and sail loft. The distillery was referred to as a brewhouse in the early 19th century. By 1803, Roberdeau leased land south of the distillery to John Hunter, to be used as a shipyard—one of the earliest in Alexandria. The facility, which operated until after 1850, had a small number of enslaved African Americans who may have lived within the project area, though the archaeological record did not support this. The foundry opened around 1829 and closed in 1857. After the Civil War, only the foundry and a few outbuildings still stood. These structures served as storehouses and freed black/contraband quarters during the war. Next came the coal yard and the establishment of railroad tracks, linking these and other industries to the waterfront. By 1907, the power plant had opened. Excavation turned up wood planking with a compressed wood chip and pine tar surface (wharf), portions of brick furnace and coal bin (brewery), and remains of various buildings related to the power plant. Artifacts included: ceramic and glass fragments, a few whole or nearly complete glass vessels, pipe fragments, and a bayonet, but primarily architectural materials, such as window glass, nails, wooden planks, and small wooden objects. Archaeologists unearthed one prehistoric stone tool thought to have been discarded or washed in from a nearby site.\n\nKoski-Karrell, Daniel\n\n2002 - Archeological Evaluation of the Addition to 111 N. Alfred Street at Site 44AX96 in Alexandria, Virginia . Karell Archeological Services, Washington, D.C.\n\nMoore-McLean Sugar House (sugar refining factory; residence), 111 North Alfred Street, 44AX96\n\nFrom circa 1804–1828 the factory, run by William Moore then Daniel, followed by son Samuel, McLean, operated on what are today lots 111–123 N. Alfred St. Prior to the construction of an addition to the property, archaeological excavation exposed brick building foundations and coarse whiteware used in sugar refining. In addition, archaeologists discovered domestic artifacts related to the residential occupation of the site beginning in 1841. (Note: Researchers also should review the site report for 900 King Street [44AX113]. Additionally, researchers should read Barr, Cressey, and Magid’s 1994 article “How Sweet it Was: Alexandria’s Sugar Trade and Refining Business” in Historical Archaeology of the Chesapeake.)\n\n1993 - Background Study and Archaeological Evaluation for the First Addition to Colonial Park Development Project at the Mount Ida House, 2404 Russell Road, Alexandria, Virginia . Karell Archaeological Services, Arlington, Virginia.\n\nMount Ida/North Ridge Neighborhood/Colonial Park, First Addition (prehistoric site; farm; residence), 2404 Russell Road, 44AX168\n\nA residential development led to an archaeological study of the four acres, including historical background and fieldwork, prior to any ground-disturbing activity. The Mount Ida house was built between 1800–1808 by Charles Edward Alexander, Jr., as the main residence of the Mount Ida farm, which survived into the early 20th century when the land was subdivided, creating the North Ridge neighborhood. The house existed as a single-family dwelling until it was purchased in 1942 by an order of nuns who enlarged it into a convent and built a school on the property. After 1991, the convent and school passed to separate owners. Research showed that 19th-century occupation was primarily intermittent and prior to the Civil War and that there was more intensive occupation afterward. This was reflected in the archaeological record; most artifacts dated post-1840 and predominately post-1880.

Public Summary\n\nBruin Slave Jail (residence; slave jail), 1707 Duke Street, 44AX172\n\nBefore redevelopment of the property, all modern structures were demolished and fill removed, leaving a circa 1820 two-story brick house. Slave trader Joseph Bruin operated a slave-trading establishment here (1844–1861). He purchased several people who attempted to escape aboard the schooner Pearl in 1848, including Emily and Mary Edmonson, and he inspired some of the characters and incidents in Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Archaeological excavation turned up pre-Civil War artifacts as well as features indicating slave quarters and a separate kitchen for the slaves along with a brick cistern, which served the jail and wash house. (Archaeologists suggested in this site report that there were several other structures on the property inhabited and/or used by Bruin’s slaves.) Following their capture, the Edmonson sisters occupied both the jail and wash house, probably using water from the cistern to wash clothes. A storage pit near or inside the slave quarter included artifacts suggestive of a hoodoo ritual deposit, providing some insight into the personal and spiritual lives of Bruin’s slaves. The kitchen midden contained animal bones, ceramics, and other artifacts. In addition, the discovery of stylish ceramics dating to the 1840s and 1850s in the slave jail implied a close association between the jail and Bruin house. (The cistern is preserved, and a sculpture honoring the Edmonson sisters has been erected.)\n\nKreisa, Paul P., Eric Griffitts and John Gentry\n\n2018 - Initial Archaeological Assessment of the Proposed Waterfront Flood Management Project, Alexandria, Virginia.

Public Summary\n\n1604–1614 King Street (possible prehistoric area; tenant residence; residence; commercial/industrial area)\n\nThe 0.4-acre project area contained six townhouses. This Phase IA report documented the use of the property from agricultural (pasture for livestock grazing) to residential (a 19th-century tenement then townhouses built between 1913–1918) to commercial after 1959. Its proximity to Hoof’s Run increased its potential to include prehistoric resources. 1614, which suffered substantial damage in a 1999 fire, was to be demolished entirely or at least partially while 1604–1612 were to be retained and returned to residential use. Developers planned to put in a new residence plus underground parking at the rear of the study area.\n\n2006 - Phase IA Archaeological Assessment of 1604-1614 King Street Properties, Alexandria, Virginia.

Excavation recovered few artifacts (Gabion wire and cut spikes), but exposed multiple features, including the earth structures of the filling room and powder magazine as well as the parapet, drainage ditch, gun embrasures, and platforms. Investigation revealed two details: first, that the site expanded between 1861–1865 and, second, that the timber beams used in the construction of the earth structures were carefully removed from the site for reuse circa 1866. Archaeologists cited the fort as an example of Civil War military engineering at its finest. (This was the first archaeological project in Alexandria.) (Note: Researchers also should review the site report for “The Fort” Neighborhood/Fort Ward Historical Park, Old Grave Yard [44AX90 and 153].)\n\nMore on Archaeology at Fort Ward\n\nLeach, Peter A. and Sarah Traum\n\n2012 - Documentary Study for Safeway Redevelopment, 3526 King Street, Alexandria, Virginia.

There were no archaeological resources in the southern half. The grave shafts included one possible infant burial and one possible vault-style grave because of its larger size. The graves were preserved in-situ through filling with gravel and reinforced concrete, creating a foundation for the ramp.

Public Summary\n\nWhole Foods/Royalton Project (residence; tenant residence; bakery; grocery store; automobile dealership; automotive paint shop; shopping center), 1700 block of Duke Street, 44AX190\n\nIn 2003 archaeologists accomplished two phases of study—research then digging—on the site’s approximately 1.65 acres prior to the imminent construction of a Whole Foods and residences on top of what had been a shopping center and parking lot from 1959–2002. Construction also was to include the removal of a grassy island, sidewalk widening, installation of underground utilities, and surface grading. During the initial phase, archaeologists established a complete chain of title, recording the various functions of the site over time: first, residential, including tenant occupation, then commercial, beginning with a bakery in the late 18th to early 19th century, then, by 1924, a grocery store, followed by a automobile dealersh"
