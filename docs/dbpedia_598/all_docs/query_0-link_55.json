        "text": "A situational map for the 35 day of the Russia invasion reports of intelligence, maps captured on the enemy and the battles themselves.\n\nSITUATION:\n\nRemarkable defense (you can see training of NATO instructors and help), but in the face of the immediate loss of the ‚Äûcorridor of life‚Äù and the encirclement of key forces (encirclement), it may collapse.\n\nEverything is very dynamic and far from momentary optimism in the matter of maintaining key positions in the face of the increasing determination of the enemy who threw the reserve and intensifies the terror with the bestial bombing of cities and key civilian facilities (vide Syria, Chechnya), due to the failure to achieve its basic goals in time, to break the will to fight. Hay is a panic that is supposed to paralyze the already overloaded communication routes with refugees.\n\nDantesque scenes causing tears we face every day and what the incoming train in overcrowded Lviv in the fight for places to the Polish border. The despair of children being separated from their mothers and loaded onto trains alone to let more get in. Piles of abandoned baby carriages, suitcases and things to save space and save as much as possible . We faced unvalivable human tragedy scale after WW2 in center of Europe !!!\n\nLIFE CORRIDOR\n\n800.000 now reached (mainly babes) saefe Polish border ,and We expect soon 4mln more.\n\nPRIORITIE\n\n1.Treatement for children of post traumatic stress disorder PTSD wiht EMDR progam by VR ferry tails therapy with special stuff help\n\n2. Save the ‚Äûcorridor of life‚Äù protected at the base mainly by reservists from the rear units and tragically equipped volunteers.\n\nHowever, the will to fight is great. Here Marianna brather ( Marian brother) who in fact will fight for us traning volunteer medics. The 1st battalion of LW√ìW defence ans surroudings He will be fight and defend corridor of life till last breath thousands of children and womens trying to escape from incoming indivers.\n\nThese all boys aren‚Äôt gonna give up. They defend their own land and all the values of today‚Äôs civilization to which they wanted and want to belong. If we do not keep together 3rd Reisch 2.0 here and now, we will be next. it enough to look at map and all anexatrions dates one by one till 2006y. Monster appetit grow and grow only.\n\nThere is enough to look to understand polish life corridor urgent support\n\nThey will survive the attack of the elite units deployed to eliminate the corridor if we retrofit them mainly with medicines and defence life equpipement and give the parties equal chances to survive. Dirctly from Andrew train center thay will go to defend Lviv and Rivne, exactly as we did it in 1918, 1921 and 1939, also against the Russians.\n\n3. Send the equipment through all possible channels to the given areas where volunteers are currently training intensively.\n\nCilivised World one of the hardest slidarity test after WW2\n\nThese are Mariana (yangest Ukraine side) official ‚ÄûUkraine help‚Äù coordinator few heart breaking words to own people in USA and all around the world:\n\nAt this hard time, I want to ask Ukrainian diaspora to become a part of Ukrainian army and every citizen who courageously defends independence of our country. Same as you are, I am not in Ukraine, but each of us has friends, family or neighbors out there who need our help right now. Not everyone can now hold a weapon in their hands next to our soldiers, but the war is being held on all fronts! We are able to support our citizens not only via posts on Facebook or Instagram, but also with real financial help, which will go to purchase the most necessary things for army and territorial defense. Every helmet, first aid kit or bulletproof vest is someone‚Äôs life! We are writing a new history of the world right now and we have no right to stand aside of it. These funds will be able to save not only the lives of those soldiers who are currently defending our land, but also those who are preparing resistance to russian troops and saboteurs. My younger brother is currently on intensive training with other fighters. Unfortunately, they are not fully equipped with everything what they need, as all forces have thrown to the front. There is a catastrophic lack of equipment. That‚Äôs why, I begging you to help us to protect these young fighters and help us to buy basic things that can save their lives.\n\nMariana Butchak\n\nIMPORTANT!\n\nIt must be remembered that corruption has not disappeared in Ukraine. The chaos of war also added to this. Despite the official declared governmental aid, many things simply do not get where they need to be and in the amount they need.\n\nIt needs to be patched urgently, which is confirmed by the dramatic appeals we receive from volunteers, the families of the defense staff themselves, and the letters delivered to us.\n\nWe have lists of specific urgent purchases provided directly by the defenders and their CARPATHIAN DEFENSE HQ.\n\nWe are currently equipping the 1st platoon out of 4 trainees.\n\nPriority list examples we are saneding and supporting now (more in separate page)\n\n‚Äì IFAK Trauma Medical Kit V1 first aid kits 65 pcs X4\n\n‚Äì tourniquets (self-adjusting) may be SICH type (all with Alumnium rod). The handle for twisting the band must be made of duralumin because plastic ones often break !!! 130 pieces\n\nOnly Svaning soldiers life parts ‚Äì helmets , vests (after contact) ‚Äì no weapons at all !!!\n\nCurrently, in Poland and its vicinity, most warehouses are literally cleared of key items for ‚Äûon-the-spot‚Äù purchases, mainly by government orders, aid groups and, unfortunately, speculators who have also increased prices sometimes 10 times.\n\nYOU NEED MEANS FOR FAST PURCHASES IN THE USA AND ASSURING THE FASTEST AIR DELIVERY TO GDA≈ÉSK\n\nWE ALSO ASK FOR HELP IN COMPLETING THE ITEMS FROM THE LIST ON THE PLACE TO BUY\n\nShipments to Gda≈Ñsk and Gdynia to prepared warehouses and coordinators on duty at Pland, Stary Rynek Oliwski 15 street, 80-324 Gda≈Ñsk (1st hub) and Poland, Gdynia Wiejska 27a / 7 street (2nd hub).\n\nphone : +48 720787069 mail [email protected]\n\nEach amount paid here will be properly spent and will quickly make it go to the right places. Bottom-up help is needed. Only she is precisely coordinated with the right needs.\n\nThis is a wolf test for us, Poles and the world ‚Ä¶ The result and effectiveness of the aid depends on how our fate will turn out. It is enough to look at the map and the dates of subsequent annexations. Hitler 2.0 and pure evil as the late prof. Brzezinski advising successive presidents of the United States will not stop, and his appetite only grows.\n\nThere is no point in deluding ourselves ‚Ä¶ If we do not keep it together now, God help us ‚Ä¶ We, Poles, know the history that is repeating itself in a way ‚Ä¶\n\nMain account :\n\nStowarzyszenie WIATR OD MORZA https://www.facebook.com/Wiatr-od-Morza-105595471666611/\n\nWiejska 27A / 7, 81-068 Gdynia, Polska KRS 0000894841 NIP 9581715626 REGON 388695286\n\nIBAN\n\nmBank : PL 55 1140 2004 0000 3802 8158 6974"
