Bullard\n\nIn 1973, one of the worst prison riots in the country happened at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma. In the shadow of the Attica prison riot, the conditions of inmates in McAlester were brought into sharp focus as the prison burned. Using interviews conducted by those who were there, Claudia K. Bullard explores the complex series of events that led to the prison riot and the response of the Oklahoma National Guard in negotiating the release of hostages and the end of the event.\n\n“The Schooled Daughters of Major Ridge Amidst Turbulent Cherokee Transitions,” by Karen Coody Cooper\n\nDuring the early nineteenth century, the world changed drastically for the Cherokee Nation. For Sarah and Nancy Ridge, the daughters of Major Ridge, navigating the removal of the tribe from their homelands and the world of formal education while their society crumbled was fraught with difficulty. Karen Coody Cooper presents the lives of these two women, one brief and the other long, as an exploration of resilience in the face of adversity.\n\n“The West Shawnee Cattle Trail (or the Junction City, Kansas Route) Through Oklahoma, 1867–1871, Part 1,” by Gary and Margaret Kraisinger\n\nA Shawnee Cattle Trail system was established by cattle drovers as early as 1846. After the Civil War, trail drivers planned to use the same East Shawnee Trail, but the first driving season after the war proved to be disastrous. By the spring of 1867, drovers realized that new routes would need to be blazed. With Junction City in focus, drovers established two West Shawnee branches of the system—one from Fort Gibson along the Arkansas River and another peeling from the old East Shawnee trunk line at Boggy Depot in Indian Territory. Gary and Margaret Kraisinger trace the cattle route through Oklahoma in part one of this two-part article.\n\nVolume 101, Issue 4 (Winter 2023–24)\n\n“Expressions of Place Attachment and Environmental Justice Near the Tar Creek Superfund Site,” by Brooke N. Foster, Angela M. Person, and Randy A. Peppler\n\nThe Tar Creek Superfund Site, located in northeastern Oklahoma, was the first superfund site designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1983. The landscape, scarred by mines and chat piles, was declared toxic, and residents were told that living in the area could cause permanent harm. Since 1983, land remediation has often fallen to various organizations, including the Quapaw Nation. Through interviews with area residents, Foster, Person, and Peppler explore people’s attachment to the land of Tar Creek.\n\n“On Chickasaw Nation and Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma Tribal Timber Transactions,” by Matthew Armor\n\nIn 2014, The Chickasaw Nation and The Choctaw Nation v. The Department of the Interior et al. was filed with the claim that “the US (government) was supposed to retain timber lands in trust for the tribes but breached this duty by selling, transferring or purchasing timber land.” The dispute between the tribal nations and the government lasted for over 100 years. Armor explores the complex history of tribal timber transactions in southern Oklahoma and how the tribes have fought to retain their tribal autonomy.\n\n“These are Lydie Marland’s Words,” by Gary Robert Pinnell\n\nLydie Marland, former first lady of Oklahoma, is a tragic figure in history. Newly uncovered letters owned by the University of Oklahoma shed light on her life from the 1920s to the 1940s. These letters, written to Grace Murray, discuss Marland’s troubles as a former first lady, her role as wife to oilman E. W. Marland, and the money troubles and mental illnesses that would plague the couple for years. Pinnell writes about the complex life of one of Oklahoma’s most mysterious citizens.\n\nVolume 101, Issue 3 (Fall 2023)\n\n“Nike Missile Fail: When Elk City and Clinton Almost Went Nuclear,” by Landry Brewer\n\nWhen the Soviet Union acquired nuclear capabilities in 1949, the Cold War between the communist East and the democratic West truly heated up. The United States invested in surface-to-air missile programs to protect itself in the event of a long-range nuclear bombing attack by the Soviets. Landry Brewer describes the tension of the times, the hope of investment in infrastructure, and how changing technologies caused economic decline in rural Oklahoma.\n\n“Lucile Spire Blachly and the Politics of Women’s Health Reform in Oklahoma,” by Kathi Nehls\n\nIn 1930 Dr. Lucile Spire Blachly was named one of Oklahoma’s twenty-four leading women, but the story of her work in reforming women’s health care in Oklahoma is not well known. Kathi Nehls recounts Blachly’s career as director of the Oklahoma Bureau of Maternity and Infancy and explains how Oklahoma politics of the 1920s affected her ability to enact needed improvements to maternal and infant care.\n\n“Migrant Music,”, by Sonja Czarnecki\n\nIn the depths of the Great Depression, many families from Oklahoma made the trek to California, seeking a new life away from communities hard hit by the Dust Bowl. In the Farm Security Administration camps there, migrants created communities and shared the cultural heritage they imported with them. Sonja Czarnecki investigates the Library of Congress’s Voices from the Dust Bowl project, revealing the picture of the “Okie” migrants created through this work.\n\n“The McAlester Scottish Rite Temple: A Monument to its Architect, William T. Schmitt,” by T. S. Akers\n\nThe first Scottish Rite temple in McAlester was built in 1907, but by the 1920s the order had grown so large that an expansion was needed. The Masons of McAlester hired William T. Schmitt, an established architect out of Oklahoma City, to tackle the task. T. S. Akers tells the story of both the building and its architect, as well as the economic and social circumstances surrounding the project.\n\nVolume 101, No. 2 (Summer 2023)\n\n“Those Hills are Talking: The History of Welling, Oklahoma, 1828–2000,” by Russell E. Jones II\n\nWhen most people think of the Ozark Plateau, they think of the states of Missouri and Arkansas. This uplift, however, extends into northeastern Oklahoma, as does the culture that sprang up within that environment. The community of Welling, Oklahoma, grew from the influx of Old Settler Cherokees, Cherokees who were forcibly removed to the area on the Trail of Tears, and white settlers who came initially for the timber industry and then established roots in the area. Russell E. Jones II describes the life cycle of an Ozark town through the story of the land, economy, and social construction of Welling.\n\n“The United Methodist Church, Fletcher, Oklahoma,” by AP Moser\n\nWhile a church is not limited by the walls of its structure, small-town life often revolves around church buildings. This is true in the town of Fletcher, Oklahoma, where churches were not only sources of spiritual sustenance but also places for communities to gather to celebrate, mourn, and create connections. The United Methodist Church in Fletcher was established in 1904, and its current building was completed in 1934. AP Moser presents the history of the construction of this church, and makes a case for the preservation of this unique piece of Oklahoma’s built environment.\n\n“Bobbed Hair, the Klan, and a Courtship: The Letters of Clefford Vickrey and Elizabeth Osborne,” by Noreen Osborne Vickrey and Alvin O. Turner\n\nIt is not always easy to understand the impact of history through the lens of big events or famous names. Instead, it is valuable to see through the eyes of ordinary people when possible. Through the sources they leave behind, historians gain insight into the cares and concerns of everyday Oklahomans. Noreen Osborne Vickrey and Alvin O. Turner analyze the letters written between Clefford Vickrey and Elizabeth Osborne to understand how the social changes of the 1920s were perceived by a couple planning to build a life together in rural Oklahoma.\n\nVolume 101, No. 1 (Spring 2023)\n\n“‘Ignorance is the Curse of God; Knowledge the Wing Wherewith We Fly to Heaven’: The University of Oklahoma Bizzell Bible Collection,” by Jeffrey M. Wilhite\n\nWilliam Bennett Bizzell, president of the University of Oklahoma from 1925–41, bought his first Bible when he was a college student. From that first purchase, Bizzell grew his collection to 665 volumes, which were donated to the university after his death. Since receiving this donation, the university has both preserved the collection and added to it, creating a varied assortment ready for researchers. Jeffrey M. Wilhite describes the contents of the Bizzell Bible Collection, its journey from a private collection to a university showpiece, and its importance to archivists around the world.\n\n“The Influence of Oklahomans on the Bakersfield Sound: One of Country Music’s Greatest Eras,” by Phil Neighbors\n\nThe migration of people from Oklahoma to California in the 1930s made a huge cultural impact on the region. One of the most notable imports that the “Okies” brought with them was their music. In the new environment of Bakersfield, California, country music took root and became what is now known as the Bakersfield Sound. Phil Neighbors uses his unique insight into the lives of the musicians of the Bakersfield Sound to detail the contributions of both the most well-known performers and those men and women who often played in the background.\n\n“‘She’s My Chi Upsilon’: The Creation of a Women’s Geology Fraternity,” by Elizabeth M. B.
