        "text": "INDIVIDUALS\n\nWILL VERCOE ’58\n\nAfter spending most of his high school years at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, PA, Will Vercoe ‘58 arrived in Brooklandville for a fifth year of high school. Will’s arrival was a boon for St. Paul’s, for he was both a popular addition to the class of 1958 and a multisport athlete who made an immediate impact. “He wasn’t just good; he was great,” proclaimed his classmate Neale Smith ’58 in his nomination of Will for induction into the Athletic Hall of Fame. “Just imagine if we’d had him for a couple of years.” Will’s senior page in the 1958 yearbook noted that he was “Lower Merion’s lend-lease to St. Paul’s.”\n\nDuring his year in Brooklandville, Will indeed proved himself a dynamic athlete. On the gridiron he was a tough-running halfback and a bruising linebacker, a key player on a team that went 5-1-1 and tied Gilman—quite an achievement in those days. Will corralled a game-winning interception against Aberdeen, in a season that produced the best won-lost record the Crusaders had seen in seven years. Will won the team Spirit Award that year, an unusual selection in that such recognition generally goes to those who maintain great attitudes despite minimal playing time, rather than to top players\n\nWill was co-captain of the 1958 wrestling team that, according to his yearbook, “not only showed itself to be one of the finest varsity teams in the city, but brought the wrestling spirit to a fever pitch at St. Paul’s.” Described as an “athletic prodigy,” Will won the MSA wrestling tournament in his weight class of 175 lbs. and became the first MSA champion from St. Paul’s, unbeaten while wrestling ten pounds over his weight. He was selected as Best Wrestler of the Tournament (along with a McDonogh wrestler) and won the Lehigh Cup as the tournament’s most valuable wrestler.\n\nLacrosse was no exception. In a year following the graduation of all three starters on close defense, Will led a defensive unit that defeated three college freshman teams—Hopkins, Hofstra and Maryland—in 1958. This group limited the opposition to four goals per game over the team’s first seven games, and Will was recognized as an All-Maryland Defenseman.\n\nWill capped off his year at St. Paul’s with his selection by classmates as the “First to Rule the World” in their senior elections.\n\nCHUCK O’CONNELL JR. ’61\n\nChuck O’Connell ’61 was successful not only as a high-school and college athlete but as a coach, a trade he plied at Friends School in Baltimore, Washington & Lee University and, most notably, at his alma mater, where he coached football and lacrosse from 1967 to 1973, with legendary coaches Martin D. “Mitch” Tullai (football) and George Mitchell (lacrosse). Chuck played vital roles on those teams, which won three Tri-County League football championships (1970, 1971, and 1972) and three MSA A Conference lacrosse crowns (1969, 1970, and 1971).\n\n“One couldn’t ask for any more than Chuck O’Connell, as a player or a coach,” said Coach Tullai, who recalled that Chuck, a quarterback and defensive back, once went 70 yards on a broken play to seal a win vs. Southern High School in an upset victory. He played three years of football and lacrosse and wrestled his last two years in Brooklandville, earning Honorable Mention All MSA in football his senior year (1961), when he helped lead the team to a 7-1 record and convincing wins over Gilman and McDonogh.\n\nChuck was awarded the football Spirit Award his senior year and the Loyalty Cup his senior year. His yearbook noted that, as a wrestler, he was voted the “most determined” member of the squad as a senior.\n\nLacrosse became the most fertile ground for Chuck’s athletic success. As a crafty crease attackman for the Crusaders, he helped lead the team to consecutive MSA A Conference championships in 1960 and 1961, netting five of his team’s six goals in a win over Loyola that sent the Crusaders to the 1961 championship game.\n\nChuck’s stellar lacrosse career continued at Denison University, where he was selected to the All-Midwest team all four years and garnered Honorable Mention All American honors for two years. He was also selected as a co-captain his senior year. Chuck is a member of the Denison University Athletic Hall of Fame, the Ohio Lacrosse Hall Of Fame; the Maryland Lacrosse Club Hall of Fame, all as an athlete; and in the Athletic Halls of Fame of Washington & Lee University (coach/administrator); and St. Paul’s School (coach of the 1969 Lacrosse Team).\n\nChuck coached with the Maryland Lacrosse Club and has also coached at Washington & Lee (1973 to 2007, and where he continues as a volunteer coach); the Virginia Lacrosse Club and for various middle school teams. In 2015 he received the U.S. Intercollegiate Men’s Lacrosse Coaches Association Lifetime Achievement Award, having served as the organization’s president; and he has served as president of the U.S. Lacrosse Coaches Association.\n\nWINNIE BLENCKSTONE ’62 †\n\nWinnie Blenckstone ’62 was a two-sport athlete at St. Paul’s and one of the best centers in school history, according to head varsity football coach Martin D. “Mitch” Tullai, who also recalled an unorthodox formation that allowed Winnie to complete a pass—no surprise, perhaps, from a boy who was an outstanding pitcher. During his senior year, he was a co-captain of the football team, selected as the team’s Unsung Hero, and a member of the Monogram Club.\n\nHis true love was baseball, in an era when the school had no baseball team. Winnie played summer baseball in New Jersey during high school and college, then pitched at the University of Richmond for four years. After college, he was a batting practice pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles for several seasons.\n\nIn 1987, Winnie purchased the Myrtle Beach Blue Jays, a minor league team in the South Atlantic League (Class A). In 1992, he moved the team from Myrtle Beach to Hagerstown, Maryland, and renamed it the Hagerstown Suns. Winnie served as vice president of the league for a number of years and, after selling the team in 2002, was inducted into the SAL Hall Of Fame.\n\nFollowing his retirement and subsequent move back to Baltimore in 2001, Winnie coached junior varsity baseball at his alma mater, where he loved teaching the game that gave him so much enjoyment. “Winnie’s presence in the baseball program showed me the power of this place,” recalled Pat Walsh, head of SP middle school who was then the St. Paul’s varsity baseball coach. “As a new, 23-year-old teacher, I remember wondering why this guy would spend his retirement coaching in such an unselfish manner, but the answer eventually became clear. He loved this school, and he wanted to give back to a place that was very special to him. He was great with the boys, mixing his old-school approach with a grandfatherly touch that they really respected.”\n\nWinnie often spoke with great respect about the coaches he had at St. Paul's who acted as father figures in his life, especially coaches Martin D. “Mitch” Tullai and Michael Rentko. Winnie was the lead donor for the St. Paul’s baseball field, which is named for him, and he established the Winston R. Blenckstone ’62 Scholarship to support outstanding student-athletes at St. Paul’s.\n\nHe was very proud that his two children are members of the SP Hall of Fame (David '86) and SPSG Hall of Fame (Jenifer Boyce '88). St. Paul’s lost an outstanding alumnus when Winnie passed away in 2017.\n\nHARRY POLLOCK ’67\n\nHarry Pollock ’67 was a tough, rugged three-sport athlete equally capable of decking an opposing linebacker on the football field and dodging riding attackmen while clearing the ball on the lacrosse field. A captain of both the legendary St. Paul’s 1966 football squad and the 1967 lacrosse team, Harry earned a spot on the Baltimore News American’s All C Conference First Team in 1966 and the school’s Football Hardnose Award, given in those days to a player whose dominance over the opposition in the trenches allowed the offense to succeed. And succeed the Crusaders did in the autumn of 1966, scoring 315 points while yielding but 57, as Harry anchored both the offensive and defensive lines.\n\nUnder the tutelage of wrestling coach Don Hughes (assisted by Jamie Andrew and Pete McIntosh ’61), Harry was a major force on the mats, grappling in the Heavyweight division and racking up 11 wins and one tie, without a loss.\n\nHis athletic prowess again helped propel the Crusaders to a championship in the spring of 1967, when they defeated Gilman to clinch the MSA A Conference lacrosse title, with Harry an imposing force on close defense around the goal. The 1967 yearbook noted that the rigorous running program imposed by the lacrosse coaches, George Mitchell ’44 and Walter “Neil” Pohlhaus ’45, paid off, particularly in close games, as the Crusaders were able to muster more stamina than their opponents in last quarter.\n\nThere is no finer testament to a St. Paul’s athlete than one from legendary teacher and football coach Mitch Tullai, who said of Harry: “He was a really good leader, and a top- echelon lineman, one of the best in the conference. Because of injuries to other players, we moved Harry to fullback for a tough game against Severn,” he continued. “After game, which we won, the Severn coach told me that when they saw Harry lining up at fullback, they knew they couldn’t win.”\n\nHarry was a recipient of the Charles Pforr Memorial Athletic Award, given annually to an athlete who has shown the greatest improvement in one or more sports. Comments from classmates on Harry’s senior page in the 1967 Crusader yearbook cited his “outstanding ingenuity, determination, and hustle” and his reputation as a “hard running fullback.” His off-field athletic endeavors included serving as an officer of the Monogram Club and on the yearbook’s sports staff.\n\nHANK SMITH ’67\n\nHank Smith ’67 was an outstanding running back on one of the greatest St. Paul’s football teams ever—the 1966 team that went 8-1. The 1996 team defeated teams from much larger schools, powerhouses such as Northern, Mervo and John Carroll, along with traditional rivals Gilman and Boys’ Latin, on its way to capturing the C-Conference championship, the first in school history. Five players earned All-Conference honors, and one received All-MSA recognition—Hank Smith, an unanimous First Team selection.\n\n“Hank was one of the best pure running backs I ever coached,” said longtime coach Mitch Tullai, who described him as a triple threat. “Other guys were good runners and receivers, but Hank was really a stand-out runner, receiver, and kick returner. He made a difference in many of our games. And he was also good blocker.”\n\nAccolades for Hank began rolling in after his junior year season, when he was selected to The Baltimore News American’s First Team All-Private School Independent Team and earned Honorable Mention for The Baltimore Sun’s All-Prep Team.\n\nThe area football scene took notice of Hank’s eye-popping senior year. His 18 touchdowns and 12 two-point conversions—120 total points—in seven games led the MSA and placed him fifth in scoring in the state. A knee injury kept him out of the team’s final two games, but Hank still gained well over 1,000 yards in total offense. Highlights featured a number of touchdown runs of 45 yards or more and punt returns for touchdowns of 71, 60, and 55 yards—the latter in a 20-16 upset of Gilman (then in the B Conference).\n\nThe Baltimore Sun described him as “a shifty speedster,” “hammering Hank Smith,” and “Hustling Hank,” and a back with “great speed and an excellent change of pace.” Coach Tullai, in an interview with the Sun, praised the entire St. Paul’s backfield as good athletes whose skills were complementary, and said of his star running back, “Hank is a tough runner who can follow his blockers, but he knows when to cut free.”\n\nThat knee injury derailed plans for an athletic career in college. Hank was heavily recruited by Clemson, which dispatched the president of the university to visit him and his parents at home. But sitting out freshman year there was for naught, and by sophomore year Hank knew there would be no more football. But not to be deterred, he joined the diving team—but the knee would sink that dream, too.\n\nTIM MICHELS ’77 †\n\nTimmy Michels ’77 was an outstanding athlete at St. Paul’s, the epitome of the student-athlete who achieved success in three sports, earning multiple letters. “He was selfless and humble, a quiet leader who always led by example, and a constant source of motivation and inspiration to his teammates,” said Steve Stenersen ’78, who played on several teams with Timmy. “Timmy was just a great athlete and teammate,” recalled classmate and teammate, Jeff Fountain ’77. “He checked all the boxes.”\n\nTimmy’s skills were recognized with numerous St. Paul’s awards: the Best Athlete Cup (now the George Mitchell Best Athlete Cup), the Steve Stoelting Memorial Award for his contributions to Crusader basketball, and the George Gelston Award, given annually to the lacrosse team’s top defensive player.\n\nLocal coaches and sportswriters took notice, too. In football, Timmy garnered First Team All-Tri County honors as an end, “a sure-handed receiver, an excellent blocker and relentless tackler,” said Bato Pellington ’77.\n\nAnother classmate and teammate, Chip Carlson ’77, recalled that basketball may have been Timmy’s best sport, one in which he was selected First Team All-B Conference. He was a three-year starter. “On the basketball court, his jump shot was pure and accurate, but his passing game was just as dangerous,” said Chip. “If we’d had a three-point shot in those days, Timmy might have set a school scoring record.”\n\nTimmy’s teammates also extolled his abilities on the lacrosse field, a sport in which he was selected to the All-Metro team. “He was a tenacious defender; you wouldn’t want to be on the receiving end of his slide,” said Steve Stenersen. Chip Carlson put it well: “Some players have an innate sense and inner compass that gets them ahead of everyone else. Timmy had that gift and always covered our opponents’ best attackman, whether he was small and quick or big and strong. He was tenacious and reliable, and tough to practice against every day. Timmy was a very gifted athlete, human being, and good friend.”\n\nTimmy was the runner-up for “Most Popular” in the senior elections in the 1977 yearbook, a strong student-athlete who was respected by his peers, teachers, and coaches. Sadly, Timmy passed away in 2020, shortly after learning that he had been selected for the St. Paul’s Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nBATO PELLINGTON ’77\n\nBato Pellington ’77 was a dynamic three-sport athlete who earned eight varsity letters, spread across football, basketball and lacrosse. He was chosen a captain of each. Bato garnered numerous awards during his high school career at St. Paul’s, including the Best Athlete Award; the Kent W. Marbury Memorial Award, given to a football player recognized as a “quiet leader”; and the Stephen W. Fertig Memorial Award for outstanding character traits. Bato was also chosen as the St. Paul’s representative for the Ensign C. Markland Kelly Jr. Award, given to top high-school lacrosse players in various divisions in Maryland.\n\nA three-year starter in football, he was named an Honorable Mention All Tri County linebacker his junior year and a team captain his senior year. Head football coach Martin D. “Mitch” Tullai recalled a dramatic moment in Bato’s football career, during the final minutes of a game at Boys’ Latin: “We were down by a few points, and our quarterback went down with an injury,” Coach Tullai recalled. “Bato, then an underclassman, went in. We sent Peter Eisenbrandt (’76) in motion, and Bato’s pass to him won the game for us.”\n\nOn the basketball court, Bato was a two-year starter and garnered Honorable Mention All MSA B Conference honors his senior year, when he was a team captain and led the league in rebounding, averaging 15.2 boards per game.\n\nBato stood out particularly on the lacrosse field as an attackman who played primarily on the crease. A three-year letter winner and captain his senior year, Bato was named Honorable Mention All-MSA and Baltimore Evening Sun Honorable Mention his junior year, and to the First Team All-Metro squad the following year.\n\nHis lacrosse career continued on a high plane at the University of Virginia, where he was a three-year letter winner and played in three NCAA Tournaments, helping the Cavaliers to the NCAA championship game in 1980. Following graduation, Bato was an assistant lacrosse coach at the university 1983 and 1984, and later head coach of the Chesapeake Lacrosse Club from 1987 to 1991. He was named the USCLA Coach of the Year in 1990. For ten years, Bato coached numerous recreational league lacrosse teams.\n\nNot to be overlooked is that Bato was a 13-year man at St. Paul’s.\n\nCHRIS KAKEL ’96\n\nChris Kakel ‘96 excelled in the classroom and on the athletic field. A thirteen-year man, he earned nine varsity letters and was a three-sport athlete and three-sport captain during his senior year. Chris was selected as the 1996 Towson Times Athlete of the Year for his role as an ‘impact player’ in all three sports. He also graduated with the highest GPA in his class over the four years of upper school, receiving the Alumni Medal at graduation.\n\nA two-way starter and co-captain his senior year, Chris helped the 1995 Crusader football team to a 10-0 undefeated season and the MIAA B Conference Championship. He captained a defense that allowed opponents only 28 points over ten games, recording six shutouts. As an inside linebacker, he finished the season with 86 tackles and earned All County honors at this position. As a tight end, he led the team with 16 receptions, including three for touchdowns. Chris was an excellent blocker who helped power a rushing game that overwhelmed opponents—opposing teams knew that Crusader offensive plays would likely run to the side where he was lined up at tight end.\n\nChris served as a senior captain on the MIAA B Conference Championship basketball team that finished the season with a 17-6 record. A power forward, he averaged just under ten points and nearly eight rebounds per game, scoring numerous “double doubles” throughout the season. A clutch free-throw shooter, Chris was a go-to player with the game on the line; he sank crucial free throws in the waning seconds in one-point wins over Gilman and McDonogh.\n\nAn attackman and senior co-captain, Chris helped the Crusader lacrosse squad finish 18-3 and reach the MIAA A Conference championship game his senior year. A playmaker who directed the offense, he scored 35 goals and notched 32 assists during his senior season, along with 50 ground balls. A balanced contributor, Chris finished his three varsity seasons with 83 goals and 61 assists and was a first-team selection to the 1996 Baltimore Sun All Baltimore City/County lacrosse team. He was also chosen for the Sun’s All Metro second team.\n\nChris then became a four-year letter winner on a Duke University men’s lacrosse team that went to the NCAA tournament in each of his four years. He was a major contributor to Duke’s potent attack, finishing as the team’s fifth-leading scorer in both his junior and senior years and was a potent weapon on the Blue Devils’ extra-man offense. Chris finished his Duke career with 41 goals and 28 assists. He graduated cum laude in history and business.\n\nMICHAEL CIATTEI ’00\n\nProbably no goalkeeper in the storied history of soccer at St. Paul’s has matched the achievements of Michal Ciattei. He became the starting keeper his sophomore year, on a team heavily laden with seniors. Michael’s 36 career shutouts, very likely a school record, included holding A Conference powerhouse and third-ranked Loyola scoreless in a game that ended in a tie, and shutting out archrival Gilman 2-0.\n\nThe Crusaders reached the championship game for three consecutive years with Michael in the goal, taking home the trophy his sophomore year. He instinctively took command of the defensive end of the field. “Michael was clearly the most talented goalie and one of the best athletes I had the pleasure of coaching in my 19 years as a varsity coach (15 as head coach),” said Howard Schindler. “Cool under pressure, he set the tone for the team, allowing the field players to play loosely, knowing that Michael was in the goal.”\n\nMichael earned post-season recognition following his junior and senior years. He was First Team All-Conference both of those seasons. In his senior year, he was selected to the First Team All Baltimore City/County senior year and was the sole Crusader to play in the All State Game. He was elected team captain both junior and senior years and was the winner of the Carel Beernink Award for the most significant contribution to St. Paul’s soccer.\n\nSome of Michael’s best performances occurred in big games, reinforcing his reputation for acrobatic saves in key situations. His huge saves in the 1-0 championship win over Severn in 1997 were vital. In his senior year, 1999, he finished the season with 14 shutouts and only 13 goals allowed. Michael boasted some offensive chops as well; he was a great shooter and even made a penalty kick. “The team is very comfortable passing the ball back to Ciattei and allowing him to send it up field,” wrote Peter Darrell in the October 8, 1999, edition of The Page student newspaper. “His skills in the field almost match his skills in the goal.”\n\nSoccer was not Michael’s only sport, for he collected seven varsity letters, with three in basketball and golf added to the four he earned in soccer. He played on the 1997 championship golf team and the 1998 squad that earned a berth in the championship game.\n\nMichael continued his stellar career at Elizabethtown College, where he was a four-year starter, earning All-Conference honors in 2002 and 2003. He is second in school history for GAA (goals against average). Michael was later the assistant coach for the SPSG Gator soccer squad for eight years and for three years worked as a goalkeeper trainer and coach.\n\nGRANT A. HALFORD ’01\n\nGrant Halford ’01 was a formidable athlete in three sports at St. Paul’s, earning ten varsity letters. A running back in football and guard in basketball and lacrosse, Grant served as a captain of all three teams his senior year.\n\nHelping lead the 2000 Crusader football team to an impressive 7-2 record, Grant garnered All-Metro honors in his senior year. His coach, Paul Bernstorf, who recalled Grant snagging a 50-yard touchdown pass his senior year to beat Loyola, had great respect for Grant “because he played really hard in every sport and truly competed. It did not matter if it was practice or a game, Grant came to play.” This observation from Coach Bernstorf aptly describes a student-athlete who was part of the St. Paul’s Spirit Council, as Grant was.\n\nGrant was a starter on a Crusader basketball team that went 17-5 his senior year and lost in the championship game to Curley, on a last-second tip-in. But Grant may have saved his best for the spring, when lacrosse season got under way.\n\n“Grant was a classic two-way midfielder with great athleticism, strength, and speed,” recalled head lacrosse coach Rick Brocato. “He flew around the field making plays for his team. He could score and defend, and his energy level was off the charts.” His performance earned him a Baltimore Sun Athlete of the Week selection and All-Metro recognition his senior year and became a launching pad for his career at Loyola Maryland, where he played in every game during his four years there. San Jose selected Grant in the 47th round in the 2005 National Lacrosse League (indoor/box lacrosse league) draft, but he chose not to sign—“the indoor game was not for me,” he said.\n\nIn a testament to his ability and commitment, Grant won the George Mitchell Best Athlete Cup in both his junior and senior years. He was also the St. Paul’s 2001 representative for the C. Markland Kelly Award, given by the Maryland State Lacrosse Coaches Association to the most outstanding lacrosse players in each high school division.\n\nHOLDEN PLACK ’03\n\nThere would be little argument from Crusader basketball fans that Holden Plack ’03 is one of the most dominant players in school history. A three-year starter on the varsity, he became an impact player in his sophomore year, scoring 206 points and, at 6’ 8,” was one of the team’s leading rebounders. Holden helped lead the team to a 13-3 conference record (18-5 overall) and an appearance in the MIAA championship game, in which St. Paul’s fell to Curley on a last-second shot. The Crusaders received Honorable Mention in the Baltimore Sun poll of area high schools.\n\nStarting at center his junior year, Holden scored 347 points and led the Crusaders in rebounding, averaging just over ten rebounds per game and becoming one of the top 15 rebounders in the metro area. St. Paul’s again turned in a dominant performance, going 17-1 in the conference (19-5 overall) and defeating Gilman handily for the MIAA championship. The team’s success earned the 16th spot in the Baltimore Sun ranking of area high schools.\n\nHolden’s impressive performance, and that of the St. Paul’s basketball squad, continued in the 2002-03, season, Holden’s final one on the court. Serving as co-captain and playing at center, he led the team with 472 points, averaging 17.5 points and hauling down more than ten rebounds per game. In a battle for first place against St. Mary’s, he scored 35 points on 12-14 from the floor and 13-13 from the foul line. With a 17-1 conference record (22-5 overall), the Crusaders reached the championship game for a third consecutive year, dropping the final game to St. Mary’s by three points. The team’s #18 post-season ranking gave St. Paul’s its second consecutive spot in the top twenty high school teams in the metro area. The loss in that season’s championship game ended a remarkable streak of 34 MIAA consecutive conference wins, and the Crusaders notched upsets over A-conference powerhouses Calvert Hall, Loyola, and Cardinal Gibbons.\n\nThese achievements did not go unnoticed. Area coaches and sportswriters tapped Holden as First Team B-Conference All-MIAA his senior year. The Baltimore Sun placed him on their Second Team All-Metro team and on the First Team All Baltimore City/County team, and he made several All-Tournament teams, including the Peddie School Invitational and the Ray Mullis Holiday Classic in 2002.\n\nIn his three years on the court, Holden never missed a game while helping the Crusaders to a combined 59-15 record. He scored 1,025 points and corralled approximately 750 rebounds. He went on to earn a full four-year athletic scholarship to play for the Division 1 Towson University Tigers.\n\n“The success of the St. Paul's basketball program in the early 2000's is attributable to the sacrifices and talents of many people, but it was all centered around Holden,” said Coach Jack MacMullan. “He defended, rebounded, was a monster near the basket, and possessed a deft shooting touch from the perimeter. More importantly, he was a tremendous leader and teammate.”\n\nGREG “ROY” RODGERS ’04\n\nRepresenting the United States at the Junior World Team Championships in Japan, the summer of 2003 following his junior year at St. Paul’s, would have been quite an adventure for anyone, let alone a rising senior in high school. But Greg may have topped that in his senior season when he sank a five-foot birdie putt in sudden death to win an (at that time) unprecedented third MIAA golf championship (which he’d won freshman and junior years). He capped off that last season with his selection as the Baltimore Sun’s High School Golfer of the Year, the second year he’d earned that recognition.\n\nGreg had been the Towson Times’ Player of the Year his junior season, when he garnered his second MIAA individual title and helped lead the Crusaders to a third consecutive team championship. “Greg leads by example,” coach Rick Collins said at the time. “He’s by far our most consistent player…his bad days are not bad.” Other good days for Greg that year included wins and strong finishes that earned him spots in an American Junior Golf Association event in Georgia and two other major junior events. He also finished fifth in the 2002 United States Amateur Qualifier and was ranked as high as ninth nationally for 18-and-under players by Golfweek/Titleist.\n\nAlso on Greg’s card was the Future Collegians World Tour, which he won once and was a second-place finisher three times while earning First Team All-American honors in 2003.\n\nAfter playing second in the line-up freshman year and first for the remainder of his St. Paul’s career, the next stop on the tour for Greg was a golf scholarship at the University of Notre Dame, where he was a four-time Big East Conference Academic All-Star Team selection. In 2008 Greg was selected as an Academic All-American by the Golf Coaches Association of America. At UND he played on two Big East championship teams and finished one over par in the Big East Championship his junior year.\n\nGreg has coached high school golf in Colorado for the last six years and channels his remaining energy into keeping up with his young children, daughter Maeve and son Abram.\n\nAUSTIN SURHOFF ’09\n\n“My mom founded the swim team in the 2006-2007 school year,” said Austin Surhoff ’09. “Her founding the team is the reason I even have the chance to be in the Hall of Fame.” He helped lead the team to the B Conference championship, a remarkable achievement in the team’s first year, and he was the MIAA champion in the 200 IM.\n\nAustin, a 13 year man at St. Paul’s, was the co-winner of the George C. Mitchell Best Athlete Cup his senior year. As captain of the swim team that year, he helped lead the team to a second-place finish in the MIAA B Conference, with the squad’s only two losses against Gilman—the second being narrow loss in the championship.\n\nThat B Conference championship Austin’s junior year was all the more remarkable because the swim team was only in its third year. “A lot of guys I never thought would be into swimming joined the team, which meant a lot because most of my swimming experiences in high school were outside of St Paul’s,” Austin explained. “Doing something that special with my school friends was a one-of-a-kind experience.”\n\nAustin’s individual MIAA championships at St. Paul’s included the 200-meter IM (“individual medley,” in which swimmers compete in four strokes) sophomore year, both the 200 IM and 100 backstroke junior year and the 200 IM senior year. He also had a remarkable, parallel career during high school: he was thrice Maryland Swimmer of the Year for his age group and was on three USA National Junior Teams, winning a silver medal in the 200 IM at the 2008 World Young Championships and a bronze medal in the 200 IM at the 2009 Junior Pan Pacific Games. In 2008, Austin was a semi-finalist in the 200 IM at the Olympic Trials at age 17 and was the top 18-and-under finisher in the nation.\n\nAt the University of Texas-Austin, Austin won the 200 IM and was a member of the relay team that won the NCAA swimming title, both during his freshman year, when he was the top individual scorer. He went on to win seven events at the Big 12 Conference Championship as his team won the Big 12 team title all four years he was a member. Austin set the school record in the 400 IM, won the NCAA 4x100 freestyle Relay in 2012, and was an 11-time NCAA All-American.\n\nNotable swimming “extra-curriculars” included a fourth place finish at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials in the 200 IM, twice making the USA World University Games Team and taking a silver medal in 2013 as a member of the 200-freestyle relay team. From 2013 to 2016, when Austin swam professionally, he was a three-time U.S. National Team member in the 200 IM, a finalist at the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials and the 2014 U.S. National Champion in the 200-freestyle relay\n\nAustin was an assistant swim coach at the University of Virginia and is currently an assistant swim coach at the Johns Hopkins University. He also runs youth swim camps and is a swimsuit designer and Ambassador for Fike Swim.\n\nCOACH RICK BROCATO\n\nRick Brocato joined the St. Paul’s School faculty 1987, and after leaving in 1999, returned in 2004 as a teacher and varsity lacrosse coach. He was the head varsity lacrosse coach for 17 years (1995 to 1999 and 2006 to 2017), winning the 2010 Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association championship that featured a 17-7 win over Boys’ Latin in the championship game. In 1998 and 2010, “Coach Broc” was both the Baltimore Sun Coach of the Year and the U.S. Lacrosse Baltimore Chapter Coach of the Year. He was also on the coaching staffs of the St. Paul’s 1991 and 1992 MSA championship teams and the undefeated 1996 football team.\n\nRick is the winningest head lacrosse coach in St. Paul's history, with a record of 241-109, just ahead of the legendary George Mitchell. During Rick’s tenure, the Crusaders qualified for the playoffs in 15 of 17 years in the MIAA, one of the nation's most competitive high school lacrosse conferences, reaching four championship games and earning the 2010 conference title. Rick has coached five Hall of Fame inductees, 19 Major League Lacrosse/Premier Lacrosse League professionals, 19 players on NCAA championship teams, 44 All-Americans, and three Kelly Award winners.\n\nA graduate of Towson High School, Rick garnered All-County and All-State lacrosse honors his junior and senior seasons. He played at Washington College and, post-collegiately, for the Mount Washington Lacrosse Club from 1985 to 1989. Rick won the Colorado state lacrosse championship in 2001 as head coach at the Kent-Denver School, after which he returned to Baltimore to join the Boys’ Latin staff from 2002 to 2004, winning the 2002 MIAA league title. In 2021, Rick was head coach of the Towson High School varsity lacrosse team, which won the 3A regional title and played in the 3A state championship game.\n\nRick was the head coach of both the South team in the USILA Senior North-South Game in 1996 and the South team in the Senior Under Armor High School All-American game in 2011. He served on the selection staff for the 2016 USA U-19 FIL World Championship team.\n\nRick is a two-time recipient of the Alexander W. Schweizer Teacher-Coach Award (1998 and 2017) and was selected as the Kent W. “Skip” Darrell Distinguished Chair in Teaching and Coaching Excellence in 2015. He is particularly proud of having coached at least two sports every year for more than 30 years and having been a role model for many young men.\n\nTEAMS\n\n1951 LACROSSE\n\nThe Crusaders of the splendid and undefeated 1951 lacrosse team are overlooked no more! Compiling a sterling record of 12 wins and no losses, they tallied 132 goals while yielding but 45. Among their victims were four college freshman squads: the U.S. Naval Academy (a 5-3 victory), Baltimore Junior College (a 12-5 triumph), the University of Virginia Frosh (an 11-3 thumping), and the Johns Hopkins University Frosh (a 9-4 win).\n\nThe capstone of their outstanding season was a 9-4 win over perennial rival Gilman in the “Championship Play-off,” as their yearbook described it. Other highlights included wins over City (12-4), Severn (16-4) and McDonogh (13-8). Coached by the legendary Jim “Ace” Adams, the team boasted that “ten returning letter men are the nucleus of Coach Jim Adams’s chargers, three from the 1950 All-Maryland team,” said the 1951 Crusader yearbook. Perhaps the greatest threat to the undefeated season came from the Navy Plebes—tied at three going into the final quarter, George Trautman and Jim Grieves iced the game with a goal each to bring home the 5-3 win.\n\nThese Crusaders dominated the 1951 post-season honors selections. All-Maryland honors, chosen by the coaches, went to defenseman Walter Mitchell, attackman Jim Grieves, and midfielders Evans Leroy Hedges (team captain), George Trautman, and Dick Britt, all of whom were selected to the First Team. Attackman Tom Tanton earned Second Team honors, with Honorable Mentions going to goalkeeper Bob Powell and defenseman Don Scott. The Baltimore Sun MSA selections featured Bob Powell, Walter Mitchell, Leroy Hedges, George Trautman, and Jim Grieves on the First Team; Don Scott and Dick Britt Second Team; Charles Pforr (D), Carl Muly (M), and Tom Tanton on the Third Team. Honorable Mention selections were Larry Menefee and Jerry Bennett.\n\nRecognition of this Crusader lacrosse team is long overdue, as it’s one of the most accomplished in the illustrious history of St. Paul’s lacrosse.\n\n1990-1991 BASKETBALL\n\nOne of the most heralded teams in St. Paul’s history, the 1990-91 basketball squad posted a 29-3 record that was capped off with an overtime win over archrival Boys’ Latin in front of hundreds of screaming Crusader fans at the Baltimore arena. This hard-earned victory brought the MSA C-Conference championship home to Brooklandville. The team compiled a 17-0 record in the C-Conference that also included two regular-season wins over Boys’ Latin, and their 29 victories set a school record for wins in a season.\n\nThough the squad was led by the two captains, Shane Tanzymore ’91 and Rob Bouse ’92, the Crusaders enjoyed great depth thanks to a number of other talented players, including stalwarts Simms Jenkins ’92, Josh Scheinker ’92, and Chip Woelper ’91, winner of the Spirit Award. Tanzymore and Bouse were named to the All-C Conference team following the season. Notably, two of the team’s three losses, to non-conference opponents, were by a combined total of eight points.\n\nAfter losing in the finals the two previous years, Head Coach Rick Collins was determined that second place was not an option. A follower of legendary UCLA Coach John Wooden, Coach Collins strongly believed that “failure to prepare is preparing to fail.” This Crusader team was always well prepared and played with the same intensity their coach took to the floor each day.\n\nCoach Collins created a team chemistry that led to a whole greater than the sum of its parts. “We were all scared of Coach Collins,” recalled guard Josh Scheinker ’92. “If we had a bad first half, he would light into us in the locker room at halftime. But he always got us fired up and got the train back on the tracks. He helped carry us to all those wins.”\n\n1999 GOLF\n\nSt. Paul’s has earned a storied legacy in the annals of high school golf in Maryland. Starting in 1939, the school has annually fielded strong teams that have won 17 MSA/MIAA championships, the first coming in 1941, when the team finished 5-0. But none was more impressive than the 1999 golf team, which completed the campaign as both the MIAA A Conference Golf Dual Meet Champions and the MIAA Stroke lay Tournament Champions.\n\nThis squad, coached by Rick Collins, recorded an undefeated season, finishing 15-0-1. All six team members placed in the top 20 during the MIAA Individual Stroke Tournament, and senior captain Mike Grimm ’99 won the MIAA Individual Championship. “This group of boys put team goals over their personal goals, which was key to their success,” said Coach Collins. “The capability of each player to sacrifice his own ego in order to place the team foremost was instrumental in our championship drive.”\n\nSenior leadership was also a critical factor in the outstanding achievements of this team. Matt Dalbke, Spencer Fastie, Chris Emerick, and captain Mike Grimm were great leaders, and all four were members of two B Conference championship teams during their golfing careers at St. Paul's, in addition to their 1999 success. “These seniors help make our transition from a good B Conference Team to an A Conference power and arguably the best team in the State of Maryland,” said Coach Collins. “This team’s work ethic and passion for the game was unsurpassed.”\n\nSenior captain Mike Grimm won the Wake Forest Golf Award, given annually to the member of the St. Paul’s varsity golf team who most embodies the game’s excellence and tradition.\n\n† Deceased\n\nWayne Eisenhut ’71\n\nWayne Eisenhut arrived at St. Paul’s in 1970 for his junior year with his athletic reputation preceding him. His superior skills in football, as a runner and passer, allowed Coach Mitch Tullai to employ what today is known as a “wildcat” scheme, wherein the center snapped the ball between the quarterback’s legs directly to Wayne, who was lined up as the tailback.Wayne ran for more than 1,000 yards in the 1971 season, his senior year (the only season he played), and passed for almost as many, as the Crusaders grabbed the MSA C Conference championship with a 6-0-1 record, the only blemish a tie vs. Gilman. Wayne, one of the top scorers in the area, earned second-team All MSA honors for his performance.\n\nA first team selection for both the 1971 All MSA and All Metro lacrosse teams, Wayne helped lead the team to a 9-4 finish and the A Conference championship—the Crusaders’ third in a row. Wayne earned High School All-American honors that year, the inaugural year for that recognition. At graduation Wayne received the Best Athlete Cup (later named for George Mitchell) and an Excellence Award in football.\n\nWayne had a stellar college lacrosse career at Towson University, earning All-American honors each of his three years there. In the 1974 national championship game (College Division) against Hobart, Wayne netted five goals and four assists—including the tying and winning goals (the latter in overtime)—in a thrilling 18-17 win.\n\nFollowing his college playing days, Wayne played for the Mt. Washington Wolfpack lacrosse club.\n\nPic Fuller ’39\n\nPic Fuller’s athletic achievements played out on the football and lacrosse fields. He was the left tackle on the 1936 St. Paul’s football team that outscored its opponents 146-2, the only score against the Crusaders coming on a “touchback” by the Franklin Day School, according to the account of the game in the Baltimore Sun on November 15, 1936. St. Paul’s went on to defeat Boys’ Latin in the championship game that year, 12-0.\n\nA bruising fullback and back-up quarterback, Pic helped lead the following year’s squad to another appearance in the championship game. A 19-yard pass reception from quarterback Edgar Boyd in a scoring drive ensured a second consecutive shutout win over Boys’ Latin, this one by 13-0. Pic was selected that year at left tackle for the Baltimore Evening Sun’s 1937 All B-conference team, having “played head and shoulders above the opposition and contributed largely to this team’s success,” said the paper’s tribute. Pic was elected captain of 1938 Crusader team.\n\nPic’s postseason honors in lacrosse included selection to the second team All-Maryland team as “second attack” his junior year and a first-team selection as “out home” (aka second attack) his senior year. He then traveled south to the University of Virginia, where he played football (earning accolades as an All-Southern Conference guard) and lacrosse and boxed as a member of the class of 1944.\n\nPic returned to St. Paul’s in 1945 as a decorated war hero and head football coach and took the head lacrosse coach reins from Howdy Myers in 1947 and 1948. He returned to Charlottesville as the Cavaliers’ varsity lacrosse coach (and freshman football line coach and freshman wrestling coach) for the 1951, 1952 and 1953 seasons. Pic’s stint at the University of Virginia included the school’s 1952 co-national championship (with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)—the first in UVA’s history, in any sport. Pic’s overall record of 21-7, over those three seasons, ranks as the best winning percentage of any Cavalier lacrosse coach.\n\nGavin Gill ’05\n\nA “lifer” at St. Paul’s, Gavin Gill followed in the footsteps of his older brothers as a terrific athlete who helped lead the football and lacrosse programs to championships.\n\nGavin was a three-year starter at quarterback for the Crusaders team who was an important contributor to the 2003 championship team.\n\nGavin’s outstanding performance on the lacrosse field earned him recognition as one of the top players in Crusader history. Earning four varsity letters, he accumulated 233 career points, placing him at #4 on the program’s all-time scoring list (and third in career assists) in the modern era. As a junior he was the leading scorer on the squad that won the 2004 MIAA Championship and earned the number-one ranking in the country.\n\nElected a captain his senior year, Gavin again helped lead the team to the playoffs, earning High School All-American status for his play and ensuring his place as one of the most decorated players in St. Paul’s lacrosse history. Twice he was named both All-Metro by the Baltimore Sun and All-State by the Maryland State Coaches Association. The Towson Times selected him as “Player of the Year” in 2005, the year he was also the St. Paul’s nominee for the Kelly Award, an honor presented annually to the best player in Maryland. Gavin also received the Martin “Mitch” Tullai Head Coaches Cup in 2005.\n\nAfter St. Paul’s Gavin attended the University of Virginia, where he played in the NCAA tournament in each of his four seasons on the lacrosse team. In 2006, his freshman year, the Cavaliers were undefeated at 17-0 and won the National Championship.\n\nSteve Johnson ’05\n\nSteve Johnson became an immediate impact player as a freshman at St. Paul’s, where he started as a second baseman and quickly became the top Crusaders’ pitcher. Steve had an impressive won-lost record of 7-1 with 3 saves that first year on the varsity, and he led the team in both batting average with a .350 average and home runs (3). His most vital contribution that first season in a St. Paul’s uniform was pitching the Crusaders to their first MIAA “A” Conference championship, defeating Calvert Hall in a game played at Camden Yards.\n\nAs a sophomore, Steve compiled an impressive 8-1 record on the mound, with a 1.74 ERA and 57 strikeouts in 60 innings, and again he pitched the Crusaders to a second consecutive MIAA A conference championship, defeating Calvert Hall in the title game. Steve’s .363 batting average made him a threat at the plate as well.\n\nIn 2004 Steve went 9-2 with an astonishing 0.89 ERA and 96 strikeouts in only 70 innings. He blasted 6 home runs while leading the team to the MIAA playoffs for a third consecutive year.\n\nSteve turned in his most remarkable performance on the diamond during his senior year, in 2005. He chose the right day to strike out 20 of 21 McDonogh batters in an early-season game, as more than 50 major league scouts were in the stands. Steve followed that performance with a perfect game against St. John’s. His record on the mound that season was 10-2, notching 130 strikeouts in 83 innings and batted a team-leading .485. The Crusaders finished 18-2 in MIAA play, losing in the playoffs.\n\nFollowing 2005 the season, Steve was drafted in the 13th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles in 2010 and now pitches for the Seattle Mariners. Steve has compiled impressive numbers at the major league level: a 6-1 record with a 4.26 ERA, 76 innings pitched with only 58 hits allowed while striking out 86.\n\nSteve currently holds nine St. Paul’s baseball records.\n\nGordon Jones ’48\n\nGordon Jones was an accomplished athlete at St. Paul’s and a stalwart member of three varsity teams—football and, in his junior and senior years, both basketball and lacrosse.\n\nHe was a starting guard his junior and senior years (1947 and 1948) on Crusader basketball teams that defeated perennial powerhouses such as Poly, Mt. St. Joseph, Forest Park and the Hopkins Frosh and rivals McDonogh, Gilman and Boys’ Latin en route to a 17-4 and 9-3 seasons, respectively. Gordon earned Honorable Mention on the Baltimore Sun’s 1947 All-Scholastic Basketball Team.\n\nGordon was in the thick of the 1947 Crusader lacrosse campaign that finished with a 13-1 record, the sole loss, to Gilman, snapping a 72-game win streak that still stands as the longest such streak in the history of high-school lacrosse. Season highlights included triumphs over the Hopkins Frosh and Navy Jayvee (both by 7-6) and a 15-3 thumping of the Navy Plebes.\n\nGordon’s lacrosse career continued at the University of Virginia, where he was high scorer his junior year and an Honorable Mention All American selection. Gordon captained the 1952 national championship team coached by fellow alumnus Pic Fuller ’39, led his team in scoring and was selected a first-team All-American on attack. 1952 was a banner year for Gordon—he won the Allen F. Voshell Trophy, given to the “the best attackman on Maryland soil”; the Harry Gaver Award for leadership; and the Jack Turnbull Trophy as the outstanding attackman in collegiate lacrosse. He netted four goals in the South team’s victory over the North in that year’s North-South classic at the Polo Grounds in New York.\n\nGordon was inducted into the University of Virginia’s Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\nBaker Koppelman ’86\n\nBaker Koppelman amassed 16 varsity letters during his St. Paul’s career—the first in seventh grade, as manager of the 1979-80 varsity wrestling team that won the MSA A Conference championship (in which Baker was scorekeeper for the dramatic win over Mt. St. Joe that clinched it).\n\nThat experience in middle school launched Baker on an unprecedented Crusader athletic career as a manager of numerous varsity teams and four years playing on the varsity baseball team. As an eighth grader, Baker again managed the varsity wrestling team, ensuring solid preparation for same for both the football and wrestling teams the following year, his first in the upper school.\n\nBaker went on to manage both the 1982 football team that won the Tri-County championship and the 1982-83 B conference division II basketball champs, and he earned a spot on the varsity baseball team as a freshman. In both sophomore and junior years, he again managed those two squads, and though medical issues kept him from the baseball diamond sophomore year, he coached middle school baseball, receiving an Excellence Award for Student Coaching.\n\nAs a fourth-year junior Baker was back in the saddle, overseeing logistics for both varsity football and basketball and rejoining the baseball team that spring. He retained those duties his senior year and was elected co-captain of the 1986 baseball squad. As a pitcher, Baker is tied for most decisions in a season, with 14 in 1986, when he notched a record of 8-6 and set a school record for most innings pitched in a season (89.1).\n\nIn an eight-day stretch in 1986, Baker was the winning pitcher in six games, which included both ends of two double-headers and, thanks to re-entry rules, he earned a save in one of his own wins. Not content merely to pitch, in the last inning of the first game of one of those twin bills, he knocked in the winning run. “I think I also saved my own wins on two other occasions that season,” says Baker, a fitting capstone to a remarkable and most unusual career in the history of St. Paul’s athletics.\n\nRob MacCool ’66\n\nAt a position that gets relatively little attention in a sport that gets plenty, Rob MacCool stood out. Standing almost six feet and weighing in at close to 200 pounds, Rob was an intimating close defenseman on the lacrosse field, a three-year starter who was often assigned to mark the opposing team’s top scorer. An aggressive defender with sound stick skills, his performance in the spring of 1966, his senior year, earned him accolades from both major Baltimore newspapers, as the Baltimore Sun selected him to the First Team on its All Maryland squad, and the Baltimore News American to the second team on its All MSA squad.\n\nRob was a three-sport athlete at St. Paul’s and member of eight varsity teams: football, wrestling and lacrosse. The 1966 yearbook noted that “on the athletic field his talents are seldom equaled,” further describing Rob as “a stalwart ace on the football team and lacrosse team” who “has earned the appellation ‘hard-nose.’”\n\nOn the football field, Rob was a versatile player on the varsity all four years of high school and a significant contributor to the team that recorded a 6-2 record his senior year. That year he switched to guard from the fullback and center spots he’d played his junior year to help anchor the offensive line, playing both ways and punishing opposing running backs as a linebacker. Rob was recognized with a McCormick Unsung Hero Award his senior year.\n\nRob’s outstanding lacrosse career continued at Johns Hopkins University, where—after not playing his sophomore and juniors years—he returned as a senior to earn First team All American honors. Following graduation, Rob played for the vaunted Mt. Washington Wolfpack lacrosse club from 1971 to 1974.\n\nWalt Mitchell ’51\n\n“Big Mitch, one of the most outstanding athletes in this year’s senior class, entered St. Paul’s in the fall of 1945,” reported the 1951 Crusader yearbook about Walter Mitchell, who stood at 6’3” and weighed in at 200 lbs.\n\nWalter was a force on the football and lacrosse fields, Winner of nine varsity letters, he earned All-Maryland football honors as a lineman in both 1948 and 1949, his sophomore and junior years—two of his four years on the varsity. Walter was injured early in the season his senior year and unable to play for most of it.\n\nA towering and physical defenseman on the lacrosse field, Walter earned Honorable Mention recognition on the MSA All-Star team his junior year. He was a first-team All MSA selection his senior year, in 1951, when he helped lead the team to an undefeated season that was capped off by a 9-4 win over Gilman in the championship game.\n\nFollowing service in the U.S. military, Walter’s outstanding lacrosse career continued at Johns Hopkins University, where he earned Honorable Mention as an All-American his sophomore year, then first team All- American honors both his junior and senior years (1957 and 1958). He was a co-captain in both his junior and senior years and, in his senior year, won both the Schmeisser Award, given annually to the nation’s top defenseman; and the Turnbull-Reynolds Award, a Johns Hopkins team award given for leadership and sportsmanship.\n\nTucker Radebaugh ’95\n\nTucker Radebaugh’s impact on the St. Paul’s athletic program became quickly apparent upon his arrival in Brooklandville for tenth grade. Over the next three years he earned varsity letters in football and lacrosse and was elected captain of each in his senior year. Tucker earned the George Mitchell Award as the school’s best athlete and, at graduation, was honored with the prestigious Kinsolving Award.\n\nA standout quarterback, Tucker helped lead the Crusaders in 1992 to a fourth consecutive MSA C-Conference football championship—the team’s 9-0 finish made it one of only four undefeated teams in St. Paul’s history. Tucker was also under center in 1993 for the 7-2-1 squad—the last to be coached by the legendary Mitch Tullai—that tied with Gibbons for the conference championship.\n\nTucker was no less a standout in lacrosse. Stepping in as a starting attackman in his sophomore year, he went on to notch 165 career points, earning All-Metro honors in each of his three years and adding High School All-American accolades for his performance senior year, when he led the team in scoring with 60 points. “Tucker was an iron man for us,” said Coach Rick Brocato. “He was extremely versatile, playing both attack and midfield and facing off.” Tucker made first team All Baltimore County his sophomore year, and in his senior year was the Crusaders’ nominee for the Kelly Award, an honor presented annually to the best lacrosse player in Maryland.\n\nTucker continued his outstanding lacrosse career at the University of Virginia, where he was a two-time captain and an Honorable Mention All-American his sophomore and junior years. As a senior Tucker helped lead the team to the national championship, earning a spot on the All-Tournament team in addition to his selection as a first-team All-American. He was also named the Atlantic Coast Conference “Player of the Year” for 1999.\n\nFollowing graduation from Virginia, Tucker was a first-round draft pick of the MLL’s Boston Cannons. He spent two years as an assistant coach at Virginia. In 2002, Tucker was named to the ACC “Golden Anniversary Team,” joining three other St. Paul’s Hall of Fame alumni who were recognized as among the top players in the history of the league.\n\nHoward Smedley ’41\n\nAs a standout in football, basketball and lacrosse, Howard Smedley earned 13 varsity letters and was selected as the school’s top athlete his senior year (he lettered in varsity football as an eighth-grader). He also found time to run track—one year he won both the broad jump and shot put at an inter-academic track and field meet. Howard was also an exemplary St. Paul’s student, winning the Headmaster’s Award, and was active in a number of clubs and extracurricular activities.\n\nAs a freshman in 1937, Howard helped lead the Crusader football team to its second consecutive B conference championship, earning a spot on the Evening Sun’s All B-conference team as right tackle. Howard anchored the offensive line, and in the 1937 season’s final game, he scored a touchdown in a 47-0 rout of Franklin Day. A tackle who weighed in at 185 pounds his senior year, Howard was chosen as captain of the 1940 Baltimore Sun’s All-Star B-Conference team, with the paper noting that “Smedley, with four years of competition behind him, is a good offensive man, being a first-rate blocker and star downfield under punts, as well as a capable defensive man.”\n\nSt. Paul’s was a B Conference basketball powerhouse during Howard’s era, winning the B conference championship in 1939 and 1940. Local sports coverage described hard-fought games between the Crusaders and the five conference rivals, including Boys’ Latin, Friends and the School of Printing. One story described Howard as “a fine marksman and ball handler, and appears sure to hold his job.”\n\nHoward was a starting defenseman on both the 1940 and 1941 lacrosse teams that won A conference championships. He went on to play lacrosse at the University of Maryland and later became a lacrosse official. The Smedley legacy has continued for two generations, as Howard’s son, Howard Smedley ’67, and grandson Kyle Smedley ’05 (Louis D. Clark Loyalty Cup, 2004 Lacrosse Championship team, Twelve-Sport Award, Football and Basketball Spirit Awards) were both outstanding lacrosse players for the Crusaders.\n\nBryce Smith ’90\n\nBryce Smith is one of the most outstanding players in the storied history of St. Paul’s soccer. A center midfielder and four-year varsity starter, he was selected to the All B conference team both junior and senior years. Bryce was elected captain his junior and senior years at St. Paul’s; his performance senior year earned him the coveted Beernink Award as the team’s most valuable player. He was part of the 1988 All-Conference team that travelled to Ireland and later became a member of the Olympic Development Team.\n\nThe team Bryce joined at Davidson College was a rising national power in Division 1 soccer. There he enjoyed a four-year career as a center midfielder, contributing to the team’s celebrated appearance in the NCAA Final Four his junior year. That run featured wins over perennial powers North Carolina, NC State, Duke and UCLA, prompting the New York Times to marvel at the accomplishments of Davidson’s non-scholarship student-athletes in an article, “22 Educated Feet.”\n\nBryce’s contributions to, and impact on, his teams went beyond any innate athletic ability. “Simply put, Bryce was the hardest working and most unselfish player I’ve ever had during my 19 years of coaching soccer,” said Howard Schindler, a former All-Metro Coach of the Year (2000) who guided the Crusaders to three championships. “A consummate team player, Bryce always worked harder than everyone else and thereby made the work of his teammates that much easier.”\n\nSteve Truitt ’94\n\nSteve Truitt, a 13-year man, was an outstanding St. Paul’s athlete in three sports, earning 12 varsity letters, the George Mitchell Best Athlete Cup his senior year and the 1994 Towson Times Athlete of the Year award. He captained both the wrestling and baseball teams his senior year, in 1994 and finished 18th in the MSA cross-country championships.\n\nA four-year starter on the Crusader baseball team, as a shortstop and pitcher, Steve notched a career batting average of over .300. Trailing 12-7 in the 6th inning against Friends in game two of a three-game semifinal series, the Crusaders rallied to a 13-12 win as Steve knocked in 6 runs and retired four straight batters, earning the win in relief—capping a marvelous season in which he batted .375 with 20 RBIs. At graduation he was among both the baseball program’s leaders in assists and games played.\n\nIt was on the wrestling mat that Steve really excelled, ranking among the school’s best in history. He compiled a remarkable 109-25-1 career record, winning the MSA wrestling championship both his junior and senior years and placing fourth and third as a freshman and sophomore, respectively. Steve was a National Prep All American his senior year, when he lost only once, and upon graduation held the record for the most career wins in St. Paul’s wrestling history. He won the Outstanding Wrestler Award in 1994 and in both junior and senior years was named to both the Baltimore Sun’s All- Metro Wrestling team and the All-Baltimore City team. Steve was the top-ranked wrestler in Maryland (135 lbs.) his senior year.\n\nSteve wrestled for four years at Franklin & Marshall College and has continued his career in the sport by coaching at Loyola Blakefield. With 14 seasons under his belt, he has topped 250 wins as a coach. Steve started a wrestling program in 2000 at St. Ignatius Academy, where he was named the Wal Mart Foundation Teacher of the Year.\n\nBart Wagner ’05\n\nBart Wagner earned nine varsity letters in three sports during his career at St. Paul’s. He was elected a team captain three times, in soccer and lacrosse, and in 2005 was awarded the coveted George Mitchell Award as the school’s best athlete. His remarkable accomplishments in three different sports won him the Towson Times “Prep Athlete of the Year” for 2005.\n\nBart was an outstanding soccer player, a captain in both junior and senior years who garnered All-MIAA recognition for both of those seasons, as stopper and forward. In the winter his natural athleticism and hustle at the guard position vaulted him into a major contributor to the varsity basketball team for two years. A fierce competitor who did all he could to make himself as good as he could be, Bart’s coaches consistently lauded him as a player who made the most of his considerable talents.\n\nAs accomplished as he was in soccer and basketball, Bart’s star shone even brighter on the lacrosse field. A starter at both midfield and attack on the varsity for four years, he helped lead the 2004 squad to a convincing win over Gilman in the MIAA championship game and a finish for St. Paul’s as the nation’s top-ranked team.\n\nBart led the Crusaders in goals scored in his sophomore, junior and senior years. He finished his St. Paul’s career with 154 goals, ranking him third on the all-time list for goals in the modern era—and Bart’s 68 assists place him in the top ten of the school’s all-time scorers in the modern era. His leadership and play earned him both All-Metro and All-State recognition in both his junior and senior years, and he was named a US Lacrosse High School All-American, an honor he shares with just fifteen other St. Paul’s alumni.\n\nFollowing his stellar athletic career at St. Paul’s, Bart enrolled at the University of North Carolina, where he was a four-year starter on attack and led the team in points freshman, sophomore and junior years, finishing with 160. Competing in the NCAA Tournament in all but one season, in his sophomore year he was an Honorable Mention All-American and was named the Tar Heel’s MVP.\n\nTrey Whitty ’99\n\nWilliam Walter “Trey” Whitty earned eight varsity letters during his three years of athletic competition. An outstanding three-sport athlete, he was elected a captain of the varsity football, basketball and lacrosse teams his senior year, awarded the Charles Pforr ’51 Memorial Award as the most improved athlete (junior year) and at graduation won the George Mitchell Best Athlete Award.\n\nTrey won three varsity letters in football and had a significant role in the team’s 1996 championship season. A versatile player, he was a tight end and safety and handled all kicking duties for the Crusaders. Trey garnered All B Conference recognition as a tight end his senior year.\n\nIn his junior and senior years on the basketball squad, Trey was both a captain and won the Thomas Longstreth Award as the team’s top player. Winner of three varsity basketball letters, he helped lead the team to a championship in the 1996-97 season and was awarded the Stephen H. Stoelting Memorial Basketball Award for best exemplifying the spirit, love and commitment to the sport.\n\nIn the spring Trey excelled in lacrosse where he was awarded the George Gelston Award as the team’s top defenseman and earned All-Metro recognition for his play.\n\nFrom St. Paul’s Trey traveled to the University of Virginia, where he earned four varsity letters in lacrosse in an impressive career as a long-stick midfielder. As a junior he was recognized as the team’s unsung hero and, in senior year, was elected a co-captain on the squad that won 2003 NCAA Division I National Champions. Trey’s performance earned him an Honorable Mention All-American selection that year.\n\nFollowing graduation from UVA, the Baltimore Bayhawks of the MLL drafted Trey, who later played for the San Francisco Dragons and Denver Outlaws. Since leaving the professional game, Trey has been an assistant coach for the St. Paul’s team that won the 2004 lacrosse MIA A championship and defensive coordinator for the McDonogh team that won that 2016 championship, the latter earning him recognition as the top assistant coach in Maryland.\n\n1944 Basketball Team\n\nRecord: 17-0\n\nA Conference Champions (MSA)\n\nTop-Ranked Team in the Nation (Lacrosse Magazine)\n\nRecord: 21-2, A Conference Champions\n\nThis 1944 team compiled a record of 21-2, capturing the A-Conference championship while defeating such powerhouses as Poly, Forest Park and Mt. St. Joe. (The research conducted to locate its surviving members and the next of kin of those no longer with us provided insight into much fascinating St. Paul’s history.)\n\nFrom the 1944 Crusader Yearbook:\n\nStarting off with an inexperienced squad numbering only two regulars from last year, the St. Paul’s\n\nbasketball team combined fight and hard work to take the first “A” Conference basketball championship in the history of the school.\n\nIn their pre-league season contests the Crusaders looked impressive with wins over Towson Catholic, Poly, Forest Park and Patterson, but showed little championship possibilities, having to come from behind in most of these tests to win. Most spectacular was the 26-24 tilt with Poly, when Bobby Sandell’s last-second shot gave his team the victory.\n\nThe league season started with a 41-21 triumph over McDonogh, and then the Saints lost their only league contest, to St. Joe’s star-filled aggregation, 22-20. But the Blue and Gold were finished losing in spite of the loss of Ham Bishop, and three straight wins preceded the second meeting with the hitherto undefeated St. Joe squad. This test proved to be one of the highlights of the season, for a flawlessly moving Crusader outfit smashed the surprised Gaels, 46-14. After this the Crusaders went on to win three league tilts; and as St. Joe did likewise, the two squads met for a third time to decide the winner of the private school division of the A Conference. A fighting St. Paul’s outfit, after going behind seven points in the second period, came back to whip the Josephites for the second time, by a 34-26 count.\n\nThis gave the Blue and Gold the right to meet Southern, the public school champ, on the following night in the first of a two-out-of-three series for the A Conference crown. Tired from the previous night’s action, the Saints started off slowly, and were on the short end of a 9-4 count at the first quarter’s end. But paced by Captain Crockett, the Blue and Gold got hot in the second stanza and poured 15 counters through the cords, to take a 19-15 lead halftime lead and hold the Maroon even for the rest of the game to walk off with a 36-32 win. After a day’s rest the Crusaders again met the Bulldogs, and this time showed definite superiority with a 40-29 victory, taking St. Paul’s first A Conference title in basketball.\n\nThese men enter the St. Paul’s Athletic Hall of Fame with an elite group, joining other distinguished Crusaders, and their honor, long in the coming, is very well deserved.\n\nThe Team\n\nJim “Ace” Adams ’46 **, Ham Bishop ’44 ** ++, Charlie Compton 46 **++,\n\nBilly Crockett ’44 (Captain)++, Toby Hoffman ’45 ++, Bill Hooper ’47 **,\n\nTommy Gough, Jr. ’46 **++, Stewart McLean ‘44++, George Mitchell ’44 ** ++,\n\nBobby” Sandell, Jr. ’45 ** ++, Bert Sadtler ’45, John Turner ’44 ++\n\nCoaches\n\nHowdy Myers, Jr. ** ++, Marshall Turner++\n\nManagers: Sloan Griswold ‘47 ++, Ray Gore ’44 ++, Larry Leonard ’48 (asst.), Wyman ’49 (asst.)\n\nTrainer: Jim Boyer ++\n\n** current Athletic Hall of Fame member\n\n++ deceased\n\n1992 Lacrosse Team\n\nA repeat championship is one of the most difficult challenges in sports. Following the success of the 1991 squad, the 1992 varsity lacrosse team did just that, running the table through the MSA’s A Conference—regarded at the time as the nation’s best—and a demanding non-league schedule to an undefeated season and a number-one national ranking by Lacrosse Magazine.\n\nThis squad averaged a nick under 12 goals a game while holding the opposition to just over 6.5 goals per game, both remarkable achievements in their tough conference. But in the midst of a few blow-outs, they won six games by one goal and a seventh by two—a striking testament to their collective coolness under fire. The most significant of those wins, their 9-8 triumph over Boys’ Latin in the rain-soaked, mud-caked championship game in front of 5,000 fans at UMBC, brought the 23rd Crusader lacrosse title home to Brooklandville.\n\nThese 1992 Crusaders, fearfully fast in transition and aggressive defensively, generated tremendous ball movement, remarkable team chemistry and a balanced style of unselfish play that stymied their opponents, who tried everything to counter the boys from Brooklandville. They slowed the pace. They double-teamed. But nothing stopped the Blue & Gold, in a season filled with ferocious rallies and heart-stopping, last-second Crusader saves at point-blank range and opposing shots off the pipe—such as the 7-6 regular season win over Boys’ Latin, when a Laker shot at the buzzer hit the pipe, sealing a third consecutive one-goal win.\n\nDreams of an undefeated season were in jeopardy until the Crusaders scored five of the final six goals to snatch a 10-9 win over Gilman. The lads pumped in four straight tallies to pull away from Calvert Hall in a 12-6 semifinal match, setting up another classic clash with the Boys’ Latin for the championship. The Brooklandville boys were up 8-4 in the third period until the Lakers notched four goals to even the score. After a point-blank Crusader save kept the score knotted at 8, the Crusaders knocked the ball loose during a Laker clear and scored the winner with 1:34 to go, becoming the first MSA team in 20 years to achieve an undefeated season.\n\nNine different Crusaders received All-League/All-Metro recognition, while two were named High School All-Americans. All but three players on the roster went on to play lacrosse in college, where five earned All-American honors and two were inducted into the U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Team: Rob Bouse ’92 (Capt.), Brad Byrnes ’92, Russell Croft ’92, Jeff Derogatis ’92, Patrick Doyle ’93, Joey Gelbard ’92, Dimitri Georgelakos ’92, Ryan Grimes ’93, Jon Hartman ’92, Jack Hubbard ’92, Steve Karvounis ’93, Tom Keratzes ’92, Niels Maumenee ’92, Mac McCulloch IV ’93, Dave Notarangelo ’93, Chas Offutt ’93, Jeff Pacy ’92, Jamie Pollock ’94, Brad Read ’93, Randolph Roulette ’92, Bill Ruhl ’94, Andrew Schnydman ’92, Craig Scornavacca ’92, Ben Seigel ’92, John Solter ’94, Ben Strutt ’93,** Jud Uhlig ’92, Joey Unitas ’93, Michael Watson ’93,** Timmy Whiteley ‘92**\n\nCoaches: Mitch Whiteley**, Vince Bagli, Jay Bond, Rick Brocato, Jamie Louzan, Stewart Ridgely ’86\n\nManagers: Jason Dorshow ’93, Ricky Prior ’94 (statistician), Sean Shafik ‘95\n\nFilm: Karl Mech ‘92\n\nTrainer: Brett Porter\n\nAthletic Director: Curtis Way\n\n** current Athletic Hall of Fame member\n\n++ deceased\n\nHam Bishop ’44\n\nOne of the top lacrosse defensemen to ever spring from the vaunted fields of St. Paul’s, Ham Bishop’s aggressive style of play terrorized opposing attackmen in high school, college and beyond. He anchored the line on the varsity football team and started on the 1943-44 A Conference championship basketball squad, the first in St. Paul’s history. But Ham shone brightest on the lacrosse field. “To watch defensemen like Tom Gough, Ham Bishop and Bob Proutt clear the ball with unerring passes was to watch a live textbook demonstration of that phase of the game,” gushed a Sun writer about the Crusaders’ string of 61 consecutive victories over four years, from 1943 to 1946, and seven straight championships. Ham was a dominating defensive presence on those first two squads, and in 2000 he was named to the School’s 1940’s Decade All-Star Lacrosse Team. Following graduation from St. Paul’s, Ham served in the Army Air Forces before attending Johns Hopkins University, where he continued his stellar lacrosse career as a defenseman on four undefeated Hopkins teams from 1947 to 1950, which meant he never tasted defeat on the lacrosse field in high school or college. Ham is a member of the Johns Hopkins University All-Time Lacrosse Team. Following graduation from the University, Ham played for five years on the Mount Washington Professional Lacrosse Club.\n\nCarl Muly ’53\n\nDuring Carl Muly’s years at St. Paul’s (which began in 1946), he earned eleven varsity letters: four in football, three in basketball and four in lacrosse. Carl played four different positions on the gridiron and, during his senior year, captained the St. Paul’s basketball team. He stood out in particular as a lacrosse stalwart, helping the Crusaders to three consecutive MSA championships, in 1951, 1952 and 1953, earning third-team All-MSA honors in 1951 as “part of a top-grade and talented unit,” reported The Baltimore Sun. Carl was again selected an All-MSA midfielder in 1952. His midfield play in those MSA championship victories in 1951 (defeating Gilman, 9-4, to cap an undefeated season), 1952 (defeating Poly, 6-3) and 1953 (defeating Southern, 4-3) was instrumental in his teams’ successes. The 1951 win over Gilman was a milestone in Crusader lacrosse, for the boys from Brooklandville ended Gilman’s four-year hold on the MSA lacrosse title, returning it to St. Paul’s where it had resided for seven straight years prior. Following graduation, Carl went on to Johns Hopkins University, where he played on the 1957 national championship team. He was selected for the 1957 North-South game, where he played midfield on the South team and went up against Jim Brown, then of Syracuse University, a midfielder on the North team.\n\nBob Ruth ’61\n\nAs a standout both in football and wrestling, Bob Ruth was an outstanding athlete of his era. He was on the varsity football team for three years and captain and a key member of the 1960 squad that posted a 7-1 record, the School’s best in 12 seasons—and one in which they defeated both Gilman and McDonogh. Bob’s selection to the Hall of Fame is especially notable given that in football he was a guard who, recalled coach Mitch Tullai, was “small but proficient, one of the finest of his time.” His superb play on the Crusaders’ offensive line in 1960, during his senior year, helped spring many a running back for long gains, and was widely recognized that season: Bob earned a Sunpapers Honorable Mention All-MSA, the McCormick Unsung Hero Award and recognition as “Athlete of the Week.” His exploits on the wrestling mat also spanned three years. Bob, elected captain his senior year, dominated his 138-pound weight class and was described by his coach, Don Hughes, as the toughest wrestler on the squad. Bob went on to the University of Delaware, where he was a dual-sport athlete for three years, wrestling and playing lacrosse, despite not having played the latter at St. Paul’s. Bob served as captain of both the wrestling and lacrosse teams his senior year at Delaware and earned the university’s W.S. Red Tawes Memorial Award as most improved wrestler.\n\nKirk Unruh ’66\n\nKirk Unruh was one of the outstanding all-around athletes of his era at St. Paul’s. Winner of 10 varsity letters (four in football, three each in basketball and lacrosse) and a starter on all 10 teams, Kirk earned All Private-League First Team honors and All-MSA Honorable Mention as a quarterback in 1965, when he led the Crusaders to a 6-2 record. His lacrosse credentials were even more striking: on attack, he led the team in scoring during his sophomore, junior and senior years. He was selected All-MSA Honorable Mention in 1964 and First Team All-MSA in 1965 and again in 1966, when he led the league in scoring with 54 points and was a unanimous choice for the First Team. A constant threat to feed and score, Kirk helped the Crusaders to the Private School League championship game that year, and his 32 assists led the state. He collected St. Paul’s Excellence Awards in football and lacrosse and, in the autumn of 1965, was the School’s nominee for the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame Scholar-Athlete Award. He won the Head Coaches’ Cup his senior year and served as captain of both Crusader football and basketball teams. Kirk continued his stellar career at Princeton, where as a three-year varsity starter he led the team in assists each year and was selected to the All-Ivy Second Team in 1970. He joined the Brine Lacrosse Club in 1976, where he again became the leader in assists. Kirk served as head coach for the New Jersey Lacrosse Club from 1980 to 1983, and was the U.S. Club Lacrosse Association Coach of the Year in 1981. He served as a selector for the Team USA squad that won the World Games in Baltimore in 1982, and was also assistant coach of Team USA’s Alternate Team that year.\n\nAl Sadtler ’71\n\nWinner of eight varsity letters, Al Sadtler was a force on every team on which he played. Al exploded onto the prep lacrosse school landscape his sophomore year, starting on an attack group that led the team to an undefeated season, an MSA championship and a place in School history as one of the greatest ever. That year he won the Charles Pforr Memorial Cup as most improved player. Al continued his stellar play junior year, leading St. Paul’s to a co-championship while notching the MSA scoring title and landing first-team All-MSA honors. His standout play continued during his senior year, when he captained the team and again earned first-team All-MSA status and finished second in scoring. Again the Crusaders took the MSA co-championship, and Al was chosen a High School All-American. His three seasons on the varsity soccer team culminated in the MSA C Conference title senior year and his selection as an Honorable Mention to the All-Conference team. His two years on the varsity basketball squad were no less distinctive, resulting in a first-team All C Conference selection junior year and an Honorable Mention All-MSA as a senior. Al continued his athletic career on the lacrosse team at the University of Virginia and in 1987 founded the Seminole Lacrosse League in Virginia, which he continues to direct. He was an NCAA Division I lacrosse official for 27 years, working eight NCAA national championship games and many semi-final contests. In 1996 Al’s selection to the NCAA Silver Anniversary Officiating Crew marked his 25 years of service as an official. He officiated in the 1990 World Games of Lacrosse in Perth, Australia. From 1999 to 2000 he was Director of Officials for Major League Lacrosse and from 1975 to 2013 officiated high-school lacrosse in central Virginia. In 2001 Al was inducted into the Virginia Chapter of the U.S. Lacrosse Hall of Fame.\n\nChris Burgin ’74\n\nA prolific athlete, Chris Burgin captured 11 varsity letters—4 each in wrestling and football and 3 in lacrosse—while winning the Alphonse Kelz Memorial Award for outstanding play as a lacrosse midfielder twice, the C. Markland Kelly Award (1974) and the Best Athlete Cup (1974). Chris won election to the 1973 Tri County All-League Team as a linebacker and to the First Team of the News American’s 1974 All-MSA Lacrosse Team. He was a starting running back and linebacker on the 1971 and 1972 Tri-County football championship teams. In his junior year Chris was a key member of the St. Paul’s wrestling team that won the B Conference Division II championship, and he helped lead the team his senior year to a second-place finish, a squad that sustained only one loss. Known as “Suitcase” for his solid physique, Chris was elected captain in both football and lacrosse. He continued his outstanding lacrosse career at the U.S. Naval Academy, where he earned a varsity letter for three consecutive seasons and appeared in the 1975 NCAA Championship game. While at Navy, Chris was awarded the N-Star three times for wins over rival Army. Following his Navy career, he played club lacrosse on the Jacksonville Armadillos for two seasons, in 1987 and 1988, winning the Florida State Championship his first year. In 2001 Chris helped start the inaugural lacrosse program for Episcopal School of Jacksonville, Florida, and during the following decade served as assistant varsity coach, head varsity coach and lacrosse program director. As head coach, he guided the team to two District Championships and an appearance in the Elite 8 round of the Florida State Championship.\n\nPhil Bundy ’84\n\nPhil Bundy is one of the most accomplished golfers in the history of St. Paul’s. Prior to 1983, the School had competed in golf from 1939 to 1941, then again in the mid-1960’s with a small group of avid players. Phil spearheaded the permanent establishment of varsity golf at St. Paul’s in 1983, when as the team captain and #1 player, he led the team to a third-place finish in the MSA and 10-3-1 record; he was low scorer in 12 of those 14 matches. He placed fourth in the MSA Individual Tournament. In his senior year, Phil captained the team to a 14-1-1 record and victories over established programs at Gilman, Boys’ Latin and McDonogh as St. Paul’s won the 1984 MSA Team Championship. That same year he won the MSA Individual Championship by ten shots, a record margin of victory that still stands, and he received the Excellence Award in Golf. Phil also wrestled and played lacrosse, soccer and football during his years at St. Paul’s, and he earned varsity letters in cross country and basketball in addition to golf. Phil played golf at Wake Forest University, where he was a member of the 1986 NCAA Championship Team. In 1991 he established the Wake Forest Golf Award, given annually to a member of the St. Paul’s varsity golf team. Phil plays professionally and is a past champion of the Virginia Beach Open and the Capital Series Championship on the National Golf Tour. He has a golf management and marketing company, founded a not-for-profit organization and has helped expand the game through the development of junior golf.\n\nDavey Patterson ’80\n\nThough a multi-sport athlete, Davey Patterson most distinguished himself as a wrestler, and is today one of only three Crusaders to have won a National Prep School Wrestling Championship, which he did in 1980. Davey finished his career as a four-year starter on the varsity wrestling team with an overall record of 100-10-2 and reached the MSA final all four years, winning it both junior and senior years. He was the runner-up as National Prep Champion his freshman year and voted the Outstanding Wrestler at the MSA tournament his junior year. Davey was an integral member of the undefeated team that won the A Conference championship in 1980, receiving an Excellence Award for wrestling in both 1979 and 1980. He joined the first cross country team at St. Paul’s in 1980, and was an outfielder and pitcher on the first two Crusader baseball teams, in 1979 and 1980. Following graduation, Davey wrestled at Lehigh, one of the nation’s top programs, where in 1983 the team finished among the top five teams in the nation. He then wrestled for a year with the Boston Brawlers professional team, which employed a free-style approach that was a precursor to modern mixed martial arts. Davey thereafter ran a number of marathons around the world and participated in surfing tournaments in Maui.\n\nDavid Blenckstone ’86\n\nDavid Blenckstone was one of the outstanding athletes of his era at St. Paul’s. A leader on teams in three sports, he won nine varsity letters during his years in Brooklandville, in football, basketball and lacrosse. David won the George Mitchell Best Athlete Cup in both his junior and senior years, making him one of the few Crusaders to have won that award more than once. In his senior year he was a co-captain of both the football team, on which he was quarterback; and the basketball team, on which he was a guard. David concluded his basketball career as one of the School’s assist leaders of his time, and as a senior won the Steven Stoelting Memorial Award as the outstanding player on the basketball team. He earned All-Baltimore County honors in lacrosse and played in the Lacrosse for Leukemia All-Star game that year. Following graduation from St. Paul’s, David was on the lacrosse team at University of Delaware, where he played attack. After college, he was the General Manager of the Hagerstown Suns minor league baseball team, from 1997 to 2001 before returning to his high-school alma mater as Assistant Athletic Director and a football and basketball coach, from 2002 to 2010. Since 2010 David has been the Director of Athletics at St. Maria Goretti High School in Hagerstown, MD.\n\nBen Strutt ’93\n\nBen Strutt was a dominant athlete of his time. He was a three-year starter on a varsity football team that won three consecutive C-Conference championships, during which the Crusaders amassed a record of 25-2 and were undefeated during Ben’s senior year. As captain and a tailback, Ben averaged over 100 yards per game junior and senior years and was a leading rusher in the era of Mitch Tullai-coached football. His play as a defensive back helped hold opposing teams that year to a mere 21 points. Ben’s performance won accolades: the Baltimore Sun’s All-Metro team, first team All-City-County Team, a place in the Maryland All-Star game and a National Football Foundation Baltimore Regional Scholarship. Ben was a three-year starting midfielder on a varsity lacrosse team that won MSA A-Conference championships his sophomore and junior years, and with only two losses his senior year, compiled a 34-game winning streak. As a senior captain, he scored 25 goals, more than doubling his junior-year total of 12 goals, and was selected First Team All-Baltimore County and Second Team All-Metro by The Baltimore Sun. The Crusaders finished the season as Lacrosse Magazine’s top-ranked high-school team in the nation. His senior year Ben won the Alphonse Kelz Memorial Cup as the team’s top midfielder and the Head Coaches Cup, and earned a spot in the Maryland All-Star game. He played lacrosse at Princeton, primarily as a defensive midfielder, and was a three-year starter who played in every game for four years on a team that won three NCAA national championships. He notched the game-winning goal in the 1996 NCAA semifinal game against Syracuse and was captain of the 1997 undefeated national championship team that went 15-0. He played professionally for the Boston Cannons in the MLL.\n\nJustin Singleton ’97\n\nJustin Singleton, a top Crusader athlete in the 1990’s, won eight varsity letters, four each in basketball and baseball, from 1994 through 1997. Twice he led the teams in both sports to conference championships: basketball in 1996 and 1997 and baseball in 1995 and 1996, and he captained both teams his senior year. Justin earned first-team All-Conference honors in both basketball and baseball in his sophomore, junior and senior years; and was selected as a first-team All-Metro baseball player in 1996 and 1997. St. Paul’s recognized his outstanding accomplishments in 1997 with the Stephen H. Stoelting Basketball Award, the Crusader Baseball Cup and the George L. Mitchell Best Athlete Cup. Justin was drafted in the ninth round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks but chose to continue his baseball career at Clemson University, where he played from 1998 to 2000 and averaged .292 for the three years. In his freshman year Baseball America recognized him as an Honorable Mention All-American. Justin was captain of the 2000 Clemson baseball team and participated in the College World Series that year. In 2000 he signed with the Toronto Blue Jays as a non-drafted free agent, spending six years as an outfielder in that organization, the last two of which were with the Blue Jays’ Triple A team at Syracuse. In 2004 Justin was a member of the Eastern League championship team, the New Hampshire Fisher Cats, a Toronto Double A team, and in 2005 received the Toronto Blue Jays’ Community Service Award.\n\nWalter Hill ’02\n\nIn an era when St. Paul’s was beginning to see fewer three-sport athletes, Walter Hill played on twelve varsity teams and won eleven varsity letters, in football (4), basketball (3) and baseball (4). He was a senior co-captain of all three teams. As a wide receiver on the 2001 football team, Walter had the most receptions in the Baltimore area and earned first-team honors for both All-MIAA and All-State. In his senior year, he helped the basketball team to the B Conference championship, earning a second-team All-MIAA spot. He then went on to help lead the varsity baseball team to a 25-7 record as an outfielder and the School’s first A Conference Championship, defeating Calvert Hall for the prize at Camden Yards. Walter’s performance on the diamond garnered first-team selections for both All-State and All-MIAA. He was the co-winner of the School’s George L. Mitchell Best Athlete Award and in 2002 played in the Baltimore Touchdown Club All-Star Game. At the United States Military Academy, Walter lettered all four years as a wide receiver on the football team and served as team captain in 2006. He appeared in 48 games during his four seasons and was awarded a Game Ball for a seven-catch, 114-yard performance in victory over Air Force. Walter was known as a fearless receiver: “Even when Hill knows he’s going to get hit, maybe even creamed, by a defender with a clean shot on him…he makes the catch, takes the hit and gets right back up for the play,” gushed a 2006 story on Armysports.com. Walter finished his football career at Army with 87 receptions.\n\nLouis Dorsey Clark\n\nFew men had a greater impact on St. Paul’s in the twentieth century than Louis Clark. His contributions to the growth of the School’s academic programs and development of the values-based culture of St. Paul’s at times overshadow his role in the evolution of the Crusader athletic program. Louis joined the faculty in 1927, and other than a two-year hiatus in business and three years in the Navy during World War II, he served the School for a span of 62 years. He began coaching Little Crusie lacrosse and football teams in the late 1930’s, leading the 130-pound football squad to a championship in 1939. Louis also steered the 1947 LC lacrosse squad to an undefeated season. The 1951 yearbook called him the St. Paul’s “Unsung Coach,” under whom “the lower forms get their first test of competition with other schools,” preparing them for the rigors of the junior varsity and varsity levels. Louis’ lifelong passion for tennis led him to the helm of the program at St. Paul’s in 1967, where he helped produced the first Crusader MSA singles champion, in 1973, and coached the varsity through the 1983 season. Following his retirement from coaching, Louis continued instilling in students the values of discipline, tenacity and integrity that flow from participation in sports at all levels. Athletes at St. Paul’s over the decades surely had no more avid, enthusiastic fan than Louis Clark, who in his unwavering affection for his beloved Crusaders likely attended more games than anyone in the history of St. Paul’s.\n\nDon Hughes\n\nFollowing a stellar athletic career at Towson State Teachers’ College (now Towson University) that landed him in the University’s Athletic Hall of Fame for both wrestling and soccer, Don Hughes arrived at St. Paul’s in 1957 as varsity wrestling coach. In his first year, Don immediately guided the Crusaders—who comprised the first team at the varsity level in School history—to an undefeated season in 1957-58. That year produced the first of six St. Paul’s wrestlers to win MSA championships during Don’s tenure as head coach. Don remained as varsity coach in Brooklandville for the next twelve years, posting impressive won-loss records his last three years of 8-3, 9-2 and 10-1, respectively. During his years at St. Paul’s, he also coached the first of three National Prep School Champions in School history and several Lehigh Champions. Don, a member of the Middle School faculty during many of those years, also started the Junior Wrestling program for younger students, who were able to earn valuable wrestling experience at the high-school level. Don was awarded an Athletic Appreciation Cup at the 1969 St. Paul’s Varsity Athletic Dinner for his significant contributions to the growth and development of the wrestling program at St. Paul’s.\n\nTom Longstreth\n\nTom Longstreth’s tenure as a St. Paul’s coach was one of the longest in School history. Tom joined St. Paul’s in the fall of 1962 and was varsity basketball coach from 1965 to 1986, bringing his experience as an outstanding player in high school and college to benefit hundreds of energetic Crusaders. His teams accrued a winning percentage of over .500 in several different conferences, earning many victories against much larger schools. Tom was on the varsity football coaching staff for three years (1966-1968) and was part of the 1966 C Conference championship team that was inducted into the third class of the School’s Athletic Hall of Fame. He went on to great success as varsity baseball coach, taking a program that began as a club in 1979 to varsity status in 1981. Serving as head baseball coach from 1981 through 1993 meant that for six seasons he coached two varsity sports in consecutive seasons, a rare feat. Tom won back-to-back C Conference baseball championships in 1989 and 1990, with a record of 16-1 in the latter year. The Crusaders opened the 1991 season in the B Conference, and Tom remained at the helm for three additional seasons before stepping down. He was as versatile a coach as he had been an athlete, also coaching football and lacrosse at the younger ages to prepare boys for the rigors of varsity competition. After retiring from St. Paul’s, Tom returned to campus to help coach Middle School basketball, teaching younger Crusaders the lessons—on and off the court—that so many older boys had absorbed from him over the decades.\n\nHoward Schindler\n\nThe many ways Howard Schindler has served St. Paul’s since he joined the school in 1976 include, but are not limited to, significant and lasting contributions to the growth and success of soccer in Brooklandville. He was head varsity soccer coach for fifteen years (1986-2000), a span when his teams won three championships (1995, 1997, 2000) and reached the championship game in four other years (1988, 1996, 1998, 1999). Howard’s selection as both the All-City/County and All-Metro Coach of the Year in 2000 recognized his achievement of having reached the championship game for six consecutive years. Prior to his stint as head varsity soccer coach, Howard was assistant varsity coach for four years (1982-1985), with the team winning the B Conference championship in 1983. He finished with an overall record as head coach of 150-103-21, a .570 winning percentage. Howard’s other contributions to athletics at St. Paul’s include serving as head coach of frosh-soph lacrosse for 14 years (1977-1990), winning a championship in 1984, and as an assistant coach for the junior varsity ice hockey team in 2002 and 2003. His service as assistant varsity lacrosse coach at SPSG for three years (2006-2008), where he won a championship in that first year, was a further example of his coaching versatility. Howard coached a number of Middle School athletic teams over the years and is presently head coach of the Crusader club lacrosse team, a position he assumed in 2011.\n\n1966 Football\n\nThe 1966 football team is one of the most accomplished in the long history of St. Paul’s athletics. Compiling a record of eight wins against only one loss, against teams from much larger schools, this group won the C Conference championship. They amassed 315 points while yielding only 57, defeating powerhouses Northern, Mervo and John Carroll along with traditional rivals Gilman and Boys’ Latin. The squad’s lone loss came in the form of a 9-0 disappointment to McDonogh, which took advantage of key injuries and eight Crusader turnovers. Five players earned All-Conference honors, and one an All-MSA selection. The squad of only 30 players was coached by Neale Smith ’58, Tom Longstreth and head coach Mitch Tullai, who even today believes that—given the points scored/points yielded and the strength of schedule—St. Paul’s has never fielded a better football team.\n\nRichard L.

Not only did this squad roll over powerhouse programs such as Dunbar, Poly and, notably, Mt. St. Joseph, it placed first in both the Mercersburg and John Carroll Tournaments and second in the Belair Tournament. The Crusaders boasted an average of more than 42 points per match, with an average margin of victory of almost 32 points in each. Many were not experienced wrestlers, grappling only during the winter to stay in shape for other sports, making this team’s achievement all the more remarkable. The season’s highlight came on January 29, 1980, when the Crusaders ended Mt. St. Joseph’s run of six consecutive A-Conference championships with a stunning 31-29 win in "
