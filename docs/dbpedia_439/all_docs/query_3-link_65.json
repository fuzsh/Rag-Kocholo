        "text": "By Hugh Leask\n\nAl Dhabi Capital, a United Arab Emirates-headquartered global long/short equity hedge fund, has built a key position in Milan-based luxury fashion house Moncler.\n\n“It is very important to pick the right stocks at the right valuation in order to make outsized gains, and we believe that the Moncler stock at the current valuation presents such an opportunity,” Rashmi Garg, senior portfolio manager of Al Dhabi Capital’s Global Long/Short Fund, said recently.\n\nEstablished in 2017, the Abu Dhabi-registered fund manager has close to $700 million in assets, focusing on multiple sectors and geographies.\n\nOne important bet for the firm is a long position in luxury brand Moncler, which Garg said can deliver a 43% upside from its current valuation, despite recent challenges. The company’s stock price tumbled 20% following its first quarter results statement earlier this year, when it fell short of its 30% like-for-like retail target, achieving just 18%.\n\nThe bright side of a brand\n\nYet such issues are “fully rectifiable,” according to Garg. “We are confident in the performance of the brand in the coming quarters.”\n\nMoncler continues to boast a strong heritage, quality, recognizability, exclusivity, as well as a “very carefully engineered scarcity” which enhances its desirability for customers, Garg said. “If this is combined with a strong and visionary leadership, you have the perfect recipe for a luxury brand,” she explained. “We believe Moncler has all of these attributes”.\n\nOutlining her position at the 10th annual Sohn London investment conference late last year, Garg discussed organic sales growth and distribution, both of which she identified as vitally important in the luxury sector, an area she has specialized in for more than 15 years.\n\nShe also highlighted Moncler’s successful diversification into areas such as knitwear and footwear recently, noting that when the company IPO’d in 2013, only 10% of the revenues were coming from other categories. “Now that number is at 26%,” she said. “This is important in recruiting new customers to the brand.”\n\nThe wide-ranging pitch discussed Moncler’s acquisition of Italian streetwear brand Stone Island; its ongoing Genius project, which involves collaborations with the fashion, arts, music and technology spheres; and its related social media marketing campaign.\n\nGarg also delved deeper into Moncler’s strategy of converting its wholesale presence in Nordstrom and Saks to retail, in line with its broader wholesale-to-retail shift.\n\nShe noted that, as of Sept. 30, 2023, Moncler had 262 directly-operated stores, which suggests it has the capacity to open another 100 stores, in line with other similar names in the luxury sector, to further add to the top line of the brand.\n\nA geographic framework\n\nGarg noted that just 30% of the company’s revenues come from the U.S., with the remainder from the EMEA and Asia regions, which she said are the two most important regions for the brand.\n\n“If you look at the geographical breakdown of the stores, only 16% of these stores are in the U.S. Moncler is still underrepresented in China,” she added. “These two are very important luxury markets and expansion in these geographies should really help the top line.”\n\nMoncler is also set to benefit from the return of Chinese tourists to Europe, where its products are cheaper than in mainland China, as well as burgeoning interest in China in outdoor pursuits such as skiing and camping.\n\n“A lot of people will think it is rather counterintuitive to pitch a luxury stock at this point in time,” Garg observed, noting multiple downgrades in the sector in recent weeks. “However, in my experience, I believe this is the best time to buy these quality stocks and to invest in them.”\n\nThis article, “Long/short fund Al Dhabi outlines ‘counterintuitive’ Moncler trade” was originally published on January 9th, 2023 on Alternatives Watch and is republished here with permission from BMV Digital, Inc."
