        "text": "The Australian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and Consulate-General in Dubai advance Australia's foreign policy, security, international development, trade, investment and business interests in the UAE and foster a strong partnership between the governments and people of Australia and the UAE.\n\nA broad range of Australian Government departments are represented, reflecting the strength and diversity of our bilateral relationship. They include the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defence, the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.\n\nThe Embassy and Consulate promote Australian culture and offer passport and consular services to Australian citizens living in or visiting the UAE. The Embassy in Abu Dhabi provides consular services to Australians in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai to those in the northern Emirates.\n\nBilateral relations between Australia and the United Arab Emirates\n\nBilateral relations between Australia and the UAE are warm, multi-faceted and growing rapidly. They are underpinned by extensive trade relations, and the UAE is Australia’s largest Middle East trade and investment partner. We enjoy good defence, aviation security and law enforcement cooperation, the latter underpinned by agreements on mutual legal assistance in criminal law matters and extradition. Our defence relationship with the UAE is strong and enduring. The UAE provided generous support to Australian evacuations from Afghanistan.\n\nThe bilateral relationship is underpinned by enduring people-to-people links. Over 300 Australian companies are operating in the country. Numbers of Australians in the UAE have dropped in recent years, coinciding with reduced flights throughout the pandemic. Emirates and Etihad Airlines continued to operate services to Australia during the pandemic, owing to their view of the long-term importance of the Australian market.\n\nThe Australian Ambassador to the UAE is based at the Australian Embassy in Abu Dhabi. Australia also has a Consulate-General/Trade Commissioner in Dubai. State government offices representing New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia are also based in the UAE.\n\nMr Ridwaan Jadwat\n\nAustralian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates and Special Envoy to the OIC\n\nMr Jadwat is a senior career officer with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). He was most recently the First Assistant Secretary, Middle East and Africa Division, and has held the role of Australia’s Special Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation since December 2018.\n\nMr Jadwat was Australia’s Ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain and Yemen from June 2018 until December 2020. Mr Jadwat has also served at Australian missions in Tehran (Deputy Head of Mission) and Kuala Lumpur (Counsellor).\n\nPrior to his appointment as the head of the Middle East and Africa Division in March 2023, Mr Jadwat was the Head of the Southeast Asia Division and the Southeast Asia Maritime Division in the Office of Southeast Asia.\n\nMr Jadwat was seconded to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet from 2015-2018 and served as Assistant Secretary, South and South-East Asia, Americas and the Middle East, International Division, and as the Head of Policy in the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit Taskforce.\n\nMr Jadwat holds a Bachelor of Economics (Social Sciences) and Bachelor of Laws (Honours) from the University of Sydney, and a Graduate Diploma in Foreign Affairs and Trade from Monash University.\n\nPublic Holidays Closure - 2024"
