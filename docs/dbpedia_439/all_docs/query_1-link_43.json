        "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a nation in the Middle East that is located near the Strait of Hormuz. It shares land borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia, and is well connected to other Gulf nations such as Qatar and Bahrain. It faces the Persian Gulf to the West, which is a major maritime trade route.\n\nThe UAE is formed from 7 Emirates- Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, and Umm Al Quwain. Abu Dhabi is the capital while Dubai is the most populous Emirate.\n\nThe UAE is part of several inter-governmental corporations such as the UN, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Arab League, and OPEC. The nation has large reserves of petroleum and natural gas. The petroleum reserves are ranked 6th in the world, while the natural gas reserves are ranked 7th.\n\nThe main sources of income are oil and tourism. The ports in the UAE are connected to other transport methods via road and air. The 2 national carriers- Emirates and Etihad Airlines, operate dedicated cargo and freight shipments from these ports to all over the world. Tourism, Oil, and the industrial sector are the main sources of revenue to the UAE.\n\nGiven its vast maritime importance, ports in Dubai and the UAE have played a major role in the development and growth of the country. In this article, we will look at the top 10 ports of the UAE. The Locode and Emirate are also mentioned.\n\nThese ports are the major shipping hubs spread throughout the various emirates. Note, the Locode begins with the prefix AE- indicating a port located within the territorial waters of the UAE.\n\nThe ports in this list are grouped in terms of the Emirate it belongs to. In Arabic, the term “Mina” means port or harbour. Most ports are also referred to by using Mina – before its name. So, for example, Port Khalifa (in Abu Dhabi) is also known as Mina Khalifa.\n\n1. Port Khalifa (AEKHL)\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nAs the flagship port in Abu Dhabi, Port Khalifa is one of the largest deepwater harbours in the world. Located near the Taweelah offshore port, it is currently under construction and aims to be completed by 2030. It is part of the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD) that serves the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi and stretches out to sea on a reclaimed island. The Industrial Zone covers over 400 square kilometres and generates significant cargo and container traffic.\n\nPort Khalifa is aimed at replacing cargo operations from Mina Zayed and has already begun handling container vessels diverted from Port Zayed. The proposed construction has been divided into 5 phases.\n\nPhase 1 was launched in 2012 following the inauguration of the port in September. Phase 2 was launched in 2013. These phases will be completed by 2020 and 2021 respectively and will double the current container handling capacity.\n\nThe port services container vessels through a 30-year contract with Abu Dhabi Terminals (ADT) that currently processes 1.5 million TEUs annually. The present capacities are 2.5 million TEUs and 8 million tons of cargo.\n\nPost completion of all phases, the port will be able to handle 15 million TEUs and 30-35 million tons of cargo. Dredging activity has created a 16-meter-deep harbour. As it is an artificial island, port Khalifa is connected to the mainland by a causeway that is located off the Ras Ghanada Coral Reef.\n\nThe port will have a 7.4 km quay, 22 container berths, 63 general cargo berths, and 6 dry bulk berths. It is fully equipped with customs, immigration, inspections, and security services. The port has stressed on technology and automating the infrastructure.\n\nThe container terminal is semi-automated, inventory stacks are fully automated, and tracking services are integrated into cargo shipments. 25-plus shipping lines operate from this port to 70 international destinations.\n\nThe port has 42 automated stacking cranes, 20 straddle carriers, and 12 ship-to-shore cranes in operation. These 12 STS Super Post Panamax cranes were supplied by Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries (ZPMC) and are the largest in the world as of 2016.\n\n2. Mina Zayed (AEMZD)\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nPort Zayed is an important deep-water seaport of Abu Dhabi that has been operational since 1972. It services a large portion of vessels plying on the Gulf Coast and lies on an area of 25 square kilometres. The old container terminals occupy nearly 10% of the total area and are built to store up to 15,000 TEUs.\n\nFollowing the complete transfer of container handling to Port Khalifa, these terminals are now defunct. There are rows of storage warehouses that contain general cargo, breakbulk, and use temperature controls to keep transit goods at peak condition.\n\nMina Zayed also allows companies to store and distribute goods from directly within the port premises, reducing transit times. A chilled storage zone caters to over 15,000 tons of frozen imports and exports.\n\nThe port has 21 berths for ro-ro, project cargo, reefer units, general cargo, and petroleum products. The initial 17 berths were expanded to service a larger number of vessels and process more cargo tonnage.\n\nThe quay length extends over 3 kilometres and has a maximum anchorage depth of 15 meters. However, berths 10 to 13 are just 6 meters deep, and they are only used by low draft vessels that carry the minimal load.\n\nVessels inbound to Mina Zayed can refuel directly from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) fuel bunkers that offer reduced rates. The port also has an engineering division on the call for vessel repairs and servicing.\n\nThere is also a Dhow Harbor located close to Mina Zayed. Vessels such as rig supply crafts, tug vessels, pleasure dhows, personal crafts, and small motorized launches berth here. The harbour is serviced by ADNOC, has equipment for service and repairs, and also has a direct connection with Port Zayed.\n\nThe erstwhile container plans were scrapped following the opening of Port Khalifa in September 2012. The now-closed facilities include 800 meters of quay, several heavy-duty cranes, and the proposed Saadiyat Island expansion plan.\n\nThis satellite port facility was planned to double as a Free Trade Zone, from where a larger number of container ships could be handled. To recover these, Abu Dhabi Ports plans to convert Port Zayed into a luxury cruise hub. AIDA and Celebrity Cruises have already begun cruise services from this port, and efforts have been made to convert it into a passenger port.\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nTop 14 Major Ports in Italy\n\n15 Major Ports in Spain\n\n10 Major Ports in the Republic of Yemen\n\n3. Musaffah Port (AEAMF)\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nBased out of the Musaffah Industrial Zone, this port is the 2nd oldest port in Abu Dhabi after Mina Zayed. It is a deep-water harbour that runs along the 53-kilometre Musaffah Channel. This channel provides a navigable canal through which the port is directly linked to the Persian Gulf. Dredging operations are underway to increase the channel draft.\n\nMusaffah is a predominantly industrial district, and the same goes for the port. Passenger facilities are minimal here. There are several industries and factories that line the port face. These include steel machining, shipyards, rig and offshore constructions, dredging, commercial construction, and shipping.\n\nMusaffah Port has advanced facilities to handle the various cargo vessels inbound. It can handle general cargo, breakbulk, solid bulk, and ro-ro ships. There are also large commercial warehouses which can be leased for storage and distribution of goods by companies within the port.\n\nThe facility is well connected to the surrounding regions by road and rail. The Etihad Rail project that is aimed at national rail connectivity has placed port networks as one of its objectives.\n\nMusaffah is one of the ports that received the first links, alongside Jebel Ali and Mina Khalifa. This will create connectivity to neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as to other ports for transhipment. It is also connected by road to the Abu Dhabi International Airport.\n\nThis port is also the headquarters of the Abu Dhabi Ports Maritime Training Centre that offers international certification to mariners. The course is globally accredited by Lloyd’s Register and the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA).\n\n4. Port Jebel Ali (AEJEA)\n\nDubai\n\nMina Jebel Ali is a major port in Dubai, with over 15 million TEUs shipped in 2019.

It was the original terminal that the port operated from.\n\nT2 can hold 6.5 million TEUs with 32 cranes and 8 berths. It is reputed for cutting on carbon emissions by a staggering 30%. T3 has 5 berths and can hold 3.8 million TEUs. It is highly advanced, with semi-automatic cranes that can process Ultra Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) that store over 18,000 TEUs. The proposed terminal T4 will add 3.1 million TEUs to the existing facilities.\n\n5. Mina Rashid (AEDXB)\n\nDubai\n\nPort Rashid is an important passenger and cargo port in Dubai and was the first commercial port in the Emirate. It handled container and cargo operations until they were shifted to Jebel Ali.\n\nThe port was opened in 1972 as a small trading harbour, with a capacity of less than 0.1 million TEUs. Today, it boasts of a 1.5 million TEU capacity alongside state-of-the-art technology and new equipment. It is owned and managed by DP World.\n\nThis hub is gradually being converted into a fully passenger and cruise port in Dubai. Jebel Ali began handling cargo operations from 2008 and operations were completely shifted by 2018. Mina Rashid is currently under expansion and redevelopment.\n\nIt handles ro-ro, ro-pax, general passenger, and cruise vessels. There are also minor cargo operations at the port premises. Extensive real estate development is planned along the waterside to convert the port into a major tourism site.
