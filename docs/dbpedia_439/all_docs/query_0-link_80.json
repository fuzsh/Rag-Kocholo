        "text": "We work closely with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in many areas of political and practical co-operation. In September 2021 the UK and the UAE launched a new ambitious Partnership for the Future framework that will strengthen the deep and historic relationship. The Partnership will ensure both countries work closely together on shared global challenges, promote prosperity and security in the region, and expand the exchange of knowledge, skills and ideas.\n\nFind out more about our work on the UK and the UAE news page.\n\nGetting help in the UAE\n\nIf you need urgent medical help or are a victim of crime, call the local emergency services on 112.

They will tell you what your policy covers, and what you need to do to make a claim.\n\nIn many situations, you will be able to help yourself without needing to contact the British Embassy. Check our guidance on:\n\nfinding English-speaking lawyers, funeral directors and translators and interpreters in the UAE\n\ndealing with a death in the UAE\n\nbeing arrested in the UAE\n\ngetting help if you’re a victim of crime\n\nwhat to do if you’re in hospital\n\ntravel advice for the UAE\n\nIf you need urgent or emergency assistance\n\nWe can help British nationals in emergencies in the UAE.

If you have any questions about the application process or your visa status, contact UK Visas and Immigration.\n\nA Schengen visa or residence permit does not entitle you to travel to the UK without a visa. You can check whether you need a visa and apply for one.\n\nOfficial documents and services we provide\n\nWe provide a limited range of notarial and documentary services when local notary publics, solicitors, or lawyers cannot provide them. You will need to pay a fee for these services.\n\nWe do not provide legalisation services at the embassy (such as certifying a photocopy of a passport).
