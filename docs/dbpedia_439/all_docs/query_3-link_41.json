        "text": "I bought a Peugeot sports model from Al Naboodah's Sheikh Zayed Showroom. I first went to the showroom just for window shopping, but the staff who received me at the showroom and introduced me to the car, left such an impression that I didn’t leave without signing a cheque for the car, which I gave to my son. What is surprising is that my wife and I are always looking for a chance to drive it even though we each have luxury cars of our own. The Peugeot drive and reliability is second to none, and the sales and after sales service of Al Naboodah Peugeot has been a great experience.\n\nAbdullah Al MandhariCEO and Chairman of the BoardEnhanced Oil Recovery LLC\n\nWe have been dealing with Swaidan Trading for the past several years, and we are very happy with their after-sales service and quick responses to our requirements. We would definitely recommend the Peugeot brand in terms of adding value to your rental business.\n\nJoji VargheseCorporate Sales ManagerCar Fare Rent-a-car\n\nWe're very happy with our Ashok Leyland vehicle, as the passenger capacity is more than in other brands, and there is good ground clearance. The AC works well even with the engine switched off, as the AC motor is separate from the engine. Also, the gear changes are smooth and easy.\n\nArabian Packaging\n\nI have driven many different buses over the last six years, but I have found Ashok Leyland buses different to them all. It is smooth on the road, and the spare parts are readily available when needed. Most importantly, the service centres are in easy locations, so if we face any issues, it is solved in a timely manner.\n\nMai Dubai\n\nWe are very satisfied with the performance and professional attitude of the SMKA team (in particular Mr. Mohamed Fathi) with regards to the supply of light fittings for various projects, including the prestigious Zabeel Mosque. We are extremely delighted that the lighting has come out really well on the mosque. Our experience with SMKA was excellent. The staff were very professional and knowledgeable, and the electrical fittings selected from them were top quality products. Their personalised lighting product solutions really provide a nice ambient and beautiful appearance. We would happily recommend SMKA to all of our clients, and are more than happy to include SMKA in our recommended vendor lists.\"\n\nAjmad Nassar, Managing Director, GCE Consultants\n\nOur experience with SMKA has been great. They are very responsive and flexible in working with our schedule. Many thanks to you, and we hope that you will continue to provide exceptional service going into the future, and we look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship\n\nStreamline Electromechanical Works LLC\n\nI have been fitting out my villa, and I bought all of my electrical and lighting items from SMKA. I visited other shops in Dubai, but I made the decision to buy from SMKA because of the professional staff and their extensive knowledge of electrical and lighting products. They\\'re also friendly and supportive, from the salesperson Mr. Rizwan to the higher level staff such as the manager, who took a personal interest in my project. The prices were also very good.\n\nDr. Riyaz Badami, Good Living Medical Centre\n\nOur experience with SMKA was excellent. The staff were very professional and knowledgeable, and the electrical fittings were top quality products with a stylish and premium feel. We were impressed with the home automation systems, which control the lights, curtains, room temperatures and more from a tablet - they really impress our clients!\n\nChance Electromechanical Works LLC\n\nWe are more than satisfied with your company regarding the technical discussions, BOQ preparations, estimates, approvals, delivery schedules and coordination during the installation activities from Phase 1 to Phase 4 of the Swiss International School project, Al Jaddaf, Dubai. This is one of our most prestigious and fast-track projects, and your support on LED solutions has been commendable. We look forward to working with you in our future projects.\n\nAl Ahmadiah Contracting and Trading\n\nNot only does Al Naboodah Group Enterprises sell Kaeser compressors, we also stand firmly behind the brand with a fleet of 80 Kaesers in our own plant portfolio. We believe in the quality of the Kaeser brand as a stable, family-owned manufacturer. The ANGE fleet of air-powered compressors is 100% Kaeser, which we commonly use on our own civil engineering projects.\n\nMartin Ashfield\n\nThe versatility and mobility of the Sennebogen telescopic crawler cranes supplied to us by Al Naboodah Group Enterprises have made them extremely effective for a wide range of situations. They can be easily transported between sites and put to work within minutes of being rolled off the trailer, and have the added advantage of pick-and-carry capabilities.\n\nMartin Ashfield\n\nClark Forklifts have been around for a century, and have a good reputation for solid build quality and reliability. When we buy Clark products from Al Naboodah Group Enterprises, we can forget about them – they don’t give us any cause for concern for the duration of their working life.\n\nMartin Ashfield\n\nWe’ve had a Maxus G10 modified for wheelchair access since October of last year, and so far our experience has been excellent. I have been very pleasantly surprised by the ride quality and driving experience. It doesn’t feel like a big van, it’s comfortable and nice to drive. In terms of quality and value-for-money, I would highly recommend the Maxus van conversion. I haven’t seen anything else on the market that can match it.\n\nEmma Copson\n\nI am very happy with the Maxus V80 van we bought from Al Naboodah Group Enterprises, and 100 percent satisfied with the quality of services provided. Our treatment by the staff at the service centre is very nice and I always receive the vehicle in good time.\n\nCompany : Potential Electromechnical\n\nWe use a Wingle for the day-to-day needs of our family, transporting groceries, equipment or furniture, whatever is required. It’s an extremely useful and reliable vehicle, and we have had no problems with it whatsoever in over 20,000 kilometres.\n\nShaikha Al Naboodah\n\nI am very satisfied with Wingle\\'s products and services. The vehicle\\'s consumption of petrol is low compared to other brands, and it also has a more powerful engine and structure. I have been using it for more than one year and so far I have come across no issues.\\r\\n\n\nMr Shah Hussain from Al Khaznah - Company (Al Ain)\n\nI like the Wingle pickup because it is less expensive than its competitors. Also, the service facilities are very nice, and if there are any issues, they are sorted out and cleared quickly.\n\nJaswan\n\nI have been using a Wingle pickup for the last four years. The vehicle is very comfortable, and I feel relaxed driving it even on long journeys. The AC performance is good, always cooling well. I mostly drive the vehicle to Abu Dhabi and Dubai from Al Ain, and I haven\\'t come across any overheating issues at all. I have used the standard tyres for about three years without any issues.\n\nMr Rasheed\n\nWe have been using Wingle pickups for more than two years now. The vehicle has proven very commercially viable for us, providing positive returns on mileage. The fuel consumption and maintenance costs are within our budget, and the support from the team at ANGE has been excellent. In addition, feedback from our customers has been good as well.\n\nJayan Warrier - FInance and Administration manager Progress Rent a Car\n\nOn behalf of INKAS Vehicles we would like also to express our gratitude to Al Naboodah Travel for the great relationship and support that has been provided in the past year. All of our request for visas and tickets have been completed in a timely manner, and the support received from you and your team has been very professional and extremely appreciated. We will be referring your company and services to all of our partners, suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nHassan Raza, HR Manager, INKAS Vehicles\n\nThank you for the quality of service provided by Al Naboodah Travel. I sincerely appreciate your efficient and gracious customer service, the level of detail and accountability you have demonstrated each time, and the way you conduct business as a whole. We will continue to recommend your service to other companies and contacts.\n\nIkram Megutof, Executive Assistant, Abdul Latif Jameel International DMCC\n\nAl Naboodah Travel & Tourism did an excellent job of organising my recent vacation abroad. The suggestions that the travel agent provided demonstrated the vast years of experience that they have in the travel & leisure Industry. I would recommend\n\nAl Naboodah for arranging a superb itinerary for a memorable vacation that can be cherished forever. Keep up the good work!\n\nJustina Abraham"
