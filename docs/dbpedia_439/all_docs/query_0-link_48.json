        "text": "Well located, amazing attention and details!\n\nI went with my husband and 2 daughters (14 and 15). The stuff at the hotel is so amazing! Everyone with a smile and willing to help you all the time, at breakfast they even say hi by our name, that was incredible. The pool was perfect, the food delicious, the rooms impeccable! The only reason I don't give a 10 is because we have problems with our shower... the first time that we call it was fixed almost immediately, but then we have the problem again...we call for 2 days and it was never fixed! We had to use the shower of our daughter's room...\n\nWell located but had issue with the fast checkout\n\nSecond time in this hotel, well located near Dubai mall. They stay was ok, but fast checkout was not ok, it end up after 3 weeks I still not get the invoice and when I asked for it they simply calculate as the extras was perfectly match the deposit I block on the card at the check in... exactly same at the penny... sounds weird... lucky were not big money, but doesn't look professional."
