        "text": "My testimony to Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum remains inadequate; I shall not be able to pay him his dues no matter what I say.\n\nHe is the Leader, the Mentor, the Father, the Man. I learned from his school… and I still learn and discover new things from him every day.\n\nFor years gone by, I accompanied him, and so much I learned from him -- not only in the field of government administration, which he masters in a unique fashion of his own that has become a model to follow in achieving excellence -- but rather in the many other aspects of life that vary between practical matters such as ambition, commitment and that sense of responsibility, and the personal characteristics like modesty, discipline, wisdom, patience and application of true consultation before taking any decision.\n\nHard, at a stretch, day-to-day work is Mohammed bin Rashid’s routine. This is what gives him contentment and happiness. When it comes to the nation’s economic and social welfare, he is keen to follow up on every detail. His prime concern and ultimate objective in life is the development and the interest of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nHis Highness the Vice-President enjoys a unique humanitarian side that is not limited to his role as a father for his own family - but is rather extended to give that sense of fatherhood for the entire nation… to all our citizens.\n\nHe has always been keen to follow up on concerns and matters of the people. His contact with the public is not limited to official channels - he insists on availing every possible opportunity to establish direct contact with the people. This community-based communication approach has won him the love of citizens and expatriates alike.\n\nI learned from Mohammed bin Rashid that leadership is not a privilege but rather a responsibility.\n\nI also learned from him that patriotism manifests in hard work and selfless dedication.\n\nHe taught me that through commitment, we can achieve excellence, and through excellence we can sustain superiority in all aspects of life… that we can stand up to our people’s expectations and ambitions under the wise leadership of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan."
