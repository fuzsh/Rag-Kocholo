        "text": "The Grand Cordon is a quarterly competition among US NOBU bar teams working with a featured ingredient. The recipes are recreated, judged and the winning cocktail is featured on all menus in the US along with the bartender and their location.\n\nThis season nationwide winner is Evan Santos from Nobu Downtown with:\n\nDOS DASHI: A mezcal-based cocktail featuring Dos Hombres Mezcal. Evan was inspired by the Nobu culinary team and more specifically, his favorite seasonal dish â€“ the Soft Shell Crab Watermelon. The watermelon juice, ginger bitters and amazu ponzu combine to create a fresh, acidic, and spiced flavor reminiscent of the dish.\n\nThe combination of these ingredients, the savory agave plant, and dashi create true umami. The result is a savory, fruity, and fresh cocktail made for enjoying on a steamy summer evening at Nobu."
