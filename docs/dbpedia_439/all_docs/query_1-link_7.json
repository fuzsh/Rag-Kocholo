        "text": "Daily life and social customs\n\ninUnited Arab Emirates inCultural life\n\nIn several ways, change is apparent in the federation’s cultural life. Changes in attitudes toward marriage and the employment of women lead the region. The government takes an active role in the empowerment of women, and the constitution includes a number of guarantees and protections for women. Just under half of Emirati women participate in the labour force.\n\nCountry Facts\n\nCapital, Population, Government...\n\nCountry Facts\n\nAudio File: National anthem of the United Arab Emirates\n\nHead Of Government:\n\nPrime Minister: Sheikh Mohammed ibn Rashid Al Maktoum\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 9,257,000\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate:\n\n1 USD equals 3.673 Emirati dirham\n\nHead Of State:\n\nPresident: Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan\n\nAlthough few Emiratis retain the lifeways of their forebears—practicing a nomadic lifestyle or plying the Persian Gulf in search of fish and pearls—many traditional modes of living continue. The major Islamic holidays, including the two ʿīds (festivals), Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, are observed among the Muslim majority, and traditional dress is still the norm. For women, traditional attire consists of a light chemise known as a dirʿ, which is often worn beneath a more ornate dress (thawb). Beneath the dress a sirwāl, a type of loose trouser, is worn. Outside the home or in the presence of strangers, women still cover themselves with a dark cloak known as an ʿabāyah and cover their heads with a scarf called a shāl, which may also serve as a veil (ḥijāb or burquʿ). Fabrics are often delicate, colourful, and highly embroidered, and Emirati women wear a variety of fine gold and silver jewelry.\n\nThe traditional garb for men consists of a long, simple, ankle-length garment known as a kandūrah or dishdashah (or also thawb). Usually made of white cotton, the garment may instead be made of a heavier material and in a variety of colours. The standard head covering is the ghuṭrah, a light scarf (usually white or white-and-red checkered, also known as a kaffiyeh) held in place by a black cord of camel hair known as an ʿiqāl. Colour, style, and material of headwear may vary among groups.\n\nEmirati cuisine reflects the variety of cultural influences that the country has experienced over the centuries. Hummus, fūl (spiced bean paste), falafel, and shawarma (broiled meat served on flatbread) are dishes standard to the Arab world, whereas the influence of Iranian cuisine can be seen in the Emirati preference for rice as a staple and ingredients such as saffron, cardamom, and rose water as flavouring in desserts. Among the favorite dishes is makbūs—poultry, meat, or fish atop a bed of rice spiced with seasonings and dried lime. As in all countries of the region, lamb and chicken are the preferred meats, and fresh fruits—including dates, figs, lemons, and limes—and vegetables and flatbread (khubz) are daily fare. The preferred drink is coffee, served in the popular fashion—hot, strong, and sweet.\n\nThe arts\n\nAs is true of other countries of the Arabian Peninsula, traditional arts such as pottery, weaving, and metalworking occupy a prominent place in cultural life. The manufacture of handicrafts is an economic mainstay for smaller villages, providing goods to sell in the souks (open-air markets) that lie at the heart of small towns and large cities alike. Traditional storytelling remains a much-admired art form, and Emirati culture, like Arab culture on the whole, esteems poetry, whether it is classical, contemporary, or the Bedouin vernacular form called nabaṭī. Traditional music, such as the ḥudāʾ—sung originally by caravanners while on the trail—is enjoyed alongside popular music from abroad, and traditional dances such as the ʿayyālah (often called ʿarḍah), a type of sword dance, are performed on special occasions.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Culture sponsors a number of events annually, including plays and music festivals, and helps support the numerous folklore associations in the emirates. The Sharjah Theatre Festival brings together talent from all seven emirates. Annual international book fairs in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi cities are highly regarded, and film festivals in the emirates are gaining in popularity and reputation. The Dubai Air Show has become a major regional event.\n\nCultural institutions\n\nDubai Museum is located in al-Fahīdī Fort and features displays on Bedouin life, local history, dances, and musical instruments. The fort is also home to a military museum. Al-Ain is the site of a museum devoted to Bedouin culture and the emirates’ pre-oil history. Sharjah city features a noted natural history museum. Dubai city is growing as a centre for regional film, television, and music production and is home to the Dubai Opera House. Abu Dhabi hosts the Louvre Abu Dhabi, a museum that leases its name, collection, and expertise from the Louvre in Paris.\n\nSports and recreation\n\nSports are popular in the United Arab Emirates and are strongly supported by the government. The Ministry of Youth and Sports oversees and encourages the many groups, clubs, and associations that provide sports-related activities. Football (soccer) is the most-watched spectator sport, and horse racing also enjoys widespread popularity. The federation is also a major centre for camel racing, a traditional sport that became increasingly popular late in the 20th century, and for falconry, once an important means of hunting. Jujitsu became popular and widespread in the 21st century, especially because of the patronage of Abu Dhabi’s ruling Nahyan family. The country hosts many international sporting events, most notably for golf, jujitsu, tennis, rugby, and boat racing. The United Arab Emirates made its Olympic debut at the 1984 Summer Games, and its national football (soccer) team qualified for the World Cup in 1990. Abu Dhabi began hosting the final Grand Prix of the Formula One World Championship tournament in 2009. The country hosted the FIFA Club World Cup in 2018, in which the club from Al-Ain played Real Madrid in the final match, and hosted the Asian Cup tournament months later in 2019.\n\nMedia and publishing\n\nThe news media are concentrated in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah. A number of daily newspapers are published, in both Arabic and English. Radio and television programs are broadcast daily from Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, and Ras al-Khaimah, in those same languages."
