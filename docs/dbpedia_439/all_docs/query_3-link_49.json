Ahlan wa sahlan ( أهلا و سهلا ) “Welcome”\n\nah-lan wha sah-lan\n\nhttps://blog.amazingtalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/sahlan.mp3\n\nUsed as a “Hello”. It is used as a general greeting in the Arab region. You can then reply with ahlan wa sahlan, Ahlan, or Marhaba (more on this below).\n\nFor example, you can use this greeting just bout anywhere— from greeting your family, friends, neighbor, bosses, etc.\n\n2. Marhaba ( مرحبا ) “Hello”\n\nmar-ha-ban (you have to roll the R)\n\nhttps://blog.amazingtalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/marhaba.mp3\n\nThis is an informal greeting that can be used at any time of the day. You would reply with either Marhaba, Sabaho or Sabah el kheir.\n\nFor example, you would use this to greet the cafe owner before you order your after-work-coffee.\n\n3. Ahlan ( أهلا ) “Hi”\n\nah-lan\n\nhttps://blog.amazingtalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ahlan.mp3\n\nSimilar to ahlan wa sahlan, just way more informal. You can reply with ahlan or halaa (Which means the same thing).\n\nExample: you use this greeting on your waiter at a fast-food restaurant.\n\n4. Naharak Saa’id ( نهارك سعيد ) “May you have a happy or a good day”\n\nna-ha-rukuh sa-eid-on\n\nhttps://blog.amazingtalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/saad.mp3\n\nThis greeting can be used anywhere and anytime.

Yeseed masakom ( يسعد مساكم ) “May you have a nice evening”\n\nyu-sae-do ma-sa-kim\n\nhttps://blog.amazingtalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/masakim.mp3\n\nThis is a formal and informal greeting that can only be used during the evening time of day. You would reply with Wa masakom which, similar to Wa naharak, means “you too” or “may you have a nice evening as well”.\n\nYou can use this greeting as you pass your neighbor during your evening jog.\n\n6. Sa’ide ( سعيدي ) “Night”\n\nSa-eid\n\nhttps://blog.amazingtalker.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/saaid.mp3\n\nThis informal greeting is used at night. You would reply with Sa’ide or Yeseed masakom.\n\nAfter working overtime to get your job done, you can use this greeting with your colleagues (who are also your friends) before you go home for the night.\n\nThe Arabic language has quite the greeting culture!\n\nAs mentioned before, how you greet someone in Arabic depends on the time of day, what relationship you have with the person you are greeting, what gender they are, and which area you are in. We have already discussed which greetings you should use during certain times of the day, and now we will discuss how to greet someone depending on your relationship with them, their gender, and in what area you find yourself! The most important thing to remember, which applies to all countries, is if a female wears an Islamic dress, it is better to greet her in a verbal fashion. Considering how you greet in some areas differ when compared to other areas, we will categorize them as such:\n\n1. Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦\n\nUsually giving a simple nod or greeting them as discussed above is enough. If a woman is wearing a Hijab, there will be no physical greeting. If you are of the same gender you would greet with a handshake, and if you are friends with the person (same gender), you would kiss them on the cheek or cheeks. Men that are close to each other can greet by touching noses and females can with hugs and kisses (on the cheek or cheeks). There is no physical greeting between those of the opposite gender.\n\n2. Qatar 🇶🇦\n\nThose of the opposite gender should either stick to verbal greetings or a handshake if a female wishes it. During a formal greeting between those of the same gender, you would shake hands— if you are close to someone you would give three kisses on the right cheek. Between male relatives, you touch noses twice and between female relatives, you would hug each other.\n\n3. UAE 🇦🇪\n\nOnce again, those of the opposite gender should either stick to verbal greetings or a handshake only if a female wishes it. Between male relatives, you would touch noses twice and between female relatives, you would hug each other. If you are of the same gender, you can greet with hugs, praises, and handshakes.\n\n4. Egypt 🇪🇬\n\nThose of the opposite gender may only shake hands if the female initiates it, if not, the male greets them by bowing his head. Between friends or relatives, a kiss on both cheeks with a hug all the while shaking hands is the common form of greeting. If you are of the same gender or meeting someone for the first time, you can shake hands.\n\n5. Lebanon 🇱🇧\n\nUsually, a “Hello” as mentioned above with a smile and a handshake is enough. If you see someone regularly you would kiss them once on the cheek. If you haven’t seen someone in a while, you give kisses on alternative cheeks.\n\n6. Jordan 🇯🇴\n\nThose of the opposite gender may only shake hands if the female initiates it, greetings are very formal. You would usually greet someone with a smile or by placing your hand on your heart (your palm must be facing your heart). Male relatives and friends either shake hands or kiss cheeks.\n\n7. Syria 🇸🇾\n\nAgain, those of the opposite gender may only shake hands if the female initiates it. If you are close to someone of the same gender, males would greet you with two kisses on each cheek or a hug and females would only hug you. Only use handshakes for formal situations, but bear in mind what was said in the first sentence.\n\nRemember to always first learn how to greet in the language you are learning!\n\nSheesh, that is a lot of information to take in! If you are still struggling to understand how to say good morning or the greeting culture in Arabic, consider getting an Arabic tutor to show you exactly how to go about this or any topic that you need help with when it comes to the Arabic language!\n\nWhether you are learning how to say good morning in Japanese or learning another language, getting a tutor will benefit you in the long run!
