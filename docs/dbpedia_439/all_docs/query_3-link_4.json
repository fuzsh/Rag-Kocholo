        "text": "You’re visiting Dubai and you want to talk the talk and walk the walk. Having a little bit of Arabic under your belt is a great way to do that. You’ll especially want to know some of the key phrases when you experience the famous “Arab hospitality”.\n\nFrom the minute you meet someone until the time you say goodbye, you’ll feel the hospitality here. And it’s not just about saying “hello”. It’s the Arabic coffee greeting and the offering of rose water. You always feel welcome!\n\nSo, if you want to be able to reciprocate the hospitality of the good people of Dubai, knowing a little Arabic doesn’t hurt.\n\nFor instance, when men greet one another with a handshake, they often come face-to-face to let their noses touch. The right hand is always used, as the left is considered unclean.\n\nQuick note: if someone of the opposite gender refuses to shake your hand, don’t worry, you didn’t do anything wrong. Some people here just believe men and women should not greet each other with physical contact.\n\nHere’s is more about how to greet properly in Arabic:\n\nTime-Specific Greetings\n\nYou can also greet people according to the time of the day.\n\nIn the morning, you can say “Sabah al-khayr” meaning, “good morning”. Unlike in English greetings, there are several replies to this greeting in Arabic, depending on the mood and creativity of the speaker. The most common reply is “Sabah an-noor” meaning, “morning or light”. The speaker may tweak “morning of light” to “Morning of joy”, “Morning of beauty”, “Morning of the rose”, and so on.\n\n“Good evening” pretty much follows the same pattern. “Misa’ al-khayr” is replied to with “Misa’ an-noor”. The “an-noor” can be replaced depending on the mood.\n\n“Good night” is expressed with “Tisbah ‘ala khayr” roughly meaning, “wake up to the good” and the responding reply is “Wa anta/anti min ahloo” meaning, “and may you be one of the good”.\n\nRose water and Arabic Coffee\n\nThere are other ways Arab hospitality is expressed, namely rose water and Arabic Coffee.\n\nRose water is an old Bedouin tradition, poured over your hands when you arrive at camp. As the Bedouins were desert travellers, they did this to refresh their guests and wash away any unpleasant smells they had garnered through their travels.\n\nArabic Coffee is a bit more interesting, as there are two ways to greet someone with it. The first is with half a cup; this means you’re welcome to hang around for a while. But if you are poured a full cup, you’ll have to quaff it and be on your way."
