        "text": "Tax-free salaries and a robust economy attract thousands of expatriate workers from all sectors to the UAE each year\n\nThe UAE is made up of seven emirates, of which Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the most populous. The country has experienced rapid economic growth in recent years, making it an attractive destination for job seekers. The cost of living is high, but the standard of living is world-class.\n\nEnglish is the language of business in the UAE, with only 10% of the population being UAE nationals. This means that it is relatively easy for foreigners to fit in. As a result, opportunities exist all over the country, but most jobs are found in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.\n\nWhen living and working in the UAE, it is important to be respectful of local laws and customs. There are severe penalties for breaking these laws. For example, there is a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs and drunk driving. Relationships outside of marriage are illegal, as is same-sex marriage. You will need a special license to consume alcohol, and women should dress modestly when out in public. Swearing in public and public displays of affection are also arrestable offences.\n\nDespite these restrictions, the UAE is a great place to live and work. It is hot in summer and warm in winter, and there are many idyllic sandy beaches and cosmopolitan landmarks, such as Al-Ain Zoo, the Burj Khalifa and the Heart of Sharjah to enjoy on your days off.\n\nBe sure to check the latest foreign travel advice for UAE at GOV.UK.\n\nJobs in the UAE\n\nWith a population of ten million and an unemployment rate of 2.75%, the UAE is an oil-rich country. It's had to deal with fluctuating oil prices and global oversupply but overall, the economy is strong and has seen rapid growth in recent years.\n\nMajor industries in the UAE include:\n\naluminium\n\nboat building and ship repair\n\nconstruction\n\nfishing\n\nhandicrafts and textiles\n\npetroleum and petrochemicals.\n\nSome of the best major companies to work for include:\n\nAstraZeneca Gulf (pharmaceutical)\n\nApparel Group (retail)\n\nDHL (logistics)\n\nEtihad Airways\n\nFedEx Express (logistics)\n\nHilton Worldwide (hospitality)\n\nMarriott (hospitality)\n\nMicrosoft Gulf\n\nOmnicom Media Group MENA\n\nSplash (fashion)\n\nTHE One (retail)\n\nWeber Shandwick (communications).\n\nTo learn more about the different emirates of the UAE, see Bayut Area Guides.\n\nSkills shortages\n\nThe UAE has several growth industries, including the energy sector, which requires science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) specialists. Meanwhile, healthcare and life sciences industries are also experiencing skills shortages. Openings are also available in the property and finance sectors.\n\nHow to get a job in the UAE\n\nMany expats find jobs through international companies in their home countries. If possible, it is best to try to secure work before making the move. Thousands of British companies have operations in the Gulf region, so requesting a transfer to one of these organisations might be an option.\n\nIn the UAE, positions are advertised via recruitment agencies or online. While it may be unusual practice in your own country, don't be surprised to find job adverts specifically asking for a particular gender, age, or nationality. Networking is important, but this may be difficult to do from afar. However, once you have a job in the UAE, successful networking could help you secure a promotion.\n\nSpeculative applications are not unwelcome, but securing a job through this method often relies on strong personal contacts. Most applications take place online via an application form or CV. Make sure to attach a cover letter that is tailored to the specific job you are applying for, a photograph and a short cover letter.\n\nYou'll usually undergo a face-to-face interview and a medical examination before being offered a job.\n\nLook for vacancies at:\n\nAkhtaboot\n\nBAC Middle East\n\nDubizzle\n\nGulfTalent.com\n\nIndeed UAE\n\nNaukrigulf.com.\n\nSummer jobs\n\nShort-term contracts are available in the construction, oil, tourism, and retail industries, but they can be difficult to secure once you are in the country. Hospitality jobs are easiest to find in tourist areas such as Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Due to the prevalence of fixed-term contracts, summer and casual work can be hard to find.\n\nVolunteering opportunities in the UAE are generally limited, but they are more common in the emirates mentioned above. However, this is often due to a shortage of willing participants, so getting involved in voluntary work can provide valuable experience. You can find openings at organisations such as the Emirates Red Crescent and Volunteers AE.\n\nOtherwise, search for opportunities at:\n\nDubai Volunteer Centre\n\nNational Volunteers Program for Emergencies, Crises and Disasters\n\nTeaching jobs\n\nEnglish may be the second language in the UAE, but there are still various teaching opportunities available.\n\nAs long as you hold a TEFL qualification you can find work teaching English as a foreign language in schools, colleges, universities, language centres and private institutions. Some jobs may require you to have a degree, such as a PGCE.\n\nYou could also teach adult classes or work in conjunction with businesses to ensure that their employees are fluent in the language.\n\nYou can search for vacancies and find out more information at:\n\nINTESOL Worldwide\n\nLove TEFL\n\nTeach Away in Abu Dhabi\n\nInternships\n\nShort-term work experience opportunities and internships can be hard to come by, as companies usually sponsor employees for a minimum of 12 months. Such opportunities are further complicated by visa restrictions. However, some internship and summer work placements may be found at:\n\nAIESEC UK\n\nIAESTE\n\nMany universities, such as Heriot-Watt University, Manchester Business School, Middlesex University and the University of Exeter have links to the UAE. Meanwhile, you may be eligible for university exchange programmes if you're still in education. Check with your institution's international office.\n\nUAE visas\n\nAll UK nationals are eligible for a visa on arrival in the UAE. This visa allows you to stay in the country for 30 days. You can then extend your visa for another 30 days, three days before its expiry date. However, you must leave the country at the end of this period. Your passport must have at least six months of validity from the date of entry.\n\nIf you intend to work in the UAE, you will need to be sponsored by an employer. You cannot work on a visit or tourist visa. Once you have accepted a job offer, your employer will apply for a residency visa on your behalf. Once you have a residency visa, you will be able to obtain a work permit from the Ministry of Labour. Working in the UAE without a work permit is illegal.\n\nWork permits and employment visas can last between one and ten years. Documents needed to secure a work permit include:\n\nproof of work contract\n\napplication form\n\nEmirates ID card\n\nvalid passport\n\npassport photos\n\nmedical check and health certificate documents\n\nentry permit.\n\nRemember to cancel your work visa before permanently leaving the UAE. Failure to do so could lead to you being reported as an absconder, resulting in your arrest if you return to the UAE.\n\nLanguage requirements\n\nMajor languages in the UAE include Arabic (the main language), English, Hindi, Persian and Urdu. As the UAE is home to a vast number of expatriates English is widely spoken by locals and is also the language of business.\n\nHowever, an understanding of Arabic will greatly improve your job prospects. Some popular places to learn Arabic include:\n\nEton Institute\n\nThe Arabic Language Centre\n\nThe Mother Tongue Arabic Language Centre\n\nHow to explain your UK qualifications to employers\n\nEmployers usually understand UK qualifications as the UAE education system has many similarities but ensure that this is the case before application.\n\nYou, or your employer, can find out more at ENIC-NARIC.\n\nWhat it's like to work in the UAE\n\nAs in the UK, full-time employees typically work five eight-hour shifts every week. However, unlike the UK, the working week runs from Sunday to Thursday. Friday and Saturday are rest days. Working hours are reduced during Ramadan.\n\nPrivate sector employees are entitled to 30 days of annual leave after one year on the job.\n\nThere are nine recognised public holidays in the UAE but some of these dates change every year, according to the sighting of the moon. National holidays include:\n\nNew Year's Day (1 January)\n\nAl Isra'a Wal Mi'raj - Ascension Day\n\nEid Al Fitr\n\nArafat Day\n\nEid Al Adha - Feast of Sacrifice\n\nAl Hijri - Islamic New Year\n\nBirthday of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH)\n\nCommemoration Day\n\nNational Day.\n\nThe number of holiday days given depends on whether the Islamic festival of Eid falls during the working week or the weekend.\n\nYou don't pay income tax on your earnings in the UAE.\n\nFind out more\n\nDiscover what it's like to study in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)."
