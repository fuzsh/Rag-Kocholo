        "text": "The rapid pace of development in the United Arab Emirates over the past few decades is sometimes difficult to comprehend. In the 1960s, not only did the UAE not exist yet as a country, there wasn't even a marked highway system to connect the small number of people who lived here. In fact, back then in the Trucial States as it was called by the British, they didn't need paved roads because few people had cars.\n\nMatthew Maclean, NYU Abu Dhabi associate lecturer, studies what it was like in the UAE before there were freeways, record-breaking skyscrapers, and sprawling neighborhoods. Paved highways, in particular, were a pivotal milestone for the region, he said, because roads would drive unity in the Emirates both physically and politically.\n\nPaved highway didn't exist until the late 1960s.\n\nThe first paved road built with the intent of people using it — other than city streets in Dubai itself — was between Dubai and Ras al-Khaimah. Construction started in 1966-67.\n\nThe UAE didn't pay for its first major highway. Saudi Arabia did.\n\nThis road between Dubai and Ras al-Khaimah was a political project to create greater unity among the Trucial States. The British had to show they supported development projects but it was Saudi Arabia that had the money and built the road.\n\nPeople used to drive on the beach to get places.\n\nThe easiest way to drive from Dubai to Ras al-Khaimah was on the beach because that's where the sand was most firm. I've read and heard conflicting reports of whether people had to wait for the tide to go out in some places on that route. One place you definitely had to wait for the low tide was where Maqta Bridge stands now, connecting Abu Dhabi to the mainland."
