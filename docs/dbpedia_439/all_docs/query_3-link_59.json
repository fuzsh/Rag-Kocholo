        "text": "If the person who died had insurance, contact their insurance company as soon as possible. If the person worked in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) or was on business, contact their employer. Read the general guidance on what to do when someone dies abroad, if you’re not sure if they had insurance.\n\nThe insurance company should appoint a funeral director in the UAE and the UK. They may also cover the cost of bringing the person’s body to the UK (repatriation) and help with any medical, legal, interpretation and translation fees.\n\nNext of kin\n\nIn the UAE, the next of kin of the person who died will usually need to make decisions and practical arrangements for them. They can sometimes appoint someone else to act on their behalf.\n\nThere is no legal definition of the next of kin in the UK. If there is a disagreement over who is the next of kin, or the person who has died did not chose a next of kin, this can cause additional complications. Contact the British Embassy if you need advice about the next of kin, for example if you’re not sure who it is or are in a same sex marriage.\n\nRegistering the death\n\nThe death must be registered in the UAE. The process is quite complicated but your funeral director can normally do this for you.\n\nTo register the death you must:\n\ncontact the local police where the person who died lived\n\nget the death notification from the hospital\n\nget the death registration letter from the police station (this will be the police station handling the case if the death is being investigated)\n\nGetting the death certificate\n\nTo get the death certificate, take these documents to the relevant authority in the Emirate where the person who died:\n\npolice registration\n\ndeath notification from the hospital\n\npassport copy of the person who died, including the visa page\n\nEmirates ID of the person who died (if they have one)\n\nphoto ID of yourself, such as your passport or driving licence\n\nThe death certificate will often be in English, however this may vary across the different Emirates. Emirati death certificates do not always give the cause of death. It’s worth asking for extra copies of the death certificate, as you might need them to show to other people later.\n\nYou should get the death certificate stamped and signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. You can apply on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website or speak to your funeral director in the UAE for advice.\n\nIf the person who died will be buried in the UAE, you can get the death certificate after the burial. If the body will be repatriated to the UK, you will need the death certificate first.\n\nWhere to get the death certificate\n\nDubai\n\nIn Dubai you can get the death certificate from:\n\nMinistry of Health +971 4 380 3331\n\nDubai Health Authority 800 342 or +971 4 219 8888\n\nAbu Dhabi\n\nIn Abu Dhabi you can get the death certificate from the Department of Health +971 2 449 3333.\n\nSharjah\n\nIn Sharjah you can get the death certificate from:\n\nDepartment of Preventative Medicine +971 6 705 8333\n\nKuwait Hospital +971 6 503 1163\n\nAl Qassimi Hospital +971 518 8888\n\nAjman\n\nIn Ajman you can get the death certificate from:\n\nMinistry of Health and Prevention +971 6 705 8333\n\nDepartment of Preventative Medicine +971 6 705 8777\n\nUmm Al Quwain\n\nIn Dubai you can get the death certificate from the Ministry of Health and Prevention, call 800 11111.\n\nRas Al Khaimah\n\nIn Dubai you can get the death certificate from Saqr Hospital, call +971 7 204 9999.\n\nFujairah\n\nKhorfakkan Hospital +971 9 208 1200\n\nObtaining no objection letters\n\nBefore you can bury, cremate or repatriate the person’s body you will need ‘no objection letters’ from the British embassy in Dubai or Abu Dhabi and the UAE police.\n\nGetting a no objection letter from the British embassy\n\nCall the British embassy on +971 2 610 1100 in Abu Dhabi or + 971 4 309 4444 in Dubai, or email consularappointment.uae@fcdo.gov.uk to book an appointment to get their no objection letter.\n\nTake the following documents to your appointment:\n\nthe Emirati death certificate – this must be stamped and signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nthe death notification or forensic report\n\nthe British passport of the person who died\n\nthe D1 passport cancellation form\n\na next of kin authorisation form (ask the British embassy for this) or a power of attorney document\n\ncopy of the next of kin’s passport\n\nThe British embassy will:\n\nissue a ‘no objection letter’ so you can bury, cremate or repatriate the body\n\ncancel the British passport and return it to you\n\nGetting no objection letters from the police\n\nTake these documents to the police station nearest to where the death occurred:\n\noriginal death certificate\n\noriginal cancelled passport of the person who died\n\nletter of no objection from the British embassy\n\nThe police will provide relevant no objection letters depending on whether the body will be cremated, buried or repatriated:\n\nfor cremation there’ll be copies for the crematorium, mortuary and municipality\n\nfor burial there’ll be copies for the cemetery, mortuary and municipality\n\nfor repatriation there’ll be copies for the airport police, embalming facility and mortuary\n\nPost mortems in the UAE\n\nA post mortem is a medical examination of the body. There might be one in the UAE if the cause of death is unknown, unnatural, sudden or violent. Any death outside a hospital will be referred to the police who will arrange for a post mortem and the body of the person who died will only be released with the permission of the prosecutor’s office.\n\nThere’ll be staff at the mortuaries where they take place who speak English and the facilities are of a high standard, similar to those in the UK.\n\nPost mortem reports are available to the family once the investigation into the death has been completed. You can get a copy from the prosecutor’s office.\n\nBurying or cremating the body in the UAE\n\nYou can only bury someone who has died in the UAE if they held a valid residency visa. Those without a valid residency visa may only be cremated or repatriated.\n\nOnce you have the death certificate and no objection letters from the British Embassy and police you can speak directly to a local cemetery or crematorium to arrange burial or cremation in the UAE.\n\nFor Muslim burials, the next of kin must also go to the local police with their passport to get a burial permit.\n\nThe exact rules on burials and cremations are different depending on where you are in the UAE. Special permission is needed if you want to bury or cremate the person in a different Emirate to the one where they died.\n\nCremation\n\nCremation in the UAE is only possible for non-Muslims. You must take the no objection letter from the police to the municipality to request a cremation permit to give to the local crematorium.\n\nCremations can be performed at:\n\nthe Al Foah Cemetary in Al Ain\n\nSonapur, Jebel Ali, Dubai\n\nthe Sharjah Crematorium\n\nChildren under 3 who have died in the UAE cannot be cremated there.

You will need to also appoint an international funeral director in the UK.\n\nThe person who died will have to be embalmed and there are specific rules about the coffin. Your funeral director can help arrange this. When taking the person’s body to the UK from the UAE you will need:\n\nthe no objection letter from the British embassy\n\nthe no objection letter from the police\n\nthe death certificate, stamped and signed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nthe death notification\n\nembalming certificate\n\nthe person who died’s cancelled passport showing cancelled visa and entry stamp\n\na UK-based funeral director’s letter of agreement to receive the body if the next of kin is not travelling with it\n\nflight booking confirmation from the airline\n\nYou will need 7 photocopies of each of these documents to take with the body.\n\nBringing the ashes to the UK\n\nAsk your funeral director about the rules for bringing ashes to the UK. You will need the police letter of no objection.\n\nAshes can be taken back to the UK on-board the flight as hand luggage or in a suitcase in a special unsealed box. If the next of kin is not travelling with the ashes you will need approval to accept the ashes aboard the flight as well. Your funeral director can help make all the arrangements.\n\nGetting the person’s belongings back\n\nBelongings of the person who died can only be returned to the next of kin once any police enquiries and all local procedures are finished.\n\nIf you cannot collect them yourself, your local funeral director can do an inventory and take photos of all the belongings and discard anything like liquids that cannot be shipped to the UK. They will then let the next of kin know the cargo or courier options for them.\n\nFinding an Arabic translator\n\nYou may need a translator to help you understand Emirati rules or get documents translated. Check official translators in the UAE. The British embassy or consulate in the UAE cannot provide translation services or pay for translation costs.\n\nFinding an Emirati lawyer\n\nYou may need a lawyer to help you understand the Emirati legal system when someone has died. Check English-speaking lawyers in the UAE. The embassy or consulate in the UAE cannot give you legal advice or pay for legal costs.\n\nTelling the UK authorities\n\nAlthough you do not have to register the death in the UK, when someone dies abroad you still need to tell the UK authorities.
