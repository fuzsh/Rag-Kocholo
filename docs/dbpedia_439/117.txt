Rubʿ al-Khali, vast desert region in the southern Arabian Peninsula, constituting the largest portion of the Arabian Desert. It covers an area of about 250,000 square miles (650,000 square km) in a structural basin lying mainly in southeastern Saudi Arabia, with lesser portions in Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.

The Rubʿ al-Khali is the largest area of continuous sand in the world. It occupies more than one-fourth of Saudi Arabia’s total area and features varied topography. In the west the elevation is as high as 2,000 feet (610 metres) above sea level and the sand is fine and soft, while in the east the elevation drops to about 600 feet (180 metres), with sand dunes, sabkhahs (salt flats), and sand sheets.
