        "text": "Plenty of films have been filmed in Illinois. Whether it be the classic \"Groundhog Day\" filmed in Woodstock, Illinois or \"The Breakfast Club,\" the state has a long history of filmmakers sharing their vision here.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker wants to ensure that keeps happening and recently announced $10 million in grant funding for local film studio infrastructure projects through the Illinois Soundstage Program.\n\nHere are 5 popular movies that were filmed in Springfield or the central Illinois area, according to IMDB.\n\n5. Scandal Sheet - 1952\n\nFilmed around the Illinois Capitol Building, this movie dating back over 70 years ago brings a murder mystery to Springfield in fiction.\n\nWhen the editor of a New York exploitation newspaper meets the wife he had abandoned years ago, while using another name, at a Lonely Hearts ball sponsored by his newspaper, commits a murder and assigns his protégé to investigate hoping to divert attention away from himself.\n\nProduced by Motion Picture Investors and distributed by Columbia Pictures, the movie collected $2.4 million in the box office, or $46.2 million today.\n\n4. Call Northside 777 - 1948\n\nBased on a real-life case, a cop is killed in 1932 and Frank Wiecek sentenced to life. Eleven years later, a newspaper ad by Frank's mother leads Chicago reporter P.J. McNeal to look into the case. For some time, McNeal continues to believe Frank guilty. But when he starts to change his mind, he meets increased resistance from authorities unwilling to be proved wrong.\n\nThis murder mystery has actually a geographical goof in it, according to IMDB, “Continually throughout the film, McNeal incorrectly refers to Springfield and Joliet as 'up there,' when really these cities are southwest of Chicago. Then, when visiting Springfield, he incorrectly refers to Chicago as 'down there' while Chicago is really to his north.”\n\nProduced by 20th Century Studios, the movie garnered $2.7 million at the box office.\n\nMore: New report finds 2 Springfield hospitals in compliance with pricing transparency laws\n\n3. Legally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde - 2003\n\nWhile it doesn’t show for long, in the second iteration of the Legally Blonde franchise main character Elle Woods sits at the Illinois House Chamber and State Capitol Building while joining the House of Representatives.\n\nElle Woods, now a young lawyer, journeys to Washington D.C., to work on a ban on animal testing, but is ignored by every politician she encounters and quickly learns that the White House can be even tougher to navigate than the Ivy League. With the help of friends, Woods works on getting her foot in the door of Congress.\n\nProduced by Marc Platt, David Nicksay, Stephen Traxler and distributed by 20th Century Studios, \"Legally Blonde 2\" made a gross of $125.9 million at the box office.\n\n2. The Informant! - 2009\n\nStarring Matt Damon and Marvin Hamlisch, this award-winning comedy movie was shot all across central Illinois, with the Illini Country Club featuring an action scene.\n\nThe U.S. government decides to go after an agro-business giant with a price-fixing accusation, based on the evidence submitted by their star witness, vice president-turned-informant Mark Whitacre.\n\nAn FBI crime-thriller, Damon’s character Whitacre cannot stop telling lies as they pile up and start to crumble around him.\n\nProduced and distributed by Warner Bros media and Braunstein Films, the gross earnings for the film are $33.3 million.\n\n1. Bad Teacher - 2011\n\nWith six award wins and four nominations under its belt, \"Bad Teacher\" starring Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake follows the fictional story of a gold digger in central Illinois; most exterior shots of the film are taken in and around Springfield.\n\nElizabeth Halsey is returning to middle school in the film, when her wealthy fiancé breaks it off. An awful teacher, Halsey sees a new opportunity in the fresh (and rich) teacher down the hall.\n\nCompeting for a bonus at the school for the teacher whose class scores highest on the state exam, Halsey cheats her way toward Scott's bed and the money. With the tagline that this teacher won’t give an “F,” the rated R film won the 2012 BMI Film Award, 2011 Teen Choice Award for best actor in comedy, Teen Choice Award best comedy, Teen Choice Award best actress in comedy and 2012 best performance as supporting young actor for Matthew J. Evans.\n\nDistributed by Columbia Pictures and Sony, \"Bad Teacher\" grossed $100.3 million in North America, with a worldwide total of $216.2 million box office.\n\nClaire Grant reports business with the State Journal-Register: CLGrant@gannett.com; X (Formerly known as Twitter): @Claire_Granted"
