        "text": "That’s not all, apparently.\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada writer Aline Brosh McKenna is penning a would-be follow-up to the hit film that is being developed and produced by Wendy Finerman, who was behind the original.\n\nWhile no deals are done, a follow-up to the 2006 coming-of-age comedy has long been talked about, with Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Anne Hathway recently reuniting on stage for this year’s SAG Awards.\n\nNo deals for the cast are in place. Disney, which would be the studio behind the film following the acquisitions of the original Devil studio Fox 2000, had no comment.\n\nThe 2006 film based on the book of the same name follows Andy (Hathaway), a recent college journalism graduate as she lands one of the most coveted jobs in publishing as the assistant to Anna Wintour stand-in Miranda Priestly (Streep). Andy dives into the world of magazines and high fashion thanks to her fellow assistant (Blunt).\n\nThe film grossed a massive $326 million at the worldwide box office and earned Streep an Oscar nomination.\n\nPuck first reported the news of the sequel and offered insights into a possible plot where Priestly is still the head of Runway but the magazine has endured the financial headwinds of contemporary publishing and is in a diminished state. Blunt’s one-time assistant would now be an executive at a luxury brand conglomerate that advertises with Runway."
