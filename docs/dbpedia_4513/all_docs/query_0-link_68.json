        "text": "Who are the greatest Horror Production Studios in the world? What company is the best at making horror movies? We have considered the contributions of every major movie production studio and independent film distributor to come up with a dead list that considers each studio’s impact on the horror genre.\n\nWhen picking a horror movie to watch, knowing who produced the movie can be handy. There’s a difference between a major studio-released film and that from a mini-major or an independent producer. The major studios will bring the bigger budgets: the bigger movie stars and the better effects. The independent features will take the biggest risks and push the genre’s envelope. Mini-majors are home to the big horror franchises and offer a strong brand identity.\n\nWe have listed all of the production studios and independent film distributors and uncovered ALL of the horror films that they’ve made. As such, we have listed a significant portion of all the essential horror films ever produced and show you who made them. Have no doubt: picking between a feature from A24 differs significantly from picking a feature from The Asylum. That’s not to say there isn’t room for both. Troma is as essential to the horror legacy as Dimension is. But, that’s not stopping us from RANKING what we think are the best studios and distributors.\n\nThe Grading Criteria:\n\nIs the studio known to be a home for horror? Or does it only occasionally get scary?\n\nAre the greatest films in the catalog considered to be horror classics?\n\nHave the movies produced or distributed by this company been financially successful?\n\nIs there a consistent quality level in the films in the studio catalog?\n\nHas the studio elevated the careers of the producers and directors of their movies?\n\nIs there a unique brand identity to the studio? Is the company an iconic brand?\n\nHow long has the studio been active?\n\nDoes the studio produce or distribute a lot of horror films? Quantity does count.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nIt’s essential to define what the companies we are reviewing do.\n\nMajor Horror Movie Studios\n\nThey do it all. Major Horror Movie Studios produce, distribute, and market movies. This is what we would consider to be typically Big Hollywood. These are the financiers and the engines that are the business part of show business. These companies will have their own. The major studios are the commercial giants that control massive studio lots for filming and have access to the most famous and successful actors and directors. The major studios are parent companies to subsidiary production studios with a global reach.\n\nAccess to the best talent, directors, and effects is within reach of the major studios. However, horror rarely gets the blockbuster treatment. Occasionally, a ready-made hit like The Omen or A Quiet Place will get greenlit by one of the Big Five studios, but it’s rare. R-rated movies, by restriction, cannot generate as much money as a PG-13 Blockbuster. As such, major studios often have their subsidiary mini-major studio arms do the horror work.\n\nOccasionally, a big studio finds a can’t-miss property like Stephen King’s It, which satisfies both a hard-core horror audience and appeals to the masses. That minor miracle is the exception to the rule. It has made $702,781,748 at the time of this posting. That is off of a $35,000,000 budget. Compared to the costs of a superhero movie, this was a much better investment. A movie like It, Jaws, The Exorcist, Alien, or The Sixth Sense comes around only rarely, though. Guaranteed, though, the movie will be a legend if it does hit.\n\nThe Major studios include:\n\nThe BIG FIVE\n\nWalt Disney Studios\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nSony Pictures / Columbia Pictures\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nDefunct Major Studios\n\nRKO Radio Pictures\n\n20th Century Fox (Demoted, now part of Disney)\n\nMetro Goldwyn Mayer (Demoted, Merged with Amazon)\n\nUnited Artists (Demoted, now part of MGM and part of Amazon)\n\nMini-Major Horror Movie Studios\n\nThese larger independent film production companies compete with the majors for theater space, streaming space, and awards. The Mini-Majors often produced horror as the larger studios would stick primarily with more prestige genres. When a genre film has serious financial potential, a Major Studio will often partner up with a mini-major to distribute and market the film.\n\nMost of your major horror franchises reside in the mini-majors. A Nightmare on Elm Street. The Conjuring. Final Destination. Puppet Master. Paranormal Activity. These are all low-cost, high-profit models, even if they don’t make “It” level income. They don’t need to, because the upfront costs are so cheap. These movies don’t have A-list stars, but you have built-in expectations and, most of all, a reputation. True, the originality runs out after a while, but horror fans are very forgiving, and they have been back to the Golden Age Universal Monsters, where Frankenstein had so many spin-offs. Horror fans like a familiar face; the scarier the face, the better.\n\nMini Majors\n\nMGM Studios/United Artists\n\nA24\n\nBlumhouse\n\nSTX Films\n\nGroupe Canal+\n\nLionsgate\n\nNewLine (now under WB)\n\n20th Century Studios (Now under Disney)\n\nTriStar Pictures\n\nDefunct Mini Majors\n\nNew World Pictures\n\nDimension Films\n\nArtisan Entertainment\n\nDreamworks Pictures\n\nMiramax\n\nAllied Artists\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment\n\nOrion Pictures\n\nTri-Star Pictures\n\nIndependent Horror Movie Studios\n\nThese are the operators who work outside of the funding and operations of the major Hollywood studios. This can range from the small art-house film to the B-Movie grindhouse exploitation straight-to-video production. Horror undoubtedly has made its impact felt in the independent scene. Smaller budgets allow for greater risks. Not just for the content of the films either, but young and upcoming filmmakers often get their first big breaks in the Indies.\n\nThe great tradition of filmcraft and showmanship from learning your craft as an independent filmmaker from a B-Movie mentor lives on. From the Godfather producers like Roger Corman, William Castle, and Lloyd Kaufman to the next generation of mentors like Barbara Crampton and Larry Fessenden, the greatest lift-up in the movie industry can come through the horror genre. There is a good reason why there are so many great horror short filmmakers out there. That is the first step on the independent filmmaking tutorial stepladder.\n\nDistribution Companies\n\nIn this new golden age of horror, the independent film distributor plays a huge role. The independent filmmaker can produce their movies, but they can’t get their film to the theaters and streaming services by themselves. The importance of Film Festivals is that independent film producers often look to get a distribution partner to shepherd their film to the audiences, be it by theater or streaming. Companies like Magnet, XYZ, and IFC Midnight are huge in searching for the best and most promising horror films and getting a marketing plan built around promoting and releasing the movies.\n\nNote that after World War II, most of Europe’s greatest film studios were destroyed. The European studio system had been relegated to starting over again. These studios never took hold in a major way, ceding the media environment to Hollywood. As a result, most European producers are independent and link up with a Distribution Company.\n\nTo capture all the great independent horror movies out there, we are also considering the best in film distributors, who, while they don’t make the movies, have established credibility and a brand standard for quality film releases that meet or exceed what the major studios do.\n\nIn a streaming world thirsty for content, streaming platforms are getting involved as distributors, as non-theater media has shifted from physical media to downloadable content. Netflix, Hulu, Shudder, and others are capitalizing on what the mini-majors have known for a long time. Horror can be profitable if you find the right story and storyteller. Plus blood, guts, and a jump scare or two.\n\nTHE RANKINGS\n\nA couple of notes:\n\n(D) = Distribution\n\nFranchises are designated with the original franchise and the latest franchise.\n\nFor example, Critters (1986-2019) describes a franchise, so not all the sequels and reboots are listed unless a different studio picked up subsequent features within a franchise.\n\nUnderlined films are links back to The Scariest Things reviews. Not surprisingly, most of these films are from 2017 and later, since that’s when we started writing reviews.\n\n1.

Empire International Pictures (1983-1988) and Full Moon Features (1988-Present)\n\nThe B-Movie of the eighties and nineties was destined for the straight-to-video market. No studio embraced that as successfully or as willingly as Charles Band’s Empire International films and its successor, Full Moon Features. If you walked into a video store in this era, the shelves were crowded with the inexpensively made exploitation movies they produced. The Lovecraftian films of Stuart Gordon rose above the standard fare and rode the talent and charisma of Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton to a few iconic titles. When Empire Folded, Charles Band created Full Moon Features, which continued his tradition of cheeky and cheap exploitation films to this day.\n\nNotable Directors: Stuart Gordon, David Schmoeller\n\nIconic Films: Re-Animator (1985), From Beyond (1985), PuppetMaster (1989)\n\nSleeper Film: Raw Head Rex (1986)\n\nEmpire International Pictures:\n\nThe Alchemist (1983), Ghoulies (1984), Trancers (1984), Re-Animator (1985), Underworld (1985), Dolls (1986), Troll (1986), Breeders (1986), Crawlspace (1986), Necropolis (1986), Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity (1987), Creepozoids (1987), Cellar Dweller (1987), Ghoulies II (1987), Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl O’ Rama (1988), Ghost Town (1988), Spellcaster (1991)\n\nFull Moon Features\n\nPuppetmaster (1989-Present: 16 films), Meridian: Kiss of the Beast (1990), Shadowzone (1990), The Pit and the Pendulum (1991), Subspecies (1991), Demonic Toys (1992), Doctor Mordrid (1992), Seedpeople (1992), Arcade (1993), Lurking Fear (1994), Castle Freak (1995), Demon in the Bottle (1996), The Creeps (1997), Hideous!
