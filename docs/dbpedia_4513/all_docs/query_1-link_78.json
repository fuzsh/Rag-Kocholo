        "text": "SOME eminently talented people are used to slight avail in the pair of pictures, \"Eye of the Devil\" and \"The Girl and the General,\" which constitute a double-bill opening in neighborhood theaters yesterday.In the first, a haunted chateau picture, Deborah Kerr plays the mystified wife of David Niven, a wealthy vineyard owner, who gets himself hopelessy involved with his peasants in some black-magic rituals in order to restore the health of his grapes. In order to bring his vines back to condition, he has to allow himself to be destroyed by a silver arrow shot through his heart, which is enough to mystify anybody. I'd say Miss Kerr is well rid of that mob.The comparative age of this Anglo-French picture is manifest by the fact that David Hemmings, the young sensation of \"Blow-Up,\" plays a minor role. Also in small roles are Flora Robson, Emlyn Williams and Donald Pleasance.\"The Girl and the General\" is also an oldie, which was made in Italy with Rod Steiger and Virna Lisi while she was still a brunette. It has him playing an Austrian general captured in World War I by Umberto Orsini as a dopey Italian soldier. Miss Lisi plays a peasant girl who gets mixed up with the two.Some bits of it are amusing, in a broad Italian farcical vein, but the whole thing is just too slow and labored, like an overextended vaudeville skit.\n\nEYE OF THE DEVIL, screenplay by Robin Estridge and Dennis Murphy, based on Philip Loraine's novel \"Day of the Arrow\"; directed by J. Lee Thompson; produced by John Calley and Martin Ransohoff; a Filmways Picture presented by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Running time: 92 minutes.Catherine . . . . .

At neighborhood theaters. Running time: 105 minutes.The General . . . . . Rod SteigerAda . . . . . Virna LisiTarasconi . . . . . Umberto OrsiniTHE moviemakers operating in the contemporary inscrutable East or the pioneer West haven't improved a bit on Edwin S. Porter's 1903 \"The Great Train Robbery,\" to judge by \"Kill a Dragon\" and \"Navajo Joe,\" which landed with the effect of a Chinese firecracker at local houses yesterday. Oddly enough, each half of this sterotyped double bill has its bad guys shooting for a half-million dollars in loot, but the total results aren't worth a Mexican peso.Say this for this three-hour helping of manufactured sound and fury, the scenery is authentically foreign. In this case of \"Kill a Dragon,\" Jack Palance, an American soldier of fortune who is after a junk-load of salvaged explosives in order to help some Chinese (and himself, of course), is working on actual Hong Kong locales, as are Aldo Ray, Fernando Lamas (as the rich, tough opposition) and a variety of Oriental types.\"Navajo Joe,\" on the other hand, is the latest of a succession of super-bloody \"Westerns\" made by Italians and Spaniards in Spain with Italian, Spanish and American actors, this time led by Burt Reynolds, as the American titular superhero who dispatches troops of villains singlehanded.Both films were shot in color but are decidedly colorless.\n\nEast-West Twin BillKILL A DRAGON, written by George Schenck and William Marks; directed by Michael Moore and produced by Hal Klein; an Aubrey Schenck Production released through United Artists.

Lucia ModugnoWITH all the double-billed junk on hand, the combination of \"Rings Around the World\" (circus acts) and \"Who's Minding the Mint?\" (an old-fashioned but sassy little comedy) works very well indeed.The first of these Columbia releases arriving yesterday at neighborhood theaters may remind many of Don Ameche's television series, with the actor introducing specialties from all over the world. And so it should, since the same people assembled this feature, using fresh footage, according to Columbia. In any case the acts themselves are extraordinary, vividly photographed in good color with a ripe musical background. The picture, with Mr. Ameche narrating, stands on its own as a fine, tingling study of marvelous circus specialties, with no nonsense about it.\"Who's Minding the Mint?\" is all nonsense, and most of it fun. Like the other picture, it also happens to be clean. It has to do with a young Bureau of Engraving clerk who accidentally destroys $50,000 and sneaks in the building one night to mint it back with some money minded pals.The first two-thirds of this romp is snugly amusing and perkily turned, as written by R. S. Allen and Harvey Bullock and nimbly directed by Norman Maurer. The performances of an unglittery cast are dandy, from Jim Hutton and Dorothy Provine to old-timer Walter Brennan and back to Milton Berle. The funniest is Jack Gilford, as a half-deaf safecracker. Mr. Gilford is simply wonderful.The picture runs too long, and strain sets in.However, a fresh coating and zestful playing nicely flavor an obvious but likable romp with a contagious, merry spirit all its own."
