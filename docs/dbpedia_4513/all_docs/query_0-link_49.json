        "text": "Not every movie new on Netflix in June 2024 was embraced by critics, especially those starring Will Farrell or Shailene Woodley.\n\nOf course, just because a movie doesn’t resonate with critics the way others do doesn’t mean that it won’t find an audience on Netflix.\n\nThe venerable streaming service has given new life to many movies over the years that didn’t get some love from critics and audiences, yet have managed to make it onto the streaming channel’s weekly Top 10 Movies chart either globally or in the U.S., if not both.\n\nForbesWhat Are The 10 Best-Reviewed Movies New On Netflix In June 2024?\n\nOne recent example of a film defying critics is Matt Damon’s 2016 monster movie The Great Wall, which was splattered with negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes with a 35% “rotten” rating, based on 238 reviews.\n\nDespite the negative critical reception of the film, The Great Wall managed to scale upward to make both the Global and U.S. Top 10 Movies charts on Netflix.\n\nForbesHere Are All The Movies New On Netflix In June, Plus 'Godzilla Minus One'\n\nMore recently, Rotten Tomatoes critics shredded Jennifer Lopez’s new Netflix movie Atlas but it was the streamer’s most watched movie after only three days on the streamer.\n\nHere’s a look at the 10 worst-reviewed movies (make that 11 since there’s a tie) new on Netflix in June, according to Rotten Tomatoes reviewers.\n\n10. ‘Kicking & Screaming’ (2005)\n\nWill Ferrell stars as Phil Weston in this sports comedy, a youth soccer coach who has never lived up to his competitive dad’s (Robert Duvall) expectations. Phil is put to the test when his soccer team faces off against his dad Buck’s team.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics weren’t impressed with Kicking & Screaming’s impressive lineup—including a cameo by legendary NFL coach Mike Ditka—giving it a 41% “rotten” rating based on 142 reviews.\n\nAudiences liked Kicking & Screaming a tiny bit more, as RT verified users gave the film a 43% “rotten” Audience Score based on 50,000-plus ratings.\n\nKicking & Screaming debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\n9. ‘Two Can Play That Game’ (2001)\n\nLike Kicking & Screaming, the romantic comedy Two Can Play That Game has an impressive cast, including Vivica A. Fox, Morris Chestnut, Anthony Anderson, Gabriel Union and Mo’Nique.\n\nFox plays Shante, a woman who gives expert relationship advice to her girlfriends about keeping their boyfriends on the straight and narrow.\n\nForbesObscure Sci-Fi Movie 'Upgrade' Surges On Netflix Global Top 10 Chart\n\nShante, however, finds that following her own advice isn’t so easy when her beau Keith (Chestnut) shows he is just as adept at the relationship game.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics didn’t find Two Can Play That Game to be an even match, though, giving the film a 40% “rotten” rating based on 62 reviews. Viewers largely disagreed with the critical assessment of the film as more than 25,000 verified users awarded Two Can Play That Game with an 83% positive Audience Score.\n\nTwo Can Play That Game debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\n8. ‘The Devil’s Own’ (1997)/‘Dune’ (1984) (Tie)\n\nAs the 1997 crime thriller The Devil’s Own proves, having two A-list global superstars does not guarantee a positive review from critics. In The Devil’s Own, Harrison Ford stars as New York police Officer Tom O’Meara, who unknowingly becomes entangled in a deadly plot by Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt), a member of the Irish Republican Army.\n\nRotten Tomatoes critics refused to engage in the plot of The Devil’s Own, giving it a 37% “rotten” rating based on 41 reviews. Viewers like the film a bit more, giving it a 41% “rotten” Audience Score based on more than 25,000 user ratings.\n\nThe Devil’s Own debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\nNearly four decades before writer-director Denis Villeneuve tackled the adaptation of Frank Herbert’s classic 1965 novel Dune, legendary filmmaker David Lynch tried his hand at bringing the story of the messianic hero Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan) to life on the big screen.\n\nForbesOriginal 'Dune' Movie From 1984 Coming To Netflix In June\n\nCritics buried Dune in reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, though, giving it a 37% “rotten” rating based on 117 reviews that stretch from current day to as far back as 1984 when the film debuted in theaters. More than 50,000 viewers have an opposite view of 1984’s Dune, though, awarding the movie with a 65% “fresh” Audience Score.\n\nDune debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\n7. ‘Welcome to Marwen’ (2018)\n\nSteve Carell stars as Mark Hogancamp in this fantasy drama based on a true story from director Robert Zemeckis. After being beaten in a violent assault, Mark tries to piece his life back together by constructing a World War II-era Belgian town. It’s in the town—populated by dioramas and dolls—where Mark assumes the identity of a hero pilot to take himself away from his real-life torment.\n\nWelcome to Marwen wasn’t welcomed by Rotten Tomatoes critics, which gave it a 34% “rotten” rating based on 171 reviews. The site’s Audience Score was better with a rating of 48% “rotten” user rating based on 1,000-plus reviews.\n\nWelcome to Marwen will begin streaming on Netflix on June 16.\n\n6. ‘A Million Ways to Die in the West’ (2014)\n\nMovie Westerns have become a hard sell to audiences and critics in recent years, and writer-director Seth MacFarlane’s attempt to add comedy to the mix didn’t work for critics of A Million Ways to Die in the West.\n\nThe Family Guy creator certainly enlisted the talent to get the job done with a stellar cast including Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried and Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nMacFarlane plays a sheep farmer in the Old West in A Million Ways to Die in the West, but Rotten Tomatoes critics put the movie out to pasture with a 33% “rotten” rating based on 212 reviews. Viewers thought the movie was “rotten,” too, awarding it a 41% “rotten” score based on 50,000-plus reviews.\n\nA Million Ways To Die in the West debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\n5. ‘The Divergent Series: Insurgent’ (2015)\n\nLike The Hunger Games, The Divergent Series is based on a set of hit Y/A novels about a future dystopian society. Insurgent is the second movie of author Veronica Roth’s book-turned-film series, following Divergent.\n\nShailene Woodley’s Tris and Theo James’ Four are the protagonists in the series, but Rotten Tomatoes critics hardly found the events of Insurgent heroic, giving the film a “rotten” 28% rating based on 207 reviews.\n\nThe film’s Audience Score of 58%—based on more than 50,000 user ratings, was a bit more forgiving, but still deemed Insurgent “rotten.”\n\nThe Divergent Series: Insurgent debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\n4. ‘Land of the Lost’ (2009)\n\nBased on Sid and Marty Kroft’s classic Saturday morning TV series about a family who find themselves in prehistoric times after traveling through a time warp, Will Ferrell’s big-screen adaptation of The Land of the Lost was—for the lack of a better word—lost on critics.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reviewers gave Land of the Lost a combined 26% “rotten” rating based on 193 reviews, while audiences told the film to get lost, too, with a “rotten” 32% Audience Score based on more than 250,000 user ratings.\n\nLand of the Lost debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\n3. ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ (2015)\n\nSimply put, E.L. James’ massive bestselling novel 50 Shades of Grey didn’t translate well as a film adaptation. As such, the lurid tale about 21-year-old college senior Anastasia Steele’s (Dakota Johnson) descent into a BDSM relationship with billionaire businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) was met with a tough reception by critics.\n\nRotten Tomatoes reviewers gave Fifty Shades of Grey a 25% “rotten” rating based on 280 reviews, while viewers closed the book on the movie adaptation, too, with a 41% “rotten” Audience Score.\n\nFifty Shades of Grey will begin streaming on Netflix on June 18.\n\n2. ‘National Security’ (2003)\n\nWhile Martin Lawrence excels on the buddy cop comedy beat with Will Smith in the Bad Boys movie series, his turn as a security guard along with Steve Zahn in National Security was not locked up but locked out by critics.\n\nAs such, National Security was riddled with bad reviews as Rotten Tomatoes critics gave it a lowly 11% “rotten” rating based on 90 reviews. While more than 50,000 viewers had a much more positive reception for National Security, the film still only managed a 45% “rotten” Audience Score.\n\nNational Security debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\n1.‘The Divergent Series: Allegiant’ (2016)\n\nThe Divergent Series began in 2014 with Divergent, and everything went downhill from there with critical and audience response to the second and third film in the trilogy.\n\nLike National Security, Rotten Tomatoes critics gave Allegiant an 11% “rotten” rating (based on 199 reviews) but the film’s 41 percent “rotten” Audience Score (based on 25,000-plus ratings) pushed it to the top—or is it bottom—of the 10 worst-reviewed films new on Netflix in June.\n\nGiven that the film series’ second chapter, Insurgent, scored a “rotten” 28% RT rating for the No. 5 slot, it only seemed fitting that Allegiant should get the No. 1 spot all to itself instead of sharing it with National Security.\n\nThe Divergent Series: Allegiant debuted on Netflix on June 1.\n\nNote: This story has been updated from its original version to reflect a tie on the list and the addition of Welcome to Marwen."
