        "text": "I'm sure that many viewers will point out with venim that the film was inaccurate with regard to the conflict in Northern Ireland, as well as Brad's accent, which, personally, I thought he had put some work into.\n\nThe film is basically a thriller using the N.I conflicts as a backdrop to generate the pathos for the film; so anyone watching it to see an angle on the troubles will be disappoiinted.\n\nHowever it gave Pitt a chance to show off his ability to be directed and follow staged fight scenes. He was his usual brilliant self at emotional expression.\n\nThe purpose of his journey to The States was almost glossed over with the film relying on the first few scenes to show why he had such a vengful purpose.\n\nThe title of the film is fairly misleading, as it serves only as an extra tag line. This is NOT a deep or meaningful film in any way, nor does it contain much accurate historical fact. The 'morphing' of the young boy after seeing a close family member being shot was a little hurried, but served to get you into the rhythm of the film.\n\nAs there were very few people actually hunting or chasing him on screen except for Ford, his worth for information/intelligence as far as those around him were concerned was almost nil.... but his intentions were far more sinister.\n\nMaybe the point of the film was to demonstrate that to win the cause closest to your heart or carry out duty through conscience or revenge, you may have to kill the person who gets in your way. Either way the wasting of a life comes down to the same thing no matter how it's done.\n\nI realise that it must have been a rather insulting film to those close to the troubles, in terms of trivialisation and attitude, but to repeat my earlier comment, the title of the film was a little misleading, and it may have given rise to higher expectations.\n\nHowever Pitt's accent wasn't that bad, and his mannerisms were clearly worked on, and all in all the film was entertaining.\n\nAt least the film allowed you to reach your own conclusion at the end, and didn't particularly force any political points on the viewer."
