        "text": "Ahead of Columbia Pictures‘ 100th anniversary on January 10, 2024, Sony Pictures Entertainment has unveiled a new logo for the company to celebrate the occasion.\n\nThe design for the centennial logo, which you can view below, is framed on Columbia Pictures’ historic “Lady with the Torch” iconography. An enhanced glow to the torch symbolizes the vibrancy of the company’s history, having grown from humble beginnings to become one of the leading film studios, renowned for producing award-winning and trailblazing films that have boldly reflected societal issues of the times. With the highest number of Academy Award Best Pictures wins, Columbia Pictures has entertained audiences for ten decades and continues to create cultural impact to this day.\n\nSony will further celebrate the anniversary with the release of a commemorative book highlighting 100 iconic moments of Columbia Pictures. The studio will also mark the occasion with festival screenings and live concerts of prominent film scores, while debuting curated home entertainment products celebrating the scope of the studio’s library. Additional details regarding the 100 Year Anniversary celebration will be revealed throughout the year.\n\nSaid Tom Rothman, Chairman & CEO of Sony Pictures’ Motion Picture Group, “There is one thing that separates a major studio from all other content producers: history. At Columbia, that history is reflected in the countless cultural talismans created by thousands of people over now 100 years. All of us at Columbia are proud of that legacy and honored to celebrate it.”\n\nFounded by brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and best friend Joe Brandt, initially under the name Cohn-Brandt-Cohn, the studio now known as Columbia Pictures came into being on January 10, 1924. It was after Frank Capra’s 1934 classic It Happened One Night swept the Oscars that Columbia established itself as one of the all-time greats, and in the years since, it’s gone on to produce many of history’s most iconic films. Among them are It Happened One Night, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, You Can’t Take It With You, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, From Here to Eternity, On the Waterfront, Lawrence of Arabia, To Sir, with Love, Funny Girl, Taxi Driver, Tootsie, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Boyz n the Hood, Groundhog Day, A League of Their Own, The Social Network, Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood and Little Women.\n\nOver the years, the studio has also stewarded such huge franchises as Spider-Man, Bad Boys, Men in Black, Jumanji, Hotel Transylvania, The Karate Kid, and The Equalizer, among others. Its highest grossing film to date is the 2021 smash Spider-Man: No Way Home, which grossed over $1.9 billion globally.\n\nRecent releases from Columbia include Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the Jennifer Lawrence sex comedy No Hard Feelings, video game adaptation Gran Turismo, The Equalizer 3, and Dumb Money. Among those coming up next for release are Ridley Scott’s Napoleon (November 22) for Apple and the rom-com Anyone But You (December 22) starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell."
