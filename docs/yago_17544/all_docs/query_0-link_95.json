        "text": "Amnesty International has called for the immediate release of a man from the UK who is facing death under Pakistan's blasphemy laws.\n\nMohammad Asghar, from Edinburgh, was convicted and sentenced after sending letters to officials claiming to be the Prophet Mohammed.\n\nMr Asghar's lawyer has said he suffers from mental illness.\n\nHe was treated for paranoid schizophrenia in Edinburgh before he returned to Pakistan in 2010.\n\nAmnesty's deputy Asia Pacific director Polly Truscott said: \"Mohammad Asghar is now facing the gallows simply for writing a series of letters. He does not deserve punishment. No one should be charged on the basis of this sort of conduct.\n\n\"The blasphemy laws undermine the rule of law, and people facing charges risk death and other harm in detention.\n\n\"Pakistan must immediately release Mohammad Asghar and reform its blasphemy laws to ensure that this will not happen again.\"\n\nMr Asghar's lawyer has claimed his problems started when a tenant, who was in dispute with him, brought the blasphemy complaint against him to police.\n\nThe British High Commission in Islamabad said it was aware of Mr Asghar's case and provided assistance to him.\n\nLawyers said they will appeal against the conviction, and that they are worried about his mental condition and physical safety in prison."
