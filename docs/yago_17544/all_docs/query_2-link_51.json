        "text": "I was born raised and educated in Pakistan. Once I had a severe sore throat at the age of seventeen, while parents were out of town and both elder sisters were occupied in their annual school exams. No elder was available to help me. Upon my sister's suggestion, I sought the help of neighborhood Homeopathic practitioner Dr. Qureshi.\n\nI was in Dr. Qureshi's presence for twenty minutes. He jot down my case. Sore throat was splinter like pain, that was first onset of fever and weakness. I came home, took the prescribed remedy. I slept for 45 minutes and woke up in sweat. I was relieved and robust. I was stunned at the recovery speed and the revival to be normal again. I was enlightened after this healing experience. Yes in my days of ignorance, I have used some nasty allopathic drugs in a palliative way.\n\nAt the age of twenty-five after doing his Bachelors in Mathematics, I came to Untied States in 1991, that's 25 years ago. My second Bachelor is in Humanities with emphasis on Philosophy from Holy Names College, Oakland, CA in year 2001. For critical thinking in life this academic training became very helpful. In 2008 I won a community based scholarship for Resonance School of Homeopathy, Reno, NV. For next three and half years, I studied with Robert Field R.S. Hom. (N.A), C.T.Hom., A.P.H. (Nevada). That was a 564 (3 and half years) hours of training in theory and clinical practice.\n\nI am a therapist and Homeopathy - a holistic system of medicine is my healing art. I prescribe homeopathic remedies in a very low dilution according to my Advance Practitioner of Homeopathy (A.P.H.) License awarded by NVBHME - Nevada State Board of Homeopathic Medical Examiners. The remedies are non-invasive in nature. I have it since August 13, 2011. Under state law and for oversight Greg Fihn, D.O., H.M.D. is my supervising physician since February 1st, 2014.\n\nI read humans through their uncomfortable symptoms. When someone explains sickness with disease names that is not helpful, I translate their language the explanation of their ills into Homeopathy and help them to heal. So the list of these cluster of pathological names help and direct us, but in a limited way:\n\nAllergies, Arthritis, ADHD, Asthma, Auto Immune Disorders, Autism, Bronchitis, Bipolar Disorders, Bruxism, Cervical Spondylitis, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression & Anxiety, Digestion Problems, Ear Infections, Endometriosis, Epilepsy, Female & Male Hormonal problems, Mammary Cysts, Obsessive Compulsiveness, PTSD, Sinusitis and many more.\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century one prominent Homeopath Dr. Eugene B. Nash of New York wrote in his book Leaders in Respiratory Organs said, \"According to our art, symptomatical indications, is of far more importance for curative purposes.- He further said, \"...it is obvious that the names of disease have little to do after all with prescribing, I mean good prescribing; but the case in its entirety, the patient, with all his individuality and idiosyncrasies, must be taken into account.-\n\nIn Homeopathy the practitioner takes totality of mental, emotional, physical and spiritual symptoms to understand an ailing human. But I am best, when any acute or chronic disease becomes a mystery, and health a dilemma, that's when the truth of Homeopathy is revealed."
