        "text": "Capital city of Pakistan\n\nThis article is about the capital city of Pakistan. For other uses, see Islamabad (disambiguation).\n\nFederal capital city in Islamabad Capital Territory, Pakistan\n\nIslamabad ( ;[7] Urdu: اسلام‌آباد, romanized: Islāmābād, listenⓘ; transl. 'City of Islam') is the capital city of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.[8] It is the country's ninth-most populous city with a population of over 1.2 million people[5][9] and is federally administered by the Pakistani government as part of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Built as a planned city in the 1960s and established in 1967, it replaced Karachi as Pakistan's national capital.\n\nThe Greek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis developed Islamabad's master plan, in which he divided it into eight zones; the city comprises administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, as well as rural and green areas administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the Capital Development Authority. Islamabad is known for its parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian.[10] It is home to several landmarks, including the country's flagship Faisal Mosque, which is the world's fifth-largest mosque. Other prominent landmarks include the Pakistan Monument and Democracy Square.[11][12][13]\n\nRated as Gamma + by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[14] Islamabad has the highest cost of living in Pakistan. The city's populace is dominated by both middle and upper-middle class citizens.[15][16] Islamabad is home to twenty universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam University, PIEAS, COMSATS University, and NUST.[17] It is also rated as one of the safest cities in Pakistan and has an expansive RFID-enabled surveillance system with almost 2,000 active CCTV cameras.[18][19]\n\nToponymy\n\nThe name Islamabad means City of Islam. It is derived from two words: Islam and abad. Islam refers to the religion of Islam, Pakistan's state religion, and -abad is a Persian suffix meaning cultivated place, indicating an inhabited place or city.[20] According to a history book by Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh, teacher and poet Qazi Abdur Rehman Amritsari proposed the name of the city.[21][22]\n\nOccasionally in writing, Islamabad is colloquially abbreviated ISB. Such usage originated in SMS language, in part due to the IATA location identifier for the Islamabad International Airport.\n\nHistory\n\nMain article: History of Islamabad\n\nEarly history\n\nIslamabad Capital Territory, located on the Pothohar Plateau of the northern Punjab region, is considered one of the earliest sites of human settlement in Asia.[23] Some of the earliest Stone Age artefacts in the world have been found on the plateau, dating from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Rudimentary stones recovered from the terraces of the Soan River testify to the endeavours of early man in the inter-glacial period.[24] Items of pottery and utensils dating back to prehistory have been found.[25]\n\nExcavations by Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Lone reveal evidence of a prehistoric culture in the area. Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE that indicate the region was home to Neolithic peoples who settled on the banks of the Soan[23] and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE.[24][26]\n\nThe Indus Valley civilization flourished in the region between the 23rd and 18th centuries BCE. Later the area was an early settlement of the Aryan community which migrated into the region from Central Asia.[23] Many great armies such as those of Zahiruddin Babur, Genghis Khan, Timur and Ahmad Shah Durrani crossed the region during their invasions of the Indian subcontinent.[23][27] In 2015–16, the Federal Department of Archaeology and Museums, with the financial support of National Fund for Cultural Heritage, carried out initial archaeological excavations in which unearthed the remains of a Buddhist stupa at Ban Faqiran, near the Shah Allah Ditta caves, which was dated to the 2nd to the 5th century CE.[28]\n\n15th-century Pharwala Fort beside the Swaan River\n\nThe Shrine of Meher Ali Shah was completed immediately before construction began on the future capital city just east of the shrine\n\nThe caves at Shah Allah Ditta, on Islamabad's outskirts, were part of an ancient Buddhist monastic community\n\nThe restored village of Saidpur predates the surrounding city of Islamabad\n\nConstruction and development\n\nMain article: Developments in Islamabad\n\nWhen Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the southern port city of Karachi was its provisional national capital. In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site near Rawalpindi for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements, along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959 which was used as provisional capital from that year on.[29][30] In the 1960s, Islamabad was constructed as a forward capital for several reasons.[31] Karachi was also located at the southern end of the country, and exposed to attacks from the Arabian Sea. Pakistan needed a capital that was easily accessible from all parts of the country.[29][32] Karachi, a business centre, was also considered unsuitable partly because of intervention of business interests in government affairs.[33] The newly selected location of Islamabad was closer to the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the disputed territory of Kashmir in the north.[23]\n\nA Greek firm of architects, led by Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis, designed the master plan of the city based on a grid plan which was triangular in shape with its apex towards the Margalla Hills.[34] The capital was not moved directly from Karachi to Islamabad; it was first shifted temporarily to Rawalpindi in the early 1960s and then to Islamabad when essential development work was completed in 1966.[35] In 1981, Islamabad separated from Punjab province to form Capital Territory. Such world-renowned architects as Edward Durell Stone and Gio Ponti have been associated with the city's development.[36]\n\nRecent history\n\nIslamabad has attracted people from all over Pakistan, making it one of the most cosmopolitan and urbanised cities of Pakistan.[37] As the capital city it has hosted numerous important meetings, such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in 2004.[38]\n\nThe city suffered damage from the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which had a magnitude of 7.6.[39] Islamabad has experienced a series of terrorist incidents including the July 2007 Siege of Lal Masjid (Red Mosque), the June 2008 Danish embassy bombing, and the September 2008 Marriott bombing.[40] In 2011, four terrorism incidents occurred in the city, killing four people, including the murder of the Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer.[41]\n\nConstruction of the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus, the region's first mass transit line, began in February 2014 and was completed in March 2015. The Rawalpindi Development Authority built the project at a cost of approximately Rs 24 billion, which was shared by both the Federal government and the provincial government of Punjab.[42]\n\nGeography\n\nMain article: Geography of Islamabad\n\nSatellite view of Islamabad-Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area with Margalla Hills in the north.\n\nMargalla Hills, Islamabad\n\nIslamabad's verdant cityscape merges with the Margalla Hills\n\nIslamabad's lush landscape\n\nIslamabad's deciduous trees change colours in autumn\n\nIslamabad is located at at the northern edge of the Pothohar Plateau and at the foot of the Margalla Hills in Islamabad Capital Territory. Its elevation is 540 metres (1,770 ft).[43][44] The modern capital and the ancient Gakhar city of Rawalpindi form a conurbation and are commonly referred to as the Twin Cities.[45][33]\n\nTo the northeast of the city lies the colonial era hill station of Murree, and to the north lies the Haripur District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Kahuta lies on the southeast, Taxila, Wah Cantt, and Attock District to the northwest, Gujar Khan, Rawat, and Mandrah on the southeast, and the metropolis of Rawalpindi to the south and southwest. Islamabad is located 120 kilometres (75 mi) SSW of Muzaffarabad, 185 kilometres (115 mi) east of Peshawar and 295 kilometres (183 mi) NNW of Lahore.\n\nIslamabad covers an area of 906 square kilometres (350 sq mi).[46] A further 2,717 square kilometres (1,049 sq mi) area is known as the Specified Area, with the Margala Hills in the north and northeast. The southern portion of the city is an undulating plain. It is drained by the Kurang River, on which the Rawal Dam is located.[36]\n\nClimate\n\nMain article: Climate of Islamabad\n\nIslamabad has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: Cwa), with five seasons: Winter (November–February), Spring (March and April), Summer (May and June), Rainy Monsoon (July and August) and Autumn (September and October). The hottest month is June, where average highs routinely exceed 38 °C (100.4 °F). The wettest month is July, with heavy rainfalls and evening thunderstorms with the possibility of cloudburst and flooding. The coolest month is January.\n\nIslamabad's micro-climate is regulated by three artificial reservoirs: Rawal, Simli, and Khanpur Dam.
