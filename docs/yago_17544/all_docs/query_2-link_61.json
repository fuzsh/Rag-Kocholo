        "text": "A sub-ordinate prophet, from amongst the followers of the Holy Prophet Muhammad(sa), to unite mankind in the Latter Days\n\nAll religions contain prophecies that foretell the advent of a special individual, who will come as a reformer (a prophet) in the latter days. On February 13th, 1835, in the small Indian village of Qadian, a man named Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad(as) was born. He belonged to a well-known and noble family. Learn more…\n\nAllah says in the Holy Quran:\n\n“He it is Who has raised among the unlettered people a Messenger from among themselves who recites unto them His Signs, and purifies them, and teaches them the Book and Wisdom though before that they were in manifest error; And He will raise him among others of them who have not yet joined them. He is the Mighty, the Wise.” (Surah Al-Jumuah 62:3-4)\n\nA companion of The Holy Prophet(sa) relates:\n\nOne day we were sitting with The Holy Prophet(sa) when this chapter was revealed. I enquired from Muhammad(sa). Who are the people to whom the words and among others of them who have not yet joined them refer? Salman(ra), a Persian was sitting among us. The Holy Prophet(sa) put his hand on Salman(ra) and said. If faith were to go up to the Pleiades, a man from among these would surely find it. (Bukhari).\n\nThe advent of The Holy Prophet(sa) is described metaphorically as the appearance of God Almighty. The Holy Prophet(sa) became the mirror reflecting Divine Attributes. He was Al-Abd. The Holy Quran calls him Abdullah (72:20) — The Servant of Allah. For the latter days God in His Mercy sent us the servant of The Servant — Ghulam Ahmad(sa). Mirza Ghulam Ahmad Qadiani(as) (Ahmad(as)) claimed to be a prophet who was The Promised Messiah and Mahdi. Ahmad(as) claimed to be the metaphorical second coming of Jesus(as) of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad(sa).\n\nThe Holy Quran refers to The Promised Messiah(as) as a prophet who will testify to the truth of The Holy Prophet(sa) in the words … and will be followed by a witness from Him (11:18) and … giving glad tidings of a Messenger who will come after me whose name will be Ahmad (61:7).\n\nDocumentaries\n\nEnglish books by The Promised Messiah"
