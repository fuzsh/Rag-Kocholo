Now there are many aspects with regard to his Herbalife Nima sutra Allahu taala honbu that we would like to make mention one of the greatest was his closeness to the Quran.\n\nabdulai minima sutra, the ultra was very close to the Quran. So much so that nebia Karim saw Sam said if you want to listen to someone who reads the Quran, the very same way that it was revealed to me\n\nthen listen to the Quran.\n\nHe was so close to the Quran. One day in the life of\n\na person came to America Latina when he was a califano people were very afraid of the offer.\n\nAnd he said, Oh man, there is a person in Kufa, he is teaching the people the Quran from memory. He is sitting on the member and he's not even referring to the book. He's not even referring to the Messiah. He is teaching people Quran from the memory. And Omar became angry. Omar became very sick. What happens if he makes a mistake? What happens if he does not fulfill the responsibility? And then overseer Who is he? He set up to live in moshood? Omar said Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell me before he's applied and was told if anyone has the right to teach Quran like that is applied.\n\nAnd you will recall the incident that never occurred himself, sir, one day told him Oh, Abdullah, read Quran for me. And then we occur himself. Kralik, what\n\nwas it to you when it was revealed upon you? And maybe occur himself SimCity near a smart woman ready. Today I would like to listen to the Quran from someone else. When he read. Maybe I started theory until his beard became wet. such love for the Quran, that in the beginning stages of Islam. One day someone said that we would like to hear someone read Quran, in the Kaaba in front of everyone. And then they said let us get someone who is influential that people who would harm him have to live universe who said leave the one who is influential to the hour read Quran. And he went into the Kaaba into Bay to LA and he read Surah Rahman, everyone was spellbound. And when they were\n\nfirst hearing it, he said such beautiful Kalam such beautiful words, such beautiful recitation, but when they hurt and they realize it was the Quran, they beat him up to such an extent that he was greatly bruised and greatly wounded.\n\nAnd then they told him to let me tell you not to go and read the Quran like this, he said will lie he the enemies of Islam at that time were as insignificant to me they were anything can be insignificant. If you tell me I will go read the Quran I get the same way tomorrow also in the Kaaba such love for the Holy Quran and this is one of the great aspects of Herbalife anyone screwed up is in the key concepts a new Maya pelo Quran Sakura party geocode samata para zahawi absolute la what he was telling me when said Quran sunanda key for my ski\n\nKenobi saw cinema for Maya occur kisi ko is Cara Quran suniti why Shem GSM Mira Aparna Silva to eponymous Buddha Viola Thomas A Quran Sunnah. So beautiful. This was an aspect with the gartley he was amongst those who was in every aspect in the life of our beloved via cream sauce them made him twice, he made he migrated first to ever Sr. Then he\n\nmigrated to Madina munawwara in every great battle abdulai Dyneema sutra Viola Tran who was amongst those who was in the forefront, right and he was a very amazing incident He will make mention that famous incident that when Libya Karim Allah Allah wa sallam was told in the Battle of who had to curse the mushrikeen and maybe occur himself. Some said I do not curse people. Allah has sent me as a Rama. Allah sent me as a mercy. This particular incident was witnessed to live in a Massoud and he is the one who related this incident in the Battle of butter\n\nis a very, very interesting incident.\n\nof Delilah Masuda. villatoro said Nivea cream sauce lamb paired me with two young and sorry Sahabi. And I said, if only nebbia cut himself sillim would have paired me with someone who was more stronger, who was more brave, or who was more greater in terms of the bravery and known for the being warriors. I would have been happy he's young, small, so happy and sad. So then all of a sudden, while I was thinking like this, these two Sahaba said this to young Sahaba said, Abdullah, tell me where is Buddha?\n\nBuddha, how\n\ncan people say what do you what are you going to do with the Buddha Buddha is the leader of the courage you will be surrounded, he will be of so many bodyguards. He said, leave us we heard that he has been convenient in a cream sauce and we will not rest until we go and attack him whether we die or whether he dies. And Abdullah knows who said he swab Abu Jamal at a distance he said Daisy, and he said they when they fled, and they put their lives at risk to such an extent they attacked Abu Jamal and he was almost on the verge of death while fighting an attacking about your health. One of those youngsters\n\nwas seven by someone who used the sword against him. while fighting you couldn't bear it. So he put his arm under his legs. And he severed that arm and he continued fighting until he put a bow on the verge of death. He still he still wasn't dead. Up to live. He was so sad I went to follow. And then I found about Joel. Now just look at this amazing thing. abdulai minima sutra, the Lao Tzu was the one who had the greatest humanity's greatest simplicity, simplicity, was not very influential, and alive, users have to live\n\nwith his simplicity and his humanity to kill the most arrogant person in this moment.\n\ndoubt the most arrogant person at that time was a Buddha, and I use a very simple person to kill him. And you would recall that in the books of history make mention that when abdulai moshood came upon a Buddha and he was on the life's last stages of his life. Abu Jamal said what is the outcome of the battle to live university? What are you asking the outcome Allah has given a small victory. So he said he showed me said if only someone more greater than you, if only someone who is more influential that you can kill me such arrogance at the time of his death, and then he tells akula if you want to kill me on top of my head, don't cut it off here near the neck, cut it off, you're near\n\nthe chest, so that when I die, my head will stand out like this. Such a great coffee. Such a great disbelievers such great arrogance. And I use a blue lightning was to kill him and maybe a cream sauce sort of when when the resourcing was setting up to live in Massoud said yaroslava katella. Do alive kill the enemy of of Allah. How amazing. This is an aspect with up yonder port adversity are under attack Egypt Petra, Allah is a mirage shucks, Abu jihad, Kolkata kalmykia abdulai. Moscow St. Monica, what an amazing thing. Then another aspect with regard to it just to show you his status. show you his status. One\n\ndelivey occurring Salatu was Salam was sitting among the Sahaba\n\nwhen Abdullah Massoud was nearby from a tree from a cashew tree or something he was coming down. He was very thin. He was not very influential. His appearance also wasn't very striking. So when he was coming down because of the thinness of his legs, the people started laughing,\n\nsticks to her house than he is. And then they started laughing himself since that Why are you laughing? Are you laughing at his appearance? how weak is a lawyer you laughing at his weakness on the day of Tiamat in terms of his carnamah in terms of his achievements, in terms of his homage to lightning Massoud would be more weightier and heavier than the amount of work.\n\nWhen you go to Medina you see the amount of\n\nepisodes and said he's more heavier than even the amount of who had up to somewhat maturity. mugger carnamah or Amal millboard Beretta Jessica Mendez, Wakayama, Mata\n\nKi carnamah Rama, Jabberwocky Parker, one of the greatest aspect with regard to him was that nebia cream sauce lamb himself taught him how to read salah and he said, maybe sir, someone taught me to read Salah. And how did he teach me to read salah and this is something you and I must learn how we teach our youngsters. He said nobody saw Salaam took his hand and his palm, put it on my thigh and said Abdullah read after me the shelf wood and all the doors of the show what he taught him like this mob but teach your children with mohabbat teach him the Quran. Teach him to come close to the deal with Mahabharata and love our nebbia cream sauce and taught up to live in Masuda Viola how many\n\nincidents time is going so I will just make mention of one or two. You know, one was that a\n\nlot of love for\n\na doula so much love If anyone spoke against a doula Vinnie Massoud O'Meara the ultimate used to get angry. The people of Kufa one day asked a doula.

I'm setting up live in in Moscow to teach your dean. So now sent him to teach the people of Iraq D. Do you know what a great repercussion that was? Because from from Iraq from Kufa was in Oman\n\nand up to Lima sutra, the Allahu taala, who is regarded to be the founder of the thick of\n\nmany of the alama and those people who follow the fate of Abu hanifah Rahmatullah Lee I indebted to acolyte. ultimo because morellato sent him to Kufa he taught the people of Kufa amongst them from the project he was\n\nin his is regarded to be the founder of the fit coffee mug and\n\nsuch a great person with regard to his, you know, he's amazing, I will just give you one amazing incident and I will conclude this you know, one day humara villatoro saw a car fly.

We are going to Makkah but the word\n\nbaiting amok is using the 17 superar of the Holy Quran. So Omar said in the fee him Halima in this particular group, there is a person who is an alum.
