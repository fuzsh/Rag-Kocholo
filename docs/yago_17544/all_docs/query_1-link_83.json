        "text": "LONDON: Dozens of leading UK imams (religious leaders) have issued a joint statement condemning the right-wing media and politicians for normalising hatred of Islam, Muslims and immigrants — resulting in riots that have erupted almost across Britain.\n\nIn a statement sent to Geo News, the imams have said: “For decades, through the War on Terror discourse of \"terrorism\", “extremism”, and the purported failure of multiculturalism, by predominantly neoconservative politicians across the political spectrum have fuelled the narrative that migrants generally, and Muslims in particular, are the problem.\n\n“By disregarding Muslims and making disturbing remarks concerning immigration during the recent election campaign, including the current prime minister’s remarks on Bangladeshi communities, has created an environment which we believe has resulted in the recent events.\n\n“Fundamentally connected to these policies is the ongoing genocide against Palestinians by the rogue occupier of Palestine, Israel. Zionist far-right agitators, such as Tommy Robinson amongst others, who have a history of support from pro-Israeli neoconservatives in the United States and the United Kingdom, have been mobilising a pushback, often violent and disorderly, against pro-Palestine protests.\n\n“Broadening their focus, these agitators have been actively spreading anti-Islam, anti-migrant propaganda and falsehoods to their networks, deflecting focus away from Israel’s crimes and the wider failures of successive British governments.”\n\nThe imams say all this has emboldened the far-right animus and unlocked a shocking level of violence. Far-right mobs have attacked mosques, assaulted Muslims, mobbed black men, committed arson against hotels, and even burned down a Citizens Advice Bureau.\n\nThe statement says: “Muslims are brave by nature and will defend themselves, their mosques and their property. However, our communities are also concerned for the safety of all individuals. This civilised attitude should not be mistaken for cowardice or inaction.\n\n“Finally, we are shocked by the government's failure to refer to what has taken place as Islamophobic — this further reiterates what the Forde Report found that the Labour Party has a hierarchical system and that anti-black racism and Islamophobia are not treated with the same degree of seriousness as antisemitism.\"\n\nThe religious leaders have also called on Muslims to: “Strengthen your connection with Allah Almighty and whoever fears Allah — He will make for him a way out. Continue exposing the horrific Israeli crimes and those complicit in them. We should not fall into the trap of redirecting focus away from Gaza, the West Bank, and Masjid Al-Aqsa.\n\n\"We expect the relevant authorities to take appropriate measures to ensure that all people and places of worship targeted are safe. However, in the absence of security, the general populace should take all legal measures to protect themselves and their places of worship.\n\n“Avoid vigilantism and escalation, as this will feed into a pro-Israeli neoconservative agenda to downplay the impact on Muslims by framing the Muslim responses as “Islamist” while minimising the far-right agitation as “legitimate grievances”. Avoid the covering of faces, as this adds to the false impression of vigilantism and wrongdoing.\n\n“Where circumstances permit, suitable Muslims from the community should engage the far-right perpetrators of violence with the light of Islam and the aim of correcting false narratives.”\n\nThe imams have asked the government to address the far-right threat seriously, not by eroding privacy, but by upholding the rule of law.\n\n“Implement primary legislation to deal with hate speech online and hold to account all those who are complicit in the spread of misinformation and Islamophobia. Equalise the racial and religious incitement legislation and remove the need for intent when prosecuting incitement to religious hatred. Incitement and hatred against Muslims go unchallenged because it is legal to do so.\n\n\"Improve media regulation starting with the second part of the Leveson inquiry. Implore the press to use appropriate language when citing the racist marches and gatherings instead of calling them protestors. Commit to working with grassroots Muslim organisations such as MCB, Mend and Mab to reassure the Muslim community and to demonstrate that the government is serious about tackling Islamophobia.”\n\nThe statement has been signed by the following imams:\n\nShaykh Haitham al Haddad, London.\n\nDr Mufti Abdur Rahman, London.\n\nShaykh Zahir Mahmood, Birmingham.\n\nMl Yasir al Hanafi, Aylesbury.\n\nDr Mufti Yusuf Shabbir, Blackburn.\n\nMl Muhammad Tahir, London.\n\nImam Khalil Ahmed, London.\n\nImam Sajid Patel, London.\n\nImam Zeeshan Qayum, London.\n\nShaikh Bodrul Hussain, Dagenham.\n\nImam Raza Ali, London.\n\nImam Abu Aasiyah Mohammed, London.\n\nImam Aadil Jabir, London.\n\nImam Afzal Ahmed, London.\n\nImam Shah Muhammed, London.\n\nImam Muhammad Anas, London.\n\nImam Khaled Ahmed, London.\n\nImam Mohmed Hussein Ali, London.\n\nImam Husain Patel, Bolton.\n\nImam Safwaan Hussein, Dundee.\n\nImam Suliman Gani, London.\n\nImam Syed Ahmed, Kidderminster.\n\nImam Ebrahim Noor, Coventry.\n\nImam Talha Patel, Bolton.\n\nImam Mohammed Abubakar, Huddersfield.\n\nMufti Muhammad Sajjad, Birmingham.\n\nImam Sami Choudhury, Wednesbury.\n\nImam Liaquat Zaman, Birmingham.\n\nImam Abdullah Patel, Gloucester.\n\nImam Fazal Hassan, Blackburn.\n\nImam Mohammed Yahya Sidyot, Manchester.\n\nImam Zubair Yusufzai , Luton.\n\nImam Fuad Abdo, Greater London.\n\nImam Waseem Amin, Glasgow.\n\nMufti Mohammed Dilwar Hussain, London.\n\nImam Huzayfah Mangarah , London.\n\nImam Muhammad Ashraf, London.\n\nImam Azhar Muhammad, Birmingham.\n\nImam Hifzur Rahman, London.\n\nImam Shah Abdul Aziz Afridi, Blackburn.\n\nImam Raja Imaad Ishaq, Batley.\n\nImam Khabbaab Ahmad, Batley.\n\nImam Muhammad Shuaib, Birmingham.\n\nImam Adam Ayub, Bolton.\n\nImam Mohammad Sala Uddin, Birmingham.\n\nImam Ahmed Zaman, Birmingham.\n\nImam Ali-Haider Abdul Rashid, Sheffield.\n\nShaykh Shaqur Rehman, London.\n\nImam Asif Afsar, Birmingham.\n\nImam Umar Hussain, Birmingham.\n\nImam Shah Muaz Ahmed, London.\n\nImam Mohammed Al-Masud, Birmingham.\n\nImam Imtiaz Lorgat, Birmingham.\n\nImam Ahmed Suleman Sidat, Blackburn.\n\nImam Suhayb Qayyum, Birmingham.\n\nImam Qasim Hussain, London.\n\nMufti Ismail Satia, Blackburn.\n\nImam Tauseef Rahman, Blackburn.\n\nImam Shafiq Mohammed, London.\n\nShaykh Abu Muhammad, Bradford.\n\nImam Hammad Mangera, Birmingham.\n\nShaykh Aqif Naqash, Edinburgh.\n\nImam Huzaifah Ibrahim, London.\n\nUstadha Dr. Umm Ibrahim, Birmingham.\n\nMufti Haroon Hussain, Birmingham.\n\nImam Asif Mahmud, Slough.\n\nImam Hanif Dudhwala, Blackburn.\n\nImam Osman Sardoiwala, Nottingham.\n\nImam Omar Kadeer Khan, Birmingham.\n\nImam Ibraheem Saleem, High Wycombe.\n\nImam Tahir Patel, Birmingham.\n\nImam Mohammed Farook Kazi, Preston.\n\nImam Umair Zulfiqar, London.\n\nImam Abdurrahman Al-Masum, Birmingham.\n\nImam Ammar Mulla, Preston.\n\nImam Muhammad Ail Hassan, Blackburn.\n\nImam Zakwan Patel, Lancaster.\n\nImam Arif Panchbhaya, Newport.\n\nImam Nazir Khalifa, Coventry.\n\nImam Anwar Shaikh, Coventry.\n\nImam Mohammed Moreea, London."
