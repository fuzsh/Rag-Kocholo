        "text": "ISLAMABAD:\n\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader and social activist Sanam Javed is currently residing with her family at the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) House in Islamabad, according to sources.\n\nK-P Chief Minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, reportedly reached out to Javed's father, requesting that the family reside at K-P House. The spokesperson for K-P House, Yar Muhammad Niazi, confirmed that Sanam Javed and her family are staying there voluntarily.\n\nYesterday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) permitted Javed to return home and ordered the police not to arrest her until Thursday, warning that if she speaks a single word during this period, the court will revoke its order.\n\nAccording to Express News, Sanam Javedâ€™s father approached the IHC for her release, leading to a hearing presided over by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq appeared before the court.\n\nJaved was initially released from Gujranwala Jail but was then taken into custody by Islamabad police and handed over to Balochistan police, who intended to transfer her to Quetta. '\n\nHowever, the high court has prohibited any such move, ensuring she remains in Islamabad for the time being.\n\nIt is to be noted that the IHC summoned the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP) to assist the court on a constitutional matter in the case of Sanam Javed whether she could be arrested in multiple cases over one incident of May 9.\n\nIHC Justice Miangul Hasan Aurangzeb issued a written order after the case hearing. The order stated that Sanam Javed had never been punished in any case in the past, but she has been detained in different police stations for more than a year.\n\nThe question arises whether Sanam Javed could be arrested in several cases over one incident on May 9, it said, adding that the question was of constitutional importance, so it was also important to determine how it was dealt with."
