Masood Ahmad and Ramsha Masood\n\nIndian Journal of Gender Studies, 2020, vol. 27, issue 1, 77-100\n\nAbstract: The study explores the phenomenon of street harassment and its socio-psychological implications on women living in the capital city of Islamabad, Pakistan. Street harassment represents a form of gender violence that violates human dignity by making the female victims feel vulnerable and insecure in public spaces. The findings have been compiled on the basis of empirical analyses of the views of 200 female students from eight different universities of Islamabad, Pakistan. The study reveals that objectification, street harassment and abuse are incontrovertible parts of womenÃ¢â¬â¢s lives in Pakistan. Despite constituting more than half of the population in the Pakistan, women continue to live in a patriarchal milieu that thrives on harassment, discrimination and oppression against them in both public and private spheres. The study concludes that the menace of street harassment entails devastating emotional, physical and psychological impacts and recommends that policy interventions be undertaken to curb this heinous act perpetrated against women.\n\nKeywords: Street harassment; women victims; public spaces; socio-psychological impacts; mobility (search for similar items in EconPapers)\n\nDate: 2020\n\nReferences: View references in EconPapers View complete reference list from CitEc\n\nCitations: Track citations by RSS feed\n\nDownloads: (external link)\n\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0971521519891480 (text/html)\n\nRelated works:\n\nThis item may be available elsewhere in EconPapers: Search for items with the same title.\n\nExport reference: BibTeX RIS (EndNote, ProCite, RefMan) HTML/Text\n\nPersistent link: https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:sae:indgen:v:27:y:2020:i:1:p:77-100\n\nDOI: 10.1177/0971521519891480\n\nAccess Statistics for this article"
