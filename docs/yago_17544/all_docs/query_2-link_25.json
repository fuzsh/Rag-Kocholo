        "text": "Get To Know Me\n\nWhy should someone choose you to care for their health?\n\nI am part of a team of excellent hospitalists and pride myself in providing up-to-date, comprehensive care.\n\nWhat is the most important thing your patients should expect from their professional relationship with you? What do you expect from them?\n\nMy patients can expect my full devotion to their care and attention to detail. It's best to communicate clearly and address patients' questions and concerns in a timely manner.\n\nHow do you spend your personal time when you're not caring for patients?\n\nI love cooking for my family, traveling to all different parts of the world and reading about different cultures.\n\nWhy did you choose your specialty and what is its greatest reward?\n\nWhen I was 7, my mother had an accident and I admired the doctors who cared for her. The greatest reward of medical practice is when a patient gets well and goes home with a smile."
