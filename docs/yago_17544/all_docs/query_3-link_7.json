With its rich history and vibrant culture, the South Asian nation has been gaining attraction among expats and digital nomads in search of a fresh adventure. As industries open up to foreign talent, the opportunity to shape a meaningful career and carve out a real place in the Pakistani community has never been more within grasp.\n\nWith a population exceeding 230 million, including 47,000 British expats, Pakistan tells a story of diversity and resilience, offering a unique blend of traditional and modern styles of living, from the bustling urban centres of Islamabad and Lahore to serene mountainous landscapes. Immerse yourself in the local hospitality, savour traditional Pakistani cuisine and enjoy a culture that values both its heritage and a desire for progress.\n\nIf Pakistan sounds like your next destination, use this article as a practical guide, helping you navigate everything from the cost of living in Pakistan’s most popular expat cities, to visa requirements and finding the best jobs. Here’s everything you need to know about living expat life in Pakistan.\n\nA traditional style truck in Pakistan / GETTY IMAGES\n\nLife in Pakistan: What to expect from moving to Pakistan as an expat\n\nWith the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman to the south, and land borders with India, Afghanistan, Iran and China, Pakistan is a country with an eclectic mix of cultural influences, having been ruled by various kingdoms, empires and dynasties throughout its history.\n\nToday, Pakistan is the fifth most populous country in the world and continues to make good economic progress year-on-year, with a GDP growth rate of 6.5% as of 2021. That said, Pakistan is still very much a developing country with ongoing political upheaval, and expats considering the move to live and work in Pakistan should make sure to put their safety first and have good international health insurance in place.\n\nProtect yourself and your family while living and working abroad\n\nGet international health insurance designed for expats\n\nWhat is life in Pakistan like?\n\nExpats in Pakistan can expect a warm and hospitable culture, with locals often extending a welcoming hand to newcomers. However, concerns about safety and crime rates, while improving, do still exist. Expats are advised to stay informed, take necessary precautions, and be mindful of their surroundings.\n\nThe economy in Pakistan is experiencing a period of growth, offering expats a range of job opportunities, especially in sectors like IT, finance, manufacturing, and telecommunications. The cost of living in Pakistan is also generally reasonable compared to most Western countries, providing expats with the chance to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without breaking the bank. Navigating the job market may require some adaptability and networking, but the potential for professional growth as an expat in Pakistan is substantial.\n\nAccess to amenities and the quality of public transport varies across regions, with buses tending to be overcrowded and drivers often reported for recklessness on the roads. Expats in Pakistan will benefit greatly if they can afford a personal car, allowing them to navigate the country in comfort.\n\nIn major cities, like Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, expats can enjoy all the usual modern amenities, including shopping centres, restaurants, cinemas and cultural attractions. Meanwhile, cricket is by far the most popular sport in Pakistan, so if you want to get involved with the locals, be sure to find a screen on match days.\n\nAnd finally, Pakistan is primarily an Islamic country, with religion playing a significant role in shaping the culture, traditions and daily life of people in Pakistan. From expectations around public dress, to food and social norms, it’s key to be respectful of Islamic practices and traditions while living in Pakistan.\n\nIs Pakistan safe for expats?\n\nWhile Pakistan has its share of security challenges, including occasional incidents of violence and terrorism, many expats live and work in the country without any major issues. Safety in Pakistan has improved significantly since the Taliban peak in 2012 and cities like Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi now have large expat communities where efforts have been made to ensure the safety of foreign nationals.\n\nAs an expat in Pakistan, it can help to establish a network of local contacts, including fellow expats who can provide community and guidance on navigating safely through daily life.\n\nSafety is one of the most important factors for expats\n\nWhat are the safest countries in the world?\n\nHow is the political situation in Pakistan?\n\nPakistan is undergoing a period of political unrest after former Prime Minister Imran Khan of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party was removed from office in a vote of no confidence and subsequently sentenced to 10 years in prison, while also being the subject of an assassination attempt.\n\nDespite numerous accusations of electoral fraud, the February 2024 general election in Pakistan produced no clear majority, with votes split between the PTI, the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) and the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP). In March 2024, the PML and PPP, along with a number of smaller and independent parties, agreed to form a coalition government with Shehbaz Sharif – brother of disgraced politician Nawaz Sharif – becoming Prime Minister of Pakistan for the second time.\n\nIn the wake of Imran Khan’s arrest and the controversial 2024 election, the PTI has called on citizens across Pakistan to take part in organised protests, which have subsequently met with fierce and occasionally violent police resistance.\n\nAs an expat in Pakistan, it is strongly advised you keep track of upcoming political protests and try to avoid them, and that you do not take part in them.\n\nWhat language do they speak in Pakistan?\n\nPakistan is a multilingual country with several languages spoken across its regions. The two official languages of Pakistan are Urdu and English. Urdu is also the national language of Pakistan and is widely used in government, education, and on other official occasions. That said, only about 8% of Pakistanis speak Urdu as their first language.\n\nApart from Urdu and English, Pakistan is home to a variety of regional languages. Punjabi, is the most widely spoken of the regional languages, with 44% of Pakistani Punjabis using it as their first language. Meanwhile, Pashto, the official language of neighbouring Afghanistan, is spoken by over 15% of the population. Other languages include Sindhi and Balochi, which are prominent in some provinces.\n\nWhen it comes to living in Pakistan, expats will find that locals often use their regional languages for daily communication, while Urdu and English are used as bridges for social contexts. It will be considered polite to learn some basic phrases in Urdu or Punjabi, even though expats should find navigating life with English as their main language.\n\nIt’s can be challenging if you aren’t familiar with the local language\n\nWe cover the 5 best languages to learn as an expat\n\nCost of living in Pakistan\n\nThe cost of living in Pakistan is generally lower compared to many Western countries, making it an attractive destination for expats and digital nomads. The affordability of everything from rent to transport and eating out makes Pakistan an easy place to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nThis being said, the cost of living can increase in more affluent or expat-centric neighbourhoods, and certain imported goods may be more expensive. Additionally, factors such as education and healthcare could add to your monthly expenses.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the cost of day-to-day expenses in Pakistan’s most popular cities for expats.\n\nCost of living in Islamabad\n\nLiving in Islamabad is a popular choice for many expats moving to Pakistan.

It typically ranges from PKR 5,000/US$18 to PKR 50,000/US$180 or more, depending on the bank and the type of account you choose.\n\nOnce you’ve submitted your application, the bank will review it and notify you of their decision – this usually takes around 7 to 15 days.
