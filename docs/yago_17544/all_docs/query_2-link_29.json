        "text": "Many fine journalists are “accidents of history”; individuals who turn to this craft unexpectedly when tumultuous events upset their hopes and dreams. Journalism is not something you need a diploma for, unlike the law, accountancy or medicine. The best way to learn is on the job, from people who know how to do it. Many try and fail. A fair few succeed and Ahmad Masood is one of them. In late 2001, Masood was 21 and living in the town of Jab-al-Sarraj, a staging post for Northern Alliance forces in the Panjshir Valley. His dream had been to flee Afghanistan and join a brother in London. Then 9/11 happened. With excellent self-taught English, he offered himself as a “fixer” to foreign journalists converging on Jab-al-Sarraj for the war. His first job, earning $100 a day, was with a Reuters Television cameraman, then with a Reuters photographer and journalist Ros Russell. He accompanied them into Kabul on the heels of the Northern Alliance. “He’s the best by far. Hire him,” Ros told me when I kindly “ inherited“ Masood from her."
