        "text": "I’m a physician specializing in treating allergies, asthma and immunologic conditions. My care approach is always to look at patients with empathy and help them understand their disease process. My goal is to work with patients and their families to help them find a solution that will result in providing symptom relief from their disease.\n\nAs a child growing up, I saw relatives who struggled daily due to asthma. I was motivated to make a difference in their lives and the lives of others. I primarily focus on young people who need help to improve their quality of life.\n\nI'm honored to have been consistently selected as a Cincinnati Top Doctor in Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in private practice for over a dozen years. This honor has continued during my time at Cincinnati Children's.\n\nWhen I’m not working, I love listening to music, traveling and painting. I am also fond of playing tennis and have gotten into pickleball."
