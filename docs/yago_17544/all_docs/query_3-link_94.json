Park View’s expansion has exceeded the expectations of investors worldwide. The particulars of the development process are as follows:\n\nMain Boulevard and Roads\n\nThe 200-foot main boulevard starting from Malot Road has been constructed. There is a wide network of roads in addition to this spectacular avenue. The streets and roadways have all been carpeted and are fully operational.\n\nUnderground Water Supply, Electricity, and Sewerage System\n\nPVC has made sure that all necessities are provided to the inhabitants of the residential society. Among these facilities, they gave priority to the inclusion of underground power, water supply, and sewage system.\n\nHorticulture and Plantations\n\nThe World Health Organization guidelines for air quality are not met in places where more than 90% of the world’s population resides. They also require cool air in addition to clean air. Despite the fact that cities are becoming hotter, trees may lower city temperatures.\n\nHence, this is why the administration of the project has made sure that distinctive and lovely plants and trees are planted all around the community.\n\nAdvancement in the Downtown Area\n\nThe Downtown Commercial Block’s construction is still going strong. The site office for the housing project is now operational, and a plaza has been built to completion. This commercial sector, which took its design cues from downtown Dubai, is currently developing into a top-tier travel destination.\n\nRestaurants in Park View City Islamabad\n\nThe food court has a sweeping perspective of the entire residential project and its surroundings. Moreover, it is situated in the most scenic area of society. As part of the planning phase, the construction of metal structures and fountains is currently in full swing. Within the following two to three months, the food court’s construction should be finished.\n\nDevelopment of A, B, C, D, and E Block in PVC\n\nThe housing society’s initial few blocks have reached the limit of their expansion. These properties are given to the owners, and houses are also constructed there. The remainder of the plots are also being built, and they will be finished shortly.\n\nPossession of Residential Plots in PVC\n\nThe owners are given possession of all plots in Blocks A, B, and D of the Housing Society because these blocks have been completely built out. The C block plots will soon be on the market for purchase. Block H also has 10 Marla plots that are ready for immediate occupancy. The residential project is the only housing society with CDA approval in its H block that grants possession after only having paid the booking payment.\n\nPossession of Commercial Plots in Park View City Islamabad\n\nLet us now discuss the presence of commercial plots inside this project. In one year, the organization has declared ownership of 3.5 Marla commercial plots, but it has not yet done so for 6 Marla, 8 Marla, or plots at “The Walk.“\n\nPrice and Market Trend Index of Park View City Islamabad\n\nThe demand for prices in Park View City has been steady for a very long time. Most of the people who have bought plots in the housing society are those who invested in it for residential purposes rather than for investment reasons. The attractive surroundings, available facilities, and price point all contribute to the project’s significance.\n\nA 5 Marla home cost roughly 43 lacs two years ago, but that price was updated in six months, resulting in a significant increase of 7 to 8 lacs. Since that time, prices have increased. A residential plot of 5 Marla is now being offered for between PKR 57 and 58 lacs.\n\nThe trend for 5 Marla and 10 Marla residential plots and 6 Marla commercial plots is stronger due to the properties’ easily marketable sizes. Since consumers seek a significant plot size for their residence, 1 Kanal plots have also demonstrated great promise.\n\nPark View City Islamabad Balloting\n\nOn March 24, 2019, the balloting and possession of plots for the qualified plots started. It began after the payment of special dues.\n\nLeading members of the housing community as well as authorized dealers of this highly regarded company were there.\n\nFor the major donors who had promptly paid their installments and dues, there was a computerized voting process. Within a week, the official paperwork bearing the designated plot number was received.\n\nHow to Book a Plot in Park View City Islamabad?\n\nTo make an online booking for any plot size or type, stop by our offices or contact us via phone. The following documents are required:\n\nCash, Pay Order, or Cross Check containing 20% of Down Payment\n\nThe applicant’s passport-sized photo\n\nPhotocopy of National Identity Card (ID)\n\nThe applicant’s identity card\n\nPhotocopy of Nominee’s or Next-of-ID Kin’s card\n\nConclusion\n\nPark View City is a wonderful option for people looking for a satisfying life.
