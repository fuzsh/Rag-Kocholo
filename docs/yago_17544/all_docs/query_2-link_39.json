        "text": "Masood Ahmed is the father of Syed, Shabnam, Tamwar and Kamil Masood and the ex husband of Zainab Khan. He is also the brother of AJ and Inzamam Ahmed and is portrayed by Nitin Gantara.\n\nBackstory[]\n\nMasood was born in Pakistan on 4th April 1961, but his family came to England when he was a baby in 1962. At some point in the early 1980's he met Zainab Khan, who was married to Yusef Khan, Masood and Zainab began an affair which culminated in Zainab leaving Yusef for Masood, which lead to Yusef setting Zainab on fire as revenge. Masood managed to save Zainab from burning to death, Masood and Zainab then had three children together (at the time) before moving to England to set up local businesses.\n\nStorylines[]\n\n2007-2009: Arrival and financial troubles[]\n\nMasood, along with his wife Zainab, and their children Shabnam and Tamwar, move the square in October 2007, it is revealed that Masood is a postman while Zainab was the owner of a chain of post offices. Masood goes to Pakistan to look after his sick father, and when he returns, he discovers that the rest of his family are in serious debt and are forced to close the post office. However, they lie to the residents of the Square by telling them that the government forced them to shut down, but soon they are forced to reveal the truth when the residents start protesting. In an attempt to turn their fortunes round, the Masood’s start a catering business. Ian Beale invests £2000 and the company merges with Ian and Christian Clarke's catering business and the company is named \"Masala Queen\". However, Zainab soon accuses Masood of stealing money from the business, but Tamwar admits he has been taking the money and giving it to his brother, Syed Masood. Masood is angry at this since Syed had stolen money from their business before, which was why he left the family before. Despite this, Zainab visits her son, but Masood thinks she is having an affair. When the truth is revealed, Masood lets Syed move to the square, where he is engaged to Amira Shah.\n\nMasood plans to take Zainab on a trip around the world, but Zainab tells her husband that she is pregnant, stopping the plans. In order to earn extra income and money, Masood works an extra shift at the taxi firm, depite being exhausted. One time during his job he is driving Rachel Branning home, but he falls asleep at the wheel and crashes the taxi. PC Henderson questions Masood about the incident and Amira lies by saying he swerved to avoid someone on a moped. The police leave and Amira tells Masood she does not want two fathers in prison, but Masood still regrets lying to the police.\n\n2010: Syed and Amira's wedding[]\n\nBefore Syed and Amira's wedding, Masood visits his brother Inzamam to ask for help in paying for the wedding. However, Zainab reveals to Masood that Inzamam has made advances at her in the past many times. Because of this, Masood tells Inzamam his money is no longer needed and he and his family are no longer welcome at his home. A month before the wedding, Masood is still unaware that there are problems in Syed and Amiras's relationship, during this time Zainab also goes into labour and Masood delivers the baby, who they name Kamil. But more problems arise as Masood's line manager David Hensler arrives with a colleague, saying there has been an allegation of stolen post, and they must search the house. During the search, they find a package of Max Branning's, and Masood receives a caution.\n\nJust before the wedding, Masood walks in on Syed and Christian kissing on the floor of Syed and Amiras' new flat and he quickly leaves.
