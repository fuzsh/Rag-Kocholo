In this article we reviewed published and unpublished data related to the seroepidemiology of HCV infection in Pakistan. For this article, data from 132 published studies and three unpublished data sets published/ presented between the period 1992-2008 were utilized. Data of 1,183,329 individuals were gathered. Blood donors (982,481) and the general population (178,322) constituted the majority of these subjects. The frequency of HCV infection in blood donors and in the general population was 3.0 % (95% CI: 3.0- 3.1) and 4.7 (95% CI: 4.6 -4.8), respectively. The frequency among 6,148 pregnant females was 7.3% (95% CI = 6.7 – 8.0). The frequency in healthy children ranged from 0.4 to 4.1% (95% CI = 1.4 – 2.3). Pakistani HCV serofrequency figures are significantly higher (P < 0.0001) compared to those of the corresponding populations in surrounding countries like India, Nepal, Myanmar, Iran and Afghanistan.\n\nKeywords: Hepatitis C Virus, Anti-HCV, Pakistan, Serofrequency\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has compared hepatitis C to a \"viral time bomb\" and estimates that about 180 million people (some 3% of the world's population) are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), 130 million of whom are chronic carriers at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. Three to four million persons are newly infected each year, 70% of whom will develop chronic hepatitis. HCV is responsible for 50-76% of all liver cancer cases, and two thirds of all liver transplants in the developed world [1]. World Health Statistics 2008 lists cirrhosis of the liver as the 18th commonest cause of mortality in the world, and it is estimated that by 2030, liver cancer will become the 13th commonest cause [2].\n\nThe prevalence of hepatitis varies from country to country, and at times it will also vary among different regions of the same country. The epidemiological estimates by WHO show that the prevalence of hepatitis C is low (< 1%) in Australia, Canada and northern Europe, and about 1% in countries of medium endemicity, such as the USA and most of Europe. It is high (>2%) in many countries of Africa, Latin America, Central and South-East Asia. In these countries, prevalence figures between 5% and 10% are frequently reported [1].\n\nCollecting and comparing health data from across a country is a way to describe health problems, identify trends and help decision-makers set priorities. The global epidemiology of hepatitis C is well established. However, its epidemiology in Pakistan is ill-defined. Most of the data have come from hospital-based studies, because there is a dearth of community-based ones [3][4][5]. Although the National Survey of Hepatitis has concluded, its results have not yet been officially published, except for a few presentations made by researchers at official meetings. This review summarizes the available data on the epidemiology of hepatitis C since the first report of its recognition in 1992.\n\nHCV-Related Pakistani Data\n\nAll available Pakistani data published or unpublished till the writing of this article were collected by a literature search through electronic databases like Pubmed, Pakmedinet, Yahoo and Google etc. Unpublished data from any source, if accessible, were also reviewed. Data from 132 published studies and 3 unpublished data sets were gathered and grouped in six categories, based on the type of population studied i.e. 1) general population, 2) blood donors, 3) patients with liver diseases, 4) patients with diseases other than hepatic diseases, 5) pregnant women and 6) children. Most of the data (78.5%) pertained to the years 2001-2008. Year by year distribution of this data is given in .\n\nTable 1\n\nYearNumberPercent2005 - 20084734.82001 - 20045943.71996 - 20002014.81995 and earlier.96.7Total 135100.0\n\nGeneral Population\n\nTwenty-five studies [6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30] pertained to the serofrequency of hepatitis C in the general population. Details are given in The majority of these studies (92%) were conducted during the period 2000-2008. Two studies were conducted in the nineties [6][7]. The data of 178,322 persons were included in this group. Unfortunately, there was no study from any major city of Balochistan, or from the NWFP provinces. The frequency of HCV infection ranged from 0.4% in Karachi [6] to 33.7% in Jarwar (Sindh) [28]. The mean frequency was 4.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6 - 4.8).\n\nTable 2\n\nAuthorYearPlaceNumberAnti HCV (%)ReferenceAgboatwala et al.1994Karachi2580.4[6]Luby1997Hafizabad3136.5[7]Aslam2001Lahore48816.0[8]Aslam2001Gujranwala1,92223.8[8]Ali et al.2002Rawalpindi5,3703.3[9]Khan2004Mardan7009.0[10]Khokhar2004Islamabad47,5385.3[11]Muhammad2005Buner16,4004.6[12]Farooq et al.2005Khuzdar6653.3[13]Hashim et al2005Attock4,5524.0[14]Ahmad2006Swat41,6132.2[15]Fayyaz et al.2006Bahawalpur2,0866.3[16]Tariq and Janjua2006Rawalpindi15,5503.7[17]Jafri et al.2006Karachi3,5331.6[18]Sherif and Tariq2006Rawalpindi2,5582.8[19]Zaman2006Bahawalpur6,8154.4[30]Ahmad et al.2007Faisalabad30016.0[20]Altaf et al.2007Hyderabad2,8355.2[21]Mirza et al.2007Bahawalpur18212.5[22]Malik et al.2008Pannu Aqil5,2374.8[23]Hakim et al.2007Karachi4,0005.2[24]Buttand Amin2008DI Khan5,7071.7[25]Khan et al.2008Azad Kashmir2453.3[26]Idrees et al.2008Lahore6,81714.6[27]Abbas et al.2008Jarwar (Sindh)87333.7[28]Alam et al.2008Mianwali6971.9[29]Total178,3224.7 (95% CI: 4.6 -4.8) 6.3)\n\nBlood Donors\n\nBlood donor data constituted the largest data set.

The serofrequency of HCV ranged from 0.3% in Multan [31] to 12.5% in Islamabad [32]. The mean frequency was 3.0% (95% CI: 3.0- 3.1). Only five studies [29][32][33][34][35] showed a frequency of > 5%.\n\nTable 3\n\nAuthor Year Place Number Anti HCV (%) Reference Kakepoto et al.1996Karachi16,7051.2[103]Bhatti et al.1996Rawalpindi7604.8[104]Lone et al.1999Lahore1864.3[105]Mujeeb2000Karachi6120.5[106]Tanwani and Ahmad2000Islamabad1,34512.5[32]DBTU2001 UPRawalpindi20,5005.0[99]PBTS2001 UPLahore120,0002.3[99]Adridi2001 UPPeshawar19,0004.0[99]Ryas et al.2001Rawalpindi1,8854.7[107]Ahmed et al.2001Karachi1,4104.4[108]Ahmad et al.2002Lahore5,7894.9[109]Khattak et al.2002Rawalpindi103,8584.0[110]Fayyaz et al.2002Bahawalpur3455.6[33]Mumtaz et al.2002Rawalpindi5536.2[34]Rahman et al.2002Lahore166,1834.4[111]Ali et al.2003Quetta16351.8[112]Akhtar et al.2004Karachi351,3091.8[113]Ahmad et al.2004Peshawar4,0002.2[114]Mahmood et al.2004Multan6,0000.3[31]Sirhindi2006Lahore18,2164.2[115]Aziz2006Skardu8501.1[116]Khan2006Bahawalpur27,9382.5[117]Ujjan et al.2006Hyderabad3,6776.7[35]Mujeeb et al.2006Karachi7,3253.6[118]Chaudhary2007Rawalpindi1,4282.5[119]Alam and Naeem2007Gilgit8.9491.3[120]Ishaq et al.2007Thatta3101.3[121]Bhatti et al.2007Karachi94,1774.2[122]Khattak et al.2008Peshawar1,1314.1[123]Mujeeb and Pearce2008Karachi5,3457.5[124]Total982,4813.03 (95% CI: 3.0- 3.1)\n\nPatients with Liver Diseases\n\nForty-one studies [36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66][67][68] dealing with the frequency of hepatitis C among patients with liver diseases were found, covering 7,765 patients over a period of 27 years from 1992 to 2008 ( , ).

The number of individuals included in these studies was 1,902. HCV serofrequency in these individuals ranged from 10.5-79.6%, with an overall prevalence of 44.9% (95% CI = 42.6 - 47.2). Eleven studies [39][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][69] covering 3,144 patients with chronic liver disease showed a range of 13.3% to 86.0% HCV serofrequency. The mean frequency was 52.9% (95% CI: 51.1-54.7).\n\nIn 10 studies [36][39][40][42][60][61][62][63][64][65] The HCV serofrequency in 739 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma was investigated ( ), and it ranged from 24% to 67.9%.

One thousand nine hundred and eighty patients with acute/chronic hepatitis from 6 studies had 58.2% (95% CI : 55.7- 60.4) HCV serofrequency [46][51][57][66][67][68].\n\nPatients with Diseases Other than Hepatic Diseases\n\nSixteen studies focused on HCV serofrequency in patients with various diseases other than liver diseases ( ) [10][70][71][72][73][74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85]. These studies spanned a period of 8 years, from 1999 to 2006, and covered major cities. The mean frequency of HCV infection in patients with various medical diseases was 20.4% (95% CI : 18.4-22.5), 38% in haematological diseases (95% CI : 33.6-42.5), 7.9% among surgical diseases (95% CI : 6.9 - 9.0), and 1.3% in dental diseases.\n\nTable 6\n\nAuthor Year Place Disease Number Anti HCV (%) Reference Medical DiseasesKhan2004MardanGeneral7009.0[10]Mumtaz andAftab2005RawalpindiGeneral26428.6[70]Gul and Iqbal2003LahoreRenal Failure5068.0[71]Khokar et al.2005IslamabadRenal Failure9723.7[72]Qazi et al.2004BahawalpurDiabetes 225027.6[73]Bilwani et al.2004KarachiLymphoprolifrative14329.2[89]Total 1504 20.4 (95% CI = 18.4-22.5) Haematological Diseases Moatter et al.1999Karachiβ -Thalassemia10035.0[106]Muhammad J2003Peshawar (Thalassemia)β -Thalassemia8036.2[126]Younus et al.2004Islamabadβ -Thalassemia7542.0[94]Burki et al.2005Islamabadβ -Thalassemia18041.7[74]Hussain2001PeshawarHaemophillia4025.0[14]Total 475 38 (95% CI = 33.6-42.5) Psychological Diseases Shah and Dar2004IslamabadDepression13522.9[80]Surgical DiseasesHussain and Fatima2005KarachiSurgical Diseases75016.2[81]Talpur et al.2006NawabshahSurgical Diseases18011.9[82]Khan et al.2007AbbottabadOrthopaedic Diseases16303.1[83]Daudpota and Soomro2008JacobabadSurgical Diseases15014.0[84]Total 2710 7.9 (95% CI = 6.9-9.0) Dental Diseases Khitab et al.2005PeshawarDental Diseases Diseases1,4981.3[85]\n\nPregnant Women\n\nEleven studies [86][87][88][89][90][91][92][93][94][95][96] dealing with the serofrequency of HCV among pregnant women were found ( ).

One study from Lahore in 1996 reported a 4.1% perinatal transmission of HCV in children of HCV- positive mothers. The serofrequency of HCV in thalassemics, and hemophiliacs was 35-42% [75][76][77][78] and 25% [79], respectively.\n\nTable 8\n\nAuthorYearPlaceNumberAnti HCV (%)ReferenceJafri et al.2006Karachi3,5331.6[18]Akram1995Karachi2300.40[97]Khan1996Lahore5384.09[86]Hyder2001Lahore1710.58[98]Total 4472 1.8 (95% CI = 1.4 - 2.3)\n\nDiscussion\n\nMany researchers have tried to derive a national or regional figure for HCV serofrequency based on the available data [99][100][101]. In 2005, Umar M and Khaar HTB [99], from Rawalpindi, collected data from various studies and reported a 9.8% frequency in 79,192 individuals. In 2006, Hafeez [99], from Islamabad, collected data from 98 studies and produced an estimate of 5.3%. Raja and Janjua [101], from Essex (UK), analyzed studies available on Medline from 1970 to 2005, and observed that the prevalence of HCV infection ranges from 0.4% in children, to 1.2% in healthy blood donors. Ali et al. reviewed data from 139 studies from 1994 to 2007 and concluded that the weighted average for hepatitis C antibody positivity was 3.0% (range 0.3-31.9%). Rates in the high-risk subgroups were far higher [100].\n\nThe data analyzed in this article shows HCV positivity (95% CI: 4.6 - 4.8) among 178,322 healthy individuals and 3.03% positivity (95% CI: 3.00 - 3.06) among 982,481 healthy blood donors. This figure is significantly lower (P < 0.0001) than the figure of 9.8% quoted by Umar M and Khaar HTB [99]. However, our estimates are significantly higher (P < 0.00001) than the 3% figure quoted by Ali et al. [100] for healthy individuals. Our estimates are closer to the figure of 5.3% given by Hafeez [99]. According to several studies, HCV genotype 3 is the most frequent genotype found in Pakistan ( ).\n\nTable 9\n\nAuthorYearPlaceNumber (Typable)Genotype (%)Reference123456MixedAzhar2003Bahawalpur1056.04.869.62.4-0.8-[122]Ansari2002Karachi25512.02.377.62.30.42.72.3[127]Khokhar2002Islamabad148--64.1----[125]Zuberi2002Karachi2158.4-79.5---8.8[88]Nasir2001Rawalpindi395.12.659.95.212.815.4-[128]Mumtaz2005Karachi7257.91.287.85.0-0.8-[129]Total7257.71.680.53.10.91.31.7\n\nMost of the available Pakistani data on HCV pertains to blood donors, probably because for reasons of convenience and access to a large sample size, and may not truly represent the general population [100]. If high-risk blood donors are screened out (those with jaundice, injection drug users etc), the frequency in the general population may be underestimated. If professional blood donors (who are often injection-drug users who sell their blood to make money) are included, the figures may be overestimated.\n\nThe number of subjects studied, other than healthy blood donors, appears very small, and also there is a lack of representation from across the country [101]. The frequency of HCV positivity in Pakistan is significantly higher (P < 0.0001) when compared to the corresponding populations in the surrounding countries ( ).\n\nTable 10\n\nCountryYearPopulationNumberPrevalence (%)ReferenceMyanmar2006Healthy Adults3622.5[130]India2003Blood Donors28,9560.66[126]Nepal2004Healthy Adults1031.0[131]Iran2006Healthy Adults17211.0[132]Afghanistan2006Healthy Women44520.31[133]Pakistan2009Healthy Adults178,3224.7This review\n\nWe noted a highly variable serofrequency in different studies of similar populations, even within the same province. One of the reasons for such variability in the results has been explained by Ali et al. [100]. The authors observed that unlike highly contagious diseases like measles that have a more predictable seroprevalence, blood-borne illnesses like hepatitis and HIV are transmitted sporadically or in microepidemics. According to them these microepidemics may account for wide variations in prevalence within a nation, a province, or even a community, and methodological differences in sampling strategies may also contribute to differences in seroprevalence within similar regions or populations [100].\n\nAccording to the \"Burden of Disease Study\" carried out by Hyder and Morrow in 2001, chronic liver diseases are the 5th commonest cause of premature mortality in Pakistan and the 11th commonest cause of disabilities [102]. Although between 75-85% of infections move on to chronic hepatitis C, the progress may be slow. Hence most people who are infected do not experience symptoms and are unaware of their infection. They are not able to benefit from available treatment that may clear them of the virus. They may also unknowingly spread the virus to others. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent HCV infection. Effective but costly treatment is available. The high frequency and its contribution to premature mortality and disability call for massive awareness campaigns to combat the menace of this infectious disease.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe frequency of hepatitis C infection in Pakistan is high (4.7%), varying from 0.4% - 33.7%, indicating pockets of infections. The frequency is significantly higher than in surrounding countries. The contribution of this high frequency to premature mortality and disability calls for massive awareness campaigns.\n\nReferences\n\n1. World Health Organization. Hepatitis C.
