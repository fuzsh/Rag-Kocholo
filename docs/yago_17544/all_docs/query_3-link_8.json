        "text": "Islamabad is the capital of Pakistan, a country in southern Asia. Meadows, low mountains, and hilly plains surround the city. Its name means “City of Islam” or “City of Peace.”\n\nIslamabad is a carefully planned city. It was built during the 1960s to be the new capital of Pakistan. Some of the buildings in Islamabad were designed using traditional Islamic styles. The city has wide, straight streets and many gardens and parks. The University of Islamabad and the Open University are located in Islamabad.\n\nThe city became the capital in 1969. Pakistan and India fought a war in 1971. The war slowed the city’s development for a time. Population (2010 estimate), urban area, 856,000; (2009 estimate) Federal Capital Area, 1,049,000."
