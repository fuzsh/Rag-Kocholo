We are excited to launch Founders Live Islamabad!

Join us for an incredible morning…

Five awesome Islamabad startups pitch. YOU pick the winner!

Founders Live is an unforgettable happy hour competition sweeping the globe where five handpicked companies take the hot seat, with only 99 seconds to pitch their company and describe their value proposition in front of an eager audience.

After the pitches and audience Q&A, the crowd votes on the winner who receives our winner’s package and the opportunity to talk more about their product or service.

So bring your friends and coworkers, grab some food and drink, get to know your local entrepreneurs and vote for what you think will be the next big thing... built in Pakistan.
