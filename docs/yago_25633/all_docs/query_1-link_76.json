        "text": "MANY in the French film industry think Gerard Depardieu is God, but only Jean-Luc Godard has dared to take the idea literally. In \"Helas Pour Moi\" (\"Woe Is Me\"), the actor plays an ordinary man named Simon whose body is briefly inhabited by God, or so it seems when God's gravelly voice comes out of Simon's mouth, speaking \"thine\" and \"thou,\" to the astonishment of his wife.\n\nNo road company of \"The Odd Couple\" could have come up with a less likely pair than these two men. The cerebral and often inaccessible Mr. Godard, a master of the French New Wave of the 1960's, has been under a critical and commercial cloud for two decades. Mr. Depardieu is so popular and lucrative a property that a recent story in Variety practically suggested that the French film business might collapse without him. But in \"Helas Pour Moi,\" they inspire each other's best tendencies. Beautifully photographed beside a Swiss lake, the film has a poetry and emotion rarely associated with Mr. Godard. Mr. Depardieu's performance is surprisingly restrained and resonant.\n\nThe tirades about French film that erupted during the recent GATT talks have mercifully faded away. (To refresh your memory, both sides sounded like little boys squaring off in the playground: \"No fair! You're trying to kill us!\" the French screamed at Hollywood. \"Are not! And your movies stink anyway!\" Hollywood yelled back.) \"Helas Pour Moi\" hints that reports of French film's demise were wildly exaggerated. And there is plenty more evidence in a provocative, exciting series hiding behind a drab, uninviting title: \"Cahiers du Cinema Selects Recent French Films.\"\n\nThe series of a dozen films, most made within the last year and being shown in this country for the first time, begins today at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center and runs through March 1. It is the third annual installment of the program, chosen by the Film Society of Lincoln Center along with editors of the French journal Cahiers du Cinema.\n\nEven in France, Cahiers has far less influence than it did 30 years ago, when its best critics turned to film making and created the personal, fluent style of the New Wave. But the journal still champions films that reveal a director's distinctive vision and signature.\n\nThough this year's series includes several names from the Cahiers pantheon, the program is not bathed in nostalgia. Eric Rohmer's \"Tale of Winter,\" Claude Chabrol's documentary \"The Eye of Vichy\" and the Godard film present those directors in top form. And a documentary by Serge Toubiana and Michel Pascal, \"Francois Truffaut: Stolen Portraits,\" is a surprising view of the much-loved director as his family and colleagues saw him.
