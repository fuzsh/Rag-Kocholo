        "text": "During his lifetime, Auguste Rodin’s name became synonymous with modern sculpture. It also became linked with sex. “Desire! What a formidable stimulant,” he once remarked. Rodin came to emphasize the importance of desire and the sexual as the markers of his individual perspective, using them to fuel his increasingly daring treatments of the nude. Bodily passion became the primary means through which he sought to make sculpture evocative, expressive, and universally appealing. Concurrently, Rodin staged his own acts of making through the manipulation of sculptural techniques, prompting viewers to imagine his objects’ scenes of creation in his studio. In the minds of many viewers, the dramatic and activated surfaces of his sculptures came to be seen as evidence of not just a sculptor’s touch but a lover’s touch as well. David Getsy examines these developments by focusing on two pivotal moments in Rodin’s career: first, 1876, the year his work is catalyzed through an engagement with Michelangelo and, second, 1900, the year of the one-person exhibition that catapulted him to international public notoriety. This book makes a case for reconsidering the terms of Rodin’s influence, arguing that the sculptor placed renewed emphasis on the materiality and objecthood of sculpture as a means of asserting his own desire’s inseparability from his works. In his analysis of this practice, Getsy offers a critical account of the origins of modern sculpture and how sex became a key term in Rodin’s making of it. http://www.amazon.com/Rodin-Sex-Making-Modern-Sculpture/dp/0300167253/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1297084709&sr=8-1\n\nThis paper situates one of Aristide Maillol’s earliest modernist sculptures in its uniquely aesthetic and sociopolitical context. Made in 1905 Torso of the Monument to Blanqui ([En] Chained Action), a copy of which sits on the landing of the main staircase of The Art Institute of Chicago with the abbreviated title Enchained Action, was the result of a commission to make a memorial to a French socialist revolutionary by an avant-garde sculptor who came out of a generation that believed themselves to be the torchbearers of a new art. This paper is the introduction to a photographic essay (located elsewhere) called “Encountering Maillol” of Enchained Action in The Art Institute of Chicago photographed by the author between 2013 and 2016.\n\nUsing a series of Rodin's drawings after Michelangelo's Medici Chapel as a springboard, this chapter discusses Rodin's identification with Michelangelo in light of the Florentine sculptor's shifting reputation in the 1870s. I argue that queer identification (and disavowal) was instrumental to Rodin’s development of his artistic persona, with its emphasis on the nude body and sexual desire as his primary signs of artistic subjectivity and expressivity. The example of Michelangelo was catalytic, but Rodin turned away from the Renaissance artist's potential homoeroticism to reassert, defensively, an account of the dimorphism of the sexed body and of a heteronormative relationship to it."
