        "text": "French film director\n\nJacques Doillon (French: [dwajɔ̃]; born 15 March 1944) is a French film director and screenwriter. Some actresses to break through are Fanny Bastien, Sandrine Bonnaire, Judith Godrèche, Marianne Denicourt, Charlotte Gainsbourg[1] and Juliette Binoche.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nDoillon was born in Paris and attended the Lycée Voltaire.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nHis 1989 film The 15 Year Old Girl was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival.[3]\n\nHis 1990 film La vengeance d'une femme was entered into the 40th Berlin International Film Festival.[4] The following year, his film Le Petit Criminel won an Honourable Mention at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival.[5] In 1993, his film Le Jeune Werther won the Blue Angel Award at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival.[6] In 1998, his film Trop (peu) d'amour was entered into the 48th Berlin International Film Festival.[7]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHe has two daughters: Lola Doillon (born 1975), whose mother is film editor Noëlle Boisson, and Lou Doillon (born 1982), from his relationship with English actress Jane Birkin in the 1980s.[8] He has three other children named Lili, Lina, and Lazare.\n\nSexual abuse allegations\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2024, Judith Godrèche filed a criminal complaint which accused Doillon of rape during the filming of The 15 Year Old Girl when she was 15.[9][10][11] As a result of the accusation, the Tours film festival cancelled its invitation to Doillon to chair its 2024 jury.[12] Shortly thereafter, actresses Isild Le Besco and Anna Mouglalis joined Godrèche in accusing Doillon of sexual abuse.[13] Le Besco has claimed Doillon made advances during work sessions and tried to sexually blackmail her in 2000 when he was making an effort to star in his film Carrément à l'Ouest, while Mouglalis alleged that he forcefully kissed her in the summer of 2011 when her then-partner Samuel Benchetrit was appearing Doillon's film Un enfant de toi.[13][14] His upcoming film CE2 was postponed as the lead actors refused to promote the film.[15][13]\n\nOn July 1, 2024, Doillon, as well as Benoit Jacquot, were both questioned by police over Godrèche's rape allegation.[16] The two directors were also taken into custody by the Juvenile Protection Brigade.[16] On July 2, Doillon was released without charge after spending forty eight hour (two days) in the jail of a Paris police station.[14][17][18] It was stated that Doillon had been released from prison for medical reasons.[18][19]\n\nShortly after his release, it was revealed that since February 2024, three additional criminal complaints had been filed against Doillon.[18] The three women who filed these complaints were identified as Joe Rohanne, Hélène M. and Aurélie Le Roc'h.[18] Rohanne, who filed her criminal complaint in February 2024, alleged three acts of rape, assault and battery, and psychological violence which she alleged were committed against her by Dollion during their romantic relationship.[18] Rohanne's relationship with Doillon lasted between 2009 and 2012 and resulted in them conceiving a daughter who Rohanne claimed she got pregnant with during an occasion where Doillon raped her when she was taking sleeping pills.[17][18] Hélène M., who alleged she first met Dollion when she was 15 years old, claimed Dollion \"sodomized\" her for the first time when she was 16 years old.[18] Hélène M., who filed her criminal complaint in March 2024, alleged that the experience was \"painful and unpleasant.\"[18] In her complaint, Le Roc'h, a French actress, alleged that Doillon committed \"attempted rape\" when she working on his film Petits Frères in 1998.[18] According to La'Roch, Doillon tried to force her into having a sexual relationship with him.[18] These three complaints had served as the basis for his forty-eight hour stay in police custody.[17][18]\n\nDespite no charges being brought at the time of his release, and Rohanne's case being outside the statute of limitation, the criminal investigation against Doillon would continue, with the Paris prosecutor's office reserving the right to \"assess the scope and terms of the follow-up\" to the criminal complaints made against him.[18][17]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFeature films\n\n[edit]\n\nYear English title Original title Notes 1973 The Year 01 L'An 01 Co-directed by Alain Resnais and Jean Rouch\n\nWritten by Gébé 1974 Touched in the Head Les Doigts dans la tête 1975 A Bag of Marbles Un sac de billes 1979 The Hussy La Drôlesse 1979 The Crying Woman La Femme qui pleure 1981 The Prodigal Daughter [fr] La Fille prodigue 1984 The Pirate La Pirate 1985 The Temptation of Isabelle La Tentation d'Isabelle 1985 Family Life La Vie de famille 1986 The Prude La Puritaine 1987 Comedy!
