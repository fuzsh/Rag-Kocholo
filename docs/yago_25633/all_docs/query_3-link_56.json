        "text": "On ABRIL: articles—\n\nMarinero, F., and V. Ciompi, \"Victoria Por Si Misma,\" in Casablanca (Madrid), February 1984.\n\n\"Victoria Abril, Varier Les Roles de Composition,\" in Revue du Cinéma (Paris), June 1984.\n\n\"El Cine Como Pasion,\" in Semana Internacional de Cine Valladolid (Valladolid), 1991.\n\nMillea, Holly, \"Victor, Victoria,\" in Premiere (New York), May, 1994.\n\n* * *\n\nFor those who only know Victoria Abril from her stunning Almodóvar troika, it may come as a shock that the classically trained dancer has been a working cinema actress since the age of 15. Unsurprisingly, given her background, her physicality and wanton body language are essential components of all her roles. She moves like a panther prowling to a flamenco beat. Burning up the international cinema with a sensuality that is not the by-product of cosmetic enhancement or Hollywood glamour, Abril possesses an animal magnetism that will deepen with the years like the appeal of Moreau, Magnani, or Ava Gardner. Abril attacks her parts with the same natural abandon with which she often sheds her clothes on screen; it is as if she wants no barrier between the reality of her characterization and the audience. You do not just watch an Abril performance, you experience it through your pores.\n\nWhen you consider her wide range of roles, you realize that her sexuality is a gift of personality, a force of nature that she savvily uses to communicate as an actress. From her first English-language film appearance as the woodsy diversion for the King of England in Robin and Marian , she has made love to the camera as well as to her on-screen partners. From the mid-seventies, Spanish directors clamored for her services until she became that nation's top box-office attraction long before Almodóvar tied her up or down. In Cambio de Sexo , she portrayed a transsexual with a virtuosity well beyond the capabilities associated with a 16-year-old actress. In Mater Amatisima , she heartbreakingly enacted the mother of an eight-year-old autistic child despite being only 20 at the time. Despite her ebullient persona, her eyes suggest a familiarity with pain that has enabled her to tackle mature roles from her teenhood. During her ascent to superstardom espagnole, she played a free spirit inadvertently entangled in an incestuous affair in The Girl with the Golden Panties , subtly shaded three different whore roles in If They Tell You That I Fell , and limned another prostitute part with uncommon power in On the Line . Moving to France with her lover, cinematographer Gerard de Battista (with whom she has two sons), she spent her Abril in Paris years escaping the scathing reviews meted out for The Moon in the Gutter and impressing American audiences as one of the few causes for celebration in the star-deficient nineties. In the orgasmic film noir, Lovers: A True Story , she unleashed the sexual licentiousness that Hollywood femmes fatales of yesteryear could only intimate. Although the controversial Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! played like an awkward blind date between director Almodóvar and his game-for-anything star, High Heels , their next collaboration, showcased Abril's unique blend of reckless vulnerability and murderously intense passion to dazzling effect. In this combination salute to Lana Turner's real-life excesses and acidic parody of women's films, Abril sent up all those resentful daughters of Melodrama who are content to pillory their mothers for their own frustrations. Following up her delicious roast of a television reality-show hostess who would sell her own soul (if she had one) for a scoop in Kika , Abril played sexy second banana to Joe Pesci in Barry Levinson's unwieldy show biz satire Jimmy Hollywood . Lighting up a gimmicky script with refreshing candor, she stole the film."
