        "text": "Machiavellian women were not invented yesterday. In the history of art, they have existed for as long as we can remember if we dare to revisit the plays of ancient Greece. Examples include Medea, enchantress and the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis, dreamed up by Euripides, or the monstrous Medusa, whose mere gaze petrifies anyone who dares defy her. Is it her monstrosity or her beauty that chills the blood of men who cross her gaze? Probably a bit of both, as the female body has always been associated with the idea of temptation for the male gaze. Thus, a close and ineffable link has been forged between the notions of beauty and sexuality and the fall of men. Take Eve, the first woman in humanity. Was she not the one who led Adam to his downfall? Is she not the first femme fatale in history? In the context of an exhibition titled \"Dangerous Beauty: Medusa in Classical Art\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2018, Kiki Karoglou, formerly a curator in the Greco-Roman department, stated, “in a male-centered society like ancient Athens, the feminization of monsters comes hand in hand with the demonization of women. It's an issue of control of female sexuality and power.”\n\nThis process has persisted through the arts and eras, extending to cinema. From the vampires of the 1910s to the archetype of the femme fatale, and the \"final girl\" in the horror genre: dangerous women have always been perceived through the male gaze and seen as threats to men's own power conferred by patriarchal society. While more and more female directors manage to tell their stories, the audience gains access to new types of female characters. The binary separation between damsels in distress and heroines with perfect bodies is outdated. Today, cinema offers an astonishing array of complex, dark, and often morally ambiguous female characters. Sometimes, they are even true geniuses of evil who are capable of abusing their power abundantly. This phenomenon was highlighted this year by films such as Tár, Anatomy of a Fall, or Last Summer by Catherine Breillat. Could 2023 be the triumph of monstrous women in cinema?\n\nThe femme fatale: an archetype constructed by the male gaze\n\nA few decades before the birth of cinema, the 19th century witnessed the rise of new phenomena. Firstly, there was a surprising increase in crimes committed by women, particularly murders - a perplexing phenomenon in Western society where female violence is considered unnatural, unlike male violence, which is expected—although punishable by law. In the 1840s, the press made a point of reporting on these so-called feminine bursts of violence, deemed as monstrous. Historians Frédéric Chauvaud and Gilles Malandain describe the condemned women as \"impossible guilty\" (in the book Impossibles victimes, impossibles coupables. Les femmes devant la justice (XIXe-XXe siècles), published in 2009 by Presses universitaires de Rennes), as it was difficult to have their crimes recognized as non-pathological or non-exceptional - providing proof of their subordinate position in society.\n\nAnother phenomenon parallel to this increase in female violence is the progress of feminist ideas, championed by figures such as Frenchwomen Louise Michel, Hubertine Auclert, and the German Clara Zetkin, to name a few. This first wave of activism was not without its reactionary counteroffensive, motivated by male anxiety, fearful of these new demands. Thus, cinema, emerging at the dawn of the 20th century, became one of the many means to counteract these new discourses. First with the vamp figure in the 1910s, an archetype tinged with a hint of orientalism, but especially with the femme fatale, emerging in the 1940s and 1950s in the film noir movement.\n\nA venal seductress who brings harm to men who desire her, the femme fatale is a character born in post-war America when the female population had just gained new freedoms, as men went to the front. Then, as the men returned home, women needed to be reminded of their place and were encouraged to resume their roles as mistresses of the domestic sphere. Thus, the femme fatale, as free as she may be, is often condemned to a fateful destiny. Her sexual power often causes her downfall. Yet, a certain part of the film noir audience, especially women, sees in these characters, embodied by actresses like Lauren Bacall or Rita Hayworth, glimpses of hope towards emancipation.\n\nThe triumph of dark and complex women on screen\n\nThe heirs of the femme fatale are numerous in contemporary cinema. Whether born from male or female writers, the motivations behind their crimes and the sources of their power vary. Through the lens of Quentin Tarantino, Uma Thurman plays a vengeance-seeking bride skilled in martial arts in Kill Bill. However, even though Harvey Weinstein distributed the film, the actress lived a hellish experience on set, harassed and assaulted by the famous producer. Thus, in the early 2000s, actresses had to protect themselves on sets where they portrayed characters seeking revenge against the men who had harmed them. If the situation was not as serious as it is, it would be almost cynical.\n\nMoreover, under the male gaze, female characters judged as violent are constantly reduced to their bodies, being objectified in front of the camera. This is evident in many horror films of the 1970s, where the only women who survive are those who retain their virginity until the end of the film (like Jamie Lee Curtis in the Halloween saga). Another example is Carrie (1976), Brian de Palma's adaptation of a Stephen King novel, where the young girl's first menstruation heralds her transformation into a monster with supernatural powers. It serves as a reminder of men's fear of the unknown, represented by the female body. However, as the years pass, more and more female directors manage to secure funding for their stories, in which the characters' psychology matters more than their bodies. The year of 2023 is particularly eloquent, Lydia Tár, portrayed by Cate Blanchett, personifies the fall of a despot in the classical music scene. Sandra, in Anatomy of a Fall, embodies everything that patriarchal society rejects; a bisexual woman surrounded by glory, whose success overshadows her husband's ambitions. As for her guilt in his murder, director Justine Triet does not take sides and prefers to leave doubt lingering. To a lesser extent, the main character in Showing Up, played by Michelle Williams, is a grumpy sculptor, annoyed by the world around her.\n\nIt is no longer in doubt that interesting roles for women on screen have been increasing lately. Featuring women who are both complex and profoundly intelligent, sometimes with scandalous morals. Like the plays of ancient Greece, they serve a cathartic function, purging female viewers of their sins. Like creating a space to express an anger that has persisted for a long time. In some respects, this anger portrayed on screen can carry inherently political claims, such as the explosion of rage from multiple women after years of unpunished abuse.\n\nFeminine rage, an eminently political theme on the big screen\n\nOne image has marked recent cinematic years, Florence Pugh in the film Midsommar, in the arms of several women. Entwined, kneeling on the ground, they scream in unison, like the embodiment of ancestral female rage finally released. The phenomenon has been discussed by British researchers Shani Orgad and Rosalind Gill in an article titled \"Safety valves for mediated female rage in the #Metoo era\": \"More and more women are getting publicly and unapologetically angry, particularly in relation to sexual violence, but also in reaction to other forms of sexism, racism and injustice\" they wrote.\n\nAnger is traditionally considered an unfeminine emotion. Angry women have always been deemed unattractive or even unfeminine. This process goes beyond cinema: take young Greta Thunberg, whose political anger has often been scorned or ridiculed by a male-dominated political faction. Yet, the anger of women, like that of Uma Thurman mentioned earlier, is at least understandable. For several years now, it has surged onto our screens, as seen in films like A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014), the debut feature film by Iranian-American director Ana Lily Amirpour. It narrates the story of a bloodthirsty woman in the streets of a fictional city named \"Bad City.\" Pursued by men, the main character, played by Sheila Vand, subverts traditional power dynamics when they realize they are not the predators they thought they were, but rather the prey.\n\nRead More\n\n5 must-see Greta Gerwig movies\n\nDid you love Barbie? Or were you disappointed? Here are 5 films by actress, screenwriter and director Greta Gerwig to discover her sensitive, nuanced cinema.\n\nMore recently, the horror film Pearl, co-written by Ti West and Mia Goth, illustrates another type of female emancipation through violence. In 1918, Mia Goth's character seeks to escape her stifling existence, willing to do anything to fulfill her ambitions. Thus, female violence on screen is presented as a means to dispel the persistent notion of female fragility. In an interview with Vogue, English author and actress Phoebe Waller-Bridge, known for her series Fleabag, stated: \"It feels like, recently, a lot of female anger has been unleashed. Articulated anger. Which is exciting for me because I’ve always found female rage very appealing.\" This sentiment is shared by Dutch director Halina Reijn, creator of the horror comedy Bodies, Bodies, Bodies, whose next film will feature Nicole Kidman as an icy CEO engaging in an adulterous affair with her intern: \"I'm very interested in creating female roles that are more dark,\" she explained in an interview with BBC Culture. \"I don't feel any urge to create innocent or strong women. I just feel an urge to create someone like Richard III: really great female roles that are juicy and strange, about our weaknesses and most hated fantasies.\" Thus, beyond these female characters seeking emancipation, recent cinematic productions offer numerous different and versatile femininities, from the mundane to the toxic."
