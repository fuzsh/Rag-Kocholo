Adra gently gifts us a sense of home, of community and belonging, and how the mountains of Cymru have conjured up the spirit of ‘hiraeth.’\n\nLlanberis and its surroundings have shaped the lives of many, with a climbing culture as historic and iconic as Chamonix or Yosemite grown from its mountains, quarries and sea cliffs that harbour some of the best traditional rock climbing in the world.\n\nPresented by Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team and Pertex, with all profits going to Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team.

As dangerous invaders appear on the horizon, it becomes clear they must join forces to save their fragile island paradise.\n\nThis gripping hand-drawn animated tale with its message of working together to protect nature, has never felt more relevant. Written by Frank Cottrell-Boyce from Michael Morpurgo’s beloved 1999 novel, Kensuke’s Kingdom features an impeccable voice cast including Sally Hawkins, Cillian Murphy and Ken Watanabe.\n\nA groundbreaking feature-length documentary by Shepherds of Wildlife, exploring the complex and nuanced debates surrounding rural land use in Scotland.\n\nOver the past two years, Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust (GWCT) Scotland has assisted US-based film maker Tom Opre (Killing The Shepherd), in the creation of this feature-length new documentary, ‘The Last Keeper’. The film’s narrative weaves together the stories of fragile wildlife and rural communities, highlighting the challenges they face as they navigate often-contentious land use decisions. The documentary brings together a diverse array of voices to ensure that all sides of the debate are fully represented, capturing the complexities of rural land use and management today.\n\nGWCT is proud to present this film, offering audiences an opportunity to engage with perspectives and stories that shape Scotland’s rural landscapes.\n\nTeenager Owen is just trying to make it through life in the suburbs when his classmate introduces him to a mysterious late-night TV show – a vision of a supernatural world beneath their own.
