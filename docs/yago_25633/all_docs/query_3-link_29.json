        "text": "Our look back at the 50 Years of the New York Film Festival has finally hit the 90s. In an era of global change—with the Cold War coming to an end and the Gulf War just beginning—one thing was consistent: 28 years in, the New York Film Festival was still showing some of the best cinema from around the world. The 1990 edition showcased films from the Coen Brothers, Abel Ferrara, Eric Rohmer, Jean-Luc Godard, and Aki Kaurismäki, among many other talented artists. It also brought a stand-out from Zhang Yimou, Ju Dou. See it Tuesday at 6:15!\n\nThe Chinese filmmaker may be best known in the States for his films Hero and House of Flying Daggers. He also directed the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Needless to say, he is an imaginative artist capable of incredible things. Of his six films to play at NYFF, we are proud to share Ju Dou with audiences once again. It is a passionate and gripping drama told with stunning colors and incredible performances. This controversial film was banned in its native China, but earned the nation its first Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nWhy not make a night of it? For just $25, you can grab , which includes delicious fare from Indie Food and Wine!
