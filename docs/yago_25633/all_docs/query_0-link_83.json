Some slightly regrettable omissions: Mike Leigh’s Another Year, for example, contains some of his very best work, but is also hampered in the earlier scenes by some slightly mannered acting and clumsy dialogue; I was also very tempted to include Pablo Trapero’s Carancho, Olivier Assayas’ Carlos, Risteard O’Domhnaill’s The Pipe and Natalia Smirnoff’s Rompecabezas, but for various reasons they didn’t make it into the final 20. The Coens’ True Grit would definitely be in there had it been released early enough, and it was probably the best new film I saw all year. As it is, if I had to choose just one title as my film of the year from the 20 listed below, it would probably have to be either Aurora or Nostalgia de la Luz.\n\nAita (Father, Jose Marie de Orbe, 2010)\n\nAlamar (To the Sea, Pedro González-Rubio, 2009)\n\nEl Ambulante (The Peddler, Eduardo de la Serra/Lucas Marcheggiano/Adriana Yurovich, 2009)\n\nAurora (Cristi Puiu, 2010)\n\nArchipelago (Joanna Hogg, 2010)\n\nCopie conforme (Certified Copy, Abbas Kiarostami, 2010)\n\nCopacabana (Marc Fitoussi, 2010)\n\nDes hommes et des dieux (Of Gods and Men, Xavier Beauvois, 2010)\n\nEn Ganske Snill Mann (A Somewhat Gentle Men, Hans Petter Moland, 2010)\n\nHaishang Chuanqi (I Wish I Knew, Jia Zhangke, 2010)\n\nUn Homme qui crie (A Screaming Man, Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, 2010)\n\nLourdes (Jessica Hausner, 2009)\n\nLoong Boonmee raluek chat (Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, 2010)\n\nLa Mosquitera (The Mosquito Net, Agusti Vila, 2010)\n\nNostalgia de la luz (Nostalgia for the Light, Patricio Guzman, 2010)\n\nSi (Poetry, Lee Changdong, 2010)\n\nLa princesse de Montpensier (The Princess of Montpensier, Bertrand Tavernier, 2010)\n\nLe quattro volte (Michelangelo Frammartino, 2010)\n\nRebecca H (Return to the Dogs) (Lodge Kerrigan, 2010)\n\nSchastye Moye (My Joy, Sergei Loznitsa, 2010)\n\nSEAN AXMAKER\n\nDVD columnist for MSN Entertainment, contributing writer for Turner Classic Movies Online and managing editor of Parallax View.\n\nTop Ten List\n\n1.

Winter’s Bone (Debra Granik, 2010)\n\n10. White Material (Claire Denis, 2009)\n\nAnd Best Unreleased film of 2007 finally getting an American release in 2010 (but still feels like a film from another era): Milyang (Secret Sunshine, Chang-dong Lee).\n\nThis list was made without having seen some major films on the international film festival circuit, namely L’illusionniste (The Illusionist, Sylvain Chomet, 2010), Another Year (Mike Leigh, 2010), O Estranho Caso de Angelica (The Strange Case of Angelica, Manoel de Oliveira, 2010) and Kynodontas (Dogtooth, Giorgos Lanthimos, 2009). And it leaves off some of the most interesting, artful and ambitious films of the year that, on other days, might make the list (and, in fact, some of them appeared in other incarnations of the list): Sweetgrass (Lucien Castaing-Taylor, Ilisa Barbash, 2009), Les herbes folles (Wild Grass, Alain Resnais, 2009), Black Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010), Aquele querido mês de Agosto (Our Beloved Month of August, Miguel Gomes, 2008), Inception (Christopher Nolan, 2010), Singularidades de uma Rapariga Loura (Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl, Manoel de Oliveira, 2009), Alamar (To the Sea, Pedro González-Rubio, 2009), Somewhere (Sofia Coppola, 2010).\n\nI made a few Top Ten lists where only American releases were eligible. For this list, I was able to include two of my three most transcendent cinematic experiences of the year missing from those American lists: Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s mysterious Uncle Boonmee which is at once haunting and comforting and utterly entrancing, and Mysteries of Lisbon, which may turn out to be the masterpiece of Raul Ruiz’s career. I saw both films only once, both in a film festival setting, and within moments of leaving the theatre I wanted nothing more than to see them again. But that will have to wait. Uncle Boonmee, at least, has a distributor and, if nothing else, will emerge on DVD in 2011. Mysteries of Lisbon has no American distributor as of this writing, but then it may re-emerge in a different form: Ruiz is preparing a longer TV version, and the thought of even more threads woven through the magnificent tapestry is exciting news indeed. Carlos, like these films, is a magnificent meeting of subject and storytelling, but where Weerasethakul and Ruiz cast a spell of stillness and grace around their characters, Olivier Assayas creates a riveting style that appears artless, a film of pure momentum with a camera plucking out characters and details as the events rush by, but is magnificently organised and perfectly composed, capturing the ironies and at times the absurdities of Carlos and his transformation from political activist to celebrity terrorist without stopping to make sure we “got it.”\n\nMARTYN BAMBER\n\nHead of Subtitling at the European Captioning Institute in London, and a freelance writer.\n\nFavourite new releases from 2010 seen in the UK (in alphabetical order):\n\nThe American (Anton Corbijn, 2010)\n\nBlack Death (Christopher Smith, 2010)\n\nChico and Rita (Javier Mariscal and Fernando Trueba, 2010)\n\nChloe (Atom Egoyan, 2009)\n\nThe Hole in 3D (Joe Dante, 2009)\n\nInception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)\n\nThe Kids Are All Right (Lisa Cholodenko, 2010)\n\nPlease Give (Nicole Holofcener, 2010)\n\nUn prophète (A Prophet, Jacques Audiard, 2009)\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World (Edgar Wright, 2010)\n\nShutter Island (Martin Scorsese, 2010)\n\nThe Social Network (David Fincher, 2010)\n\nTakeshis’ (Kitano Takeshi, 2005)\n\nTamara Drewe (Stephen Frears, 2010)\n\nTetro (Francis Ford Coppola, 2009)\n\nMICHAEL BARTLETT\n\nFreelance film writer based in London who contributes to BFI Screenonline and Moviemail.\n\nBest of 2010 (in alphabetical order)\n\nArchipelago (Joanna Hogg, 2010)\n\nCopie conforme (Certified Copy, Abbas Kiarostami, 2010)\n\nGake no ue no Ponyo (Ponyo, Miyazaki Hayao, 2008)\n\nThe Ghost Writer (Roman Polanski, 2010)\n\nHahaha (Hong Sang-soo, 2010) / Ok-hui-ui yeonghwa (Oki’s Movie, Hong Sang-soo, 2010) / “Lost in the Mountains” (Hong Sang-soo) segment of Visitors (a.k.a.

Io sono l’amore (I Am Love, Luca Guadagnino, 2009)\n\nGuadagnino’s domestic tragedy is at once familiar and endlessly refreshing. Working within the well-established framework of a large, monied European family, the director subsumes a barrage of influences (from Max Ophuls to Nicolas Roeg to Claude Chabrol, amongst others) into a vision that is, in the end, wholly and masterfully his.\n\n2. Un prophète (A Prophet, Jacques Audiard, 2009)\n\nA sweeping and fully realised prison saga, Un prophète is Audiard’s best film to date by some margin. Tahir Rahim’s Malik El Djebena has definite echoes of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta in Goodfellas [Martin Scorsese, 1990]), and, like Scorsese’s protagonist, is that rare character that seems to authentically evolve on screen.\n\n3. Somewhere (Sofia Coppola, 2010)\n\nCoppola draws from a cadre of European and Asian influences (think Claire Denis and Tsai Ming-liang) in crafting this intimate and enchanting riff on American alienation.\n\n4. True Grit (Joel & Ethan Coen, 2010)\n\nThe Coens’ reboot of True Grit (Henry Hathaway, 1969) is a wholly original experience, and all the hallmarks you expect are there – Roger Deakins’ immaculate vistas, a panoply of perfectly pitched characters, and, most noticeably, a veritable thesaurus full of funny, flowery talk.\n\n5. The Ghost Writer (Roman Polanski, 2010)\n\nPolanski’s latest is an unfussy, efficient, and effective mystery. Much like Brad Anderson and his similarly classicist Transsiberian (2008), Polanski draws from Alfred Hitchcock, Carol Reed, et al to create an eminently watchable yarn.\n\n6. Bellamy (Claude Chabrol, 2009)\n\nThe most consistently great director of the French New Wave delivers yet another dignified, engaging, and well-made movie with this, his last film. Set against the tacit backdrop of a procedural, the film is ultimately more a twilight-years examination of things left unsaid, and, as such, represents a fitting and graceful coda for one of cinema’s best filmographies.\n\n7. The American (Anton Corbijn, 2010)\n\nCorbijn’s film is a precise, deliberate, and labyrinthine thriller, recalling closely the classic European crime cinema of Jean-Pierre Melville and Julien Duvivier.\n\n8. The Kids Are All Right (Lisa Cholodenko, 2010)\n\nLisa Cholodenko’s latest film is, on its face, a solid but unremarkable film. That it, much like the director’s previous work, is a witty, approachable, sexy, and well-acted film for adults, however, might just be remarkable enough.\n\n9. Fish Tank (Andrea Arnold, 2009)\n\nWhile a bit overlong, Arnold’s grimy, sub-working class distillation of the Lolita trope is, ultimately, an engaging piece of cinema. Katie Jarvis’ Mia rings true as an outwardly defiant, inwardly naive youth and the ever-solid Michael Fassbender is at once disarming and unsettling as the lecherous Connor.\n\n10. White Material (Claire Denis, 2009)\n\nArguably the most commanding screen presence of her generation, Isabelle Huppert positively dominates Denis’ fractured tale of civil and cultural unrest in contemporary Africa.\n\nTHOMAS CALDWELL\n\nFreelance writer and broadcaster who specialises in film criticism and educational writing on film.\n\nTop ten films with a theatrical release in Melbourne, Australia in 2010\n\n1. Inception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)\n\nThis almost clinical and mechanical representation of the human subconscious facilitated an extraordinary exploration of cinematic space in order to deliver an intriguing heist story with wonderfully thrilling action sequences. This year’s masterpiece.\n\n2. Enter The Void (Gaspar Noé, 2009)\n\nThis mesmerising assault on the senses by the director of Irréversible was a strange, brilliant and audacious first-person head-trip into drugs, death, sex and the neon-lit metropolis of Tokyo.\n\n3. Shutter Island (Martin Scorsese, 2010)\n\nMartin Scorsese’s latest film was a typically brilliant example of subjective filmmaking, but where the point-of-view belongs to an unreliable protagonist. A sophisticated exercise in film style dressed up as a pulp thriller. So much more than a spot-the-twist film.\n\n4. Animal Kingdom (David Michôd, 2010)\n\nThe Australian film to receive the most hype this year was also the most deserving. The low-key filmmaking resulted in a tense, gritty and at times horrifying crime drama.\n\n5. Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010)\n\nThe combination of tight writing, powerful sentiment, humour and characters with so much heart delivered one of the greatest animated films ever made. Possibly the most perfect resolution to a trilogy too. Not a dry eye in the house.\n\n6. Blue Valentine (Derek Cianfrance, 2010)\n\nAn extraordinarily empathetic film about the everyday and commonplace tragedy that love doesn’t always prevail. Contains the year’s strongest performances from Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling.\n\n7. El secreto de sus ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes, Juan José Campanella, 2009)\n\nThe surprise winner of the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar this year, this Argentinean murder mystery/romance contains hidden depth. A thrilling and intriguing genre film in its own right but also a moving representation of Argentina’s history of political turmoil.\n\n8. The American (Anton Corbijn, 2010)\n\nTo reduce this to merely a generic hit man film ignores how immaculately crafted Corbijn’s second film is. The rich use of style of homage offers multiple rewards for a visually literate audience.\n\n9. The Killer Inside Me (Michael Winterbottom, 2010)\n\nAnother great example of subjective filmmaking where the film gets increasingly deranged as its psychopathic protagonist increasingly loses his grip on reality. A superb adaptation of Jim Thompson’s hardboiled novel featuring some incredibly upsetting acts of violence.\n\n10. Splice (Vincenzo Natali, 2009)\n\nIt wasn’t an old-school David Cronenberg film but the glorious blend of science-fiction, horror, melodrama and psycho-sexual thriller made it feel like one. Transgressive wicked fun.\n\nHonourable mentions\n\n11. The Road (John Hillcoat, 2009)\n\n12. Boy (Taika Waititi, 2010)\n\n13. The Social Network (David Fincher, 2010)\n\n14.

Copie conforme (Certified Copy, Abbas Kiarostami, 2010)\n\n4. The Ghost Writer (Roman Polanski, 2010)\n\n5. The Social Network (David Fincher, 2010)\n\n6. The Other Guys (Adam McKay, 2010)\n\nMcKay’s film manages to keep two realities activated at the same time: the world of Will Ferrell and Saturday Night Live, and a noir tale of cops on the beat. Although the former is more marketable, the film is just as invested in the latter story. The result is a slapstick comedy with an unusual, melancholy feel. McKay sustains this mood via the tension held in Mark Wahlberg’s face – it’s all in the nostrils – and the frequent bleak shots of the city.\n\nThe marvellous closing credit sequence, which explains the nature of a Ponzi scheme, is reminiscent of the one in The Ghost Writer. In both films, the final clue which cracks the master narrative is presented just as the film ends and the audience is tuning out. In The Ghost Writer, the letters in a manuscript flip to reveal a magic code-breaker, but all of this evidence is literally scattered to the winds. At the end of The Other Guys, McKay gives us the tools to dismantle the major financial conspiracy of our times, but in the shuffle to leave the theatre, no one is watching or listening.\n\n7. Blue Valentine (Derek Cianfrance, 2010)\n\n8. The Princess and the Frog (Ron Clements and John Musker, 2009)\n\nThis passionate film draws as fully on the cultural legacy of New Orleans as Spike Lee’s When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts (2006). Even in a glorious presentation of the city’s high life, or a scene set in the Louisiana swamps, the subtext is that this is a world which has already vanished. What we’re left with is images like a wondrous Mardi Gras sequence, composed almost entirely out of abstract shapes: space seems to expand as black, pink and purple lines dart all over the frame. Throughout, the animators show an absolute mania for jazz detailing in their depictions of nature, magic and daily life. The story of a 1920s black maid is matched with a visual style that meaningfully expresses a harsh economic reality as well as images of dreams and witchcraft. This is also one of the best scripts Disney has produced since the underrated The Emperor’s New Groove (Mark Dindal, 2000). The film is intriguingly ambivalent in its attitude to various character types – for instance, a thoughtless, likeable and casually prejudiced Southern belle.\n\n9.

Nostalgia de la luz (Nostalgia for the Light, Patricio Guzmán, 2010)\n\nBy some distance the greatest film of the year. A subtle, profound and wonderfully measured essay on the underlying philosophy of astronomy, the legacy of Chile’s murderous recent history, archaeology, time, memory, the vastness of space (both on earth and between the stars), and the cold gaze of the cosmos on human activity. One of the rare cases where a simple metaphor or symbol – the contrast between the vast passage of time registered by a radio-telescope and the endless archaeological dig in the vast desert to recover the scattered remains of Chile’s “disappeared” (one looking out, away and far back in time, the other sifting through the human detritus of the Pinochet regime littered across the country) – actually works and provides a profound study of the relativity of time, place, space and experience. Beautifully shot on 35mm, it is a devastating, Markeresque portrait of history as an act of forgetting and the actions of a few people (including Guzmán) to maintain vigilance against the easy amnesia of the relentless forward momentum of the present moment.\n\n2.

This was my first year attending the festival itself and I was excited to see Mistérios de Lisboa (Mysteries of Lisbon, Raoul Ruiz, 2010) on the first day that the Lightbox was open to the public. I have since spent a good deal of money at the Lightbox attending Essential 100 screenings, foreign language films and the best new Canadian cinema. The highlights of my year included a screening of The Searchers (John Ford, 1956) introduced by Peter Bogdanovich and a screening of Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom (Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1975) introduced by John Waters. Bogdanovich and Waters each stuck around for intriguing question and answer periods as well. Unfortunately, I was unable to get tickets to many of the marquee events at the festival and have yet to see some of the films I was most hoping to see in 2010, such as Biutiful (Alejandro González Iñárritu) and Somewhere (Sophia Coppola, 2010).\n\nI greatly enjoyed many of the films I did see (including my pick for film of the year) as well as Caranchi (Pablo Trapero, 2010), though I am still trying to get my head around Film Socialisme (Jean-Luc Godard, 2010) months later. Like last year, I will limit my list to English-language films as I did not see a wide enough breadth of international cinema to properly create a fully inclusive list. My list is considerably more mainstream this year as my art-house viewing has been more classical due to the opening of the Lightbox. I have to catch up on this year’s top art-house releases in 2011. I consider The Kids Are All Right (Lisa Cholodenko, 2010) to be the most overrated film of the year.\n\nTop Ten\n\n1. Meek’s Cutoff (Kelly Reichardt, 2010)\n\n2. True Grit (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2010)\n\n3. Toy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010)\n\n4. Greenberg (Noah Baumbach, 2010)\n\n5. Black Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010)\n\n6. The Fighter (David O. Russell, 2010)\n\n7. Shutter Island (Martin Scorsese, 2010)\n\n8. Buried (Rodrigo Cortés, 2010)\n\n9. The Social Network (David Fincher, 2010)\n\n10. The Ghost Writer (Roman Polanski, 2010)\n\nWHEELER WINSTON DIXON\n\nRyan Professor of Film Studies, Coordinator of the Film Studies Program, Professor of English at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and Editor in Chief, with Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, of Quarterly Review and Film and Video.\n\n2010 was a deeply interesting year for the cinema, the year the medium went finally and irrevocably digital. This isn’t a bad thing. While 35mm projection is still (for the moment) the norm for final theatrical presentation, that’s changing, too, and all-digital theatres are popping up across the globe. Digital production is now commonplace, and becoming the rule, not just for spectacle films like James Cameron’s Avatar (2009), but also for intimate films, such as David Fincher’s The Social Network (2010). Neither is a particularly interesting film, though Avatar is now the most commercially successful film of all time (or, no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the average viewer), and The Social Network is being hailed as an Oscar front-runner, and will probably walk away with Best Picture and Best Director, despite the fact that it’s nothing more or less than a B+ TV movie. Fincher’s penchant, in particular, for doing multiple digital takes of even the simplest scenes, and then erasing them before going on to do more, raises a host of interesting questions. William Wyler was notorious for shooting up to 40 takes of a scene to get the naturalism he wanted from this actors, but in his case, all the takes were preserved on film, giving him a much wider range of performances to choose from. Who knows what values are lost in Fincher’s erased takes?\n\nThe new RED digital cameras make high-definition digital production easily accessible to even the most cost-conscious production, and you can even do a creditable job with “prosumer” equipment, as Gareth Edwards’ Monsters (2010) ably proved, in a film shot for a minimal budget which is infinitely more interesting than either of the two films mentioned above. In addition, Monsters was distributed online via streaming video on Amazon in the United States, as well as On-Demand television; it never really got a theatrical release, but still got out to a wide cross-section of viewers. The same thing was true of the nearly all-digital release of Claire Denis’ superb White Material (2009). Watch on an iPad, or a laptop, or a television; no need for prints or distribution costs, and most advertising is word-of-mouth. Jalmari Helander’s transgressive Finnish Christmas tale, Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale (2010), in which Santa is revealed to be a ravening monster, became a solid hit in the United States through digital downloads alone. Also, in late 2010, the mail order DVD giant Netflix announced plans to do away with DVDs entirely, and move to streaming video exclusively as fast as they could; with instant gratification a click away, why bother waiting for the postman? Blockbuster Video subsequently cut its three-day rental rate for in-store DVDs to 99 cents for most releases; an act of pure desperation. It won’t work. Books, movies, music; they’re all going online to stay, and that’s the way it rolls at the end of the first decade of the 21st century.\n\nSo, in the midst of this rapidly changing landscape, my list of the Ten Best of 2010, in no particular order, is:\n\nWhite Material\n\nMonsters\n\nUn prophète (A Prophet, Jacques Audiard, 2009)\n\nWinter’s Bone (Debra Granik, 2010)\n\nPlease Give (Nicole Holofcener, 2010)\n\nThe Kids Are All Right (Lisa Cholodenko, 2010)\n\nAnimal Kingdom (David Michôd, 2010)\n\nShtikat Haarchion (A Film Unfinished, Yael Hersonski, 2010)\n\nGet Low (Aaron Schneider, 2009)\n\nRestrepo (Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger, 2010)\n\nMost Overrated\n\nInception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)\n\nThe Social Network\n\nThe reconstruction of Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1927)\n\nThe Killer Inside Me (Michael Winterbottom, 2010)\n\nMadeo (Mother, Bong Joon-ho, 2009)\n\nRUSSELL EDWARDS\n\nFilm critic for Variety.\n\n1.

Yukai Rapusodi (Accidental Kidnapper, Hideo Sakaki, 2010)\n\nDAVID EHRENSTEIN\n\nWriter on film, literature and politics, whose books include The Scorsese Picture: The Art and Life of Martin Scorsese and Open Secret: Gay Hollywood 1928-2000.\n\n1. Film Socialisme (Jean-Luc Godard, 2010)\n\nGodard at his very best ever.\n\n2. Loong Boonmee raleuk chat (Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, 2010)\n\n“Joe” at his very best – to date.\n\n3. The Ghost Writer (Roman Polanski, 2010)\n\nPolanski directs the year’s best documentary.\n\n4. Howl (Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, 2010)\n\nRob and Jeffrey, greatly aided by James Franco and Jon Hamm, evoke the spirit and art of Allen Ginsberg.\n\n5. Io sono l’amore (I Am Love, Luca Guadagnino, 2009)\n\nGuadagnino revives the spirit of Luchino Visconti with the invaluable aide of Tilda Swinton.\n\n6. L’enfer d’Henri-Georges Clouzot (Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Inferno, Serge Bromberg and Ruxandra Medrea, 2009)\n\nA lost film saved.\n\n7. Guy and Madeleine on a Park Bench (Damien Chazelle, 2009)\n\nAs if the ghosts of John Cassavetes and Jacques Demy collaborated on a musical version of Guns of the Trees (Jonas Mekas, 1961).\n\n8. The Social Network (David Fincher, 2010)\n\nOr the perils of social climbing.\n\n9. The City of Your Final Destination (James Ivory, 2009)\n\nIvory without Merchant scores a triumph that sadly far too few saw.\n\n10. The Kids Are All Right (Lisa Cholodenko, 2010)\n\nLeave It To Beaver 2010.\n\nGWENDOLYN AUDREY FOSTER\n\nProfessor in the Film Studies program at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and the author of numerous books, including the forthcoming 21st Century Hollywood: Movies in the Era of Transformation and A Short History of Film, both co-authored with Wheeler Winston Dixon.\n\nThis list reflects the fact that although many of my “greatest films of 2010” were in fact theatrically released last year, I was only able to see them in 2010, usually through pay-per-view, on our 42-inch flat screen plasma television. While it is great to have access to them at home, I’d be much more satisfied to view them on the big screen and enjoy them as they are meant to be viewed: on a huge screen in a dark room, in a communal atmosphere with an informed and opinionated audience.\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but I miss national theatrical distribution. I like to go to the movies. I love the whole experience. I have driven to Kansas City from Nebraska and flown to New York to view a film on the big screen. But with the rapid evolution of streaming video distribution, I fear that soon only blockbusters and the “safe” indies (often documentaries) and unchallenging but “pretty” foreign films will be theatrically released on the big screen. On the other hand, many brilliant small and foreign films are finding their audiences through word of mouth and critical opinion and flourishing because of the availability of these new digital platforms.\n\nNevertheless, I should stress that I depend on the opinions of numerous critics, many of whom I have been following for years, to guide me in my choices as a viewer; from there, I make up my own mind as to the values of the films I see. I am one cineaste who does not think film criticism is dead. Far from it. With the plethora of releases in so many emerging platforms, we need informed and opinionated critics more than ever.\n\nAs a side note, I’m happy to see so many women filmmakers doing so well, making foreign and American independent films on a modest budget and finding a wide and enthusiastic audience. I’d also like to mention La mujer sin cabeza (The Headless Woman, Lucrecia Martel), shot in 2008, but only now getting a US release. And Claire Denis’ White Material would be on this list, as it’s just being released in 2010 in the US, but it was on my list last year.\n\nBest Films of 2010\n\nPlease Give (Nicole Holofcener, 2010)\n\nThe Kids Are All Right (Lisa Cholodenko, 2010)\n\nGet Low (Aaron Schneider, 2009)\n\nLe père de mes enfants (Father of My Children, Mia Hansen-Løve, 2009)\n\nCairo Time (Ruba Nadda, 2009)\n\nSingularidades de uma Rapariga Loura (Eccentricities of a Blonde-Haired Girl, Manuel de Oliveira, 2009)\n\nAnimal Kingdom (David Michôd, 2010)\n\nUn prophète (A Prophet, Jacques Audiard, 2009)\n\nAu fond des bois (Deep in the Woods, Benoît Jacquot, 2010)\n\nSomewhere (Sofia Coppola, 2009)\n\nMost Overrated\n\nThe Social Network (David Fincher, 2010)\n\nInception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)\n\nShutter Island (Martin Scorsese, 2010)\n\nCyrus (Jay and Mark Duplass, 2010)\n\nBlack Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010)\n\nThe Limits of Control (Jim Jarmusch, 2009)\n\nPATRICK FRIEL\n\nFormer Program Director at Chicago Filmmakers (1996-2007), now Festival Director and Programmer of the Onion City Experimental Film and Video Festival (run by Chicago Filmmakers).\n\nI don’t see enough new releases to make a meaningful “best of” list, so what follows are those films and videos (seen in any format) that resonated the most for me the past year. Some are clearly great; others not so, but excited me none-the-less. I’m omitting many great (but obviously so) older films seen for the first time this year (Stan Brakhage, Hollis Frampton, Gregory Markopoulos, etc.), concentrating primarily on new films and on unexpected or unexpectedly great viewing experiences.\n\nRevelatory repeat screening of the year\n\n7 Women (John Ford, 1966)\n\nIt took 25 years to see this again, but what originally left me cold as a young college student has revealed itself as a profound, beautiful and transcendent masterpiece.\n\nNew work by Kyle Canterbury\n\nFebruary\n\nToday,\n\nNov. Untitled\n\nSpring\n\nJune 23, 2010\n\nJune 30, 2010\n\nA\n\nNeither\n\nCanterbury continues to be the most astonishing (and still overlooked!) artist working today.\n\nWTF? viewing\n\nA Thief in the Night (Donald W. Thompson, 1972)\n\nA Distant Thunder (Donald W. Thompson, 1977)\n\nImage of the Beast (Donald W. Thompson, 1980)\n\nThe Prodigal Planet (Donald W. Thompson, 1983)\n\nThe Paradise Trail (Donald W. Thompson, 1974)\n\nBlood on the Mountain (Donald W. Thompson, 1979)\n\nA quartet of Christian End Times quasi-sci-fi films, a Christian-themed western, and a Christian-themed criminals-on-the-run thriller all show that independent, regional filmmaking will always have gems to discover. Thompson is no Don Siegel or Samuel Fuller, but he did have a definite sense of visual style that moves these oddities beyond their primary religious intent.\n\nEthnography / cinema-verite / essay film / documentary\n\nBlind Child (Johan van der Keuken, 1964)\n\nN!owa T’ama: The Melon Tossing Game (John Marshall, 1970)\n\nChildren Throw Toy Assegais (John Marshall, 1972)\n\nAn Argument About a Marriage (John Marshall, 1969)\n\nDebe’s Tantrum (John Marshall, 1972)\n\nLion Game (John Marshall, 1970)\n\nThe Meat Fight (John Marshall, 1974)\n\nPlaying with Scorpions (John Marshall, 1972)\n\nA Rite of Passage (John Marshall, 1972)\n\nTug-of-War – Bushmen (John Marshall, 1974)\n\nTrobriand Cricket: An Ingenious Response to Colonialism (Jerry Leach and Gary Kildea, 1973)\n\nChildren’s Magical Death (Timothy Asch and Napoleon Chagnon, 1974)\n\nFußball wie noch nie (Football as Never Before, Hellmuth Costard, 1970)\n\nPromised Lands (Susan Sontag, 1974)\n\nPoto and Cabengo (Jean-Pierre Gorin, 1979)\n\nDemon Lover Diary (Joel DeMott, 1980)\n\nSeventeen (Jeff Kreines and Joel DeMott, 1983)\n\nClose-Up (Abbas Kiarostami, 1990)\n\nFei Cheng (Ghost Town, Dayong Zhao, 2008)\n\nHelsinki, Ikuisesti (Helsinki, Forever, Peter von Bagh, 2008)\n\nWait, did I just unwittingly put together an amazing documentary class screening list?\n\nCrucial early cinema DVD releases\n\nChaplin at Keystone\n\nSegundo de Chomón ­ 1903-1912: El Cine de la Fantasia\n\nFantômas (Louis Feuillade, 1913-14)\n\nAsian cinema\n\nFuk sau (Vengeance, Johnnie To, 2009)\n\nHeshang aiqing (Cry Me a River, Jia Zhang-ke, 2008)\n\nDung che sai duk (Ashes of Time Redux, Wong Kar-wai, 1994/2008)\n\nBu san (Good Bye, Dragon Inn, Tsai Ming-liang, 2003)\n\nHe liu (The River, Tsai Ming-liang, 1997)\n\nAn exciting (but much too small) group of films that reminds me that I still have a lot of catching up to do with Asian film.\n\nAdditional new and retrospective features (alphabetical by director)\n\nAssault on Precinct 13 (John Carpenter, 1976)\n\n35 Rhums (35 Shots of Rum, Claire Denis, 2008)\n\nSlightly Scarlet (Allan Dwan, 1956)\n\nErie (Kevin Jerome Everson, 2009)\n\nMossafer (The Traveler, Abbas Kiarostami, 1974)\n\nDer starke Ferdinand (Strongman Ferdinand, Alexander Kluge, 1976)\n\nL.A.

It’s that time of year again as we get closer and closer to the beginning of a new year and look back at the receding one and what we can remember of it. Luckily, I can recall most of what I have seen. My response is tinged with regret over the films I have not seen but grateful for the ones I have. The films may not all be new, but in the last calendar year these are the films that have most thrilled and entertained me. So, for me, the populist cinemagoer, the films of the year, in no particular order, are:\n\nInception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)\n\nNolan follows up The Dark Knight (2008) with another behemoth of a film that is large in scale and subject matter, and in which dreamscapes abstract into landscapes as dreams become reality and vice-versa. This is matched by astounding central performances – none more so than that of Leonardo DiCaprio as the man who may or may not be locked in his own dream world. With a work vast in its ideas, and brilliant in its execution, Nolan returned with another summer blockbuster that entertained and treated the audience with respect rather than as popcorn-fed dunces.\n\nToy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010)\n\nThe story is complete, and Toy Story 3 is perhaps the greatest third film of any trilogy (sorry D3: The Mighty Ducks [Robert Lieberman, 1996]). Woody, Buzz, Jessie, Rex, Hamm, all returned in a film that was about accepting your lot in life, and that was also so careful in its depiction of ageing and mortality. Yes, it made me cry and anyone who did not was a person made of stone. Full of memorable moments: the “Great Escape” parody; the toy talking phone as an informant; the Spanish language Buzz; and the greatest reach out and touch someone moment in cinema history.\n\nThe Town (Ben Affleck, 2010)\n\nWhen you have so many films to see, you miss out on some. I still have not seen Gone Baby Gone (2007), Affleck’s directorial debut, but it might have given me some briefing on his style. But if his sophomore effort or difficult “second album” is anything to go by, Affleck conducts himself as a director of great competence and assurance in handling a very generic “cops and robbers” plot with great purpose and vigour. He even throws in one of his best smouldering performances to boot.\n\nMadeo (Mother, Bong Joon-ho, 2009)\n\nFirst seen at the London Film Festival in 2009, and seen again on release this year, Bong’s film is mesmerising in its depiction of a woman who will go to great lengths to protect her beloved son. Featuring a great performance from television star Kim Hye-ja as the synonymous mother, this is yet another instance of South Korea slowly becoming a powerhouse in world cinema and producing distinct cinematic works.\n\nEasier with Practice (Kyle Patrick Alvarez, 2009)\n\nI always have a soft spot for small, independent American films that can connect with people universally. This picture stars the brilliant Brian Geraghty (The Hurt Locker [Kathryn Bigelow, 2008]) as Davy, a character who answers his motel phone one night and whose life changes when he connects with the voice on the other end of the line. A road movie with no clear ending, it is helped along by a great lead role that is witty instead of reliant on gross-out American humour. I hope this film finds a wider audience that can appreciate it.\n\nKick-Ass (Matthew Vaughn, 2010)\n\nVaughn’s eventual stab at Hollywood comic-book cinema (after his removal from X-Men Origins: Wolverine, 2009) is a film that takes you by surprise. Visceral in its violence and laugh-out-loud funny in its knowledge of the genre, it is “endorsed” by Nicholas Cage doing his best Adam West impersonation along with help from Aaron Johnson, Mark Strong, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and the scene-stealing Chloe Moretz as “Hit Girl”, the cussing, true kick-ass star of the film.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon (Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, 2010)\n\nOdd, I know, to have two animated pictures in a year-end poll, but this Dreamworks effort from the directors of Lilo & Stitch (2002) is a film that grows on you and that takes itself in unexpected directions. Its hero, a flawed figure who finds respect from his peer group through his use of initiative, is a role model for the youth of today. As a character who is not afraid to wear his battle scars in public he provides a nice parallel with the Allied forces serving in Afghanistan.\n\nForbidden (Frank Capra, 1932)\n\nThe BFI ran a near complete career retrospective of Capra’s oeuvre from his work with Mack Sennett and the Keystone Cops to George Bailey (It’s a Wonderful Life, 1946) via Barbara Stanwyck. Offering a rare opportunity to see his films on the silver screen in all their glory, I afforded myself the pleasure of a matinee showing of this forgotten gem from 1932 in which Stanwyck fights for the love of the married Adolphe Menjou against the advances of a whimsical Ralph Bellamy. The shooting, editing and acting are characteristic of the Columbia style of the early 1930s, but it is astonishing to see how Capra developed from this to the eventual triumph of It Happened One Night (1934) and his other Oscar winners. Just as astonishing is the influence this film must have had on Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941), an effect that many are either unwilling to testify to or just will not believe in terms of plot, specific shots and the film’s general feel. A gem that I will always remember – as much for the experience as for the film.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven (John Sturges, 1960)\n\nThis was a treat for my father who is a Western genre nut, and can recite passages from this film by heart. Seen countless times huddled around a small television set in my youth, it was a pleasure to see it on the big screen at London’s Southbank. All sat there quietly as the curtains drew back and Elmer Bernstein’s unforgettable score roared off the screen. My Dad sat on the aisle (the original aisle sitter?) as the other six people in his group all looked at him, observing the big smile growing upon his face. It features a fascinating screenplay (in terms of its economy of words) and acting of the highest order (with Steve McQueen duelling with Yul Brynner for screen time but losing). Adapted from Akira Kurosawa’s Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurai, 1954), and itself influencing countless filmmakers, audiences are still encountering it due to the general power of its filmmaking. A highpoint for so many involved in its making, it is also a highpoint of my 2010 filmgoing.\n\nSalt (Phillip Noyce, 2010)\n\nAn admirable effort by Noyce to sex-up the spy film with Angelina Jolie as an “is she/isn’t she” Russian spy. Considering that this was originally intended as a vehicle for Tom Cruise (who lifted motorcycle stunts for his own Knight and Day [James Mangold, 2010]), Jolie makes the role of Evelyn Salt her own, and in so doing, created the necessary franchise that every Hollywood starlet should have.\n\nDisappointments\n\nThe Other Guys (Adam McKay, 2010)\n\nA let down in that I found many of its punchlines flat and unoriginal; Will Ferrell to be at his annoying, shouting worst; Mark Wahlberg criminally miscast; and Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson shamefully underused in their all too brief cameos.\n\nDate Night (Shawn Levy, 2010)\n\nFeaturing yet another American comedian (Steve Carell) shouting a lot. Both Carell and Tina Fey seem lost, and it tells you something when the best punchline is in the post-credit gag reel. A bit of a mess that makes Dude, Where’s My Car? (Danny Leiner, 2000) look like Dickens. After the success of last year’s The Hangover (Todd Phillips, 2009) this, coupled with the above title, was a step back for American comedy cinema.\n\nThe Wolfman (Joe Johnston, 2010)\n\nIt was going so well until the “truth” is revealed, and then the poor CGI that had delayed the original release date, and so should have been an improvement, meant that this film – featuring a decent turn by Benicio Del Toro – descended into an unnecessary monster mash-up that does not give you nightmares.\n\nGentlemen Broncos (Jared Hess, 2009)\n\nAn unfortunate mess considering that it was written and directed by Hess (Napoleon Dynamite, 2004). With the talent he had at his disposal, I expected something akin to Galaxy Quest (David Parisot, 1999) and instead got sub-par sci-fi mumbo-jumbo.\n\nJOHN GIANVITO\n\nFilmmaker, teacher, and curator based in Boston, Massachusetts. His latest film is Vapor Trail (Clark).\n\nOf what crossed my path in 2010, the following films (in no particular order) are the works I can presently recollect that mattered most to me:\n\nFree Land (Minda Martin, 2009)\n\nAmanar Tamasheq (Lluis Escartin, 2010)\n\nSawan Baan Na (Agrarian Utopia, Uruphong Raksasad, 2009)\n\nUkranian Time Machine series (Naomi Uman, 2008)\n\nNostalgia de la luz (Nostalgia for the Light, Patricio Guzman, 2010)\n\nMelancholia (Lav Diaz, 2008)\n\nMy Darling Clementine (John Ford, 1946) Extended director’s cut.\n\nComrades (Bill Douglas, 1986)\n\nNumero zero (Jean Eustache, 1971)\n\nHitparkup (Dissolution, Nina Menkes, 2010)\n\nEl familiar (Octavio Getino, 1973)\n\nQu’ils reposent en revolte (Des figures de guerre) (Sylvain George, 2010)\n\nGloria Mundi (Nico Papatakis, 1975/2005)\n\nAlgerie en flammes (Rene Vautier, 1958)\n\nIndependencia (Raya Martin, 2009)\n\nMissa on missa? (Where is Where?, Eiji-Liisa Ahtila, 2009)\n\nToujours moins (Luc Moullet, 2010)\n\nFe cheng (Ghost Town, Zhao Dayung, 2008)\n\nAdditionally, I would cite the exhibition, Sharon Lockhart: Lunch Break at the Colby College Museum of Art in Waterville, Maine.\n\nANTONY I. GINNANE\n\nProducer, distributor and commentator based in Melbourne and Los Angeles. He is President of FG Film Productions (Australia) Pty Ltd/IFM World Releasing Inc., as well as President of the Screen Producers Association of Australia.\n\nTop 10 (Eligibility: 2010 theatrical, festival or premiere DVD first release in The United States, Canada, Australia or New Zealand – listed alphabetically by title)\n\nBlack Swan (Darren Aronofsky, 2010)\n\nA mesmerising baroque blend of horror and melodrama. Seamlessly mixes vintage Brian De Palma and Roman Polanski’s Repulsion (1965) with All About Eve (Joseph L. Mankiewicz, 1950).\n\nBrighton Rock (Rowan Joffe, 2010)\n\nMore overheated melodrama – a seaside story that replaces the sci-fi of Losey’s The Damned (1963) with Get Carter Brit crime.\n\nLos abrazos rotos (Broken Embraces, Pedro Almodóvar, 2009)\n\nSirkian obsession and blindness as a metaphor for contemporary cinema.\n\nChloe (Atom Egoyan, 2010)\n\nThe sexual voyeurism Hitchcock would have created if he were working today. The camera refuses to let the guilty off the hook.\n\nThe Ghost Writer (Roman Polanski, 2010)\n\nCorruption and duplicity – modern politics and ’70s paranoia with an ironic overlay.\n\nHereafter (Clint Eastwood, 2010)\n\nEastwood considers Fritz Lang for predestination; Vincente Minnelli for Parisian passions and The 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Minnelli, 1962) and Claude Lelouch for every dream-like reverie and time-slip of cinema since the ’60s.\n\nUn prophète (A Prophet, Jacques Audiard, 2009)\n\nTough mob-style prison thriller recalls early Don Siegel. Taught and unforgiving.\n\nLa princesse de Montpensier (The Princess of Montpensier, Bertrand Tavernier, 2010)\n\nLush historical cinema with a contemporary edge. Tavernier channels George Cukor and Jean Renoir with his feisty heroine.\n\nShutter Island (Martin Scorsese, 2010)\n\nJacques Tourneur and his zombies meet Sam Fuller and his racists in this excitable piece of grand guignol.\n\nThe Town (Ben Affleck, 2010)\n\nWith his second feature, Ben Affleck joins Ron Howard as a classicist to watch. Affleck is a contender for Eastwood’s crown if he keeps at it.\n\nOther titles that have excited or inspired me during the year include\n\n1. The American (Anton Corbijn, 2010)\n\n2.

It was a year of worthy films, but far too many lacked precision and energy. The control that Polanski, Baumbach or Sofia Coppola had over their seemingly familiar material won me over far more than the sound and fury of Inception, a film that made me long for the gravitas of a Little Nemo comic. Other films, like The Arbor, about the short life of playwright Andrea Dunbar, had content that transcended the pretensions of their director or the technical constraints of zero budgets (Jamie Thraves and Ron Peck). I am not sure what it says about 2010 that my two favourite films, The Ghost Writer and Greenberg, were by and about a pariah respectively, but for many in the world, 2010 was probably a lonelier and more alienating year than that found on the silver screen.\n\nJOSÉ SARMIENTO HINOJOSA\n\nResearch and development consultant, musician and independent filmmaker in Lima, Peru.\n\nAbsolute Masterpieces:\n\n1.

There are some other films seen this year that probably deserve a higher ranking, but one viewing (which may have been under less than ideal circumstances) means I’m holding back some judgements, for example: Loong Boonmee raleuk chat (Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, Apitchatpong Weerasethakul, 2010); Revanche (Götz Spielmann, 2008), Animal Kingdom (David Michôd, 2010).\n\nCERISE HOWARD\n\nFreelance writer and film critic, her involvement with Senses of Cinema dates back to 2001.\n\nFavourite films of 2010\n\n(Criteria for inclusion: to have been seen in a cinema in 2010, or to have first hit the big screen in Melbourne, whether in commercial release or under other auspices, in 2010.)\n\nIbn Babil (Son of Babylon, Mohamed Al-Daradji, 2009)\n\nI Love You Phillip Morris (Glenn Ficarra & John Requa, 2009)\n\nDas weisse Band – Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (The White Ribbon, Michael Haneke, 2009)\n\nExit Through the Gift Shop (Banksy, 2010)\n\nShinboru (Symbol, Hitoshi Matsumoto, 20009)\n\nRabbit Hole (John Cameron Mitchell, 2010)\n\nWhite Material (Claire Denis, 2009)\n\nBoy (Taika Waititi, 2010)\n\nWinter’s Bone (Debra Granik, 2010)\n\nSoudain le vide (Enter the Void, Gaspar Noé, 2009)\n\nFig Trees (John Greyson, 2009)\n\nIn The Loop (Armando Iannucci, 2009)\n\nEhky Ya Shahrazad (Scheherazade Tell Me a Story, Yousry Nasrallah, 2009)\n\nInception (Christopher Nolan, 2010)\n\nCopie conforme (Certified Copy, Abbas Kiarostami, 2010)\n\nReel Injun (Neil Diamond, 2009)\n\nSahman (Border, Harutyun Khachatryan, 2009)\n\nThe Hurt Locker (Kathryn Bigelow, 2008)\n\nUn prophète (A Prophet, Jacques Audiard, 2009)\n\nPlus three brilliant animated features\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox (Wes Anderson, 2009)\n\nL’illusionniste (The Illusionist, Sylvain Chomet, 2010)\n\nToy Story 3 (Lee Unkrich, 2010)\n\nAnd not to forget that it was preceded by the marvellous and ingenious short, Day & Night (Teddy Newton, 2010).\n\nHonourable mentions\n\nTRON: Legacy (Joseph Kosinski, 2010)\n\nFour Lions (Christopher Morris, 2010)\n\nValhalla Rising (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2009)\n\nAnimal Kingdom (David Michôd, 2010)\n\nThe first ¾ of Tetro (Francis Ford Coppola, 2009)\n\nPrecious (Lee Daniels, 2009)\n\nKûki ningyô (Air Doll, Hirokazu Koreeda, 2009)\n\nBibliothèque Pascal (Szabolcs Hajdu, 2010)\n\nMe and Orson Welles (Richard Linklater, 2009)\n\nKawasakiho růže (Kawasaki’s Rose, Jan Hřebejk, 2009)\n\nRubber (Quentin Dupieux, 2010)\n\nHanyo (The Housemaid, Im Sang-soo, 2010)\n\nWelt am Draht (World on a Wire, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, 1973)\n\nThe Road (John Hillcoat, 2009)\n\nReykjavik-Rotterdam (Óskar Jónasson, 2008)\n\nPeepli Live (Anusha Rizvi & Mahmood Farooqui, 2010)\n\nLa danse – Le ballet de l’Opéra de Paris (Frederick Wiseman, 2009)\n\nSummer Coda (Richard Gray, 2010)\n\nThe Social Network (David Fincher, 2010)\n\nWhere the Wild Things Are (Spike Jonze, 2009)\n\nRetrospective revelations\n\nLásky Jedné Plavovlásky (Loves of a Blonde, Miloš Forman, 1966)\n\nTaking Off (Miloš Forman, 1971)\n\nYa shagayu po Moskve (I Step Through Moscow, Georgi Daneliya, 1963)\n\nÔkami to buta to ningen (Wolves, Pigs and Men, Kinji Fukasaku, 1964)\n\nOmocha (The Geisha House, Kinji Fukasaku, 1999)\n\nWest of Zanzibar (Tod Browning, 1928)\n\nThe Unknown (Tod Browning, 1927)\n\nYuen Ling-yuk (Centre Stage, Stanley Kwan, 1992)\n\nOne Hour With You (Ernst Lubitsch, 1932)\n\nThe War Game (Peter Watkins, 1965)\n\nSix Shooter (Martin McDonagh, 2004)\n\nMeta-cinematic events of note\n\nMuch trumpeting vaunted the staging in Melbourne of two discrete theatrical adaptations of films themselves heavily concerned with matters theatrical. The Melbourne Theatre Company’s production of All About My Mother was a great disappointment, an accidental Australian analogue of a Europudding production that trampled all over my love of Pedro Almodóvar’s wonderful 1999 film. Toneelgroep Amsterdam’s take on John Cassavetes’ Opening Night (1977), however, was several other whole kettles of fish, a superbly executed, multimedia re-imagining of its inspiration text replete with some very clever (and amusing) site-specific manoeuvrings.\n\nAlso: hats off to all involved in the performed cinema free-for-all that was “Superstream”, staged during the Melbourne Fringe Festival by members of the Grenoble-based live cinema quartet, Superflux, in collaboration with Melbourne AV collective Stream, and to Jake Wilson for curating “Grain of the Voice: 50 Years of Sound and Image by Arthur and Corinne Cantrill” at ACMI over more Sundays than, regrettably, I managed to get along to.\n\nDVD\n\nMuch kudos to Madman Entertainment"
