        "text": "French actress Clémence Poesy first rose to international fame when she joined the film world of \"Harry Potter\" and cemented her standing with her work on \"The Tunnel\" (Sky Atlantic, 2013-).\n\nBorn in Paris, she began acting in small parts as a child with her father, actor/writer Etienne Guichard. As a teenager, she earned roles on French television in the series \"Un homme en colere\" (1997-2002) and \"Les Monos\" (1999-2005).\n\nShe made her English language debut playing Mary, Queen of Scots in the miniseries \"Gunpowder, Treason & Plot\" (BBC, 2004). Her profile took a major leap forward when she was cast in \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\" (2005).\n\nPoesy played Fleur Delacour, one of the contestants opposite Daniel Radcliffe and Robert Pattinson in the film's Triwizard Tournament. She then appeared with Bill Pullman and Natascha McElhone in the mini-series \"Revelations\" (NBC, 2005).\n\nShe starred in the French films \"Le grand Meaulnes\" (2006) and \"Sans moi\" (2007), before playing Natasha Romanov in the international mini-series \"War and Peace\" (2007).\n\nShe returned to English-language projects with a role in the Golden Globe-winning \"In Bruges\" (2008), with Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson. She then appeared in the James Franco drama \"127 Hours\" (2010), before making her U.S. television debut with a guest arc on \"Gossip Girl\" (The CW, 2007-12).\n\nShe returned to Harry Potter once again, reprising her role of Fleur in the film series final two films, \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, Part 1\" (2010) and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, Part 2\" (2011).\n\nAfter appearing opposite Eddie Redmayne in the TV mini-series \"Birdsong\" (BBC, 2012), she began her most acclaimed role when she was cast as the female lead in the crime drama \"The Tunnel\" (Sky Atlantic, 2013-).\n\nHer role as French police detective Elise Wasserman, who partners with Stephen Dillane's British detective to solve crimes, garnered her international raves. Poesy returned to the big screen starring in the French comedy \"Two Is a Family\" (2016) and Stanley Tucci's \"Final Portrait\" (2017), alongside Armie Hammer and Geoffrey Rush.\n\nShe then joined Antonio Banderas in the second season of \"Genius\" (National Geographic, 2017-) playing French painter/author Françoise Gilot, one of Pablo Picasso's many love interests."
