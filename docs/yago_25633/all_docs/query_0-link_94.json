        "text": "Featured image from StageFright.\n\nI’ve been pretty busy and gotten way behind on this… this entry represents something like four months of Film Diary. I watched a ton of horror movies, including all of Fulci except some of the early comedies, a complete Argento rewatch (still underway), and a full survey of one other director who I’ll leave as a surprise. I decided to break those out into separate posts. Here’s most of the other stuff I watched. I’m going to lead with horror because it’s that time of year.\n\nFavorites (relative to the category) highlighted in bold.\n\nRecent Horror\n\nNot a lot of great news here. I thought highly of the first three, but the others range from half-decent to terrible.\n\nUnsane (Soderbergh, 2018)\n\nOn the border between horror and thriller, and extremely effective. One of my favorites of the year so far. It does a great job building a terrifying feeling of confinement and powerlessness.\n\n47 Meters Down (Roberts, 2017)\n\nThis Mandy Moore shark movie is very successful relative to its ambitions. It’s not quite as good as The Shallows, but it’s a total hoot. Forget everything you may happen to know about scuba diving and just roll with it. I literally screamed at one point. I mean I screamed an involuntary, high-pitched scream like a shark was actually about to eat me. It’s been a long time since a movie made me really and truly scream.\n\nHold the Dark (Saulnier, 2018)\n\nSoooooooooo weird! Absolutely not what I was expecting on the basis of Netflix’s description. I like Saulnier’s other work so I gave it a shot, and this is definitely not the wolf-themed survival movie it was advertised as. This is the most Black Metal movie ever. People are taking about how Mandy is so metal. No way: Mandy is prog rock. Hold the Dark is metal. I dug it.\n\nBeyond the Black Rainbow (Cosmatos, 2010), Mandy (Cosmatos, 2018)\n\nI watched these as a double feature and thought they were pretty meh. This director makes glorified music videos. The storytelling is totally inept, which would be fine if these movies achieved something worthwhile in atmosphere and tone, but they really don’t. It’s all predictable and has been done much better before. Cage mostly repeats himself in Mandy, often crossing over into self-parody (though the vodka scene is great). For recent Cage movies, I’ll take Looking Glass or Mom and Dad over Mandy any day of the week.\n\nA Quiet Place (Krasinski, 2018)\n\nI completely hated this. It’s one of the worst horror movies of the decade. The exposition is literally done on a white board. The internal logic is broken: the creatures can hear a jar tip over from outside the house but they can’t hear a scared person breathing if they hide behind a desk? It’s not suspenseful because the rules are so unclear. The screenplay does a poor job extrapolating the horror possibilities of the premise and the climactic plot solution is very dissatisfying. All the acting is terrible, the creatures aren’t cool or scary, and the PG-13 gore is tepid and boring.\n\nHereditary (Aster, 2018)\n\nThis is a C-grade Paranormal Activity riff combined with a Polanski rip off and dressed up as a weighty grief drama. Toni Colette’s fully batshit performance elevates it, but there are a few serious missteps (especially some aspects of the climax) and it takes itself too seriously for how clichéd it is.\n\nRevenge (Fargeat, 2017)\n\nStylistically slick rape-revenge movie, relatively light on the rape. It’s too slick for its own good, and really nothing new, but the final bloody showdown is impressive.\n\nThe Strangers: Prey at Night (Roberts, 2018)\n\nA lot of people celebrate this for its retro 80’s sensibility, but it didn’t work for me. It’s way homage heavy, but mostly goes for really obvious nods (though I do appreciate the Christine love). My main problem with it is that it totally loses what made the first Strangers movie special: the surreal and terrifying breakdown in spatial logic, creative use of sound, relentless sense of confinement, and abstract rendering of the horror menace. I prefer retro horror that actually embodies a retro form (like House of the Devil) rather than movies like this that just make lots of cheeky references.\n\nUnfriended: Dark Web (Susco, 2018)\n\nA sequel to Unfriended, the gimmick is that the entire movie takes place on a computer desktop. The form is really cool and I’m highly in favor of this sort of high concept horror, but the screenplay is too dumb even for me.\n\nThe First Purge (McMurray, 2018)\n\nI liked this just fine. If you like the other Purge movies, then certainly go for it, but otherwise don’t go out of your way.\n\nOther Horror\n\nMountain of the Cannibal God (Martino, 1978); Cannibal Holocaust (Deodato, 1980); Cannibal Ferox (Lenzi, 1981)\n\nThese are three of the most significant entries in the Italian Jungle Exploitation subgenre. Mountain of the Cannibal God is pretty trashy, with a few extremely transgressive moments. Cannibal Holocaust is a masterpiece. It’s a masterpiece that I specifically recommend not watching unless you’ve seen a whole lot of horror movies and are highly desensitized. It will mess you right the hell up. It’s often claimed to be the most extreme horror movie ever made, and I think all things considered that’s probably accurate. It’s also the most brutal indictment of western civilization I’ve ever encountered. Cannibal Ferox is a relatively silly, campy, fun take on similar material. Be warned that all of these movies (and really all the other Italian Jungle movies from this period) contain unsimulated violence against animals. This is part of why there will probably never again be a movie as grotesque as Cannibal Holocaust: you just can’t get away with this kind of thing anymore.\n\nThe Exorcist (Friedkin, 1973)\n\nNo matter how many times I watch this, it still shocks me when the little girls says “Your mother sucks cocks in hell!”\n\nBrain Damage (Henenlotter, 1988)\n\nOne of a kind, with fantastic practical effects and a dark sense of humor. There’s a monster, and the monster secretes hard drugs.\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (Craven, 1984)\n\nI loved it as a kid (though it utterly terrified me), and I still love it today. I appreciate the surreal nightmare compositions now more than ever.\n\nHalloween (Carpenter, 1978)\n\nI hope I don’t ever let a whole year go by where I don’t watch Halloween. 90 minutes of total perfection.\n\nStageFright (Soavi, 1987)\n\nThis is an excellent post-giallo Italian slasher movie with a great premise: the cast of a stage play about a murderer is locked in the theater with the actual murderer that the play is about! Stylistically on point.\n\nDeath Walks on High Heels (Ercoli, 1971); Death Walks at Midnight (Ercoli, 1972)\n\nA couple of classic gialli starring Nieves Navarro. They are both very good. In the former, she plays an exotic dancer whose jewel thief father has recently been murdered. She’s stalked by criminals who think she has the latest batch of stolen diamonds. In the latter, she plays a model who witnesses a murder through the window across the street while she’s experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs. The ending is bonkers. Of the two, I prefer Death Walks at Midnight.\n\nBlade (Norrington, 1998), Blade II (del Toro, 2002), Blade: Trinity (Goyer, 2004)\n\nThe Blade trilogy holds up well. Guillermo del Toro’s installment is clearly superior to the other two, but they are all great. The third one is underappreciated: it’s got very strong Parker Posey factor, not to mention Triple H.\n\nSociety (Yunza, 1989)\n\nBeverly Hills cannibal orgy horror, with superb practical effects. Recommended\n\nSpontaneous Combustion (Hooper, 1990)\n\nNuclear family goes nuclear. The Brad Dourif/Tobe Hooper combo is dreamy. The movie’s perhaps a little uneven but its high points are tremendous.\n\nCrocodile (Hooper, 2000)\n\nNot one of Tobe Hooper’s better movies, but I’ve always had a soft spot for it. Certainly, it’s no Eaten Alive, but he clearly had fun with the direct-to-Cinemax creature feature aesthetic. It’s campy and fun.\n\nThe Nude Vampire (Rollin, 1970)\n\nThis is a good entry point into Jean Rollin’s Eurotrash artsy erotic vampire horror.\n\nDead & Buried (Sherman, 1981)\n\nThis is a largely neglected but very worthwhile example of the socio-political horror that flourished in the 70’s and 80’s. Great ending.\n\nI Saw the Devil (Kim, 2010)\n\nBrutal South Korean revenge horror. I thought it was derivative, moralistic (not a quality I can easily tolerate in revenge horror), and way too long, but it has some solid brutality.\n\nJu-on: The Grudge (Shimizu, 2002)\n\nYou know, I actually think I like the American remake (by the same director) better. This is not my favorite subgenre of Japanese horror.\n\nNew Releases (other than horror)\n\nFirst Reformed (Schrader, 2017)\n\nI posted about this already, and yeah, I think it’s a masterpiece and easily the best film of the year.\n\nLet the Sunshine In (Denis, 2017)\n\nThis one is very hard to talk about. She wasn’t trying to accomplish much here: she made this to kill time while a more expensive project was on hold. The movie feels half baked, but not in a bad way. It’s liberating. She’s not trying to make the greatest movie ever, she’s just running with some ideas. At the zoomed in level, the acting, writing, and direction are extraordinary, and I found myself just getting lost in the details. I love the film.\n\nUpgrade (Whannell, 2018)\n\nOne of the best genre movies of the year. Black Mirror but good.\n\nReady Player One (Spielberg, 2018)\n\nForget the haters on this one. I’ve watched it three times and I find the thought of watching it again very appealing. This is master class pop movie-making.\n\nLeave No Trace (Granik, 2018)\n\nI hated it. I found the drama very underwhelming and all the nature photography reeked of city folk overly enamored with ferns. It felt like a big Instagram post about a New Yorker’s visit to Oregon. It even has an Instagram filter look to it. For me what this movie needed was a real conflict. Maybe a bounty hunter or a killer bear. The father-daughter PTSD shtick wasn’t enough to sustain this.\n\nSkyscraper (Thurber, 2018)\n\nThe Rock only has one leg and the title is Skyscraper. It’s exactly what you’d expect. I certainly enjoyed it.\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (Howard, 2018)\n\nIt wasn’t bad but it also wasn’t good. I really don’t care, but I don’t regret watching it.\n\nBlockers (Cannon, 2018)\n\nVastly better than I expected it to be. Downright hilarious. It’s a female-centric update of American Pie. What I most appreciate about it is that, like Broad City, it gives the female characters plenty of filthy dialogue.\n\nIsle of Dogs (Anderson, 2018)\n\nMeh. It’s got some good qualities but this might be Wes Anderson’s weakest movie. The Greta Gerwig stuff is completely tone deaf and terrible by any standard.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (Reed, 2018)\n\nPretty good. Certainly one of the better Marvel movies.\n\nKuro (Koyama, 2017)\n\nWeird experimental movie where the relationship between narration and image is oblique. We are being told a story of the protagonist and her boyfriend taking care of an elderly man in Japan, but the images (which don’t get contextualized much) depict her taking care of her paraplegic boyfriend in the present. I liked it a lot.\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (Branagh, 2017)\n\nGodawful in every respect, but what I hate most about it is the shameful waste of Willem Dafoe.\n\nWulu (Coulibaly, 2016)\n\nScarface riff from Mali. It’s pretty non-descript and forgettable.\n\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (Bayona, 2018)\n\nIt’s too long and Bryce Dallas Howard is bad, but I do like some things about this: fun genre hopping, amazing Republican dinosaur auction scene.\n\nThe Death of Stalin (Iannucci, 2017)\n\nI hated it. One would not expect that this material would be apt for a comedy, and it turns out it isn’t. Jeffery Tambor is godawful. Rupert Friend from Homeland as Vasily Stalin is the one shining light.\n\nThe Beguiled (Coppola, 2017)\n\nMeh.\n\nThe Rider (Zhao, 2017)\n\nEh…. the acting is really good but otherwise I don’t care.\n\nHannah Gadsby: Nanette (2018)\n\nI read somewhere that the recent Bill Maher standup special represents comedy’s past while the Hannah Gadsby special represents its future, and I thought this was an intriguing claim so I tried to watch them both. I found the Bill Maher special unwatchable. It sucks. I did watch Nanette all the way through, and if this is the future of comedy then god help us all. I thought it was terrible. It’s more of a social justice TEDx Talk than a comedy routine. I felt like I was being manipulated: she dumps out so much emotional carnage that I’m a bad person if I don’t adopt an admiring attitude and fawn about how devastating it all is. I’m not going to play along with that. I thought it was terrible.\n\nFrank Borzage\n\nI’ve been meaning to dive into Borzage for about a decade, and I finally got around to it.\n\nI ranked these:\n\n14) Liliom (1930)\n\nSluggish early talkie.\n\n13) Bad Girl (1931)\n\nEh, very grown up marriage drama with a focus on economic strain (like Man’s Castle in some ways, but not as good). I didn’t particularly enjoy the leads.\n\n12) Lazybones (1925)\n\nThis is an amazing indictment of the protestant work ethic until it turns super creepy (in a bad way).\n\n11) A Farewell to Arms (1932)\n\nTerrible as a Hemmingway adaptation, decent as a stand-alone romantic drama.\n\n10) Street Angel (1928)\n\nI found this the least compelling of the Gaynor-Farrell romances. The use of the Fox sets is fantastic and some of the Murnau-influenced expressionist visuals are striking, but for me the narrative dragged.\n\n9) Man’s Castle (1933)\n\nAngry working class romance with Spencer Tracy. Good stuff.\n\n8) Lucky Star (1929)\n\nVery nice Gaynor-Farrell silent romance.\n\n7) Strange Cargo (1940)\n\nExtremely weird, religious Lifeboat meets Rescue Dawn with Joan Crawford. I dug it.\n\n6) 7th Heaven (1927)\n\nDreamy silent romance with Gaynor and Farrell. Essential.\n\n5) Desire (1936)\n\nVery funny screwball comedy, in collaboration with Lubitsch. Gary Cooper plays a straight-laced American on vacation and Marlene Dietrich plays a con artist he gets entangled with. Fans of Howard Hawks’ Ball of Fire will enjoy this.\n\n4) Mannequin (1937)\n\nExcellent drama concerned with gender politics. Starring Joan Crawford and Spencer Tracy.\n\n3) The Mortal Storm (1940)\n\nEarly anti-Nazi movie with Jimmy Stewart as a German who takes a stand at great peril. Very powerful stuff.\n\n2) History is Made at Night (1937)\n\nWonderful gonzo romantic comedy. Ridiculous and joyous.\n\n1) Moonrise (1948)\n\nDark sins-of-the-father swamp noir. I think it’s Borzage’s best film by a large margin.\n\nGance\n\nJ’accuse (1919), La Roue (1923), Napoleon (1927)\n\nI watched through Gance’s three major silent epics. J’accuse is undeniably impressive but I didn’t find it as compelling overall and it dragged for stretches. It doesn’t have the same level of visionary grandeur as the other two, which are all time masterpieces. La Roue is the missing piece for understanding what Guy Maddin is up to, particularly in Careful. It’s one of the biggest, craziest movies I’ve ever seen, and I loved it. But nothing can top Napoleon, which is one of my favorite movies of the silent era. It’s technically over the top and unrepentantly heroic. He invented so many techniques for this movie that were way ahead of their time, and some were never repeated.\n\nStraub/Huillet\n\nNot Reconciled (1965), The Bridegroom, the Actress, and the Pimp (1968), En rachachant (1982)\n\nI was imagining I was going to power through the rest of the Straub/Huillet filmography in a few months. Not even close. This stuff is remarkably difficult, but also very rewarding. I watched Not Reconciled six times, and I forced everyone at a full weekend aesthetics conference to watch it with me. Half of them hated it, half of the loved it. It’s an aggressively difficult movie that jumps forwards and backwards in time by decades without any signaling and introduces a huge cast of characters with almost zero exposition. It takes place over the course of 50 years but is less than an hour long. I think it’s absolutely stunning, and having taken the time to map it all out I can report that there is an almost entirely coherent interpretation available.\n\nResnais\n\nJe t’aime, je t’aime (1968), Stavisky… (1974), My American Uncle (1980)\n\nJe t’aime, je t’aime is the most Resnais movie ever. The classic Resnais theme is memory and identity. This movie imagines a sci fi scenario where a man who has just survived a suicide attempt is enlisted to test a time travel machine. He ends up unstuck in time, forced to relive bits and pieces of his memories in a chaotic way. The grim drama of the movie is generated from the fact that he’s suicidal: he was chosen for the experiment because he had already tried to kill himself and so the scientists felt alright about risking his life, but what worse torture could there be than having to relive the events that led up to his suicide attempt with the benefit of hindsight? It’s a great film, and clearly an influence on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Stavisky is a minor work about the Stavisky affair. I didn’t love it. My American Uncle is a very energetic film tracing the lives of multiple individuals within the framework of a scientific study applying a thesis about behavioral determinism to human beings. I really didn’t like the framing, because the scientific theory itself is so dumb, but the individual narratives are well-rendered and I liked the movie overall.\n\nTaiwan\n\nTaipei Story (Yang, 1985)\n\nI’ve made New Taiwanese Cinema a staple of my movie diet the last year or so. Angela loves this stuff. Most of these movies manage to simultaneously succeed as human dramas and engage with the historical transformations that Taiwan underwent in the 20th century. Taipei Story is no exception. It feels like what it is: the first film by a great genius. It’s not as fully developed as his other work but it’s brilliant in its own way and full of quietly devastating acting performances.\n\nThe Terrorizers (Yang, 1986)\n\nNow *this* is a damn movie. This is one of the best things I’ve seen in recent months. Multiple narratives are woven together through coincidence, as a way of examining the theme of globalization and its effect on Taiwan.\n\nDust in the Wind (Hou, 1986)\n\nThe third part of Hou Hsiao-hsien’s coming-of-age trilogy. As one would expect, it’s melancholy and lyrical, combining psychological nuance with a backdrop of socio-political transformation. It doesn’t stand out to me as a high point of Hou’s filmography but it’s very good.\n\nVive L’Amour (Tsai, 1994)\n\nI completely loved this. It’s about three lonely people who intersect because of an empty apartment: two squatters and the real estate agent trying to rent it out. I think out of what I’ve seen this is my favorite Tsai film. It seamlessly moves between lurid psychosexual material and gut-punching emotional poignancy.\n\nThe River (Tsai, 1997)\n\nMaximally depressing. Its surface theme is chronic pain, and it’s relentless about it. This movie ruined my day, but it was worth it. I think it’s great.\n\nPasolini\n\nAccattone (1961), Mama Roma (1962), The Gospel According to Matthew (1964), Teorema (1968), Porcile [aka Pigsty] (1969)\n\nI took a course on Pasolini when I was an undergrad but I never really cared too much for his work, aside from Salo. There was a Pasolini feature on Filmstruck so I decided to reconsider. I really loved The Gospel According to Matthew, which is a retelling of the Christ story that focuses on his activities as an agitator against the political and social order. I disliked Teorema, which doesn’t live up to its lyrical posture and is ultimately pretty trite. Accattone and Mama Roma are gritty works of social realism. As much as I love Anna Magnani, Accattone is easily the better of the two. I admire how abrasive Porcile is, and the Pierre Clémenti stuff is amazing, but I found it overall tedious.\n\nFred Astaire\n\nFlying Down to Rio (1933), Roberta (1935), Follow the Fleet (1936), Shall We Dance (1937), Carefree (1938), Funny Face (1957)\n\nI’ve been watching and rewatching Fred Astaire movies at a pretty steady clip this year, and it’s just endlessly delightful. The first couple listed are light on the Astaire song and dance and not all that strong (Roberta is much better than Flying Down to Rio), but the other four are pure joy.\n\nOzon\n\nSitcom (1998), Criminal Lovers (1999), Water Drops on Burning Rocks (2000), Double Lover (2017)\n\nThe only Ozon movies I had seen were Swimming Pool, Under the Sand, and Potiche. I had a very wrong idea of what Ozon is all about on the basis of those titles. I was never crazy about Swimming Pool, but Under the Sand is a potent drama and Potiche is a delightful feminist Demy homage with an excellent Catherine Deneuve performance. I had no idea, though, that Ozon is such an imp. These titles are all pretty damn lurid and boundary pushing. Sitcom really caught my attention: it’s like Teorema, but Terence Stamp is replaced by a pet rat. I liked it much, much better that Teorema. Double Lover is a Cronenberg-De Palma sort of thing, and it gives no fucks about making sense. Criminal Lovers is a Hansel and Gretel riff. Water Drops on Burning Rocks is based on an early Fassbender play.\n\nBuñuel\n\nDeath in the Garden (1956). Simon of the Desert (1965), Tristana (1970), The Phantom of Liberty (1974)\n\nI’ve seen the latter three (a long time ago) but not Death in the Garden. They all hold up really well but I particularly loved The Phantom of Liberty. It contains some of Buñuel’s most exhilarating and creative absurdities\n\nGodard\n\nRise and Fall of a Small Film Company (1986), Oh, Woe is Me (1993)\n\nI slowed down on Godard this installment but these were both extremely high quality. The former was previously thought to be lost and has only recently been recovered. It’s fairly alienating (as one would expect), but contains a brilliant comedic performance from Jean-Pierre Léaud. I think it’s great. The latter is a masterpiece. It’s one of Godard’s most beautiful films, with ethereal cinematography from the brilliant Caroline Champetier. It updates the myth of Alcmene and Amphitryon, wherein Zeus appeared to Alcmene disguised as her husband Amphitryon, resulting in her pregnancy with Heracles. In this version, the Amphitryon stand in is played by Gerard Depardieu.\n\nStar Wars Prequel Trilogy\n\nI revisited this, and my opinions were quite different this time around. I used to be a little bit of a Phantom Menace apologist. I’m done with that; I thought Jake Lloyd was just unbearable as Anakin. I liked the other two MUCH better this time. They are about a slow, insidious transition from democracy to fascism, and they are very effective at revealing how such a transition can be achieved by almost entirely well-meaning agents. Who proposes special executive powers to the senate after the Star Wars equivalent of the Reichstag fire? Jar Jar Binks. Who activates the clone army? Yoda. I used to be bothered by the acting from Christenson and Portman, but I actually liked it this time. I think it helped to have just watched all those Borzage movies: the acting style here is closer to an early talkie than a typical adventure epic, and I enjoyed the effect. I also appreciated how uncompromisingly dark the third prequel is. There are certainly some problems, such as the wasted opportunity of Mace Windu, but overall I’ll take Lucas’ sometimes misguided attempts to be a visionary over Disney’s fan service. I would say I now like the second and third prequels better than all of the Disney movies except The Last Jedi.\n\nMiyazaki\n\nNausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984), Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989), Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)\n\nAngela hadn’t seen any of these Miyazaki movies so we’ve been watching them all. I doubt anyone needs me to tell them how good they are. Howl’s Moving Castle especially improved for me on this rewatch. I bought all the new blu-ray releases, and many of them are essential purchases, because the subtitles are terrible on the Disney releases. Instead of actually translating the Japanese dialogue, they just use the transcript of the English dubbed track. If you’ve ever compared the English dubbing to the Japanese dialogue, the English versions are totally different and change the meaning of the movies in a noxious way. The only way to watch these movies is in Japanese with proper subtitles (so avoid the Disney releases!).\n\nDouble Feature: Crises of executive authority\n\nAdvise & Consent (Preminger, 1962), Seven Days in May (Frankenheimer, 1964)\n\nAdvise and Consent turned out to be absolutely perfect viewing for the Kavanaugh affair (I didn’t intend this, but it worked out—the Kavanaugh shit hit the fan like a week after I watched this). Lyndsey Graham does a pretty good Charles Laughton, but Kavanaugh is no Henry Fonda. Seven Days in May is a real potboiler, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Frankenheimer or political thrillers.\n\nJohn Ford Comedies\n\nThe Whole Town’s Talking (1933), Steamboat Round the Bend (1935)\n\nThese are both very good. The former has Edward G. Robinson playing an escaped murderer and his law-abiding doppelgänger. It’s a hoot. The latter, starring Will Rogers, is very bizarre, featuring a traveling wax museum and the world’s slowest boat race. It deal frankly with issues of class and race while maintaining a comedic tone. Worthwhile for anyone interested in Ford.\n\nFritz Lang\n\nThe Wandering Image (1920), Four Around a Woman (1921), While the City Sleeps (1956)\n\nThe first two are very early fragments and not particularly interesting except to Lang completists. The latter is an acrid journalism satire and one of Lang’s better late works. It’s an antecedent to Nightcrawler.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nGold Diggers of 1933 (LeRoy, 1933)\n\nAmazing and hilarious pre-code musical. I watched it two or three times as stress relief. It puts a huge smile on my face every time.\n\nChoose Me (Rudolph, 1984)\n\nStill intending to watch through Rudolph’s whole body of work but Angela isn’t into it so it’s hard to find the time. I think Choose Me is one of the best movies of the 80’s. It’s another entry in the “Keith Carradine rolls into town and fucks everyone” genre, and it creates an incredibly vivid world of neon signs and smoky bars, bathed in pink and purple. Barfly borrowed quite a lot from this.\n\nExcalibur (Boorman, 1981)\n\nI love it. I don’t know if I had ever seen it sober before. All the totally on the nose Wagner is what really puts it over the top.\n\nElection 2 [aka Triad Election] (To, 2006)\n\nRevisited this favorite. It’s wonderful.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey (Kubrick, 1968)\n\nSaw this in Imax sitting in the front row and it melted my face.\n\nHis Girl Friday (Hawks, 1940); Monkey Business (Hawks 1952)\n\nRevisited these wonderful Howard Hawks comedies and it made me very happy.\n\nThe Fugitive Kind (Lumet, 1960)\n\nI had never seen this before. Marlon Brando and Anna Magnani go absolutely apeshit on some Tennessee Williams.\n\nBig Wednesday (Milius, 1978)\n\nThe most John Milius of all John Milius movies?\n\nMy Brother’s Wedding (Burnett, 1983)\n\nIt’s rough around the edges but I think this gritty, low-budget family drama is truly great.\n\nRide in the Whirlwind (Hellman, 1966)\n\nExcellent existential western, though not as good as The Shooting.\n\nThe Draughtsman’s Contract (Greenaway, 1982), The Pillow Book (Greenaway, 1996)\n\nI like Peter Greenaway but I don’t love him. I think The Pillow Book is one of his better movies.\n\nMacao (N. Ray and Sternberg, 1952)\n\nForgettable noir, not really up to the standard one would expect from either director who worked on it.\n\nThe Last Unicorn (Bass and Rankin Jr., 1982)\n\nA favorite when I was a kid, it holds up really well! The America soundtrack is pretty amazing.\n\nAsparagus (Pitt, 1979)\n\nExcellent experimental animation full of phalluses.\n\nBlow-Up (Antonioni, 1966)\n\nI revisited this for the sake of its connection with The Terrorizers. I think it’s good, but lower-tier Antonioni.\n\nCasino Royale (Campbell, 2006)\n\nEvery time I revisit this I like it less. I now think it is one of the worst Bond movies. Certainly Craig is the worst Bond, and his only good Bond movie is Spectre.\n\nThe Magic Sun (Niblock, 1966)\n\nExperimental Sun Ra shit. Enjoyed it.\n\nKino Eye (Vertov, 1924)\n\nNot as appealing as Man with a Movie Camera.\n\nBallet Méchanique (Léger and Murphy, 1924)\n\nFantastic little Dadaist short. Highly recommended.\n\nNight Movies (Penn, 1975)\n\nTop-tier Gene Hackman Florida-LA noir. I didn’t remember it very well and it was a blast to revisit.\n\nThe Reluctant Debutante (Minnelli, 1958)\n\nThis was one of the only Minnelli movies I hadn’t seen. I skipped it when I was doing my big watch-through because I found the beginning very abrasive with all the shrill British accents. Once the main conflict gets going and the shrill British people become the villains it’s very good. I’m glad I went back and watched it.\n\nThem! (Douglas, 1954)\n\nEh, it’s not as cool as a movie about giant ants should be.\n\nBarcelona (Stillman, 1994)\n\nThere are no comedies this smart anymore, not even by Whit Stillman.\n\nTwilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1&2 (Condon, 2011 and 2012)\n\nI am a Twilight fan. Mostly it’s ironic but I think these last two are genuinely good. The first one is amazing pregnancy horror. The second one is campier but the brutality of the first version of the ending is awesome.\n\nRole Models (Wain, 2008)\n\nOne of the best modern comedies. Angela hadn’t seen it so I made her watch it. It holds up beautifully.\n\nThe Red Shoes (Powell and Pressburger, 1948)\n\nI’m not a huge P and P fan (I think my favorite movie from the whole constellation is Powell’s Peeping Tom), but this is one of their better movies. There’s too much low key backstage drama for me. I prefer the hothouse melodramas of Vincente Minnelli.\n\nThe Decline of Western Civilization (Spheeris, 1981)\n\nInteresting documentary about the LA punk scene. I had no idea how racist a lot of that scene was.\n\nEveryone Says I Love You (Allen, 1996)\n\nThe Tim Roth-Drew Barrymore stuff is great. I hadn’t seen this in many years, and overall it holds up well.\n\nAll That Heaven Allows (Sirk 1955)\n\nNick Stang had us watch this at the same aesthetics conference where I made everyone watch Not Reconciled. His pick was a lot more of a crowd-pleaser. I’ve loved this movie for most of my life, but I still prefer Written on the Wind.\n\nShopping (Paul W.S. Anderson, 1994)\n\nGood, not great. I like Paul W.S. Anderson (certainly a lot better than the other Paul Anderson!), but I prefer his less British stuff.\n\nLiza (Ferreri, 1972)\n\nI like the premise: Marcello Mastroianni lives alone on an island with his dog. Catherine Deneuve rolls in and kills the dog and then tries to replace it by wearing a dog collar and crawling around on all fours and whatnot. But the execution is weak. I don’t know how a movie with this premise manages to be boring.\n\nI’ve watched every Lucio Fulci movie except for some of his early comedies over the last couple of months (indeed, I watched many of them twice), and I thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed it. I can’t get enough eyes getting stabbed, sinister cats, and awesome Fabio Frizzi music.\n\nYou can watch most of Fulci in English. Like most Italian films at the time, the audio was dubbed in post-production, and so both the Italian and English tracks are dubbed. The English often syncs better. I’ve noted the few Fulci films that I think should be watched in Italian.\n\nPSA: at least when I wrote this, most of the Fulci on Amazon was in the wrong aspect ratio and in bad quality. Shudder is better.\n\n34) Silver Saddle (1978)\n\nThis and Door to Silence are the only Fulci movies that can be described as “tame.” There are a few moments of inspiration, but not enough to overcome the annoying child factor.\n\n33) The Sweet House of Horrors (1989)\n\nThis and House of Clocks are two haunted house movies that Fulci made for a TV series that never aired because it was too gory. There are a few fantastic things in this movie but the production quality is abysmal and the kids are super, super annoying.\n\n32) Door to Silence (1991)\n\nGreat premise: business man gets stuck in traffic by a funeral procession… but is it his own funeral? The New Orleans setting is vivid. But again the production quality is terrible and this is ultimately toothless.\n\n31) Touch of Death (1988)\n\nLate horror-comedy. It’s suitably nasty and the high points are high but it’s very repetitive.\n\n30) Sodoma’s Ghost (1988)\n\nHaunted house movie where a group of Nazis are killed by a bombing in the middle of an orgy and then haunt a group of teenagers many years later. It’s pretty bad but it’s so perverse and bonkers that I give it a marginal thumbs up.\n\n29) My Sister in Law [aka La Pretora] (1976)\n\nOne of the two Fulci comedies I watched. This one is a fairly raunchy sex comedy starring 70’s genre icon Edvige Fenech. The premise is great: she plays an imperious magistrate who is about to send a crooked businessman to jail for selling dog food as goulash. But she has an identical twin sister who works as a prostitute, and the businessman and his conspirators hire the twin sister to engage in all sorts of indecent activities to ruin the judge’s reputation and force her off the bench before she can hand down a sentence. Things do not go as planned. It has tedious stretches but overall I enjoyed it.\n\n28) The House of Clocks (1989)\n\nThe other made for TV haunted house movie that was too gory to actually air. This one also has pretty lousy production quality but it’s so insane that it’s overall appealing. An old couple live in a house full of clocks. A gang of home invaders murders them. The clocks start running backwards and the home invaders get stuck in a time loop (the rules of which are incomprehensible) where they are terrorized by the couple they killed.\n\n27) The Eroticist [aka The Senator Likes Women] (1972)\n\nThe other comedy I watched. This is about a senator who tries to be chaste but who experiences an uncontrollable compulsion to grab every ass he sees (heads of state, nuns, priests, doctors, etc.). There’s a lot of material digging at the Catholic church where they try to manipulate the senator for their own nefarious purposes. This is about 20 minutes too long and the papal-political machinations grow tiresome, but the high points here are incredible (particularly the dream sequence).\n\n26) New Gladiators [aka Warriors of the Year 2072] (1984)\n\nThis was an attempt to capitalize on the success of Escape from New York and Mad Max in the Italian Exploitation milieu. It is completely batshit. The action scenes are incomprehensible and the movie drags for stretches, but there are enough insane Fulci touches to sustain interest. Like, there’s a scene where they meet the designer of a supercomputer. It could have been a pretty mundane scene but instead it’s like “MY MACHINE HAS A SOUL!!!!”\n\n25) Challenge to White Fang (aka The Return of White Fang) (1974)\n\nEverything from here on up I really like. This sequel doesn’t stand up to the first one but it is a delight in its own right. Fulci turned White Fang into a fusion of a Spaghetti Western and family animal drama. The great Franco Nero plays the Man With No Name/Jack London figure. This one doesn’t have quite as good a story or supporting cast as the first one but there’s a dog vs. eagle battle and lots of other delightful touches.\n\n24) Voices from Beyond (1991)\n\nDelightful late effort featuring one of Fulci’s craziest dream sequences. This is about an asshole patriarch who is murdered in a manner that makes his death appear to be due to natural causes. But he is able to telepathically communicate with his daughter from beyond the grave and he leads her to investigate his murder.\n\n23) Zombie 3 (1988)\n\nThis is a total mess, and that’s the whole point. Fulci was unable to finish this and it was completed by genre madmen Bruno Mattei and Claudio Fragasso. A zombie supervirus escapes from a military testing facility after a terrorist attack and infects an entire flock of birds. Mayhem ensues.\n\n22) Demonia (1990)\n\nFulci does nunsploitation! An archaeologist has wild visions of an orgy cult of nun witches and is drawn to the ruins of a monastery where a group of nuns was crucified 500 years earlier. One of his better late efforts.\n\n21) Aenigma (1987)\n\nVery campy mean girls 80’s boarding school horror. The popular kids play a cruel practical joke on the outcast daughter of the school’s cleaning lady, which leaves her in a coma. She telepathically murders them one by one. Tons of snails.\n\n20) A Cat in the Brain (1990)\n\nFulci’s 8 1/2. For Fulci fans only, and I recommend watching it only after seeing most of his horror films. He plays himself, driven mad by his own perverse imagination as he works on the films Sodoma’s Ghost and Touch of Death. He visits a therapist, who turns out to be a crazed murderer who frames Fulci for his own crimes. Fulci’s sense of reality breaks down and he’s not sure what’s real and what he’s imagining. The ending is oddly heartwarming if you love the man– it feels like a warm goodbye from the Godfather of Gore. Watch this one in Italian.\n\n19) Murder-Rock: Dancing Death [aka Slashdance, aka Murder Rock] (1984)\n\nCampy 80’s ballet school giallo where the nicest slasher ever painlessly kills their victims with a hairpin after knocking them out. Fulci was forced to turn this into a musical to capitalize on the success of Flashdance, and the result is delightful.\n\n18) Massacre Time [aka The Brute and the Beast] (1966)\n\nThe earliest Fulci film of broad interest. This is an excellent Spaghetti Western starring Franco Nero and George Hilton. The script is by Fernando Di Leo, who wrote the first two parts of Sergio Leone’s Dollars Trilogy, and his voice shines through clearly. This feels like a meaner, nastier, more lurid Fistful of Dollars. Highly recommended both to Fulci fans and Spaghetti Western connoisseurs. I recommend watching this one in Italian with subtitles (as for most Franco Nero movies, though I prefer the English dub for White Fang and its sequel).\n\n17) White Fang (1973)\n\nThis is totally excellent. Franco Nero plays a Jack London figure named Jason Scott who visits Dawson City in the Yukon during the Gold Rush. The sublimely creepy John Steiner plays the town’s resident robber baron, Beauty Smith. He bleeds the miners dry with the cooperation of a debauched priest played by the legendary Fernando Rey. Nero takes the side of an Eskimo family wronged by Beauty Smith and we get a classic Spaghetti Western war between the corrupt local power-brokers and the mysterious stranger. The twist is that he’s aided along the way by White Fang, and the movie is about 30% sentimental animal drama. I love it.\n\n16) One on Top of the Other [aka Perversion Story] (1969)\n\nFulci’s exploitation revision of Vertigo, starring Jean Sorel and genre icon Marisa Mel. In this version, the Kim Novak character (played by Mel) is an exotic dancer and prostitute. This and De Palma’s Obsession are the two great ultra-lurid Vertigo homages.\n\n15) The Black Cat (1981)\n\nVery fun Poe riff with some giallo trappings. It’s not really a giallo, because we know all along that the killer is the cat, but there is a mystery about what the hell is up with this cat and its creepy psychic owner (played by Patrick Magee, who you’ll remember as the unfortunate writer from A Clockwork Orange).\n\n14) Beatrice Cenci [aka The Conspiracy of Torture] (1969)\n\nFulci does… um… historical drama. Beatrice Cenci was a real historical figure, famous for her bizarre murder trial. Fulci of course focuses on all the nastiest bits. The narrative is fractured and non-linear, with brilliant editing, and this film represents a big leap in the development of his style. I watched this in Italian and liked it that way. I’m not sure if an English dub exists.\n\n13) Manhattan Baby [aka Eye of the Evil Dead] (1982)\n\nThis one doesn’t have as much gore and it wasn’t as immediately appealing to me, but once I watched it a second time I realized how insane it is. An archaeologist enrages some spirits by defiling an Egyptian tomb, and his daughter is given an evil magical talisman by a blind woman in the market and brings it back to the USA with her. The vengeance of dark forces ensues.\n\n12) The New York Ripper (1982)\n\nThis is Fulci’s second sleaziest movie, after The Devil’s Honey. It’s a slasher flick set in grimy pre-Giuliani New York City. This is pretty gruesome, but it has a core of angry feminism: every single man in this movie is a disgusting creep, and the film’s horror is drawn from the inescapable terror of being a woman in a world full of men. The killer talks like Donald Duck (!).\n\n11) Contraband [aka The Smuggler] (1980)\n\nFulci’s one poliziotteschi, and it’s a doozy. Four words: sulfur pit knife fight. This is a super mean and nasty movie. I recommend watching it in Italian with subtitles. The overall quality of the English audio track is a little better but the voice acting on the English dub is just terrible, and it takes away from how badass this thing is.\n\n10) The House by the Cemetery (1981)\n\nMy least favorite of the Gates of Hell trilogy, but still amazing. Dr. Norman Boyle takes his family to live in an extremely creepy old mansion in New England. As others have pointed out, what makes this special among haunted house movies is that there’s nothing forcing them to stay there except Norman’s arrogant male confidence that he’s got it all under control. This is full of terrifying omens and crazy Fulci editing.\n\n9) Four of the Apocalypse (1975)\n\nThe most bizarre Spaghetti Western I’ve ever seen. Fabio Testi stars. An oddball group of four prisoners in a small town jail are sent packing. They are given peyote by sadistic bandit Chaco (Tomas Milian!), which does not go well. They end up hiding out in a ghost town and things just get nuts.\n\n8) The Devil’s Honey (1986)\n\nSoftcore exploitation mayhem. You’ve got a saxophone player with an unhealthy dom-sub relationship with sultry Jessica. He dies. She blames his doctor, who she terrorizes, with the result that she finally becomes the dominant one. This is at the far extreme of sleaze in Fulci’s filmography, and it’s a blast. I liked the Italian audio track much better than the English dubbing but the subs I had were just a transcription of the English dub, so they didn’t always sync up with the Italian. When I watch it again I’m going to look for better subs.\n\n7) Don’t Torture a Duckling (1972)\n\nExcellent giallo about a series of child murders in a small village. Great cast includes Florinda Bolkan as a crazed witch and Barbara Bouchet as a rich girl from Milan lying low after a scandal. Bouchet teams up with a journalist to investigate the killings. This and the next two are Fulci’s three great classic gialli. They’re all high points of the genre.\n\n6) The Psychic [aka Seven Notes in Black] (1977)\n\nThe only Fulci movie I would describe as “classy.” This is a very tight giallo with a strong narrative and relatively minimal luridness. A psychic has visions of a murder in a country villa owned by her husband. She finds a corpse in the wall, and her wealthy businessman husband is arrested. She teams up with a paranormal researcher to try to exonerate him. Things get twisty. All of Fabio Frizzi’s Fulci scores are great, but his work here is particularly memorable.\n\n5) A Lizard in a Woman’s Skin (1971)\n\nMy favorite Fulci giallo (though I must say it was a difficult choice). Well-behaved rich wife of a philandering lawyer has kinky dreams about her hard-partying neighbor Julia. She dreams about murdering Julia, who is indeed murdered, and she investigates the mystery while fearing that she may in fact be the murderer. Lurid, twisty, and perfect.\n\n4) City of the Living Dead (1980)\n\nPart of the Gates of Hell trilogy. The suicide of a priest opens up a gate to hell in a small town. A psychic makes contact with the priest during a seance and suddenly dies, but then returns from the dead. She seeks out the small town along with a journalist, and all sorts of mayhem ensues. This is full-on Fulci madness, with batshit editing and production design.\n\n3) Zombie [aka Zombi 2] (1979)\n\nThe titling is a little confusing: there’s a Zombi 2 and a Zombi 3, but there’s no Zombi by Fulci. Zombie is the American title of Zombi 2. It’s called Zombi 2 because it’s an unofficial sequel to George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead (itself a sequel to Night of the Living Dead), which was released in Italy as Zombi. This gory monstrosity connects the Romero universe with the original zombie masterpiece, Jacques Tourneur’s I Walked with a Zombie. The roots of the zombie apocalypse are traced back to the transgressions of colonialism, which is vastly more interesting than the sort of sci fi explanation we often get in crappy zombie movies nowadays. This movie famously features the most incredible shark vs. zombie confrontation of all time.\n\n2) Conquest (1983)\n\nOne of my great regrets in life is that I did not discover this as a kid. This sword & sorcery flick was an attempt to capitalize on the success of Conan the Barbarian, but Fulci took it to an unsurpassed level of visionary madness. The entire film is shot through an aggressively foggy lens filter, and then he pumped as much fog as he possibly could into every scene. The result is like peering into another dimension. Handsome young adventurer Illias is given a magic bow by the god Cronos, which it turns out is the only weapon that can kill the evil witch Ocron. Ocron sends her army of werewolves to retrieve the bow, promising that she will take away the sun for all time. Illias teams up with an older misanthropic loner played by Jorge Rivero, and their relationship simmers with delightful homoerotic subtext. Things just get more and more insane from there as Ocron redoubles her efforts and performs all sorts of pagan rituals.\n\n1) The Beyond (1981)\n\nThe greatest entry in the Gates of Hell trilogy, this is the apocalypse distilled down to 87 minutes of cinematic doom. The finale of The Beyond is arguably the most insane, abstract stretch of film in the entire horror genre. Roger Ebert wrote a famously vitriolic negative review of this, where he reveals exactly who The Beyond is not meant for: fuddy-duddies who think that narrative continuity matters and horror dialogue should aim to imitate generic prestige pictures. No, sir, you will not find much narrative continuity or MFA dialogue in The Beyond. What you will find is buckets of gore, virtuoso editing, and one of the greatest horror scores of all time.\n\nFeatured image from The Pirate\n\nAlongside the May ’68 viewing project I posted about last week, I mostly went for very different sorts of movies that would function as palette cleansers amidst all the political radicalism. I watched a ton of Vincente Minnelli (classic Hollywood) and Hideo Gosha (Japanese genre fare) along with an assortment of other random stuff.\n\nFavorites are highlighted in bold.\n\nVincente Minnelli\n\nDuring the last year, I watched Minnelli’s classic musicals Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) and The Band Wagon (1953) and was completely blown away by them. I consider both to be among the very best American musicals. I had only seen a handful of Minnelli movies before and I resolved to do a deep dive into his filmography sometime in the near future. When I heard that Time Warner was putting the Warner Bros archive on Filmstruck, my first thought was “oooooooh I bet there’s gonna be a boatload of Minnelli.” Sure enough, just a few weeks later I logged in to find a 25 film Minnelli feature (I try to avoid reading what’s coming soon on Filmstruck so that I can enjoy the surprise when I log in). I had lots of plans for other things I wanted to watch, but I suspended most of them and dove in. Aside from Meet Me in St. Louis and The Band Wagon, I watched every movie in the feature except one. That one was The Reluctant Debutante, which I tried twice and could not get into (too many squealing British ladies). I’ll go back and watch it if I get to the point where I’ve seen every single other Minnelli movie (I think I have maybe 4-5 others left depending on whether you count titles that he only directed part of). I’m going to give at least a brief comment on every title:\n\nCabin in the Sky (1943)\n\nMusical about a murdered sinner who gets a chance to return to Earth and reform himself, with an all-black cast and Busby Berkeley choreography. There’s a delightful appearance from Louis Armstrong and a big number with Duke Ellington and his Orchestra. It’s very good but not great.\n\nThe Clock (1945)\n\nMuch better than I thought it would be. It’s a sort of WWII Before Sunrise, where Robert Walker has 48 hours before shipping off and randomly meets Judy Garland in Penn Station. They have a whirlwind romance but accidentally get separated and need to figure out how to find each other. The energetic, stylized direction elevates the material, and Garland’s performance (her first without song and dance) is excellent.\n\nYolanda and the Thief (1945)\n\nThis one wasn’t on Filmstruck. Lucille Bremer plays a naïve heiress, fresh from the convent, while Fred Astaire plays a charming con man who poses as her guardian angel as a ruse to relieve her of her fortune (but eventually falls for her). I was shocked to learn that this was a huge flop, but now that I’ve thought about it more, I’m not so surprised. There’s a 16 minute surrealistic dance number where some of the dancing is in a different meter than the music. This movie was just too far outside the box at a time when audiences had fairly rigid expectations for musicals. Highly recommended.\n\nThe Pirate (1948)\n\nI love it, I love it, I love it. Judy Garland plays a sheltered young woman living in the Caribbean who fantasizes about being swept away by the legendary pirate Mack “the Black” Macoco. Against her will, her parents arrange her marriage to the repellent town mayor. Meanwhile, a traveling circus comes to town featuring Gene Kelly as a womanizing circus leader/hypnotist. He discovers Garland’s fantasy and launches a ploy to pose as the pirate of her dreams. Hijinks ensue. I haven’t investigated this suspicion but I have the sense that Renoir’s 50’s work was highly influenced by Minnelli. I see the influence of Meet Me in St. Louis in The River and the influence of The Pirate in The Golden Coach.\n\nMadame Bovary (1949)\n\nNot the most faithful Bovary adaptation, but entertaining as a Hollywood melodrama with Emma Bovary as a sort of femme fatale. The film ran up against the Hays Code, which Minnelli addressed head on with an obscenity trial framing device. This might have been intolerable, but Flaubert is played by James Mason, and I could enjoy listening to James Mason read instruction manuals.\n\nFather of the Bride (1950), Father’s Little Dividend (1951)\n\nEh, I’ve seen these more than once before and they have a great cast (Spencer Tracy, Joan Bennett, Elizabeth Taylor) but they’re pretty forgettable in the context of Minnelli’s filmography, which is full of much finer treasures.\n\nAn American in Paris (1951)\n\nAn old favorite, with Gene Kelly as an American GI turned bohemian painter living in Paris and introducing ballerina Leslie Caron as the leading lady. Kelly’s dance choreography and Gershwin’s music are immensely pleasant, but the parts are greater than the whole and I would rank this solidly behind The Band Wagon.\n\nThe Bad and the Beautiful (1952)\n\nPeak Lana Turner! Along with Two Weeks in Another Town, part of a pair of fantastic films Minnelli made with Kirk Douglas about making movies. Here Douglas plays a gifted movie producer (often taken to be a hybrid of David O. Selznick and Val Lewton) who gets closely involved with the creative aspects of his films but alienates everyone he’s close to and ruins his career. The movie looks back over his life when he asks a director, an actress, and a writer from his past to collaborate on a comeback project. Each of them tells the story of their relationship with Douglas’ character. They all claim he ruined their lives, but their stories reveal that they actually owe their current success to him. Lana Turner losing it in the car is all time.\n\nThe Story of Three Loves (1953)\n\nFor an anthology film, this is frickin’ awesome. There’s a ridiculous ocean liner framing device and then three romance stories. The first is just incredible. James Mason plays an imperious ballet director and ballerina Moira Shearer (in one of her few film performances) plays a would-be professional dancer with a heart condition. You can probably imagine what happens (Rite of Spring-esque); it’s beautiful and heartbreaking and Mason and Shearer are so, so good. The second segment is the weakest of the three. It’s a really creepy antecedent to Big, with Ethel Barrymore stealing the show as a witch who turns a young Ricky Nelson into Farley Granger, who then proceeds to romance his governess (Leslie Caron). The third story stars Kirk Douglas in perhaps the most harrowing existential trapeze thriller of all time. Death drive, Holocaust trauma, no net. It’s really tremendous.\n\nThe Long, Long Trailer (1954)\n\nI wasn’t sure I wanted to watch this Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz vehicle, but my concerns were entirely misplaced. It’s hilarious from start to finish. Basically, wife persuades her husband to buy an obscenely oversized mobile home and hijinks ensue.\n\nBrigadoon (1954)\n\nLovely Gene Kelly-Cyd Charisse musical (co-starring an excellent Van Johnson) about a mystical town in the Scottish highlands that appears only one day every hundred years. The premise strains suspension of disbelief but it works as a metaphor for the longing to stay in a magical movie world after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe Cobweb (1955)\n\nMental hospital melodrama where the McGuffin is drapes. Many of the characters become embroiled in a conflict over who gets to pick the new drapes. It’s remarkable how much mileage is squeezed out of this conflict. The excellent ensemble cast includes Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Lillian Gish, Richard Widmark and Gloria Grahame. This movie has a cult following, though I personally didn’t like it as much as some of Minnelli’s other melodramas.\n\nLust for Life (1956)\n\nGoofy, ridiculous, entertaining van Gogh biopic starring a very over-the-top Kirk Douglas. Anthony Quinn plays Gauguin!\n\nTea and Sympathy (1956)\n\nThis is one of Minnelli’s finest films and possibly the best movie ever made about the way men are socialized. Deborah Kerr and John Kerr (no relation) star. The former brilliantly plays Laura, the wife of the headmaster of a boys’ school, while the latter plays Tom, a sensitive student. Tom is teased mercilessly by his peers and prodded to conform to gender expectations by the headmaster. Laura bonds with him and tries to protect and nurture him, and sexual chemistry develops between them. There is an unreconciled and extremely interesting tension between the subtextual implication that Tom’s character is gay and the forbidden heterosexual romance narrative.\n\nDesigning Woman (1957)\n\nThe worst Minnelli movie I’ve seen. Gregory Peck comes across as a poor man’s Cary Grant while Lauren Bacall does a halfway decent Katharine Hepburn. There is no chemistry whatsoever between them. The mean-spirited “punch drunk” jokes at the expense of a disabled character have not aged well.\n\nGigi (1958)\n\nGigi has not aged well either. Maurice Chevalier’s “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” musical number is unspeakably creepy. There are some redeeming moments but this is bottom-tier Minnelli for me.\n\nSome Came Running (1958)\n\nExcellent postwar melodrama (based on the James Jones novel), starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Shirley MacLaine. I recommend it heartily.\n\nHome from the Hill (1960)\n\nAnother Cinemascope melodrama, starring Eleanor Parker, George Hamilton, and a phenomenal Robert Mitchum. Mitchum plays a wealthy, philandering, brutish Texas patriarch who tries to make a man of his mollycoddled son. It’s sort of a cross between Tea and Sympathy and Written on the Wind.\n\nBells are Ringing (1960)\n\nMusical comedy starring Dean Martin and Judy Holliday. She works for an answering service; he’s a client and a struggling playwright; there’s a romance. I didn’t like it.\n\nFour Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1962)\n\nThis production was a disaster. Minnelli didn’t want to make the movie, and when he did agree to make it he wanted Alain Delon to star. He ended up instead with a terribly miscast Glenn Ford. Ingrid Thulin (who you may remember from many Ingmar Bergman movies) is quite good. It’s the story of a large, wealthy Argentinian family who are divided by WWII, as one son (with a German father) becomes a high-ranking Nazi official while the another (with a French father) reluctantly becomes a participant in the French Resistance. It’s overlong and a total mess, but it has redeeming qualities. Delon instead of Ford would have made a huge difference.\n\nTwo Weeks in Another Town (1962)\n\nThis is absolutely fantastic. I would have trouble picking my favorite Minnelli movie but it might be this. It’s also possibly the best movie about the death of old Hollywood (as seen from the inside). Kirk Douglas plays a washed up alcoholic movie star recovering in a mental hospital after losing his wife (Cyd Charisse), getting into a near-fatal accident, and having a breakdown. Edward G. Robinson (!) plays a philandering director past his prime who is reduced to making low budget dubbed Italian movies. Robinson and Douglas had a falling out when Robinson had an affair with Charisse, but Douglas is so desperate for a comeback that he jumps at an invitation to fly to Rome and appear in Robinson’s new movie. I don’t want to say any more about the story, but it is intense. One should definitely see The Bad and the Beautiful first. Also, NB, Godard’s Contempt was a response to this.\n\nThe Courtship of Eddie’s Father (1963)\n\nPart light comedy, part heavy melodrama about a widower with a young son. Glenn Ford is extremely good in this one, but child star Ron Howard is mostly intolerable (he has a couple good scenes), and I didn’t like Shirley Jones as the neighbor. Ultimately, I felt like the movie’s insistence on being a comedy ruined it. It would have been much better as a drama.\n\nHideo Gosha\n\nSword of the Beast (1965), Samurai Wolf (1966), Tenchu! (1969), Goyokin (1969), The Wolves (1971), Violent Streets (1974), Bandits vs. Samurai Squadron (1978), Hunter in the Dark (1979), Onimasa: A Japanese Godfather (1982), Death Shadows (1986), Heat Wave (1991)\n\nImage from Goyokin\n\nGosha was a Japanese genre maverick who has long been underappreciated in the west but has grown in esteem since his death. I watched his first film, Three Outlaw Samurai, a few months ago and I’ve owned a DVD of Sword of the Beast for ages, but I hadn’t seen any of his other work. It’s still pretty hard to access some of these titles, but a good number of them are on Filmstruck. All of these are either samurai or yakuza movies. Gosha’s samurai movies are very dark, and will seem particularly so to people who only know the genre through Kurosawa. They feature unsavory lead characters (outlaw samurai!) and slow buildups to quick, brutal bursts of violence. Gosha is a consummate stylist who bears comparison in some respects to Sergio Leone (and pulpier spaghetti western directors like Corbucci) and Brian De Palma. He’s less meta than De Palma but he has a similar ability to never waste a shot and to present lurid material with maximum impact.\n\nImage from Death Shadows\n\nTenchu! and Goyokin are his two most acclaimed movies. Goyokin is my favorite. It’s about a plot by a regional lord to steal a shipment of gold from the shogun, murder an entire fishing village, and frame them for the theft. A ronin (Tatsuya Nakadai) with a guilty conscience tries to prevent this injustice. It’s gorgeous, operatic and brutal– one of the best samurai movies. Tenchu! is also extremely good. It’s about a ronin (Shintaro Katsu, who often played Zatoichi) who is enlisted by a group of imperial loyalists as an assassin and warrior. He proves nearly invincible in combat and the group rises in power on his back. He is fiercely loyal to the group’s leader (Tatsuya Nakadai), despite warnings that he’ll be betrayed when it becomes convenient. My other favorite Gosha film is the Yakuza saga The Wolves. Set in the 30’s, a yakuza (Tatsuya Nakadai yet again) who had assassinated a rival boss is released from prison early. His crime family has reached an uneasy truce with the rival family whose boss he killed, putting him in a difficult position. Chaos eventually breaks out, and the narrative is full of exciting twists and turns. The last honorable men, a score to settle, an encroaching railroad: it shapes up like a yakuza Once Upon a Time in the West meets Carlito’s Way. It’s one of the best yakuza movies.\n\nImage from Onimasa\n\nAmong the other Gosha samurai titles, Sword of the Beast is a must see, while Bandits vs. Samurai Squadron offers many pleasures but also has an impossibly convoluted narrative. I enjoyed it more when I just gave up on the narrative and let it wash over me. It has a great cast (Jo Shishido!) and it’s full of Feuillade-esque touches like trap doors and secret compartments. Matt Lynch called it a samurai Ocean’s 11, which is apt. Hunter in the Dark is similar but with a far clearer narrative. Death Shadows is very good. It’s about criminals who are forced to become assassins to avoid execution. The daughter of one ends up becoming an assassin as well, and it becomes a rare female-centric samurai movie. There are crazy non-diegetic dance sequences and an amazing fight scene that integrates rhythmic gymnastics. Among the other Yakuza titles, Heat Wave is also female centric. It’s not great but it has a doozy of a finale. Violent Streets and Onimasa have some very disturbing content but both are worthwhile, especially the latter. It’s a saga taking place over 30 years, starring Tatsuya Nakadai yet again as the leader of a minor yakuza organization who maintains the delusion that he lives by the old code of chivalry. The film focuses a great deal on his two daughters (one adopted) and the struggles they endure living amidst the brutally sexist yakuza culture.\n\nJohn Frankenheimer\n\nThe Young Savages (1961), All Fall Down (1962), The Train (1964)\n\nImage from The Train\n\nI hadn’t seen any of these. They’re all worthwhile and feature virtuoso direction. The Train is tremendous. I loved it with my whole heart. Burt Lancaster plays a railroad worker and fighter in the French Resistance who tries to stymie a massive Nazi art theft during the final days of WWII. It’s incredibly thrilling throughout and delves intelligently into the question of whether the preservation of art can justify the loss of human life. All Fall Down is a total hoot. Warren Beatty plays a very bad seed named Berry-Berry. Karl Malden and an absolutely terrific Angela Lansbury play his fawning parents (combine this with Lansbury’s work in The Manchurian Candidate and you have the all time most cynical portrait of motherhood). No matter how bad he is, all they want to do is love him and sing his praises. And he is very, very bad. He begins a love affair with tender-hearted Eva Marie Saint, with tragic results. They say the name “Berry-Berry” like a thousand times.\n\nJean Renoir cont.\n\nWhirlpool of Fate (1925), La vie est à nous (1936)\n\nImage from Whirlpool of Fate\n\nI didn’t make much Renoir progress. I watched so many May ’68 movies that I didn’t feel like watching too many additional French movies on top of that project. Whirlpool of Fate is like a D.W. Griffith highlight reel with Hessling in place of Gish. It’s an immature work, but exhilarating and fun. La vie est à nous is a Popular Front propaganda film. Several directors (including Becker) contributed material while Renoir supervised. It has some great moments amidst the more banal material and is interesting to compare with the May ’68 stuff.\n\nTakashi Miike\n\nIchi the Killer (2001), For Love’s Sake (2012), As the Gods Will (2014)\n\nImage from As the Gods Will\n\nIchi on blu-ray! I hadn’t seen it for a very long time. It’s still one of the most fucked up things I’ve ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s extremely juvenile but not in a bad way. It’s definitely not for everyone (if you have an upper limit on graphic violence, stay away). For Love’s Sake is a high school musical. It’s much too long but it has some inspired moments. I loved As the Gods Will. Basically, there’s a sudden divine event where high school kids are forced to undertake a life-or-death real world video game where they pass through a series of puzzle levels and the survivors of each level move on. For instance, in one level they face a giant cat (pictured above) who wants to eat them. Miike nails the high school politics and the violence is inventive throughout. It’s one of the most successful attempts to make a movie with a video game structure.\n\nAndré Téchiné\n\nI Don’t Kiss (1991), My Favorite Season (1993)\n\nI know there was a point maybe 15 years ago when I watched a ton of Téchiné movies, but I can only remember like three or four of them. I’m not sure whether I had seen these or not. They’re both okay, but I didn’t love either of them. I Don’t Kiss is a clichéd story about a young man from the provinces who sets off for the big city and ends up becoming a prostitute. My Favorite Season (the better of the two) is a family drama starring Catherine Deneuve and Daniel Auteuil. It’s nuanced and of course the acting is very good.\n\nPhil Karlson\n\nThe Iroquois Trail (1950), Kansas City Confidential (1952), 99 River Street (1953), The Phenix City Story (1955)\n\nImage from 99 River Street\n\nPhil Karlson is a B-movie god! It’s awesome that so much of this stuff is showing up on streaming services (I watched these on Filmstruck; they’re gone now but some of them are on prime). Scorsese is a huge Karlson devotee and borrowed heavily from him, particularly in the way he films action. Kansas City Confidential and 99 River Street are my favorites. The former is a caper movie full of twists and turns while the latter is a boxing noir.\n\nBill Morrison\n\nThe Film of Her (1996), Decasia (2002), The Mesmerist (2003), Light is Calling (2004)\n\nImage from Decasia\n\nBill Morrison makes found footage movies from decaying nitrate films. I didn’t care for The Film of Her, but the others are awesome. Decasia is his magnum opus. It’s feature length and may be hard to take for some, but I really loved the music (original composition by Michael Gordon) and so it worked for me. If you struggle with abrasive music, you may want to start with Light is Calling and other shorts.\n\nSafari Classics\n\nMogambo (Ford, 1953), Hatari! (Hawks, 1962)\n\nImage from Hatari!\n\nI had never seen these. They’re both good, but I preferred Hatari! John Wayne leads a group that captures animals for zoos. A female wildlife photographer (Italian actress Elsa Martinelli) comes to camp and tries to change everyone’s ways. She encourages everyone to show greater compassion for the animals and ends up adopting a trio of baby elephants (which leads to some Hawksian screwball comedy). Hatari! is long and plodding, but that’s more of a feature than a bug. It’s not narrative driven: it’s more of an aimless sojourn at a safari camp, interspersed with thrilling, technically astonishing animal chases. Mogambo is a safari remake of Red Dust and focuses on a love triangle between Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, and Grace Kelly. Can’t go wrong with that cast.\n\nLate Chaplin\n\nA King in New York (1957), A Countess from Hong Kong (1967)\n\nI had seen Limelight but neither of Chaplin’s final two films. A King in New York is a very funny fish out of water comedy about an ousted monarch (played by Chaplin) who moves to New York and is sucked into the advertising business. Eventually it becomes a scathing indictment of McCarthyism (which Chaplin himself was a victim of). I enjoyed the jarring tonal shift. A Countess from Hong Kong was much maligned by critics at the time but Chaplin himself considered it his best film. From what I’ve read, it’s long had ardent defenders (notably Truffaut and Andrew Sarris) and has received favorable critical reappraisal during recent years. I think it’s a very fine film. Marlon Brando plays a wealthy diplomat while Sophia Loren plays a Russian countess living in exile in Hong Kong as a gangster’s mistress. She wants to flee to the west but has no travel documents, and so she stows away in Brando’s state room when he ships off. The effort to conceal her presence becomes comic (there is a lot of opening and closing doors) and a romance eventually develops. Taken as Chaplin’s swan song, it’s a very beautiful and moving film.\n\nStar Wars: Despecialized Original Trilogy\n\nI absolutely hate George Lucas’ special editions of the original trilogy. I won’t watch them, and so I hadn’t seen the films in a long time, because the philistine has refused to make the real versions available. I heard about the “Despecialized editions” a year or two ago: some tech savvy heroes put together the original cuts of the films in the proper aspect ratio along with 5.1 audio. I finally got around to watching them and it was glorious. What a gift. I liked the 1977 original film better than I remembered.\n\nFrank Henenlotter\n\nBasket Case (1982), Frankenhooker (1990)\n\nImage from Basket Case\n\nAwesome exploitation horror. I remember Basket Case from when I was a kid. I can still see the cover of the VHS on the horror shelf in the video rental store I grew up with. It’s aged like fine wine. I realize now that it’s a psychoanalytic inversion of Psycho. Frankenhooker is very fun as well, especially the supercrack scene, which is all time.\n\nBy the way, Basket Case is now part of the permanent collection of the MoMA!\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (Watts, 2017)\n\nI tried to watch this last year but I hated it so much that I didn’t finish it. A couple people I know who are more into MCU told me this is one of their favorite Marvel titles, so I tried it again. I hated it even more than I thought I would. First of all, the opening is terrible. Several minutes of shaky iphone footage (presented in iphone aspect ratio) reminding us of all the clever ways the MCU set this movie up? This easter egg bullshit and continuity for continuity’s sake is one of the things I dislike most about Marvel Studios. Second, the half-assed John Hughes highschool stuff is terrible. I was cringing at how bad it is. Third, the action scenes are terrible, especially compared to the Sam Raimi movies. It just becomes an animated movie when the action scenes start, and there is no sense of gravity. All of the wonder and most of the suspense is lost (compared with the constant feeling in the Raimi action scenes that Spider-Man is falling and catching himself). Fourth, the ending is terrible. I would have trouble naming an uglier, less appealing stretch of film.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (Russo bros, 2018)\n\nHell no. I hated it (not as much as Spider-Man, though).\n\nBlack Panther (Coogler, 2018)\n\nI did not like this. Michael B. Jordan is great (as always) but his Killmonger is the only three-dimensional character. My favorite part is the scene where he bests Black Panther in single combat. I had heard a lot about the cool peripheral characters but I found them disappointing. Awesome, the genius engineer character is a black woman… but she doesn’t get anything interesting to say or do. My biggest issue with the film is that the action scenes are generally illegible. I also found the production design to be overstuffed, as though they tried to cram a drum or an impala skin in every corner of every frame.\n\nGiven the progressive embrace of the film, I was surprised by how conservative it is. Not that there’s anything wrong with that—I can get down with some conservative filmmaking, as in the case of Clint Eastwood—but I am put off by the failure of most popular discourse to engage with the film’s politics beyond the most superficial level. Since I don’t relish the role of being the white guy who disliked Black Panther, I’ll close by linking the most interesting positive review I read, by K. Austin Collins: https://www.theringer.com/movies/2018/2/14/17011910/black-panther-film-review-marvel-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-chadwick-boseman\n\nNew releases\n\nThe Commuter (Collet-Sara, 2018)\n\nHell yes. Collet-Sara is the anti-Christopher Nolan (credit my brother for that phrase). We never have any idea where anything is in a Christopher Nolan movie. It’s all zoomed in confusion. Think back to the great chariot race in Ben-Hur. What’s the first thing William Wyler does? He takes us along for a slow trial lap around the race course, introduces us to all the players, and foreshadows obstacles the protagonist will face. This sort of clarity in action filmmaking is a dying art, and Collet-Sara is one of its greatest modern practitioners. Liam Neeson is supposed to find a person on a train but doesn’t know what they look like. The stakes are high. The first thing we do is walk all the way through the train not once, but twice. We meet every suspect, we get the whole layout, and we inspect all of the clues. (Compare Collet-Sara’s also great The Shallows and Non-Stop). This is like three “Liam Neeson is a secret badass” movies and an Agatha Christie novel all rolled into one.\n\nMolly’s Game (Sorkin, 2017)\n\nI hated this. Jessica Chastain is so bad! Aaron Sorkin directing his own material is a disaster. I can’t believe that no one stopped him from filming that ice rink scene with Kevin Costner. What a mess. On the plus side, Idris Elba is very good and gets to do an Al Pacino-style courtroom speech.\n\nThe 15:17 to Paris (Eastwood, 2018)\n\nI fucks with The 15:17 to Paris. It’s by far Eastwood’s weirdest movie. He reenacted the recent event when some American soldiers on vacation stopped a terrorist attack aboard a train from Amsterdam to Paris. He reenacted it WITH THE ACTUAL PEOPLE! They can’t act (of course) and the effect is extremely weird but also captivating. Eastwood goes full postmodernism at the age of 88! Thematically, the movie is most concerned with connections between American militarism and religiosity. It’s not as ambivalent and nuanced as American Sniper, but its weirdness is just so damn interesting.\n\nAnnihilation (Garland, 2018)\n\nPretty cool Tarkovsky-riff/psychedelic freakout. Taken as an attempted neo-Tarkovskian masterpiece, it fails, but taken as weird sci-fi horror, it succeeds. I liked Natalie Portman.\n\nManHunt (Woo, 2017)\n\nEh…. Certainly not John Woo’s best movie and I hated the unnecessary dubbing but it has some pleasures to offer for heroic bloodshed fans.\n\nRed Sparrow (Lawrence, 2018)\n\nOverlong, trashy spy movie with Jennifer Lawrence doing a bad Russian accent. It has its pleasures, but I wouldn’t go out of my way.\n\nPacific Rim: Uprising (DeKnight, 2018)\n\nSo many nights I’ve uttered aloud the wish “what I want right now is to see Pacific Rim for the first time, again.” I was excited about a sequel but worried about the change in director. It’s ultra-ultra-stupid and not good, but I don’t regret watching it.\n\nBeyond Skyline (O’Donnell, 2017)\n\nI watched this twice. It’s sooooooooo weird and more or less entirely successful relative to its low-budget, direct-to-video constraints.\n\nGame Night (Daley and Goldstein, 2018)\n\nDecent comedy rendition of The Game. One of the better recent comedies (a genre that’s really struggling).\n\nKidnap (Prieto, 2017)\n\nStraightforward kidnapping thriller with a whole lot of Halle Berry screaming in her car.\n\nJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (Kasdan, 2017)\n\nThe Rock plays a low-confidence nerd stuck in The Rock’s body. Jack Black plays a narcissistic teenage instagrammer stuck in Jack Black’s body. Interesting acting challenges, well met.\n\nFifty Shades Freed (Foley, 2017)\n\nI like these movies as camp. This one isn’t quite as ridiculous as the second one, but I enjoyed it.\n\nPaddington 2 (King, 2017)\n\nSeveral orders of magnitude better than the first one, which I hated. Hugh Grant is awesome but Brendan Gleeson steals the show.\n\nAmerican Honey (Arnold, 2016)\n\nThe whole thing about this movie is how long it is. It’s nearly three hours long, and there’s barely enough narrative for 90 minutes. For me, the length elevates the material. It presents the story of some hustler kids in middle America as a Great American Epic. I liked this a lot.\n\nThe Post (Spielberg, 2017)\n\nFun pop filmmaking, just don’t expect some great big insight.\n\nIt (Muschietti, 2017)\n\nEh, I liked the Goonies stuff but the CGI kind of ruined the horror for me.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nSpring, Summer, Fall, Winter… and Spring (Kim, 2003)\n\nOne of the biggest 21st century critical favorites that I hadn’t seen. I hated it! I would have trouble naming a heavier handed religious allegory. A Christian version of this would never fly, but because it’s Buddhism it’s cool? I thought the first vignette had some appeal, but by the time the second spring rolls around (surprise, the narrative cycle begins again) I felt nothing but contempt for this movie. Give me a break with all the pretty pictures of the house on the lake—this is the shallowest, most uninteresting sort of prettiness.\n\nYeelen (Souleymane Cissé, 1987)\n\nHell yes. This is the first film I’ve seen from Mali and from director Cissé. It’s about a young sorcerer on a quest to enlist the aid of his uncle in defeating his evil sorcerer father. Eat this, Lord of the Rings: never before has magic in film seemed more real to me. I completely love this.\n\nZorn’s Lemma (Frampton, 1970)\n\nI’ve never really been interested in experimental film but I’ve been evolving on that front and ticking off experimental classics like this one here and there. The first part of this movie runs through the alphabet rapidly, with pictures of words starting with each letter, and then starts substituting non-linguistic images. Some of the letters are skipped and one finds oneself trying to keep track of the order but drifting into confusion about what happened to a missing letter. I took it as a way of making apparent certain cognitive phenomena related to the way we process films. We are trying to focus on everything, but one thing distracts us and then we miss a couple of other things, and then perhaps miss other things while trying to retrieve what we missed. It makes me think of the brilliant split screen scene in De Palma’s Passion where he shows us the ballet Afternoon of a Faun on one side while showing us the pivotal murder on the other. Crucial information is right in front of us but we don’t see it because we’re watching the damn ballet. The second part of Zorn’s Lemma shows us some figures progressing across a snowscape while 6 female voices alternate reading one word per second of On Light, or the Ingression of Forms by Robert Grosseteste. It’s basically impossible to follow when read this way and one notices occasionally that the figures (who are moving very slowly) have made a leap of progress while one was trying to focus on following the narration.\n\nPerversion Story, aka One on Top of the Other (Fulci, 1969)\n\nUltra-lurid Fulci riff on Vertigo, it’s a very solid exploitation movie starring cult icon Marisa Mell.\n\nEaster Parade (Walters, 1948)\n\nFred Astaire-Judy Garland musical. I love both of them so much that I enjoyed this, even though it is a little Easter-forward for me.\n\nSingin’ in the Rain (1952)\n\nI’ve always loved it, though I admit it did lose a little bit of its luster by comparison to the Minnelli musicals (particularly The Band Wagon).\n\nRouge (Kwan, 1988)\n\nEthereal 80’s Hong Kong ghost story about a suicide pact gone awry.\n\nOcean’s 11 (Milestone, 1960)\n\nI had never seen the original Rat Pack Ocean’s 11. It is shockingly bad. It must have taken deliberate sabotage to overcome the natural charisma of the cast and make a movie this dull and drab.\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy (Alfredson, 2011)\n\nI saw this when it came out and was interested to revisit it. It’s aged well. Alfredson’s restrained direction suits the material nicely.\n\nSpy Game (Scott, 2001)\n\nThis is the last Tony Scott feature I hadn’t seen and I was not disappointed. He’s nearly at the height of his powers here, though he didn’t totally let loose until Man on Fire.\n\nCastle in the Sky (Miyazaki, 1986)\n\nSo good. One of Miyazaki’s best.\n\nDirty Dancing (Ardolino, 1987)\n\nGod, my dad made me watch this a million times as a kid, always reminding me that he visited a resort like this in the Catskills when he was growing up. Rewatching it with him 30 years later transported me right back to ‘88. He even reminded me about the resort again. This might be my most nostalgic movie. I remember gleefully dancing around the living room with my siblings but feeling embarrassed and a little tingly about Jennifer Grey in her bra. It’s a better movie than I thought it was, thanks largely to Swayze’s performance and the time warp 60’s-80’s weirdness. I didn’t realize when I was a kid that Swayze’s character and most of the music is clearly from the 80’s, and it’s just thrown into the 60’s setting without explanation.\n\nWelcome to L.A. (Alan Rudolph, 1976)\n\nI am planning to do an Alan Rudolph deep dive ASAP. I’ve seen a number of his films over the years and I’ve liked them all, but I’ve never approached his body of work in a systematic way. This was his first feature (after an apprenticeship as assistant director to Robert Altman). It’s extremely good, and I expect it will benefit from multiple viewings. Basically, Keith Carradine plays the son of a millionaire. He’s an itinerant songwriter who comes back to LA and has sex with everyone. It includes lots of wonderfully weird little performances, including Geraldine Chaplin as a housewife addicted to taxi rides and Sissy Spacek as a topless housekeeper. The excellent Robert Baskin score plays throughout the movie and gives the proceedings a sense of gravity (as a study of loneliness and alienation).\n\nThe Magic Flute (Bergman, 1975)\n\nMeh, I love Mozart’s opera but this production and Bergman’s presentation of it didn’t do anything for me.\n\nAngel Face (Preminger, 1952)\n\nFreudian noir with Robert Mitchum and Jean Simmons. It’s very unconventional and full of hallucinatory compositions. Godard thought this was one of the best American movies.\n\nSpeed Racer (Wachowskis, 2008)\n\nIt’s hard to believe that Speed Racer was a critical and commercial failure when it came out 10 years ago. I think of it as a modern cult classic (I was on board from day 1) and I don’t think I’ve ever talked to anyone who doesn’t love it. When it showed up on Netflix recently I watched it twice and enjoyed it tremendously. It’s an awful shame that the Wachowski fever dream of how to integrate computer animation and live action hasn’t caught on, as this is exponentially better than most of the multiplex CGI junk we’ve seen since.\n\nPollock (Harris, 2000)\n\nI watched this with my aesthetics class. I got a kick out of Jeffrey Tambor as Clement Greenberg. Ed Harris’ understanding of alcoholism elevates this, but at the end of the day it’s a fairly ordinary biopic.\n\nThe Mad Monk (To, 1993)\n\nEarly To from when he worked as a hired hand for the Shaw Bros. This collaboration with Stephen Chow is a total mess and easily the worst To movie I’ve seen. I took a little bit of a break from the To filmography but I’m looking forward to getting back into it.\n\nDirty Ho (Lau, 1979)\n\nExcellent martial arts comedy from the great Lau Kar-leung. I generally prefer more serious wuxia over the goofier stuff, but this one is undeniable. The action choreography is jaw-dropping, especially towards the end when Gordon Liu and Wong Yue start fighting in unison.\n\nBangkok Dangerous (Phat and Chung, 2008)\n\nSuper fun Nic Cage hitman thriller. High Cage factor, some great action sequences, and a hefty dose of darkness and cynicism.\n\nTelevision update\n\nLegion\n\nKind of jumped the shark? I was really excited for this season and I liked the first half, but the second half (up till the finale) lost me. The Don Draper pseudo-philosophical narration worked fine in small doses but they pushed it past the breaking point and at times it became unbearable (the Plato’s cave as a smug anti-smartphone lecture was the point where I admitted to myself that the show was getting bad). The last episode was good, however, and I think there’s still a chance for Legion to redeem itself.\n\nThe Americans\n\nI wasn’t as excited for The Americans final season because I thought I knew how it was going to end. Boy, was I wrong. I will avoid spoilers here but I’ll just say that this is one of the best endings ever for a TV show. For me the only thing that clearly beats it is The Sopranos.\n\nTokyo Vampire Hotel (Sono, 2017)\n\nYes, that’s a vampire Last Supper.\n\nNot for everyone, but I devoured this. It is a crazy 7-hour mashup of the last 10 years of Sono’s career with Emir Kusturica, M. Knight Shyamalan, Scarface, and so many other things. The tone is jarringly uneven (by design) and the narrative is a total mess, but if you are into this kind of thing this won’t be a problem for you. Expect a lot of vampire gore up front, this comes out firing.\n\nBillions\n\nThis Billions season was awesome! The ortolan eating episode was something I’ve always longed to see (the ortolan is one of my favorite examples to support the idea that a negative moral valence can play a positive aesthetic role). Another high point is John Malkovich as a Russian oil oligarch/gangster (reprising aspects of his performance from Rounders). Also, Clancy Brown is amazing as Attorney General Jock Jeffcoat, who is an even more racist, hyper-masculine vision of Jeff Sessions as a Texan. The ending sets up a Season 4 that I can’t wait to get my hands on.\n\nFeatured image from Regular Lovers.\n\nI’ve watched more movies than usual the last couple of months, so this film diary installment was feeling pretty unwieldy. I decided to split it into two parts. I am devoting this post to the deep dive I’ve done into May ’68 cinema the last six weeks. In a few days I’ll post again with all the other stuff I’ve watched since early April (spoiler: so much Vincente Minnelli).\n\nThe events of May ’68 were momentous for French cinema. In honor of the 50th anniversary, I decided to undertake a survey. Before getting into it, some context:\n\nIn 1967, the first workers’ strikes in France since the 30’s took place, and there was a nationwide wave of unionization. At the same time, there was a climactic surge in leftist politics among students. The unions were primarily concerned to increase workers’ wages and quality of life, and they formed an alliance with the PCF (French Communist Party). The student activists included a mix of revolutionary Trotskyists, Maoists, and anarchists who had far more radical goals than the PCF, which favored incremental improvements for workers and an electoral path to power. For a brief moment in May ’68, students and workers staged massive demonstrations together and occupied factories all over France. Violent police responses to initial student demonstrations prompted sympathy from more moderate contingents who then joined into the fray, resulting in a remarkable display of anti-establishment unity. It was enough to shut down the government and national economy and force President de Gaulle to flee Paris. To many, it seemed like the revolution had really come. But it hadn’t. The etiology of the uprising’s collapse is controversial, but the government offered a substantial minimum wage increase and other concessions to unions while threatening military intervention, and the workers gradually gave up the strike and returned to work. The leftist contingents blamed the PCF (who they decried as Stalinists) for caving too readily and fracturing the movement, while the PCF blamed the leftists for unrealistic aims and violent methods that undermined public sympathy. Ultimately, the centrists consolidated power, but many workers did see appreciable improvements in their quality of life. Perhaps most significantly, the cultural and sexual revolutions of the time succeeded in transforming France where the attempted political revolution failed.\n\nOn to the movies. I included films that were made in the ’68 milieu by participants in the uprising, films that were made in years following ’68 documenting and critiquing the aftermath, and films that were made many later years looking back on the time period. I think the best films directly about May ’68 and its aftermath are Garrel’s Regular Lovers, Eustache’s The Mother and the Whore, Godard’s Tout va bien, and Rivette’s Out 1 (which I did not rewatch, though I hope to when I get the chance). It’s broader in scope, but Chris Marker’s A Grin Without a Cat is also fantastic and essential. The worst May ’68 film for me is Bertolucci’s The Dreamers. I hate it. I also dislike Assayas’ Something in the Air, and I can’t stand Guy Debord, who made several relevant films and was a leading figure of the Situationist school of thought that was central for the student contingent of the movement.\n\nMy favorites are highlighted in bold\n\nZanzibar Productions\n\nZanzibar Productions is ground zero for May ’68 cinema. It’s a great story: painter Olivier Mosset spent a year at Warhol’s Factory and came back to France with the idea that artists working in different media should experiment with film. Around that time, Éric Rohmer’s La Collectionneuse brought together poet and critic Alain Jouffroy, sculptor Daniel Pommereulle, and editor Jackie Raynal. Together with Mosset and some other friends from the same underground scene, they started making films. Radicalized heiress Sylvina Boissonnas founded Zanzibar Productions and provided ample funding. Most of the films were made on expensive 35mm film with generous budgets. Pommereulle’s film Vite includes some extravagant shots of the moon filmed through a massive telescope in California (which Marlon Brando introduced him to!). Aside from those already mentioned, the Zanzibar group included Philippe Garrel, Patrick Deval, Étienne O’Leary, Serge Bard, Frédéric Pardo, Pierre Clémenti, Michel Fournier, Michel Auder, Caroline de Bendern, and Zouzou. Because the films didn’t need to make money, and because everyone was preoccupied with taking drugs, making art, and trying to overthrow the old social order, no one tried very hard to promote the films, and they were not screened widely. Many of them sat in a basement until they resurfaced in 2000 and were screened at the Cinémathèque Française. Sally Shafto brought attention to the group with her 2007 book The Zanzibar Films and the Dandies of May 1968, and many of the films are now available on DVD. A few Zanzibar films are still inaccessible; I watched everything I could get my hands on, including later films by members of the group.\n\nSome of these films are not overtly political. They are all rebellious, but in many cases the rebellion is against aesthetic norms. The most overtly political of the bunch is arguably Bard’s Destroy Yourselves. My favorite is probably Deval’s Acéphale. Without further ado, here’s a list of accessible titles with quick comments:\n\nPhilippe Garrel\n\nMarie pour mémoire (1967), Le révélateur (1968), The Virgin’s Bed (1969)\n\nImage from Le révélateur\n\nGarrel made four Zanzibar films. La Concentration, with Jean-Pierre Léaud and Zouzou, is nearly impossible to see. He was only 20 years old at the time, and these films manifest his immaturity, but they also highlight how remarkably talented he was from a young age. He went on to have by far the most illustrious career as a filmmaker of any member of the group. These early films attracted critical praise from Jacques Rivette, who aptly described his work as the offspring of Godard and Cocteau. Garrel later cited Rivette himself as a major influence. His other primary influences at this point in his career were Murnau and von Stroheim, and this is especially apparent in Le révélateur, which is probably the best-known Zanzibar film. It’s completely silent, filmed in striking high-contrast black and white, and contains some extraordinary images, but I find it heavy-handed. Marie pour mémoire is his first feature. It stars Zouzou and comprises a series of abstract, interconnected vignettes where young people struggle against various forms of authority. The Virgin’s Bed is my favorite of the three, and is the easiest to access at the moment (last I checked it’s still streaming on Amazon through the MUBI channel). Filmed mostly in Morocco, it features the inimitable Pierre Clémenti as Jesus and Zouzou as Mary Magdalene and reimagines the story of Christ in the late 60’s political milieu (with the counterculture as the saviors of humanity, of course). It has the same issues with immaturity as the other two but it seethes with the energy of the moment.\n\nJackie Raynal\n\nDeux fois (1968)\n\nRaynal’s film is a bold and fascinating experiment, and one of the most important Zanzibar films. It’s considered a groundbreaking work of feminist cinema. It announces the end of all meaning and then proceeds through a disconnected series of scenes that are repeated two or three times with slight differences. For instance, she repeats a scene three times where she goes into a store to buy a bar of soap. Once she speaks Spanish (the film was made in Barcelona), once she speaks French, and once she speaks a combination of the two.\n\nPatrick Deval\n\nHéraclite l’obscur (1967), Acéphale (1969)\n\nImage from Acéphale\n\nThe former is not an official an official Zanzibar title, but Deval went to Tunisia around the same time to film this poetic short about Heraclitus. It definitely rang my Greek Philosophy nerd bell. The latter, which takes its name from Bataille’s journal, is a surreal work of anarcho-primitivism. I love it.\n\nSerge Bard\n\nFun and Games for Everyone (1968), Ici et maintenant (1968), Destroy Yourselves (1969–though it was actually the first Zanzibar film produced)\n\nImage from Ici et maintenant\n\nDestroy Yourselves (from the phrase “help us, destroy yourselves,” scrawled on a campus wall) begins by announcing that it was made in April ’68. It’s boiling over with the energy that fueled the May uprising. Alain Jouffroy lecturing to a nearly empty classroom is iconic.\n\nThe other two Bard films are even more experimental. I can’t say I recommend Fun and Games for Everyone, which is an ultra-abrasive collage of images and sounds from an Olivier Mosset gallery opening. Ici et maintenant is mostly ravishing black and white seascapes. There’s also some far less interesting material with Caroline de Bendern and Mosset sitting around not doing much.\n\nPierre Clémenti\n\nLa révolution n’est qu’un début. Continuons le combat. (1968)\n\nI love this Clémenti stuff (more below). His one official Zanzibar title is an acid-drenched collage of 16mm footage of the May demonstrations, his friends doing drugs, and lots of other late 60’s imagery. As psychedelic collages go, Clémenti’s are top notch.\n\nFrédéric Pardo\n\nHome Movie: On the Set of Philippe Garrel’s ‘Le lit de la vierge’ (1968)\n\nThis is mostly made up of footage Pardo shot while the Zanzibar crew was in Morocco making The Virgin’s Bed. It would appear that he was having a sexual relationship with actress Tina Aumont, as there is a preponderance of intimate footage of her. That stuff is all fantastic, and there are some truly inspired passages, but I felt like the first half of this could have lost some weight.\n\nOlivier Mosset\n\nUn film porno\n\nIt’s a 3 minute Warhol-esque snippet with a good punchline.\n\nÉtienne O’Leary\n\nChromo sud (1968)\n\nThis is a rather terrifying experimental film with extremely rapid editing, dark imagery, and dissonant ambient music. I don’t think most people would enjoy watching it, but if you’re into this kind of thing….\n\nDaniel Pommereulle\n\nVite (1969)\n\nThis is a beautiful film. It features the above-mentioned shots of the moon through a fancy telescope, and much of the rest of it was shot in North Africa. The director and a young boy spit at the West and make defiant gestures. The exterior of the telescope is compared to a statue of an elephant and there are some shots of mountains, and that’s pretty much it, but it all comes together nicely.\n\nAlso:\n\nZanzibar (Raynal, 2005)\n\nShort documentary catching up with some of the Zanzibar crew many years later. You’ll find it interesting if and only if you are interested in these films. It’s pretty superficial but there are some nice tidbits and it’s cool to see everyone all grown up.\n\nPhilippe Garrel continued\n\nGarrel is for me one of the most interesting filmmakers of the last 50 years. I watched through most of his films over the last couple months. The only features I didn’t watch are La Concentration, which is inaccessible, and three of his 70’s experimental films with Nico (Le berceau de cristal, Un ange passe, and Le bleu des origines). I have access to the three 70’s films but in terrible VHS rips and a cell phone video someone shot of a theatrical showing. I can’t bring myself to watch these beautiful films in such terrible quality, but I inspected them and I’m especially eager to see a proper version of Le berceau de cristal. All four of the features I haven’t seen have screened theatrically in NYC over the last couple years, so it’s not hopeless.\n\nGarrel’s career can be roughly divided into three stages. His father, Maurice Garrel, was a successful actor and Philippe started making movies from a young age. First, from the 60’s up till the late 70’s he made non-narrative films that ranged from the political provocation of his Zanzibar work to the pure interiority of Les hautes solitudes. Starting with the 1979 transitional work L’enfant secret, he shifted towards autobiography. His work during from this point on reflects the strong influence of his friend Jean Eustache, particularly his iconic post-’68 film The Mother and the Whore. His autobiographical films are typically fairly abstract and generally have experimental narratives. He often casts his father as his father, his children as his children, and his lovers as his lovers. In one case he plays himself, but usually he casts another actor. His son Louis Garrel developed into an excellent actor, and later in his career Philippe often casts his son as a stand in for himself. For me, Garrel hit his peak in the 90’s, making a series of lyrical, Proustian autobiographical films. In 2005 he made his magnum opus Regular Lovers, which is his most direct later statement on May ’68. His middle period closed with 2009’s Frontier of the Dawn, the last of his many films addressing his relationship with Nico and its aftermath. Since then he’s continued to explore some of the same themes as during his middle period but his narratives have gotten more straightforward. He’s still working, and 2017’s Lover for a Day is great.\n\nGarrel is arguably the filmmaker who has most deeply and extensively explored May ’68. A common theme of his middle-period work is the defining role the event played in the lives of many of its participants. For Garrel, May represents an irretrievable nexus of hope and possibility that cast a lifelong shadow. The worst films about May (I’m looking at you, Bertolucci) look back on the time with shallow nostalgia. For Garrel, May is more like a ghost that haunted the revolutionaries and drove many to kill themselves (either directly or by means of heroin abuse). Eustache’s 1981 suicide looms large, as does Garrel’s own history of heroin abuse (which he and Nico fell into together during their ten year relationship).\n\nLes enfants désaccordés (1964)\n\nGarrel’s first film (he was 16), about young runaways who squat in an abandoned mansion.\n\nActua 1 (1968)\n\nShort newsreel documenting the May ’68 demonstrations.\n\nAnémone "
