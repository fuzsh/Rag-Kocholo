        "text": "1 INDEX OF THE TROELSTRA ARCHIVE Introduction This index was mainly prepared in 2000 <strong>and</strong> 2001. 1 <strong>The</strong> archive itself was stored at the Mathematical <strong>Institute</strong> of the University of Amsterdam, afterwards (2001) brought to the Rijksarchief in Noord-Holl<strong>and</strong>. <strong>The</strong> length of the archive is circa 2.5 meters. <strong>The</strong> material in the archive has been divided into a number of major categories, distinguished by capitals in the numbering of items, e.g. B (scientific correspondence), C (courses given by Troelstra, seminars <strong>and</strong> colloquia conducted by him), P (all materials relating to his publications) etc. Usually these major categories are again subdivided. <strong>The</strong> description of the contents is not carried out with the same amount of detail <strong>for</strong> each (sub-) category. A lot of material in this index was already set up by A.S. Troelstra himself (especially publications, lectures <strong>and</strong> congresses). P. van Ulsen, Amsterdam, 2001. Curriculum vitae of Anne Sjerp Troelstra 2 10-VIII-1939 Born at Maartensdijk (Utrecht), the Netherl<strong>and</strong>s. 1951-1957 Secondary school: Lorentz Lyceum (gymnasium beta), Eindhoven. 1-IX-1957 Enrollment as a student at the University of Amsterdam. 25-III-1964 Passed doctoraalexamen in Mathematics, cum laude. (At that time a bit more than a M.Sc.) 1-IV-1964 Appointed ‘wetenschappelijk medewerker’ (approximately, assistant professor) at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Amsterdam. 15-VI-1966 Doctorate (Ph.D) in mathematics on the thesis ‘Intuitionistic general topology’ (thesis adviser Prof. Dr. A. Heyting). University of Amsterdam. 1-IX-1966 till 1-IX-1967. On leave as a visiting scholar at Stan<strong>for</strong>d University (departments of Mathematics <strong>and</strong> Philosophy) with a stipend from the Netherl<strong>and</strong>s Organization <strong>for</strong> the Advancement of Research (then ZWO, now called NWO). VIII-1968 Gave a series of ten lectures on Intuitionism at the Summer School on Proof <strong>The</strong>ory <strong>and</strong> Intuitionism at SUNY, Buffalo, New York. 1-IX-1968 Appointed ‘lector’ (associate professor) in mathematics at the University of Amsterdam. 1-IX-1970 Appointed ‘gewoon hoogleraar’ (full professor) in pure mathematics <strong>and</strong> foundations of mathematics at the University of Amsterdam. 4-VI-1976 Elected member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences. 16-II-1996 Elected corresponding member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. 15-XI-1996 Received the F.L. Bauer–Prize of the ‘Bund der Freunde der Technischen Universität München’, <strong>for</strong> internationally outst<strong>and</strong>ing contributions to 1 <strong>The</strong> way Troelstra set up the Heyting Archive (now part of the Rijksarchief Noord-Holl<strong>and</strong> in Haarlem) <strong>and</strong> its index was a model <strong>for</strong> this archive <strong>and</strong> index. <strong>The</strong> Library of the Faculty of Sciences (Faculteit Natuurwetenschappen, Wiskunde en In<strong>for</strong>matica) of the University of Amsterdam, <strong>and</strong> especially the chief librarian H. Harmsen, gave me the opportunity to complete this index. 2 Data from the postscript file of A.S. Troelstra ( http://turing.wins.uva.nl/~anne/) . See also A.S. Troelstra, Looking back, ILLC magazine 2, (July 2000)."
