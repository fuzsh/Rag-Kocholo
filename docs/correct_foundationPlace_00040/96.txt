The City understands that to create a fully inclusive community, it is important to form strong bonds with community groups, and to be involved with initiatives that strive to meet our goals around accessibility, diversity, and inclusion.

Vancouver Foundation

In 1994, the City of Vancouver formed a partnership with the Vancouver Foundation. Both organizations contributed $50,000 to create an endowment fund totaling $100,000. Each year the endowment fund generates between $4,000 - $6,000. These funds are donated to initiatives that align with the City's goals around accessibility, diversity, and inclusion. In 2011, the endowment fund money went toward:

The International day of persons with disabilities
