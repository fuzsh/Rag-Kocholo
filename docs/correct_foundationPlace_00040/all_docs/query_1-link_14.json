        "text": "The ZacPac Project was created to help those most in need. We are currently working on our fourth edition of the ZacPac. We will assemble 2,400 ZacPacs on Friday, May 3rd and are looking for volunteers. Please email me at zacpacproject@gmail.com if you can help us pack. We will begin packing at 8:30 AM at Morrey Mazda, which has generously donated their space. The address is 818 Automall Drive.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe ZacPac Project's first initiative was a 20L dry bag filled with 12 essential items distributed through 30 different outreach organizations in Vancouver. Over $200,000 of cash and donations in kind were collected to generate 2200 ZacPacs, which benefited people experiencing homelessness. This project was initially launched in March 2020, before the COVID lockdowns.\n\nFor the second edition of the ZacPac, Zac increased the size of the dry bag from 20L to 30L to accommodate a waterproof sleeping bag. He created 3000 ZacPacs in 2022 that were distributed to the 3000 individuals experiencing homelessness based on the Metro Vancouver homeless count. In addition, Zac expanded his reach beyond his existing list of outreach recipients from 30 partners to over 40.\n\nThanks to earlier coverage from CTV National and Melanie Nagy, Zac received many requests from people across Canada to bring the ZacPac to their city. For the third edition of the ZacPac, Zac decided to expand to his hometown of Winnipeg. On June 20th, 2023, over 60 volunteers helped pack 1,200 ZacPacs in Winnipeg; each ZacPac included sleeping bags, socks, reusable water bottles, emergency blankets, rain ponchos, packaged food items, and a hygiene kit. The project's launch event was visited by then-Premier Heather Stefanson, Mayor Scott Gillingham, and Endhomelessness CEO Jason Whitford.\n\nThe ZacPac Project is under the umbrella of the Weinberg Foundation. Its charitable registration number is 86593 5589 RR0001, and it can provide tax receipts for donations of goods as long as an invoice is provided. The mailing address for the foundation is 300-1001 Corydon Ave. Winnipeg, MB. R3M 0B6.\n\nThanks in advance for considering the support of this project aimed at helping those experiencing homelessness in Canada.\n\nRead more:\n\nVisit @zacpacproject on Instagram\n\nhttps://www.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=2423871\n\nhttps://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/2023/06/20/onetime-winnipeg-youth-wont-sit-back-uses-big-heart-to-launch-bright-blue-zacpac-attack-to-help-citys-homeless\n\nhttps://globalnews.ca/video/9783168/project-building-packs-for-people-experiencing-homelessness-arrives-in-winnipeg"
