        "text": "Friday Squid Blogging: Calamari Ripieni Recipe\n\nNice and easy Calamari Ripieni recipe, along with general instructions on cooking squid:\n\nTenderizing squid is as simple as pounding it flat—if you’re going to turn it into a steak. Otherwise, depending on the size of the squid, you can simply trim off the tentacles and slice the squid body, or mantle, into rings that can be grilled, sautéed, breaded and fried, added to soup, added to salad or pasta, or marinated. You can also ­ as chef Accursio Lota of Solare does—stuff the squid with bread crumbs and aromatics and quickly bake it or grill it to serve with salad.\n\nAs usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.\n\nPosted on August 21, 2015 at 4:07 PM • 208 Comments\n\nSidebar photo of Bruce Schneier by Joe MacInnis."
