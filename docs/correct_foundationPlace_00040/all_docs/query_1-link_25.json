Participants in last year’s walk-a-thon raised a magnificent $80,030 and we hope you will join us for a fun-filled activity day in support of LGH.\n\nBECOME A MONTHLY DONOR\n\nTogether our monthly donors make a blooming big difference.\n\nYour recurring donations support the hospital’s most urgent areas across many different departments. Sign up once and receive a consolidated tax receipt in February for all the previous year’s donations.\n\nSupport the Lions Gate Hospital 50/50\n\nCongratulations to LGH staff member Darlene B., the winner of our Easter 50/50 Draw on March 28! Darlene has worked as an OR Nurse at LGH for more than 20 years. The total jackpot was $46,980 and Darlene took home a cheque for $23,490.\n\nStay tuned for our Spring draw starting on April 14, 2024!"
