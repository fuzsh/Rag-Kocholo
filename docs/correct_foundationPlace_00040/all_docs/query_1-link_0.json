        "text": "Vancouver Foundation works on the lands of Indigenous nations throughout colonial British Columbia. Our office is on the unceded, ancestral, and traditional territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Sel̓íl̓witulh (Tsleil-Waututh) peoples.\n\nVancouver Foundation is inspired by community and works to benefit community. We connect generous donors with the energy, time, and ideas of inspired people across British Columbia. Together, we’ve been making meaningful, lasting impacts by supporting charities in BC since 1943. Our goal is to harness the gifts of donations and other resources as well as the community’s wealth of ideas and energy to build a lasting legacy.\n\nWith Donor Advised Funds, you can establish a charitable endowment fund, receive a donation tax credit, and recommend grants over time. We provide you with our expertise and investment options, so you can leave a lasting impact.\n\nWhen you leave a gift to Vancouver Foundation in your will, you are planting a seed – a seed that, with careful tending, will grow into something for future generations to benefit from, ultimately leaving a gift that helps build a better world. That’s the power of a legacy donation.\n\nMemorial Funds are a way to honour and celebrate the memory of a loved one by donating to charity. This legacy gives friends and family an opportunity to pay tribute while helping your community for generations to come."
