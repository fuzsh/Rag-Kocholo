        "text": "Reaching Home: Canada’s Homelessness Strategy (RH) is a community-based program aimed at preventing and reducing homelessness across Canada. Reaching Home is funded by the Government of Canada and delivered by a local Community Entity.\n\nThe program directives can be found at Reaching Home: Canada’s Homelessness Strategy Directives.\n\nTo apply to the Reaching Home – Greater Vancouver Designated Community Capital Call for Proposals 2024-2026, please visit the Community Entity, Lu’ma BCH Native Housing Society.\n\nKey Information\n\nLooking for housing? Although the Reaching Home program does not provide housing directly, we have been receiving a number of questions from individuals and families economically impacted by COVID-19. We've compiled this Frequently Asked Questions document to help direct your inquiry.\n\nCommunity Entity\n\nLu’ma Native Housing Society, in partnership with Vancity Community Foundation, serves as the Community Entity (CE) for the designated community funding stream in the Greater Vancouver region.\n\nThe Community Entity (CE) Lu’ma and VCF work with the Community Advisory Board and various other partners to support service delivery and system coordination to address homelessness.\n\nCommunity Advisory Board\n\nMembers of the Community Advisory Board (CAB) give voice to the interests of the homeless population and to the homeless-serving community.\n\nThe CAB develops the Reaching Home community plan, which identifies funding priorities to respond to local needs. The plan is approved by the federal government and updated annually.\n\nThe CAB reviews and recommends projects based on Reaching Home directives, terms and conditions as well as community plan priorities. VCF as the Community Entity, with the guidance of Service Canada, works with the CAB during this process, answering program-related questions and ensuring a fair and transparent process. Once projects are approved, VCF supports project staff in achieving program investment and outcome targets.\n\nReaching Home Funded Projects\n\nSee the Greater Vancouver projects that have been funded by Reaching Home for 2022 to 2024.\n\nResources on Homelessness\n\nFind resources on homelessness including local homeless counts and housing first reports.\n\nContact"
