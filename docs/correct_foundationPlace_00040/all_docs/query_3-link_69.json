        "text": "Stablepoint is run by the original founders of UK hosting brands Tsohost and Vidahost, which we started as teenagers in our bedrooms in 2003. We ran those businesses until 2017, when they were acquired by GoDaddy and we were in our 30s with kids ourselves.\n\nBut hosting was in our blood. After a short break, we teamed up with Sal Patel, then running Speedydot Hosting, and decided to build a hosting company for the 2020s and beyond. Using our knowledge of what did and did not work, our aim was to create the perfect scalable hosting business - that remained personable and friendly even as it grew. We decided to take advantage of the latest technological advances such as public cloud, but also to build a brand that reflected our ethos and our honest and friendly approach.\n\nWe know that hosting is about much more than uptime and site speed. Even though your hosting bill may be a negligible part of your business spend, your website is maybe the most important tool your business has.\n\nThe main reasons customers come to Stablepoint is the fact that they trust us with their websites, not just because even our first line support have the technical experience to help with and understand complex issues, but because our technical support and management are relatable, approachable and understanding.\n\nEvery team member at Stablepoint has something we call the Stablepoint Passion. This means that they all have some key passion in their lives that has absolutely nothing to do with hosting, computers or the internet. Our team members include a famous rapper, an Olympic windsurfer, a professional drummer, a race car driver - we'll let you guess who!\n\nPictured: The Bali team at launch in November 2018\n\nYou might be surprised to hear that the majority of web hosting companies are owned by just three large corporations - GoDaddy, Endurance International and 1and1. When you scratch beneath the surface, you’ll find dozens of the “top” hosts are ultimately owned by these three corporates. A lack of competition means prices have been kept high (and rising), whilst client apathy to migrating means service is often lacklustre, as you are just a client number out of millions.\n\nConversely, smaller hosting startups work great for a certain amount of time, where enthusiastic owners are involved in the day to day running but these companies eventually struggle to scale as they grow. Many hosting providers experience these growing pains and you may have noticed it with yours in the past - perhaps support responses have become slower or less in-depth, or performance on your site has dropped as time has gone on.\n\nThere's a phrase that defines a number of hosting companies, particular those that have gone through acquistions and ownership changes: techdebt. Roughly this means legacy technical problems that you have to deal with, caused because things weren't done properly at the start. At Stablepoint we are proudly techdebt-free.\n\nDom and Bruce have worked together for many years in previous jobs, running tens of thousands of services for users at many well-known hosting companies. Bruce's expertise with modern orchestration tools has allowed him and his team to build systems which are optimised for fast-moving, local requirements of the modern internet.\n\nPictured: Dom (CTO) and Bruce (Chief Engineer) in deep discussion about the virtues of Terraform.\n\nStaff wellbeing is extremely important to us, so we have three offices in some of the nicest locations possible. Because our servers are all 'public cloud' there is no need for them to be situated on industrial estates next to datacentres.\n\nIt was important to us that no staff member should have to work an overnight shift; that is not good for employees, and it is not good for customers. Our three locations, therefore, allow all team members to maintain an excellent work-life balance while providing brilliant round the clock support to customers.\n\nAfter many years in the industrial heartlands of Slough and the Thames Valley, we knew that the headquarters of Stablepoint had to take us back out to the countryside.\n\nOur UK office is in the Cotswolds, a beautiful part of the English west country. Our dogs come to work, we sit outside on warm days, and for company events, we go to the nearby pub that two of our founders (Dom & Seb) own.\n\nIf you are a prospective or existing client, please contact us if you would like to arrange a meeting. We do also maintain a small office in Fitzrovia, London, for meetings in the capital.\n\nOur Bali office is situated in a converted villa near Canggu. We're an international team: not only Indonesians but also Australians, Singaporeans, and Europeans: very reflective of Bali itself.\n\nThe working day starts quite early - usually before 8am. But that means that by mid-afternoon we can be on the beach enjoying the sun.\n\nBali has a great coffee-shop culture, and a strong emphasis on healthy eating and living.\n\nSofia has always been a mixture of East and West; a melting pot of cultures and beliefs. Our office is in an early 20th-century building, of which the other floors are used as an art gallery exhibiting Bulgarian art.\n\nSofia has been the tech hub of Eastern Europe for at least the last decade; this is partially explained by the fact that Bulgaria was the computer center of the Eastern Bloc and many technical universities were built.\n\nWe are always looking for great people to join our team in any of our three locations. You need to have significant technical website development history, and web server experience, as well as exceptional customer service skills. Crucially, you also need to have something about you that makes you more than just good at your job; you need to be interesting and fun to be around and work with.\n\nAll work is fully office-based. We consider ourselves excellent employers and pay competitive international salaries.\n\nSend a CV and cover letter to [email protected]."
