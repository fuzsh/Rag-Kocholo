The purposes of these assessments vary. Some assessments are used to recoup specific charges by third party vendors per contract(s) for various services. Others recoup expenses incurred by the WSU Foundation during the ordinary course of business. The WSU Foundation also applies these assessments and fees to create the revenue stream to cover a portion of its operating expenses. For more information about the WSU Foundation’s fee structure, please visit our Fees and Assessments Disclosure page.\n\nCan I make a gift in memory or in honor of someone?\n\nYes. You will have the option to select whether a gift is to be in honor of or in memory of someone when making a gift online after you’ve designated your gift to any established WSU fund you choose.

It is a separate, independent entity chartered by the state of Washington as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education corporation. Gifts made to support WSU through the WSU Foundation are used according to the donor’s wishes, and may not be reallocated by the state. Gifts to the foundation are tax-deductible to the full extent of the law. More information about the WSU Foundation can be found in the About Us section.\n\nWhy does a state university need private support?\n\nState support is critically important, but it continues to decline as a percentage of the University’s total operating budget, making private contributions from alumni and friends increasingly important if WSU is to fulfill its mission of excellence in scholarship, research, and outreach.\n\nHow does the WSU Foundation serve WSU?\n\nThe WSU Foundation exists solely for the benefit of WSU and serves as the preferred conduit for private gifts to all areas of the University. The WSU Foundation is governed by a Board of Governors.\n\nThrough annual giving programs, planned gifts (those made through Wills, Trusts, and other planned methods), and special-purpose campaigns, the WSU Foundation works with all twelve WSU colleges and many other units, including WSU Libraries, the Museum of Art, Cougar Athletics, International Programs, 4H/Extension, as well as our regional campuses in Spokane, Tri-Cities, and Vancouver, to generate private support from alumni and friends.\n\nHow is the WSU Foundation different from the WSU Alumni Association?\n\nThe WSU Foundation’s focus is fund raising. The WSU Alumni Association’s focus is “friend raising”. We are two separate organizations that exist to support WSU in different but complementary ways. The mission of the WSU Foundation is to promote, accept, and maximize private support for programs, initiatives, and properties of the entire Washington State University system. The WSU Foundation also prudently manages, invests, and stewards the assets entrusted to it by WSU and its alumni, friends, and donors. More information about the WSU Foundation can be found in the About Us section.\n\nThe WSU Alumni Association—through its events, services, and network of chapters across the U.S.—works to find meaningful ways for alumni to become involved with their alma mater. To learn more about the WSUAA visit: alumni.wsu.edu\n\nWhat does the WSU Foundation do with contributions?\n\nWe direct your gifts exactly as you specify. Expenditures of these gift funds are made by WSU administrators, faculty, and staff, according to strict guidelines for the use of the money as specified by the donor. Donors often allow the University to direct their gifts where they’re needed most. These are called unrestricted gifts. WSU typically uses unrestricted funds to help provide scholarships, recruit outstanding faculty, facilitate student and faculty research, help defray the costs of traveling to present research, and support important University initiatives for which other funding is not available.\n\nHow does the WSU Foundation ensure that donor intent is followed?\n\nIf WSU is to continue to thrive in the years ahead, private support is essential. At the WSU Foundation, our job is to do everything we can to maximize that support now and into the future. This means that earning and keeping the trust of our donors is among our very highest priorities. Most of the 60,000+ contributions received by the WSU Foundation annually are cash or credit card gifts made in response to annual mailings and Call-A-Coug telephone outreach campaigns. In those cases, checks or credit card authorizations usually are accompanied by a gift form that has been filled out by the donor either in writing or online, indicating to us that the gift is to be directed to a specific account in support of the WSU program of the donor’s choosing.\n\nWhen a contributor wishes to make a more complex gift (such as those involving real estate, a variety of non-cash assets, or through a Bequest or Trust), he or she often contacts the WSU Foundation well in advance so we can work more closely with the donor and his or her financial advisor. In these cases, a “Gift Use Agreement” is developed to assure that all involved—the donor and his/her family and advisors, the WSU Foundation, and often the WSU unit(s) that will benefit from the donor’s gift—are in agreement about the nature and designation of the contribution.\n\nWhat does the WSU Foundation’s IRS Form 990 contain?\n\nAs is true of all 501(c)(3)(PDF) charitable organizations, the WSU Foundation is required by federal law to file an annual income tax return, IRS Forms 990 and 990-T, and to make that report available to the public upon request. Our Forms 990 and 990-T contain detailed data such as:\n\nThe WSU Foundation’s revenues and changes in net assets or fund balances for the year\n\nA detailed statement of our yearly operational expenses\n\nA description of our major program accomplishments for the year (in our case, the amount of private funding we provide to Washington State University)\n\nDetailed balance sheets for the current and previous fiscal year\n\nInformation about our audited financial statements (reconciliation of revenue and expenses per return)\n\nAn analysis of income-producing activities and the relationship of those activities to our exempt purpose (i.e., raising funds to benefit WSU)\n\nThe WSU Foundation’sIRS Form 990(PDF) is available online. Printed copies can also be obtained by calling the Foundation or visiting the WSU Foundation’s offices in Pullman.\n\nWhen is the WSU Foundation’s fiscal year?\n\nJuly 1 through June 30.\n\nHow can I find out my total giving to the WSU Foundation?\n\nYou may contact the WSU Foundation gift accounting team at 509-335-6686.\n\nFAQs about the Endowment\n\nHow can I establish an endowed fund?\n\nEndowments are a particularly powerful investment in WSU’s future because they deliver a dependable, perpetual source of funding. For information about creating an endowed fund at the WSU Foundation, please visit our Creating an Endowment section or contact the WSU Foundation at 800-448-2978 or foundation@wsu.edu.\n\nHow does the WSU Foundation manage its endowment?\n\nFor information about how the WSU Foundation Endowment Fund is managed, click here or contact the WSU Foundation at foundation@wsu.edu or 509-448-2978.\n\nWhat is the current market value of the WSU Foundation’s Endowment?\n\nTo learn more about the WSU Foundation Endowment Fund’s performance click here.\n\nWill I get a report on how my fund is being used?\n\nDonors who have established an endowed fund with the WSU Foundation or their contacts will receive an annual endowment report (generally in November) showing how the specific fund has been used, the balance of the fund, and any growth the fund has experienced. We are also happy to prepare a report on an as-needed basis by contacting the WSU Foundation at 509-335-6686."
