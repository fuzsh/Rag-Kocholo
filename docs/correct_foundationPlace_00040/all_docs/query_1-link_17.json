        "text": "Program Description\n\nThe Foundation Program is an academic and recreational program that enrolls students in Grades 8-10. The program focuses on supporting students academically, socially, and emotionally while coaching students on making positive behaviour and life choices.\n\nFoundation challenges students to become more accountable and take responsibility for their actions and choices. Students learn skills that allow them to cope with stressful situations and to communicate in more constructive ways. Through community outings and volunteer experiences, students create ties to the community and experience success in areas of their lives where they have previously not had success. Through these accomplishments, they build self-esteem and become better overall citizens. The ability to utilize public transit is an essential component of the community recreation and volunteer program.\n\nStudent progress is managed through the Individualized Education Plan (IEP) process which involves the student, the parent/guardian and program staff. Adaptations are made where necessary to meet the needs of the students. In addition to providing educational and recreational programming, the program staff is dedicated to working individually with students to focus on their social and emotional needs.\n\nAfter completing Grade 10, students may return to their neighbourhood school, apply to another district program, or apply cross-boundary to an out of catchment school.\n\nProgram Location\n\nAdministering School:\n\nVancouver Alternate Secondary School\n\nAddress:\n\n2530 East 43rd Avenue, Vancouver, B.C. V5R 2Y7\n\nTelephone:\n\n(604) 713-5450\n\nReferral Process\n\nThe studentâ€™s current VSB case manager or administrator can submit the application found here.\n\nAll referrals are reviewed to determine program suitability relative to individual student needs. Successful applicants will be contacted by the Program Teacher or Youth and Family Worker to arrange an intake meeting with the student and their caregiver."
