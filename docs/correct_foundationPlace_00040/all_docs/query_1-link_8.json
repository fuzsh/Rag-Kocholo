        "text": "Founded in 1983, the VCC Foundation is a registered charitable organization under the Canadian Income Tax Act. It is governed by a volunteer board of directors and operated by a professional and experienced staff team.\n\nThe Foundation and its partner Vancouver Community College (VCC) enjoy an independent yet interrelated relationship. To ensure success, the College and the Foundation are committed to developing a strong collaborative relationship and building partnerships alongside donors with the end result of supporting students in their quest for an education.\n\nTogether with the support of our community of donors, the VCC Foundation has raised funds to support new buildings, classroom equipment, special projects; as well as for scholarships, bursaries and awards, and more to enrich each student's educational experience. As student needs are identified, the Foundation works to fund funding support that provides financial relief for students. Together with your help, we can continue to build a promising future for our students."
