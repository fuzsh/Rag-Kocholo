        "text": "DDP founder and Cobb County educator Lorraine Thomas explains her triumph over personal pain and how her experiences galvanized her to envision and realize her dream of empowering women and girls.\n\nDDP founder and former Cobb County educator, Lorraine Thomas believes that she was given the vision to start Destiny’s Daughters of Promise to help young girls learn how to develop the life skills needed for future success. Mrs. Thomas grew up in a single-parent home and understood many of the challenges young girls face.\n\n​\n\nOn April 27, 2007, she was given a vision that conceptualized DDP. Lorraine believes that she was given the vision to start DDP to help young girls learn how to recognize unhealthy relationships and prepare for college and careers. She also wanted to ensure that none of them would ever experience being abused, bullied or ignored.\n\n​\n\nThrough years spent in the classroom and her experiences as an instructional coach, Lorraine formulated activities that would enhance a young girl’s self-awareness, confidence, and empowerment. Mrs. Thomas drafted a plan she was sure would be a success. Although she had faith that her dream could elevate teen girls, the thought of starting DDP was a bold step. Mrs. Thomas was hesitant to share her vision.\n\n​\n\nIn October 2007, an elderly woman approached Mrs. Thomas at the end of a funeral service and told her that God wanted her to work with women and teens. This encounter stunned Lorraine, but it served as the impetus to get her to act on the dream. “Our students need more than what we could provide as teachers during the school day,” says Thomas.\n\n​\n\nWith the help of board members, volunteers, and supporters, she developed a program that would instill in young women the foundations of healthy relationship-building techniques, leadership skills, civic engagement, and personal growth and development. Lorraine presented the program idea to Cobb County school administrators and principals, all of whom gave their support.\n\n​\n\nThe first DDP board meeting was held on October 4, 2007, with the following members: Charles A. Thomas, Tanya Gayle, Pamela Bagley, Kimberly Nix, Susan Adair, and Sharon Jackson.\n\nEquipped with backing from the community, the organization was incorporated on February 20, 2008. Lorraine initially wanted to name the organization Daughters of Promise, but discovered that the name was not available. The board members eventually decided on the name Destiny’s Daughters of Promise. The group alternated hosting the monthly board meetings in their homes until Barber Middle School approved holding the meetings at the school.\n\n​\n\nThe mission of DDP was to provide mentoring to young women ages 12-18 years old in a fun and exciting way to help prepare them for a successful future; the first workshop session was held at Barber Middle School in the fall of 2008 with eight girls.\n\nFuture goals and organization vision\n\nDDP fills an immediate need among local at-risk middle and high school youth. Demand continues to grow for our life-enhancing workshops, mentoring, and leadership development programs. It is our vision to develop additional partnerships with local schools to expand and launch our program in additional schools in the Metro Atlanta area."
