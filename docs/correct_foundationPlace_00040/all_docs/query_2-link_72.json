Yoshpe John F. Allums Joseph E. Russell Barbara A. Atkin EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OFFICE OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WASHINGTON, D.C. 1972 For sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office Washington, D.C. 20402 - Price $2.25 (paper cover) Stock Number 4102-00008 iv THE WHITE HOUSE WAS H I N G T O N On August 15, 1971, I announced a series of measures designed to stabilize the economy at home and to help our country maintain its rightful economic position in the world. Among these measures was the first peacetime wageprice freeze in our history. In prescribing the 90-day freeze, I set down several guiding principles: we would move toward a greater stability of wages and prices, but we would do this without fastening on the Nation a permanent straitjacket of controls and without creating a huge bureaucracy. These principles prompted the establishment of the interagency Cost of Living Council under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Treasury, the designation of the Office of Emergency Preparedness as the central instrument to administer the freeze, and the reliance upon the coordinated teamwork of the other Federal departments and agencies. Under the leadership of Director George A. Lincoln, the Office of Emergency Preparedness succeeded in holding the line while we worked out the longer term measures needed to maintain wage-price moderation and improve our position in the changing world economy. All Americans can take pride in this accomplishment, for it was their splendid cooperation and support that, in the final analysis, made it possible for the program to succeed. As we take the road back toward wage-price stability and the operation of free market forces, it is important that we provide, for the benefit of future generations, a full record of this experience. I am pleased that a comprehensive history of the management of the wage-price freeze has been prepared. And I hope that this book will promote a more general appreciation and a deeper understanding of the problems encountered and the lessons learned in this undertaking. August 1972 Foreword On Sunday night, August 15, 1971, President Nixon announced a \"New Economic Policy\"—a comprehensive program of interlocking measures designed to bring inflation under control, stimulate the economy, and correct the acute disequilibrium that had developed in the Nation's international economic position. Included in this program was a provision for a 90-day wage-price freeze as a necessary first step to curb the persistent inflation and to buy time during which a longer-term and more flexible policy for reasonable wage and price behavior would be worked out. Here was a new initiative, unprecedented in America's peacetime experience. To be sure, authorizing legislation had been enacted a year earlier, and even before then there was strong public sentiment for curbing inflation. Yet, few people in the Summer of 1971 expected the President to take the course of direct government intervention in private wage-price decisions. By his action President Nixon took the question of direct stabilization controls in a nonwar setting out of the realm of political .and academic debate and made it a new chapter in American economic history. It is a chapter replete with unique experience in organization, management, policy, and operations; we should not ignore it in setting public economic policy in the future. In my capacity as Director of the President's Office of Emergency Preparedness, I was privileged to have been charged with the administration of the wage-price freeze. Early in the freeze I directed the compilation of a comprehensive historical record of the experience, so that we may determine what has been good and bad, useful and harmful, and so that we may have, for our future guidance, a better appreciation of the causes and conditions for both our successes and shortcomings. Such a record should be of considerable interest—to public officials charged with planning and administering government programs; to scholars interested in the Government's efforts to fashion and implement public policy; and to the general public concerned with the performance of its Government, particularly in fields like economic stabilization which so intimately affect their daily lives. vii Publication of this historical record, it is hoped, will help to meet these needs by providing a deeper appreciation and understanding of OEP's role in the wage-price freeze. G. A. LINCOLN Director Office of Emergency Preparedness Executive Office of the President Washington, D.C. August 15, 1972. VIII Preface A few days after the President's announcement of the wage-price freeze, Mr. George A. Lincoln, Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, asked me to take the lead in planning and developing a comprehensive historical account of the Agency's experience in managing this program. Such an account, he felt, would serve the public interest, and the most favorable time to prepare it was while the experience was fresh in the minds of the participants and the records were most readily available. The project was carried out by a small team of professional historians. Besides directing and coordinating the undertaking, I wrote Chapters I, VIII, and IX. John F. Allums collaborated with me in the overall planning of the task and contributed Chapters II and III. Joseph E. Russell wrote Chapters IV, V, and VI and lent strong editorial support to the entire work. Barbara A. Atkin wrote Chapter VII, prepared the Chronology, and assisted Mr. Russell with the heavy burdens of editing the final manuscript and preparing it for the printer. All worked together as a team, sharing sources of information and commenting on one another's draft manuscripts. While each assumes responsibility for his or her chapters, the total history represents contributions of ideas and labor from the entire group. Of special significance was the cooperation and encouragement we received from the Director and the entire staff at every stage in the preparation of this history. Being on the scene almost from the outset of the freeze and set up strategically with a Special Staff relationship to the Director, the historians had ready access to all official files. They were in an extraordinarily good position to collect, screen, and organize important materials relating to the freeze while it was still in progress. They supplemented the written record with interviews with key personnel to clarify facts and round out their interpretation. The historians visited four Regional Offices and obtained comprehensive after-action reports from all 10 Regional Directors. The historians' indebtedness to the Director and the staff both at the headquarters and in the field is immeasurable; without this top-level interest and support, this volume could not have been produced in its present scope and depth or completed in the time ix allotted for the purpose. The \"Bibliographical Note\" at the end of this volume names some of the people who reviewed our manuscripts and offered many helpful suggestions for their improvement. It would not be feasible to list the many additional people who provided assistance. We do wish to single out, however, Jerome Brussell, who designed the cover and produced all the organization charts; Alice Bandy, who made available the basic documentation in the Director's files; Carol Wanner and Nan Dever, who provided us with library and congressional materials; and Theresa Moorleghen, Jeanne Criss, and Anne Lockhart, who steadfastly and patiently typed manuscripts and provided secretarial assistance. The authors sought to observe the standards of scholarship associated with the historical profession. They made every effort not merely to chronicle the events, but to analyze objectively the problems encountered, show how they were met, and explain the reasons underlying policy and administrative decisions. Whatever merit this book may have is due in no small measure to the cooperation and assistance we received from all who participated in administering the freeze. Needless to say, the authors assume full responsibility for the organization and presentation of the subject, for any opinions expressed or implied, and for any errors of detail or judgment. HARRY B.

Such action had been taken during World War II and again during the Korean War as part of a kit of direct controls which, together with various indirect controls, were designed to achieve economic stabilization.1 In both instances, a wage-price freeze was imposed when the country mobilized for war. Productive capacity was being fully utilized, unemployment was low, and increased demands for goods and services coupled with shortages or the anticipation of shortages had produced unacceptable \"demand-pull\" inflation. The inflation situation in the summer of 1971 was significantly different from the wartime situations mentioned above. The United States was winding down its involvement in the Vietnam War. It was a period of slack demand, idle productive capacity, and high unemployment (although the economy had definitely turned upward into the rising phase of the business cycle). And yet, to the dismay of many observers in our society, including economists in and out of government, it was also a period of excessive inflation—an aftermath of the war-stimulated excessive demand of 1966-1968, unrestrained by existing fiscal policy. Containment of the destabilizing forces was first sought through the application of indirect controls, embracing first restrictive and later expansive fiscal and monetary policies.2 The Administration's 1 For a discussion of the use of direct and indirect controls under wartime conditions, see Thomas B. Worsley, Emergency Economic Stabilization (Washington: Industrial College of the Armed Forces, 1971). 2 These policies operate by decreasing or increasing total demand and the effective money supply of the economy, without interfering directly with the operation of the market mechanism and its system of making choices competitively. For a comprehensive discussion of the role and use of these indirect stabilization instruments, see G. L. Bach, Making Monetary and Fiscal Policy (Washington: Brookings Institution, 1971). 474-893 O - 72 - 2 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM \"game plan,\" involving use of fiscal and monetary instruments, however, failed to achieve an acceptable combination of reduced inflation and acceleration of the economy's economic growth rate. It was this shortfall in the operation of the indirect controls in an environment of comparative peace, rather than any parallels to the conditions prevailing in 1942 or 1951, that accounted for President Nixon's recourse, in 1971, to a new economic policy embracing an integrated package of measures designed to bring the Nation to higher employment, greater price stability, and a stronger international position. The precipitating factor in this decision was the progressive deterioration of the U.S. balance of payments and attendant pressures on the dollar at mid-year. The use of indirect stabilization tools in the period after World War II was a recognition of the Government's responsibility even in peacetime for helping to maintain sustained economic growth and stability.3 The remarkable achievements of the free enterprise system had always been marred by periods of economic stagnation, recession, and depression. Prior to the 1930's, cyclical fluctuations with alternating periods of prosperity and depression had come to be accepted as normal; and the Federal Government did little to counter these. The Great Depression of the Thirties opened a new era in American economic thinking. That depression dragged on for a dozen years; at its lowest point, nearly one out of four of the labor force was unemployed. The Government's response to this situation was to intervene extensively in the American economy; but even so, the depression lingered on until it was ended by the mobilization demands of World War II. With the close of that war, Congress resolved to take more direct responsibility for ensuring continued economic growth and checking the recurrence of severe economic fluctuations. This resolution was embodied in the Employment Act of 1946, which declared it to be \"the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable means . . . to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.\" The Act ranks as a landmark in the history of American economic policy, symbolizing national aspirations and a new responsibility of government to promote economic stability at high levels of employment. These objectives have had widespread support. The design of policies that would achieve these objectives and reconcile 8 For a good compilation of select materials on this subject, see Economic Policies for National Strength: The Quest for Sustained Growth and Stability, Stephen R. Chitwood, ed. (Washington: Industrial College of the Armed Forces. 1968). PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM conflicts among them, however, has posed a challenge of formidable proportions.4 In the quarter century since the passage of the Employment Act, the indirect monetary, fiscal, and debt management policies were preferred over direct controls as the appropriate tools for promoting economic growth and stability. Except for the Korean War years, direct controls were avoided. Each succeeding Federal administration, Republican and Democratic alike, acknowledged the Government's responsibility to maintain maximum employment, production, and purchasing power. There were differences in the extent of the commitment and in the particular policies and techniques used, but each administration acknowledged the first importance of a strong, growing, and stable national economy. Indeed, such an economic environment had come to be viewed not only as a domestic imperative, but also as essential to the stature, power, and security of the United States in the international arena.5 Efforts to promote economic growth and stability for much of the period following the enactment of the Employment Act were reasonably successful. The Nation avoided a major depression. Recessions were shallow and of short duration. Real output grew markedly, and until 1965 the rate of price increases (other than the surge in 1950-51—the first year of the Korean War) was kept within tolerable bounds. But there were difficulties ahead in ensuring a continued fullemployment and non-inflationary environment. The Nation in 1965 already faced a serious balance-of-payments problem with no real solution in sight. The increased influx of young people into the labor force—a result of the baby boom in the late 1940's— threatened to create undesirable levels of unemployment. And the deepening involvement of the United States in the Vietnam conflict increased government spending which was not offset by increased revenues. These fiscal trends resulted in a Federal Government budget deficit of $25 billion in Fiscal Year 1968.6 There was no 4 Lester V.

PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM desire to invoke direct price and wage controls; at the same time, adequate fiscal and monetary restraints were applied too late to cope effectively with the inflation. Quasi-voluntary restraints through wage-price guideposts and moral suasion by the President introduced in the early sixties, had little real effect after 1965, in the face of the Vietnam War situation.7 At the time President Lyndon B. Johnson left office, the economy had been brought to practically full employment, but not without significant inflation.8 PROBLEMS BESETTING THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION The Nixon Administration embarked on restrictive fiscal and monetary policies in the hope of cooling the overheated economy and achieving gradual disinflation. Unemployment, which had reached a low of 3.3 percent in February 1969, was expected to increase somewhat, but the Administration accepted this as a \"trade-off\" for greater price stability. A gradual expansion of the economy would be sought after mid-1970. The Administration rejected proposed remedies by way of direct wage and price controls or an \"incomes policy\" such as the guideposts and moral suasion strategy of earlier administrations. The new administration was soon confronted, however, with a perverse combination of what came to be called \"the worst of both worlds\"—recession and inflation. The economy began to slip into recession in late 1969. Monetary and fiscal policies were reversed to provide stimulus in place of restraint, but recovery was too slow. In mid-1971, about one-fourth of the Nation's manufacturing capacity was idle. Unemployment was estimated at about 6 percent 7 John Sheahan, The Wage-Price Guideposts (Washington: Brookings Institution, 1967); George P. Shultz and Robert Z. Aliber, eds., Guidelines, Informal Controls, and the Market Place: Policy Choices in a Full Employment Economy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1966) ; U.S. Congress, Joint Economic Committee, The Wage-Price Issue: The Need for Guideposts (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1968) . 8 Robert J.

PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM of the Nation's labor force, and inflation remained near the 4 percent annual rate level.9 By then, it was clear, the upward wage-price spiral had long lost any war-induced \"demand-pull\" character. Here was a new virus of inflation. Few economists could speak with confidence about its causes or its cure. It seemed to have become a selfsustaining process, living on its own momentum under \"cost-push\" —a direct result of wage and price increases in excess of gains in productivity. This new type of inflation seemed to lend support to the thesis of John Kenneth Galbraith and others that market competition was a thing of the past. The economy, they contended, had come to be dominated by giant firms and strong unions; and the public was being victimized by their monopoly power.10 How else could one explain the fact that even in the midst of substantial unemployment the unions were demanding and getting wage increases in excess of average increases in productivity per man-hour? Or how could one explain that the prices of manufactured goods continued to rise while some 25 percent of the plant capacity for producing these goods remained idle? In the face of mounting inflation, the Nixon Administration found itself under pressure to adopt an incomes policy, even though experience with such a policy at home and abroad was far from a happy one.11 Nonetheless, the public was in a mood for more direct action to cope with the twin evils of inflation and unemployment. In the judgment of Herbert Stein, member of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers and one of the principal architects of the Administration's stabilization program, the clamor for an incomes policy was in part, at least, politically motivated. . . . The opposition to the Administration found it very convenient and effective to take this line because it made them the champions of price stability and full employment without having to accept any responsibility. As long as the President didn't accept the advice to use an income policy, he was responsible for the performance of the economy. And if he did take the advice, he would be responsible for the difficult task of making it work.12 Actually, the Nixon Administration did take several steps along •On the Nixon economic game plan see Herbert Stein, \"Beyond Inflation/' Remarks at the 17th Southern Trust Conference, Chattanooga, Tennessee, May 15, 1969; Worsley, Emergency Economic Stabilization, pp. 95-107. 10 John K.

PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM the lines of an incomes policy. In an address to the Nation on June 17, 1970, the President announced a number of actions \"that will help to move us ahead more quickly towards our goal of full employment, economic growth, and reasonable price stability in peacetime.\" Three actions were keyed to the fight against inflation: (1) Appointing a National Commission on Productivity, composed of representatives from business, labor, the public, and government, to explore means of improving productivity in the economy and achieving \"a balance between costs and productivity that will lead to more stable prices\"; (2) Instructing the Council of Economic Advisers to prepare \"inflation alerts,\" to be made public by the Productivity Commission, spotlighting significant wage and price increases and analyzing their impact on the general price level; and (3) Establishing a Regulations and Purchasing Review Board within the Federal Government to examine all government actions \"to determine where Federal purchasing and regulations drive up costs and prices.\" U.S. import policy, the President added, would be reviewed \"to see how supplies can be increased to meet rising demand, without losing jobs here at home/' While taking these steps to combat inflation and calling on business and labor to help hold down the cost of living, the President was opposed to the imposition of wage and price controls, \"however politically expedient that may seem.\" Controls and rationing may seem like an easy way out but they are really an easy way into more trouble—to the explosion that follows when you try to clamp a lid on a rising head of steam without turning down the fire under the pot. Wage and price controls only postpone a day of reckoning, and in so doing they rob every American of a very important part of his freedom. This was not the time, the President asserted, for Congress to \"play politics with inflation\" by granting him standby authority to impose wage and price controls. Rather, he hoped that Congress would cooperate with him on a program specifically designed \"to help the people who need help in a period of economic transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy.\" While pressing for that program, the President emphasized: \"There is no more important goal than to curb inflation without permitting severe disruption. This is an activist administration, and should new developments call for new action in the future, I shall take the action needed to attain that goal.\" 13 Despite President Nixon's avowed opposi13 \"Economic Policy and Productivity,\" The President's Address to the Nation, June 17, 1970, in Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, June 22, 1970, pp. 774-781. PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM tion to direct controls, Congress enacted the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, granting him standby powers to impose wage and price controls. The Council of Economic Advisers proceeded with inflation alerts—the first two in August and December, 1970. Leaders of the opposition in Congress, however, criticized these \"after-the-fact handslappings,\" and urged the President to institute a 30- to 60-day freeze on wage and price increases, using his standby authority, and then to formulate guidelines for longer-range wage and price restraints.14 In a speech before the National Association of Manufacturers in December 1970, outlining stabilization actions and proposals to stimulate the economy toward full growth and employment, President Nixon sharply criticized the bargaining processes and extraordinarily high wage settlements in the construction industry. And in March 1971 he issued an Executive order, based on the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, establishing a tripartite Construction Industry Stabilization Committee to moderate wage-price increases in that industry.15 Along with these difficult problems on the domestic scene, the United States' international economic position approached a point of crisis by mid-1971. Inflation at home was pricing the country's goods out of the world market and exacerbating the existing trade deficit. The balance of payments, already unfavorable in the sixties, deteriorated sharply and dangerously in 1970-71. This erosion in the United States' trade and balance-of-payments position triggered and was accentuated by enormous outflows of short-term capital, which placed severe strains on America's international \"Worsley, op. cit., pp. 103-104.

PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM financial status.16 This mounting financial crisis, Stein reflected later, dictated the timing of the decision to institute wage-price controls and perhaps the decision to do it at all. As he put it: . . . The outflow of dollars from the United States reached flood proportions in the Summer (of 1971) , there was some loss of gold and a further and larger loss of gold was at least a danger. Some decisive action had to be taken on that front. The action taken was to close the gold window, suspending the convertibility of dollars into gold . . . The decision to close the gold window opened the prospect of all kinds of panicky reactions including a massive flight from the dollar at home and abroad. Action that would unmistakably indicate the government's determination to protect the real value of the dollar was needed, and nothing could serve this function so well as a wage-price freeze.17 THE DECISION AT CAMP DAVID All the above mentioned considerations converged in the President's decision, August 15, 1971, to change his economic \"game plan.\" That Sunday evening, after a busy weekend at Camp David, the President made a dramatic announcement of a \"New Economic Policy\" designed to achieve, as he told the Nation, \"a new prosperity without war.\" Such a program, he said, would require action on three fronts—creating new jobs, halting inflation, and protecting the position of the American dollar \"as a pillar of monetary stability around the world.\" The range of actions taken and proposed that evening, the President observed, was \"the most comprehensive New Economic Policy to be undertaken by this Nation in four decades.\" 18 This momentous change in course was effected in a surprisingly short time and in complete secrecy. Only some two weeks before the August 15 announcement, Dr. Paul W. McCracken, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, had entered a strong rebuttal of John K. Galbraith and other advocates of wage-price controls.19 36 See Statements by Paul A. Volcker, Under Secretary of Treasury for Monetary Affairs, before the Subcommittee on Internation Trade of the Senate Finance Committee, September 13, 1971, and the Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy, House Foreign Affairs Committee, September 21, 1971; see also Paul W.

Necessary planning and studies proceeded secretly in various agencies and offices of the Federal Government.20 Still, there were indications that the President was considering, if not actually moving toward, a change in policy. To be sure, on June 29th Treasury Secretary John B. Connally announced the President's rejection of wage and price controls along with several other proposals to stimulate the economy and curb inflation.21 Less than one month later, however, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur F. Burns urged the Administration to take further steps to control inflation. Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee on July 23, Burns said: \"In my judgment, and in the judgment of the Board as a whole, the present inflation in the midst of substantial unemployment poses a problem that traditional monetary and fiscal remedies cannot solve as quickly as the national interest demands/' He added: The inflation we are confronted with has become deeply rooted since its beginning in 1965. The forces of excess demand that originally led to price inflation disappeared well over a year ago. Nevertheless, strong and stubborn inflationary forces, emanating from rising costs, linger on. I wish I could report that we are making substantial progress in dampening the inflation spiral. I cannot do so. The Administration, Burns felt, should establish a wage-price review board and resort to compulsory arbitration to keep wages and prices down in industries that especially affected the public interest.22 Though he kept reiterating his dislike for wage and price controls, President Nixon, at an impromptu news conference held August 4th, indicated that he would reconsider his position if a full-scale Congressional debate convinced him that controls could be enforced without putting the economy in a straitjacket. . . . with regard to wage-price boards, I have still not been convinced that we can move in that direction and be effective. . . . As far as we are concerned, we have an open mind in terms of examining various proposals to see if there is a new approach which we may not have thought of. I have serious doubts that they will find such a new approach, but I do want to indicate that we will examine it because we all agree that the wage-price 30 \"The Presidency—Recollections of Camp David,\" National Journal, September 18, 1971, p. 1934. 81 Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 92nd Congress, 1st Session . . . 1971 (Washington: Congressional Quarterly, 1972), pp. 691, 692. 10 Ibid., p. 692. 9 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM spiral is a significant danger to this expanding economy. The question is what do we do about it, without going all the way to a totally controlled economy.28 The same day Treasury Secretary John B. Connally elaborated on this theme and even posed some of the specific questions in the price-wage control field \"which need exploring.\" Among these, he told the press, were: 1. How effective have various approaches been? 2. What type of organization would be set up to administer the program? Would there be only one national Board, or many regional and local ones? How would they be staffed, by volunteers, government employees? 3. How would legislation be implemented? How would it be enforced? What would be the penalties for violation? Would there be roll back authority? What if workers strike against a decision? What type of appeal from decisions would there be? 4. What will be the criteria for appropriate wage and price action? How would it affect escalator clauses in existing wage pacts? Will industries be allowed price increases where prices and profits are low to start? Would low wage workers, say those at the poverty level, be denied wage increases? 5. How comprehensive should the scope of these measures be? Would interest rates, both rates paid and received, be controlled? If interest rates were controlled, would there also have to be controls on allocation of credit determining who was or wasn't eligible? Would legal and medical fees be included? Taxes? Prices of homes, businesses, stocks, bonds, tuition, rents, trade-in's? 6. What would be the effects upon our balance of trade? Would any form of controls build in a significant disadvantage for our goods relative to those imported into this country and to the competitive position of our products abroad? 7. What happens when such legislation is no longer needed? How will we tell when such legislation is no longer needed? \"If these questions are objectively and exhaustively pursued, analyzed and discussed/' Connally asserted, \"the result undoubtedy will be a clearer definition of terms and conditions presently under discussion and bring into clearer focus the actual economic situation of the nation/' 24 Still, few even among the economists had any notion that a radical change in policy was in the offing. The White House moved with utmost secrecy for fear that premature disclosure might have adverse effects both on the international and domestic scenes. Most of the individuals who worked on various parts of the new policy were not fully aware of what was involved until they heard or read the President's speech. 23 See Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents, August 9, 1971, Vol. 7, No. 32, p. 1124. Extracts reprinted in U.S. News and World Report, August 16, 1971, pp. 76-80. * Department of the Treasury News Release, August 4, 1971. 10 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY The President's program had several objectives: (1) to deal with the problem of inflation; (2) to stimulate the economy immediately and improve efficiency and competitiveness over the long-run; and (3) to strengthen America's position in the world economy by improving the international monetary and trading system and providing relatively quick balance-of-payments benefits. These objectives and the specific measures announced for their implementation were deemed interlocking and mutually reinforcing. In testimony before a subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Paul A. Volcker, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Monetary Affairs, emphasized the interrelationship of the steps in the domestic and international areas: . . . success in the domestic elements of the program is essential to lasting success in the international sphere. Domestic stability is a prerequisite to international stability. If we do not resolve the problems of eliminating inflation and improving our productive efficiency while creating more jobs at home, we will not maintain the improved competitive position which is necessary to genuine and lasting improvement in our international financial position.25 Indeed, Administration spokesmen asserted, each element of the President's program interlocked with other elements in such a way that the effectiveness of the whole would be greater than the sum of the parts, taken individually.26 Specifically, the program consisted of the following: 1) A 90-day freeze of all prices, rents, wages, and salaries. 2) Creation of a Cabinet-level Cost of Living Council to make the basic decisions concerning the 90-day freeze, the postfreeze economic stabilization program, and the eventual transition back to a free-market economy. 3) Temporary suspension of the full convertibility of the dollar into gold, thus letting it \"float\" to its own level in relation to foreign currencies. 4) Imposition of a temporary surcharge on imports into the U.S., generally at a rate of 10 percent. 5) A recommendation for changes in the tax laws which would: a) restore, effective August 15, 1971, an accelerated investment tax 25 Statement before the Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, September 21, 1971. 28 Release of White House press conference of Hon.

Further, the President proposed a 3-month deferral of the effective date of general revenue sharing, and a one-year postponement of welfare reform.27 THE WAGE-PRICE FREEZE In this August 15 announcement, President Nixon emphasized two characteristics of the freeze. First, it was to be temporary. \"To put the strong vigorous American economy into a permanent straitjacket,\" he said, \"would lock in unfairness and stifle the expansion of our free enterprise system.\" Second, while Government sanctions would be invoked if necessary to support the freeze, the President did not anticipate the establishment of a huge pricecontrol bureaucracy. Reliance would be placed on the voluntary cooperation of all Americans to make this freeze work. \"Working together,\" he was confident, \"we will break the back of inflation, and we will do it without the mandatory wage and price controls that crush economic and personal freedom/' Further insights into the plans for implementing the freeze were presented in various briefings given immediately after August 15 by Mr. Arnold Weber, who became the Executive Director of the Cost of Living Council. His description may be summarized as follows: a. The freeze order was comprehensive in scope. b. Although simple in concept, the freeze was inherently complex in implementation. c. The Administration did not institute a system of controls in the sense that there were rules to permit the dynamic adjustment of wages and prices. The system of controls that would permit such movement would fall in the planning 27 For a detailed exposition, see \"Explanatory Material on the President's Economic Program,\" White House release, August 15, 1971. The freeze action was spelled out the same day by Executive Order 11615, issued under the authority of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 as amended. The imposition of the temporary surcharge on imports was announced by Presidential Proclamation 4074, also on August 15, 1971, by which the President declared a \"national emergency\" and called upon the public and private sectors \"to make the efforts necessary to strengthen the international economic position of the United States.\" 12 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM for Phase II [the postfreeze Economic Stabilization Program]. Clearly, the freeze was a \"control\" in the technical sense but not to the degree of establishing a set of criteria to permit adjustments. d. The Cost of Living Council was also charged with the development of Phase II policy. e. The freeze was imposed with little warning because of the desire to avoid anticipatory wage and price increases. That is, if firms and unions were aware that a freeze would be imposed some undoubtedly would have raised wages and prices in anticipation. This is what happened in the Korean War and it created a sharp sense of inequity while giving further impetus to inflation in the shortrun. f. Many policy decisions were still to be made. Policy had already been promulgated on some issues, such as the disallowance of deferred wage increases and of price increases where substantial transactions had not occurred during the preceding 30 days. No one, however, as yet presumed to have answers to all the questions that would arise. g. Since the President did not want a large bureaucracy, and since part of the program involved a five percent cut in Government personnel and other budgetary stringencies, available resources had to be used. The Office of Emergency Preparedness was therefore given the responsibility for setting up the national service and compliance machinery, with ten Regional Centers. An 'in-place' structure was thus used, and other departments and agencies were asked to provide resources to augment this structure as needed.28 The Administration saw the freeze as providing \"shock treatment\" to the escalation of wages and prices. It was hoped that this treatment would be temporary and would have beneficial therapeutic effects. It was obvious from the first that, in an economy as complex and diverse as that of the United States, the freeze could only serve as a holding operation, administering a temporary restraint. Imbalances of all sorts would be frozen into the system, and the longer the freeze went on the more serious would become the resulting inequities. Complaints and petitions for relief could be expected to mount and require an ever-increasing apparatus for administration and enforcement. The Administration hoped for public acceptance of this temporary restraint until means could be designed to alter permanently the pressures that fanned the inflation. If the inflation were not to flare up anew, the freeze would have to be followed by a stabilization program that would be fair to all segments of the economy and still be firm enough to be effective. Unless it were fair in dealing with the inevitable and irresistible pressures for change, it would not be acceptable and it would not work. And unless it had force behind it, it would suffer the same fate as other toothless schemes tried in this country and abroad in the past. 28 Arnold R. Weber, University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, Chicago, 111., Letter to G. A. Lincoln, Director, Office of Emergency Preparedness, January 7, 1972. 13 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM The President made clear from the outset that governmental restraints upon free-market forces would be necessary until the inflationary pressures were brought under control. The Nation had been operating under the freeze only some 3 weeks when the President announced before a special joint session of Congress that the freeze would not be extended beyond the 90 days. But he assured the Congress and the American people that with the expiration of the freeze the necessary steps would be taken to prevent the recurrence of runaway inflation. As we consider what follows the freeze, let us bear in mind that prosperity is a job for everyone—and that fighting inflation is everybody's business. Let us remember, also, that nothing would be more detrimental to the new prosperity in the long-run than to put this Nation's strong free enterprise system in a straitjacket of Government controls. Regimentation and Government coercion must never become a way of life in the United States of America. That means that price and wage stabilization, in whatever form it takes, must be only a way station on the road to free markets and free collective bargaining in a new prosperity without war.29 The challenge for the Administration was to make the freeze work and, looking beyond its expiration on November 13, to design a strategy of controls that would be equitable and still avoid the central planning, regimentation, and compulsion that may be inevitable under emergency conditions but which would be clearly unacceptable as a permanent feature. Legislative Base The President imposed the wage-price freeze under authority provided in the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970. First enacted on August 15, 1970, this Act was extended and amended on three occasions. At the time of the freeze, the Act was not due to expire until midnight April 30, 1972.30 The policy of having standby legislation to permit the imposition of a general freeze at the onset of an emergency had been the subject of extensive Congressional study and debate.

A number of economists (notably John Kenneth Galbraith), labor leaders, mayors of large cities, and others came out strongly for a temporary freeze on prices and wages. Some directed their fire specifically at unions and large corporations, while others supported a more general approach to controls.82 Seemingly convinced that the indirect approach would not suffice, Congress moved to give the President standby authority to use a freeze as a check on inflation. In support of the legislation, House Majority Leader Carl Albert argued that the President and his advisers \"are prescribing the wrong medicine for the particular inflationary virus now infecting the Nation/' Restrictive fiscal and monetary policies, Albert noted, were appropriate for combating traditional demand-pull inflation, but the cost-push inflation then besetting the country required the imposition of direct controls.33 On August 15, 1970, the President signed the measure into law, though he gave notice that he did not want the freeze authority and would not use it. Were it not for the need to renew some important provisions of the Defense Production Act, Nixon said, he would have vetoed the bill. A freeze on wages and prices, he said, \"simply does not fit the economic conditions which exist today.\" If Congress felt that wage-price controls should be mandatory, the President added, it should \"face up to its responsibilities and make such controls mandatory.\" 34 The Act authorized the President to \"issue such orders and regulations as he may deem appropriate to stabilize prices, rents, wages and salaries,\" but not at levels below those prevailing on May 25, 1970. Such orders and regulations, the Act stipulated, \"may provide for the making of such adjustments as may be neces81 Bernard M. Baruch, Chairman of the War Industries Board in World War I, was the leading exponent of standby authority and fought for it consistently over the years. For Baruch's proponency of this concept, see Harry B. Yoshpe, A Voice in the Wilderness: Baruch's Proposals for an Overall Price Ceiling and Standby Control Authority. (Washington: Industrial College for the Armed Forces, March 1964) (Publication No. R-232).

An amendment to the Economic Stabilization Act, adopted on May 18, 1971, precluded the President from singling out \"a particular industry or sector of the economy upon which to impose controls\" unless he made a specific finding that the wages or prices in that industry or sector had increased at a rate which was grossly disproportionate to the rate for the economy as a whole. The legislators imposed this limitation on the President's power because they had reservations about applying specific controls to a single industry, as the President had done in March 1971 with respect to union-negotiated wages in the building construction industry. Workers subject to wage controls, the Congress feared, would have no protection against the continued rise in the cost of living. And an industry subject to price controls would lack protection against increases in the prices of products or materials it purchased. For these reasons, sponsors of this legislation blocked the President from applying controls to any one sector of the economy. The economic stabilization legislation continued to be a matter of political dispute. Before its enactment, President Nixon had stated emphatically that he would not take the Nation down the road of wage and price controls. Actually, direct controls had been no less repugnant to the Johnson Administration. As early as the winter of 1967-68, there was speculation in the press and hints by some public officials that if the inflation continued or got worse, the President might seek authority to impose wage and price controls. There were then, as later in the Nixon Administration* divergent views as to how the growing inflation might be best restrained. Most economists in and out of the Government, however, continued to view direct controls over prices and wages as the tools of last resort.35 The 1968 Report of the Council of Economic Advisers made clear the Johnson Administration's opposition to wage-price controls: While such controls may he necessary under conditions of an all-out war, it would be folly to consider them as a solution to the inflationary pressures that accompany high employment under any other circumstance. They distort resource allocation; they require reliance either on necessarily clumsy and arbitrary rules or the inevitably imperfect decisions of government officials; they offer countless 35 Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, \"What's the Issue,\" transcript of radio broadcast, Mutual Broadcasting System, December 7, 1967; see also A Perspective on Wage and Price Controls, proceedings of a conference held by the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, April 5, 1968. 16 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM temptations to evasion or violation; they require a vast administrative apparatus. All these reasons make them repugnant. Although such controls may be unfortunately popular when they are not in effect, the appeal quickly disappears once people live under them.36 Subsequently, Republicans called the freeze measure a \"political charade\" intended to embarrass the President. By early 1971, however, the Administration supported the extension of this standby authority. 37 The Freeze Order Executive Order 11615, promulgated by the President on August 15, 1971, established a general freeze on prices, rents, wages and salaries. These were to be \"stabilized\" for 90 days at levels no greater than the highest of those pertaining to \"a substantial volume of actual transactions\" by the seller of commodities or services during the 30-day period ending at midnight, August 14, 1971, for the same commodities or services. If no transaction occurred in that period, the ceiling was to be \"the highest price, rent, salary or wage in the nearest preceding 30-day period in which transactions did occur.\" The freeze order covered all commodities and services with the exception of raw agricultural products. Persons selling or providing commodities or services were to maintain records of their highest price or recent charges during the specified base period, and were to have these available for public inspection. Violators of the freeze were made subject to injunction actions by the Department of Justice or to a fine of up to $5,000 for each violation. It is significant to note that Executive Order 11615, based as 't was on the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, covered only prices, rents, wages, and salaries; it did not cover interest rates, dividends, or profits. Extension of the freeze to these areas was considered at the August 13-15 meetings at Camp David, but was rejected. Whatever the merits of this decision, critics of the Administration's program charged that these omissions made it evident that the entire program was slanted in favor of big business. Asked about \"a freeze on interest\" at the White House news conference on August 15, just before the President's announcement, Treasury Secretary Connally replied: . . . We didn't include the freeze on interest for the simple reason that it was the combined judgment of everyone that it might work at cross-purposes. . . . We 88 Annual Report of the Council of Economic Advisers, 1968, p. 119. \"Worsley, op. cit., p. 102. 17 474-893 O - 72 - 3 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM did not do it because we didn't know how to effectively do it. It is almost impossible to make it apply to interest rates.38 The Administration in mid-August 1971, Connally later indicated, felt that interest rates in the 30 days preceding the freeze were too high, and those existing on May 25, 1970—the basic base periodwere even higher. Any announced ceilings on interest rates, Administration spokesmen feared, might rapidly become \"floors,\" as had been the case in the past. \"We did not want to risk stabilizing interest rates at those high levels,\" Connally said later. \"We took the risk of excluding interest from the freeze and we were right.\"89 While interest was thus excluded from the freeze, Connally made a special plea to lending institutions to go along with the antiinflation program. \"We certainly expect that they will live up to the wage-price freeze in the interest they charge,\" he said. \"It's my hope that interest rates will come down.\" 40 Dividends were, like interest, excluded from the freeze order. But in his address of August 15, announcing the freeze action, President Nixon did call upon corporations \"to extend the wageprice freeze to all dividends.\" 41 The Cost of Living Council put out guidelines on the subject; and at a news conference held September 28, 1971, Commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans reported that pledges had been obtained from all but 38 of 1,250 of the Nation's largest corporations to refrain from dividend increases during the freeze.42 In the case of profits, the Administration opposed the imposition of an excess profits tax. Profits were declining at the time anyway, and the Administration feared that a freeze on profits would discourage the capital investment needed to create new jobs.43 Even some Democratic economists like Gardner Ackley and Arthur Okun took a dim view of an excess profits tax.44 President Nixon's attitude was clear on this point. In his address to the Nation on \"White House press conference cited in note 26 above. The Credit Control Act of 1969 (Public Law 91—151) did authorize the President to delegate to the Federal Reserve Board authority to regulate interest rates as part of a credit control program, which may be instituted under certain circumstances. These circumstances require a Presidential determination that controls are necessary to prevent inflation generated by the extension of credit in an excessive volume. Such a determination did not appear to be justified under the conditions in the Summer of 1971. 89 Statement before the House Banking and Currency Committee, October 27, 1971. 40 Bureau of National Affairs, A Special Report, August 16, 1971. 41 \"The Challenge of Peace,\" August 15, 1971. 48 New York Times, September 29, 1971. 48 \"The Presidency—Recollections of Camp David,\" National Journal, September 18, 1971, p. 1934; \"Putting a Lid on Profits: Who Gets Squeezed?/' U.S. News and World Report, November 29, 1971, p. 551. 44 \"The Freeze: Planning for Thin Ice,\" Newsweek, September 13, 1971, p. 83 18 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM October 7, 1971, announcing his decisions on the postfreeze program, he explained why he would not fix limits on profits. . . . Many of my good friends in the field of politics have advised me that the only politically popular position to take is to be against profits. But let us recognize an unassailable fact of economic life. All Americans will benefit from more profits. More profits fuel the expansion that generates more jobs. More profits means more investment, which will make our goods more competitive in America and in the world. And more profits means there will be more tax revenue to pay for the programs that help people in need. That's why higher profits in the American economy would be good for every person in America. With the Government's putting a lid on wages and other costs, however, it was conceivable that in some circumstances exorbitant profits could be made. Rather than tax such excess or \"windfall\" profits, Nixon expected that under governmental policy in the Phase II program business \"should pass along a fair share of its cost savings by cutting prices.'*45 APPARATUS FOR ADMINISTERING THE FREEZE The Cost of Living Council By Executive Order 11615, the President established the Cost of Living Council (CLC) and delegated to it the authority conferred on him by the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970. The President designated Treasury Secretary John B. Connally to head the Council. A Texas Democrat, Connally had joined the Nixon Administration in February 1971 and soon emerged as the President's leading spokesman on the economy.46 Executive Order 11615 further designated a Special Assistant to the President to serve, under the direction of the Chairman, as Executive Director of the Council. The President appointed Arnold R. Weber to this job. A 42-year-old economist from the 45 See text of President Nixon's address in New York Times, October 8, 1971. Other members of the Council included the following: Dr. Paul W. McCracken, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, designated as Vice Chairman; Clifford M. Hardin, Secretary of Agriculture; Maurice H. Stans, Secretary of Commerce; James Hodgson, Secretary of Labor; George Romney, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; George P. Shultz, Director, Office of Management and Budget; George A. Lincoln, Director, Office of Emergency Preparedness; and Virginia H. Knauer, Special Assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs. Dr. Arthur F. Burns, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, was designated to serve as \"adviser\" to the Council. Executive Order 11615 inadvertently omitted the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from the Council's membership; this was corrected by Executive Order 11617, dated September 2, 1971. 46 19 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM University of Chicago, Weber had joined the Nixon Administration in January 1969 as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Manpower. In July 1970 he was appointed Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Weber was at the point of returning to his teaching post when he was recruited for the Council job. Along with the delegation of the President's powers under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, Executive Order 11615 specified the following responsibilities of the Council: a) Development and recommendation to the President of \"additional policies, mechanisms, and procedures to maintain economic growth without inflationary increases in prices, rents, wages, and salaries after the expiration of the 90-day period specified in Section I of this Order.\" b) Consultation with labor, industry, business, farm, and public representatives concerning the design of such policies, mechanisms, and procedures. c) Guidance in all its actions by \"the need to maintain consistency of price and wage policies with fiscal, monetary, international and other economic policies of the United States/' d) Informing the agricultural, industrial, and labor sectors and the public at large concerning \"the need of controlling inflation\" and encouraging and promoting voluntary action to that end. The Council was thus to be the policy body for the freeze program. It could define terms, make exceptions or exemptions, issue regulations or orders, and take other necessary actions. The Council was authorized to redelegate any of its authority and to call on other Federal or State agencies for help in administering the order. Further, the Council could require the maintenance of appropriate records or other evidence needed in carrying out the provisions of the Executive order and request the submission of such information for examination. To assist the Council in day-to-day policy and administrative decisions, Connally established an Executive Policy Committee (EPC) under the chairmanship of the Council's Vice Chairman, Dr. McCracken. Other members were Weber, George A. Lincoln, Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, and Charls E. Walker, Under Secretary of the Treasury. Meeting almost daily, EPC reviewed and resolved many policy issues and presented others to the Council for consideration in developing freeze policies and regulations. 20 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM OEP: The \"Operating Agency\" for CLC At the White House press conference on the evening of August 15, Connally mentioned the creation of the Council to supervise the freeze and the decision to \"delegate\" the administrative management task to the Office of Emergency Preparedness. The fact that OEP had only about 300 people in its employment, Connally emphasized, should make it evident that \"we don't anticipate that there is going to be any building up of any huge bureaucracy throughout the country\" to administer the freeze. \"It is a different animal entirely,\" he added, \"from wage-price controls as we normally speak in those terms.\" 47 OEP Director George A. Lincoln was spending the weekend on his ranch near Denver, Colorado, when he got word from the White House late on August 14 to return to Washington the following day. He came back in time to alert his staff and Regional Directors to the impending message from the President and the call to action. Thus, \"without warning,\" one periodical noted, \"President Nixon plucked the tiny agency out of the anonymity of the U.S. Government Organization Manual to supervise the wageprice freeze.\" 48 In the same vein, another periodical characterized the assignment of \"so vast and complex an undertaking\" to Lincoln and his \"tiny cadre of trouble-shooters,\" as a seemingly \"implausible piece of casting.\" The article continued: . . . The OEP is a flyspeck on the Federal table of organization—an obscure bureaucratic cranny with a meager staff (308) , a modest budget ($9.5 million) , an ancient headquarters (the Army of the Potomac used it during the Civil War) and only eight regional offices in all the wrong places (e.g., Olney, Md., Denton, Texas, and Maynard, Mass.) . Its expertise, moreover, consists mostly of directing recovery operations after hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes and making contingency plans for stabilizing the economy in case of nuclear war. Its directorship was once one of Washington's least glamorous jobs. But Mr. Nixon has grown fond of his man Lincoln, a retired Army brigadier general of 64 with an imposing personnel file (Rhodes scholar, West Point professor, co-author of five books) and a deceptively countrified manner. And OEP's lean, limber look obviously appealed to the President in contrast to the elephantine price-control bureaucracies of the World War II and Korean War eras.49 Addressing the National Association of Food Chains some three weeks after OEP's assumption of this management task, OEP Director Lincoln observed, \"I have . . . been asked why we are so charged.\" His response was as follows: . . . Perhaps by a process of elimination. We had the only economic stabilization planning mission in Government—for use in wartime. So we had a little capital. 47 White House press conference 48 Time, August 30, 1971. 49 cited in note 26 above. \"OEP: Disaster is Its Speciality,\" Newsxueek, August 30, 1971. 21 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM We are a part of the President's Executive Office. We are accustomed to calling on and coordinating the great Federal agencies in connection with natural disaster operations. We are accustomed to getting to the emergency situation quickly and, perhaps equally important, getting out quickly. We have no vested interest in staying with an emergency task after it is done.50 Lincoln had many years' experience as a national security specialist, defense economist, and military planner. He served in several strategic planning and military-political-economic assignments during and after World War II under Generals George C. Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower, and as an adviser to several Presidents and Secretaries of State and Defense. Just prior to his appointment as Director of OEP in January 1969, Lincoln retired from the Army. He came to OEP from the faculty of the U.S. Military Academy, where he had headed the Department of Social Sciences. In his capacity as Director of OEP, he was a statutory member of the National Security Council and assisted the President in coordinating the Federal response to economic crises and natural disasters, and in planning the national non-military defense efforts toward meeting contingencies ranging from limited war to all-out nuclear attack. Lincoln had gained a reputation as an able administrator. He developed a broader concept of OEP's mission in the area of preparedness for, and management of, emergencies involving the President and his Executive Office. This \"crisis management\" extended to actively involving OEP in current emergencies. Thus, by special Presidential assignment, Lincoln was charged with policy direction, coordination, and surveillance of the Nation's oil import program, with the advice of an interagency committee under his chairmanship. Similarly, he came to chair a Joint Board of Fuel Supply and Fuel Transport, which identified short-term energy fuels and power problems and coordinated Federal remedial action. Also, in the face of recurring rail strikes, Lincoln, under assignment from the President, developed the priorities to guide the Secretary of Transportation in allocating means of transportation and directing the movement of essential goods. OEP's effectiveness as a troubleshooter in these crisis situations unquestionably had an important bearing on the President's decision to charge the agency with the management of the freeze program. Over the years, too, the OEP's Economic Stabilization Division, under the leadership of Mr. Leonard A. Skubal, had been developing and coordinating government plans for maintaining and 50 Remarks before the National Association of Food Chains, September 8, 1971. 22 PRESIDENTS ECONOMIC PROGRAM stabilizing the civilian economy under emergency conditions. These plans included measures for both direct and indirect controls, draft legislation, the charting of the organizational structure, and preparations to staff it. The planning in the stabilization area, as in all other fields of the OEP mission, was in terms of three principal contingencies: international tension that would call for some tentative measures; so-called \"limited war\" mobilization; and general war, including massive nuclear attack. The OEP Economic Stabilization Division developed and refined general programs for direct stabilization controls in limited war situations, as well as preparedness capabilities for the administration of controls at State and local levels in nuclear attack situations. With the advice and assistance of consultants and advisory committees, OEP staffers developed concepts for standby controls in specific industries, with regulations tailored to their unique characteristics. Much was done to design the structure and plan for the manning and logistic support of the Economic Stabilization Agency proposed for activation in an emergency. The Division's plans contemplated a general freeze or stop order covering all prices, wages, salaries, and rents immediately upon the onset of a substantial mobilization, to be followed by the spot handling of urgent problems arising under the freeze and by the rapid development of standards for adjustments, exemptions, and refinements that would be required. The plans and programs that the Economic Stabilization Division had on hand had been prepared primarily upon the basis of wartime scenarios. They had only to be adapted to meet the needs of the non-mobilization situation in which they now were to be used. The advance work of the OEP planners, therefore, provided valid concepts that were useful from the outset.51 The Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers brought Skubal into the planning prior to the freeze. He served as a member of a task force that developed a number of papers reviewing and assessing U.S. and foreign experience with wage-price constraints, the peculiar set of factors which induced the President to create the Construction Industry 61 Enclosure to Memorandum, W.

The group also set out the major options in the form of guidelines with explicit criteria: a wage-price review board, a temporary freeze, selective industry actions, and general wage-price controls. For each of these options, they set forth their views on structure, implementation, required resources, anticipated operational problems, and probable effectiveness. In presenting the staffing requirements in connection with the basic options, the task force proposal ranged up to 13,000. The President, in choosing his options, settled on a Phase I staff of fewer than 4,000. Using OEP's preparedness concepts, Skubal made a useful contribution to the work of the task force in shaping the President's freeze program. He had a direct role in the design of stabilization regulations and in shaping some of the thinking that went into the organizational structuring and policies of the freeze and the postfreeze stabilization programs.52 OEP's activities in managing the freeze began immediately after the President's August 15th pronouncement. On August 17, the Cost of Living Council formally delegated to the Director of OEP \"responsibility and authority to implement, administer, monitor, and enforce the stabilization of prices, rents, wages and salaries,\" as directed by Section 1 of Executive Order 11615. Significant policy decisions were to be made only after consultation with the Council. Other departments and agencies were expected to provide necessary assistance, and the Director was authorized to redelegate administrative and operative functions relating to the implementation of the program.53 OEP was thus charged with managing the freeze. It was authorized to: 1) Provide overall management and direction from Washington for the operations based there and for field operations, generally through ten Regional Offices, which were to work in cooperation with 360 local offices of the Internal Revenue Services (IRS), Treasury Department, and 2,819 local offices of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), Department of Agriculture. 2) Develop, in conjunction with other Federal agencies, critical policy questions and issues and suggest to CLC the answers to these questions and issues. 82 Interviews with Leonard A.

The role of OEP in these mission areas will be the subject of subsequent chapters in this history. 25 Organization: Structure, Staffing, Support UNDERLYING CONCEPTS Four factors influenced the development of OEP organization and staffing arrangements for administering the wage-price-rent freeze: the nature of the task, the environment of the freeze, the resources available to do the job, and the Director's concept of crisis management. Nature of the Task OEP's mission was to administer a freeze on wages, salaries, prices, and rents; its principal task was to hold the line for 90 days while the Administration was preparing for the following stage. Although the freeze lacked the complexity of a system of detailed controls with provisions for extensive adjustments to changing economic conditions, its administration was still a massive undertaking. Moreover, the task was complicated by the continuing requirements of OEP's ongoing programs, some of which were too important to be shunted aside, even for a few days. Because of these other responsibilities, the Director wore two distinct operational hats: one as administrator of the freeze and the other as Director of OEP's regular programs. For this reason, he wanted OEP's organization and staffing arrangements during the 90-day freeze to reflect two major considerations: they had to expedite the achievement of freeze objectives, and they had to permit OEP's most important regular programs to continue without major interruptions. Environment of the Freeze Coming as it did in a period of relative international calm (and 26 ORGANIZATION not in the midst of a large-scale war or in the wake of a nuclear attack as contemplated in OEP's economic stabilization planning), the freeze had no rival for public attention. Of particular moment was the fact that it was the first time in the history of the United States that wages and prices had been frozen for reasons other than the economic dislocation caused by large-scale military procurement in wartime. The public generally welcomed the freeze as a positive step by the President to come to grips with the continuing problems of inflation. Support of the program, however, was not unanimous. Spokesmen for organized labor, who had been urging the President to impose direct controls on the economy, claimed that the freeze imposed inequitable sacrifices on working people. The reaction of some Governors, mayors, and other political leaders was influenced by considerations of how the freeze would affect their particular responsibilities and constituents. The media saw the freeze as the outstanding news event of the year and reacted accordingly. Everyone—business leaders, labor spokesmen, Congressmen, government officials, small businessmen, landlords, tenants, school teachers, housewives, and reporters—looked to Lincoln and his small agency for answers to their questions about the freeze. Many of the questions that deluged OEP on August 16 and the next few days reflected concern over the unequal impact of the freeze on individuals and different sectors of the economy. The complex U.S. economy is constantly changing and the freeze unavoidably caught some individuals, businesses, and industries in a less advantageous position than others. The freezing of this imbalance for 90 days inevitably produced inequities and hardships.1 Since the success of the freeze depended largely on voluntary compliance, it was imperative that the public be strongly encouraged to continue to support the freeze despite the uneven hardships resulting from it. An immediate and overriding task was to convince the public that the freeze was necessary to the economic health of the Nation and that it would be administered fairly, consistently, and effectively. Lincoln saw his part of this task mainly in terms of: rapidly developing rules more specific than the generalities in the legislation and Executive order; quickly disseminating information about the freeze to the public; encouraging voluntary compliance; receiving, investigating, and forwarding complaints of noncompliance; and placing pressure on those who did not comply voluntarily. 1 See pp. 97-98, 115-116. 27 ORGANIZATION Resources Available for the Task Because of the President's opposition to building up a large bureaucracy, Lincoln knew he would have to achieve the desired public impact and other aspects of his mission with the resources of his small agency, supplemented by the resources available to him as a member of the President's staff. These resources were substantial. With the cloak of Presidential authority, Lincoln's strength was not measured by the small number of people in his agency; it was measured by the size of the mission assigned him and by the resources which he could draw from the departments and other agencies of the U.S. Government. During the first few days of the freeze, Lincoln tapped this vast Federal reservoir and soon found that it would supply the resources needed to supplement those of his own agency. Even the resources of his own agency were more valuable than its small size might indicate to the casual observer. Among his staff of some 300 persons (professional and clerical) were many with extensive experience in coordinating and managing government programs to cope with wartime emergencies, natural disasters, rail strikes, national fuel and power shortages, and other crises. Some staff professionals were specialists in particular areas, but most were generalists, able to operate effectively in crisis situations of varying kinds. Further, the agency and its staff were experienced in working with members of other Federal agencies as a team in planning for and reacting to emergency situations and had a clearly defined and periodically exercised cross-agency emergency network. OEP had an Operations Center and a communications system which were immediately modified to cope with the new demands put upon them. Finally, OEP's small field organization was highly experienced in interagency coordination, in dealing with State and local governments, and in adapting to emergencies. The situation had required the President to depend on an existing agency to administer the freeze—one that could start operating on the day following his declaration. Fortunately, OEP proved to be such an agency. As Lincoln expressed it, \"When the freeze hit, OEP was already an operating outfit, and I was confident that my people could do the job/' 2 Lincoln's Concept of Crisis Management During his 2i/£ years as Director, Lincoln had oriented OEP 2 Lincoln, interview with OEP historical staff, February 3, 1972. 28 ORGANIZATION toward an operational approach that emphasized quick conversion of activities and resources from a normal to a crisis footing and had developed a staff trained and experienced in his concept of crisis management. He had come to believe that effective management of a crisis situation depends on action consistent with certain principles. Briefly, these principles are: 1. Make your mission in the crisis the central guide to your actions—focus on the objective. 2. Respond to the crisis quickly and positively and keep the action moving—don't let the workload pile up—stay up on the power curve. 3. Keep the future open as long as you can; don't limit your operations or field of maneuver until you have to. 4. Make your administration fair, consistent, and credible to the public. 5. Exercise central control and establish single, direct lines of control over the resources under your direct command. 6. Delegate to other agencies responsibility for managing their own applicable resources while maintaining a strong coordinating role over the use of these resources. 7. Delegate responsibility for routine matters to lower echelons when feasible. 8. Keep organizational changes to a minimum, making only those necessary to accommodate important changes in your mission—adapt what exists rather than trying to create something new. 9. Provide for effective coordination at all echelons. Teamwork is the key to success. Stress routine lateral coordination as well as that emanating from higher levels. 10. Dispatch immediately all information to everyone who needs it. 11. Insure continuous, reliable, and fast feedback from your operations. Follow up quickly to avert bottlenecks and crises. 12. As the one in charge, keep yourself free to orchestrate the entire operation—don't get mired down in details. Lincoln's implementation of these concepts of crisis management will be noted from time to time in this and succeeding chapters of the history. NATIONAL OFFICE ORGANIZATION Lincoln's task was complicated by his continuing responsibility for a wide range of functions other than the freeze. OEP's normal 29 ORGANIZATION role includes: developing policy, plans, and programs to deal with wartime emergencies, certain peacetime crises, and natural disasters; coordinating and guiding the activities of Federal agencies in preparing for and dealing with these emergency and crisis situations, including plans for continuity of government and for resource management; and, in the case of natural disasters, managing the President's Disaster Relief Fund. The Director of OEP also has major responsibilities involving oil import policy and related energy problems, stockpiles of strategic and critical materials, and industrial mobilization planning, as well as those flowing from his membership on the National Security Council. To carry out these responsibilities, Lincoln had developed a headquarters organization with command lines and functional assignments as shown in Figure 1. This organization had served him well, and he wanted the freeze to disturb it as little as possible. In his opinion sudden and drastic organizational changes confuse the staff, confuse the many Federal agencies with routine relationships with OEP, and result in lost motion. Also, he foresaw that the full impact of OEP's new mission and the resources needed to carry it out would not be clear for several days. Meanwhile, he wanted to avoid precipitate actions that would narrow his field of maneuver. At the same time, Lincoln recognized that OEP's normal organization was not adequate for administering the freeze. He was also aware that OEP's prior planning for economic stabilization, while valuable in several respects, did not offer a ready solution to his organizational problem, particularly at the national level. This planning had been directed toward a wartime situation, either nuclear or limited, and contemplated establishment of an Office of Defense Resources (ODR) at the apex of a system of control agencies (including an Economic Stabilization Agency) superimposed on the regular Federal structure.3 Such a system would take months to activate. Lincoln needed an immediate solution, and he decided for the moment to solve his problem by setting up a provisional organization to keep things under control while a more suitable organization was being devised in the light of emerging developments. The provisional freeze organization with which OEP set forth on August 16 was roughly its regular organization, with important changes. One of the first and most important of these changes was *See Office of Defense Resources, Resource Mobilization for Limited War, July 1966, and the Manual for Regional Emergency Operations, Economic Stabilization Agency, August 1969. 30 FIGURE 1 OFFICE OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS DIRECTOR Deputy Director ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ASSISTANT DIRECTOR ASST.

The Operations Office dispatched messages and directives to the field and received inquiries, reports, and requests for assistance from the field. The office processed these messages to OEP staff divisions and appropriate Federal agencies, and followed up to assure rapid response. In the first 2 weeks of the freeze, this office also handled direct inquiries from the public. Another important and early change was the reordering of OEP's priorities to give prime emphasis to the wage-price stabilization mission, while continuing with minimal disruption certain essential activities. The natural disaster, oil policy, and stockpile activities were carried on at essentially prefreeze levels; but all other activities were subordinated to the freeze. This reordering of priorities made most OEP personnel available temporarily for staffing the new freeze functions. At the same time, since the regular organization was not radically altered, some staff members could conveniently devote part of their time to OEP's continuing functions. The freeze had been under way only a few days when it became evident that further organizational changes were needed in the National Office. Lincoln asked the Deputy Director, Mr. Darrell M. Trent,5 to give his personal attention to the matter and propose the necessary changes. By August 21 the situation had developed sufficiently to delineate the substantive activities involved in managing the freeze: overall management and operational direction; participation in policy formulation and rulemaking; responding to questions on the application and interpretation of policy; processing requests for exceptions and exemptions; informing the public of freeze policies and procedures and gaining public understanding and support of the freeze; enforcing compliance with freeze policies, rules, and directives; and monitoring, reporting, and recording the progress of the freeze. 4 This office was headed by Mr. Eugene Quindlen, who had directed Government Preparedness activities since the inception of OEP. His 30 years of Federal servicemost of it in the fields of government preparedness, program planning, and evaluation activities—included active duty as an officer in the U.S. Army (1942-46) and assignments with the Office of Emergency Preparedness, the Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization, the Federal Civil Defense Administration, the Veterans Administration, and the Federal Security Agency. 5 Trent became Deputy Director of OEP in August 1970, while continuing to serve as Executive Secretary of the President's Property Review Board, a post he was appointed to in April 1970. Over the previous year he had served as Deputy Assistant to the President, with policy responsibilities involving development and coordination of domestic affairs programs and with responsibility for White House liaison with certain Federal agencies, including OEP. 32 ORGANIZATION It was apparent by this time that other Federal agencies would support OEP by assigning high-caliber personnel to help administer the freeze. It had also been agreed that the Internal Revenue Service and the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service would become part of the field structure, as discussed below. The organizational structure that Trent proposed reflected these developments.6 It also reflected an awareness of Lincoln's concept of crisis management and of his directive that certain of OEP's day-to-day missions continue with minimum disruption. Lincoln approved the new organization on August 21, 1971; with a few minor changes this organization remained in effect throughout the freeze. The organization for economic stabilization activities is shown in Figure 2. Natural disaster personnel continued their normal duties relatively undisturbed by the freeze, although they did have to move their quarters to another building to make room for Federal agency personnel brought into the OEP National Office. Their duties kept them fully occupied throughout the freeze period, for during that period the President declared seven major disaster areas in the United States. The impact of the freeze on the Resource Analysis Office, headed by Mr. William C. Truppner,7 varied from activity to activity. As indicated above, the Oil and Energy and Stockpile Policy activities continued without substantial interruption. Most of the remainder of Resource Analysis personnel participated actively in the freeze, although some were able to continue at least part of their normal duties. The Office of Resource Evaluation, called the Policy Questions Office during the freeze, drafted policy statements for consideration by CLC and produced the Stabilization Program Guidelines. The Office of Information and Analysis created a computer-based reporting system to facilitate OEP management of the freeze and keep CLC apprised of freeze developments. The Economic Stabilization Division was temporarily transferred from the Government Preparedness Office to 'Trent was assisted by J.
