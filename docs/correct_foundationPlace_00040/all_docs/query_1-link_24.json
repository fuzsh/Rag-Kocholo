        "text": "VANCOUVER, B.C. – The BC Cancer Foundation announced the largest charitable bequest to a single beneficiary in B.C.’s history today. William P. J. McCarthy, businessman and grandson of the late John Jambor and creator and executor of his estate plan, gifted an astounding $21.4 million in the Jambor-McCarthy legacy to the BC Cancer Foundation.\n\nThe momentous gift will help to further the BC Cancer Agency’s position as a world leader in cancer research and care. In keeping with the tenets John Jambor lived by, and enunciated by William McCarthy —work hard, live well, give back—this legacy will support the dedicated work of researchers at the BC Cancer Agency Research Centre and care providers at the Agency’s five Centres throughout the province to enable more British Columbians to live well.\n\nJohn Jambor came to Canada with little beyond his dreams, work ethic and faith. Over the course of a lifetime, he realized the Canadian dream. His love for his adopted country inspired his future philanthropy and led to this lasting legacy.\n\nInspired by his grandparents’ commitment to give back, McCarthy is honoured to provide the BC Cancer Foundation with the largest charitable bequest to a single beneficiary in B.C.’s history.\n\n“I worked alongside my grandfather from childhood,” said McCarthy. “He was the greatest man I’ll ever know. Together, we developed the Jambor-McCarthy legacy and I’m proud to see this gift flourish into a fitting tribute to my grandfather and the Jambor family. This gift fulfills the promise they made to their new country.”\n\nThe gift will improve the long-term health and wellness of tens-of-thousands of cancer patients across the province. Douglas Nelson, President & CEO of the BC Cancer Foundation said, “The BC Cancer Foundation is honoured to be a part of John Jambor’s philanthropic legacy. Together, John Jambor and William McCarthy created a true legacy that will accelerate the most promising research initiatives at the BC Cancer Agency and in-turn inspire British Columbians to consider supporting our efforts to reach a world free from cancer.”\n\nThe Jambor-McCarthy legacy will enable the cancer research enterprise in B.C. to take great leaps forward for the benefit of patients and their families across the province. The gift will accelerate the world-renowned research taking place at the BC Cancer Agency and provide lasting support for enhanced education.\n\n“We are incredibly grateful to be the beneficiaries of this significant gift,” said Brian Schmidt, interim president at the BC Cancer Agency. “On behalf of the BC Cancer Agency I’d like to thank the Jambor-McCarthy family for their ongoing support in helping the BC Cancer Agency find the causes of cancer, as well as to discover better treatments for prolonged and improved quality of life.”\n\nJambor’s commitment to the BC Cancer Foundation and work of the BC Cancer Agency began decades ago. He established the Jambor Knowledge Fund with $1 million in the mid 1980’s. This fund has supported cancer research and education, directly benefitting over 600 British Columbian cancer caregivers, over the span of two decades, by enhancing their knowledge and skills.\n\nAndrea Wolowski is a past recipient of support from the original Jambor Knowledge Fund, which has allowed her to excel in her career. “I’m forever grateful to John Jambor for his foresight and investment in the future of cancer care in this province. The Jambor-McCarthy legacy announced today will provide opportunities to enhance our knowledge of cancer over the years to come, and is sure to improve the lives of our patients.” Wolowski is the Director of Clinical Operations for Radiation Therapy at the BC Cancer Agency’s Centre for the North, which is scheduled to open for patient care in late 2012.\n\nTo learn more about leaving a legacy gift to the BC Cancer Foundation, we welcome you to visit bccancerfoundation.com/LegacyGiving\n\n– 30-\n\nFor more information, please contact:"
