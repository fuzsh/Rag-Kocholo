        "text": "Help us make a difference in the lives of children and\n\nfamilies with complex challenges\n\nThe Children’s Foundation assists client families with urgent needs such as food, housing, clothing, transportation, utilities, and childcare. We help families be successful and resolve emergency issues that might otherwise interfere with their ability to take part in the programs and services they are participating in. You can make your donation using the button below:\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer the mail-in option, you can contact us at donation@childrens-foundation.org with your information and we will send a prepaid envelope to your address.\n\nOur donors truly help make a difference in improving the lives of children in our community. 100% of the money donated goes directly to helping children and families.\n\nAlderwood Family DEVELOPMENT CENTRE\n\nis celebrating 20 years of service to families in our community.\n\nThat is 240 months, 1,040 weeks, 7,300 days, 175,200 hours, 10,512,000 minutes and counting!\n\nService milestones are a time for reflection, gratitude and connection. We would like to thank the children, families and staff who have been part of our learning journey. Join us in celebrating one of our many stories.\n\nThe Children’s Foundation Statement on Anti-Racism:\n\nThrough education we will strive to recognize, address and eradicate all forms of racism and ethnic oppression in our day to day work.\n\nThe Children’s Foundation recognizes that our learning, work and play takes place on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish peoples in Vancouver: the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish), səl̓ilw̓ətaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh); in Surrey, Langley, New Westminster and White Rock: the Semiahmoo, q̓íc̓əy̓ (Katzie), Kwantlen, Qayqayt, and Tsawwassen First Nations; and in the Tri-Cities: the kʷikʷəƛ̓əm (Kwikwetlem). We are grateful and indebted to the Indigenous Peoples of these nations who have, and continue to care for these lands.\n\nAs a non-profit social and community service organization, we recognize the roots of oppression embedded in colonialism and patriarchy. We acknowledge that we were complicit in the provision of care to indigenous children through residential and fostering services. We recognize the use of coercive and discriminatory policies and laws as a tool to continue the oppression of marginalized groups. We acknowledge the ingrained and systemic racism and xenophobia that has existed and continues to breathe throughout institutions, government structures, non-profit and for-profit organizations. We stand with Indigenous, Black and People of Colour.\n\nA land acknowledgement is only a start to the required ongoing and intentional work of learning, unlearning, listening and reflecting. It is the work of those who are settlers and those who are privileged to take initiative and ownership for their antiracist learning and allyship. As we engage in individual and organizational exploration and examination of implicit bias and systemic oppression that our families and staff face, we will commit to the below actions.\n\nWe commit to do the work of antiracism by:\n\n1. Building our relationship with our local Indigenous communities in a way that supports trust and healing.\n\n2. Learning through and applying the Aboriginal Practice and Policy Framework through all levels of the organization, as created by the Aboriginal Policy and Practice Working Group.\n\n3. Recognizing the impact of colonial practice and more importantly, its disruption, by centering the experiences of Indigenous Peoples and learning from Indigenous knowledge and practices; to increase accountability and solidarity with Indigenous Peoples.\n\n4. Reflecting in our recruitment and employment practices the knowledge that we are stronger, mission aligned and more impactful, when, at all organizational levels, our staff are representative of the diversity of the individuals and families that we serve. We will prioritize diversity, equity and inclusion by recognizing and valuing a wide variety of life and work experiences and learnings along with academic achievements.\n\n5. Reviewing, modifying and updating relevant organizational policies, program names and other practices to best live diversity, equity and inclusion within our agency. We will strongly promote antiracist behavior and communication with and between staff, volunteers and those we support.\n\n6. Developing and implementing strategies and best-practices that aim to dismantle racism within all aspects of our agency and communities that we serve.\n\n7. Exploring, identifying and acknowledging our own historical involvement in the provision of residential and fostercare services.\n\n8. Reporting annually on our antiracism progress and commitments.\n\nIt is with deep sadness that we, like other British Columbians, learned about the heartbreaking discovery of the remains of 215 Indigenous children found at the former Tk’emlúps Indian Residential School. Our deepest and most sincere condolences go out to the families of the children and to all those whose lives and communities have been closely affected by this discovery. The impact of this tragedy is vast, and our hearts are with all Indigenous children, families, and staff at The Children’s Foundation. In difficult times, it is even more important to lift each other up and continue our healing and learning journey together. We must remain committed to our efforts to decolonize our practices and continue to strive for justice and equality. Children are our greatest resource and represent the future of our communities and humanity. This tragedy reminds us that we are accountable for the horrific crimes and the genocide that took place and continues to impact Indigenous peoples and our communities. As an agency that serves children and families we are committed to continuing to learn and keep ourselves accountable to the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s final report.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 outbreak in our province, our programming procedures have changed. We now offer many of our services remotely through telephone and video conferencing. Other programs such as our summer programs for children have additional safety protocols in place. Your counsellor will inform you of these procedures when you receive service. We realize that this may be a stressful time for you and your family and we will do all we can to assist.\n\nWe continue to accept referrals as before. If you are uncertain about whom to contact, please call the office at 604-434-9101 and we will direct you to the appropriate person.\n\nThank you for your understanding during this time.\n\nClick here for more information about our services at this time\n\nClick here for a list of community resources for COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe Children’s Foundation has helped thousands of children since 1957\n\nIn the late 1940’s and early 1950’s a group of citizens lead by Esther Irwin had grown concerned about children who were not being successful at school and who often did not attend. They realized that without support and assistance, these children were not likely to have a successful outcome as they grew to adulthood. Over a period of ten years they met and planned how to address this issue. In 1957 they incorporated a charitable, non-profit society from the current location in Vancouver and began to help these children and their families. Since that time, The Children’s Foundation has helped thousands of vulnerable children and their families to better lives."
