As per Canada Revenue Agency Guidelines, Canuck Place’s responsibility is to ensure that official donation receipts are only issued to donors for the eligible amount of the gift. This means organizers of an event cannot claim a tax receipt for donations made by the public because the organizers are not the original donor. Only the original donors can claim a tax receipt.\n\nEvent expenses may not be deducted from tax-receiptable donations.\n\nAll donations requiring a tax receipt must be received in full by Canuck Place. Canuck Place will not reimburse you for any expenses incurred; all financial control is the responsibility of the event organizer. Canuck Place is dedicated to being fiscally responsible and we recommend that your event expenses not exceed 20 per cent of the total event revenue.\n\nIf you haven’t received your tax receipt, or if you need a duplicate copy issued, please contact [email protected]\n\nOur charitable registration #13386 7523 RR0001.\n\nMore than 164 students, working professionals, stay-at-home parents, and retirees volunteer for Canuck Place.

Please note, all applicants, regardless of role, must be at least 16 years of age and fully vaccinated (i.e. at least 2 shots) against Covid-19.\n\nCanuck Place children and families currently on program or receiving services are not eligible to engage in volunteer opportunities.\n\nShould a child currently on program or family member receiving services wish to explore other family engagement opportunities with Canuck Place, and/or learn more about ways to get involved or “give back”, information can be accessed through our Family Engagement page.\n\nChildren who have graduated from the Canuck Place Program and/or family members who have received services in the past may choose to come forward and apply to volunteer their time, after a minimum of one year has passed since receiving services, or minimum four years after the child has died for bereaved family members\n\nAll volunteer applicants, including bereaved family members, must successfully complete the Canuck Place screening/interview and application process in order to be considered for volunteer roles. In cases where an applicant has been on program or was a family member receiving services, The Volunteer & Support Services team will confirm end dates of service in the Canuck Place clinical database/health record. All volunteer roles are filled at the discretion of Volunteer & Support Services team. Should a former patient or family member successfully complete the volunteer application process, it is important to consider that as a Canuck Place volunteer, the relationship with the organization and its stakeholders (staff, families, volunteers and donors) will look differently than that of a family member receiving services. Although personal experiences can uniquely enhance volunteer roles, Canuck Place Volunteer & Support Services are responsible to ensure that volunteers (regardless of personal experience) put the needs of children and families on program first. Volunteer & Support Services staff reserve the right to accept or decline volunteer applicants, regardless of previous experience, based on screening and assessing suitability throughout the application and selection process.\n\nCompanies and organizations can volunteer at Canuck Place.
