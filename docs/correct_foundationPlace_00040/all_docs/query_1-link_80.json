We provide quality, affordable rental homes so families and individuals can thrive, ensuring successful tenancies, safety and well-being of tenants through effective operations, maintenance and repair of the buildings. We recognize that the concept of affordable housing is much greater than bricks and mortar. We want our tenants to experience a lasting and meaningful impact with individuals and families in the homes we manage and operate. We focus on serving the needs of the people who live in our buildings. In collaboration with BC Housing and Metro Vancouver municipalities, S.U.C.C.E.S.S., through out Housing entities, operates and manages more than 1,160 affordable housing units across 10 locations in Burnaby, Richmond and Vancouver. New locations are under development in Burnaby and Vancouver, which will add over 450 units of low income and affordable housing to the market for tenants to rent. We will continue to work with current partners and stakeholders, and look forward to developing new partnerships to increase the number of affordable housing units in the region."
