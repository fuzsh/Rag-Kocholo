        "text": "The Software Report is pleased to announce The Top 100 Software Companies of 2021. This year’s awardee list is comprised of a wide range of companies from the most well-known such as Microsoft, Adobe, and Salesforce to the relatively newer but rapidly growing - Qualtrics, Atlassian, and Asana. A good number of awardees may be new names to some but that should be no surprise given software has always been an industry of startups that seemingly came out of nowhere to create and dominate a new space.\n\nSoftware has become the backbone of our economy. From large enterprises to small businesses, most all rely on software whether for accounting, marketing, sales, supply chain, or a myriad of other functions. Software has become the dominant industry of our time and as such, we place a significance on highlighting the best companies leading the industry forward.\n\nThe following awardees were nominated and selected based on a thorough evaluation process. Among the key criteria considered were software product quality, management team caliber, organizational culture and overall company evolution among other factors. In many cases, a company received a remarkable number of nominations from a wide range of its various stakeholders. Please join us in recognizing and celebrating The Top 100 Software Companies of 2021.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nCategory: Business Solutions\n\nLocation: Redmond, Washington\n\nMicrosoft is the biggest software company in the world. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. LinkedIn, its business-oriented social network, is used by millions to build professional connections, and Microsoft's Xbox gaming systems continue to post record sales. Microsoft's customers range from consumers and small businesses to the world's biggest companies and government agencies.\n\nIn 1975 Bill Gates and Paul Allen, two boyhood friends from Seattle, launched the company in order to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. Microsoft quickly rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Microsoft Windows. In the 1990s, the company began to redefine its offerings and expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web. Eventually Microsoft also moved into cloud computing with the Windows Azure platform. Azure is currently second behind Amazon for cloud services.\n\nIn June 2021 the software maker hit a staggering $2 trillion valuation. The milestone came on the heels of the company’s unveiling of Windows 11, its first new version of the flagship operating system in more than five years. The appreciation of the company’s stock price also reflects a rejuvenated company, one that has found substantial growth in cloud computing and through acquisitions.\n\n2. Adobe\n\nCategory: Publishing\n\nLocation: San Jose, California\n\nAs one of the top software providers in the world, tech giant Adobe serves millions of users across the globe. From its humble beginnings in 1982, the company is mostly known these days for its multimedia and creativity software offerings.

As its name implies, the use of VMware, or \"Virtual Machine\" ware, creates a virtual machine that allows businesses to run multiple application and operating system workloads on one server, reducing IT costs while increasing the flexibility of the computing environment. VMware has proven particularly suitable for new businesses that are growing quickly. Over the years, VMware's employees and ecosystem of 75,000 partners have been behind technology innovations transforming a wide array of industries, including banking, healthcare, retail, telecommunications, manufacturing, and even government.\n\nFounded in 1998, the company is known worldwide for its vSphere VMware Hypervisor, which enables the virtualization of practically any x86 or x64 architecture. VMware was the first commercially successful company to virtualize the x86 architecture. In 2004 the company was acquired by EMC (which was later acquired by Dell in 2016), and since these acquisitions, many more products have been added to the VMware inventory. The company now has a major presence in private data centers, cloud management services, virtualized storage, networking, and desktop software. As businesses promote digitization with a push for remote working, VMware's offerings become even more valuable. The company's revenue rose from $9.6 billion to $11.8 billion between 2018 and 2020.\n\n29.
