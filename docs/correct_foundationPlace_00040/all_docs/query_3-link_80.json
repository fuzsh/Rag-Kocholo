        "text": "MXRider-ALL, my apologies if saw part this post/thread yesterday, as I continually have computer issues never had anywhere before in US or World at large, and oddly there have been numerous Power “outages-spikes” and ISP “issues” region US I live! (Oddly, veteran I know has had several of their doctor’s office’s computers affected by this. PER US Army EBO- if an “entity” wants to generate “massive” data loss or “excuse” erase massive amounts of data all at once, all this said “entity” would have to do is in fact create these issues on large scale all at once or over time!?!?)\n\nMXRider, I am in fact trying to take your advice, and get the issue with “unsecured” medication bottles Express Script’s “Tricare/ Commercial(??)” taken care of by filling local pharmacy but will sadly have to pay the “co-pay” but worth it for personal “security!” Should not be this way. But apparently what one must do. Sadly, I believe both the present and past US Administration’s have tried to make things better for US Combat Veteran’s and veterans in general- our US “human resource” “national treasure” for all knowledge, etc.. they ALL “collectively” contain on numerous issues, and their contributions to US Society, at large, from the US Revolutionary War to the present never-ending “conflicts!”!\n\nSadly, I am yet again left more confused by Express Scripts, and perhaps there are those highly knowledgeable this web site who can clarify….\n\nI called Express Scripts, yet again, and spoke phone “operator-agent” at Express Scripts, Sean. Sean, told me he, himself, utilizes Express Scripts and personally had no issue’s receiving “unsecured both inside and outside” medication bottles, and that he had never heard of an “Express Scripts Commercial”- humph??? Sean transferred me to a “pharmacist” by name of Deborah, and Deborah gave me “same old song and dance” as previous pharmacist Sevia(sp?)!!!!!\n\nErgo MXRider, despite not wishing to, am simply following your advice as at some point the “deep-state” of things just does not warrant the “frustration” and rise in “blood-pressure!”\n\nOddly, I did some Internet research on this topic, and despite not being able to find “exact” US Government regulation’s on “shipping” of medication below is some of what I did find, those much smarter than myself might find interesting regarding this issue:\n\nhttps://mederxonline.com/category/p...les-and-regulations-for-physician-dispensing/ - “Category Archives: Rules and Regulations” By Mederxonline | Physician Dispensing Articles, Rules and Regulations | No Comments\n\nhttp://www.rxscan.com/documents/contentdocuments/document_23_5_28.pdf - “Overview of the Regulations and Recommendations made by various organizations and state licensing boards concerning the handling of Drug Samples by physician offices and clinics” (See attached file “document_23_5_28” downloaded this web-address 09 JUN 2018)\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ - “Guidance, Compliance, & Regulatory Information” From US FDA Website\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm252671.htm - “Drug Compliance Programs” From US FDA Website\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/downloads/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/ComplianceProgramManual/UCM125411.pdf - “SUBJECT: DRUG REPACKAGERS AND RELABELER” (See attached file “Drug Repack-Relabel CPGM 7356 002B_ORA_LAO-NM 9-10-15 Final” from this link accessed 09 JUN 2018)\n\nhttp://academy.gmp-compliance.org/guidemgr/files/1-1-1.PDF - “21 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 210 and 211” by U.S. Food And Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (See file “1-1-1” downloaded this web address 09 JUN 2018)\n\nFor those interested the below is excerpt from http://academy.gmp-compliance.org/guidemgr/files/1-1-1.PDF - “21 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 210 and 211”\n\n“§ 211.132 Tamper-resistant packaging requirements for over-the-counter (OTC) human drug products.\n\n(a) General. The Food and Drug Administration has the authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) to establish a uniform national requirement for tamper-resistant packaging of OTC drug products that will improve the security of OTC drug packaging and help assure the safety and effectiveness of OTC drug products. An OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or throat lozenge product) for retail sale that is not packaged in a tamper-resistant package or that is not properly labeled under this section is adulterated under section 501 of the act or misbranded under section 502 of the act, or both.\n\n(b) Requirement for tamper-resistant package. Each manufacturer and packer who packages an OTC drug product (except a dermatological, dentifrice, insulin, or throat lozenge product) for retail sale shall package the product in a tamper-resistant package, if this product is accessible to the public while held for sale. A tamper-resistant package is one having one or more indicators or barriers to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be expected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. To reduce the likelihood of successful tampering and to increase the likelihood that consumers will discover if a product has been tampered with, the package is required to be distinctive by design (e.g., an aerosol product container) or by the use of one or more indicators or barriers to entry that employ an identifying characteristic (e.g., a pattern, name, registered trademark, logo, or picture). For purposes of this section, the term \"distinctive by design ''means the packaging cannot be duplicated with commonly available materials or through commonly available processes. For purposes of this section, the term \"aerosol product'' means a product which depends upon the power of a liquified or compressed gas to expel the contents from the container. A tamper-resistant package may involve an immediate-container and closure system or secondary- container or carton system or any combination of systems intended to provide a visual indication of package integrity. The tamper- resistant feature shall be designed to and shall remain intact when handled in a reasonable manner during manufacture, distribution, and retail display.”\n\nWell seeing as this all I could find, I wonder why, if perhaps “more restrictive’ on OTC Medication “packaging security” why the same or more “restrictive regulations” apply to those medication being shipped by Express Scripts and the US DVA! As IAW pharmacist Deborah, the USPS packing alone “is” the “security” seal…. humph...??????\n\nFinally think I owe an explanation as to leaving off last thread above with “LOL”! I did this, but once again tried to explain but could not “computer issues” as I would not personally wear a “tin-foil” hat and think it is not in fact “appropriate” humor to “joke” about those veterans and “civilians” whom possibly do….!!! Furthermore, they are now making “Dirty EMF” clothing and hat’s, etc.. to shield one from these adverse effects! Anyway others can be the judge about this see: http://gulfcoastnewstoday.com/stories/gulf-coast-media-newspapers-win-7-alabama-press-awards,62809 accessed 09 JUN 2018 and below images copied from this web-address-\n\n(If anyone has questions regarding “humor” in article “The Truth is out there, Baldwin County” at web-address: http://gulfcoastnewstoday.com/baldwin-times/stories/the-truth-is-out-there-baldwin-county,62694 accessed 09 JUN 2018 and mentioned in previous post/tread they can contact author Cliff McCollum at email: [email protected] )\n\nAlso, per Jason Perry thread- titled “Continuing In The Same Branch” (not contradicting anything simply utilizing title) I think a lot of folks in US General Public at Large forget that one can still serve their country in other capacities or even “wounded warriors” in military in “other capacity” within military, without serving in the US Military and have “disabilities” that are fully accommodated for in those other “capacities” …. I think the YouTube video from movie “300” kind of explains this- see YouTube video “The Art of No Compromises” courtesy YouTube Video at web-address: View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwK3VkbxLLU\n\nOne will note King “Leonidas” lets’ this individual down with both “courtesy and respect” and more importantly fully explains to them “WHY” and that there are many other useful things they can in fact do in support of the “300!” or in support of “SPARTA!”\n\nMXRider-ALL- hope this helps, and hopefully someone can assist myself in making “heads or tails” of the confusion Express Scripts has in fact added recently to this issue of “unsecure medication bottles”- perhaps…?????\n\nOr perhaps it is just as per the band “Dead or Alive” sings “You Spin Me right Round” at YouTube video “Dead Or Alive - You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) (Official Video)” courtesy YouTube and YouTube video web-address: View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNiXGX2nLU\n\nThanks, ALL-and hopefully get a very “erudite” response some of folks much more “educated” in these things than myself as am simply very confused!\n\nAttachments\n\nArticle Gulf Coast Media newspapers win 7 Alabama Press awards Posted Tuesday, May 29, 2018 12...jpg\n\n1-1-1.PDF\n\nDrug Repack-Relabel CPGM 7356 002B_ORA_LAO-NM 9-10-15 Final.pdf\n\ndocument_23_5_28.pdf\n\nMXRider-All- thought would follow up from above Thread/Post (see below from above post all in [] below line):\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n[MXRider, I am in fact trying to take your advice, and get the issue with “unsecured” medication bottles Express Script’s “Tricare/ Commercial(??)” taken care of by filling local pharmacy but will sadly have to pay the “co-pay” but worth it for personal “security!” Should not be this way.

As IAW pharmacist Deborah, the USPS packing alone “is” the “security” seal…. humph...??????]\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMIXRider-All- as stated many times a picture is worth a “THOUSAND WORDS” so a veteran I know in Gulf Coast Region of Baldwin County Alabama allowed me to post pictures of all sorts mail issues they are having more than routinely and have tried to fix via writing elected officials, the US Postal service IG, as well as local “postmasters,” etc….\n\nAs one can see in above images theses “packages” were delivered “virtually” and in “reality” destroyed!!! Is this acceptable???? The penalty for “TAMPERING” with the mail, quoted below from web-address: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1708 -“Cornell Law School- Legal Information Institute- 18 U.S. Code § 1708 - Theft or receipt of stolen mail matter generally”\n\n“Whoever steals, takes, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception obtains, or attempts so to obtain, from or out of any mail, post office, or station thereof, letter box, mail receptacle, or any mail route or other authorized depository for mail matter, or from a letter or mail carrier, any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or abstracts or removes from any such letter, package, bag, or mail, any article or thing contained therein, or secretes, embezzles, or destroys any such letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein; or\n\nWhoever steals, takes, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception obtains any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein which has been left for collection upon or adjacent to a collection box or other authorized depository of mail matter; or\n\nWhoever buys, receives, or conceals, or unlawfully has in his possession, any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein, which has been so stolen, taken, embezzled, or abstracted, as herein described, knowing the same to have been stolen, taken, embezzled, or abstracted—\n\nShall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\n(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 779; May 24, 1949, ch. 139, § 39, 63 Stat. 95; July 1, 1952, ch. 535, 66 Stat. 314; Pub. L. 103–322, title XXXIII, § 330016(1)(I), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)”\n\nAs one can clearly see, in this individual’s case is more than not, likely being applied!\n\nAt some Universities- “punishment” can be somewhat harsh for even minor infractions (late to class, messy room, unkept-improper uniform, failure to “turn-lights out on time,” “drop-penciles on time end of test, etc…)- like walking 100-or more hours of area tours- see image below from web-address- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:West_Point_Cadet_walking_the_Area,_May_98.jpg – “File:West Point Cadet walking the Area, May 98.jpg”- and this is done on weekends-holidays:\n\nHowever at least can “walk” these “tours” listening to music like the rock band “Gun’s & Roses” song “Welcome To The Jungle” see YouTube video link below “Guns N' Roses - Welcome To The Jungle” courtesy YouTube video at web-address: View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1tj2zJ2Wvg\n\nSo, if our nations US “military” “cadettes” must do things like this for simply having a “messy room or uniform, etc…” then why are not our US Postal Workers, etc… held to some “modicum” of the LAW as the US “Congress” has set-mandated…???? Other’s can perhaps answer that????? (Note: US Military Academy Cadet Land is kind of “LA-LA-Land” and not the REAL WORLD where “lines” often get “blurred….” due to many both “external” and “internal” factors and forces- nor is the “HONOR CODE,” utilized and “rigidly enforced” across the “spectral divide” of personal, professional, and public, in “Cadet Land” the same as the Real World!!!!!????)\n\nAnyway, MXRider-ALL- I guess it is all perhaps just “Dr. Seuss” as is read to US veterans’ at Gulf Coast VA/VISn_16 PRRTP as a “special” graduation “presentation” that makes them feel like 3rd-graders…” even if this is perhaps not the “intent” see below web-links:\n\nOh, the Places You'll Go!

Not being an \"attorney\" nor \"expert\" on this matter will simply, hopefully leave this questions t those better suited this \"forum\" to hopefully answer.....??????\n\nIt all in the end goes back to laws, rules, and regulations passsed by the US Congress on behalf of US Veterans...such as found in items like \"Nvlsp Federal Veterans Laws & Regs 2016 Edition\"- Paperback – November 14, 2016 Editorial Staff (Author) at Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/Nvlsp-Federa...22120874/ref=cm_cr_othr_d_product_top?ie=UTF8 that per a \"review\" for example states:\n\n\" Thus “NOT BEING” an “ATTORNEY NOR PARA-LEGAL,” myself, a quick review here on this “Manual” as well as Per Amazon.com “product-description of \"Federal Veterans Laws, Rules and Regulation's\" by the NVLSP,” “This is the 2015 edition of the Veterans Benefit Manual that was first published by the National Veterans Legal Services Program in 1991. It is designed to be a desk reference and issue-oriented guide to the practice for veteran’s law - the law relating to a federal veteran’s benefits. This introductory chapter describes why a comprehensive practice manual for veteran’s advocates is needed” is in fact dead on the mark. Per experience, the US Department of Veteran’s Affairs (US DVA) does not cover, in most US DVA Literature, ALL “BENEFITS” offered to veteran’s, their families, children and/or survivor’s such as “birth-defect’s” in veterans off-spring due to a veteran’s “exposure” to chemical/ environmental contaminant’s- nor does it do so to degree that veterans can in fact “determine” in clear and concise “WRITING” if in fact eligible! Therefore, the need for this manual and or similar “manual’s” is critical for veterans and their survivor’s! With this type of manual, and a little patience, a Veteran or their survivors can “muck” through the “legalize” and “cross-reference” with the “Actual” “Code of Laws of the United States of America” such as in “Nvlsp Federal Veterans Laws & Regs 2016 Edition Paperback – November 14, 2016” by Publisher's Editorial Staff (Author) (At Amazon.com- https://www.amazon.com/Nvlsp-Federal-Veterans-Laws-Regs/dp/1522120874/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1529653061&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=Federal+Veterans+Laws+&+Regs+2015+Edition )\n\nFor example, on page 39 of “Federal Veterans Laws & Regs 2015 Edition Paperback – 2015 Edition” by the NVLSP, 38 USCS At Section 1103 “Special Provisions Relating To Claims Based On Effects of Tobacco Products” it states “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a disability or death shall not be considered to have resulted from personal injury suffered in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service for purposes of this title on the basis that it resulted from injury or disease attributable to the use of tobacco products by the veteran during the veterans service!” Additionally, on page 35, under 38 USCS Section 705 and 707 it discusses the “authorization” of telephones US DVA Employees as well as “benefits’ for US DVA personnel “stationed” overseas in places like the “Republic of The Philippines!” So if the uS DVA can “authorize” telephones then why are not US DVA provider’s available, like civilian doctors’, for “emergency” calls after duty hours???? Furthermore, on pages 36-37, it discusses “Senior Executives: Removal Based On Performance or Misconduct” as well as “Expedited Review By Administrative Judge!” If this is the case then why was a former director “Gulf Coast VA System” removed job for approximately a year or so for “supposed” misconduct, reinstated and then “reassigned” yet again to Houston Texas VA System- per various media sources???? Next, on page 83 under 38USCS Section 1709A “Teleconsultation” the US DVA is mandated to provide “teleconsultation for the provision of remote mental health and traumatic brain injury assessments…!” If this is so why was veteran in “Baldwin County, Alabama,” this writer knows, involuntarily committed because the “kangaroo” court, stated that “tele-health” with the US DVA was in fact not valid! (Oh- by the way the “presiding” Probate Judge had no law degree nor passed the State of Alabama Bar Exam and was supposedly acting because this veteran highly “upset” someone local Homeland Security! Furthermore, this “judge” forbade veteran from being “transferred” to local US DVA facility- which is also supposedly against “Federal” law!) Finally, this manual under “Agent Orange” in the Appendix, as well as other places describes benefit’s due veterans or their “surviving” children with “birth-defect’s,” etc… For example, on page 713, under 38 CFR Section 3.307 (iv) it describes “A veteran, who, during active military, naval, or air service, served between April 1, 1968, and August 31, 1971, in a unit…operated in or near the Korean DMZ in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied during that period, shall be presumed to have been exposed…!”\n\nAs one can see from the above, that “Veterans Benefits Manual 2015 Pck Edition” by Barton F. Stichman (Editor), Ronald B. Abrams (Editor), Meg Bartley (Editor), Louis J. George (Editor), Lexisnexis (Contributor) (At Amazon.com: https://www.amazon.com/Veterans-Ben...atcorr&keywords=2015+veterans+benefits+manual ) can be utilized as very “great” tool to get to the actual “Laws/Rules/Regulations” passed by the US Congress! For example, in “Veterans Benefits Manual 2015 Pck Edition” starting on page 213 under “3.8-Disability Compensation For Diseases Associated With Agent Orange And Other Herbicides,” it goes into the benefit’s available US Veterans of Vietnam and Korea Wars/ Conflicts and those their “survivor’s and/or immediate offspring with disabilities, and what can be used as “evidence” of “service” in those areas. On page 219 (Section: 3.8.1.1.1.1) it clearly states “Because the United States was not officially involved in conflict at that time, the veteran’s duties may have been classified and his presence in Vietnam not noted in his military record. Therefore, if the veteran alleges service in Vietnam during the early period of the conflict…. the VA adjudicator must obtain the veterans entire personnel record. When reviewing that record the adjudicator must pay attention to evidence such as receipt of ASEM, travel or flight orders, statements in performance evaluations related to travel or flights, temporary duty orders, and provide the benefit of the doubt to the veteran.” Furthermore, on page-223, under Section 3.8.1.1.1.2, “Presumptive Exposure Based on Service Along the Korean DMZ,” it states that “the Department of Defense has estimated that over 12,000 American military personnel were exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Korea during the Vietnam era.” It then lists the military units, which a veteran or family member could utilize, along with service records, often on “MICROFICHE” to prove a claim, if so desired! Additionally, on page-229, Section 3.8.1.1.2.2- “Agent Orange Exposure in Other Areas” it lists places and dates, such as “Gulfport, Mississippi from 1968 to 1970,” “Poole’s Island, Aberdeen Proving Ground Maryland in July 1969,” and “Fort Chaffee, Arkansas in May, July, and August 1967,” etc….(Oddly, know of a veteran was Seabee supposedly stationed Gulf Port Mississippi at time 55-gallon barrels stored at his base and himself has “mental” issues and a “disabled” from birth child- that Gulf Coast VA supposedly did nothing this regard for!!!!! If true, very sad state of affairs!!!) Oddly, starting on page 200 of the 2015 Version of this Manual, under Section 3.7.1- “Disability Compensation For Veterans of The Persian Gulf War, Operation Enduring Freedom, And Operation Iraqi Freedom” one cannot find, and could be wrong, a “disability-award” for the off-spring of these veterans due to exposure! This is despite on page-211, Section 3.7.3. “Special Consideration for Operation Enduring Freedom and operation Iraqi Freedom Veterans” it clearly states- “The most widely publicized burn pit was located at Joint Base Balad, which is located approximately 42 miles north of Baghdad, and was shut down sometime around 2009. The VA recognized that the burn pit in Balad released toxic substances that could have been inhaled and/or ingested by troops…etc.…” It further states, “The VA training letter also acknowledged that veterans who served in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Djibouti were exposed to increased levels of particulate matter via dust storms and emissions from local industries. Particulate matter generally passes through the throat and nose and enters the lungs and can affect the heart and lungs and cause serious health effects.” This is odd, as it states, “the Veterans lay statement of burn pit exposure generally will be sufficient to establish the occurrence of such exposure…,” this “reviewer” has in fact “NOT” witnessed this at all in the US DVA System, despite knowing veterans whom “fought” to attend the War Related Illness And Injury Center in Washington DC. The exact opposite occurred- they were tried to be “discredited” at all costs and had to fight back with “independent” lab and test results, as of their attendance in this “PROGROM!” Finally, on page 212, it states that the “largest sulfur mine in the world, the Mishraq State Sulfur Mine, ignited and for…three weeks, releasing roughly 42 million pounds of sulfur dioxide and some amount of hydrogen sulfide.” Accordingly, “service members involved in suppressing the fire experienced irritation, minor burns, and effects such as blood-tinged nasal mucus and some have been found to have long-term respiratory conditions…etc..” Oddly, know veteran, yet again, has “chemical allergies” and has “sulfur” along “massive amounts “chlorine” coming out of one \"faucet\" in their house in......Alabama, to extent cannot utilize the “prescribed” therapeutic equipment that said “faucet” goes to and neither the City, County, State of Alabama nor US EPA will do anything!\"\n\nAnyway, it all simply goes back to the rules, laws and regulations of the United States as passed by Congress, which begin with the US Constitution and uS History- like that of Vietnam War, etc...- for those interested recommend the following-perhaps:\n\n-\"U.S. Constitution (Quickstudy: Academic)\" Pamphlet – December 31, 201 BarCharts (Author) at Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/U-S-Constitution-Quickstudy-Inc-BarCharts/dp/1423215656\n\n-https://pdf-download-free-books.firebaseapp.com/Dj5GZPk/U%20S%20Constitution%20Quickstudy%20Academic%20PDF.pdf\n\n- \"Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788\" by Pauline Maier at Barnes and Nobles web address: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/ratification-pauline-maier/1102002804#/\n\n-\"The Federalist Papers (Dover Thrift Editions)\" Paperback – July 23, 2014 by Alexander Hamilton (Author), James Madison (Author), John Jay (Author) at Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/Federalist-P...=1529750088&sr=8-3&keywords=federalist+papers\n\nFor Vietnam War History would recommend the following that inconjuction with US Military personnel records, travel order's/reciepts per above \"review\" could be utilized in claims with the US DVA Benefits Department....:\n\n-\"Historical Atlas of the Vietnam War\" -Hardcover – November 2, 1995 by Harry G.

Thread- MXRider-ALL- I have in fact “canceled” all my mail-order TriCare Express Scripts “mail-order” medications and will, as advised simply pay “co-pay” at local pharmacies for both “safety” and “peace-of-mind” as TriCare Express Scripts simply cannot seem to ship by the USPS nor any other method their by and large “repackaged” medications “untampered” and messed up by humidity-moisture etc… and simply not apparently willing to change despite my having probably flushed – destroyed close to 2-thousand US Taxpayer dollars in medications do not want take but must do my service in Iraq….\"\n\nFurthermore, the more I deal with Express Scripts the more I am appalled at this system:\n\nHave spoken to Express Scripts Supervisors whom are working from home- humph no “security” issues there I guess, etc….?????\n\nIt takes roughly on average 3-3.5 minutes to get through phone cue just to do “business” which sadly a lot of veterans and retires cannot afford on their limited calling plans; this is not counting time “discussing” business and or talking or waiting on a “Supervisor” and or “pharmacist” … so in total can waste up to 10-minutes and more trying to accomplish something on one’s cell phone… guess this is acceptable, as perhaps it makes “tele-coms” money as well????\n\nPharmacist’s never gotten back on issues of “component’s” of medications and used during “manufacturing-process” that veteran’s may be highly allergic to- guess that acceptable as well??? (Oddly, have spoken “athletes” whom know that it is really not advised to take certain “supplements” as they are “cooked” sometimes with machines utilized to manufacture other things that will “test” positive on a drug screen and disqualify them…also other “pharmacists” have verified this!)\n\nNever able to speak to anyone really in Express Scripts Senior Management directly, or if so know in fact they are, as Express Scripts is a “Holding Company” …..\n\nAnyway, MXRider-ALL- I could go on, but will demure, and simply leave folks with the following thought:\n\nThe US DVA is second largest Federal Government Agency behind DOD! Furthermore, the US DVA is the “repository” of not only US Service member medical records, but the US Merchant Marine, and US Department of State and who knows possibly what other government “entities”??? The US DVA can also access, other data-bases such as TriCare, etc…Thus, from a “security” and “intelligence” perspective, as have told my US DVA providers, the US DVA might in fact a “prime- target” for whole host of things relating to US National “security” and “intelligence” and when hacked, as has been, or countless records lost- what in fact are the “consequences” for the safety and security of perhaps US Personnel whom worked “highly” sensitive areas????? Guess the same could apply, perhaps-maybe, to TriCare/ Express Scripts as well whole host other US Government Contracted entities….???? Oh well simply for others to ponder- perhaps?????\n\nMXRider-ALL- thanks for advice, and hope this perhaps someone out there……..????\n\nPS: See below if interested(?)-\n\n“The Art of War (Coterie Classics)” Kindle Edition by Sun Tzu (Author), Coterie Classics (Editor), Lionel Giles (Translator) at Amazon.com: https://www.amazon.com/Art-War-Cote...+Classics)+.+Coterie+Classics.+Kindle+Edition.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBelow quoted from: “Tzu, Sun.

This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, [\"For spies\" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned at this point.] is the height of inhumanity. [Sun Tzu's agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which war always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of the enemy's condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a war may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to employ spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose, when every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum. This grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun Tzu concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime against humanity.]\n\nAbove quoted from: “Tzu, Sun.

[See Forums Transition Forum: Veterans Affairs and SSDI Veterans Affairs, SSDI, and other Benefits VA News Feeds “Secretary Wilkie meets with leaders at Washington DC VA Medical Center” and follow provide link { https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5090 } to US DVA Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs article- “Secretary Wilkie meets with leaders at Washington DC VA Medical Center-Receives update on progress and game plan for facility improvements in Veterans’ care” where the article “states” “Assuring timely access to Veteran appointments, particularly in prosthetics” as one out of 6- issue supposedly resolved out of an “overall” 25-issues….???)\n\nThus, let us say two more medications as jus 15.00 an month = 60 USD Dollars on top of all the above which in “medication” cost alone (and not realistic estimates- as if 100%- Disabled more than likely on at least 5-or more- as US DVA Medication Profile “supposedly” utilized in “determining” this) a “veteran” is already out of pocket 60 + 89.80 = $149.80, if all my math is correct, so let call it $150- a month.\n\nThat then leaves “single” veteran 2750 to pay for all the “necessities” of “modern” life!!\n\nWhat if “veteran” is in fact “married” with children and/ or divorced, re-married with new children and “alimony” payments, etc……????????\n\nTherefore, in part, might be useful if “veterans” with these issues need to POST THEIR “GENERIC” MONTHLY EXPENSES vs. US DVA INCOME – SSDI Etc… (I.e. Budget) so hopefully “folks can in fact “see the issues” particularly those “veterans” in the “RED” on their Monthly Personal Budget’s and those “homeless” veterans fortunate enough have access to computer via a “public library” etc…..\n\nSecond Chaplain Charlie- at your provided web-link, I counted “as an estimate” of over 6- Different Commercial Retailer’s that sold Fexofenadine/Alegria, and some “individual” links this web-page claim 10-Retailer’s….. humph…???? So how can TRICARE EXPRESS possibly “ever” be out of stock if ALL Major “Retailers” this web-site in fact have it “in-stocK” on shelves as well as “available” online….????\n\nFurthermore, if “massed” produced in this quantity, as well in “generic” Form which has something to do with “patent law” why on earth does it cost so much…. As per law of “supply v. demand” economics it simply should not….. perhaps based on this simple and “single” web-page analysis for other’s to decide….. or “others” out there can perhaps do the SAME ANALYSIS other web-pages for this product????????

Such as “losing” their “inheritance” rights and basic “decision” making abilities reading their finances, which in fact can mean their “freedom” in total, without being “incarcerated/ civilly committed” behind bars……\n\nLocal Veteran I know, whom was in an FMC in MN, saw several “warehoused” MH inmates, many veterans amongst them, lose all of their property- home, businesses, cars, and/or all “worldly” possessions- prior to release by simply having a “court” ordered “Fiduciary” assignment…. thus when “released” simply further “bound” by others controlling “virtually” every aspect of their lives and being “totally” further disgraced- which they did not further need (like rubbing “acid in an already festering wound”…..\n\nErgo, I would highly recommend- perhaps, those “veterans” reading this, if interested, in this “trap-pitfall” see some of the below:\n\n“The Spirit of Laws (Great Books in Philosophy) Revised Edition” by Baron Charles De Secondat Montesquieu (Author) at for example only Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/Spirit-Laws-...1533973797&sr=8-1&keywords=spirit+of+the+laws in particular “Book XXVII- I.- Of the Origin and Revolutions of the Roman Laws on Successions” as it clearly demonstrates that even “thousands of years ago” the “animosity” and “conflict” over the passing along of a “deceased” person property In Particular the “very wealthy!”\n\nMight also want to see perhaps- for example only- at Amazon.com “search words ” Books : \"inheritance law\" at Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/inheritance-law-Books/s?page=1&rh=n:283155,k:inheritance law as well as Barnes & Nobles “search words \"inheritance laws” under books at web-address: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/inheritance+law/_/N-8q8?_requestid=3005866\n\n[Might also want to see “Elder Law” at Barnes & Nobles.com under “search words “elder law” in books, for example only at web-address: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/elder+law/_/N-8q8?_requestid=3007110 as well as “Elder law (United States)” From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia – for example only at web-address: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_law_(United_States) accessed at 0410 AM EDT 11 AUG 2018; Same veteran has “BELIEVE IT OR NOT” numerous “elderly” folks in Baldwin County AL, simply try to start either a Physical altercation with them an/or “physical” one, in which they had to walk away, in order perhaps to get them in some sort of trouble in this manner as always claim “Elder Abuse” simply another trap “vets’” out there should be made more than aware of….

Meadows (Author), Diana Wright (Editor) [At Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Sys...ing+in+systems+a+primer+by+donella+h.+meadows ] is very well done and a good “complement” or next step-up from , “The Art Of Thinking In Systems: Improve Your Logic, Think More Critically, And Use Proven Systems To Solve Your Problems - Strategic Planning For Everyday Life”- Paperback” – January 14, 2018 by Steven Schuster (Author) { At Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/Art-Thinking..._rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=8ZBB79NREB942F9BK2VJ }!\n\nUnlike, Mr. Schuster’s work, this book contains many “illustrations” of “systems” or network from the basic’s, such as a home bath-tub / plumbing, to much more complex “statistical” analysis… Furthermore the author on pages 1-2 Kindle Edition (see citation blow []) state, when talking about a simple “slinky toy”: “Once we see the relationship between structure and behavior, we can begin to understand how systems work, what makes them produce poor results, and how to shift them into better behavior patterns. As our world continues to change rapidly and become more complex, systems thinking will help us manage, adapt, and see the wide range of choices we have before us.\n\nIt is a way of thinking that gives us the freedom to identify root causes of problems and see new opportunities.”\n\n[Meadows, Donella H.. Thinking in Systems: A Primer (pp. 1-2). Chelsea Green Publishing. Kindle Edition.]\n\nFurthermore, the author asserts on page 2, Kindle Edition (see citation below in []}:\n\n“ When it comes to Slinkies, this idea is easy enough to understand. When it comes to individuals, companies, cities, or economies, it can be heretical. The system, to a large extent, causes its own behavior! An outside event may unleash that behavior, but the same outside event applied to a different system is likely to produce a different result. Think for a moment about the implications of that idea:\n\n• Political leaders don’t cause recessions or economic booms. Ups and downs are inherent in the structure of the market economy.\n\n• Competitors rarely cause a company to lose market share. They may be there to scoop up the advantage, but the losing company creates its losses at least in part through its own business policies.\n\n• The oil-exporting nations are not solely responsible for oil price rises.”\n\n[Meadows, Donella H.. Thinking in Systems: A Primer (p. 2). Chelsea Green Publishing. Kindle Edition.]\n\nAs one can see from above few “select” quotes from Kindle Edition of the book, the author of this work, more “complements” Mr. Steven Schuster’s work, and really does a nice job of “delving-deeper” into how “systems” can in fact be “exploited” and/or “analyzed… Kind of like some veterans with more than multiple “issues’ with the US Department of Veteran’s Affairs (US DVA) that can be see at PEBForum_co m ! Sadly, some of these issues, in addition to inadequate care, long waits for ratings that or often denied and have to consistently be sent back, is in fact “medication” and issues related. “Thinking In Systems,” would “possibly” be a good way to ID problems “internally,” as author recommends, and perhaps solve whole host of issues from “care” to “personnel” issues…...??????? (See attached Picture)\n\nConclusion: This is a very good book for “more in-depth” systems- analysis, and should be read by everyone, as we all live in the age of “big-data” and mass “surveillance” … whose “captured-data” from cameras, etc… combined with “algorithms” can be “utilized” to analyze US ALL! [Note: Have noticed when attempting quote utilizing Kindle and actual “hard-copy” books that often page numbers differ!]\n\nReview submitted - Thank you!We are currently processing your review and will email you when this is complete.\n\n(See attached Image For Example)\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTitle: ALL IN USA SHOULD READ- LIVE AGE \"BIG_DATA\"-\"MASS-SURVEILLANCE.\" ETC....\n\nThis book, “The Art Of Thinking In Systems: Improve Your Logic, Think More Critically, And Use Proven Systems To Solve Your Problems - Strategic Planning For Everyday Life”- Paperback” – January 14, 2018 by Steven Schuster (Author) { At Amazon.com web-address: https://www.amazon.com/Art-Thinking..._rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=8ZBB79NREB942F9BK2VJ } is a great fast read and “Primer” for anyone not familiar with “Pattern-Network Analysis” which is a method of “analyzing all different types of “systems” from computer networks, corporations, social networks and COIN (Counter-Insurgency) such as in Iraq and Afghanistan….. to Homeland Security….\n\nHowever, it is in fact missing “diagrams” of system’s it describes and how to “analyze” those diagrams, such as PERT Charts. Etc.…. I think the author was in fact somewhat remiss in this, but overall a good work for “basic” understanding.\n\nAs the author states on Kindle Version of Book Page 14 (see citation in []) “Systems thinking is, at its heart, looking at problems in a way we haven’t before. It is a realization that everything is interconnected, and we should look at things as a whole rather than just a group of independent parts.”\n\n[Citation: Schuster, Steven. The Art Of Thinking In Systems: Improve Your Logic, Think More Critically, And Use Proven Systems To Solve Your Problems - Strategic Planning For Everyday Life (p. 14). Kindle Edition.]\n\nFurthermore, the author states on page 22 of Kindle Version of book (see citation in []):\n\n“While that traditional method of analysis may be helpful at times, it can’t help us to solve every problem we face despite all of our best efforts. War, harm caused to our environment, people suffering from drug addiction, people who are unemployed or living in poverty, and many life-threatening diseases are all examples of problems that remain despite years of analysis and technological advances.\n\nThese problems persist because they are systems problems.”\n\n[Schuster, Steven. The Art Of Thinking In Systems: Improve Your Logic, Think More Critically, And Use Proven Systems To Solve Your Problems - Strategic Planning For Everyday Life (p. 22). Kindle Edition.]\n\nAdditionally, on page 30 of Kindle edition of book (see citation [])it is stated that: “ Systems are made up of three parts: elements, interconnections, and a function or a purpose. The word “function” is used when talking about a non-human system, and the word “purpose” is used for human systems.[iv]”\n\n[Schuster, Steven. The Art Of Thinking In Systems: Improve Your Logic, Think More Critically, And Use Proven Systems To Solve Your Problems - Strategic Planning For Everyday Life (p. 30). Kindle Edition.]\n\nFinally, the author asserts on page 31-32 of Kindle Ed. Book 9see citation [] that:\n\n“A school is a system, with the elements represented by teachers, students, principals, custodians, secretaries, bus drivers, cooks, parents, and counselors. The interconnections are the relationships between the elements, the school rules, the schedule, and the communications between all of the people in the school. The purpose of a school is to prepare the students for a successful future and to help them reach their full potential.\n\nSystems are everywhere. Companies, cities, governments, economies, animals, and plants are all examples of systems. It is possible to have multiple smaller systems as a part of a larger system. For example, our body is a system that is made up of many smaller systems like the skeletal, digestive, respiratory, and nervous systems.”\n\n[Schuster, Steven. The Art Of Thinking In Systems: Improve Your Logic, Think More Critically, And Use Proven Systems To Solve Your Problems - Strategic Planning For Everyday Life (pp. 31-32). Kindle Edition.]\n\nAs one can see from above “select” quotes from Kindle Edition of the book, the author really does a nice job of “introducing” how “systems” can in fact be “exploited” and/or “analyzed… Kind of like some veterans with more than multiple “issues’ with the US Department of Veteran’s Affairs (US DVA) that can be see at PEBForum_co m !
