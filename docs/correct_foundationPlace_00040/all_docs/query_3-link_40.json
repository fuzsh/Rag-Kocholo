        "text": "This seems interesting, but I can’t wrap my head around what this is used for. Could you share how this service works for theseuse cases?\n\n1. I get that migrating from a standard pop/imap setup to mxroute should be a cinch. But how about if users are used to gmail and threaded email interfaces? Is it possible to have the same synchronised view of a mailbox on multiple devices (mobile, desktop, browsers)? Ideally, to actually use the gmail/inbox interface?\n\n2. I don’t understand the bit about z-push being for only one account per device. Does this mean that\n\n– I can’t have email push with mxroute and another provider on the same device?\n\n– I can’t have email push with multiple mailboxes (perhaps on different domains) with mxroute on the same device?\n\n3. How do you handle spam and antivirus? In particular, I get tons of spam to my gmail which appear to be from people quoting my email address when they sign up for junk and even legitimate services. So much so that I’ve been looking for a way to do tmda for gmail. Any help here?\n\nMXRoute is a step up from shared hosting. A step up that doesn’t break your wallet. Jarland is a fun guy. I’ve found him to respond extremely quickly to any tickets, nomatter the time of day. He’s clearly got a sense of humour, and gets things resolved quickly. He’s also tacked on new features specifically to meet our needs.\n\nI was recently helping a REIT set up some email service for tenant businesses. When all was said and done, it looked like we’d have need for ~80 or so email accounts. The pricing at most places is pretty terrible. Google Apps works out the cheapest… $4000/yr for 80 addresses. Fastmail was more expensive due to user storage buckets not working out, and Office 365 ended up being significantly more. (More than triple Google Apps…!) Office 365 does have the perk of Dropbox-equivalent service, and Office software both for PCs and smartphones/tablets…. but if things go well and tenants grow, it could go far beyond triple the cost. We lean towards one-time Office software purchases to control expenses.\n\nSomeone before me tried to cheap out and go with GoDaddy web/email hosting, but their attempt (and GoDaddy’s gouging on features) just added up to a bunch of $150+/yr payments for spotty email/web service.\n\nI swooped in to overhaul the web hosting and email. Got websites shoved onto ‘unlimited everything’ DreamHost with automated backups, support people that they can email and call, one low monthly fee. Immediately dropped hosting costs by over $1200/yr. The main problems with DreamHost: TERRIBLE email server names, IMPOSSIBLE to follow setup steps, plus they mess with your email. (Sorting it to keep the mail server “happy.”)\n\nThis isn’t rocket science. When the Pizza place (a tenant) needs to receive orders… they need minimal spam filtering, only aggressive on the latest trends (so that every important message arrives) the ability to tack on features or addresses (without gouging) as requirements or staff shift around, and guaranteed delivery. (I think Jarland added MailChannels to his service specifically because of us. :P We did have some blocked email going to Exchange servers, but he got MailChannels implemented before our official launch date for two businesses, so I’ll give him an A+ there.) Easy setup steps without weird error messages are also important. Users don’t know what to do when they get SSL certificate errors on their phones or computers. Confused users equal more IT costs. Keep it simple and you keep everyone happy.\n\nSSL Certificate errors are surprisingly common. Not so long ago I saw Shaw (one of the big ISPs in Canada, with millions of subscribers) was throwing up Zimbra SSL certificate errors, confusing a lot of customers. I don’t even want to think how much they wracked up in support costs.\n\nAnyway, we discussed our storage requirements with Jarland, and he indicated that he could scale his plans to our needs. We’re already beyond the highest offered plans.\n\nIs it Google Apps? No. But we’re already saving thousands per year, and that’ll only scale further as the address count increases. We did test Google Apps, and although it had no blocked messages, it did suffer from stuck messages as well to a certain domain. It had a major outage (by chance) during our testing period. Their support response times tend to also be longer than Jarland’s, although I suppose that could change if he catches a cold.\n\nThe tipping point ended up being that MXRoute had alert emails for fringe cases like messages stuck in queue, while most shared hosting (Ex: GoDaddy) did not bother to let us know. Gmail also did not let us know. We encountered a glitching out Office365/Exchange server (it always seems to be Office365 or Exchange), and it silently gobbled up critical airline reservation emails/forms from an employee. It gobbled them from 1) MXRoute, 2) DreamHost, 3) Google Apps, 4) Personal employee gmail. 5) Personal employee yahoo. MXRoute’s service was the first to send us back a weird error email, ‘It has been 72 hours and message [SUBJECT] is still stuck in queue.’ (after approximately 24 hours and ~3 minutes, oddly enough.)\n\nSince he’s implemented MailChannels, we’re not expecting to have any more block issues, and hopefully it deals with stuck queue messages as well, the rare time that a receiving server is glitching out. Going with Office 365 hosting would’ve also gotten us around blocked messages (and perhaps the glitching out server), but at extreme cost. (Perhaps as much as $30-40k per year, after some growth/expansion. That really highlights how crazy their price structures are getting.)\n\nOverall, I’m impressed with what he’s building. It’s a good service without any price gouging. These Black Friday deals are pretty sweet! As long as he resists the urge to get overly aggressive with spam filtering, I suspect we’ll be using his service for years to come. I like how communicative he is on twitter, and in tickets. He’s continually adding and announcing new little features. Most aren’t important to us, but every once and a while there’s a big one (Like MailChannels), and he gets it done.\n\nInteraction with him kinda feels like he’s an employee working directly for us. A very cheap and enthusiastic $0.10/hr employee. I’ve found other services to have more condescending support, especially when it’s their own fault. (Such as the Google Apps outage.) It goes without saying that I avoid “happy” mail servers like DreamHost’s, which pull messages out of your inbox and sort them for you.\n\n-Kramy"
