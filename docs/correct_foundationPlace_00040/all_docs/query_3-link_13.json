Seasoned web hosting industry executive and Inc.com 30 Under 30 award recipient Douglas Hanna is now a strategic advisor to the company.\n\n“Although we are a private company, I have always counted on our board of directors and strategic advisors to provide additional oversight on the company’s direction and performance,” said Ken Simpson, CEO and Co-founder. “Our board and advisors bring valuable perspective, insights, and support that help us grow.”\n\nAdvisor Douglas Hanna is the founder and CEO of Help.com, a provider of cloud-based customer service software.

As a member of the Vancouver Board of Trade, Rob is a mentor in the Leaders of Tomorrow program. Rob has BS in economics from McMaster University.\n\nHoward Adam has a background and education in engineering, and a passion for effective and efficient management systems. He has managed large civil engineering projects, a division of a mining equipment company, a joint venture company, and several technology startups.
