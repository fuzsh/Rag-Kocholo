        "text": "@mannen said:\n\nNice to see an alternative, are you hosting your services in EU or CH?\n\nMigadu has actually been around since 2014. We host about ~1mm mailboxes on ~200k domains globally. We don't advertise though, our growth has always been through word-of-mouth. Growing slow comes with many advantages and gave us time to optimize. Aside the (customized) mail stack, we build everything in-house.\n\nWe host in OVH datacenters. Someone is probably going to jump in to say how bad OVH is. Not at all. We've been able to build redundancies easily due to the amount of datacenters and predictable performance. This allows us to avoid any single point of failure in the infrastructure. Since 2017 we've also seen a great increase in OVH stability.\n\nIn the past we've tried also Hetzner, AWS, Vultr, and some Swiss hosting providers, but OVH could not be matched on price, stability and features (e.g. included DDoS protection, BYOIP). Kudos to OVH really (just not for their support tbh). Swiss datacenter/hosting providers mostly think that label [Swiss] is a feature which compensates for the lack of everything else and double price. That's why we stick with OVH.\n\nMigadu is hosted in FR/DE in 5 different datacenters, with relays, replicas and backups split so even if a datacenter happens to burn down (again), we'd be still up and running with a possible short interruption of connections. Since the OVH incident in Strasbourg (we were not impacted), they are now statistically less likely to have a datacenter problem than the rest of datacenter providers. :-]\n\nGmailify.com is hosted in CA and FR split among 6 different datacenters. This one is a rather new service, aimed at using own domain names with Gmail - for those that prefer Gmail.\n\nWhat about outbound delivery? Does email stay within EU/EES or do you use relay services outside, such as Mail.baby/Mailchannels?\n\nIn both services, we maintain and use our own outbound relays, both IPv4 and IPv6 on our own IP ranges - in FR (EU) datacenters, (we are also RIPE NCC LIR). This is so essential, I do not see how it could be outsourced. We do our own spam filtering in-house so no need for outside relays.\n\nThank you @mee2 !\n\nGmail has built-in open support for POP3 fetching. It also has support for IMAP syncing, but only with Microsoft and Yahoo/AOL, a feature they call themselves Gmailify (not registered trademark though . The second, IMAP syncing is useful only if you really use the two accounts in parallel, and you have folders.\n\nOtherwise, both POP fetching and IMAP syncing do the same thing in Gmail. They pull in messages, de-duplicate them, pass them through spam filter and bring them into Gmail. This benefits Gmail as they start filling up storage faster so after 15 GB, paid plan should be purchased. No one really wants to go and clear up 10 year junk from their mailboxes, a fact which Gmail readily uses.\n\nYou can use any POP service with Gmail. The main reason why Gmail made this feature was to avoid being forwarded to (and to migrate existing mailboxes). I am tired of mentioning how forwarding is an email hack and it should not be relied on. Messages will get lost when forwarded, it's a fact that holds as gravity. The spam filters in Gmail are dynamic and will reject some messages for a multitude of reasons. Gmail postmasters know it themselves, but softening filters is not an option, so they made also POP3 fetching.\n\nPOP3 is very simple read-only protocol and it simulates picking up messages from a physical post office, unlike IMAP which was made for R/W accesses of a message storage. Fetching recent messages with POP3 is a very quick op, unless one is migrating a mailbox. Compare that to IMAP, which should sync all folders.\n\n*POP3 fetches are made by Gmail periodically with dynamically adjusted intervals. They seem to fetch more often from mailboxes with more changes, e.g. every 15 mins, while with mailboxes that have less changes, they may reduce fetches to even once in an hour. (I could be wrong here, it may be load-based too.)\n\n*IMAP syncs are more involved and longer running processes. Continuous syncs are out of the question even for Google, which is why I assume they limited their \"Gmailify\" feature to only Microsoft and Yahoo/AOL (Oath). They are most likely relying on a trigger from the remote service which notifies of folder changes and initiates sync. This would explain why this feature is not open to the public, but only select partners. With such triggers, messages appear faster in Gmail than through POP3 fetches.\n\nSide note: Google, Microsoft and Yahoo/Aol, representing more than 75% of global email traffic, are all tightly cooperating in the background significantly to maintain their dominance. Just check the authors of last few standards proposed, e.g. RFC8461. They are intentionally making standards which only them can easily implement, raising the barriers of entry for new providers. (MTA-STS for instance adds no value compared to a more comprehensive DANE)\n\nBack to Gmail, POP protocol has no support for folders, that was an IMAP invention. There is an issue obviously if you have a service which places spam messages into Junk folder. Those messages will not be seen in POP fetches, so one has to be careful with false positives. Best to change spam action to subject rewrite (e.g. add SPAM prefix), something most providers should support.\n\nTo compensate for all of this, Gmailify.com forwards [non spam] messages to Gmail and at the same time serves same messages via POP3 with message expiry of 7 days. Should forwarding for any reason fail or get deferred by Gmail, the POP3 fetches are still there. Gmail stores messages in BigTable, and seems to use the message-id as key. As such same message-Id cannot repeat. For us that means that no duplicates will happen even if we forward and serve via POP3.\n\nAn outgoing SMTP service can be also added to Gmail so it also can send / reply from the same address it is fetching from. There is a hack where their own smtp.gmail.com can be used for outgoing relay, but such messages will ironically land in other Gmail recipients' junk. Among other things, it has no DKIM signature, which is essential for Gmail itself.\n\nGmailify.com provides an own SMTP relay with dedicated ranges which can be accessed only by Gmail. It is inaccessible for standalone email clients; the whole service is built around Gmail.\n\nNaturally, all of this can be done with any email service. Many use Migadu for the same, but we found it wasteful as the heavy lifting really happens in Gmail. That is why we also price it accordingly - $6.99 / year for the whole domain.\n\nProbably more than you wanted to know"
