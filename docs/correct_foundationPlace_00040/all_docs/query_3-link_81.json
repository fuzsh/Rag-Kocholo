        "text": "Dennis Kelly is a seasoned entrepreneur and the CEO of Postalytics, a disruptive platform revolutionizing the direct mail industry. With a background rooted in hard work and a knack for spotting untapped opportunities, Dennis has been working in the tech startup world since the late 80's.\n\nGrowing up on a farm in upstate New York, Dennis learned the value of determination and resourcefulness from an early age. He took on various odd jobs, from mowing lawns to shoveling snow, and even became a broker, selling promotional items for his college football team. This early entrepreneurial bug set the stage for his future endeavors.\n\nAfter working at an insurance company, Dennis felt the need to do something more and joined a computer company started by a friend. This experience ignited his passion for technology and innovation, leading him to his current venture in the direct mail industry.\n\nDennis recognized the immense potential of direct mail as a marketing channel, despite it being largely overlooked in the tech world. With a $40 billion annual spend in the US alone, direct mail presented a unique opportunity to stand out in a crowded marketing landscape. Dennis and his team at Postalytics disrupted the buy-side by offering advanced direct mail marketing services that focused on personalization and integration with digital channels, specifically integrating with Salesforce as a major growth catalyst."
