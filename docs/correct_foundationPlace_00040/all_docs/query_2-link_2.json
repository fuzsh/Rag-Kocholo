Now my hosting provider has their own SPF record also on the domain.. which I left there, knowing that a domain can only have one SPF record..\n\nI contacted my hosting company about it and they said I must only leave their SPF record on the system..\n\nBut instead I have removed my hosting providers SPF record and leave only the SPF record which I found on the knowledge base..\n\nAll seemed well as I asked my customer to inform me if it is not working..\n\nAbout 2 days later all my domains with hosting provider had problems sending emails... so I recon it had to be with this domains SPF records which I changed.. so I changed it back to the original SPF record of the Hosting company which works through mailchannels.com .... That was last week.. .. And I also logged a ticked with my host whom said they have fixed the issue on their side without providing to much details.... but all my customers and domains emails was back to normal..\n\nTo day my customer using SAGE One Accounting called me and they are back to the original problem... no one receiving orders or invoices from SAGE One although it shows it is send..\n\nHow can I resolve this problem ???\n\nPerhaps if I know from which email address SAGE one sends the emails, I could list it with mailchannels.com as a false positive but my customer cant provide me with an email address where they received an email from the SAGE ONE system.. support.mailchannels.com/.../201992034\n\nAny help will be highly appreciated"
