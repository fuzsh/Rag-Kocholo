Donors

Streetohome thanks its donor partners for their support

As a careful steward of donor resources, we annually review key performance indicators on currently funded initiatives to ensure optimal outcomes from limited resources. With a lean staff of three operating out of office space generously provided by Vancouver's Aquilini family, Streetohome keeps its administration minimal and contributes 100% of capital funding to the support service and housing models making a difference. Through the heavy lifting of its volunteer board, committees, and advisory groups, Streetohome expands the scope of what is possible - changing more lives and building better futures.
