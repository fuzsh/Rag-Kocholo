        "text": "Back to top\n\nBurn Ban Information\n\nThe State Fire Marshal provides information for bans on open burning put in place by local Fire Departments and Emergency Management Coordinators working together to prevent fires.\n\nFor specific questions about open burning in your community, please contact your local Fire Department or Emergency Management office.\n\nFor local fire departments and emergency management coordinators: To request we post information regarding a burn ban in your area, please complete the burn ban request form and email it to sfmburnbans@dps.state.ia.us.\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\n\nQ. Can I use a burn pit or burn trash when there is a burn ban in my county?\n\nA. A burn ban does not prohibit the following: supervised, controlled burn for which a permit has been issued by the fire chief of the fire district where the burn will take place, the use of outdoor fireplaces, barbecue grills, properly supervised landfills, or the burning of trash in incinerators or trash burners made of metal, concrete, masonry, or heavy one-inch wire mesh, with no openings greater than one square inch.\n\nQ. Who do I contact with questions about burning in my county if there is a burn ban in place?\n\nA. Please contact the individual on the burn ban request form for further information about a ban in your county.\n\nIowa Code Section 100.40 Marshal may prohibit open burning on request.\n\n1. The state fire marshal, during periods of extremely dry conditions or under other conditions when the state fire marshal finds open burning constitutes a danger to life or property, may prohibit open burning in an area of the state at the request of the chief of a local fire department, a city council or a board of supervisors and when an investigation supports the need for the prohibition. The state fire marshal shall implement the prohibition by issuing a proclamation to persons in the affected area. The chief of a local fire department, the city council or the board of supervisors that requested the prohibition may rescind the proclamation after notifying the state fire marshal of the intent to do so, when the chief, city council or board of supervisors finds that the conditions responsible for the issuance of the proclamation no longer exist.\n\n2. Violation of a prohibition issued under this section is a simple misdemeanor.\n\n3. A proclamation issued by the state fire marshal pursuant to this section shall not prohibit a supervised, controlled burn for which a permit has been issued by the fire chief of the fire district where the burn will take place, the use of outdoor fireplaces, barbecue grills, properly supervised landfills, or the burning of trash in incinerators or trash burners made of metal, concrete, masonry, or heavy one-inch wire mesh, with no openings greater than one square inch.\n\nBack to top\n\nFire Fatalities\n\nEach year, communities across the State of Iowa lose citizens to fires in a multitude of ways, but most fatalities occur in the home. Below is a glimpse at the tragedy that fire related fatalities cause in Iowa. While watching this video featuring State Fire Marshal Dan Wood and reviewing the list of the deceased, please take note that many of the homes did not have properly working smoke detectors.\n\nDropped cigarettes or cigarettes improperly disposed are another top fire hazard in the home. A cigarette can smolder, eventually causing a fire or large amounts of smoke. Smoking is the leading cause of residential fire deaths in the U.S.\n\nState Fire Marshal Wood and his team are partnering with the Smoke Free Homes program to encourage homeowners, renters, and rental property owners/managers to reduce the risk of cigarette-related fires and reduce the risk of increased insurance premiums if a fire were to occur. Smoking can contribute to deteriorating health in children and adults, serious injury, and death.\n\nIowa has more than 1,300 smoke-free properties available and provides a great resource to locate them. Find a smoke-free property in Iowa.\n\nCURRENT FIRE DATA\n\nIn 2022, local fire departments responded to an estimated 1.5 million fires in the U.S.. These fires caused 3,790 civilian fire deaths and 13,250 reported civilian fire injuries. The property damage caused by these fires was estimated at $18 billion.\n\nDespite a drop in the number of fires, the rate of fire-caused fatalities has remained steady, partly due to modern building trends like open spaces, the increased use of synthetic materials and lightweight wood construction, all of which cause fires to spread more quickly.\n\nYou used to have 7 to 8 minutes to leave your home after you heard the smoke alarm. Now, you have 1 or 2 minutes from the time the alarm sounds. You need to be prepared in advance of a fire. Make sure you have properly-maintained and fully-functional smoke detectors and evacuation/escape plans.\n\nFire fatality information listed below includes only completed investigations.\n\nFor information on open/unlisted fatality investigations, please email fminfo@dps.state.ia.us or call 515.725.6150.\n\nBack to top\n\n2024 Total Fire Fatalities: 19\n\nName of DeceasedAgeLocation of FireDate of FireDate of DeathCause of FireCause of DeathOccupancySmoke Detector PresentDennis Felt 80Dallas Center January 1, 2024January 1, 2024UndeterminedInhalation of Products of Combustion Single Family Residence UnknownArlan Egdorf79Orange CityJanuary 19, 2024January 19, 2024Undetermined Smoke Inhalation Single Family ResidenceUndeterminedLinda Egdorf82Orange CityJanuary 19, 2024January 19, 2024UndeterminedSmoke Inhalation Single Family ResidenceUndeterminedEldon Kirkland60OgdenJanuary 21, 2024January 21, 2024UndeterminedSmoke Inhalation and Thermal InjuriesSingle Family ResidenceUndeterminedTony N.

Please submit this form to the local law enforcement agency within whose jurisdiction the burn or burn injury occurred.
