        "text": "Four years later, the library moved to the former C. K. Griggs residence, a two-story brick home located at 210 West University Drive. In 1951, the library moved temporarily to the American Legion Hall while a new library building was constructed at 210 W. University Drive. This building was a gift from Eva Woodward Parker.\n\nThe Rochester Era described Parker as a “lady of rare culture.” Born in Avon Township, Parker was the daughter of Lysander Woodward, one of Rochester’s pioneers and a prominent elected official in Oakland County.\n\nInnovation and community leadership was a common thread in the Woodward family. Eva was 16 years old when her father changed the course of Rochester’s history by bringing the Detroit and Bay City Railway to the community. Around the same time, her older brother, Robert Simpson Woodward, began his successful career in astronomy, geology, geophysics, and astrophysics.\n\nIn 1877, Parker studied literature at the University of Michigan. After graduation, she returned to the Rochester area and taught school. In May 1883, she married Arthur S. Parker, a graduate of the University of Michigan and president of the Detroit Drug Company. Parker’s lasting impact on the community came with her passing in 1933. Aware of the importance of libraries, she donated a large portion of her estate to enhance the Avon Township Free Public Library. The library was renamed the Woodward Memorial Library.\n\nIn 1962, the building was expanded with an endowment from the Grace Currey estate. The final and largest addition in 1976 increased the size of the library to 25,000 square feet. When Avon Township became the City of Rochester Hills in 1984, the Avon Township Public Library changed its name to Rochester Hills Public Library."
