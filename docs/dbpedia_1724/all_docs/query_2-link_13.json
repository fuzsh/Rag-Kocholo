        "text": "Captain Thomas Woodward\n\n(The Regulator)\n\n(1729-1779)\n\nCAPTAIN THOMAS WOODWARD, THE REGULATOR\n\nby\n\nJo Ann Cooper Killeen\n\n20 Apr 2005\n\n1. MY ANCESTOR: THOMAS WOODWARD was born in 1729 in Virginia (VA). He died on 12 May 1779 while fighting the Tories at Little Dutchmans Creek, Fairfield County, South Carolina (SC). The 1729 birth year of THOMAS WOODWARD has been questioned by some researchers who believe he was born prior to 1729. However, on the 1772 SC Muster Roll Call, THOMAS WOODWARD gives his age as 43 years old (b.1729) and his place of birth as VA. 1 & 8\n\nAfter moving to South Carolina in the 1760s, THOMAS WOODWARD later became known as The Regulator and Captain THOMAS WOODWARD. Captain/The Regulator THOMAS WOODWARD, born in Virginia, is not to be confused with Thomas Woodward (son of Abraham Woodward) from Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nÈ\n\n2. PARENTS OF CAPTAIN THOMAS WOODWARD: ________(?) WOODWARD and his wife MARY SIMSON/SIMPSON WOODWARD. 2\n\nFATHER: It is believed by Certified Genealogist Jean Holly Day, researcher Mr. Robert Hill, and this researcher that JOHN WOODWARD, blacksmith, Prince William County, VA, was the husband of MARY SIMSON/SIMPSON and the father of Captain THOMAS WOODWARD (The Regulator) and his sister ANN. JOHN WOODWARD, the blacksmith, is the only adult male WOODWARD we were able to locate in the Prince William/Fairfax County area where the Simson/Simpson family lived (deeds and a bill of sale, below). 3\n\nPrince William County, VA, Deed Book A, 1731-1732 and 1732-1735, Pages 192-197: \"March 13, 1732. Denis McCarty of Parish of Hamilton County of Prince William to John Minor Jr., Gent. of Parish of Washing. County of Westmoreland....for 79 lbs. sterling....522 a. and 26 perches....granted to Denis McCarty by deed dated March 25, 1727....in a line of land given by will to Denis McCarty by his father Daniel McCarty Esq. on north side of road leads from main road down to Owsely's Mill....line of John Hereford.

Denis McCarty Wit: JOHN WOODWARD, John (his mark) Wheeler. At court April 19,1732 this bond from Denis McCarty Gent. to John Minor was proved by oaths of wit.\"\n\nPrince William County, VA, Deed Book B, Page 426, dated 21st October 1732, Bill of Sale by JOHN WOODWARD of Prince William County, VA, to John Mercer of Stafford, VA: KNOW ALL MEN, by these presents, that I JOHN WOODWARD, of the County of Prince William, Smith (Blacksmith) for and in consideration of the sum of six hundred pounds of Tobacco, to me in hand paid by John Mercer of the County of Stafford, Grant (?) the receipt whereof I do hereby acknowledge, have bargained and sold and by these presents, do bargain and sell unto the said John Mercer all and Sundry the Horses, Cattle, Hogs, Tools, Money and Household Goods mentioned and contained in the Schedule hereunto annexed, to have and to hold all and singular the said Horses, Cattle, Hogs, Tools, Money and Household Goods to the said John Mercer and and his heirs and assigns forever to his heirs and their own proper use and behoof.

(Signed) John Crosby (C. C.)\"\n\nIn addition, it is to be noted that Captain THOMAS WOODWARD (The Regulator) and his first wife JEMIMA COLLINS WOODWARD named their first son JOHN. It was a custom at that time to name the first-born son after the paternal grandfather.\n\nSome genealogists believe the JOHN WOODWARD, blacksmith in Prince William County, VA, to be the same JOHN WOODWARD, b. ca.1692, Blisland Parish, New Kent County, VA, son of George Woodward. It has been proved that George Woodward, Wimbleton/Blisland Parish, James City County, VA, had sons Lancelott, John, George, and Samuel. 4\n\nb. MOTHER: MARY SIMSON/SIMPSON WOODWARD, daughter of Thomas Simson/Simpson and his first wife (suspected to be his first cousin Elizabeth Baxter) of the Sandy Run, Aquia and Chopawamsic Creek area of Stafford/Prince William County, VA. 2\n\nThomas Simson/Simpson and his first wife _____(Elizabeth Baxter ???) had five children: Three sons--William Simpson, Baxter Simpson, and Thomas Simpson, Jr.; and two daughters, MARY SIMSON/SIMPSON WOODWARD and Ann Simpson. 2\n\nThomas Simson/Simpsons beloved grandchildren THOMAS WOODWARD and ANN WOODWARD are included in his will, below. 2\n\nPrince William County, Virginia Will Book C, 1734-1744, Page 2, Abstracted and Compiled by John Frederick Dorman, Will of Thomas Simpson dated 13 October 1734: \"Pages 16-17.

REFERENCES AND COMMENTS:\n\n(1) Woodwards Reminiscenses of the Creek, or Muscogee Indians, contained in letters to friends in Georgia and Alabama, Pages 124-127, by John Simpson Woodward (General Woodward): 5\n\n\"...My early ancestors of the name (Woodward) came from England, and settled in Maryland, under George Calverton, Baron of Baltimore. And near Annapolis, my great grandfather, Thomas Woodward, was born, and raised in Maryland. He raised a family of children by a first wife  she died, and he went into Fairfax County, Virginia, and married my great grandmother, Elizabeth Simpson, the descendant of a Scotch family  and Simpson is my middle name. Thomas Woodward and Elizabeth Simpson had one son, and called him Thomas, who was my grandfather....\n\nSince the publication of Reminiscences, family members and other researchers have published articles based on the letters written by Mr. John Simpson Woodward (General Woodward) of Louisiana. General Woodwards letters were written in the late 1850s. In a letter dated 20 December 1858, he wrote I am satisfied that I will be sixty-five years of age on the 22nd February next (b. 1793). General Woodward was not born in South Carolina nor did he live there and in one of his letters he wrote he seldom saw any of his family. Court documents have since proved some of General Woodwards information is not correct, and it is my belief that when he visited his SC family in the later years of his life perhaps his elderly relatives did not provide correct names for a few of the deceased relatives. For example, General Woodward wrote that his great grandfather THOMAS WOODWARD was born and raised in Maryland and married Elizabeth Simpson. It is suspected that the Elizabeth Simpson referred to in General Thomas Simpson Woodward's letter dated 20 December 1858 was Elizabeth Baxter, who is suspected to have married her first cousin Thomas Simson/Simpson (father of MARY SIMSON/SIMPSON WOODWARD). The Baxters removed from Cecil County, Maryland, and settled in Virginia. Elizabeth Baxter is suspected to be the mother of MARY SIMSON/SIMPSON WOODWARD. Thomas Simson/Simpson and his first wife (Elizabeth Baxter ?) named one of their sons Baxter.\n\nAs indicated in paragraphs (2) and (3) below, the Thomas Woodward of Maryland (son of Abraham Woodward) was b. Mar. 10, 1732 and married Margaret (Waters) Ijams on Feb. 21, 1778. Margaret was the widow of Thomas Ijams and the daughter of Mordecai and Rachel Waters.

CAPTAIN THOMAS WOODWARD (THE REGULATOR), THE MAN: 12\n\nIt was said Captain WOODWARD was a large man of commanding presence to whom people turned to in times of stress.\n\nHe served in the French and Indian Wars.\n\nIn the 1760s, he became a leader in the Regulator Movement in the area between the Broad and Catawba Rivers in South Carolina.\n\nHe was a justice of the peace and a leading citizen of Fairfield County, South Carolina. 9\n\nHe was elected to the 1st Provincial Congress of 1775.\n\nOn 17 June 1775, THOMAS WOODWARD became a captain in the Rangers under Colonel Thomson. He and his men took part in the Snow Campaign against the Tories in 1775. He resigned his commission on 30 January 1776 but later that year he led volunteers against Indians and Tories. On 12 May 1779, he was killed by Tories on Little Dutchmans Creek in Fairfield County, SC. 1\n\nThe body of Regulator/Captain THOMAS WOODWARD rests in the Woodward family cemetery, near the Anvil Rock (Rockton) on present day Highway 34 between Ridgeway and Winnsboro, Fairfield County, South Carolina. His obelisk is inscribed, THOMAS WOODWARD, the Regulator, killed by Tories, May 12, 1779. A Fairfield County, South Carolina historical marker detailing Captain WOODWARDs contributions to the State of South Carolina and his Country stands just outside the Woodward family cemetery on Highway 34.\n\nÈ\n\nHighlighted Names are Ancestors\n\nof\n\nJo Ann Cooper Killeen (Mrs. Calhoun John Killeen)\n\n1501 Natalie Joy Lane\n\nMcLean, VA 22101-5635\n\nE-Mail: [email protected]\n\nÈ\n\nSOURCES\n\n1.
