        "text": "Canada's Modern Departmental Store talks to you again through the present Spring issue of the Canadian Shopper's Hand-Book. We are now comfortably located in our beautiful new store, possession of which was taken a few months since. No one can, under all conditions, dispute our supreme position as great Retailers. The familiar corner of Queen and Yonge Streets is beyond question the Leading Retail Headquarters of the Dominion.\n\nSo Robert Simpson engaged his catalogue readers in 1896, months after the opening of his great new store in downtown Toronto. The six-storey, steel-girded structure rose from the ashes of another six-storey building built in 1894 that had been completely destroyed by fire on March 3, 1895.\n\nBy the 1870s, the Industrial Revolution had reached Canada. Families moved from farms to big cities and took factory jobs. Downtown areas grew, and so did the stores in which the workers shopped. Simpson's - and Eaton's - of Toronto were part of this new trend. And, their catalogues helped bring big-city goods to rural and small-town residents.\n\nRobert Simpson, 1872-1897.\n\nRobert Simpson was a Scottish immigrant who set up his first retail venture in Newmarket, Ontario. In 1871, he moved to Toronto and founded Simpson's department store. By 1872, Simpson was hand delivering \"dodgers\" - handbills, or flyers - to houses in the city. Simpson's published its first catalogue in 1893. Its 82 pages were filled with fabrics and notions; women's drawers, hosiery, mantles, and jackets; men's ties and suspenders; valises; and, perfumes and other fancy goods.\n\nSimpson's major competitor was Timothy Eaton. Eaton promised \"goods satisfactory or money refunded.\" Robert Simpson declared that \"You'll enjoy shopping at Simpson's.\" The two retail giants stared down each other across Queen Street at Yonge. Their prices and selection stayed competitive, thanks to employees who criss-crossed the street and pored over the stores' wares.\n\nThe Death of Robert Simpson and the Expansion of His Enterprise\n\nIn 1897, Robert Simpson died and his store was taken over by three investors: H. H. Fudger, J. W. Flavelle, and A. E. Ames. Over the next half-century, they began to expand Simpson's reach. Stores opened in Montreal, Halifax, Regina, and London. The mail-order business moved to an eleven-storey building in Toronto in 1914.\n\nBy the 1930s, the catalogue's printing plant took up an entire floor of the building and soon became one of Canada's largest publishing enterprises. In 1916, an eight-storey mail-order warehouse was built in Regina. A five-storey building opened in Halifax in 1919.\n\nBy 1943, 1000 people worked in the Simpson's mail-order division. The Toronto store employed 5500 workers - undoubtedly one of the city's largest employers. Simpson's now had 149 order offices across the country, 298 delivery trucks, and 66 horses. (During the Second World War, many goods were delivered by horse and carriage because gas and rubber were rationed.) Its switchboard handled two million telephone orders a year, in a nation of 12 million people.\n\nSears, Roebuck, through Simpson's, Enters the Canadian Mail-order Business\n\nMail-order revenues reached $100 million in 1951. The company's success attracted the attention of an American retail giant: Sears, Roebuck. Sears began to open new stores in Canada under the Simpson's-Sears name, and took over the mail-order division. (The five original Simpson's stores were not sold, however. They remained open under the Simpson's name.) Finally, with the backing of Sears, Simpson's could challenge Eaton's retail dominance.\n\nCanadians received the first Simpsons-Sears catalogue in February 1953. The spring-and-summer edition had 556 pages. It featured Allstate car insurance, live baby chicks, saddles, and even radiation detectors (Geiger counters).\n\nBy 1954, nine new Simpson's-Sears store had opened. A large, new catalogue-order centre was built in Burnaby, BC, and the Halifax and Regina catalogue centres were enlarged. In the 1960s, Simpson's-Sears stores moved to suburban malls, following Canadians as they bought homes on the outskirts of cities. The Toronto Yorkdale store opened in 1964, sharing mall space with Eaton's. Montreal's Fairview store opened the next year.\n\nThe 1971 fall-and-winter catalogue was 736 pages long: 50 000 items could be ordered from it, from children's wear to televisions. Two million copies were distributed in French and English. Simpson's-Sears had 41 stores, four catalogue centres, and 553 catalogue-order offices."
