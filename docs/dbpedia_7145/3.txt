Throughout the tournament, a varied programme accompanied the Euro matches, ensuring that there was never a dull moment. The tournament kicked off on 14 June with a live concert by Madsen and a public viewing of the opening match. The event stage and football arena continued to provide a colourful programme on the following match days, with the Disco Boys, Hot Banditoz, Klaus und Klaus, Hansemädchen and DJ Noisetime among the musical acts.

On 22 June, the Sepp Herberger Foundation organised an Inclusion Day under the motto "Football as part of society". Together with Hamburg-based partners such as FC St. Pauli Blindenfußball and HSV-Amputiertenfußball, the diverse world of football for the disabled was presented to a wide audience. Highlights of the day included a course with VR glasses, which made blind football accessible to all, and a performance by the HandsUp sign language choir.

Another highlight took place on 6 July: the Queer Football Action Day at the Fan Zone Hamburg. Organised by Hamburg's queer sports club Startschuss!, the day offered numerous programme items on the topics of diversity, queer and football.

These and many other activities made the Fan Zone Hamburg a lively and inclusive meeting place for all football fans and interested parties during EURO 2024.
