Author Terry Barr found the music of that era confusing, as well. Southern rock competed with Glam and Disco, and for a long-haired guy like Terry, finding his place, his sub-culture, and the accompanying music wasn’t easy.\n\n© 2021 Terry Barr | Recording © 2022 Rivercliff Books & Media.

We were long-haired country boys, or at least long-haired, native-born, suburban Alabama boys. And we loved and defended our rock music. Our white boy’s music.\n\nIn 1979, Birmingham elected its first black mayor, Richard Arrington, Jr. Yet, so many of us were still willingly, blindly, living in a segregated world. To claim otherwise, even then, would be to antagonize those who were still standing their ground for causes lost and irredeemable.\n\nSo yes, the story or myth of the strong white southern man defending his heritage, land, woman, entire family, and his white boy rock and roll is certainly a potent one. It’s simply not the only one.\n\nIn the days before long-haired southern/country boys became cooly ubiquitous, some of us had to duck and cover to save our bodies and soul from friends and classmates who called us “sissy” because of the length of our hair, or because we tried out for the school play instead of the football team.\n\nTerry Barr is the self-proclaimed Poet Laureate of Bessemer, Alabama (okay, his therapist proclaimed that but it fits).

I thought disc jockeys were gods and when I finally met one, he sort of came on to me. I thought a lot about why I couldn’t believe he was gay. I had listened to him for years, and he looked like a long-haired hippie freak. And so did I. So, thinking through this meeting got me to wondering how he managed the southern rock world with that other side of him. A few years later, I ran into him at one of Birmingham’s gay discos. As a guy who loved the Allman’s, Neil Young, The Bee Gees, and Donna Summer, I started trying to reconcile who we were. I wanted to quit apologizing for liking what I liked and for being who I am—just another way Alabama gets inside of you and causes internal identity-strife. Do you really have to pick pop culture and life sides?\n\nWhat was the inspiration for this story?\n\nWatching the Bee Gees documentary on HBO set me to thinking and remembering those days. My memories started unfolding from there.\n\nWhat’s the best thing that’s happened to you in the last few months?\n\nOur older daughter has just had a baby — Pippa Adele! I also decided to retire from teaching — I’ve been a Professor of Literature for almost forty years!\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to, post pandemic?\n\nGoing to live concerts on a more regular basis!\n\nWhat have you recently read that you loved, and why?\n\nDavid Mitchell’s Utopia Avenue and David Hepworth’s A Fabulous Creation: How the LP Saved Our Lives. And Abigail Dean’s Girl A.\n\nCoffee or tea? Whiskey or Wine?\n\nCoffee!!!!!!!!!! A good medium roast. And Bourbon, please (4 Roses Single Barrel).\n\nTomorrow, I absolutely refuse to…\n\nWatch Fox News (but then, that’s every day).\n\nAnything else you’d like to share?\n\nPlease buy a new turntable and listen to vinyl again. You’ll be a happier person.\n\nIf You Enjoyed This Episode…\n\ngive these a listen!\n\nMemoir\n\nMy “Haunted” Lamp: Murder, Mystery, and Remodeling\n\nMEMOIR | ASHLEY MEMORY\n\nA lamp purchased second hand seemed to be the ideal addition to her home until an investigation into the mysterious engraving on its base revealed a macabre history. As she discovered grisly details about the lamp’s previous owner, her home life became agitated, and she wondered… Could the lamp be haunted?\n\nMemoir\n\nLong-Haired Disco Boys\n\nMEMOIR | TERRY BARR\n\nThe 1970s in Birmingham, Alabama, was a time fraught with racial tension and confusing questions of identity. Author Terry Barr found the music of that era confusing, as well. Southern rock competed with Glam and Disco, and for a long-haired guy like Terry, finding his place, his sub-culture, and the accompanying music wasn’t easy.\n\nMemoir\n\nLightning Flowers\n\nMEMOIR | SARAH K. LENZ\n\nAfter Sarah Lenz’s father gives her a creepy antique photograph depicting her three great uncles who were struck and killed by the same bolt of lightning in 1914, she sets out to discover their story and figure out why postmortem photography haunts her. “Lightning Flowers” is a thoughtful and moving meditation on what it means to remember the dead and confront one’s own mortality."
