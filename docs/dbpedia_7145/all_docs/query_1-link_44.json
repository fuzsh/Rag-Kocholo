As hosts, we are particularly proud of this.\n\nSince our founding in 2003 we keep developing ourselves through a lot of passion, creativity and team spirit. Therefore, our Club continues to be at the pulse of time. With a highly motivated team we joyfully anticipate the future and present ourselves with a new name since 2022: KENT Wait to See You!\n\nThese and many more artists have already performed at our club: Adam Green, Adele, And They Know us by the Trail of Dead, Aura Dione, ClockClock, Edo Saiya, Ina MÃ¼ller, Jose James, Kaiser Quartett, Kiefer Sutherland, Lawrence, Mark Forster, Michael Buble, Milow, Mimi Webb, Nathan Evans, Nina Chuba, Roger Cicero, Sarah Connor, Stereolab, Stick To Your Guns, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Suzanne Vega, Teddy Swims, The Disco Boys, Yvonne Catterfeld, Zak Abel and many more."
