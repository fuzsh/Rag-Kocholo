        "text": "Disco Boy\n\nMy first comic novel is about playing music, growing up, finding love, and figuring out what on earth you want to do with your life… uncoincidentally, questions which I was also spending time on back in 2009…\n\nPaul Johnson has devoted the majority of his adult life toavoiding the corporate rat-race.He spends his weekends DJing at 21st birthday parties, and no-one can mix ‘Celebration’ into ‘Come On Eileen’ quite like him.But while he knows how to apply the jumper-leads to even the direst of parties, he can’t quite get his life started. He feels trapped in his job, he lives with his parents, and spends most of his spare time hanging out with corporate lawyers.\n\nWhat Paul wants (what he really, really wants) is to play his own music instead of The Village People’s.But as anyone who’s pushed Pause on their own lives can attest, pressing the Play button again can be very difficult.\n\nIt all begins with an idea. Maybe you want to launch a business. Maybe you want to turn a hobby into something more. Or maybe you have a creative project to share with the world. Whatever it is, the way you tell your story online can make all the difference. Don’t worry about sounding professional. Sound like you. There are over 1.5 billion websites out there, but your story is what’s going to separate this one from the rest. If you read the words back and don’t hear your own voice in your head, that’s a good sign you still have more work to do."
