        "text": "Hi, Angelina. Introduce yourself for our readers\n\nHey everyone, thanks a lot for having me here! My name is Angelina Vehera, and I'm from Ukraine, but I'm living in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\nDoes your city have a good metal scene?\n\nI think The Netherlands has a lot of metalheads, great metal bands, shows, and festivals, but it's not comparable to Germany, for example. Speaking of Ukraine - hell yeah! The wildest metal fans are there, even though I think metal music is less popular. My friends and social circle were always full of musicians, metal fans, and just the craziest people. If you ever visit Ukraine and attend a metal show, you will understand what I mean; it's really wild out there.\n\nFirst metal album - if you can remember?\n\nI can't remember precisely, but probably it was something from Nirvana, Skid Row, and Guns'n'Roses. They were my starting point in international music, along with Tokyo Hotel, lol.\n\nCould you share some of your favourite sub-genres of metal, and why you enjoy them?\n\nOh, as for sub-genres, I listen to a lot of different music. Genres were never the deciding factor for me to like or dislike a band. In music, I want to hear something real, something new that will make me feel something. But yeah, whatever NWOTHM is fucking amazing!!!\n\nWho are your top three favourite metal bands/artists at the moment?\n\nPatrick Walker, Brutus, and Unto Others.\n\nAs a woman in the metal scene, how do you navigate and overcome any challenges or stereotypes you may encounter?\n\nBeing a woman in the metal scene, you might encounter a lot of bullshit. I've seen things happening to other female artists and what people are saying. As an ex-member of an all-female metal band, I heard a lot of shit like \"this band is successful only because they are pretty girls\" or \"for girls, it's easier,\" and of course, the notion that female humans can't actually play guitars.\n\nOnce, when we were backstage and wanted to talk to Artist X, the manager didn't let us because he didn't believe we were a band and said that we were groupies. But let me tell you, to achieve anything, you need to work like hell, regardless of how you look. Girls, you are amazing, and if you are reading this, go your way girl, people who are saying this shit are stupid sexists who knows nothing, GRLPWR!\n\nCan you tell us about a memorable live metal performance you attended and what made it special for you?\n\nThe show in Warsaw, Poland, was really meaningful to me. We played Ukrainian anthems there, and it meant a lot. And of course, my first show in Hamburg was unforgettable. I was so stressed before the show; I couldn't eat for two days due to the stress, but it was a dream come true for me!\n\nAre there any up-and-coming female-fronted metal bands or artists you'd like to highlight and recommend?\n\nYES! My band! It's not announced yet because we are still working on our music. But my band has an amazing powerful female front-woman, and I just can't wait to share with everyone what we are working on. It's going to be really powerful, follow me on my socials to not miss it (instagram @wvehera or Angelina Vehera on facebook) And of course, Doro is the Queen. I love Doro a lot; her tour in Ukraine a long time ago really changed my life!\n\nWhat’s your favourite piece of band merchandise or memorabilia?\n\nI don't have a favorite, but the bands we tour with, fans and friends often give merchandise of their bands as gifts, and I keep them all in a special shell. Always nice, I'm very thankful to everyone!\n\nWho is the best vocalist?\n\nMy singer is the fucking best; I'm her biggest fan from day one. I always say that she is the voice of my heart and soul, and that's true!\n\nHow do you connect with other metalheads and the metal community?\n\nShows, festivals, music, social media, beer backstage, lol.\n\nAre there any local bands that you would recommend for our heathen readers?\n\nI don't actually know metal bands from Amsterdam, but my band is coming to life hopefully this year, we are based in Amsterdam, so stay tuned!\n\nHave you got any tattoos or piercings? Any favourite or cool ones you want to share the meaning of?\n\nI have a lot of tattoos; I'll tell you about one it's really hard to explain what it looks like, but it's reminder me to always choose love and peace and to stay true to who I am, no matter what happens to me. Also a reminder to keep the light bright and an open heart, to keep being a little kid with dreams and not let anyone take it away from me. I also have a Ukrainian symbol on my hand that means Freedom!\n\nWhat’s your favourite band shirt\n\nMy friend Jara gave me Lemmy t-shirt with the text \"49% motherfucker, 51% son of a bitch.\" It's my favorite shirt ever!\n\nWhat is your drink of choice?\n\nBlack coffee for life!\n\nThis or That\n\nSatanism or Paganism\n\nBoth have nothing to do with me.\n\nSlayer or Black Sabbath?\n\n(Illegal question) Black Sabbath!!!\n\nCorpse paint or leather jackets?\n\nLeather jackets (made by Bente Nagtegaal).\n\nBlast beats or guitar solos?\n\nPfff, blast beats sorry guitar player\n\nMetal festival or intimate underground show?\n\nI love both!"
