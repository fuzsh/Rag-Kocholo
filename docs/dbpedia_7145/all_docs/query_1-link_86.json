        "text": "Tell me about where you were born.\n\nI was born in Bonn, the capital. I grew up in Bonn, went to school in Bonn, then went to study in Cologne, which is half an hour train ride.\n\nBonn is kind of boring, isnât it?\n\nYes, itâs just not even in existence. Thatâs why I studied in Cologne. Had a row with my parents, as you do when youâre 15 or 16. Started to work in a little menâs boutique to make some money. There were lots of pimps in there buying silk Versace shirts and one of them had a discotheque and he wanted somebody to DJ on Tuesday nights. So I tried that, and stopped working at the boutique soon after. The club was all of a sudden very hip. It was called Pavone, like Rita Pavone, an Italian singer from the â60s.\n\nWhat year was this?\n\nIt was early â77, â78 weâre talking maybe, early Philly sound. First I just played Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and then I played weekends and it was full of kids all of a sudden. And then some day the owners of the Coconut, an industrial club in Cologne, booked me for their gay Sunday tea dance, an idea they imported from America. They opened from 5 PM onwards and it was so busy. People came from Frankfurt, Belgium, Amsterdam just for these few hours, and this helped me get a name.\n\nWhat records were you playing?\n\nVery early on I was really into Philly and funk and soul. It always had to go from here [motions to heart] to here [motions to groin]. I always hated this sledgehammer method. You know when you have the bar and the DJ booth all in one? So on a bad day you could do the door, bar and the DJing. Really bad, but really okay. I got bored. I had a holiday in Italy and we stopped over in Milan and I went to a club with some friends and the DJ played âSpacerâ by Sheila B. Devotion and mixed it around, and I was freaking. I was hiding behind this column staring, thinking, âOh my God, people can really do this!?â Iâd never heard of mixing, the only thing Iâd heard was a WBLS tape from way back when. So I started a little bit.\n\nDid you have a mixer in the club?\n\nNo. I had a very basic quick in-and-out, and ciao, basta. There wasnât a goal. And if there was a goal it was to get them together as quick as possible. There was no stretches, or double or triples or delays.\n\nWho was the guy you saw in Milan?\n\nI donât know, I have no idea. I wish I knew now! Coconut people got me for the Sunday, and then another club from Frankfurt called No Name wanted me for Thursday and Friday. The No Name owner was the boyfriend of [Rainer Werner] Fassbinder and the club was full of American GIs stationed near Frankfurt. There was a huge American base there and it was full of black gays and lesbians in the army there.\n\nThere were a lot of good black musicians working there in those days werenât there?\n\nYes, there were. It was super cool. The difference in those days was that the Cologne club was a leathery dress code where you had to play Hi-NRG or they wouldnât take their poppers and go for it. This was the end of â70s. Actually, there was another club in Amsterdam, as well. I travelled for two years, all around the end of the â70s, beginning of the â80s.\n\nWhat sort of stuff you would you have been playing?\n\nHazell Dean, Man Parrish. You had a set of six to eight hours, which you didnât even call a set, but some records you thought the people would like. The nice thing between the Coconut, the No Name and the Steps in Amsterdam, they had the leather queens dancing to Hi-NRG, the Gis giving it to âPull Up To The Bumper.â And to turn this around to make the black people jump to the Hi-NRG and the leather queens dancing to Grace Jones.\n\nWas there any interaction between the danceable krautrock stuff and the disco? Did krautrock get played?\n\nThere were big clubs which were strictly one direction, but I was working in small clubs where you could educate the people. Thatâs what satisfied me. It was good to go from Tears for Fears to Hazell Dean. To play this whole thing, to go up, go down, take a break, and start at 98 BPM and go up and people are screaming. That wouldnât happen now.\n\nWere there any other DJs for you to follow or copy?\n\nNo DJs with a name. There were a couple of gay clubs that got me going, but I was never really interested. There was a club in Cologne called the Pimpernel, and the DJ was called Frank. I knew him as a person, but I didnât think he was particularly good or bad because I didnât judge him. You either made people dance or not. The thing that got me off DJing later was the celebrity thing and the labelling. Is it handbag, is it dub, or what? I donât really care! All of a sudden you had 30 charts of different music. To me it was always, âIs it nice? Would I want to dance to it?â\n\nHow did the move to [the Front] happen?\n\nI went to Hamburg and in a bar somebody said, âYou need to go to this club called the Front. It opened three weeks ago and youâre gonna have fun there.â So we went there and when I arrived the owner was on his knees in front of me, but I didnât know who the fuck he was. He was the guy who was buying tapes from me at the Coconut. He was like, âCan you play? Oh, I feel really silly.â Anyway, a week later I did a little test drive and I just loved that club. I loved the crowd. It had a DJ booth that was completely enclosed, nobody knew who was in or if there was anybody in. I loved the anonymity.\n\nI fell out with the owners of the Coconut. Soâ¦off to Hamburg. And the Front turned into one of the most influential house clubs in Germany. Which I didnât realize at the time, by the way, it was just fun. I had a splendid crowd. People came from everywhere.\n\nWhat did it look like?\n\nIt was a basement club, not that big, 500 people max. Very industrial, dancefloor with two stages on the side, very basic. Neon lights on the ceiling. Nothing fancy at all.\n\nYou said the DJ booth was enclosed. Did it have smoked glass or something?\n\nNo, no. It had round portholes that were high up, you could look out but people couldnât look in. It attracted me because I couldnât hear them scream so easily. So they really had to be before I thought, âAh, OK, itâs going off in there!â By then, by the way, I knew about Larry Levan and Tee Scott through their remixes on Prelude and West End.\n\nSo you played a lot of disco?\n\nI was super disco mixed with huge hits; my hits, not chart hits. Culture Club and Human League, which was not played much in Germany apparently. I think it worked. It went from there into house.\n\nDid hip-hop not have much impact in Germany?\n\nNot then, though breakbeats a little bit. Later the hip-house, like Tyree, had lots and lots. Because I played mostly for a gay crowdâ¦ they really take till now to accept it.\n\nWhat about when the first Chicago and Detroit records came?\n\nOh! Hard on! Yeah.\n\nDid you feel this was something different?\n\nYes and no, because I felt it was an extension from what I learned from Kraftwerk, Can, Bauhaus, Patrick Cowley and Motown.\n\nSo there was continuity there?\n\nFor me it was, because I never thought, âOh, this is Chicago house.â Yes, you know, because of the beat you could put it there and there and there, but I really detested the little cupboards that music was placed into. I never ever planned a set. It was what you felt.\n\nBut if you loved the disco and industrial, then Chicago was combining those two elementsâ¦\n\nAbsolutely. So in the end it was like the industrial to start off, going more into the Chicago, and when everybodyâs losing it you can play the stupidest disco. There were also all the Disconet versions, but 80% of the disco records, I played just the dub version by then because it was more into the Chicago-y housey thing.\n\nWhat was the first house record you heard?\n\nIf only I knew. For sure it was in my record store called Tractor. I didnât travel much. I did go to Spain a lot, but that was in the mid-â80s. By the end of â80s in Germany it was already acid house, turning into techno. Acid house I loved, but by the time techno arrived it was not me.\n\nWhat was the reaction of the crowd when you started playing house?\n\nThey reacted to everything at the Front, and I think thatâs what itâs like with a small club and a resident who can educate people. If you really want you can make it. Nowadays, DJs, when they travel, they mostly rely on their 20 best records.\n\nHow mixed was your crowd?\n\nIt was mixed. It became more and more popular so everybody wanted to come. The best days were 70/30 mixed gay/straight crowd on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. Friday was strictly gay. Saturday was purely gay. I always loved the Sunday because you could play stuff you wouldnât necessarily play on the Saturday.\n\nWas there a noticeable time when ecstasy arrived?\n\nYes there was, because everything went on for longer and longerâ¦.\n\nBut there were no great cultural changes like there were [in the UK?]\n\nNo. No, the culture in Germany was too mellow for that on one side, and too speedy on the other.\n\nMy take on it is the big revolution happened when the wall came down and the East Germans flooded in. The techno.\n\nYeah, but for me it was already over. By that time, I was already bored with the system and the DJs becoming celebrities. I already started working for a couple of fashion companies and I wasnât at the Front every week. I had Boris Dlugosch â now he took over from me more and more. He stood in front of me as a 16 year old and said, âCan I watch?â âWill you listen to my tape?â The Front owners and myself could feel this shy guyâs talent and drive.\n\nWhen did you sense this idea of DJs becoming celebrities started arising?\n\nFor me, the transition from acid house into techno. There was too much labelling.\n\nWere there magazines documenting this?\n\nI donât know. If I read magazines it was the Face, Blitz and i-D. I was completely hooked on English DJ and fashion culture. I played a few times at the Daisy Chain in the Fridge in â87, oh my God Buffalo... when Gerlinder was still alive.\n\nReally? I used to go every week.\n\nWeâre on the same vibe.\n\nMarc Bell and Daz Saundâ¦\n\nExactly. It was kind of like the Front. It had these two levels, the Front was more compact. What happened there was you could basically transform into what happened at the Front. Then I sensed I was done, so Boris took over. I started to do a few of these âfly the famous DJ from Hamburg to a little town in South Germanyâ gigs and it was disastrous. I couldnât stand it. It was also the first time that Frankie Knuckles and these DJs were doing German gigs. After hearing them in their residencies in New York, it just didnât cut it for me. Hamburg lost it completely when the Wall came down because itâs just an hour and a half drive to Berlin.\n\nHamburg was always considered a bit of a party town and leftfield place, wasnât it?\n\nYes, the best clubs were always in Hamburg and Frankfurt, a little bit Cologne and Berlin, but more the Studio 54 type things like the Metropole. When the Wall first came down it reminded me a little bit of the first ecstasy period in London when the warehouse parties were happening. But instead of the house, you had the washing machine techno.\n\nDo you think thatâs to do with the lack of black music experience among East Germans?\n\nWell, among Germans full stop, apart from the GIs or English people being stationed there after the war, because they really did help us on lots of levels, including music. By then, though, everybody was into popping 500 Es a night, which hadnât been that common. You took one or two and you were happy for two days.\n\nThe same arguments happened here with commentators arguing that kids had replaced beer drinking with E consumption.\n\nExactly.\n\nBut with the East German experience perhaps it has to do with sensory overload, after all of that grey concrete.\n\nBut that was the whole culture. I took a trip to Berlin on Sunday and I went to the countryside there and itâs a little village and no young people left there, and you have this little house which has not changed for 30 years, but thereâs a satellite dish and Mercedes outside.\n\nWhen the techno explosion happened why was there no one saying, hey, letâs try something a little more mellow?\n\nBecause Berlin didnât stand for mellow. For sure there were one or two clubs but it was Tresor that represented Berlin.\n\nBut usually when you have a scene that big there are usually satellite things happeningâ¦\n\nI donât really know because I didnât go there that much.\n\nThose guys that were influenced by American music like Boris and Mousse T, were they all from the Hamburg area?\n\nYes, they all came to the Front. Kind of. If they were not from the area, they still came to Hamburg.\n\nDid the fact that the music was electronic change what you did with it, because you could manipulate it more easily?\n\nA little bit, but at the end of the day it was about the music rather than mixes. I didnât use lots of stuff, my goal was to make it long and good. But also with discoâ¦ I also used lots of delays, but I was always a technophobe. I would never even change the needles.\n\nWhen house happened were you aware of others DJs playing it? Did it feel like a movement?\n\nI think there was a movement happening. After working the club we always went to this bar, just having a drink. When they started playing house, I knew the movement had taken over.\n\nBut in Germanyâ¦?\n\nAfter the Front [there was] a one-nighter called Opera House in the red light district, a very old theatre, on Thursdays. But that was later; ecstasy, smiley culture.\n\nWas that a direct copy of the UK?\n\nYes. But one month later rather than three years. They were very quick. There were smileys everywhere. Clubs got bigger and bigger. â84, â85, there was awareness of house. By â88, â89, house turned into the acid house thing, and finally became overground, because any wanker with no brain could move to it, whereas before you had to have a little soul to understand it.\n\nThis interview took place in 2005.
