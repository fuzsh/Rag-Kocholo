        "text": "Within the all-consuming maw of our urban landscapes, concrete stretches endlessly, devouring the horizon. The natural world, once a sanctuary of verdant plants and animals, now lies buried beneath layers of oppressive grey. The air reeks of industrial smog, a constant reminder of humanity’s relentless, self-destructive pursuit of progress, distilled into a bitter cocktail of pollution and decay.\n\nAmidst this wreckage, where cops uphold the system, Nazis spread their hateful crap, and corrupt politicians bleed us dry, another DIY punk band takes shape, channeling these harsh realities into their music—Betonwelt.\n\nBetonwelt is the fiery new anarcho-punk/post-punk band hailing from Hamburg, Germany. Formed in January 2023, this international trio—comprising Iggy (vocals, guitar), Phil (vocals, bass), and Sabrina (vocals, drums)—draws inspiration from the dark, furious and articulate political beliefs and aesthetics of ’80s anarcho-punk/post-punk and the ferocity of modern hardcore. Their name, Betonwelt, meaning “concrete world” in German, encapsulates the harsh, depressing realities of our times.\n\nWith lyrics in English, German, and Russian, Betonwelt’s songs as a gut-wrenching manifesto against capitalist exploitation and the pervasive sense of personal isolation. Their self-titled debut album features 13 mid-tempo tracks, each offering a sharp commentary on the world around them. “Nowhere” paints a picture of aimless wandering through rundown streets, while “Burning” captures the desolation of a world on the brink, with “empty oceans” and “empty houses” reflecting poverty, house evictions, and the hopelessness in human hearts. “Plastic Life” rages against the synthetic, disposable nature of modern existence, screaming, “World is full of plastic, world is full of shit.”\n\nSongs like “No Way” and “Sterben” confront authority and oppression with firm determination, and “Machine World” laments the dehumanizing grind of modern labor. The title track, “Betonwelt,” encapsulates the band’s message with stark lyrics about a world where “empty fields, no more trees” is the new reality. The album artwork, by Betonwelt’s own Iggy Punx, features drab depictions of Hamburg’s construction sites and the severed head of Otto von Bismarck’s statue in the notorious St. Pauli district propelled into space, complementing the album’s themes of urban decay, conformity and overarching concrete topographies.\n\nIn short, Betonwelt’s songs are a sharp reminder of the hopelessness around us, but also tap into the beautiful power of punk to challenge the status quo and give voice to the voiceless. Premiering today, the album will be available on vinyl and cassette directly from the band and via Brainwasher Records."
