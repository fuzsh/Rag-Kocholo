        "text": "17 June 2024, by Newsroom editorial office\n\nInformation on university topics, hands-on activities, a flea market, yummy food, cold drinks, and live music: Universität Hamburg and Studierendenwerk Hamburg invite all University students and staff on 26 June 2024 to a campus fest at Von-Melle-Park—we guarantee a good time!\n\nVisitors can look forward to a special day, when the entire University comes together. There will be a rich program of events, with ample opportunity to chat, take part with hands-on activities, and food and music. Children are also welcome!\n\nThe fest begins at 2 pm, with an information mile where visitors can find out about important current University topics directly and personally. Studierendenwerk Hamburg will be offering vegan and vegetarian food throughout the day, and of course, it wouldn’t be a party without cold drinks. Live music and disc jockeys will electrify the campus until late into the evening.\n\nProgram details:\n\n2 to 4 pm: information mile\n\nThere will be a row of stands between the AStA information café and Pantherwiese where University members can find information on current University topics and projects. The participating institutions and project groups look forward to meeting you. Topics include: University of Excellence, new work, twin transformation (sustainability and digitalization), internationalization, and Science City Hamburg-Bahrenfeld.\n\nFrom 4 pm: campus activities\n\nThe fun continues at Von-Melle-Park with, among other things, an AStA flea market, a Unikontor pop-up store, and a colorful activity area that includes making seed-bombs. There is also an extensive children’s program with face-painting, a bouncy castle, and a lot more. The Altona voluntary fire corps will be bringing its fire truck and other University institutions will be there, as well, including the Department of Chemistry with its cocktail machine, the Zentrum Gender & Diversity (ZGD), the Family Office, the WISO Research Lab, the Cluster of Excellence CLICCS, AStA, and University Sports. The BEAT! project will showcase some of its outdoor furniture for the campus and there will also be an alumni stand. Prospective entrepreneurs can seek advice at the Start-Up Café organized by the Knowledge Exchange Agency. If you want to learn about biodiversity or even make a practical contribution to it, you can build your own bird box with some on-site help.\n\nFrom 5:45 pm: music on the Audimax stage"
