        "text": "This is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. Album was originally released in 1974 on PYE records progressive imprint Dawn. Fruup were a 1970 progressive rock band, which originated in Belfast, Northern Ireland, but developed a fan base in Great Britain. They were relatively popular, particularly on the student scene and as a supporting act for such bands as Genesis, King Crimson and Queen. Seven Secrets was their 2nd album and it`s more Genesis-like than their first album Future Legends. It sounds positive, very happy and upbeat, like the folk medieval side of GENESIS with symphonic progressive classic approach and a bit Camel-esque! Album opener Faced With Shekinah is the best track on the album. It's certainly the most symphonic and exciting, with frequently changing time signatures and themes. This is an adrenaline fuelled start to a wonderful album. Second track Wise as Wisdom, another highlight of the album, starts in a very laid-back way. However, this is an ever-evolving song, in the style of Camel ( the guitar solo at 5:11 brings Andy Latimer to mind). White Eyes is yet another solid track. After a 1Â½ minute quiet introduction, there are a couple of verses that are very reminiscent of the classic Pink Floyd singing style. After a few more fantasy-tinged verses the song begins to wind down in a lovely mellow way. The riff heard between 4:34 and 6:06 is simply divine. Side B starts with the over 9 min., Garden Lady, the longest track on the album. A brief lyrical section followed by a mammoth instrumental (here lasting over 6Â½ minutes!) and topped off with another lyrical section mirroring the first.This instrumental includes more Camel-esque guitar work from the incredibly talented Vincent McCusker. Towards the end of the instrumental, the music begins to pick up pace, in order to catch up with the lyrical section, and one can't help but feel that the band's use of dynamics and tempo changes are genius. A truly rewarding song. Three Spires is an acoustic folky affair. This track is relatively light in terms of prog, but full of emotion. The song will be best remembered for the beautiful outro, which lasts nearly half the track's length and consists of the chorus being repeated over and over. Despite the repetition, the beauty carries the listener through right to the end. The band once again show their classical influences on the final proper track, Elizabeth. The classical feel continues throughout the song via the sound of string instruments. This song is certainly symphonic progressive rock! The final track (1:30), titled The Seventh Secret, is nothing more than a poem recited in a peculiar accent over an acoustic guitar. Album comes with 4 sided coversize insert with full bandstory by formerly manager and author Paul Charles, rare photos etcpp. Great stuff. Don`t miss it!\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. Album was originally released in 1971 on Transatlantic Records. Suicide was the band`s second album and is another hard rocking, guitar driven effort with psychedelic influences. âSon Of The Fatherâ (5:46) begins the album as a slow martial lament, with ghostly distant wind of very quiet drum washes and acoustic strumming, before kicking into a jubilant up-tempo fuzz riff verse/chorus part and going through numerous highly charged metal riff changes tempered by pathetic sounding strings on the mellotron. âNatureâs Wayâ (3:28) is a fuzzed heavy riff-rocker more reminiscent of the first Stray album, with balls the size of pumpkins and a complex middle section.âWhere Do Our Children Belongâ (3:37) is one of the soft songs. Itâs all lazily paced acoustic guitar (or perhaps just quiet electric), nice harmonies, and totally appropriate bass and drums, actually a pretty nice track. âJerichoâ (4:53) remedies that, with timely arrival of kinda dramatic, hard charged ever-changing riff sequences with urgent lyrics, sliding beyond belief into a tumbling dervish of chiselling guitar as the walls of Jericho âtumble to the ground!â from the sheer power of loud music. This oneâs a contender for the best song on the album, the other being âSuicideâ (below). It could have been a hit single because itâs damn catchy and brilliantly constructed. âRun Mister Runâ (3:53) rides a hard, funky bass riff and almost southern rock guitar, complete with stomping drums and cowbell. It sounds very much like Mountain meets the James Gang? âDearest Eloiseâ (2:27) is a love song, soft all the way through, with strings and much flowery balladry and muzak all round. Pretty nice.âDo You Miss Meâ (6:26) runs at a jumpy pace, almost with a late 60âs American jazzy psych/pop/soul feel until the song switches into some heavy downer riffing before picking up speed again and galloping into a fast and hard boogie jam. âSuicideâ (7:37) closes the album as its heaviest moment, weighty, (cock)rock-hard demon riffing sounding, a true highlight to finish this terrific album! Album comes with 4-sided album-sized insert, including bandstory, photos, lyrics, remastered brilliant sounding. A must for all psychedelic hard rock aficionados!\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. Album was originally released in 1972 on Transatlantic Records. Saturday Morning Pictures was the band`s third album and is guitar player Del Bromham`s and Steve Gadd`s favorite album to this day. It is a great album with songcraft better than most, and with a more âmaturedâ, embellished and varied style compared with the previous two albums. Stray made greater use of keyboards, including a VCS3 synth, as well as guest musicians on extra percussion and a sparingly-used violinist. Certainly theyâd stepped more in a progressive direction, without discarding hooky, well-crafted songs, but there was less this time around to give full psycho-rock satisfaction. The band`s move toward mellower songs but nevertheless it was still a hard rocking effort with a lot of distorting guitars and psychedelic influences. According to lead guitarists and main composer Del Bronham by the time Stray go to Saturday Morning Pictures they felt they really wanted to experiment with recording techniques and multi instrumentation (this was something Del always admired George Martin and The Beatles for). âSaturday Morning Picturesâ opened up the bands sound, due in part to the maturity of their song writing (check out After the Storm or the instrumental passage in Queen of the Sea) but also due to the production by the legendary Martin Birch, who was moving into production after making his mark engineering for bands like Deep Purple and of course made his mark with Iron Maiden. This was a step up in sound and quality and was due to the bandâs building success. Further highlights are the band compositions Our Song and Mr: Hobo, a country blues lament. It should also be noted that Mike Evan from the Bristol band Stackridge played violin and Andy Bearne contibuted harmonica. Transatlantic hired the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park to promote the album, with Stray performing a Saturday morning matinee gig at the venue. Album comes with 4 sided cover sized insert with bandstory, photos etcpp, remastered and brilliant sounding. For all lovers of melodic, psychedelic hard rock!\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. The album was originally released in 1970 on Transatlantic. Marsupilami is one of those early 70's groups that should've emerged but didn't , like Audience, Gravy Train, Gnidrolog and a few more. This south-west England sextet, built around the Hasson brothers Fred (vocals) and Leary (keyboards) and the latter's girlfriend Jessica Clarke (flute and vocals), released two superb albums that have gone way too long without being noticed. Marsipulami's sombre and slightly spooky flute- laden music, often evoking mythology, certainly was groundbreaking stuff and should've caught many more 'underground public' ears, but the offer was plentiful in those times and the places in the sunshine a bit scarce. The opening Dorian Deep is often sombre and brooding, heavy, organ-driven, with the fuzz guitar and the flute adding more drama, Fouracre's drumming being very strong, this leaves Hicks' bass playing often the anchoring role, but does it brilliantly. Born To Be Free starts off as languid flute-driven piece before suddenly exploding into another frenzied jam, although the Leary Hasson organ solo gives this one a jazz tinge ... that is until the harmonica solo comes in! Finally the flute reclaims the piece and the listener is thrown back to that now seemingly distant mellow beginning. The imagery in And The Eagle Chased The Dove To Its Ruin drips with the rhythmic energy of classic psychedelia and is probably the listenersÂ´ declared favourite track. Side two starts with Ab Intio Ad Finem (The Opera) which runs for nearly 11 minutes. It begins with a musical box kind of sound before a march gradually takes over. Some churchy organ creeps in and after 2 minutes, an excellent organ/tribal drum jam ensues and after a minute or two, some delightful flute chips in. It then becomes a guitar freak out, before flute leads the band back into a pastoral section, before everything takes off again on a wild jazzy jam at around the 7 minute mark, really great prog stuff. Facilis Descencus Averni is a different beast altogether, perhaps even more jarring than the most manic moments of Dorian Deep and a another high-powered jam, with a drastic switch to a meditative flute passage ... before the great vocal part restates itself. There is a vibe that reminds occasionally of Quintessence and at other times of Iron Butterfly, but Marsupilami has more to offer. Earthy, powerful and intriguing, Marsupilami was one of the first true progressive rock bands. This is a must for all lovers of early british prog rock. Album comes with 6-sided cover-sized insert sheet with comprehensive story by singer Fred Hasson and add. Glastonbury story by organ player Leary Hasson, rare and unseen photos and lyrics. Don`t miss it!\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. The album was originally released in 1971 on Transatlantic produced by Peter Bardens (Camel). Marsipulami's sombre and slightly spooky flute- laden music, often evoking mythology, certainly was groundbreaking stuff and should've caught many more \"underground public\" ears. Side one: âPrelude to the Arenaâ starts quite violently with Sabbath style dramatic chords and the theatrical exclamations of vocalist Fred Hasson. This leads to alternating calm and rock sections with organ, guitar, flute. Bass and some furious drumming are pretty stellar throughout the jamming. Quite a nice opener. âPeace of Romeâ starts with a back and forth between vocalizations and flute followed by further lovely flute playing and another fluent rock section with organ. âThe Arenaâ begins with more dramatic narration over Hammond blasts and then some extended organ over subdued drumming, bass, and female background vocals. The flutes come in and the sound is quite eerie and a bit exotic. In the middle there is a great section of piano, flute and whispered female vocal, the calm before the chaos to follow. Starting at 9:20 is a section that sounds quite Camel-ish, one wonders if Bardenâs picked up some subconscious influence here although most of Marsupilami is much more captivating than Camel. The latter half of this song features again some truly fine prog rock moments, great guitar work, mellotron, vocals, and overall memorable textures. Side 2 begins with âTime Shadowsâ, which starts with echoed vocal and organ, then acoustic guitar and flute join and then harmonica and vocal. Soon a brisk bass and jazzy drum beat grabs the weirdness and pulls it along, then some piano joins in. About half way through we get the saxophone and electric guitar trading licks with an urgent flute and rhythm section behind. The last minute gets pretty crazy with the sax and guitar laying down some very heavy rock. âSpringâ is a great closer and another good hippie rock moment. After yet another insanely dramatic beginning the track suddenly jumps into the most delightfully melodic passage of flute, piano, and gentle Camel like rhythm. That stops and we move into a vocal weirdness section with cathartic wailing to edgy strings and keys, then a short e-guitar solo-the lead guitar work is pretty fine. After several minutes it slips back to the Camel-like melody to provide a pleasing and memorable ending. The organ work gives a bit of a early '70s psych feel. Arena is a concept album with songs run in the 7-11minutes range. Earthy, powerful and intriguing, Marsupilami was one of the first true progressive rock bands. This is a must for all lovers of early british prog rock. Album comes with 6-sided cover-sized insert sheet with comprehensive story by singer Fred Hasson and add. Glastonbury story by organ player Leary Hasson, rare and unseen photos and lyrics. Don`t miss it!\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. The album was originally released in 1971 on Bronze.Get A Whiff A This itself was very much the son of its predecessor Lie Back And Enjoy It (Long Hair, LHC 259), but looking out toward more unexpected pastures. The funky 'Big Lil.' and the blistering antiwar anthem 'Midnight Sun' were both strong inclusions, while a take on the Allmans' 'Midnight Rider' remains one of that particular anthem's most dynamic revisions. 'Get a Whiff a This' track listing: (side 1)1.) Mr. Skin Williams' growling voice sounds quite good on the rocking melody. The melody and general vibes are quite similar to the Spirit original. 2.) Midnight Sun âBoogie with an interesting anti-war lyric, some nice Mick Moody acoustic slide guitar and Paul Williams seldom having sounded as authentic. Great. 3.) Midnight Rider âYeah, again a cover, but give them credit for having good taste in their outside material - in this case one of the best Allman Brothers tunes ever written. 4.) Harvest âPaul Williams basically taking his way through the bland swamp-rock flavored tune. At least Mick Moody got a chance to strut his stuff on this one. A highlight. 5.) Mr. A. Jones - âPretty acoustic country-folk number. (side 2) 1.) Sunday Morning âCountry flavored ballad that gave Glenn Ross Campbell another opportunity to shine .2.) Big Lil âOpening up with a funky little Moody riff, followed by some tasty slide guitar, 'Big Lil' was the album's best performance. The song reflected some energy and Williams deserved some kudos for turning in his best Greg Allman impression. Another highlight 3.) Jessica âNo, it wasn't another Allman Brothers cover ... rather 'Jessica' was a country-tinged rocker that showcased Glenn Campbell's slide guitar moves. 4.) Future Days âBlend country-rock. Based on Williams' growling southern twang, you would be hard pressed to identify them as being English. The album is a great piece of funky bluesrock, with a perfect balanced sound - such a deep and clear bass, a lot of great guitar playing by Moody and Campbell and of course the damn cool vocals by great singer Paul Williams. Album was remastered and contains a 4 paged insert with bandstory. Don`t miss this great album.\n\nhis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. Juicy Lucy`s second album Lie Back and Enjoy It was released in 1970 on Vertigo. Although several members of the band had been replaced since the release of their famous first album, it was generally considered to be a respectable follow up to their eponymous debut album of the previous year. The bulk of the songs were written by the band, although the album does feature the addition of Willie Dixon's classic 'Built for Comfort' and a terrific cover of the Frank Zappa song 'Willie the Pimp'. The album peaked at number 53 in the UK Albums Chart in November 1970. If Juicy Lucy's debut album ranks among the most haunted blues-rock albums of the late 1960s, its follow-up illustrates more of the evil electrics and swamp-conscious blues that gave Juicy Lucy its most scintillating shivers. The interplay between Glenn Ross Campbell's steel and Chris Mercer's sax is as chilling as ever and songs like 'Built for Comfort,' 'Thinking of My Life,' and the best ever cover of Frank Zappa's 'Willie the Pimp' are heavily Blues based. But the band also expanded into Hard Rock, Psychedelia and early Prog. Campbell's guitar work is simply stunning and miles above anything done at the time. Williams' throaty vocals are superbly expressive, a powerhouse on his own, and all the other band members play incredibly well, turning this album into a timeless masterpiece. In many respects this album encapsulates everything that was great in music by the end of the 1960s: originality, innovation, guts and talent. Essential music for body and soul! Another critic describes it as a surprisingly excellent 1970 boogie rock album with as-good-as-it-gets sound quality. Mississippi Woman and Whiskey In The Jar are also very hot tracks. Interesting to compare the huge fat British sound here to the trebly weedy sound you get on many US albums around this time. It`s well thought out and explosive/dynamic music. Kinda like Grand Funk Railroad meets Cockers 'Mad dogs' period with a bit of Creedence for those Southern overtones or think of an English incarnation of Leslie West`s Mountain. The album cover is also awesome, folding out to reveal a 6xLP sized cardboard/heavy paper poster. Damned cool! Extra track Thief was the B-side of single Pretty Woman. Reissue comes with an exact reproduction of the original cover and a 4 paged insert with band story and photos. All titles are remastered. Don`t miss this great album.\n\nThis legendary eponymous album, originally released on famous label Brain in 1973, is a fine example for the various styles German rock of the early 70Â´s (Krautrock) represented. On their first album Kollektiv produced an incomparable, unmistakeable sound with echoes of âOrganisation âand earlyâKraftwerkâ. Led by the distorted but always rhythmic or melodic flute and sax playing by Klaus Dapper and the extraordinaire terrific guitar by JÃ¼rgen Havix and consolidated and held together by the tight rhythm duo the Karpenkiel twins Jogi and Waldo on bass and drums. The Kraftwerk/Organisation roots are very evident on the first two (long-)tracks. Rambo Zambo is an entrancing improvisation with psych flutes and steadily rocking drums much like Kraftwerk's Ruckzuck. Also the first half of Baldrian brings back the droning cosmic experimentations of Kraftwerk. The second half of the track takes a more melodic and bluesy direction, reminiscent of Floyd's early soundtrack work. Both tracks are equally outstanding. 'Forsterlied' is a freaky tune with spoken words that are followed each time with an outburst of sound. This happens over and over in this 1:50 track. The majestic 20 minutes Gageg forms the heart of the album. Again early Floyd blues and early Kraftwerk flutes come to mind but the guitar adds a King Crimson touch, almost like Fripp is doing the sustained guitar improvisations here. The excellent distorted saxophone add a more prominent jazzy flavor. Honored with the prize of German Phono Academy in 1973 and also well received by lovers of Krautrock all over the world, this album is a true German rock classic, a synonym for Krautrock. Spacey but melodic, elevated yet rocking. Innovative, progressive in the best sense. Album comes with exact reproduction of original album gimmick cover sleeve, poster, band story and rare photos! A must for all you Krautrock fans out there!\n\nThis legendary eponymous album, originally released on famous label Brain in 1973, is a fine example for the various styles German rock of the early 70Â´s (Krautrock) represented. On their first album Kollektiv produced an incomparable, unmistakeable sound with echoes of âOrganisation âand earlyâKraftwerkâ. Led by the distorted but always rhythmic or melodic flute and sax playing by Klaus Dapper and the extraordinaire terrific guitar by JÃ¼rgen Havix and consolidated and held together by the tight rhythm duo the Karpenkiel twins Jogi and Waldo on bass and drums. The Kraftwerk/Organisation roots are very evident on the first two (long-)tracks. Rambo Zambo is an entrancing improvisation with psych flutes and steadily rocking drums much like Kraftwerk's Ruckzuck. Also the first half of Baldrian brings back the droning cosmic experimentations of Kraftwerk. The second half of the track takes a more melodic and bluesy direction, reminiscent of Floyd's early soundtrack work. Both tracks are equally outstanding. 'Forsterlied' is a freaky tune with spoken words that are followed each time with an outburst of sound. This happens over and over in this 1:50 track. The majestic 20 minutes Gageg forms the heart of the album. Again early Floyd blues and early Kraftwerk flutes come to mind but the guitar adds a King Crimson touch, almost like Fripp is doing the sustained guitar improvisations here. The excellent distorted saxophone add a more prominent jazzy flavor. Honored with the prize of German Phono Academy in 1973 and also well received by lovers of Krautrock all over the world, this album is a true German rock classic, a synonym for Krautrock. Spacey but melodic, elevated yet rocking. Innovative, progressive in the best sense. Album comes with exact reproduction of original album gimmick cover sleeve, poster, band story and rare photos! A must for all you Krautrock fans out there!\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management,UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG, originally released in 1969 on Pye Records. To check out Blonde on Blonde's âContrastsâ album, light a joss stick and prepare to take a psychedelic trip back in time to those incense and peppermint flower-power days of the glorious late 1960's. The album starts with the dramatic introduction Ride With Captain Max that sounds like something that was left out of the sessions of the Rolling Stones âTheir Satanic Majesties Requestâ with a pounding percussion roar, sneering guitars, and a thundering bass line that makes it perfect for a roller-coaster ride before going into a calm folk-like lyrics that is yet a breathtaking experience. This song is a veritable potpourri of acid-drenched guitar leads, gloriously combined with gentle acoustic guitar passages. Next, we have the early beginnings of raga-rock with sitar and flute on the groove with Spinning Wheel. This guitar and sitar song sounds very Indian featuring a simply stunning sitar solo that radiates 1960's flower-power like a bright ray of sunshine. No Sleep Blues is an entertaining interpretation of the Incredible String Band song, full of angelic slide guitar, tempo change, and such a connection with the original spirit of the piece, that if the ICB had ever rocked up, this is probably what they would have sounded like. Goodbye is a bittersweet ballad with a lovely 1960's melody with a baroque pop sound. The garage rocker I Need My Friend has a great pounding piano work, fuzz tone guitar sounds, another wild psychedelic excursion along the hippie trail. The doomimg and explosive Mother Earth is a sophisticated dramatic composition, still in a heavy blues rock vein, but with a more progressive atmosphere. Bonus track Country Life, flipside of the first 7â, a wonderful psych-pop song, closes side one. Side B starts with a very accomplished version of the Beatles' classic Eleanor Rigby, given the Blonde on Blonde jangling guitar treatment with an almost unrecognisable introduction, and replaces the string quartet with an insistent acoustic and gentle percussion - and a trumpet. Conversationally Making the Grade is another rip-roaring sonic boom of keyboard prog with some wild psychedelic guitar riffing thrown in too. This music is a blast! Regency is a short instrumental piece that goes into the classical sound of the 15th century with harpsichord and Spanish guitar fingerpicking techniques before seguing into the Renaissance Folk beauty on Island on an Island, a lovely nautical-sounding Folk song that dances merrily along on a wave of flutes, acoustic guitars and gorgeous multi-part harmonies. There's a beautiful ballad on the way with Don't Be Too Long, which is a complete contrast to the heavier psychedelic numbers on Side One, and it's a welcome diversion too, featuring a vibrant acoustic guitar and with the singer in appealingly fine voice. This is probably one of the best 1960's Pop songs that no one's ever heard of. The original album ended with the beautiful Jeanette Isabella, a gloriously uplifting piece of music, featuring scintillating sitars and acid-soaked electric guitars. On this reissue we have another bonus track with All Day All Night, A-side of 1968 single, heavy in sitar, recalling the Beatles' early use of the instrument, like a hi-energy Within You Without You. This album is an authentic representation of what was being called Progressive Rock in 1969, before the release of King Crimson's debut, although not really what we'd think of as Prog Rock now. The quality lies in how the several genres (folk, blues, psych and rock) are fused together with a fresh energy, that successfully heralds in, and provides a missing link from Psychedelic Rock to Progressive Rock that was about to explode on an unprepared world. This rare album is a must have for anyone who wants to get into the deeper realms of the underground-era. Album comes with exact reproduction of original cover sleeve, add. coversized insert with bandstory and photos. A highlight! Highly recommended!\n\nThis is an official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. The album was originally released in 1971 on B & C records (Germany: Brain records). It`s rated very high by critics on the charts of acid folk albums of all time. Side one starts with 'The Future Won't Be Long' (4:17) the aggressive voice of Martin Cockerham is beautifully counterbalanced by the gorgeous, placating tones of Barbara Gaskin. Drumless, the strums of the acoustic guitar, the violin and bass work all provide the strong rhythmic compass for the singers' message of insistent warning. Julian Cusack's violin is as insistent as the singers. Full of power! 'Island' (3:39): Violin and picked guitar provide the only background support for Martin Cockerham's vocal. It picks up speed as it morphs into a kind of reel between Martin, Julian and a second violin track. This is melancholic. 'Magical Mary' (6:20) races out of the gate with Martin and Barbara doubling up on the delivery of the story. Nice time shifts with the choruses--makes it interesting. Bass, strummed acoustic guitar and frenetic violin play keep it very tight! At the three minute mark the song shifts again, letting Barbara take the vocal lead--in a very seductive way (as contrasted by Martin's abrasive approach). The many shifts and changes over the course of this longer song definitely give it credibility for the prog world sticklers. Amazing instrumental outro. Absolutely great song! 'Captain's Log' soft and pop-folkie more in a 1960s Paul Simon kind of way. A cool, melodic song with all of the synth 'wind & water' effects.'At Home In The World' (3:07) sounds like S & G's 'America'. Piano-based, with background strummed guitar, drums, horns and gorgeous harmony vocals from Barbara during the choruses. 'Cogwheels Crutches And Cyanide' (6:00): Another Dylan-like vocal supported by full band--acoustic guitar, bass, full drum kit drumming, and violin. At 4:00 bare bones acoustic guitar is joined by an eery Peter Gabriel-like theatric voice while piano, organ, drums, bass and Barbara amps it up. The song ends with Martin's bellicose voice over the crescendo of the full band. Side two starts with 'Time Will Tell' (5:32): A keening solo violin opens this song before bass and female vocal enter to help tell the tale. Very proper, almost operatic singing. Bass, second background violin and lead violin speed up for bridge to a new section with acoustic guitar strumming, piano, and bass supporting Barbara's beautiful delivery. A politically ambiguous song telling us that no system will last forever. Cool song! 'We Were A Happy Crew' (5:29): Gentle piano, strings/synths support Barbara's gentle vocal for the opening half minute before full band and Martin's background vocals join in for support. Interesting violin solo at the end of the second minute leads to beautiful old-sounding acoustic guitar play and new vocal section. The instruments get insidiously stronger--building to crescendo before decaying at the end. Another highlight! 'Love Is A Funny Thing' (2:00): Gentle guitar picking supports the diaphanous upper register voice of Barbara Gaskin. Recorders join in with the second verse. Nice! 'The Duke Of Beaufoot' (8:06) ends it dramatically. Violin and bass plays the introduction before male/ female vocals with permanent exiting violin play slices it up. After 4 1/2 minutes a strummed guitar and female vocals take over. Fantastic. Beautyful voice and exciting violin play and great piano by Julian Cusack. A highlight! Martin Cockerham's acoustic guitar is the key element of Spirogyra's sound, it is bright, percussive, and dynamic, all of the elements that a folk guitar should have. Barbara Gaskin and Cockerham are the main singers on the album. Gaskin's gentle, feminine, attractive, angel-like voice puts the listener in heaven. Cockerham's singing is the polar opposite. His voice is wild, throaty, and perfectly suited for English outlaw-folk. The band's violinist, Julian Cusack does fantastic work at enriching plain acoustic passages with his typically English fiddle playing. He also adds interesting keyboards touches on some songs. The electric bass guitar played by Dave Borrill keeps the music lively. St. Radigunds is instantly a lovable album upon first listen and has become an important pillar in the musical world of many aficionados of Psychedelic, Progressive, Acid Folk Rock! This is one NOT to be missed. Album comes with 4-sided cover-sized insert sheet with band story, photos and all lyrics.\n\nThis is an official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. The album was originally released in 1972 on Peg records. Old Boot Wine, Spirogyra`s 2nd album showcased a harder-edged sound than their predominantly acoustic debut. It was adding Mark Francis on guitar and keyboard and having less Julian Cusack hence less violin play. Spirogyra's second effort is incredible! We are given the epitome of the Spirogyra sound, if not the all encompassing opus of all acid or psychedelic prog in general. Side one starts with 'Dangerous Daveâ, which rocks out nicely, with a brief melancholic bit in the middle and back again. 'Van Allen's Beltâ is in a more sombre mood with acoustic guitar and piano. 'Runaway' is the most proggy piece on the album. It features 3 distinctive movements, some organ and lovely piano playing, vocals from Mark Francis and the beautiful Barbara Gaskin. Starting out uptempo, but finishing in a dreamy way with Gaskin's gorgeous voice - a well performed proggy-folk epic in under 5 minutes! 'Grandad' is again a sombre piece of fragile beauty featuring a delicate Cockerham with his acoustic guitar, backed by Cusack's string arrangement. 'Wings of Thunder' is a pleasant rocker. Side two opens up with the only long number, 'World's Eyes', of which the first half of the song recalls a bit of the eccentricities of their debut, 'St. Radigund', containing a brief moment of manic energy, hyperactive bass from Borrill, some semi-tone riffs and strange vocals. 'Don't Let it Get you', is a nice ballad. 'Disraeli's Problem' features more dreamy vocals from Gaskin, with mellow sections to enjoy immensely. Last track, 'A Canterbury Tale', has a sombre first half which is beautiful, finishing with a multi-tracked Gaskin vocal backing with Cockerham singing over the top. An amazing album, as is to be expected from Spirogyra, the masters of the acid folk scene. This is also one NOT to be missed. Album comes with 4-sided cover-sized insert sheet with band story, photos and all lyrics.\n\nThe late sixties witnessed a colourful and lively rock music scene in the Franconian region of Greater Nuremberg/Erlangen. At that time, Steve (Bernd) Leistner was already touring as soloist (vocals/guitar) and lead singer with the Nuremberg band \"Faction\". He had enjoyed his first taste of success in the region, and in 1968 Faction won the \"Nuremberg Beat Band City Championship\". \"Bentox\", among them four original Wind members, had existed since 1964. They passed for Erlangen's best band and were the recognized local heroes. In 1969 they got themselves into a so called East-Asia tour, which turned out to be a six-months troop-entertainment (with two shows daily at the very frontline) in the Vietnam war. In the end they were cheated out of their pay and even had to hawk their instruments and the equipment to pay for the flight back to Germany. This washout made a new start and the future quite difficult financially, and fighting for survival became their daily bread. In spite of the Vietnam fiasco the band didn't give up. They contacted several record companies about a contract. Miller International with their cheap label \"Europa\" snapped at the chance. Under the direction of producer Jochen Petersen, an LP with the anonymous fantasy name CORPORAL GANDER'S FIRE DOG BRIGADE was recorded and sold for a mere 5 DM (approx. 2.50 Euro). The band's pay was a flat fee of 5,000 DM (approx. 2,550 Euro), and no copyrights. They changed their name into \"Chromosom\", and soon after singer Franz Seeberger left the band. In 1970, after a concert with his new band \"Flying Carpet\", they asked Steve Leistner to join them as lead singer and professional musician. Miller International intended to establish a new German rock label +PLUS+, with three groups (TOMORROW'S GIFT and IKARUS from Hamburg, apart from WIND) to begin with. The temptation to make his first own record was too great to resist for a young lad of only 19. He was not only a strong voiced singer and front man, but had a creative mind and contributed considerably to the band's acquiring an independent profile and repertoire in next to no time. After the first rehearsals everybody knew that things were really getting going with this line-up. The chemistry was right and they agreed that they wanted to play own compositions only. On stage they intended to \"roll up their sleeves\" and give everything. \"The band comes first, then nothing for a long time, then you, your wife, mother, dog or whatever\" that was their maxim. In spite of self-made amplifiers and equipment, instruments that were pawned in parts, without an own sound technician (they mixed the sound themselves from on stage), they wanted to \"blow\" away any obstacle that got in the way to their \"international breakthrough\". This marked the birth of the new group and the new name \"WIND\".\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. Album was originally released in 1973 on Transatlantic Records. Mudanzas (Spanish word meaning to change or to move on) was the beginning of a new phase of Stray. It saw a more widescreen approach in term of production, with orchestra and brass on tracks like the driving Come On Over. It certainly smacks of ambition and puts a bit more commercial sheen on the sound. Tracks like the brilliantly bluesy Gambler work well with the brass and the funky bass of Giles, who, along with Coles, is the powerhouse rhythm section that keeps the band motoring along. Pretty Thing, (athmospherique Hammond organ based) Oil Fumes And Sea Air, (The Who-sounding) Alright Ma and Leave It Down To Us are also stand-out tracks. Bromhamâs guitar is fine as ever, the bands melodic hard rock instincts remained intact, and the harmony vocals he now also provided, add so much more to the music. The Mudanzas album was approached with a great sense of excitement and energy. The band felt that after years on the road at last they had the chance to show that Stray was not just another heavy rock band. This was a chance to really expand their music and show what they could do. Mudanzas was on another level to the previous three albums! Mudanzas brought the band their first gold disc and so many years after its release it is considered to be an acknowledged pearl of 1970 rock. Album comes with 4 sided cover sized insert with bandstory, photos etcpp, remastered and brilliant sounding. For all lovers of melodic, psychedelic hard rock!\n\nThis is the first official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management,UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG, originally released in 1972 on Bronze Records. Co-founder of Colosseum in 1968 with Jon Hiseman, he knew from his Jazz Club years as drummer for Georgie Fame, Dick ran through this group`s hectic recording and touring schedule for over 3 years until November 1971, when it disbanded. In his late â30`sâ at that time, on top of his musical shape, he moved on to start recording on his first solo project, with material left over from Colosseum days (written by D. H-S., Clem Clempson and Jon Hisemann) and new material jointly composed with well known lyricist Pete Brown. He recruited the help of Colosseum mates, Hiseman, keyboardist Dave Greenslade and vocalist/bass player Mark Clarke, plus the brilliant ex-Elton John group Caleb Quaye ( Hookfoot) on guitars and Rob Tait (ARC, Battered Ornaments) on drums; old pal G.Bond is featured providing remarkable moog work on âPirateâs Dreamâ, Funky organ on âMoses in the Bullrushoursesâ and sharing piano duties with Gordon Beck (G.B.Trio, Nucleus) on âWhat the Morning Was Afterâ; Paul Williams (Juicy Lucy) gets the lion share of vocal duties, and Chris Farlowe and Chris Spedding (Nucleus, Battered Ornaments) have respectively a sole vocal and a guitar spot on âPirateâs Dreamâ. The album track by track: Side one starts with 'Future Song' the track that really rises above the other tracks here. The guitar, vocals (by Mark Carke) and sax are great on this one. Killer sax 2 minutes during an excellent instrumental interlude. H-S. sounds slightly eastern-influenced on his outstanding sax lines.Such an uplifting track with it`s repetitive riff and hard, driving sound! Next is 'Crabs', starting off in a mellow way with Greenslade`s piano and reserved vocals as the sax joins in followed by guitar and drums as it builds. Irresistable! Great vocals by Paul Williams. One could easily imagine both tracks on a Colosseum album.'Moses In The Bullrushourses' is uptempo, owing just as much to jazz, blues and hard rock. Great groove! Lots of organ here to send shivers down your spine and perfect guitar playing. 'What The Morning Was After' opens with some sax excursions as the drums help out. Acoustic guitar by Quaye and powerful vocals by Paul Williams take over as the piano joins in. Our second favourite tune on here after the opener. A folky song really until it picks up half-way through. Side 2 opens with 11 minutes âPirateâs Dreamâ, with Farlowe on vocals and Spedding`s initial rock blues riff, but soon evolving to a complex multi parted composition in the best spirit of Valentyne Suite, driven by Hiseman multi faceted drumming. D.H-S. twin saxes soar on a calmer mid section with Spedding doubling the licks and the bass grumbling relentlessly behind; it slowly gains speed with moog, sax & vocalizations duelling and answering each others with dazzling, demanding and inspired phrasings on top a thundering rhythm section; after the lyrics resume it evolves into a majestic, grandiose finale. A bluesy clean guitar lick opens âSame old Thingâ, a swinging, calm heavily modulated twisted Blues, with a punchy rhythm section, a soulful Williams on vocal, Quaye delivering an inspired sparkling solo and D.H-S. sensitive fat sax enhanced with some double tracking on the solo part. A great ending to a great album. Album comes with the reproduction of original gatefold cover sleeve, add. coversized insert with bandstory, lyrics and photos. A highlight! Highly recommended!\n\nThis is an official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. Album was originally released in 1973 on PYE records progressive imprint Dawn. Fruup were a 1970 progressive rock band, which originated in Belfast, Northern Ireland, but developed a fan base in Great Britain. They were relatively popular, particularly on the student scene and as a supporting act for such bands as Genesis, King Crimson and Queen. Future Legends was their debut album and is one of those records that any fan of symphonic prog should have!'Future Legends' opens with the title track, a short classical piece of music which acts as a prelude to 'Decision', a lively and rumbunctious number that gallups along nicely with a pounding rhythm and builds up to an impressively rousing finale. An awesome opening to the album. 'As Day Breaks with Dawn' follows next, with a melodic classically-inspired opening, which breaks out into a powerful thrumming Genesis-like number with the singer sounding remarkably like Peter Gabriel. Yes, we're definitely in Genesis territory here, with a somewhat heavier sound, and very good it is too. Track 4 'Graveyard Epistle', a song which begins as a melodic ballad before breaking out into some very proggy, heavy and intense riffing. In true prog fashion, there are constant changes of tempo, staccato breaks and a few key changes thrown in too, to keep the listener entertained and enthralled. Side Two opens with 'Lord of the Incubus'. It's a grand-sounding title and the music is impressively grand too, Again, it sounds like a song Genesis could have recorded in their classic prog years. There's a thumping rhythm section and the guitarist is really in his element here as he demonstrates his virtuosity with some masterly soloing. 'Olde Tyme Future' has a more sedate pace, with some beautifully melodic keyboard motifs. The cryptic lyrics are shrouded in mystery but with music this good, who cares about the lyrics anyway!? 'Song for a Thought'. is a seven and a half minute long magnum opus which opens in fine rollicking style and then transposes into a laid-back mellow and melodic groove in the middle section. before the resounding and reverberant grand finale, which might just blow your socks off. It's melodic, it's dramatic, and it'll leave you feeling euphoric. The final song is a brief and gentle vocal reprise of the classical title track which opened the album. It's a perfect ending to a magical album full of proggy tales of mystery and imagination. Bonustrack On A Clear Day has a sensational rhythmic verse, the song ends with a tribute to Gustav Holst by playing a segment from Jupiter on the guitar. The band would use classical influences regularly in songs to come. This is a very impressive debut album from this Northern Irish band that's likely to appeal to fans of the classic Peter Gabriel years of Genesis. If you love Genesis's Trespass and Nursery Cryme, I think you'll enjoy this one. It's hard to pick out a highlight of the album, because 'Future Legends' is full to the brim with great songs. If you're looking for a band with the musical talent and melodic finesse of Genesis with a somewhat heavier edge, then you'll be in prog heaven with this superb album. This prog masterpiece is such a delight to listen to that you may be inspired to give Fruupp's following three albums a spin too. A must-have album for any discerning collector of classic British prog. Album comes with original artwork and a 4-sided cover - sized insert with bandstory by ex manager Paul Charles. A must have!!\n\nThis is an official re-release on vinyl under licensed courtesy of BMG Rights Management, UK, remastered from an original master copy out of the vaults of BMG. Album was originally released in 1969 on PYE records. Man are a rock band from Wales whose style is a mixture of American West Coast psychedelia, progressive rock, and blues. As most of you know MAN have an enormous back catalogue with a big list of albums that proved that they are one of the greatest bands to emerge from Wales and the UK. Still active today after countless line-up changes they are still part of the psychedelic, progressive jam rock scene. Let`s go back to September 1969 when âTwo Ozs Of Plasticâ¦âwas released on Pye Records (Home of The Kinks). The band`s 2nd album is a vast improvement from their debut album Revelation. Still heavily influenced by their west coast pysch peers, the performances have tightened and great experimental ideas were flowing. The LP starts with the magnificent Prelude/The Storm - which lasts for over 12 minutes. A really unusual piece to kick off an album with, but it works. It`s so full of atmosphere from all musicians. Crashing zymbals, a wall of noise from the Hammond and unusual sounds from DEKE LEONARD on guitar, making convincing seagull noises. The whole track emulates a storm perfectly as the title would suggest. Things continue to build towards a seemingly limitless crescendo before easing off to an altogether more relaxing, almost ambient phase. As we move into 'It is as it must be' (originally to be titled 'Shit on the world' till the record company took fright), we begin to uncover what would become the essence of the band. Here we have a heavy, bluesy guitar driven riff laden number with the first vocals of the album. Apart from that brief vocal excursion, the track is primarily an elongated jam featuring lead guitar and harmonica. Other highlights include Spunk Box (known as Spunk Rock to the band and fans). A killer riff opens the first track on side two followed by some dirty sounding vocals to follow. This has remained in their live set and has been jammed to a jaw dropping length of 30+ minutes! With Man you get a real sense of West Coast US meets Methyr Tydfil (Wales) with an undercurrent of hard rocking trying to break out through the dreamy sounds of the Pacific surf, sort of. Spunk Box is the standout track on this album. It really started to define the MAN sound and still deserves great appreciation as one of their best titles ever. It remains though one of Man's signature numbers. 'My name is Jesus Smith' is the most commercial track on the album, reverting to the Bystanders light psychedelic pop rock style with pleasant harmonies. Midway through, the song bizarrely transforms into a hoe-down style country piece. 'Parchment and candles' was reputedly performed on a harpsichord belonging to producer/song writer Tony Hatch, who took exception to the band using it without his permission. The piece itself is a brief reflective instrumental, quite unlike what we have come to expect from Man. The album closes with 'Brother Arnold's red and white striped tent'. Not a particularly memorable track by any means, but fine all the same. Two Ozs Of Plasticâ¦is the album which sees Man starting to find a clear direction, while still experimenting with a few disparate styles. A high enjoyable trip. Album comes with 4 sided cover-sized insert with different German cover, stories and photos. Don`t miss this classic item!\n\nThis is the first official reissue on vinyl of this extremely rare album, originally released in 1978 on the Brutkasten label. A very varied fusion album IM TAL DER EMMEN blends Embryo and Zappa/Mothers like rock and jazz mixtures, with a rich instrumental palette, full of solos and invention. Mostly it intended to sound like an instrumental Out of Focus (Freeman Brothers in â The Crack in the Cosmic Eggâ) The album has this charming Kraut/Fusion style. The sextett line-up resulted to a very rich sound with technical drumming, smooth instrumental interactions and loose executions on flute, guitars and organ, not to mention the scratching sax soliing of Mandi Riedelbauch (played also on the Marsupilami âArenaâ album, 1971 Long Hair LHC 257). Moreover there are slight psychedelic underlines over an jazzy attitude, typical of the Kraut Rock stylings, featuring steady but frenetic rhythmic parts over extended instrumental solos.The band had however a good sense of melody to support their jazzy style with melodic trombones and some delicate flute lines in the more mellow segments.Every track in here seems to have its own hero, no matter if this the keyboardist, the flutist or the sax player.They do remind of classic acts such as KRAAN and EMBRYO pretty often with a touch of SUPERSISTER in the furious interplays. Interesting and at moments fascinating Kraut Fusion with decent interplays and plenty of well-performed solos.Recommended both to Kraut Rock and Jazz/Fusion fans (apps79, progarchive reviewer). LP comes with 6 sided cover sized insert sheet with bandstory, many photos and other memorabilias.\n\nThis is the first official reissue on vinyl of this extremely rare album, originally released in 1978 on the Brutkasten label.

The two live bonus tracks on the CD released by the band, total over 25 minutes, and are very similar to the album itself, these tracks are stretched out with more room given for solo improvisation. But the melodic core of the song is never lost. LP comes with 6 sided cover sized insert sheet with bandstory, many photos and other memorabilias. CD contains a 24 sided booklet! The music was newly remastered! DonÂ´t miss this highly sought after but extremely rare album, itÂ´s a Krautrock/Jazzrock highlight.\n\nTThis is a real sensation! EulenspygelÂ´s English version of 'Ausschuss' was intended for release by Intercord in 1972, but never went beyond the status of an 8-track that had been produced for the American market. 'Trash', the title of the English version of 'Ausschuss', contains partly different mixes, consequently English vocals and was partly recorded with the help of English musicians. The recordings took place from 4.4.-8.4.1972 at the famous Apple Studios in London. The band enlisted the help of a bass player who had just worked in the studio for Ringo Star or Rod Argent, and whose professionalism saved further takes during the recording. 'Trash' is the side long suite which is really a Rock Opera of sorts about orphans. It starts with a haunting intro with mellotron as spoken words join in.The music kicks in around 2 minutes followed by emotional and powerful vocals and flute. The atmosphere stops before 9 minutes as strummed guitar takes over followed again by flute and some heavy organ before 12 1/2 minutes with electric guitar, drums and a full sound. It then picks up with vocals including some chunky bass. It settles back 16 1/2 minutes in with floating organ and almost spoken vocals. Very powerful and opera-like. It settles again after 19 minutes with organ and a beat as the mellotron joins in. Incredible track ! 'Mindscraper' is pretty straighforward.Vocals are the focus as the organ, drums and guitar help out. Great organ solo followed by the guitar solo later on. 'Vicious Circle' is a cool sounding tune with the vocals sounding more laid back as the drums and acoustic guitar offer up some energy. Sitar before 6 1/2 minutes to the end. 'Annoying' has a beat as reserved vocals join in. Very emotionally ! The organ replaces the vocals but they switch back again after 2 minutes. 'Stranger' opens with organ as the guitar joins in. It kicks in hard around a minute then settles back with vocals. Excellent. Spoken words after 4 minutes then it all picks up again. 'Battery Farm' has a good heavy intro. Mellotron before 2 minutes as we get this haunting mood taking over. Guitar before 3 minutes then organ. Vocals are back late. The instrumentation on this album is as vast as well with some sitar, lots of mellotron, violin, flute and hand percussison.
