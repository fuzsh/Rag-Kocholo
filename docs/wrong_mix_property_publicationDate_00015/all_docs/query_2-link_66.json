        "text": "Sad news, this morning, about the death of Anne McCaffrey. I haven't read her for years, but I think I must have spent almost an entire summer holiday, in my teens, allowing nothing but McCaffrey books to cross my palms. I mined our library's selection, I shelled out in the bookshop for what I couldn't borrow; I buried myself in the world of Pern, dragons, and abundant apostrophes. It was one of my first cases of serious author addiction, which has, in later years, led to me buying a second copy of Stephen King's Song of Susannah from Borders because my Amazon edition was too slow to arrive, and to George RR Martin's interference with my university education.\n\nLooking at McCaffrey's extensive bibliography, I think I've read nearly everything up to The Masterharper of Pern, although it was a long time ago so I'm a little hazy. About a planet where certain humans are able to \"impress\" a dragon hatchling, with the pairs going on together to fight the deadly \"thread\" which falls from the skies, I loved them partly because I was desperate for a dragon of my own. As the author herself has said, it'd be \"rather wonderful to have an intelligent partner that loves you unconditionally. Who wouldn't like a 40ft telepathic dragon as their best friend?\"\n\nBut the Pern books were also my first introduction to a science fiction trope which I still adore: that of the far-flung Earth colony. Pern appears to be the classic medieval fantasy world, complete with lords, fire-breathing dragons, harpers, et cetera. But as McCaffrey states on her website, \"I write science-fiction, (s-f for short). Fantasy usually contains some form of magic. I stick to Newtonian logic.\" As the series progresses, more is revealed about the scientific rationale behind the dragons and how they were bred; behind thread; behind how the planet's inhabitants initially arrived on Pern."
