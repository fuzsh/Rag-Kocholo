        "text": "Author Anne McCaffrey, who penned the Dragonriders of Pern series of fantasy novels, has died at her home in Ireland at the age of 85.\n\nThe US-born writer became one of the first women to break into the male-dominated world of science fiction, winning two major prizes in the 1960s.\n\nMuch of her work was set on the planet of Pern, where humans and dragons are united against a common threat.\n\nIn later years, McCaffrey's books were co-written with son Todd.\n\nThe most recent instalment came out in June, with a further joint novel, Sky Dragons, due for publication next year.\n\nHer son also wrote three of the series in his own right.\n\nThe opening two books in the Pern series were published in the late 1960s, winning McCaffrey the Hugo and Nebula literary prizes for science fiction.\n\nShe was the first woman to collect each of those honours.\n\nThe third book in the original trilogy, The White Dragon, was published in 1978 and made the New York Times bestseller list.\n\nIn 2005, she was named a Grand Master of science fiction.\n\nMcCaffrey emigrated to Ireland in 1970, building a home in County Wicklow which she named Dragonhold."
