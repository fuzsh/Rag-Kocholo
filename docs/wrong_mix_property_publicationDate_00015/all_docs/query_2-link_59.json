        "text": "First edition of The People of Pern by Ann McCaffrey and Robin Wood brings to life the characters that have inhabited Pern since colonization.\n\nText and introduction by Ann McCaffrey. Illustrated by Robin Wood. First edition, 1988. The Donning Company, publishers.\n\n\"Pern, the third world of a golden, G-type star, was initially colonized from earth and is a place of Dragon Weyrs, Holds, and Crafthalls. It is a colorful blend of Middle Ages, modernity and magic.\"\n\nAnne McCaffrey (1926 - 2011) is legend; first woman to receive the Hugo and Nebula Awards for science fiction, first woman science fiction writer to make the New York Times Best Seller list, and a member of the Science Fiction Hall of Fame.\n\nThe earliest Pern story was Weyr Search, a novella published in 1967 and winner of the Hugo Award. People of Pern serves as a companion to the 23-volume Pern series, which began with Dragonflight, published in 1968.\n\n\"Begin a dragon rider required special talents in humans and complete dedication. Thus the dragonriders became a group - apart from those who held the land against the depredations of Thread or those whose craft skills produced other necessities of life in their crafhalls. Over the centuries, the settlers forgot their origins in their struggle to survive against Thread which fell across the land whenever the Red Star's eccentric orbit coincided with Pern's.\"\n\nArtist Robin Wood caught McCaffrey's attention in the 1980's at Pern conventions and they collaborated on the People of Pern over an \"unconscionably\" long period of time. It was well worth the time and effort. Wood's stunning portraits bring the people of Pern to life.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction\n\nHolds of Pern\n\nCrafhalls\n\nWeyrfolk\n\nMoretz\n\nA Guide to Pern\n\nEtsy.com/shop/TheCharmedBookshop\n\nVisit TheCharmedBookshop.com for more first edition children's books.\n\nCondition*: Very Good/Very Good.
