It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It is the 20th movie in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The movie is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe. It is about a family of cats who are kidnapped by their owner's butler. It was originally released to theaters by Buena Vista Distribution on December 11, 1970, with a regular release on December 24, 1970. The title is a pun on the word aristocrats.\n\nThe movie's basic idea is an animated romantic musical comedy about talking cats in France. This idea had previously been used in the UPA animated feature Gay Purr-ee.\n\nDisney planned to release a sequel, The Aristocats II in 2007. Production on that was canceled in early 2006.\n\nThe was the last movie to be approved by Walt Disney himself. Disney died before the movie was released.\n\nThe story\n\nThe movie takes place in Paris in 1910. A mother cat named Duchess and her three kittens, Marie, Berlioz, and Toulouse, are going to receive a fortune when their owner dies. But Edgar, their butler, does not like this and plans to send the cats away.\n\nHe places sleeping tablets in their dinner. At night, he plans on dropping them off in the countryside. Two hound dogs, Napoleon and Lafayette, attack him, and the cats are now stranded.\n\nIn the morning, they meet an alley cat named Abraham de Lacy Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley (called just Thomas O'Malley). He helps them on their way back home. He even lets them stay at his \"pad\" (the place where he and his \"gang\", or friends, stay).\n\nThey finally get back home, but Edgar recatches them in a sack and plans to send them to Timbuktu, Africa. O'Malley, Scat Cat and his gang, Roquefort and Frou-Frou all fight Edgar, while Roquefort rescues Duchess and kittens. In the end, Edgar is kicked into the trunk, locked inside, and sent to Timbuktu himself. Madame Adelaide's will is rewritten to not include Edgar and include O'Malley, and she starts a charity foundation which gives a home to all the cats in Paris.\n\nProduction\n\nThis movie was the last one to be approved by Walt himself. It was the first one produced after his death. The movie took four years to produce. Its budget was 4,000,000. Five of Disney's legendary \"Nine Old Men\" worked on it, including the Disney crew that had been working 25 years on average.\n\nCast\n\nEva Gabor as Duchess\n\nPhil Harris as Thomas O'Malley\n\nGary Dubin as Toulouse\n\nLiz English as Marie\n\nDean Clark as Berlioz\n\nRoddy Maude-Roxby as Edgar Balthazar\n\nScatman Crothers as Scat Cat\n\nSterling Holloway as Roquefort\n\nPaul Winchell as Shun Gon\n\nLord Tim Hudson as Hit Cat\n\nVito Scotti as Peppo\n\nThurl Ravenscroft as Billy Boss\n\nPat Buttram as Napoleon\n\nGeorge Lindsey as Lafayette\n\nHermione Baddeley as Madame Adelaide Bonfamille\n\nCharles Lane as Georges Hautecourt\n\nNancy Kulp as Frou-Frou\n\nMonica Evans as Abigail Gabble\n\nCarole Shelley as Amelia Gabble\n\nBill Thompson as Uncle Waldo\n\nPeter Renaday as French Milkman/Le Petit Cafe Cook/Truck Movers (uncredited)\n\nMel Blanc as Frog (uncredited)\n\nCrew\n\nStory adaptation: Ken Anderson, Larry Clemmons, Eric Cleworth, Vance Gerry, Julius Svendsen, Frank Thomas, Ralph Wright\n\nBased on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe\n\nSupervising animators: Milt Kahl, Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas, John Lounsbery\n\nAnimators: Hal King, Eric Cleworth, Fred Hellmich, Eric Larson, Julius Svendsen, Walt Stanchfield, David Michener\n\nEffects animators: Dan MacManus, Dick Lucas\n\nLayout: Don Griffith, Basil Davidovich, Sylvia Roemer\n\nBackgrounds: Al Dempster, Bill Layne, Ralph Hulett\n\nProduction manager: Don Duckwall\n\nAssistant directors: Ed Hansen, Dan Alguire\n\nSupervising sound editor: Robert O.

It was written by Robert & Richard Sherman at the end of their eight years with Walt Disney Productions. Maurice Chevalier came out of retirement to sing this song for the movie's soundtrack.

It was also released as a 45 rpm single, in a version sung only by Phil Harris. That version doesn't have the cartoon voices of the other release.
