        "text": "Walt Disney released the first-ever full-length animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in 1937, sparking an artistic movement that has since allowed audiences across the world to fall in love with countless animated characters, creatures, animals and more.\n\nNow nearly a century later, Disney also leads the movement to retell these beloved classics with live-action techniques, making waves for fresh takes on films like Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and, just around the corner, The Little Mermaid.\n\nHere is ET's guide to the live-action remakes of your favorite animated films.\n\nTHE DISNEY PRINCESSES\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937): Adaptation Coming\n\nBased on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale, Snow White was the first full-length animated feature film and Disney's first princess.\n\nDisney is currently in production on a live-action remake starring Rachel Zegler as the titular princess. Gal Gadot will also star, along with Andrew Burnap and Martin Klebba. The project does not yet have a release date, but Zegler was spotted in costume on set in May 2022.\n\nThough still far from finished, the project is not free from controversy. Shortly after her casting announcement, Zegler spoke out about racist criticism she received from fans angry about a Latina woman playing Snow White. Later, actor Peter Dinklage said he was \"taken aback\" by Disney's decision to adapt the film, criticizing the studio for promoting a \"backward\" depiction of people with dwarfism. The studio responded to the latter complaint, saying they had consulted with the dwarfism community and were working to avoid reinforcing the stereotypes presented in the original film.\n\nCinderella (1950): Adaptation Released in 2015\n\nCinderella's story may be one of Hollywood's most beloved. This princess' tale has been told and retold dozens of times throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, including Disney's original animated film in 1950. The studio released a live-action adaptation of the movie in 2015 starring Lily James as Cinderella, with Richard Madden as the prince and Cate Blanchett as the evil stepmother.\n\nThe adaptation was nominated for Best Costume Design at the 2016 Academy Awards.\n\nSleeping Beauty (1959): Maleficent Adaptations\n\nThough Disney has never adapted its original 1959 Sleeping Beauty under the same title, the studio did release Maleficent in 2014, a retelling of the same narrative from the point of view of the kingdom's evil fairy.\n\nElle Fanning played Princess Aurora in 2014, with Angelina Jolie as Maleficent. Both actresses reprised their roles in 2019 for a sequel to the original adaptation, Maleficent: Mistress of Evil.\n\nThe 2014 film was nominated for Best Costume Design at the 2015 Academy Awards, and the sequel was nominated for Best Hair and Makeup Design in 2020.\n\nThe Little Mermaid (1989): Adaptation Coming May 2023\n\nA live-action Ariel will soon be part of (y)our world. Based on the original 1989 animated feature, starring Jodi Benson as the beloved mermaid Ariel, Disney's 2023 adaptation will star Halle Bailey in the same role. The casting made waves for its racial inclusivity, and the teaser trailer's release in 2022 spawned a trend of parents sharing videos of their young Black daughters reacting to the princess' reveal.\n\nBailey also faced backlash for her casting, having to push against racist claims that casting a Black actress went against the original fairy tale, but Benson supported Bailey's portrayal from the beginning of the adaptation's announcement.\n\n\"I'm SO proud of you & your beautiful performance as Ariel,\" Benson wrote on Instagram after the teaser trailer's release at the D23 Expo. \"It was so wonderful to celebrate with your family.\"\n\nThe live-action film will also feature Daveed Diggs, Melissa McCarthy, Javier Bardem, Jacob Tremblay and Awkwafina. It is set for theatrical release on May 26, 2023.\n\nBeauty and the Beast (1991): Adaptation Released in 2017\n\nBeauty and the Beast, the origin story for Princess Belle, was Disney's 30th animated feature film at the time of its release in 1991. The studio then released a live-action adaptation of the beloved fairy tale in 2017, making it the second live-action retelling of their original princesses, after Cinderella.\n\nEmma Watson took on the princess role for the 2017 release. The adaptation also featured Dan Stevens, Luke Evans, Kevin Kline, Josh Gad, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Audra McDonald, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Ian McKellen and Emma Thompson.\n\nAt the time of its release, some sources believed it to be the most expensive movie musical ever made (the New York Times reported a cost of $300 million), but the gamble paid off: the film eventually passed $1 billion at the box office, and was nominated for Best Costume Design and Best Production Design at the 2018 Oscars.\n\nAladdin (1992): Adaptation Released in 2019, Another One on Its Way?\n\nThough Disney's Aladdin is technically the story about its titular protagonist, it also houses one of the franchise's original princesses: Jasmine. Linda Larkin voiced the princess in the 1991 animated feature, and Lea Salonga provided the singing voice. Robin Williams starred as the Genie, and Scott Weinger played Aladdin.\n\nDisney released a live-action adaptation of the film in 2019 starring Naomi Scott as Jasmine, with Mena Massoud as Aladdin and Will Smith as the Genie.\n\nFollowing the film's box office success, several outlets reported in 2019 that Disney was exploring a live-action sequel, ostensibly an adaptation of the animated sequel from 1994.\n\nIn 2022, Billy Magnussen also told ScreenRant that Disney+ was in production on a live-action spinoff series featuring his character, Prince Anders.\n\nPocahontas (1995): No Adaptation\n\nPocahontas remains one of the few original princesses that Disney has reportedly never considered for a live-action adaptation. Though the original movie performed well at the box office -- and even won two Academy Awards -- its depiction of Native Americans and American colonizers is probably best left alone. In 2019, composer Alan Menken said the story would be too tricky to adapt.\n\n\"I don't know if we'll ever be able to do Pocahontas, I think that story is going to be difficult. With modern sensibilities, it'd be hard – you're going to offend somebody – so I don't know,\" Menken said.\n\nMulan (1998): Adaptation Released in 2020\n\nMulan marks the final member of Disney's original princess lineup, and her original 1998 film remains a fan-favorite. Disney released a live-action adaptation in 2020. Ming-Na Wen played the princess in the original film, and Lea Salonga provided the singing voice. Yifei Liu took on the role for the adaptation.\n\nThe film's release was unfortunately marred by controversy. Much of the movie was filmed in the autonomous region of Xinjiang, where China holds detention camps for Uyghur Muslims and other religious minorities. Human Rights Watch stated in 2017 that the areas \"are contrary to China’s constitution and violate international human rights law.\"\n\nAudiences called for a boycott of the film following this news, along with word that Liu, the film's star, had released a statement publicly supporting the Hong Kong police who many argued had used excessive force in response to the unrest of the city's 2019 uprisings.\n\nDisney CFO Christine McCarthy acknowledged the conflict -- including the fact that Disney thanked the Chinese government in the film's credits -- in 2020, saying that it's standard practice \"to acknowledge in a film's credits the national and local governments that allowed you to film there. So, in our credits, it recognized both China and locations in New Zealand,\" she said. \"I would just leave it at that, but it has generated a lot of issues for us.\"\n\nThe Princess and the Frog (2009): No Adaptation\n\nWriter Stella Meghie told The Hollywood Reporter in 2022 that she had pitched a live-action adaptation of Princess Tiana's story, but nothing came of the offer. Disney has not announced if they will adapt The Princess and the Frog.\n\nTangled (2010): No Adaptation\n\nDisney had not announced any live-action adaptation of Tangled, which tells the story of Rapunzel.\n\nBrave (2012): No Adaptation\n\nDisney has not announced any live-action adaption of Brave, which tells the story of Princess Merida. A live-action Merida did appear, however, as a recurring character on the television show Once Upon a Time. She was portrayed by Amy Manson.\n\nFrozen (2013): No Adaptation\n\nDisney has not announced plans to adapt Princesses Anna and Elsa's story as a live-action film.\n\nMoana (2016): Adaptation Coming\n\nDwayne Johnson announced in April 2023 that production is underway for a live-action adaptation of Disney's 2016 Moana, the story of a Polynesian princess. Johnson voiced Maui, demigod and mentor for Moana, in the original movie.\n\n\"#MAUI changed my life (miss you grandpa) and I’m honored to partner with @DisneyStudios to tell our story thru the realm of music & dance, which at the core is who we are as Polynesian people🪝,\" Johnson wrote on Twitter.\n\nOTHER DISNEY ANIMATION\n\nPinocchio (1940): Adaptation Released in 2022\n\nPinocchio was the second animated feature created by Disney, after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The studio released a live-action adaptation of the film in 2022, featuring Tom Hanks as the story's woodcarver, Geppetto. Cynthia Erivo played the Blue Fairy, with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Pinocchio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jiminy Cricket, and Keegan-Michael Key as Honest John.\n\nThough the film was initially planned as a theatrical release, COVID-19 delays ultimately pushed the movie to be released directly to Disney+.\n\nFantasia (1940): The Sorcerer's Apprentice Released in 2010\n\nThough Disney has never recreated the entirety of its 1940 musical anthology classic, the 2010 live-action Sorcerer's Apprentice recreates the original movie's most famous sequence. The film starred Nicolas Cage as Balthazar Blake, the young apprentice of the sorcerer Yen Sid, who was originally played by Mickey Mouse in the 1940 film.\n\nDumbo (1941): Adaptation Released in 2019\n\nFirst released in 1941, Disney released a live-action adaptation of Dumbo in 2019. Tim Burton directed the film, with Colin Farrell starring as the protagonist circus equestrian. Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Eva Green and Alan Arkin filled out the main cast.\n\nBambi (1942): Adaptation Coming\n\nDisney announced in 2020 it would release a live-action CGI adaptation of Bambi, originally released in 1942. At the time of the announcement, creators said the film would act as a \"companion piece\" to the existing remakes of The Lion King and The Jungle Book, as all three required similar VFX technology to render the photorealistic animals.\n\nDisney has not yet set a release date for the film.\n\nPeter Pan (1953): Peter Pan & Wendy Coming April 2023\n\nDisney's 1953 Peter Pan also introduced Disney audiences to fan-favorite Tinker Bell, originally a Disney princess before moving to lead the Disney Fairies franchise. Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, along with friends Wendy, Michael and John (and enemies Captain Hook and Smee) have made numerous live-action appearances over the years. Disney is now gearing up to release its own adaptation, Peter Pan & Wendy, on April 28, 2023. The film will be released directly to Disney+.\n\nDisney is also rumored to be working on another adaptation, Tink, with Reese Witherspoon providing the voice for Tinker Bell, but the status of this project is less certain.\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1954): Adaptations Released in 2010 and 2016\n\nTim Burton first directed a live-action version of Alice in Wonderland in 2010, though the film was not billed as a direct adaptation of Disney's 1954 original. Johnny Depp starred as the Mad Hatter, with Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen.\n\nAll four actors reprised their role's for Burton's 2016 sequel, Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass.\n\nLady and the Tramp (1955): Adaptation Released in 2019\n\nDisney released a live-action CGI adaptation of its 1955 film in 2019. The film featured voice acting from Tessa Thompson, Justin Theroux, Janelle Monáe and Sam Elliott, with live-action appearances from Thomas Mann, Kiersey Clemons, Yvette Nicole Brown, F. Murray Abraham, Adrian Martinez and Ken Jeong.\n\nThe film was released directly to Disney+.\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961): Adaptations Released in 1996 and 2021, One More to Come\n\nDisney first released One Hundred and One Dalmatians in 1961. The studio later adapted the movie for live-action in 1996 (this time styled as 101 Dalmatians).\n\nIn 2021, Disney released Cruella, a live-action origin story for the film's beloved villain. Emma Stone starred as the titular protagonist, and Emma Thompson played Cruella's boss.\n\nDisney confirmed it was in production on a sequel in 2021.\n\nWinnie the Pooh (1961): Christopher Robin Adaptation in 2018\n\nDisney acquired rights to the Winnie the Pooh character in 1961, and he soon became a Disney franchise adapted into dozens of animated shorts and feature-length films. Fans saw Disney's first-ever live-action adaptation of the beloved bear in 2018's Christopher Robin.\n\nThe Sword and the Stone (1963): Adaptation Coming\n\nThe original The Sword and the Stone was Disney's 18th animated feature film and the final movie released prior to Walt Disney's death. The studio first announced plans to release a live-action adaptation of the film in 2015, and named Juan Carlos Fresnadillo as the director in 2018. The release date for the project is still unknown.\n\nRobin Hood (1973): Adaptation Coming\n\nDisney first brought the Robin Hood story to life through its beloved anthropomorphic characters in the 1973 animated film.

Netflix released an unrelated (but also live-action) depiction of the same tale in 2018, titled Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle.\n\nGeorge of the Jungle (1967): Adaptation Released 1997\n\nFirst introduced as an animated spoof of Tarzan, George of the Jungle was a beloved television program of the 1960s.
