        "text": "“I believe in loyalty. When a woman reaches an age she likes, she should stick with it.”\n\n— Eva Gabor\n\nEva Gabor, the youngest of the three glamorous Gabor sisters (Zsa Zsa (born in 1917) and Magda (born in 1915) were the other two), for decades captivated audiences across the planet, with her enchanting European flair and comedic talent.\n\nEva’s story is a reminder of the golden era of Hollywood, where stars were not just faces on the screen but captivating, all-round personalities who lived their life to the fullest.\n\nHer contributions to entertainment and her infectious humor made her a subject of admiration for decades and a figure still celebrated today in the annals of show business history.\n\nIf you aren’t subscribed yet, hit the subscribe button below to receive the Adorable Stories every weekend, directly in your inbox:\n\nChildhood\n\nEva’s early years were steeped in the grandeur of a bygone era, within a Hungary that was culturally rich, yet marred by the aftermath of World War I and the tensions leading to World War II.\n\nThe Gabor family was affluent: her father, Vilmos Gabor, an army officer, who achieved the rank of colonel, and her mother, Jolie Gabor (born Janka Tilleman), was a successful jeweller and socialite who instilled in her daughters the value of poise and sophistication. Both of Jolie’s parents were of Galician Jewish ancestry (Galicia was then part of the Austrian Empire, present-day in Poland and in Ukraine).\n\nEva was born on February 11, 1919.\n\nThe young Eva was surrounded by opulence in a Budapest that thrived on its artistic and intellectual pursuits. Despite the political turmoil of the times, the Gabor household was a haven of creativity and elegance, elements that would later become hallmarks of Eva’s persona.\n\nEven as a child, Eva’s vivacious spirit and natural charm were evident. She attended private schools and was afforded the luxuries of dance and language lessons, fostering a sense of performance that would serve her well in her future career.\n\n“I made up my mind to be an actress when I was 4 years old.”\n\n— Eva Gabor\n\nThe Gabor home was a social hub, and Eva, along with her sisters Zsa Zsa and Magda, learned to captivate an audience from a very young age.\n\nWhen Hitler invaded Hungary in 1944, Zsa Zsa and Eva were already living outside the country.\n\nAlthough the Gabors had converted from Judaism to Catholicism in 1928, the eldest sister Magda and their parents were promptly arrested by the Gestapo.\n\nMagda had been in fact secretly involved in the anti-Nazi underground movements, but, fortunately, she also was the lover of the Portuguese ambassador to Budapest, who pulled strings and got her, Vilmos and Jolie released.\n\nThe Dazzling Dawn in Hollywood\n\nArriving in the United States in the 1930s, Eva brought with her an irresistible blend of European sophistication and a zest for life that Hollywood could not ignore.\n\nHer earliest roles in the 1940s, such as a small part in the musical “Forced Landing” (1941), were often uncredited, but Eva’s distinctive Hungarian accent and continental flair made her stand out.\n\nHer breakout moment came with her performance in “A Royal Scandal” (1945), directed by the legendary Otto Preminger, and produced by Ernst Lubitsch.\n\nAlthough not the lead, Eva’s role showcased her fantastic comedic timing and her ability to star alongside more established actors. This performance opened new doors, and Eva soon found herself working with major studios like MGM and Paramount Pictures.\n\nThe late 1940s and early 1950s saw Eva Gabor’s career gaining momentum. She appeared on the silver screen with films such as “The Last Time I Saw Paris” (1954) (available in full and HD on youtube.com), starring Elizabeth Taylor, and “Artists and Models” (1955), which featured Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.\n\nEva’s roles often played up her exotic allure, and she quickly became known for portraying the quintessential European sophisticate woman.\n\nGreen Acres\n\nHer versatility would eventually lead to success on television, most notably as Lisa Douglas, the lovably eccentric wife in the hit sitcom “Green Acres” (1965-1971).\n\nAs the pastoral charm of “Green Acres” faded into television history, Eva Gabor’s career blossomed in new and unexpected ways.\n\nPost-“Green Acres,” Eva gracefully transitioned from her iconic role as the lovable Lisa Douglas to explore various other facets of her talents.\n\nIn the years following the sitcom, Eva remained a sought-after personality for television, making guest appearances on popular shows such as “The Love Boat” and “Fantasy Island,” where she continued to enchant audiences with her effervescent charm. Her ability to captivate remained undiminished, and her television appearances became treasured moments for her fans.\n\nVoice Acting\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s also saw Eva venturing into voice acting, where she lent her distinctive voice to animated projects.\n\nOne of her most memorable roles was that of Duchess in Disney’s “The Aristocats” (1970), where she voiced the elegant feline protagonist.\n\nHer work in animation showcased her versatility, endearing her to a new generation of admirers.\n\nPersonal Life\n\n“Love is a game that two can play and both win.”\n\n— Eva Gabor\n\nEva Gabor’s personal life, particularly her marriages, captivated the public’s imagination as much as her performances did on screen for decades."
