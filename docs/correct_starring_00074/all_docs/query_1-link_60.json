Now it's up to the rough-and-tumble alley cat, Thomas O'Malley, and his band of swingin' jazz cats to save the day.",

        "text": "While the animation is cute and the film creates an incredibly likable main cast of characters each with their own unique personality and presence, the narrative is incredibly basic and lacks any deeper dimension when it comes to purpose or poignance.\n\nAugust 15, 2023\n\nI kind of feel the same way about the Aristocats as I felt about Fun, Fancy and Free. Both felt very lazy and derivative of better films.\n\nMay 8, 2019\n\nThe Aristocats is in there with the good ones. It is light and pleasant and funny, the characterization is strong, and the voices of Phil Harris and Eva Gabor are charming in their absolute rightness.\n\nJuly 9, 2018\n\nThe carefully painted Paris setting has the watery air of Ardizzone, while light and colour are used beautifully throughout.\n\nNovember 28, 2017\n\nBefore the disastrous Aughts, was there a worse decade for Disney animated features than the 1970s?\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nA cute, feline version of \"Lady and the Tramp\" that should enthrall families . . . and, of course, cat lovers.\n\nJune 22, 2017\n\nInsofar as the film has any real ambition driving it, that ambition seems to be that the Disney brand name must be kept alive until somebody could figure out what to do with it.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
