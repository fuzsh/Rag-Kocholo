        "text": "Released: June 22nd, 1977\n\nRun time: 1 hour 18 minutes\n\nNoteworthy cast members: Bob Newhart (Papa Elf from Elf), Eva Gabor (Duchess, I guess she wasn’t affecting a French accent for Aristocats, glad that was cleared up), Geraldine Page, and Pat Buttram (Sheriff of Nottingham),\n\nAwards: nominated for an Oscar for the song “Someone’s Waiting for You”\n\nWhere to find it: rent it here, buy it digitally here\n\nAfter The Jungle Book and before The Little Mermaid, The Rescuers was a major hit that gave Disney Animation Studios confidence it could succeed without Walt (it even did better than Star Wars: A New Hope in some countries). There are some major time gaps there, 10 years between Rescuers and Jungle Book and 12 between it and The Little Mermaid (that does not bode well for the next few movies I’m watching in the canon). What’s surprising (for me anyway) is I don’t consider The Rescuers a Disney classic, Winnie the Pooh is 100% a classic, The Aristocats maybe, but not this one. Does this show that box office successes are not a guarantee of lasting fame? Hmmm.\n\nAnyways, this was the last film to be animated by members of Walt’s “nine old men” (basically the O.G. group of animators), it also utilizes the colors blue and red to represent innocence and evil, a technique that would be used in later Disney films (such as Aladdin, random note, my ability to type today is so off for no reason, I am going to break my backspace key). Speaking of old white guys, this was the first “feminist” Disney film (more on that in a bit)!\n\nThe Rescuers also marks the first time a new talent, Don Bluth, was made a lead animator. Since the studio was losing some veterans they needed new talent, unfortunately Bluth was not happy with how the studio was run and would depart a few years later with some other Disney animators (The Rescuers and Pete’s Dragon were the last Disney films Bluth received credit for although he supposedly did some work on Fox and the Hound too) to begin their own animation studio. Bluth would go on to work on hits such as Anastasia (a personal favorite of mine). Bluth saw the same thing I did, Sleeping Beauty was an artistic masterpiece and the movies that followed were not even close to being the same quality, it really is too bad Disney studios did not listen to Bluth (I believe he could have been the next Eric Larson if he had stayed).\n\nThe Rescuers was based on the books, The Rescuers and Miss Bianca by Margery Sharp. This was the only book I had not heard of (regarding source material in the canon, I honestly cannot comprehend a time before Harry Potter in children’s literature), Barnes and Noble provides a sample of The Rescuers and it is about a lady mouse who is chairwoman of a society which provides comfort to prisoners and the word play is very clever. Miss Bianca (which I could only find a summary for) seems to have inspired more of the plot for this movie, it is about a woman who kidnaps a little girl and takes her to the Diamond Palace.\n\nBack to this being Disney’s first feminist film. Okay, so yes, Bianca is a woman who can be considered strong and I must say Eva Gabor is far more memorable for this role than Duchess…BUT she does not face any repercussions because she is a woman (the head mouse is sort of like “yeah she’s a lady, but hey why not?” I paraphrased, what I’m trying to say is the conversation over women’s capabilities usually goes differently), and her looks play a major role in how she is perceived (the other manly mice fawn over her when she comes into a room), and the man (Bob Newhart) still got top billing over her (so she’s technically not even the main role), and she’s a terrible character! She’s super bland and has very little personality. Yes, I have taken the time period this was made into consideration and I know Disney has taken some strides in making actual feminist characters (Mulan, woot!), but this isn’t one of those times, it’s just a tiny, baby step. All of this being said, this movie is far more gender equality forward than some later films, like The Little Mermaid.\n\nThe character of Bianca aside, Penny is a delightful breath of fresh air in this movie. She is so strong and vulnerable at the same time which is what I want from all characters in every medium. The whole scene with her and the mustached cat then, of course, the scene with her and Medusa both had me sobbing. Any time Penny thought she wasn’t good enough to be adopted and I just wanted to give her a hug…God I’m tearing up now…She was such a wonderfully honest character and by far one of my favorite children in the canon. In fact, she’s better than all of them, Mowgli and Alice never had me ugly crying and laughing like Penny did. One thing I wish is Penny’s bear didn’t look like Pooh, I know that’s oddly specific, but I felt like it was a cameo that overstayed its welcome and if the bear already has a whole story and personality (and usually belongs to Christopher Robin) then it takes away from the rest of the story.\n\nMedusa…well, she was sort of a mish-mosh villain. She was a lot like Cruella (a bad driver with style), but she was also like a not-as-good precursor to Ursula (the alligators or crocodiles being like Flotsam and Jetsam).\n\nThe information I read on this movie said Medusa plays into the feminist theme because she assumes more control than her male cohort, all I have to say to that is the Evil Queen didn’t even have a male cohort and she came from 1937. Something that gave Medusa more bite than other villains is the scene I mentioned earlier with her and Penny (here is a link, I just watched it again and started crying). This scene is masterful in the way it depicts innocence and cruelty, Penny is this naturally beautiful soul and Medusa strips away her mask (the makeup) to reveal her monstrous appearance beneath and she only takes makeup off half her face making her look even more deformed, then the comment about no one wanting to adopt Penny is delivered offhand showing how Medusa is beyond morally depraved. This scene reminded me of Dumbo in how unconsciously profound it is.\n\nFun fact, Milt Kahl did all of the animation for Madame Medusa, he based her on his ex-wife. By the way, was I the only one who found Medusa’s dress to be extremely inappropriate for a children’s movie?\n\nThe character animations were about the same as they have been for the last few movies, at least the mice’s eyes were less creepy than that mouse in Aristocats. Everything else was terrible, visually. The backgrounds were a sloppy mess, they were blurry, dull, the wall paper in the Rescue Aid Society meeting reminded me of vomit…or it made me want to vomit, something like that. The mice seemed to change size throughout the movie because there was no thought of dimensions and a lack of attention to detail in general, objects kept vanishing. Rather than enveloping the audience in “a whole new world”, the action was just taking place in front of a back drop, like a high school play and not a studio that created such artistic marvels as Sleeping Beauty.\n\nLook at the difference between these two movies in terms of quality, am I crazy? Things are supposed to improve over time, not get worse.\n\nAnyways, a pleasant distraction from the lack of integrity was the compelling story of this movie. The ending is pretty predictable but the twists and turns along the way were enjoyable. It reminded me of Oliver Twist, and didn’t feel very original but it might have seemed more original at the time and that is just my 21st century brain. Either way, the character of Penny aside, this didn’t quite ignite the same Disney magic I have seen in other movies.\n\nNext up is Fox and the Hound, I am definitely going to need tissues for that one!"
