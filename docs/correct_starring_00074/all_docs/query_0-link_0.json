        "text": "Hungarian-American actress and socialite (1919–1995)\n\nThe native form of this personal name is Gábor Éva. This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\n\nEva Gabor ( AY-və gə-BOR, -⁠ GAH-bor; February 11, 1919 – July 4, 1995) was a Hungarian-American actress and socialite. Gabor voiced Duchess and Miss Bianca in the Disney animations The Aristocats (1970), The Rescuers (1977), and The Rescuers Down Under (1990). She was popular in her role on the 1965–1971 television sitcom Green Acres as Lisa Douglas, the wife of Eddie Albert's character Oliver Wendell Douglas. Gabor was an actress in film, on Broadway, and on television. She was also a businesswoman, marketing wigs, clothing, and beauty products. Her elder sisters, Zsa Zsa and Magda Gabor, were also actresses and socialites.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nGabor was born in Budapest, Hungary, the youngest of three daughters of Vilmos Gábor, a soldier, and his wife, trained jeweler Jolie (born Janka Tilleman). Her parents were both from Hungarian Jewish families.[1][2][3] She was the first of the sisters to immigrate to the U.S., shortly after her first marriage to a Swedish osteopath, Dr. Eric Drimmer, whom she married in 1937 when she was 18 years old.[4]\n\nEarly career\n\n[edit]\n\nHer first movie role was in the U.S. in 1941's Forced Landing at Paramount Pictures. During the 1950s, she appeared in several feature films, including The Last Time I Saw Paris, starring Elizabeth Taylor; and Artists and Models, which featured Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. These roles were bit parts. In 1953, she was given her own television talk show, The Eva Gabor Show, which ran for one season (1953–54). Through the rest of the 1950s and early 1960s she appeared on television and in movies. She appeared in one episode of the mystery series Justice and was on the game show What's My Line? as the \"mystery challenger.\" Her film appearances during this era included a remake of My Man Godfrey, Gigi, and It Started with a Kiss.\n\nGreen Acres\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1965, Gabor got the role of Lisa Douglas, whose attorney husband Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert) decides to leave the \"rat race\" of city life. He buys a farm in a rural community, forcing Lisa to leave her beloved big-city urban life. The Paul Henning sitcom Green Acres aired on CBS. Green Acres was set in Hooterville, the same backdrop for Petticoat Junction (1963–70), and would occasionally cross over with its sister sitcom. Despite proving to be a ratings hit, staying in the top 20 for its first four seasons, Green Acres, along with another sister show, The Beverly Hillbillies, was cancelled in 1971 in the CBS network's \"rural purge\" — a policy to get rid of the network's rural-based television shows.\n\nIn 1966, Eva Gabor and Johnny Carson played Twister on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.[5][6][7]\n\nLater career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1972, Gabor launched her eponymous fashion collection with Luis Estévez, a Cuban-born American fashion designer.[8][9][10]\n\nGabor later did voice-over work for Disney movies, providing the European-accented voices of Duchess in The Aristocats, and Miss Bianca in The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under, as well as the Queen of Time in the Sanrio film Nutcracker Fantasy. She was a panelist on the Gene Rayburn-hosted Match Game. From 1983 to 1984, she was on the Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour starring Gene Rayburn and Jon Bauman.[11]\n\nEva appeared as Aunt Renee in the fourth season of “Hart to Hart”, and in 1983, she reunited with Eddie Albert on Broadway as the Grand Duchess Olga Katrina in You Can't Take It with You. In 1990, she attempted a TV series comeback in the CBS sitcom pilot Close Encounters; the pilot aired as a special that summer, but did not make it to series status. She toured post-communist Hungary after a 40-year absence on an episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nEva Gabor was married five times. She had no children:\n\nEric Valdemar Drimmer, a Swedish-born masseur turned osteopath and psychologist. They wed in London on June 3, 1937, and divorced in Los Angeles, California, on February 25, 1942 (the divorce was finalized on March 6); Gabor claimed cruelty, saying, \"I wanted to have babies and lead a simple family life but my husband objected to my having children\".[12]\n\nCharles Isaacs, an American investment broker.[13] They married on September 27, 1943, and were divorced on April 2, 1949.\n\nJohn Elbert Williams, MD, a plastic surgeon. They married on April 8, 1956, and were divorced on March 20, 1957.[14]\n\nRichard Brown, a textile manufacturer, who later became a writer and director.[15][16] They married at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 4, 1959, and divorced in Santa Monica, California, in June 1973.[15][17][18]\n\nFrank Gard Jameson Sr., an aerospace executive and former vice president of Rockwell International.[19] They married in the Vivian Webb Chapel of The Webb Schools, Claremont, California on September 21, 1973. The couple divorced in 1983.[20] Gabor became a stepmother to Jameson's four children.[19]\n\nGabor also had a long term on-and off affair with actor Glenn Ford which began during the filming of Don't Go Near the Water in 1957. They dated between their marriages and almost married in the early 1970s.[21]\n\nAfter her final marriage, Gabor was involved in a relationship with TV producer Merv Griffin until her death.[22][23][24] Reuters reported that this was a platonic relationship to hide Griffin's suspected homosexuality.[25]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nGabor died in Los Angeles on Independence Day 1995, from respiratory failure and pneumonia, following a fall in a bathtub in Mexico,[26] where she had been on vacation.[27] Her funeral was held on July 11, 1995, at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Beverly Hills.[28]\n\nThe youngest sister, Eva predeceased her elder sisters and her mother. Eldest sister Magda and mother Jolie Gabor both died two years later, in 1997. Elder sister Zsa Zsa died from cardiac arrest on December 18, 2016.[29][30]\n\nTheatre roles\n\n[edit]\n\nOpening date Closing date Title Role Theatre January 24, 1950 July 14, 1951 The Happy Time Mignonette Plymouth March 26, 1956 March 31, 1956 Little Glass Clock Gabrielle John Golden January 31, 1958 February 8, 1958 Present Laughter Joanna Lyppiatt Belasco March 18, 1963 November 9, 1963 Tovarich Tatiana\n\n(succeeded Vivien Leigh October 21) Winter Garden April 4, 1983 January 1, 1984 You Can't Take It with You The Grand Duchess Olga Katrina\n\n(succeeded Colleen Dewhurst) Plymouth\n\nRoyale\n\nFilm roles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1941 Forced Landing Johanna Van Deuren New York Town Minor Role Uncredited Pacific Blackout Marie Duval 1942 Star Spangled Rhythm Eva Gabor Uncredited 1945 A Royal Scandal Countess Demidow 1946 The Wife of Monte Cristo Mme.
