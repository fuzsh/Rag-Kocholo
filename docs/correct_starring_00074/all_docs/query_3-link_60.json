        "text": "Eddie Albert and His Acres\n\nI just saw a clip of a movie on Turner Classic Movies featuring Frank Sinatra – “The Joker Is Wild”. Sinatra comes out on stage dressed in some ridiculous oversized – almost clown like clothing – The audience is anticipating some first class crooning – but Frankie (playing Joe E. Lewis) has had his throat cut by gangsters – so instead of breaking into a song that he MC suggests, “All The Way” – Lewis’ voices sadly trails off – and instead – Lewis goes into a stand-up comedy routine….. oh well\n\nBut in the pit below the stage is a piano player who is there to provide accompaniment to the song – is the character Austin Mack (Eddie Albert).\n\nSo for some reason that got me to thinking about an old TV program called “Green Acres” starring Albert along with an unlikely pick, Eva Gabor. The roots of the silly but popular program came out of a 1950 radio series called “Granby’s Green Acres”.\n\nI had heard somewhere that Albert was a dedicated environmentalist and looking into it a bit further, he did indeed become involved in lobbying to protect the forests in the Northwest and also he was involved in establishing “Earth Day”. He was part of many causes and was a member of the National Recreation and Parks Association as well as the Boy Scouts of America’s conservation efforts.\n\nMuch like his character in Green Acres, Oliver Wendall Douglas, Albert farmed his property planting cornfields, organic vegetables and a greenhouse. His real-life wife, Mexican-born actress Margo Margarita drew the attention of the House Un American Activities due to her left leaning sympathies – and both were blacklisted.\n\nAnd Eva Gabor (Lisa Douglas in Green Acres)? Not an activist by any means – but she did marry five times and after all those failed marriages elected to settle for boyfriends – one being Glen Ford and a platonic one with Merv Griffin.\n\nThe theme song for the TV program was composed by Vic Mizzy who also composed “The Jones Boy” most successfully popularized by the Mills Brothers which reached number 15 on the pop charts in 1954.\n\nMizzy also wrote a number one song for Les Brown in 1939, “My Dreams Are Getting Better All the Time” in 1945. The song was also recorded that year by the Johnny Long Orchestra – and also the Phil Moore Four – both versions going to number 3.\n\nInterestingly, after a nearly 40 year absence from the pop charts, Mizzy’s “Adsam’s Groove” by M.C. Hammer would go number 7 Hot 100, number 15 R&B and number 4 UK! I don’t believe Mizzy and Hammer ever teamed up again.\n\nEddie Albert Selected Discography\n\n45 – Kapp 102 – One God b/w For This I’m Thankful – June, 1954\n\nMost likely Albert’s earliest single\n\n45 – Kapp 134 – with Sondra Lee – Little Child b/w Jenny Kissed Me – January, 1956\n\n45 – Columbia 43757 – Green Acres – August, 1966\n\n45 – Columbia 43850 – Don’t Think Twice It’s All Right b/w A Smile Is Just A Frown (Turned Upside Down) – October, 1966\n\nEddie goes Folk!\n\nLP – Columbia 2599 – The Eddie Albert Album – 1966\n\n45 – Bell 837 – A Prayer for the 70’s b/w On Being Average – November, 1969\n\nAlbert’s final single\n\n45 EP – Warner Bros 254 Promo – U.S. Savings Bonds – with Eva Gabor dialog – 1967"
