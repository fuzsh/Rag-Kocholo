        "text": "Actor Eva Gabor, youngest of the celebrated Gabor sisters and best known for her role as a socialite stuck on a farm on television's Green Acres, died Tuesday. She was 74.\n\nMiss Gabor died at 10:05 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from respiratory distress and other infections, hospital spokesman Ron Wise said.\n\nShe entered the hospital on June 21 after falling and breaking her hip, Wise said. She also was found to be suffering from pneumonia, he said.\n\nSeveral family members were at Miss Gabor's bedside when she died, Wise said.\n\nThe Hungarian-born Eva, sisters Zsa Zsa and Magda, and their mother, Jolie, all immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and '40s. By the 1950s, the family, especially Eva and Zsa Zsa, had achieved worldwide celebrity.\n\n\"There are four women in our family, and we're all doing well . . .,\" Miss Gabor said in a 1961 interview. \"We worked very hard, but we were also very lucky.\"\n\nGreen Acres, which ran on CBS from 1965 to 1971, cast Gabor as a Park Avenue penthouse dweller transplanted to rural Hooterville because lawyer husband Oliver Wendell Douglas (Eddie Albert) preferred fresh air to Times Square. Lisa Douglas preferred Manhattan stores to farm chores and wore gowns in the kitchen as she fried up hotcakes and entertained her neighbor's pet pig, Arnold.\n\nThe Gabor girls were born to an upper-middle-class Budapest family that at first did not approve of their interest in show business.\n\nNonetheless, Miss Gabor moved to Hollywood in 1939 and soon landed a contract with Paramount Pictures. Her career didn't take off until she played an unemployed acrobat in the 1950 Broadway show The Happy Time.\n\nSuccess in the theater production earned her guest roles on TV variety shows and led to her own interview program, The Eva Gabor Show.\n\nIt was during this period that the much-married sisters gained notoriety for their love lives. Eva Gabor, married at least five times, was credited with coming up with the truism: \"Marriage is too interesting an experiment to be tried only once or twice.\"\n\nZsa Zsa and Eva Gabor were often mistaken for one another, although the older sister's legal troubles, including a highly publicized run-in with a police office, gave her the more colorful reputation.\n\n\"It's awfully boring to be called the \"good Gabor,' \" Eva Gabor said in a 1990 interview. \"Why should we be linked together, darling? That annoys the hell out of me. Because we have very different lives and what is white for her is black for me. Of course, she's my sister and I love her.\"\n\nIn later years, the platinum beauty whose name conjured up images of Hollywood glamor and high-priced living ran a multimillion-dollar wig company.\n\nBut in a 1988 interview, she said: \"I go to the 10-cent store. Because of my allergies, I like to buy very cheap makeup with no perfume.\"\n\n\"I buy things on sale. The prices today are shocking.\"\n\nThough she was best known for Green Acres, Miss Gabor also had a career on the big screen, with parts in The Last Time I Saw Paris, Artists and Models, My Man Godfrey, Don't Go Near the Water, and Gigi.\n\nIn 1990, Miss Gabor went back to the farm when she starred in the made-for-TV movie Return to Green Acres."
