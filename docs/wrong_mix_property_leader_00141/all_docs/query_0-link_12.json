        "text": "bmouaprin...@gmail.com\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\nPetitioning U.S District Court of Minnesota\n\nFree Seng Xiong (Keeb Thawj Xeeb)\n\nPao Doua Xiong Sterling Heights, MI\n\nThey say history repeats itself and it holds true, especially for Hmongs. Through-out history, it has been recorded that we’ve fought many wars. Most of the biggest and severest is in what is present day China, between 3000 BC and early 1800’s. We won many battles during those times but in the end, come short of victory and we are fated to lose the war. Our losses do not stem from our lack of intelligence and/or military shortcomings but due to betrayal and lack of vision for the greater good.\n\nThe first war we ever lost was about 5000 years ago drove us south from the Yellow River. This migration is what eventually led the Hmong people into Laos in the early 1800s. While in Laos, they occupied the mountainous regions and lived in seclusion. There are two wars that the Hmong in Laos were involved in. The first is in the early 1900s when the French colonized Laos. The second was the Vietnam War. It is the latter war that Hmongs are still being hunted by the new Laotian communist government. It is this war that is the root of Seng Xiong's human right advocate activities. In 2013, Seng Xiong’s group took a step forward and began to arouse our fellow Hmongs, and dared to dream of a Hmong Country (Hmoob Tebchaws) which led to his arrest.\n\nAfter the Americans withdrew from Laos in 1975, The Lao communist government continued to hunt down the remnants (Hmong) of General Vang Pao’s soldiers who were left behind in the jungles holding the frontline. From 1975 to present day, there have been many groups that volunteered to surrender and integrate into society but has mysteriously disappeared with no trace. There are still many scattered groups living in the dense jungles that the communist government soldiers are killing, poisoning, and hunting down. They are at a catch ‘22’ where if they come out, they will end up missing with no trace or to stay hidden and live another day, scavenging for food their entire life.\n\nOur history shows us that we don’t always see eye to eye, have never shared the same vision, and rarely come together for a greater cause. The people that accused Seng Xiong are merely pawns of a greater entity that stands against democracy, against equality, and against the existence of a homeland for the Hmong. They do not want us to have homeland because it will make us great. The more scattered we are, the weaker we are. The more influenced we are from all parts of the World, the more we will lose our ingenuity, our history, and most importantly… our identity.\n\nWe live in a nation where equality, faith, and justice are the pillars of life. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for the charges against them. It is easy to turn a blind eye, be spoon-fed of information, or think that you can’t make a difference but we need your support to release Seng. Please sign the petition and support the dismissal of the case, in hopes that one day, we may have a homeland of our own. We need Seng to continue to make his stand on behalf of the jungle Hmong families.\n\nLast but not least, Seng is wrongfully accused for a crime he did not commit. Whether you’re a part of a political group that is in favor of Seng’s vision, against what he stands for, or simply a neutralist who has no interest, please remember that Seng is Hmong. Be the rock that creates the ripple and sign this petition to show your support as a Hmong, as a friend, and on behalf of every wrongfully accused.\n\nThis petition will be delivered to:\n\nU.S District Court of Minnesota\n\nRead the letter\n\nHuman Rights\n\nHunted like Animals\n\nPolitical Advocate\n\nHmong\n\nPao Doua Xiong started this petition with a single signature, and now has 13 supporters. Start a petition today to change something you care about.\n\nStart a petition\n\nUpdates\n\n3 months ago\n\n10 supporters\n\n3 months ago\n\nPao Doua Xiong started this petition\n\nSupporters\n\nbmouaprin...@gmail.com\n\nunread,\n\nto\n\n\n\nI am signing this petition because he was my successor. His responsibility is to fight LPDR & Vietcong troops out of Hmong Land without conditional and allow Hmong people to have free living, farming, and self-determination under the monitoring of the International Laws of No-fly-zone.\n\nI tested him many trips to D.C. before recruiting Seng for my replacement. He knew he had the passion and true scarify for Hmooob. We have gone days and nights without eating and sleeping. While others slept on the nice bed in the Hotel. We slept in the floor. Others people ate fancy food in the Restaurant. We at junk foods in the street with poor Black American.\n\nHe so loves the Hmooob. While his Father Toj Xeem Nyiaj Neeb Xyooj was dying in Michigan. He did not return to attend the funeral service. He kept working @ the UN to plow Hmoob destiny. This era not a single Hmoob can do like him. Back in the 50 while Former General Vang Pao First wife was dead in Nonghet. He was fighting at the front-line in Xannua. He also did not return home until victory. They were the very good warriors.\n\nI shall not condemn Seng for wrong doing without proof. In fact I will check with the Governmental contacts where I left for him to carry on the Hmoob Land for further investigations.\n\nSign: Bee Moua Former Chao Fa Representative in the US, and Former Candidate to Challenge General Syphane Done of LPDR for Lao Presidential in 2002."
