The last two pages of this book list the other published studies. Most books in the series deal with a particular foreign country, describing and analyzing its political, economic, social, and national security systems and institutions, and examining the interrelationships of those systems and the ways they are shaped by cultural factors. Each study is written by a multidisciplinary team of social scientists. The authors seek to provide a basic understanding of the observed society, striving for a dynamic rather than a static portrayal. Particular attention is devoted to the people who make up the society, their origins, dominant beliefs and values, their common interests and the issues on which they are divided, the nature and extent of their involvement with national institutions, and their attitudes toward each other and toward their social system and political order.\n\nThe books represent the analysis of the authors and should not be construed as an expression of an official United States government position, policy, or decision. The authors have sought to adhere to accepted standards of scholarly objectivity. Corrections, additions, and suggestions for changes from readers will be welcomed for use in future editions.

Mortimer Chief Federal Research Division Library of Congress\n\nWashington,\n\nDC 20540-5220\n\niii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis edition supersedes the Area Handbook for Laos, published in 1971.

These individuals include Ralph K. Benesch, who oversees the Country Studies/Area Handbook Program for the Department of the Army, and the staff of the Embassy of the Lao People's DemoStates\n\nRepublic to the United States.

Like its predecessor, this study attempts to review the history and treat in a concise manner the dominant social, political, economic, and military aspects of contemporary Laos. Sources of information included books, scholarly journals, foreign and domestic newspapers, official reports of governments and international organizations, and numerous periodicals on Asian affairs. A word of caution is necessary, however. The government of a closed communist society such as Laos controls information for internal and external consumption, limiting both the scope of coverage and its dissemination. And, data from and on Laos are, on the whole, limited, and often contradictory. at the end of the book, and comments on some of the more valuable sources recommended for further reading appear at the end of each chapter. A glossary and chronology (see Table A) also are included. A word must also be offered on the use of the terms Lao and Laotian. The term Lao refers to people who are ethnic Lao; it is not used to refer to those living in Laos who are members of\n\nChapter bibliographies appear\n\nbrief\n\nother ethnic groups, for example, Vietnamese, Chinese, or Hmong. The term Laotian is used to refer to all the people living in Laos, regardless of ethnic identity. Spellings of place-names used in the book are in most cases those approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names. However, as internal divisions have been drawn and redrawn, place-names within Laos have also changed. Insofar present volume reflects these changes. Measurements are given in the metric system. A conversion table is provided to assist readers unfamiliar with metric mea-\n\nas possible, the\n\nsurements (see table\n\nThe body of the\n\n1,\n\nAppendix).\n\ntext reflects information available as of July\n\n1, 1994. Certain other portions of the text, however, have been updated. The Introduction discusses significant events that have occurred since the completion of research, the Country Profile includes updated information as available, and the Bib-\n\nxiii\n\nliography\n\nlists\n\nrecently published sources thought to be partic-\n\nularly helpful to the reader.\n\nTable A.
