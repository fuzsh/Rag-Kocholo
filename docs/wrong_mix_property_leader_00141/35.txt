At these meetings, the current and former leaders of Laos stressed that President Phuc's selection of Laos for his first overseas visit in his new position showed that the Vietnamese Party and State, and the President himself have attached special importance to preserving, protecting and nurturing the great friendship, special solidarity, and comprehensive cooperation between the two nations.

Agreeing on orientations for collaboration in the time to come, they highlighted the need to well coordinate with each other in the implementation of high-level agreements, the Agreement on Bilateral Cooperation for 2021-2025, and the Vietnam-Laos Cooperation Strategy for 2021-2030.
