        "text": "What is High-Resolution Audio?\n\nHigh-resolution audio offers the highest-fidelity available, far surpassing the sound quality of traditional CDs. When you listen to music on a CD or tracks purchased via consumer services such as iTunes, you are hearing a low-resolution version of what was actually recorded and mastered in the studio. ProStudioMasters offers the original studio masters — exactly as the artist, producers and sound engineers mastered them — for download, directly to you.\n\nWhat do I need for playback?\n\nYou may need additional software / hardware to take full advantage of the higher 24-bit high-res audio formats, but any music lover that has heard 16-bit vs 24-bit will tell you it's worth it!\n\nSoftware for Mac OS X\n\niTunes : plays AIFF, it's free and you probably have it already!\n\nAudirvana : plays both AIFF and FLAC formats, $50 but has a free trial period\n\nSoftware for Windows\n\niTunes : plays AIFF, it's free and you probably have it already!\n\nJRiver : plays both AIFF and FLAC formats, $50 but has a free trial period\n\nHardware Suggestions"
