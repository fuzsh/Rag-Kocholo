        "text": "Lil Durk's career trajectory has been fascinating to watch. One of the most talented artists to emerge out of Chicago drill, Durk scored a few minor hits before his career languished in major label limbo for a few years. That never stopped him from releasing quality music, however, and after his career exploded with the mixtape Just Cause Yall Waited 2 and \"Laugh Now, Cry Later\" with Drake, he kept that same foundation. His 2022 album 7220 was announced in January with his upcoming tour dates, and on Monday Durk shared the project's release date: February 22.\n\n\"My album drop 2/22/22 same day as @kanyewest\" Durk wrote in an Instagram post revealing the release date. His caption references West's upcoming project Donda 2, executive produced by Future. While in all likelihood it will likely just be Durk's project dropping that day – Kanye is not exactly known for keeping his promised album release dates – it's still going to be a big day for Chicago rap."
