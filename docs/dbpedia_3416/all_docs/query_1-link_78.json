        "text": "Drake brings back the trumpets, dropping new single ‘Laugh Now, Cry Later’ feat. Lil Durk. The single foreshadows rap genius’ upcoming album ‘CERTIFIED LOVER BOY’ anticipated to arrive this Summer, with no further confirmed updates. Following the release of ‘Dark Lane Demo Tapes,’ Drake is bringing something special to the table with special guest appearances from some of the most prominent world star athletes including Kevin Durant, Odeelle Beckham Jr, Marshawn Lynch and a Lebron James shoutout.\n\nDirected by Dave Meyers and produced by Freenjoy, Nike recognized Drake’s right of admittance to one of the most highly guarded World Headquarters in the World. The music video took place at the Nike Headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, exhibiting the artist squandering money on the brand, pulling up in a futuristic Benz, challenging Kevin Durant to one-on-one basketball, catching passes from Odell Beckham JR. and taking a fall blameworthy of Marshawn Lynch. Drake also gets reprimanded for shedding tears, emphasizing the title of his upcoming album ‘CERTIFIED LOVER BOY.’ This is the legend’s first collaboration with Lil Durk, alongside these select Allstar athletes.\n\nStacked with cameos from all over the sports world, Drake has grasped the attention within a new market, generating hype for not only new rap music but for the NBA Playoffs, beginning just around the corner. This unprecedented collaboration has given music and sports fans something to look forward to in the near future.\n\nMusic industry professionals are predicting a favorable outcome for not only this single, but for Drake’s upcoming album, as there has been a recent triumph with a handful of tracks, including features on Headie One ‘Only You Freestyle,’ Popcaan ‘ALL I NEED,’ and ‘TWIST & TURN’ and DJ Khaled ‘GREECE’ and ‘POPSTAR,’ all released earlier this year. Listen now, for a sneak peek at OVO’s highly anticipated upcoming sixth studio album."
