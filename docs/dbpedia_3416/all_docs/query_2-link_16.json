        "text": "After a stack of features and a mixtape, Drake is keeping his momentum in 2020 strong with the release of his new single ‘Laugh Now Cry Later’ featuring Lil Durk.\n\nAlong with the song, Drake has also released the music video for the song, directed by Dave Meyers. The video, which features stacks of Nike product placement, features numerous athletes, like Kevin Durant, Marshawn Lynch and Odell Beckham Jr.\n\nThis marks Drake’s first major single since ‘Toosie Slide’ in April, which came with a music video ready for TikTok filmed inside of his home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe single ended up featuring on his 2020 mixtape, ‘Dark Lane Demo Tapes’, along with follow-up single ‘Chicago Freestyle’ with Giveon.\n\nEarlier this week, it was rumoured that Drake would be teaming up with Bruno Mars on a new single via a report from OnSMASH.\n\n‘Laugh Now Cry Later’ is the lead single from Drake’s forthcoming sixth studio album, titled ‘CERTIFIED LOVER BOY’, as he revealed on Instagram.\n\nRecommended\n\nLate last month, an engineer working on the follow-up to 2018’s ‘Scorpion’ said that the new album was just about finished. Noel Cadastre at the time said it was 90% complete but “y’all gonna have to wait on that last 10%”."
