        "text": "Drake has released his latest song “Laugh Now Cry Later,” featuring Lil Durk. The new track arrives with a music video directed by Dave Meyers and shot at the Nike World Headquarters.\n\nTheir visit looked like every sports fan’s dream, with the rappers having run-ins with world class athletes like Kevin Durant, Odell Beckham Jr., and Marshawn Lynch. But from that list, trying the OBJ catch seems a lot more fun than getting rocked by Beast Mode.\n\nMy favorite part is without a doubt the photoshoot with the oversized suits from the early 2000s. They don’t look good, but nostalgia is dope. Watch the video above.\n\nThe track will appear on Drake’s next album, which he revealed will be called Certified Lover Boy."
