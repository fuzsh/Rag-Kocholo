        "text": "\"Laugh Now Cry Later\" is a song by Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, actor and entrepreneur Drake, featuring vocals from American rapper, singer and songwriter Lil Durk. It was released as the lead single from Drake's sixth studio album Certified Lover Boy through Republic Records and OVO Sound on August 14th, 2020.\n\nLyrics\n\n[Intro: Drake]\n\nWoah, woah\n\nYeah\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\n\nSometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby\n\nI took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby\n\nWe took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby\n\nWhere do these n*ggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\n\nTired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react\n\nBeen wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at\n\nPlease don't play that n*gga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that\n\nAnytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy\n\nShawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap\n\nDistance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy\n\nI've seen some n*ggas attack and don't end up makin' it back\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\n\nI know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad\n\nWhat they had didn't last, damn, baby\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\n\nSometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby\n\nI took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby\n\nWe took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby\n\nWhere do these n*ggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]\n\nI'm in the trenches, relax\n\nCan you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats\n\nWe in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best\n\nPoint at the n*gga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net\n\nI'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched\n\nOoh-oh\n\nBring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs\n\nEven though I got a case, I'ma do what it take\n\nAnd I never been embraced\n\nAnd the money's hard to make\n\nSo I bet they on they face right now\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\n\nI know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad\n\nWhat they had didn't last, damn, baby\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\n\nSometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby\n\nI took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby\n\nWe took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby\n\nWhere do these n*ggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\n\nWhen he tell the story, that's not how it went\n\nKnow they be lyin', a hundred percent\n\nMoved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'\n\nValet just called me to tell me come get it\n\nKnocked that boy off and I don't want no credit\n\nIf it was me, they wouldn't regret it\n\nLeft me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah\n\nHeart is still beatin', my n*ggas still eatin'\n\nBackyard, it look like the Garden of Eden\n\nPillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea\n\nAnd then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it\n\nIt's hard to believe it\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\n\nI know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad\n\nWhat they had didn't last, damn, baby\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\n\nSometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby\n\nI took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby\n\nWe took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby\n\nWhere do these n*ggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?\n\nWhy It Rocks\n\nDrake has an emotional presence in the song and uses a lot of energy despite a grating and raspy voice similar to \"God's Plan\". Drake also adds a lot of heartfelt bars in every line.\n\nLil Durk does well on his verse and it is fun, slightly minimalistic, and catchy despite ruining the lyrical substance of the song.\n\nThe music video is well shot and lots of special effects are implemented into it.\n\nThe beat is good as there is well done loops and nostalgic tubas in the instrumental. The bass 808's are also well mastered and isn't to quiet.\n\nBad Qualities"
