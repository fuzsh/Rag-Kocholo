        "text": "Let’s be frank: Drake is the modern reigning king of chart hits. Whether it’s scoring a No. 1 record on the albums chart, which he has done 9 times, or soaring to the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100, most recently with the TikTok sensation “Toosie Slide,” the Toronto native proves even his minimal efforts turn to chart gold.\n\nThe 6 God most recently released “Laugh Now Cry Later” featuring Lil Durk. The single went on to debut at No. 2 on the Hot 100 behind Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP,” yet it superiorly reigned on the Streaming Songs chart.\n\nOne may wonder why this chart has any sort of significance in the scope of the music industry considering streaming figures only account for a certain fraction of the total computation f0r gaining a No. 1 spot of the Hot 100. But, in a world of many streaming platforms, streaming numbers are important in revealing listener trends and how people consume music.\n\nThe “God’s Plan” rapper received 69.8 million U.S. streams with “Laugh Now Cry Later” while Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP” garnered 72.2 million streams, yet Drake and Lil Durk came out on top of the Streaming Songs chart. The reason Drizzy managed to accomplish such a feat had many factors: paid subscription, ad-support and programmed streams. They are weighed differently to account for his top spot on the listing.\n\nThis is Drake’s second-best first-week streaming total after his music video sensation, “God’s Plan,” which gathered 82.4 million streams.\n\nIn regards to streaming, Drake is a powerhouse. He will always dominate and will continue to dominate with future music, attesting to the success he has paved the way for himself.\n\nThe hip-hop artist is the only artist to have the most No. 1s on the Streaming Songs chart, ringing in his ninth No. 1 on the listing and having more No. 1 streaming songs than Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Taylor Swift.\n\nWhile “WAP” has gained great traction and respect in the dominant spot, the music cycle in quarantine has moved quickly. It’s only a matter of time before Drake takes the top spot and continues to prove his prominence in not only hip-hop, but in pop music as a whole. He’s well on his way to gathering enough traction for his subsequent album and scoring a No. 1 hit on the way."
