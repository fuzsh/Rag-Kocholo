        "text": "Fans have been patiently waiting for the release of Wiz Khalifa’s Rolling Papers 2 album for a couple years now. In fact, the T.G.O.D. boss first announced the sequel back in May of 2015, but we’re still without the album two years later. A couple weeks ago, Wiz informed us that the album was indeed finally done, but before we’re treated to it he’s going to release a new mixtape first on November 10th called Laugh Now, Fly Later, which appears to be an ode to Ice Cube’s 2006's Laugh Now, Cry Later album, and alas here it is.\n\nLaced with 10 tracks in total, the prelude to his upcoming Rolling Papers 2 album features a lone appearance from Casey Veggies, who appears on the intro “Royal Highness.” Meanwhile production is handled by the likes of 808 Mafia, Sledgren, RMB Justize, and more.\n\nIn a recently released episode of his DayToday vlog series, Wiz previewed his creative process going into the project saying, “It will be so sick though, because that’s what the people want. They want that good music. They don’t care about nothing else.”\n\nLaugh Now Fly Later serves as the 3rd “project” from Wiz in 2017, following up Pre-Rolleds & Bong Rips EP in June. In addition to that, he also released a radio-friendly single called “Something New” with Ty Dolla $ign back in August, before teaming up with PartyNextDoor for a song called “Rain” in September.\n\nLed by the previously heard single “Letterman,” fans can now stream the new mixtape from Wiz a few hours early thanks to his Soundcloud page. Suggest you roll up and enjoy the new vibes from the Taylor Gang General, and let us know what you think! (Look for the tape to be on Apple Music & Spotify at midnight)\n\nWiz Khalifa"
