        "text": "Drizzy has been insanely active this year, whenever he is making a strong effort to stay in the conversation all signs point to an album of historic proportions is in the works. After delivering some of his most sought after loosies on Dark Lane Demos earlier this year, many would say that release of leaks from the past few years would be enough to keep his rabid fanbase happy. It wasn’t so he followed up that with two singles alongside DJ Khaled, some would say “Greece” is an early contender for song of the summer but he couldn’t stop there. We should know by now that The Boy never stops working, the compilation and the summer singles were simply just an appetizer for his upcoming 6th Studio Album Certified Lover Boy. There’s a reason why Drake is the biggest artist of our generation when he wants to announce a record he knows how to do it with a splash.\n\nTeaming up with one of Chicago’s finest Lil Durk, Drake dropped “Laugh Now Cry Later” today which is the lead single to his upcoming album. People had suspected he was gearing up to drop something before the summer closed out, but this anthemic new track was the perfect one to lead off what is sure to be his biggest album rollout yet. Giving the nod by featuring one of the hardest working and most real rappers in the game Lil Durk for this single is an incredible sign that Durkio may soon be getting all the shine he deserves. Toronto and Chicago are two cities that we don’t see collaborating frequently but hopefully this opens the door to more from the two cities with their own very distinct sound.\n\nDrake has always been known to have videos that spark conversation online and grab the attention of the masses, the Dave Meyer-directed visuals that accompany this single might be the best one in his catalog to date. Filmed at the Nike Headquarters, a star-studded cast including Kevin Durant, OBJ, Marshawn Lynch, Druski, and others clown around with Drake in an array of scenes that all show off his personality while giving a glimpse into what we can expect on this album. The scenes with Drake and Durk recreating iconic Draft Day fits are great as they show how the two came into the game around the same time and their careers have been running parallel so a collaboration from the pair was long overdue."
