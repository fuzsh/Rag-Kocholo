        "text": "Anything Drake touches ultimately turns to gold — or in this case, platinum.\n\nOn Thursday (September 3), Chart Data tweeted the Toronto super rapper’s most recent single “Laugh Now Cry Later” featuring Lil Durk was officially certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), meaning it’s already moved over 1 million units in the three weeks since its release.\n\nThe collaborative single arrived on August 13 along with a Nike-flavored visual. Produced by Cardo, G. Ry and Yung Exclusive, the track arrived a month after Drake and DJ Khaled unleashed “Greece” and “Popstar,” which helped him secure the record for most Top 10 songs in Billboard Hot 100 history.\n\n“Laugh Now Cry Later” serves as the inaugural single from Drake’s upcoming sixth studio album Certified Lover Boy, the follow-up to 2018’s double album Scorpion.\n\nCheck out the visual below."
