        "text": "…Baby.\n\nLast week, the world was given a brief reprieve from the murder hornet-infested dumpster fire that is 2020, when Drake and Lil Durk released “Laugh Now, Cry Later” and its accompanying s̶p̶o̶n̶s̶o̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶t̶e̶n̶t̶ music video.\n\nAt first blush, the song and visuals seemed on par with recent Drake single efforts. Minimalist-leaning production, melodic-leaning vocals, and the typical excess you come to expect from a man whose COVID-friendly music video for Toosie Slide was a casual tour of his $100 million Toronto mansion.\n\nBut then, at precisely the 0:19 mark, Drake pulled his concept Maybach to a stop and looked back to the camera with a face that only Drake can make when he knows everything’s about to change—and everything changed.\n\n“…Baby.”\n\nOver the next 4.5 minutes, neither Odell Beckham Jr. nor Kevin Durant nor Lil Durk on a jet ski (with all due respect to Lil Durk on a jet ski) could outshine that single word. And while pop music has seen its fair share of “baby,” from Britney to Bieber to The Ronettes, this was undeniably a paradigm shift in “baby” culture.\n\nBut which “baby” was the best “baby”? Here are all twelve, ranked in ascending order."
