        "text": "Drake returns with a brand new, Lil Durk assisted 'Laugh Now Cry Later', along with a star-studded video featuring the likes of Kevin Durant, Odell Beckham Jr. and Marshawn Lynch.\n\nThe song, co-produced by G. Ry and CardoGotWings (who previously collaborated with Drake on his smash hit 'God's Plan'), is a feel good, triumphant anthem that wouldn't feel out of place at an Olympic Gold medal ceremony. The song's title, 'Laugh Now Cry Later', has a deep-rooted history in hip-hop; Tupac famously had a tattoo depicting the phrase, whereas Ice Cube used it for the title of his 7th solo album in 2006.\n\nChicago's own Lil Durk features in both the song and video, with a catchy verse sandwiched between two Drake verses. This is a big look for Durk, who already has a loyal core fan-base across the globe, but a feature with arguably the biggest artist in the world is sure to boost his profile to another level.\n\nBut the star of the show is undoubtedly Drake; shining on a hook that most definitely would've been screamed at the top of club-goers lungs from here to Toronto. Drake engages in some light bragging and shot-taking at his countless rivals and will no doubt have you singing 'baby!' out loud at random moments for the next 2 weeks. This song seems set to be another smash and a feel-good track of this magnitude is a perfect escape from what the world is going through in 2020.\n\nAnd if the song doesn't make you feel good enough, surely the video will. Filmed at the Nike Headquarters in Oregan, that we can only assume Drake must have a key to, the Toronto rapper light-heartedly reenacts numerous historic moments from sport history with the help of some high-profile cameos. Internet comedian Druski2Funny also features, with a hilarious skit one-on-one with Drake.\n\nDrake also took to Instagram to announce the song will be the first single from his sixth studio album, titled 'Certified Lover Boy'. Drake had teased the song title on 'When to Say When' earlier this year, as well as wearing 'CLB' merch in the 'Only You Freestyle' video with Headie One. The album is slated for a summer release date and is rumoured to be accompanied with an official OVO x Nike release."
