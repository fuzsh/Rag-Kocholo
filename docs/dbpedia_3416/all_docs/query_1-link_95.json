        "text": "Drizzy also confirmed the title of his new album, Certified Lover Boy.\n\nDrake has dropped new visuals for his song 'Laugh Now, Cry Later'; if you could describe it in a word: money.\n\nCollaborating with Lil Durk on the track, Drake takes things to the Nike World Headquarters in Oregon, where the camera follows him around playing sports, dropping serious cash on Nike apparel and as per usual, getting in his feelings.\n\nDespite the music video looking like a shiny Nike ad, it isn't without a lash of self-deprecating humour as well.\n\nFeaturing cameos from sports stars including Kevin Durant, Odell Beckham Jr. and Marshawn Lynch, it's a fun one for fans who are awaiting Drake's new album, confirmed to be called Certified Lover Boy."
