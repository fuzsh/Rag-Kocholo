Drake and Lil Durk have gifted us with a brand-new single titled “Laugh Now Cry Later” and its accompanying visuals.

Taken from Drake’s forthcoming album, “Laugh Now Cry Later” sees Drake and Lil Durk exchange melodies to flex with some self-assured lyrics over the head-bopping production.

We can always rely on Drizzy to provide us with a strong set of visuals and he does once again in the “Laugh Now Cry Later” video where we see him in the Nike World HQ, taking part in some intense training with the likes of Kevin Durant and Odell Beckham Jr.

“Laugh Now Cry Later” will feature on Drake’s upcoming album, Certified Lover Boy, which is still awaiting an official release date.

Catch the video for “Laugh Now Cry Later” above.
