        "text": "Christening Record – Manuel de Souza LIMA\n\nTo start the great genealogy reset I selected my mother’s line for a few reasons:\n\nI had yet to really do any work with it so there wasn’t much to “redo”\n\nIt is centered in Paraiba, Brazil and as far as I know stayed there for the foreseeable past so the record search will be localized to one area and language.\n\nI expect all my “from home” or family history library research options will be exhausted quickly and I’ll be “finished” with this line fairly soon.\n\nI want this to be a real test of my newly established research practices and organization so this line should be perfect for that! I’ll be starting with Manoel, my mother’s grandfather since I have some information already from her since she met him and knew some details. Also, he is far enough back in time that the records are more readily available.\n\nFirst up, the christening record for Manoel de Souza LIMA. This was actually the very first record I ever found (years ago!) using microfilm at the Family History Library in SLC. It was so exciting! Now, all these images are digitized which makes searching much easier!\n\nTranscription:\n\nManoel, branco, filho legitimo de Ildefonso de Souza Lima, a-\n\ngricultor e Maria da Conceição de Jesus, sem officio, moradores\n\nna Malta Fresca, Frequizia de Nossa Senhora da Piedade de Ca-\n\njazeiras, naseido a vinte e dous de Dezembro de mil oito centos\n\noitena e quatro e baptizado solemimente por mim na Ma-\n\ntriz no dia vinte e trez de dito mez e anno, sendo padrinhos\n\nTenente Acario de Souza Rolim e sua mulher Antonia O-\n\nlindina do Conto Rolim; do que para constar mandou fa-\n\nzer este termo, em que se assigna {signature}.\n\nTranslation:\n\nManoel, white, legitimate son of Ildefonso de Souza Lima,\n\nfarmer, and Maria da Conceição de Jesus, not employed, residents\n\nof the Malta Fresca, Parish of Nossa Senhora da Piedade of\n\nCajazeiras, born on the twenty second of December of eighteen hundred\n\neighty four and solemnly baptized by me in the\n\nchapel on the twenty third day of the same month and year, as godparents\n\nLieutenant Acario de Souza Rolim and his wife Antonia\n\nOlindina do Conto Rolim; for the record I ordered this record\n\nmade, and to attest, I sign {signature}.\n\nNotes\n\nHere are all the “facts” I was able to draw from this document and add to my new clean database:\n\nManoel is the son of Ildefonso de Souza LIMA and Maria da Conceição DE JESUS. He is male and was named Manoel.\n\nHis birth date is 22 Dec 1884 in Cajazieras, Brazil.\n\nIldefonso is a farmer.\n\nManoel was “legitimate” meaning his parents were married prior to his birth. So I should be able to find a marriage record for them prior to 22 Dec 1884.\n\nManoel was christened in the Nossa Senhora da Piedade church in Cajazeiras, Brazil on 23 Dec 1884.\n\nHis godparents were Lieutenant Acario de Souza ROLIM and his wife Antonia Olindina doe Conto ROLIM who were likely friends with Manoel’s parents.\n\nThat is quite a bit of information from just this one record. From here I can keep going with Manoel’s parents and try to find a marriage record or keep looking in the birth records for any other siblings. Luckily his father’s name, Ildefonso, is quite unique to the area (although I have come across another man with that same first name in the records) so it should be relatively easy to find siblings and the marriage record.\n\nHis mother’s name, Maria, is much more common and I’ve even come across another Maria da Conceição but she didn’t have the “de Jesus” part so I’m pretty sure she’s a different woman.\n\nThe fun continues!\n\nA Genealogy Reset\n\nWell, it’s been a while, hasn’t it?\n\nI’m finally ready to make an effort with my genealogy research. I think for a while there I was just all over the place and that kind of overwhelmed me. So now, I’m making a plan!\n\nThe first thing I did was read through Thomas MacEntee’s “The Genealogy Do-Over Workbook.” He gives a lot of great suggestions about just letting go of previous research and starting over with best practices. While I’m not going to completely abandon the work I’ve already done, I am setting it aside for now and starting with clear research goals and procedures in mind.\n\nI’ve also been looking at Mark Tucker’s Genealogy Research Process to firm up how exactly I want to organize the process of research.\n\nCurrent Research Binder\n\nHere’s what I’ve come up with for keeping track of my current research…basically its just a binder with a bit of organization. I’ve made a binder for my mother’s side of the tree and my father’s side of the tree. This is my mother’s side binder:\n\nThe first page is a pedigree chart where I’ve added numbers for each family group. As you can see, I don’t have a lot of information for this side of the family as research in Brazil is difficult! Each number (1-16) has it’s own divider where I’ll place all the notes associated with the research for that family group. I also have a spiral notebook for random notes as I do the research.\n\nHere’s what is behind tab #4 – The Joaquim Pedro DA SILVA family. The family group sheet comes first and I printed it out with all the information I have in my RootsMagic database. I’m sure that not all of this is correct, thus the reset. The plan is to go through and verify or reject all the “facts” and add as much information to each family group before moving backward in time.\n\nEach family group “starts” at the date of marriage for the parents, so in this case 15 Sep 1948 OR 8 Jun 1932 (looks like I’ll need to do some research here!). So any birth information or other “facts” for the parents from prior to their marriage would go into the tab for their parents’ family. All the kids information would remain here until they are married – then they’d get their own tab.\n\nThis binder is just for the direct line research. So for example, I am descended through their eldest daughter Lindalva, who along with her husband are tab #2. I haven’t quite decided how I’ll handle information organization for the other siblings post marriage (maybe another binder?).\n\nEven More Data\n\nThe next item in each family tab is the research log. This will list all of the research I’ve done, date, location, and result. Hopefully this will help me keep track of everything and not redo unnecessary work or waste time figuring out what to do next. Right now I have a general log for the whole family but I may divide this up by “fact.”\n\nFinally, I’ll include any notes at the end. Here’s a table listing all the possible birth dates/locations for my Grandmother, the records where I may find the entries and the results of my search.\n\nThen What?\n\nEventually, I hope that all of this information will be synthesized and added to my database. The idea is that these are the rough drafts and when I’ve “verified” a “fact” it can be added to the database. I’d also like to include all “negative” facts that I’ve disproved and research notes so I’ll have to look into that and make some plans.\n\nThoughts or suggestions on streamlining the process? I’m going to try it for a while and see how it goes."
