Francisca Infante de Portugal ponderando as circunstancias do dia, em que faleceo, e se sepultou, and Luctuosos ays do pranto mais enternecido na sentida morte da Serenissima Senhora D.

Overall good to very good condition. 11 pp. *** FIRST and ONLY EDITION of this poem celebrating the good government of João de Almada e Melo, who was responsible for the late-eighteenth-century renovation of the area in Porto known as Baixa do Porto. Almada, born in Troviscoso, Monção, in 1703, followed his father's footsteps to a military career at age 15, and by 1745 was a colonel in charge of the regiment at Cascais. When the earthquake struck Lisbon in 1755, his regiment was called in to replace D. José I's bodyguards. Family ties with Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo helped him earn the trust of the future Marquês de Pombal, so that in February 1757, Almada e Melo was named governador de armas do Porto and dispatched to stifle an uprising in Porto against the new Companhia Geral da Agricultura das Vinhas do Alto Douro.Almada e Melo rapidly brought the situation in Porto under control, and then remained in Porto the rest of his life. In 1761, he began overseeing the renovation of the part of Porto outside the medieval walls. D. José created the Junta das Obras Publicas in 1762, applying to Porto the same means that were being employed to rebuild Lisbon. This major effort of urban planning and renovation was funded by a tax on wine. Public buildings constructed under Almada e Melo's tenure include the Hospital de Santo António, the Casa da Feitoria Inglesa, and the Real Academia da Marinha e do Comércio (today the Reitoria da Universidade do Porto). In 1764, the year before this poem appeared, Almada e Melo was named governador da Justiça e Relação do Porto.Almada e Melo died in 1786, and is buried in Monção. The Rua do Almada in Porto is named after him, as is a prestigious prize awarded every two years for the best rehabilitation of a historic building in Porto. *** Not located in Innocêncio.

(3 ll.), 519 pp. *** This tenth edition is the first to contain the substantial contribution of Olivo Bilac, covering 1823 to 1905. The ninth edition (190-?) contained only 397 pages.The work was begun by Joaquim Manoel de Macedo (1820-1882), a native of Itaboraí, Rio de Janeiro, who is usually considered the first Brazilian novelist. His A Moreninha, published in 1844, was a tremendous popular success and is still read today. Macedo had tremendous influence as a novelist, was an important force in Brazilian theater, and was one of the most prolific authors Brazil has ever produced. He taught history and geography at the Colégio Pedro II, and was tutor of Princess Isabel's children.When he died he had completed this work only up to 1823. The editor asked Olavo Bilac, already a famous writer, to complete the Lições. Bilac wrote the sections covering 1823 to 1905 (pp. 345-513), attempting to match Macedo's tone. Bilac (1865-1918), a native of Rio de Janeiro, began but did not complete courses in medicine and law; instead he decided to devote himself to literature, and from his home in Rio de Janeiro began contributing extensively to periodicals. His first poems appeared in the Gazeta acadêmica in 1883. Major works following the appearance of Poesias in 1888 include Crônicas e novelas (1894), Sagres (1898), an expanded edition of Poesias (1902), and Tarde, published posthumously in 1919. In the last years of his life Bilac lectured throughout Brazil on national defense, specifically advocating compulsory military service. He was a charter member of the Academia Brasileira de Letras.Bilac, Raimundo Correia, Alberto de Oliveira, and Vicente de Carvalho were the four major poets of the Brazilian Parnassian school, which reacted against the excesses of Romanticism beginning in the 1870s. Of these four, the critics preferred Correia, but the public favored Bilac, and he was often referred to as the \"Prince of Brazilian poets.\" In the years immediately following his death, before Modernism took hold, Bilac was the most widely read and imitated Brazilian poet.*** Jisc locates the present edition at the National Library of Scotland only, and a later edition at Oxford University.

Report of the evidence against several men accused of participating in the May 18, 1828 liberal rebellion in Porto against the absolutist regime of D. Miguel I; some were sentenced to lifelong exile, others to the galleys, yet others were executed. The execution of 12 opponents to Dom Miguel was performed in two distinct moments. The first one took place on May 7th, 1829. Among the condemned were the following names: Bernardo Francisco Pinheiro, Clemente da Silva Melo Soares e Freitas, Francisco Manuel Gravito da Veiga Lima, Francisco Silvério de Carvalho, Joaquim Manuel da Fonseca Lobo, José António de Oliveira da Silva Barros, José Maria Martiniano da Fonseca, Manuel Luís Nogueira, Vitorino Teles de Medeiros, António Bernardo de Brito e Cunha. The second execution moment took place on October 9, 1829, involving the following prisoners: Clemente de Morais Sarmento and João Ferreira da Silva Júnior. The main document, beginning under the heading \"Acordão\" in the lower quarter of the initial page and continuing to p. 39, is dated in print 9 April 1829. Three additional brief documents, the first occupying the bottom of p. 39, the other two on p. 40, are dated in print 6 May. 1829, 6 May 1829, and 11 May, 1829, respectively.

It is usually encountered bound with the three works which follow. That they belong together is demonstrated in the licenses and censura statements (including a Censura \"Do Ordinario\" by Diogo Barbosa Machado). The final leaf contains on its recto additional licenses, one of which is signed by a Craesbeck, and a few lines of errata; the verso is blank. There appear to be copies which contain an extra collective title page at the beginning, Obras em verso.Francisco de Pina e Mello (1695-1773), who rarely used the \"de Sá\" part of his name which appears on the title pages of the present four volumes, was born and died at Montemor-o-Velho. Coming from a family of the lower nobility, he studied at Coimbra but never took a degree, reading what interested him, being particularly influenced by the Baroque. A trip to France in 1753 put him in contact with pre-romantic French authors. He ran afoul of the Marquês de Pombal, was imprisoned, and spent his final years engrossed in literary theory. A member of the Real Academia de História, the Academia dos Aplicados, and the Academia dos Ocultos, he was something of a contradiction as a poet: bucolic and very much influenced by Gongorism, condemned by the árchadas (Correa Garção and Cruz e Silva considered him to be marginal, \"o corvo do Mondego\"), but finally defending Neoclassicism. In short, he is representative of the contradictions of the confused pre-romantic aesthetics of the period in a synthesis of Gongorism with French Neoclassicism.

Francisco António da Silva Oeirense (1797?-1870?), influential liberal, painter, engraver, (lithographer?), designer, and dealer in paintings and engravings, was responsible for much of the effort that went into this project. He conceived and directed the series, produced the original (apparently) watercolor portraits from life of all 33 subjects, engraved some of them himself, and supervised the engraving of others. In addition to Silva Oeirense, engravers were Domingos José da Silva, José Vicente de Sales, Joaquim Pedro, Mariano Gonçalves de Araujo, Constantino de Fontes, and A.J. Quinto. Published in 1822, complete collections were preceded by an engraved dedication-title, Ao Muito Excelso, Magnanimo e constante Primeiro Rei Constitucional, o Senhor D. João Sexcto . According to Innocêncio, complete collections were sold at the time for 24$000 reis, then a huge sum. This prospectus sets the price to subscribers to the entire collection at 19$200. The portraits depicted: 1. Manuel Fernandes Tomás; 2. José Ferreira Borges; 3. José da Silva Carvalho; 4. João Ferreira Viana; 5. Duarte Lessa; 6. José Maria Lopes Carneiro; 7.

Ernesto Soares calls Silva Oeirense a \"figura de extraordinário relêvo dentro da arte portuguesa .\" but whose work as engraver and designer was \"de muito reduzido valor\". He had an important role in the establishment of the Oficina Regia Litografica, and was a founder of the Academia das Belas Artes de Lisboa, being most active in that institution during its early years. From 1838 until at least 1842 he presided over the chair for Historical Engraving at the Academia Portuense de Belas Artes.*** We have not been able to find any reference to this prospectus.

Edited by Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcelos and published by Luís da Câmara Reis, it included contributions by some of the most important intellectuals of the time, ranging from monarchists, to republicans of the \"Grupo da Biblioteca,\" to the social democratic thinker António Sérgio. Some of the most significant collaborators were Afonso Lopes Vieira, Agostinho de Campos, António Sardinha, Sérgio, Carlos Malheiro Dias, and José Leite de Vasconcelos. Included were articles on history, archeology, painting, music, literary history and criticism, philology, etc. The double issue 5/6 is devoted to Luís de Camões, including an interesting previously unpublished letter by the poet with commentary by José Maria Rodrigues, followed by texts by the editor, Afrânio Peixoto, Joaquim de Carvalho, António Baião, Luciano Pereira da Silva, and others. The final issue is devoted to the memory of Carolina Michaëlis de Vasconcelos, including a bibliography of her writings, with texts by J. Leite de Vasconcelos, José Maria Rodrigues, José de Figueiredo, Afonso Lopes Vieira, Reynaldo dos Santos, and Edgar Prestage on Sir Richard Burton. The second issue reproduces a previously unpublished design by Rembrandt. There are two articles by Jaime de Magalhães Lima on Eça de Queiroz (issues 3 and 8), one by Ricardo Jorge on Renaissance medicine (issue 2), a letter and interview with Wenceslau de Moraes (issues 3 and 4), Joaquim de Vasconcelos on Dürer's portrait of Damião de Goes (issue 2), Pedro de Azevedo on a letter from the Viceroy of India to the Emperor of Japan (issue 9), and much more.The bindery \"A Carmelita\" was founded in 1926 by Frederico d'Almeida, probably the best Portuguese bookbinder of the twentieth century. He worked there until 1940 before moving to Rua António Maria Cardoso, 31, ao Chiado, where he continued to work under his own name until the 1970s. Among his illustrious clients were the exiled King Umberto II of Italy and the Conde de Barcelona.

Among the subjects of the odes are Vasco da Gama, André Furtado de Mendonça, João Fernandes Vieira, Dom João de Castro, Antonio Moniz Barreto, Duarte Pacheco Pereira, the Count Schaumbourg Lippe, and the Marquês de Pombal (to whom there are no less than four poems, including one on the reforms to Coimbra University). A second edition was published in London, 1820. The Odes also were published as volumes V and VI of the author's Poesias (Lisbon, 1807-17). Cruz e Silva developed a formidable reputation as a lyric poet and satirist. His O Hyssope was a source of inspiration for Francisco de Mello Franco's famous burlesque poem Reino da estupidez. Cruz e Silva based his poem on the quarrel between the bishop of Elvas, D. Lourenço de Lancastre, and the dean, D. José Carlos de Lara, which he witnessed first-hand while resident in Elvas from 1764 to 1774. As Bell recounts the tale, Cruz e Silva \"was summoned to read his satire to the all-powerful [Marques de] Pombal in the presence of the infuriated bishop . the poem proved too much for the gravity of the minister, who appointed him a judge in Rio de Janeiro (1776)\" (Portuguese Literature pp. 273-4). Martins de Carvalho notes (p. 7) that many contemporaries considered O Hyssope \"muito superior\" to Pope's Rape of the Lock.Of humble origins (his father was a carpenter who abandoned the family to emigrate to Brazil, while his mother supported them working as a seamstress), Cruz e Silva (Lisbon 1731-Rio de Janeiro 1799) studied law at Coimbra. He co-founded the Arcadia Ulyssiponense in 1756 and, while serving as a military judge, developed a formidable reputation as a lyric poet and satirist. Most of Cruz e Silva's poems remained unpublished until after his death. In July 1790 Cruz e Silva was sent again to Brazil to assist in trying the leaders of the Republican conspiracy in Minas, in which Tomás António Gonzaga, Claudio Manuel da Costa, Manuel Inácio da Silva Alvarenga and other men of letters were involved, and in December 1792 he became chancellor of the Relação in Rio. Six years later he was named councillor of the Conselho Ultramarino, but did not live to return home.Provenance: Joaquim [Maria] Pessoa (1948-2023), poet, artist, publicist, student of Portuguese pre-history, and book collector, was the author or co-author of many Portuguese television programs, and for six years (1988-1994) was director of the Sociedade Portuguesa de Autores. He also founded the artistic cooperative Toma Lá Disco, with Ary dos Santos, Fernando Tordo, Carlos Mendes, Paulo de Carvalho and Luiz Villas-Boas, among others.
