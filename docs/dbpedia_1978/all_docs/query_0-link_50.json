        "text": "Upper-Bound Estimates Of SEU in CMOS\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nEdmonds, Larry D.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nTheory of single-event upsets (SEU) (changes in logic state caused by energetic charged subatomic particles) in complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) logic devices extended to provide upper-bound estimates of rates of SEU when limited experimental information available and configuration and dimensions of SEU-sensitive regions of devices unknown. Based partly on chord-length-distribution method.\n\nCritical issues regarding SEU in avionics\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNormand, E.; McNulty, P.J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe energetic neutrons in the atmosphere cause microelectronics in avionic system to malfunction through a mechanism called single-event upsets (SEUs), and single-event latchup is a potential threat. Data from military and experimental flights as well as laboratory testing indicate that typical non-radiation-hardened 64K and 256K static random access memories (SRAMs) can experience a significant SEU rate at aircraft altitudes. Microelectronics in avionics systems have been demonstrated to be susceptible to SEU. Of all device types, RAMs are the most sensitive because they have the largest number of bits on a chip (e.g., an SRAM may have from 64K to 1MmoreÂ Â» bits, a microprocessor 3K to 10K bits, and a logic device like an analog-to-digital converter, 12 bits). Avionics designers will need to take this susceptibility into account in current and future designs. A number of techniques are available for dealing with SEU: EDAC, redundancy, use of SEU-hard parts, reset and/or watchdog timer capability, etc. Specifications should be developed to guide avionics vendors in the analysis, prevention, and verification of neutron-induced SEU. Areas for additional research include better definition of the atmospheric neutrons and protons, development of better calculational models (e.g., those used for protons[sup 11]), and better characterization of neutron-induced latchup.Â«Â less\n\nSingle event upset (SEU) testing at JPL\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCoss, James R.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nIt is believed that the increase in SEUs with more modern devices may have serious consequences for future space missions. The physics behind an SEU is discussed as well as SEU test philosophy and equipment, and testing results. It is concluded that the problem may be ameliorated by careful device selection and the use of redundancy or error correction.\n\nSEU induced errors observed in microprocessor systems\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAsenek, V.; Underwood, C.; Oldfield, M.\n\nIn this paper, the authors present software tools for predicting the rate and nature of observable SEU induced errors in microprocessor systems. These tools are built around a commercial microprocessor simulator and are used to analyze real satellite application systems. Results obtained from simulating the nature of SEU induced errors are shown to correlate with ground-based radiation test data.\n\nAn SEU resistant 256K SOI SRAM\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHite, L. R.; Lu, H.; Houston, T. W.; Hurta, D. S.; Bailey, W. E.\n\n1992-12-01\n\nA novel SEU (single event upset) resistant SRAM (static random access memory) cell has been implemented in a 256K SOI (silicon on insulator) SRAM that has attractive performance characteristics over the military temperature range of -55 to +125 C. These include worst-case access time of 40 ns with an active power of only 150 mW at 25 MHz, and a worst-case minimum WRITE pulse width of 20 ns. Measured SEU performance gives an Adams 10 percent worst-case error rate of 3.4 x 10 exp -11 errors/bit-day using the CRUP code with a conservative first-upset LET threshold. Modeling does show that higher bipolar gain than that measured on a sample from the SRAM lot would produce a lower error rate. Measurements show the worst-case supply voltage for SEU to be 5.5 V. Analysis has shown this to be primarily caused by the drain voltage dependence of the beta of the SOI parasitic bipolar transistor. Based on this, SEU experiments with SOI devices should include measurements as a function of supply voltage, rather than the traditional 4.5 V, to determine the worst-case condition.\n\nSEU System Analysis: Not Just the Sum of All Parts\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerg, Melanie D.; Label, Kenneth\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSingle event upset (SEU) analysis of complex systems is challenging. Currently, system SEU analysis is performed by component level partitioning and then either: the most dominant SEU cross-sections (SEUs) are used in system error rate calculations; or the partition SEUs are summed to eventually obtain a system error rate. In many cases, system error rates are overestimated because these methods generally overlook system level derating factors. The problem with overestimating is that it can cause overdesign and consequently negatively affect the following: cost, schedule, functionality, and validation/verification. The scope of this presentation is to discuss the risks involved with our current scheme of SEU analysis for complex systems; and to provide alternative methods for improvement.\n\nSimulation of SRAM SEU Sensitivity at Reduced Operating Temperatures\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSanathanamurthy, S.; Ramachandran, V.; Alles, M. L.; Reed, R. A.; Massengill, L. W.; Raman, A.; Turowski, M.; Mantooth, A.; Woods, B.; Barlow, M.;\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA new NanoTCAD-to-Spectre interface is applied to perform mixed-mode SEU simulations of an SRAM cell. Results using newly calibrated TCAD cold temperature substrate mobility models, and BSIM3 compact models extracted explicitly for the cold temperature designs, indicate a 33% reduction in SEU threshold for the range of temperatures simulated.\n\nRecent Results on SEU Hardening of SiGe HBT Logic Circuits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKrithivasan, Ramkumar; Marshall, Paul W.; Nayeem, Mustayeen; Sutton, Akil K.; Kuo, Wei-Min Lance; Haugerud, Becca M.; Najafizadeh, Laieh; Cressler, John D.; Carts, martin A.; Marshall, Cheryl J.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nA viewgraph presentation on SEU tolerant SiGe HBT technology is shown. The topics include: 1) Introduction; 2) TID and SEU in SiGe Technology; 3) RHBD Techniques; 4) Experiment; 5) Heavy-Ion Data and Analysis; and 6) Summary.\n\nDesign and qualification of the SEU/TD Radiation Monitor chip\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBuehler, Martin G.; Blaes, Brent R.; Soli, George A.; Zamani, Nasser; Hicks, Kenneth A.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThis report describes the design, fabrication, and testing of the Single-Event Upset/Total Dose (SEU/TD) Radiation Monitor chip. The Radiation Monitor is scheduled to fly on the Mid-Course Space Experiment Satellite (MSX). The Radiation Monitor chip consists of a custom-designed 4-bit SRAM for heavy ion detection and three MOSFET's for monitoring total dose. In addition the Radiation Monitor chip was tested along with three diagnostic chips: the processor monitor and the reliability and fault chips. These chips revealed the quality of the CMOS fabrication process. The SEU/TD Radiation Monitor chip had an initial functional yield of 94.6 percent. Forty-three (43) SEU SRAM's and 14 Total Dose MOSFET's passed the hermeticity and final electrical tests and were delivered to LL.\n\nA new method for using Cf-252 in SEU testing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCostantine, A.; Howard, J. W.; Becker, M.; Block, R. C.; Smith, L. S.; Soli, G. A.; Stauber, M. C.\n\n1990-12-01\n\nA system using Cf-252 and associated nuclear instrumentation has determined the single-event upset (SEU) cross section versus linear energy transfer (LET) curve for several 2K x 8 static random access memories (SRAMs). The Cf-252 fission fragments pass through a thin-film organic scintillator detector (TFD) on the way to the device under test (DUT). The TFD provides energy information for each transiting fragment. Data analysis provides the energy of the individual ion responsible for each SEU; thus, separate upset cross sections can be developed for different energy and mass regions of the californium spectrum. This californium-based device is quite small and fits onto a bench top. It provides a convenient and inexpensive supplement or alternative to accelerator and high-altitude/space SEU testing.\n\nA new method for using Cf-252 in SEU testing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCostantine, A.; Howard, J.

However, some of them require a lot of human, material and financial resources. This paper proposes an easy scheme on SEU hardening for Heterogeneous Dual-core SoC (HD SoC) which contains three techniques. First, the automatic Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) technique is adopted to harden the register heaps of the processor and the instruction-fetching module. Second, Hamming codes are used to harden the random access memory (RAM). Last, a software signature technique is applied to check the programs which are running on CPU. The scheme need not to consume additional resources, and has little influence on the performance of CPU. These technologies are very mature, easy to implement and needs low cost. According to the simulation result, the scheme can satisfy the basic demand of SEU-hardening.\n\nCharacterization of System Level Single Event Upset (SEU) Responses using SEU Data, Classical Reliability Models, and Space Environment Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerg, Melanie; Label, Kenneth; Campola, Michael; Xapsos, Michael\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe propose a method for the application of single event upset (SEU) data towards the analysis of complex systems using transformed reliability models (from the time domain to the particle fluence domain) and space environment data.\n\nAnalyzing Test-As-You-Fly Single Event Upset (SEU) Responses using SEU Data, Classical Reliability Models, and Space Environment Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerg, Melanie; Label, Kenneth; Campola, Michael; Xapsos, Michael\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe propose a method for the application of single event upset (SEU) data towards the analysis of complex systems using transformed reliability models (from the time domain to the particle fluence domain) and space environment data.\n\nA SEU-Hard Flip-Flop for Antifuse FPGAs\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKatz, R.; Wang, J. J.; McCollum, J.; Cronquist, B.; Chan, R.; Yu, D.; Kleyner, I.; Day, John H. (Technical Monitor)\n\n2001-01-01\n\nA single event upset (SEU)-hardened flip-flop has been designed and developed for antifuse Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) application. Design and application issues, testability, test methods, simulation, and results are discussed.\n\nVerification of a SEU model for advanced 1-micron CMOS structures using heavy ions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCable, J. S.; Carter, J. R.; Witteles, A. A.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nModeling and test results are reported for 1 micron CMOS circuits. Analytical predictions are correlated with experimental data, and sensitivities to process and design variations are discussed. Unique features involved in predicting the SEU performance of these devices are described. The results show that the critical charge for upset exhibits a strong dependence on pulse width for very fast devices, and upset predictions must factor in the pulse shape. Acceptable SEU error rates can be achieved for a 1 micron bulk CMOS process. A thin retrograde well provides complete SEU immunity for N channel hits at normal incidence angle. Source interconnect resistance can be important parameter in determining upset rates, and Cf-252 testing can be a valuable tool for cost-effective SEU testing.\n\nThe Single Event Upset (SEU) response to 590 MeV protons\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNichols, D. K.; Price, W. E.; Smith, L. S.; Soli, G. A.\n\n1984-01-01\n\nThe presence of high-energy protons in cosmic rays, solar flares, and trapped radiation belts around Jupiter poses a threat to the Galileo project. Results of a test of 10 device types (including 1K RAM, 4-bit microP sequencer, 4-bit slice, 9-bit data register, 4-bit shift register, octal flip-flop, and 4-bit counter) exposed to 590 MeV protons at the Swiss Institute of Nuclear Research are presented to clarify the picture of SEU response to the high-energy proton environment of Jupiter. It is concluded that the data obtained should remove the concern that nuclear reaction products generated by protons external to the device can cause significant alteration in the device SEU response. The data also show only modest increases in SEU cross section as proton energies are increased up to the upper limits of energy for both the terrestrial and Jovian trapped proton belts.\n\nSingle-Event Upset (SEU) model verification and threshold determination using heavy ions in a bipolar static RAM\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZoutendyk, J. A.; Smith, L. S.; Soli, G. A.; Thieberger, P.; Wegner, H. E.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nSingle-Event Upset (SEU) response of a bipolar low-power Schottky-diode-clamped TTL static RAM has been observed using Br ions in the 100-240 MeV energy range and O ions in the 20-100 MeV range. These data complete the experimental verification of circuit-simulation SEU modeling for this device. The threshold for onset of SEU has been observed by the variation of energy, ion species and angle of incidence. The results obtained from the computer circuit-simulation modeling and experimental model verification demonstrate a viable methodology for modeling SEU in bipolar integrated circuits.\n\nCharacterization of System on a Chip (SoC) Single Event Upset (SEU) Responses Using SEU Data, Classical Reliability Models, and Space Environment Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerg, Melanie; Label, Kenneth; Campola, Michael; Xapsos, Michael\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe propose a method for the application of single event upset (SEU) data towards the analysis of complex systems using transformed reliability models (from the time domain to the particle fluence domain) and space environment data.\n\nEmpirical modeling of Single-Event Upset (SEU) in NMOS depletion-mode-load static RAM (SRAM) chips\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZoutendyk, J. A.; Smith, L. S.; Soli, G. A.; Smith, S. L.; Atwood, G. E.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nA detailed experimental investigation of single-event upset (SEU) in static RAM (SRAM) chips fabricated using a family of high-performance NMOS (HMOS) depletion-mode-load process technologies, has been done. Empirical SEU models have been developed with the aid of heavy-ion data obtained with a three-stage tandem van de Graaff accelerator. The results of this work demonstrate a method by which SEU may be empirically modeled in NMOS integrated circuits.\n\nImportance of ion energy on SEU in CMOS SRAMs\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDodd, P.E.; Shaneyfelt, M.R.; Sexton, F.W.\n\n1998-03-01\n\nThe single-event upset (SEU) responses of 16 Kbit to 1 Mbit SRAMs irradiated with low and high-energy heavy ions are reported. Standard low-energy heavy ion tests appear to be sufficiently conservative for technologies down to 0.5 {micro}m.\n\nTest results for SEU and SEL immune memory circuits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWiseman, D.; Canaris, J.; Whitaker, S.; Gambles, J.; Arave, K.; Arave, L.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nTest results for three SEU logic/circuit hardened CMOS memory circuits verify upset and latch-up immunity for two configurations to be in excess of 120 MeV cm(exp 2)/mg using a commercial, non-radiation hardened CMOS process. Test chips from three separate fabrication runs in two different process were evaluated.\n\nSimulation of SEU Cross-sections using MRED under Conditions of Limited Device Information\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLauenstein, J. M.; Reed, R. A.; Weller, R. A.; Mendenhall, M. H.; Warren, K. M.; Pellish, J. A.; Schrimpf, R. D.; Sierawski, B. D.; Massengill, L. W.; Dodd, P. E.;\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThis viewgraph presentation reviews the simulation of Single Event Upset (SEU) cross sections using the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) resistance and electrode diffusion (MRED) tool using \"Best guess\" assumptions about the process and geometry, and direct ionization, low-energy beam test results. This work will also simulate SEU cross-sections including angular and high energy responses and compare the simulated results with beam test data for the validation of the model. Using MRED, we produced a reasonably accurate upset response model of a low-critical charge SRAM without detailed information about the circuit, device geometry, or fabrication process\n\nH3+: superficies de energÃ­a potencial, estados y transiciones rovibracionales\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAguado, M. Paniagua Y. A.\n\nHemos calculado varias superficies globales de energÃ­a potencial para el estado fundamental y excitados del sistema H3+ en mÃ¡s de ocho mil geometrÃ­as diferentes usando una base (9s 3p 1d)/[4s 3p 1d] en cada Ã¡tomo de HidrÃ³geno y mediante un mÃ©todo de cÃ¡lculo de interacciÃ³n de configuraciones completa (FCI). Hemos ajustado las superficies a formas analÃ­ticas del tipo Aguado y Paniagua con un error promedio menor de 50 cm-1 y menor en el pozo de potencial del estado fundamental. Finalmente hemos calculado y analizado los niveles vibracionales para los dos estados electrÃ³nicos mÃ¡s bajos, siendo la desviaciÃ³n respecto de los mejores valores publicados, tanto experimentales como teÃ³ricos, de unos pocos nÃºmeros de onda.\n\nTeorÃ­ÃÂ­as de primer y segundo orden sobre el potencial de ciertas figuras de equilibrio de cuerpos celestes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGumbau, Manuel Forner\n\n2010-11-01\n\nUno de los problemas que aborda la MecÃ¡nica Celeste es la determinaciÃ³n de las figuras de equilibrio de los cuerpos celestes. Para investigar su soluciÃ³n mediante mÃ©todos directos, se precisa evaluar el potencial generado por su autogravitaciÃ³n, el generado por su fuerza centrÃ­ÃÂ­fuga y el generado por la fuerza de atracciÃ³n entre los cuerpos. Los mÃ©todos clÃ¡sicos de Finlay y Kopal que afrontan estos problemas, para determinar el potencial autogravitatorio en las configuraciones de equilibrio, emplean desarrollos en serie de los potenciales interior y exterior del potencial autogravitatorio. Estos mÃ©todos incurren en el error de suponer la convergencia en capas donde resulta cuestionable dicha convergencia para estos desarrollos en serie. En este trabajo se han elaborado unos algoritmos que contemplan toda la casuÃ­&stica y que permiten una manipulaciÃ³n efic iente del producto de polinomios de Legendre, del producto de funciones asociada s de Legendre y del producto de armÃ³nicos esfÃ©ricos como combinaciÃ³on lineal de ellos mismos, respectivamente. Se han obtenido, para primer y segundo orden en las amplitudes, los desarrollos correctos para los potencial es interior y exterior del potencial autogravitatorio para configuraciones de equilibrio aisladas, y , en primer orden de amplitudes, los mismos potenciales para los sistemas binarios prÃ³ximos. Se ha elaborado un mÃ©todo analÃ­tico, en primer orden respecto de las amplitudes, para la determinaciÃ³n del potencial de marea en sistemas binarios prÃ³ximos en el cual se manifiesta la forma de la componente secundaria del sistema\n\n[Keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) simulating multiple cornua cutanea].\n\nPubMed\n\nSchreiber, D; StÃ¼cker, M; Hoffmann, K; Bacharach-Buhles, M; Altmeyer, P\n\n1997-08-01\n\nPatient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris maculosa seu papulosa (Davies-Colley) presented with multiple cutaneous horns. The clinical picture, the histology, the electro microscopic examination, the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses. The patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures.\n\nA method to compute SEU fault probabilities in memory arrays with error correction\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGercek, Gokhan\n\n1994-01-01\n\nWith the increasing packing densities in VLSI technology, Single Event Upsets (SEU) due to cosmic radiations are becoming more of a critical issue in the design of space avionics systems. In this paper, a method is introduced to compute the fault (mishap) probability for a computer memory of size M words. It is assumed that a Hamming code is used for each word to provide single error correction. It is also assumed that every time a memory location is read, single errors are corrected. Memory is read randomly whose distribution is assumed to be known. In such a scenario, a mishap is defined as two SEU's corrupting the same memory location prior to a read. The paper introduces a method to compute the overall mishap probability for the entire memory for a mission duration of T hours.\n\nExperimental evidence for a new single-event upset (SEU) mode in a CMOS SRAM obtained from model verification\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZoutendyk, J. A.; Smith, L. S.; Soli, G. A.; Lo, R. Y.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nModeling of SEU has been done in a CMOS static RAM containing 1-micron-channel-length transistors fabricated from a p-well epilayer process using both circuit-simulation and numerical-simulation techniques. The modeling results have been experimentally verified with the aid of heavy-ion beams obtained from a three-stage tandem van de Graaff accelerator. Experimental evidence for a novel SEU mode in an ON n-channel device is presented.\n\nSEU hardened memory cells for a CCSDS Reed Solomon encoder\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nWhitaker, S.; Canaris, J.; Liu, K.\n\nThis paper reports on design technique to harden CMOS memory circuits against Single Event Upset (SEU) in the space environment. The design technique provides a recovery mechanism which is independent of the shape of the upsetting event. A RAM cell and Flip Flop design are presented to demonstrate the method. The Flip Flop was used in the control circuitry for a Reed Solomon encoder designed for the Space Station and Explorer platforms.\n\nAltitude and latitude variations in avionics SEU and atmospheric neutron flux\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNormand, E.; Baker, T.J.\n\n1993-12-01\n\nThe direct cause of single event upsets in SRAMs at aircraft altitudes by the atmospheric neutrons has previously been documented. The variation of the in-flight SEU rate with latitude is demonstrated by new data over a wide range of geographical locations. New measurements and models of the atmospheric neutron flux are also evaluated to characterize its variation with altitude, latitude and solar activity.\n\nEffects of Temperature and Supply Voltage on SEU- and SET-Induced Errors in Bulk 40-nm Sequential Circuits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, R. M.; Diggins, Z. J.; Mahatme, N. N.; Wang, L.; Zhang, E. X.; Chen, Y. P.; Zhang, H.; Liu, Y. N.; Narasimham, B.; Witulski, A. F.; Bhuva, B. L.; Fleetwood, D. M.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe single-event sensitivity of bulk 40-nm sequential circuits is investigated as a function of temperature and supply voltage. An overall increase in SEU cross section versus temperature is observed at relatively high supply voltages. However, at low supply voltages, there is a threshold temperature beyond which the SEU cross section decreases with further increases in temperature. Single-event transient induced errors in flip-flops also increase versus temperature at relatively high supply voltages and are more sensitive to temperature variation than those caused by single-event upsets.\n\nApplication of SEU imaging for analysis of device architecture using a 25 MeV/u 86Kr ion microbeam at HIRFL\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Tianqi; Yang, Zhenlei; Guo, Jinlong; Du, Guanghua; Tong, Teng; Wang, Xiaohui; Su, Hong; Liu, Wenjing; Liu, Jiande; Wang, Bin; Ye, Bing; Liu, Jie\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe heavy-ion imaging of single event upset (SEU) in a flash-based field programmable gate array (FPGA) device was carried out for the first time at Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). The three shift register chains with separated input and output configurations in device under test (DUT) were used to identify the corresponding logical area rapidly once an upset occurred. The logic units in DUT were partly configured in order to distinguish the registers in SEU images. Based on the above settings, the partial architecture of shift register chains in DUT was imaged by employing the microbeam of 86Kr ion with energy of 25 MeV/u in air. The results showed that the physical distribution of registers in DUT had a high consistency with its logical arrangement by comparing SEU image with logic configuration in scanned area.\n\nGamma irradiation induced method in preparation of Gd2O2S:Eu3+ phosphors: the effect of dose towards luminescent properties\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRahim, S.; Hasim, M. H.; Ayob, M. T. M.; Rahman, I. A.; Radiman, S.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA novel gamma irradiation induced synthesis method of Gd2O2S:Eu3+ phosphors was investigated in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The effect of irradiation doses (50-150kGy) on structural and morphology analysis as well as luminescence properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM) and photoluminescence spectrometer (PL). The results show that gamma radiation is potentially induced formation of Gd2O2S:Eu3+ phosphors from radiation reduction and/or precipitation of insoluble compounds as the hexagonal phase structure was formed without any impurities as proven in XRD pattern. The morphologies were observed that the obtained Gd2O2S:Eu3+ phosphors possess sphere structure with smooth surface at 100 kGy irradiated dose. PL spectroscopy reveals that the strongest red emission peaks is located at 626 nm under 325 nm light excitation, which corresponds to 5D0â7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions. An optimized dose for excellent luminescent was observed at 100 kGy. The results suggested that the Gd2O2S:Eu3+ phosphors may have a beneficial approach in field of imaging device or media.\n\nThe contribution of low-energy protons to the total on-orbit SEU rate\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nDodds, Nathaniel Anson; Martinez, Marino J.; Dodd, Paul E.; ...\n\n2015-11-10\n\nLow- and high-energy proton experimental data and error rate predictions are presented for many bulk Si and SOI circuits from the 20-90 nm technology nodes to quantify how much low-energy protons (LEPs) can contribute to the total on-orbit single-event upset (SEU) rate. Every effort was made to predict LEP error rates that are conservatively high; even secondary protons generated in the spacecraft shielding have been included in the analysis. Across all the environments and circuits investigated, and when operating within 10% of the nominal operating voltage, LEPs were found to increase the total SEU rate to up to 4.3 timesmoreÂ Â» as high as it would have been in the absence of LEPs. Therefore, the best approach to account for LEP effects may be to calculate the total error rate from high-energy protons and heavy ions, and then multiply it by a safety margin of 5. If that error rate can be tolerated then our findings suggest that it is justified to waive LEP tests in certain situations. Trends were observed in the LEP angular responses of the circuits tested. As a result, grazing angles were the worst case for the SOI circuits, whereas the worst-case angle was at or near normal incidence for the bulk circuits.Â«Â less\n\nUsing Pipelined XNOR Logic to Reduce SEU Risks in State Machines\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nLe, Martin; Zheng, Xin; Katanyoutant, Sunant\n\n2008-01-01\n\nSingle-event upsets (SEUs) pose great threats to avionic systems state machine control logic, which are frequently used to control sequence of events and to qualify protocols. The risks of SEUs manifest in two ways: (a) the state machine s state information is changed, causing the state machine to unexpectedly transition to another state; (b) due to the asynchronous nature of SEU, the state machine's state registers become metastable, consequently causing any combinational logic associated with the metastable registers to malfunction temporarily. Effect (a) can be mitigated with methods such as triplemodular redundancy (TMR). However, effect (b) cannot be eliminated and can degrade the effectiveness of any mitigation method of effect (a). Although there is no way to completely eliminate the risk of SEU-induced errors, the risk can be made very small by use of a combination of very fast state-machine logic and error-detection logic. Therefore, one goal of two main elements of the present method is to design the fastest state-machine logic circuitry by basing it on the fastest generic state-machine design, which is that of a one-hot state machine. The other of the two main design elements is to design fast error-detection logic circuitry and to optimize it for implementation in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) architecture: In the resulting design, the one-hot state machine is fitted with a multiple-input XNOR gate for detection of illegal states. The XNOR gate is implemented with lookup tables and with pipelines for high speed. In this method, the task of designing all the logic must be performed manually because no currently available logic synthesis software tool can produce optimal solutions of design problems of this type. However, some assistance is provided by a script, written for this purpose in the Python language (an object-oriented interpretive computer language) to automatically generate hardware description language (HDL) code from state\n\nAn advanced SEU tolerant latch based on error detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Hui; Zhu, Jianwei; Lu, Xiaoping; Li, Jingzhao\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThis paper proposes a latch that can mitigate SEUs via an error detection circuit. The error detection circuit is hardened by a C-element and a stacked PMOS. In the hold state, a particle strikes the latch or the error detection circuit may cause a fault logic state of the circuit. The error detection circuit can detect the upset node in the latch and the fault output will be corrected. The upset node in the error detection circuit can be corrected by the C-element. The power dissipation and propagation delay of the proposed latch are analyzed by HSPICE simulations. The proposed latch consumes about 77.5% less energy and 33.1% less propagation delay than the triple modular redundancy (TMR) latch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed latch can mitigate SEU effectively.

L.; Cucinotta, F. A.; Badhwar, G. D.; ONeill, P. M.; Badavi, F. F.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nRecent improvements in the radiation transport code HZETRN/BRYNTRN and galactic cosmic ray environmental model have provided an opportunity to investigate the effects of target fragmentation on estimates of single event upset (SEU) rates for spacecraft memory devices. Since target fragments are mostly of very low energy, an SEU prediction model has been derived in terms of particle energy rather than linear energy transfer (LET) to account for nonlinear relationship between range and energy. Predictions are made for SEU rates observed on two Shuttle flights, each at low and high inclination orbit. Corrections due to track structure effects are made for both high energy ions with track structure larger than device sensitive volume and for low energy ions with dense track where charge recombination is important. Results indicate contributions from target fragments are relatively important at large shield depths (or any thick structure material) and at low inclination orbit. Consequently, a more consistent set of predictions for upset rates observed in these two flights is reached when compared to an earlier analysis with CREME model. It is also observed that the errors produced by assuming linear relationship in range and energy in the earlier analysis have fortuitously canceled out the errors for not considering target fragmentation and track structure effects.\n\nA comparative investigation of Lu2SiO5:Ce and Gd2O2S:Eu powder scintillators for use in x-ray mammography detectors\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMichail, C. M.; Fountos, G. P.; David, S. L.; Valais, I. G.; Toutountzis, A. E.; Kalyvas, N. E.; Kandarakis, I. S.; Panayiotakis, G. S.\n\n2009-10-01\n\nThe dominant powder scintillator in most medical imaging modalities for decades has been Gd2O2S:Tb due to the very good intrinsic properties and overall efficiency. Apart from Gd2O2S:Tb, there are alternative powder phosphor scintillators such as Lu2SiO5:Ce and Gd2O2S:Eu that have been suggested for use in various medical imaging modalities. Gd2O2S:Eu emits red light and can be combined mainly with digital mammography detectors such as CCDs. Lu2SiO5:Ce emits blue light and can be combined with blue sensitivity films, photocathodes and some photodiodes. For the purposes of the present study, two scintillating screens, one from Lu2SiO5:Ce and the other from Gd2O2S:Eu powders, were prepared using the method of sedimentation. The screen coating thicknesses were 25.0 and 33.1 mg cm-2 respectively. The screens were investigated by evaluating the following parameters: the output signal, the modulation transfer function, the noise equivalent passband, the informational efficiency, the quantum detection efficiency and the zero-frequency detective quantum efficiency. Furthermore, the spectral compatibility of those materials with various optical detectors was determined. Results were compared to published data for the commercially employed 'Kodak Min-R film-screen system', based on a 31.7 mg cm-2 thick Gd2O2S:Tb phosphor. For Gd2O2S:Eu, MTF data were found comparable to those of Gd2O2S:Tb, while the MTF of Lu2SiO5:Ce was even higher resulting in better spatial resolution and image sharpness properties. On the other hand, Gd2O2S:Eu was found to exhibit higher output signal and zero-frequency detective quantum efficiency than Lu2SiO5:Ce.\n\nA New Partial Reconfiguration-Based Fault-Injection System to Evaluate SEU Effects in SRAM-Based FPGAs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSterpone, L.; Violante, M.\n\n2007-08-01\n\nModern SRAM-based field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices offer high capability in implementing complex system. Unfortunately, SRAM-based FPGAs are extremely sensitive to single event upsets (SEUs) induced by radiation particles. In order to successfully deploy safety- or mission-critical applications, designer need to validate the correctness of the obtained designs. In this paper we describe a system based on partial-reconfiguration for running fault-injection experiments within the configuration memory of SRAM-based FPGAs. The proposed fault-injection system uses the internal configuration capabilities that modern FPGAs offer in order to inject SEU within the configuration memory. Detailed experimental results show that the technique is orders of magnitude faster than previously proposed ones.\n\nUsing Classical Reliability Models and Single Event Upset (SEU) Data to Determine Optimum Implementation Schemes for Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) in SRAM-Based Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Devices\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerg, M.; Kim, H.; Phan, A.; Seidleck, C.; LaBel, K.; Pellish, J.; Campola, M.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nSpace applications are complex systems that require intricate trade analyses for optimum implementations.

The sizes of the spheres can be tuned in the range of 65 nm-295 nm by only changing the pH value of the system. It is indicated that the luminescence properties of the spherical phosphors were strongly influenced by size of the spheres. Such a size-sensitive luminescence property was interpreted from the structures of the spheres, including the degree of crystallinity, band gap energy, crystal field symmetry around Eu3+. We expected that this study not only can provide important information for size-controlled synthesis of spherical phosphors, but also can give a reference for exploration of size-dependent luminescence.\n\nFabrication and luminescent properties of La2O2S:Eu3+ translucent ceramic by pressureless reaction sintering\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLian, Jingbao; Wang, Bingxin; Liang, Ping; Liu, Feng; Wang, Xuejiao\n\n2014-04-01\n\nLa2O2S:Eu3+ translucent ceramic (LOS:Eu) was fabricated by pressureless reaction sintering method. It is found that the (La, Eu)2(OH)4SO4á¹¡2H2O precursor is synthesized by co-precipitation using commercially available La(NO3)3, Eu(NO3)3, (NH4)2SO4 and NH3á¹¡H2O as the starting materials. And this precursor can be converted into pure La2O2SO4:Eu3+ phosphor by calcination at 800 Â°C for 1 h in air, which is composed of a few small needle agglomerated particles. Then the La2O2SO4:Eu3+ phosphor compact can be sintered into the LOS:Eu at 1500 Â°C for 2 h in the hybrid atmosphere of flowing hydrogen and argon. Under 387 nm UV light excitation, the LOS:Eu reveals a red light emission at 628 nm as the most prominent peak, which corresponds to the 5D0 â 7F2 transition of Eu3+ ions.\n\nIntrinsically 89Zr-labeled Gd2O2S:Eu nanophosphors with high in vivo stability for dual-modality imaging\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAi, Fanrong; Goel, Shreya; Zhan, Yonghua; Valdovinos, Hector F; Chen, Feng; Barnhart, Todd E; Cai, Weibo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRadioluminescence imaging (RLI) employs high energy particles from radioisotope decay for in situ excitation of selected nanophosphors. Co-injection of radiopharmaceuticals and nanophosphors suffers from suboptimal RL efficiency owing to the large separation between the source and the emitter. In addition, vastly different pharmacokinetic profiles of the two further impede the practical applications of this approach. To overcome the above challenges, chelator-free radiolabeled nanophosphors with excellent RL efficiency and dual-modality imaging capabilities have been proposed. Abundant O2- donors on Gd2O2S:Eu could intrinsically chelate oxophilic radionuclide 89Zr with ~80 % labeling yield. Positron emission tomography demonstrated superb long-term radiostability of [89Zr]Gd2O2S:Eu@PEG nanoparticles in vivo, and a conventional optical imaging system was used to study radiouminescence properties of [89Zr]Gd2O2S:Eu@PEG nanoparticles in vitro and in vivo.

Em particular marÃ©s terrestres influenciam o potencial terrestre causando perturbaÃ§Ãµes adicionais no movimento de satÃ©lites artificiais, as quais tem sido medidas por diversos processos.

Members of the logic family are capable of recovery, regardless of the shape of the upsetting event. Glitch propagation from an upset node is also blocked. Logic diagrams for an Inverter, Nor, Nand, and Complex Gates are provided. The logic family can be implemented in a standard, commercial CMOS process with no additional masks. DC, transient, static power, upset recovery and layout characteristics of the new family, based on a commercial 1 micron CMOS N-Well process, are described.\n\nCharge collection and SEU mechanisms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMusseau, O.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nIn the interaction of cosmic ions with microelectronic devices a dense electron-hole plasma is created along the ion track. Carriers are separated and transported by the electric field and under the action of the concentration gradient. The subsequent collection of these carriers induces a transient current at some electrical node of the device. This \"ionocurrent\" (single ion induced current) acts as any electrical perturbation in the device, propagating in the circuit and inducing failures. In bistable systems (registers, memories) the stored data can be upset. In clocked devices (microprocessors) the parasitic perturbation may propagate through the device to the outputs. This type of failure only effects the information, and do not degrade the functionally of the device. The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of single event upset in microelectronic devices. Experimental and theoretical results are presented, and actual questions and problems are discussed. A brief introduction recalls the creation of the dense plasma of electron-hole pairs. The basic processes for charge collection in a simple np junction (drift and diffusion) are presented. The funneling-field effect is discussed and experimental results are compared to numerical simulations and semi-empirical models. Charge collection in actual microelectronic structures is then presented. Due to the parasitic elements, coupling effects are observed. Geometrical effects, in densely packed structures, results in multiple errors. Electronic couplings are due to the carriers in excess, acting as minority carriers, that trigger parasitic bipolar transistors. Single event upset of memory cells is discussed, based on numerical and experimental data. The main parameters for device characterization are presented. From the physical interpretation of charge collection mechanisms, the intrinsic sensitivity of various microelectronic technologies is determined and compared to experimental data. Scaling laws and future trends are finally discussed.\n\nPlasma Total Antioxidant Capacity and Cardiometabolic Risk in Non-Obese and Clinically Healthy Young Adults.\n\nPubMed\n\nCosta, Jamille Oliveira; VÃ¡squez, CecÃ­lia M Passos; Santana, Gleiciane de Jesus; Silva, Natanael de Jesus; Braz, Juciene de Matos; Jesus, AmÃ©lia M Ribeiro de; Silva, Danielle GÃ³es da; Cunha, Luana Celina Seraphim; Barbosa, Kiriaque Barra Ferreira\n\n2017-07-10\n\nThe oxidative biomarkers play an important role in the genesis of cardiometabolic risk-related processes. To investigate the total antioxidant capacity of plasma and its association with cardiometabolic risk in non-obese and clinically healthy young adults. University students of the state of Sergipe, Brazil, aged between 18 and 25 years, were recruited for this study from May of 2013 and October of 2014. Anthropometric, clinical and biochemical parameters were measured and analyzed using protocols which were previously standardized and described in the literature. The measurement of plasma total antioxidant capacity was based on the ability that all the antioxidants present in the sample (plasma) have to inhibit the oxidation of the oxidizable substrate ABTS (2,2`- Azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate]) to ABTSâ¢+ by metmyoglobin. Approximately 25% of the sample presented more than one component of cardiometabolic risk. Low HDL-cholesterol was the most prevalent component. Compared to absence of components, the subjects with at least one component presented greater body weight and waist circumference, higher levels of diastolic blood pressure and fasting glucose, greater total cholesterol/HDL-c ratio, and lower levels of HDL-c (p < 0.05). Fasting glycemia was the only parameter which was associated with total antioxidant capacity (R2 = 0.10; Î² = 0.17; p = 0.001). The plasma total antioxidant capacity was not able to predict the cardiometabolic risk components due possibly to the establishment of compensatory mechanisms that become activated in physiological conditions.

The transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4) regulates both light and temperature signaling pathways. Here, we identified ENHANCED PHOTOMORPHOGENIC2 (EPP2) as a new repressor of photomorphogenesis in red, far-red, and blue light. Map-based cloning revealed that EPP2 encodes the SEUSS (SEU) transcription regulator. The C-terminus of SEU has transcriptional activation activity and SEU physically interacts with PIF4. Moreover, SEU promotes the expression of many genes, including auxin biosynthetic and responsive genes, and regulates IAA levels in plants. SEU associates with regulatory regions in INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE6 (IAA6) and IAA19 in a PIF4-independent manner, whereas the binding of PIF4 to these genes requires SEU. Furthermore, mutations in SEU affect H3K4me3 methylation at IAA6 and IAA19, and SEU positively regulates warm temperature-mediated hypocotyl growth together with PIF4. Therefore, our results reveal that SEU acts as a central regulator to integrate light and temperature signals to control plant growth by coordinating with PIF4. Copyright Â© 2018 The Author.

The phenomenon of single event upset (SEU) is well known in space systems and designers have generally been careful to use SEU tolerant devices or to implement error detection and correction (EDAC) techniques where appropriate. In the past, avionics designers have had no reason to consider SEU effects but is clear that the more prevalent use of memory devices combined with increasing levels of IC integration will make SEU mitigation an important design consideration for future avionic systems. To this end,moreÂ Â» it is necessary to work towards producing models of the avionics SEU environment which will permit system designers to choose components and EDAC techniques which are based on predictions of SEU rates correct to much better than an order of magnitude. Measurements of the high latitude SEU environment at avionics altitude have been made on board a commercial airliner. Results are compared with models of primary and secondary cosmic rays and atmospheric neutrons. Ground based SEU tests of static RAMs are used to predict rates in flight.Â«Â less\n\nTelemedicine: challenges to dissemination in Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaldonado, Jose Manuel Santos de Varge; Marques, Alexandre Barbosa; Cruz, Antonio\n\n2016-11-03\n\nTelemedicine has been seen as an important tool for facing the challenges of universal health systems. The goal of this article is to discuss the main challenges to its full dissemination in Brazil. Being a somewhat new area, there are not many scientific papers that systematize it. This article is an exploratory paper, as it aims to provide an overall perspective on the subject. From an economic point of view, telemedicine is a strategic area due to its an intrinsic potential of being a source for generating innovation, for requiring and incorporating technological breakthroughs from other areas, and for its interdisciplinary nature and dynamic inter-relations that drive different industries. From the social perspective, it has the potential to make access to health services democratic, by connecting remote regions with health services located in hospitals and centers of reference for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

Its implementations range from discrete components to fully integrated circuits and even to firmware or software. Often the PLL is a highly critical component of a system, as for example when it is used to derive the on-chip clock, but as of this writing no definitive single-event upset (SET)/single-event transient (SET) tolerant PLL circuit has been described. This chapter hopes to rectify that situation, at least in regard to PLLs that are used to generate clocks. Older literature on fault-tolerant PLLs deals with detection of a hard failure, which is recovered by replacement, repair, or manual restart of discrete component systems. Several patents exist along these lines (6349391, 6272647, and 7089442). A newer approach is to harden the parts of a PLL system, to one degree or another, such as by using a voltage-based charge pump or a triple modular redundant (TMR) voted voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). A more comprehensive approach is to harden by triplication and voting (TMR) all the digital pieces (primarily the divider) of a frequency synthesis PLL, but this still leaves room for errors in the VCO and the loop filter. Instead of hardening or voting pieces of a system, such as a frequency synthesis system (i.e., clock multiplier), we will show how the entire system can be voted. There are two main ways of doing this, each with advantages and drawbacks. We will show how each has advantages in certain areas, depending on the lock acquisition and tracking characteristics of the PLL. Because of this dependency on PLL characteristics, we will briefly revisit the theory of PLLs. But first we will describe the characteristics of voters and their correct application, as some literature does not follow the voting procedure that guarantees elimination of errors. Additionally, we will find that voting clocks is a bit trickier than voting data where an infallible clock is assumed. It is our job here to produce (or recover) that assumed infallible clock!\n\nNASA Education Forum at SAO on the Structure and Evolution of the Universe\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRosendhal, Jeffrey (Technical Monitor); Gould, Roy R.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nNASA's Structure and Evolution of the Universe (SEU) science theme offers an unparalleled opportunity to capture the public's imagination and inspire the next generation of scientific explorers-the generation that will determine America's lead in science and technology in the 21st century. The missions and research programs of SEU science are transporting the public to some of the universe's most exotic destinations: the beginning of time, the edge of space at the entrance to a black hole, and the great cycles of matter and energy that have slowly brought life to the universe. NASA's Office of Space Science (OSS) has put in place an Education and Public Outreach (EPO) initiative designed to do just that. Spanning all of NASA's OSS science themes, the initiative is a far-reaching partnership with the education community. As a result, NASA space science now reaches every avenue of education-from the nation's schools, science museums and planetariums, to libraries, community groups and after-school programs. As a partner in this enterprise, the,SEU Forum has successfully brought SEU science to a large and diverse audience. But this is an ongoing process, and much still needs to be done. Working with our colleagues in the OSS Support Network, and with our partners in the space science and education communities, we look forward to ensuring that the public supports and participates in the great explorations of the SEU theme. Working with the SEU missions and members of the OSS Support Network, the Forum will harness the assets of the SEU science community to: Inform, inspire, and involve the public in the explorations of the SEU science theme. Use the unique resources of the SEU science theme to enhance K-14 science, technology, and mathematics education.

The model takes into account the spatial distribution of charge collection efficiency over the cell area not considered in previous approaches. Three-dimensional calculations made by the HADRON code have shown good agreement with experimental data for the energy dependence of proton SEU cross sections, sensitive depths and other SEU observables. The model is promising for prediction of SEU rates for memory chips exposed in space and in high-energy experiments as well as for the development of a high-energy neutron dosemeter based on the SEU effect.\n\nEstimating Single-Event Logic Cross Sections in Advanced Technologies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHarrington, R. C.; Kauppila, J. S.; Warren, K. M.; Chen, Y. P.; Maharrey, J. A.; Haeffner, T. D.; Loveless, T. D.; Bhuva, B. L.; Bounasser, M.; Lilja, K.; Massengill, L. W.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nReliable estimation of logic single-event upset (SEU) cross section is becoming increasingly important for predicting the overall soft error rate. As technology scales and single-event transient (SET) pulse widths shrink to widths on the order of the setup-and-hold time of flip-flops, the probability of latching an SET as an SEU must be reevaluated. In this paper, previous assumptions about the relationship of SET pulsewidth to the probability of latching an SET are reconsidered and a model for transient latching probability has been developed for advanced technologies. A method using the improved transient latching probability and SET data is used to predict logic SEU cross section. The presented model has been used to estimate combinational logic SEU cross sections in 32-nm partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology given experimental heavy-ion SET data. Experimental SEU data show good agreement with the model presented in this paper.\n\nStudies Of Single-Event-Upset Models\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZoutendyk, J. A.; Smith, L.

Palliative Care services are patchily distributed. The Family Health Strategy, made up from 41,000 primary care teams across Brazil forms a comprehensive primary care network. The Project EstaraoSeuLado-Primary Palliative Care developed working from Community Centers. We created a model based on compassionate communities, with community carers working alongside primary care teams. We identified people who need palliative care, gave them specific care and enrolled their carers into a program of monthly meetings called \"Comunidade Cuidador\". We discussed caring at end of life and provided skills training. During 2015 we ran 8 training programmes with an average of 10 carers. The major themes of discussion were carer burnout, dealing with denial and skills needed daily. The effect of these meetings was better relations between carers and professionals with expansion of the naturally occurring supportive network. The results of this project have been remarkable. The joint working of professionals and supportive networks together is recognised as being transformational. Carers themselves spread this approach by recommending it to others they know with life limiting illness. We will discuss the model and how it can be replicated more broadly across Brazil. Family Health teams can use tools of identification, evaluation and assessment working with networks including the community as an important part. We will propose a new model of End-of-Life Care to be adopted as national policy. We have implemented a compassionate community programme in the area of Rio Grande in Brazil. This has been a combination of primary care working in harmony with communities, providing education, resources and training to enhance the skill of communities to care for their dying. This is a necessary solution for Brazil, where resources and access to healthcare is limited. Our model is successful and\n\nAn Examination of Environment Perturbation Effects on Single Event Upset Rates\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGates, Michele M.; Leidecker, Henning W.; Lewis, Mark J.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis paper presents an analysis of the sensitivity of single event upset (SEU) rate predictions to changes in the direct ionization-inducing environment. An examination based on the nature of the SEU rate equation is presented for the case in which the perturbation is constant across varying particle linear energy transfer (LET). It is shown that the relative variation in SEU rate is equal to the relative perturbation in flux. Results are also presented for the case in which the environment perturbations exist in small LET bins. Through this analysis it is shown that the relative variation in expected SEU rate is equal to that in flux only for the LET regime in which the product of the cross section and differential flux is maximum.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBatista, Antonio J. N.; Santos, Bruno; Fernandes, Ana\n\nThe data acquisition and control instrumentation cubicles room of the ITER tokamak will be irradiated with neutrons during the fusion reactor operation. A Virtex-6 FPGA from Xilinx (XC6VLX365T-1FFG1156C) is used on the ATCA-IO-PROCESSOR board, included in the ITER Catalog of I and C products - Fast Controllers. The Virtex-6 is a re-programmable logic device where the configuration is stored in Static RAM (SRAM), functional data stored in dedicated Block RAM (BRAM) and functional state logic in Flip-Flops. Single Event Upsets (SEU) due to the ionizing radiation of neutrons causes soft errors, unintended changes (bit-flips) to the values stored in statemoreÂ Â» elements of the FPGA. The SEU monitoring and soft errors repairing, when possible, were explored in this work. An FPGA built-in Soft Error Mitigation (SEM) controller detects and corrects soft errors in the FPGA configuration memory. Novel SEU sensors with Error Correction Code (ECC) detect and repair the BRAM memories. Proper management of SEU can increase reliability and availability of control instrumentation hardware for nuclear applications. The results of the tests performed using the SEM controller and the BRAM SEU sensors are presented for a Virtex-6 FPGA (XC6VLX240T-1FFG1156C) when irradiated with neutrons from the Portuguese Research Reactor (RPI), a 1 MW nuclear fission reactor operated by IST in the neighborhood of Lisbon. Results show that the proposed SEU mitigation technique is able to repair the majority of the detected SEU errors in the configuration and BRAM memories.

R.; Garrett, H. B.; Murphy, G. B.; Garrard,T. L.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe three large solar particle events, beginning on October 19, 1989 and lasting approximately six days, were characterized by high fluences of solar protons and heavy ions at 1 AU. During these events, an abnormally large number of upsets (243) were observed in the random access memory of the attitude control system (ACS) control processing electronics (CPE) on-board the geosynchronous TDRS-1 (Telemetry and Data Relay Satellite). The RAM unit affected was composed of eight Fairchild 93L422 memory chips. The Galileo spacecraft, launched on October 18, 1989 (one day prior to the solar particle events) observed the fluxes of heavy ions experienced by TDRS-1. Two solid-state detector telescopes on-board Galileo, designed to measure heavy ion species and energy, were turned on during time periods within each of the three separate events. The heavy ion data have been modeled and the time history of the events reconstructed to estimate heavy ion fluences. These fluences were converted to effective LET spectra after transport through the estimated shielding distribution around the TDRS-1 ACS system. The number of single event upsets (SEU) expected was calculated by integrating the measured cross section for the Fairchild 93L422 memory chip with average effective LET spectrum. The expected number of heavy ion induced SEU's calculated was 176. GOES-7 proton data, observed during the solar particle events, were used to estimate the number of proton-induced SEU's by integrating the proton fluence spectrum incident on the memory chips, with the two-parameter Bendel cross section for proton SEU'S. The proton fluence spectrum at the device level was gotten by transporting the protons through the estimated shielding distribution. The number of calculated proton-induced SEU's was 72, yielding a total of 248 predicted SEU'S, very dose to the 243 observed SEU'S. These calculations uniquely demonstrate the roles that solar heavy ions and protons played in the production of SEU\n\nImpact of Temporal Masking of Flip-Flop Upsets on Soft Error Rates of Sequential Circuits\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, R. M.; Mahatme, N. N.; Diggins, Z. J.; Wang, L.; Zhang, E. X.; Chen, Y. P.; Liu, Y. N.; Narasimham, B.; Witulski, A. F.; Bhuva, B. L.; Fleetwood, D. M.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nReductions in single-event (SE) upset (SEU) rates for sequential circuits due to temporal masking effects are evaluated. The impacts of supply voltage, combinational-logic delay, flip-flop (FF) SEU performance, and particle linear energy transfer (LET) values are analyzed for SE cross sections of sequential circuits. Alpha particles and heavy ions with different LET values are used to characterize the circuits fabricated at the 40-nm bulk CMOS technology node. Experimental results show that increasing the delay of the logic circuit present between FFs and decreasing the supply voltage are two effective ways of reducing SE error rates for sequential circuits for particles with low LET values due to temporal masking. SEU-hardened FFs benefit less from temporal masking than conventional FFs. Circuit hardening implications for SEU-hardened and unhardened FFs are discussed.\n\nIncorporating Probability Models of Complex Test Structures to Perform Technology Independent FPGA Single Event Upset Analysis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerg, M.

The measurable synergistic effect of TID on SEU sensitivity of 130-nm PD SOI SRAM was observed in our experiment, even though that is far less than micrometer and submicrometer devices. Moreover, SEU cross section after TID irradiation has no dependence on the data pattern that was applied during TID exposure: SEU cross sections are characterized by TID data pattern and its complement data pattern are decreased consistently rather than a preferred state and a nonpreferred state as micrometer and sub-micrometer SRAMs. The memory cell test structure allowing direct measurement of static noise margin (SNM) under standby operation was designed using identical memory cell layout of SRAM. Direct measurement of the memory cell SNM shows that both data sides' SNM is decreased by TID, indicating that SEU cross section of 130-nm PD SOI SRAM will be increased by TID. And, the decreased SNM is caused by threshold shift in memory cell transistors induced by âradiation-induced narrow channel effectâ.\n\nMethods and circuitry for reconfigurable SEU/SET tolerance\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShuler, Jr., Robert L. (Inventor)\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA device is disclosed in one embodiment that has multiple identical sets of programmable functional elements, programmable routing resources, and majority voters that correct errors. The voters accept a mode input for a redundancy mode and a split mode. In the redundancy mode, the programmable functional elements are identical and are programmed identically so the voters produce an output corresponding to the majority of inputs that agree. In a split mode, each voter selects a particular programmable functional element output as the output of the voter. Therefore, in the split mode, the programmable functional elements can perform different functions, operate independently, and/or be connected together to process different parts of the same problem.\n\nHeavy Ion Irradiation Fluence Dependence for Single-Event Upsets of NAND Flash Memory\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChen, Dakai; Wilcox, Edward; Ladbury, Raymond; Kim, Hak; Phan, Anthony; Seidleck, Christina; LaBel, Kenneth\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe investigated the single-event effect (SEE) susceptibility of the Micron 16 nm NAND flash, and found the single-event upset (SEU) cross section varied inversely with fluence. The SEU cross section decreased with increasing fluence. We attribute the effect to the variable upset sensitivities of the memory cells. The current test standards and procedures assume that SEU follow a Poisson process and do not take into account the variability in the error rate with fluence. Therefore, heavy ion irradiation of devices with variable upset sensitivity distribution using typical fluence levels may underestimate the cross section and on-orbit event rate.\n\nEvaluation of the Radiation Susceptibility of a 3D NAND Flash Memory\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChen, Dakai; Wilcox, Edward; Ladbury, Raymond; Seidleck, Christina; Kim, Hak; Phan, Anthony; LaBel, Kenneth\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe evaluated the heavy ion and proton-induced single-event effects (SEE) for a 3D NAND flash. The 3D NAND showed similar single-event upset (SEU) sensitivity to a planar NAND of similar density and performance in the multiple-cell level (MLC) storage mode. However, the single-level-cell (SLC) storage mode of the 3D NAND showed significantly reduced SEU susceptibility. Additionally, the 3D NAND showed less MBU susceptibility than the planar NAND, with reduced number of upset bits per byte and reduced cross sections overall. However, the 3D architecture exhibited angular sensitivities for both base and face angles, reflecting the anisotropic nature of the SEU vulnerability in space. Furthermore, the SEU cross section decreased with increasing fluence for both the 3D NAND and the latest generation planar NAND, indicating a variable upset rate for a space mission. These unique characteristics introduce complexity to traditional ground irradiation test procedures.\n\nHeavy Ion and Proton-Induced Single Event Upset Characteristics of a 3D NAND Flash Memory\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChen, Dakai; Wilcox, Edward; Ladbury, Raymond; Seidleck, Christina; Kim, Hak; Phan, Anthony; Label, Kenneth\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe evaluated the effects of heavy ion and proton irradiation for a 3D NAND flash.

SPICE simulations established that particle strikes in the output nodes of a clock control logic flip-flop could produce transients of sufficient amplitude and duration to be accepted as legitimate pulses by clock buffers fed by the flip-flop's output nodes. The buffers would then output false clock pulses, thereby advancing the state of the present flip-flops. Masking the clock logic on one ofmoreÂ Â» the test chips made the flip-flop data advance cease, confirming the clock logic as the source of the SEU. By introducing N{sub 2} gas, at reduced pressures, into the SEU test chamber to attenuate Cf-252 particle LET's, a 24-26 MeV-cm{sup 2}/mg LET threshold was deduced. Subsequent tests, at the 88-inch cyclotron at Berkeley, established an LET threshold of 30 MeV-cm{sup 2}/mg (283 MeV Cu at 0{degrees}) for the generation of false clocks. Cyclotron SEU tests are considered definitive, while Cf-252 data usually is not. However, in this instance Cf-252 tests proved analytically useful, providing SEU characterization data that was both timely and inexpensive.Â«Â less\n\nMaking A D-Latch Sensitive To Alpha Particles\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBuehler, Martin G.; Blaes, Brent R.; Nixon, Robert H.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nStandard complementary metal oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) D-latch integrated circuit modified to increase susceptibility to single-event upsets (SEU's) (changes in logic state) caused by impacts of energetic alpha particles.

We propose a general and efficient conversion in the standard model that transforms a secure signature scheme to SEU signature scheme. In order to construct that conversion, we use a chameleon commitment scheme. Here a chameleon commitment scheme is a variant of commitment scheme such that one can change the committed value after publishing the commitment if one knows the secret key. We define the chosen message security notion for the chameleon commitment scheme, and show that the signature scheme transformed by our proposed conversion satisfies the SEU property if the chameleon commitment scheme is chosen message secure. By modifying the proposed conversion, we also give a general and efficient conversion in the random oracle model, that transforms a secure signature scheme into a SEU signature scheme. This second conversion also uses a chameleon commitment scheme but only requires the key only attack security for it.\n\nSingle event effects and laser simulation studies\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKim, Q.; Schwartz, H.; Mccarty, K.; Coss, J.; Barnes, C.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe single event upset (SEU) linear energy transfer threshold (LETTH) of radiation hardened 64K Static Random Access Memories (SRAM's) was measured with a picosecond pulsed dye laser system. These results were compared with standard heavy ion accelerator (Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)) measurements of the same SRAM's. With heavy ions, the LETTH of the Honeywell HC6364 was 27 MeV-sq cm/mg at 125 C compared with a value of 24 MeV-sq cm/mg obtained with the laser. In the case of the second type of 64K SRAM, the IBM640lCRH no upsets were observed at 125 C with the highest LET ions used at BNL. In contrast, the pulsed dye laser tests indicated a value of 90 MeV-sq cm/mg at room temperature for the SEU-hardened IBM SRAM. No latchups or multiple SEU's were observed on any of the SRAM's even under worst case conditions. The results of this study suggest that the laser can be used as an inexpensive laboratory SEU prescreen tool in certain cases.\n\nApplication of RADSAFE to Model Single Event Upset Response of a 0.25 micron CMOS SRAM\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWarren, Kevin M.; Weller, Robert A.; Sierawski, Brian; Reed, Robert A.; Mendenhall, Marcus H.; Schrimpf, Ronald D.; Massengill, Lloyd; Porter, Mark; Wilkerson, Jeff; LaBel, Kenneth A.;\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe RADSAFE simulation framework is described and applied to model Single Event Upsets (SEU) in a 0.25 micron CMOS 4Mbit Static Random Access Memory (SRAM).

Through the use of a thin-film scintillator, providing energy information on each fission fragment, individual SEU's and ion energy can be associated to calculate the cross section curves. Results are presented from tests of several SRAM's over the 17-43 MeV-cm squared/mg LET range. Values obtained for SEU cross sections and LET thresholds are in good agreement with the results from accelerator testing. The equipment is described, the theory of thin-film scintillation detector response is summarized, experimental procedures are reviewed, and the test results are discussed.\n\nNew insights gained on mechanisms of low-energy proton-induced SEUs by minimizing energy straggle\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nDodds, Nathaniel Anson; Dodd, Paul E.; Shaneyfelt, Marty R.; ...\n\n2015-12-01\n\nIn this study, we present low-energy proton single-event upset (SEU) data on a 65 nm SOI SRAM whose substrate has been completely removed. Since the protons only had to penetrate a very thin buried oxide layer, these measurements were affected by far less energy loss, energy straggle, flux attrition, and angular scattering than previous datasets. The minimization of these common sources of experimental interference allows more direct interpretation of the data and deeper insight into SEU mechanisms. The results show a strong angular dependence, demonstrate that energy straggle, flux attrition, and angular scattering affect the measured SEU cross sections, andmoreÂ Â» prove that proton direct ionization is the dominant mechanism for low-energy proton-induced SEUs in these circuits.Â«Â less\n\nHeavy-ion induced single-event upset in integrated circuits\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nZoutendyk, J.

Therefore, a mixed gamma and neutron radiation field dominates the accelerators environment. The gamma radiation induced Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effect manifests the long-term deterioration of the electronic devices operating in accelerator environment. On the other hand, the neutron radiation is responsible for Single Event Effects (SEE) and may cause a temporal loss of functionality of electronic systems. This phenomenon is known as Single Event Upset (SEU). The neutron dose (KERMA) was used to scale the neutron induced SEU in the SRAM chips. Hence, in order to estimate the neutron KERMA conversion factor for Silicon (Si), dedicated calibration experiments using an Americium-Beryllium (241Am/Be) neutron standard source was carried out. Single Event Upset (SEU) influences the short-term operation of SRAM compared to the gamma induced TID effect. We are at present investigating the feasibility of an SRAM based real-time beam-loss monitor for high-energy accelerators utilizing the SEU caused by fast neutrons. This paper highlights the effects of gamma and neutron radiations on Static Random Access Memory (SRAM), placed at selected locations near the Superconducting Linear Accelerator driving the Vacuum UV Free Electron Laser (VUVFEL) of DESY.\n\nSingle-event effects in avionics\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nNormand, E.\n\n1996-04-01\n\nThe occurrence of single-event upset (SEU) in aircraft electronics has evolved from a series of interesting anecdotal incidents to accepted fact. A study completed in 1992 demonstrated that SEU`s are real, that the measured in-flight rates correlate with the atmospheric neutron flux, and that the rates can be calculated using laboratory SEU data. Once avionics DEU was shown to be an actual effect, it had to be dealt with in avionics designs. The major concern is in random access memories (RAM`s), both static (SRAM`s) and dynamic (DRAM`s), because these microelectronic devices contain the largest number of bits, but other parts,moreÂ Â» such as microprocessors, are also potentially susceptible to upset. In addition, other single-event effects (SEE`s), specifically latch-up and burnout, can also be induced by atmospheric neutrons.Â«Â less\n\nSingle Event Upset in Static Random Access Memories in Atmospheric Neutron Environments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArita, Yutaka; Takai, Mikio; Ogawa, Izumi; Kishimoto, Tadafumi\n\n2003-07-01\n\nSingle-event upsets (SEUs) in a 0.4 Î¼m 4 Mbit complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) static random access memory (SRAM) were investigated in various atmospheric neutron environments at sea level, at an altitude of 2612 m mountain, at an altitude of commercial airplane, and at an underground depth of 476 m. Neutron-induced SEUs increase with the increase in altitude. For a device with a borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) film, SEU rates induced by thermal neutrons increase with the decrease in the cell charge of a memory cell. A thermal neutron-induced SEU is significant in SRAMs with a small cell charge. With the conditions of small cell charge, thermal neutron-induced SEUs account for 60% or more of the total neutron-induced SEUs. The SEU rate induced by atmospheric thermal neutrons can be estimated by an acceleration test using 252Cf.\n\nXilinx Virtex-5QV (V5QV) Independent SEU Data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBerg, Melanie D.; LaBel, Kenneth A.; Pellish, Jonathan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThis is an independent study to determine the single event destructive and transient susceptibility of the Xilinx Virtex-5QV (SIRF) device.

J.; Sun, J. S.; Cronquist, B. E.; McCollum, J. L.; Speers, T. M.; Plants, W. C.; Katz, R. B.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nAn SRAM (static random access memory)-based reprogrammable FPGA (field programmable gate array) is investigated for space applications. A new commercial prototype, named the RS family, was used as an example for the investigation. The device is fabricated in a 0.25 micrometers CMOS technology. Its architecture is reviewed to provide a better understanding of the impact of single event upset (SEU) on the device during operation. The SEU effect of different memories available on the device is evaluated. Heavy ion test data and SPICE simulations are used integrally to extract the threshold LET (linear energy transfer). Together with the saturation cross-section measurement from the layout, a rate prediction is done on each memory type. The SEU in the configuration SRAM is identified as the dominant failure mode and is discussed in detail. The single event transient error in combinational logic is also investigated and simulated by SPICE. SEU mitigation by hardening the memories and employing EDAC (error detection and correction) at the device level are presented. For the configuration SRAM (CSRAM) cell, the trade-off between resistor de-coupling and redundancy hardening techniques are investigated with interesting results. Preliminary heavy ion test data show no sign of SEL (single event latch-up). With regard to ionizing radiation effects, the increase in static leakage current (static I(sub CC)) measured indicates a device tolerance of approximately 50krad(Si).\n\nSoft-error tolerance and energy consumption evaluation of embedded computer with magnetic random access memory in practical systems "
