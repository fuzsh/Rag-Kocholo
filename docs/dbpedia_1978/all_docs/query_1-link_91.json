Joel Pett was the Cartoonists Rights Network International’s board of directors.\n\nEarly life\n\nPett was born in Bloomington, Indiana. He moved to Ibadan, Nigeria with his family in 1959 before returning to America in 1964.\n\nAfter college at Indiana University, he began doing freelance cartooning jobs for over nine years. In April 1984, he joined the Lexington Herald-Leader as their staff cartoonist.\n\nPett’s cartoons have appeared in hundreds of newspapers and magazines nationwide, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Boston Globe. He is a weekly contributor to USA Today, writes a regular feature on cartoons for the Los Angeles Times, and does a monthly cartoon for the educational journal Phi Delta Kappan.\n\nJoel Pett also received the 1999 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for cartoons highlighting the plight of the disadvantaged, and the 1995 Global Media Award for cartoons on population issues. He is a past president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, and a past Pulitzer juror. He has conducted three overseas seminars on editorial cartooning as a guest speaker of the U.S. State Department.\n\nCartooning\n\nFour-time Pulitzer finalist and 2000 Pulitzer prize winner Joel Pett has been at the Lexington Herald-Leader since 1984. His sharp-edged political cartoons have appeared in publications worldwide, including the Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Times of London, USA Today and the Katmandu Times.\n\nOther media credits include France 24 TV, NPR’s All Things Considered, Morning Edition and The World, PBS’ Newshour, MSNBC’s All In with Chris Hayes, and magazines: Time, Newsweek, Business Week, Institutional Investor, Spa Finder, Sierra, and MAD.\n\nPett also received the 1999 Robert F.

He is a past president of the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, a past Pulitzer juror, and has conducted three overseas seminars on editorial cartooning as a guest speaker of the U.S. State Department.\n\nA sometime stand-up comic, Pett has shared his blend of deceptively simple and provocative humor at dozens of venues, including the Newseum in Washington, D.C., Boston’s John F. Kennedy Library, Indiana University, Whitman College, Ohio State University, Brandeis University and more.\n\nAwards\n\nPett was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1989 and 1998 before winning in 2000. Pett is also the winner of the 1999 Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for cartooning, and a 1995 winner of the Global Media Award for cartoons on population issues."
