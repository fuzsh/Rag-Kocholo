Nov. 20, 1928, Sofia, Bulgaria), military governor (1901-03) and governor (1903-05) of Kutaisi.\n\nA. Smailov\n\nSmailov, Alikhan (Askhanovich) (b. Dec. 18, 1972, Alma-Ata, Kazakh S.S.R. [now Almaty, Kazakhstan]), finance minister (2018-20), first deputy prime minister (2019-22), and prime minister (2022-24) of Kazakhstan. He was also chairman of the Statistics Agency (1999-2003, 2009-14) and assistant to the president (2015-18).\n\nSmailov, Yerlan (Baykenovich) (b. Jan. 27, 1951), head of Dzhezkazgan oblast (1996-97).\n\nSmall, Len(nington) (b. June 16, 1862, Kankakee, Ill. - d.

April 29, 1940), governor of St. Helena (1995-99).\n\nSmallwood, Sir Denis (Graham) (b. Aug. 13, 1918 - d. July 26, 1997), administrator of the British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus (1969-70); knighted 1969.\n\nJ.R. Smallwood\n\nSmallwood, Joseph R(oberts), byname Joey Smallwood (b. Dec. 24, 1900, Gambo, Newfoundland [now Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada] - d. Dec. 17, 1991, St. John's, Nfld.), premier of Newfoundland (1949-72). In 1920-25 he worked in New York City for leftist newspapers and for the Progressive Party. Returning to Newfoundland, he became a union organizer and unsuccessfully ran for office in the 1932 election. In 1946 he was elected to a convention called by Britain to decide Newfoundland's future, and he led a campaign for the territory to join Canada. \"I dragged Newfoundland kicking and screaming into the 20th century,\" he once said. After pro-confederation forces won the 1948 vote by a 7,000-vote (2%) margin, he was appointed premier of an interim government on April 1, 1949, and won the first provincial election in May. A man of grand ambitions, he said in 1951: \"I'd like to go down as the greatest Newfoundlander who ever lived.\" His Liberal Party won the elections of 1951, 1956, 1959, 1962, and 1966 before being defeated in 1971. His most turbulent year was 1959, when his repression of a strike by 1,250 members of the International Forest Workers of America caused a split within his party. The strike dragged on for months and although the loggers went back to work, his power was never again the same. He resigned as party head in 1972. After losing a 1974 bid to be reelected party leader, the colourful Smallwood formed the Liberal Reform Party. He finally retired from politics in 1977. He was also the author of a six-volume history, The Book of Newfoundland (1937, 1967, 1975), and accumulated heavy personal debt in his last years with a project for a four-volume Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, completed after his death.\n\nSmallwood, William (b. 1732, Kent county, Maryland - d.

He edited the first Lithuanian daily, Vilniaus Zinios, and the Democratic Party organ, Lietuvos Ukininkas. In 1905 he was elected a member of the Presidium of the Vilnius Diet, which proclaimed Lithuanian autonomy. On the convocation of the Lithuanian National Council, during the German military occupation of the country in 1917, he was unanimously elected chairman of its Presidium, and in this capacity was the first head of state when Lithuania became independent in 1918, before becoming the first president. In 1921 he was chairman of the Lithuanian delegation at Riga during the negotiations on the settlement of the Latvian-Lithuanian boundary dispute. Early in 1923, when the insurrection broke out in the Memel Territory against the German directorate, Smetona was requested by the Lithuanian government to compose the trouble in cooperation with the Allied representatives. After a military coup of December 1926, Smetona was elected to become president again. Parliamentary government was suspended, and in 1929 he assumed full dictatorial power. He was reelected in 1931 and 1938. In 1940, when Lithuania became a part of the Soviet Union, Smetona fled to Germany and then to the United States, where he arrived in March 1941. He died in a fire.\n\nSmid, Ladislav (b. July 16, 1925, Kladno, Czechoslovakia [now in Czech Republic] - d. April 14, 1999, Havlíckuv Brod, Czech Republic), Czechoslovak diplomat.

He fought against Russia on the Eastern Front in 1914-17 and again during the Polish campaign of 1919-20 and was briefly military affairs minister in a provisional government (1918). During this time he acquired the nickname Smigly (\"nimble\"), which he soon added to his name. He was inspector of the Polish army (1922-35) and became one of Marshal Józef Pilsudski's closest associates during this period. After Pilsudski's death in 1935 he became virtual dictator of Poland, assuming the post of inspector-general of the armed forces. He was made marshal in 1936. Prior to the German invasion in September 1939, he was designated commander-in-chief of the army and successor to Pres. Ignacy Moscicki. Less than three weeks after the invasion, he fled to Romania. The exile government removed him as inspector-general in November. In October 1940 he was arrested in Bucharest in connection with the discovery of an alleged Polish espionage organization. In December he escaped from internment at Dragoslavele; in Hungary he organized a Camp of Fighting Poland and he returned to his country in October 1941, where he soon died of natural causes.\n\nSmiljanic, Zivorad (b. Feb. 6, 1942, Zajecar, eastern Serbia - d. Dec. 14, 2018, Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Serbia), president of the Assembly of Vojvodina (1997-2000).\n\nSmirnov, Aleksandr (Petrovich) (b. Sept. 8 [Aug. 27, O.S.], 1878, Nikola, Tver province, Russia - d. [executed] Feb. 9, 1938), Soviet politician.

[executed] July 28, 1938), chairman of the State Planning Commission of the Soviet Union (1937).\n\nSmirnov, Grigory (Lavrentyevich) (b. 1910 - d. 1981), Soviet politician. He was a deputy premier (1960) and minister of agriculture (1960-61) of the Russian S.F.S.R. and chairman of the Executive Committee of Penza oblast (1961-65 [1962-64 rural]).\n\nIgor Smirnov\n\nSmirnov, Igor (Nikolayevich) (b. Oct. 23, 1941, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, Russian S.F.S.R.), leader (1990-2011) of Moldova's breakaway Dniester Republic (Transnistria). He moved to Moldova in 1986 and became mayor of Tiraspol. He was jailed in 1991 on charges of supporting the failed coup against Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but was released and charges were dropped. Leaders of Transnistria, an eastern region with 700,000 people, had proclaimed independence in 1990 amid fears that Moldova planned to reunite with neighbouring Romania. Transnistria's people are mostly ethnic Slavs while some two-thirds of Moldovans are ethnic Romanians. Smirnov won Transnistria's first presidential election in 1991 and campaigned for recognition as a separate nation. Fighting between separatists and the Moldovan government killed 700 people in 1992. The fighting ended after Russian troops were sent to the region, but relations remained tense. Smirnov said he would insist that the Russian troops, numbering about 7,000, remain in the region. He was reelected president of the area in 1996 and vowed to push for full independence. Moldovan president-elect Petru Lucinschi said that the election had no legal standing. \"This part of our territory keeps violating our laws,\" Lucinschi told reporters. But given the Russian troop presence the Moldovan government was powerless to end Smirnov's separatist regime. He was again reelected in 2001 and 2006 but only came third in 2011.\n\nSmirnov, Ivan (Nikolayevich) (b. Jan. 5, 1899 [Dec. 24, 1898, O.S.] - d.

Dec. 30, 1873, New York City - d. Oct. 4, 1944, New York City), governor of New York (1919-21, 1923-29). He first ran for elective office in 1903, when - supported by Tammany Hall, the New York City Democratic political organization - he was elected to the state assembly; in 1913 he won the powerful office of speaker. He was a member of a commission investigating factory conditions (1911) and a delegate to the state constitutional revision committee (1915). Tammany Hall made him New York county sheriff (1915) and president of the New York City Board of Aldermen (1917). He resigned in 1918 to run for governor against the Republican incumbent and, although few believed he had a chance, he won by a narrow margin. Though he lost the governorship in the nationwide shift to the Republicans in 1920, he was elected to three more terms in 1922, 1924, and 1926. With his brown derby hat, ever-present cigar, and common touch, he was an extraordinary vote-getter. He was the first Roman Catholic to be seriously considered as a candidate for the U.S. presidency. First suggested as a possibility in 1920, he actively sought the nomination in 1924, but his religion worked against him in the convention, as did his opposition to Prohibition, and after a prolonged deadlock with William G. McAdoo, the \"dry\" candidate, neither candidate was nominated. In 1928, he had no serious opposition and was nominated on the first ballot. In the election, however, he was defeated by the conservative Republican Herbert Hoover, winning only eight states and losing New York. Although giving belated support to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, he broke with him later, opposed the New Deal, and in 1936 and 1940 supported Roosevelt's Republican opponents.\n\nSmith, Alvin (Alfred) (b. Sept. 23, 1951, Hatchet Bay, Bahamas), Bahamian politician. He was leader of the opposition (2002-05), speaker of the House of Assembly (2007-12), and high commissioner to Canada (2017-20).\n\nSmith, Arnold (Cantwell) (b. Jan. 18, 1915, Toronto, Ont. - d. Feb. 7, 1994, Toronto), secretary-general of the Commonwealth (1965-75). He was an attaché to the British legation at Tallinn (1940) and to the British embassy in Cairo (1940-43), was transferred to the Canadian diplomatic service in 1943, served in Moscow, Brussels, New York City, Phnom Penh, and London, and was ambassador to the United Arab Republic (1958-61) and the Soviet Union (1961-63), then returned to Canada to become assistant undersecretary of state for external affairs. In 1965 he was elected by Commonwealth leaders as the organization's first secretary-general. He had barely taken over the post when the Commonwealth's cohesiveness was threatened by the unilateral declaration of independence from Britain by the white-minority government in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). In 1971, the alliance was again jeopardized when Britain proposed to sell arms to South Africa. Smith pleaded with Prime Minister Edward Heath, and eventually the arms sale was abandoned. During his two five-year terms in office, the Commonwealth weathered a number of other events that threatened to tear it apart: Idi Amin's regime in Uganda, Pakistan's civil war and the emergence of Bangladesh, Singapore's expulsion from the Malaysian federation, and coups in Ghana, Cyprus, Pakistan, and Nigeria. Throughout his tenure, he endeavoured to shift the Commonwealth \"from residual but significant Anglo-centricity to full multilateralism\" as he later put it. He was a co-founder (1976) and the first chairman of the North-South Institute in Ottawa. He was made a Companion of Honour in 1975 and in 1984 was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\nSmith, Benjamin (b. Jan. 10, 1756, Brunswick county, North Carolina - d.

Smith\n\nSmith (of Aliwal), Sir Henry George Wakelyn, (1st) Baronet, byname Sir Harry Smith (b. June 28, 1787, Whittlesea, Isle of Ely, England - d.

April 8, 1919, Selukwe, Southern Rhodesia [now Shurugwi, Zimbabwe] - d. Nov. 20, 2007, near Cape Town, South Africa), prime minister of Rhodesia (1964-79). He was elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly in 1948 as a member of the opposition Rhodesia Liberal Party. He changed allegiance to the governing United Federal Party in 1953 when the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland was formed. By 1958 he was chief government whip in parliament, but he left the Federalists in 1961 when they approved a new constitution allowing for increased Black African representation. He then established the Rhodesian Front Party, which was initially unpopular but in 1962 won a surprise victory at the elections by promising to attain independence from Britain while preserving white rule. The Federation was dissolved in 1963 and he became prime minister of Southern Rhodesia (later called Rhodesia) in April 1964. In July he rejected the proposal to discuss a new constitution that would ensure eventual black-majority rule. Revealing himself increasingly inflexible in subsequent talks, he finally, on Nov. 11, 1965, unilaterally declared independence. Britain did not recognize this, but took no decisive action to assert its authority. Economic sanctions were applied, but it was the increasing black guerrilla activity and the large military expenditures needed to counter it which compelled Smith finally in 1977 to negotiate with the moderate black leader Abel Muzorewa. A Transitional Executive Council consisting of himself and three black leaders was established in 1978, and in June 1979 he ceded the prime ministership to Muzorewa and served as minister without portfolio in the government of \"Zimbabwe Rhodesia\" which existed until December. He continued to serve in the parliament of Zimbabwe until 1987.\n\nSmith, Israel (b. April 6, 1759, Suffield, Connecticut - d.

He was also speaker of the House of Commons (1705-08).\n\nJohn Smith\n\nSmith, John (b. Sept. 13, 1938, Dalmally, Argyll, Scotland - d. May 12, 1994, London, England), British politician. He joined the Labour Party in 1955 and, after unsuccessful efforts in 1963 and 1964, was elected to Parliament in 1970 for Lanarkshire North (from 1983 Monklands East). In 1972 he defied Labour's anti-European policy and voted in favour of the Conservative government's proposal that the U.K. join the European Communities. He first joined the government in 1974 to become undersecretary of state for energy; as minister of state for energy (1975-76) he was responsible for the early stages of the development of North Sea oil. After serving as minister of state in the Privy Council Office (1976-78), Smith, at 39, became the youngest member of Prime Minister James Callaghan's cabinet as trade secretary (1978-79). After Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives ousted Labour from power, Smith used his debating skills in the shadow cabinet as opposition spokesman on trade, prices, and consumer protection (1979-82), energy (1982-83), employment (1983-84), and trade and industry (1984-87). In 1987 opposition leader Neil Kinnock appointed him shadow chancellor of the exchequer. He imposed strict financial discipline on Labour's policy-making in opposition. \"We will not spend, nor will we promise to spend, more than Britain can afford,\" he said repeatedly, and he insisted that none of his shadow cabinet colleagues make commitments that would undermine that pledge. Widely admired for his integrity, he was by the end of 1991 Labour's most popular politician. After Labour's disastrous April 1992 election defeat, Kinnock resigned and on July 18 Smith was elected party leader by a 91% majority. The party seemed well positioned for the next election when Smith suddenly died from a heart attack.\n\nSmith, John B(utler) (b. April 12, 1838, Saxton's River, Vt. - d.

In 1976, she was the first woman to organize and call to order the National Convention of a major American political party. One of the most respected political figures in the state, she was a founding member of the Iowa Women's Political Caucus and was inducted into the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame in 1977. Smith served on the board of directors of Planned Parenthood of Greater Iowa in 1986-92. At a National Women's Political Caucus in August 1989, she said the caucus must convey the message that supporting reproductive rights is \"a good thing to do.\"\n\nSmith, Michael (b.

He said he decided at the age of 8 that he would one day become governor. A Democrat, he was lieutenant governor in 1963-69 and was elected governor in 1968, relying on personal contacts, face-to-face campaigning, and direct mail. Besides his old-fashioned electioneering, he was also known for his trademark polka-dot ties. As governor he focused on education and criminal justice, pushing for the first comprehensive drug abuse program in Texas. He was also instrumental in passing the state's first minimum wage law. Reelected in 1970, his second term was dominated by fallout from an influence-peddling scandal that resulted in the defeat of many long-term officeholders in the 1972 election.\n\nSmith, Robert (b.

In 1934, at the age of 37, he became the youngest Canadian university president when he was named to head the University of Manitoba. In 1945 he became president of the University of Toronto. At times it appeared he might be named leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada; he was nominated for the leadership in 1942, but withdrew in favour of Premier John Bracken of Manitoba.

Feb. 27, 1980, Haspin, Golan Heights [Israeli-occupied Syria]), finance minister of Israel (2022- ). He was also minister of transportation and road safety (2019-20). A self-described \"fascist homophobe,\" he has called for pogroms against Palestinians, prompting some rare (if inconsequential) criticism from Western countries. He stoked Israel's genocidal policy in Gaza, saying in 2024 that starving 2 million Palestinians to death \"might be justified and moral\" but the world would not let Israel do it.\n\nSmuts\n\nSmuts, Jan (Christian), Christian also spelled Christiaan (b. May 24, 1870, Bovenplaats, near Riebeeck West, Cape Colony [now in South Africa] - d. Sept. 11, 1950, Irene, near Pretoria, South Africa), prime minister (1919-24, 1939-48), defense minister (1910-20, 1939-48), interior minister (1910-12), finance minister (1912-15), and justice minister (1933-39) of South Africa. He was also minister of mines (1910-12) and native affairs (1919-24). In 1898 he was appointed state attorney of Transvaal. He fought in the South African (Boer) War (1899-1902) and afterwards worked with Louis Botha to achieve an alliance between Boer and British groups in South Africa. Having achieved responsible government for the Transvaal in 1907, they directed their efforts toward the unification of the South African colonies, which came in 1910. Botha became prime minister and Smuts his right-hand man. In World War I they suppressed rebellion in South Africa, conquered South West Africa, and launched a campaign in East Africa. Smuts then went to England for an imperial conference (March 1917), where British prime minister Lloyd George at once recognized his abilities and included him in the war cabinet. He organized the Royal Air Force and was concerned in all major decisions about the war. When Botha died in 1919, Smuts became prime minister. Defeated by a coalition of the Nationalist and Labour parties in 1924, he remained in opposition until 1933, when he and J.B.M. Hertzog joined forces against the more extreme nationalists and he became deputy prime minister. In 1939 the two split over whether South Africa should join Britain in World War II. When Smuts's view prevailed in parliament, he replaced Hertzog as prime minister and South Africa declared war on Germany. He represented South Africa at the 1945 San Francisco Conference and played a major role in drafting the Charter of the United Nations. At the 1948 general election his party was defeated by the Nationalists.\n\nSmylie, Robert E(ben) (b. Oct. 31, 1914, Marcus, Iowa - d. July 17, 2004, Boise, Idaho), governor of Idaho (1955-67). In 1947 he became deputy to Idaho Attorney General Robert Ailshie, and he was appointed to replace Ailshie when he died later that year. Smylie was elected to a full four-year term as attorney general in 1950 and was elected governor four years later. His administration saw an increase in the minimum wage, institution of the five-day work week for state employees, an extensive highway construction program, and the establishment of the state park system. He helped moderate Republicans nationally regroup following the defeat of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential election. It was Smylie's decision to embrace the imposition of a sales tax in 1965 that enabled supporters to round up the votes needed for passage. In his autobiography, he wrote that his support for the 3-cent tax was probably a major factor in his upset defeat in the Republican primary a year later to state Sen. Don Samuelson. Still he called it the most important legislative act in the state's first century, creating what policy-makers call Idaho's three-legged stool of income, property, and sales taxes. Before his failed reelection bid in 1966, Smylie had been mentioned as a possible vice presidential nominee in 1968.\n\nSmyr, Rauli (Kyazimovich) (b.

March 4, 1838, Georgetown, British Guiana [now Guyana]), governor of the Bahamas (1829-33) and British Guiana (1833-38). He was made baronet in 1821.\n\nSmyth, John William (b. May 13, 1880, London, England - d. Feb. 2, 1968), chief commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (1931-35).\n\nSmyth, Sir Leicester, original name (until 1866) Leicester Curzon-Howe (b.

May 15, 1918, Nottingham Road, Natal [now KwaZulu-Natal], South Africa), prime minister (1905-06) and administrator (1910-18) of Natal.\n\nSnedden\n\nSnedden, Sir Billy Mackie (b. Dec. 31, 1926, Perth, Western Australia - d. June 27, 1987, Sydney, N.S.W.), Australian politician. A member of parliament for the Melbourne constituency of Bruce (1955-83), he was attorney general (1963-66) under Sir Robert Menzies and served successive Liberal-Country Party prime ministers as minister for immigration (1966-69), minister for labour and national service (1969-71), treasurer (1971-73), and leader of the House (1966-71). As leader of the Liberal Party in opposition from December 1972, Snedden proved insufficiently combative to counter Labor Party prime minister Gough Whitlam effectively; Snedden was ousted as party leader by the more abrasive Malcolm Fraser in March 1975. Snedden was outstandingly successful as speaker (1976-83) of the House of Representatives. He was knighted in 1977.\n\nSnegur\n\nSnegur, Mircea (Ion), Russian Mircha (Ivanovich) Snegur (b. Jan. 17, 1940, Trifanesti village, Romania [now in Moldova] - d. Sept. 13, 2023), president of Moldova (1990-97). He was a member of the Communist Party from 1964 to 1990, becoming a secretary of the Central Committee of the Moldavian party in 1985-89. He became chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (1989-90) and chairman of the Supreme Soviet (1990) of the Moldavian S.S.R. An advocate of Moldavian sovereignty and full economic independence, his victory in the April 1990 election over Communist Party leader Petru Lucinschi reflected the strength of his support among nationalists in Moldavia's parliament. In September the Supreme Soviet created a new post of executive president, to which he was elected unopposed. Following Moldova's declaration of independence in August 1991, he was confirmed in a popular election in December, again as the only candidate. During his tenure as president, tensions increased between the central Moldovan government and separatist forces in Transnistria, an eastern region with a majority of Ukrainians and Russians. A brief civil war between Moldovans and Transnistrians was quelched by Russian troops in 1992. Snegur was instrumental in the transition from centralized economic planning and the development of an independent foreign and security policy for Moldova; while the republic joined the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Snegur insisted that Moldova not participate in many of the CIS's main economic and military conventions. In the 1996 presidential elections he led with 39% of the vote in the first round, but was defeated by Lucinschi in the runoff. After his defeat he remained active in Moldovan party politics, having established the centre-right Party of Rebirth and Conciliation in 1995. In the 2001 parliamentary elections, however, the party failed to cross the 6% threshold for representation.\n\nSneidern, Axel (Wilhelm Teodor) von (b.

Oct. 8, 1985, Seabrook Island, S.C.), U.S. government official. In 1930 he joined the field service of the comptroller of the currency of the U.S. and served with this office until 1937, when he became head of the St. Louis, Mo., agency of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. During World War II he helped organize the Defense Plant Corporation, an RFC subsidiary, and as its operational vice-president and director administered the agency's commitments of more than $10,000,000,000 to finance war plants. He was vice-president of the First National Bank of St. Louis from January 1943 to April 1945 when he became federal loan administrator. Snyder was made director of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion July 17, 1945, and was secretary of the treasury (1946-53) in the cabinet of Pres. Harry S. Truman. He presided over the nation's booming postwar economy, celebrating a big tax cut in 1948 but then proclaiming within two years that paying for vital military needs - especially in Korea - meant \"tax increases all along the line are inevitable.\" He was closely involved in U.S. efforts to help rebuild Europe and Japan, and he presided over reorganization of the U.S. tax agency, then known as the Internal Revenue Bureau, in the face of congressional charges of staff loafing and inefficiency.\n\nSnyder, Meredith P(inxton) (b. Oct. 22, 1859, Winston-Salem, N.C. - d.

Oct. 12, 1920, Sheffield Park, East Sussex, England - d. Sept. 16, 1987, North Warnborough, Hampshire, England), British politician. Member of Parliament for Bedford (1950-66), he was parliamentary private secretary (1952-55) to his father-in-law, Sir Winston Churchill (Soames had married Mary Churchill in 1947) and perhaps came closest to real power in Britain during the summer of 1953 when, unknown to the public, the prime minister was incapacitated by a stroke. Soames was secretary of state for war (1958-60) and minister of agriculture (1960-64) in Harold Macmillan's cabinet. Harold Wilson's Labour government sent him as ambassador to Paris (1968-72) to work toward Britain's entry into the European Communities (EC). During the period 1973-77 he was a vice-president of the EC Commission. Created a life peer in 1978, he was leader of the House of Lords (1979-81); soon, however, he became one of the first of a long line of traditional Tories who found themselves in conflict with the Thatcherite style of government. He was the last governor of Rhodesia (1979-80), where he ended a bitter civil war and presided over the first elections for an independent Zimbabwe.\n\nA.J.O. Soares\n\nSoares, Abílio José Osório (b. June 2, 1947, Laclubar, Portuguese Timor [now Timor-Leste] - d. June 17, 2007), governor of Timor Timur (1992-99). Accused of failing to control civilian militias set up by Indonesia ahead of East Timor's vote for independence in 1999, he was found guilty of crimes against humanity by a special Indonesian court on Aug. 14, 2002, and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was later cleared on appeal and released after serving only four months, a move that angered rights groups.\n\nSoares, Alaor Prata (b. June 17, 1882, Uberaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil - d.

Dec. 7, 1924, Lisbon, Portugal - d. Jan. 7, 2017, Lisbon), president of Portugal (1986-96). Under the right-wing dictatorship he was imprisoned 12 times and twice exiled (São Tomé, 1968; Paris, 1970-74). In 1964 he and others founded the Portuguese Socialist Action, a clandestine society which in 1973 transformed into the Socialist Party (PS) with him as secretary-general. After the 1974 revolution by leftist military officers, he was foreign minister (1974-75) in provisional cabinets appointed by the military and oversaw the negotiations for the independence of Portugal's overseas colonies. He became the first constitutionally elected prime minister since the revolution (1976-78), heading first a minority Socialist government and then a coalition with the Christian Democrats and while in office negotiating Portugal's first agreement with the International Monetary Fund. In 1983 he became premier for a second time after his party's qualified success in the April general election and its establishment of a coalition with the Social Democrats. He successfully negotiated Portugal's entry into the European Communities. In 1985 the PS was decisively defeated in elections and he was succeeded as prime minister by the right-wing Aníbal Cavaco Silva. But just three months later Soares was elected president, winning 51.3% of the votes despite the formidable challenge posed by the popular conservative Diogo Freitas do Amaral. He became the first civilian head of state in 60 years. Within days of being elected he renounced his leadership of the PS and emphasized that he would be a leader of all people, regardless of their political views. He was reelected in 1991 but was constitutionally barred from seeking a third consecutive term in 1996. In 2006 he ran again, but was unsuccessful.\n\nR.F.

Aug. 10, 1937, Leningrad, Russian S.F.S.R. [now St. Petersburg, Russia] - d. Feb. 20, 2000, Svetlogorsk, Kaliningrad oblast, Russia), mayor of St. Petersburg (1991-96). He did not join the Communist Party until 1988 and left it two years later. He rose to national prominence during the sessions of the U.S.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies and U.S.S.R. Supreme Soviet in the spring of 1989. He headed the commission looking into the deaths of 20 demonstrators at Tbilisi, Georgia, in April 1989 and severely censured the Communist Party and the military. Now, next to Boris Yeltsin, he was the most influential Russian politician. He became chairman of the Leningrad city soviet on May 23, 1990, and was elected as the city's first mayor on June 12, 1991, winning 66% of the vote. The Soviet coup of Aug. 19, 1991, found Sobchak in Moscow consulting with Russian President Yeltsin. Helped by elements of the KGB, he flew back to Leningrad, met with the military commander Lt.Gen. Viktor Samsonov, and dissuaded him from bringing troops into the city. On Nov. 7, 1991, the anniversary of the October Revolution, he organized a countercelebration - the official renaming of Leningrad as St. Petersburg, following a city referendum in September. Vladimir Putin became Sobchak's top aide and deputy mayor; he was seen as firmly entrenched in the reform camp under Sobchak's tutelage. Sobchak lost office in 1996 and was investigated for allegedly arranging to have his apartment upgraded and for accepting another apartment as a gift while he was mayor; a real estate company allegedly received benefits from city authorities in return. He went to France in November 1997 and returned to Russia only in the summer of 1999, when Putin became Russian prime minister.\n\nSobchak, Kseniya (Anatolyevna) (b.

July 22, 1899, Zombodze, Swaziland [now Eswatini] - d. Aug. 21, 1982, Lobzilla Palace, near Mbabane, Swaziland), paramount chief (1921-68) and king (1968-82) of Swaziland. His father, Ngwane V, died when Sobhuza was an infant, and his grandmother ruled as queen regent during his minority, while he was being educated at the Swazi National School at Zombodze and at the famous missionary-run Lovedale Institute in Cape province, South Africa. He was installed as paramount chief of the Swazi in 1921. He led his country (which had become a British protectorate in 1902) gently into the 20th century while never forsaking, but rather encouraging, the ancient tribal customs that bound his people tightly together as a cohesive nation. Bit by bit, and with long battles in the British courts, he regained for his people many of the lands that had been handed out to foreigners. Swaziland achieved full independence in September 1968 as a constitutional monarchy. In April 1973, however, Sobhuza repealed the constitution, dissolved the legislature, disbanded all political parties, and assumed supreme power to rule. A new constitution proclaimed in 1978 provided for a merely consultative parliament (Libandla). Opposition to his rule was small. With probably more than 100 wives and hundreds of children, he tied all important families to his own Dlamini clan, constituting about one-quarter of the population. His lifestyle reflected a synthesis of the old and the new African; on formal state occasions he appeared in top hat and full dress, but on most other occasions he wore his traditional regalia of scarlet silk loincloth and feathers. He maintained strong Western ties and refused to allow Swaziland to be used as a base for guerrilla attacks against South Africa.\n\nSobisch\n\nSobisch (Velázquez), Jorge (Omar) (b.

Ordained priest in 1950, he held assignments in the apostolic nunciatures in Ecuador (1961-63), Uruguay (1963-65), and Chile (1965-67). After another ten years in Rome at the Secretariat of State, he was apostolic nuncio to Chile (1977-88). Under his influence, a string of steadily conservative bishops were appointed in Chile. In the run-up to a key plebiscite in 1988, Sodano appeared at a televised gathering of supporters of dictator Augusto Pinochet. He became a cardinal in 1991. While secretary of state, Sodano, as an opponent of liberation theology, was sent to preside over a meeting of the Latin American bishops' conference (CELAM) in Santo Domingo in 1992. Conflicts between Sodano and some of the progressive bishops within CELAM became so fierce that at one point Sodano locked himself into his hotel room and declared his intention of returning to Rome immediately; he was persuaded to stay only by notes pushed under his door. Since 2005 he is the dean of the College of Cardinals. Sodano has a long history of protecting the interests of the church as an institution, being accused of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse scandals. In particular, he blocked an investigation into Hans Hermann Cardinal Groër, archbishop of Vienna, who was found guilty of sexually abusing children in 1998.

He was replaced by Cleopa David Msuya, but in 1983 Sokoine was recalled to take over from Msuya, reportedly because the country was on the verge of economic collapse. Sokoine instituted a campaign against black marketeering that led to widespread arrests. He was the heir apparent of Pres. Julius Nyerere, who had indicated that he would retire in 1985, but he died in an automobile accident after attending a parliamentary session in Dodoma.\n\nSokol\n\nA. Sokolov\n\nSokol, Sergey (Mikhailovich) (b.

Aug. 15 [Aug. 3, O.S.], 1888, Romny, Poltava province, Russia [now in Ukraine] - d. [killed in prison] May 21, 1939), people's commissar of finance of the Russian S.F.S.R. (1922-23) and the U.S.S.R. (1923-26). He was also ambassador to the United Kingdom (1929-32).\n\nSokolov, Aleksandr (Valentinovich) (b.

He was people's commissar/minister of construction and road machine building (1946-49) and urban construction (1949) and chairman of the State Committee for Construction (1950-55) of the U.S.S.R. and a deputy premier of the Russian S.F.S.R. (1955-58).\n\nSokolov, Lazar (b. March 18, 1914, Kumanovo, Serbia [now in North Macedonia] - d. 1984, Skopje, Macedonia [now North Macedonia]), president of the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia (1945).\n\nSokolov, Leonid (Ivanovich) (b. 1907 - d. 1988), Soviet politician. He was chairman of the executive committee of Novosibirsk oblast (1946-49) and ambassador to North Vietnam (1958-61).\n\nSokolov, Sergey (Leonidovich) (b. July 1, 1911, Yevpatoriya, Crimea, Russia [now in Ukraine] - d. Aug. 31, 2012, Moscow, Russia), Soviet defense minister (1984-87). He joined the army in 1932. Two years later he became a member of the tank corps in the Far East, and in 1937 he joined the Communist Party. During a 50-year military career he served in the Far East as commander of a special battalion of tank troops and in Europe as chief commander of the tank and mechanized troops of the 32nd Army. He survived Iosif Stalin's purges of the Red Army and steadily rose through the military ranks; his specialized training in tanks and mechanized armour at military academies was regarded as an attractive asset to his career. In 1960 he was named chief of the Moscow military district, and four years later he was made first deputy commander of the Leningrad military district. In 1965 he was made commander of the district, with the rank of colonel. As longtime deputy minister of defense (1967-84) he made at least 23 trips abroad, presumably to sell Soviet arms to the third world, and from 1979 he was believed to have overseen the Soviet offensive in Afghanistan. He was made a marshal of the Soviet Union in 1978. After a flurry of mistaken speculation that Grigory Romanov would succeed Marshal Dmitry Ustinov as defense minister, Sokolov was named to that post on Dec. 22, 1984. He was viewed as a tractable personality who would not disturb the delicate balance within the party leadership. His appointment also restored the tradition of naming a military man to the post, a custom that was broken in 1976 when Ustinov was appointed defense minister. Sokolov was dismissed in 1987 after he failed to prevent Mathias Rust, a 19-year-old West German, from landing in Red Square in his Cessna 172 light aircraft.\n\nSokolov, Yefrem (Yevseyevich) (b.

Throughout the 1990s, he was considered one of Slobodan Milosevic's closest associates. When Milosevic's government and power pyramid crumbled in October 2000, Sokolovic fell out of the public's eye. Police said he \"most likely committed suicide with a pistol.\"\n\nSokomanu, Ati George, original name (until 1980) George Kalkoa (b.

Solana\n\nSolana Madariaga, Javier (b. July 14, 1942, Madrid, Spain), Spanish politician. He joined the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party in 1964, when it was an underground operation during the rule of fascist dictator Francisco Franco. He became a member of parliament in 1977, two years after Franco's death. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, he and other Socialist leaders marched against U.S. military bases in Spain and, when Spain joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1982, called for a referendum to reverse that move. Later that year, the Socialists came to power and he was appointed minister for culture. In 1985 he took over the additional post of government spokesman. The Socialists' position on NATO changed completely, and he supported endorsement of Spain's membership in a referendum held in 1986. He became minister for education and science in 1988 and foreign minister in 1992. In 1995, after the resignation of NATO Secretary-General Willy Claes, Solana became a compromise choice for the post. The former vocal opponent of NATO said his early attitudes were influenced by his student years in the U.S. during the Vietnam War and the civil rights movement. He took over at the time that NATO led 60,000 troops into Bosnia to implement the Dayton peace agreement. He saw NATO through its first enlargement since 1982, admitting Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in March 1999. The same month NATO began a bombing campaign against Serbia, and he was lauded for maintaining a consensus in the North Atlantic Council as to the conduct of the campaign. In October 1999 he began his new job as the European Union's first High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, in addition becoming secretary-general of the Western European Union in November; he held both posts until 2009.\n\nSolana Morales, Fernando (b.

In November 1943 his government amended the constitution to remove the legal right of the French to administer Lebanon under a League of Nations mandate. Solh and his cabinet were arrested by French forces.
