Additional competitors: Carlo Pintacuda and Attilio Marinoni both in Scuderia Ferrari entered Alfa Romeo 8C 2900A, Helle-Nice in an Alfa Romeo Monza. De Teffe's Alfa Romeo was a 2.3 Monza. Pintacuda retired on lap 1 with unspecified transmission problems, Marinoni on lap 21 with a failed differential.\n\n1940. There WAS a race in 1940. I know very little about it other than that it was won by Rubens Abrunhosa. My guess is that the race title was \"III Circuito da Gavea Nacional\". Chico, please try to add some substance to this elusive race.\n\n1947. Among my various souces I have two versions of the results, either 4. Helio Ramos (as you have it) or 4. Bianco, 5. Abrunhosa, 6. Ramos. The first three positions are the same in all sources. Additional car details, Gino Bianco Maserati 8CM, Rubens Abrunhosa Studebaker and Helio Ramos Alfa Romeo 2.9sc (or was it a Maserati as you say?).\n\n1952 20 January. Chico Landi's time. I have seen two versions, 2:27'38.4\" and 2:27'37.1\" One second in two and a half hours hardly matters now, but I wish I knew which is correct. Bonetto retired with engine problems and Goes with a broken piston. Additional starters: Joao Soafido Alfa Romeo 3.2 sc, Benedito Lopes Maserati 1.5 sc, Gino Bianco Maserati 1.5 sc and Mario Valentim Maserati 2.0 usc. These four drivers retired with magneto, fuel pump, rear brake and rear wheel problems respectively."
