        "text": "At 16, José Mauricio composed the first work that came to our days: the antiphon Tota pulchra Es Maria (CPM 1) in 1783, dedicated to the Cathedral and See.\n\nDuring the decade of 1780, he studied the necessary disciplines to the examinations he had to go through to be ordinated a priest, and began a collaboration with the old chapel master of the See, deacon Lopes Ferreira. This would be the first step to his final goal, to be Lopes Ferreiraï¿½s successor as the Seeï¿½s chapel master.\n\nIn 1784, a group of musicians founded in Rio de Janeiro the brotherhood of Santa Cecília, whose objective was to regulate their professional life. José Mauricio signed the foundation act as a music teacher.\n\nAt this time he composed the following works: Litany for Our Lady in 4 voices and organ, in 1788, the anthems O Redemptor Summe Carmen and Pange Lingua, in 1789, and the works a capella \"for all the Holy Week of the See\" (Bradados), from those the most important is Bradados de 6ï¿½ feira maior (CPM 219), for Holy Friday, which includes the motets Crux Fidelis (CPM 205), Heu Domine (CPM 211), Popule Meus (CPM 222), Sepulto Domino (CPM 223), and Vexilla Regis (CPM 225).\n\nIn 1790 he composed an instrumental work that made him famous in Rio de Janeiro: the Funeral Symphony (CPM 230).\n\nHe requested his ordination in 1791. The ecclesiastic career would join his religious education and his musical art, and compensate his low origin as well.\n\nTwo requisites to be ordinated were: to prove the true Catholic faith from himself and from his parents, and to be free from \"any colour defect\". The first had been proved through research and witnessing from his parents' and grandmothers' friends on their faith. To overcome the second obstacle, he requested from the bishop to be dismissed from his \"defect\", in which he was successful.\n\nIn June, 1791, he began the necessary examinations.\n\nIn March, 1792, he was ordinated. The last requirement, to own any asset, was gone through with the help of one of his student's father, Thomaz Gonçalves, who donated him a house at Rua das Bellas Noutes."
