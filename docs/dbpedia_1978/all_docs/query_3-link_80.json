        "text": "Letter from the President\n\nEvery two years, the Ciccillo Matarazzo Pavilion becomes a stage for the most relevant works and themes in the art world at the time. Visitors walking among the paintings, sculptures, drawings, research, installations, and so many other languages in constant transformation, and realized by artists from the most diverse settings, can imagine the effort that goes into each part of the exhibition. The task of orchestrating a show on the scale of the Bienal de São Paulo, and with the degree of excellence that it demands, is only possible thanks to the collective work of professionals from the most varied specializations.\n\nEverything begins with the choice of a curatorial proposal, which is always new, always innovative. From that moment, the preparations begin, only ending when the exhibition closes. The endless meetings and difficult decisions, messages exchanged and contracts needing signing, schedules and their multiple revisions, budget and fundraising, and strengthening ties with public authorities and private initiatives in a network of sponsors, supporters, and partnerships. Everything needs to be negotiated with transparency and designed in a way that respects the conservation of the pavilion itself — a jewel of modern architecture — as well as the environment, according to the institutional guidelines that include mitigating the event’s carbon footprint.\n\nThe production team transforms the abstract into concrete: building bridges between the collections, working alongside suppliers of the most varied trades, arranging transport, dealing with programming, and creating the conditions necessary for the works to be included in the exhibition with the utmost care, safety, and creativity. The education team offers formation courses for educators, sets up outreach programs in schools and research centers, produces educational publications, their tools of the trade, and mediates the relationship between the works and visitors interested in creating new connections between their experiences and the art exhibited in the show. The communication team, in turn, delivers news and announces the exhibition contents to a captive and demanding Bienal public while simultaneously inviting people who have never had the chance to see the exhibition up close. It is also down to them to coordinate publications, signpost the space, and tie together texts and images. In keeping with the financial and administrative health of the event, together, these teams provide the environment needed to host the Bienal.\n\nThe installations happen with tight deadlines, and each step in this phase must be studied and measured beforehand. First, the walls are erected and the architecture starts to take shape. The pavilion is overtaken by construction workers, wood, plaster, and iron. Once the building has been prepared, it is time to welcome the artworks and the boxes they are packaged in, which are unpacked so the installers can mount the works with care and precision. In an ocean of details and finishings, the text panels are mounted, the lights turn on, visitor guides take their places, and another Bienal opens its doors.\n\nFor the 35th Bienal de São Paulo, the curatorial collective formed of Diane Lima, Grada Kilomba, Hélio Menezes, and Manuel Borja-Villel, selected over a hundred participants who, in incalculable ways, choreographed the impossible. The Fundação Bienal de São Paulo is proud to hold this exhibition and, in its own way, to play a part in this impossible choreography, orchestrated by collective work.\n\nJosé Olympio da Veiga Pereira\n\nPresident – Fundação Bienal de São Paulo\n\nThe setting for the choreographies of the impossible:\n\narchitectural design\n\nFor the development of the architectural design of the 35th Bienal de São Paulo, the renowned team at Vão was invited. Vão is known for its innovative and award-winning approach in the field of architecture. The firm’s partners Anna Juni, Enk te Winkel, and Gustavo Delonero are highly regarded for their ability to create spaces that provoke interaction and reflection.\n\nFor the design of the 35th Bienal de São Paulo, Vão proposes an innovative look at the choreography of the Ciccillo Matarazzo Pavilion, exploring the relationship between the exhibition space and the visitor’s experience. The group took on the challenge of facing the modernist conceptual and structural conventions of the building itself, in order to create a different flow of movement in the relationship between artworks and people.\n\nThe architectural design developed by Vão promises to offer a new experience for visitors to the traditional Ciccillo Matarazzo Pavilion at the 35th Bienal de São Paulo, inviting the public to explore the space in a new way: the central opening of the Bienal Pavilion will be closed for the first time.\n\nFor the architects, the proposal goes beyond a new look at the iconic Pavilion: “From the very beginning, we sought a design that would place itself between the desire not to re-enact the existing spatial choreography and, at the same time, not to impose a different choreography, totally disconnected from its internal logics. To this end, we would have to dance with the existing and with the available. That is, in addition to the attention given to reusing materials left over from the old exhibitions, we aimed to create spaces from the constructive elements that constitute the Pavilion.”\n\nLetters from our partners\n\nSharing the historic mission of the Ministry of Culture of the Federal Government to promote the growth of the cultural field and make it more accessible, in addition to fostering the creative economy, the Bienal de São Paulo now reaches its 35th edition with yet another innovative curatorial project in tune with the most urgent issues of our time. This is a milestone in the history of this event, whose goal has always been to welcome a wide audience and showcase the latest in the art world, while promoting sustainability and human rights, which are essential for strengthening an increasing civic culture.\n\nSince its first edition in 1951, the Bienal de São Paulo has occupied a prestigious place in national culture that goes far beyond its exhibitions. Its consistent continuity over the years has been responsible for forming and training cultural workers in the most varied fields, such as educators, art critics, assemblers, architects, producers, editors, communicators, designers and many other trades, with each project directly and indirectly impacting an extraordinary number of individuals, families and lives.\n\nAmong the impacts of the exhibition, it is important to highlight the impeccable educational activity of the Bienal. Each of its editions creates the necessary conditions to reach new audiences and foster the critical knowledge of new visitors of all ages. With a permanent education team, the Fundação Bienal de São Paulo develops free courses, mediation activities and formation programs for educators and mediators, in addition to producing educational publications, essential working tools for artistic-pedagogical projects.\n\nIn the colorful and multiple framework of the Bienal de São Paulo, opportunities are created to learn more about ourselves, appreciate the diversity of the world and celebrate culture. For the Federal Government, represented here by the Ministry of Culture, there is no national unity without art, and no art without democracy. Let’s celebrate another Bienal de São Paulo. Long live art!\n\nMargareth Menezes\n\nMinister of Culture of Brazil\n\n___\n\nIn its 35-year history, Itaú Cultural (IC) has played a fundamental role in supporting art and culture in its most diverse languages and manifestations. This is achieved through research, content production, mapping, incentives, and dissemination, but also through partnerships with agents who are aligned with our values, such as the Fundação Bienal de São Paulo.\n\nSupport for the Bienal de São Paulo – an important space of encounter and exchange between artists, curators, critics, and the public – reaffirms IC’s commitment to promoting the visual arts and their transformative role. Within this area, the organization is coordinating various actions, both physical and virtual exhibitions, as well as educational activities.\n\nAmong recent exhibitions, Um século de agora [A Century From Now] presented an overview of art and culture currently produced in Brazil, jointly curated by Júlia Rebouças, Luciara Ribeiro, and Naine Terena. Urban art also had its space, with Além das ruas: histórias do graffiti [Beyond the Streets: Graffiti Stories], running until the end of July. On itaucultural.org.br, the public can find the virtual exhibitions Filmes e vídeos de artistas [Films and Videos by Artists], which features audiovisual works of an experimental nature, and Livros de Artista na Coleção Itaú Cultural [Artist Books in the Itaú Cultural Collection], whose immersive and interactive resources allow for a detailed appreciation.\n\nIn the area of education, the Entreolhares program offers courses and workshops aimed at developing those who will work professionally in the field of the visual arts. These and other courses are available at Escola Itaú Cultural. The Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural is an important tool for sharing knowledge, offering access to entries on characters, works, and events in the visual arts.\n\nItaú Cultural\n\n___\n\nInstituto Cultural Vale is delighted to be a part of the 35th Bienal de São Paulo – choreographies of the impossible, and its educational program, which is exploring new formats and approaches this year.\n\nGiven the curatorial proposal to create a “space for experimentation, open to the dances of the unimaginable”, as defined by the curators, we have joined this initiative that connects art and education, expands access to culture and brings students, teachers and families closer to interdisciplinary experiences.\n\nWith a joint, horizontal and diverse curatorship, the Bienal – the largest contemporary art exhibition in the Southern Hemisphere – invites us to think of art as an exercise in dialogue, as an opening to new narratives and as a space for learning.\n\nIt is, in this regard, also connected to the purpose of the Instituto Cultural Vale: to expand opportunities for learning, reflecting, developing new visions and sharing art, culture and education inside and outside museums throughout Brazil.\n\nInstituto Cultural Vale\n\n___\n\nBloomberg is proud to sponsor choreographies of the impossible, the 35th edition of the Bienal de São Paulo. For more than a decade we have supported the Bienal’s exceptional contemporary art exhibitions in the stunning Ciccillo Matarazzo Pavilion in Ibirapuera Park and around Brazil, through our partnership with Fundação Bienal. This year’s edition continues the tradition of presenting captivating and thought-provoking art installations that are free and open to the public.\n\nEvery day, Bloomberg connects influential decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people, and ideas. With more than 19,000 employees in 176 offices, Bloomberg delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world. Our dedication to innovation and new ideas extends to our longstanding support of arts, which we believe are a valuable way to engage citizens and strengthen communities. Through our funding, we help increase access to culture and empower artists and cultural organizations to reach broader audiences.\n\nBloomberg\n\n___\n\nConfronted with the incessant problems of humanity, perhaps it is worth dwelling a little longer on some open questions, taking sustenance from resources that allow us to dig and build answers procedurally. In this sense, art, in its many guises, offers fertile ground for critical elaborations about the world and ourselves.\n\nThe meeting of art and education – both understood as fields of knowledge – enables the torsion of time and space: it becomes possible, thus, to suspend neutralities and dilate what is precipitated in structures. How far is this approach able to infer the real and interfere in it? It allows us to (re)populate imaginaries, to unpick the universalizing statute attributed to concepts, practices and people, and thus to carve out reality with narratives that articulate the individual and the collective, in a procedural and coherent manner regarding the issues that permeate existence.\n\nIt is according to this panorama that Sesc São Paulo and the Fundação Bienal, through the 35th Bienal de São Paulo, reiterate their long-standing partnership, a mutual commitment to fostering experiences of coexistence with the visual arts, expanding access to cultural actions and the exercise of otherness.\n\nThis partnership, which has been established and renewed for over a decade, has led to the promotion of projects such as simultaneous exhibitions, public meetings, seminars and training for educators, as well as the consolidated itinerant exhibition with excerpts from the Bienal in Sesc units in the wider state of São Paulo. The confluence of choices and propositions is part of the institutional perspective of culture as a right, and conceives, together with one of the largest exhibitions in the country, an accessible horizon for contemporary art in Brazil.\n\nSesc São Paulo"
