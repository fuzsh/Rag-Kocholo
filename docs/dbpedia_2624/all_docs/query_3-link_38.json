It’s supposed to open max 5 synths but currently it’s broken after tapping a few times\n\nSource is here (it uses choo and p5js)\n\nSound part is adapted from my previous project. I wrapped web audio API to make it \"patchable”.\n\nObviously there are many genious people who made something similar before, so I added some of them as reference in the page Nevertheless, making your own adaptation is quite fun and there’s always learning.\n\nAnd shout out to Klanginseln Großharthau for the opportunity for making this happen"
