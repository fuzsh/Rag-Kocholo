In this article, we utilize Black feminist epistemologies to serve as critical frameworks for understanding the historical context that reveals the interconnected systems of power that mutually influence one another to create unequal outcomes or social inequalities for different populations. Leveraging Black feminist thought (BFT) and intersectionality as critical social theories of design praxis, we introduce intersectional analysis of power—a method that enables HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners to identify and situate saturated sites of violence in a historical context and to transform the ways in which they engage with populations that have been historically oppressed. Engaging in self-reflection as researchers, we apply an intersectional analysis of power to co-design technologies with community street outreach workers who address violence in their predominantly Black communities. We: (1) identify the saturated site of violence; (2) identify the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describe the “conceptual glue” that binds these intersecting systems together and the assumption(s) that those who hold power are employing to guide their interactions; (4) examine the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate to “normative” ways of being and behaving; and (5) identify acts of resistance. This article contributes an alternative to traditional HCI and design methods that falsely perpetuate a lens of neutrality and colorblindness that centers on whiteness, innovation, and capitalism and ignores the history of State-sanctioned violence and structural oppression.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nEven within the women’s movement, we have had to fight, and still do, for that very visibility which also renders us most vulnerable, our Blackness. For to survive in the mouth of this dragon we call America, we have had to learn this first and most vital lesson—that we were never meant to survive. Not as human beings...Black or not. [100, p. 42]\n\nFor centuries, Black women have been at the forefront of pursuing social justice for Black people, women, and other historically excluded populations [28, 33, 39] with dismal recognition or support for their endeavors from others. Black women’s intersectional experiences of race, gender, and class combined with their unique history of being enslaved in the United States have positioned them as “outsiders-within” a hostile society that devalues them as being subhuman [28]. Despite constantly contending with systematic oppression in the form of racism, sexism, and heteropatriarchy, Black women engage in acts of resistance against social inequalities that sometimes give way to more inclusive and equitable living conditions that benefit those who have suffered oppression, violence, and the accompanying trauma at the hands of those who are empowered and privileged [28, 29]. For example, we see evidence of Black women’s activism in the Black Lives Matter (BLM) Movement, petitioning for the human rights of all Black people regardless of race, gender, class, sexual orientation, and so on, or the results of Black women’s tireless efforts in getting out the vote in the 2020 presidential election, contributing to the election of Joseph R. Biden as the 46th president of the United States [19]. One thing remains clear: Black women, refusing to be relegated to the outer fringes of society, remain a force to be reckoned with.\n\nTurning our attention to more scholarly pursuits, Black women, along with other historically excluded populations, have invoked protests and the need for social change within academia, specifically the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)/Computer Human-Interaction (CHI) communities and the field of computing, more broadly [21, 69, 70, 121]. With an increase in HCI scholarship that focuses on historically excluded populations, recent calls advocate for HCI methods that more adequately acknowledge and address the historical context of racism [109, 146, 147], sexism [7, 9, 49, 77], gendered racism [119, 122], epistemic violence [53], classism [79, 80], ableism [76, 104], and other forms of oppression [46, 95]. Created with a false lens of neutrality and colorblindness, most HCI and design methods render the harm caused by systems of oppression as invisible, ignoring the history of policies and practices that catalyze and perpetuate cumulative and continued discrimination [32, 78]. Black women, for example, have and continue to face gendered racism both in society and in the fields of HCI and computing as they contend with being erased from the annals of computing history, subjugated to repeated acts of misrecognition, and whose research, when they choose to work within their own communities, is perceived as service rather than scholarship [53, 119, 121, 129, 143]. With the exception of recent work [2, 32, 44, 68, 98], HCI methods tend to center on whiteness, innovation, and capitalism, while ignoring the history of State-sanctioned violence and structural oppression, contributing to Black women’s invisibility in HCI [53, 118]. Despite calls to use critical approaches such as feminist HCI [7, 8, 10, 108] and intersectional feminism [57, 90] to understand the historical harms of gender, race, and class [26, 56, 156], there has not been a concerted effort to dissect systems of power or to include epistemologies that center Black women, rendering feminist HCI and intersectional feminism devoid of Black women’s voices and lived experiences. Given the absence of Black women’s perspectives, both feminist HCI and intersectional feminism run the risk of reifying white women and white supremacy while being ill-equipped to resist the anti-Black racism that Black women experience [53, 119]. Ways of understanding the intersecting systems that have managed, wielded, and maintained power and oppression have yet to be integrated into HCI methods.\n\nIn this article, we utilize Black feminist epistemologies, or Black women’s ways of knowing, to serve as critical frameworks for understanding the historical context that reveals the interconnected systems of power that mutually influence one another to create unequal outcomes or social inequalities for different populations. More specifically, we apply Black feminist thought (BFT) and intersectionality as two critical social theories for engaging in community-based research that intentionally centers on the histories and lived experiences of Black people. BFT positions Black women as experts or intellectuals of their lived experiences, contributing to a collective standpoint that chronicles the historical legacy of Black women in the United States [13, 28, 29, 30, 36, 100]. Intersectionality, defined as “a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences,” [30] becomes necessary when seeking to understand how systems of oppression (gendered racism, classism, gender discrimination, etc.) converge to produce interconnected power relations or saturated sites of violence [29]. Such saturated sites of violence inflict harm and trauma on Black people and their communities [103, 120, 143].\n\nBuilding upon prior work which introduced autoethnography as a legitimate method for capturing firsthand personal experiences of past events [53], the primary contribution of this article is a new methodology—an intersectional analysis of power—for enabling HCI researchers and practitioners to identify and situate saturated sites of violence in a historical context. Leveraging Black feminist epistemologies as critical frameworks for design, we conduct an intersectional analysis of the power of a case study—a project where the first author (and her research team) co-designed a mobile application with community street outreach workers to support their efforts in addressing violence in their predominantly Black communities [43, 51]. Based on an autoethnography of the first author’s lived experience as the lead researcher and designer of the project, we examine the role that history plays in maintaining power and oppression throughout the design process of the mobile application. We describe the five-step intersectional analysis of power technique where we: (1) examine history to identify the saturated sites of violence; (2) identify the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describe the conceptual glue that binds these intersecting systems together to reveal the narratives that those who hold power employ to guide and justify their actions; (4) examine the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate to “normative” ways of being and behaving; and (5) identify acts of resistance, specifically how marginalized people exercise their agency to resist oppression.\n\nThis article makes several significant contributions. First, by critically examining the history and the intersecting systems of power using an intersectional lens, we provide insight into how intersectionality can be applied to the field of HCI as a method for both reflection and action to improve the process of technology design. As such, this article applies the theory of intersectionality as a mechanism for critical analysis using a real-world example, providing much-needed vocabulary, tools, and a step-by-step process that defines the emerging discipline of intersectional computing [52, 90, 102, 119, 122, 127]. Second, leveraging an autoethnographic approach, we use storytelling as a method to center Black women’s experiences and knowledge as valid and valuable to HCI and design, decentering whiteness and rejecting epistemic violence caused by ignoring Black voices. Our use of storytelling as a method of countering testimonial silencing expands critical design studies that celebrate and encourage the voices of those with non-dominant identities in HCI and beyond to share their lived experiences [41, 53, 76, 109, 134, 155]. Expanding feminist HCI research to include Black feminist epistemologies as legitimate critical frameworks for design [7, 8, 14, 14, 26, 91], we theorize on epistemological violence vis-a-vis the testimonial authority of Black women (autoethnography). Lastly, using a historical perspective to scrutinize the entire co-design process of a mobile application, this article both identifies and demonstrates how past and present harm negatively impact Black people and their communities. Subsequently, we identify anti-racist design practices that resist the structural oppression of Black people and other minoritized populations, contributing to the burgeoning body of critical HCI research [2, 32, 47, 68, 78, 79, 98, 141, 155].\n\n2 Black Feminist Epistemologies\n\nBefore we began our deep dive into Black feminist epistemologies, we align our work with the growing research within the CHI and HCI communities that critically examines how we as researchers work with marginalized populations [6, 68, 81, 92, 96, 151]. We are greatly encouraged by the more recent (though scarce) HCI literature that explores the significance of race and the negative impacts of systemic racism in both how we design and use technology [109, 118, 146, 147]. However, unlike many of our respected scholars in the field of HCI, we are Black women who live at the intersections of race and gender. As Black feminists, we are also members of historically excluded populations, the same populations that represent the communities that our research seeks to serve and uplift. Addressing the gap in the HCI literature about activist/social justice research, we intentionally choose Black feminist epistemologies that leverage our social, political, and ideological position as Black feminists. As such, we approach our work within Black communities and with Black people from a personal sense of love, respect, and accountability, which is secondary to pursuing a research agenda or accomplishing research goals [53]. Our aim is to do research that does not inflict more harm and violence on our communities or ourselves [54, 68, 96, 114, 151, 155].\n\nBlack feminist epistemologies center on the lived experiences of Black women as a legitimate body of knowledge that reveals how Black women contend with and resist gendered racism and sexism. Black feminist epistemologies have emerged from diverse Black women’s lived experiences that extend beyond cis Black women [65]. We approach Black women’s ways of knowing as an integration of two perspectives—BFT [28] and intersectionality [29, 30]. We outline the historical implications of applying the lens of BFT and intersectionality to identify and dissect converging systems of power that have a long history of oppression and inflicting trauma and violence on Black people. We conclude this section with the components of an intersectional analysis of power.\n\n2.1 Black Feminist Thought and the Matrix of Domination\n\nPatricia Hill Collins first introduced BFT as a critical social theory that positioned Black women as knowledge agents or experts of their own experiences, navigating a world that devalued them as being inhuman while elevating whiteness as the normative for humanity and white women as the definitive standard of femininity [28]. Rooted in the lived experiences and theorizing of Black women [65], which is in direct contrast to the feminist movement in the United States during the late 1960s and early 1970s, BFT exposed gendered racism, a specific type of racism in which white women were privileged and empowered because of their racial identity while Black women (and other women of color) were subjugated to differential treatment because of their intersecting identities of race and gender [27, 28]. BFT is situated in the rich history of U.S. Black women who were enslaved and suffered abominable offenses such as the sexual manipulation of Black women’s bodies (i.e., rape), the denigration of their physical attributes (i.e., Black natural hair as nappy or unkempt), and false narratives of Black women’s innate submissiveness and promiscuity [11, 12, 29, 100]. U.S. Black women were eventually emancipated from slavery only to be subjugated to new but overt forms of racism and discrimination in the guise of the Jim Crow laws and the reign of terror of white supremacy (e.g., the Ku Klux Klan lynching Black people) in the reconstructed “new south” [28, 29, 59, 107]. Despite these inhumane living conditions across several generations, Black women persevered, managing to eke out an existence by taking advantage of their outsider-within perspective to develop life skills, coping strategies and a political agenda that testified to the fortitude of Black women’s commitment to the sustenance of Black families, their communities and themselves. In essence, BFT is a celebration of Black women’s collective standpoint, which provides an alternative narrative about the legacy of Black women in the United States and their place in society [28, 67]. Positioned as intellectuals rather than objects of study, the diverse population of Black women demonstrates that a collective Black women’s standpoint does not constitute homogeneity of lived experiences, but instead exemplifies the differences in socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, physical abilities, and other attributes are crucial in understanding how Black women create a space for belonging in a world that still questions their humanity and value to society [28]. To apply BFT as a critical lens is to invoke the historical legacy of Black women in the United States and the world.\n\nPower relations underpin the lived experiences of Black women, calling into question who has power, on what basis is the power granted to some while denied to others and why. Using Max Weber’s definition, power is defined as “the chance that an individual in a social relationship can achieve his or her own will even against the resistance of others” [154]. This definition implies that having power can either expand an individual’s or a group’s sense of self-agency regardless of how others try to control that individual or group or reveal the lack of self-agency that serves as a mechanism for prohibiting the progress of an individual or particular population. Power operates within the context of unspoken rules as to which social groups are subjugated to preferential treatment at the expense of non-dominant social groups.\n\nFrom our lived experiences as Black women, power becomes problematic when social relations are constructed in such a way that those who are members of dominant social groups (i.e., white people, cis men, heterosexuals, and non-disabled) enforce the domination of Black women, a less dominant social group, to promote the authority and interests of those who are empowered [154]. In his book Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretive Sociology [154], Max Weber argues that such domination does not require forced obedience or voluntary compliance of those who are oppressed. However, the historical legacy of racism, gender discrimination, and classism in the U.S. bears witness to legislation (i.e., Jim Crow laws) and policies (e.g., adultification bias of Black girls in classrooms) attributed to a complicit government responsible for the enforced obedience and voluntary compliance of U.S. Black women for centuries [27, 39, 59, 100]. When dominance occurs over a substantial amount of time, it creates social structures of oppression, which manifest in various forms of differential treatment and discrimination inflicted on less dominant social groups [28]. For example, the history of slavery in the United States and its ramifications attest to the continued domination of Black women (and girls) regardless of their political affiliations, economic status, sexual orientation, or gender [27]. These discriminatory forms of domination are realized as the subordination of Black women (and other women of color) to white women (gendered racism), the sexual oppression of Black lesbians because of their love for other women (heteropatriarchy), working class Black women who are dismissed an inconsequential (classism), and an intolerance of those Black women who are neurodiverse (ableism). Perceived to be an inferior population, Black women are repeatedly subjugated to differential treatment that denies their humanity. These dominating structures force Black women to comply in order to survive in a world that upholds such domination and simultaneously perpetuates social inequality. Collins refers to this as the matrix of domination:\n\nWhether viewed through the lens of a single system of power, or through that of intersecting oppression, any particular matrix of domination is organized via four interrelated domains of power, namely, the structural, disciplinary, hegemonic [now called cultural] and interpersonal domains. Each serves a particular purpose. The structural domain organizes oppression, whereas the disciplinary domain manages it. The [cultural] domain justifies oppression while the interpersonal domain influences everyday lived experience and the individual consciousness that ensues. [28, p. 276]\n\nBFT deconstructs the matrix of domination to reveal how power operates to induce the structural oppression of Black women. The matrix of domination makes visible how intersecting systems of oppression operate and how the historical implications of these systems have produced present-day social inequities. The intersecting systems of oppression consist of four interrelated domains of power: structural, disciplinary, hegemonic, otherwise known as cultural, and interpersonal [28]. Collins describes the structural domain of power as the organization of power in a society, one that resists change and arguably responds to large-scale social movements (Civil War, women’s suffrage, the Civil Rights movement, etc.) [28]. In comparison, the disciplinary domain of power manages oppression. Bureaucratic organizations control and organize human behavior through routinization, rationalization, and surveillance [154]. By virtue of organizational control, racism and sexism hide under the guise of efficiency, rationality, and equal treatment. For example, Black women scholars criticize the Association of Computing Machinery’s peer review process of article submissions as being one that privileges white scholars who hide behind anonymity to denigrate Black scholars’ research or hold Black scholars to a higher standard while giving white scholars the benefit of the doubt (i.e., shepherding articles) [21, 69]. The disciplinary domain of power draws attention to how certain kinds of knowledge are systematically excluded in the name of science and objectivity [28]. Interactions in the context of everyday life fall under the interpersonal domain of power [28]. Our lived experiences reflect the personal relationships that we maintain and the different interactions we have with people and technology on a daily basis. The interpersonal domain of power involves self-reflection in terms of how a person sees herself as well as how others perceive her. The hegemonic or cultural domain of power formulates synergy that upholds the structural, disciplinary, and interpersonal domains of power because it legitimizes oppression [28]. The hegemonic domain links the structural, disciplinary, and interpersonal domains. Our value system, use of language, our ideas, what moves us, and the ideas we entertain embody our culture, our communities, and our family histories [28]. Black culture is depicted in books, movies, magazines, digital media, the news, and social media [28, 85]. However, history shows that these depictions often convey stereotypical, negative messages that portray Black people as being animals, criminals, unintelligent, and undesirables in society [4, 20, 133]. Using the principle of self-definition, BFT refutes the hegemonic domain of power. In the words of Collins, “Racist and sexist ideologies, if they are disbelieved, lose their impact” [28, p. 284]. Unlike the structural and disciplinary domains of power, the hegemonic and interpersonal domains are subject to individual agency and change. Bringing all four domains together creates a more dynamic system, one in which BFT becomes an ideology for resisting domination and a weapon for social justice.\n\n2.2 Intersectionality as an Impetus for Community Work\n\nMore recently, intersectionality has garnered new attention in the field of HCI. For example, Schlesinger et al. [127] advocate for the field to appreciate the complexity of the identity of users by using the intersecting lens of race, gender, and class. Utilizing intersectionality as a critical framework, scholars acknowledge conflicts that emerge (i.e., the tension between exploitation and allyship) when working with marginalized populations [97] and the need to ethically address these issues as conscientious researchers. However, within the field of HCI, we have witnessed scholars’ tendency to acknowledge Kimberle Crenshaw as the sole founder of intersectionality [84, 127, 156], misrepresenting its origins while erasing the rich historical legacy and contributions of Black women to its inception [119, 122]. Contrary to its ability to inform critical praxis to call out existing inequities in society, intersectionality, in the context of HCI research, has been misappropriated as a watered-down social theory that attends to race and gender (and other social constructs) as being additive measures of identity for women of color with no appreciation for how intersectionality draws attention to mutually influencing systems of power that inflict structural oppression on Black women and other historically excluded groups [22, 29, 30, 144]. Even less HCI research emphasizes how intersectionality can be used as a tool for social justice [53, 119, 120]. Encouraged by recent publications that have identified the need to address racism in the field of HCI [53, 109, 117, 146, 147], we invoke the power of intersectionality to demonstrate the complexity of race, gender, and class as intertwined social constructs that wield substantial power and influence in the lived experiences of Black women and the viability of the communities that they serve.\n\nDating back to the early 19th century when coalitions of Black women, Chicanas, Native American women, Afro-Brazilian women, and other women of color resisted gendered racism [30], intersectionality has been applied as a critical framework for studying indigenous populations in North America, Europe, and the Global South (countries located in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean) [30]. Collins and Bilge [30] define intersectionality as “a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences...conditions of social and political life and the self can seldom be understood as shaped by one factor. They are generally shaped by many factors in diverse and mutually influencing ways” [30, pg. 2]. Intersectionality makes salient the human condition and all its complexity, in particular how different aspects of who we are (race, gender, class, physical ability, sexual orientation, etc.) contribute to our sense of self (Who am I?) and how people relate to us (How do others see me?). One of its guiding premises, intersectionality exposes the inner workings of power relations that create social inequalities for historically excluded populations [29]. These intersecting power relations are indicative of the matrix of domination that constructs, manifests, and enforces distinctive forms of systemic oppression, each with its own power grid and power dynamics [28, 29].\n\nAs cis gender Black women whose intersectional identities expose us to racism, gendered racism, and other forms of discrimination on a daily basis, applying intersectionality (and BFT) as a critical framework in the work that we do represents a natural affinity for resisting oppression. In the context of community activism, an intersectional approach is more than appropriate for empowering the voices of marginalized or historically excluded populations who are often relegated to the outer fringes of society because of systemic oppression (i.e., white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, xenophobia) prevalent in the United States [29, 30, 34, 35]. Vital to its praxis, intersectionality serves the purpose of resisting systems of oppression where “social justice, equality, freedom, and human rights are central rather than peripheral to their critical projects,” [29, p. 290]. Within an intersectional viewpoint, historically oppressed communities are transformed into agents or communities of knowledge, the experts of “their own lives and those of the people who had subordinated them.” [29]. As such, an intersectional analysis of power becomes necessary for identifying overlapping systems of power that mutually influence one another to induce oppression of Black communities.\n\nIntersectionality supports Black women’s political activism as an act of resistance and an exemplar of community work. Black women’s leadership in community work contributes to an oppositional Black culture that protects Black people from attacks of white supremacy, fights for the physical survival and well-being of Black children, upholds Black families and organizations, and seeks to transform social institutions (schools, government agencies, civic organizations, etc.) into places that reject anti-Black racism [29, 85]. In addition, Black women’s community work also involves developing strategies to oppose state-sanctioned murders of Black people at the hands of police. Similar to Ida B. Wells–Barnett’s anti-lynching campaign, which centered on the experiences of Black men, generations of Black women have deep empathy and anger for the unjustified murders of Black men who were fathers, grandfathers, brothers, sons, and uncles and the negative impact of their loss on the Black families and communities who remain under attack [29]. Black feminists, those who are mothers (biologically or relationally) as well as those who are not, are committed to fighting for quality education and job training opportunities so that Black youth can mature into healthy, productive, and economically viable young adults. “In a world that devalues Black lives, to defend the lives of Black youth and aim to give those lives hope is an act of radical resistance,” [29, p. 168]. As such, Black women’s community work represents “reproductive labor” or “motherwork” that invests in the posterity of Black families, children, and Black civil organizations [29].\n\nBlack women’s expertise in recognizing and resisting intersecting forms of domination have well-equipped them to become leaders within the Black community. The BLM movement, a contemporary expression of motherwork fueled by Black feminism, grew into an international movement whose mission is to advocate for the lives and liberty of all Black people [123, 142]. Black women activists often sacrificed their intersectional interests for the greater good of Black communities, choosing to present a united front to the public [28, 29]. Looking back in time to the Civil Rights movement, Black women discreetly questioned Black organizations’ demand for solidarity politics when the male-dominated leadership failed to publicly or privately advocate for the specific needs and interests of Black women [3, 73]. No stranger to compromise, Black women made tough decisions to stand in unity with Black men, not because they blindly followed their leadership, but because they recognized the opportunity to work together as a strategic response to the social problems affecting Black communities, knowing that they could still resist Black men’s domination and gendered racist behavior. Black feminists carved their own paths of resistance, which enabled them to resist heteropatriarchy both within and external to their communities [75]. In essence, intersectionality not only provides a critical lens that examines the complexity, influence, and impact of race, gender, and class on Black women’s lived experiences, but it also illuminates how these lived experiences transform Black women from being victims into socially conscious political activists committed to the survival of Black communities.\n\n2.3 An Intersectional Analysis of Power\n\nWithin the field of HCI, there is a tendency to assume a “here and now” perspective that ignores the historical implications of past events and their consequences for historically excluded populations. However, our lived experiences are largely influenced by what we know about the past [31]. Past events play a significant role in understanding structural oppression, which is predicated on a sustained pattern of dominance that reinforces complex, integrated systems of power over time. Because “intersecting power relations shape individual and group experiences,” [29, p. 49], these experiences are shaped within a historical context that has implications for the human condition. Despite the differences that exist among the heterogeneous population of Black people, they share a collective memory based on the shared history of oppression, including slavery, Jim Crow laws, lynching, voter suppression, and police brutality (just to name a few) in the United States [85]. Black people have a cultivated awareness of the past as an integral part of the present. Converging systems of power along the lines of race, gender and class have produced these systems of oppression, creating social inequalities such as segregated housing [124, 148], inadequate healthcare [58, 139], and insufficient educational resources [93, 110] that negatively impact predominantly Black neighborhoods. By ignoring history, those who have power and privilege tell a different story, one that erases years of social injustice that have shaped the lived experiences of Black people. We see this tendency in the refusal to acknowledge or discuss the consequences of slavery on Black Americans in the United States as a past event that is not relevant to what is happening in the world today, especially since slavery was more than 400 years ago [42, 87].\n\nIntersectionality as a critical praxis requires an appreciation of the historical context in two ways. First, intersectionality requires repeated reflection at the individual level and throughout the course of conducting a resistant knowledge project. Resistant knowledge projects are those that call out the abuse of power that creates structural oppression and challenges the status quo of how things are done in a particular context by engaging those who have been previously oppressed or excluded in acts of resistance. For example, Rankin and Irish [118] create an opportunity for Black women college students to control the design process of a language learning mobile game as an act of resistance to the invisibility of Black women in the gaming subculture. Using playtesting of the mobile game prototype as a probe, Rankin and Irish discover that Black women prefer more nuanced, intersectional game characters that accurately reflect the diversity of native Spanish speakers, including Black people from Africa and the Central American region who are proud of their racial identity, their nationality and their Spanish heritage [118]. Second, intersectionality reveals what Patricia Hill Collins refers to as saturated sites of interconnected systems of power that converge in epistemic violence and reveal the inner workings of power within and across oppressive systems [29]. Collins states, “treating violence as a saturated site of power relations wherein the workings of power within and across capitalism, colonialism racism, and heteropatriarchy are especially visible provides an entry point into theorizing intersecting systems of power” [29, p. 238]. In order to explore and illuminate both the conceptual and physical spaces and manifestations of violence for Black women in computing, we establish the novel term “saturated sites of violence.” These sites “bundle together practices, social institutions, representations, and patterns of everyday social interaction that appear and reappear across seemingly separate systems of oppression” [29, p. 238]. Often, the workings of power at these sites are hidden and implicit, and those experiencing the violence may lack the language to describe what is happening. Instead, they may describe the outward manifestation of the site through describing a scenario they experienced, and/or they may describe how the scenario made them feel. As such, we can use the testimonies of Black women in Computing as a way to access these sites to peel back the layers and better understand how power is working within and across these intersecting systems.\n\nTherefore, when seeking to uncover and access saturated sites of violence, one should question not only what viewpoints are included, but also which viewpoints are excluded, what ways of knowing are centered and which are left out, as well as why and whether excluded voices and epistemologies should be included. For example, if one wishes to examine the experiences of Black girls in Computing, and Black girls’ direct (not proxy) viewpoint(s) are not included in the design and enactment of the work, one should examine why those viewpoints have been excluded, who or what their exclusion serves, and what challenges to one’s own assumptions about that group and/or about how research is conducted inclusion of Black girls’ viewpoint(s) would present.\n\nTogether these practices, social institutions, and patterns of everyday social interaction are indicative of past and present-day society in which white Americans still reap the benefits of systematic oppression such as higher economic stability, access to quality K-12 education and better healthcare options when compared to Black Americans.\n\n“Solving social problems within a given local, regional, national, or global context requires intersectional analyses,” [29, p. 48]. Additionally, Collins argues that an intersectional analysis must account for and address power relations that generate multiple and co-forming expressions of social inequality, (e.g., economic inequality, racial inequality, gender inequality, sexuality inequality) “as simultaneously particular in their organization and effects, yet universal in their material reality” [29, p. 62]. Acknowledging the lack of consensus among scholars as to what constitutes an intersectional method [72], we push the field of HCI forward by proposing a method for conducting an intersectional analysis of power to effectively dissect power relations that generate social inequalities. Our approach involves a non-linear five-step process:\n\n(1)\n\nIdentify the saturated site(s) of violence;\n\n(2)\n\nIdentify intersecting systems of power and who holds power;\n\n(3)\n\nDescribe the conceptual glue that binds together intersecting systems of power;\n\n(4)\n\nExamine the ways in which less dominant groups are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate;\n\n(5)\n\nIdentify acts of resistance.\n\nThis process leverages and applies Black feminist epistemologies to describe specifically how power plays out in particular contexts as Black girls and women navigate computing spaces. Collins’ scholarship on identifying sites of violence, understanding intersecting oppression and their unique configurations across time and context, as well as her identification of the domains of power are all leveraged across these five steps of the intersectional analysis of power. Intersectionality is used, not only to name the particular intersecting oppression at play within each narrative, but also to interpret the outcomes produced by these unique configurations. White supremacist culture characteristics are leveraged to not only inform the assumptions at work in each of these narratives (i.e., conceptual glue), but also to make more salient how power, through, white supremacy and the centering and normalization of whiteness, create challenges and barriers for Black women in a number of contexts. We put together these ideas from these separate bodies of work to provide a theoretical, analytical, and interpretive framework to describe on a more fine-grained level, how power moves, and how that movement in the soup of white supremacy that always exists in the United States, impacts the experiences of Black girls and women in widely varying computing contexts and spaces.\n\n2.3.1 Identify the Saturated Site(s) of Violence.\n\nThe goal of this step is to identify the saturated site of violence, the type of oppression, and any resulting trauma. Saturated sites of violence benefit dominant social groups who exercise power using different forms of violence to inflict harm and trauma on historically excluded populations. For example, within the field of HCI, Black scholars testify to epistemic violence which serves the purpose of determining whose knowledge is acceptable, culminating in the casual dismissal of Black scholars who choose to conduct community-based research within their communities as service rather than recognized research [53, 119].\n\n2.3.2 Identify the Intersecting Systems of Power and Who Holds Power.\n\nThe goal of this step is to understand the complex intricacies of how power moves within and across oppressive systems, making visible who held power in the past, who currently holds power, and the assumptions or preconceived notions that influence their interactions with less dominant social groups [29]. The intersectional analysis of power also used Okun’s [111] white supremacy characteristics to further inform and illuminate the particular configuration of intersecting oppressions, what Collins refers to as a matrix of domination, across multiple contexts described in the narratives. As an example, the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), a complex governing body created by computing professionals, consists of several special interest groups (SIGs) that serve the specific needs of its constituents. With more than forty chapters that span six continents, the ACM Computer Human-Interaction or ACM SIGCHI, an example of a SIG, is run by volunteers who have a shared interest in developing novel technologies and understanding how technology impacts people and society [130]. As Black women who are members of the ACM SIGCHI community, we notice that no Black people have been elected to leadership roles on the CHI executive committee with the exception of the recent election in 2021 in which a Black woman scholar serves as the Vice President of Communications. On the surface, one might assume that Black people are not interested in serving in a leadership capacity which explains the lack of Black representation. Without additional information, these assumptions appear to be valid. However, using an intersectional lens to understand how structural power operates, we begin to get a different perspective.\n\nIn November 2018, a diverse coalition of CHI volunteers, designated as the ACM SIGCHI Innovators for Diversity and Inclusion, created and administered an IRB-approved survey to gauge diversity and inclusion initiatives as well as marginalization of certain populations among the SIGCHI membership. After receiving more than 100 responses, the ACM SIGCHI leadership blocked the survey, citing conflict of with ACM’s interest, and replaced the initial survey with a “new” SIGCHI diversity and inclusion survey [62].” Rather than inviting the diverse coalition which included three Black people to lead the “new” ACM SIGCHI diversity and inclusion survey, the ACM SIGCHI Innovators for Diversity and Inclusion was dismantled, and their efforts erased and co-opted. In this example, members of marginalized groups despite their qualifications are rarely given the opportunity to lead even though these opportunities are crucial to their success in the academy. As noted by [62], “Institutional racism does not have to be intentional or malicious to disadvantage minority groups. It merely has to occur in a way that harms those who are in the minority who have less power.”\n\n2.3.3 Describe the Conceptual Glue that Binds Together Intersecting Systems of Power.\n\nFor this step, an intersectional analysis examines the “conceptual glue” that joins intersecting systems of power to form a tightly woven and well organized domain of power [29]. The “conceptual glue” includes the assumptions (and perhaps beliefs) that both individuals, organizations, and societies hold about why the world works the way that it does and why the outcomes that result happen the way that they do. To understand how conceptual glue operates, one has to return to an examination of Collins’ domains of power. With the structural and the disciplinary domains of power as the backdrop, the hegemonic (cultural) domain of power establishes and justifies dominant narratives that seek to explain why things are the way they are. These dominant narratives are the stories we tell, often without questioning where those stories came from or even if they are accurate stories, about why things are the way they are. For example, one dominant narrative that justifies the lack of Black representation within the ACM is that Black people are not interested in leadership positions within the ACM, because if they were, they would run for office. If one assumes that story to be true, many nuanced factors that may contribute to that outcome are missed. One such factor that may be missed is how leadership positions are communicated, namely, within the publications of the ACM (Interactions, Communications, etc.). While, on the surface, this appears to be a way to widely communicate opportunities available for leadership, these publications are not included in one’s membership. Instead, they are provided at an additional cost. If a member is unable to afford the additional cost of those publications, she is unable to learn about leadership opportunities, and therefore, she will not run. Even if she did become aware of an opportunity, another such factor is that one has to serve in leadership positions at the SIG level before attempting to run for a leadership position at the ACM level, and this often happens by someone within the SIG inviting a person to serve. This means one must have a strategic plan for serving in leadership positions at the SIG level for a period of time, but first, one must have the relationships and social capital necessary to receive an invitation from the SIG leadership to join their inner circle. If, however, one does not have knowledge of the opportunities that exist because they don’t have access to the publications where those opportunities are communicated nor does one have an invitation to serve at the SIG level and also lacks social capital, relationships, and a strategic plan to play the long game, one can have all of the interest in leadership possible, but still may find herself without a leadership position. However, the narrative assumption that members of her community are not interested in leadership within the organization is actually a false assumption when one questions whether the assumption, or conceptual glue, actually holds true by examining the system within which the assumption is situated and when one examines power (through relationships, social capital, access, etc.) within that system.\n\n2.3.4 Examine the Ways in Which Less Dominant Groups are Subjugated, Surveilled and/or Expected to Assimilate.\n\nThe goal of this step is to analyze how structural oppression operates through practices that subjugate, assimilate, and surveil non-dominant groups. Using the example of facial recognition systems to promote security and limited access, research shows that this technology has been used to surveil Black people, portraying them as thugs and criminals who must be monitored for everyone else’s safety and well-being [15]. In addition, facial recognition systems do a poor job of accurately identifying Black faces, drawing attention to biased algorithms that were not designed to accommodate Black people [23]. Furthermore, more accurate detection of faces of color do not necessarily serve the best interests or needs of Black people [44].\n\n2.3.5 Identify Acts of Resistance.\n\nFor this step, an intersectional analysis of power “sheds light on resistant knowledge projects of anti-violence initiatives” [29]. This coincides with the BFT principle of Black feminist practice of engaging in acts of resistance as a way for improving the lived experiences of Black women and others who have been traumatized by violent power structures [28]. One example of an anti-violence initiative is how Black families and communities create safe spaces to inoculate them from racism and threats from the dominant culture, where the primary focus is on the joys and tribulations of family life and community as essential moments of their lived experiences [85]. The Black family structure with its extended networks and collective memory of contending with and resisting racial oppression represents an act of resistance, laying the foundation for an oppositional culture that has learned how to survive centuries of trauma, violence and damage due to structural oppression in its various forms.\n\n3 Positionality\n\nFollowing the methodology of standpoint theory [67], we describe our own positionality as three Black American, able-bodied, cis-gender women with collectively over four decades of experience working in corporate and academic research. Though the origins of our socioeconomic status ranged from working to middle class, we are currently considered upper-middle class due to our education and economic attainment. Our educational background and work is situated in the field of computing, specifically HCI, design, computing education, and learning sciences. Much of our work has focused on understanding the ways in which technology and computing impacts the lives of Black people, especially Black women and girls, and how to transform technologies, practices, and polices to create a more equitable and just world for those who have historically been ignored. Though we note our own experiences with systems of oppression due to our race, gender, and sometimes class [30], particularly as minoritized members of a field with few that share our identities, we also recognize our privilege as cis-gender, upper-middle class, non-disabled members of academic institutions that have historically caused harm to Black communities. We acknowledge that our positions and identities not only impact our lived experiences as researchers but also the types of research questions that we pursue and our interpretations of the research work, including the importance of understanding systems of power [28, 68]. Furthermore, in reflecting on our identities, we recognize the potential harm that our position may cause, including not reflecting the diverse experiences of Black women (e.g., trans, queer, disabled, and neurodiverse) as well as Black women outside of the West. We believe that people with those identities are best positioned to use their testimonial authority and expertise to provide insights about their lived experiences in computing, not us given our stated positionality. As such, we hope that an additional contribution of this work will be that scholars from those communities will adapt and apply this method in ways that make more salient the unique configurations of the matrices of domination and intersecting oppressions that are contended with while navigating computing spaces. Our hope is that we can continue to expand our understanding of the Black women’s standpoint in computing.\n\nIn this article, we define race as a socially and politically constructed division of humans in which society assigns characteristics to whole groups of people in order to advance the idea of the superiority of whiteness [37]. We use the term “Black” to refer to the people and culture of those from the African diaspora—including those of Black African descent who live and/or are from Africa, the Caribbean, North and South America, Europe, and Asia—as we recognize that anti-Black racism and oppression impact all from African descent despite national origin [30]. Yet, though this article is an autoethnography that leverages the testimonial authority of Black women, we acknowledge that Black women and/or Black people are not a monolith and therefore, we speak from our cis-normative experiences and not for all Black people, who have diverse perspectives and experiences.\n\n4 Methods\n\nWe leverage autoethnography [17, 63] as a method for describing our experience by conducting an intersectional analysis of power, domination, and oppression. Autoethnography allows us the validity and space to describe and reflect on “one’s own experiences” as knowledge, truth, and an illustration of data through testimonial authority [29]. Testimonial authority is the ability and right of those who have been traditionally ignored, disbelieved, and/or dismissed to share their lived experiences as the epistemic agency [29]. “Testimonial authority within a given interpretive community rests on the ability of a person both to speak and to be heard...But it also rests on interactions among listeners who decide the degree to which the testimony put forward fits within the epistemological rules of the community” [29, p. 132]. Autoethnography as a methodology creates counternarratives, which resist disparaging narratives about Black people and communities. Autoethnographic methods and testimonial authority validate research experiences that use intersectional analysis of power as a point of reflection on the study design, methods, implementation, and dissemination. Specifically, the principal investigator (first author) describes her experience and approach to leading a research study with street outreach workers who focus on addressing violence in their communities. We view autoethnography as an appropriate method that aligns with the principles and tenants of BFT and intersectionality as it allows us to (1) engage in self reflection and reflexivity of the current and historical practices that perpetuate systemic oppression, as well as our own privilege as scholars who work within these systems that tend to silence and ignore the epistemic voices of those outside of the traditional academic field (known as testimonial quieting) [48], and (2) describe methods of resistance and activism to combat and counter institutional and systemic oppression [28]. Autoethnography and intersectionality is a method that takes into account the voice of the researcher despite her own minoritized position in the field of HCI, computing, and society.\n\nTo conduct this autoethnography, the first author began by writing about her experience as the lead researcher on the academic team, reflecting on the interactions and decisions made in the study in hindsight (e.g., what went well and what did not). Having extensive experience conducting community-based research over the paper decade, the first author selected this particular experience, because it was a recent example of a body of work that occurred over an extended period of time (years) and that included the full design experience from inception to implementation to deployment. She then engaged her two co-authors in dialogue to share and reflect on her history and experiences, focusing on the themes that emerged in her writing. During the conversation, they asked questions about the themes, asking her to expand on her experiences and rationale for certain decisions. Using a combination of storytelling and written documentation to elicit detailed self-reflection, the first author verbalized her experiences, audio-recorded them, and answered any questions posed by the co-authors. The audio recordings were then transcribed and broken up into five main themes to reflect how she used an intersectional analysis of power as a method to engage in acts of resistance throughout the study. The transcribed narratives (in Section 5) have been lightly edited for clarity and to maintain anonymity.\n\n4.1 Context of the Case Study\n\nIn this section, we provide context for the case study in which we apply the intersectional analysis of power and oppression framework. We provide high-level details of the community-based research project given that this article emphasizes the intersectional analysis of the power of the case study. Additional details about the study and its outcomes are available in previously published work [removed for anonymity].\n\nOver the course of two years, I (first author) worked with Street Peace, a pseudonym of several global street outreach organizations, to build a mobile application (app) that supports community-based violence prevention efforts of street outreach workers. Street outreach work is a community-based approach to lowering rates of interpersonal violence that is preventative rather than punitive (e.g., criminal justice system and law enforcement). Street outreach workers are community residents that have been formerly involved in gangs and who are hired and trained to mediate conflicts in their neighborhoods that could lead to violence. Street outreach workers rely on their relationships and credibility to peacefully intervene in potentially violent situations. Most have case loads similar to social workers, where they stay in touch with those involved in the mediations, including providing resources to address underlying factors that catalyze violence (e.g., lack of employment, mental health challenges, and trauma) [24, 25, 74].\n\nThe study was initiated by one of the administrators of Street Peace, who had more than 15 years of experience in violence prevention work, including being a former street outreach worker before moving into the leadership of the organization. Leveraging aspects of participatory design, the academic team, and Street Peace worked together to co-design, develop, and implement the mobile app. The app was created for internal use by street outreach workers in six neighborhoods across the city1 and had features that supported training, mediation, community building, and communication during emergencies. To understand the impact of the app, we collected data from 36 interviews (pre/post interviews of 18 participants), 56 pre/post surveys, and log data from 48 users. Interviewees were selected from the six different neighborhoods (three from each) based on the time they had been involved in street outreach work and their experience with technology. Though 56 agreed to use the app and installed it on their phones, 48 actively used the app. Three members of the academic team analyzed the data and presented it back to the street outreach workers to get their feedback.\n\n5 Applying an Intersectional Analysis of Power in HCI\n\nIn this section, we describe the five themes that emerged from our autoethnography: (1) project framing, partnerships, and funding, (2) methods, (3) interpretation and data analysis, (4) implementation, and (5) dissemination and outcomes. Leveraging intersectional analysis of power as a method to critically examine the experiences shared, we explore the ways in which systems of power work in academic research. Each subsection begins with the researcher’s reflection and follows with an intersectional analysis of power, where we dive into the histories of oppression and dominations. To enact the power analysis, we engage in the five-step process which consists of (1) identifying the saturated site of violence; (2) identifying the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describing the “conceptual glue” that binds these intersecting systems together and the assumption(s) that those who hold power are employing to guide their interactions; (4) examining the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled and/or expected to assimilate to “normative” ways of being and behaving; and (5) identifying acts of resistance. We note that the researcher’s reflections are examples of acts of resistance rather given that she has approached the co-design process as an activist academic [96] that enacts BFT which focuses on care for communities [28, 96]. We end this section with a final reflection from the researcher, where she describes the oppositional culture and extended care experienced during her interactions with the community as well as some contextualization of those experiences in terms of the intersectional analysis of power.\n\n5.1 Project Framing, Partnerships, and Funding\n\nApproach and problem framing is one of the first things we think about as researchers and designers. To begin and how we started with this project was the organization leaders of a street outreach worker organization came to me and said, “Let’s work together. Let’s collaborate. Here’s some of the issues that we’re seeing. Our job is to think about violence prevention in a way that’s effective and that’s community-led and community-based. And that has positive outcomes for Black and Latinx people.” They initially approached me, because I had experience working with this particular community and engaging in technology design to support community-led approaches to public safety. But even before we started this project, what started this line of work was my own experience of being Black and having negative experiences with the police despite my educational background. One thing that most Black people know and understand is that there is no respectability that exempts you from having negative experiences and interactions with the police, because there is a presumption of guilt as soon as they see you, long before they ever find out “who you are.” These interactions lead to fear and distrust of the police, so when these organizations and I began talking about what’s happening in their communities and why their work is so important, I automatically understood exactly what they meant. I don’t just understand it, I feel it because I’ve experienced being completely and utterly powerless at the hands of the police without having done anything wrong. The concerns are built into my bones cemented by conversations and warnings from my parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents as a young child. Despite not growing up in a major city, I had the same understanding about how the police work and Black criminality in a way that goes beyond reading the literature about the systems that keep violence and crime high in certain areas and the unfair treatment of policing Black bodies in ways that does not help but is detrimental to Black people. I feel and experience that fear on a daily basis.\n\nSo beyond the literature and even my own personal experiences, it is imperative to experience this work firsthand—even prior to understanding the research question. So that meant talking to street outreach workers in their communities, where they gave us tours of the neighborhood. We spent time at their workplaces, with the teams. We talked to them informally before the research began about their experience of engaging in violence prevention work and why they decided to do this type of work in the first place. This is where we really rely on the rich history of storytelling and allowing people to have a voice and to be the experts, not statistics or other types of data that allow us to make assumptions about their lives. Instead, we engaged in storytelling without a research agenda to place their humanity at the center of the interaction and project framing. We spent about six months building these relationships, establishing trust, talking and engaging with the problem, and reimagining Black futures where all of our kids were safe from community and police violence. So during this process, I constantly reflected on who I was, not being from the neighborhoods in which I worked, it was essential that I center their lived experiences, understand and acknowledge the assets and strengths of the community, and shift the power such that their stories, which needed to be heard, led the direction of the project. We didn’t even begin to craft the project without that time. When we began to spend time thinking about the project, we did not take a deficit approach—instead, we focused on the community’s assets, including human assets that are typically disregarded such as those who have been formerly incarcerated. Those are the things that helped us shape the project as an opportunity to amplify existing community assets embedded in current community-led violence prevention efforts. For the students who worked with me, that was a shift from the traditional problem framing that designers engage in.\n\nOne of the main things that we thought about was partnerships and how we’re going to create sustainable and equitable partnerships. The first thing we thought about was who the partners would be, how we will work together, and how we were going to fund the project. These concerns stemmed from the history of who has been involved in the conversation when there are discussions about public safety, alternatives to traditional policing, and violence prevention. Of course, there tends to be other major research institutions who tend to partner with the police in their research. Of course, now many people are exploring alternative public safety methods but as a Black person, it didn’t take headlines of police murders like George Floyd for me to inherently know and recognize problems with relying solely on law enforcement to improve safety. Despite increases in the number of police, crime rates typically go up in certain neighborhoods. Also, I knew about lots of reported an unreported acts of violence and harm caused by the police. I recalled interviews of mothers whose children were harassed by the police—one mother telling me about the time the police took her son and dropped him off in another neighborhood on his way home from the grocery store as punishment for mouthing off, knowing that putting a young 14-year old Black boy in an unfamiliar neighborhood in certain gang territory could be a death sentence. I recalled my own fear for my life as I’ve been harassed by the police and my brother was constantly pulled over to ask why he was in our neighborhood despite his car being registered to the area. Thus, the partnership and who was at the table were important.\n\nAs with most projects, one of the main concerns is funding. Our community partners were also concerned with funding being a non-profit and having limited resources. We worked together to create a one-page document that described the details of the project and its potential impact. It was important that we create that together so that they could source for funding in addition to me as an academic researcher. Traditionally, the funding mechanisms come through the university but we intentionally decided to have some of our grants come to the university, where I was the PI and the non-profit was the subawardee and other grants went directly to the organization where I was the subawardee. That worked out really well, because that meant that the project was very much so intertwined; there was no official “leader,” and there was nothing hanging over anyone’s head, because each organization had a role as far as leading the funding. The major challenge with funding was what you can and what you cannot pay for with the funding and what the organizations, including the philanthropic organizations and funders deemed as evidence of effectiveness and satisfactory progress. For some philanthropic organizations, there was a push for quantitative results (for example, less homicides than the year before), which is not a realistic way of measuring success for this project, because many factors impact violence and an app alone will not stop homicides. This approach also ignores other results that are less quantifiable such as the communities of care that emerged, the relationships built, and the confidence gained. So the funding mechanisms did not align with the results of the work that we needed to do and how we needed to work in partnership. Much of academic funding is tied to the dissemination of our work in academic venues, which does not align with the organizations’ needs. We still had to do these things because the reality is, the funders had the power and in order for us to get the work done, we had to succumb to their will and values. We did engage in acts of resistance in how we structured our funding partnership, and we attempted to raise money outside of traditional funding agencies, but that was minimal in comparison to what we needed.\n\n5.1.1 Identify Saturated Sites of Violence.\n\nThis quote describes several sites of violence. First, the traditional approaches to framing research projects and partnerships are sites of violence. The project framing in this case showcases the notions of Black criminality and deficit narratives that are prominently shared about Black people and their communities, and the role that white supremacy and racism play in creating those narratives as well as concentrated poverty, disinvestment, and high crime rates in Black communities. Other saturated sites of violences are the negative interpersonal interactions with those in power (i.e., law enforcement), which leads to distrust of the police and others who have intentionally and/or unintentionally caused harm. Such negative interactions do not shield Black people and communities from engaging in research partnerships with academics that center the police as partners, not allow community members to have voice in the partnerships, the structure of the partnership (i.e., decision-making processes), and how power moves between partners (e.g., more resourced partners typically have more leverage and hence, more power). Similar to problem framing, violence can occur within the partnership experience as well as outside of (i.e., for those who are not asked to be a voice in partnerships).\n\nFurthermore, mechanisms of funding research are a site of violence, ranging from who can apply for funding (i.e., people and organizations), what information is needed, the resources and relationships that certain organizations have to appeal to funders, the ways in which funding is distributed, and the information needed to receive funding. Funding agencies have complete power and tend to decide on what the outcomes are that need to be demonstrated for a project’s success, not the community. Furthermore, there are some funding agencies who will not consider small community organizations as being qualified to receive funding, putting the community organization (that many times engages in the “on-the-ground” work) vulnerable to larger, more resourced institutions and organizations that have the ability to collect the funding and distribute it as they see fit.\n\n5.1.2 Identify the Intersecting Systems of Power and Who Holds Power.\n\nThe intersecting systems of power at play are racism, sexism, classism, and ability (fitness). The power is held by researchers and funders who have traditionally created rules regarding who are deemed “respectable, good citizens” that are worthy of being listened to, believed, and trusted. Those in power—typically with identities such as white, male, highly educated and well-resourced, and from western societies—maintained and determined who is able to be partners and the partnership structure. These groups have tended to hold power and decisions (whether consciously or unconsciously) regarding the notion of “citizenship,” which has negatively impacted how Black people are treated over the course of history throughout the diaspora. Given the history of the U.S., Black people who are not members of the academy or power institution have traditionally been excluded from being a part of framing and partnership decision-making.\n\nFunding agencies, whether they be government (federal, state, local) or philanthropic foundations and institutions, typically hold the power in terms of who has access to funding resources for research and practice. The intersecting systems of power are still racism, sexism, classism, ability, economics, and nation given that those whose identities are non-dominant have historically not been allowed to apply for and/or receive funding. There are some funding agencies who focus on direct service, again an example of the funding agency determining that the community organization may conduct service, but not knowledge or scholarship that is beneficial to academic institutions. In addition, researchers hold power as well in determining the funding structure of the project. As an example, researchers from predominantly white institutions (PWIs) who “collaborate” with researchers from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) or other Minority-Serving Institution (MSIs) can be problematic when the funding mainly goes through the PWIs rather than through the HBCUs and MSIs [82]. By not allowing researchers from HBCUs and MSIs to have agency and control of the funding, the power to tokenize them in order to access their Black and brown students.\n\n5.1.3 Describe the Conceptual Glue that Binds Together Intersecting Systems of Power.\n\nRecall that the conceptual glue is made up of the assumptions that undergird and support the particular “arrangement of intersecting systems of oppression,” or what Collins calls the “matrix of domination” [29]. Collins also asserts that “just what and how these systems come together is historically and socially specific” [29]. Furthermore, Weber asserts that “when dominance continues for a considerable period of time, it becomes a structured phenomenon, and the forms of dominance become the social structures of society” [154]. As such, the conceptual glue is the result of the crystallization of the matrix of domination over time to the extent that assumptions become “baked in” to the way we engage with systems and these assumptions are used as the (oftimes) unspoken foundational analogs and logics by which narratives to explain structured phenomenon are constructed.\n\nSeveral assumptions undergird the particular configuration of intersecting oppression that this researcher had to contend with when framing the project, establishing partnerships, and securing funding for the research. First, researchers spending long periods of time understanding communities, establishing trust, building rapport, and considering the historical, social, and cultural contexts of communities, especially when those communities are ones that researchers do not belong to, is not common [68, 114]. The lack of initial engagement with communities such that researchers build coalitions with communities is a form of “paternalism” [111], in which “those with power think,” or assume, “that they are capable of making decisions for and in the interests of those without power” (Ibid). This white supremacy characteristic occurs when those with power assume that it is not “important or necessary to understand the viewpoint or experience of those for whom they are making decisions” instead of understanding the experiences of those in the community, building coalition and relationship with that community (and not just a representative of the community), and allowing that expertise and those insights to be the assets that they are that can inform the development of a research agenda. Although the researcher was a member of the larger Black community, she was not a member of that Black neighborhood. As such, hearing the stories of members from the community helped her to establish connection and trust, and it allowed her to center and elevate their lived experiences in their neighborhood and look at the potential problem engaged in coalition building with the community that afforded them being able to shape the direction of the project together and in alignment with each other. That coalition building permeated not only the research agenda, but which partners were brought to bear to engage with (and which were not), as well as how funding was pursued.\n\nSecond, valuing particular ways in which information gets shared (e.g., memos, papers, and project summaries) over other ways in which information gets shared (e.g., storytelling) assumes that the written word is more valuable. This “worship of the written word” is a white supremacy characteristic that assumes that ways of sharing information and knowledge outside of a memo or written document is less valuable [28, 111]. It also assumes that “those with strong documentation and writing skills are more highly valued, even in organizations where ability to relate to others is key to the mission” [111].\n\nThird, resources (e.g., money, space, and team capacity) are often connected to power as those who have resources often leverage those resources to achieve their own will “even against the resistance of others” [154]. This is called “power hoarding,” a white supremacist characteristic that assumes there is “little, if any, value around sharing power” in the form of resources [111]. Often communities are not included in the budgets of grants, outside of participant support, which often takes the form of a stipend, honorarium, or payment that is rendered for the time and/or labor of participants. As a result, they do not have a “say so,” or a role in decision-making around how funds are utilized. The researcher describes the challenges she experiences not only in acquiring funding, but also in distributing funding equitably, assuring that community partners had real access to resources and agency to make decisions about those resources, and attending to appropriate measures of success both of the research as well as the growth and sustainability of the coalition between her team and the community. The assumption that funding organizations, and thus the academy and researchers make that “all of the resources of an organization are directed toward producing measurable goals” and placing more value on “things that can be measured” rather than “things that cannot” is an example of the white supremacy characteristic of “quantity over quality” (Ibid).\n\nFourth, the researcher describes the community organization(s) with which she partners as having little access to funding and very limited time to pursue substantive funding. Funding models often embed a “sense of urgency” within their processes which assumes that a great deal of labor should be expended no matter the amount of funding (large or small). This “sense of urgency” is a white supremacist characteristic that often results in small community organizations promising “too much work for too little money and by funders who expect too much for too little” as well as unrealistic timelines for the work that is going to be done [111].\n\n5.1.4 Examine the Ways in Which Less Dominant Groups are Subjugated, Surveilled, and/or Expected to Assimilate.\n\nIn this case, Black people are subjugated to sites of violence through their experience with the prison industrial complex—which refers to the systems, institutions, and organizations that profit from the rapid expansion of the imprisonment of Black bodies to produce goods and services. The U.S. criminal justice system has been shown to unfairly target Black people, giving longer, inequitable sentences for the same offense as compared to white people [1]. Situated in capitalism, “private business prison labor is like a pot of gold. No strikes. No union organizing. No health benefits, unemployment insurance, or workers’ compensation to pay. No language barriers, as in foreign countries. New leviathan prisons are being built on thousands of eerie acres of factories inside the walls. Prisoners do data entry for Chevron, make telephone reservations for TWA, raise hogs, shovel manure, and make circuit boards, limousines, waterbeds, and lingerie for Victoria’s Secret, all at a fraction of the cost of “free labor” [61]. Interaction with the criminal justice system does not impact one person, it tears apart families and communities for generations [1, 40]. Recent acknowledgements of the unfairness built into the criminal justice system [16, 40, 60] has discouraged incarceration in private prisons but more long-term, at-home surveillance using technologies created by private companies without regulation of who owns the data gathered by these technologies, nor how it will be distributed, protected, or destroyed [89]. Furthermore, Black people are subjected to practices that allow law enforcement to police communities in which they are not members, executing harassment, abuse, and excessive force at higher rates leading to distrust [128]. Black communities are subjected to disinvestment and limited access to city resources, resulting in lack of quality housing, education, and health options, higher crime rates, and physical environments and local infrastructure in disrepair.\n\nTraditional research partnerships where academic collaborators are in control of the money and resources subgates Black communities and people to the will of the researcher. The subjugation is even more evident in cases where the community partners do not have sufficient resources (e.g., many community-based, non-profit organizations face funding challenges) and view research partnerships as a way to supplement the needs of the organization. Such arrangement places the community partners in positions of being subjects to be surveilled, examined and disregarded after the necessary information is collected. There have been recent acknowledgments of problematic approaches and partnerships in HCI research [68, 113, 114]. Pal describes groups that have pushed against the notion of unfair partnerships: “The accessibility community has rallied around the ‘nothing about us without us’ cry, the net impact of which has been a significant presence of people with disabilities in the intellectual output about disability” [113]. Pal goes on to warn that “if we are unable to move toward a more inclusive engagement...it may be time to consider Good4CHI as an apt alternative to describe the directionality of our work’s impact” [113], suggesting a reckoning with the fact that the field of HCI benefits much more from partnerships with non-dominant groups than vice versa.\n\nIn terms of funding, many community organizations that serve Black communities are restricted regarding the avenues of funding in which they are qualified to apply (this is a problem that many nonprofit organizations face). The limitation on where a community organization can seek funding means that community-led efforts result in short term grants that require a significant amount of administrative work. Many of those grants are for direct service and do not cover the cost of the administration needed to create the final reports, white papers, and so on required by funding agencies. Surveillance is manytimes built into the scheduled check-ins with the funding agencies (e.g., quarterly, annual) reports that require that the community demonstrate significant changes that most of the time exceeds what can be done with the amount of funding provided.\n\n5.1.5 Identify Acts of Resistance.\n\nThe researcher engages in acts of resistance by elevating and trusting other modalities of knowledge sharing, where storytelling over simply engaging with statistics was valued. Storytelling allowed the researcher to build relationships and trust with the community partners and street outreach workers prior to the beginning of data collection. The research did not come in with a research agenda, where she was seeking partners to participate in her work (a form of exploitation), but instead she allowed the research approach and framing to develop during her dialogue with community partners. Her approach supports a more asset-based engagement method to working with communities that have traditionally been bombarded with deficit narratives about problems within their communities, ignoring the local solutions and resources that exist. This allows for interactions that are relational rather than transactional. Lastly, the researcher reflected on her personal knowledge and experiences to also guide the conversation—reflecting on the similarities and differences between her experiences and those being shared with her—ultimately connecting more deeply with the community because of her lived experiences. Another act of resistance is the community-led approach to violence prevention in itself as an attempt to counter violence and trauma that results due to traditional policing, where (typically white) law enforcement typically overpolices Black communities.\n\nThe researchers’ approach to consider ways in which the partnerships can be sustainable and equitable from the beginning is an example of an act of resistance. Furthermore, the community had a voice in who engaged in the partnership, the community-led design process, and the structure of the partnership. The researcher leveraged her own experiences as well as her interactions with community residents (e.g., the mother) to decide whether the traditional voices in positions of power would be involved and engaged in the work. Ultimately, the community partners decided against engaging the police in the research—another act of resistance. The researcher’s collaborative approach to selecting and structuring the partnership ensured that the needs of both the community partners and the researcher would be satisfied in the partnership.\n\nThe researcher’s approach to funding—including co-writing the one-page project description, ensuring that the community partners were co-PIs, and distributing funding and responsibilities — were all acts of resistance. By elevating the community partners to lead PIs on some of the funding allowed them to have true voice and for the researcher to be accountable to them rather than the typically arrangement, where the community partner is a subawardee or receives participant funds and the researcher has the final say. Furthermore, this approach not only helps with accountability, but also helps with overhead costs, where the academic institution benefits from the absorbent amounts of indirect cost (e.g., most U.S. institutions take more than 50% of federal grants for overhead costs). This method of truly distributing funding in an equitable way allows the community partners from being exploited since power and money/resources many times coincides.\n\n5.2 Methods\n\nWe thought quite a bit about the methods that we used. For example, we decided to use interviews because of the importance of giving people voice through storytelling, which was something that came up in our initial engagement with street outreach workers. The decision to do both interviews, surveys, and collect data from the app itself was something that the entire team agreed upon with the community partners having an equal voice in the methods. For example, they wanted to use surveys so we could hear from those who we couldn’t interview (it was not possible for us to interview all street outreach workers in Chicago that used the app). In addition to methods they wanted, our partners made it clear which methods were off the table. For example, observations weren’t possible because street outreach workers had a reputation to maintain and bringing researchers down the street with them was not a part of that. Now the funny thing is that I’ve since had article reviewers who have criticized us for not doing observations, which sounds ludicrous but it is true. Essentially, the reviewers didn’t trust the interview data and/or experiences of the workers. What does it say about the establishment in which I publish when there is a distrust of the knowledge from my interviewees because it can’t be valid if the researchers didn’t see it. Of course, it does not make sense for us to say that we’re going to go and observe someone while they’re doing violence prevention work, which is actually a very dangerous job. However, it does say something about the review process, who is believed and whose knowledge is accepted as truth in our field.\n\n5.2.1 Identify Saturated Sites of Violence.\n\nIn this case, the sites of violence are the research and design methods that are not designed to be intersectional, but instead retrofitted [68]. Within these methods, there is an underlying push for innovation that may or may not be appropriate as well as the notion of objectivity. The research methods and instruments were not created or co-designed with the intended population (Black people) at the forefront; therefore, such methods are unlikely to honor their intersectional identities in terms of who is collecting the data, how the data is being collected, who owns the data, how the data is analyzed, and what data is collected (e.g., asking for gender demographics when not needed or not including non-binary and transgender options) [135].\n\n5.2.2 Identify the Intersecting Systems of Power and Who Holds Power.\n\nTraditional research methods were created within systems of power such as racism, sexism classism, ability, and nation. Researchers, and more specifically the academy, hold the power in this scenario, because our fields of study determine the methods that are deemed valid and that yield “reliable truth.” Traditional methods were not created to address intersectional identities and power, but instead were created to focus on a notion of objectivity that does not exist [29, 67, 111]. Traditional methods tend to ignore biases that are built into the methodological approaches and instruments that we use. Within computing, specifically, the focus is often on removing complexity in order to standardize, abstract, scale, and generalize. Without reflexivity, researchers may use methods that generate results that could harm the communities of focus, and the academy has the ability to promote the usage of such methods through the acceptance or rejection of the dissemination of the work.\n\n5.2.3 Describe the Conceptual Glue that Binds Together Intersecting Systems of Power.\n\nSeveral assumptions undergird what this researcher had to contend with when selecting and applying methods. First, as described in previous sub-sections, these choices around what methods to employ and how to apply them are often made solely by the research team in the absence of the community or participants from that community. Examples include the valuing of statistical significance and quantitative research that distills, abstracts, and generalizes, through p values and patterns, over more qualitative measures, such as interviews, that center and elevate the voices of community members and participants. This assumption of “quantity over quality” reinforces that “things that can be measured are more highly valued than things that cannot” [111]. Further, the assumption of “progress is bigger, more” assumes that progress is defined by “an organization which expands (adds staff, adds projects) or develops the ability to serve more people (regardless of how well they are serving them) (Ibid). We argue that methods and the fields seemingly laser focus on large n, generalizability, and abstraction in research knowledge projects assumes that the more generalizeable or scalable the findings (which come out of the application of the methods), the more widely applicable those findings are, even if they don’t serve the communities or participants in question. Collins [29] asserts that “there are no inherently “intersectional” methodologies or methods. But there are ways in which intersectionality’s core premises, especially its premise of relationality” (the idea that race, gender, class, nation, and so on work in relation to each other and are maintained through these relational process) “can influence methodological choices within intersectional scholarship” (p. 152). This presents an opportunity to co-develop new methodologies.\n\nSecond, exclusion of methods that should be not included because of their potential to inflict physical, emotional, or psychological harm to participants and researchers, alike, is often not considered by researchers, nor is it often informed by expertise that communities bring to the research. This is “power hoarding”, a white supremacist characteristic in which those with power assume they “have the best interests of the organization” or of communities [111]. Not giving communities the opportunity to reject particular methods not only silences them, but can also open everyone up to danger as described in the excerpt where the street workers would not allow observations due to the danger posed to the workers themselves and the research team.\n\nThird, the criticism of reviewers for not including methods that, on the surface and without cultural competency and expertise, would seem appropriate is quite commonplace. The lack of trust afforded the street workers because the research team wasn’t there to “observe” (read surveil) them to verify their qualitative accounts is another example of not only “power hoarding” but also “knighting/blessing” [111, 145]. “Power hoarding” assumes that sharing power has no value and “power is seen as limited, only so much to go around” (Ibid). Okun further states that “those with power don’t see themselves as hoarding power or as feeling threatened” (Ibid). “Knighting/blessing” is a new white supremacy characteristic that emerged out of the interviews of Black women in various computing contexts talking about their intersectional experiences [145]. “Knighting/blessing” assumes that a those with power must “bless”, or endorse, the capability and knowledge of those without power (perhaps multiple times) before it is acknowledged, accepted, or believed [145].\n\n5.2.4 Examine the Ways in Which Less Dominant Groups are Subjugated, Surveilled, and/or Expected to Assimilate.\n\nBlack communities and Black people are subjugated to methods that were not created by them and/or even for them in researchers’ pursuit of objectivity, innovation, or simply seeking truth. Many times, such methods do not consider the participants’ culture, nor the information that they feel comfortable sharing, and so on. [68]. Adherence to requests by reviewers to use certain methods in order to publish their work is an example of how scholars assimilate. In the case above, the reviewers requested methods that would actually put people in jeopardy due to the context, which is an example of how academic publishing (reviewers) seek truth in certain ways because if the researchers did not “see it” (i.e., surveil Black participants) then the accounts of the people in the community can not be trusted). The need to surviel participants to obtain a “ground truth” is a white supremacy characteristics that is “blessing” or “knighting” certain knowledge as trustworthy and other methods—particularly those methods that originate from native and indigiesious cultures (e.g., storytelling)—are disregarded or distrusted [28].\n\n5.2.5 Identify Acts of Resistance.\n\nOne of the main acts of resistance include leveraging qualitative measures that elevates the experiences and voices of the community as experts, research partners, and intellectuals, which is a call to action in BFT. Another act of resistance was the focus of giving community partners agency in the section of the methods to be used, countering paternalistic approaches to research that places the researcher in the position as the expert regarding which methods are valid or objective. By engaging the community in deciding on the methods, the researcher was able to avoid using methods that do not make sense based on community needs and a deep relationship with community partners (e.g., observations do not make sense).\n\n5.3 Interpretation and Data Analysis\n\nAs far as interpretation of the data, we did much of the data analysis and presented it back to the community partners. However, I think one of the things that I made a mistake on was not having the community partners conduct the data analysis and the synthesis, the process of pulling out the themes. I would have liked the street outreach workers to have been trained and to engage in data analysis with us. I think that there’s always a place for us to learn so as I reflect, you know, it would have been more interesting to come up with interpretations and analysis methods that the street outreach workers were a part of. Since then, I always incorporate funds to pay for a community analysis group – where community members and participants are deeply embedded in the data analysis, whether it be coding data, giving feedback on the code books, monitoring our interpretations, and helping to synthesis the analysis and what story the data is telling—even if they agree or disagree with the story. And so, while we actually went back to them on this particular project, a lot of that was synthesizing themes, not raw codes, and so on. Instead, we said, “These are the big things that we’re seeing. What do you think?” While that’s a nice start, that’s the bare minimum—I could have made it so that they were more part of the process. The street outreach workers had a limited amount of time and our funding did not cover us to pay them for time to do data analysis. That is an example of the power that funders have in deciding whose knowledge is valued and important. Because the community partner was a non-profit organization, they didn’t have unlimited time and had to be careful about how their own funding was spent. As a researcher, I also had power to require or request or demand that I have funding to support our partners engaging in analysis, and I don’t think I did a good job of doing that in a deep way.\n\n5.3.1 Identify Saturated Sites of Violence.\n\nIn this case, the sites of violence are the spaces in which conclusions are drawn and narratives are formed and codified, particularly about people whose identities are non-dominant in the field and in society (which may be the same or different). The logics asserted based on the analysis and interpretation of data are many times violent and reinforce deficit narratives and cultural (hegemonic) stereotypes.\n\n5.3.2 Identify the Intersecting Systems of Power and Who Holds Power.\n\nResearchers hold the power in how they chose to interpret data and disseminate it in academic and non-academic spaces. Their credentials, which many times consists of terminal degrees (e.g., doctor of philosophy) means that society may trust their interpretations as truth rather than critically examining the narratives of certain researchers, particularly those from dominant identities [28, 38, 137]. In addition, the academy, specifically the publication process, holds power regarding whose narratives are shared within the field. As an example, while working on a project to teach Black high school boys computer science in preparation for taking the advanced placement (AP) exam, DiSalvo and Bruckman [45] use terms like “claim” when describing the young men’s reasons (e.g., they would miss school or would have to take public transportation to a place that is not their regular school) for not taking the AP CS exam. Language like “claim” and “they are not always consciously aware of their own motivations” is an example of how HCI researchers have the power to inject their personal biases into their interpretations because of the assumption that young Black high school boys could not possibly know or explain the rationale behind their decision-making. The ability to present such biased interpretations as truth to a wide community of other academics is an example of researchers’ power that often goes unquestioned.\n\nIn contrast, in our case study, we engage SOWs who represent members of the community in a dialogue to better understand the motivations behind their actions and the decisions they make. We include their actual words as testimonies of their lived experiences and review the outcomes of this research with SOWs and other community stakeholders to verify and correct as needed before publishing the results in academic venues. Referring to the example of DiSalvo and Bruckman [45], paternalism is at play with researchers stating they hope to help the Black high school boys to “develop greater self-awareness and the ability to articulate their conscious and subconscious motivations,” because again, the researchers assume that the Black participants must be told what their actual truths are. Rather than employing the testimonial authority of these Black male students, DiSalvo and Bruckman [45] are able “to speak with authority” about the Black men’s values, another example of researchers providing narratives about Black people without reflecting on the limitations of their interpretations as outsiders [68]. The intersecting systems of power of racism, sexism, classism and ability (fitness) nation (and likely others) are at play. Turning a critical eye to our case study, we dare not speak with authority since we recognize that our privilege and power create power differentials in the form of class distinctions that position us as outsiders in the very communities we hope to serve and collaborate with. Consequently, we engage in constant self-reflexivity to identify our biases and look for opportunities to redistribute power to our community partners whenever possible.\n\n5.3.3 Describe the Conceptual Glue"
