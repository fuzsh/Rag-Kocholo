The gathering, held at Koko’s Uptown Restaurant in McAllen, came shortly before the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge by Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, against the November 25 actions of a three-judge federal court in San Antonio. That court drew the boundaries for all of Texas’ state representative, state senate, and congressional maps after Democrats and Hispanics sued the state, alleging that the congressional and state legislative districts approved last spring by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature discriminates against Mexican Americans. Abbott contends the Legislature did not discriminate against minorities. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear both sides on January 9. Featured, from left, are: Jane Cross of Edinburg; T.C.

However, Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, has challenged the action of that federal court – which drew up the boundaries of all House and Senate seats, and congressional districts – and the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Abbott’s challenge on January 9. Muñoz and Elizondo-García finalized his paperwork during a Democratic Party campaign kick-off held at Koko’s Uptown Restaurant in McAllen. See story later in this posting.\n\n•••••\n\nRep.

Great gestures come from grand designs, multi-billion dollar enterprises that traverse continents and create jobs and wealth but they also come from kind words and extending a helping hand to someone in need.” With the veteran lawmaker’s retirement, a number of area Democrats are vying to succeed him in the Texas Legislature by competing for their party’s nomination in 2012. In a column he authored which explains his decision, Peña talks about the strains and successes of his legislative career. “My wife and children allowed me the luxury of working full-time, seven days a week at a job that pays $7,200 a year,” Peña reflected. “To (wife) Mónica, Adrienne, Aaron, Alyssa, Anthony and John, thank you.

DÍAZ\n\nWhen the Hidalgo County Courthouse Master Plan Committee meets for its third public session in Edinburg on Wednesday, January 18, one of the key issues which may come up is whether state law requires that a county courthouse be located in the county seat.\n\nThat question drew increased importance in early November after Edcouch Mayor Pro Tem Eddy González, one of 30 members of that citizens advisory panel, recommended that other communities in Hidalgo County be given the chance to offer land, infrastructure, or other assets to try to become home to any possible new courthouse.\n\n“I’m going to check into that,” González said on November 7, following the second public meeting of the Hidalgo County Courthouse Master Plan Committee, which had gathered at the University of Texas-Pan American. “It used to be located in the City of Hidalgo, but overnight it was moved to Edinburg. If we get to the point that we need to go to the Texas Legislature (to allow a new courthouse to be built outside of Edinburg), then you do it.”\n\nThe City of Hidalgo was county seat from 1852, when Hidalgo County was created, until 1908, when – according to the online encyclopedia Wikipedia – Edinburg became the county seat “in a dramatic, nighttime covert operation in which the county records were removed from the previous county seat.”\n\nThe upcoming January 18 public meeting of the Hidalgo County Master Plan Committee will take place from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the International Trade and Technology Building, 1201 West University Drive, on the campus of the University of Texas-Pan American.\n\nAll meetings of this group have been and will be open to the public. The date and location of the fourth and final work session will be announced following the January 18 meeting.\n\nThe master plan committee and a paid consulting firm have been selected by the Hidalgo County Commissioners Court to help develop recommendations to deal with serious overcrowding issues facing the courthouse – an option which could include the construction of a new courthouse.\n\nHidalgo County Judge Ramón García believes Edinburg is best for any new courthouse, noting the current facility’s centralized location, the willingness and financial ability of Edinburg to invests its own resources to improve the courthouse complex, and the substantial investment – up to $40 million – of other existing county facilities in Edinburg.\n\n“No final decision has yet been made. Everything is still up to the majority of the will of the Hidalgo County Commissioners Court,” García said following the November 7 meeting, which was held at the International Trade and Technology Building at UTPA. “Anybody who is interested, they just need to contact the (county commissioners) court to see what it is that they have to offer. At that point, decisions can be made. But as it stands right now, from all the facts we are aware, Edinburg is clearly an excellent location.”\n\nGonzález, an appointee of Precinct 1 Hidalgo County Commissioner Joel Quintanilla of Weslaco, told fellow committee members during that session that González wanted other communities to have the opportunity to submit their own bids to secure any potential new courthouse.\n\n“My point is quite simple. Let’s not just close our minds to one area. If it’s Edinburg, then it’s Edinburg. It’s not like I saying it shouldn’t be Edinburg. I’m not going there,” said González. “I’m just saying let’s keep our minds open and really look out there, and see what is available. Money has already been invested by Edinburg. Fine. Those things can be discussed with other communities if they are interested. Let’s not shut our minds.”\n\nEli R. Ochoa, P.E., AIA, the president and CEO of ERO Architects, said during the November 7 meeting that the master plan being developed “isn’t a plan for putting it in Edinburg, this isn’t a plan for putting it in Mission or Weslaco or anywhere else. It’s a plan where we look at all the different components related to the county and how they function and work within the courthouse – everything from the county clerk, district clerk, the district attorney’s office – and how it all comes together.”\n\nOchoa said the master plan – which is tentatively set for review by the county commissioners court early next year – will most likely focus on two major elements.\n\n“One of them is, if it were left here, how do we incorporate it into either a brand new facility stand-alone, or into a plan that works around the existing courthouse, the existing county buildings, and then put the monetary implications of that,” Ochoa explained. “We can’t make that decision. We don’t work in a vacuum. What we are doing is getting as much information as we can, we are trying to be as concise in how we present that information, and then we will get it presented to the (Hidalgo County) Commissioners Court. They are going to be the ones who are going to make decisions.”\n\nGonzález, who also serves as president of the Lower Rio Grande Valley Development Council, says his home region of the Delta Area, which also includes Elsa, La Blanca, La Villa, Monte Alto and Delta Lake, appreciates the economic impact of landing any new courthouse.\n\n“We see it, we understand it, so we are willing to do what is necessary to make it happen,” the Edcouch mayor pro tem noted. “Can it be done? I don’t know.\n\n“Honestly, I would be very interested in it going to the Delta Area,” González acknowledged. “People may laugh at that, but laugh. But you know what? We are ready. We would be ready to donate land and infrastructure because imagine what would come from that.”\n\nThe work of the committee, including historical background, general project documents, and photographs, is available free and online to the public by logging on at:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/hcchmasterplan/\n\nOther highlights of the November 7 meeting were provided by Karina Cardoza, Public Affairs Director for Hidalgo County. Her account follows:\n\nAt the culmination of the inaugural meeting of the Courthouse Master Plan Committee held in October, members of the 28-member committee were charged with contributing their vision for an ideal courthouse facility that would encompass the current needs and projected growth anticipated in the next 10 years, as well as take into consideration all fundamental and desired elements of design, structure and function.\n\nA similar task was assigned to the consultants facilitating the development of the master plan. Between the first and second meetings, they were to undertake a discovery analysis of each of the affected departments and offices currently housed within the courthouse to determine the current and future spatial requirements.\n\nThe appointed members of the Hidalgo County Courthouse Master Plan Committee met for the second time on Monday, November 7, to review the progress made since the inaugural meeting held in October. The committee itself grew from the original 28 to a total of 30 members, after it was determined that certain critical departments were necessary for inclusion.\n\nLaurie Limbacher, a member of the planning consultant team, gave a historical overview on legislation and statutes governing the preservation and protection of courthouses under state law. Ultimately, the Texas Historical Commission must review and approve any proposed changes made to courthouse structures and grounds; any plan developed by the committee should be mindful of the Historical Commission’s recommendations.\n\nThe consultant team (ERO Architects) discussed the discovery process used to garner information on the current courthouse use of space. The team met with individual departments and offices to determine what the anticipated need in square footage would be to safely and comfortably accommodate current demand and plan for the future. Based on the assessment, the total on-site square footage needed is approximately 244,694 square feet, a 133 percent increase from the current space at the courthouse.\n\nThe planning consultant team presented a compilation of visionary ideas submitted by the committee, who named elements such as a campus-like facility, design with extra floors for future use, energy-efficient building, and a design that remained true to the unique culture of the area. Also shared were key values or “pillars,” based on committee member feedback, which will help drive the development of the master plan, and included a safe and secure environment, harmonious and open design and space, sensitivity to ecology, effective infrastructure, flexibility in design, durable, and low maintenance cost, among others.\n\n“I am impressed with the dedication and effort that the entire committee is putting forth on this extremely important process,” remarked the county judge. “The committee’s participation and input are critical towards the development of a master plan that will serve as a roadmap for the county to follow as it addresses the need for a new courthouse.\n\n“It is our hope that at the end of this process, we will have a firm foundation upon which to develop a keystone landmark fitting for our county seat, a pillar of excellence that will propel our Hidalgo County community forward and last not 20 years, not 50 years, but to serve us for multiple generations to come,” García added.\n\n••••••\n\nSen. Hinojosa receives key appointment to Joint Interim Committee on Human Trafficking\n\nBy ARTURO BALLESTEROS\n\nLt. Governor David Dewhurst on Friday, December 9, appointed Sen. Juan “Chuy” Hinojosa, D-McAllen, to a joint interim committee charged with monitoring the implementation of new human trafficking legislation.\n\nUnder Hinojosa’s leadership, human rights advocates, Texas prosecutors and law enforcement came to an agreement on how to best address this issue during the regular session held in the spring of 2011.\n\nIn addition to Hinojosa, the other Senate members on the legislative committee are Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, who will serve as co-chair; Sen. Brian Birdwell, R-Grandbury; Sen. Glenn Hegar, R-Katy; Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Southside Place; Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, and Sen. Tommy Williams, R-The Woodlands.\n\nThe result was an amendment that Hinojosa successfully added to House Bill 260 by Rep. Harvey Hilderbran, R-Kerville and Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston. The amendment makes it easier for prosecutors to convict human smugglers and traffickers in Texas.\n\nHinojosa, an expert on criminal justice issues as well as an attorney in private practice, brings considerable experience to this committee. During his tenure in the Texas House of Representatives, Hinojosa served as chairman of the Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence in the 1990’s. Hinojosa currently serves on the Senate Committee on Criminal Justice.\n\n“For years stories about human trafficking and smuggling have popped up in news outlets across Texas. It is not just a border or political issue. It is an issue that affects every county of the state and is indifferent to one’s political views,” Hinojosa said.\n\nThe Joint Interim Committee on Human Trafficking is charged with studying the services available to victims of human trafficking under current law, as well as to develop best practices for youth who fall victim to this crime.\n\n“The fact that both the House and Senate have come together under this Joint Interim Committee shows that the Legislature is committed to further exploring this issue. The societal and economic costs associated with human trafficking are enormous. The Legislature has taken good first steps in cracking down on this criminal activity,” Hinojosa concluded.\n\nHuman trafficking is defined as a crime against humanity, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. It involves an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harbouring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every year, thousands of men, women and children fall into the hands of traffickers, in their own countries and abroad. Every country in the world is affected by trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims.\n\n••••••\n\nRep. Muñoz files as a Democrat to run for a second term for House District 36 seat\n\nBy BRIAN GODÍNEZ\n\nSurrounded by his supporters and family, Rep. Sergio Muñoz Jr., D-Mission, on Monday, November 28, submitted his application for a place on the Democratic Party primary ballot during the Hidalgo County Democratic Party filing event held at Koko’s Uptown Restaurant in McAllen.\n\nMuñoz will seek reelection to his House District 36 seat that he was first elected to in 2010.\n\nWith the federal court in San Antonio on Friday, November 25, releasing temporary Texas House of Reprentative maps that remain in place for next year’s legislative elections, District 36 for now includes all or parts of the cities of Pharr, McAllen, Mission, Hidalgo, Palmview and Granjeno.\n\nAttorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, immediately challenged the federal court’s maps by appealing that action to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has set a January 9, 2012 date to hear legal arguments from Abbott, a Republican, who contends the congressional and legislative maps approved by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature last spring are legal.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department, Democrats, and Hispanic groups say the Legislature’s work discriminates against minorities. In late November, a three-judge federal court in San Antonio agreed with the U.S. Justice Department, and redrew the state’s congressional and legislative districts in a processing known as redistricting.\n\nEvery 10 years, following the United States Census, the Legislature must reapportion legislative, Congressional and State Board of Education districts to create districts containing approximately the same number of Texans.\n\nMuñoz supported the plan approved on November 25 by the three-judge federal court in San Antonio, a measure which also results in the creation of an additional House district for the Valley.\n\n“I am very pleased with the results of the court and firmly believe that the good people of Hidalgo County and the Democratic Party will have an even bigger voice in Austin,” Muñoz said. “The court’s (November 25) decision has allowed me to focus my campaign in much of the same communities that I represented during the last legislative session.\n\nThe lawmaker add that he “learned a lot from so many people in my district and I want to return and do as much as I can to take care of them. It will be a tough fight and I won’t give up on them.”\n\nMuñoz, a local attorney and former Palmview Municipal Court Judge, had an extraordinary inaugural legislative session during his first legislation session last spring.\n\nHis achievements included the passage of an array of major bills and amendments authored, coauthored, sponsored and cosponsored by him.\n\nAmong those measures were legislation which:\n\nRestored $630,000 in funding for Bachelor’s of Applied Technology Degree programs at South Texas College;\n\nReduced high school dropout rates; and\n\nIncreased penalties to punish human traffickers.\n\nMuñoz also passed several measures which honored major achievements by constituents in his House District 36, including House Concurrent Resolution 56, which welcomed home our Vietnam veterans and honored their service.\n\nHis successful legislative session also included:\n\nIncreased funding for law enforcement to investigate predators that use the Internet to prey on young people and children;\n\nProtecting private property rights; and\n\nContinuing the telecommunications discount for public schools and colleges, nonprofit hospitals, and public libraries throughout Texas.\n\nHe fought vigorously against the budget cuts made to education and other vital programs for South Texas.\n\nMuñoz believes the next legislative session, which begins in January 2013, should have a balanced approach to tackle key issues related to jobs, education and health care, and work together to provide a better future for communities and families.\n\nFor more information about his campaign, please visit his Sergio for South Texas website at:\n\nhttp://www.sergioforsouthtexas.com.\n\nDavid A.

DÍAZ\n\nEdinburg leaders have launched another proven strategy for economic development with their recent decision to better organize, promote, and support one of the most valuable assets in the city – its outstanding arts community.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 15, the Edinburg Economic Development Corporation – which is the jobs-creation arm of the Edinburg City Council – announced the selection of Evana Vleck, the now former and effective marketing director with the Edinburg Chamber of Commerce, as the city’s first-ever Downtown Development/Arts Coordinator.\n\nThe arts – generally broken down into the more familiar categories as visual arts (paintings, sculptures, photography) and performing arts (dance, drama, music) – symbolize more than cultural and intellectual treasures for Edinburg.\n\nThe arts can and do represent prosperity for any community willing and able to elevate them into a powerful engine to boost their local economy.\n\n“It is very important. It is the next level in our evolvement as a city,” says Mayor Richard García, who successfully lobbied the Edinburg City Council and the Edinburg Economic Development Corporation (EEDC) Board of Directors to authorize the creation and funding of the Downtown Development/Arts Coordinator position.\n\n“Thank goodness, we are doing great in our community, such as in our retail sales and jobs creation, for example,” the mayor noted, then added, “I believe that being a family-oriented city, for our community to be well-rounded, they say that the family that plays together stays together. This is one more way, another opportunity, to achieve that for our citizens.”\n\nGarcía noted that the economic development priorities initially undertaken by the city council and EEDC “were to first address the basic needs of our city, such as building the new City Hall complex, establishing a new water plant, expanding the fire department. We have achieved those goals, and now, the logical progression is into arts and entertainment.”\n\nEdinburg has deep-rooted traditions in the arts, not only as a result of home-grown talent, but with the constant presence every year of hundreds of University of Texas-Pan American faculty and students who teach or study their respective skills at the highest levels.\n\n“The arts are vital economic generators for any local government which understands and supports this important segment of their community,” says Nelda T. Ramírez, the EEDC’s executive director. “Just look at the announcement last August by the UT System Board of Regents, who gave their final approval for the state funding and construction of a $42.6 million, 1,000-seat performing arts center at UT-Pan American. That’s just the latest example of how the arts have a positive impact on our city.”\n\nThe UTPA Fine Arts Academic and Performance Complex, scheduled for substantial completion by October 2014, will replace the aging Fine Arts Auditorium and Fine Arts Annex, according to the UT System.\n\nSeveral blocks east of UTPA’s future performing arts center is another important venue that has been upgraded to help promote economic development in the downtown region.\n\nThe Edinburg-owned City Auditorium, located at 204 North 7th next to Edinburg City Hall, features theater-style seating for almost 750 people, including accessibility for handicapped patrons, in a climate-controlled environment surrounded by beautiful architecture stemming from the early 20th century.\n\nAs part of the city’s ambitious campaign to make the downtown region a destination point for commerce, tourism, and entertainment, the City Auditorium has recently benefitted from more than $100,000 in improvements designed to increase the number and types of events it can host in the coming months and years.\n\nVleck explained that creating a vibrant arts district – and including the City Auditorium as a major element – is part of the Edinburg Master Plan, which is a landmark economic development blueprint funded by the city and the EEDC.\n\nDetails of that master plan are available online at the following address:\n\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/hcchmasterplan/\n\nOn the left hand side of that website page, hit “General Project Documents” to view and download the PDF entitled “EdinburgDowntown”.\n\n“We can utilize the City Auditorium, which is a beautiful building, in many ways,” Vleck predicted, observing that the historical facility already features a fixed stage with related theater lighting. “We can offer a wide array of talent the venue and opportunities to showcase their skills, services, and goods.”\n\nThe mayor emphasizes the positive roles that can be played by the City Auditorium.\n\n“We want to put to work and take advantage of its location for cultural events,” García said. “I foresee plays, concerts, maybe some opera productions. There is a theater production group which does productions at The Camille Playhouse (www.camilleplayhouseonline.com) in Brownsville. We are going to see about the possibility of them performing our City Auditorium if we can set up the staging materials for our facility. Perhaps we can partner with people in Cameron County. We have talked about being regional in our approach with everything in the Valley, and this would be a good starting point.”\n\nShowcasing Edinburg as a South Texas hot spot for the arts is another part of Vleck’s duties, and the accomplished media professional is already way ahead on that goal.\n\n“We want to be regional, the arts hub, we want to be where it happens in the cultural arts events,” Vleck said. “Part of that is branding Edinburg Arts (www.EdinburgArts.com). We are on Facebook, we have a community page, a fan page. Anyone is free to e-mail me ([email protected]), call me anytime (956/383-7124). If you are an artist, if you are part of the business community, any resident who wants more information. We are about the business community embracing their city and building upon our arts community. We want everyone to be part of our growth.”\n\nVleck was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley and currently resides in McAllen with her husband and 16 year old son. She attended McAllen High Schools and South Texas College where she studied art and literature. She has worked with the International Museum of Art and Science as well as the Edinburg Chamber of Commerce in arts, education and marketing.\n\nShe said she is passionate about serving the community, and since age 17 has organized events and fundraisers in the arts.\n\nVleck has contributed written work to Edinburg Politics, The Monitor, The Mesquite Review, The Paper of South Texas, South Texas Nation, The Business Times, the Edinburg Review, and publications.\n\nShe won an award at the Texas Chamber of Commerce Executives conference in San Antonio for her newsletter design in 2009.\n\nShe also has worked in organizing large events such as the South Texas Underground Music Festival, the South Texas Literary Festival, Fiesta Edinburg and the Texas Cook’em: High Steaks in Edinburg.\n\n••••••\n\nFollowing federal court decision, T.C. Bentancourt files for vacant District 40 state representative legislative seat\n\nBy BRIAN GODÍNEZ\n\nWith the federal court in San Antonio on Friday, November 25, releasing temporary Texas House of Representative maps that may remain in place for next year’s state legislative elections, Edinburg native and businessman T.C. Betancourt on Monday, November 28, filed for state representative, House District 40.\n\nDistrict 40 includes parts or all of the cities of Edinburg, Elsa and Pharr.\n\nAttorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, immediately challenged the federal court’s maps by appealing that action to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has set a January 9, 2012 date to hear legal arguments from Abbott, a Republican, who contends the congressional and legislative maps approved by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature last spring are legal.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department, Democrats, and Hispanic groups say the Legislature’s work discriminates against minorities.

Justice has been served for the people of Hidalgo County and the Democratic Party. The decision has given me the opportunity to focus my campaign on a district anchored in my hometown of Edinburg,” said Betancourt.\n\nBentancourt said he looked forward to campaigning in the version of House District 40 approved by the three-member federal court in San Antonio.\n\n“Because of its central location to major commerce corridors and the educational capital of our region, the Edinburg-Elsa area plays an important role in Texas,” he said. “I am looking forward to campaigning everyday with the great people of our community and learn first-hand about what I can do to help as a legislator.”\n\nBetancourt is a local healthcare and produce businessman and is seeking the legislative seat because he believes that it is time to focus on caring for our people. He stated that the Republicans in control this last session cost South Texas billions of dollars in critical funding over the next several years and will have adverse affects on jobs, education and healthcare. He stated that he has been listening to what his community needs.\n\n“I have the skills, energy and determination to successfully work with the state’s top leadership, including the Valley legislative delegation, so that our communities receive our fair share of Texas’ resources,” Betancourt said.\n\nHe stated that he intends to work hard to create good-paying jobs, affordable healthcare, offer more people the ability to access the education they want.\n\n“These are the opportunities and benefits that I have provided our employees and families in Hidalgo County for the past decade. I can be trusted to fight for the people of South Texas,” Betancourt said.\n\nHe believes that his years in healthcare and agriculture have provided him with many opportunities to see and learn first-hand how the political and government system operate – what works and what doesn’t work.\n\nT.C. Betancourt is the son Lupe Betancourt, a Vietnam War veteran and former Elsa city councilman.\n\nT.C. Betancourt was born and raised in Edinburg with strong family roots in District 40.\n\nHe is a product of the Edinburg CISD school system and graduated from Edinburg North High School in 1995. He obtained his Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Agriculture Science from Texas A&M University Kingsville in 1998 and 2002 respectively. In addition, he earned an MBA from University of Texas – Pan American in 2006.\n\nT.C. Betancourt and his wife Ana started Elite Rehab Services six years ago, a regional outpatient therapy clinic specializing in occupational and speech services. In addition, they provide their clients with nutritional and social services. They service pediatric and adult clients throughout the South Texas area and San Antonio. He is also involved in the operation of Betancourt & Co., a local-area produce company.\n\nHe is active and involved in groups that are affiliated with the advocacy of the healthcare providers on both the state and national level.

ESCOBAR\n\nDuring the fall 2011 semester, South Texas College was one of only four community colleges from across the state to receive special recognition from the Texas Association of Business. The award was presented in Austin to applaud the college’s efforts to increase its graduation rate, as well as help students progress through the higher education system in a timely manner.\n\n“We hear a lot about the colleges that aren’t pushing students to succeed, pushing them to get a degree,” said Bill Hammond, president and CEO of the Texas Association of Business. “STC is one of four community colleges that are getting it right. Each of the honorees has shown significant improvement in the number of students completing degree plans and improvements in student achievement.”\n\nSTC was honored in the very large community college category, along with Howard Community College in the small category, Paris Junior College in the medium category, and Blinn College in the large category.\n\nTAB asked The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to use its outcome-based model, called Momentum Points, to measure the relative improvement of all community colleges on metrics such as developmental education completion, transfers, credit accumulation and certificate and degree completion between fiscal years 2007 and 2010. These are areas TAB believes are critical for producing better results. Based on these measures, STC stood out from its peers in the state.\n\n“At only 18 years old, STC has grown from just 1,000 students its first year to serving more than 31,000 students, and with that enrollment comes great responsibility,” said Dr. Shirley A. Reed, STC president. “We believe in access and for this reason have a strong commitment to students enrolling with the college, but we also want to ensure our students are leaving our halls with value and that value comes from earning a certificate or degree. Knowledge is power, but it is much more powerful when backed by an earned degree. With STC, students are receiving a quality education.”\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, the college has seen an increase of 85 percent in students earning a degree or certificate, an increase of 20 percent in the number of students transferring to a four-year university or college and an increase of 60 percent in the number of students who earn at least 30 credit hours from the college. Most recently, more than 3,200 students earned a bachelor’s, associate or certificate from the college in May 2011\n\n“We are tackling major issues head on, including college readiness, persistence in higher education, and completion by design,” Juan E. Mejia, STC vice president for academic affairs. “We are working with our K to 12 partners to begin preparing students for college starting in kindergarten, so that they will know that they will be attending college and performing well through the system.”\n\nAs graduation rates have increased at STC, the percentage of students taking some developmental courses at the college has decreased from 62 percent of the student population to just 40 percent. During the same 2008 to 2010 time period, the percentage of students passing a college-level math course at the college increased by more than 700 percent.\n\n“To be competitive and be ready for the jobs of the 21st century Texas must be ready to train the next generation of workers, that’s why our community colleges are so valuable,” said Hammond. “These are the examples. These colleges show that change can be made, and outcomes for both students and employers can be improved.”\n\nFounded in 1922, The Texas Association of Business is a broad-based, bipartisan organization representing more than 3,000 small and large Texas employers and 200 chambers of commerce.

Texas open government laws make that knowledge possible.”\n\nIn an effort to streamline and modernize governmental bodies’ submission of ruling requests to the Open Records Division, the OAG has created an Electronic Filing System. Under the Public Information Act, governmental bodies that wish to withhold information from disclosure to the public must seek a ruling from the OAG’s Open Records Division.\n\nThe new Electronic Filing System, which will be available for use in February 2012, will allow governmental bodies to submit their requests electronically through the system. Interested third parties that wish to submit briefing materials supporting or opposing governmental bodies’ ruling requests will also be able to submit their documentation electronically through the Electronic Filing System.\n\nEffective January 3, 2012, the Open Records Division will no longer accept faxed or emailed submissions from governmental bodies or interested third parties. Governmental bodies who choose not to use the new Electronic Filing System may still submit their documents to the OAG through First-Class U.S. Mail, common or contract carrier, interagency mail or hand delivery during normal business hours.\n\nPublic officials with questions about requesting an attorney general open records decision and submitting materials for OAG review should contact the OAG’s toll-free Open Government Hotline at (877) OPEN TEX.

The Comfort House is a 10-bed homelike residence for persons in terminal stages of illness, generally admitted when they no longer seek a medical cure and have a life expectancy of less than four months. They welcome persons regardless of race, faith, persuasion or economic status.\n\n“Our staff is honored to be able to make a small contribution to the Comfort House and their efforts in caring for the terminally ill, particluarly those in our community who do not have the physical, financial or emotional resources to receive or provide quality care at home,” said Laura Hinojosa, Hidalgo County District Clerk.\n\nThe district clerk office kicked off their charitable efforts in 2008 as part of the American Heart Association’s Go Red for Women campaign. The program, which allows department staff to wear jeans every Friday in exchange for a $5 donation, has since then expanded their efforts through the creation of a “charitable organizations list” of which staff randomly selects a recipient every six months. Over the past four years the district clerk office has collected over $24,000 which has gone to local charitable organizations throughout Hidalgo County.\n\n“We are extremely appreciative of the district clerk office’s contribution to the Comfort House,” said Mary Botello, Comfort House Administrator. “Their efforts will help us fullfill our commitment to keeping our residents as free of pain and discomfort as possible and in a loving presence at all times.”\n\nFor more information regarding the Comfort House of McAllen log on to:\n\nhttp://peteanddiane.com/ComfortHouse/about.html\n\nor Botello at 956/687-7367.\n\n••••••\n\nTen good years of service – I am so grateful for the opportunity that I was given to serve the community I love so much\n\nBy REP.

At the end of my fifth term I would have served a good 10 years and feel that we have accomplished as much as we set out to do when I ran for this office in 2002.\n\nAt the beginning of the legislative redistricting process I advised colleagues and map drawers that my goal was to present a map that gave every incumbent in the Rio Grande Valley a legislative district that they could win. We did just that. Unfortunately, the map drawn and designated by the three judge federal redistricting panel undid that work. The district I have been placed in is a 75 percent Democratic seat. It is unwinnable by me or any Republican candidate and I will not move into another legislative district to run against a colleague.\n\nMy decision to switch parties was met with derision by many who accused me of doing so as a quid pro quo. As I said then and is now evidently clear I did so because I felt it was the right thing to do rather than because I expected a political favor in return. Providing South Texans with a choice and forcing petty partisans to debate ideas rather than rely on the personality driven politics of the past is a decision I will never regret. The Rio Grande Valley is too dynamic, too diverse to be dominated by a single party that lets bullies thrive and enrich themselves and their cronies.\n\nMy decision 10 years ago to run for office was spurred by a family tragedy that highlighted the dire need for drug treatment services for our community. Shortly after winning election to the Texas House I, joined by family and friends, set out on a ‘promesa’, a walk, from a highly respectable but private substance abuse treatment facility in the Hill Country of Central Texas to the State Capitol. The walk was meant to call attention to and begin the drive for a meaningful dialogue on the impact that drug and alcohol abuse was having in all our communities.\n\nIn my third term of office, I secured $3 million in state funding for a substance abuse treatment facility for Hidalgo County. After finding another $400 thousand for the storm proofing of the building, Hidalgo County began construction of the facility. It is now complete and will be serving adolescents and their families in a location east of Edinburg on Schunior Road.\n\nMuch to the chagrin of my family, I have completely dedicated my life to public service. I was once a wealthy man. I have traded that material wealth for a spiritual and emotional growth that I cannot regret. It is time to bring focus back to a family that has been supportive beyond all reasonable expectations. I am so proud to have been given the opportunity to serve my community and will continue to seek ways to do so. I am so proud of a hardworking and dedicated staff that has helped me and this office accomplish so much. Our strength has been in remaining independent of the partisanship that mars local politics, of late affected the Texas Legislature and has virtually paralyzed Washington, D.C. for generations.\n\nThat independence allowed me to put the needs of my community before the dictates of party bosses and special interest groups. The construction of the Substance Abuse Treatment Center, securing funding of $750,000 for a park at the new Boys and Girls Club facility in Edinburg, the passage of bonds for a $40 million fine arts complex at the University of Texas-Pan American, and legislation authorizing the construction of a $25 million Student Fitness and Wellness Center also at UTPA were all made possible because of relationships built on trust and mutual respect.\n\nThe establishment and success of the Regional Academic Health Center and the emergence of a medical school for South Texas are great achievements that I share with many local and state leaders.\n\nMy election to the Texas House in 2002 coincided with the selection of the first Republican Speaker of the House since Reconstruction. As a Democrat I was asked to serve on substantive committees like the powerful Appropriations Committee and the tax writing committee Ways and Means. I served as a Chairman of Committees on Criminal Jurisprudence, Technology and Emergency Preparedness under two different Speakers. At the beginning of this past legislative session I founded the Hispanic Republican Conference and was joined in this effort by five other newly elected Hispanic Republican House members.\n\nIndependence allowed me to take on issues that were unpopular to partisans in South Texas but important to the rest of the community. Talking about the importance of voter integrity, the undue influence of politiqueras in the process, the corruption at the local, county and state level by bullies left unchecked were met by threats of retribution and on more than one occasion a challenge at the polls. On the issue of Voter ID I was firmly behind the will of the people of my community.\n\nOn homeland and border security I once again stood at odds with some local, state and federal officials that believe sticking your head in the sand is a viable policy in confronting the violence that has ravaged northern Mexico over the last few years. I have been a vocal proponent of increasing federal, state and local law enforcement resources in order to continue to secure our border. In the last two sessions I have called for and supported over $110 million in state funding each biennium for the border region. It is not important whose definition is used to attribute violence in our community as spillover from the cartel wars in Northern Mexico. We must not think that we are building up an arsenal of hardware and manpower to prepare for an eventuality of a drug war in South Texas but it is our duty to our children and every Texan to be vigilant and guard against the possibility of the occurrence of that threat.\n\nArguably one of our communities’ proudest achievements lies on the self sacrifice and service of countless of military veterans and their families. I remain an ardent supporter of the commitment of local, state and federal resources for the construction of a full-fledged veterans hospital for the Rio Grande Valley. I have stood with veterans on every major and minor piece of legislation over my career. From reducing the tax burden on disabled veterans to passing legislation conferring the Legislative Medal of honor to Edinburg heroes Freddy González and Pedro Cano, I have been proud to do my part in honoring our citizen soldiers. I joined veterans of South Texas in a walk from Edinburg to San Antonio to highlight the trip that many have faced in receiving health care. The walk, a march to the veterans that I joined in the 230 mile trek, was a simple act rooted in a deep and meaningful gesture. I will never forget the friendships earned on that trip and I will never give up on the fight for getting those veterans and the others that will follow the hospital they deserve.\n\nI have had the honor of working with national and international business leaders and local and state officials to bring much needed jobs to our community. I have been woken in the middle of the night by parents of drug addicted youths at their wits’ end. Great gestures come from grand designs, multi-billion dollar enterprises that traverse continents and create jobs and wealth but they also come from kind words and extending a helping hand to someone in need.\n\nMy wife and children allowed me the luxury of working full-time, seven days a week at a job that pays $7,200 a year. To Mónica, Adrienne, Aaron, Alyssa, Anthony and John, thank you. I am so grateful for the opportunity that I was given to serve the community I love so much."
