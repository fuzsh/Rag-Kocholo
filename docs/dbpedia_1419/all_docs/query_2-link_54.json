        "text": "Flutist Hideko Amano was born in Japan and came to the United States at the age of 12. She studied flute under Ms. Susan Levitin, and soon won many young artist competition awards. Her performance debut occurred in 1990 at Symphony Center, where she performed as a soloist for Chaminade’s Concertino for Flute and Orchestra.\n\nMs. Amano earned a bachelor’s degree in music from the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where she studied under the prominent flutist Ms. Paula Robison. She gave a joint performance with Ms. Robison in a concert series for the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. She continued her musical education in Paris, France, studying with Mathieu Dufour, who was the principal flutist for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. While studying in Paris, she also performed in many international Chamber Music Festivals and concerts in Italy, England, Israel and Morocco. She has continued her career as an active recitalist and has performed on the WFMT 98.7 Monday Evening Series and Dame Myra Hess Concert Series at Cultural Center. In 2018, she was invited to the International Flute Festival in Lima, Peru, as their guest artist to perform with the orchestra, giving recitals and masterclasses.\n\nIn addition to her performing career, Ms. Amano also maintains a growing private studio. Her students have won numerous competitions and studied at major universities. Ms. Amano was also an adjunct professor of flute at DePaul University. Currently she serves as an adjunct professor at Carthage College, Harper College and is an instructor at Midwest Young Artists.\n\nMezzo-soprano Kathy Cowan brings her eclectic background of performance and teaching to her work at Northeastern Illinois University. Ms. Cowan grew up in a musical family, singing the alto part of 5-part motets at home. She played the French horn throughout her youth and studied at the Eastman School of Music Prep School. Kathy Cowan earned a BFA in Music/Theatre from Roosevelt University in Chicago and a Master’s Degree in Vocal Pedagogy at Northeastern Illinois University.\n\nAs a performer, Kathy’s Irish heritage significantly informs her musical activity. She has been the featured soloist, singing Irish songs, with several major symphony orchestras throughout her career. She has appeared with: Doc Severinsen and the Milwaukee Symphony; the Buffalo and Calgary Philharmonic Orchestras; and the Toledo, Colorado and Madison Chamber Symphonies. She has appeared as guest artist several times with the Paul Winter Consort and has been featured on the Millennium Stage of the Kennedy Center, and at the Smithsonian Institution. She has made several recordings - In the Deep Heart's Core, songs from the poetry of William Butler Yeats (volumes 1 and 2); The Red-Haired Man's Wife, a collection of Irish folk songs; and A Kiltartan Road Christmas, an unusual collection of music for the season.\n\nMs. Cowan performs at colleges, universities, cultural institutions, houses of worship, festivals and on art series and presents workshops in Celtic song and master classes in acting, voice and performance technique in the U.S., Europe and China. She has developed several shows and characters in both collaboration with others and in a nod to her Irish heritage. Her most recent work was with Venetia Stifler’s Concert Dance, Inc. of the Ruth Page Dance Foundation where she created the score for a dance in which she sings a cappella, and which has now been performed at the Ravinia Festival, in Pennsylvania and in Europe. Another significant performance creation was Music Mad, a show telling the story of Chief Francis O’Neill, the renowned Chief of Chicago police who “saved” Irish traditional music. She developed the roles of the Sean-Bhean bhocht (Irish for ‘poor old woman’) Catherine O’Neill, Chief O’Neill’s mother, as well as his wife, Anna Rogers. She has professionally sung roles in Gilbert and Sullivan productions, medieval opera, was a member of the Chicago Symphony Chorus for nine seasons, as well as having specialized in small ensemble (Church to Chant to Swing) and back-up singing. She has sung at Chicago’s Temple Sholom for 37 years.

She meets each student where they are in terms of their technical and artistic development. She provides a challenging, but safe, atmosphere for the discovery of the voice, while guiding students with technical and artistic advice to further develop their own art.\n\nWhat the critics are saying about Kathy Cowan:\n\n\"A powerful infusion of authenticity... masterful singing\" The Chicago Sun Times\n\n\"Kathy Cowan is superb.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nBorn in Madrid, violinist, Jaime Gorgojo, combines his performing career with his pedagogic vocation.

Ulery’s unique vision of subtle grandiosity is let fly. It is texturally layered and emotionally swollen yet maintains a refined elegance; dense yet crystal-clear.\" - UK Vibe\n\n\"By the end of the album you'll realize this is Matt Ulery's harmonic world, and we just live in it.\" - 33Third (Best of 2019)\n\n\"However complex an Ulery composition is, its mellifluous melodicism ensures it communicates with immediacy.” - Textura (Best of 2019)\n\n“With each release, Ulery’s vision grows and matures—making him one of the most intrepid and innovative contemporary musicians.
