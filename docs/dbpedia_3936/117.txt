You've probably heard of Google. It's the search engine most people regard as the default option (and it's Ossity's default too). In fact, Google had 91.9 percent of market share (as of January 2022) and there are over 99,000 Google searches a second! Not everyone knows, however, that Google (and its offshoot Google Scholar) also offers the option to use a variety of boolean operators that make precise searching possible. There's a useful list of these on this page.

What they say: It began as a simple idea back in the summer of 1999: a single score could summarize the many entertainment reviews available for a movie or a video game. Metacritic's three founding members - all former attorneys who were happy to find a more constructive but less profitable use of their time - launched the site in January 2001 and Metacritic has evolved over the last decade to reflect their experience distilling many critics' voices into the single Metascore, a weighted average of the most respected critics writing reviews online and in print.

Metacritic's mission is to help consumers make an informed decision about how to spend their time and money on entertainment. We believe that multiple opinions are better than one, user voices can be as important as critics, and opinions must be scored to be easy to use.

From Wikipedia: Yahoo! Search is a Yahoo! internet search provider that uses Microsoft's Bing search engine to power results, since 2009, apart [from] four years with Google until 2019.

Originally, "Yahoo! Search" referred to a Yahoo!-provided interface that sent queries to a searchable index of pages supplemented with its directory of websites. The results were presented to the user under the Yahoo! brand. Originally, none of the actual web crawling and data housing was done by Yahoo! itself. In 2001, the searchable index was powered by Inktomi and later by Google until 2004, when Yahoo! Search became independent. On July 29, 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would henceforth power Yahoo! Search.
