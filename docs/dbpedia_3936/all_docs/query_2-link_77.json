        "text": "Founded by Gabriel Weinberg in 2008, DuckDuckGo has earned itself a name as a non-profit search engine.\n\nIf Google highlights the personalized search experience as its USP, DuckDuckGo does the opposite.\n\nIt’s known that Google gives a personalized search experience at the cost of taking advantage of your user data.\n\nThis is exactly what DuckDuckGo doesn’t do.\n\nIt doesn’t collect your data, and as a result, the search results remain the same for you and your friends.\n\nDuckDuckGo has several features, including maps, weather, news, images, videos, local business answers, products and shopping, flight information, calculator, sports score, currency conversion and much more.\n\nIn addition to these, this search engine also offers language and region localization, customizable themes and shortcut commands that can take you to other websites directly. The search engine also has apps and extensions that allow you to use browsers like Chrome and Safari without being tracked.\n\nAccording to the official source, the search results provided by DuckDuckGo are generated from 400 different sources (algorithms), including Yahoo! Search, Search BOSS, Wolfram Alpha, Bing, Yandex, Wikipedia, and its own Web crawler (the DuckDuckBot), and others.\n\nDuckDuckGo has raised $13 million in funds.\n\nDuckDuckGo users made over 96.97 million search queries in November 2022. It holds 0.58% of the search engine market share worldwide and in the U.S, it holds 2.2% of the search engine market share. The DuckDuckGo Chrome extension app has over six million users.\n\nThe way DuckDuckGo is progressing makes us think about the humble beginnings of Google.\n\nOver the years, DuckDuckGo has grown at a steady pace. However, things started a little wobbly for this Google alternative search engine starting in 2022.\n\nIn January 2022, this privacy-focused search engine completed 100 billion searches. The Twitter account of the search engine thanked its users for the 100 billion all-time private searches.\n\nHere’s a look at DuckGoDuck’s search trends for 2021.\n\nJanuary 2021: 106 million daily searches\n\nFebruary 2021: 105.5 million daily searches\n\nMarch 2021: 102.7 million daily searches\n\nApril 2021: 97.7 million daily searches\n\nMay 2021: 96.2 million daily searches\n\nJune 2021: 93.8 million daily searches\n\nJuly 2021: 92,4 million daily searches\n\nAugust 2021: 93.7 million daily searches\n\nSeptember 2021: 94.7 million daily searches\n\nOctober 2021: : 93.7 million daily searches\n\nAs you can see the traffic that cross the 100 million mark in January 2021, started declining and this is believed to have continued till June.\n\nWhen we went back to the public page of DuckDuckGo that shared these details earlier, we found that it no more exists.\n\nHowever, based on the data retrieved from Web Archive,it looks like the traffic plateaued and have never again touched the 100 million mark.\n\nWith this obviously steady decline in searches, the SEO community is speculating if the search engine isn’t competing with Google anymore.\n\nHowever, it may be too early to jump to conclusions, and we’ll have to wait and watch what happens in the months to come.\n\nThe reason behind this increased popularity is the growing concern over privacy. Because of this, enterprises like Google and Apple had to block third-party cookies from tracking the users.\n\nPrivacy has been the primary focus of DuckDuckGo from the start, and it is because of this that they have managed to reach this milestone.\n\nCompared to Google, this success might seem modest. However, the success of DuckDuckGo has paved the way for other search engines that concentrate on an underserved user base.\n\nSlowly, these search engines are chipping away at Google’s dominance in the search engine market.\n\nEven though DuckDuckGo still has miles to go before it can challenge Google, it is gradually closing on other popular search engines like Yahoo! and Bing."
