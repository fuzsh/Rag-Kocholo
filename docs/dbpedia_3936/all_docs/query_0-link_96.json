        "text": "Bing\n\nWhat is Bing?\n\nBing – A web search engine that provides search services for web, video, image and map search products. Bing is owned and operated by Microsoft, and is powers Yahoo! Search. Bing now controls approximately >20% of the search share.\n\nBing is a web search engine owned and operated by Microsoft. The service has its origins in Microsoft’s previous search engines: MSN Search, Windows Live Search and later Live Search. Bing provides a variety of search services, including web, video, image and map search products. It is developed using ASP.NET.\n\nBing, Microsoft’s replacement for Live Search, was unveiled by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on May 28, 2009, at the All Things Digital conference in San Diego, California, for release on June 3, 2009Notable new features at the time included the listing of search suggestions while queries are entered and a list of related searches (called “Explorer pane”) based on semantic technology from Powerset which Microsoft had acquired in 2008.\n\nIn July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo! announced a deal in which Bing would power Yahoo! Search. All Yahoo! Search global customers and partners made the transition by early 2012. The deal was altered in 2015, meaning Yahoo! was only required to use Bing for a “majority” of searches.\n\nIn October 2011, Microsoft stated that it was working on a new back-end search infrastructure with the goal of delivering faster and slightly more relevant search results for users. Known as “Tiger”, the new index-serving technology had been incorporated into Bing globally since August that year. In May 2012, Microsoft announced another redesign of its search engine that includes “Sidebar”, a social feature that searches users’ social networks for information relevant to the search query.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAs of October 2018, Bing is the third largest search engine globally, with a query volume of 4.58%, behind Google (77%) and Baidu (14.45%). Yahoo! Search, which Bing largely powers, has 2.63%.\n\nUsing Microsoft Seach\n\nIf you decide to deploy Microsoft Search in Bing in your organization, we recommend that you at least send an email to your users to explain the reason behind the upcoming change, the benefits of using Bing to search workplace information, and when they can expect to see the change occur.\n\nYou can also make use of the Microsoft Search in Bing Adoption Kit, which includes email communication templates, customizable posters, Adoption Success Guide, and more. There is also a user adoption guide to help you prepare.\n\nThere are tools for Microsoft Search that you can use to provide a better search experience for your users so that your users can find the content that they’re looking for more easily. For example, you can do the following:\n\nCreate bookmarks for frequently searched internal web sites and tools, such as employee benefits, time and expense reporting, and self-help IT services.\n\nCreate Q&As to instantly answer frequently asked questions in your company, such as “How do I change my password?” or “How do I create a purchase order?”\n\nAdd building locations or upload office floor plans to help your users navigate large company campuses with ease.\n\nDefine acronyms that are commonly used within your organization.\n\nConclusion\n\nIs your company in need of help?
