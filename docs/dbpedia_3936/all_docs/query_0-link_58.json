This verb has thus become a synonym for Internet research and the company or search engine Google is, in principle, known to most people. But there are alternative search engines.\n\nEcosia, Startpage, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo or Nona are certainly the better known alternatives to Google. But for almost every search there is a suitable search engine.\n\nFor example, in the scientific field there is the website https://worldwidescience.org. With this search engine, more than 200 million documents from about ten countries, including Germany, can be found.\n\nIf you are looking for current news from daily and weekly newspapers, you will find what you are looking for at https://paperball.news, for example.\n\nWe have compiled a list of 44 alternatives to Google here:"
