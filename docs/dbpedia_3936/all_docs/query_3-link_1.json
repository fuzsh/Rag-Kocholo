Metacritic's three founding members - all former attorneys who were happy to find a more constructive but less profitable use of their time - launched the site in January 2001 and Metacritic has evolved over the last decade to reflect their experience distilling many critics' voices into the single Metascore, a weighted average of the most respected critics writing reviews online and in print.\n\nMetacritic's mission is to help consumers make an informed decision about how to spend their time and money on entertainment. We believe that multiple opinions are better than one, user voices can be as important as critics, and opinions must be scored to be easy to use.\n\nSelect Metacritic\n\nBack to search page (home)\n\nWhat they say: PubMed is a free resource supporting the search and retrieval of biomedical and life sciences literature with the aim of improving health - both globally and personally.\n\nThe PubMed database contains more than 34 million citations and abstracts of biomedical literature.
