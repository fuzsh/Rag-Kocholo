        "text": "For some Brave users who downloaded the Brave browser on October 19, 2021 or later, Brave Search will be automatically set as the default search engine. Simply conduct a search in the address bar of any Brave browser tab. Learn more.\n\nAll other users can set Brave Search as the default search engine in Brave or most other major browsers, and then search from the address bar of any browser tab. To check the default search engine in the Brave Browser, open the settings page at brave://settings/search.\n\nYou can also use Brave Search by visiting search.brave.com from any browser.\n\nYes. We do not believe in walled gardens, so you can set Brave Search as the default search engine in most major browsers. Or visit search.brave.com.\n\nWe also offer API access to Brave Search so it can power other search engines.\n\nBrave Search is available in US and UK English, as well as French, German, and Japanese. Weâll be adding support for more languages soon, so check back often to see when private, independent search is available in your language.\n\nNote that if you live in the US, UK, France, or Germany and you downloaded the Brave Browser on October 19, 2021 or later, Brave Search may already be the default search engine. You can change the default search engine for the Brave Browser, or change the default language for Brave Search at any time.\n\nBrave Search is ad supported and, unlike other search providers, our ads adhere to the principle of privacy-first. Ultimately, our vision is to expand the Brave Ads ecosystem to include search ads that reward users for viewing them. But this is still a work in progress; for now, Brave Search ads are not eligible for Brave Rewards. We hope to have more news on this in the coming months.\n\nUsers who want to support the Brave Search mission, and get an ad-free experience, can upgrade to Brave Search Premium.\n\nFirst, and most important, Brave Search adheres to core principles of privacy. We donât track you, your searches, or your clicks. Ever. This is far different from the vast majority of search providers, who siphon up every piece of data about your search behavior, and tie it directly to you.\n\nSecond, Brave Search operates from a fully independent search index. An index is the list of billions of web pages, and some basic info about those pages, that search engines draw from to deliver search results. Most search enginesâeven supposedly âneutralâ or âprivateâ onesâdonât do this. Theyâre just faÃ§ades that rely exclusively on third-parties for their results. If Big Tech suddenly ceased to function, those other search operators would go offline. Brave Search, meanwhile, would stay fully operational.\n\nIndependence means choice: for usersâand for Braveâto be safer online, and not be beholden to the privacy invasions, censorship, biases, or economic interests of Big Tech.\n\nNo, Brave Search does not filter, downrank, or censor search results. Nor will we change our search algorithm to increase or decrease the prominence of results in response to current events or anyoneâs political, religious, ethical, or other beliefs. Brave Searchâlike Brave itselfâis intended to be a user-first portal to the Web, free of Big Techâs manipulation.\n\nHowever, there is one exception to this rule: We do need to comply with laws governing search engines, including CSAM, copyright takedown (DMCA), right to be forgotten (GDPR), and nation-state orders.\n\nAlso note that, if you’ve chosen to enable it, Brave Search can check Google for fallback mixing in your browser. If you’ve enabled fallback mixing, and a result is censored, filtered, or re-ranked in Google, those changes would pass through to our results. You can easily see how often a third-party result is mixed (via our independence score), and our aim is to gradually reduce this mixing over time.\n\nGoggles is a beta feature of Brave Search. Goggles enable anyone, or any community of people, to create sets of rules and filters to constrain the searchable space and / or alter the ordering of results. Anyone could then choose to apply a Goggleâor extend itâto their view of Brave Search results. Essentially, Goggles will act as a re-ranking option on top of the Brave Search index.\n\nThis means that, instead of a single ranking, Brave Search can offer an almost limitless number of ranking options, enabling search use-cases that could be too specific for an all-purpose search engine. While Brave Search doesn’t have editorial biases, all search engines have some level of intrinsic bias. Goggles allows users to counter this intrinsic bias in the ranking algorithm.\n\nTo access Goggles, simply conduct a search at search.brave.com, and then click the Goggles tab on the results page. Or you can visit the Goggles landing page.\n\nRead the full white paper about Goggles.\n\nVisit the GitHub repo to make your own Goggles.\n\nThe Web Discovery Project is a privacy-preserving way for you to contribute to the growth and independence of Brave Search. If you opt in, youâll contribute some anonymous data about searches and web page visits made within the Brave Browser (including pages arrived at via some, but not all, other search engines). This data helps build the Brave Search independent index, and ensure we show results relevant to your search queries. By “data” we mean search queries, search result clicks, the URLs of pages visited in the browser, time spent on those pages, and some metadata about the pages themselves. Learn more.\n\nTo opt in, open the Settings menu in the Brave browser. Select Search engine on the left panel, and then toggle on Web Discovery Project. You can opt out again at any time.\n\nThe Brave Search answer engine (available on the search results page via the “Answer with AI” button) is an AI-powered feature in Brave Search that provides users concise and to-the-point answers at the top of Brave Search results pages. These summaries are based solely on Web search results, and information sources are always cited to help users assess trustworthiness.\n\nBrave Search has used AI and large-language models (LLMs) for several years. The Answer with AI feature is the most recent of multiple AI developments integrated to improve search relevance. Learn more about Summarizer and the use of AI in Brave Search."
