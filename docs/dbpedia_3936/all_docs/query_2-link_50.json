        "text": "Google and Bing are two of the most well-known search engines today, but that doesn’t make them alike. When you think about how people seek information nowadays – on a computer or smartphone screen – it’s important to understand just where your company stands among its competitors because customers will base what they see next largely upon which website came up first when Googling for said product/service you offer!\n\nSo far, Google has become the preferred search engine in many Western countries. As a result, Bing has expended considerable effort to keep up with this colossus.\n\nDespite Google’s dominance, Bing has made significant strides in improving its search algorithms and user experience, aiming to carve out its own niche in the highly competitive search engine market. However, Google’s vast user base and innovative features continue to pose a formidable challenge for Bing’s aspirations.\n\nWhat is Microsoft Bing?\n\n“Bingbot uses an algorithm to determine which sites to crawl, how often, and how many pages to fetch from each site. The goal is to minimize bing bot crawl footprint on your websites while ensuring that the freshest content is available.”\n\nOver view of Microsoft Bing\n\nMicrosoft first launched the Bing.com search engine in 2006. Before being renamed Bing in 2009, it was known as Windows Live Search.\n\nWindows Live Search was initially launched to compete with Google’s search engine.\n\nFollowing the launch of Bing, the first and most significant update was dubbed “Tiger.” It is worth noting that, in comparison to Google, Bing.com’s algorithm is not updated regularly. This is critical because changes in the algorithm can have an impact on your website’s ranking.\n\nGoogle; The search Engine\n\nGoogle organic search is responsible for 59.2% of the world’s web traffic (Sparktoro)\n\nThis search engine was developed in 1998 by a search firm with the primary goal of analyzing backlinks authority. Google has expanded to provide more than 50 internet services over the years.\n\nIts initial service (backlinks) helped propel Google to its current position as the industry leader. Google’s algorithm changes more frequently than Bing’s. This includes everything from significant updates to minor tweaks. As a result, Google’s search engine page remains as good as it can be.\n\n“The Google Search index contains hundreds of billions of webpages and is well over 100,000,000 gigabytes in size.”\n\n– Google\n\nMarket Share and Features\n\nGoogle is an absolute powerhouse that dominates the global search engine industry.\n\nBetween June 2019 and June 2020, Google had 91.75 percent of the global search share. Bing came in second with 2.75 percent. During this time period, other search engines such as DuckDuckGo and Yahoo had less than 40% of Bing’s market share.\n\nHowever, there is no difference between Google and Bing in terms of basic search functions. Both can help with text, video, image, and map searches, as well as a shopping feature and news feed. However, there is no difference between Google and Bing in terms of essential search functions. Both can help with text, video, image, and map searches, as well as a shopping feature and news feed.\n\nThe difference between Bing and Microsoft Google’s Functionality\n\nBoth the search engines are similar, but Google offers more core features.\n\nBing and Google with Different Principles\n\nWhile they both serve the same purpose, there are some significant differences between these two search engines. Even though the two search engines offer paid advertising to their users and use very similar ranking principles, the organic results for the exact phrase will be drastically different if you search for it in each of them.\n\nTechnical SEO\n\nDifferent technical factors have been explained in both Bing and Google’s ranking algorithms, from site speed to mobile-friendliness.\n\nAs a result, as you invest in optimizing the site’s behind-the-scenes structure and its on-page technical SEO. This implies that you will almost certainly receive positive search results from both Bing and Google.\n\nEven so, there are a few discrepancies between these factors that many people consider to be important.\n\nOrganic Search\n\nThe algorithms used by Bing and Google are opposed. They, however, seek out content that is best suited to the needs of the users. As a result, if you optimize for both Bing and Google, there will be significant overlap. Therefore, brands must prioritize high-quality content.\n\nBing prefers established content that has received a significant amount of traffic or has been online for a long period of time. This preference is also reflected in Bing’s choice for official top-level domains such as.edu and.gov. Google, on the other hand, values popular or even commercial websites equally.\n\nComparing their results is essential even if you can’t optimize your website for both search engines based on these preferences.\n\nOff-Page SEO\n\nIt is worth noting that Google’s ranking system began as a Ph.D. project called BackRub. In this project, backlinks were used to establish relative site authority. Nonetheless, Google’s primary method of ranking websites remains backlink analysis. As a result, the more links your website has, the more authoritative it is overall. The more prominent it appears in search results, the better.\n\nEven if backlinks are still a ranking factor, Bing places less emphasis on them. Although backlinks are important for Google SEO, several significant similarities exist between how both search engines treat backlinks. When determining authority, both search engines consider the number of links and their relevance and quality.\n\nMobile-First Indexing by Google\n\nIt is critical to understand that Google ranks and indexes your website using a mobile version. As a result, all metadata and mobile content must be fully optimized to match the desktop version.\n\nAccording to a recent announcement, the mobile-first indexing approach will be implemented on all sites by the end of 2020. If your site still has a mobile version, it is critical that it is properly optimized. Furthermore, wherever possible, enhance the mobile user experience.\n\nMaps\n\nGoogle Maps and Bing Maps are both critical components of Google and Bing, respectively. These map functions are widely used, so they have become central to Google and Bing’s offerings.\n\nOn the surface, it appears that Google Maps and Bing Maps have few visual differences in their user interfaces. Both map functions include a knowledge panel with information about a business or the area. The most noticeable difference between Google Maps and Bing Maps is in the directions that each provides. In addition, the estimated travel time and route information differ between the two web mapping services.\n\nIt appears that Google provides slightly longer estimates: with this disparity, Google tends to add about 3-5 percent to a Bing-provided estimated journey time.\n\nVoice Search\n\nVoice search has quickly emerged as the newest digital obsession. According to Social Media Today, nearly half of people now use voice search for product research, with Google recording a 35x increase in voice searches since 2008.\n\nGoogle launched its home devices in mid-2017. This helped them make up ground lost to Bing, which was undeniably the voice search feature frontrunner. Nonetheless, Amazon maintains a 70 percent market share in the home speaker market. This, in turn, helped propel Bing into the spotlight.\n\nThis functionality gave Bing a huge opportunity, allowing it to gain visibility from previously covered points. As a result, consider how your customers’ interactions with your brand will change as you optimize your website for voice search.\n\nWhich is Better – Bing or Google?\n\nDespite the fact that Google is the undisputed leader in search engines, Bing is constantly improving. There is an increasing number of issues concerning privacy, corporate responsibility, and business ethics. As a result, Google may lose market share to Bing and other similar competitors in the future.\n\nBing and Google are only a tiny portion of the search engines available for general internet usage. However, if you develop a better understanding of the two, advertisers can capture the lion’s share of internet searches. As a result, both platforms have value.\n\nAs a PPC agency that offers expert digital marketing services, we recommend utilizing both platforms as an integrated digital marketing solution. Each search engine, as previously stated, has its own set of advantages, disadvantages, and target audiences. As a result, sites will frequently achieve the best overall performance by combining the two while serving their ads to different user groups."
