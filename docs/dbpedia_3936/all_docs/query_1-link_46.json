        "text": "PHP Example - AJAX Live Search\n\nAJAX can be used to create more user-friendly and interactive searches.\n\nAJAX Live Search\n\nThe following example will demonstrate a live search, where you get search results while you type.\n\nLive search has many benefits compared to traditional searching:\n\nResults are shown as you type\n\nResults narrow as you continue typing\n\nIf results become too narrow, remove characters to see a broader result\n\nSearch for a W3Schools page in the input field below:\n\nThe results in the example above are found in an XML file (links.xml). To make this example small and simple, only six results are available.\n\nExample Explained - The HTML Page\n\nWhen a user types a character in the input field above, the function \"showResult()\" is executed. The function is triggered by the \"onkeyup\" event:\n\nSource code explanation:\n\nIf the input field is empty (str.length==0), the function clears the content of the livesearch placeholder and exits the function.\n\nIf the input field is not empty, the showResult() function executes the following:\n\nCreate an XMLHttpRequest object\n\nCreate the function to be executed when the server response is ready\n\nSend the request off to a file on the server\n\nNotice that a parameter (q) is added to the URL (with the content of the input field)\n\nThe PHP File\n\nThe page on the server called by the JavaScript above is a PHP file called \"livesearch.php\".\n\nThe source code in \"livesearch.php\" searches an XML file for titles matching the search string and returns the result:\n\nIf there is any text sent from the JavaScript (strlen($q) > 0), the following happens:\n\nLoad an XML file into a new XML DOM object\n\nLoop through all <title> elements to find matches from the text sent from the JavaScript\n\nSets the correct url and title in the \"$response\" variable. If more than one match is found, all matches are added to the variable\n\nIf no matches are found, the $response variable is set to \"no suggestion\""
