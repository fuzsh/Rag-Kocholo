        "text": "Google isnât the only search engine that can satisfy your search query. Sure, the search engine giant wins the most popular search option with its market dominance and the most daily searches (at a whopping 3.5 billion).Â\n\nBut many Google alternative search engines donât fall far behind. Plus, some even outperform dear old Google when it comes to privacy, eco-friendliness, ethical initiatives, and specialized search results that are niche-down.\n\nHere are the best alternative search engines you should try (instead of always relying on Google, the spymaster).Â\n\n17 alternative search engines to use\n\nThere are various other alternative search engines to Google that can meet your search intent, whether you are looking for information, music, rich results, and more.Â\n\nOf course, one of the main reasons for using an alternative search engine to Google is that the search giant has become a tracking company with all its intrusive ads, logging your search history and user data when you use the companyâs services, like Gmail.\n\nOf course, you consent to all this, and itâs stated in Googleâs privacy policy and terms of Service.Â Â Â\n\nOpt for one of these other search engines to manage your data better and keep it secure.Â\n\n1. You.com\n\nBest for: AI-powered searchesÂ\n\nYou.com is one of the latest AI-powered search engines to join the fray. It was created in 2020.\n\nThe search engine uses natural language processing (NLP) to rank relevant results, understand the search queries, and answer queries in various languages.Â\n\nWith You.com, create an account and opt for:Â\n\nPersonal mode: Customize your search preferences with 150+ apps (or sources) and decide how safe the search should be, which region you want results from, and how recent the results should be. You can also upvote, downvote, and block apps to further tailor your search.Â Â Â Â\n\nPrivate mode: Everything in Personal + enjoy a completely âxero tracesâ experience with no collection of telemetry data.Â Â\n\nYou.com is particularly helpful because itâs one of the best search engines with an AI-powered chatbot called YouChat.\n\nYou can also use YouWrite to write content, YouImagine to create AI images, Code Complete to help with a coding query, or YouCode to find the best code examples.\n\nIf you need assistance with You.com, check out the online community on Discord, the Getting Started guide, the Help Center, or the blog.Â Â Â Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nAd-free!Â\n\nPrivacy centered, especially when you use Private ModeÂ Â\n\nYou.com works on a desktop browser, and there is an app for iOS and Android usersÂ Â\n\nExtensions are available for your favorite browserÂ Â\n\nYou.com aims to provide unbiased search resultsÂ\n\nDeveloper portal allows developers to create apps and moreÂ Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nYou.com has a freemium and paid version. YouPro costs $9.99 per month and gives you access to unlimited GPT-4-powered chat, AI image and photo generation.Â Â\n\n2. DuckDuckGo\n\nBest for: Enhanced security and private browsingÂ\n\nIn an age where data privacy is becoming increasingly important, there has been a surge in the popularity of privacy-focused search engines.\n\nThese search engines prioritize user privacy, ensuring your search engine queries are not tracked or stored, thus providing a more secure browsing experience.\n\nDuckDuckGo, launched in 2008, is a well-established privacy-focused metasearch engine.\n\nWithin five years, it reached the milestone of 1 billion web searches. Currently, DuckDuckGo performs 3 billion monthly searches.\n\nThe metasearch engine compiles its search results from more than 400 sources, including Yahoo, Yandex, Wikipedia, Bing, and DuckDuckBot (its own indexer or web crawler).\n\nDuckDuckGo is committed to ensuring your personal information stays private and doesnât share your details with these sources.Â\n\nIt doesnât collect information like your IP address or other unique identifiers, so your search results aren't personalized (like what Google spits out).\n\nInstead, the unbiased search engine results are the same for every user - when itâs uncustomized on your end.Â\n\nDuckDuckGo blocks most third-party cookies and trackers.\n\nFor example, not all tracking is disabled by default because of DuckDuckGoâs agreement with Microsoft to use Bing. You can, however, ensure that bat.bing.com doesnât track you by disabling ads.Â\n\nAlso, DuckDuckGO is U.S.-based, meaning itâs subject to mass surveillance programs such as PRISM. And the U.S. is part of the Five Eyes, a multi-country intelligence-sharing alliance.\n\nLearn more about DuckDuckGo by visiting the Help Center.Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nHas features like Maps, Weather, News, Images, Videos, and more (similar to Google)Â Â\n\n!Bang shortcuts to quickly search a specific website (e.g. â!wâ to search Wikipedia or â!ebay for Ebay search results)Â Â\n\nCan set themes and further customize search by setting the region, language, instant answers via DuckAssist, infinite scroll, autocomplete suggestions, and moreÂ Â\n\nApps and extensions for Chrome, Edge, Opera, Firefox, and SafariÂ\n\nUse DuckDuckGo Lite or the app for mobile searchÂ Â Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nDuckDuckGo is 100% free.Â Â\n\n3. Qwant\n\nBest for: Privacy and musicÂ\n\nQwant is another Google alternative search engine thatâs focused on user privacy and their search experience. It was created in 2013 and is based in France.\n\nWhile Qwant is General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant and does what it can to protect your privacy, it is part of the Nine Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance.Â\n\nThe reliable search engine doesnât track your search history, build or sell personal profiles, track cookies, or serve targeted ads.\n\nAs a result, you get unfiltered search engine results, so you arenât trapped in a filter bubble. And the ads are based on your search queries, not your personal profile.Â\n\nQwant has its own indexing engine, and with Bing, it compiles search results. While it shares some user data with Microsoft, like your IP address, search terms, and browser details, Qwant is taking steps to anonymize this information.Â Â Â Â\n\nOptimize your usage of Qwant by checking out the Help Center, Why Qwant? page, or Better Web blog.Â\n\nQwant has a specific music search engine to help you find music you love.Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nQwant Search, Qwant Maps, Shadow Drive, and VIPrivacy add-on (to block trackers),Â\n\nQwant Junior so the little humans can safely search the internetÂ\n\nHas a quick search function (use â&,â a dedicated shortcode or website name, and your search term) to see specific results (e.g. â&wâ or â&wikipediaâ for Wikipedia search results)Â\n\nCustomize your search by choosing the interface language, appearance, theme, home page character, region, and moreÂ\n\nCurrent news below the search bar so you can stay updated with world happeningsÂ Â\n\nUse the Qwant mobile app for your iOS or Android smart devicesÂ Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nQwant is free.Â Â\n\n4. Brave Search\n\nBest for: AI summaries and privacyÂ\n\nBrave Search, launched by U.S.-based Brave Software in 2021, is a privacy based search engine that focuses on transparency.\n\nThe search engine uses a âbuilt-from-scratchâ index, so it doesnât rely on third-party data from other search engines to compile search results.Â\n\nWhen you open the homepage, the search engine states, \"Brave Search uses private usage metrics to estimate overall activity and performance. You can turn off this option in settings. Â\n\nIf you opt in, this information isnât linked to your identity.Â\n\nThe search engine doesnât track or store your personal details, IP address, or search history.\n\nHowever, you can allow Brave Search to anonymously use your IP address (which isnât shared or stored) to see local search results (e.g., best laundromat near me).\n\nSearch results are unfiltered, and on the freemium version, ads are non-personalized.Â Â Â Â\n\nBrave Search also blocks third-party trackers and cookies and offers HTTPS by default.Â\n\nLike DuckDuckGo, Brave Search can be subject to intelligence sharing (thanks to the Five Eyes alliance) and mass surveillance programs.Â\n\nWhile thereâs no online community or academy, check out the Transparency Report, Brave Search Help, and Status for more information about this search engine.Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nOffers various other products, such as Brave Search API, Brave Browser, Brave News, Brave Firewall + VPN, Brave Wallet, and Brave TalkÂ\n\nAI-powered Summarizer to get short, fast answers to your queriesÂ Â\n\nCustomize search by appearance, unit of measurement, language, and regionÂ Â Â\n\nOpt in for Discussions to see conversations from Reddit and the like about your search queryÂ Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nBrave Search is free, but you can also access more features on Brave Search Premium for $3 per month. Paying a subscription gives you ad-free search results and a cleaner SERP view.Â Â Â\n\n5. MetaGer\n\nBest for: Independent search results and transparencyÂ\n\nMetaGer is an environmentally conscious web search engine (run on 100% renewable energy) and was created by the SUMA-EV-Association for Free Access to Knowledge, a German-based non-profit organization.Â\n\nThe metasearch engine was launched in 1996 and uses 24 small-scale web crawlers and aggregate results from various platforms, such as Brave Search, Scopia, Yahoo, Bing, OneNewspage, and more.\n\nSearch results are unbiased and unfiltered since click-through rate isnât a factor when processing a query.Â Â Â Â Â\n\nWhile MetaGer keeps your full IP address for 96 hours and shares a part of your IP address and other non-identifying metadata with advertisers, it doesnât track or store other personal data.\n\nAds are not based on personal details, so they arenât targeted at you specifically. One benefit of using MetaGer is that the company is transparent about using and collecting user data.Â\n\nIt's good to know that Germany is a member of the Fourteen Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance and that GDPR protects your data.\n\nLearn more about how MetaGer works from their Transparency Statement, MetaGer source code, and Help center.Â Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nSearch the Web, Images, News, or Science\n\nCustomize your search preferences according to safe search, date, language, and moreÂ Â Â Â\n\nBlacklist domains you want excluded from your search resultsÂ Â\n\nUse the MetaGer plugin or appÂ Â\n\nOther tools include TOR-Hidden Service, MetaGer Widget, Associator (to get a list of associated search terms to help you get more accurate search results), and Citation SearchÂ Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nYou can use MetaGer for free or buy a MetaGer key and tokens for an ad-free experience. A 1,000 tokens (Â±$10) may last you four months.Â Â\n\nYou can also donate or become a member of the SUMA-EV Association for Free Access to Knowledge.Â Â Â\n\n6. Yep.com\n\nBest for: Privacy and rewards for content creatorsÂ\n\nYep.com is a search engine created by Ahrefs in mid 2022.\n\nAhrefs' bot has been crawling the internet since 2010, so it had all the data needed to run a search engine.\n\nSince Yep isnât reliant on third-party search indexes, it doesnât have to share your search query or other information with these third-party services.\n\nThe search engine doesnât store or share your IP address, search history, or user-agent strings. And while it does save some data, itâs not in a way that can identify you.Â Â Â Â\n\nWhile it focuses on user privacy, it also rewards content creators with its 90/10 revenue-sharing business model (thatâs right, 90% of ad revenue goes to the creators).\n\nYep doesnât want to earn more revenue from the content (via ads like Google does) than the creators and publishers.\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nSearch the whole web, or just get image or news resultsÂ Â\n\nCustomize search according to your preferred language and the toolâs appearanceÂ Â\n\nCan set Yep as your default search engineÂ Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nYou donât pay a penny to use Yep.com.Â Â\n\n7.

You can even tailor SearX for your own needs and host it on your companyâs server as your own search tool.Â Â\n\nFind important information about SearX, how to create a custom engine module, and more on the About Page.Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nAdvanced settings for search queriesÂ\n\nCustomize your search preferences according to search and interface languages, autocomplete, themes, style, and other features for engines, plugins, answerers, and cookiesÂ Â Â\n\nOpen source so that you can improve your own (and otherâs) search experienceÂ Â\n\nChoose from which engines you want your search resultsÂ Â\n\nSet it as your default search engine, or add SearX to your browser's search bar\n\nNo adsÂ Â Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nSearX is free to use.Â Â\n\n8.

You can also disable cookies, which Ecosia is transparent about.Â\n\nAfter all, Ecosia wants trees - not your data.Â Â Â Â\n\nSince Ecosia is based in Germany and uses Bing as well as its own search index, it provides GDPR protection, especially for European servers.\n\nGermany is part of the Fourteen Eyes intelligence-sharing initiative.Â\n\nCheck out their blog and financial reports to learn more about this eco-conscious search engine.Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nHelp plant trees by searching on this CO2-neutral search engineÂ Â\n\nAdd the Ecosia extension to your browser for quick search functionalityÂ Â Â\n\nUse Ecosiaâs mobile app to search on the goÂ Â\n\nCustomize your search preferences by setting the search region, website language, safe search, theme, auto suggestions, and moreÂ Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nEcosia is free, but you can gift a tree.Â Â\n\n13.

Baidu\n\nBest for: The Chinese-speaking marketÂ\n\nBaidu is a Mandarin-language web search engine founded in 2000.\n\nIt serves Chinese and Mandarin-speaking people around the globe. Search results are tailored specifically for the Chinese market as content hosted on Chinese servers is prioritized and ranks higher on the SERPs.Â Â Â\n\nThe search engine is like a carbon copy of Google search: Its interface is also minimalistic; itâs also monetized through ads, and when you run a search, you also get rich snippets.\n\nIn some circles, Baidu is called the âGoogle of China.â Google is banned in China (unless you have a VPN).Â\n\nServices that Baidu offers include:Â\n\nMapsÂ\n\nVideosÂ\n\nAn app storeÂ\n\nMusicÂ\n\nAI and voice-assisted searchÂ Â\n\nBaidu is heavily censored, as some images and pro-democracy sites are blocked.

Mojeek\n\nBest for: Unbiased search results and customizabilityÂ Â\n\nMojeek, a U.K.-based independent crawler-based search engine founded in 2004, believes in putting its users first.\n\nIt has its own search algorithms and a crawler called the MojeekBot, that indexes the web. Itâs indexed more than 6 billion pages so far.Â Â\n\nWhile MojeekBot isnât censored, it avoids crawling malware, content designed for game search engines, and Child Sexual Abuse Materials (CSAM).Â\n\nKnow that your privacy is valued when you use Mojeek.\n\nItâs the first search engine with a non-tracking privacy policy.\n\nWhile Mojeek displays ads, they are contextual and not based on your search history or personal data.Â\n\nFor help, check out Mojeekâs support page or blog, or subscribe to the Mojeek newsletter.Â\n\nKey FeaturesÂ\n\nWeb, images, news, or substack, emotions searchÂ Â\n\nUse Mojeek Focus to define and control your search enginesÂ Â\n\nAdd Mojeek to your browser or use the mobile appÂ Â\n\nCan turn off the Infobox (results from Wikipedia on the SERPs)Â Â\n\nCustomize search by choosing from which search engines (other than or in addition to Mojeek) you want results fromÂ\n\nYou can also tailor other search features, like the appearance of Mojeek, the location, language, and privacy settingsÂ\n\nOther Mojeek products you can use are Mojeek Ads, Web Search API, Site Search API, and Simple Search BoxesÂ Â\n\nCostÂ\n\nMojeek is free.Â Â\n\nWhy use alternative search engines?\n\nThe main reason for using a different search engine is to protect your data's privacy since other search engines donât collect, process, or store your personal data as heavily as Google and other popular search platforms.\n\nUsing the same search query on different search engines can yield different results across platforms. This can be particularly helpful if you're looking to optimize your SEO strategy on different search platforms.\n\nThere are search engines dedicated to specific research needs like academics and science.\n\nUsing these platforms can help you discover new resources that Google or Bing will not uncover efficiently.\n\nAnother reason to use alternative search engines to Google and Bing is that some search engines offer an ad-free browsing experience focusing on privacy and a cleaner user interface.\n\nIf you're particularly concerned with data privacy, it's a good idea to use a privacy-focused search engine\n\nUsing ethical or philanthropically aligned search platforms can support their initiatives that align with your values.\n\nWhat is the best search engine excluding Google?\n\nGoogle is the biggest search engine, but the best alternative search engine is Bing, which ranks second in terms of popularity. Bing offers rewards programs, search preference customization, visual search, Bing Chat, and integration with your other Office 365 products.Â\n\nWhat is the best search engine for privacy?\n\nDuckDuckGo is the best privacy-focused search engine because it offers enhanced security and the same search results for everyone. The search engine doesnât collect or store your search data or other private information and blocks most third-party trackers and cookies.Â\n\nConclusion\n\nYou can choose from multiple search engines if you donât want to use Google. Popular alternatives include DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo!, Swisscows, Ecosia, and Mojeek.Â\n\nOpt to use one of these alternatives to ensure your private information stays private. Or enjoy search results that arenât geo-targeted or profile-based on the search engineâs bias.Â\n\nAlternatively, explore other ways to search, use the unique resources from these unbiased search engines, or give back to the environment by âplanting treesâ as you search.Â\n\nWhich alternative search engine is your favorite?Â"
