        "text": "Ten years ago today, I first starting writing publicly about search engines.\n\nIf we had blogs back then, I suppose I would have been a search blogger. But we\n\ndidn‚Äôt. We hand-coded our HTML, walked through the snow for eight miles to FTP\n\nfiles to our web servers, and we liked it üôÇ\n\nMy involvement with search engines goes back to my first year as a student\n\nat the University Of California, Irvine in 1983. No, I wasn‚Äôt part of the\n\nuniversity‚Äôs highly regarded information and computer science department.\n\nInstead, I was an English major ‚Äî and a pretty bored one for my first two\n\nmonths, when I had to commute until getting on-campus housing.\n\nI spent some time exploring the library, having been a big library user since\n\nI was a child. The library had a magical electronic card catalog called\n\nMelvyl (named\n\nfor Melvil Dewey, who created the Dewey Decimal System). For fun, I‚Äôd do Melvyl\n\nsearches for broad topics such as history, art or love, to see how many matches\n\nwould come back. I could routinely crash the search routine by doing this.\n\nThe system would diligently try, telling me it would take 50, 60, 80 search\n\ncycles, and then the countdown would begin. Some searches would eventually get\n\nthrough all cycles and give me a matching results count. Often, the system would\n\njust give up as the countdown approached the teens.\n\nMy 1996 Study\n\nSearch engines remained fascinating to me when I reencountered them in 1995.\n\nI‚Äôd left working as a newspaper reporter to go into web development, since I\n\ndidn‚Äôt want to miss out what was obviously going to be the future of publishing.\n\nAs the general manager of Maximized Online, my job was to help get people in the\n\nOrange County, California area online. We‚Äôd build web sites, get them publicized\n\nto search engines and other publicity venues, plus host them.\n\nOne of our clients was upset at the end of 1995 that his OC jobs site wasn‚Äôt\n\nranking tops for a search on ‚Äúorange county‚Äù in WebCrawler. We didn‚Äôt have a\n\ngood answer to give him. We‚Äôd done the submission, made use of the meta tags the\n\nsearch engines said to use, but why exactly a site would rank well wasn‚Äôt well\n\nknown. So I decided to look into it.\n\nI spent January through April 1996 making changes to the InfoPages directory\n\nthat my company maintained, a search engine just for Orange County web\n\nresources, to see if it could rank better in a search for ‚Äúorange county.‚Äù I\n\ntried putting those words in the body text, the title tag, in the meta tags and\n\nalso checked to see if spamming helped, if repeating the word over and over\n\nwould have an impact.\n\nI published the results online, and 10 years on, a lot of the advice remains\n\nexactly the same. Don‚Äôt depend on ALT text. Don‚Äôt fixate on only one or two\n\nterms, because there are many ways people will seek you ‚Äî a long tail before we\n\nhad talk of long\n\ntails. Build links, because links can send you traffic. And don‚Äôt fixate on\n\ngetting traffic just from search engines. The conclusions from that study are below for those\n\nreally interested; others can jump past for the rest of this article.\n\nThere don‚Äôt seem to be any magic methods that will make a page appear at\n\nthe top of every search engines‚Äô listings. There‚Äôs too much fluctuation on the\n\nweb for any page to claim a foothold, and all the engines handle relevancy\n\nslightly differently. However, there are some general tips that do help a page\n\nappear more relevant.\n\nHave text on your home page: Search engine catalogs contain the\n\ntext read from the various home pages the engines visit. If a page lacks\n\ndescriptive text, then there is little chance that page will come up in the\n\nresults of a search engine query. It‚Äôs not enough for that text to be in\n\ngraphics. It must be HTML text. Some search engines will catalog ALT text\n\nand text in comment and meta tags. To be safe, a straight HTML description\n\nis recommended.\n\nPick your keywords: Focus on the two or three keywords that you\n\nthink are most crucial to your site, then ensure those words are both in\n\nyour title and mentioned early on your web page. Generally, most people will\n\nalready have those words present on their pages but may not also have them\n\nin page titles. Keep in mind that the keywords you consider crucial may not\n\nbe exactly what users enter. Our study focused on making the InfoPages\n\ndirectory appear high on lists if keywords ‚ÄúOrange County‚Äù were entered. The\n\nlack of success with some search engines does not mean that the site isn‚Äôt\n\nbeing found. Many people find the site by entering more words, such as\n\n‚ÄúOrange County California‚Äù or ‚ÄúOrange County Web.‚Äù The addition of just one\n\nextra word can suddenly make a site appear more relevant, and it can be\n\nimpossible to anticipate what that word will be. The best bet is to focus on\n\nyour chosen keywords but to also have a complete description.\n\nHave links to inside pages: If there are no links to inside pages\n\nfrom the home page, it seems that some search engines will not fully catalog\n\na site. Unfortunately, the most descriptive, relevant pages that are often\n\ninside pages rather than the home page. You can also try sending search\n\nengines directly to your lower levels, if they don‚Äôt ordinarily go there.\n\nForget Spamming: For one thing, spamming doesn‚Äôt seem to work\n\nwith every search engine. Ethically, the content of most web pages ought to\n\nbe enough for search engines to determine relevancy without webmasters\n\nhaving to resort to repeating keywords for no reason other than to try and\n\n‚Äúbeat‚Äù other web pages. The stakes will simply keep rising, and users will\n\nalso begin to hate sites that undertake these measures. Efforts would be\n\nbetter spent on networking and alternative forms of publicity described\n\nbelow.\n\nNetwork: If your site fails to make the top ten lists, then get\n\ntogether with those that do. Perhaps some might be considered ‚Äúcompetitors,‚Äù\n\nbut others might be happy to link to your site in return for a link back.\n\nAfter all, your site may appear first when slightly different keywords are\n\nused. Links are what the web was built on, and they remain one of the best\n\nways for people to find your site.\n\nRelax: Search engines are a primary way people look for\n\nweb sites, but they are not the only way. People also find sites\n\nthrough word-of-mouth, traditional advertising, the traditional media,\n\nnewsgroup postings, web directories and links from other sites. Many times,\n\nthese alternative forms are far more effective draws than are search\n\nengines. The audience you want may be visiting to a site that you can\n\npartner with, or reading a magazine that you‚Äôve never informed of your site.\n\nDo the simple things to best make your site relevant to search engines, then\n\nconcentrate on the other areas.\n\nA Webmaster‚Äôs Guide To Search Engines\n\nAlong with the study, I also published a collection of documents called ‚ÄúA\n\nWebmaster‚Äôs Guide To Search Engines.‚Äù My goal was to help site owners better\n\nunderstand the essentials of being found plus identify which search engines really\n\nmattered. Knowing who mattered was crucial when you‚Äôd have some search engines\n\nlike Galaxy forcing your through a three part, multiple question submission\n\nprocess to be included in their directory. Was spending all that time worthwhile? (For\n\nGalaxy, the answer was no!).\n\nThe guide provided links to the FAQs of each search engines, along with my own\n\nobservations about whether how each search engines said it worked actually lived\n\nup to reality. There was a guide to which search engines I considered to be\n\n‚Äúmajor‚Äù or most important to site owners and searchers alike. I had a\n\n‚ÄúStrategic Alliances & Victories‚Äù chart to show which search engines had deals\n\nwith the Netscape or Internet Explorer browsers and which had gained positive\n\nreviews in magazines.\n\nThe information I published quickly generated a lot of positive feedback,\n\nboth from site owners and searchers such as librarians. At the same time, the\n\nweb development company I worked for closed, so that the parent firm could\n\nconcentrate on web software development. I hung out my internet consultant\n\nshingle and kept maintaining the Webmaster‚Äôs Guide on a part time basis, sending\n\nout a newsletter update (The Search Engine Report)\n\ntwice that\n\nyear, along with making further site updates.\n\nIn 1997, I moved to the UK from California, so my wife could be closer to her\n\nfamily. I also began spending more and more time on the site, as well as writing\n\nfreelance articles on search for various publications. In the middle of the\n\nyear, I rebranded the site as Search Engine Watch, which generated more\n\nattention. By the end of the year, Mecklermedia purchased the site from me, and\n\nI continued on as editor of it.\n\nThe Search Revolution\n\nTen years on, I remain as fascinated with search engines as ever. I‚Äôve been\n\nfortunate to help chronicle the birth of an entirely new advertising medium.\n\nEqually important has been the birth of an entirely new way for people to seek\n\nout information.\n\nI knew search engines were important when I decided to write about them. The\n\njournalist in me could see they were a good story, especially when you realized\n\nthat under the hood, they weren‚Äôt doing things like crawling as often as people\n\nwidely believed. But a\n\nstudy by\n\nKeen in 2001 especially resonated with me. Search engines (as a whole ‚Äî we\n\nweren‚Äôt Google obsessed yet then) were the single most likely way people would\n\nseek information.\n\nThe study was small, but the findings were still stunning. In only about five\n\nyears, search engines had ousted things like friends, family, books, magazines,\n\nlibraries and other perfectly good resources for seeking answers.\n\nSome of this was bad. I‚Äôd personally watched people when doing search\n\ntraining spending ages trying to find a phone number, when a call to telephone\n\ninformation would have found much faster. Old but still useful search strategies\n\nwere abandoned in favor of the magic search box.\n\nLots of this is good. Search engines remain amazing tools that get us the\n\nright answers quickly in many circumstances.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nWill I still be doing this in 20 years? Almost certainly not, at least not in\n\nthe daily grind format I‚Äôve been doing. I‚Äôd like to keep writing about\n\nsearch issues, but eventually I‚Äôll move away from the regular day-to-day\n\ncoverage to perhaps focus on less frequent but deeper looks at particular search issues.\n\nI‚Äôm also thinking a lot about doing a book these days. I‚Äôd always wanted to do a book on search, indeed the exact type of\n\nhistory that\n\nJohn Battelle did a\n\nfantastic job\n\nwith in The Search.\n\nSince that‚Äôs come out, I‚Äôve thought more and more about\n\ndoing a more personal retelling of web search history ‚Äî the evolution, developments and trends\n\nI‚Äôve seen from having been in the trenches of covering them over the years.\n\nI‚Äôd\n\nalso like to do a separate one talking to various search marketers, spotlighting\n\nthem and focusing on how that medium has evolved over the years and where it\n\nwill be going. The most fascinating book idea remains the impact of search on our\n\neveryday lives, how people make use of them, how habits have changed, our\n\nlaws are starting to account for the power of search and many related issues\n\nlike that.\n\nSomeday! What I can say is that for the near future, I expect to remain\n\nworking on the site and coverage as I have, bringing some of our standing\n\ncontent back up to date, which I know has been neglected due to the need to\n\ncover the news that continues to flow in. My original Webmaster‚Äôs Guide helped\n\nmany understand search engines, and I very much want to\n\nensure Search Engine Watch remains as a leading resource doing that in the years\n\nto come.\n\nLooking Back\n\nI don‚Äôt have a succinct list of big picture items or ‚Äúhigh order bits‚Äù to offer.\n\nA lot of this has already been covered in things I‚Äôve\n\nwritten, so instead I‚Äôm going to spend some time recapping pieces I think are\n\nmost important below. These are either big trend pieces I‚Äôve done or big shifts\n\nin the search landscape I think worth noting.\n\nI know ‚Äî I KNOW ‚Äî I‚Äôve left some things out. My apologies, if so. It‚Äôs a\n\nbit easier for me to cover all the things I‚Äôve written that what me or Chris\n\nSherman both have done, and he‚Äôs clearly covered tons himself. Plus, skimming\n\nthrough 10 years worth of writings means I‚Äôll accidentally miss stuff. If you\n\nwant to go poking yourself, I‚Äôll give more tips after the summary.\n\nThe biggest overall theme in doing the recap is how that big old wheel keeps\n\nspinning around and around, with people often buying hype because they don‚Äôt\n\nremember things have come before ‚Äî or marketers making errors because they\n\ndon‚Äôt understand issues that were explored already in the past.\n\nI‚Äôve definitely felt myself getting more and more jaded. Part of that‚Äôs bad,\n\nbecause there are cool, new things that I don‚Äôt want to be blinded to. But then\n\nagain, you go through the list below and tell me if you don‚Äôt emerge feeling a\n\nbig jaded about some ideas and concepts that are retreads.\n\n1997\n\nThe Alta\n\nVista Size Controversy: The Google-Yahoo spat over index size in 2005 was\n\nonly the latest in long standing issues over page counts.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nPlanning Own Search Engine? &\n\nMicrosoft\n\nTo Launch Search Engine: Microsoft‚Äôs going to wipe out Google? Nine years\n\nago, it was wondering if they were going to wipe out Yahoo, Open Text and\n\nothers.\n\nWhat A Top\n\nListing? Become A Content Partner!: Since paid links weren‚Äôt going to fly\n\nback all those years ago, search engines had to pimp space in other ways.\n\nYahoo:\n\nDelays Expected: Forget being in Google, which didn‚Äôt exist. Back years\n\nago, it was Yahoo that everyone worried about, to the degree I did an entire\n\nspecial report on listing issues and problems.\n\nLawsuit\n\nOver Meta Tag Keywords: The new medium of search collides with trademark\n\nlaw, for the first time.\n\nNorthern\n\nLight‚Äôs Custom Search Folders: Clustering and query refinement is\n\nsomething Google‚Äôs still experimenting with today, but it‚Äôs been in place and\n\nused by others for years. Northern Light was a pioneer.\n\nAltaVista‚Äôs Refine Feature: The next time someone pitches you that we‚Äôll\n\nbe flying through search results and using flashy query refinement tools, ask\n\nthem why AltaVista Refine didn‚Äôt take off. The answer is that the 10 results\n\non a page metaphor is familiar, and though it could be better, it still works\n\npretty well for lots of people.\n\nWelcome To\n\nSearchEngineLand: Enter the portals and a detraction from search that gave\n\nGoogle‚Äôs its shot, though ironically years later, Google itself is now a\n\nportal, just a different one ‚Äî\n\nPortal 2.0.\n\nLycos Adds\n\nPredetermined Listings: Build a walled garden and watch how your users\n\nseek another place to search.\n\nThe New\n\nMeta Tags Are Coming ‚Äî Or Are They?: Tagging is going to completely\n\nchange search!

A search engine\n\nthat scales by having lots and lots of people be involved! It worked for a\n\nbit.\n\nGoing,\n\nGoing, Go.com-Gone: Uh oh, maybe we should have kept the Infoseek name\n\nand not tried to be a portal, thinks Disney.\n\nCounting\n\nClicks and Looking at Links: Meet Google and the second generation of\n\nsearch technology.\n\nAsk Jeeves:\n\nAsking Questions To Give You Answers: Meet Ask Jeeves, which seriously\n\nchallenged Google with relevancy.

Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no easy\n\nway for me to see everything written on Search Engine Watch over the years in\n\none single list. For those who wish to explore, the\n\nSearch Engine\n\nReport archives are probably the best thing to review. Each month, there‚Äôs\n\nan issue of the Search Engine Report that recaps virtually everything of\n\nimportance that was published on the site. You can also see the\n\nSearchDay archives\n\nand the SEW Blog\n\narchives, though material from both of those places is integrated into\n\nSearch Engine Report mailings.\n\nThanks\n\nFinally, some thanks‚Ä¶.\n\nKen Spreitzer, my college\n\nfriend who brought me on to do his web development company, getting me firmly\n\ngoing along a path that led to Search Engine Watch. Plus thanks to all those I\n\nworked with at Maximized Online: Tom, Joachim, Steve, Geeman (5 minutes!) and\n\nMichelle. I learned tons from all of them.\n\nGlenn Fleischman,\n\nformer moderator of the now defunct Internet Marketing Discussion List that\n\nhelped educate me and many others about internet marketing when it was just\n\ndeveloping.\n\nEric Ward, who freely provided\n\nguidance to many people looking to learn more about link building in the early\n\ndays, including myself. Plus, he was Search Engine Watch‚Äôs very first\n\nsubscriber, coughing up a donation when I asked people to consider the site as\n\nshareware and help support it.\n\nJupitermedia (which acquired\n\nthe site as Mecklermedia, changed into Internet.com, then INT Media until\n\ntaking its current name). Having someone take over the advertising and\n\ntechnical side of Search Engine Watch was a huge relief, allowing me to focus\n\nfirmly on the editorial. Chris Elwell in particular was a rock of support and\n\nwisdom over the years. Incisive Media now owns the site, of course, and\n\nremains as welcomed in leaving me to focus on the editorial.\n\nThe search engines, and in particular the many employees who I‚Äôve spoken\n\nwith over the years, who have shared ideas, thoughts, theories and more. I\n\nwon‚Äôt name any individuals, simply because I fear I‚Äôd inadvertently leave some\n\noff ‚Äî plus it would be a huge list. You all play such an important role in\n\nthis still developing field; keep doing great stuff.\n\nThe search marketers, who remain largely unsung heroes. You get people\n\nfound; you get held to unbelievably high measuring standards yet still\n\ndeliver; you help subsidize and make possible the search engines we all depend\n\non. You also serve as a check-and-balance on the search engines. If they‚Äôre\n\nplaying favorites or doing something odd, you know it and spread the word.\n\nThe searchers, and in particular those who read the site to learn to\n\nsearch better. Your questions have inspired articles; please keep them coming.\n\nYou‚Äôre also what this is all about ‚Äî delivering up content to serve you\n\nbetter.\n\nSearch Engine Watch readers. There have been plenty of long days when I‚Äôve\n\nwritten a long piece about some issue, then wondered if anyone cares. Then out\n\nof the blue, I‚Äôll get a word of thanks ‚Äî and that means the world to a\n\nwriter.\n\nSearch Engine\n\nWatch members. For the longest time, I asked people to consider SEW as if\n\nit were a shareware site. A few sent in donations, then even more did when I\n\nopened a special members-only area. During the dotcom downturn, members helped\n\nensure the survival of the site. We thrived because you helped fund us\n\ndirectly. Thanks to all of those who‚Äôve shown support in this way, and I look\n\nforward to expanding benefits for you in the coming months.\n\nThe\n\nSearch Engine Watch team.\n\nChris\n\nSherman‚Äôs been my partner in search crime here on SEW since 2001, and I\n\ncouldn‚Äôt have been luckier in having him come aboard. He‚Äôs been a great person\n\nto work with and produces wonderful content day in and day out.Elisabeth\n\nOsmeloski helped build our SEW Forums up from nothing to nearly 10,000\n\nmembers now, and I‚Äôm excited to have her launching into doing more with the\n\nsite overall. Gary Price is no longer part of our line-up, and we do still\n\nmiss him ‚Äî but Barry Schwartz has been welcomed and doing a fantastic job.\n\nPlus my thanks to Jennifer Slegg and now Brian Smith for picking up their\n\nareas on our SEW Blog, along our many SEW Forums\n\nmoderators\n\nwho help keep things running over there.\n\nMy wife and my boys, who‚Äôve missed me through too many dinners while I‚Äôve\n\nhad to finish and article or a newsletter or had to see me disappear to take a\n\ncall about some last-minute product launch."
