        "text": "Google and Bing are two of the most popular search engines. Having nearly an 83.5% desktop market share, Google is the dominant player.\n\nBing is the smaller of the two, owning almost 9.2% of the desktop market share. Microsoft’s search engine is not to be dismissed, though. In February 2023, Microsoft announced an AI-powered Bing, which uses Bing Chat, ahead of search engine giant Google’s announcement of Bard.\n\nShould digital marketers focus solely on one over the other? Let’s go through these topics to answer this question and tackle the differences between Google and Bing:\n\nA brief history of Google and Bing\n\nGoogle vs. Bing: Ranking factors and optimizing for search results\n\nDifferences between Google and Bing’s user interface\n\nGoogle vs. Bing: Image search\n\nGoogle vs. Bing: Paid advertising\n\nSettling the Google vs. Bing debate\n\nThe table below provides a quick overview of Google vs. Bing.\n\nGoogle Bing Year founded 1998 2009 Headquarters Mountain View, California Redmond, Washington Previously called Backrub MSN Search and Windows Live Search Market share of desktop search engines (as of July 2023) 83.49% 9.19% AI tool Bard Bing Chat\n\nA brief history of Google and Bing\n\nFirst off, let’s look at how Google and Bing started:\n\nGoogle: The search engine initially called Backrub\n\nGoogle was founded in 1998 by Sergey Brin and Larry Page. The duo created a search engine that ranked webpages’ importance based on the backlinks the pages received. They initially called this search engine Backrub.\n\nBackrub was eventually renamed to Google, derived from the mathematical expression googolplex. Googolplex is 1, followed by 10100 zeroes, which reflected the search engine’s goal to organize the world’s information to make it “universally accessible and useful.”\n\nHeadquartered in Mountain View, California, Google has an 83.49% market share of desktop search engines globally as of July 2023.\n\nBing: The grandchild of MSN Search\n\nA descendant of MSN Search and Windows Live Search, Bing was launched by Microsoft in 2009. Microsoft picked the new name Bing through focused groups and because it was “the sound of found.”\n\nIn February 2023, Microsoft launched an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered Bing and Edge browser. The company considers these versions of Bing and Edge as users’ “AI copilot for the web.”\n\nToday, Bing takes a global desktop search market share, second to the leader Google.\n\nGoogle vs. Bing: The main differences\n\nThe main differences between Google and Bing are their ranking factors, user interface, image search, and paid advertising capabilities. For example, Google uses mobile-first indexing while Bing doesn’t. Bing also provides lower paid advertising costs and less competition while Google Ads carry higher costs-per-click and more competitive bidding.\n\nGoogle vs. Bing: Ranking factors and optimizing for search results\n\nGoogle and Bing share similar SEO ranking factors. They have differences, though.\n\nFor one, Google uses mobile-first indexing, while Bing doesn’t. But Bing uses social signals as important ranking factors, while Google doesn’t.\n\nWhat are the other ranking factors that Google and Bing share? Let’s go through them in this section. The table below provides a summary:\n\nGoogle Bing Mobile indexing? Yes No 301 and 302 redirects 302 redirects may result in indexing issues 302 redirects are interpreted as 301 after a few more crawls Off-page SEO signals Backlinks from authoritative websites Social signals Optimizing pages E-E-A-T guidelines · Create useful content for human searchers and not just search engines\n\n· Pages must be working in the Microsoft Edge browser\n\nTechnical SEO\n\nBoth Google and Bing use several technical SEO factors to determine a page’s rank in the results pages. However, each search engine has different priorities:\n\n301/302 redirects\n\nUsing 302 redirects may result in indexing issues with Google, while Bing can interpret 302 redirects as 301 after a few more crawls. It is still good SEO practice to use 301 instead of 302.\n\nPage speed, popups, and mobile responsiveness\n\nGoogle’s Core Web Vitals metrics emphasize the importance of providing a seamless user experience to users across different devices and browsers to rank in SERPs. As such, a mobile-responsive website that loads quickly gets good points from the search engine.\n\nIn fact, Google uses mobile-first indexing, meaning it ranks a website based on its mobile version instead of its desktop version. Intrusive popups that ruin a user’s experience may also negatively affect a page’s ranking.\n\nOfficial domains\n\nBing favors pages with official domains of .gov and .edu, while Google considers commercial websites to be just as valuable.\n\nOff-page SEO\n\nBacklinks are important ranking factors for Google and Bing. But neither of these search engines simply looks at the quantity of a site’s backlinks — they both consider quality.\n\nTo establish your site’s authority, your backlinks must come from reputable websites. Backlinking is more critical for Google, though. After all, it’s not formerly known as Backrub for nothing!\n\nMeanwhile, Bing considers social signals as a page ranking factor. This means that pages with more likes and shares on social media may rank high on Bing’s search results. If you want to conquer the results pages of Bing, ensure your social media marketing strategies are aligned with your SEO efforts.\n\nOptimizing webpages for Google vs. Bing\n\nGoogle’s quality rater E-E-A-T evaluates whether a site provides helpful and relevant information to human searchers. So, what is E-E-A-T? E-E-A-T stands for experience, expertise, authoritativeness, and trust.\n\nThis guideline is meant to emphasize the importance of high-quality content that addresses the search intent of human users instead of creating low-quality content to beef up the number of pages of a site.\n\nOn the other hand, Bing states in its guidelines that your site must be working in the Microsoft Edge browser. Microsoft’s guidelines also underscore the importance of creating content for users and not for search engines.\n\nAs such, creating high-quality and helpful content for your target audience is at the core of both search engines.\n\nWant to rank better on Google and Bing? View our SEO Services and reach out to get started!\n\nThe differences between Google and Bing’s user interface\n\nGoogle features a minimalist results page with relevant images.\n\nOn the other hand, Bing provides a visual experience in its SERPs.\n\nBoth Google and Bing have other SERP features. They share most SERP tools—from ads and local packs to shopping and flights.\n\nBing has an Ask Bing AI section in its SERPs. On the other hand, Google’s SERP has books and scholarly articles.\n\nSERP Features Google Bing Ads Yes Yes Featured snippets Yes Yes Related searches Yes Yes Local pack Yes Yes Knowledge cards/graphs Yes Yes Images Yes Yes Videos Yes Yes News Yes Yes Sitelinks Yes Yes Recipes Yes Yes Shopping Yes Yes Flights Yes Yes AI-powered search No (yet) Yes (Ask Bing AI) Books Yes No Scholarly articles Yes No\n\nGoogle vs. Bing: Image search\n\nBoth search engines can search for information based on a user-uploaded image. They can also search the web for images you’re looking for.\n\nUsing Google Lens, Google’s image recognition technology, the search engine successfully identified the dog breed in the photo, a Jack Russell Terrier. It also provided a link to the SERPs for more information about the breed.\n\nBing can also search the web for information when you upload an image. It shows you three tabs:\n\nAll: A summary of what the image looks like and links to relevant SERPs. It also shows related photos from Pinterest, Facebook, and other websites.\n\nLooks like: A tab that identifies the image and links to relevant SERPs.\n\nRelated content: A tab showing other photos like the user-uploaded image and other related searches.\n\nGoogle vs. Bing: Paid advertising\n\nGoogle and Bing both have pay-per-click advertising (PPC) platforms: Google Ads and Bing Ads, respectively.\n\nGoogle Ads has two ad networks. One is its search network, where ads appear in SERPs and also includes the Google Search Partners, which displays ads on search results pages of non-Google search engines and other search-related websites. Meanwhile, its display network shows ads to users in more than 2 million sites in the Google Display Network (GDN).\n\nOn the other hand, Bing Ads has three search engines: Bing, Yahoo, and AOL. When you advertise on Bing, your ads appear in the SERPs of these search engines and their partner sites.\n\nWhile brands may be tempted to prioritize advertising on Google, which has the largest search engine market share and the most users, advertising on Bing also has its advantages.\n\nIndividual keywords’ cost per click (CPC) may be lower on Bing Ads. In addition, if you’re targeting an audience under the following demographics, they may be Bing users and it makes sense for you to reach them with Bing ads:\n\nMarried\n\nAges between 35 to 54 years old\n\nAbove $100,000 annual income\n\nA smart advertising strategy from expert digital marketing services can take advantage of both ad platforms together!\n\nSettling the Google vs. Bing debate\n\nIt’s undeniable that Google is the search engine leader. However, Bing has its strengths and has made progress on several fronts.\n\nIf you want your target audience to find your business, it’s worth optimizing your website for both search engines. While the competition isn’t saturated in Bing yet, you can optimize your pages for Microsoft’s search engine.\n\nBing places value on useful content written for human users, which is also important for Google. By pairing your SEO efforts with social media marketing strategies that up your social ranking, you’re giving Bing the signal that your website and business provide real value to users.\n\nIs your target audience older, married, and with higher income? Bing users fit this demographic, so a Bing-optimized site and PPC campaign can reach your target customers.\n\nDigital marketing changes every day. That said, Bing is in second place today, but it can potentially grow and grab more market share. It’s best to start optimizing your website to conquer its SERPs and appear in its local search, image search, and featured snippets results today!"
