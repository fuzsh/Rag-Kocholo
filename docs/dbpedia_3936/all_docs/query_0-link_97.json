        "text": "Spread the love\n\nWhen talking about search engines, the first name that comes to mind is Google.\n\nBut, what would you do when doomsday hits Google, and its servers crash down for some time?\n\nAlthough nothing as such will happen in the foreseeable future, we cannot rule anything out. So, here, we will be talking about some of the best search engines in the world alongside Google.\n\nAs a bonus, we have also added some basic details on our topic. So, let’s begin!\n\nTable Of Content:\n\nA Short Brief about Search Engines.\n\nHow to choose the right search engine.\n\nComparison of POPULAR search engines (based on market share).\n\nTraditional search engines.\n\nPrivacy-focused search engines.\n\nOther Specialized search engines.\n\nCopyright-free search engine.\n\nRevenue-sharing search engine.\n\nSearch Engines – A Short Introduction For Beginners\n\nA search engine is essentially a software program, which allows you to find your desired information instantly.\n\nHowever, each of these modules comes with its own features, making them preferable for a specific audience. Sometimes, their ultimate goal can be different as well.\n\nFor example, the Google search engine always aims to provide the correct information to its users. However, Ecosia does the same and adds something more to it. The search engine donates its surplus earnings to conservationist companies, which plant trees.\n\nFunctions Of A Search Engine\n\nIn any case, the regular functions of search engines are quite the same. They work on –\n\nCrawling: It is all about exploring the internet to find content from different URLs.\n\nIndexing: With this task, the search engines organize and store the content found during the crawling procedure.\n\nRanking: It is done for displaying content that offers the best answer for a user’s query, organized by most appropriate to least relevant.\n\nYou should always choose a search engine, which uses a form algorithm to explore its database. It helps these modules show you the best possible results depending on your search queries.\n\nHow To Choose The Right Search Engine?\n\nThe best search engine for you depends on your individual needs and preferences. Consider the following factors when making your decision:\n\nWhat are your search priorities? Are you looking for the most comprehensive results, the most relevant results, or the most private search experience?\n\nWhat features are important to you? Do you need features like image and video search, news aggregation, or advanced search operators?\n\nDo you use other products or services from the same company? If so, you may benefit from using the integrated search engine with those products or services.\n\nTraditional Search Engines\n\nHopefully, we could establish the general concept of search engines in the previous section. So, now, let’s move on to the matter at hand and find the best ones available out there!\n\nHere, we will discuss the conventional search engines in this segment, focusing more on content quality than privacy.\n\n1. Google Search Engine\n\nNo king will ever rule forever! Or, so we thought before the arrival of Google in the search engine cosmos.\n\nThe program was created in 1998 and is yet to be dethroned, even after 23 years. It is the most-used SE in the world, with over 70% of the global market share.\n\nBut, what is the reason behind such ruthless emergence of Google?\n\nThe answer is simple – it’s a well-established algorithm.\n\nOwing to its advanced technology, Google offers relevant results to its users and provides an unparalleled user experience.\n\nDue to this reason, most users consider it the best search engine in the world!\n\n2. Yahoo Search Engine\n\nBefore Google set foot in the world of search engines, Yahoo used to be the king of the arena. It had around 36.7% of the market share in 2001. However, it has come down to 1.64% after 20 years.\n\nMoreover, Yahoo shares the same algorithm as Bing. So, it offers the same search results. However, it still performs pretty decently when it comes to providing relevant results.\n\n3. Bing\n\nWhen talking about search engines other than Google, Bing always tops the list. While its algorithm isn’t as furnished as Google’s, it still does an excellent job regarding relevancy.\n\nBesides, the Bing search engine also offers some unique features.\n\nThese Are –\n\nImage searching\n\nFinding localized search results\n\nSearching videos\n\nIn addition, Bing’s algorithm focuses more on the content rather than the available backlinks. So, the information you get from a Bing-searched site will be top-notch!\n\n4. DuckDuckGo\n\nInvented by Gabriel Weinberg in the year 2008, DuckDuckGo is widely known as a non-profit program. However, it works a little differently than the Google search engine itself.\n\nUnlike Google, it does not collect data from your previous searches or any other personal information. Therefore, the search results will remain the same for everyone.\n\nDuckDuckGo also provides its results from different algorithms (sources). The list includes – Search BOSS, Yahoo Search, Bing, Wolfram Alpha, Yandex, DuckDuckBot (the search engine’s own web crawler), etc.\n\nThis search engine is pretty famous amongst users as well and gets around 50 million queries daily!\n\nComparison Of Popular Search Engines\n\n5. Wolfram Alpha\n\nAre you seeking a website, which is based on metrics and compulsion? Then, try using the Wolfram Alpha search engine.\n\nIt is pretty accurate regarding relevant searching and offers information on website data, unit conversions, sports statistics, stock data, etc.\n\n6. Dogpile Search Engine\n\nIn terms of functionality, Dogpile offers something different.\n\nIt takes data from all the top three search engines (Google, Bing, and Yahoo) and offers well-organized search results.\n\nSo, with it, you will get both websites with several backlinks as well as high-end content!\n\n7. Baidu\n\nOriginating from China, Baidu is an essential search engine for Chinese people. It is primarily known for its excellent firewall system.\n\nHowever, many people also use it for its Google-like searching habits.\n\nNonetheless, Baidu does not offer much regarding privacy, unlike some of the other search engines we have mentioned previously.\n\n8. Yippy\n\nYippy is not one of those regular search engines, which only helps you find answers to your general queries. Instead, it goes deeper and finds out the index pages that generally go unnoticed.\n\nIt utilizes user search queries to take user inputs and ask search engines for answers immediately! So, you can consider it as a metasearch engine as well.\n\n9. Naver\n\nNaver is an online platform from South Korea, which features a unique search engine developed in 1999. It was the first software program to offer different comprehensive searching features, like compiling different search results.\n\nDue to its similarities, many people also consider Naver to be “the Google of South Korea”.\n\n10. AOL Search Engine\n\nAOL is a USA-based web portal, which maintains a revamped search engine for its users. It provides its users access to –\n\nWeb queries\n\nShopping\n\nImages\n\nNews\n\nMultimedia (videos and music)\n\nLocal search results\n\nHowever, AOL displays its results a little differently than other search engines.\n\nAfter you have searched for something, it will organize the page from top to bottom by keeping the search bars first. After that, it will put the snapshots (if available), sponsored links, relevant sites, product results, and so on.\n\n11. CC Search\n\nAre you looking for a search engine where you can find public domains? Then, CC Search should be your go-to option.\n\nIt also helps you get various images without the risk of getting copyright claims.\n\n12. Web Crawler\n\nWeb Crawler is probably the oldest search engine, which offers full-text searching options. However, it is primarily used as a meta-search program, combining results from popular search engines like Google, Ask, Yahoo, Live Search, etc.\n\n13. Neeva\n\nThe developer of Neeva, Sridhar Ramaswamy, is an ex-Google executive. So, you may find some similarities between these two search engines.\n\nNonetheless, what makes Neeva different from Google is that it does not show ads to accumulate user data. Instead, it works on a subscription-based business model and provides search results from personalized files and the web.\n\nNeeva takes its usual data from Microsoft Bing, stock data from Intrinio, and weather reports from weather.com. The maps of the search engine are provided by Apple!\n\n14. Goo Search Engine\n\nGoo is a Japanese search engine cum web portal, which usually helps index and crawl Japanese websites only. There is also a child-friendly counterpart available for Goo, which is known as Kids Goo.\n\n15. You.com\n\nOn the surface, You.com may seem like any other public search engine available on the internet. However, there’s a lot going on under its fundamentals.\n\nFor instance, You is a rare search engine that uses NLP to perceive search queries and rank the results. It also changes the language according to the user’s preference.\n\nThe search engine does not host ads as well. Also, in incognito mode, it offers complete privacy for its users and avoids selling personal information to 3rd-party companies.\n\nPrivacy-Focused Search Engines\n\nThe following are some of the more privacy-focused search engines that you should know about –\n\n1. Qwant\n\nQwant is a Europe-based search engine, which primarily focuses on protecting your privacy. It comes with a unique indexing engine and avoids collecting user data.\n\nThe search engine also features 26 different languages and processes more than 10 million searches daily!\n\n2. Ecosia\n\nEcosia, as mentioned before, is a conservative search engine, which plants trees for every 45 searches. The servers of the browser also run on renewable energy and help you avoid third-party trackers for encouraging privacy.\n\n3. Gibiru\n\nContrary to some other search engines like Google, Gibiru does not log the IP addresses of its users at all. It also does not allow anyone to place cookies on the device you are using.\n\nSo, the websites will not be able to sell your data to other third-party advertisers. The security of this program is pretty tight-knit as well. So, you won’t have to worry about someone tracking your online information or browsing activities.\n\n4. StartPage\n\nInvented in 2006, StartPage is a private search engine, which offers top-notch private browsing for its users.\n\nThere is an “anonymous view” feature available in this program, which enables you to go entirely private with whatever you are searching for.\n\n5. Yandex\n\nIn short, Yandex is the Russian equivalent of Google. However, it is much older than the latter. Yandex was the first-ever search engine, which monetized selling ads.\n\nContrary to Google, it also offers an excellent privacy system. Moreover, due to its advanced algorithms, it has also become one of the most-used search engines on Google.\n\n6. Search Encrypt\n\nFounded in 2016, Search Encrypt is a privacy-first search engine, which protects your personal information through a layer of firewalls.\n\nIt also uses a local encryption system to offer a little more security while doing incognito searches.\n\n7. MetaGer\n\nMetaGer is a Germany-based metasearch engine, which extracts results from various popular search engines.\n\nHowever, it does not provide the answers in an unorganized manner.\n\nAfter finding the search results, MetaGer filters and compiles them before you can see them. Also, it offers its services through an encrypted connection. So, your private information will be intact till the end!\n\n8. Qmamu\n\nQmamu is the first private search engine in India. The interface of the program is pretty smooth and user-friendly. You can also interchange between remote and open access while using Qmamu.\n\nThe Module Offers Services On –\n\nImages\n\nNews\n\nVideos\n\nWeb search\n\nOther Specialized Search Engines\n\nWith the below-mentioned search engines, you can do something more than just get answers to your queries.\n\n1. Ask.Com\n\nAsk is a question-answer-based program, which began its journey in 1996. Unlike other search engines, it allows its users to check a webpage’s preview before entering it. This way, it keeps your data safe from the must-avoid sites.\n\n2. Lycos\n\nUnlike some of the popular search engines, Lycos focuses more on social networking, web hosting, and other entertainment sites.\n\nIt also comes with its own network sites, including Tripod.com and Angelfire.com. These provide free publishing tools, different web hosting features, and blogging add-ons.\n\n3. CodeSeek\n\nCodeSeek is a unique search engine designed to find codes and other developer-related searches on the internet. In addition, you can find programming tutorials, open-source codes, and blogs relevant to your queries or inquiries.\n\n4. Amazon\n\nThe search engine of Amazon works almost like Google, however, for a different audience segment.\n\nWhile Google offers information on different queries, Amazon showcases results on what you want to buy.\n\nIt works on the A9 algorithm, which follows your previous searches to offer various personalized solutions.\n\n5. SoFurry Search Engine\n\nIn essence, SoFurry is the cosy home for fans and artists specializing in anthropomorphic arts. So, here, you can search for various furry arts, stories, and other artistic endeavours. In addition, you can also share your music or art on this platform.\n\n6. TorrentSeeker\n\nTorrentSeeker is a well-designed torrent search engine, which allows you to download torrent files of movies, videos, games, etc.\n\nThe overall layout of the website is almost perfect. It has an easy-to-use UI navigation and a vast content library as well.\n\nIt also shows results from other torrent websites. So, after you have found your desired file, you can visit the housing site directly.\n\n7. Flickr\n\nFlickr is a video and image-hosting search engine based in the USA. Here, many expert photographers and artists upload examples of their artistries regularly.\n\nIf you only want to search the multimedia, you will not have to create an account here. Nonetheless, you need to have a profile for uploading anything on the platform.\n\nA Search Engine That Is Copyright-Free\n\n1. Openverse\n\nThink of it as a single convenient catalogue with over 300 million images and audio from various places.\n\nNow, the cool part is that Openverse isn’t stopping there. They have big plans to expand their offerings. Soon, you can expect to explore open texts and even 3D models through Openverse. They aim to provide access to 2.5 billion works under Creative Commons or public domain licenses.\n\nSpeaking of Creative Commons, Openverse is actually the successor to CC Search. So, it’s built on a strong foundation of experience. And, the best part is that Openverse is all about being open – it’s open-source! This implies anyone can view, modify, and contribute to Openverse’s code.\n\nOpenverse is more than just a search engine. It’s a bridge to a wide variety of media types. While it already covers images and audio, it also offers links to external sources. And guess what? Openverse isn’t stopping there. They’re actively looking to team up with more sources in the future. GitHub or email them if you have suggestions for new sources. They’re all ears!\n\nNow, remember how we mentioned the “External Sources” feature? This is where Openverse really shines. As a result, you get the best of both worlds – old and new. Keeping the search for openly licensed content top-notch is the goal here.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Openverse is designed with growth in mind. They’re planning to add more sources and different types of content as time goes on.\n\nA Revenue-Sharing Search Engine\n\n1. Yep.com\n\nAre you aware of this? Yep shares 90% of its advertising revenue directly with content creators.
