        "text": "Live Search does not require SearchWP but will use it if available\n\nLive Search enhances your search form by applying an AJAX search, allowing you to see search results without needing to redirect to a results page. Designed to work with any theme and any SearchWP configuration, Live Search is the easiest way to quickly improve your search forms!\n\nLive Search does not require SearchWP, so it is available on wordpress.org. If you have SearchWP installed and activated, Live Search will automatically utilize it. If you don’t, native WordPress search results will be provided.\n\nUsage\n\nAfter uploading and activating Live Search, any form generated using get_search_form() will be automatically enhanced with live search using the default configuration. The default SearchWP search engine will be used (or WordPress native search if SearchWP isn’t available) and the default theme applied. You can customize everything to a great degree, however.\n\nIf you are not using get_search_form() you can simply add a data attribute to enable live search, like so:\n\nIf you would like to prevent SearchWP from automatically enabling live search on forms generated with get_search_form(), use the searchwp_live_search_hijack_get_search_form filter.\n\nCustomizing the search engine and config used per search form\n\nYou may customize the search engine used by setting the data-swpengine attribute on your input field to match the search engine name you would like to use. This only applies when SearchWP is installed and activated, and takes precedence over the engine defined in the applicable config.\n\nYou may customize the config used per search form by setting the data-swpconfig attribute on your input to match an array key from the configs array. To customize these use the searchwp_live_search_configs filter.\n\nCustomizing the results\n\nLive Search’s results are powered by a template system. You’ll notice that there is a file that ships with the plugin: ~/wp-content/plugins/searchwp-live-ajax-search/templates/search-results.php. This file is used to display search results. It is recommended that if you wish to customize the search results you take the following steps:\n\nCreate a folder inside your theme directory titled searchwp-live-ajax-search\n\nCopy search-results.php from the ~/wp-content/plugins/searchwp-live-ajax-search/templates/ directory into that folder\n\nCustomize your theme’s copy of search-results.php as you would any theme template\n\nOptionally create additional files for each search engine e.g. search-results-supplemental.php for a search engine named supplemental\n\nPositioning\n\nLive Search outputs some basic styles to properly position the results wrapper. It also outputs a default, minimal theme of sorts. You can remove the default visual styling while retaining the positioning by dequeueing the default theme CSS:\n\nImportant note\n\n? NOTE: The default theme also implements the spinner animation If you are removing the default theme you will need to add the below keyframe animation to your theme’s CSS.\n\nIf you would like to also remove the positioning CSS, you can do that using the searchwp_live_search_base_styles filter.\n\nYou can reposition the results container in two ways:\n\nAppend a data attribute to your form input containing the parent element selector data-swpparentel=\".masthead .my-search-results-parent\"\n\nAdd a parent_el property to the configuration (see searchwp_live_search_configs)\n\nFilters\n\nThe following filters are available for use in Live Search:"
