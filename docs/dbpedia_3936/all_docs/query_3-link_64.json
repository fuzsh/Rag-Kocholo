        "text": "First off, I have NEVER left a review for any app but THIS one is just so much dang fun. I discovered it by accident looking for something else and I am SOOOOO glad I did. I have been messing with this thing for over an hour sending all my friends (at least they used to be - HA! HA! HA!) multiple gifs and stickers and even a little bit of the moving texts. The app is UBER easy to use and the Search engine is spot on. I have read that other people have had issues, but so far NOT me. Do yourself a favor and download this app and give it a try. You wonât be sorry!!!!!!!!\n\nIâve been (very happily) using the Giphy web service for the last few years to make gifs that I feel are high quality and are fun to post. I felt very positively about Giphy until one day I logged in to continue my pleasant gif-making hobby and - suddenly - the âcreate gifâ button (a + at the top of my page) no longer directs me to where I make my gifs, but instead to an uncloseable screen that tells me to download the app. At first I thought I could click through this - I donât like downloading a ton of apps, I keep my phone neat and storage relatively low - but when I tried to skip past it and reopen the page I found that I couldnât. Now this is very frustrating, as Iâve been (and might I add again, very happily) using the web page for awhile - and suddenly the only way to access my ability to make gifs is to download the app? An app I was to find out works completely differently, much worse, and is way too busy? An app that takes up too much space on my phone? An app that I, by all means, do not want to download? I deleted it immediately, I didnât even make a single gif. One of the worst changes I have ever seen to anything, ever. I want a working and accessible web page - not some ugly redirect to an app that doesnât work in the way Iâve been using Giphy this entire time. I literally wish I could rate this lower than a one, but I unfortunately canât. Do not download, itâs not worth your time. There are better.\n\nI have tried everything to fix this problem for a month now including contacting the support email. After over a week of emails the problem still isnât solved and it doesnât seem like it will be. Every time I click âuseâ after I have selected a sticker it just goes know where land. I love the app Iâm just feeling frustrated that no one seems to know whatâs going on. Iâm really sad since I was going to try to get verified as an artist.\n\nUpdate : customer service is crap. after emailing for 2 weeks they canât tell me how to fix the problem and basically told me to use my computer instead. Iâm sorry but thatâs ridiculous when I create my gif stickers from my iPad. I have never left an angry review before but this is infuriating. My iPad is brand new and I have not changed anything. It is a problem with the app but no one knows how to fix it apparently."
