        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI am struggling with GPT4 lately. It acts weird.\n\nI was trying to create articles in a specific way with it which includes online searching and link insertion.\n\nIt said it does not have access to the internet search. I told gpt4 that yes it has, then tried to do some python magic for several times and then failed.\n\nthe instructions are in English and the output language was supposed to be Hungarian. I specified this in the prompt.\n\nDo you know whats the issue?\n\nObviously I tried to go to help.openai.com however I just found the robot chat which is good for nothing.\n\nThen I tried to join the discord which failed during member authentication.\n\nHere are some pics:\n\nYes, there is a significant issue with ChatGPT and also API models.\n\nI noticed this also - ChatGPT requests for a dall-e image that attempt to emit useless “analyzing” functions first. Requests for language generation tasks that attempt to invoke python to do things with impossible “ai” methods.\n\nThen there is gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 on API, insistently dumping out similarly useless and nonsense parallel tool calls to function specifications that should have never been invoked.\n\nOpenAI has broken the models something serious.\n\nNot sure if this well help in your more complicated instructions. However I have received similar “As of my last update…unable to search the internet…”\n\nThis is how I was able to get it to search. I had to start off with the following:\n\nYou\n\nIt was reported that you can search the internet. Are you able to?\n\nChatGPT\n\nYes, I can search the internet for information, articles, and various resources using a tool called WebPilot. You can ask me to look up specific information, and I will provide you with the most relevant and up-to-date content available. Just let me know what you need to find!\n\nYou\n\nHow do I make sure you are using the tool WebPilot\n\nChatGPT\n\nTo ensure that I use the WebPilot tool for your request, you simply need to specify that you want me to search the internet for the information you’re seeking. When you ask a question or make a request that involves finding current or specific information online, I will use WebPilot to fulfill your request.\n\nFor example, you can say:\n\n“Can you find the latest news on electric cars using WebPilot?”\n\n“Use WebPilot to search for recent studies on the health benefits of meditation.”\n\nOnce you make such a request, I will use WebPilot to search the internet and provide you with the information you’re looking for. Just be clear about what you want to find, and I’ll take care of the rest!\n\nWelcome to the Dev Community!\n\nSomething that’s extremely important to keep in mind is the fact that ChatGPT can not see its updates or what changes have been made.\n\nThe model will hallucinate, as you just saw.\n\nTry this instead.\n\nOpen a new, clean chat and tell it the following:\n\n“Search the web for news on recent AI developments”\n\nIf that doesn’t work come back and show us the response and we can help you troubleshoot."
