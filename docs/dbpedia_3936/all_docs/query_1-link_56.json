        "text": "4. Specialized Databases\n\nA specialized database—often called a research or library database—allows targeted searching on one or more specific subject areas (i.e., engineering, medicine, Latin American history, etc.), for a specific format (i.e., books, articles, conference proceedings, video, images), or for a specific date range during which the information was published. Most of what specialized databases contain can not be found by Google or Bing.\n\nThere are several types of specialized databases, including:\n\nBibliographic – details about published works\n\nFull-text – details plus the complete text of the items\n\nMultimedia – various types of media, such as images, audio clips, or video excerpts\n\nDirectory – brief, factual information\n\nNumeric – data sources\n\nProduct – model numbers, descriptions, etc.\n\nMixed – a combination of other types, such as multimedia and full-text\n\nWhen to Use Specialized Databases\n\nSearch specialized databases to uncover scholarly information that is not available through a regular web search. Specialized databases are especially helpful if you require a specific format or up-to-date, scholarly information on a specific topic.\n\nMany databases are available both in a free version and in a subscription version. Your affiliation with a subscribing library grants you access to member-based services at no cost to you. For example, using PubMed via OSU Libraries enables a Find It link to help you request an item.\n\nDatabase Scope\n\nInformation about the specific subject range, format, or date range a particular specialized database covers is called its scope. A specialized database may be narrow or broad in scope, depending on whether it, for instance, contains materials on one or many subject areas.\n\nIf you are using a database licensed by OSU Libraries and have clicked the title in the list of databases, you will see scope information at the bottom of the same page that says “Click on the following to go to the resource.”\n\nOnce you are aware of a database’s scope, you’ll be able to decide whether the database is likely to have what you want (for instance, journal articles as opposed to conference proceedings). Reading about the scope can save you time you would have otherwise wasted searching in databases that do not contain what you need.\n\nHow to Use Them\n\nUse of each database varies somewhat.\n\nSee Ohio State’s research database list.\n\nKeyword Searching\n\nAlthough keyword search principles apply (as described in Precision Searching), you may want to use fewer search terms since the optimal number of terms is related to database size. Google and Bing work best with several terms since they index billions of web pages and additional terms help narrow the results. Each scholarly database indexes a fraction of that number, so you are less likely to be overwhelmed by results even with one or two keywords than you would be with a search engine.\n\nPhrase searching (putting multiple words in quotes so Google or Bing will know to search them as a phrase) is also less helpful in specialized databases because they are smaller and more focused. Databases are better searched by beginning with only a few general search terms, reviewing your results and, if necessary, limiting them in some logical way. (See Limiting Your Search below.)\n\nLimiting Your Search\n\nMany databases allow you to choose which areas (also called fields) of items to search for your search term(s), based on what you think will turn up documents that are most helpful.\n\nFor instance, you may think the items most likely help to you are those whose titles contain your search term(s). In that case, your search would not show you any records for items whose titles do not have your term(s). Or maybe you would want to see only records for items whose abstracts contain the term(s).\n\nWhen this feature is available, directing your search to particular parts of items, you are said to be able to “limit” your search. You are limiting your search to only item parts that you think will have the biggest pay-off at distinguishing helpful items from unhelpful items.\n\nSearching fields such as title, abstracts, and subject classification often gives helpful items.\n\nSubject Heading Searching\n\nOne precision searching technique may be helpful in databases that allow it, and that’s subject heading searching. Subject heading searching can be much more precise than keyword searching because you are sure to retrieve only your intended concept.\n\nSubject searching is helpful in situations such as:\n\nThere are multiple terms for the same topic you’re interested in (example: cats and felines).\n\nThere are multiple meanings for the same word (example: cookie the food and cookie the computer term).\n\nThere are terms used by professionals and terms used by the general public, including slang or shortened terms (example: flu and influenza).\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nDatabase creators work with a defined list of subject headings, which is sometimes called a controlled vocabulary. That means the creators have defined which subject terms are acceptable and assigned only those words to the items it contains. The resulting list of terms is often referred to as a thesaurus. When done thoroughly, a thesaurus will not only list acceptable subject headings, but will also indicate related terms, broader terms and narrower terms for a concept.\n\nRecords and Fields\n\nThe information researchers usually see first after searching a database is the “records” for items contained in the database that also match what was asked for by the search.\n\nEach record describes an item that can be retrieved and gives you enough information so that, hopefully, you can decide whether it should meet your information need. The descriptions are in categories that provide different types of information about the item. These categories are called “fields.” Some fields may be empty of information for some items, and the fields that are available depend on the type of database."
