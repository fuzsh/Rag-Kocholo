And if you’re like most people, you’re always on the lookout for new and better ways to do it.\n\nI’m sure you are familiar with some research databases. But, top researchers keep an open mind and are always looking for inspiration in unexpected places.\n\nThis article aims to give you an edge over researchers that rely mainly on Google for their entire research process.\n\nOur list of 28 academic search engines will start with the more familiar to less.\n\n#1. Google Scholar\n\nGoogle Scholar is an academic search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines.\n\nGreat for academic research, you can use Google Scholar to find articles from academic journals, conference proceedings, theses, and dissertations.

ERIC (Education Resources Information Center)\n\nERIC (short for educational resources information center) is a great academic search engine that focuses on education-related literature. It is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and produced by the Institute of Education Sciences.\n\nERIC indexes over a million articles, reports, conference papers, and other resources on all aspects of education from early childhood to higher education. So, search results are more relevant to Education on ERIC.\n\n✔Pros:\n\nExtensive coverage: ERIC indexes over a million articles, reports, and other resources on all aspects of education from early childhood to higher education.\n\nYou can limit your results to peer-reviewed journals by clicking on the “Peer-Reviewed” tab.\n\nGreat search engine for educators, as abstracts are available for most articles.\n\nRelated articles are shown, as well as the number of times an article has been cited.\n\n✘Cons:\n\nNot all articles are available in full text.\n\nAbstracts are only a snippet of the full article, so you might need to do additional searching to get the full information you need.\n\n$ Pricing:\n\nERIC is a free online database of education-related literature.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nSCI Journal: Science Journal Impact Factor\n\n15 Best Websites to Download Research Papers for Free\n\n11 Best Academic Writing Tools For Researchers 2024\n\n10 Best Reference Management Software for Research 2024\n\nAcademic Tools\n\n#3.

It can be a useful search tool.\n\nType in a question like “What is the square root of 64?” or “What is the boiling point of water?” and Wolfram Alpha will give you an answer.\n\nWolfram Alpha can also be used to find academic articles.
