        "text": "Google may dominate the search engine market, but knowing the search market share can be helpful — especially if you’re an ecommerce store owner looking to rank for certain countries or devices.\n\nWhen people say “optimize for search engines,” Google is always the first search engine that comes to mind.\n\nNewsflash: There are other search engines out there, too.\n\nThese top search engines receive tons of traffic… but they don’t always appear as popular as Google.\n\nLet’s do a deep dive into the overall search engine market share and how it looks based on regions, counties, and the world.\n\nMeet the Search Engines\n\nGoogle\n\nGoogle was started by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998.\n\nIts name was derived from the word “googol,” a mathematical term for what we get when we multiply 10 by itself 100 times (it’s 1 with 100 zeros after it).\n\nBefore Google and its parent company, Alphabet, became the third trillion-dollar valued company ever created, Page and Brin struggled to sell it.\n\nThey offered to sell Google to Excite (another internet company) in 1999 for $750,000, but Excite rejected their offer. Only five years later, Google raised $1.67 billion during its initial public offering (IPO) in 2004.\n\nFast forward to now, and besides optimizing its algorithms to return the best results to user queries, Google is also engaged in businesses like:\n\nSoftware products (like Google Workspace and the famous Gmail)\n\nSearch advertising (Google AdWords)\n\nInfrastructure (Google Cloud)\n\nSelf-driving cars (Waymo)\n\nNumber of searches: As of 2022, Google processes more than 100,000 search queries per second. That’s more than 8.5 billion daily searches.\n\nAnnual revenue: In 2021, Google’s annual revenue hit $257 billion. It’s the first time it broke the $200 billion mark.\n\nYahoo\n\nBefore Google reigned supreme, Yahoo was the king of the internet.\n\nJerry Yang and David Filo founded Yahoo in 1994. They originally named the website “David and Jerry’s Guide to the World Wide Web” before changing it to Yahoo, which stands for “Yet Another Hierarchical Organized Oracle.”\n\nAt its peak in the early 2000s, Yahoo was valued at $125 billion.\n\nYahoo was such a force that Google founders Larry Page and Sergei Brin offered to sell Google to Yahoo for $1 million in 1998, but Yahoo turned them down.\n\nIn 2000, Yahoo eventually got Google to power their web search. In 2002, Yahoo then offered to buy Google for $3 billion. This time, Google rejected them, saying they were worth at least $5 billion. Yahoo eventually dropped Google in 2004 for their own search technology.\n\nBy 2008, Google was already dominating the search market. So, to overthrow the search giant, Microsoft offered to acquire Yahoo for $44.6 billion (or $31 per share), which was a 62% premium over Yahoo’s closing price. Microsoft later rescinded its offer after Yahoo said it was “too low.”\n\nIn 2016, Yahoo was sold to Verizon for $5 billion. Verizon had already acquired AOL in 2015 for $4.4 billion, so it combined Yahoo and AOL under its “Oath” brand.\n\nIn 2021, Apollo Global Management acquired Verizon Media (formerly known as Oath), whose portfolio included AOL and Yahoo, for $5 billion — half of what Verizon paid for both AOL and Yahoo.\n\nNumber of searches: As of 2022, Yahoo has over 700 million monthly active users and receives 3.4 billion monthly visits.\n\nAnnual revenue: In 2021, Yahoo earned 873.8 million euros (about $920 million USD).\n\nYandex\n\nYandex.ru is a Russian search engine started in 1993 by Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich. Its name stands for “Yet Another iNDEXer.”\n\nYandex was officially launched in 1997 and introduced contextual advertisement in 1998. It was registered as a standalone company in 2000.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2011, Yandex focused on building its presence in locations such as Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkiye. In 2011, Yandex went public on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering (IPO) of $1.3 billion.\n\nThe advantage of Yandex over other search engines is its ability to understand Russian inflection for search queries — a crucial feature since Russian words can take almost 20 different endings to indicate their relationship to one another.\n\nNumber of searches: As of June 2022, Yandex receives 3.8 billion monthly visits.\n\nAnnual revenue: Yandex made 356 billion Russian rubles (equivalent to $6.74 billion USD) in 2021.\n\nWhat Is Google’s Search Engine Market Share?\n\nGoogle’s market share fluctuates between 86% and 96%, depending on the location. It has dominated the search engine market share since it was introduced in 1997. Its global search engine market share, as of June 2022, stands at 91.88%.\n\nWhere Do the Other Search Engines Stand?\n\nAccording to StatCounter, as of June 2022, Google’s global search engine market share was at 91.88%, with Bing following at 3.19%, Yandex at 1.52%, Yahoo at 1.33%, Baidu at 0.76%, and DuckDuckGo at 0.64%. Other search engines make up the remaining 0.68%.\n\nSimilarWeb data shows that Google tops the global search engine market share at 90.63%, with Yahoo following at 3.25%, Bing at 2.88%, Yandex at 0.45%, Naver at 0.44%, and other search engines at 2.34%.\n\nSearch Engine Market Share: According to Country (as of June 2022)\n\nLet’s look at the search engine market share for countries with large internet user bases.\n\nGoogle dominates most countries besides China and Russia. Baidu dominates China with a 75.54% market share (vs. Google’s 3.56%), while Google and Yandex share Russia’s search engine market.\n\nUnited States (U.S.)\n\nGoogle — 86.99%\n\nBing — 7.02%\n\nYahoo — 3.11%\n\nDuckDuckGo — 2.42%\n\nYandex — 0.12%\n\nEcosia — 0.10%\n\nOthers — 0.24%\n\nUnited Kingdom (U.K.)\n\nGoogle — 91.74%\n\nBing — 5.14%\n\nYahoo — 1.64%\n\nDuckDuckGo — 0.87%\n\nEcosia — 0.32%\n\nYandex — 0.15%\n\nOthers — 0.14%\n\nCanada\n\nGoogle — 91.18%\n\nBing — 5.51%\n\nYahoo — 1.58%\n\nDuckDuckGo — 1.31%\n\nYandex — 0.12%\n\nEcosia — 0.10%\n\nOthers — 0.20%\n\nAustralia\n\nGoogle – 93.37%\n\nBing — 4.63%\n\nYahoo — 0.84%\n\nDuckDuckGo — 0.80%\n\nEcosia — 0.15%\n\nYandex — 0.08%\n\nOthers — 0.13%\n\nChina\n\nBaidu — 75.54%\n\nBing — 11.47%\n\nSogou — 4.83%\n\nGoogle — 3.56%\n\nHaosou — 2.20%\n\nShenma — 1.74%\n\nOthers — 0.66%\n\nRussian Federation\n\nYandex — 49.02%\n\nGoogle — 48.08%\n\nMail.ru — 1.24%\n\nBing — 0.84%\n\nDuckDuckGo — 0.40%\n\nYahoo — 0.31%\n\nOthers — 0.11%\n\nSearch Engine Market Share\n\nGoogle is the undisputed market leader in online search, taking the majority of the search engine market share. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore the other popular search engines, especially if you want your website to rank in China or Russia.\n\nThe recipe for success is straightforward: Search engines want to bring users the most relevant search results. So, create quality content and follow best practices for building a user-friendly website to rank your website on all search engines.\n\nStart by choosing a good web hosting provider. It’s one of the things most people scrimp on without knowing that cheap web hosting actually prompts you to spend more. Cheap hosting is often slow, which can result in search engines penalizing your website."
