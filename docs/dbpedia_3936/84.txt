Live Search Academic was a Web search engine for scholarly literature which existed from 2006-2008; it was part of Microsoft's Live Search group of services. It was similar to Google Scholar, but rather than crawling the Internet for academic content, Live Search Academic search results came directly from trusted sources, such as publishers of academic journals.

Live Search Academic was known as Windows Live Academic Search when the beta version was officially launched on April 11, 2006. [Anandanpillai, Thiru; and Mike Buschman. [http://academicsearch.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!B163B2374D007766!107.entry Welcome] , Windows Live Academic Search Blog, 11 April 2006.] The name had changed to Live Search Academic by December 6, 2006, when Microsoft announced the addition of millions of new articles, mainly in biomedicine.

On May 23, 2008, Microsoft announced the end of Live Search Books and Live Search Academic, both sites to be closed, with their results integrated into regular Search.
