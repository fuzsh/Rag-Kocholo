The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:04 a.m., in room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Robert Menendez (chairman of the committee) presiding.

ROBERT MENENDEZ, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY The Chairman. Good morning. This hearing will come to order. Today we focus on Iraq and U.S. policy options, but to fully examine the crisis in Iraq we must acknowledge the broader context of developments across the region. Earlier this year I held a hearing on the spillover from the Syria conflict to examine the implications of continued violence in Syria and how it would impact the stability and security of neighboring countries. Now we are seeing the very dangerous results of that spillover with the advancement of ISIS, the increase in sectarian violence, underscored by the dissolution of any real border between Iraq and Syria, and the designation by ISIS of a caliphate across Syria and Iraq that is threatening to create a security vacuum in the heart of the Middle East. While today's hearing will not focus specifically on the regional threat posed by ISIS or on United States-Syria policy, I want to take this opportunity to restate my long-held position that we must enhance our support to the moderate Syrian opposition, the only ones willing to challenge ISIS and other al-Qaeda affiliates in Syria. It seems to me at the end of the day supporting these moderate forces must be one pillar of a broader U.S. policy in the region. No one should be surprised that Iraq is the victim of this spillover, but we should be extremely concerned by the rapid expansion of ISIS and alarmed by Iran's clear involvement in Iraq. And we should be dismayed by the convenient alignment of Iranian, Russian, and Syrian interests in response to recent developments, especially in Iraq. At its core, this alignment is about self- preservation of rogue actors that seek to maintain power by destabilizing others and keeping weak governments susceptible to malign influence. In my view, Iraq does not have to proceed down this path and it is up to Iraq's leaders to chart a different course for their country. I am deeply disappointed that, after years of United States investment in time and resources, the loss of thousands of American lives, and the commitment of billions of dollars to support Iraq's political development and the creation of a responsible, capable Iraqi Security Force, that they deserted the communities they were responsible for protecting, abandoned United States military equipment, and fled from ISIS fighters. At the same time, ISIS's expansion across Iraq and its reception by Iraq's Sunni communities and tribes would not have been possible except for the accumulation of years of destructive sectarian, corrupt policies by the central government in Baghdad. Iraq has the potential to be an economically prosperous, diverse, and politically representative model for others in the region, but Iraqi leaders have focused on their own sectarian and ethnic interests for too long, at the expense of building an Iraq for all Iraqis. The time is now for Iraq's elected leaders to form a national unity government that is truly representative. I applaud the recent progress in nominating a Speaker and two Deputy Speakers for Iraq's Parliament and today's promising news that a President has been named. I encourage Iraq's leaders to continue this critical work and finalize the government with leaders committed to leading an Iraq for all Iraqis. While Iraq's leaders continue negotiations to form the next government, the Department of Defense has completed the assessment of Iraqi Security Forces. I look forward to hearing from our administration witness on the findings and recommendations provided by U.S. advisers and plans going forward to counter the threat from ISIS and Congress' role in this effort. Let me take a moment to highlight the particularly dangerous situation of minority communities in Iraq and particularly Iraqi Christians. I recently joined Senator Stabenow in a meeting with Archbishop Bashar Warda from the Chaldean Diocese of Erbil. His description of the terror that ISIS has inflicted in Iraqi Christian communities is truly horrifying, and I hope that our witnesses today will share with us steps the administration is taking to address the urgent and unique situation of Iraqi Christians. I hope to hear from our administration witnesses today whether or not they believe Iraqi leaders are capable, or able, I should say, to form a more representative government, what is required to turn the tide against ISIS, and if there is a new national unity government in Baghdad what should we do to demonstrate support. With that, Senator Corker. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BOB CORKER, U.S. SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE Senator Corker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank our witnesses for being here. Iraq seems to be disintegrating as the terrorist organization ISIS now controls Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, Fallujah, and much of Ramadi, parts of Baiji, Tikrit. Though significantly outnumbered, ISIS managed to overwhelm entire divisions of the Iraqi Army, many of whom removed their uniforms and ran. ISIS also has claimed credit for a recent string of bombings in Baghdad, is responsible for systemic persecution of Christians, thousands of whom are being forced to flee their homes under penalty of death if they do not convert and pay a tax. The U.N. reports that last month was the deadliest in Iraq since 2008, with 2,400 Iraqis killed, two-thirds of which were civilians. For those of us who were here during the debate over the hard-won gains of the surge, this is hardly an outcome that would have been imagined back then. Though our intelligence picture in Iraq is woefully inadequate, the situation should not surprise us, for two reasons. The crisis is connected to the disaster in Syria, which our country has largely ignored. Sunni militants have long enjoyed freedom of movement across the porous border in Anbar province and had been in control of Fallujah and key parts of Ramadi for months prior to the takeover of Mosul. Since 2009, Maliki has systematically shredded and politicized the entire structure of the Iraqi Security Forces, replacing competent commanders with incompetent, yet loyal, commanders and creating a more sectarian institution that scares the average Iraqi as much as ISIS. Despite the connection to Syria, it is important to note that this is not just an invasion from foreign fighters. ISIS simply cannot hold this much territory in Iraq while maintaining operations in Syria without help on the ground. Whether we can look--rather, we can look at this as a civil and sectarian war being exacerbated and exploited by a growing terrorist threat. This is yet another signal of how badly Prime Minister Maliki has alienated the Sunni population. Even if Maliki leaves, without political reconciliation among Iraq's key communities no amount of military support can make a difference. But on the other hand, if we do not help the Iraqi Government survive and hold territory now, there is a possibility we will not be discussing political reconciliation in a few months because the country could break apart. Today in this hearing I hope we can confront this dilemma head on. I hope we can start to identify the right mix of security assistance and political steps that will help get the country back on the right track. I am open to working with the administration to determine what we can do as a nation to help shore up the defenses of the Iraqis and encourage political reconciliation among Iraqi leaders. I want to thank you for being here today. I look forward to this hearing and I look forward to us weighing in on what we believe are the most appropriate steps forward. Thank you very much. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Corker. Let me introduce our first panel. With us today is Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iraq and Iran, Brett McGurk, who has just returned from a 6-week trip to Iraq, where he was assisting the Embassy team; and Ms. Elissa Slotkin, performing the duties of the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, whose experience on Iraq ranges from the intelligence community to the National Security Council to the State Department, and now to the Defense Department. Let me remind both of you that your full statements will be included in the record without objection. I would ask you to summarize in about 5 minutes or so, so that the members of the committee can engage with you in a dialogue. With that, we will start with you, Mr. Secretary. STATEMENT OF BRETT McGURK, DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR IRAQ AND IRAN, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, DC Mr. McGurk. Thank you. Good morning. Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Corker, members of this committee, I thank you for inviting us to discuss the situation in Iraq, with a focus on U.S. response since the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant attacked Mosul nearly 7 weeks ago. Let me first review the bidding on why this matters. ISIL is al-Qaeda. It may have changed its name, it may have broken with senior al-Qaeda leadership such as Ayman al-Zawahiri, but it is al-Qaeda in its doctrine, ambition, and increasingly in its threat to U.S. interests. Should there be any question about the intentions of this group, simply read what its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, says. And it is important to pay attention to what he says because we cannot risk underestimating the goals, capacity, and reach of this organization. Baghdadi in May 2011 eulogized the death of Osama bin Laden and promised a violent response. ISIL training camps in Syria are named after Osama bin Laden. In his audio statements Baghdadi regularly issues veiled threats against the United States, promising a direct confrontation. And, in his feud with al-Zawahiri. Baghdadi is clearly seeking to lead the global jihad. Additionally, ISIL is no longer simply a terrorist organization. It is now a full-blown army, seeking to establish a self-governing state through the Tigris and Euphrates Valleys in what is now Syria and Iraq. It now controls much of eastern Syria. In January in Iraq it moved into Anbar province, taking control of Fallujah, and on June 10 it moved on Mosul. I arrived in Erbil, 80 kilometers east of Mosul, on June 7 and I will begin there. In meetings with local officials from Mosul and with Kurdish officials on June 7, we received early indications that ISIL was moving in force from Syria into Iraq and staging forces in western Mosul. We immediately asked and received permission from Kurdish leaders to deploy Peshmerga forces on the eastern side of the city, but the Government of Baghdad did not share the same sense of urgency and refused the deployments. Iraqi military commanders promised to send nine brigades of force to Mosul in response to our warnings. We stressed, however, that the forces might not arrive in time. On June 9, the situation remained extremely tense and we continued to urge the immediate deployment of additional security forces to protect against an ISIL attack from west to east. In the early hours of June 10, ISIL launched a complex suicide bomb attack across a strategic bridge and poured forces into the eastern part of the city. Iraqi resistance totally collapsed, which led to a panic and a snowballing effect southward through the Tigris Valley and to the cities of Tikrit, Samarra, and Bilad. The result was catastrophic. Five divisions nearly dissolved and the approaches to Baghdad were immediately under threat. I flew to Baghdad first thing that morning with a focus on ensuring our people were safe, working with Ambassador Beecroft and our team, and working with the Iraqis to ensure the northern approaches to Baghdad were bolstered. My written testimony sets forth in detail the critical elements of our crisis response. We first made certain that our people would be safe, including contractors working on bases outside of Baghdad, who were evacuated with the help of the Iraqi Air Force. At the Embassy and at the airport, we rebalanced staff to manage the crisis and brought in additional Department of Defense resources to ensure the security of our facilities. In parallel, at the President's direction, we worked to urgently improve our intelligence pictures throughout western and northcentral Iraq, surging surveillance flights, establishing joint operations centers, and deploying Special Operations Forces to assist Iraqi units around the capital. These intelligence and security initiatives were undertaken in parallel with regional diplomacy led by Secretary Kerry to better focus attention on the serious threat. We finally sought to stabilize the Iraqi political process, recognizing that this attack took place at the most vulnerable moment, following national elections that were held on April 30 in which 14 million Iraqis voted, but prior to the formation of a new government. This process remains extremely challenging, but now has some traction. A new Speaker of Parliament was chosen last week. He is a moderate Sunni Arab named Salim Jabouri, elected with the overwhelming support from all major components in the new Iraqi Parliament. Today, just about 2 hours ago, the new Iraqi Parliament elected Fuad Masum, a distinguished Kurdish statesman, to serve as the new President of Iraq. He, too, was elected overwhelmingly, with support from all major components in the newly elected Parliament. Iraqis are now proceeding along their constitutional timeline to choose a Prime Minister, which must happen within 15 days. As the President has said, it is not the place of the United States to choose Iraq's leaders. It is clear, though, that only leaders who can govern with an inclusive agenda are going to be able to pull the country together and guide the Iraqi people through this crisis. The current situation today in Iraq remains extremely, extremely, serious. ISIL remains in control of Mosul and it is targeting all Iraqis--Sunni, Shia, Christian, Kurds, Turkoman, Yazidi, Shaveks--who disagree with its twisted vision of a seventh century caliphate. It has also joined in an unholy alliance with militant wings of the former Baath Party, known as the Naqshbandi Network, and with some former insurgent groups, such as the Islamic Army of Iraq. Going forward, the Iraqis, with our support, must seek to split these latter groups from ISIL and to isolate ISIL and the hard-core militant groups from the population. The platforms we have established through the immediate crisis response are now providing additional information to inform the President and our national security team as we develop options to protect our interests in Iraq. Any further decisions in this regard will be made in full consultation with this committee and with the Congress. Any efforts we take, moreover, must be in conjunction with Iraqi efforts to isolate ISIL from the population. This is because, while we have a serious counterterrorism challenge in Iraq, Iraq has a serious counterinsurgency challenge, and the two are inextricably linked. Based on my last 7 weeks on the ground in Iraq, there is now a clear recognition by Iraqis from all communities that substantial reforms must be undertaken. This will require the formation of a new government, together with restructuring of the security services. An emerging consensus in Iraq, which we can fully support, is a functioning federalism consistent with Iraq's Constitution, based on the new realities on the ground, and focused on the following five principles. First, local citizens must be in the lead in securing local areas. Second, these local citizens defending their communities must be provided state benefits and state resources, perhaps modeled along the lines of a National Guard-type force structure. Third, the Iraq Army must be restructured. Commanders who failed in Mosul have since been fired and they have been replaced with new commanders, who we are working very closely with. The federal army should also focus on federal functions, such as protecting borders, and rarely deploy inside cities, while providing overwatch support when necessary. Fourth principle: There must be close cooperation between local, regional, and national security services to gradually reduce operational space for ISIL, particularly in Nineveh province. And, finally, the Federal Government, through its new Parliament and a new Cabinet, must work diligently on a package of reforms that can address legitimate grievances from all communities and ensure adequate resources to these restructured security services. These five principles can begin to address many of the core grievances in the Sunni majority areas of Iraq while also, importantly, denying space for ISIL to operate and thereby protect the Shia majority and other vulnerable groups from ISIL attack. Restoring stability and degrading ISIL will require a smart, integrated central, regional, and provincial approach led by a new Iraq Government, with an appropriate level of United States support and assistance. Iraqi leaders from all communities have asked for assistance in implementing this program and General Austin, our Commander of CENTCOM, is on the ground today to further assess the situation and discuss concrete ways in which our assistance might be effective. This model of a functioning federalism is achievable and it is essential if we hope to deny space for ISIL within the borders of Iraq. I look forward once again to discussing more details in the answers to your questions, and I thank you again for the opportunity to testify this morning. [The prepared statement of Mr. McGurk follows:] Prepared Statement of Brett McGurk Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Corker, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to discuss the U.S. response to the crisis in Iraq. I just returned from Iraq after spending the past 7 weeks in Baghdad and Erbil helping to manage our crisis response with Ambassador Beecroft and our diplomatic and military team on the ground, which is serving with courage and dedication. We were assisted by the tireless efforts of Secretary Kerry, including a visit to Iraq at a critical moment, and the entire national security team, including the daily attention of the President and Vice President. My testimony today will provide a firsthand account of the U.S. response In Iraq to date, and the foundations we are building to protect U.S. interests over the months ahead. i. the fall of mosul I arrived in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region, on June 7, 3 days before Mosul fell to militants led by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We had been concerned about Mosul for the past year, as it had become the primary financial hub for ISIL, generating nearly $12 million per month in revenues through extortion and smuggling rackets. From all of our contacts in Mosul, including Iraqi security and local officials, the city by day would appear normal, but at night, ISIL controlled the streets. One of my first meetings in Erbil on the morning of June 8th was with the Governor of Ninewa province, Atheel Nujaifi. His news was alarming. Over the past 72 hours, he told me, hundreds of ISIL gun trucks, carrying fighters and heavy weapons, had crossed the Iraq-Syria border near the town of Rabiya, then passed north of Tal Afar, before staging on the outskirts of west Mosul. The Iraqi Army agreed to provide assistance to Mosul, but Iraqi commanders did not seem to appreciate the urgency of the situation, and stated that reinforcements might not arrive for a week. We checked this information with sources in western Ninewa near the Syrian border crossings, and confirmed that ISIL appeared to be coming across in force. We also met immediately with Karim Sinjari, the Minister of Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), who confirmed with real-time information that neighborhoods in western Mosul were under immediate threat, as well as reports from the border regions about a steady stream of ISIL reinforcements crossing into Iraq from Syria. During this meeting, Minister Sinjari spoke to President Masoud Barzani and received authorization to deploy Kurdish Peshmerga units into eastern Mosul to help reinforce Iraqi Forces and deter any ISIL advance east across the Tigris. He said the Peshmerga were ready to help, but under the constitution, first required authority from the Government of Iraq. We sent an immediate and urgent message to Baghdad, including to the Acting Minister of Defense, and directly to Prime Minister Maliki through his chief of staff. They responded that the situation was under control, and that nine Iraqi Army brigades would soon be relocated to Mosul. We questioned that information, and encouraged Baghdad to request assistance from Peshmerga forces immediately, as the Peshmerga was able to reinforce the city rapidly, and there was precedent for their helping to protect Mosul, including many years ago against ISIL's earlier incarnation, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). The Minister of Defense ultimately agreed, but the Prime Minister asked for a confirmation from Erbil that any deployed Peshmerga units would withdraw after army units arrived. On June 9, the situation remained static, and the Government in Iraq expressed confidence that Mosul was not under a serious threat. Throughout the day, however, Mosul's western-most neighborhoods began to fall to ISIL. Its fighters began attacking checkpoints and killing resisters, seeking to establish psychological dominance over Iraqi security units in the city. Together with the United Nations team in Baghdad, we worked to help establish a mechanism whereby Peshmerga units would be authorized to reinforce the eastern half of the city pending the arrival of Iraqi units from the south, and then withdraw after the situation stabilized. Baghdad asked to further review the proposal. In the early morning hours of June 10, ISIL detonated a suicide truck bomb at a checkpoint across a strategic bridge and began to flow forces into the eastern side of the city. The next few hours would prove fateful. Iraqi units abandoned their posts, and ISIL swept through the city, seizing control of the provincial council building, the airport, and then, ultimately, Iraqi military bases. Nearly 500,000--out of a total population of 2 million Iraqis--fled, seeking refuge in Kurdish-controlled areas. Around 3 a.m., we received distressed messages from Iraqi officials in Baghdad, requesting the Kurdish Peshmerga to move into Mosul as soon as possible. The Iraqi request came too late. The fall of Iraq's second-largest city to ISIL was combined with a social media campaign indicating that ISIL columns would soon be heading down the Tigris River Valley to Baghdad with no mercy for anyone who resisted. The result was a devastating collapse of the Iraqi Security Forces from Mosul to Tikrit. Nearly five Iraqi Army and Federal Police divisions (out of 18 total) would disintegrate over the next 48 hours. This snowballing effect immediately threatened Baghdad, with serious concern that Iraqi Forces guarding its northern approaches might also collapse. Over the next 3 days, in meetings with our Embassy team and videoconferences with President Obama and the National Security Council, we immediately prepared and executed our crisis response. We also worked closely with Iraqi officials to organize the defenses of Baghdad and restore some of the confidence that had been battered. ii. u.s. response Our response to the immediate crisis proceeded along three parallel tracks. First, and most importantly, we worked to ensure the security of our own personnel and facilities. Second, in parallel, we both relocated and surged U.S. diplomatic, intelligence, and military resources to develop strategic options for the President with real-time and accurate information. Third, we worked with Iraqi officials to strengthen their defenses of strategic locations, and set the political process on track, with a focus on forming a new government following national elections. The key elements of this response plan included the following eight steps, which, taken as a whole, encompassed security, intelligence, political, and diplomatic measures: (1) Ensuring the Safety of U.S. Personnel and U.S. Citizens Our first priority was ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel. This required relocating some personnel and adding additional security capabilities at the Embassy compound and the airport. Additionally, there were a number of American contractors at Balad Air Base working on Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases. Reports from near Balad, which later proved false, suggested the base faced an imminent ISIL attack. After the contractors encountered delays securing their own charter aircraft, the Iraqi Air Force helped evacuate nearly 500 U.S. citizens and third-country nationals on June 14 aboard Iraqi C-130 aircraft. All contractors left safely, and we are grateful to the Iraqi Government and its pilots, most of whom we trained, for their assistance during this crisis period, particularly given their own competing demands.\\1\\ At the same time, we took extraordinary measures to ensure the safety of our Baghdad-based personnel. The entire National Security Council team, from the President on down, focused intensively to deploy Department of Defense security assets from elsewhere in the region while the Country Team worked intensively with Washington to relocate some personnel to safer areas. Within 72 hours we brought significant defensive capacity into our facilities and rebalanced staff to help manage the crisis. These early moves proved essential to ensuring that U.S. diplomats could continue to do their jobs and protect U.S. interests. Today, even as the immediate crisis has passed, we are constantly reviewing our footprint to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and facilities. (2) Improving Intelligence Picture on ISIL Another immediate need was to get a better intelligence picture. From Erbil, even before Mosul fell, I was in touch with General Austin who recognized the urgency of the situation and prepared to deploy additional intelligence assets. In the earliest days, however, when asked about the situation, we had to acknowledge that we were operating in a fog. Rumors of ISIL convoys approaching Baghdad could not be discounted and there were tense moments as we sought to separate rumor and propaganda from fact without immediate eyes on the ground. Today, this fog has lifted--quite dramatically--thanks to immediate decisions taken by the President. In response to these early developments, we dedicated a substantial amount of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets to fly over Iraq. These missions have enhanced our intelligence picture and provided critical information to Iraqi Forces defending strategic locations, while at the same time helping to establish a foundation from which the President can assess the merit of additional measures. (3) Assessing the Capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces In the early hours of the crisis, we worked quickly to reverse the collapsing morale of Iraqi Security Forces, reconstitute key units, and ensure the units deployed around Baghdad could adequately defend the capital. Our sight picture was imprecise, and the prerequisite to concrete action was acquiring a firsthand, eyes-on accounting of the situation. In my meetings with Iraqi officials, they said they would welcome U.S. Special Operations Forces to assess Iraqi force capabilities. The President authorized the deployment of six Special Operations Forces ``assessment teams'' to augment efforts that were previously underway through our Office of Security Cooperation. These teams have recently completed an initial, 2-week assessment of Iraqi units in and around the greater Baghdad area, examining each unit's capabilities and potential for a closer U.S. partnership. This mission has already provided greater visibility into the situation on the ground, and will help the national security team calibrate additional and tailored measures. The Department of Defense is currently reviewing this comprehensive assessment, which, as the President has said, is designed help determine ``how we can best train, advise, and support Iraqi Security Forces going forward.'' (4) Establishing Joint Operations Centers in Baghdad and Erbil To harness an improving intelligence picture, we have stood up two combined Joint Operations Centers (JOCs) in Baghdad and Erbil. These JOCs help ensure a constant 24/7 flow of real-time intelligence information from across Iraq. We are now able to coordinate closely with Iraqi Security Forces, the Ministry of Defense, and the Baghdad Operations Center (BOC). The Baghdad JOC is fully functional and has dramatically improved our ability to understand and assess the situation on the ground. I visited the JOC shortly before departing Baghdad last week, and it is an impressive operation, which began from scratch only 6 weeks ago. Most of our military personnel operating the facility have extensive experience and relationships inside Iraq. They report that their Iraqi counterparts have fully embraced our assistance and are asking for more, hoping that the United States will serve as their essential partner in the fight against ISIL. The Government of Iraq has also made some welcome decisions in recent weeks to improve this bilateral coordination, including appointment of new commanders, many with longstanding ties and relationships with their U.S. military counterparts. (5) Positioning U.S. Military Assets in the Region In the immediate wake of the crisis, the Department of Defense reinforced assets in the region to prepare for multiple contingencies, including the possibility of targeted and precise military action against targets associated with ISIL. On June 16, Secretary Hagel ordered the USS Mesa Verde, carrying a complement of MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, into the gulf. Its presence added to that of other U.S. naval ships in the Gulf--including the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, a cruiser, and three destroyers. These assets will provide our senior leaders with additional options in the event military action is deemed necessary to protect U.S. interests as the situation develops. They also complement the substantial defensive capabilities now on the ground to ensure the safety and security of our personnel and facilities. (6) Getting the Political Process on Track ISIL attacked Mosul at a time of extreme political volatility. On April 30, 2 months before the crisis, Iraq conducted credible national elections, in which 62 percent of Iraq's eligible voters participated. This high turnout included Ninewa, where Mosul is the capital, with nearly 1.1 million voters turning out (54.4 percent), despite explicit ISIL threats to kill anyone who participates in the political process. When ISIL moved in force into Mosul on June 10, the votes had been counted but not yet certified. The 4-year Parliament's term had ended, and a new Parliament, with its 328 Members chosen in the election, had yet to convene. The attack, thus, took place during a political vacuum, and purposefully so. ISIL clearly took a play from its earlier incarnation, AQI, which led the devastating Samarra mosque attack shortly after December 2005 elections, triggering years of sectarian conflict. Their long-stated aim has always been to spark a collapse of the political process.\\2\\ We worked immediately to ensure ISIL could not succeed in destroying the Iraqi political process. First, we urged Iraq's Government to finalize the election results, which would set in place a series of timelines for forming a new government. This required judges who had fled Baghdad to return. They did so, and ratified the election, on June 16. The next day, Iraqi religious and political leaders from all major communities declared ISIL ``an enemy of all Iraqis'' and requested international assistance to combat the threat. Second, we worked with the U.N. to press Iraqi leaders to convene the Parliament on time, no later than July 1, which it did. Third, we pressed all newly elected political blocs to choose their leaders for key posts, pursuant to the constitutional timeline for forming a new government. This process now has some traction. On July 15, the Parliament confirmed a new Speaker, which is the first position to be named pursuant to the constitutional steps required to form a new government. The moderate Sunni leader, Salim al-Jabouri, received votes from all major political blocs and was confirmed overwhelmingly, together with two deputies. The next step is confirming a President, which may happen as early as this coming week. Once there is a President, there will be a 15-day deadline to charge a Prime Minister nominee to form a government. It is not the job of the United States to choose Iraq's leaders. We neither want to, nor have the power to do so. Iraq has a parliamentary system, and the next Prime Minister of Iraq must secure a 165-seat majority to form a new government. We do have an obligation, however, pursuant to our Strategic Framework Agreement, to ``support and strengthen Iraq's democracy.'' Thus, from the moment this crisis began, we have actively prodded the process forward, serving as a neutral broker, and encouraging all Iraqi leaders to form a new government with leaders who reflect a broad national consensus between component communities. The administration has been engaged on this issue from the outset, including the visit from Secretary Kerry to Baghdad on June 23, and to Erbil on June 24. The Secretary and the Vice President have also made regular phone calls to Iraqi leaders and to our regional partners to discuss the emerging situation and to help broker compromises where necessary to advance the political process and keep the system on track. As President Obama has made clear, the Iraqi people deserve a government that represents the legitimate interests of all Iraqis. We are cautiously hopeful that Iraq's newly elected leaders are on their way to forming such a government, and as they do, they will find a committed partner in the United States. (7) Building Regional Coalescence Against ISIL At its root, ISIL is not strictly an Iraq problem. It is a regional and international problem. The Government of Iraq has requested international assistance, and it has stated clearly that it cannot manage this problem on its own, particularly with an open border and ISIL safe havens and staging areas in Syria. Accordingly, we have been regularly engaged with Iraq's neighbors and our key partners. The U.N. Security Council, European Union, Arab League, and NATO have strongly condemned ISIL's actions and expressed strong support for the people of Iraq. Secretary Kerry's extensive trip to the region, capped by a quadrilateral meeting in Paris with the Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and UAE, and then a visit to Riyadh for a meeting with King Abdullah, led to a new commonality of effort against ISIL. Shortly after Secretary Kerry visited Riyadh, Saudi Arabia pledged $500 million to U.N. relief agencies managing the humanitarian response in Iraq. In parallel, we are working with all of our regional partners to close down foreign fighter networks that continue to send thousands of terrorists into Syria, many of whom make their way to Iraq, with up to 50 per-month becoming suicide bombers. We are also mindful of Iran's influence in Iraq and have seen Iran and Russia work to fill a security vacuum in the early weeks of the crisis. These activities are part of our daily conversations with Iraqi political and military officials, and we are confident that most Iraqi leaders want to retain strategic independence, while also grappling desperately with the serious threats to the Iraqi capital and the Iraqi people. (8) Coordinating Humanitarian Relief Efforts and Protecting Religious Minorities Finally, ISIL's advances have exacerbated a humanitarian crisis. The U.N. estimates that more than 1.2 million Iraqis have been displaced in fighting since ISIL moved into major cities in Anbar earlier this year. More than 300,000 Iraqis have fled to the Iraqi Kurdistan region since the fall of Mosul on June 10. We have praised the efforts of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in dealing with the situation, and call on the KRG to continue these efforts, as well as the Government of Iraq to assist the KRG with additional resources. As noted, numerous countries have come forward and donated to the U.N.'s appeal for humanitarian assistance. In addition to Saudi Arabia, other contributors include Kuwait, Japan, New Zealand, and a number of others. The United States to date has contributed $13.8 million in humanitarian assistance in response to this crisis, and we are working closely with the U.N. team in Iraq to coordinate the response. We are also particularly concerned about the state of the Christian community in Iraq, including in Mosul where this ancient community is being expelled by ISIL on threat of execution. There are now reports of the community's full scale departure, which saddens us deeply. We have also seen reporting of ISIL blinding and killing 13 Yezidi men when they refused to convert to Islam and the kidnapping of two Chaldean nuns and three teenage orphans in Mosul. We denounce these brutal actions vigorously. These actions by ISIL in Mosul--killing Christians, burning churches, killing moderate Sunnis, destroying Islamic tombs-- prove to the world the barbarity of their objectives and why they must be stopped before their roots deepen. Over the past 2 weeks alone, I met with the Christian leadership in Iraq, including Chaldean Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako in Baghdad, and Archbishop Bashar Warda in Erbil. I am always impressed by the deep faith and resilience of these leaders. In Baghdad, Patriarch Sako, shortly before my visit, presided over a mass with nearly 500 worshipers from across the capital. Both leaders also expressed detailed concerns about the plight of Christians in northern Iraq, and we are working with them and KRG leaders to ensure new Christian enclaves are protected and secured. Finally, we are deeply troubled by ISIL's treatment of women as we receive a steady stream of reporting regarding women being deprived of their basic rights and subjected to gross violations of their freedom. iii. current situation It is now 7 weeks since this crisis began. Mosul remains in the hands of ISIL. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, gave a sermon on July 4, at one of Mosul's oldest mosques, an act made possible after ISIL executed its moderate Imam and 13 other leading clerics in the city. The Iraq-Syria border, hundreds of miles between the Kurdish region and Jordan, is controlled on both sides by ISIL. Weapons and fighters now flow freely between Iraq and Syria, resupplying ISIL units fighting on both fronts. To say this situation is extremely serious would be an understatement. The situation is dire, and it presents a direct threat to all the Iraqi people, the region, and to U.S. interests. Our immediate response, however, helped provide a barrier against further deterioration, and may offer a new foundation on which to begin fighting back. Since the first week of the crisis, the Iraqis--working closely with us--managed to absorb the shock, restore some morale, and began to push back, albeit with halting and uneven steps. On the security front, an immediate focus was restoring control of portions of Highway One, which runs parallel to the Tigris River from Baghdad to Mosul. Iraqi Forces during the third week of the crisis managed to clear the highway from Baghdad to Samarra, ensuring a steady resupply for the historic shrine city. During the fourth week of the crisis, they cleared most of the highway from Samarra to Tikrit, although sophisticated IED emplacements, ISIL snipers, and repeated suicide attacks have halted progress.\\3\\ These operations remain extremely challenging, and we have differed with the Iraqis on some of their tactical objectives, such as moving into the city of Tikrit, which did not seem militarily essential given the need to focus on supply routes. They have, however, gradually allowed the Iraqis to move out of a defensive crouch and pressure the ISIL networks north of Baghdad, which had been poised to advance further to the south toward the capital. We are also urging the Iraqis to immediately focus security efforts to the west, where tribes continue to hold out against ISIL near Haditha, blunting what had been a rapid ISIL advance following the fall of Al Qaim, on the Syria border, on June 21. The tribal situation in western and north-central Iraq remains fluid. Many tribes are now actively fighting ISIL--but lack the resources to do so effectively. According to our regular contacts in these areas ISIL is able to overmatch any lightly armed tribal force. The complete withdrawal of the Iraqi Army from these areas, together with the lack of coverage by Iraqi aviation in the border regions, provides ISIL free rein to move manpower and heavy weapons to areas where tribes resist. The result has been many long-standing enemies of ISIL and its earlier incarnation AQI--such as Albu Mahal tribe in western Anbar; Shammar in western Ninewa; Obeidi south of Kirkuk; and Jabbouri in central Salah ad-Din--risk making accommodations to ISIL due primarily to the reality of battlefield dynamics. These tribes may have issues with the central government, but that alone is not why ISIL infiltrated their areas. In Al Qaim, for example, the Albu Mahal resisted ISIL for months, before the town ultimately fell after waves of attacks from across the Syrian border weakened Iraqi defense forces. A tangible example of this dynamic is the Sunni town of Zowiya, near Tikrit in north-central Iraq. The residents there, a mix of Jabbouri and other tribes, resisted ISIL and would not accept their presence in the town. The result, as reported in the media and confirmed by our own contacts, was an ISIL military assault to kill all the residents of the village, starting with an hour-long artillery barrage. ISIL fighters then swept into the village, forcing surviving residents to flee, and sending the message to surrounding areas that any tribal resistance to their movement would be futile--and crushed. As a result, absent some military pressure on ISIL, we are unlikely to see a broad-based tribal uprising against the movement, as happened between 2007 and 2008. This tribal uprising was enabled by U.S. military forces, which applied consistent and relentless pressure on then-AQI leadership networks, staging areas, and supply routes. While the Iraqis will never match this level of pressure, we must help enable their forces to better deny safe haven to ISIL within Iraqi territory. The Iraqis must also focus on training and equipping locally grown units to secure local areas. As the President said in his June 19 statement on the situation in Iraq, ``the best and most effective response to a threat like ISIL will ultimately involve partnerships where local forces, like Iraqis, take the lead.'' The Iraqis recognize this principle, as well, and they have undertaken a reassessment of how their security forces are structured and might be reconstituted. Based on our most recent meetings with Iraqi security commanders, this effort will proceed in three phases. First, the Iraqis have begun to recall soldiers from dissolved units for retraining at two sites north of Baghdad. They report that nearly 10,000 have answered this call. Second, they are recruiting from existing units and from new volunteers for elite counterterrorism forces, similar to those we train through our Office of Security Cooperation. Third, they are looking to dramatically restructure their security services, with units recruited locally to secure local areas, while the national army provides overwatch support. Such a program may take many months to demonstrate results, and years to provide a lasting foundation for sustainable security. It will also be linked to the process of forming a new government, requiring a full national commitment and national resource base to ensure effective execution. It remains in our interest, together with such a national commitment from a new government, to provide appropriate assistance and help this process unfold in a manner that can eliminate space for ISIL over the long term. iv. emerging way forward--a functioning federalism The crisis response described above, together with Iraqi efforts over the past month, contain the elements of a longer term strategy to deny space for ISIL. Any such strategy, to be effective, must be deliberate, long term, and multifaceted. In my discussions with Iraqi leaders from all communities over the past 6 weeks, there is an emerging political-military approach that might begin to address the root causes of the current crisis. First, it is important to focus at the outset on why this matters. The situation we confront is not simply about stabilizing Iraq, though that alone is an important interest. Rather, it is about ensuring that a movement with ambitions and capabilities greater than the al-Qaeda that we knew over the past decade does not grow permanent roots in the heart of the Middle East. Flush with thousands of foreign fighters and suicide bombers, ISIL in Syria and Iraq increasingly represents a serious threat to U.S. interests. Indeed, ISIL's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, seeks to follow in the footsteps of Osama bin Laden as the leader of a global jihad, but with further reach--from his own terrorist state in the heart of the Middle East. After Osama bin Laden was killed in May 2011, Baghdadi eulogized his death and promised ``violent retaliation.'' His audio messages routinely contain thinly veiled threats against the United States, and he has promised in a ``message to the Americans'' that ``we will be in direct confrontation.'' The ISIL suicide bombers--still averaging 30 to 50 per month--are increasingly Western passport holders. Days ago, ISIL boasted that an Australian and a German blew themselves up in Baghdad, and it is a matter of time before these suicide bombers are directed elsewhere. To combat this threat, we must proceed along three tracks. First, ISIL must be starved of resources, manpower, and foreign fighters. This requires working with our partners around the globe and especially with Turkey to seal the Syrian border from ISIL recruits. Second, the safe havens and training camps in Syria must be isolated and disrupted, preferably by the moderate opposition, enabled by U.S. training. Third, Iraqis must be enabled to control their sovereign space and reconstitute their western border with Syria, through capacity development, tribal engagement, and targeted military pressure. This third element is essential, and achievable. It will require commitments from Iraq and support from the United States. Our perspectives may not always be the same, but our efforts must be mutually reinforcing. This is because, while ISIL presents a serious counterterrorism challenge to the United States, the Government of Iraq also faces a serious counterinsurgency challenge, and the two are inextricably linked. Our combined focus must be on isolating ISIL from the broader population and empowering tribes and other local actors to effectively combat it. This will require a combination of political and security measures, based on the principle of a ``functioning federalism'' as defined in the Iraqi Constitution-- but never fully and effectively implemented. In our view, a functioning federalism would empower local populations to secure their own areas with the full resources of the state in terms of benefits, salaries, and equipment. The national army, under this concept, would focus on securing international borders and providing overwatch support where necessary to combat hardened terrorist networks. Other critical reforms, such as an amnesty for those detained without trial, amendments to the criminal procedure laws, and addressing other legitimate grievances from the Iraqi people including those related to de-Ba'athification, will also be necessary elements to strengthen and empower local actors to stand and fight ISIL.\\4\\ While these concepts remain embryonic, and ultimately will require a new government to flesh out and develop, the five core principles can be summarized as follows: 1. Local citizens must be in the lead in securing local areas; 2. Local citizens defending their communities must be provided state benefits and resources (modeled along the lines of a National Guard type force structure); 3. The Iraqi Army will rarely deploy inside cities, but will remain outside in an overwatch posture and to carry out federal functions (such as protecting borders); 4. There must be close cooperation between local, regional (KRG), and national security services to gradually reduce operational space for ISIL; 5. The Federal Government must work diligently on a package of reforms that can address legitimate grievances and deny any pretext for ISIL activities. These five principles can begin to address many of the core grievances in the Sunni-majority areas of Iraq, while also, importantly, denying space for ISIL to operate and thereby protect the Shia majority and other groups from ISIL attacks. Cooperation will be essential. The Government of Iraq from the center cannot restore stability in many areas that ISIL now controls, nor can local actors do so--without support and national-level resources--given ISIL's demonstrated capacity. Restoring stability and degrading ISIL will require a smart, integrated (central-regional-provincial) approach, led by a new Iraqi Government with an appropriate level of U.S. support and assistance. Conclusion The situation in Iraq remains extremely serious. While our immediate crisis response may have blunted the initial security crisis, ISIL represents a growing threat to U.S. interests in the region, local populations, and the homeland. Countering this threat will require close coordination between the administration and the Congress, and between the U.S. and our regional partners. I look forward to working closely with this committee to ensure that we are doing all we can to address this vital national security challenge. ---------------- Notes \\1\\ This cooperation is one of many examples of why it remains a vital interest for the United States to maintain our relationships with the Iraqi Security Forces, whether through our foreign military sales programs or training and advisory missions. The Iraqi Security Forces today face an existential threat, yet the quality of units varies widely from the highly proficient and professional to the incompetent and corrupt. The Iraqis recognize the serious work they must do to further professionalize the force, and they have asked for our assistance. It is in our interest to provide such assistance where we assess it can be effective, both to help confront the immediate crisis more effectively, and to build the long-term partnerships that are essential to maintaining strategic influence. \\2\\ The AQI attack on Samarra came at precisely the same moment in the political process as the 2014 ISIL move into Mosul: 2 months after national elections, after the expiration of full-term institutions, and before the selection of new leadership. The pace of signature AQI (now ISIL) attacks--measured by suicide and vehicle bombs--were also nearly identical in the months before the 2006 and 2010 elections, running at nearly 80 per month. In the 30 days prior to the April 2014 elections, ISIL launched over 50 suicide attacks inside Iraq with nearly all of the suicide bombers, according to our assessments and ISIL's own statements, foreign fighters who enter Iraq from Syria. \\3\\ During this period of crisis, Iraqi forces have increasingly relied on volunteers from southern Iraq to hold stretches of the highway cleared by security forces. Many of these volunteers have affiliations with Shia militia groups, and in the earliest weeks of the crisis, they operated in the open for the first time in years. Since then, Grand Ayatollah Sistani has stated clearly that any volunteers should only join established state security services, and emphasized that militias or individual gunmen should not be accepted on the streets. The United States will continue to encourage Iraqi leaders to establish legal and practical mechanisms to incorporate volunteers, including tribal fighters, into the state security structures, where they can be trained to protect the population consistent with the rule of law. \\4\\ There are three fighting groups in the Sunni areas of Iraq. To be effective, any political-military initiative must focus on each of them. First, and most prominently, is ISIL. While there is no political solution to ISIL, political initiatives can help isolate ISIL from other associated groups. The second group is Jaysh al-Tariqa al- Naqshabandi (JRTN). JRTN is a militant wing of the former Ba'ath Party, now led by Saddam's former Vice President, Izzat al-Douri. While the most militant core of JRTN will remain nonresponsive to political initiatives, such initiatives can help minimize that core and degrade the network. The third group includes national insurgent movements, such as the Islamic Army, with some associated tribes. These groups mostly want local security control, and rarely launch offensive operations outside of their local areas. For them, there is a political solution, and through some of the reforms discussed above, these groups can probably be harnessed to protect local areas from ISIL infiltration over time. The Chairman. Ms. Slotkin. STATEMENT OF ELISSA SLOTKIN, PERFORMING THE DUTIES OF THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR POLICY, AND PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, WASHINGTON, DC Ms. Slotkin. Thank you. Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Corker, and distinguished members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the administration's response to the current security situation. My remarks will focus on what the Department of Defense is particularly doing. I just want to foot-stomp some of the things that Brett just said. The United States does have a vital national security interest in ensuring that Iraq or any other country does not become a safe haven for terrorists who could threaten the United States homeland, our United States citizens, or our interests abroad. As the President has said, ISIL's advance across Iraqi territory in recent weeks, and particularly its ability to establish safe haven in the region, poses a threat to United States interests and the Middle East. I do not restrict my views and my comments today just to Iraq, the geographic borders of Iraq. I do believe we have a real regional problem on our hands. As Brett has said, the situation on the ground is complex and fluid. We are therefore taking a responsible, deliberate, and flexible approach to the crisis. But I do want to be clear: There is no exclusively military solution to the threat posed by ISIL. The Iraqis must do the heavy lifting. In the meantime, the Department of Defense remains postured should the President decide to use military force as part of a broader strategy. Our immediate goals, as announced on June 19, are to: one, protect the people and property, our people and property in Iraq; two, to gain a better understanding of how we might train, advise, and support the Iraqi Security Forces should we decide to do that; and number three, to expand our understanding, particularly via intelligence, of ISIL. All three are critical to any future U.S. strategy vis-a-vis Iraq. To that end, we have done four things in the Department of Defense. We have added forces to protect our people. The safety of our citizens obviously is our highest priority. The Department has met the requests of the Department of State. As described in the war powers notification we have transmitted, the Department of Defense has sent what is called a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team, what we call a FAST Team, a crisis response element, and additional military assets and personnel to reinforce security both at our diplomatic facilities in Baghdad and at the Baghdad International Airport. The Secretary of Defense has also ordered the amphibious transport ship USS Mesa Verde into the Arabian Gulf. Its presence in the gulf is added to other naval ships, including the U.S. aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, and provides the President additional options to protect American citizens and interests in Iraq should he choose to use them. Number two, we have vastly increased our intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, ISR, assets. At the request of the Government of Iraq, we have surged ISR over Iraq since the fall of Mosul and increased our information-sharing activities. These ISR sorties, which are up to 50-plus per day, give us a much better understanding of ISIL operations and disposition and allow us to help the ISF counter ISIL. We are now capable of around-the-clock coverage of Iraq and have been focusing our efforts on ISIL-controlled territory as well as Baghdad. We have also sent in U.S. assessment teams and stood up joint operations centers. On June 19 the President announced these additional measures, including the deployment of just about 300 additional U.S. military advisers to evaluate how we might best train, advise, and support the ISF. These small teams of Special Forces are working to evaluate the ISF in and around Baghdad in particular. The teams are armed for self-defense, but they do not have an offensive mission. And then the two joint operations centers, one in Baghdad, one in Erbil in northern Iraq. They have both been established to help support our efforts on the ground. A quick word about the assessments. I know that is of interest. Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey received the draft assessment of the ISF last week from Central Command. Department leaders are undertaking a deliberate and rigorous review of the assessment, which will inform recommendations to the President. Meanwhile, additional assessment work continues. As you heard, General Austin is on the ground today with respect to the developing situation on the ground. In closing, I just want to reiterate that we have a vital security interest in ensuring that Iraq or any other country not become a safe haven for terrorists. We do need a regional approach, and I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Ms. Slotkin follows:] Prepared Statement of Elissa Slotkin Chairman Menendez, Ranking Member Corker, and distinguished members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the administration's response to the current security situation in Iraq. My remarks today will focus on two areas: (1) An overview of our national security interests in Iraq, and (2) a review of President Obama's current policy toward Iraq. u.s. national security interests The U.S. has a vital national interest in ensuring that Iraq, or any other country, does not become a destabilized safe haven for terrorists who could threaten our homeland or U.S. interests and citizens abroad. As the President has said, ISIL's advance across Iraqi territory in recent weeks, and particularly its ability to continue to establish a safe haven in the region, poses a threat to both U.S. interests and the Middle East. In considering the ISIL threat, we don't restrict our view of the threat to specific geographic boundaries. current u.s. efforts in iraq Despite this complex and fluid situation, we are taking a responsible, deliberate, and flexible approach to this crisis. I want to be clear that there is no exclusively military solution to the threats posed by ISIL in Iraq. However, DOD remains postured should the President decide to use military force as part of a broader strategy. Our immediate goals, as announced on June 19, are to (1) protect our people and property in Iraq; (2) gain a better understanding of how we might best train, advise, and support the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) capabilities should we decide to support the ISF going forward; and (3) expand our understanding--particularly via intelligence--of ISIL. All three are critical to any future U.S. strategy vis-a-vis Iraq. To that end we have done the following four things. Added Forces to Protect our People First, we have added forces to protect U.S. personnel in Iraq. The safety of U.S. citizens and personnel in Baghdad and throughout Iraq is our highest priority. The Department of Defense is meeting all requests from the Department of State for security support to U.S. Embassy Baghdad. As described in the War Powers notifications we transmitted to Congress on June 16 and 26, DOD has sent a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team (FAST), a Crisis Response Element (CRE), and additional military assets and personnel to reinforce security at our diplomatic facilities in Baghdad and the Baghdad International Airport. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel also ordered the amphibious transport ship USS Mesa Verde into the Arabian Gulf. Its presence in the gulf adds to that of other U.S. naval ships--including the aircraft carrier USS George HW Bush--and provides the President additional options to protect American citizens and interests in Iraq, should he choose to use them. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Second, as part of this effort, we have surged intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities in Iraq. At the request of the Government of Iraq, we surged ISR over Iraq after the fall of Mosul and also increased information-sharing initiatives. These ISR sorties provide us a better understanding of ISIL operations and disposition and allow us to help the ISF counter ISIL. We are now capable of around-the-clock coverage over Iraq and have been focusing our efforts on ISIL-controlled territory as well as Baghdad. U.S. Assessment Teams and Joint Operations Centers (JOCs) Third, we continue to assess the capabilities of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). On June 19, the President announced additional measures-- including the deployment of up to 300 additional U.S. military advisors to evaluate how we might best train, advise, and support the ISF. These small teams of special forces are working to evaluate the Iraqi Security Forces in and around Baghdad. They are armed for self- defense--but do not have an offensive mission. And fourth, following the President's direction, two Joint Operation Centers (JOCs), one in Baghdad and one in northern Iraq, have been established to help support our efforts on the ground. The initial assessment mission is not unlike many others that DOD performs around the world. We currently maintain special operators in more than 70 countries, in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. Furthermore, since the U.S. troop drawdown in December 2011, a small presence of military personnel has been located at the Embassy in Baghdad, consistent with the 2008 Strategic Framework Agreement. Secretary Hagel and Chairman Dempsey received the draft assessment of the ISF last week from Central Command. Department leaders are undertaking a deliberate and rigorous review of the assessment, which will inform recommendations to the President. Meanwhile, additional assessment work continues with respect to the developing situation on the ground. In closing, I want to reiterate that there is no exclusively military solution to the threats posed by ISIL. However, we do have a vital security interest in ensuring that Iraq, nor any other country, becomes a safe haven for terrorists who could threaten our homeland or U.S. interests and citizens abroad. The Chairman. Thank you. Yesterday, during yesterday's hearing with the House Foreign Affairs Committee, you both argued that the policy of the United States should be for a unified Iraq with a strong Baghdad-based Federal Government. But many look and say that what is happening on the ground is accelerating toward a breakup of Iraq because too many of Iraq's communities no longer trust the Maliki government, and the question is whether there is anything we can do to prevent it. Mr. McGurk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we testified clearly and in my written statement, as well, that the model is a functioning federalism under the Iraqi Constitution. So nobody is trying to fit a square peg into a round hole that simply will not work. There is a model within the constitution for this functioning federalism, in which you recognize a very substantial devolution of authorities, the principles of local security control. That is something that I found in my last 7 weeks: there is an emerging consensus around. Through the process of forming a new government, I think the details will be fleshed out. I know General Austin is discussing some of these concepts as we speak, particularly when it comes to restructuring the security forces. So I do not think anyone is trying to create a strong central government that is going to retain control all over the country. In fact, I think everybody recognizes now that from the center out you are not going to be able to retain control in all parts of the country, but also, most importantly, locals and tribes on their own will not be able to deny space for ISIL, because of ISIL's very significant military capability. So you need a principle of local security control, but with a national resource base, and that is all within the federalist model of the constitution. The Chairman. The question is, though, can you even get to a federalist model the way things are evolving in Iraq? Mr. McGurk. I think you can, because of---- The Chairman. What needs to happen? Mr. McGurk. Well, first we have to get a new government formed, and that is very important because the new government will obviously be the body that directs where the resources go. The Chairman. What do we envision the timeframe of that being? It is past due, right? Mr. McGurk. Under the constitutional framework and the time lines, as soon as there is a new President, which just happened, there is now a 15-day timeline to charge a Prime Minister to form a government. So, we will know within 15 days the Prime Minister nominee. Whoever that is, he then has 30 days to name a Cabinet and present the Cabinet to Parliament for a vote. Those timelines, however, can be substantially accelerated. For example, under the constitution, once there is a Speaker, there are 30 days to name a President. They did that in, I think, about 8 days. We are working very hard to accelerate those timelines. The Chairman. Now, if it ends up being Prime Minister Maliki, how do you think that you keep this government together, this nation together? Mr. McGurk. As I mentioned in my statement, as the President has said, it is not our job to pick the leaders, but the leaders do have to have a very inclusive agenda and pull the country together. The Chairman. I am not asking you to pick, nor do I suggest we should. The question is that if that is the result by their own choice it seems to me that it is very difficult, based upon what has happened so far, based upon Sunni responses to ISIS, at least in the context of their grievances with the present national government, that--is not the likely outcome that we may see a divided Iraq? Mr. McGurk. The Prime Minister will be chosen from the Shia political blocs, and Grand Ayatollah Sistani, interestingly, over the last month has been very active, and he has laid down some guideposts for how to form the next government: first, it has to correct the mistakes of the past, meaning it cannot look anything like the current government; second, you need new leaders that reflect a national consensus. We have had that now with the Speaker and the President, and so the Prime Minister will also have to reflect that emerging national consensus. It remains to be seen whether the existing Prime Minister could build such a consensus, but that remains very much in question. The Chairman. You commented in the House hearing yesterday that options being developed for the President are more concrete and specific as a result of the U.S. military advisers on the ground and increased intelligence collection. What guidance have you received in terms of timing for these decisions and how will the political and security conditions on the ground influence the President's decisions? Ms. Slotkin. Well, as I said, the assessments came in last week. They are dense, they are significant. So we are still working through those. After we have done that, the Secretary and the Chairman will make informed recommendations to the President. The Chairman. Are you going to be able to tell us anything more than I read in the New York Times, which is more than I knew before you came here? Ms. Slotkin. I understand. I would caution against using a leaked half-report in the New York Times as your basis for understanding it. The Chairman. Well, the absence of having information leads me to only publicly reported resources. So when do you intend to come to us, in whatever setting, to advise the Congress? You know, this committee has jurisdiction over arms sales, and my reticence to arms sales to Iraq has in some respects been proven true when, in fact, we have had much of our equipment abandoned and now in the hands of ISIS. So unless you are going to give us a sense of where the security forces are at moving forward, this Chair is not going to be willing to approve more arms sales so they can be abandoned to go to the hands of those who we are seriously concerned about in terms of our own national security interests. Ms. Slotkin. Sir, I understand and our intent is to come and brief Congress at the time when we have piled through it ourselves. We have kept the Congress very informed. I know I have been up at least twice a week for our committees. We are committed to remaining in close contact with you and there is no attempt to hide it from you. Mr. McGurk. I would just add, Mr. Chairman, that I think we are in a race against time, there is no question. The Chairman. Well, that is my point. Mr. McGurk. And one thing that we have found, first of all, by surging Special Forces teams, by surging intelligence assets, as you mentioned, we do know an awful lot more than we knew even 6 weeks ago. Security forces around Baghdad and particularly north of Baghdad--I described this in some of my written testimony--are trying to do some things to fight back. They have taken nearly a thousand casualties in the last month. These units, particularly units that we have relationships with, are fighting, they are capable. And those are the types of units that we are looking at ways to further assist. But again, this is all being discussed by the national security team. The Chairman. Well, you have influences here. My understanding is Assad has been part of bombing ISIS in Iraq. Of course, you have Iran here. How is that going to complicate or instruct what you might be willing to do? Mr. McGurk. It is part of the overall assessment, and I can only speak from my own firsthand experience in the initial days of this crisis as ISIL, it looked like, was moving down the Tigris Valley; our information was very sketchy, there was a bit of a panic throughout the Iraqi Security Forces, and we had to bolster them and try to create a circuit breaker so that that advance halted. There was a security vacuum, that there is no question that our strategic competitors sought to step in and fill. Iraq lacks any capacity to do deep strikes in their border regions. Countries show up at their door and say, hey, we can help you with that. The Iraqis have pushed back in some regards, but in some respects they have accepted support. The Chairman. They have accepted Assad bombing, have they not? Mr. McGurk. No, no. We have no indication that there is any coordination with the Assad regime when it comes to security cooperation. But they are very concerned about the collapse of their border, particularly the collapse of Al-Qaim, which was a strategic border town which fell about 3 weeks ago. The Chairman. They have accepted Iranian support? Mr. McGurk. They have accepted low-level Iranian support; there is no question, yes. The Chairman. Senator Corker. Senator Corker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just along those lines, how do you assess U.S. influence right now? I know there are a number of other regional interests that are playing a role. I know that those of us who have visited recently know that before this all occurred U.S. influence was at an all-time low and really almost not present. I know that has changed some, but where would you assess our influence to be in Iraq right now? Mr. McGurk. Senator, since this crisis, particularly in Mosul, we have been embraced, particularly our military personnel who have come in. I was at the joint operations center, which we have set up now. I was there on Thursday speaking with all of our military personnel there, all of whom have years of experience in relationships in Iraq. We have been embraced by their military, particularly the Special Forces assessment team. The Iraqis have given us full access to their air space for our intelligence flights we want to do. They have given us the legal requirements we need to be there. So we have been embraced, and I think there is an opportunity because they certainly want our assistance. They want our equipment, they want our training. Our FMS package is about $15 billion total. They have paid about $11 billion of that. They put $193 million in the Federal Reserve into that account just last week. So the Iraqis are very eager, under our strategic framework agreement, for U.S. assistance to be the backbone of their response. But, of course, there are things that they need to do as well and that is the conversation we are having with them. Senator Corker. Are there competing interests? I mean, as you are deepening the relationship again and helping in the way that we are, are there conflicts or competing interests that you are dealing with there on the ground? Mr. McGurk. Yes, and in fact some of the tactics that the Iraqis pursue we totally do not agree with. In fact, I think by moving in aggressively as we have over the last 6 weeks, we will increasingly increase our influence over some of those tactics. We have advised the Iraqis, for example, not go to into urban areas--lessons that we learned. The Iraqis made a decision to go into Tikrit. We did not really support that decision. We have advised the Iraqis since January not to go into Fallujah. They have not gone into Fallujah. But there is a military conversation, which is a little bit outside of my expertise and that is why General Austin is on the ground as we speak, talking to their new military commanders. Just a point on our influence: I have had a number of conversations with the Prime Minister on down since January and have said: Your generals, Mr. Prime Minister, are not telling you the truth about the situation. That clearly was true, particularly in Mosul. Those commanders are now gone and they have appointed a series of new commanders, who we happen to work very closely with, and we hope that that type of relationship can continue. Senator Corker. I think that kind of involvement that we had and then we lost, where we were able to have the shuttle diplomacy and have the kind of activity that is now taking place, has helped create the situation that is on the ground, no doubt. On the other hand, Prime Minister Maliki has not been the kind of Prime Minister to create any kind of sense that a central government can resolve the ethnic and civil issues that exist there. Do you really believe, bottom of your heart, there is somebody in Iraq of the Shia sect that can do that as Prime Minister if we move through this process? Mr. McGurk. Senator, we have had extreme frustrations with the Iraqi Government, particularly over the last year, and that is one reason we have focused most decisively on making sure elections happen, they happen on time, and they were credible. And they did happen. They happened on April 30. They have created a new Parliament and through that Parliament new leaders will emerge. There are a handful of very capable leaders who may emerge as the next Prime Minister of Iraq, but we are going to have to see. This will unfold fairly rapidly over the coming days. Senator Corker. Ms. Slotkin, I know there was a little discussion between you and the chairman relative to the assessment that is taking place. Can you just broadly tell us of anything that you have learned over the last 3 weeks that you did not know prior to the assessment? Ms. Slotkin. Sure. I think the thing when we put the assessors on the ground that was the biggest open question, given the march ISIL had had across and into Mosul and down, was what was the status of Baghdad? Would the ISF be able to successfully defend Baghdad? That was our critical first question, especially given the size of our mission there. I think one of the early things that we saw as we got on the ground was that there was a stiffening of the Iraqi Security Forces in and around Baghdad to protect the capital, which we thought was critically important. So we certainly were not aware until we got on the ground. I do think some of the early indications are, frankly, mixed. There are some very capable units that have high morale and that are willing and capable of fighting, and there are other units where morale is lower, where there may not be as much capability and willingness to actually fight. It is sorting out the details of that that we are working on right now. Senator Corker. If you were to surmise after you do this assessment, what do you think the range of options will be that will be presented to the President relative to our activities militarily in Iraq? Ms. Slotkin. I think, without crowding any decision space, all the military options we could possibly consider have to fit into a much wider regional strategy that is not a lead by the military. Senator Corker. Tell me what that means? I know you have said that in your opening comments. Ms. Slotkin. Sure. Senator Corker. I think most people in this committee have been concerned. We had very, very strong support for efforts in Syria. Are you referring to Syria and Iraq? Is that basically the region? Ms. Slotkin. It is Syria and Iraq, given ISIL's march. But then in particular it is making sure that we do not see a further spread. I mean, I know everyone was concerned---- Senator Corker. Jordan. Ms. Slotkin. Exactly. Jordan has been particularly a focus for us, given the border area right there with Iraq. But this is part of the administration's attempt to try and create this counterterrorism partnership fund to shore up particularly the neighbors of Iraq and Syria, to make sure that they have a flexible way to respond to the threats, to make sure we do not see that spread, and then to ask for funding for training the vetted Syrian moderate opposition so we have some sort of attempt from the inside of Syria to secure up those areas as well. So it is impossible to just look at the ISIL threat at Iraq only because, as I said yesterday, it is kind of like air in a balloon; you squeeze on one end, it just goes somewhere else. We need a comprehensive approach outside in and inside out. Senator Corker. It is interesting you say that. I think people on this committee have been saying for like a year and a half that when the time was right, when we could have taken steps in Syria that could have prevented this, they were not taken. So now it is interesting that the administration is looking at a regional approach. Is that solely because now there is this counterterrorism issue, that the situation has gotten so bad--it did not have to, but it has gotten so bad now that it is a threat to the homeland and that is the reason you are looking at a regional approach? What do you think it is that has taken so long, with so many people crying out on both sides of the aisle to, please do something relative to the moderate opposition in Syria, knowing that there is no border there, knowing that it was destabilizing Iraq? Is it this counterterrorism issue solely that has now caused the administration to look at it regionally? Ms. Slotkin. I think the administration has been looking at this regionally for a while. Senator Corker. But it has been looking at it. Ms. Slotkin. Well, I actually do not think that is fair. I think that we have invested heavily in some serious border security work with Jordan. We have done programs with Lebanon, we have done programs with Turkey. This is not beginning from anew here. But I do think that the thing that surprised us, frankly, was the collapse of the Iraqi Security Forces in and around Mosul and four divisions essentially melting away. If you would have asked me that a year ago, I would have not assessed that. I think that the spread of ISIL, given the number of foreign passport holders that we know have traveled back and forth to Syria, Western passport holders, it does focus the mind. Senator Corker. If I could just ask one last question, or make a statement. We had a really, really strong vote here and a great debate on supporting the moderate opposition, and I was glad to get the call that the White House is now looking at I guess $500 million in actual Defense Department support for these moderates. I have to say--and the first time I have said it out loud-- I have now gotten to the point where I question--I hate to say it--how effective that is going to be at this point. I think there was a point in time when it could have been really effective. I now question whether now at this point, with all that has happened, knowing that ISIS has taken such a large part of the territory in Syria, I now question the effectiveness. And yet the administration really feels like that small amount at this late date still has the possibility to do real good in Syria. Ms. Slotkin. Sir, I think you cannot fight something with nothing. So I think that it is important to start. Senator Corker. Well, we have been doing that for a long time. So it is interesting. So I agree with you and I think everybody here does. I guess the question is, can you fight something with almost nothing at this point, when it has festered into this type of situation? The Chairman. And then we will have to move to Senator Boxer. Ms. Slotkin. I do think it is important. We have put together a program that is scaleable. You can start small and move up significantly in the numbers and scale of the program, and we think it is critical that we start. The Chairman. Senator Boxer. Senator Boxer. Thank you. I look at things just a little bit differently than a lot of folks here. I think the Iraqis had a chance of a lifetime and America's blood and treasure gave them that chance of a lifetime, a chance at unity, a chance at peace, and with their natural resources a chance at a growing economy. And clearly those of us, a minority of 23, who predicted this if we went to war, we did not prevail and that is life. You do not prevail, so you move on. And then later when then-Senator Biden, who was the chairman of this committee, proposed more autonomy for the Sunnis and for the Kurds--and by the way--more than 70 Senators voted for that. The then-Bush administration laughed at it, kind of like people laugh right now. That is a lot of laughing. And that was turned away. So the situation in Iraq I think is dire now, and I am not about to reinvest more lives and treasure. The United States has sacrificed too much. The war cost us $2 trillion. People predicted it would be over in weeks, months. More than 4,400 Americans were killed, their families never the same, 32,000 wounded during the course of the war. And we all know, and I praise Senators Sanders and McCain for battling to get help for those who are suffering from physical and mental injuries. So I am pleased that President Obama said unequivocally ``American Forces will not be returning to combat in Iraq,'' and I want to record to show that I will never vote to send more combat forces in. You know, you get so many chances in a lifetime. I want to ask you about the Kurds, both of you. I do not know which one. Either of you could answer. The Kurds in northern Iraq have long been a strong ally of the United States, and they have played an important role in countering the rapid advance of ISIS. When I went to Iraq a very long time ago, the bullets were flying. The Kurds, I found them to get what this was all about. There is so much prejudice against the Kurds. The Kurdish militia offered to support Iraqi Security Forces when ISIS began its offensive in Mosul. Kurdish forces have kept much of northern Iraq out of terrorist hands. Iraqi Kurdistan has become a destination for hundreds of thousands of Iraqis fleeing from ISIS-controlled territory. I have to say, as I watch Mr. Maliki, I do not think he appreciates it. As the Iraqis continue to work to determine their future, I am asking you, what role can the Kurds continue to play, and should the United States acknowledge that the Kurds should have a significant amount of autonomy in a future Iraq? I think they have earned it, and I wondered what the administration's position is vis-a-vis the Kurds and more autonomy for the Kurds. Mr. McGurk. Thank you, Senator. We are in a very active conversation with all the Kurdish leaders about their future. There are some realities that they are grappling with, the geostrategic realities and geographic realities, also their economic realities. They need about $14 billion to sustain themselves operationally. Their share of the budget this year, which is pending in Baghdad, is about $17 billion. We think there is a deal there within the constitutional framework that is in the best interests of the Kurds and also our interests both in northern Iraq and Iraq as a whole. However, since this crisis began--and we recognize we are dealing with new realities on the ground that we have to recognize and deal with. We have established a joint operations center in Erbil to work with the Kurdish forces and with the Peshmerga to make sure, because they have about 1,000 kilometers now with ISIS on a good chunk of their border and they are going to need some help. But that will work most effectively if it is done in cooperation and coordination with Baghdad, of course with us providing a mediating role where necessary. So we are in a very active conversation with them. They have a good deal of autonomy now and I am sure that they will ask for more through the government formation process, and that will all be done under the constitution. President Barzani has been on the phone a number of times with our Vice President Biden to talk about these issues. Barzani has made it clear to us he wants to act through the constitutional framework for resolving some of the disputed boundaries in which the Peshmerga have moved by necessity over the last 6 weeks. So the short answer to your question, we are in a very active conversation with the Kurds about this, and I am happy to follow up with you as it unfolds over the coming months. Senator Boxer. And the United States will support more autonomy for the Kurds then, I assume? Mr. McGurk. Well, through the government formation process there will be an active debate. I will just say we very much support the Kurds on particular critical issues. Baghdad about 4 or 5 months ago cut funding for salaries of workers in the Kurdish region. We have made very clear that is completely, totally, unacceptable and that has to be reversed. The Kurds have also done some things in some cases in which we have said that might exacerbate tensions in a way that would not be particularly constructive. That is why we are in a very active conversation. But, we support autonomy within the constitutional framework, certainly. Senator Boxer. I am just saying, I do not know what the future is of that constitutional framework, but we all hope it works. The last question is: Are you confident we have adequate personnel on the ground to truly protect our Embassy and the Americans in Baghdad? Mr. McGurk. Senator, yes. We have moved in substantial assets both to the airport and also into the Embassy. I was just there as late as Thursday and we are confident that our defensive perimeters and everything, that our people will be safe. Our Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security just visited Baghdad last week to do his own assessment and we have also had teams on the ground from CENTCOM. This is an ongoing assessment. And our intelligence assets have the entire, everything, all around the perimeter of the city of Baghdad, the airport, and our Embassy very well covered. So we are confident. Senator Boxer. Can you tell us how many people we have at the Embassy, or is that something that you do not want to discuss in open session? Mr. McGurk. We have a total in Baghdad of about 2,500 now. Senator Boxer. Thank you. Thank you. The Chairman. Senator Johnson. Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McGurk, let us quickly go back to the Kurds. I have been made aware of the fact that the Baghdad Government is basically in arrears on the Kurds' budget by about $6 billion. Is that pretty accurate? Mr. McGurk. There are a lot of ways to do the accounting and the math. Baghdad claims the Kurds owe them money, the Kurds claim that Baghdad owes them money, and in that space is where a deal lies. I think that is going to be part of the conversation in forming a new government. Senator Johnson. If it is true that Baghdad owes them as much as $6 billion, would the United States support the Kurds' ability to export oil and obtain that revenue so they can keep themselves going? Mr. McGurk. We want to get as much oil onto international markets as possible from all parts of Iraq, and that is something that we very strongly support. We worked very hard over the last 6 months to get a deal on the table by which the Kurds would have exported as much oil as they possibly could through some of the existing arrangements, with the revenue- sharing allocations that exist. And that deal almost succeeded, but it ran up against the election timeframe, and once you had an election it was very difficult to close the deal. But I think we will be able to get that back on the table. But we want as much oil from Iraq north to south onto international markets as soon as possible. Senator Johnson. Now, I appreciate the fact that we are going through assessments and we are studying the problem. You have to recognize reality before you really develop a strategy. But, I really do want to just compare where we are now versus where we were prior to the 2007 surge. Mr. McGurk, you have been involved in this for quite some time. What was the level of the Iraqi Forces back in 2007? I really want some relatively quick answers here because I want to get some data points. Mr. McGurk. How do you measure the level? Senator Johnson. How many people were in the Iraqi Security Forces back in 2007? Mr. McGurk. I do not have the figure, but it was not a highly effective force in early 2007. Senator Johnson. America, we had about 132,000 at the start of the surge and we surged to about 168,000, correct? Mr. McGurk. That is right. Senator Johnson. What were we up against in terms of enemy fighters back in 2007? Mr. McGurk. We assess that the main enemy then was al-Qaeda in Iraq, which is ISIL. It is the same organization. Senator Johnson. And about how many people were we up against? Mr. McGurk. These figures are always very difficult. Senator Johnson. I understand. Mr. McGurk. We had assessments of 6 to 8,000 at the time, but probably more. Senator Johnson. So what do we think current ISIL forces are? Mr. McGurk. Currently, the assessments we have seen--but again they are very difficult to measure--15,000 or so, in Iraq far less. Senator Johnson. But basically double of what we had in 2007? Mr. McGurk. ISIL today, according to our assessments, is far more capable in manpower resources and fighting effectiveness than the AQI that we fought, yes. Senator Johnson. That is my point. U.S. troop levels right now in Iraq are how many? Mr. McGurk. Total now about---- Ms. Slotkin. We have inserted 775 or so and we have about 100 that were associated with our Office of Security Cooperation. Senator Johnson. So less than a thousand? Ms. Slotkin. Less than a thousand. Senator Johnson. Less than a thousand now. Back in 2007, prior to a pretty difficult battle, in terms of the surge, we had 168,000 at the height of that. And ISIL now is double the size that it was back in 2007 and they have some of our weapons; their capabilities are much higher. Mr. McGurk. That is right. Senator Johnson. What was the size of the Iraqi military force in June 2014, prior to ISIL's move into Iraq? What was our estimate there? Mr. McGurk. I do not have that figure, but I can get it for you. Senator Johnson. Are we talking hundreds of thousands? Mr. McGurk. Hundreds of thousands, but we try to look at capable and effective forces, and one of the purposes of the assessment was to determine which units are effective, which are ineffective. There are some units, quite frankly, that are totally ineffective and there are some units that are highly capable and effective. Senator Johnson. Ms. Slotkin, do you have that information? Ms. Slotkin. I think it is just shy of 200,000. Senator Johnson. Two hundred thousand prior to the intrusion, the invasion? Ms. Slotkin. I believe so. Senator Johnson. How many now do you think there are? You said that they lost four divisions. How many would that represent that have just melted into the background? Ms. Slotkin. Again, I do not have the exact number, but it is probably closer to 160-ish. Senator Johnson. Do you have any sense of what percentage of that force would have any effectiveness in terms of fighting? Mr. McGurk. In terms of the dissolved units, it was about 30,000. The Iraqis have since recalled about 10,000 and, according to our OSCI assessments, there are about 10,000 who have come back and are going through about a 3-week training course now. Senator Johnson. The effectiveness of the Iraqi Security Forces versus U.S. fighting forces? Not even comparable, right? Mr. McGurk. You cannot even compare them, no. Senator Johnson. We have got a real problem on our hands. We talked a little bit about the threat to our homeland that ISIL in Syria and Iraq represent. Can you describe what the threat to the homeland is because of the situation? Can you make the American people aware of why this matters? Mr. McGurk. What really concerns our counterterrorism experts and also concerns us is this rise in very dedicated global jihadist fighters coming from all over the world, many with Western passports. In Baghdad, just this week there was a suicide bomber. There was a German, there was an Australian. ISIL is able to funnel about 30 to 50 suicide bombers a month into Iraq. These are, we assess, almost all foreign fighters. It would be very easy for ISIL to decide to funnel that cadre of dedicated suicide bombers, global jihadis, into other capitals around the region, or Europe or, worse, here. So that is a very significant, significant concern. They have training bases in Syria and they are recruiting on social media and the Internet, and it is something that we have never seen before. Senator Johnson. A year ago the President declared the war on terror was over. Do you believe the war on terror is over? Mr. McGurk. I think we have a very significant fight on our hands with ISIL, which we have to manage. Senator Johnson. I have no further questions. The Chairman. Senator Cardin. Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank both of you for your appearance here today and for your service to our country. I certainly agree that the United States has a vital interest in containing ISIS' growth and it"
