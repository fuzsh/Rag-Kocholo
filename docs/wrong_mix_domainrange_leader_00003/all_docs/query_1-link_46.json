        "text": "Dear Lawrenceville Parents and Guardians,\n\nThere is a notably renewed energy on campus this week as we continued the steady and deliberate reintroduction of healthy rhythms and academic routines. On Monday, students heard from landscape architect Dequan Spencer of SCAPE design studio in New York, who spoke on urban design for climate resilience as well as on career pathways in landscape architecture for underrepresented communities. Stuart Robertson '11 H’18, Lawrenceville’s artist-in-residence, opened “A Portrait of the Artist as a Living System” in the Hutchins Galleries. His work will be on display through June 3 and represents the School’s welcome return to hosting public art exhibits and receptions, which had been put on hold during the pandemic. Big Red athletics is finishing up the spring season, competing for championships at both the MAPL and state levels. On Tuesday, both the boys' and girls' track squads won their respective NJISAA Prep A titles.\n\nMore than 800 alumni returned to campus over the weekend for the first Alumni Weekend since 2019; the three-year hiatus made this reunion all the more meaningful for our graduates, young and old, who came to reconnect with campus and celebrate their enduring Lawrenceville friendships. Despite the rain and heavy wind, there were uplifting gatherings across campus, including during the time-honored tradition of inducting Fifth Form students into Lawrenceville’s Alumni Association. Jack was poignantly recognized in various moments, including in one of the most moving elements of each Alumni Weekend, the Service of Remembrance. Indeed, the loss of Jack is felt profoundly among Lawrentians of every age and House, and has prompted important reflections and discussions as an extended community.\n\nThe lantern lighting on Wednesday evening, in honor of Jack and hosted on behalf of Dickinson House by the Pan Asian Alliance, was a powerful tribute. Many of our students gathered with their lanterns and messages to Jack, and at sunset the lanterns were lit and released onto the pond, symbolizing the guiding of soul and spirit. It was a moment of quiet and embrace, of collective peace. I invite you to watch this beautiful video of the event, produced by L10.\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff will come together in a final farewell to Jack on Sunday, May 15 at 5 p.m. in the Chapel, where our School chaplain, the Rev. Sue Anne Steffey Morrow H'12, will lead the community through hymns and prayers, readings and remembrances. The Lawrentians will fill the Chapel — and our hearts and souls — with stirring sound. Community members are encouraged to wear vibrant colors and patterns, representing the light and joy that Jack brought to those around him. Parents are invited to join via live stream, and Kirby Arts Center will be open for overflow viewing.\n\nI want to add here too that part of our commitment to Jack’s memory is reckoning with what occurred and seeking a more complete understanding. Yesterday you received the letter from Jon Weiss '75, president of the Board of Trustees. His letter to our parent body outlines the Board's commitment to a careful, independent investigation of these tragic circumstances. Since Monday, May 2, I have been in careful conversation with the leadership of the Board, who have shared from the start the same urgency I feel to get to the truth as best we can. We will continue to report on this, as we are able, in the weeks to come."
