        "text": "Issam Al Said was born in Baghdad, in 1938, of an Iraqi father and Egyptian mother and into an influential family: he was the grandson of Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri Al Said. His brother also was the personal pilot to King Hussein of Jordan. Al Said completed a degree in Architecture from Cambridge University in 1961 and a degree in Art from the Hammersmith College of Art and Design, London, in 1964. He was about to pursue a Ph.D. in Methodology of Geometric Proportioning in Islamic Architecture from the University of Newcastle in 1988 but unfortunately passed away the same year. His never-completed thesis was published posthumously by the Issam Al Said Foundation under the title Islamic Art and Architecture: The System of Geometric Design in 1993.\n\nIssam Al Said was a renowned Iraqi painter, architect, designer, printmaker, and author who's practice reconciles traditional crafts with modern tendencies. His broad interests and involvement in these fields showed his dedication to Islamic culture and fascination for geometry. He was also part of the Hurufiyya movement; by incorporating Kufi scripts to his creation, he addressed the traditional calligraphy from the perspective of modern Art. Al Said accomplished several public buildings in London and Baghdad, as well as furniture and carpets, lamps, tiles, and other items.\n\nThe artist died in London, 1988, at the young age of 50.\n\nThis is a short biography.
