        "text": "As I explain my my new book “The inevitable future of work”, interviews are going to evolve with AI. Platforms like HireVue will help decode candidate’s body language, voice tone, mimics etc to get additional signals about them and better fit a skill or candidate to the project… 👇👇👇👇👇 “…HireVue also uses voice recognition and facial recognition software, as well as a software ranking algorithm to determine which candidates are ideal for a specific job. An ideal candidate is defined by a combination of traits including body language, tone and keywords. The interview data is compared to approximately four million video interviews of top candidates in that specific role. HireVue's intelligent assessment service analyzes up to 25,000 data points for a single video interview…” ☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️ Want to learn more and get more examples ? get a copy of the book in Amazon !!\n\nA small section from one of my favourite chapters of my new book “The inevitable future of work. Will jobs exist at all?” Get your copy from Amazon. 👇👇👇👇 “Instantly, the home Al, a sleek device integrated seamlessly into his environment, sprang into action. It connected with the personalized Als of both Alex and Hayden, scanning their schedules and current locations. Within moments, it found the optimal location and time for the three of them to meet. \"Sam, you can meet Alex and Hayden in three hours at The Innovation Hub, a co-working space downtown,\" the Al announced. The space has been booked, and all necessary arrangements have been made.“\n\nIt is 100% clear to me I am not the best employee, neither the best leader, nor the best speaker. Nevertheless I have something special that many don't possibly have : I am a natural born stubborn. I wanted to become a humble author, no intent to sell a lot or become a best seller (I have a \"network\" of close to 10 thousand people and only 1% of that \"network\" had the detail to check out and get a copy of my first book \"Leading the Unknown-Strategies for leading REMOTE and GIG workers\"). My only aim is to share what I have learnt and what I think about leadership, work and the future, with others. That low interest for my first book, that has tons of futuristic practices on becoming a leader and leading teams one never met, did not discourage me to write my second book \"The inevitable future of work\". Those things indeed, show you \"who your real network\" is. (in my case around a 100 persons who really seem to care about what I have spent time and produced, and this is already great for a 53 years old person). To all that trust in me, support me not with a thumbs up but reading something I published. No matter the weather, I will keep riding ! To the next book !"
