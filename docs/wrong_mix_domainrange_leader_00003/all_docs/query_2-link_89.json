        "text": "This article analyses how the concept of cultural diplomacy has appeared in the theoretical debate on international relations and studies on diplomacy. As cultural diplomacy has long been present in the practice of diplomacy, it was examined primarily by its historians and practitioners. As a result, it was conceptualized and perceived mostly as an instrument with which states advance their interests and achieve political objectives. As far as theoretical perspective is considered, cultural diplomacy has appeared most of all in relation to the concept of «soft power». The goal of this paper is to present in a systematised way how this category has been present in the theoretical discourse. Furthermore, the article aims at determining whether the content of the concept has changed in response to processes and phenomena currently observed in international politics.\n\nConstructivism, postmodernism and feminism are a shift from the classical concepts of realism and liberalism and their neo versions. Constructivism emphasizes the importance of both the normative and materialists structures and the role of identity in shaping political actions and the mutually constitutive relationship between agents and structures. 1 It regards international relations as a social and historical construct. Constructivism has been prompted due to: 1. The quest to move beyond theoretical critique to the substantive analysis of International Relations; 2. The lack in capacity within both the neo-realist and neo-liberalist thoughts, to predict and adequately comprehend the systematic transformations which reshaped the global order, after the Cold War; 3. The potential for innovation in conceptual elaboration and empirically informed theoretical development and 4. The analytical failings of the dominant rationalist theories. 2 For constructivists, the normative structures are as important as the material ones, in the process of shaping behavior and social identity of political and social actors. The meaning of the material can only be possible within a structure of shared knowledge. The constructivists, also argue that understanding the non-material structures have impact on identities and that identities actually inform interests, leading to actions. By understanding how the actors develop their interests,\n\nArticle history: Abstract: Why has constructivism emerged as an important force in the fi eld of international relations and politics in the end of the 20th century? Why constructivism and not any other theoretical approach? The constructivist perspective of international relations appeared as a counterbalance to rationalism that was entrenched in US Political Science throughout the last decades. Analyzing the contemporary state of world affairs through the prism of social constructivism provides us with a unique understanding of how intersubjective perceptions lead to unique epistemic interpretations of reality, which form the ideological framework within which social constructs are being generated. Constructivism succeeds not only in identifying the motives behind the behavior of international actors, but also in unfolding the mechanism through which those motives are being envisaged and accepted through the process of social construction – here lies the greatest value of the constructivist approach in IR theory. Culture formation, nation building, imagined communities, security complexes – the constructivist approach remains an invaluable tool in the arsenal of political analysts, seeking to understand how culture, history, social order, religion, and language project their infl uence on the international arena and ultimately: why international players behave the way they do?\n\nInternational Relations’s (IR’s) intellectual history is almost always treated as a history of ideas in isolation from both those discursive and political economies which provide its disciplinary and wider (political) context. This paper contributes to this wider analysis by focusing on the impact of the field’s discursive economy. Specifically, using Foucaultian archaeologico-genealogical strategy of problematization to analyse the emergence and disciplinary trajectories of Constructivism in IR, this paper argues that Constructivism has been brought gradually closer to its mainstream Neo-utilitarian counterpart through a process of normalization, and investigates how it was possible for Constructivism to be purged of its early critical potential, both theoretical and practical. The first part of the paper shows how the intellectual configuration of Constructivism and its disciplinary fortunes are inseparable from far-from- unproblematic readings of the Philosophy of Social Science: the choices made at this level are neither as intellectually neutral nor as disciplinarily inconsequen- tial as they are presented. The second and third parts chart the genealogies of Constructivism, showing how its overall normalization occurred in two stages, each revolving around particular practices and events. The second part concentrates on older genealogies, analysing the politics of early classificatory practices regarding Constructivism, and showing how these permitted the distillation and immunization of Constructivism – and thus of the rest of the mainstream scholarship which it was depicted as compatible with – against more radical Postmodernist/Post-structuralist critiques. Finally, the third part focuses attention on recent genealogies, revealing new attempts to reconstruct and reformulate Constructivism: here, indirect neutralization practices such as the elaboration of ‘Pragmatist’ Constructivism, as well as the direct neutraliza- tion such as the formulation of ‘Realist’ Constructivism, are key events in Constructivism’s normalization. These apparently ‘critical’ alternatives that aim to ‘provide the identity variable’ in fact remain close to Neo-utilitarianism, but their successful representation as ‘critical’ help neutralize calls for greater openness in mainstream IR. Rather than a simple intellectual history, it is this complex process of (re)reading and (re)producing that counts as ‘Constructivism’, which explains both the normalization of Constructivism and the continued marginalization of Postmodernist/Post-structuralist approaches in mainstream IR’s infra-disciplinary balance of intellectual power.\n\nThis essay explores the position that constructivism has, compared to other International Relations theories. It argues that constructivism should be treated differently, in a sense that it is not a mere theory. Constructivism is different with other theories because it is not even a \"theory\" per se, rather, it is an ontology, method of thinking in the context of International Relations. Constructivism has reflective nature, it focuses on immaterial aspects of International Relations--- something that other mainstream International Relations often fail to notice. To strengthen such argument, this essay compares constructivism with other theories and critically criticize what other theories are lack of in which constructivism recognize."
