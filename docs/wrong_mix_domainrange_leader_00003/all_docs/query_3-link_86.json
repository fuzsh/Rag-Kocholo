        "text": "Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi says the destruction of an ancient mosque in the city of Mosul is \"an official declaration of defeat\" by so-called Islamic State (IS).\n\nIraqi forces say IS blew up the Great Mosque of al-Nuri and its famous leaning minaret as jihadists battled to stop advancing pro-government troops.\n\nIS said American aircraft had destroyed the complex, a claim denied by the US.\n\nAerial photographs show the complex largely destroyed.\n\nThe mosque, which was more than 800 years old, was where in July 2014 IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance in his first and only public appearance following the declaration days earlier of a \"caliphate\".\n\nThe mosque's destruction has brought widespread condemnation.\n\nLazare Eloundou Assomo, deputy director of the UN's cultural organisation Unesco, said the \"iconic\" mosque could have helped foster \"reconciliation and peace\" in Iraq in future.\n\nWhat happened to the Great Mosque?\n\nThe Iraqi commander in charge of the offensive to retake Mosul said troops were within 50m (160ft) of the mosque when IS \"committed another historical crime\".\n\nFootage released by the Iraqi forces shows the ancient landmark being demolished.\n\nPrevious reports said IS had rigged the mosque with explosives to stop the advance of Iraqi troops, but that local residents had until now prevented the militants from blowing it up.\n\nIS says the mosque was destroyed by a US air strike but has not provided any evidence to support this.\n\nIraqi forces are one street away from entering the mosque site, according to state TV, and more details may emerge if they do so.\n\nOne local resident, Ahmed Saied, told Reuters news agency that \"when I looked out of the window and saw the minaret was no longer there, I felt a part of me had died.\"\n\nBut 38-year-old Yasser Ali told the Agence France-Presse that while it was \"Mosul's symbol and icon, there are people who have been killed. They are much more precious than the minaret\".\n\nWhy was the mosque important?\n\nThe al-Nuri mosque dated back to 1172 and was Mosul's most famous Sunni mosque. It was named after the Muslim leader, Nur al-Din Mahmoud Zanki, famous for waging jihad against Christian crusaders.\n\nThe leaning minaret, covered with elaborate brickwork, was nicknamed \"the hunchback\".\n\nA month after IS forces overran Mosul in June 2014, Baghdadi gave a Friday sermon from the pulpit inside the mosque and spoke about the newly-proclaimed caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth, or caliph.\n\nThe militant group flew its black flag from the famous minaret and the building became the centre of IS activities.\n\nWhy would IS blow it up?\n\nIS fighters have shown scant regard for history or culture in the three years since their lightning advance across northern Iraq, says Paul Adams, BBC News world affairs correspondent.\n\nDestruction of the mosque, most observers assumed, would mark the group's final act of angry defiance before finally losing their grip on Mosul.\n\nDestroying the landmark would perhaps be better for IS than seeing it in the hands of its enemies - a scenario that would be a bigger symbolic blow for the group, adds BBC Monitoring journalist Mina al-Lami.\n\nMoreover, IS has openly said it will pursue scorched earth tactics in Mosul, she says. It has already targeted several mosques and tombs, including The Shrine of Yunus.\n\nMeanwhile, the group's official line that the mosque was destroyed in US air strikes has inspired defiance and threats of retaliation among its supporters online, according to BBC Monitoring.\n\nSympathisers said Iraqi forces believed that destroying the mosque would break IS militants' spirit but that instead it would make them more determined to fight on.\n\nIs the battle for Mosul over?\n\nThousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, supported by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, have been involved in the battle to retake the key city since 17 October last year.\n\nThe government announced the full \"liberation\" of eastern Mosul in January, but the west of the city has presented a more difficult challenge, with its narrow, winding streets.\n\nThe UN has warned that IS may be holding more than 100,000 people in the city as human shields.\n\nOn Sunday, commanders announced the start of the \"final chapter\" of the offensive, with Iraq's counter-terrorism service, army and federal police attacking the Old City from all directions.\n\nThe army said it believed there were no more than 300 militants left in the city, compared with almost 6,000 in October.\n\nOn Tuesday, an Iraqi military statement on state TV said IS had lost control and civilians previously trapped in the Old City were being released."
