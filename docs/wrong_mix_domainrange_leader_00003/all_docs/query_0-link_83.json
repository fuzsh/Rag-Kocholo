In 1933 he was named the emperor Bao Dai's minister of the interior, but found himself in conflict with the French colonial authorities and resigned the same year. In 1945 Communist leader Ho Chi Minh invited him to join his independent government in the North, but he rejected the proposal. After living abroad for several years, he returned in 1954 at Bao Dai's request to serve as prime minister of non-Communist South Vietnam. He effectively ousted Bao Dai as chief of state in April 1955 and was confirmed in a government-controlled referendum in October, becoming president of the newly declared Republic of Vietnam. He refused to act on the Geneva Accords providing for consultations with the Communist government to be followed by free elections throughout Vietnam in 1956 to establish a national government. With U.S. military and economic aid, he established an autocratic regime staffed at the highest levels by family members, in particular his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. Hundreds of thousands of refugees from North Vietnam were resettled in the south and economic progress made, but he failed to fulfill his promise of land reforms, and Communist influence grew as the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, launched an increasingly intense guerrilla war against his government. His use of heavy-handed military tactics against the insurgency only served to deepen his unpopularity. As a Roman Catholic he also was accused of oppressing the Buddhist majority.

He helped to form a paratroop corps in Brazzaville and had risen to the rank of captain when he led a mutiny in 1966 against the plans of Alphonse Massamba-Débat's government to incorporate the army into the national militia. Ngouabi was demoted, but the government's plan was scrapped. He was subsequently posted to the general staff headquarters. In July 1968 he was arrested, but he was immediately freed by his supporters in the military. Massamba-Débat was forced to name him as chief of staff. Ngouabi also was named president of a National Council of the Revolution. Massamba-Débat was forced from office on Sept. 4, 1968, and Capt. Alfred Raoul was named leader of the provisional government. Ngouabi remained leader of the Council and replaced Raoul as head of state on Jan. 1, 1969. He formed the Congolese Workers' Party in December 1969. His government survived a right-wing coup attempt in March 1970. Ngouabi was also challenged by an abortive coup attempt from the left in February 1972. He established the Congo as a people's republic and maintained close relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba.

Sept. 8, 1930, Son Tay province [now part of Hanoi], Tonkin [now in Vietnam] - d. July 23, 2011, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), prime minister (1965-67) and vice president (1967-71) of South Vietnam. He took aviation courses in France and the U.S. and served in the French colonial forces that opposed the Vietnamese liberation movement. After the nation was partitioned in 1954, he joined the South Vietnamese air force, attracting much attention because of his vehement anti-Communism as well as his bravado. He was highly favoured by U.S. advisers in Vietnam, but under Pres. Ngo Dinh Diem his flashy ways incurred disapproval and he was assigned to insignificant commands. After that government was overthrown in 1963, he rose quickly in responsibility and soon was named commander of the air force; he assumed the rank of air vice marshal. In January 1965, as one of four military leaders invited to join the government, he was named minister of youth and sports, but he balked at accepting the post. In June 1965, together with Maj.Gen. Nguyen Van Thieu and Gen. Duong Van Minh, he led a military coup that unseated the government of Prime Minister Phan Huy Quat. As prime minister, he provoked widespread opposition to his authoritarian policies, especially among Buddhists. In 1967 he announced he would run for the presidency, but then reached an agreement with the other top military leaders by which Thieu ran for president and he for vice president. The ticket won with about 35% of the vote. Unhappy with his new position, he became an outspoken critic of Thieu. In 1971 he attempted to oppose Thieu for the presidency but withdrew because of what he called Thieu's designs to rig the election. Upon the fall of South Vietnam in April 1975, he fled to the United States; he became a U.S. citizen in 2003. He returned to Vietnam for the first time in January 2004.\n\nNguyen Co Thach\n\nNguyen Co Thach (b. May 15, 1921, Vu Ban, Nam Dinh province, Tonkin [now in Vietnam] - d. April 10, 1998, Hanoi, Vietnam), foreign minister of Vietnam (1980-91). He joined the Viet Minh - Communist-led guerrillas - in 1937 to fight French colonial rule. His activities landed him in jail in the early 1940s. After release, he steadily rose through the Viet Minh ranks. He was a lieutenant colonel at the siege of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 that crushed French forces and effectively ended French rule in Indochina. A career diplomat, he gained prominence as a member of Vietnam's negotiating team during the Paris peace talks, which led to a U.S. agreement to pull troops out of South Vietnam in 1973. He was an aide to Le Duc Tho, the chief negotiator at the protracted talks. The war ended with a North Vietnamese victory in 1975. But he failed in his mission of establishing diplomatic relations with the United States. As early as 1978, three years after the end of the Vietnam War, he met with U.S. officials in New York to discuss normalization of ties, hoping to reduce dependence on the Soviet Union. U.S. mortification over its defeat and Hanoi's demands for war reparations got in the way of early postwar talks about establishing ties. He was foreign minister at a time when Vietnam was trying to break free from international isolation that followed the country's occupation of Cambodia. He traveled to New York in 1990 to meet Secretary of State James Baker, the highest-level bilateral contact since 1973. But the United States still withheld diplomatic relations. His star began to fade after he failed to warn fellow leaders of the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and to prepare Vietnam for an abrupt cut in Soviet aid. He was pushed from office at a Communist Party congress in 1991.\n\nNguyen Con (b. May 15, 1916, Thanh Lam commune, Thanh Chuong district, Nghe An province, Annam [now in Vietnam] - d.

July 10, 1910, Cho Lon, Cochinchina [now part of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam] - d. Dec. 24, 1996, Ho Chi Minh City), Vietnamese politician. He became politically active in 1949 and took a leading part in protests against the French and against the patrolling of the southern Vietnamese coast by U.S. warships. Imprisoned in 1950-52, he won popular acclaim for his prolonged hunger strike in protest of the war. After Vietnam was divided into a Communist north and a pro-U.S. south in 1954, he cooperated with the southern regime of Ngo Dinh Diem until he was arrested for advocating nationwide elections on reunification. Except for a short interval in 1958, he remained in prison from 1954 until some of his followers helped him escape in 1961. These had formed the National Liberation Front (NLF) in 1960, and made him provisional and in 1962 full-time chairman. His guerrilla forces began to register massive gains against the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government. In June 1969 the NLF established a Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) with Huynh Tan Phat as president and Nguyen as chairman of its consultative council. The PRG became the government of South Vietnam in April 1975, when the Saigon government's troops surrendered to the North Vietnamese and PRG forces. Following reunification, he was made one of the country's two vice presidents in 1976, a post he held until 1980, when he became acting president. In 1981 he was made vice president of the Council of State (a position he held until 1992), as well as chairman of the National Assembly (until 1987). He was also the first mayor of Ho Chi Minh City after reunification. In 1988-94 he was chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, which oversees all mass organizations in the country.\n\nNguyen Khanh\n\nNguyen Khanh (b. Nov. 8, 1927, Tra Vinh, Cochinchina [now in Vietnam] - d. Jan. 11, 2013, San Jose, Calif.), president and prime minister of South Vietnam (1964). He served in the French colonial army and took advanced military training both in France and in the United States. In independent South Vietnam he at first served loyally under Pres. Ngo Dinh Diem and became chief of staff to Gen. Duong Van Minh in 1955. He became a general in 1960. His units had great success against Viet Cong guerrillas in the Mekong delta, although he was occasionally criticized for sudden, driving military operations that were not cleared in advance with area commanders. He helped foil a coup against Ngo in 1960, but when Ngo sent the army to quell dissident religious sects, Nguyen joined Duong and other high military officials in assassinating Ngo on Nov. 1, 1963, and then led a counter-coup against Duong in January 1964. In a very unstable period marked by several coup attempts, he held the presidency until February and again briefly in August and was prime minister in February-August and September-November. Thereafter he remained commander of the armed forces. In January 1965 he was involved in another coup, overthrowing Prime Minister Tran Van Huong, and then wielded actual power, without taking a political post. In February, however, he lost the backing of other military leaders and was replaced as armed forces commander and sent abroad as roving ambassador. In August he was recalled, but he remained in exile, settling in Paris in 1968, then moving to the United States in 1977. In 2005 he was elected as president of an exile \"Government of Free Vietnam.\"\n\nNguyen Khanh, original name Nguyen Ngoc Khanh (b.

Van Linh\n\nNguyen Van Linh, original name Nguyen Van Cuc (b. July 1, 1915, Giai Pham commune, My Van district, Hung Yen province, Tonkin [now in Vietnam] - d. April 27, 1998, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), Vietnamese politician. He joined the fight against French colonial rule in 1929 and was sentenced to life imprisonment for subversion in 1930. He was freed in an amnesty in 1936, joined the Indochinese Communist Party and resumed his anti-French efforts, but was incarcerated again in 1941-45, again being held on the notorious prison island of Poulo Condore (Con Son). After Vietnam's proclamation of independence in 1945 Linh moved up through the ranks of the Communist party and after the division of the country following the French withdrawal (1954), he became an underground leader in South Vietnam. By 1960 he was selected to serve on the party central committee as secretary of the region that covered South Vietnam. He was known by so many aliases that it was not until the mid-1970s that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency realized that four important cadres were one and the same. With the defeat of the U.S.-backed regime in the south, he became party chief in Saigon. At the 4th National Party Congress in December 1976, he joined the Politburo; in 1982 he was inexplicably dropped, but he made a triumphant comeback in 1985 and consolidated his position in the months before and after General Secretary Le Duan's death in July 1986. On Dec. 18, 1986, he was installed as general secretary by the sixth congress of the Communist Party. He immediately took pragmatic measures to reform Vietnam's fossilized economy. His relationship with top party peers was sometimes uneasy as his views clashed with those that wanted accelerated reform. By the end of his five-year tenure as party chief he had fallen from favour and he was replaced at a party congress in 1991.\n\nNguyen Van Loc (b. Aug. 24, 1922, Bien Hoa province, Cochinchina [now in Vietnam] - d. May 31, 1992, Paris, France), prime minister of South Vietnam (1967-68).\n\nN. Van Thieu\n\nNguyen Van Thieu (b. November 19241, Tri Thuy, Ninh Thuan province, Annam [now in Vietnam] - d. Sept. 29, 2001, Boston, Mass.), president of South Vietnam (1967-75). He joined the Viet Minh in 1945 but left it in 1946 because of its Communist orientation and later fought for the French colonial regime against the Viet Minh. In 1954-58 he was head of the Vietnamese National Military Academy. By 1960 he had risen in rank to colonel. He played an important part in the coup against Pres. Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963. In 1965 he became chief of state in a military government headed by Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky. In 1967 he was elected president under a new constitution, and he was reelected without opposition in 1971. He ruled during the period of major U.S. intervention in the war against the Viet Cong insurgents and North Vietnam. But even with the assistance of 500,000 U.S. troops and massive amounts of military aid, he was never able to turn the tide against the Communists. He was a reluctant participant in the peace agreements of 1973 which provided for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Vietnam and led to increased military pressure from the Communist forces. In March 1975 he recalled troops from northern and central provinces of South Vietnam to defend the capital, Saigon, but the retreat turned into a rout. The capital was soon surrounded. After resisting for several days, he resigned on April 21 in favour of his vice president, Tran Van Huong, in a last-ditch attempt to reach a negotiated settlement of the war; he denounced the U.S. for breaking a promise to help Saigon if the Communists violated the 1973 accords. A few days later he left the country, going first to Taiwan, a few months later to England, and in 1989 to the U.S.\n\n1 In accordance with a frequently used Vietnamese custom, he took another date - April 5, 1923 - as his official birthday, on grounds that it was better luck.\n\nNguyen Van Thinh (b. 1888 - d. Nov. 10, 1946, Saigon, Cochinchina [now Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]), president of the Provisional Government of Cochinchina (1946). He entered politics in 1926 as a member of the Constitutionalist Party and in 1937 founded the Democrat Party. A French citizen, he became the first head of an allegedly autonomous Cochinchina created by the French in 1946. Because forming this government violated a previous agreement to hold a referendum on the future of Cochinchina, many Vietnamese considered him a traitor. Leaders of neighbouring independent Vietnam (formed of Annam and Tonkin) urged his countrymen to throw off Western control and issued threats against him. He was shocked when his French friends seemed to turn their backs on him, having dealt directly with Vietnam without Cochinchina representation, causing his government to lose face. \"I am being compelled to play a farce,\" he said. Shortly afterward he committed suicide; his private secretary found him hanging from a rafter with a copper wire around his neck.\n\nNguyen Van To (b.

During the 1999 election campaign Niinistö appeared statesmanlike, standing above the jibes traded by Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen and Centre Party leader Esko Aho.

His wife, Aleksandra (Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt), whom he had married on Nov. 26, 1894, possessed the firmness of character he lacked. Her mystical outlook made her turn to spiritualists and faith healers, notably Grigory Rasputin, who acquired great power over the imperial couple. Nikolay attempted to strengthen Russian influence in Korea, refusing to believe that Japan would go to war in order to preserve its sphere of influence. The defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05) not only frustrated his grandiose dreams of making Russia the dominant Eurasian power, but also contributed to discontent at home, which grew into the revolutionary movement of 1905. Reluctantly, he agreed to create a national representative assembly, or Duma, and by the manifesto of Oct. 30, 1905, promised a constitutional regime. But he dissolved the first two Dumas as \"insubordinate\" and then imposed a new electoral law which resulted in a compliant Third Duma. The outbreak of World War I (1914) strengthened the monarchy only temporarily. In 1915 he assumed supreme command himself and left domestic affairs in effect to the empress and Rasputin. After riots broke out in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) in March 1917, his government collapsed and he renounced his throne. He was imprisoned and, during the civil war, he and his wife and children were executed by the Bolsheviks to prevent a rescue by \"White\" forces.

As director of the State Department's policy planning staff in 1950 he helped frame the strategy of building up U.S. forces to keep the Soviets contained in Eastern Europe. As secretary of the Navy and later deputy secretary of defense in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, he organized the defense of the Pentagon against Vietnam War protesters and participated in bombing strategy in Vietnam. Along with a few other prominent conservative Democrats, organized as the Committee on the Present Danger, he opposed Pres. Jimmy Carter's 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, contending that it could not be verified and would enable the Soviets to strengthen their nuclear arsenal. The hardline Democrats swung to support Ronald Reagan. For President Reagan, Nitze took charge of negotiating reductions in intermediate range missiles with the Soviet Union in 1981. The negotiations were marked by a July 1982 \"walk in the woods\" near Geneva, Switzerland, with the Soviet negotiator, Yuly Kvitsinsky, that produced a compromise breakthrough, but it touched off a fierce protest by conservatives leading to its rejection by Reagan, even as Moscow also rejected it. At the Reykjavík, Iceland, summit of 1986, Nitze was paired with Marshal Sergey Akhromeyev, chief of staff of the Soviet armed forces, in an all-night bargaining session which paved the way for the first substantial arms reduction agreements of the Cold War. His long career, which included government service under eight presidents, was capped in April 2004 in Bath, Maine, as he witnessed the christening of a warship bearing his name.\n\nNiukkanen, Juho, byname of Juhana Niukkanen (b.

April 22, 1994, New York City), president of the United States (1969-74). The conservative Republican was twice elected to the U.S. House of Representatives (1946, 1948), and in 1950 he was elected to the Senate. His reputation as an anti-Communist made him a desirable running mate for Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 campaign. Nixon served two terms as vice president under Eisenhower. In 1960 he became the Republican presidential candidate but narrowly lost to Democrat John F. Kennedy. Two years later he lost a bid to unseat Democrat Edmund G. Brown as governor of California. With the Vietnam War raging, he made capital of his foreign affairs expertise and was proclaimed the 1968 Republican presidential candidate; he narrowly defeated Democratic challenger Hubert H. Humphrey. In 1970 he extended U.S. aggression in Indochina with an invasion of Cambodia, a country that was practically destroyed in the following years. His most significant diplomatic action may have been the reopening of direct communications with the People's Republic of China. In February 1972 he paid a state visit to China. This rapprochement in East Asia gave him a stronger position during his visit to Moscow in May - the first by a U.S. president. Renominated in 1972, he defeated his Democratic opponent, Sen. George S. McGovern, in one of the largest landslide victories in U.S. presidential history. His second term began with the effective ending of U.S. participation in the Vietnam War in January 1973. In the Watergate scandal, his administration was criminally involved in an incident of burglary and wiretapping at the Democratic Party's national headquarters in the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. Faced with almost certain impeachment and removal from office, he became the first U.S. president to resign (Aug. 9, 1974). He was granted a blanket pardon by his successor, Gerald Ford.\n\nNiyazbekov, Sabir (Bilyalovich) (b. Dec. 15 [Dec. 2, O.S.], 1912, Utkolbay, Russia [now in Akmola oblast, Kazakhstan] - d. Aug. 26, 1989, Alma-Ata, Kazakh S.S.R. [now Almaty, Kazakhstan]), chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh S.S.R. (1965-78).

Niyazov\n\nNiyazov, Saparmurat (Atayevich) (Turkmen Saparmyrat Nyýazow), byname Turkmenbashi (Türkmenbasy) (b. Feb. 19, 1940, Kipchak village, near Ashkhabad, Turkmen S.S.R. - d. Dec. 21, 2006), president of Turkmenistan (1990-2006). He was head of the Ashkhabad city Communist Party committee (1980-84) and chairman of the Council of Ministers (1985) and first secretary of the Communist Party (1985-91) of the Turkmen S.S.R. Little of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost or perestroika appeared to have rubbed off on the apparatchik who became chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet in January 1990 and was unopposed in presidential elections in October, winning 98.3% of the vote. After independence, he was reelected in 1992 with 99.5% of the vote. In 1993 he adopted the name Turkmenbashi (\"leader of the Turkmens\"). A referendum in 1994 extended his term in office to 2002, this time with 99.9% of the vote, and in 1999 he was declared president for life. A growing personality cult made sure Turkmens did not forget who their leader was. The exhortation \"May my tongue shrivel up and my bones turn to ashes if I betray my country or my president\" was broadcast throughout the day on state television. His chubby face graced everything from yoghurt pots to bottles of perfume. The Neutrality Arch (completed in late 1998), a 75-m syringe-like structure on three legs under which traffic passes, towered over the capital. Above it stood a 12-m revolving statue of Niyazov, arms outstretched as if to embrace his subjects from the lofty perch. He rotated once every 24 hours, tracking the path of the sun from dawn to dusk. Behind him was a huge gold flag blowing in the wind. Its cape-like appearance won the multimillion-dollar construction the nickname \"Batman's Tower.\" Niyazov established a national ideology based on his book Rukhnama, published in 2001.\n\nNiyetullayev, Sagyndyk (Davletiyarovich) (b. 1948), chairman of the Council of Ministers (1988-89) and first secretary of the Communist Party committee (1989-91) of the Karakalpak A.S.S.R.\n\nNiyonzima, Herménégilde (b.

June 19, 1917, Semokwe Reserve, Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe] - d. July 1, 1999, Harare, Zimbabwe), Zimbabwean politician. In 1957 he was elected president of the African National Congress (ANC), the leading black nationalist organization in Rhodesia. In 1959 the ANC was banned and he went to England. In 1960 he returned and became president of the National Democratic Party (NDP); in 1961, when the NDP was banned in turn, he founded the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), which was banned in 1962. He was held in detention from 1964 to 1974. Thereafter he attempted to negotiate black freedoms with Prime Minister Ian Smith but then left Rhodesia to seek international support for his cause. He helped lead the guerrilla war against white rule in Rhodesia, but he was essentially a diplomat and preferred negotiation to fighting. His forces played a relatively minor role compared with those of Robert Mugabe, who headed the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). After the end of white rule and the establishment of black-ruled Zimbabwe (1980), Nkomo's ZAPU, whose base of support was the minority Ndebele people, was increasingly eclipsed by Mugabe's ZANU, based on the Shona majority. ZANU resoundingly defeated ZAPU in the first parliamentary elections, but Nkomo was named home affairs minister in a coalition government. Strain quickly arose between ZANU and ZAPU, and overt ethnic strife broke out between the Shona and Ndebele after Mugabe dismissed Nkomo in 1982 for allegedly plotting a coup; Nkomo denied direct links with the rebels. Finally, in 1987, the two leaders agreed to merge their respective parties in order to try to achieve ethnic unity in the country. In 1990 Nkomo became a vice president, a post with limited power which he held until his death.\n\nNkoua, Pierre-Félicien (b.
