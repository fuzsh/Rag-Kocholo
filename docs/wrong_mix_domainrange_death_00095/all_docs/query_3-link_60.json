        "text": "Composer, bandleader, and pianist Thelonious Monk was one of the defining architects of modern jazz and bebop, acclaimed for his inventive improvisational style. â Monk got his first big break in the early 1940s as the pianist at Mintonâs Playhouse in Harlem, where he jammed with such other bebop pioneers as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. â Jazz sax legend Coleman Hawkins hired Monk for the pianistâs first studio recording, and one of bebopâs seminal sessions, in 1944. â In 1947, Monk first recorded his classic ââRound Midnight,â which has gone on to be the most-covered jazz standard of all time, by artists ranging from Miles Davis to Amy Winehouse. â His 1957 Carnegie Hall performance with John Coltrane went unreleased until 2005, at which point it spent 91 weeks on the Billboard Traditional Jazz Albums chart, peaking at No. 2. â TIME magazine featured him on its cover in 1964, following the release of his most commercially successful album, Monkâs Dream. â He won a Lifetime Achievement Award Grammy in 1993 and was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize Special Citation in 2006, for his âsignificant and enduring impact on the evolution of jazz.â â The BBC ranked Monk at No. 8 on their list of the greatest jazz artists of all time, just behind Billie Holiday."
