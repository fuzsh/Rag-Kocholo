        "text": "Fred Hersch\n\nA jazz piano pantheon member, Fred Hersch has been an influential creative force over more than three decades as an improviser, composer, educator, bandleader, collaborator, and recording artist. Vanity Fair has proclaimed him “the most arrestingly innovative pianist in jazz over the last decade” and “a living legend” by The New Yorker. A seventeen-time Grammy nominee, Hersch has garnered jazz’s most prestigious awards, including a Doris Duke Artist (2016), Jazz Pianist of the Year from the Jazz Journalists Association (2011, 2016, 2018), and the Jazz Magazine (France) International Artist of the Year (2021). The Fred Hersch Trio was voted the #1 Jazz Group in the 2019 DownBeat Critics Poll. An acclaimed and influential solo pianist, he has twelve solo recordings in his catalog, including the 2024 release Silent, Listening, which collaborates with legendary producer Manfred Eicher for the ECM label. All About Jazz has remarked that “when it comes to the art of solo piano in jazz, there are two classes of performers: Fred Hersch and everybody else,” The New York Times calls him “a master who plays it his way.” The Fred Hersch Trio has remained at the pinnacle of modern jazz through more than twelve albums, venerated as the epitome of thrilling interplay and dynamic spontaneity. The Wall Street Journal calls the trio “one of the major ensembles of our time,” while The New Yorker has applauded it for playing with “high lyricism and high danger.” They were named the #1 Jazz Group of the Year by DownBeat magazine. And appeared at major European and US jazz festivals and have regularly headlined at the legendary Village Vanguard since 1997. Hersch has more than sixty albums to his credit as leader or co-leader. His 2022 Breath By Breath features him playing his compositions inspired by his insight meditation practice with his trio and the Crosby Street String Quartet. A 2022 duo project with Italian trumpet maestro Enrico Rava, The Song Is You (ECM), was followed by the 2023 release of Alive at the Village Vanguard, a duo with dazzling jazz vocalist Esperanza Spalding that was named a 2023 Top Ten Jazz Album by DownBeat and was nominated for two 2024 Grammy Awards. His last album with his long-standing trio, 2018’s Live in Europe (Palmetto), documents one remarkable evening in Brussels and has been hailed as its best to date. An exceptionally responsive and intuitive collaborator, Hersch has engaged in duo partnerships with several spirited artists, including clarinetist Anat Cohen; guitarists Bill Frisell, Gilad Hekselman and Julian Lage; saxophonists Chris Potter, Joe Lovano, and Miguel Zenon; trumpeters Avishai Cohen and Enrico Rava; and vocalists Kurt Elling, esperanza spalding, Kate McGarry, Audra McDonald, Cécile McLorin Salvant, and Renée Fleming. His many sideman credits include Joe Henderson, Art Farmer, Stan Getz, Charlie Haden, and other jazz legends. Hersch’s memoir, Good Things Happen Slowly (Crown Archetype), compellingly reveals the story of his life in music along with a frank recounting of his health struggles and triumphs as the first openly gay, HIV-positive jazz musician. The book was named one of 2017’s Five Best Memoirs by the Washington Post and the New York Times and acclaimed as 2018’s Book on Jazz of the Year by the JJA. His story has also been told in a feature documentary by filmmakers Carrie Lozano and Charlotte Lagarde, The Ballad of Fred Hersch, which premiered to a sold-out house at the Full Frame Film Festival in 2016 and is now streaming. His acclaimed jazz/theater piece My Coma Dreams, created with librettist/director Herschel Garfein for actor/singer, eleven musicians and immersive video, premiered in 2011 and is also available online. While widely renowned for his playing, Hersch has earned similar distinction with his composing, garnering a Guggenheim Fellowship in composition, among other awards. His large-scale setting of Walt Whitman’s poetry for two voices and instrumental octet, Leaves of Grass, was selected to open the 2017 Jazz at Lincoln Center season at the Appel Room. He has received commissions from Roomful of Teeth, Igor Levit, the Lucerne Festival, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, the Doris Duke Millennium Fund, and the Gilmore Keyboard Festival. He has been awarded ten composition residencies at MacDowell and one at Bellagio. For two decades, Hersch has been a passionate spokesman and fundraiser for AIDS services and education agencies. He has produced and performed on four benefit recordings and in numerous concerts for charities; to date, his efforts have raised more than $300,000. He has also been a keynote speaker and performer at international medical conferences in the U.S. and Europe. In 2020, he raised $50,000 for the Jazz Foundation of America with a live duo EP with vocalist Esperanza Spalding and Eight x 88, a streaming event featuring eight of New York’s greatest jazz pianists in solo and duo formats. A committed educator, Hersch has taught at the New England Conservatory, the Juilliard School, the New School, Rutgers University, and the Manhattan School of Music and has given master classes worldwide. Hersch’s influence has been widely felt by a new generation of jazz pianists, from former students Brad Mehldau, Sullivan Fortner, Dan Tepfer, and Ethan Iverson to his piano colleague Jason Moran, who has said, “Fred at the piano is like LeBron James on the basketball court. He’s perfection.” If the total amount of beverages purchased by the party does not meet the minimum, a $15 drink/food minimum is charged per person in the party, per set.

Founded in January 1980 by drummer John Von Ohlen and trumpeter Don Johnson, the Blue Wisp Big Band got its start in and its name from the late Blue Wisp Jazz Club. Von Ohlen, a native of Indianapolis, moved to the Cincinnati area after many years on the road playing with world-class jazz orchestras, most notably those of Stan Kenton and Woody Herman. After hearing all of the fine musicians in the area, he felt there was a need to form a group because most of them “weren’t playing any jazz, which is the reason they started playing in the first place.” He felt the desire to start a “world-class big band and wanted to put it in a tavern, a beer joint.” Don Johnson, who had been on the Cincinnati scene for years, suggested which instrumentalists should play in the band. Von Ohlen states, “Don was the horn connection.” Pianist Steve Schmidt and bassist Michael Sharfe were already playing with Von Ohlen at the Blue Wisp in the Steve Schmidt Trio, Wednesday through Saturday nights, so the rhythm section was easily formed. Von Ohlen remembers approaching Paul and Marjean Wisby, the original owners of the Blue Wisp, with the idea, “Wednesday is a slow night. Why don’t we bring in a big band and blow the roof off the place? It worked real good.”Since its inception, the Blue Wisp Big Band has been the top jazz orchestra in Cincinnati. The hard bop-oriented big band started recording in 1981: first, an LP sponsored by the Cincinnati television station WKRC, and then four for the Mopro label, founded by Fred and Helen Morr, in the 1980s. The Mopro LPs were reissued in the mid -’90s on two CDs on the California label Sea Breeze, with one of the sets recorded in Los Angeles during a West Coast tour in 1984. Through the devoted and hard work of Helen Morr, the LPs were distributed around the country and Europe, garnering notice, good reviews, and airplay around the world. Among the group’s more notable members were trumpeter Tim Hagans and bassist Lynn Seaton. The band continued to perform at the Blue Wisp Jazz Club in Cincinnati on Wednesday nights until its closure in the summer of 2014. After a six-month tenure at Japp’s Annex in downtown Cincinnati, a short stint at Pirate’s Den in Westwood, and three years at the Urban Artifact in Northside, the band has a new home at Caffè Vivace in Walnut Hills. A $15 drink/food minimum is charged per person in the party, per set, if the total for beverages purchased by the party does not meet the minimum.

With many highly acclaimed solo albums, countless awards and accolades, and over two decades of international touring experience, Jane has not only been an extremely successful bandleader but has had the privilege of making music with some of the greatest musicians, arrangers, and producers in jazz. During her childhood, Jane studied woodwinds and piano, spent a decade performing in award-winning choirs, and participated in community theater on Long Island. Throughout this, her focus remained on jazz, especially her interpretation of the Songbook. At 20, during her senior year at the prestigious Manhattan School Of Music, Jane placed second in the Thelonious Monk Competition, now known as the Hancock Competition. This led to an incredible career trajectory, catapulting Jane into the jazz stratosphere nearly overnight. By 22, Jane worked with legends such as Tommy Flanagan, Ron Carter, and Kenny Barron, recording her first albums and touring the planet. This led to collaborations with jazz luminaries such as Terence Blanchard, Ivan Lins, Tom Harrell, John Pizzarelli, Christian McBride, Vince Mendoza, Jorge Calandrelli, and many more. Countless television appearances followed, including David Letterman, Conan O’Brien, CBS Sunday Morning, Good Morning America, The Tonight Show, The View, and many popular international talk shows. Several successful film soundtracks have also included Jane’s music, including Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow and Never Let Me Go. After more than twenty years, twelve studio albums, and countless recorded guest appearances, Jane has continued to tour the world nearly nonstop, including playing iconic venues such as Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl and headlining at nearly every legendary jazz club on the planet, most notably NY stalwarts such as the Village Vanguard and Birdland. In addition to touring, she also writes English lyrics for Ivan Lins. She uses the knowledge and experience she has gained at the Manhattan School Of Music and on the legendary bandstands of the world to educate and uplift students worldwide. Jane resides in Los Angeles with her husband, Rick Montalbano, and their son, who has been a drummer for over twenty years.

Founded in January 1980 by drummer John Von Ohlen and trumpeter Don Johnson, the Blue Wisp Big Band got its start in and its name from the late Blue Wisp Jazz Club. Von Ohlen, a native of Indianapolis, moved to the Cincinnati area after many years on the road playing with world-class jazz orchestras, most notably those of Stan Kenton and Woody Herman. After hearing all of the fine musicians in the area, he felt there was a need to form a group because most of them “weren’t playing any jazz, which is the reason they started playing in the first place.” He felt the desire to start a “world-class big band and wanted to put it in a tavern, a beer joint.” Don Johnson, who had been on the Cincinnati scene for years, suggested which instrumentalists should play in the band. Von Ohlen states, “Don was the horn connection.” Pianist Steve Schmidt and bassist Michael Sharfe were already playing with Von Ohlen at the Blue Wisp in the Steve Schmidt Trio, Wednesday through Saturday nights, so the rhythm section was easily formed. Von Ohlen remembers approaching Paul and Marjean Wisby, the original owners of the Blue Wisp, with the idea, “Wednesday is a slow night. Why don’t we bring in a big band and blow the roof off the place? It worked real good.”Since its inception, the Blue Wisp Big Band has been the top jazz orchestra in Cincinnati. The hard bop-oriented big band started recording in 1981: first, an LP sponsored by the Cincinnati television station WKRC, and then four for the Mopro label, founded by Fred and Helen Morr, in the 1980s. The Mopro LPs were reissued in the mid -’90s on two CDs on the California label Sea Breeze, with one of the sets recorded in Los Angeles during a West Coast tour in 1984. Through the devoted and hard work of Helen Morr, the LPs were distributed around the country and Europe, garnering notice, good reviews, and airplay around the world. Among the group’s more notable members were trumpeter Tim Hagans and bassist Lynn Seaton. The band continued to perform at the Blue Wisp Jazz Club in Cincinnati on Wednesday nights until its closure in the summer of 2014. After a six-month tenure at Japp’s Annex in downtown Cincinnati, a short stint at Pirate’s Den in Westwood, and three years at the Urban Artifact in Northside, the band has a new home at Caffè Vivace in Walnut Hills.

The recording won Bill his fifth Grammy nomination in the Best Instrumental Composition category. Also released in 2012 was his Concerto for Tuba and Orchestra, with tubist Jim Self and the Hollywood Ensemble, with Bill conducting (Metre Records, 2012). Bill’s album of solo improvisations on Christmas carols, “That Time of Year” (Metre Records, 2011), was described as a “tour de force” in the Los Angeles Times. Bill’s other recordings show his affinity for Latin rhythms (“Bill in Brazil,” Imaginación” and his Grammy-nominated trumpet concerto “Fourth Stream… La Banda”) and pay tribute to some of his musical heroes, including Bud Powell, Oliver Nelson, and Paul Simon. Bill wrote the score for the film “On the Shoulders of Giants,” Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s homage to the Harlem Rens basketball team of the 1920s and ’30s. The movie recently received an NAACP Image Award for Best Documentary. Bill’s soundtrack was nominated for Best Album. He recently completed scoring a film noir by Singaporean director Ying J. Tan and is producing a jazz album for singer Freda Payne. Bill’s books “Jazz Keyboard Toolbox” and “Jazz Inventions for Keyboard” (Alfred Music Publishing) have become standard reference works.

Critics laud her “light, expressive touch and solidly crafted, mainstream approach” - Mike Jurkovic (All About Jazz), while audiences delight in her playing and her vibrant personality. Yamanaka has gained international recognition from her albums as a leader; her most recent and most celebrated release, “Shades Of Rainbow” (Cellar Music), features Jazz masters Mark Turner and her NYC rhythm section, Tyrone Allen and Jimmy Macbride. Additionally, Miki has emerged as the “New York Scene” leader via her notable residencies at mainstay West Village sister clubs Smalls and Mezzrow. During the pandemic, she developed a successful in-home live-streaming weekly concert series cleverly titled “Miki’s Mood,” where she features a veritable who’s who of NYC talent (including her husband and frequent collaborator - drummer Jimmy Macbride). The series showcases her vast knowledge of Jazz standards and tunes, often featuring themed offerings of various composers from both the Great American Songbook and iconic Jazz composers. As a sideman, Yamanaka has worked with Jazz luminaries such as alto saxophonist Antonio Hart, who posits, “Miki will be recognized as one of the most exceptional artists of her generation, as she is already one of the most talented and dedicated musicians from Japan.” Other notable bands she currently works in include the Harish Raghavan Quintet and The Mingus Bigband. One of her most respected mentors on piano and organ (Yamanaka also performs on organ frequently), Larry Goldings, once mused, “If only I could have Miki Yamanaka comp behind me!” - a compliment of the highest order from one master pianist to another. She has a myriad of glowing reviews from her recorded work and the iconic Downbeat Jazz magazine has repeatedly awarded her albums high marks. On top of her exciting work as a bandleader in New York and abroad, Miki can often be found out, and about most nights, where her infectious smile and gregarious nature engender fast friends in every audience she encounters. She has many hobbies, including cooking, knitting, and perhaps most visibly, her penchant for wearing her vast collection of kimonos on her gigs, proudly representing her heritage and culture night after night as she dazzles audiences worldwide.

Ric has appeared on records with Jim James (My Morning Jacket), Bootsy Collins, John Mayer, Jacob Collier, David Wilcox, Ben Harper, Richard Thompson, Tony Levin, Bill Kreutzmann (Grateful Dead), Victor Wooten, Phil Keaggy, Victoria Williams. Robbie Fulks and many others. As a live performer, he’s shared the stage with a dizzying array of musicians: Johnny Cash, Moby, Bob Dylan, My Morning Jacket, Indigo Girls, Iron and Wine, Wu-Tang Clan, and many others. He's produced award-winning records for many folks, including Over The Rhine, Wilcox, and Phil Keaggy. On his own, hiding behind the Monk moniker, he released six independent records that featured alternately the songwriting craft he honed during his eight years in OTR, the ambient guitar that garnered demand as a studio musician, and the ear for songcraft that makes him an excellent producer. He seems to be one of the few musicians able to straddle comfortably the distance between ground-breaking avant-garde explorations (witness his association with people like David Torn) and truly beautiful pop music. Paste Music has called him \" the rarest kind of virtuoso, the kind who knows when not to play.\" This penchant for understatement has its rewards: Ric received a Grammy nomination in 2003.

Contemporary and classic jazz, hip-hop, R&B, Chicago house, and neo-soul—to Hill are all essential elements of his profound African-American creative heritage. “It all comes from the same tree,” he says. “They simply blossomed from different branches.” That mission to unite styles, complemented by Hill’s absolute instrument mastery, is a line connecting his many achievements. It can be heard on his latest album, Modern Flows Vol. II, with its seamless blend of jazz interplay, hip-hop-infused rhythms, and socially conscious spoken word. It’s integral to The Way We Play, his Concord Jazz debut in 2016, where Hill and his musicians reinvent jazz standards using their generation’s wide-ranging influences. It marks the four records Hill self-released before November 2014, when he won the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz competition and became a presence on the global scene virtually overnight. And it defines the revelatory live dates by Hill’s longtime working group, the Blacktet, which the Chicago Tribune called “a remarkably polished, immensely attractive ensemble.” For Hill, playing and listening without limits has long been an instinct. “It comes naturally; that’s how I hear the music,” he says. “I came up in a household where my mom played Motown, R&B, Isley Brothers, Barry White, Marvin Gaye. Then I received my first jazz record, by Lee Morgan, which was added to the collection. ... I truly believe the music is all the same.” Born in Chicago in 1987 and raised on the city’s culturally rich South Side, Hill began playing drums at age 4 before switching to trumpet in the 6th grade. He attended high school at Kenwood Academy, excelling in its revered jazz-performance program. He was mentored by Bobby Broom, Willie Pickens, Tito Carrillo, and other Chicago greats through the Ravinia Jazz Scholars program. Hill earned his bachelor’s in music education from Northern Illinois University and his master’s in jazz pedagogy from DePaul University. During college, he made gigs and sessions around Chicago, jamming with and absorbing wisdom from Fred Anderson, Ernest Dawkins, and Von Freeman. Even then, Hill was known as a stunningly gifted trumpeter with a soulful, highly textured tone. His sound is now somehow both deeply distinctive and a tour through jazz-trumpet history, evoking the high-drama stillness and space of Miles, the undeniable virtuosity of Clifford Brown and Freddie Hubbard, the groove-savvy phrasing of Lee Morgan and Donald Byrd, and much more. Well before Hill won the Monk prize—arguably the most important jazz competition in the world—his reputation for brilliance was firmly established in the Midwest as a member of the Chicago Jazz Orchestra, an in-demand sideman, and a bandleader. He also developed into a precocious, determined young label owner and has released five acclaimed discs—New Gospel, Sounds of the City, The Poet, and Modern Flows Vols. I and II—through his Black Unlimited Music Group imprint. “Just having my personality, there’s nothing like being in control of what you produce and put out into the world,” he says. “It’s a great feeling.” A move to New York in 2014 helped him gain wider exposure and new opportunities—though he frequently returns to his hometown for gigs and projects—and in recent years, Hill has garnered an enviable spate of press. Previewing a Blacktet show, the New Yorker said, “His performances and recordings reveal a smart post-bop player who circumvents genre clichés by incorporating elements of hip-hop and contemporary R. & B.” Of The Way We Play, DownBeatwrote, “The groove-laden arrangements provide the perfect soundscape for Hill’s fluid improvisational style, which, with its glass-like lucidity, recalls the crisp elegance of hard-bop stalwart Donald Byrd.” 2016 Hill earned first place in the “Rising Star–Trumpet” category in that magazine’s storied Critics Poll. Throughout his journey, he has supported and guested with a who’s who of jazz that includes Marcus Miller, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Boney James, Kurt Elling, Joe Lovano, and Hill’s trailblazing Chicago peer Makaya McCraven. Latest Project New Gospel Revisited is the new album from the fearless and formidable American composer and trumpeter Marquis Hill. This time, a live recording that revisits and reinterprets his debut 2012 New Gospel album employs a band of super-heavyweight musicians, including Walter Smith III, Joel Ross, James Francies, Kendrick Scott, and Harish Raghavan. Marquis Hill’s rise over the last few years has been striking, and there’s no letting up. Since winning the prestigious Thelonious Monk Institute Jazz Composition award, he has demonstrated full command of his art and built a reputation for synthesizing what he describes as the essential elements of the Africa-American creative heritage, including contemporary and classic jazz, hip-hop, R&B, house, and neo-soul. Now, his sights are set even higher. New Gospel Revisited is an extraordinary live recording that reimagines his debut as a leader with a new band, a new focus, and a sharpened ear as a bandleader, composer, and performer. The set is breathtakingly good, with a band that sounds as inventive and creative as it reads on paper. “… New Gospel was my debut album and my first completed production. To revisit this music freshly, with a new band has been uniquely invigorating —and hugely rewarding.” Marquis Hill A $15 drink/food minimum is charged per person in the party, per set, if the total for beverages purchased by the party does not meet the minimum.

Ben has released four albums on the Vizztone label and has two Blues Music Award nominations and five Blues Blast Awards nominations. Ben's latest album, \"Take Your Time,\" featured collaborations with Blues legends Lil' Ed, Bob Stroger, and Lil'Jimmy Reed. Based on the success of their single \"I've Been Drinking Muddy Water,\" Ben and Lil' Jimmy collaborated again in the studio, with Ben producing and co-writing songs with Jimmy. \"Back to Baton Rouge\" was released in May 2023 on NOLA Blue and reached number two on the Living Blues radio charts. \"Both musicians have perfectly matched and understood themselves to give us a repertoire that includes five covers and five original songs that are a heartfelt tribute to the most traditional old-time blues. A magnificent and mandatory to listen album, one of those small treasures which are barely recorded, to be deeply savored in these times of modernity and technology.\" -La Hora De Blues (Spain) Ben also released an EP on Vizztone, \"Waiting Just For You,\" in October 2023 with jazz vocalist Stella Heath. The two musicians collaborated on four duets with an all-star rhythm section, including Jim Anderson on upright bass and Art Gore on drums. \"With Stella’s background in jazz and a love for blues, and Ben’s background in blues with a love for jazz, the two met musically in the middle. “Waiting Just For You” showcases four duets in a style where blues and jazz intersect to create a beautiful, classic sound.\" -American Blues Scene Art Gore's drumming style is characterized by signature driving cymbal beats, crisp, sharp snare accents, and well-placed bass drum \"bombs.\" During his six-decade career, he has performed and recorded with such artists as George Benson, Dr. Lonnie Smith, Lonnie Liston Smith, Pharoah Sanders, Woody Shaw, Larry Young, Bobby Watson, Freddie Hubbard, John Scofield, Hank Marr, J.J. Johnson, Joey Defrancesco, Kenny Dorham, Hank Crawford, James Moody, and Ahmad Jamal, to name a few. Dr. Lonnie Smith has said of Art, \"Art has the kind of rhythm and drive that's always right there.\" Art Gore was born into a family of musicians, which began his early exposure to music. By age sixteen, he was playing professionally. After graduating high school, Art attended Berklee College of Music and was drafted into the armed forces for two years. His musical development continued by playing with the First Armored Division Band and orchestra and leading his groups. After serving in the military, Art attended the Berklee College of Music, where he studied with renowned drum instructor Alan Dawson and later at the New England Conservatory of Music under Vic Firth. In 1972, Art joined Dr. Lonnie Smith, leading to traveling and recording with the Grammy-winning guitarist and vocalist George Benson. Upon leaving George Benson's band, Art began working with Lonnie Liston Smith. Art's recordings with Lonnie were some of the most important of his early career. Many jazz enthusiasts consider one of the recordings, \"Expansions\" (RCA 1975), a jazz-fusion classic. \"Voodoo Woman,\" one of the compositions that Art recorded with Lonnie, is included in the Recommended Recordings of the Decade for the Smithsonian Collection of Jazz in the Seventies.

Founded in January 1980 by drummer John Von Ohlen and trumpeter Don Johnson, the Blue Wisp Big Band got its start in and its name from the late Blue Wisp Jazz Club. Von Ohlen, a native of Indianapolis, moved to the Cincinnati area after many years on the road playing with world-class jazz orchestras, most notably those of Stan Kenton and Woody Herman. After hearing all of the fine musicians in the area, he felt there was a need to form a group because most of them “weren’t playing any jazz, which is the reason they started playing in the first place.” He felt the desire to start a “world-class big band and wanted to put it in a tavern, a beer joint.” Don Johnson, who had been on the Cincinnati scene for years, suggested which instrumentalists should play in the band. Von Ohlen states, “Don was the horn connection.” Pianist Steve Schmidt and bassist Michael Sharfe were already playing with Von Ohlen at the Blue Wisp in the Steve Schmidt Trio, Wednesday through Saturday nights, so the rhythm section was easily formed. Von Ohlen remembers approaching Paul and Marjean Wisby, the original owners of the Blue Wisp, with the idea, “Wednesday is a slow night. Why don’t we bring in a big band and blow the roof off the place? It worked real good.”Since its inception, the Blue Wisp Big Band has been the top jazz orchestra in Cincinnati. The hard bop-oriented big band started recording in 1981: first, an LP sponsored by the Cincinnati television station WKRC, and then four for the Mopro label, founded by Fred and Helen Morr, in the 1980s. The Mopro LPs were reissued in the mid -’90s on two CDs on the California label Sea Breeze, with one of the sets recorded in Los Angeles during a West Coast tour in 1984. Through the devoted and hard work of Helen Morr, the LPs were distributed around the country and Europe, garnering notice, good reviews, and airplay around the world. Among the group’s more notable members were trumpeter Tim Hagans and bassist Lynn Seaton. The band continued to perform at the Blue Wisp Jazz Club in Cincinnati on Wednesday nights until its closure in the summer of 2014. After a six-month tenure at Japp’s Annex in downtown Cincinnati, a short stint at Pirate’s Den in Westwood, and three years at the Urban Artifact in Northside, the band has a new home at Caffè Vivace in Walnut Hills.

One would not guess that this is a man hailed by greats; Ramsey Lewis describes his piano playing as a joy to behold’; Les McCann states, ‘As a man and musician he is already a giant.’ Journalist Nat Hentoff championed three of Alterman’s albums, as well as his writing (Joe wrote liner notes to three Wynton Marsalis/JALC albums), calling one of Joe’s columns “one of the very best pieces on the essence of jazz, the spirit of jazz, that I’ve ever read, and I’m not exaggerating.” Joe Alterman began at NYU with a BA and Master in Jazz Piano from NYU and has since performed at many world-renowned venues, including the Kennedy Center, Lincoln Center, Birdland, and Blue Note alongside Houston Person, Les McCann, Dick Gregory, Ramsey Lewis, and his trio, among others. Downbeat describes his sound as “rooted in the blues and with a touch reminiscent of the great pianists of the 1950s—Red Garland, Ahmad Jamal, Bill Evans.” It is clear Joe hits all of the necessary points for Jazz critics and fans alike. But there is more to the story, of course. The twenty-first century has thus far seen yet another transition for this thing called Jazz. In one moment, we see the push and pull between tradition and progression; in another, we see Pop and Hip-Hop musicians emulating and sampling. In Joe Alterman, we find none of this struggle; the music sounds good. Our conscious faculties are instantly disabled as we tap our feet, feeling the intent and joy of his playing. An old classic is new when you feel good at the moment. Joe Alterman’s new release, The Upside Of Down, captures this fresh and joyful intent. Taken from two live shows at Birdland in November 2019 and February 2020, the album reminds us of a not-too-distant time when we gathered and danced. Joined by Nathaniel Schroeder on bass and Marlon Patton on drums, Alterman cruises gently and delightedly through timeless selections from Les McCann, Oscar Peterson, Henry Mancini, and more, with some of his compositions in the mix.

Garnering international acclaim with 5 GRAMMY nominations, a sold-out house at New York’s heralded Birdland Jazz Club, and guest appearances with Germany’s renowned WDR Big Band, Chuck sought an opportunity to tour and connect with audiences more intimately. The Covid “break” resulted in a flurry of new works designed to feature the luminescent vocalist Kate McGarry, a 3-time GRAMMY nominee. Debuting in 2023 with a short Florida tour followed by an exhilarating extended tour of the upper mid-west, the band’s first album, “Magic Light” on Origin Records, dropped in April 2024. Like the Surge, ReSurgence's music is grounded in the jazz tradition but embraces influences from American folk, blues, roots, Latin, and many other genres. It’s proven accessible to audiences of all types, including many who have professed they “didn’t think I liked jazz – but I love this!” In addition to writing for the Jazz Surge & WDR, Chuck has composed/arranged for the Netherlands Metropole Orch., Aarhus Jazz Orch., Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orch., and Tonight Show Orch. And many more. He enjoys the title of Distinguished Professor Emeritus at The University of South Florida, serves as the founding President of the International Society of Jazz Arrangers & Composers, and has served as Pres. of IAJE, panelist for the NEA, NARAS, and Pulitzer Prizes, among others.

Multifaceted American jazz pianist and composer Emmet Cohen has emerged as one of his generation's pivotal figures in music and the related arts. A recognized prodigy, Cohen began Suzuki method piano instruction at age three, and his playing quickly became a mature melding of musicality, technique, and concept. Downbeat observed that his \"nimble touch, measured stride, and warm harmonic vocabulary indicate he's above convoluted technical showmanship.\" In the same spirit, Cohen has noted that playing jazz is \"about communicating the deepest levels of humanity and individuality; it's essentially about connections,\" both among musicians and with audiences. He leads his namesake ensemble, the \"Emmet Cohen Trio,\" and is a vibrant solo performer and is in constant demand as a sideman. Possessing a fluid technique, an innovative tonal palette, and an extensive repertoire, Cohen plays with the command of a seasoned veteran and the passion of an artist fully devoted to his medium. Emmet Cohen is committed to the intergenerational transfer of artistic knowledge, history, and traditions. His signature professional undertaking is the \"Masters Legacy Series,\" a celebratory set of recordings and interviews honoring legendary jazz musicians. He serves as both producer and pianist for each album in the series. This landmark, ongoing project aims to provide musicians of multiple generations a forum to transfer the unwritten folklore that is America's unique musical idiom. Cohen has observed that playing jazz \"is enriched immeasurably by connecting and studying with jazz masters, forging backward to the very creation of the art form.\" Volume one of the \"Masters Legacy Series\" features drummer Jimmy Cobb, and volume two spotlights bassist Ron Carter. Future \"Masters Legacy Series\" releases will include Cohen's recordings with Benny Golson, Tootie Heath, and George Coleman. Emmet Cohen's exacting keyboard artistry has garnered numerous accolades from the international jazz community. He placed first in the American Jazz Pianists Competition (2014) and the Phillips Piano Competition at the University of West Florida (2011). He was a finalist in the prestigious American Pianists Association's Cole Porter Fellowship (2015, 2011) and the Thelonious Monk International Piano Competition (2011). Cohen has appeared in world-renowned jazz events, including the Newport, Monterey, North Sea, Bern, Edinburgh, Detroit, and Jerusalem jazz festivals, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia. He has also performed at the Village Vanguard, the Blue Note, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Birdland, Jazz Standard, London's Ronnie Scott's, Jazzhaus Montmartre in Copenhagen, Lincoln Center's Rose Hall, the Cotton Club in Tokyo, and the Kennedy Center, and was received in the Oval Office by President Obama.

The area is significant historically as the site of the Zulu king Dingane kingdom between 1828 and 1840. It’s important to note that the Zulu, the African warrior code, deeply relies on music for motivation and healing. This deeply embedded symbiosis is key to understanding Makhathini’s vision. The church also played a role in Makhathini’s musical understanding, as he hopped from church to church in his younger days in search of only the music. The legends of South African jazz are also deeply influenced, particularly by Bheki Mseleku, Moses Molelekwa, and Abdullah Ibrahim. “The earlier musicians put a lot of emotions in the music they played,” he says. “I think it may also be linked to the political climate of those days. I also feel that the uniqueness of South African jazz has created interest worldwide, and we are slowly losing that interest in our music today. I feel that our generation must be very conscious about retaining these nuances in the music we play today.” Through his mentor, Mseleku, Makhathini was also introduced to the music of John Coltrane’s classic quartet with McCoy Tyner. “I understood my voice as a pianist through John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme,” he says. “As someone who started playing jazz very late, I had always been looking for a kind of playing that could mirror or evoke how my people danced, sang, and spoke. Tyner provided that and still does in meaningful ways.” Makhathini also cites American jazz pianists, including Andrew Hill, Randy Weston, and Don Pullen, as significant influences. Active as an educator and researcher, Makhathini is the head of the music department at Fort Hare University in the Eastern Cape. He has performed at renowned festivals, including the Cape Town International Jazz Festival and the Essence Festival (in both New Orleans and South Africa), and in 2019, he made his debut appearances at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City, as well as Jazz at Lincoln Center where he was a featured guest with Wynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra on their 3-night musical celebration The South African Songbook in Rose Theater. He is a member of Shabaka Hutchings’ band Shabaka and the Ancestors, appearing on their 2016 album Wisdom of Elders. He has collaborated with artists including Logan Richardson, Nasheet Waits, Tarus Mateen, Stefon Harris, Billy Harper, Azar Lawrence, and Ernest Dawkins. In addition to producing albums for his peers (such as Thandiswa Mazwai’s Belede and Tumi Mogorosi’s Project Elo), Makhathini has released eight albums of his own since 2014 when he founded the label Gundu Entertainment in partnership with his wife and vocalist Omagugu Makhathini. Those albums earned him multiple awards and include Sketches of Tomorrow (2014), Mother Tongue (2014), Listening to the Ground (2015), Matunda Ya Kwanza (2015); Icilongo: The African Peace Suite (2016), Inner Dimensions (2016), and Reflections (2016). His 2017 album Ikhambi was the first to be released on Universal Music South Africa and won Best Jazz Album at the South African Music Awards (SAMA) in 2018. His Blue Note debut Modes of Communication: Letters from the Underworlds was named one of the “Best Jazz Albums of 2020” by The New York Times and was followed by In the Spirit of Ntu in 2022 and uNomkhubulwane in 2024."
