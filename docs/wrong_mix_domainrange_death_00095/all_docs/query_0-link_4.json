        "text": "The Smithsonian Institution in the United States is the world’s largest museum, education, and research complex, including 19 museums and the U.S. National Zoo.\n\nEstablished by the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History in 1992, the Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program seized the opportunity to document more than one hundred senior jazz musicians, performers, relatives, and business associates. Each interview was conducted by a jazz authority and was recorded on digital audiotape by a professional audio engineer. The interviews average six hours in length and cover a wide range of topics including the musician’s early years, initial involvement in music, generally, and jazz specifically, as well as their experiences in the jazz music world, including their relationships with other musicians.\n\nInternational Jazz Day is pleased to partner with the Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program to allow people around the world to learn from these one-of-a-kind resources.\n\nThe oral history transcriptions and recordings of NEA Jazz Masters featured here are part of the Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program in partnership with the National Endowment of the Arts."
