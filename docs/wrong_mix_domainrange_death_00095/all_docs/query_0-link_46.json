Shortly thereafter, he released the American Recordings albums and re-established himself as one of the worlds greatest songwriters, introducing him to a new generation of fans. Songwriters unreleased 11 songs have been updated and produced by his son John Carter Cash and co-producer David Ferguson.\n\nQuick View\n\nNothing More\n\nCarnal [Colored Vinyl] (Tan)\n\nVinyl: $24.98 Buy\n\nThree-time Grammy nominees and San Antonio, Texas-born quartet, NOTHING MORE return with their highly awaited 8th album CARNAL, scheduled for release on June 28th. The album features 15 songs with introspective philosophical lyrics with unapologetically massive anthems. Since their emergence in 2003, Nothing More has earned rock radio chart history with #1 singles with both \"This is the Time (Ballast)\" and \"Go To War\" and already has seven Active Rock Radio Top-10 singles in their repertoire. \"CARNAL\" further proves their expertise in the rock genre and beyond.\n\nQuick View\n\nCamila Cabello\n\nC,XOXO [Sky Blue Lp]\n\nVinyl: $32.99 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nCamila Cabello has released brand new track HE KNOWS (featuring Lil Nas X) from her forthcoming album C, XOXO, which is out June 28th on Interscope Records and available for pre-order now.

Their distinctive brand of hyperliterate folk-rock set them apart from the start, releasing nine full-length albums that are unbound by genre and highly ambitious. Now the beloved indie band is back with their first new album in six years, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again - not only the longest Decemberists album to date (and their first intentional, proper double-LP) but also their most empathetic and accessible, its 13 songs like semaphores of mutual recognition for our fraught times and faint hope. The first dozen songs are punchy, pithy gems all, reflections on mortality and loneliness, longing and cynicism, expectation and unease. The band animates them brilliantly, pushing out and pulling in at the perfect moments. John Moen practically dances beneath the jangle of opener Burial Ground, breathing the life into this song about spiraling toward the end. From the irrepressible Oh No!\" and guileless tenderness and absolute surrender of All I Want Is You, to the romantic ghost story that shimmers behind pedal steel in spite of the specter in \"Long White Veil,\" these 12 songs alone would constitute a dazzling Decemberists album, rich with woe and love, anxiety and honesty. But a keening little choir and arid electric guitar invoke Joan in the Garden, the bands first full-on prog escapade since The Crane Wife. Though rooted in doubt, much like the album it ends, Joan in the Garden ultimately lands as a celebration of musics ability to convey valence and ambiguity, to frame an endlessly complicated story in instantly compelling terms.\n\nThis, songwriter Colin Meloy will tell you proudly, is the best Decemberists albums and perhaps the ultimate realization of 22 years of work. In many ways, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again feels like an aptly titled renewal for The Decemberists. The first full-length release on YABB Records, the bands own label, after a run of nearly two decades with Capitol. As they were once, here are the Decemberists again, now an independent band empowered by singing stories that sound instantly familiar and convey some bit of hard-won wisdom.\n\nQuick View\n\nSuperchunk\n\nFoolish [Down In The Valley Exclusive][Autographed / Blue Vinyl]\n\nVinyl: $24.99 Buy\n\nupdate: 04/30 We are are now sold out.

Red/Orange Splatter][Down In The Valley Exclusive]\n\nVinyl: $24.99 Buy\n\nDown In The Valley excluisve colorway, limited to only 300 copies.\n\nOakland's Samiam unleashed their sixth album, \"Astray,\" in 2000, and it's a heart-wrenching masterpiece. Samiam blends punk energy with alt-rock vibes and a melancholic undertone, all wrapped in a smartly produced soundscape. Astray doesn't shy away from darkness, confronting heavy themes like suicide with raw honesty and searing emotion. The music itself reflects the weight, rumbling bass-heavy guitars amplifying the somber mood. Amidst the intensity, gems like \"Mud Hill.\" \"Sunshine.\" & \"Dull\" (arguably their crown jewel) shines through, resonating with anyone who's ever felt the weight of sadness. Marking a band turning point, this was Samiam's last album with founding guitarist James Brogan and first with bassist Sean Kennerly. In 2023, Samiam would regroup and release \"Stowaway\" their ninth album and remain one of the most endearing and enduring punk bands of their generation.

Wrestling was low-budget working class entertainment back then, stricktly UHF material. It was cheap theater. You had to bring your imagination to the proceedings and you got paid back double.

After years of struggling with her own mental health that resulted in writers block, on-stage episodes, and tour cancellations, RKS singer/songwriter/frontperson Ela Melo was properly diagnosed and treated in 2023, vastly improving her quality of life. As if suddenly struck by creative intervention, songs once again poured out of her, writing at least one a day for an entire year and forming the backbone of their 22-track opus LOVE HATE MUSIC BOX. This epic mosaic of sound and emotion was fully realized once the band - guitarists Bozzy Keller and Ethan Goodpaster, drummer Jess Haney and former bassist Charlie Holt- reconvened in the studio, adding another dimension sonically. Produced by Daniel Tashian (Kacey Musgraves) along with Konrad Snyder (Noah Kahan) and Melo, the much-anticipated album ponders lifes ups and downs, and traces the turbulent trajectory of relationships, painted out loud in hues of pop, electronic, rock, and hip-hop. As such, it finds the musicians at their most vulnerable, vibrant, and vital. From Peter Pan through the finale Thanks For Coming, LOVE HATE MUSIC BOX unspools a cohesive vision all-around. Among the many highlights, they notably teamed up with GRAMMY® Award-winning multiplatinum supernova Kacey Musgraves on the impassioned Overtime.\n\nQuick View\n\nDua Lipa\n\nRadical Optimism [Indie Exclusive Cherry Red Eco LP]\n\nVinyl: $29.98 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nQuick View\n\nBeartooth\n\nThe Surface [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition Red/White/Blue Splatter LP]\n\nVinyl: $24.99 Buy\n\nWe have 60 autographed copies for sale.

Beartooth hit the top of both the Billboard Mainstream Rock & US Active Rock radio charts in May 2023, landing at #1 with their Papa Roach collab single Cut The Line. Thus begins a new era for the band, marked by their most successful UK & European spring headline tour (headlining at Wembley Arena), and 2-month US Co-Headline tour with Trivium, top billing at Sonic Temple Festival and Sunshine! fan track release in April (currently #1 on SiriusXM Octanes Big Uns Countdown). Beartooth now prepare to release their biggest and most commercial rock record to date, as follow-up to their 2021 chart topping album Below which debuted at #30 on the Billboard 200 and cleaned up on Luminates US Sales charts (#1 Alternative, Rock, and Hard Rock, #2 Vinyl, Independent and Current Album sales).\n\nArtist Quote on Album: The Surface Beartooths entire discography has been snapshots of my inner monologue and emotional state over the years with a recurring theme, depression and self loathing. Its been tough to understand why Ive felt the way I do for so long. During the pandemic I was faced with 2 distinct paths in life. One, I continue doing nothing to manage the realities of my mental health and continue down a path of self destruction, ultimately ending in my demise. Two, choose to do the work needed to maintain a healthier relationship with myself, no matter how difficult or painful.\n\nThis album is the story of my beginnings in the new world Ive created for myself. One focused on health, self love, positivity, understanding, hard work, and most of all second chances. At the end of the day, life is short for all of us. We cant escape the end, so why not make friends with it and live in a world focused on living a personally fulfilling life.  Caleb Shomo of Beartooth\n\nQuick View\n\nVial\n\nBurnout [Minnesota Exclusive Autographed][Ultra Clear & Orange Marble]\n\nVinyl: $23.99 Buy\n\nExclusive \"Minnesota\" Exclusive Autographed-Ultra Clear & Orange Marbled Vinyl.

Seeing the longstanding duo of Fenriz & Nocturno Culto uniting once more, 'It Beckons Us All' follows on the heels of 2022's revered 'Astral Fortress' album, with what could be considered an even more refined, challenging & diverse set of timeless metal anthems from the uncompromising trailblazers; from the melodic, to the sombre & atmospheric, to the blackened dirges emanating from Darkthrone's highly distinguishable riffing, as well as a nod to influences such as Celtic Frost along the way.

Following a six-year run of pristine emo-influenced rock n roll records comes Mercy, the bands fourth album and third for Epitaph. Its the bands most lyric-focused offering to date, a record about reinvention, trusting yourself, and wearing your heart on your sleeve even when its painful or vulnerable.\n\nSonically, Mercy is also a major departure for REMO DRIVE. Its less indebted to the emo and pop punk that foregrounded the duos career and instead invested in thorny, baroque indie pop byway of Father John Misty and Fleet Foxes. It was produced by Phil Ek, a legendary Seattle-based indie rock producer who has previously worked with those two bands as well as the Shins and Band of Horses, among others. REMO DRIVE worked with Ek over the course of ten days. It was refreshing to work with Phil, says Erik, It made music feel like how it did when we were younger. He was like fuck it, lets go, lets have fun.\n\nMercy is a study in intimacy, in being real with yourself, in entering an exciting new creative chapter where you are making the art you really want to make. Thats where REMO DRIVE is today.\n\nQuick View\n\nSt. Vincent\n\nAll Born Screaming [Indie Exclusive Red LP]\n\nVinyl: $27.98 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nSt. Vincents first self-produced record, All Born Screaming is Annie Clark at her most unfiltered.

It continues the mystery and sanctitythat is the key to how bassist Laura Lee Ochoa, drummer DonaldDJ Johnson, Jr. and guitarist Mark Marko Speer approach music.If 2020s Mordechai, the last studio LP Khruangbin made withoutcollaborators, was a party record that enhanced the bands musicalreputation far and wide, then A La Sala is the measured morningafter. Its a gorgeously airy record completed only in the companyof the groups longtime engineer Steve Christensen, with minimaloverdubs. Its a window onto the bounties powering Khruangbinsvision, a reimagining and refueling for the long haul ahead. A LaSala scales Khruangbin down to scale up, a creative strategy withthe future in mind.\n\nThe trios collective musical DNA, the years spent constructing itin Houstons local-meets-global cultural stew, ensures the bandcontinues to sound like no one but itself. A cascade of crispmelodies emanates from Markos reverb-heavy electric, dancinggently around Laura Lees minimalist almost-dub bass triangles,while DJs drums serve as the tightened-up pocket and unwaveringdance-floor on which all this movement takes place. Yet theres afreshness to A La Salas instrumental interactivity, less concernedwith getting further out than going deeper in, a profound desire tocelebrate the worlds external wonders. Where prior albums strivedtowards musics polyglot edges, such inquiries now sound likebeloved intimacies. Here, Khruangbins sonic touch-points whether spaghetti-western film scores (on Fifteen Fifty-Three),West African discos (on Pon Pón), G-funk fantasias (TodavíaViva), living room dancing moments (the first single, A LoveInternational), or even ambient found-sounds (on Farolim deFelgueiras and throughout the album)  are ingrainedcharacteristics. This is who they are! Unique and huge (andgrowing), ambitious and driven.\n\nKhruangbins aspirations and commitment to playful creativityeven extends to A La Salas vinyl packages, of which there will beseven distinctive covers and color-sets. Designed by the bandusing Markos multitude of travelog photos, the images arewindows from the bands living room onto a set of daydreams,scenes of impossible skies, external glances that illuminate what isgoing on inside. Each cover image comes with a matching colorvinyl. These too are all about looking out and looking back, in orderto better look ahead.\n\nQuick View\n\nNoah Kahan\n\nStick Season (We'll All Be Here Forever) [Limited Edition Indie Exclusive Bone 3 LP]\n\nVinyl: $64.98 Buy\n\nOver the past year, GRAMMY Best New Artist-nominated Vermont singer & songwriter Noah Kahan has exploded from his New England roots into the global mainstream and has been touted as one of this years biggest and best new artists.

A rapid-fire follow-up of new originals, 2022s Dropout Boogie, featured the duo working with outside writers for the first time: Greg Cartwright of Memphis rockers Reigning Sound and Angelo Petraglia, who has worked with Kings of Leon and the teenage Taylor Swift. (Cartwright and Petraglia are back for Ohio Players too.)\n\nWe'd never worked harder to make a record, Dan Auerbach says. It's never taken us this long to make an album. We took our time and did it right.\n\nWhat we wanted to accomplish with this record was make something that was fun, Patrick Carney says. And something that most bands 20 years into their career dont make, which is an approachable, fun record that is also cool.\n\nWhile making Ohio Players, a title inspired by the legendary Dayton, OH funk band of the same name, The Black Keys were also DJing dance parties in cities around the world that they called record hangs, spinning 45s from their own eclectic and growing collections. Mojo reports, The spirit of those parties infused the albums DNA. Thats been the fun of it, [says] Auerbach. Letting go a little bit.\n\nQuick View\n\nGrandaddy\n\nBlu Wav [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition Nebula LP]\n\nVinyl: $25.98 Buy\n\nLegendary indie-rock band Grandaddy has announced a brand new studio album Blu Wav set for release February 16, 2024 via Dangerbird Records. A prolific storyteller, Jason Lytle is inspired by the overwhelming beauty of nature to the mundane moments that spark lifes strongest memories. Introducing pedal steel into the bands repertoire for the first time, buoyant lead single Watercooler comments on the dichotomy of both. It was inspired by having his own outdoorsy rock guy (in both senses of the word) lifestyle while his partner had an office job. Lytle shares, Most of my relationships have involved girls who worked in office settings. This song is about the end of one, or perhaps a few, of those relationships. Listeners will also notice the pedal steel on this track and eventually on many others from the forthcoming new album. Its a first for Grandaddy, and I couldn't be more thrilled about this fact. With the album title Blu Wav meant to be a literal mash-up of bluegrass and new wave, the new collection has a distinct feel, a uniform vibe, and a somewhat unexpected sound. It was conceived as Grandaddy maestro Jason Lytle was driving through the Nevada desert, and Patti Pages \"Tennessee Waltz\" came across the classic country station on the radio. He was immediately intrigued by the possibilities of what it might sound like to keep the slow sway and sweet, simple lyrics of the bluegrass waltz while adding layers of dense synthesizers and the electronics of new wave. It incorporates the lo-fi lushness and sometimes-psychedelic orchestration Grandaddy is known for with Lytles first foray into true country. Seven of its 13 songs are waltzes, and as Lytle notes, theres an inordinate amount of pedal steel. Grandaddy recently celebrated their legacy with a series of 20th anniversary reissues including the acclaimed Sumday Twunny box set which earned a Pitchfork Best New Reissue. Lytle also contributed vocals to a posthumous Sparklehorse album by request of his friend and fellow psychedelic pop auteur Mark Linkous family. Grandaddy has released five official LPs, most recently 2017s Last Place. Grandaddy members include Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Tim Dryden, and the late Kevin Garcia, who passed away in 2017.\n\nQuick View\n\nThe Black Crowes\n\nHappiness Bastards [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition Clear LP]\n\nVinyl: $24.98 UNAVAILABLE\n\nThe Black Crowes are leaving the bullshit in the past. Fifteen years after their last album of original music, the Robinson Brothers present Happiness Bastards - their 10th studio album. Some may say the project has been several tumultuous years in the making, but we argue it's arriving at just the right time. Call it brotherly love or music destiny that brought them back together, the highly anticipated record consecrating the reunion of this legendary band just may be the thing that saves rock & roll. In a time where the art form is buried beneath the corporate sheen of its successors, The Black Crowes are biting back with the angst of words left unsaid penned on paper and electrified by guitar strings, revealing stripped, bare-boned rock & roll. No gloss, no glitter, just rhythm and blues at it's very best - gritty, loud, and in your face.\n\nSince The Black Crowes reunited in 2019, they've made a triumphant return to form with over 150 shows spanning 20 countries worldwide, celebrating the 30th anniversary of Shake Your Money Maker, the album that put them on the map. Upon their return from the road, they knew they needed something new to show for their lost time. The Robinson Brothers and longtime bassist Sven Pipien headed to the studio with producer Jay Joyce in early 2023 and the experiences of years past transcribed themself through the music as the band found their way back to their roots. And it's finally here - Happiness Bastards is out March 15, 2024.\n\nQuick View\n\nAce Frehley\n\n10,000 Volts [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition LP]\n\nVinyl: $32.99 Buy\n\nGRAMMY- NOMINATED R&RHOF INDUCTEE AND GUITAR LEGEND ACE FREHLEY ANNOUNCES THE RELEASE OF HIS NEW STUDIO ALBUM, 10, 000 VOLTS, DUE OUT ON FEBRUARY 23, 2024.

Also included is a new and improved mastering of Erdelyis original 1985 mix of the album. This deluxe edition also features a disc of unreleased recordings (among them, unearthed material from the bands January 1985 session produced by Big Star legend Alex Chilton); as well as The Replacements entire January 11, 1986, show at the Cabaret Metro in Chicago. In total, the box includes 65 tracks50 of which have never been heard before.\n\nPresented in a 12 x 12 hardcover book  loaded with dozens of previously unseen photos - the set features a detailed history of the TIM era written by Bob Mehr, who produced the box with Rhinos Jason Jones. Mehr, author of The New York Times bestseller Trouble Boys: The True Story of The Replacements, won a Grammy® award for his album notes to the bands 2019 release, DEAD MANS POP.\n\nIn addition to the revelatory new mix, the TIM: LET IT BLEED EDITION also boasts a fresh cover, featuring an instantly iconic 1985 image of the band in its Minneapolis rehearsal space, taken by noted photographer Moshe Brakha. Coincidentally, Brakha shot the cover of The Ramones' 1977 album LEAVE HOME, a record which marked the first collaboration between Tommy Erdelyi and Ed Stasium.\n\nStasium  who was originally considered to co-produce TIM with Erdelyi back in 1985  was entrusted with the remix in 2022 and went back to the original multi-tracks, spending several months creating a fuller, deeply detailed and ultimately more satisfying version of the record, which finally captures the bands raw power. Stasium also completed work on several previously unreleased Tim songs and alternates and did mixes of the Alex Chilton session material.\n\nEven before signing with Sire/Warner Bros. in early 1985, The Replacements  singer/guitarist Paul Westerberg, bassist Tommy Stinson, drummer Chris Mars and lead guitarist Bob Stinson  began recording new material with their musical/spiritual godfather Alex Chilton that January in their hometown of Minneapolis. They followed up by cutting initial demos with Erdelyi in April, then starting the Tim sessions in earnest that summer. Sons Of No One: Rare & Unreleased collects all that material, including illuminating alternate versions of songs like Cant Hardly Wait, Bastards of Young, and Hold My Life  plus a unique and previously unheard original, Havin Fun, written by Tommy Stinson, and sung by Westerberg.\n\nThe final disc, Not Ready For Prime Time, captures the band performing live at Chicagos Cabaret Metro in January 1986. A soundboard recording made by the bands live mixer, the late Monty Lee Wilkes, the show was a one-off date that came just a week before the groups infamous appearance on NBCs Saturday Night Live, which ultimately saw them banned from the network. The 28-song Metro performance finds the original lineup of the band at its final peak, with incendiary versions of Replacements classics (Color Me Impressed, Answering Machine), rarely played deep cuts (Mr. Whirly, Go), as well covers of the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Sham 69, plus a rare lead vocal turn from Bob Stinson on The Novas Minnesota garage rock classic The Crusher.\n\nAdditionally, TIM: LET IT BLEED EDITON will include Stasiums new mix of the record on 180-gram vinyl, cut by Chris Bellman of Bernie Grundman mastering.\n\nQuick View\n\nSlowdive\n\neverything is alive [Crystal Clear LP]\n\nVinyl: $25.98 UNAVAILABLE\n\neverything is alive, Slowdives 5th record, is exactly what the title suggests: an exploration into the shimmering nature of life and the universal touch points within it.\n\nWhile there are parts of this record that could sit neatly next to the atmospheric quality of 1995s Pygmalion; everything is alive also manages to break down the boundaries of whats come before it. Spanning psychedelic soundscapes, pulsating 80s electronic elements and John Cale inspired journeys, the album lands immediately as something made for 2023 and beyond.\n\nFor a genre that is often thought of as divisive, and often warrants introspection, here Slowdive show their craft as the masters of it by pushing it outwards, beyond the singular; the end result being a record which feels as emotional and cathartic as it is hopeful.\n\nQuick View\n\nOlivia Rodrigo\n\nGUTS [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition Lavender LP]\n\nVinyl: $29.99 UNAVAILABLE\n\nVideo Free Stuff\n\n3-time GRAMMY® award winning recording artist olivia rodrigo will release her new album, GUTS, on september 8th via geffen records. available to pre-order now.\n\nGUTS was recorded with producer daniel nigro, who also collaborated with her on SOUR, her chart-topping, 4x platinum debut album.\n\nfor me, this album is about growing pains and about trying to figure out who I am at this point in my life and exactly what I want to say in my songs.\"\n\nVideo Free Stuff\n\nQuick View\n\nDuran Duran\n\nDanse Macabre [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition Smog 2LP]\n\nVinyl: $39.98 Buy\n\nDuran Duran return with their new album Danse Macabre.

Recorded across multiple continents - in the bands Sundlaugin studio in Iceland, the legendary Abbey Road in the UK and a number of studios in the US - ÁTTA leans heavily towards the orchestral, and touches on everything that has made Sigur Rós one of the most ambitious and acclaimed bands of recent times, with close to ten million albums sold, whilst signposting an exciting and expansive possibility for their future. ÁTTA prominently features the London Contemporary Orchestra conducted by Robert Ames, alongside brass performed by longtime Icelandic collaborators Brassgat í bala.

The album has been produced by Aaron Dessner and features 14 new tracks.\n\nLast autumn, I found that my friends and I were going through so many life changes. After the heat of the summer, everything either calmed, settled, fell apart, came to a head or imploded, says Ed Sheeran.\n\nWhen I went through a difficult time at the start of last year, writing songs helped me understand my feelings and come to terms with what was going on, and when I learned about my friends different situations, I wrote songs, some from their perspectives, some from mine, to capture how they and I viewed the world at that time. There were highs of falling in love and new friendships among lows of heartbreak, depression, loneliness and confusion.\n\nMy dad and brother told me about a composer called Elgar, who composed Enigma Variations, where each of the 14 compositions were about a different one of his friends. This is what inspired me to make this album. When I recorded Subtract with Aaron Dessner, we clicked immediately. We wrote and recorded non-stop and this album was born out of that partnership. I feel he has captured the feeling of autumn so wonderfully in his sonics and I hope everyone loves it as much as I do.\n\nQuick View\n\nThe Rolling Stones\n\nHackney Diamonds [Indie Exclusive Limited Edition Diamond Clear LP]\n\nVinyl: $32.99 UNAVAILABLE\n\nVideo\n\nHackney Diamonds is the hugely anticipated new album by The Rolling Stones.

The winds of change were blowing through Wayne Shorter's life and career in 1970. The saxophonist had just left Miles Davis' group and was soon to form his collective fusion band Weather Report. His music was evolving too as he began to delve into his own unique fusion explorations on his previous two Blue Note recordings Super Nova and Moto Grosso Feio. Recorded in August 1970, the mesmerizing Odyssey of Iska would be the last release of Shorter's early Blue Note period. The album was a tribute to his daughter Iska-who had been born the year before with severe brain damage-with four immersive Shorter compositions portraying a variety of moods: \"Wind,\" \"Storm,\" \"Calm,\" and \"Joy.\" The album's centerpiece is an extended version of Bobby Thomas' Brazilian influenced piece \"De Pois do Amor, o Vazio\" (After Love, Emptiness), foreshadowing Shorter's growing interest in Brazilian music which he would explore further in the years to come. Shorter's soprano and tenor saxophones are the lone horns heard on the album which featured Gene Bertoncini on guitar, David Friedman on vibraphone and marimba, Ron Carter and Cecil McBee on bass, and Alphonse Mouzon, Billy Hart, and Frank Cuomo contributing drums and percussion.\n\nQuick View\n\nDonald Byrd\n\nByrd Blows On Beacon Hill (Blue Note Tone Poet Series)\n\nVinyl: $38.98 Buy\n\nVinyl LP pressing.

The standards heavy set was captured on a rainy Spring afternoon in the Beacon Hill home of engineer Steve Fassett which provided a casual atmosphere that gave the album both it's title and it's easy-going charm.

This album is one of my more personal records to date. It's not a full biography, but my personal experiences are tied up in all of my music. A lot of the records are me. Some are from the POV of a character. and some are me. The album weaves things from my life as an artist, touching on things other artists go through. The narrative follows a battle rapper through various moments in his career, starting with how they honed their battle rap skills, following their career through different moments.\n\nMusically, the new album finds Lupe delighting in the simple pleasures of assembling assonant syllables into playful and poignant narratives. The 8-track album is smooth, yet cerebral, brimming with ideas, but always radiating Lupes pure love for the art of emceeing and committing himself as a servant of the rap game. The album was produced in full by longtime collaborator and friend, Soundtrakk (Superstar, Kick, Push, HipHop Saved My Life), their second time linking up on a full album after 2022s DRILL MUSIC IN ZION, and is also the first time Lupe, Trakk, and longtime manager Charles Chill Patton were in the studio together since Pattons release from prison in 2023. It felt great to be back in the studio again as a family, Lupe says. Its the first time theyd worked together in the studio since Lupes seminal album, The Cool in 2005.\n\nThe word samurai means to serve, Lupe says on the albums title. My relationship to that word has always meant that you need to be at the service of other people, either in the overall community, or in this instance, the rap community at large that Ive been a part of for years. You have some duty, some purpose to serve. The title alone is very important to me. Before rap even, martial arts was my whole life, and it still plays a huge role in my life. The album is me, but also inspired by a quote I heard from one of my favorite artists. The overall themes of the album speak to the constant fight and the battle one goes through being in the entertainment industry. Some of the things we need to defend.\n\nQuick View\n\nGracie Abrams\n\nThe Secret of Us [Yellow Vinyl]\n\nVinyl: $32.99 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nGracie Abrams returns with her sophomore album, \"The Secret of Us\" released via Interscope Records.

Their new album Pulsar, is a focused but far-reaching record, the jubilant testament of a band with plenty to say and the skills to say it themselves. Across 10 tracks, L'ImpÃ©ratrice move freely and authoritatively among the sounds they love, bridging hip-hop, kosmische, and modern pop with their most unabashed embraces of French Touch and international house ever. Benguigui, meanwhile, boldly sings of self-empowerment by shirking beauty standards, ageism, and drab normalcy, with a little help from an exciting set of new friends.A longtime fan who had seen the band multiple times, Maggie Rogers flew to Paris to lead the svelte and graceful \"Any Way,\" approaching the song with an unabashed vim. They had a similar encounter with Erick the Architect, who was so enthusiastic about the sample- based and panoramic \"Sweet & Sublime\" that Benguigui scrapped one of her own verses to make more room for him. And Italian singer Fabiana Martone (Nu Genea) crafted the melody for \"Danza Marilu\" the moment she heard it's disco thump. Throughout these 10 songs, L'ImpÃ©ratrice espouses the rare willingness to be real about life and it's woes while also sounding like a perfect picture of joy. Pulsar opens like a window being slid open onto an unimagined world. During the title-track finale, where a casual confession of suffering climbs into a mighty climax rooted in redemption, the band intertwines dubstep, turntablism, and symphonic strings to offer a bracing conclusion: however we are is OK.\n\nQuick View\n\nEels\n\nEELS Time!

Produced by longtime collaborator, friend and early champion Rick Rubin, The Avett Brothers is as much untitled as it is self-titled, for as Thomas Keating said: Silence is Gods first language  everything else is a poor translation.\n\nFrom the albums all-vocal opening to the sharp, scrappy and scorching rock n roll blast of lead single Love Of A Girl, to the novel strains of folk, roots, synth and strings that have landed The Avett Brothers numerous Billboard Top 5 and chart-topping albums, three GRAMMY nominations, five Americana Music Awards, a documentary co-directed by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio, and so much more, this record is one that revealed itself naturally over time.\n\nRecorded in Malibus Shangri-La Studios, as well as Nashville, Mar Vista, and the bands hometown of Concord, NC, The Avett Brothers is a collection of songs seen through a lens of independently studied spirituality; questions and considerations in the interest of the divine unknowable. In an ongoing attempt to comprehend existence and our interpersonal connectedness, these songs seek the sacred in the commonplace: a cheap cup of coffee, the smallest movement of love, broken hearts and school bus lessons, a babys first and second steps, growing older and holding on to ones roots, losing someone and accepting fate, rediscovering hope and finding sanctity in tragedy...ultimately reveling in the fun and surrender of what we cannot understand.\n\nAs their first full length release on Ramseur Records/Thirty Tigers since 2007s Emotionalism, The Avett Brothers is both a cumulative opus and fresh start for the bands future as a multifaceted and singular force.\n\nQuick View\n\nSturgill Simpson\n\nMetamodern Sounds In Country Music (Anniversary Edition)\n\nVinyl: $29.98 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nMetamodern Sounds in Country Music is the second studio album by American country music singer-songwriter Sturgill Simpson.

With Dan Auerbach's production, the album delves deep into themes of heartache and healing, and showcases the band's trademark wry psychedelia, energetic nostalgia, and flourishes of retro beauty.

Internally, there was the need to challenge themselves as songwriters while retaining the merciless intensity and unflinching honesty that have always been their calling cards. Externally, there was a whole new set of eyes on the hard-touring Louisville quintet, following a banner year in which theyd brought their underground-seasoned sound to some of the worlds biggest stages, finding themselves the unlikely viral darlings of both Coachella and Bonnaroo.\n\nThe creative process was arduous, with the band writing close to 40 songs across a span of four years before locking in the 10 tracks that make up new LP You Wont Go Before Youre Supposed To. But in the end, vocalist Bryan Garris, guitarists Isaac Hale and Nicko Calderon, bassist Kevin Otten and drummer Kevin Pac Sun Kaine honed a diverse, cohesive and savagely intense album that both sums up the massive strides theyve taken during their decade as a band, and asserts their boundless potential going forward.\n\nRaging lead single Blinding Faith skillfully wields whiplash tempo changes in service of a scathing indictment of religious groupthink. Dont Reach for Me combines the bands signature frenzied attack with deliberate catchiness and refreshing sonic variety. While Suffocate, featuring pop-meets-metal trailblazer Poppy, contrasts an oppressive heaviness befitting the title with a dance-y, syncopated groove and, midway through, the most concussive reggaeton rhythm youve ever heard.\n\nThe album title  a phrase that a fellow passenger said to Garris to soothe his severe air-travel anxiety during a particularly trying flight  strikes a note of reassurance. But glossing over negative emotions isnt what Knocked Loose are about. The new songs find them plumbing new depths of loathing  directed both inward and outward  and tortuous anguish. Musically, theyre leaning into their most extreme impulses, from blastbeat-driven fury, chaotic turbulence and seismic breakdowns, while seasoning the mix with ear-catching auxiliary percussion, evocative samples and shout-along hooks, all interwoven to perfection by Grammy-nominated, pop-savy producer Drew WZRD BLD Fulk.\n\nTheres no ceiling for hardcore in 2024  even an outfit as uncompromising as Knocked Loose can turn up in mainstream-adjacent spaces and win over new fans. But theres a center to what they do that will never change: uncompromising heaviness, both sonically and thematically. What is evolving is their drive to find new ways to convey that heaviness, and add tasteful variety that only highlights their undiminished ferocity. E"
