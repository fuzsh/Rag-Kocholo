        "text": "My father was born and raised in East Tennessee, right on the foothills of the Smoky Mountains. He got married and moved to Oklahoma before I was born, but every summer we would spend a week or two in East Tennessee with his family. I have many fond memories there of playing “Red Light, Green Light” with my grandmother and cousins, learning to skateboard, swimming in the freezing mountain streams, and shooting fireworks on the Fourth of July.\n\nA few years after I graduated college I moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and lived for a little over a year before I moved away to Indiana to see if I could really make a go with the girl who would become my wife. We lived in West Tennessee for a few years while she taught French at a university.\n\nWhile I don’t always agree with its politics, I truly love Tennessee, its beauty, and its people.\n\nAs I was pondering what sorts of shows I could post of Jerry Garcia next I thought it would be fun to see how often he played the Volunteer State.\n\nTurns out, it wasn’t very often. The Jerry Garcia Band was only scheduled to play Tennessee once, Memphis in March of 1976 but it got canceled due to illness in the band.\n\nThe Grateful Dead played in Memphis on June 19, 1970. According to this article, it was not a good show and Garcia swore they’d never come back. As far as I can tell, no tape of that show has ever surfaced.\n\nThey did play Nashville, Tennessee three times. The first was in October of 1972. Unfortunately, only a section of the second set seems to have been recorded. Then they played in April 1978 and then again in December of that same year. Tapes of these shows do exist, and as you can hear they were a good ones.\n\nGarcia did not keep his word, for some twenty-five years later the Dead returned to Memphis for a two-night run in April of 1995 at the cool-looking Pyramid arena.\n\nThe Memphis Pyramid really does look amazing sitting there on the banks of the Mississippi, but by all accounts, it was a terrible place to see a show, with awful acoustics. They turned it into a Bass Pro Shop in 2015 and ruined the look of it by putting their massive and ugly logo on the outside of it.\n\nThere are recordings of both shows, and they aren’t bad for Dead gigs in 1995.\n\nI often have this idea that I can be one of those amazing people who create mix tapes of the best performances from an artist. I think how cool it would be to make a mix of Bob Dylan in the 1980s or Van Morrison playing in San Francisco throughout his career, or even the Grateful Dead performing in the great state of Tennessee.\n\nBut making mixes takes a lot of time and know-how. You have to acquire all the shows and then listen to them. Then you should probably listen to them again to make sure you didn’t miss anything. If there are multiple sources then you need to figure out which one sounds best. Once you have the songs picked out you need to listen again to determine the song order. You might need to make edits to the songs to cut out banter or crowd noise. Then you’ll want to do a little mastering so that each song has the same amount of volume, etc.\n\nAt some point along the way, I just give up. You would think a mix of just three shows would be fairly simple, but I never seem to have the time. Maybe one day I’ll make a true Grateful Dead in Tennessee mix, but for now you just get the shows.\n\nAnd without further ado…"
