        "text": "popular name: Memphis Minnie\n\ndate_of_death: August 6, 1973\n\nage: 76\n\ncause_of_death: Stroke\n\nclaim_to_fame: Music\n\nbest_know_for: She transcended both gender and genre. Her recording career reached from the 1920s heyday of country blues to cutting electric sides in 1950s Chicago studios for the Chess subsidiary Checker. Minnie helped form the roots of electric Chicago blues, as well as R&B and rock ‘n’ roll\n\npopular name: Miles Davis\n\ndate_of_death: September 28, 1991\n\nage: 65\n\ncause_of_death: Stroke, pneumonia, and respiratory failure\n\nclaim_to_fame: Music\n\nbest_know_for: There are few musical geniuses in this world, but as jazz trumpeter, composer and bandleader Miles Davis is one of the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. His sound, technique and restless innovation as an individual performer and as a leader of jazz bands and groups won him recognition as perhaps the foremost setter of style and fashion in what is often called America's only indigenous musical art form.\n\npopular name: Bob Wills\n\ndate_of_death: May 13, 1975\n\nage: 70\n\ncause_of_death: Complications from a stroke and pneumonia\n\nclaim_to_fame: Music\n\nbest_know_for: Bob Wills was a bandleader, fiddler, singer, and songwriter who is the most famous exponent of the popular musical genre now known as western swing, which synthesized ragtime, traditional fiddling, New Orleans jazz, blues, Mexican songs, and big band swing. Wills, along with his band the Texas Playboys, toured and recorded nonstop throughout the 1940s and early 1950s amassing dozens of hits including \"Steel Guitar Rag\", \"New San Antonio Rose\", \"Smoke On The Water\", \"New Spanish Two Step\" and \"Faded Love.\" Wills had a heart attack in 1962 and a second one the next year, which forced him to disband the Playboys, although Wills continued to perform solo. He was recording an album with fan Merle Haggard in 1973 when a stroke left him comatose for 17 months until his death in 1975. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Wills and the Texas Playboys in 1999."
