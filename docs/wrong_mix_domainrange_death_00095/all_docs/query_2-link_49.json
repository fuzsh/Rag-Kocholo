        "text": "(1917–82). “The high priest of bebop,” Thelonious Monk composed dozens of enduring songs and was one of the greatest jazz pianists. His music is marked by sudden chords, surprising rhythms, subtle melodies, and, mostly, by its swing.\n\nThelonious Sphere Monk was born on October 10, 1917, in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. In his early childhood his family moved to New York, New York, where he taught himself to play the piano. When he was 13 he joined the school band. He also played the organ in church, and in his teenage years he accompanied a traveling evangelist in her revival services. While still a young musician he wrote his best-known song, “’Round Midnight” and began developing an original piano style influenced by Duke Ellington and blues pianists.\n\nIn the early 1940s Monk was among the young musicians—including trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker—whose advanced ideas led to bebop. He encouraged several promising musicians—including Bud Powell, piano; Art Blakey, drums; and Miles Davis, trumpet—and for many years led small groups. Yet he seldom made recordings.\n\nAt last, in the mid-1950s Monk performed regularly. In 1957 and 1958 he played long engagements at a New York jazz club. The next year he formed a quartet that included Charlie Rouse, a tenor saxophonist who played with him for more than 10 years. The Monk Quartet became an international success. By this time many of his works—including “Blue Monk,” “Epistrophy,” “Evidence,” and “Well, You Needn’t”—had become standard songs.\n\nMonk joined the Giants of Jazz group, which included Gillespie and Blakey, in a 1971–72 concert tour around the world and then retired from music. For the rest of his life he performed only three more times. His last concert was in 1976. Monk died of a cerebral hemorrhage on February 17, 1982, in Englewood, New Jersey."
