We understand this news will come as a shock to the whole world and the millions who love her music. We are sure she will forever be remembered for her exceptional music, for her genius, her talent, her courage, her fight for racial justice and her commitment to the Civil Rights Movement. She will forever be remembered as the ultimate songstress and storyteller of our times.\n\nWe give thanks to the DIVA for sharing almost 50 years of music with us. We give thanks to Dr. NINA SIMONE for the beauty, consolation and strength her voice, piano and songs will give until the end of time to people, regardless of age, race and culture. You and your music will be with us every day of our life, in our heart, in our soul, in our thoughts. In our mind. May you rest in peace, dearest NINA. God bless you.\n\nJune 21, 2003 St. Luke C.M.E.
