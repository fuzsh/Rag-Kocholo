        "text": "Background\n\nThelonious Monk was a pivotal figure in the jazz movement of the early 1940s. Monk’s distinct piano approach and skill as a composer established him as a pioneer in the creation of modern jazz. Monk was born in North Carolina on October 10, 1917. His parents were Thelonious and Barbara Monk. Monk’s family relocated to Manhattan, New York City when he was only four years old. Monk started to play piano at six, learning just by observing his sister playing the instrument. He attended the Juilliard School of Music to study theoretical music due to his great musical inclination. He began playing in the house band at Harlem’s Minton’s Playhouse in 1941 and later contributed to the creation of the Bebop jazz school.\n\nAt the start of his professional career, Monk performed at jazz performances, sang in jazz bars, and played with small groups. As soon as his potential was noticed, Riverside Records signed him, which eventually led to a recording contract with Columbia Records. Monk gained commercial success soon after. Both critics and listeners praised his 1963 album “Monk’s Dream.” He was one of the few jazz musicians to appear on the cover of “Time” magazine. Monk, who was one of the legends of American jazz music, won the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993. He also received a posthumous Pulitzer Prize Special Citation in 2006.\n\nMonk wed Nellie Smith in 1947. They had two children, Barbara Monk, and T. S. Monk. Monk’s mental health began to deteriorate in the 1960s, and by the middle of the 1970s, his mental illness had made him a hermit and a loner. Despite being given lithium and antipsychotic medications, his mental instability remained unchanged. He passed away on February 17, 1982, from a stroke and was laid to rest in New York."
