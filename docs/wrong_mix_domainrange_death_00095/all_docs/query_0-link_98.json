Anti-Flag is a political punk band, which is obvious from their name alone. But over the course of 12 albums across more than 25 years together, theyÂve rarely set their sights on singular individuals in songs. Unlike their punk predecessors in the 80s, who made targets of Reagan and his cronies, Anti-Flag has always opted not to date their work with current references, instead focusing on fighting ongoing oppression and dismantling deeply rooted systems of injustice. But on their new album, 20/20 Vision, the band drew a big, fat line in the sand.\n\nPressed on translucent Red vinyl.\n\n1. Hate Conquers All\n\n2. It Went Off Like A Bomb\n\n3. 20/20 Vision\n\n4.

They put it on their T-shirts and proclaimed it religiously from the stage everywhere they went. On this double album by the same name, is the band's history unfolding from a new lens, chronologically through remastered singles, covers, and previously unreleased tracks over sides A and B. Sides C and D present a never before heard (or even torrented) example of their bombastic live experience: a concert recording from the legendary Blind Pig in Champaign-Urbana. The gatefold artwork contains a band family tree of sorts, centering Brainiac to many of their local contemporaries as well as various pictures from the band's personal collections. Listening to this release will not get you Y2K compliant, but it is a fresh reminder of how exciting Brainiac was as well as further evidence that Ohio once reigned supremely weird.\n\nPerfect Suicide / Still Insane / Superduper Sonic / Ride / Simon Says / Dexatrim / Petrified / Go!\n\nDo It! / Sugar Coma / Cookie Don't Sing / Sexual Frustration End / Go Freaks Go / Beekeepers Maxim / Pussyfootin' / Give Me A Myth / Mr Fingers / Vincent Come On Down / Ice Slides Away / Hot Metal Dobermans / Hands Of The Genius / Flypaper / Cultural Zero / I Am A Cracked Machine\n\nFrom Dayton Ohio Brainiac Brainiac Touch & Go 2 x LP RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th 1000\n\nBrainiac\n\nAttic Tapes\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 6/12/2021\n\nFormat: 2 x LP\n\nLabel: Touch & Go\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nThe music of Brainiac ended with the death of frontman Tim Taylor in 1997. Offered here is a glimpse into the working mind of Taylor as he susses out tunes and sound experiments in their rawest form, mostly alone with a four track in his mother's attic. Some are mere sketches. Many never again saw the light of day, or morphed so much they are more like distant cousins of future songs. Some of the more interesting Brainiac songs, like Fucking With The Altimeter, Silver Iodine, or Strung, were elevated from the original four and eight track demos later in the studio environment. Attic Tapes serves as a blueprint for how these types of tunes developed. The entire program is stitched together like a distorted dream. Jumping from one scene to the next, it progresses through all four sides in a historically linear fashion, from the very early days through to the final rehearsals.\n\nWhile this is not an official Brainiac album, it begins to feel akin to what a Brainiac record might sound like if it were produced by neighbor and Guided by Voices raconteur Robert Pollard. Inside the release are some historically related liner notes written by guitarist John Schmersal giving further insight into the origins and backdrop of the demos and the time they were created.\n\nDraggin' Me Down / Still Insane Velveteen / A Load of Your Fables / All I Have Is Stolen / Factotum / Silver Iodine #1 / Godpocket / Red Silhouette #1 / Let's Lose / Wrecked Choke Riffs / Oh Donna Collage / Apple Of My Heart / Silver Iodine #2 / You All The Time / Banzai Superstar / Sidewalk Culture / I Will Haunt You / Frustration Excerpt / Charles / Ask / Subsurface Genderflux / Flypaper Jam / Cookie Don't Sing / Horses & Ammunition #1 / Toby's International\n\nPathogens / Signal Flow / Indian Poker Part 0 / Marble Mausoleum / Red Silhouette #2 / Stealing Flowers / Swan Song / Baje Con Los Locos / Dr Fingers / Blow Fly / Horses & Ammunition #2 / The Jesus Christ Of Rug Burns\n\nAttic Tapes Brainiac Brainiac Touch & Go 2 x LP RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th 1000\n\nBrotha Lynch Hung/C-Bo\n\nBlocc Movement\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 6/12/2021\n\nFormat: 2 x LP\n\nLabel: RBC\n\nQuantity: 1000\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th\n\nMORE INFO\n\n2001Âs Blocc Movement is an album combining the acclaimed gangster rap of C-Bo with the horrorcore of Brotha Lynch Hung, a style heÂs credited with innovating.

The result was ÂIÂm Starting to Bleed,Â a pastiche of late-period Bowie and ÂCruisinÂÂ-era Smokey Robinson infused with a creeping sense of dread. The remixed, reimagined ÂIÂm Starting to Bleed (Pastoral)Â strips the song back to its studs, trading the original instrumentation for guitars orchestrated by 1970s Film Stock. ÂWhen Was the Last TimeÂ was recorded as a bare-bones acoustic performance at The Ramkat in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Don Dixon suggested making a record out of it, noting that Johnny Cash magicked some of his TV appearances into album tracks. Dixon and FosterÂs additions of drums, bass, electric guitar and strings, Beth McKeeÂs Wurlitzer, and Marti JonesÂ pristine backing vocals turned it into a panoramic pop song. ÂTell SomebodyÂ is a wall of sound full of sonic nods to The Who, Big Star, and Teenage Fanclub at their Bandwagonesque best. ÂHeadinÂ HomeÂ is a tossed-off ode to pandemic isolation, like the FlaminÂ Groovies reluctantly following a stay-at-home-order. Dixon and Mitch Easter pulled the mixes together, while Dave McNair (Bowie, Dylan, Patti Smith) mastered the record. The IÂm Starting to Bleed EP probably couldnÂt have been made outside of the disorienting cauldron of the past year. Foster is currently working on his next full-length album.\n\nProceeds from this release, and three others in this series support The Shalom Project (an organization that supports NC families in need).\n\nThis is a regional release and though itÂs available to all RSD-participating stores, it will primarily be available at stores in North Carolina.\n\nSide 1: 1) ÂI'm Starting To BleedÂ\n\nSide 2: 1) ÂWhen Was The Last TimeÂ 2) ÂTell SomebodyÂ 3) ÂHeadin' HomeÂ 4) ÂI'm Starting To Bleed (pastoral)Â\n\nSide B: ÂIn A Minor KeyÂ, ÂIt Must Be Raining SomewhereÂ, ÂUn Autre TempsÂ, ÂCome Home To MeÂ, ÂThere's A Dream Around The CornerÂ, ÂCerulean Is LovelyÂ\n\nI'm Starting To Bleed Jeffrey Dean Foster Foster Record Store Day Vinyl RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th 250\n\nFrankie and the Witch Fingers\n\nBrain Telephone\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 6/12/2021\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: Greenway Records\n\nQuantity: 3000\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nBrain Telephone / Learnings Of The Light / Primitive Delight / Sunshine Earthquake / Microscope / Doomed Â / Sinister Poison / Owsley / Let Love Be Love / Mother's Mirror\n\nBrain Telephone Frankie and the Witch Fingers Frankie Greenway Records LP RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th 3000\n\nTwenty One Pilots\n\nLocation Sessions\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 6/12/2021\n\nFormat: 12\" Vinyl\n\nLabel: Fueled By Ramen\n\nQuantity: 16000\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nLive versions of three songs from Trench, as well as a live version of \"Level of Concern\"Â\n\nSide A:\n\nThe Hype (Berlin)\n\nCut My Lip (Brooklyn)\n\nSide B:\n\nChlorine (Mexico City)\n\nLevel of Concern (Live from Outside)\n\nLocation Sessions Twenty One Pilots Fueled Fueled By Ramen 12\" Vinyl RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th 16000\n\nGarbage\n\nNo Gods No Masters\n\nDETAILS\n\nDate: 6/12/2021\n\nFormat: LP\n\nLabel: Infectious/BMG\n\nQuantity: 2700\n\nRelease type: RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th\n\nMORE INFO\n\nRSD Drops edition of the brand new album with exclusive cover art and pressed on Pink vinyl.Â\n\nSIDE 1 1.

This is proven by the fact that four songs from this concert were included on the seventeen-track, seminal platinum-selling Europe '72 album.\n\nFeaturing an ÂOther OneÂ that comes out of Truckin' and weaves in and out of other thematic and deep-space jams, as well as a side trip to Me And Bobby McGee, this is some of the Grateful Dead's best, most inspired improvisation. The performance also includes five songs sung by Pigpen on what would be his final tour, including a massive Good Lovin' which allows Pigpen to do what he does best: hold the audience in the palm of his hand while they hang on his every word. Mixed from the 16-track analog master tapes by Jeffrey Norman and mastered for vinyl by GRAMMY Â® Award-winning engineer David Glasser.

Gruntruck's bloodlines were impeccable; the band was founded (where else?) in Seattle by two members of the pioneering grunge band Skin Yard, vocalist Ben McMillan and drummer Norman Scott. While in Skin Yard, Scott also briefly joined Soundgarden, and collaborated with Chris Cornell on a lesser-known band, the low frequency power trio Bass Truck. Lead guitarist Tommy Niemeyer from metal thrashers The AccÃ¼sed and bassist Tim Paul, previously of PDX hardcore punks Final Warning, rounded out the initial, classic line-up, which is what you hear on this 1992 record, which was produced by the band and fellow ex-Skin Yard member (and go-to grunge producer) Jack Endino. Previously released on vinyl only in Europe and Brazil (!), original copies of Push are virtually impossible to find, which is too bad; this record offered a mesmerizing mix of atonal riffage and hooky tunes like the single \"Tribe.\" This is its first-ever domestic vinyl release, and we're giving it a real \"Push\"; we've added two never-on-LP tracks (\"Crucifunkin'\" and \"Flesh Fever\") that the band recorded in between the sessions for Push and their first album, Inside Yours, and expanded the release to a killer 2-LP set (sequenced by Jack Endino himself) housed inside a gatefold jacket.

Music On Vinyl in cooperation with Sony Music and Alex Callier are releasing four Hooverphonic remix EPs. Each represents a Hooverphonic album: A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular, Blue Wonder Power Milk, The Magnificent Tree and Presents Jackie Cane.\n\nAlex Callier selected the best remixes of their songs for each remix EP. The first, A New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular remixes is available as part of RSD Drops. Only 2000 individually numbered copies on solid purple are pressed. (The other three are scheduled to be released later in 2021.\n\nHooverphonic are a Belgian band that formed in October 1995. Though originally categorized as a trip hop group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where they could no longer be described as a lone genre, but rather encompass alternative, electronica, electropop, rock, and a mixture of others. The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company.\n\nSince their formation, Hooverphonic's lineup consisted of bassist Alex Callier, guitarist Raymond Geerts, and various lead singers. Geike Arnaert (1997Â2008, 2020-present) has recently re-joined the band.\n\nHooverphonic were supposed to represent Belgium at the Eurovision Song Contest 2020. However, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They will instead represent Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2021.\n\nThe band achieved international recognition through the inclusion of the Stereophonic track \"2Wicky\" on the soundtrack to Bernardo Bertolucci's 1996 film Stealing Beauty. \"2Wicky\" also appeared on the soundtracks of I Know What You Did Last Summer and Heights. The track's main riff is sampled from Isaac Hayes' recording of the 1960s hit \"Walk On By\".\n\nÂInhalerÂ is, not least thanks to those wonderfully fanning out guitars, still a missed world hit.\n\nRemix duties are fulfilled by drum Ân bass producer Dj Pulse, owner of the Creative Wax label, and the late Hector Zazou. Both gave some LTJ Bukem-esque vibes to ÂInhalerÂ and Â2 WickyÂ.\n\nFurthermore, Alex Callier and the band re-recorded both songs and added some extra strings to ÂInhalerÂ.\n\nSide A 1. 2wicky (Dj Pulse Remix) 2. 2wicky (Not So Extended Hoovering Version)\n\nSide B: 1.

This 12 song LP compiles his 1970s output of incredibly raw and stripped-down blues. The tracks were recorded using a revolving door of Detroit musicians during late night/all night sessions in BoboÂs makeshift Detroit recording studio/record shop and were originally released on his own Big Star Records. It would come as no surprise to find out that bands like The Cramps and The Gories had copies of these singles in their collections.\n\nRSD DROPS 2021 LIMITED EDITION 1500 RELEASE ON PURPLE SPLATTER COLORED VINYL\n\nA1 New 44 Blues A2 I Love That Woman A3 First Left Home A4 Shake Em On Down A5 Here I Am A Fool In Love Again A6 Watergate Blues\n\nB1 If You Were The Only Woman B2 Share Cropper Blues B3 Trying To Get You Off My Mind B4 I Sure Got To Leave Your Town B5 You Will Never Understand B6 24 Years\n\nMy All New Life Story Bobo Jenkins Jenkins Third Man Records LP RSD Drops 2021 Jun 12th 1500\n\nElton John\n\nRegimental Sgt.

It's simultaneously the heaviest record they ever released, and the most varied, with delicate songs like \"Me, Myself, and I\" and \"Moonshine\" contrasting with the metal-verging-on-industrial mayhem of \"Drama.\" Twenty-five years is a long time to wait for an L7 album to come out on vinyl: for its overdue debut, Real Gone Music is pressing up 3000 copies for Record Store Day on (what else?)
