        "text": "Better know as Thelonious Monk, he was born on 10 October 10th, 1917 in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, USA, and died: 17 February 1982 in Weehawken, New Jersey, USA (aged 64).\n\nAmong the most influential musicians, especially amongst pianists, of the twentieth century.\n\nMonk had a idiosyncratic improvisational style, both musically and visually, and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire. He is often regarded as one of the founders of bebop, though his playing later evolved away from that style.\n\nBoth his prolific compositions and improvisations are full of dissonant harmonies and angular melodic twists, consistent with Monk’s unorthodox approach to the piano, combining a highly percussive attack with abrupt, usually very dramatic, usage of silences and hesitations.\n\nHe was also renowned for his distinctively sartorial style in suits, hats and his trademark sunglasses. He was also well known for his actions on stage during performances. While the other musicians in the group continued playing, he would sometimes stop, stand up from the piano, dance for a few moments, and then return to the piano and continue playing. Whether this was part of his act or because he was entranced in his art form has never been substantiated in the few interviews with him.\n\nOne of his regular dances consisted of continuously turning counter-clockwise, which has drawn comparisons to ring-shout and Muslim Sufi whirling.\n\nMonk is also one of only five jazz musicians to date to be featured on the cover of Time magazine (the other four being Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Wynton Marsalis, and Dave Brubeck).\n\nBlue Note Records (1948–1952)\n\nMain article: Thelonious Monk Blue Note Sessions\n\nGenius of Modern Music: Volume 1 (1947 Blue Note recordings)\n\nGenius of Modern Music: Volume 2 (1951–1952 Blue Note recordings)\n\nThelonious Monk Trio (Prestige 7027), 1952–4\n\nMonk (Prestige 7053) recorded 1953-4\n\nThelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins (Prestige 7075), recorded 1953-4\n\nThelonious Monk plays the Music of Duke Ellington (1955)\n\nThe Unique Thelonious Monk (1955)\n\nBrilliant Corners (1956 recording with Sonny Rollins and Clark Terry)\n\nThelonious Himself (1957)\n\nMonk’s Music (1957)\n\nMulligan Meets Monk (1957, with Gerry Mulligan)\n\nThelonious in Action and Misterioso (1958, live at the Five Spot with Johnny Griffin)\n\nThe Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall (1959, Charlie Rouse joined the band then)\n\n5 by Monk by 5 (1959)\n\nThelonious Alone in San Francisco (1959)\n\nThelonious Monk at the Blackhawk (1960, with Charlie Rouse)\n\nThelonious Monk with John Coltrane (1957 recordings, 1961 issue) – Inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nMonk in France (recorded in 1961)\n\nThelonious Monk in Italy (recorded 1961, released 1963)\n\nThelonious Monk and the Jazz Giants (1987)\n\nThelonious Monk Quartet Live at the Five Spot: Discovery!
