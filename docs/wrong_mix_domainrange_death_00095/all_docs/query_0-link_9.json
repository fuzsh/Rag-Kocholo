        "text": "To mark Lou Donaldson’s 88th birthday, I’m posting the complete proceedings of a two-day interview that I conducted with him for the Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Project on June 20 & 21, 2012, shortly after he was designated an NEA Jazz Master. If I may say so, it’s a fairly comprehensive conversation. Many thanks to Ken Kimery for giving me the assignment. I’m also linking to a 2011 post of the unedited proceedings of a DownBeat Blindfold Test that Lou did with me in 2006.\n\nLou Donaldson Oral History for Smithsonian (June 20-21, 2012):\n\nLOU DONALDSON\n\nNEA Jazz Master (2012)\n\nInterviewee: Louis Andrew “Lou” Donaldson (November 1, 1926-)\n\nInterviewer: Ted Panken\n\nDates: June 20 and 21, 2012\n\nDepository: Archives Center, National Music of American History,\n\nSmithsonian Institution.\n\nDescription: Transcript. 81 pp.\n\n[June 20th, PART 1, TRACK 1]\n\nPanken: I’m Ted Panken. It’s June 20, 2012, and it’s day one of an interview with Lou Donaldson for the Smithsonian Institution Oral History Jazz Project. I’d like to start by putting on the record, Mr. Donaldson, your full name and your parents’ names, your mother and father.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. Louis Andrew Donaldson, Jr. My father, Louis Andrew Donaldson, Sr. My mother was Lucy Wallace Donaldson.\n\nPanken: You grew up in Badin, North Carolina?\n\nDonaldson: Badin. That’s right. Badin, North Carolina.\n\nPanken: What kind of town is it?\n\nDonaldson: It’s a town where they had nothing but the Alcoa Aluminum plant. Everybody in that town, unless they were doctors or lawyers or teachers or something, worked in the plant.\n\nPanken: So it was a company town.\n\nDonaldson: Company town.\n\nPanken: Were you parents from there, or had they migrated there?\n\nDonaldson: No-no. They migrated.\n\nPanken: Where were they from?\n\nDonaldson: My mother was from Virginia. My father was from Tennessee. But he came to North Carolina to go to college.\n\nPanken: Which college did he go to?\n\nDonaldson: The college he went to was the oldest black college… I’m trying to think of it now. But Olds-heimers has got me. Not Alzheimers. Oldsheimer’s. It was in Salisbury, North Carolina. What was that college… Can’t think of it.\n\nPanken: We can look it up.\n\nDonaldson: You don’t have to look it up. I’ve got all that information in a book.\n\nPanken: Maybe we can get at it tomorrow. But in any event, how old were your parents? When were they born?\n\nDonaldson: They were old. What can I tell you?\n\nPanken: You don’t know the birthdates?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I know the birthdates. I’ve got all of that. If you need that. But they moved to Badin… My mother was a teacher. She went to Cheyney University in Pennsylvania, and she came back to this town and was a first grade teacher and music teacher, and choral director, band director, everything with music. My father was an AME Zion Methodist preacher and an insurance salesman. So we had a pretty stable family.\n\nPanken: You had two siblings, I think?\n\nDonaldson: Me?\n\nPanken: Yes. Did you have brothers and sisters?\n\nDonaldson: Yes, I have two sisters and one brother.\n\nPanken: Would you mind stating their names?\n\nDonaldson: Yes. My brother’s named William—William Donaldson. My older sister is Elouise Donaldson. My younger sister was Pauline.\n\nPanken: Did they all play music?\n\nDonaldson: Yup. All played music. All went into education. All are now retired and rich.\n\nPanken: Was your mother the main teacher?\n\nDonaldson: Not really. I mean, she started them out, but they originally went to college…all of them went to college.\n\nPanken: Now, socially, what was Badin, North Carolina like in the 1930s when you were growing?\n\nDonaldson: It wasn’t too much…\n\nPanken: Was it segregated? Well, it was the South.\n\nDonaldson: You KNOW it was segregated.\n\nPanken: But was it a bad town, were there ways…\n\nDonaldson: No, it was segregated. It wasn’t a bad town because all of them worked together. Blacks and whites worked together in the aluminum plant. 220 degrees Fahrenheit. They used to wear these suits like space suits, and sometimes that ore would pop out and get on that suit, go right through the suit and right to their arms. It was a tough job. What they did, they separated the bauxite from… They got the bauxite from South Africa, and they’d process it and get the aluminum out of there, and it would flow out into some vats. It was a tough job.\n\nPanken: What was your entry into music? I think I’ve read that you started out playing clarinet.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, I started playing clarinet. I didn’t want to play piano, because when she’d give lessons she had a switch, and when you’d miss a note she’d hit you across the fingers. So I said, “No-no, not me.” I was a baseball player. So that’s all I did, play baseball. But I used to go around the house humming, like the Bach Etudes and Haydn and all that, because I heard it when they played it on the piano. She got me one day and said, “Louis, you’ve got more music talent than anybody in this family; you can remember tunes and everything.” She said, “You need to start playing piano.” I said, “Not me.” She said, “All right, all right.” So she went across town and got a clarinet from the Alcoa Aluminum bandmaster. They had a band, all-white, of course. He gave her a clarinet. I mean, he sold her a clarinet. She brought it back. She didn’t know anything about a clarinet. But he had a book, and we studied the book, and I just learned how to play it.\n\nPanken: You studied yourself out of the book?\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: So you had a quick learning curve.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: Obviously, you were meant to play music.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, evidently.\n\nPanken: As a kid… You said you graduated high school when you were 15 and were the school valedictorian.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, right.\n\nPanken: So you must have had other interests besides music and sports. Or, if you weren’t that interested in school, it must have come fairly easily.\n\nDonaldson: Well, I was…what you call it…a precocious guy. I checked everything out. I could tell you right now New York Yankees in 1936.\n\nPanken: You mean the lineup?\n\nDonaldson: The whole lineup. I was a paper boy, and I used to deliver papers in the morning. I’d get up about 6 o’clock and deliver my papers, and about 7:30 I’d be finished with my papers, so I’d just sit on the front porch and read the sports. Way back.\n\nPanken: I know myself, box scores were a nice window into arithmetic and mathematics.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: But what were some of your other academic interests.\n\nDonaldson: Nothing really. I just…\n\nPanken: You just did well.\n\nDonaldson: I did well with anything, you know.\n\nPanken: So you graduated at 15. That’s 1941-42…\n\nDonaldson: ‘42.\n\nPanken: You were playing baseball, and you went directly to college?\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: Where did you go…\n\nDonaldson: North Carolina A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]. Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nPanken: How far away is Greensboro from Badin?\n\nDonaldson: From my home town, 64 miles north.\n\nPanken: What was that school like?\n\nDonaldson: Well, it was an agricultural and technical school. They didn’t have a music department. I mean, they had a music department, but they didn’t have a music degree. But I got into the band, and got to play in it, so I was all right.\n\nPanken: What sorts of things did you play in that band, and what sorts of things were you used to playing…\n\nDonaldson: Marching bands and little semi-classical tunes.\n\nPanken: Where I’m going with this is, were you performing at all as a kid in Badin?\n\nDonaldson: No, no-no, no-no. Nothing in Badin. Nobody performed there but Country-and-Western. Roy Acuff. Hank Williams. People like that. They didn’t have no jazz.\n\nPanken: No black bands were coming through.\n\nDonaldson: No, no-no. We had a big station, WBT, in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they had one guy there named Grady Cole. Grady Cole had one record by Louis Armstrong, “Bye, Bye Blackbird” on one side, “St. James Infirmary” on the other side, and he played it every… He loved it. I got to hear Louis singing and stuff. So that created my interest in jazz.\n\nPanken: Hearing Louis Armstrong on that record.\n\nDonaldson: That’s right. On that record.\n\nPanken: When you got to Greensboro, did jazz start to enter the picture more?\n\nDonaldson: No, not really. Because see, back then you couldn’t play jazz in college. If they caught you practicing jazz in the practice room, you couldn’t practice any more. They didn’t like jazz. They didn’t like nothing but classical and band music—the teachers. But what happened to me, a guy came from Seattle, Washington, named Billy Tolles, and he had been around all the musicians, and he had his saxophone. He could play. Excellent player. He knew Coleman Hawkins’ “Body and Soul” and he knew Lester Young’s “Just You, Just Me,” and used to play those things. He was way ahead of all of us country boys. We didn’t know anything like that. So we kind of idolized him and started to learn him. Whenever he went back for a break, we’d give him $2 or $3 to bring us back some jazz records, and he would do it.\n\nPanken: So you got into jazz, it sounds like, by memorizing solos…\n\nDonaldson: Well, not exactly memorizing. I sent for the music. I got Benny Goodman’s records, “Let’s Dance,” and Artie Shaw’s record, “Summit Ridge Drive.” I got the music. He’d bring the music back, and I’d practice…I’d learn them.\n\nPanken: You learned the solos off the transcriptions.\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: When did you start to transition from clarinet to alto saxophone?\n\nDonaldson: Well, it’s a funny story. In 1945 I was drafted into the U.S. Navy. I didn’t volunteer. I was drafted. And I went to Great Lakes. When you go to Great Lakes, you have a pool, say, of about 200 musicians. Anybody who says they’re a musician, they put them in the pool. A lot of them wasn’t that good. But I went in that pool, and I never went down to take an audition, because a lot of guys were there and they had this hair with the stuff in it…\n\nPanken: Pomade.\n\nDonaldson: They had the slick hair, and they’d walk with a hump in their back, and they brought their horn, their instrument. I didn’t take an instrument. I’d be talking to them and they said, “Yeah, I worked with Count Basie…” So I was there with my friend, Carl Foster. We came from A&T. I said, “Carl, no need for us to try out. We can’t compete with these guys. This guy has been with Lionel Hampton’s band.” They were lying, of course, heh-heh-heh. So we didn’t even take the test.\n\nOne day I went by the band room, and I heard a clarinet squeaking in there, SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK. So I just stuck my head in the door, like in the Navy, you know, “Who the fuck is making all that noise in there with that clarinet?” The bandmaster was in there giving somebody a lesson. He said, “Oh, you think you can do better?” I said, “Yeah, give me that thing.” So he gave me the clarinet, and I ran it up. So he put up some music and I played it. I knew it anyway. Then he put up some hard music. I played that, too. He said, “You’re the best clarinet player around here. Do you play saxophone, too?” I said, “Yeah.” [LAUGHS] I hadn’t touched the saxophone! But what he did, he gave me a clarinet, which then was like an Army issue. Everything was metal. The clarinet was metal and the saxophone was metal. He gave me and said, “Take that back to the barracks, and come back two weeks later.” So I took it back to the barracks and I started practicing. By the end of the two weeks, I could play the saxophone, enough to read the music.\n\nI woke up one morning, they had a sign up there that said, “Donaldson, report to the band.” Man, these other cats were looking sad! So as I was making my bags I’d walk by where they were, and I’d say, “You jive…” Neither one of them got in the band. Neither one of them. I told my friend, Foster, and he went down there and auditioned and he got in right away, because he could play trumpet and piano—he was an excellent musician. That’s how is started paying saxophone?\n\nPanken: Were you drafted in 1944 or 1945?\n\nDonaldson: 1945.\n\nPanken: Ok. I’d read 1944 somewhere. There were a lot of musicians who were legitimate musicians at Great Lakes.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah.\n\nPanken: Some of the names I have are Willie Smith, great alto player.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: Clark Terry.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, right.\n\nPanken: Ernie Wilkins.\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: Major Holley.\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: Jimmy Nottingham.\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: Wendell Culley.\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: Luther Henderson.\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: Talk a bit about how the band were set up, the types of things they played, the functions they played.\n\nDonaldson: What they did, after they broke down the bands, they had about ten bands. Now, these guys you’re talking about were a little older than me. They played in a band they called the A-band. Then they had another band. The guys were a little older. The B band. I was in the C band, because I was 18, and most of the guys in the band where I was were 18 years old. We were young people. But at the end of all the rehearsals and everything during the day, they’d have jam sessions, so we’d go and sneak on in, and play with the big boys…\n\n[END OF June 20th, PART 1, TRACK 1]\n\n[BEGINNING OF June 20th, PART 1, TRACK 2]\n\nDonaldson: It was great. A great set-up.\n\nPanken: What sorts of things were they playing then?\n\nDonaldson: Whatever was happening during that day. “Take The A Train,” “Satin Doll,” stuff like that. “Stompin’ at the Savoy.” A lot of stuff.\n\nPanken: I also read that you had some leaves in Chicago, and you saw Charlie Parker for the first time in Chicago with Billy Eckstine.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, with Billy Eckstine.\n\nPanken: Did you spend much time in Chicago, or did you go in every…\n\nDonaldson: I went in there every… Well, Chicago is not but 40 miles from Waukegan.\n\nPanken: So talk a bit about that scene, and the places you went.\n\nDonaldson: Well, I went in Chicago every weekend. I’d go down to the Crown Propellor and see Pete Brown. Pete Brown was down there. I’d go to another place to see a Dixieland band. I can’t remember the band right now, the names of them… Then I’d go down to the DeLisa Club. There was a guy named Red Saunders.\n\nPanken: He had the big band there. A drummer.\n\nDonaldson: That’s right. It was at 55th Street and State. Black people couldn’t go past there. You go past there… They’d shoot a black cat if he went past there. That was the end of the line. But they had a great show and a great band. Chicago was great.\n\nBut I went down there because the guys in the Navy had been telling me about Charlie Parker. I had never heard him, and I went down to see him in Billy Eckstine’s Band. When I saw him, it was very depressing, because he looked like he hadn’t had a bath in years, and his suit was hanging. I said, “Is that him?” But once he started playing, it was a different situation. I never heard anything like that. I said, “Man, what the hell is he doing?” Boy, he was PLAYING some saxophone.\n\nPanken: I’ve also heard that he was an extraordinary lead alto player? That he made the section phrase like him…\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah.\n\nPanken: Do you have any recollection of that?\n\nDonaldson: No, I don’t have any recollection of that. Because the night I went down there, he was so high, he couldn’t play the lead. Budd Johnson had switched from tenor to alto, and he was playing the head in the band the night I saw him.\n\nPanken: Was Gene Ammons in Eckstine’s band then?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, Gene Ammons and Dexter Gordon. A lot of people were in there.\n\nPanken: By this time, were you listening more regularly to records…\n\nDonaldson: Well, they didn’t have many records. They had but one or two records, “Jumpin’ The Blues” by Jay McShann…\n\nPanken: But in general, not just…\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. I’d listen to anything that I figured was jazz. But I wasn’t a record addict, because I didn’t really want to hear anything but what he was playing, and once I heard him…\n\nPanken: So based on “The Jumpin’ Blues” by Charlie Parker with McShann, it changed your…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, that changed everything. Not me. Everybody.\n\nPanken: Talk about how it changed you. What did it do?\n\nDonaldson: Well, it made me want to pursue music as a profession. Because actually, when I went to college, as I told you, I was an honor roll—I was planning to go on to probably pre law school or something. My parents wanted me to do something else. Because I was asthmatic, and they figured that playing a horn is the latest thing they’d want you to do. But they were wrong, because playing the horn actually made me survive. The diaphragm, breathing, and stuff like that; it made my lungs much stronger than weaker. That’s what it made for me.\n\nPanken: Listening to you now, it’s obvious how influential Charlie Parker was, but you’ve also talked about listening to a lot of alto saxophonists who were active then…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I heard them.\n\nPanken: Eddie Vinson.\n\nDonaldson: That’s right.\n\nPanken: Tab Smith.\n\nDonaldson: Right. Louis Jordan.\n\nPanken: Earl Bostic.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, Earl Bostic.\n\nPanken: Talk about those people, and how you assimilated…\n\nDonaldson: Well, those people were so great. Every one of those people had a different style. See, not like it is today when everybody plays the same way. But back then, they had a different style. Earl Bostic was the greatest technician I’ve ever heard on a saxophone. He could play three octaves. I eventually got to talk to him, and he told me what mouthpiece I should use, and reed, and I’ve been using them ever 1957.\n\nPanken: What kind of those?\n\nDonaldson: Meyer #6 mouthpiece, #2½ reed. Now I’m down to 1½ because old age has caught up with me, so…\n\n[END OF June 20th, PART 1, TRACK 2]\n\n[BEGINNING OF June 20th, PART 1, TRACK 3]\n\nPanken: We just took a short break, and Lou found a sheet of paper with information that perhaps can supplement some of the things we’ve spoken about. What have you got?\n\nDonaldson: Not what you want. This is not it\n\nPanken: Well, you know what we can do? Perhaps we can find it and go over that material tomorrow, and interpolate that later.\n\nDonaldson: yes, this is another thing here. It’s a family reunion schedule of all my people. But anyway, it was Livingstone College. That’s the name of the college that my father went to.\n\nPanken: We were just discussing alto saxophonists. You mentioned Earl Bostic. But could you talk a bit about each of the people I mentioned, and how they affected you? Let’s say, Eddie “Cleanhead” Vinson.\n\nDonaldson: Well, Eddie “Cleanhead” Vinson affected me because he was a good blues player. That’s the way I play, you know. I used to see him all the time in Cootie Williams’ band. He was great in Cootie Williams’ band. Then he started doing solo, and I got to see him. He sang a little bit, too, which I’m doing now.\n\nPanken: You’ve been doing that for 20 years or so.\n\nDonaldson: Yes. Eddie was a good songwriter, too. He wrote a couple of songs that Miles stole and put his name on.\n\nPanken: “Four” was one of them, right?\n\nDonaldson: “Four.” Ha-ha. You know about it, yeah.\n\nPanken: “Tune-Up” maybe?\n\nDonaldson: “Tune-Up,” yup. Yeah, you know about it. That’s what was happening back then. It’s a different world.\n\nPanken: So you did see Cootie Williams coming through…\n\nDonaldson: Greensboro.\n\nPanken: This was once you got back from the Army.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. From the Navy.\n\nPanken: But when you were there, were you checking Johnny Hodges and Benny Carter\n\nDonaldson: Right. I used to play all of Johnny Hodges’ solos. Benny Carter came through and wrote an arrangement for our college band. We played that. There were some nice cats. Tab Smith came through. At that time, Tab was playing with Count Basie’s band. But he was from Wilson, North Carolina, so he was a North Carolinian.\n\nPanken: When were you discharged from the Navy?\n\nDonaldson: I don’t know…it was the summer of ‘45.\n\nPanken: So you were only in for a few months.\n\nDonaldson: 11 months, yes.\n\nPanken: So you went back to Greensboro after that?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I went back to A&T. A&T College.\n\nPanken: At this point, were you starting to be a professional musician?\n\nDonaldson: No, not at that point. When I went back, it was the middle of the semester, and I didn’t stay on the campus. I had to get me a room out in the town. I was still making up some courses that I had lost during those 11 months. After I got the courses made up, I started actually to play a little commercial music in a club called the Mombassa Club. The guy I told you about, Billy Tolles, he had the band. Nipsey Russell was the comedian. First job Nipsey ever played. Nipsey was a Lieutenant in the Army, and he was a very smart guy, as you know, if you watch him on TV. He came to Greensboro, and settled, and started working as an emcee in this club.\n\nPanken: The spelling?\n\nDonaldson: M-o-m-b-a-s-s-a.\n\nPanken: Did I read somewhere that Ellington came through?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, Ellington came down there. He came down to the club, and brought all the musicians. We met them, talked to them. Russell Procope…\n\nPanken: The band played an engagement there?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, they played a dance.\n\nPanken: What was it like hearing the Ellington band?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, it was great. It was much different than the other bands. Ellington actually had a different type of band. But I had heard about all the guys and read about them, so I just wanted to see them—like Taft Jordan and Cootie Williams, then he brought Jimmy Hamilton in… He had a great band. Russell Procope. It was a great band.\n\nPanken: What other bands came through Greensboro?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, man, all of them came through there. Jay McShann. Andy Kirk. Erskine Hawkins. Lionel Hampton, of course. Illinois Jacquet, of course. Illinois Jacquet, of course. Louis Jordan. Several other bands—I can’t think of all of them.\n\nPanken: So this was all during that year or two after you were discharged from the Navy.\n\nDonaldson: Right. From the Navy. Right.\n\nPanken: They were all coming through Greensboro on their southern tours.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. They had 60 one-nighters from New York to Florida.\n\nPanken: Who did? Each of the different bands…\n\nDonaldson: No, it was a tour down there they called the Weinberg Tour. A guy named Weinberg used to book them. He bought all the dance halls from New York to Florida, and he’d send the bands down there, and they played. Dizzy’s band came through there.\n\nPanken: What did the Mombassa Club look like? How was it set up?\n\nDonaldson: Ah, just a club. Kind of dark in there. It was an exotic looking club. Heh-heh. For the South.\n\nPanken: Did you get something different from all these bands? Did you like all of them? Did you have favorites?\n\nDonaldson: I liked all of them. I used to go to see all the bands. Because, see, we were in college, and we could go down and get in the dance hall before the customers got in there. They let us in there because they knew us, and we’d meet the musicians and talk to them. A funny story I had, I went down there, and… Luis Russell came through there. I went down there, and I saw this young kid back there setting up the drums. I said, “Oh, that must be Luis Russell’s son.” He set up the drums and everything, and started playing a little bit on them. I said, “Oh yeah, he can play a little drums, too.” Then eventually, all the band members came. And he went and put on a coat, just like the band members. I said, “Oh, he got a coat, too.” I never knew who he was. So finally, Luis Russell came in, and the kid was playing. I said, “Why is he playing? The drummer didn’t come?” The guy said, “He is the drummer.” I said, “What is his name?” “Roy Haynes.” Roy Haynes. Roy told me he was about 17 years old then. Every time I see him, he cracks up.\n\nPanken: Any other good anecdotes about the bands? Memorable experiences seeing them…\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. When I came back from the Navy, they had an Army base in Greensboro, the O.R.D., Overseas Replacement Depot. I was back at the cottage, and the guys from the Army band used to come over and play with the other band. They hadn’t seen me. Then I came back, and I’m playing bebop. I’m not playing like the guys around Greensboro. The guy said, “Who is this guy? Is this guy from New York?” They said, “No, he’s from here.” They said, “Oh, no, he can’t be from here playing like that.” But see, I had been in the Navy. When I found out who was there—James Moody, Dave Burns, a saxophone player named Joe Gale, Linton Garner (Errroll’s brother), Walter Fuller (Dizzy’s arranger), all of them were right in that band. It was a great band, and then I started going, playing with them. I got to meet them, play with them. It was nice.\n\nPanken: Talk about how for you the Ellington band was different.\n\nDonaldson: Well, they had Harry Carney. Anybody with Harry Carney, the saxophone section is going to sound different, because he was a great, GREAT baritone player. Big sound and everything. And Johnny Hodges, the way he played. It was a special band. You couldn’t… Duke had picked them just right. He wrote his arrangements very compatible with the guys who were playing them. Ray Nance run out with his trumpet… It was a different kind of band. It wasn’t just a jazz band. See, critics got carried away hollering about a jazz band, but they played a whole lot more stuff than jazz.\n\nPanken: You’ve been talking each of the alto saxophone players you liked—and I suppose on tenor and baritone, too—all having an individual sound, a stamp…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, they played different.\n\nPanken: An “I.D.,” you’ve called it before.\n\nDonaldson: All of them played their I.D. Right. They had their I.D.\n\nPanken: How did that start to develop for you? Was it something you were consciously striving for?\n\nDonaldson: No, not really.\n\nPanken: Was it something that happened as a result…\n\nDonaldson: Not really. I wanted to play nothing but bebop. That’s all I wanted to play. But after I got married and had two daughters going to college, and I’m trying to pay our house mortgage, I had to play some other type of gigs. So I had to kind of temper my music to the people I was playing for. A lot of people said, “Oh, you’re not playing jazz no more.” But I was playing exactly what I had to play to keep those jobs.\n\nPanken: I want to talk about that. But what I’m trying to focus on now are these developmental years, before you get married, before you move to New York, when you’re still in North Carolina.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I didn’t…\n\nPanken: Were you think about that sort of individuality at the time?\n\nDonaldson: No, nothing but bebop back then. I wasn’t thinking about nothing individual.\n\nPanken: Was learning bebop a matter of getting all the Charlie Parker records and learning the solos…\n\nDonaldson: That’s right. Learning the solos and learning the standards that they came from. Most of those tunes came from standards. They just put another figure on the chords, and that’s how they played them. In fact, I wrote a thesis down there at North Carolina A&T, for my graduation thesis, and they took it and book-binded it and made it a book, and now all the students who go through the college have to study my book.\n\nPanken: What’s the name of the thesis?\n\nDonaldson: The Transition From Swing To Bebop.\n\nPanken: Is that right?\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: Is it a musicological analysis?\n\nDonaldson: Oh yeah. I got illustrations and chords, broke down the chords and everything. 1947.\n\nPanken: So you were extremely analytical.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. And critical. Analytical and critical. So I was in good shape.\n\nPanken: I gather that you made your first visit to New York in 1948?\n\nDonaldson: 1947. ‘47…or ‘48.\n\nPanken: Whatever the case, let’s talk about that experience.\n\nDonaldson: Well, what happened, our band came to play halftime at the New York Giants’ game.\n\nPanken: Ah, the North Carolina A&T…\n\nDonaldson: The North Carolina A&T band, One of our players, a guy named Stonewall Jackson [Robert ‘Stonewall’ Jackson] , was signed by the Giants, and we came up and played the halftime ceremonies.\n\nPanken: So he would have been one of the first African-American NFL players.\n\nDonaldson: That’s right. I got to meet all the guys. Frank Gifford. Emlen Tunnell was there. He was (?—13:17). But it was great. Then I went down to 52nd Street, of course, because I had been reading about it. We had a shortwave radio. We could pick up music from New York once in a while. It faded out, but you could pick it up. Bands from New York. Like, when they had the Benny Goodman Hour, the Chesterfield, and Harry James… We could pick up those bands, and we could hear that on shortwave down in North Carolina. And when we were there, I went over down to 52nd Street, and went to see Dizzy and… It was supposed to be Charlie Parker, Sid Catlett and them, but Charlie Parker wasn’t there as usual, you know, and they had this little short guy playing saxophone. Ray Brown was in the band. So I asked Ray, “Ray, who is that guy? He sounds almost as good as Charlie Parker.” Ray said, “He sounds better than Charlie Parker.” I said, “Oh, yeah? What’s his name?” He said, “Don Byas.” And sure enough, I went back the next night to hear the band, and the band sounded much better with Don Byas than it did with Charlie Parker. Because Charlie was all messed-up and couldn’t half-play, but Don Byas was great. He was great.\n\nPanken: Had you known about him before? Had you heard the records he did with Dizzy?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I knew about him.\n\nPanken: I think “Anthropology” was one of them…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I knew about him. And he made this record with Slam Stewart, Slam Stewart and Don Byas, just two instruments. He was great. He was a great player.\n\nPanken: What else did you do that first visit to New York?\n\nDonaldson: I went by the Onyx Club, too, to see my favorites. And very depressing. Heh-heh. The Onyx Club. That was on 52nd Street, too. They had J.J. and Sonny Stitt, Bud Powell, Miles, and every one of them was all messed up. It was terrible. Very depressing.\n\nPanken: Were they playing well?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah, they played good, but I said, “Man, I can’t… I don’t think I can handle this.”\n\nPanken: So this discouraged any ideas you might have had about coming up to New York right away…\n\nDonaldson: I mean, and playing with them. It didn’t discourage me about coming to New York. But playing in that scene, I couldn’t do that, because it was too hazardous.\n\nPanken: Did you check out the scene in Harlem the first time you went to New York?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I came to Harlem, I went through Harlem. I saw the scenes. I saw the scenes in Harlem.\n\nPanken: Was it overwhelming to be in New York?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. It was overwhelming to be in New York. You got to see all the musicians. It was great. I went to the Baby Grand. By that time, Nipsey had moved to New York, and he brought me around to the Baby Grand. I got to meet all the musicians. It was great.\n\nPanken: Who’d you meet?\n\nDonaldson: Well, I met everybody who was playing in there. A guy named…I can’t think of his name…a bass player… It was a long time. But then I went on down the street, and I met other people, like Percy France, and I met another guy down there… Lockjaw was in Minton’s. Big Nick was over at the Paradise, and Willis Jackson was in Smalls. So I got to see all of those guys.\n\nPanken: That was a heady visit. A great preparation.\n\nDonaldson: A great visit. I couldn’t keep myself away from New York then.\n\nPanken: Well, it must have let you know that you belonged here, or that you’d be able to deal with the scene when you got here. It must have been a very good gauge for your own progress.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, because the bands used to come through North Carolina, and I used to sit in with the bands. Like Dizzy and Illinois Jacquet, all of them used to say, “Man, what you doing down here? You should be in New York.” I said, “Well, I don’t know about that.” They’d say, “You need to be in New York, man. You’re wasting time down here.” So finally I just decided to come on to New York. So I came over to New York.\n\nPanken: Before we bring you here permanently, you played semipro baseball for a couple of years.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I played down there. Played baseball.\n\nPanken: You were a third baseman?\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: What sort of player were you?\n\nDonaldson: I was the best. Nobody better.\n\nPanken: Nobody better at third base, or nobody better…\n\nDonaldson: Nobody better. Nobody better. If black people had been able to get into the majors then, I’d have been somewhere. Or maybe in the minors. I don’t know if I could have made the majors.\n\nPanken: So you were the best in North Carolina…\n\nDonaldson: Well, I was one of the best. We had some good players, but I was one of the best. I could have easily made it. I was a player sort of like Eddie Stanky. That kind of player.\n\nPanken: Scrappy player.\n\nDonaldson: Scrappy. I could bunt.\n\nPanken: Contact hitters. All the fundamentals. Intelligent.\n\nDonaldson: I could bunt. You couldn’t strike me out. They called me “Deadeye,” because they couldn’t strike me out. In fact, I’d be in school, and somebody would be pitching a no-hitter out on the ball-field, and they’d come and get me out of the room, to go out and break it up. I was tough! And I had a glove, man. I could wipe up a ball.\n\nPanken: You had good hands.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, man, I could wipe up a ball. I used to be the mascot for the senior team when I was a little kid, and after they did it, I’d take infield practice with them, and then they’d bet dollars that the guys couldn’t hit a ball past me. They’d try to hit a ball past me. They couldn’t get it past me. Anything I could reach, I got.\n\nPanken: Eddie Stanky was a winning ballplayer, that’s for sure. His teams won.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. He was a nuisance.\n\nPanken: Is that how you would describe yourself?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, sort of like that. Sort of like that.\n\nPanken: So the fall of 1945, you come back to Greensboro from the Navy, and you get your degree from North Carolina AT&T. You’re playing semi-pro baseball. I think I read that you broke a pinky, and that ended your career…\n\nDonaldson: Well, it didn’t end my career. I just stopped playing, because I couldn’t play my clarinet once it puffed up.\n\nPanken: You’re continuing to develop your facility and artistry on your instrument, and you’re getting validation from people like Dizzy Gillespie and the cats in his band…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: …and people like Illinois Jacquet…\n\nDonaldson: Jacquet, right.\n\nPanken: …and they’re telling you to come to New York—and you spend some time in New York. So finally, in 1950, was it…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: You make the move. Talk about the circumstances. I gather that you followed your future wife, who moved here.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, I followed my future wife. Because she came up as like a work-in maid or whatever it was. You know, they used to get girls from the South, bring them to New York, and they’d work. She came up here, then I said, “Well, I got to go,” and I came on up. I had a good set-up, because I didn’t have to do any work, because I was a G.I. So I went to the Darrow Institute of Music.\n\nPanken: On the G.I. Bill?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, on the G.I. Bill.\n\nPanken: Where was Darrow Institute of Music?\n\nDonaldson: 58th-59th and Broadway.\n\nPanken: What sort of school was it?\n\nDonaldson: You know, a music school. A lot of musicians. Right next to it was the Hartnett Studio, and they had big bands all day, so I could go over and sit in the section and practice.\n\nPanken: At this point, you’re playing primarily alto saxophone?\n\nDonaldson: Alto saxophone.\n\nPanken: Clarinet is a doubling instrument by now.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, doubling. I was about to throw that away.\n\nPanken: So you’re a full-fledged alto saxophonist.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, alto saxophone.\n\nPanken: By the way, what your late wife’s name?\n\nDonaldson: Maker. Maker Donaldson.\n\nPanken: Talk a bit about getting settled in New York, and acclimated to New York. Where did you live when you came here?\n\nDonaldson: I lived with my brother-in-law, ex-brother-in-law. He had an apartment up on St. Nicholas Avenue and 155th Street. So I didn’t have to pay any rent.\n\nPanken: Near the Polo Grounds.\n\nDonaldson: Right across from the Polo Grounds. I used to go out and stand on the bridge out there with binoculars and see the whole game. I couldn’t see the catcher and the batter, but I could see the pitcher and everything. When they hit a ball, you could tell where it was going by where the outfielders went. Eventually, I got enough money to start going to the Polo Grounds. $1.75 for the bleachers. One day I was sitting out there, and I see this big fat cat come up, weighed about 400 pounds. He sat by me and said, “Yeah, Lou, what you doing out here?” It’s Bob Weinstock. I said, “Man! What you doing out here in the bleachers?” He said, “I can see the game better from here.” He was right, because we were sitting out there in 1951 when Bobby Thompson hit that home run. In the Polo Grounds, seat 7… The game started about 1 p.m., so it was about 4:30, and there always was a haze over the stadium. He hit the ball, and we couldn’t see where it went, but we saw all the people jump up in that Section 21, and once we saw the people jump up in Section 21, Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese turned their heads down and started walking back towards the outfield, because that’s where we were, sitting right out there…\n\nPanken: The dressing rooms were in center field, by the bleachers.\n\nDonaldson: Right by the bleachers. They started walking back. So we knew the game was over. Eddie Stanky runs down and jumps up in Leo Durocher’s arms. Leo was coaching third base that day. So I got to see all of that.\n\nPanken: By then, you’d been in New York about a year and a half.\n\nDonaldson: Two or three years.\n\nPanken: Well, if you got there in 1950, and his was 1951…\n\nDonaldson: Seemed like I’d been there longer.\n\nPanken: So you’re going to music school, and I assume that you start to make the rounds and establish contacts.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. Right.\n\nPanken: Let’s go into some detail about that. Who some of the first people were that you played with, and…\n\nDonaldson: Well, the funniest thing about it, when I got there and I got to playing, and the guys said, “Yeah, man, you play good, but you’d better get a tenor, because alto players can’t work in New York.” I said, “Oh, no?” So one night I took my alto, I went around to every club on ‘25th Street and down on ‘16th Street, and I sat in with all the bands, and I came back the next day and I was laughing. They said, “Why are you laughing?” I said, “I don’t know whether it’s alto or tenor, but any job there I can get, because the guys there can’t play anything.”\n\nPanken: Why did you say that?\n\nDonaldson: Well, that’s just the way they talked. “You’ve got to play tenor.” Because then, see, everybody was walking the bar, playing “Flying Home” and stuff like that. But I got to working with a club where they had singers.\n\nPanken: Which club was that?\n\nDonaldson: The Top Club, and some gigs at the Baby Grand, and some gigs at Smalls Paradise. They used to have entertainers. I got to playing in these clubs, and eventually I got to working with Dud Bascomb’s band, the trumpet player with Erskine Hawkins. He got a band, and we started working out in New Jersey, not too far from the prison out there, at a place called the Chicken Shack.\n\nPanken: In Jersey.\n\nDonaldson: In Jersey. That was my regular gig, I could play that, but I could take off any time I wanted to if I got another gig. I was set up pretty good.\n\nPanken: So you were interested in bebop, but on these gigs you weren’t playing bebop.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I played bebop when I took a solo. I played the music, but I played bebop when I took a solo.\n\nPanken: Who were some of the singers you played behind in those clubs?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, man, I played with great singers. A woman named Lady Hallocue [PHONETIC] [spelling?—26:46] She could sing. She had some weird songs. You really had to be up on your p’s and q’s. I played with a female impersonator, a guy named Phil Black. Best-looking man I ever saw in my life! He put on his dresses… He had the best clothes. I’ve never seen a woman with clothes that good! Every night, somebody was hugging and kissing him, and trying to take him home with them! That was good. It was good down there.\n\nBut it was good. I played behind Johnny Hartman. And Arthur Prysock. There were a lot of good singers around.\n\nPanken: So these clubs all had shows still at the time.\n\nDonaldson: They had shows.\n\nPanken: They had, like, a little chorus line maybe?\n\nDonaldson: Well, not a chorus line. They’d have one woman who was supposed to be an interpretive dancer, but she was…\n\nPanken: Shake dancer?\n\nDonaldson: …nothing but a strip. She wasn’t nothin’ but a striptease dancer.\n\nPanken: Exotic dancer, as they might say.\n\nDonaldson: That’s right. But she wasn’t no interpretive… Didn’t interpret nothin’ but stripping off them clothes. But that was good. See, the only thing about that, you didn’t get to play but one song. You’d bring on the show with the one song, and from then on you’re playing background.\n\nPanken: So there’d be a dancer, there’d be a singer, there’d be a comedian…\n\nDonaldson: A comedian, right.\n\nPanken: One instrumental act?\n\nDonaldson: Or one instrumental tune. The rest of them would be backup until you played the closing song.\n\nPanken: How big was the band?\n\nDonaldson: Usually three or four pieces.\n\nPanken: So who were you playing with? Were you the leader by this time?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, no, I wasn’t the leader of a lot of the bands. I played with a lot of bands. A lot of bands. I played with a guy named Charlie Singleton. He made a lot of background records for singers, and I got that, too. That was a little extra money. It was great.\n\nPanken: So no wonder you were learning all the tunes, had so many tunes in your bag.\n\nDonaldson: I knew all the tunes. Knew all the music, all the tunes, and I was just assimilating them and cataloguing them.\n\nPanken: So this is what you’re doing in 1950 and 1951… How long did you go to Darrow Institute?\n\nDonaldson: I went there until I guess about ‘52.\n\nPanken: ‘52 happens to be the year that you start your long relationship with Blue Note Records and make your first sessions with Blue Note? But before we get there, I have just a couple of other questions. Did you ever play in any territory bands?\n\nDonaldson: Unh-uh.\n\nPanken: Was Dud Bascomb’s band a big band?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, we went out. We played…\n\nPanken: So you did play in some big bands?\n\nDonaldson: Yes, right.\n\nPanken: Was that a good experience, playing in big bands?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. Good bands.\n\nPanken: Talk about why.\n\nDonaldson: Well, because you got to travel. You got to go to towns. You got to see people.\n\nPanken: And they got to see you, I guess.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. And you got to know the grinds of music. Because there was a certain grind you have to really go through before you get indoctrinated into the music business. Because, see, the bandleaders are always… I worked with Lionel Hampton for a while. The bandleaders always drive off to the Hilton Hotel, and stop the bus. Then you had to get out, and we had to walk down the street and find a Y, because they wasn’t payin’ no money, so we had to get the YMCA, $2 or $3 a night room. We didn’t make any money.\n\nPanken: Were there boarding houses, too? Did you stay in people’s private houses?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, boarding houses.\n\nPanken: How did that work? Did they differ in quality, where some were nice, some weren’t nice?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. Some were nice and some weren’t nice.\n\nPanken: They’d feed you breakfast?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, most of them would feed you breakfast.\n\nPanken: If you don’t mind my asking just a few other things about Harlem, circa 1950-51? Were there restaurants where musicians liked to eat after the gig?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: What were some of those restaurants.\n\nDonaldson: Well, the only place I ate was the Sheffield Café. That was on 126th and 8th Avenue. But most of the musicians used to go up to Wells, and have chicken-and-waffles. Wells Café. That was a famous restaurant.\n\nPanken: What sort of food did they have at the Sheffield Café?\n\nDonaldson: Well, they had breakfast food. Bacon, eggs, grits, biscuits.\n\nPanken: So breakfast after the gig.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. $1.25. That’s all you had to pay.\n\nPanken: What was the schedule like at the clubs? 10 to 5?\n\nDonaldson: 10 to 4 a.m. in New York and about 10 to 5 in Brooklyn.\n\nPanken: How many sets would that be?\n\nDonaldson: Well, what would happen was this. We’d hit at 10. We’d play 2 or 3 sets, and then we’d try to stretch it. But eventually, what would happen, about 3 or 4 o’clock, the pimps would come in with their women. They’d got the money. They’d come in and set up the bar, and the man said, “Well, they set up the bar; you’ve got to play a little extra.” So we ended up playing til 5 o’clock.\n\nPanken: Would they tip?\n\nDonaldson: Joe Louis would come in there, and then everybody’d see him and then run to Joe, and Joe, you know how he was: “Give everybody a drink!” So the man said, “You’ve got to play a little set for Joe.”\n\nPanken: So you were playing for a full spectrum of society.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah.\n\nPanken: Who would be there earlier in the night, and how would it…\n\nDonaldson: Oh, they had all kind of people coming in there. It’s hard to say now. I knew all of them. Adam Clayton Powell…\n\nPanken: This is Smalls you’re talking about?\n\nDonaldson: No, this is Minton’s. Malcolm X used to stick his head in the door, but he didn’t come in there. The big gangsters, Bumpy Johnson, all those people, they used to come in. Another guy named Red Dillon. He was… Phew! Dangerous man. But he used to come in there. See, they had a cook in there named Adele, and everybody loved her cooking.\n\nPanken: This was at Minton’s.\n\nDonaldson: At Minton’s. So they’d come in and eat.\n\nPanken: What were her specialties?\n\nDonaldson: Fish and chicken. She could cook. She was a good cook.\n\nPanken: Were meals on the house, or did you have to pay for them?\n\nDonaldson: No, we had to pay for them! Wasn’t no meals on the house.\n\nPanken: I’m actually surprised. Don’t know why, but…\n\nDonaldson: No meals on the house then.\n\nPanken: Another question. As a musician, you had to be sharp. You had to dress well. Were there particular tailors that the musicians went to, that you went to?\n\nDonaldson: No. I’d be working at Minton’s, and the boosters would come by.\n\nPanken: Oh, I see. Off the rack from the…\n\nDonaldson: They’d come by and look at you. “42-short.” Every time, I’d know what they’re going to say. He’d pull out a nice one. I’d say, “Oh, yeah, I like that.” He said, “Yeah? Well, $100.” They always do that. But I say, “All right. I’ll talk to you later.” But I’d wait until the end of the night, and when I see him on the corner he’s still got that suit. [LAUGHS] I said, “Man, here’s $25—give me that suit!] [LOUD LAUGH] And he gave me the suit. I saw a guy… One night, a guy had a brand-new cello. I don’t know where he stole it. He must have gone down to the Philharmonic or somewhere. He was outside the door. When I came out, he said, “Hey, Lou, here’s a cello.” I looked at it and I said, “Man, where did you get that cello from?” He said, “Man, don’t worry about that. $700.” I said, “Man, here. I got $75. Give me that cello. Because the police are going to come down here and ask you to play it, and you’re…” [DISSOLVES WITH LAUGHTER] If I’m taking it, they won’t say nothing to me, because they know I’m a musician, but you walking around the street with that cello…” I took it and gave it to my daughter. My daughter played cello.\n\nPanken: But this is probably a little later in the ‘50s. Earlier in the ‘50s, who was your contact person to bring you into Blue Note?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, nobody. They came up… Alfred Lion came up to Minton’s. He might have had Ike Quebec with him.\n\nPanken: I thought Ike Quebec was his talent scout.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, but that was later on. But then, I don’t really know whether Ike was with him or not. But he came up to me and said, “Oh, do you want to record for Blue Note?” Well, you know I’m going to tell him “yeah.” He said, “But you’ve got to play like Charlie Parker. Can you play like Charlie Parker?” I thought, “No, I can’t play like Charlie Parker, but I won’t tell him.” I said, “Yeah, I can play like Charlie Parker.” Heh-heh. And I got the date.\n\nPanken: But before you did that date, you made a sideman date with Milt Jackson and a very interesting date with Thelonious Monk, with three horns.\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: Do you have pretty thorough memories of those dates?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\n[END OF June 20th, PART 1, TRACK 1]\n\n[BEGIN, June 20th, PART 2, TRACK 1]\n\nPanken: Back from a quick break. We were just getting to Lou’s Blue Note recording with Milt Jackson on April 7, 1952. This was shortly after Alfred Lion approached you at Minton’s?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, shortly…\n\nPanken: Who was your band at Minton’s?\n\nDonaldson: I don’t know who I had then. I’m sorry. I can’t remember the musicians. But what happened, I knew this fighter, Art Woods…\n\nPanken: Oh, he used to work at Dayton’s Records on 12th and Broadway.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, he worked in a record shop. We used to train all the time. He’d come to me… There was a place called Newman’s Studio down there on 116th Street. After I’d practice… I’d give the guy 50 cents to practice, and I’d practice about an hour, then he’d bring his gloves and we’d work out.\n\nPanken: So you boxed, too.\n\nDonaldson: Oh yeah, I would box.\n\nPanken: What was your weight?\n\nDonaldson: Featherweight. I was a good boxer. What I wanted to do, in case somebody bothered me, I’d knock them out. But I didn’t have nothing to worry about, because all those guys were junkies. You know what I mean? They couldn’t fight.\n\nHe told me, “Lou, let me tell you something. You go around here, you show up to the gigs on time, and you wear your black suit with your black tie, and you don’t drink no liquor, you don’t have no tab—you ain’t gonna make it in this business.” I said, “What you talkin’ about?” He said, “Man, you got to go around and act like you’re high, and buy up some liquor. Even though you don’t drink it yourself, give it to somebody else.” Man, I took his solution, and I haven’t been out of a gig since!\n\nPanken: Is that right?\n\nDonaldson: I’m telling you! I meet people every day who tell me, “Lou, you sure look good since you straightened up.” I say, “Straightened up from what? I don’t even drink a small Miller beer.” [LAUGHS] “No, man, I know I used to see you down there with Bird; you’all was gettin’ high!” I said, “No, you didn’t see me down there with Bird.” I used to hang around with him, but I wasn’t doing what they were doing.\n\nPanken: Did you hang out with Charlie Parker at all? Did you get to know him?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I finally got to know him when I came to New York and stayed for a while, and I got to see him a lot.\n\nPanken: After 1950.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, after 1950.\n\nPanken: Did you talk to him? Did you spend time with him?\n\nDonaldson: Yes, a lot of time spent…\n\nPanken: Can you describe the relationship?\n\nDonaldson: Well, he was a brilliant guy. We talked about politics…and a lot of things. He was a smart guy. But he had that bad habit.\n\nPanken: Did he show that habit around you, or did he keep it from you?\n\nDonaldson: No, he didn’t show it too much around me.\n\nPanken: I gather that certain people he might not show it to at all. They might not even know that he got high, unless they’d know what to look for.\n\nDonaldson: Well, he knew I knew he got high, but he didn’t really exaggerate it around me.\n\nPanken: Do you recall the particulars of any of your conversations? Any one or two encounters that stand out?\n\nDonaldson: Not really. Because he was like the rest of the people who were drug addicts. They worked 24 hours a day to get money for the next hit. That was their daily procedure. A lot of times when I’d see him, I’d go to the other side of the street because…\n\nPanken: So you wouldn’t give him money.\n\nDonaldson: I didn’t have anything to give him.\n\nPanken: So part of your interaction was he would want to get a little money.\n\nDonaldson: Of course. Money was always… But he talked to me. We talked.\n\nPanken: Did you ever sit in with him?\n\nDonaldson: Mmm-hmm. What happened, one night in the Paradise I was there, and he came in, and I was sitting in with Big Nick Nicholas, and when Charlie Parker came in, there were about ten saxophone players on the stand, and all of them ran, you know, like a rattlesnake was coming in there. I was getting ready to get off the stand, too, and he said, “No, you play with me.” I said, “Man, I’m not playing with you.” He said, “Yeah. If you don’t play, I’m not going to play.” So the manager comes by and says, “Man, you’ve got to play now, because Bird says he’s not going to play if you don’t play.” I said, “Ok.” So we played a couple of tunes, “I Got Rhythm” or something. I played, and he leaned over to me and said, “Man, what was that you played on that thing? That was some nice stuff” It was stuff I had copied off one of his records. So I said to myself, “Is he pulling my leg, or is he really sincere?” That’s when I realized the guy was a genius. He didn’t really remember.\n\nPanken: You mean, he’d invented it, but he hadn’t memorized it.\n\nDonaldson: He couldn’t remember it.\n\nPanken: But you were analytical. You’d written a thesis about the musicological transition from swing to bebop.\n\nDonaldson: Right. The change to bebop. The change to the alternate chords.\n\nPanken: How did that work when you were improvised? Did you have set solos, were you…\n\nDonaldson: No, I didn’t have no set solos, but I had set chord changes. I’d change up the chords a little. Not really a set solo.\n\nPanken: Again, before Blue Note, did you ever… I think I read on a liner note for one of your recordings that you were in a session or two with Bud Powell.\n\nDonaldson: Mmm-hmm. Yeah.\n\nPanken: What was that like?\n\nDonaldson: It was nice. With Bud, you know… When I came to New York, Bud was going nuts, going bananas. He was hard to deal with.\n\nPanken: Were you on an actual gig with him?\n\nDonaldson: I played some gigs with him, yeah.\n\nPanken: His band?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: Where?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, all around town. A place called Bowman’s up on 155th and St. Nicholas Place, and another club up in there…I can’t think of it… But I played a few gigs with him.\n\nPanken: So you played his music.\n\nDonaldson: Some of it.\n\nPanken: What did you think of his tunes?\n\nDonaldson: I was crazy about them. Crazy about them. But he was bad with the money. Because he’d get the money, and by the time you got ready to get your pay, he’s gone.\n\nPanken: Let’s move to these early Blue Note sessions. So Alfred Lion approaches you at Minton’s, or maybe Ike Quebec, we’re not quite clear… But one way or the other, you go in the studio for the first time, at least as recorded in the discographies, on April 7, 1952, with Milt Jackson, John Lewis, Kenny Clarke, and…\n\nDonaldson: Percy Heath.\n\nPanken: Percy Heath on bass. What was that date like?\n\nDonaldson: It was nice. I didn’t particularly like John Lewis. But it was nice.\n\nPanken: Were you nervous to be in the studio?\n\nDonaldson: No.\n\nPanken: So by this time, you belong. You’re part of the thing.\n\nDonaldson: Right. I didn’t feel nervous at all.\n\nPanken: Any specific memories of the date?\n\nDonaldson: Not really. All I know is I liked Milt. Milt was a good friend of mine.\n\nPanken: The date with Monk, then. I’ve read a quote from you that you hadn’t worked with Monk before that; that you had to go in and basically read the music down…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, try to.\n\nPanken: Maybe there was a rehearsal before.\n\nDonaldson: Try to read it. He didn’t write it out like he wanted it played. You had to rehearse it a couple of times. But it ended up fine.\n\nPanken: There were a couple of tricky tunes on that session.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, sir.\n\nPanken: “Skippy” for one.\n\nDonaldson: “Skippy” is tough. “Carolina Moon” is tough. Tough tune.\n\nPanken: How did the session go? He’d present the tune, you’d run through it a few times, and then…\n\nDonaldson: And then we recorded it.\n\nPanken: How did he express his intentions? Would he be singing it to you?\n\nDonaldson: He played it on the piano, you know…\n\nPanken: Had you known Monk before that?\n\nDonaldson: Yes, I knew him.\n\nPanken: Because he spent a lot of time at Minton’s, I would think, among other places…\n\nDonaldson: Not at Minton’s. He was at Blue Note. Every time I went down there, Monk and his wife would be down there, at the company, down there in back of Bloomingdale’s. They’d be down there all the time.\n\nPanken: What was the office like?\n\nDonaldson: Wasn’t nothing but just a little place. Wasn’t really an office.\n\nPanken: Were you a fan of Monk’s compositions, of his music, his musicianship?\n\nDonaldson: Not really. I couldn’t use them on my job, because if I played them, I’d be fired. See, back then people hadn’t…they wasn’t compatible with Monk. It took a long time before they got compatible with Monk.\n\nPanken: How so?\n\nDonaldson: Well, they wouldn’t buy his records.\n\nPanken: Oh, you mean before people got used to his music and the sound of it.\n\nDonaldson: Yes. And the big companies wouldn’t record him. Like Capitol, Columbia, even Savoy—they wouldn’t record him.\n\nPanken: No, he was on Blue Note, then he went to Prestige…\n\nDonaldson: Prestige, right.\n\nPanken: …and then the Riverside things brought his name out… I guess this would be pushing to the future a bit. I read in one interview that you later on worked with Monk in a club with Kenny Dorham, Oscar Pettiford maybe…\n\nDonaldson: No, Oscar Pettiford was supposed to be there, but they brought Mingus in there. Max Roach on drums.\n\nPanken: Where was that?\n\nDonaldson: The Open Door. No, the Famous Door.\n\nPanken: I think it would be the Open Door. The Famous Door was long closed…\n\nDonaldson: Bob Reisner.\n\nPanken: Yeah, that’s the Open Door. Was it a different experience working with him for a week or two?\n\nDonaldson: Oh yeah, much different.\n\nPanken: Any memories of that?\n\nDonaldson: [LAUGHS] Only bad memories.\n\nPanken: Any bandstand memories? Anything positive you can say about the music…\n\nDonaldson: Well, what happened the first night, see, he was expecting Oscar Pettiford, and they brought Mingus in there, and he didn’t like Mingus, and he played ensembles, but he never took a solo. And about the second set, I was asking Kenny Dorham, I said, “when is he going to play?” He said, “He’s not. He don’t like Mingus.” I was a low guy on the totem pole. I didn’t have much to say either. So finally, Wilbur Ware staggers in there, and Bob Reisner takes him around the corner and gives him some vitamins…and he comes back. He don’t say nothin’; he just goes up and takes the bass from Mingus and started playing. Monk started to play.\n\nPanken: Well, he loved Wilbur Ware, yeah.\n\nDonaldson: Loved Wilbur Ware.\n\nPanken: I guess you did three 10-inch recordings…or two—one in 1952, one in 1954. The first one is with Horace Silver and Art Blakey and Blue Mitchell, and Gene Ramey.\n\nDonaldson: It wasn’t Art Blakey. Art Taylor. Gene Ramey.\n\nPanken: Were these guys you were working with?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, basically.\n\nPanken: How did the session get set up?\n\nDonaldson: I set it up myself. We just went down and played them.\n\nPanken: These are things you’d been playing?\n\nDonaldson: It wasn’t no great stretch to play them.\n\nPanken: Do you remember…were you working that week?\n\nDonaldson: I don’t think so.\n\nPanken: Tell me about Blue Mitchell. That was one of his very first recordings.\n\nDonaldson: Great trumpet player.\n\nPanken: How did you meet him?\n\nDonaldson: I met him…he was working with Lloyd Price’s band, and I heard him, and he sounded so beautiful. I said, “Man, I got to get you a date.” So he came on over to the Blue Note. See, a lot of people don’t know, I brought Horace over there, too.\n\nPanken: I was about to ask you.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I brought Horace. Horace was working…was practicing down at the studio where we used to go and train for boxing, Newman’s Studio down on ‘16th Street. I used to hear him playing piano. So one day I knocked on the door. I said, “Are you a piano player?” He said, “Yeah.” I said, “You want some gigs? Can you play a blues?” He said, “Yeah.” So I took him on a couple of gigs. He couldn’t play no blues. I said, “Man, you’re going to have to start playing blues.” Then I used to call him the “old Portuguese piano player.” I said, “Man, you got to go to Harlem and eat you some chitlin’s, some black-eyed peas and rice, and get some feeling.” [LAUGHS] So finally, he started playing kind of bluesy. And you know the rest. He made 15 hit records.\n\nPanken: So you met him in New York.\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: So you had Horace Silver and Blue Mitchell on the date. Had you been working with Arthur Taylor?\n\nDonaldson: Yes. Art Taylor. Gene Ramey.\n\nPanken: Well, that’s a helluva band to be working with. Were they with you at Minton’s?\n\nDonaldson: Actually, we had a band with Kenny Dorham, but Kenny got busted or something. He couldn’t make the date. We had a band with Kenny Dorham and Art Taylor and Gene Ramey.\n\nPanken: You were pretty close to Kenny Dorham.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. We had a band together.\n\nPanken: I guess you recorded a sextet thing in 1954. How did the relationship start?\n\nDonaldson: Well, it was just a matter that I had to do a record date, and I needed some musicians I thought could make it.\n\nPanken: Had you been playing with him before that?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I’d been playing with him a little.\n\nPanken: What kind of guy was he?\n\nDonaldson: Nice guy. Very nice guy. Very intelligent. But he had a lip problem, you know. Chops problem. But all of them did, Miles and all of them. Chops problem. I don’t know what it was. Probably they didn’t learn how to play correct. The best trumpet player around New York during those times was a guy named Idrees Sulieman. He could play better than any of those guys. But he knew he wasn’t going to get no gigs because all the promoters and all the club owners were Jewish, so he just packed up and went overseas.\n\nPanken: They didn’t want a guy with a Muslim name, an Islamic name.\n\nDonaldson: No. Muslim was out. Back then, the Muslims was out.\n\nPanken: I guess Sahib Shihab had that problem, too.\n\nDonaldson: Sahib Shihab, right.\n\nPanken: During the first part of the ‘50s, when you played New York, were you mostly playing in Harlem, or were you playing downtown?\n\nDonaldson: I was playing in Harlem.\n\nPanken: Was there a circuit in Harlem? Describe it a bit.\n\nDonaldson: Well, Harlem was a place where you had to play for the people 100% if you wanted a return engagement. You had to kind of do a little swing. So I got a chance to play at all these clubs. There was a woman around there named Hilda, and she worked… I guess she worked for the Mob—I guess. But she had the inside on all the clubs. So any time I wanted a job, I just called her. I got it right away.\n\nPanken: How many different clubs were you…\n\nDonaldson: About ten different clubs.\n\nPanken: So Smalls, Minton’s…\n\nDonaldson: Small places, too.\n\nPanken: If you don’t mind my asking, what would you make for a week in one of these clubs at the time?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, I don’t know. Not much. Maybe 125 bucks, something like that.\n\nPanken: That you’d clear, and then you’d pay the guys in your band what, $75 or something…\n\nDonaldson: Whatever they’d make. $50. Some of them didn’t make any money at all.\n\nPanken: You also did a very famous session for Blue Note with Elmo Hope and Clifford Brown in 1953.\n\nDonaldson: Mmm-hmm.\n\nPanken: In the past, you’ve stated, as everyone has, the most laudatory things about Clifford Brown. Had you known him before that session?\n\nDonaldson: No, not really. I was working with Elmo. Elmo worked in Dud Bascomb’s band, and I saw him every night—you know, when he showed up. I had heard about Clifford Brown. In fact, all the musicians knew about him. But, like, you know, Max and Art, they wasn’t going to bring him to New York, because they’re looking out for theirself, which is I guess…it’s what you do when you’re a junkie. You live from day to day, trying to cop. So it’s a disastrous situation, but that’s the way it is. I knew he was working with Chris Powell, Chris Powell and the Blue Flames, which was a funk group. So I saw he was working in the park down in Harlem, so I went down there to see him, and he wasn’t working, because he was playing piano—because he’d broken his shoulder or something. He was accident-prone. Every time I saw him, he’d had some kind of accident. I told him I wanted him to make this date with me because I’d heard he was a great trumpet player. So he took the trumpet and laid up on the fence, and held it. That’s the only way he could play it. We played, you know, “Confirmation,” two or three tunes. I said, “that’s all right; that’s good.” I said, “Now, as soon as your shoulder gets better, call me.” And when his shoulder got better, he called me. He made the date.\n\nPanken: Then the following year, the Live at Birdland date with Art Blakey. Had you been playing with Art Blakey for a while?\n\nDonaldson: No-no, no-no. I wouldn’t trust Art Blakey around the corner.\n\nPanken: How did… Sorry to ask so many details about so many gigs, but…\n\nDonaldson: What happened, the company wanted to do a date. Originally, there was Kenny Dorham, Gene Ramey, Art Taylor, Horace Silver, Lou Donaldson. You can tell by the material, Horace and I got all that material together. Art was in California. He’d got busted out there. He couldn’t even get back to New York. But what he did, he saw a bass player out there and told this bass player that if he drove him back to New York in his car, he was going to be his bass player. So I see him one day, and he stops on the street, and he says, “Yeah, Lou, I want you to meet my bass player.” I had to hide my head to keep from laughing. I said, “What the hell are you doing with a bass player with all these bass players in New York who aren’t working?”\n\nSo finally, Alfred Lion evidently… Evidently, Alfred Lion was giving him money to get him back to New York, and I go down there and Alfred said, “Well, Art is going to be on the date, and Curley Russell,” which was all right with me, because they could play. The second night after we hit, after Clifford Brown was such a sensation, people were going crazy. Art gets up on the microphone, “Yeah, I want to get these guys together, these young guys…” Me and Horace was looking at each other, saying, “What the hell was he talking about?” The company date was gone. Art Blakey had taken over the date. Alfred Lion was afraid of him, or else he owed Alfred so much money, he made him the leader where he’d get his money back. A lot of people think that was… And then he talked about the Messengers. That wasn’t no Messengers. Art Blakey had a band called the Messengers year before…\n\nPanken: That was a big band.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. Out in Brooklyn. Actually, Ray Copeland was working in that band. There was Art… Idrees Sulieman played trumpet in that band. Colbert Hopkins(?—23:26), Ray Abrams played saxophone… Sahib Shihab played baritone in that band, because Cecil Payne was the baritone player but he left and went on the road with Illinois Jacquet. And this guy, Howard Johnson, who played with Dizzy, played the lead, and the other boy, Ernie Henry, played the third alto. I saw the band. That was the Messengers. But the critics, see, they didn’t know. They said, “Oh, Art got the Messengers.” That was no Messengers band. Art was a con man.\n\nPanken: Great drummer, though.\n\nDonaldson: He was a great drummer—when he wanted to be. People ask me that all the time. I say, “Yeah, Art was great when he wanted to be.”\n\nPanken: What do you mean by that?\n\nDonaldson: Well, sometimes, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Art played so good you wanted to go back there and kiss him. But on the weekend, a lot of people came, especially if a woman comes up there and crosses her legs and pulls the dress up over her knees, the arrangement changed, everything changed…heh-heh. You got to know who the bandleader is, and you know ….(?—24:48)…. were drums. You’re supposed to play two choruses. You play one chorus, and you’d hear Art back there, “I got it, I got it, I got it.” [LAUGHS] He’d take over the… You had to let him have it, because he’d drop the tsunami on you back there! An earthquake. A volcanic eruption! I told him one night, “Art, man, you’re the greatest drummer in the world—sometimes.” And he just laughed. [LAUGHED] Any time a good-looking woman comes up there, she definitely has got to know who the bandleader is. She don’t have to ask no questions of nobody. She can tell right away who the leader is. Heh-heh…\n\nPanken: So that date was a week at Birdland.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah.\n\nPanken: It wasn’t a one-night thing.\n\nDonaldson: It was a week, a whole week.\n\nPanken: Was that the only time for that particular band, or did you do further engagements?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, that’s the only time.\n\nPanken: I read an interview in which you talked about the difference between bebop and hardbop, and presented that recording as a paradigm-setter for what hardbop was. There was a specific sense of the difference. Can you describe that?\n\nDonaldson: Well, that was hard bop. It was hard swinging. See, when you accelerate the energy and the sound, you’re playing hard bop. It’s hard to do that. And the way I play, if he upped the sound, you had to up your playing, and that made you press a little more, so you’re playing like hard bop.\n\nPanken: Was it a matter of volume or a matter of where the beat was being placed?\n\nDonaldson: Well, it’s the volume and the beat. Volume and the beat.\n\nPanken: What about the beat was different between bebop and hardbop?\n\nDonaldson: Well, it was louder. Art probably was high. He got too high, and in his ears he couldn’t hear how loud he was playing. Evidently. I don’t know. What can I tell you.\n\nPanken: Did you gig with Max Roach much?\n\nDonaldson: I did some gigs with him, yeah.\n\nPanken: Was he playing hard bop or bebop?\n\nDonaldson: He was playing more like bebop.\n\nPanken: Again, was that a matter of volume? He wasn’t playing as loud…\n\nDonaldson: And pressing. Press down. When you bear down, it’s a little different than when you just play. You can play, but then you bear down…when you bear down…\n\nPanken: Then, between swing and bebop, is it a rhythmic difference, a harmonic difference…\n\nDonaldson: It’s a harmonic difference between that, and swing is steadier, a steadier rhythm, like the Count Basie mode.\n\nPanken: Like, say, the way Papa Jo Jones played vis-a-vis the way Max Roach played with displacements and so on.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, of course.\n\nPanken: So by 1954, when you’re making these dates, you’ve been primarily a leader for a couple of years, but you’re doing some sessions with other people. And you took a couple of years hiatus from recording, say from mid-1954 until early 1957, when you do the first in a long series of recordings for Blue Note, plus things with Jimmy Smith.\n\nDonaldson: Mmm-hmm.\n\nPanken: Can you describe what you were doing during those years?\n\nDonaldson: I really shouldn’t tell you this, because I’m going to put it in my book. I got mad at Blue Note Records. Angry. Because I went out to do a session one time at Rudy’s house, and we played a couple of tunes, and then some guy came by with some vitamins, and all of them went in the bathroom—Rudy, too. I’m not saying he was doing nothing, but… But he went in there with them, and when they came out, you’re talking about some bad stumblin’ and fumblin’. So I went to Alfred. I said, “Look, Alfred, that’s it. I’m not going to record another record with a junkie. Forget it.” So for two years I didn’t do a record.\n\nSo he finally called me back, “You’ve got to do a date.” I said, “I’ll do it, but you’re not going to pick none of the musicians. I’m going to pick them.” And you can see the date, Blues Walk. I had Herman Foster, who was a religious singer, him and his wife—they sang religious music. But I had been going up to Connie’s, a place where they’d jam, and I had been playing with him, and he sounded so good, and we were compatible with our playing.\n\nI went and got Dave Bailey, drummer. Now, Dave was a liquor salesman up on Boston Road. But I used to work at a place called the Apollo Bar up on Boston Road, and he used to come by and sit in—and he played good. I said, “Yeah, this guy is good.” Ok, so I got Herman Foster; I got Dave Bailey.\n\nAnd then, I got Peck Morrison, bass player, who lived with me in the project. We were in the project. I got him on the date. Then I got Ray Barretto to steady down the rhythm…\n\nPanken: To play congas.\n\nDonaldson: Yes. I was working at Showman’s. I was the first band to work at Showman’s.\n\nPanken: Showman’s Lounge.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. Showman’s was right down next to the Apollo Theater then, about 1956 or 1957. I’m working in there, and Ray used to come by and play. I said, “now, look, I don’t want no Puerto Rican drums. I want swing.” He said, “that’s what I’m trying to do; I’m trying to learn how to swing.” And he had his friend with him, a little alto player who had a hump in his back, a guy named Chuck Eubanks. They used to come by all the time. I used to let him sit in.\n\nPanken: Chuck Eubanks.\n\nDonaldson: Chuck Eubanks and Ray. So when I finally got ready to make the date, that’s who I had. Herman Foster, Peck Morrison, all these guys. Alfred Lion didn’t know any of them. So he comes there. “I don’t know these guys.” I said, “Alfred, I told you; I’m not going to record with no more junkies.” Because Alfred by then… Now, Alfred was nice at first. But by then, Alfred had a belief … [PAUSE AT 33:09 AS VOICEMAIL PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND]\n\nAnyway, Alfred Lion’s jaws puffed way out. “I don’t know…” See, at that time, Alfred Lion just didn’t believe that nobody couldn’t play unless they was high. He just got… Like the rest of the record companies. They want to see a guy nod, they go, “Oh, he’s great.” So he finally said, “All right, I’m going to take a chance on this; I know I’m going to lose money.” Man, we made that Blues Walk—let me tell you something. Symphony Sid started to playing it. Spider Burke started to playing it in St. Louis. Daddy-O Dailey started to playing it in Chicago. And this guy in Detroit started… That record was a hit. The first record… They don’t tell you that. The first record that Blue Note ever put out that all the distributors took it, from New York to California, and put it on the jukebox.\n\nPanken: So the date for Blues Walk that I have is July 28, 1958.\n\nDonaldson: Right.\n\nPanken: But you had made three records before that, and Herman Foster was on two of those. The first one in the discography is Wailing With Lou, from January 1957. I’ve got Swingin’ Soul, which is from June 1957. Both are with those groups—Donald Byrd played with on Wailing With Lou. Then there’s a date that a lot of people like, called Lou Takes Off, which is a sextet with Curtis Fuller, Donald Byrd and Sonny Clark…\n\nDonaldson: And Jamil Nasser.\n\nPanken: Jamil Nasser and Arthur Taylor as well. Did you and Alfred Lion then reach an understanding?\n\nDonaldson: There was no understanding. He knew that he didn’t know what was on and I did. When the records started selling. And “The Masquerade Is Over” on the other side.\n\nPanken: Because you were traveling so much, you must have had a very good feel for what the public wanted to hear.\n\nDonaldson: That’s the key. I tell that at all my seminars. Every seminar, when I’m talking to young musicians, I say, “Feel out the audience. You try this kind of tune, that kind of tune, the other kind of tune—whatever you like, that’s where you lay.” You lay there with your setup.\n\nPanken: Now, in ‘55 and ‘56, even though you weren’t recording, you were working.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I worked.\n\nPanken: Were you starting to tour the country, go outside New York by that time?\n\nDonaldson: Right. I had my own tour.\n\nPanken: When did that start happening?\n\nDonaldson: I don’t know exactly the date, but I got my own tour from New York to California.\n\nPanken: Who was booking you at the time?\n\nDonaldson: Well, I was booking a lot of the gigs, but another guy named Warren Stevens, who used to work for Ruth Bowen Booking Agency… He’s a guitar player himself. He was a good friend of mine from Columbus, Ohio. He starts booking it.\n\nPanken: Describe the circuit a bit.\n\nDonaldson: Well, it was the greatest circuit in the world. I’m the only one that did it—first. Then McDuff and Groove Holmes and Jimmy McGriff and all of them came in later. We started in Rochester at a place called the Pythodd. Jon Hendricks’ brother owned it—Stewart Hendricks. Then we’d go from there to Buffalo, to the Pine Grill. Or another place up there was the Bon Ton. We had about four clubs we could work. Then we’d go to Pittsburgh, play Crawford’s Grill. Then we’d segue into Cleveland. Now, all these places were short jumps. So we didn’t have no transportation problems or nothin’. We’d go to Cleveland. We’d play Leo’s Casino.\n\nPanken: You’d be a week in each town?\n\nDonaldson: A week in each town. Sometimes two weeks. Leo’s Casino. Leo’s was on 55th and Central at that time, but he died, and his son took it over and put it on Euclid Avenue. His son is named Leo, too, but this was the original Leo.\n\nThen we’d leave Cleveland, and we’d go to Columbus, Ohio. Now, Warren had a club there himself, right down in town, and he had an unsegregated club, way back then.\n\nPanken: Were they called black-and-tan then?\n\nDonaldson: No, this club was called the Sacred Mushroom. But it was integrated. Because somebody threw a bomb in there one night, a stink bomb.\n\nPanken: This was in Columbus.\n\nDonaldson: Columbus, Ohio. Then I go down to Dayton, Ohio, a place called the Lavender Lounge. I remember it like it was yesterday. We’d play down there, then we’d go to Louisville, Kentucky, and play a place called the Idle Hour. Some rich guy down there had some money, and he let us play the club. We’d go down there and play, free food and everything. We were on a budget. Then what we’d do…\n\nDid I say Cincinnati? We played Cincinnati, too. We played Cincinnati. Babe Baker’s in Cincinnati. He was like the guy at Minton’s. He wanted nothing but a jazz club. In fact, one day, a disk jockey came in and put some James Brown records or something on the jukebox. He threw them out the window. He said, “don’t bring nothing in here but jazz.”\n\nThen we’d go…from Louisville, we’d go on Highway 50, go into St. Louis. Played the Gaslight Square, sort of like the Village—a lot of clubs down there. A lot of people hang out. Then we’d play over in East St. Louis, which is just 7 miles across the river, right by the Dome, right past the Dome. And we’d go from there to Kansas City, which ain’t but 240 miles. From Kansas City, then we’d go to Wichita, Kansas. I had this all set up. We’d go to Dallas, Texas. We’d go to Houston, Texas. Sometimes, if we could work it out, we’d play one-nighters in small towns, like Port Arthur and Belmont, Corpus Christi—we’d play one-nighters. Then we’d get set and head for California. Get Route 66, we’re gone, all the way to Los Angeles. Played the It Club.\n\nI knew all these guys. All these guys were hustlers, so I knew them. If I didn’t know them, I’d call them two or three weeks in advance and set it up. I was a lucky guy back then. Didn’t make a whole lot of money, but we worked all the time.\n\nThen I’d work San Francisco, and Oakland, a place called M Major’s. He’s dead now. But we worked in those clubs. Then we’d come on back. We’d bypass Utah, because we knew what was there, and we’d come on into Denver. Then we’d come on back into Omaha. We had a schedule. 500 more miles, we’re in Chicago. Joe Segal—he had two or three clubs. Then we’d leave there, we’d go to Detroit. Sure enough, before we got back, they wanted us so bad, we’d go right on back into Cleveland and Pittsburgh, and then come home.\n\nPanken: We’re not talking about ‘55 and ‘56, now. We’re talking about the ‘60s.\n\nDonaldson: We’re talking about the ‘60s.\n\nPanken: But in ‘55 and ‘56, you were starting to go out of town?\n\nDonaldson: Yes, I was starting to go out of town.\n\nPanken: Who were you taking with you? Was Herman Foster with you yet?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, Herman was with me.\n\nPanken: So by the time you’d made those first records, you’d been working with him for a year or more.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. Herman Foster, Peck. Morrison, and Jimmy Wormworth was the drummer. We went up to Buffalo, and hit some of the same clubs. But we had it set up…\n\nPanken: That’s when you started establishing that circuit and those relationships.\n\nDonaldson: Yes. Well, the reason I used an organ was because a lot of times we’d go into a place, and they didn’t have a piano—and renting a piano, that’s out of the question. People want a thousand dollars to rent a piano. Shit, a thousand dollars, we weren’t even making that much for the gig. So we decided we’d buy an organ, and we’ll get a bass player and a piano player at the same time. All we need is a U-Haul truck and a hitch. So I put a hitch on the back of my station wagon, and we’d pull it. We’d save money and made money.\n\nPanken: But if I’m not mistaken, you didn’t start touring with an organ until about 1960 or so?\n\nDonaldson: It was in the ‘60s somewhere.\n\nPanken: I’d like to stay in the ‘50s for now, if we can. What did you do when the piano was crap or a club didn’t have a piano?\n\nDonaldson: We couldn’t play the gig!\n\nPanken: So you wouldn’t play a gig without a piano.\n\nDonaldson: We couldn’t play it, no. So what happened then… You see, the funk groups were coming out, and the funk groups had these synthesizers and electric bass. We didn’t have that.\n\nPanken: You did so many gigs with Jimmy Smith in 1957 and 1958. People still treasure those recordings and play them, they’re a firm part of the history. When did you start establishing a performing relationship with Jimmy Smith?\n\nDonaldson: ‘57, ‘58, somewhere in there…\n\nPanken: Where I’m going is, was it set up by the record company? Was it your initiative?\n\nDonaldson: No. Babs Gonzalez set that up. He brought Jimmy to New York and told Alfred he should record him. So Babs was in the middle of that.\n\nPanken: So Jimmy Smith got the date, and then you got the call to do the record?\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: Were those satisfying engagements?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. No doubt about it. The Sermon is one of the greatest records ever made. It’s a great record.\n\nPanken: What do you think was the key to your simpatico with Jimmy Smith?\n\nDonaldson: We were compatible. He liked me. The organ sound and the alto sound is beautiful. Yeah, he liked me, because I played the blues, and that’s what he played.\n\nPanken: Can you describe personally what he was like during those sessions?\n\nDonaldson: Jimmy? Jimmy was carefree. Nice guy. In his latter years they said he was something else, but I didn’t know him then. I hadn’t seen him in a while. But back then, he was just a carefree guy.\n\nPanken: Had you heard before he played organ, when he was a piano player?\n\nDonaldson: No, I hadn’t heard him when he was piano player. The first I heard him was a record he made down in Wilmington. That’s where I heard that record, and it was so dynamic. With Thornell Schwartz. That was a great record.\n\nPanken: Had you been playing with organ players before that?\n\nDonaldson: Not too many. I played with John Patton.\n\nPanken: Before Jimmy Smith?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. I played with John Patton, Baby Face Willette, a couple of guys.\n\nPanken: The records with John Patton are around 1960, with Baby Face Willette around 1961. I wanted you to tell us about the Jimmy Smith recordings just because the records are so great…\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, they’re great.\n\nPanken: So whatever insight you can give us into how they were set up, or how…\n\nDonaldson: Jimmy was a musical genius. He can play. He was just like Art Tatum at the piano. It’s hard to play anything that he hasn’t played.\n\nPanken: Did that give you a feeling of freedom, that you could…\n\nDonaldson: Uh…yeah, freedom. Inspiration. Because he had good basslines. He could kick it.\n\nPanken: I’d like to ask about some of the alto saxophonists who were roughly your contemporaries who came into prominence in the ‘50s. Sonny Stitt is someone you’ve often been compared to stylistically.\n\nDonaldson: Mmm-hmm.\n\nPanken: Cannonball Adderley hit the scene in 1955. I’m sure you were aware of him quite quickly. Jackie McLean was a local hero in New York, and a protégé of Charlie Parker. Phil Woods was coming into his own during those years. Were those all people you were touching base with in one way or another?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, in one way or another.\n\nPanken: Can we say a few things about each of them? Sonny Stitt, for instance.\n\nDonaldson: Well, Sonny Stitt for me was the number-two man behind Charlie Parker. I always thought that. Sonny Stitt. But Sonny Stitt was a guy who knew the saxophone so well, he could get anything out of it. But…like, Charlie Parker was the only one I know that play that way and still play the blues in all of his playing. Sonny Stitt was more technical, but he was great. Great guy.\n\nPanken: How about Cannonball Adderley? Did you become aware…\n\nDonaldson: Cannonball didn’t even come to New York until after Charlie Parker was dead. So he was a big thing. But he’d have come while Charlie Parker was alive, he wouldn’t have been anything like that. But he could play. He was nice. He was a nice guy as far as I know. He played a little Country-and-Western. Sometimes he sounded like a hillbilly, but…\n\nPanken: How so?\n\nDonaldson: I mean, he played corny. You know what “corny” is, don’t you?\n\nPanken: I do.\n\nDonaldson: All right. He played corny. But he knew the saxophone. He knew it. In fact, Miles asked me to play with him two or three times when he had Coltrane there, but I wouldn’t play with Miles, because Miles wasn’t reliable with money, and I couldn’t afford to play a week without bringing in some kind of income.\n\nPanken: Were you tempted?\n\nDonaldson: No. No way. Because I didn’t want to do what you have to do to people like that. Because he was an icon, people liked him, and I wouldn’t want nobody to see me hit him upside the head with a baseball bat or something.\n\nPanken: Were you a fan of his music?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. I was a fan of his musicians. Red Garland I loved. Paul Chambers. And Philly.\n\nPanken: Did you get to know Coltrane?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I knew him. Coltrane’s from North Carolina.\n\nPanken: I was going to ask you about that. Monk as well had roots in North Carolina.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, Monk’s from Wilson, North Carolina. I knew Coltrane real well. He was a hard-working guy. But most of his stuff was drug-related.\n\nPanken: What do you mean?\n\nDonaldson: He’d get high, go in a room and play eight hours, you know, without coming out. Drugs. They don’t tell people that when they’re talking about him.\n\nPanken: What was your practice routine like?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, practice…\n\nPanken: I’m talking about then, the ‘40s, the ‘50s…\n\nDonaldson: I was working a lot then. I didn’t have no practice routine. When I started playing a lot, I never practiced, because I’d just go to work. If I got tired of playing a song, I just played it another key or something like that. Keep myself fresh. It made me think about what I’m doing.\n\nPanken: Back to alto players, did you get to know Jackie McLean well?\n\nDonaldson: I knew Jackie McLean well. He was like a brother.\n\nPanken: When did you meet him? When you got to New York?\n\nDonaldson: Yeah. I lived up there. I lived on 155th. He lived on 158th. Sonny Rollins lived around the corner. Edgecombe Avenue. I’d see all of them. But these guys were junkies. They were junkies. Sorry to say, but I had no use for no junkies. Because I thought it would just be my luck to be talking to one of them and the police run up and get us—get everybody.\n\nPanken: You thought you’d be caught in the same net, you mean?\n\nDonaldson: You got it. Because all they did was hustle every day to try to get money, to get high. They had some musical talent. But they’re characters that I wouldn’t recommend.\n\nPanken: Now, people did change and get over their habits.\n\nDonaldson: I don’t know. I doubt it.\n\nPanken: When did you first meet someone who was strung out on drugs?\n\nDonaldson: When did I first MEET someone?\n\nPanken: Yeah. In North Carolina?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, no. No drugs in North Carolina. They’d give you thirty years for smoking weed down there. They didn’t have no junkies in North Carolina, not when I was there. When I got to New York, I saw plenty of junkies.\n\nPanken: So your attitude towards people who were abusing drugs was more based on self-preservation, it sounds like, than anything else…\n\nDonaldson: Well, actually, none of them played as well as they thought they was playing when they was high. I could have got somebody sober to play better. Because everybody was following Trane. But Trane jumped the track, and they jumped it right behind him. Now all of them are unemployed. I call that “unemployment music.” And they still play it. Disk jockeys and record companies are so stupid. They don’t even acknowledge it because they’re stupid.\n\nPanken: Elaborate.\n\nDonaldson: Well, that’s a style of music that you can’t play in Atlanta. Charlotte, North Carolina. Birmingham. Big cities. St. Louis. You can’t play a steady gig there playing that. Kansas City. All the big cities. You can play it in New York, maybe one joint in Chicago—although Joe Segal has now started mixing up his entertainment. Nowhere in California can you play it, not on a steady gig. And that’s very counter-productive.\n\nPanken: Back to alto players. Phil Woods was the fourth name I wrote down here. Were you and he friends in the ‘50s?\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah. I like Phil. I like Phil very well, because Phil was one of the few white guys that, when he got famous, he didn’t forget the black guys. A lot of the white guys, once they got famous, made a couple of records and ran all off with the white bands. But Phil always kept some brothers around. Well, I guess he wanted the feeling in his band.\n\nPanken: Another alto player I can think of in the ‘50s who had his own sound was Lee Konitz. I recall when we did the DownBeat Blindfold Test, I gave you a track by him, and you had some interesting things to say.\n\nDonaldson: Yeah, I know Lee Konitz. Lee Konitz is a sax-o-phon-ist. I wouldn’t call him exactly a great jazz player, but he’s a good saxophone player. Him and Paul Desmond, too. They sound like they’re playing clarinets. They don’t even have the sound.\n\nPanken: So for you, it’s very important to have…\n\nDonaldson: I mean, a SOUND. A bluesy sound. They don’t have it. They can’t play the blues, unfortunately. They play what they’re playing. But the blues, a different thing. And if you can’t play blues, you can’t play jazz, period. Now, if you can play it and don’t play it, you’re still not playing jazz—period. I listen to all the stuff Coltrane’s playing. No blues. In fact, I did a survey… I didn’t do a survey. Mark Elf, guitar player. I had him to monitor the public commercial radio stations. He got the best tune that was hot, something by 50 Cents or somebody, and he monitored that tune for a week. You know how much airplay they got?\n\nPanken: How much?\n\nDonaldson: 715 times. And I had to monitor Coltrane and see how much airplay he got on a commercial station. You know how many he got?\n\nPanken: How many?\n\nDonaldson: [RAISES HAND WITH INDEX FINGER AND THUMB IN A CIRCLE, AND THREE FINGERS OUTSTRETCHED]\n\nPanken: That’s three. Oh, it’s zero.\n\nDonaldson: That’s zero! Not one. Now, that’s no good. You can’t even stay in business like that. Because you know, and anybody else knows, that years and years and years, we got a lot of play on commercial stations with Duke Ellington’s tunes and Count Basie, “April in Paris” and all that kind of stuff. We got play on commercial stations. But now jazz…kiss it goodbye. TV? I haven’t seen a jazz show since Tony Bennett was on there years ago, and brought Count Basie on there.\n\nPanken: I’m going to move into another area. You were one of the first jazz group leaders to use a conga player, as you were describing with Ray Barretto on those Blue Note dates from 1957. I think you used the phrase just now, “straighten out the rhythm.” What exactly did you mean by that, and what…\n\nDonaldson: Actually, I meant control. Now you can see today you’ve got these guys like Poncho Sanchez and a couple of more Latino musicians making a lot of money, because they put that beat with jazz. Because there’s no such thing as Latin Jazz. You can kiss that goodbye. That’s a misnomer. It’s jazz with Latin rhythm. That’s all it is. And when they keep that rhythm, which is the heart of the thinking in their music, they can sell the records. We could have done it ourselves if we’d kept our rhythm, with Kenny Clarke and Max… Those guys were shooting a little cocaine…shooting a little heroin and snorting a little cocaine—they didn’t want to swing any more. They wanted to take a solo. Most of the time, when somebody else is soloing. That’s what the problem is. That’s how they’re losing out.\n\nPanken: But what was the value for you of having the conga player?\n\nDonaldson: To steady down the rhythm. That’s all.\n\nPanken: You had done a date in 1955 with Gene Ammons. It’s the one sideman recording with you that I know of from that period. I know that he also liked to use the congas.\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: He used it a lot. Were you friendly with him?\n\nDonaldson: Yes.\n\nPanken: There’s something about your records in the ‘50s and his records…a very similar vibration.\n\nDonaldson: Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it’s a groove. A groove record. It’s a swing record. Groove records. It’s hard to say, but that’s what jazz is all about. If jazz was played the way they’re playing now, there would have never been any jazz. In fact, people have played like Coltrane and… Well, I don’t want to, you know, beat on a dead horse, but it sounds like he’s playing a concerto! He states a theme, and then he [SINGS WILD SCALE]. That’s not jazz. A lot of times, when you play the theme, you’re playing the jazz. You take a guy like Louis Armstrong. He played the same way until he died. He never changed one thing. And when he was an old man, he started making hit records. “Hello, Dolly” and this other one…” [SINGS REFRAIN OF “MACK THE KNIFE”] Now, the way he’s playing it, he’s playing jazz in the melody. That’s what makes it. Like George Shearing. You hear him play “I Got Rhythm.” George played [SINGS IMPRESSION OF SHEARING PLAYING “MACK THE KNIFE”]. Louis Armstrong doesn’t play it like that. He said, [SINGS IMPRESSION OF LOUIS ARMSTRONG PLAYING “MACK THE KNIFE”] Man, he’s playing jazz in the melody.\n\nA lot of people forgot that, and they go to these high-priced schools, they learn how to play music. They’re great musician. I mean, a lot of young saxophone players, they can really get over a saxophone. But they couldn’t play “Tea For Two.” I say, “Do you know ‘Tea For Two’?” “Oh, no, how does that go?” So I say, “How in the world can you play ‘Giant Steps’ and you can’t play the melody for ‘Tea For Two’?” there’s something wrong somewhere. That doesn’t make any sense.\n\nPanken: I think now we should stop for today, and we’ll get together tomorrow and bring this to the present.\n\nDonaldson: I hope so. Because we’re getting into some deep things about music now. I’m going to tell you why they should set Monk up in a different category. I’ll tell you exactly why he should be in a different category.\n\n[END OF June 20, 2012, PART 2, TRACK 1]\n\n[BEGINNING OF June 21, 2012, PART 1, TRACK 1]\n\nPanken: I’m Ted Panken at Lou Donaldson’s house for day two of the Smithsonian Oral History Project interview. It’s June 21, 2012. Nice to see you again, Lou.\n\nDonaldson: Nice to see you.\n\nPanken: I’d like to return to what we started off with yesterday, and speak a bit more about your family. You had some information you were going to think of. For one thing, I’m not sure whether we got on tape what college your father went to.\n\nDonaldson: Livingstone College.\n\nPanken: He was a minister. Was that a theological college? A seminary?\n\nDonaldson: No… I don’t know. It might have been. But he was one of the first black students there. It was the oldest black college. I don’t know exactly what they taught there.\n\nPanken: You said your whole family were educators.\n\nDonaldson: Yup.\n\nPanken: Except you.\n\nDonaldson: Me, too. I’m the most educated. No, what I was saying was most of them had doctorates. I got a Bachelors, but they got…\n\nPanken: I said educators, not educated.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, educators. Oh, yeah. All of them were educators, right. All of them went into education. Schoolteachers and people like that.\n\nPanken: Can you talk about what kind of person your father was? Was he very strict.\n\nDonaldson: Ah, he was… It’s hard for me to say. He was just a father. He wasn’t that strict because I never did anything to make him angry. He was a preacher and an insurance salesman, and every Sunday I had my duties and the regular stuff I had to do. But other than that, he was ok. Heh-heh.\n\nPanken: And your mother? You stated that she was a music teacher, and you didn’t want to take piano because of the threat of the strap, but…\n\nDonaldson: That’s right.\n\nPanken: But what else can you tell us about your mother?\n\nDonaldson: Well, my mother had to be the greatest woman that ever lived. She was like, uh, the black mayor of Badin. Anything you had to do know once you crossed the tracks, they came to her to get the information. She was a powerful woman. Actually, she was a first grade teacher, so she knew all of the people in the town, because she taught them. She was a music teacher and she was choir director, and the church organist. So she did everything. She did everything in the town. All the social activities. She just about (?—3:27) them. She sent all of us to college. We were the first kids from the town to really go to college. First black kids really to go to college. There were four of us.\n\nPanken: And they all played music, too?\n\nDonaldson: Yes, they played music.\n\nPanken: What did they play?\n\nDonaldson: They played piano.\n\nPanken: So European classical music?\n\nDonaldson: Not really. Just piano. Except my brother, he was a bandmaster. He played classics. He ended up in Louisville, Kentucky, where he was the director of the bands for years.\n\nPanken: High school?\n\nDonaldson: He was a high school teacher.\n\nPanken: That’s what I meant. He was director of high school bands.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yeah, high school bands. Right.\n\nPanken: I can’t remember if I asked you this yesterday. Coming up as a kid in Badin, did you have any instructors other than your mother? You taught yourself, I guess you said.\n\nDonaldson: Oh, to play the clarinet?\n\nPanken: Yes, to play the clarinet.\n\nDonaldson: Yes, I taught myself. And my mother…\n\nPanken: Your mother could help you a little bit.\n\nDonaldson: With the music and the notes. Keys. Signatures on the music and all that. She didn’t know much about the clarinet, but I just read the book and found out about that.\n\nPanken: And you figured out the embouchure and all the details…\n\nDonaldson: Oh, yes. I figured all that out.\n\nPanken: Did you perform at all before you went to Greensboro?\n\nDonaldson: No!\n\nPanken: Did you play at home…\n\nDonaldson: Oh yeah, I’d play at home, and I’d play down… I’d go down in the middle of town and play like marches and things that I’d learned. All the kids would come around, because I was the only one playing music in t"
