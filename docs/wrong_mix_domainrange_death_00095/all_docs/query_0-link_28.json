MAY, 1944, Rehearsals for Billy Eckstine’s new orchestra at Nola’s Studios in New York.\n\nNote: Up to this point, Leo Parker had been an alto saxophonist. From this point on, the baritone saxophone would remain Parker’s sole musical voice.\n\n…We needed a baritone player, Leo Parker, who had been playing alto up to this moment; but I went downtown and signed for a baritone, for Leo, and put him on it. –Billy Eckstine\n\n–Robert Reisner, Bird: The Legend of Charlie Parker\n\nJUNE 9, 1944: Wilmington, DE – Odd Fellows Building\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\nJUNE 11, 1944: Washington, D.C. – Turner’s Arena, 1342 W St.\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\nJUNE 12, 1944: Rocky Mount, NC – Cobb Foxhall Warehouse\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\n…I learned a great deal about the Eckstine contribution to modern music from the late baritone saxophonist Leo Parker (Mad Lad) who was the baby of the orchestra, having joined Mr. B’s group when he was 17 [sic] years old…\n\n“We all starved together,” was something Leo Parker said often about the years with Mr. B. “But there was so much music going on it didn’t matter.”\n\nMost of the stories about Charlie Parker were true. Yes. He was on drugs then and would fall asleep on the bandstand. It was Leo’s duty to try and keep “Bird” awake during a performance.\n\n“Bird would nod out,” said the Lad, “and I would nudge him when it came time for his solo and he would snap out of it and stand up and play something so fantastic it stunned you.”\n\nThen there were those Southern tours. Leo said the band bus would roll through Dixie and pull up in some small town for a dance.\n\nThey used tobacco warehouses as dance halls. They would remove all the bundles of leaves and then they would drive about 20 cars up on all sides of this barn and turn on the car lights.\n\n“The light shining through the wood siding would be the only light for the dance. We often read our music by car headlights.”\n\nEckstine’s crew grew quite tough on these Dixie tours.\n\n“We’d be playing some swinging music,” recalled Leo, “and on the dance floor, some sharecropper would stab another right in the middle of a tune and they’d just drag the wounded cat off the floor and keep right on dancing.”\n\nWhite Southerners from miles around would also turn out to hear the band. According to Leo Parker, some warehouses and dance halls in the Carolinas had balcony or loft arrangements where the whites sat up high “while the colored partied down below.”\n\nLeo was inclined to dramatics but his most hair-raising incident in the Eckstine Southern tours was when they arrived in a Deep Dixie town and were greeted by the sheriff who said in friendly fashion: “Welcome boys, hope y’all play real good tonight. The dance lets out at midnight, and any one of you I see on the street after 12:30 I am gonna shoot straight through the head.”\n\nThat night, America’s greatest musicians played with one eye on their music charts and the other on the clock.\n\n“We hit the last note at midnight,” Eckstine’s baritone player said. “‘Stine collected the bread and we were on the highway five minutes later. Max Roach knew what he was doing when he refused this tour…”\n\n–Ralph Matthews, Jr., “Mainstream,” The Baltimore Afro-American, January 16, 1965, p. 5.\n\nJUNE 13, 1944: Durham, NC – Big 4 Warehouse, 200 Morgan St.\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\nJUNE 22, 1944: Lakeland, FL\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\nJUNE 23, 1944: Tampa, FL\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\nJUNE 30, 1944: San Antonio, TX – Library Auditorium, 226 N Hackberry\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\nJULY 1, 1944: Dallas, TX – Claudia’s Place\n\nBilly Eckstine and his Orchestra\n\nJULY 7-ca.

For in the hands of “Leo the Lion,” as he was named by Illinois Jacquet, the baritone saxaphone [sic] is transformed from the rhythm instrument it once was to the swinging, driving, front line horn that “The Lion” has made it. Now, here are some facts concerning this “Wonder Boy of the Baritone.”\n\n“FACTS OF LIFE” Lea [sic] was born 22 years ago on April 18, 1925, in Washington, D.C. at 15 he began the study of the alto saxaphone [sic] while attending Armstrong High School in Washington. in 1943 [sic], just three years later, he joined Billy Eckstine on his present instrument, the baritone. After an interesting year and a half with Eckstine he left to join the Benny Carter band, leaving there three months later to replace Charlie Parker in the Dizzy Gillespie Sextet at 52nd Street’s “Spotlite.” In 1944, Leo had met Illinois Jacquet on the west coast and two years later he sat in with the Jacquet band and in December of last year he joined Illinois jumping band in which he is now and intends to remain.\n\n“LEO ON RECORDS” Leo Parker’s recording work in the past, while not extensive, does serve to show at least a sample of his ability. Perhaps Leo’s finest solo is on the Sarah Vaughan Musicraft recording of “My Kinda Love” with Tad Dameron and his orchestra. A good solo is spotted briefly on Jacquet’s “Jivin’ With Jack the Bellboy” on Alladin [sic]. Leo got off a fine chorus on “Jumpin’ at the Woodside,” with Jacquet, which is soon to be released on Appollo [sic]. His latest recording is EB-POB which he and Fats Navarro co-authored. The title is Be-Bop spelled backwards and in addition to Parker and Navarro, Denzil Best, Eugene Ramey, and Tad Dameron round out the line up of this fine Savoy recording. Leo was featured on a WNEW “Saturday Night Swing Session” broadcast from New York recently with the Jacquet orchestra’s wonderful drummer, Art Blakely [sic].\n\nFAVORS “MODERNS” Leo is a friendly and sincere young man who is sincerely devoted to music he plays and to the men beside whom he is playing. Speaking of Illinois Jacquet he says “He is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, tenor-man of today. Illinois has a real soul and is a real man, both personally and musically.” Of Billy Eckstine, “To me he’s one of the finest people I’ve ever been privileged to know and work with.” This sincerity is not wasted for his friends in the music world are legion, and to them, to Jacquet, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, the late Freddie Webster, Bill Swindell, Barry Ulanov, and to his parents he gives all the thanks they rightfully deserve for their help and encouragement. Leo gives especial credit to his parents who understand and appreciate what he is trying to do, and who have aided and encouraged him in his effort to play the music he knows is right. Also Leo is very grateful to Barry Ulanov for his interest in Leo and for the inspiration he has given him. One of “The Lion’s” closest friends is the Jacquet valet, Paul Douglas, who is described as the “great Be-Bop valet” and is known as “Iceberg-the Cool Breeze.”\n\nLEO AND MUSIC Now that you know about Leo, here is a little something about his music. To him, there is no Be-Bop–he is playing “not a thing with a name but the living music of today.” “However,” says Leo, “if they must call it a name, the man who originated that style of music was Thelonious Monk, a great modern pianist.” Leo chose the baritone because, in his words, “It’s the greatest horn in the world and I know since I’ve been playing it, I do and will do things with it that no one has ever done before.” That, in brief, is exactly what Leo is doing. He plays with a large, brilliant tone, a tremendous driving beat, and a virtuoso dexterity that is almost inconceivable on his large horn. The rich swinging sounds that pour from Leo’s baritone must be heard to be appreciated for really, no words can really describe them.\n\n“THE FUTURE” For the future, Leo intends to stay with the Jacquet orchestra in which he is a vital factor, and to add the mastery of the bass saxophone to his growing list of accomplishments. A picture of “the Lion” will appear in the July Metronome. With young and talented men like Leo rising in the jazz world we can be sure that jazz will not die for, in Leo’s words again, “I appreciate the audience in their approval of the music I play and I hope that they enjoy the music as much as I enjoy playing it.” To sum up, here is a prodigious musician who has come, and will go, a long way, blazing his name across the firmament of jazz and coming to his due recognition as one of the “Greatest.” The name is LEO THE LION PARKER. Remember it. You’ll be hearing him.\n\nMiles and Leo\n\nby Barry Ulanov\n\nMetronome, July, 1947, p. 19\n\nTo one group of musicians in New York a couple of guys named Miles Davis and Leo Parker are a lot more important than a couple of guys named Harry James and Harry Carney. The two Harrys are much better known on their instruments, trumpet and baritone, than Miles and Leo, but they’re not half as interesting to the boys up at Minton’s in Harlem or the kids who assemble in Charlie Parker’s back living-room or Tad Dameron’s front.\n\nMiles and Leo are kids themselves, 21 and 22, respectively, but they’re serious. And to them, as to their friends, being serious is half the battle. They divide all musician into two groups, the “serious cats” and the “jokers.” By their standards there are very few of the former and phonograph records full of the latter.\n\nMiles has studied at the Juilliard School of Music, “but I learned more from playing with and talking to Charlie Parker.” Leo studied some alto at high school in Washington, “but I learned to blow from Charlie Parker.” Both have adopted as many of Yardbird’s ideas as they could; Charlie is their mentor, master and moving force.\n\nBoth Miles and Leo have played with big bands, Billy Eckstine’s, Benny Carter’s; Leo is with Illinois Jacquet’s colossus right now. Both have played, officially and just for kicks, with Charlie and Dizzy and the little crews which have gathered under various leaders up at Minton’s, home of the bebop brave. Both love to talk about music, Miles more voluble than Leo.\n\n“We’re not just imitating our idols,” Miles makes clear. “We dig what’s happening, that’s all.” What is happening with these musicians is a remarkable transformation of jazz. They’re not just imitators of their idols, as they affirm. Their equipment and their experience are not sufficient yet to mark them as entirely identifiable individuals. But you can’t mistake Leo’s huge tone, his easy command of his horn, his fluency of idea. You can’t miss Miles’ relentless interest in new music, in fresh figures, in arresting handling of bebop, such as those nights of brilliant duetting with Fats Navarro up at Minton’s, their impeccable lines, a fourth apart, joined as tightly as Dizzy and Bird in their unison passages.\n\nThese are the emerging jazz heroes, young men in a dry year, who will stick with their ideas, come Eddy Howard or Guy Lombardo.\n\nJULY 4-6, 1947: Newark, NJ – Graham Theater\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nJULY 10, 1947: Atlantic City, NJ – Waltz Dream Arena, 117 N Ohio Ave.\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nJULY 15, 1947: Akron, OH – Akron Armory, S High St. and E Bowery St.\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nJULY 18-24, 1947: New York, NY – Apollo Theater, 253 W 125th St.\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nJULY 28, 1947: Asbury Park, NJ – Asbury Park Armory, 701 Lake Ave.\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nJULY 31, 1947: Cleveland, OH – Public Auditorium, 500 Lakeside Ave. E\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nAUGUST 2-27, 1947: Detroit, MI – Club El Sino, 1730 St. Antoine\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nca.

Presumably Leo Parker missed some or all of these dates to make the El Sino dates with Ammons.\n\nThose of us who passed near St. Antoine and Beacon the past week got a great boot from the tenor sax of Gene Ammons who “Red Topped” his way into Detroiters’ hearts and from Leo Parker whose smeared baritone notes reaped the cream of the El Sino’s applause.\n\nAfter running through his often -played “Red Top” and everyone’s favorite “After Hours” (piano by Julian [sic] Mance), Ammons put his tenor aside to sing a chorus of “Going Down Slow” which he hollered in such a manner as to bring the conventional house down.\n\nParker was a kick every time, as he usually is. His “Solitude” on which he alternately caresses and hits his big full-toned notes, showed just what a capable musician can do with a saxophone. And he did, but good.\n\nAmmons’ rhythm included Gene Wright on bass, Mance and Ellis Bartee on drums. From Detroit, the outfit goes to Chicago supporting Billy Eckstine at the club Silhouette.\n\nThe International Sweethearts of Rhythm open at the Club El Sino Oct. 10.\n\n–“‘Red Top’ Bows Out; All-Girl Group at Sino,” Michigan Chronicle, October 11, 1947, p. 18\n\nOCTOBER 4, 1947: Detroit, MI\n\nLeo Parker All Stars, recording session for Savoy records ✇\n\nOCTOBER 21, 1947: Wilson, NC – Community Center\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nOCTOBER 22, 1947: Danville, VA – City Armory or Greensboro, NC\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nOCTOBER 23, 1947: Lynchburg, VA\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nOCTOBER 25, 1947: New York, NY – Town Hall, 123 W 43rd St.\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nOCTOBER 26, 1947: Chicago, IL – Civic Opera House, 20 N Wacker Dr.\n\n“All Star Jazz Program” featuring Charlie Ventura, Mildred Bailey, Dallas Bartley, and Leo Parker\n\nNote: Illinois Jacquet’s band played in Buffalo, NY on this date.\n\nOCTOBER 27, 1947: Toronto, Canada – Palace Pier\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nOCTOBER 29, 1947: Youngstown, OH – Nu-Elm Ballroom\n\nIllinois Jacquet and his Orchestra\n\nca.

Group is under the direction of Joe Glaser.”\n\n…Leo Parker had formed a group and asked me if I wanted to play with him. So I joined his group in New York because he was one of those who used to sit in with us at The Congo Lounge in Chicago. He used to come there with Illinois Jacquet’s band. So we worked for about two weeks and then nothing! And I had spent all my money! Leo was from Washington, D.C. where our last gig was. So myself and the trombone player, Taswell Baird who used to play in Dizzy’s band, we were both stranded. This was the first time I’d ever been stranded. In the meantime, Leo gets sick and has to go into the hospital…\n\n…Charlie Rouse was in the group. There was a trumpet player named Wesley Anderson. A drummer named George Brown. They called him “Dude” Brown… Tommy Motrey was the bass player. That group didn’t last more than a couple of months though... –Junior Mance\n\n—Cadence, July, 1994\n\nDECEMBER 28, 1950: Philadelphia, PA (or New York, NY)\n\nLeo Parker and his Mad Lads, recording session for Gotham records ✇\n\n1951\n\nJULY 4 (or 7), 1951: Chicago, IL – Universal Recording\n\nLeo Parker and his Quintet, recording session for Chess records ✇\n\nSEPTEMBER 14, 1951: Chicago, IL\n\nRay Snead, recording session for Mercury records ✇\n\nNOVEMBER 11, 1951: Chicago, IL – Pershing Ballroom, 64th St. at Cottage Grove Ave.\n\n“Autumn Cavalcade” with Claude McLin, Von Freeman, Eddie Johnson, Leo Parker, Grady Johnson, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Ethel Duncan, Motis Clifton, Phillip Carney, and John Jenkins\n\nDECEMBER 31, 1951: Chicago, IL – Union Park Temple, 1507 W Ogden Ave.\n\nLeo Parker and his band\n\n1952\n\nca.

But mostly at himself for drifting deep into anonymity in the last couple of years and letting the music scene just about pass him by completely.\n\nSo Leo Parker is starting from the beginning again. He has rid himself of the frustrations and insecurities that made him the frantic Leo of old and is now working hard with his own quintet–a group he promises will be of top caliber with further work, rehearsals, and a couple of personnel changes.\n\nAnd probably the most succinct way of pointing out the change in him is to mention that a few years ago he made a descriptively-titled record called Wild Leo. His most recent cutting is a side proudly designated Cool Leo.\n\nA generous share of credit for ridding Leo of his troubles and showing him he was getting nowhere speedily must go to his new manager, George Hill, who also works for the Chicago Defender.\n\nAfter Parker left Illinois Jacquet in 1950 he drifted awhile, then came to Chicago. He worked rarely, floated in and out of town. Then Hill met him, squared him away, took over his affairs, and booked Parker with a combo into the Boulevard Room in Kansas City a couple of months ago. With the added impetus of Roy Eldridge on trumpet, the band did beautifully and stayed on through a couple of options.\n\nThen the owner of the K.C. Latin Quarter [sic], which had been booking top units like the Dorseys, Guy Lombardo, etc., brought the band in for two weeks, marking the first time a colored unit had played the place.\n\nThe band did excellently, then moved into a string of one-nighters that ended with his current two-weeker plus options at Grady’s, in Nashville.\n\nAnd his recent records for Chess have been moving well, especially on r. and b. jukes, and it appears that once more the former altar boy from Washington D.C. is on his way to the rewards his large talent should reap.\n\nNOVEMBER 7-15, 1952: St. Louis, MO – Glass Bar, 2935 Lawton Blvd.\n\nGene Ammons and his Orchestra\n\nNOVEMBER 15, 1952: Chicago, IL\n\nLeo Parker and his Mad Lads, recording session for United records ✇\n\nNote: Although discographies list this recording session as November 15, this may be the wrong date.
