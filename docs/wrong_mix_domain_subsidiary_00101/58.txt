_____________________________

1. Acceptance of Terms of Use

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by, and to have irrevocably agreed to, these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.

Some areas of our Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions, which you should read carefully before making any use of those areas. These additional terms will be posted in connection with the applicable Services and will be in addition to these Terms of Use. Such additional terms will not change or replace these Terms of Use unless otherwise expressly stated. Where any direct conflict exists between these Terms of Use, or any additional terms, and the applicable Privacy Policy , the terms of the Privacy Policy shall take precedence. However, provisions unique to these Terms of Use will remain in effect as provided here. You must have (and, by using our Services, you warrant that you have) the legal capacity to enter into the agreement set out in these Terms of Use (i.e., that you are of sufficient age and mental capacity and are otherwise entitled to be legally bound in contract).

EACH TIME YOU ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE OUR SERVICES YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN-APPLICABLE TERMS OF USE AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THIS SITE OR VIA OUR APPLICABLE SERVICES (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the posted Terms of Use and any applicable additional terms each time you use our Services (or at the very least prior to each transaction or submission). The additional terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms of Use (and any applicable additional terms) that applied when you previously used our Services will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) except as mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of any new, revised or additional terms and conditions is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You can reject any new, revised or additional Terms of Use by discontinuing use of our Services

2. Permitted Uses

Non-commercial Use. Your use of our Services is limited solely to your personal and non-commercial use.

Commercial Establishments.

The foregoing shall apply to you regardless of the method in which NBC Sports makes Content available to you, including via a widget, embedded player or any other technology that may allow you to embed or stream Content on or to another site.

You may use your account to access a maximum of one (1) stream of Content at any time across all of your Devices. Except as set forth herein, simultaneous access to multiple streams of Content by a single account holder is strictly prohibited. Note to Commercial Establishments: If you are permitted to subscribe to a Fee-Based Product for commercial establishments, you are allowed to purchase one (1) subscription for each Device within your establishment for which you intend to access, view, and stream the Services.

You may not either directly or through the use of any Device or other means copy, download, stream, reproduce, duplicate, archive, distribute, upload, publish, modify, translate, broadcast, perform, display, sell, transmit or retransmit our Services or Content unless expressly permitted by NBC Sports in advance in writing. You may not incorporate Content into, or stream or retransmit the Content via, any hardware or software application or make our Services or any Content available via frames or in-line links, and you may not otherwise surround or obfuscate the Content or Services with any third party content, materials or branding.

You may not knowingly or intentionally take any action that may impose an unreasonable burden or load on our Services or its servers and infrastructures. You may not build a business on, in whole or in part, resell, redistribute or recirculate or make any other commercial use of, or create derivative works or materials utilizing, any portion of our Services or Content, whether or not for profit (notwithstanding that you may access, view, and stream the Services via a permitted Fee-Based Product for commercial establishments) .

You may not do, nor authorize to be done, anything which, in our opinion, may give rise to the belief that you are in any way officially associated with NBC Sports, the Content, or the Services (for example, as a sponsor, supplier or similar).

These features and services may include the ability to access our Services’ features and upload content to our Services, receive messages from our Services, and download applications to your wireless Device (collectively, “Wireless Features”). Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Wireless Features and certain Wireless Features may be incompatible with your carrier or wireless Device. In addition, your carrier may charge you for standard messaging, data, and other fees to participate in Wireless Features. Fees and charges may appear on your wireless bill or be deducted from your pre-paid balance. We have no responsibility or liability for any fees or charges you incur when using Wireless Features. You should check with your carrier to find out whether any fees or charges will apply, what plans are available and how much they cost. You should also contact your carrier with any other questions regarding these issues.

Further, we may collect information related to your use of the Wireless Features in accordance with our Privacy Policy . If you have registered via our Services for Wireless Features, then you agree to notify NBC Sports of any changes to your wireless contact information (including phone number) and update your accounts on our Services to reflect any changes.

Location-Based Features. For Services on mobile Devices (“Mobile Apps”) when you use one of our location-enabled Services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. Some of the Mobile Apps or Services require your location information for the feature to work. If you have enabled GPS, geo-location or other location-based features on a Device, you acknowledge that your Device location will be tracked and may be shared with others consistent with the Privacy Policy .

In addition, where any Mobile App collects precise information about the location of your Devices, it will be used to provide requested location services, and, depending on the particular Mobile App, it may be used, amongst other uses, to allow tagging or to check-in.

Social Media Plug-Ins. Social media plug-ins of social networks such as Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus (among others) may be integrated on our Services. Where our Services contain a plug-in to a social network, these are clearly marked (e.g. with a Facebook button). If you choose to click on one of these buttons or links, your browser connects directly to the servers of the relevant social network. The social network directly transmits the content of the plugin to your browser. If you are registered on the relevant social network and logged into your respective account the social network receives the information that the web page was used by you. If you interact with a social network plug-in (e.g., you press the Facebook “Like” feature, the Twitter “Tweet this” feature, Google Plus “1+” button, or equivalent) or drop a comment on the appropriate web page, the corresponding information is directly transmitted to the relevant social network from your browser. If you are not registered with the social network or you are logged out before you visit our Services, there is the possibility that at least your IP address will be submitted to and stored by the social network. If you interact with us through a social media platform, plug-in, etc., then you may be enabling us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social network profile (such as your name, social networking id page, e-mail address, photo, gender, location, the people/sites you follow, etc.).

If you don’t want a social network to collect the information about you described above, or to share it with us and other third parties, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or log out of the relevant social network before you visit our Services. As with other sites, you may be able to delete any existing cookies placed on your computer by the social network via your browser. See our Privacy Policy to find out more about how our Services contain plug-ins to social media networks.

You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, “Payment Method”) for payment. You may edit your Payment Method information in the applicable Account page. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges.

Each time you are charged for your renewal, the renewal charge will be the same as the prior period’s charge, unless (a) you were eligible for a discounted rate but are no longer eligible for that discounted rate, in which case your renewal charge will be in an amount equal to the then-current full term regular price for the product you subscribed to; or (b) we notify you in accordance with this Payment Agreement in advance at the time of sign up or prior to the beginning of the renewal period that your renewal price will be changing.
