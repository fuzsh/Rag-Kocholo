        "text": "The university org code hierarchy is managed by the University Budget Office (UBO). Anyone at the university with an active Stanford University ID (SUNet ID) may view and download the org code hierarchy. The Organization Code Hierarchy Tool provides an interactive “tree view” of the org code hierarchy which identifies each organization by a four-character alphabetical org code.\n\nAll university-wide applications (e.g., authority manager, financial systems and reporting, human resource management, budgeting, and numerous other systems) leverage the org code values from the hierarchy.\n\nOrg codes are used to:\n\nPrepare detailed business unit budgets.\n\nAssign staff or PTAs (projects, tasks, awards) to an organization.\n\nReport on revenues, expenses, and fund balances for an organization.\n\nConsolidate and report university financial statements.\n\nManage the scope of granted authorities in Authority Manager.\n\nSome schools and departments leverage the data from the org code hierarchy to integrate data from university-wide systems to unit-specific systems. With the appropriate access, school/department system administrators can preview pending changes to the university org code hierarchy and download versions of the org code hierarchy using file exports.\n\nAuthorized budget officers may request new org codes or request changes to existing org codes using the Organization Code Hierarchy Tool. Refer to the quarterly deadlines for submitting org code change requests to the UBO and for an understanding of when approved org code changes will be implemented in university systems.\n\nTo learn more about Stanford’s accounting structure and organization (org) codes, see topic overviews:"
