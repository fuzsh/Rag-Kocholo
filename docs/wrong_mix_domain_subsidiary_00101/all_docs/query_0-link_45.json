This Ruling is subject to periodic revisions and updates.\n\nThe above opinion(s) is/are based on the evaluation by the CCMC of technical evidence provided by the evaluation holder, and is bound by the stated conditions and limitations. For the benefit of the user, a summary of the technical information that forms the basis of this evaluation has been included.\n\nProduct information\n\nProduct name\n\nWest Fraser™ LVL\n\nProduct description\n\nThe product is a laminated veneer lumber (LVL) (see Figure 1) that is manufactured by laminating veneers of Lodgepole Pine, Douglas Fir, Aspen and White Spruce singularly or in combination at the Rocky Mountain House plant. The grain of the veneer is oriented parallel to the length of the member. The 3-mm-thick veneers are bonded with an exterior-type phenolic resin (phenol-formaldehyde) complying with CSA O112.10-08, “Evaluation of adhesives for structural wood products (limited moisture exposure)” (see CCMC 13192-L). The veneer joints are scarfed or lapped and staggered with a minimum distance between joints of not less than 100 mm. The lengths and widths are cut in square edges.\n\nFive grades of the product (1700Fb-1.3E, 2750Fb-1.7E, 3000Fb-1.8E, 3000Fb-1.9E and 3100Fb-2.0E) are available in 25.4-mm to 89-mm thicknesses, 89-mm to 1 219-mm depths, and a maximum length of 24.38 m.\n\nQuality control and testing is conducted by APA – The Engineered Wood Association (APA-EWS) as an independent third-party monitoring and inspection agency accredited by the Standards Council of Canada.\n\nManufacturing plant\n\nThis evaluation is valid only for products produced at the following plant:\n\nProduct nameManufacturing plantRocky Mountain House, AB, CAWest Fraser™ LVLProduct evaluated by the CCMC\n\nProduct evaluated by the CCMC Indicates that the product from this manufacturing facility has been evaluated by the CCMC\n\nTechnical information\n\nThis evaluation is based on demonstrated conformance with the following criteria:\n\nEvaluation requirements Criteria number Criteria name CCMC-TG-061710-15ACCMC Technical Guide for Structural Composite Lumber\n\nTable 1.

APA-EWS conducts monthly audits of the manufacturing plants and the quality assurance program.\n\nAdditional information\n\nThe design values specified in this evaluation were obtained from testing in conformance with ASTM D5456-14 and are summarized below. The manufacturer’s published pre-engineered beam and header spans were designed in accordance with CSA O86-14.\n\nTable 3. Additional test information for the product Property Test information Bending Bending of multiple sizes to establish volume effects. A parametric, 5% tolerance limit with 75% confidence level approach was used to determine the characteristic value. Test data were used to establish the applicable coefficient of variation, CVw, and the reliability normalization factor from CSA O86 was used to determine the specified strength. Shear Specimens were tested edgewise as full-size specimens (ASTM D5456-03). A non-parametric, 5% tolerance limit with 75% confidence level approach was used to determine the characteristic value. Test data were used to establish the applicable coefficient of variation, CVw, and the reliability normalization factor for full-size specimens from CSA O86 was used to determine the specified strength. Compression parallel to grain Specimens were tested and a non-parametric, 5% tolerance limit with 75% confidence level approach was used to determine the characteristic value. Test data were used to establish the applicable coefficient of variation, CVw, and the reliability normalization factor from CSA O86 was used to determine the specified strength. Compression perpendicular to grain Specimens were tested and the average stress for a 1-mm deformation was determined. This value was divided by 1.67 to establish the design value. Tension parallel to grain Specimens were tested in tension for establishing the characteristic value and volume effects. A parametric 5% tolerance limit with 75% confidence level approach was used to determine the characteristic value. Nail withdrawal Nail withdrawal values were established following ASTM D1761-88, “Standard Test Methods for Mechanical Fasteners in Wood,” for an 8d common nail having a 31.75-mm penetration. Twenty specimens were tested and equivalent species capacity was determined in accordance with ASTM D5456-01, Appendix A2.4. Nail bearing Dowel bearing strength was determined in accordance with ASTM D5764-95, “Standard Test Method for Evaluating Dowel-Bearing Strength of Wood and Wood-Based Products,” using 10d common nails with a nominal diameter of 3.76 mm and a lead hole diameter of 2.77 mm. Forty specimens (ten specimens for four combinations of load direction) of each LVL were tested and the mean bearing capacity was used to establish the equivalent species capacity in accordance with ASTM D5456-01, Appendix A2.5. Bolt bearing Bolt bearing capacity was determined in accordance with ASTM D5764-95 using 12.5-mm and 19.0-mm bolts. One hundred and twenty specimens (30 specimens for each bolt and LVL face combination) were tested and the mean bolt bearing capacity was used to establish the equivalent species capacity in accordance with ASTM D5456-01, Appendix A2.5. Creep and recovery Specimens of the product were tested in accordance with a 90-day creep and recovery test, resulting in acceptable performance. Adhesives APA has confirmed that the adhesive, Hexion Cascophen MX-06C, complies with CSA O112.10-08, “Evaluation of adhesives for structural wood products (limited moisture exposure).” See CCMC 13192-L.\n\nAdministrative information\n\nUse of Canadian Construction Materials Centre (CCMC) assessments\n\nThis assessment must be read in the context of the entire CCMC Registry of Product Assessments, any applicable building code or by-law requirements, and/or any other regulatory requirements (for example, the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, etc.).\n\nIt is the responsibility of the user to confirm that the assessment they are using is current and has not been withdrawn or superseded by a later version on the CCMC Registry of Product Assessments.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe National Research Council of Canada (NRC) has evaluated only the characteristics of the specific product described herein.
