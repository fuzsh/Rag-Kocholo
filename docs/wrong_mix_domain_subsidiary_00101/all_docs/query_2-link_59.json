More importantly, they can better understand how their own role fits into the current organizational structure.\n\nCommunicating values: The design of the chart itself can convey a company’s values on hierarchy, collaboration, and inclusivity.\n\n16 organizational chart examples\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some organizational chart examples you can use your business.\n\nThe majority of these examples feature hierarchical org charts, but you can add or delete branches to create other types of org charts as well.\n\nVertical smart organization chart example\n\nThis vertical corporate structure chart uses dynamic colors to differentiate the teams and their reports.\n\nThis extreme vertical format works well for smaller corporate structures or for departments within a larger organization.\n\nNote: An organizational chart such as the one above can be easily customized in the Venngage editor.

This will especially help new hires understand right away what they’re looking at.\n\nSimple vertical organizational chart example\n\nFor a more modern look and feel, check out this alternate take on a healthcare organizational chart.\n\nIt incorporates a digitized background design and a flat color palette.\n\nBold vertical organization chart example\n\nWhen designing your own organizational chart, it’s important to group employees together who report to the same manager/executive.\n\nIt’s up to you how you visualize those connections.\n\nOne method is to use lines and nodes for a typical layout.\n\nOr, as in this vertical organizational chart example, you can use a legend and a varied color palette to indicate the reporting structure.\n\nModern vertical organizational chart example\n\nAn organizational chart can also be more than a breakdown of reporting relationships.\n\nThis organizational chart includes contact information for individual staff. This is especially helpful for new employees or when communicating across departments.\n\nThis is a memorable way to show the connections between departments and team members and it makes a statement.\n\nLearn more: Venngage for Healthcare Organizations\n\nVibrant functional smart organizational chart example\n\nIf choosing a design style for your organizational chart feels challenging, consider your organization’s brand guidelines.\n\nIt can provide you the style and color inspiration you need to get started.\n\nMarketing organizational structure example\n\nIn this example, the organizational chart is broken down by function and it’s clear the chief marketing officer oversees the marketing department.\n\nBlue functional organizational chart example\n\nAnother option is to apply a unique color for each department or function.\n\nThis will help whoever is reading the organizational chart find exactly what they’re looking for. Otherwise, you’ll many tables that look exactly the same and it take more time to understand.\n\nGenerally, a traditional marketing organizational structure is broken down by departments.\n\nYou have teams entirely dedicated to areas like branding, communications and digital. It’s also important to identify teams that marketing relies on – like customer success and developers.\n\nWith the use of a vibrant color palette, you can clearly identify each department and who belongs in each. It’s easier to scan and follow over angular lines, especially in more complex organizational structures.\n\nThis blue functional organizational chart example is broken down in a similar way. The layout is just set to landscape and reads from left to right.\n\nNotice how this organizational chart design makes use of employee headshots?\n\nThat’s especially helpful to new employees.\n\nWith the rise of remote work and remote employee onboarding, you may not always share an office or break room with fellow co-workers so headshots in a organizational chart is a simple way to help folks get acquainted.\n\nVertical organizational chart example\n\nA vertical organizational chart, or hierarchical chart, is the traditional org chart you see in many organizations.\n\nThe layout positions the CEO at the top, with those report directly below and so on.\n\nThe goal of a vertical organizational chart is to present reporting relationships between employees.\n\nHere’s an example vertical corporate structure chart for Apple. You can see it’s a very typical hierarchical chart with lots of layers of leadership.\n\nSource\n\nIt’s clear who reports to whom in upper-management at a glance.\n\nCompanies like Apple also have unique roles such as the Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives executive, or the Apple University Dean.\n\nPlotting these types of roles in a business organizational chart is essential as it indicates where these roles fall in terms of hierarchy, who they answer to and what their responsibilities are.\n\nAnother aspect of a vertical organizational chart are the organizational functions. This is often referred to as a functional organizational chart.\n\nInbound marketing organizational structure example\n\nSource\n\nIn a presentation by Hubspot on creating agile teams, they shared a breakdown of how their (powerhouse) marketing department is structured.\n\nThe breakdown is by specific functions/objectives, channels and relevant metrics.\n\nYou’ll also notice that there is no clear reporting structure because the objective of this chart design is to highlight how the marketing team operates.\n\nThis is what a functional organizational chart can look like within a department.\n\nThe functions are defined as teams and channels. Your own organizational chart design will probably look different since it depends on the types of channels your marketing team is divided into.\n\nVertical divisional organizational chart example\n\nSource\n\nThis divisional organizational chart is broken down into its separate business areas of focus.\n\nThis type of organizational structure applies to larger organizations with divisions that are geographical, product-focused, industry-focused, market-focused or anything along those lines.\n\nYou’ll see that each division has its own marketing team, sales team and services team and they operate independently of one another and have all the same functions.\n\nSimple horizontal organization chart example\n\nFlat organizational structures can share the same layout as vertical organizational structures, but there are fewer executive and managerial levels.\n\nThe horizontal organizational chart example above also uses a landscape orientation.\n\nThis helps to emphasize the lack of hierarchical tiers and the extended role of management. While it is just a design choice, it communicates how the organization is structured at a glance.\n\nValve, the popular video-game developer, is proud of the flat organizational structure they’ve built.\n\nHere’s how they visualize their organizational structure in their employee handbook. They include a few quips as well.\n\nSource\n\nThis is a fun way to understand Valve’s views on hierarchy, structure and collaboration. It’s clear there is a level of camaraderie and togetherness they aspire for.\n\nIt’s also a great example of presenting an organization’s brand and culture through documentation.\n\nRather than just a flat organizational structure with minimal hierarchy, Valve aspires for a completely collaborative organization with no hierarchy at all.\n\nWithin a horizontal organizational structure, managers will have a higher set of responsibilities and more direct reports than a typical manager.\n\nThis means a marketing manager may have designers, product people, support staff and others who don’t necessarily fall into “marketing” as reports, too.\n\nLean marketing organizational structure example\n\nSource\n\nGithub has a lean marketing organizational structure.\n\nThe VP oversees many areas, but they are not layered with upper and middle management. Instead, the teams are small and collaborative.\n\nIt’s always helpful to mimic your organizational structure in the design of your organizational chart. Reduce the number of tiers and group teams together in the way that makes the most sense.\n\nIn Github’s lean marketing structure, you can see where responsibilities overlap, those teams share a color code.\n\nThese color palettes can carry over into project sprints and tasks that get tracked in applications like Trello and Asana! It’s a great way to maintain consistency in all your corporate communications.\n\nMatrix organizational structure examples\n\nThe matrix organizational chart combines traditional organizational structures.\n\nSource\n\nA matrix organizational chart ties in project planning needs by pairing project managers with interdisciplinary teams.\n\nThat means the chart needs to highlight departmental or functional managers and their direct reports, as well as project managers and their reports.\n\nHere’s a detailed look at the layout and reporting structure of a matrix organizational chart:\n\nSource\n\nThere is a clear vertical functional structure with functional managers lining the top row.\n\nBut project managers work with employees from each function and so form a parallel column to the employees in each function.\n\nIn this layout, the tiny squares highlight which employee in each function reports to a project manager.\n\nThe simplest way to indicate reporting relationships here is through the use of arrows or lines and aligning the correct staff vertically with their managers and horizontally with their project managers.\n\nThe matrix organizational structure is necessary for large organizations that have multiple projects going on and need collaboration across departments.\n\nNike’s organizational structure gets a lot of praise and it happens to be a matrix organizational structure.\n\nSource\n\nCreative organizational chart examples\n\nMany organizations experiment with the structure of their company.\n\nWhether it’s a desire for faster decision-making, smarter experimentation, clear channels of communication, improved accountability or something else, how your organization is structured makes the difference.\n\nStartups and major corporations alike often adopt creative organizational structures that achieve a goal.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of these types of organizational charts.\n\nSpotify’s organizational chart example: Tribes, squads and guilds\n\nSpotify, the well-known audio-streaming service, is known for its unique tribe organizational structure.\n\nDue to its growth and success, many startups have tried to adopt the same organizational structure, or some variation of it and make it work for them.\n\nAt a glance, it may seem strange and overly complex. But the organizational structure facilitates the communication and collaboration Spotify needed (and still needs) to grow quickly and reliably.\n\nIt starts with a tribe and its tribe leads.\n\nThey lead the squads that oversee different areas of the product. Across the squads, in each tribe, you have chapters that facilitate communication between the squads and chapter leads.\n\nSource\n\nOf course, there are numerous tribes across the organization.\n\nThey work fairly independently of one another on a wide range of things that may or may not overlap.\n\nAs these individuals learn from new experiences, problems, outcomes and so on, they need to share information, tools, code and best practices.\n\nThese folks form guilds which include members across tribes. People can also belong to multiple guilds.\n\nSource\n\nSpotify’s tribal organizational structure is meant to cut down on bureaucracy, which naturally builds as a company grows to hundreds or thousands of staff.\n\nThis way Spotify can still collaborate effectively as an organization, deliver projects sooner, implement changes faster, grow better and behave in a far more responsive manner.\n\nYou can also see from the way the organizational charts are arranged, there is an emphasis on fluidity within the structure, rather than rigidity.\n\nZappos organizational chart example: Holacratic organizational structure\n\nZappos is an online shoe and clothing retailer. They’re also known for having a unique culture and organizational structure.\n\nThey share insights on their approach to structure on Zappos Insights. This includes the fact that they are a holacracy.\n\nA holacracy has a decentralized leadership, rather than one concentrated in an individual or handful of people.\n\nIt aims to distribute power typically reserved to executives across an organization to all employees.\n\nIt rejects the notion of hierarchy completely. The benefit is that it enables regular staffers to put forth ideas, collaborate with other employees and work with minimal restrictions.\n\nHere’s an example of what a holacratic organizational chart looks like:\n\nYou can see right away there aren’t any lines, columns or rows like in the previous organizational chart examples.\n\nEmployees belong in a space that is shared, brought together in areas of specific functions and tasks.\n\nA complete holacratic organizational chart would be a cluster of super-circles representing departments or functions, with smaller groups of circles for specific areas.\n\nWhat are the 4 different types of organizational charts?\n\nTo best visualize org structure and communicate your company’s chain of command, you can create an organizational chart for any of these four types of organizational structures: vertical (or hierarchical), horizontal (or flat), matrix and creative.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each one:\n\nVertical organizational chart (hierarchical organizational chart)\n\nThis is the most common type of organizational chart.\n\nA vertical — or hierarchical — organizational chart has the person with the most power at the top and those with less power underneath and when combined, it forms a pyramid shape.\n\nHere’s an example of a hierarchical organizational chart:\n\nHorizontal organizational chart (flat organizational chart)\n\nThe horizontal org chart (or flat org chart) visualizes an organizational structure with little or no level of middle management.\n\nThis means it contains only two levels: the top administrators and the workers.\n\nHere’s an example of a flat organizational chart:\n\nMatrix organizational chart\n\nThe matrix organizational chart combines vertical and horizontal organizational structures.\n\nIt integrates a top-down vertical organizational structure that highlights reporting relationships with the flexibility of a flat organizational structure where cross-department teams report to project managers.\n\nHere’s an example of a matrix organizational chart:\n\nCreative organizational chart\n\nThe creative organizational chart applies to organizations with unconventional structures like Spotify (tribes, squads, guides) or Zappos (Holacratic organizational structure).\n\nHow to create an organizational chart in Venngage\n\nAs an online visual communication tool, creating any type of organizational chart can be done in minutes.\n\nFirst, go ahead and set yourself up with a free Venngage account.

When organizations are just getting started, or fairly small, there is a tendency to share the load across team members. However, it can lead to a lack of clarity about who owns what areas, what everyone’s individual responsibilities are and how to measure individual performance.\n\nIn small organizations, a defined corporate structure chart highlights everyone’s key responsibilities, holds them accountable and allows them to manage their workload without burning out.\n\nFor additional resources for planning and organizing your teams or even company, check out these blog posts:"
