        "text": "A company’s code of conduct should be used to help employees internalize the organization's ethical principles so that they are accessible and likely to influence everyday decisions. The goal is to give employees a clear compass and build strong accountability around the organization's ethical principles so as to reduce ethical risk and help employees address ethical dilemmas competently. Doing the right thing can be difficult despite people's best intentions, which is why approaching ethical risk in a way that takes into account decision-making biases and self-interested motives is a critical step in curbing such type of risk.\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\n• Detail what type of behavioral weaknesses the code of conduct must account for in order to be effective\n\n• Determine the key findings from a recent study on code-of-conduct best practices in Fortune 1,000 organizations\n\n• Outline recommendations on how to increase the effectiveness of your code of conduct\n\nSpeakers:\n\nCaterina Bulgarella, PH.D. Ethics Advisor & Culture Architect\n\nRebecca Turco, VP of Learning for SAI Global\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nField of Study: Management Services\n\nPrerequisites: None\n\nAdvanced Preparation: None\n\nProgram Level: Basic\n\nDelivery Method: Group Internet Based\n\nCPE Credit Notice\n\nThis is a group internet-based event for NASBA authorized continuing education credit.
