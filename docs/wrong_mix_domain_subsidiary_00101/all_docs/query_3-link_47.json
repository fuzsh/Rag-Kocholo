Brand-name drugs may or may not be listed on a formulary. For any health need, there may be competing drugs from different companies.

This brand-name drug will cost more than the generic version, but cost less than other brand-name drugs that are not on the formulary. If you buy brand-name drugs that are not on the formulary, you often pay more because your health plan pays more.\n\nCertification number\n\nA number stating that your treatment has been approved by your insurance plan.
