In an effort to provide easy access to The Code, we are providing \"view only\" access, not only for ANA members, but for all nurses and the public.\n\nAlso, in recognition of the impact ethical practice has on patient safety and the quality of care, ANA has designated 2015 as the \"Year of Ethics,\" highlighted by the release of a revised code of ethics for the profession. We will have a plethora of new programs and products to help increase your awareness and integration of The Code into your everyday practice.\n\nView the Nursing Code of Ethics for Free\n\nThis is a View-Only document.
