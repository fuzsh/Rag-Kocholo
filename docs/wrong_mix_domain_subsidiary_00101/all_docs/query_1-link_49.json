Reservations are subject to availability. Trip must be booked at least sixty (60) days prior to intended departure date. If Winner elects to partake in any or all portions of his/her Trip with fewer than three (3), or no, Guests, this Prize will be awarded only to the Winner and each participating Guest and any remainder of the Prize will be forfeited and shall not be subject to further or alternative compensation.

Winner and Guests must travel together on the same itinerary, including the same departure date, destination and return date, and must have valid travel documents (e.g., valid government issued photo ID and/or passport) prior to departure, and failure to do so will result in forfeiture of Prize. Sponsors and Prize Provider will not replace any lost or stolen tickets, travel vouchers or certificates. Sponsors and Prize Providers are not liable for any expenses incurred as a consequence of flight cancellation/delay. Trip may not be combined with any other offer and travel may not qualify for frequent flyer miles. Sponsors shall have the right, but not the obligation, to make any deductions and withholdings that Sponsors deem necessary or desirable under applicable federal, state and local tax laws, rules, regulations, codes or ordinances.\n\nSponsors and Prize Provider shall have no responsibility or liability for cancellations, delays, or any other change by any company or person providing any element of Prize due to reasons beyond Sponsors’ and Prize Providers’ control, and are not responsible or liable for any expenses incurred as a consequence thereof.

Should the Prize, or a portion thereof, become unavailable Sponsors and/or Prize Provider shall make reasonable efforts to provide Winner with substitute experiences and/or items of a similar nature and value for that portion of the Prize that is unavailable. If no substitute prizing is reasonably available then the remaining components, if any, of the Prize shall constitute full satisfaction of Sponsors’ and/or Prize Provider’s Prize obligation to Winner, and no other or additional compensation will be awarded.\n\nPrize fulfilment and related activities will take place on a date and time designated by Sponsors and Prize Provider and only when and in a manner that it is safe to do so, as determined by Sponsors and Prize Provider in their sole discretion in consultation with appropriate health and safety experts.
