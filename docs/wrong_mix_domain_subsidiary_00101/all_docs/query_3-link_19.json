Also included are statutory citations which are noted as being interpreted or applied by those regulations.\n\nThe table is divided into four segments and within each segment the citations are arranged in numerical order:\n\nFor the United States Code citations, by title and section;\n\nFor the United States Statutes at Large citations, by volume and page number;\n\nFor public laws citations, by number;\n\nFor Presidential documents (Proclamations, Executive orders, and Reorganization plans) citations, by document number.\n\nEntries in the table are taken directly from the rulemaking authority citation provided by Federal agencies in their regulations. Federal agencies are responsible for keeping these citations current and accurate. Because Federal agencies sometimes present these citations in an inconsistent manner, the table cannot be considered all-inclusive. The portion of the table listing the United States Code citations is the most comprehensive, as these citations are entered into the table whenever they are given in the authority citations provided by the agencies. United States Statutes at Large and public law citations are carried in the table only when there are no corresponding United States Code citations given.\n\nBeginning in 2017, the table is available in volumes of the CFR Index and Finding Aids publication on govinfo. You can download the entire CFR Index and Finding Aids volume or just the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules.\n\n2016: PDF | Text\n\n2015: PDF | Text\n\n2014: PDF | Text\n\n2013: PDF | Text\n\n2011: PDF | Text\n\n2009: PDF | Text\n\nSearching the Code of Federal Regulations\n\nYou can find and search the Code of Federal Regulations by:\n\nUsing Basic Search for keyword and metadata fielded searches,\n\nUsing Advanced Search; fields specific to the CFR will display after you select Code of Federal Regulations in the Refine by Collection column,\n\nUsing Citation Search to retrieve a single Code of Federal Regulations document in PDF format if you know the Volume and Page of the document,\n\nRefining search results by clicking on links in the Refine Your Search panel on the left hand side of the page (the sections under Refine Your Search correspond to the metadata available for the documents), and\n\nBrowsing the Code of Federal Regulations browse page.\n\nGeneral govinfo Search Tips\n\nSearch Examples\n\nSearch by Citation- For example, 7 CFR 1951.7 from 2016.\n\nUsing Basic Search, enter: collection:cfr and citation:\"7 CFR 1951.7\" and publishdate:2016\n\nUsing Advanced Search, select Code of Federal Regulations under Refine by Collection, then under Search In select Citation in the first box and enter “7 CFR 1951.7\" in the second box\n\nUsing Citation Search, select Code of Federal Regulations from Select Collection box, select 2016 from Select Year box, select 7 from Select Title Number box, and then enter 1951 in the Part field and 7 in Section box\n\nSearch by Title Number- For example, CFR documents from Title 7.\n\nUsing Basic Search, enter: collection:cfr and cfrtitlenum:7\n\nUsing Advanced Search, select Code of Federal Regulations under Refine by Collection, then under Search In select CFR Title Number in the first box and enter 7 in the second box\n\nSearch by Title and Part Number- CFR documents from Title 7, Part 1951.\n\nUsing Basic Search, enter: collection:cfr and cfrtitlenum:7 and cfrpartnum:1951\n\nUsing Advanced Search, select Code of Federal Regulations under Refine by Collection, then under Search In select CFR Title Number in the first box, enter 7 in the second box, click + Additional Criteria, select CFR Part Number from the resulting box, and enter 1951 in the next box\n\nSearch by Keyword- For example, Code of Federal Regulations documents with “emissions” in the full text of the publication.\n\nUsing Basic Search, enter: emissions and collection:cfr\n\nUsing Advanced Search, select Code of Federal Regulations under Refine by Collection, then under Search In enter emissions in the second box\n\nSample Code of Federal Regulations URLs\n\nGovinfo uses two key pieces of information to construct predictable URLs to documents and Details pages:\n\nGranule ID for the Code of Federal Regulations is used to identify the specific section, part, subpart, chapter, or subchapter within a volume of the publication.\n\nPackage ID is used to identify an individual volume of the publication.\n\nDetails Page for a Specific Section, Part, Subpart, Chapter or Subchapter\n\nStructure: https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/{Package ID}/{Granule ID}\n\nExample: https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2008-title39-vol1/CFR-2008-title39-vol1-sec20-2\n\nPDF File for a Specific Section, Part, Subpart, Chapter or Subchapter\n\nStructure: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/{Package ID}/pdf/{Granule ID}.pdf\n\nExample: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2008-title39-vol1/pdf/CFR-2008-title39-vol1-sec20-2.pdf\n\nXML File for a Specific Section, Part, Subpart, Chapter or Subchapter\n\nStructure: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/{Package ID}/xml/{Granule ID}.xml\n\nExample: http://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2008-title39-vol1/xml/CFR-2008-title39-vol1-sec20-2.xml\n\nDetails Page for an Entire Volume\n\nStructure: https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/{Package ID}\n\nExample: http://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/CFR-2008-title39-vol1\n\nPDF File for an Entire Volume\n\nStructure: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/{Package ID}/pdf/{Package ID}.pdf\n\nExample: http://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2008-title39-vol1/pdf/CFR-2008-title39-vol1.pdf\n\nXML File for an Entire Volume\n\nStructure: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/{Package ID}/xml/{Package ID}.xml\n\nExample: http://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2008-title39-vol1/xml/CFR-2008-title39-vol1.xml\n\nMetadata Fields and Values\n\nMetadata fields and values can be used to increase the relevancy of your searches.

When the print editions are released, the online version is also made available. If a CFR Title or volume is not listed in the CFR browse, that volume has not been published at that time. The date for which a particular Title of the CFR is published varies with each Title and volume and is dependent upon the publisher. The Code of Federal Regulations is published by the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nIn general, CFR volumes are updated (not published) once each calendar year, on a staggered basis in accordance with the annual update cycle. The annual update cycle is as follows: Titles 1-16 are updated as of January 1st; Titles 17-27 are updated as of April 1st; Titles 28-41 are updated as of July 1st; Titles 42-50 are updated as of October 1st.\n\nAs an alternative resource, the Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR), is a currently updated version of the CFR. It is not an official legal edition of the CFR. The e-CFR is an editorial compilation of CFR material and Federal Register amendments produced by the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of the Federal Register (OFR) and the Government Publishing Office. OFR updates the material in the e-CFR on a daily basis.\n\nHow do I access the electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR)?\n\nThe e-CFR is available at www.ecfr.gov.\n\nHow do you report errors in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or e-CFR?\n\nTechnical errors with this site should be reported to askGPO. It will help us to troubleshoot the issue faster if you include the following:\n\nwhat device you're using (mobile device, desktop, etc.)\n\nthe specific URL of the page you were trying to access,\n\nthe steps you took that resulted in the error,\n\nany specific search or browse terms you used, and/or\n\na screenshot of the page where the error occurred.\n\nFor questions or comments regarding e-CFR editorial content, features, or design, email [email protected].\n\nFor questions concerning e-CFR programming and delivery issues, email [email protected].\n\nErrors made by the issuing agency should be reported to the agency that issued the regulation. The agency that issued the regulation is listed in the chapter heading. Agencies correct their errors by publishing CFR amendment documents in the Federal Register. Agency correction documents are generally styled as \"final rule corrections\" or \"technical amendments.\"\n\nHow do I access historical editions of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or other collections on this site?\n\nThis site provides access to most collections from approximately 1994 (103rd Congress) forward. Years of coverage for each collection are indicated next to the collection name on the Browse A to Z page. Historical versions or years of collections can be obtained from a Federal Depository Library. Federal publications and other information products are made available for free public use in Federal depository libraries throughout the United States. In addition to the publications, trained librarians are available to assist in their use. Locate a Federal Depository Library.\n\nDo you have a single PDF file for the entire edition or full Titles of the Code of Federal Regulations?\n\nAt this time, it is not possible to download entire editions or complete titles of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) on govinfo as a single PDF file unless the whole title is comprised of a single book/volume. There are often several volumes (or printed books) across one title. For example, Title 49 is printed in 9 volumes. You cannot obtain the entire title in one electronic file because that is not the way the document is processed. The electronic volumes correspond with the print volumes.\n\nWhat does it mean when I see [Reserved] in the CFR?\n\n\"[Reserved]\" is a term used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency uses \"[Reserved]\" to simply indicate that it may insert regulatory information into this location some time in the future. Occasionally \"[Reserved]\" is used to indicate that a portion of the CFR was intentionally left empty and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error."
