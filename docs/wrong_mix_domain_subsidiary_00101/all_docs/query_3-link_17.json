        "text": "Who we are\n\nThe World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international public-interest non-profit organization where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Founded by Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and led by President & CEO Seth Dobbs and a Board of Directors, the Web Consortium's mission is to lead the web to its full potential.\n\nW3C's history\n\nWeb inventor Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. He remains W3C's Emeritus Director and Honorary Member of the Board of Directors.\n\nFrom the start the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been an international multi-stakeholder community where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop open web standards.\n\nRead the W3C history\n\nW3C Community\n\nW3C's global standards constitute the toolkit for web solutions that scale, enabling innovators to solve hard problems, providing the proper foundations to meet requirements for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security on the web.\n\nStandards that meet the varied needs of society are created not by one company but through the work of the Web Consortium community:\n\nMembers: More than 350 Members from around the world lead the development and implementation of standards.\n\nStaff: W3C is a public-interest non-profit organization whose revenues come primarily from Membership dues. These and some grants support a staff of about 50 people who are direct employees or employees of W3C Partners (former Hosts): ERCIM (Europe), Keio University (Japan), Beihang University (China).\n\nDevelopers: Over 14,700 developers worldwide participate in the standards development.\n\nLearn how W3C is led\n\nW3C standard development process\n\nThe proven standards development process upheld at the Web Consortium promotes fairness and enables progress.\n\nOur standards work is accomplished in the open, under the W3C Process Document and royalty-free W3C Patent Policy, with input from the broader community. Decisions are taken by consensus. Technical direction and Recommendations require review by W3C Members – large and small. The Advisory Board guides the community-driven enhancement of the Process Document. The Technical Architecture Group is our highest authority on technical matters.\n\nInternational Participation\n\nW3C conducts its work primarily in English. Organizations located all over the world and involved in many different fields join W3C as Members to participate in a vendor-neutral forum for the creation of Web standards. W3C Members and a dedicated full-time staff of experts have earned W3C international recognition for contributions to the Web. W3C's global efforts include:\n\nLiaisons with national, regional and international organizations around the globe. These contacts help W3C maintain a culture of global participation in the development of the World Wide Web. W3C coordinates particularly closely with other organizations that are developing standards for the Web or Internet in order to enable clear progress.\n\nThe W3C Chapters Program, which promotes adoption of W3C recommendations among developers, application builders, and standards setters, and encourage inclusions of stakeholder organizations in the creation of future standards by joining W3C.\n\nTranslations of Web standards and other materials from dedicated volunteers in the W3C community. W3C also has a policy for authorized translations of W3C materials. Authorized W3C Translations can be used for official purposes in languages other than English.\n\nTalks around the world in a variety of languages on Web standards by people closely involved in the creation of the standards.\n\nW3C's Internationalization activity helps ensure that the Web is available to people.\n\nRecognition\n\nIn orchestrating these activities, the Web Consortium has earned a reputation for fairness, quality, and efficiency.\n\nThough not well-known by the general public, the Web Consortium has earned recognition for its global impact: the Boston Globe ranked W3C the most important achievement associated with MIT (the first W3C historical Host).\n\nThe Web Consortium's impact even extends beyond this planet: NASA regularly uses W3C standards in Mars and space exploration missions.\n\nThe organization has won three Emmy Awards: in 2016 for its work to make online videos more accessible with captions and subtitles, in 2019 for standardization of a Full TV Experience on the web, and again in 2022 for standardizing font technology for custom downloadable fonts and typography for web and TV devices.\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nIn administrative terms W3C has become its own legal entity in January 2023, moving to a public-interest non-profit organization after 28 years with an atypical organizational structure where legal and fiduciary roles were assumed by four host institutions across the planet. Read more about the W3C history.\n\nIn process terms, the W3C Process Document, Member Agreement, Patent Policy, and a few others documents establish the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in the making of W3C standards.\n\nThe Process governs the standards-setting aspect of W3C. The Bylaws govern the operation of the corporation that supports the standards process and W3C’s other efforts to pursue its mission.\n\nFunding model\n\nW3C sources of revenue include:\n\nW3C Member dues\n\nResearch grants and other sources of private and public funding\n\nSponsorship and donations"
