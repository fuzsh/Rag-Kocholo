        "text": "A Led Zeppelin rarity we’ve never seen, heard of, nor can find any online reference for. This UK first pressing of LED ZEPPELIN III has the correct Led Zeppelin Side One label, and on Side Two has a label for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young’s “Deja Vu” album.\n\nUK Atlantic released Led Zeppelin on October 23, 1970 in the UK, as Atlantic 2401002. The album previous to this in the catalog was CSNY’s Deja Vu, Atlantic 2401001. Evidently someone at the pressing plant mixed up the labels, and put the correct label—with the soon to be withdrawn “Executive Producer: Peter Grant” credit on Side One, but an incorrect “Deja Vu” Side Two label on Side Two. The catalog numbers differed by only 1 digit, and the designs looked identical—but obviously it was a significant error.\n\nThe music here is the correct Led Zeppelin album, with A/5 and B/5 stampers and “Do What Thou Wilt” and “So Mote It Be” etched into the dead wax. The labels, as you can see, are in excellent condition, and the vinyl grades VG++. The cover grades VG++ as well. If you’re a Zeppelin completist this will probably be your only opportunity to get this ultra rarity."
