        "text": "For over 25 years The Birth of Led Zeppelin, an International touring Led Zeppelin Tribute band, has been pounding the Hammer of the Gods to Led Zeppelin fans both nationally and internationally. This authentic Live Concert reproduction goes far beyond any group of musicians covering the same tunes you've heard on the radio for over 4 decades. Any musician can learn a song note for note, but to perform as a full Led Zeppelin tribute with all of the subtle nuances and authentic look and sound and mannerisms is comparable to an actor preparing for a character in a film. In this case the characters are members of the Legendary British Supergroup LED ZEPPELIN. The Birth of Led Zeppelin captures the musical and personal characters of John Bonham, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant and brings each individual member to the stage in their absolute prime. Die-hard Zeppelin Fans and Rockstars they've shared the stage with have sworn they were watching the real group live. Hence the word being spread that our Show is \"The Real Deal\" when it comes to Led Zeppelin Tributes.\n\nEven Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones said after meeting the original Jones , while signing a concert photo of his character, \"That's scary\". Looking at the likeness of each character, he commented, \"As long as you're doing it, means we don't have to.\" The Birth of Led Zeppelin has been privileged to share the stage with Legendary Artists such as Peter Frampton, Foreigner, Molly Hatchet, Kansas, Steppenwolf, Nazareth, Tesla, Warrant, Jefferson Starship, Eric Burden and the Animals, Eddie Money, World-renowned Jimi Hendrix tribute musician Randy Hansen and many others. The Birth of Led Zeppelin is bringing back the magic of a true Led Zeppelin Concert to fans all over the world, and the response has been overwhelming. If you've never seen the real Led Zeppelin in concert, or if you have and want to relive the magic, No Quarter is as close as it gets to capturing the Iconic British Rock Group Live. Their growing ocean of fans will agree."
