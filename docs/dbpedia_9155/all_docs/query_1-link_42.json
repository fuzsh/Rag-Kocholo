        "text": "The British rock band Led Zeppelin enjoyed phenomenal commercial success throughout the 1970s. Although its musical style was diverse, the band came to be best known for its influence on the development of heavy metal.\n\nInitially called the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin was formed in 1968 by Jimmy Page (born on January 9, 1944, in Heston, Middlesex, England), the final lead guitarist for the legendary British blues band the Yardbirds. Bassist and keyboard player John Paul Jones (born John Baldwin on January 3, 1946, in Sidcup, Kent), like Page, was a veteran studio musician; vocalist Robert Plant (born on August 20, 1948, in West Bromwich, West Midlands) and drummer John Bonham (born on May 31, 1948, in Redditch, Hereford and Worcester; died on September 25, 1980, in Windsor, Berkshire) came from little-known local bands. Page and Jones wrote most of the band’s music, while Plant contributed lyrics and some musical ideas.\n\nThe group was influenced by various kinds of music, including early rock and roll, psychedelic rock, blues, folk, Celtic, Indian, and Arabic music. Although acoustic and folk-based music was part of the band’s repertoire from its inception, it was the bottom-heavy, loud, raw, and powerful electric style that gained them their following early on. Their first two albums, Led Zeppelin (1968) and Led Zeppelin II (1969), included many of the songs that prompted the band’s categorization as a precursor to heavy metal. The heaviness of songs such as “Dazed and Confused” and “Whole Lotta Love” was created by Bonham’s enormous drum sound and through Page’s production techniques, which emphasized drums and bass.\n\nPlant’s voice rounded out Led Zeppelin’s sound. Exaggerating the vocal style of blues singers such as Howlin’ Wolf and Muddy Waters, Plant created the sound that has defined much hard rock and heavy metal singing: a high range, an abundance of distortion, loud volume, and emotional excess (“Whole Lotta Love” is a classic example). Plant was, however, capable of a broader stylistic range, including tender ballads (“The Rain Song”) and songs showing the influence of Indian and Arabic vocal styles (“Kashmir”).\n\nLed Zeppelin’s best-known song is “Stairway to Heaven”; its gentle acoustic beginning eventually builds to an exhilarating climax featuring a lengthy electric guitar solo. This combination of acoustic and electric sections was typical for the band. The song, which was of epic length by rock standards, appeared on the band’s fourth and most famous album, released untitled in 1971.\n\nWhile Led Zeppelin never received the kind of critical acclaim or mainstream acceptance accorded the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, their influence on rock music has been prodigious. They are regularly cited as the originators of both hard rock and heavy metal. Their sound has been imitated by bands from Black Sabbath to Nirvana. They also inspired hard rock bands to include acoustic elements in their music and were among the first to experiment with Indian and North African music.\n\nThe group disbanded in 1980 after Bonham’s alcohol-related death. The remaining members reunited in 1985 for the Live Aid benefit concert, in 1988 for Atlantic Records’ 40th anniversary celebration, and in 1995 for the band’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2007 Led Zeppelin performed a concert in London to honor Atlantic Records’ cofounder Ahmet Ertegun; Bonham’s son, Jason, played the drums. A live album recorded at that show, Celebration Day (2012), won the band its first Grammy Award (for best rock album) in 2014.\n\nSusan Fast/Ed."
