The Reissues were announced for a long time. By 2014, they're here. At the end of May the albums \"I\" to \"III\" were released, and from October 2014 \"IV\", also known as \"Zoso\", \"Four Symbols\" or \"Untitled\", will be available.\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, bands and labels ticked even faster. Led Zeppelin released one LP after the other in their early years. Three longplayers within 15 months, that is breathtaking by today's standards. Since Led Zeppelin also frequently performed live, all the songs for the first six albums were written between 1968 and the summer of 1972.\n\nThe LPs \"I\" and \"II\" were very successful commercially and in the charts when they were released. \"III\" was not well received in the press and also by the fans. The LP quickly reached the top of the charts in the USA and Great Britain, but sales fell sharply after an initial high. Somehow they resented Led Zeppelin that not every album was the same and sounded the same. That again upset Jimmy Page, who didn't talk to the press for two years. And it led to the fact that the fourth album was released without a title and without any accompanying lyrics.\n\nTherefore there are several titles for \"IV\": \"Zoso\", \"Four Symbols\" or simply \"Untitled\". Many Led Zeppelin fans regard the fourth album as the best of the band from today's point of view. The absolute sales figures confirm this: Among the best-selling albums of all times in the USA it is ranked 3rd. IV\" is a perfect mix of hard and soft, light and dark. With \"Stairway To Heaven\" it contains the most famous number of Led Zeppelin ever, while \"Black Dog\" is the essence of what made up the individual musicians of Led Zeppelin.\n\nReview\n\nAllMusic rating:\n\nAllMusic users:\n\n(8,084 votes)\n\nA1 Black Dog\n\nA2 Rock And Roll\n\nA3 The Battle Of Evermore\n\nA4 Stairway To Heaven\n\nB1 Misty Mountain Hop\n\nB2 Four Sticks\n\nB3 Going To California\n\nB4 When The Levee Breaks"
