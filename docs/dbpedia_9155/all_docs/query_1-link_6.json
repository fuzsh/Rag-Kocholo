        "text": "I thought this was interesting.\n\nMy personal opinion is Led Zeppelin was the most talented group of musicians, closely followed by the Who.\n\nNice reading. Thanks.\n\nIts idiotic to “compare” bands and\n\ntalking about why this band war not in the “same leaque”\n\nThis can do only a \"journalis\"t who was NEVER playing in band and needs to create an article.\n\nSuch comparisons “best” / “worse” are full nonsense.\n\nHow do we call this here :\n\n“Äpfel und Birnen vergleichen”\n\n“Comparing apples and pears”\n\nThat’s your opinion an I do accept it, but I dont agree.\n\nBut we only say here “that’s my opinion”\n\nand others may have other opinions.\n\nAnd this is good.\n\nbtw : We, the band I was playing in, was the most talented band ever,\n\nbut no one knows, only the members!\n\nNice read, thanks.\n\nMy take on the article was it was about what Led Zeppelin’s Bassist said in an interview.\n\nHe was basically saying they focused on music instead of Movies and TV appearances like some of the other bands did.\n\nThere is no need to discuss about, Steve.\n\nI know Led Zeppelin of course.\n\nIts not our task to do any evaluation.\n\nBut let’s take a look to Movies and TV appearance of the bands of today.\n\nToo many.\n\nBut this is show ad money only.\n\nSame would be the question are Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven are playing in the \"same league,\n\nWhat would you say?\n\nI can give you an answer, but only my answer."
