        "text": "10 Things You Might Not Know About Led Zeppelin\n\nLed Zeppelin was formed in London in 1968 and consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. Their heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues on their early albums, has drawn them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal. Although the group was initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with albums such as Led Zeppelin (1969), Led Zeppelin II (1969), Led Zeppelin III (1970), their untitled fourth album (1971), Houses of the Holy (1973), and Physical Graffiti (1975). Their fourth album, which features the track “Stairway to Heaven,” is among the most popular and influential works in rock music, and it helped to cement the popularity of the group.\n\nFlip through the gallery for 10 Things You Might Not Know About Led Zeppelin!\n\nThis gallery uses material from the Wikipedia article Led Zeppelin, which is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0."
