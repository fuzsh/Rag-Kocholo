        "text": "This article is about the band. For their debut album, see Led Zeppelin (album). For other uses, see Led Zeppelin (disambiguation).\n\nLed Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band comprised Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (guitar), John Paul Jones (bass and keyboards) and John Bonham (drums). With a heavy, guitar-driven sound and drawing from influences including blues and folk music, Led Zeppelin are cited as a progenitor of hard rock and heavy metal. They significantly influenced the music industry, particularly the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.\n\nQuick Facts Background information, Origin ...\n\nClose\n\nLed Zeppelin evolved from a previous band, the Yardbirds, and were originally named the New Yardbirds. They signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as \"Good Times Bad Times\", \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"Communication Breakdown\". Led Zeppelin II (1969), their first number-one album, included \"Whole Lotta Love\" and \"Ramble On\". In 1970, they released Led Zeppelin III which opened with \"Immigrant Song\". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history, with 37 million copies sold. It included \"Black Dog\", \"Rock and Roll\" and \"Stairway to Heaven\", with the latter among the most popular and influential works in rock. Houses of the Holy (1973) yielded \"The Song Remains the Same\" and \"Over the Hills and Far Away\". Physical Graffiti (1975), a double album, featured \"The Rover\" and \"Kashmir\".\n\nPage composed most of Led Zeppelin's music, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones occasionally contributed keyboard-focused parts, particularly on the band's final album. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included Presence (1976) and In Through the Out Door (1979), declined in the late 1970s. After Bonham's death in 1980, the group disbanded. The former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off concerts, including the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums."
