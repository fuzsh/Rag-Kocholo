        "text": "The rock band Led Zeppelin (John Paul Jones, Robert Plant, John Bonham and Jimmy Page) poses for a portrait in 1968.\n\nBy the mid-seventies, Led Zeppelin was the most popular rock band in the world. They sold more than 300 million records, and devoured the world with their thunderous sound and their wicked ways. But the group disbanded after the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980.\n\nGuitarist Jimmy Page (center, rear) is photographed with the English rock band Carter-Lewis and the Southerners, c. 1964.\n\nAn art college student, Page became renowned as a session player comfortable in many different genres, from rockabilly to rock 'n' roll to acoustic blues and electric blues\n\nBass guitarist John Paul Jones (pictured here in 1969) was also working as a session player when his wife saw a notice in a music newspaper that Jimmy Page was forming a band. \"I was doing so much work in sessions - I don't know, 20 20 sessions a week, I was going completely crazy and burning out,\" Page explained to Mason. \"So she said, 'Why don't you call him up? See if he needs a bass player.' And I went, 'You gotta be crazy. I've got too much work going on, I can't do this.'\"\n\nBut Page did call: \"[Jones] said, 'I'm going up to the Village to see a singer and we think he knows a drummer. I'll tell you what they're like when I get back.' And he came back, said, 'They're amazing. Come on, let's go and rehearse.'\"\n\nThe singer was Robert Plant. He had played with drummer John Bonham in the Band of Joy, when he was recruited by Jones to join his new band.\n\nJones recalled to Mason their first rehearsal together: \"So Page suggested a thing, he said, 'Well, there's a thing we used to do with the Yardbirds called 'Train Kept A-Rollin'' which is basically a blues sequence with this riff. So he just counted in, 'Three, four ...' and just like, whoa, the room just exploded.\n\n\"I mean, rhythm section particularly are always, like, wary in a new situation,\" he laughed. \"Because you've gotta work really closely together. And so I'm thinking, 'Oh, I wonder what the drummer's like.' And he was probably thinking, 'I wonder what the bass player's like.' But within, I don't know, four bars, we all knew - 'Oh, thank goodness for that. This is gonna work. This is great.'\"\n\nGuitarist Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, photographed in London in December 1968.\n\nA poster advertising a 1969 concert at Fillmore West in San Francisco starring Country Joe & The Fish, Led Zeppelin, and Taj Mahal.\n\nLed Zeppelin's first album, first released in the U.S. by Atlantic Records in January 1969. Songs included \"Good Times Bad Times,\" \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"Communication Breakdown\" and \"I Can't Quit You Baby.\"\n\nJimmy Page of Led Zeppelin in pictured in a recording studio with Robert Plant and John Paul Jones, May 23, 1969.\n\nThe second studio album by Led Zeppelin, released in October 1969. Songs featured included \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"Ramble On\" and \"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman).\"\n\nThe band made its name on the underground circuit of touring, and by American FM radio (given that their recorded output did not led itself easily to bite-sized pop hits for AM radio play). \"FM radio was alive and well at this point of time, and they were playing whole album sides, for heaven's sake,\" Page told Mason. \"They don't have some silly tune, singles. You could hear people's work properly. It was so refreshing to be in a tour bus, listening to, like, the local FM station and saying, 'Yes, this is what we've all been about in music. It's really surfaced. And it's there, it's alive and well.' And then you go back to England, be faced with doing some silly single.\n\n\"So I'd learned that the thing to do was to be making albums. And sure, okay, something needs to be played on the AM station for heralding the fact that there's an album. Well, so be it. But we're not gonna concentrate on singles because we're gonna concentrate on the albums.\"\n\nBassist John Paul Jones and drummer John Bonham of the British rock group Led Zeppelin perform at the Bath Festival, Shepton Mallet, June 28, 1970.\n\nGuitarist Jimmy Page of the rock band Led Zeppelin holds court at a press conference before their show at the Forum on September 4, 1970 in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\n\"Led Zeppelin III,\" released in October 1970. The album included \"Immigrant Song,\" \"That's the Way,\" and \"Since I've Been Loving You.\"\n\nLead singer Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin performs on stage at Madison Square Garden on September 3, 1971 in New York City.\n\n\"Led Zeppelin IV,\" released November 1971, featured the songs \"Stairway to Heaven,\" \"Black Dog,\" and \"When the Levee Breaks.\"\n\nPage said \"Stairway to Heaven\" - one of the most-played pieces of music on the radio, despite a length of over eight minutes - was not released as a single. \"There was no way it could be edited\" said Page. \"\"It started off at one tempo, and then accelerates all the way through. So it was impossible, really, to do edits on it that would be convincing.\"\n\nWhen asked to explain its popularity, he suggested it was because\n\nThe rock band Led Zeppelin performs onstage 1972.
