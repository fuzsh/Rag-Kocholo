        "text": "You may know Led Zeppelin as one of the most iconic bands of all time, but did you know that Jimmy Page chose the band’s moniker as a defiant message to anyone who didn’t believe in them?\n\nThe story behind Led Zeppelin’s name is known by hardcore rock fans and your uncle who had an ear piercing in the 70s, but many more casual fans have never stopped to think about the bizarre epithet.\n\nIn fact, the source and reason behind the name is often a subject of hot debate on Reddit, with many believing that Jimmy Page came up with the name on his own while other’s claim that The Who’s Keith Moon was responsible.\n\nUser @Wuzzy_Gee wrote, ‘I would say Keith Moon inspired the name,’ a claim thatwas rebutted by user @smashthehandcock who posted: ‘My grandfather used to say, “Well that went down like a led zeppelin or balloon.”‘\n\nAnother user, @smurf_cherries, agreed: ‘”That went over like a lead balloon” is a very old saying. They just turned a common idiom into a band name.’\n\nIn reality, the story of the iconic name is a combination of these factors and features appearances by an array of famous rockers, making it one of the most legendary origin stories in music history.\n\nWhy is Led Zeppelin called Led Zeppelin?\n\nThe tale of the band’s creation begins in 1966, when The Who’s Keith Moon and his bandmate, bassist John Entwistle, recorded the track Beck’s Bolero with Jimmy Page, multi-instrumentalist John Paul Jones, and The Yardbirds’ Jeff Beck.\n\nThe musicians were so pleased with the track that they considered forming a brand new band.\n\nAccording to legend, Moon joked that the band would never work, in fact, it would go down ‘like a lead balloon,’ a quip that stuck with Page through the years.\n\nA year later in 1967, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones began to take the idea of forming a new band more seriously.\n\nPage was fresh off his time playing for the Yardbirds, a legendary band that was responsible for launching the careers of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, and of course, Page himself.\n\nIn 1965 Clapton left the Yardbirds and recommended Page, then just a session guitarist, as a new member for the band. Page spent about two years playing lead guitar alongside his childhood friend Jeff Beck and then as the group’s only lead guitar when Beck suddenly left the group in the middle of a tour.\n\nAfter Beck’s departure and another tour, the group broke up despite their success, leaving Page with lots of rock n roll in his soul but nowhere to put it.\n\nThe band we know as Led Zeppelin today began to emerge from the marble in August of 1968 when Page invited vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham to join him and Jones on their new project.\n\nIn September of that year, the group played a tour of Scandinavia – funded out of Page’s own pocket – under the name the New Yardbirds.\n\nThe band was soon forced to change their name after Chris Dreja, one of the founding members of the Yardbirds, issued a cease and desist letter, stating that Page was only allowed to use the New Yardbirds title for the Scandinavian tour.\n\nAccording to Page, he was intentionally concealing the band’s new name during this time anyway.\n\nInspired by Keith Moon’s comment about the band going down like a lead balloon, Page had landed on the name Led Zeppelin for his new group. It was obviously meant as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the astronomical odds stacked against a new band. But in reclaiming an idiom that means something is unpopular, the group found their identity.\n\nPage upgraded the idiom from balloon to the largest inflatable of all: a zeppelin, which is an airship similar to a blimp.At the suggestion of music manager Peter Grant, the guitarist decided to drop the ‘a’ in lead so that the uninitiated wouldn’t pronounce it ‘leed.’\n\nIconic music journalist Keith Shadwick later praised the imagery the name conjured, calling it ‘the perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace.’\n\nPage told Ultimate Guitar of the name: ‘It was a name that Keith Moon had mentioned back then…And I asked him if we could use the name because I was gonna be in this band Led Zeppelin with Keith Moon, so was Jeff Beck.’\n\nHe continued: ‘So when we were playing in Scandinavia we were out there as New Yardbirds, it was a cloak of invisibility really.\n\n‘And even on the first recordings, it said New Yardbirds on the box because I didn’t want anybody to know what the name of the band was until we really officially unveiled it. And [the first album] was it.’\n\nThat one fateful day recording Beck’s Bolero in 1966, which left such an impression on Page, can be credited for much of Led Zeppelin’s eventual culmination.\n\nPage told David Fricke in 2012 of that day recording: ‘This session was absolutely magnificent, like a force of nature. Keith was having troubles in the Who. He’s going, “We should form a band with this.”‘\n\nIn fact, in opposition to the commonly held idea that Page had been inspired by Moon’s comment but eventually came up with the name himself, Page credited Moon exclusively: ‘“We can call it Led Zeppelin,”‘ Page remembered the drummer saying.\n\n‘”Because it can only go down, like a lead balloon.” I thought it was a great name, and I didn’t forget it,’ he concluded.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : The Mr Men and Little Miss universe has got two brand new characters\n\nMORE : Eurovision and Black Lace singer Colin Gibb dies aged 70"
