        "text": "I have a copy of Led Zeppelin IV with matrix numbers that match Side A, Variant 1 and Side B, Variant 2 as listed here: Led Zeppelin – Untitled (1971, Monarch Pressing, Vinyl)\n\nThis Discog's item is listed as a 1971 US pressing. However, the labels on my record do not match the labels listed on the above Discog's item. My record has the address for Atlantic Recording Corp as \"75 Rockefeller Plaza\" which based on what I've been able to gather from SHMF and other audio sites would have only been used on second pressings or later.\n\nNo other pressing listed on Discogs matches the matrix number that my record has.\n\nSo, do I have a first pressing (based on my matrix numbers) but people are wrong that first pressing ONLY used the \"1841 Broadway\" address?\n\nOr do I have a second pressing (based on the label address) and I just have a unique pressing (based on the matrix numbers/label combination) that doesn't currently have a page created yet on Discogs?\n\nYou’ve got a 1974 or later pressing. 1975 or later if it has a WEA logo on the label edge. You have probably a 4th or 5th press really, since this was a very popular album and sold well. Could sound good, could sound bad. You’ll have to play it to find out. I have an early Pecko/Pecko Duck that sounds good but is on noisy vinyl so it doesn’t just come down to it being early or late.\n\nWell as has been said, the 75 Rockefeller address came about in 1974. As far as matrices, its not uncommon to see matrices from the early master discs continuing in production for about 5 years. No doubt many were made and who knows how many mothers and stampers were generated. A lot for sure. As far as sound quality the only way to tell with a multi million selling record like this is to compare one against another and pick the one that sounds best. The general rule: the earlier the better, is a good one but not absolute in every case.\n\nMy pressing has:\n\nSide A Matrix: ST-A-712285-DD AT/GP MR circled (stamped) △16345 (2-a) (2) PR PECKO [the (2) is scratched out]\n\nSide B Matrix: ST-A-712286-FF Pecko Duck AT/GP MR circled (stamped) △16345-X PR (3)\n\nLabel has the address as 75 Rockefeller Plaza and it does NOT have an WEA logo on the label\n\nThe seller listed this record as a first press. I'm trying to decide if I should return it to them as it is not a first press and then purchase from another seller an actual first pressing. Or, if the sound quality is likely to still be equivalent to a first pressing, just stick with what I received. As I mentioned originally, I'm not going to be able to actually play the record I have until Friday as my turntable is out for repairs until then.\n\nAny additional thoughts are welcome.\n\nFirst, I would seek a price adjustment as it was not as advertised.\n\nThat is actually the mastering that I prefer, FWIW.\n\nAs far as SQ goes, it really depends on the shape of the mothers that they made stampers from by this time. It may not sound quite as fresh as an earlier press, but has the potential to get very close.\n\nAnd while I don't usually think pressing plants matter, Monarch might work to your advantage as they produced fewer records than other plants so metal work may have been fresher?"
