        "text": "I'm a huge fan of Def Leppard since 1983, so theses aren't meant as insults, but mere observations.\n\nLed Zeppelin was pretty much the band all up and coming hard rock bands were influenced by and wanted to be somewhat like by the mid to late 70s. Leppard was no different, but maybe these things went over some heads.\n\n1. The sound of their name, Def Leppard.\n\nIt flows like Led Zeppelin. Two words, three syllables.\n\nYou can even abbreviate them to rhyme. Led Zep and Def Lep.\n\n2. The spelling of their name. The first word is spelled wrong (actually Def and Leppard are both spelled wrong, but that's unrelated) Deaf drops the A to be Def, just like Lead drops the A to be Led.\n\n3. The song Oveture.\n\nI've always believed this was them wanting to have their own Stairway to Heaven type song. I think Aerosmith did the same with Dream On. By no means am I claiming Overture rips Stairway off. It actually has held up over the years as it's own unique track. I just feel like they were young, impressionable kids at the time and wanted to create their own sort of epic.\n\n4. Having the name of a previous album title be the name of a song on the following album.\n\nZeppelin did this with Houses of the Holy being a song on it's follow up, Physical Graffiti. Leppard did it with On Through the Night being on the follow up, High n Dry\n\nOmg, I actually remember in Hit Parader or Circus magazine in 1983, some fan sent in a letter they printed that said Move over Led Zep, it's Time for Def Lep. At the time I thought that was stupid, since Zeppelin wasn't even active anymore to move over. I guess he just meant in terms of recognition, which was still dumb.\n\nI don't think beyond the name there's much connection and even influence.\n\nI saw them support AC/DC before the first album came out. Musically nothing like Zeppelin and they were clearly in terms of image copying UFO mainly with an Alex Lifeson shaggy perm circa '78 thrown in. Their influences were well documented from Glam via Purple to Lizzy/UFO era song writing HM. I've always thought they were a really sub par band who were just in the vacuum of HM needing a new generation and obviously the influence of Mutt Lange cracked things for them.\n\nBest of luck to them but ultimately absolutely third tier when compared to Zep and to be fair to them I don't think they would argue they were at that level."
