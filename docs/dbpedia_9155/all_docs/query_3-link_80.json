        "text": "\"Led Zeppelin's music was always on the move,\" Robert Plant once told MOJO. \"It was never just, 'Here's a little ditty and it's going to have the same lick as all our other songs...'\" Indeed, during the band's imperial 12-year reign, no two albums ever sounded the same. And as their music pinwheeled between apocalyptic heavy rock, blues, folk and balladry, it never stopped moving. Here, MOJO's world-class team of writers have charted that journey and assembled what we think is the definitive list of Zeppelin's greatest ever songs. We hope you enjoy the ride...\n\nLed Zeppelin Interviewed: “We couldn’t do a Led Zeppelin reunion unless the singer was there. Quite clearly we’re there, but he’s not…”\n\n50 In The Evening\n\n(In Through The Out Door, 1979)\n\nPrefacing its John Paul Jones-penned main section with a spooky, Page-led collage of Eastern-sounding guitars, treated tympani and bass-pedal drones, the opener on Zeppelin’s ‘comeback’ album, In Through The Out Door, might Zeppelin’s last great studio hurrah.\n\n49 Gallows Pole\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nBased on Leadbelly’s Gallis Pole, in Zeppelin’s hands it became a an ancient-sounding fusion of folk, rock and blues with a nifty banjo solo from Page.\n\n48 For Your Life\n\n(Presence, 1976)\n\nA deep cut from 1976, For Your Life captures the sound of a band on the brink. Dosed up on painkillers following a car accident, Plant sings a cautionary lyric about the antics of one of the band’s LA groupies, a woozy, see-sawing riff from Page adding to the atmosphere of blurred disorientation.\n\n47 That’s The Way\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nAn acoustic rambling reverie with an ecological edge, the prettiest moment on the folk-tinged Led Zeppelin III is a song of resignation and heartbreak, influenced by Neil Young’s early albums and driven along by a simple strummed acoustic guitar.\n\n46 Thank You\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nWritten for his wife, Maureen, Plant’s song of homely gratitude is lush and textured, and boasts a stamp of classicism.\n\n45 Dancing Days\n\n(Houses Of The Holy, 1973)\n\nA radio favourite in the US, Dancing Days’ twisting riff was inspired by a melody Page and Plant had encountered in India while playing with the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in February 1972.\n\n44 How Many More Times\n\n(Led Zeppelin, 1969)\n\nThe final track from Zeppelin’s 1969 is an eight-and-a-half minute Page and Bonham tour de force. Page combined various song ideas he’d been working on through the ‘60s to catapult the band into the next decade.\n\n43 Celebration Day\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nSwept away by blues-rock and roots Americana, psychedelia may have fallen out of haute-rock fashion by the end of the 60s, but for Led Zeppelin its memory lingered on. Evident on the disorientating speed-rush of Robert Plant’s love letter to the Big Apple.\n\n42 Black Mountain Side\n\n(Led Zeppelin, 1969)\n\nA self-confessed Bert Jansch obsessive, Jimmy Page upset members of the folk community after borrowing both tune and arrangement from Jansch’s unorthodox finger-style treatment of the Irish traditional song Blackwater Side, and passing them off as his own. An oversight that doesn’t detract from the dexterous beauty of Page’s playing here which established Led Zeppelin as an unlikely but cog in the folk process.\n\n41 The Wanton Song\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nWhen it comes to sexual abandonment, few albums depict the spoils of the road as candidly as Physical Graffiti. Indeed, Plant’s opening couplet on The Wanton Song leaves little to the imagination. “Silent woman in the night, you came/Took my seed from my shaking frame!” screeches the singer over a funky reboot of the Immigrant Song riff.\n\n40 I Can’t Quit You Baby\n\n(Led Zeppelin, 1969)\n\nChicago blues translated via the ‘Surrey Delta’, I Can’t Quit You Baby was a blueprint for the relationship that developed between Plant’s voice and Page’s guitar. The slow, grinding blues tune (a take on Otis Rush’s 1966 version of a song written by Willie Dixon) became a stalwart of Zep’s early live set, evolving and changing almost nightly.\n\n39 The Song Remains The Same\n\n(Houses Of The Holy, 1973)\n\nRecorded in summer 1972 at Mick Jagger’s country pile, Stargroves, The Song Remains The Same began life as an instrumental fanfare. After Plant heard the work in progress, however, he insisted writing a lyric, turning it into a rambling hymn to the band’s globe-trotting adventures. It also, of course, provide Zeppelin with the name for their movie.\n\n38 Living Loving Maid (She’s Just A Woman)\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nOriginally titled Livin’ Lovin’ Wreck – a title inspired by a persistent older female admirer – this track has never been fully embraced by the band. Their scorn may be due to the fact that it’s also the closest that Zep have ever come to a bona fide pop song.\n\n37 In The Light\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nRegret, optimism and a need to escape the dark stuff combine on this beguiling West Coast-influenced track. Plant is on record as saying it’s his favourite Physical Graffiti track and one of the best things the band ever did.\n\n36 Moby Dick\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nA rare moment where a drum solo actually appears on a studio tune, the rapacious Moby Dick became a vehicle for John Bonham’s percussive mastery and, live, stretched out into a 20-minute tour de force. The fact that the studio version remains a fan-favourite is a testament to Bonzo’s eternal popularity.\n\n35 Bring It On Home\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nThe closing track on II was intended as homage to Willie Dixon’s song of the same name, released in 1963 by Sonny Boy Williamson. Although the lack of acknowledgement led to a lawsuit, ultimately, the tune is defined by the core of the song; Page’s swinging stop-start multitracked riff and Plant’s joyous vocal combining with Bonham and Jones’s deft percussive interplay.\n\n34 Bron Y-Aur Stomp\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nThe acoustic country-honk of Robert Plant’s ode to his dog, Strider, is supported by the singer’s lyrical nod to Red Foley and Arthur Willis’s 1933 sentimental canine classic, Old Shep, later covered by Elvis.\n\n33 Trampled Underfoot\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nOpenly inspired by Stevie Wonder, the mischief suggested by its working title, Scotch And Coke, is evident in the thick, glammy funk melange of wah-wah guitar and clavinet.\n\n32 Custard Pie\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nRobert Plant drew on Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee Custard Pie Blues and Bukka White’s Shake ’Em On Down for this lascivious blues. His mean, distorted mouthharp combines with Jimmy Page’s fierce solo, played through an ARP synthesizer, to deliver a sound as filthy as the lyrics.\n\n31 Sick Again\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nA chronicle of time ill-spent in and out of Sunset Strip’s Riot House, the final track on Physical Graffiti is a paean to the road excesses that defined Zep’s tours from 1970 onwards. The opening smack-you-in-the-face, proto-punk riff drops to a mid-pace groove where Bonzo follows Page’s lead to create the track’s pummelling momentum.\n\n30 Houses Of The Holy\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nFamously a last-minute exclusion from the album that shares its title, Houses Of The Holy was also one of the few old tracks pulled into Physical Graffiti’s orbit that required no extra work. Recorded three years before at Electric Lady, its compact groove and slinky, jazzy riff nestled far more comfortably among Physical Graffiti’s myriad stylistic changes than its predecessor's proggier elements.\n\n29 Four Sticks\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\nA boogie-jam in 5/8 and 6/8 time inspired by Ginger Baker’s drum battle with John Coltrane’s rhythmic mastermind Elvin Jones, Four Sticks is named after the number of drumsticks John Bonham employed to create the track’s relentless momentum.\n\nREAD: THE MYSTERY OF LED ZEPPELIN IV'S ARTWORK REVEALED AT LAST!\n\n28 The Lemon Song\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nRetooling Howlin’ Wolf’s Killing Floor with a half-borrowed lyric from Robert Johnson, The Lemon Song is typical of Zeppelin’s ability to take clear influences and alchemise them into something fresh via their own extraordinary dynamics. The whole band is on fire here, but John Paul John’s almost McCartney-esque bassline – supposedly recorded in one take – just about steals the show.\n\n27 The Ocean\n\n(Houses Of The Holy, 1973)\n\nA joyful tribute to Zeppelin’s ocean of fans, to rock’n’roll and its glorious doggerel, and to Plant’s daughter Carmen, “only three years old” in a nod to Chuck Berry’s Marie in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n26 What Is And What Should Never Be\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nPlant’s half-whispered, phased vocal is both seductive and covert, the invitation to his lady friend to visit his nearby castle sounding playful as well as slightly absurd on a song of alleged deep confession. It’s one of the singer’s all-time favourite Zep tunes.\n\n25 Babe I’m Gonna Leave You\n\n(Led Zeppelin, 1969)\n\nJimmy Page adds baroque grandeur to Joan Baez’s take on a folk standard. The band’s explosive dynamic is topped by a breath-taking vocal from Plant.\n\n24 The Battle Of Evermore\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\nThe apogee of Zeppelin’s folk enchantment. Jimmy Page had declared Fairport Convention’s l Liege & Lief as his favourite album of 1969 and here singer Sandy Denny duets with Plant over a thorny hedgerow of mandolin. Amazingly, Page had never actually played the instrument before picking up John Paul Jones’ and idly improvising the hypnotic tune.\n\n23 Communication Breakdown\n\n(Led Zeppelin, 1969)\n\nAn attempt to update the delinquent excitement of rock and roll with late 60s technology and power, Communication Breakdown was an early Zeppelin keystone and highlighted the combined organised strength that separated them from their Brit Blues contemporaries. Nothing here is wasted, and its raw power sounds almost proto-punk compared to the high quality production Page usually favoured for the band.\n\n22 Misty Mountain Hop\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\nA hippy allegory, like Lord Of The Rings itself.\n\nMisty Mountain Hop was a rare piece of politics from Led Zeppelin criticising The Man’s attitude to dope (albeit couched in Plant’s J.R.R. Tolkien imagery). The band never quite got to grips with the song live, and even the album version was less than perfect: at 2.11 Page, Jones and Bonham briefly lose touch with each other while Plant elongates the lyrics to compensate, but the rest of the take was too good to waste.\n\n21 Tangerine\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nWhile Tangerine harks back to Page’s time with The Yardbirds this updated version is also one of the most beautiful songs recorded by Zeppelin. The melodies are hazy yet sharp, Plant’s double tracked vocals adding to the love-lost nature of the lyric. One of the band’s understated gems.\n\n20 Friends\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nPlayed live only once, Friends has a cryptic lyric that owes a lot, including its apocalyptic opening image and repeated ‘ing’ line endings, to Dylan’s It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding). Temperamentally sunny, Plant has positive advice to lighten the gloom, but, disdaining cheerfulness, the music’s foreboding never relents.\n\n19 In My Time Of Dying\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nThe longest studio track on all of Zeppelin’s albums is also one of their most spontaneous. A lose, almost sloppy swamp blues boogie that proved for all of Page’s studio genius, the heart of Zeppelin’s majesty was always its four members playing together in a room.\n\n18 Heartbreaker\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nThe definition of a Zeppelin crowd-pleaser. Page’s twanging, low-slung riff is so fabulously deviant, that you wonder why nobody invented parental advisory stickers until 1984. For all its lyrical foreplay, it’s the song’s titular heartbreaker who has the power here, Golden God Plant clearly put out when she calls him “by another guy’s name” at the most delicate of moments.\n\n17 Going To California\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\nA delicate love letter to the West Coast, and to Laurel Canyon’s first lady, Joni Mitchell, reputed to be the “queen… [who] plays guitars and cries and sings”. While Plant would later confess its dreamy lyric “a bit embarrassing, at times”, he still performs the song solo today.\n\n16 Ten Years Gone\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nRobert Plant’s nostalgic lyric and restrained vocal is offset by a dynamic wall of sound here from Page who overdubbed his guitar 14 times to resemble an orchestral string section\n\n15 Over The Hills And Far Away\n\n(Houses Of The Holy, 1973)\n\nA softly-strummed Bron Y Aur acoustic number is electrified in the studio. Plant marries a courtly feel to the battle-weariness of a touring rock star in the lyrics to what is possibly Zeppelin’s most elegant mid-period tune.\n\n14 Good Times Bad Times\n\n(Led Zeppelin, 1969)\n\nHard, knowing, rueful and propelled by the virtuoso stampede of John Bonham, track one, side one of Led Zeppelin first album is a shot of pure adrenalin - setting out both Zeppelin’s future and that of the incoming decade.\n\n13 No Quarter\n\n(Houses Of The Holy, 1973)\n\nThe exquisitely slothful creep of No Quarter – with Page’s slithering guitar and Plant’s ghostly murmurings of Viking death fleets emerging from eerie mists of mellotron conjured by John Paul Jones – became a live vehicle for inspired instrumental improvisations from Jones over the years. He must have been bemused then when Page and Plant chose the song as the title track of their 1994 reunion album, from which he was infamously excluded.\n\n12 Immigrant Song\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nIf, like Apocalypse Now’s Wagner-blasting fleet of choppers, Viking longships had come equipped with speakers in the 9th century then Immigrant Song’s wail and thunder would have been the only choice to strike terror into those about to be plundered. An instance of words and music in perfect synergy.\n\n11 The Rain Song\n\n(House Of The Holy, 1973)\n\n“The problem with you guys is that you never do ballads,” George Harrison told Led Zeppelin in the early ’70s. “I’ll give him a ballad,” Page thought, later quoting Harrison’s Something on The Rain Song’s first two chords. Page’s after-the-storm acoustic strum and swooning lead find perfect match in Jones’s symphonic mellotron, and Plant’s croons to heart-melting effect. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, George.\n\n10 Rock And Roll\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\nRock And Roll’s lyrics reference The Book Of Love, Walking In The Moonlight and The Stroll. As steeped in the band’s formative influences as it is, though, it sounds as good as any of the classic tracks it nods to. Simple, sexy, feral and - from the opening seconds of Little Richard Keep A Knockin’ drum beat at the beginning - an absolute blast.\n\n9 Ramble On\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\nPage’s jangly acoustic intro, Bonham seemingly tapping the rhythm with bare hands on a guitar case, Jones picking moody bass runs while Plant delves deep into his psyche to deliver mysterious references to Gollum, Mordor and other Tolkien… Ramble On is the very definition of what the guitarist calls “light and shade”.\n\n8 Achilles Last Stand\n\n(Presence, 1976)\n\nArguably the last undeniable Zeppelin epic, Achilles Last Stand proceeds at a gallop, but as Bonham’s fills underline, the ‘hammer of the gods’ is wielded with dazzling precision. The thrillingly intense, improvisation-friendly tune became a staple of Zeppelin live shows until the band’s 1980 demise.\n\n7 Dazed And Confused\n\n(Led Zeppelin, 1969)\n\n“There are certain songs that have to be here, and this is one of them,” said Robert Plant introducing this tune at Zeppelin’s 2007 O2 show. Clocking in at 11 minutes and 44 seconds, it remains the epitome of Zep’s early dynamism, and a template for more expansive adventures\n\n(Led Zeppelin III, 1970)\n\nZeppelin’s live-in-the-studio aesthetic is fully evident on this slow blues which begins with a beautiful Page solo, underpinned by Jones’s Hammond organ and Bonham’s steady rolling. Remarkably enough, an earlier, alternative version that appears on III’s recent reissue is arguably even more emotive than the original album version.\n\n5 Black Dog\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\n4 Stairway To Heaven\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\nAt just over eight minutes, Stairway To Heaven is an astonishing piece that has become over familiar and yet, no matter how many times it’s played, Page’s guitar solo still seems to come in at the most unexpected moment (at 5:56), shifting the tone of the music and driving the song on to an exalted climax. The most requested song in the history of American FM radio it still remains evergreen.\n\n3 Whole Lotta Love\n\n(Led Zeppelin II, 1969)\n\n2 When The Levee Breaks\n\n(Led Zeppelin IV, 1971)\n\nLed Zeppelin’s music has the power to evoke wonder at the mercilessness of nature, and never more so than on When The Levee Breaks. Based on 1928 recording by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy, Page turned the song inside out and created an elemental masterpiece. John Bonham famously set-up at the bottom of the stairwell creating one of the most evocative drum performances of all time; a booming, omnipresent forewarning of inescapable danger around which all the other parts layer and build.\n\n1 Kashmir\n\n(Physical Graffiti, 1975)\n\nIn a 1988 interview with MOJO’s Robert Fricke, Robert Plant gently knocked back a suggestion that Stairway To Heaven was Zeppelin’s finest song. “It’s a nice, pleasant, well-meaning naive little song, very English,” he smiled. “It’s not the definitive Led Zeppelin song - Kashmir is.” Who are we to argue? A sweeping, swirling storm of strange magic, Kashmir was dense with everything at which Zeppelin excelled: ancient blues, psychedelic dreaming and signature brawn, charged with new, exotic risk. Their greatest on every count.\n\nIf you want to dive deeper into Zeppelin's music and the stories behind it, MOJO's two Led Zeppelin specials are now available in one sumptuous volume - LED ZEPPELIN: MOTHERSHIP 1968-2022 Deluxe Anthology Edition is in shops and available to buy HERE."
