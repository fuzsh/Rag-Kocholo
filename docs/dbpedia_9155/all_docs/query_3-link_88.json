        "text": "Zeppelin drummer John Bonham died in 1980 - where was his last show with the band and what did they play?\n\nIt's now more than 40 years since Led Zeppelin officially disbanded. The legendary rock band has reunited on several occasions - notably at Live Aid in 1985 and again for a charity event in 2007 which entered the record books as the \"Highest Demand For Tickets For One Music Concert\" after 20 million requests hit the O2's website.\n\nThis event was held in tribute to Ahmet Ertegun, the man behind Zeppelin's record label, Atlantic, who had died the previous year. The O2 show marked Led Zeppelin's first full-length performance since the death of their drummer John Bonham nearly three decades earlier. For the night, his place was taken by his son, Jason.\n\nJohn Bonham died on 25th September 1980, aged just 32 years old. The tragedy came just as Led Zep were about to head out on a North American tour, their first for three years.\n\nZeppelin had issued their final studio album, In Through The Out Door, in the summer of 1979. It wasn't an easy time for the band - despite being one of the biggest rock acts of the decade, the death of Robert Plant's young son in 1977, other personal issues and an enforced exile from the UK for tax reasons had put a strain on the group. Alongside this, there was also the issue of Bonham's alcoholism. Always a big drinker, the drummer was finding the stress of being on the road difficult and turned to booze.\n\nDespite all this, Led Zeppelin performed two enormous shows in August 1979 at Knebworth. It turned out that this pair of dates (4th and 11th August 1979) would be the band's final UK concerts.\n\nIn June 1980, Zeppelin began a short tour of arenas in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. However, when they got to Nuremberg on 27th June, John Bonham's health problems caught up with him.\n\nThey began the show as usual with covers of The Train Kept A-Rollin' and Nobody's Fault But Mine, but during the third song, Black Dog, it was apparently that Bonham wasn't well.\n\nJimmy Page introduced the song by saying: \"There's two of us tonight who aren't feeling at all well. A bit of stomach trouble, so we're gonna do our best, whatever, as usual...\"\n\nListening back to the tape of the evening, you can hear that Bonham's usually unflappable timing has gone and the song sounds a mess. But they finish the tune and Robert Plant starts to introduce the next song, In The Evening.\n\nHowever, Bonham has collapsed and fallen off his drum stool. \"We've just got a slight technical problem if you can bear with us,\" Plant says, nervously. \"We just have a minute problem, so if you can wait patiently, we'd be very grateful. Hang on.\"\n\nThe show didn't resume and ended there. Bizarrely, one of the official reasons given for Bonham's collapse was that he'd eaten 27 bananas, apparently because he needed some potassium. A number of fans who were at the show, however, have claimed that the drummer looked drunk on the night.\n\nThe tour was picked up a couple of days later and wound up at Berlin's Eissporthalle on 7th July. This would be John Bonham's final show with Led Zeppelin. This is what they played:\n\nLed Zeppelin at Eissporthalle, Berlin, Germany 7th July 1980 setlist\n\nThe Train Kept A-Rollin'\n\nNobody's Fault But Mine\n\nBlack Dog\n\nIn The Evening\n\nThe Rain Song\n\nHot Dog\n\nAll My Love\n\nTrampled Under Foot\n\nSince I've Been Loving You\n\nWhite Summer / Black Mountain Side\n\nKashmir\n\nStairway To Heaven\n\nEncore\n\nRock And Roll\n\nWhole Lotta Love\n\nWith the European tour over, Led Zeppelin retreated to rehearse for their forthcoming North American dates.\n\nOn 24th September 1980, Bonham was taken to Bray Studios in Berkshire, where Zeppelin were rehearsing. On the way there, according to his assistant Rex King, Bonham asked to stop \"for breakfast\" and ate a ham roll accompanied by four quadruple vodkas.\n\nThe drummer kept drinking throughout the day and when the rehearsal was over, the group returned to Jimmy Page's house in Windsor. By midnight, Bonham was out cold and was taken to bed. When Zeppelin's tour manager and bassist John Paul Jones went to wake him the next afternoon, they discovered that he'd died in the night.\n\nAn inquest ruled that Bonham had died through inhaling vomit after drinking \"about 40 measures\" of vodka in 12 hours. Doctors found no other recreational drugs in his body.\n\nNot surprisingly, the US tour was cancelled. On 4th December 1980, the surviving members of Led Zeppelin issued a statement: \"We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and the deep sense of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue as we were.\"\n\nIt was the end of one of the greatest rock bands in history."
