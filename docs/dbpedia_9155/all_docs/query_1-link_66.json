        "text": "Bradley Thachuk, conductor\n\nRandy Jackson, lead vocals\n\nGeorge Cintron, guitar & vocals\n\nDan Clemens, bass\n\nPowell Randolph, drums\n\nIt’s the return of one of our most in-demand rock shows that always sells out! Astounding vocalist Randy Jackson fronts a rock band in collaboration with the BPO for another popular Windborne Production. Classic hits like Kashmir, Good Times, Black Dog, Stairway to Heaven, and more – plus rock lighting create the ultimate rock show.\n\nProgram to be announced from the stage.\n\nRandy Jackson is the lead singer and guitarist for the rock band, Zebra. Randy’s first foray into recording success began with the self-titled Zebra debut album, released on Atlantic Records in 1983. Critically acclaimed for its lush rock sounds, due in large part to Jackson’s searing lead vocals and soaring guitar leads, the album sold 75,000 copies in its first week. “Who’s Behind the Door” and “Tell Me What You Want,” written by Jackson, received serious notice in the press and helped to form legions of Zebra fans almost instantly. The latest Zebra release, “Zebra IV,” was also produced and engineered by Jackson.\n\nRandy toured as keyboardist, guitarist, and backing vocalist in 1989 with the original, reunited Jefferson Airplane in their last tour together. He has also worked extensively in the areas of musical software and hardware development.\n\nHaving grown up in New York, George has played in numerous bands throughout the Tri-state area since 1976. In 1981, George founded Cintron. Developing the band into one of the top live acts around, he played over 1,500 shows including appearances with Zebra, Twisted Sister, Rat Race Choir, Ritchie Blackmore, Joe Perry, Edgar and Johnny Winter, and Mountain. He released a self-titled EP in 1983.\n\nFor three years George performed guitar and vocals for Enrique Iglesias. Over the course of three world tours, he performed over 150 concerts and numerous television programs, including The Tonight Show and Dick Clark’s New Year’s Eve special. Milestones include playing Madison Square Garden and the American Music Awards.\n\nIn 1995 he was a founding member, along with Danny Miranda and Bobby Rondinelli, of Pyramid. The group is still together. In 2000 he joined the West coast tour of the Trans-Siberian Orchestra for their annual tour. George is also an accomplished studio musician, having recorded with artists including Blue Oyster Cult, Leslie West, Danger Danger, and The Good Rats.\n\nGeorge joined Windborne’s Music of Led Zeppelin Tour in 2004, and has been involved in writing and recording various original projects since 2000.\n\nDan Clemens has been playing bass since the age of 13. A 1989 graduate of Berklee College of Music, he has performed in bands throughout the United States. In 1993 he formed Waterworks, which received the Budweiser Best Unsigned Band sponsorship for the next two years.\n\nClemens has also recorded radio and television jingles, along with independent music CDs. He has toured with the Virginia Opera and performed with the Virginia Symphony and Chorus. His bands have opened for various musical acts including Fleetwood Mac, Little Feet, Del Amitri, The Romantics, and The Hooters. Clemens has also performed with Elliot Easton of The Cars and Robbie Krieger of The Doors. A bass player with Windborne Music since its beginning, he has played with orchestras all over the world in cities such as Atlanta, Denver, Detroit, Toronto, Los Angeles, and Kuala Lumpur.\n\nPowell has been a professional musician and instructor for over 14 years. A 1989 graduate of Berklee College of Music, Powell majored in songwriting with a concentration in percussion performance. Powell’s classical and orchestral resume includes performances with the Virginia Symphony and the Virginia Opera, in addition to the BPO.\n\nAs a studio musician, he has played on countless recordings including film scores, jingles, and CDs for a wide range of clients. Powell can be heard on the score for the remake of Quo Vadis for Premier Pictures, playing a wide range of percussion instruments. Additionally, Powell is an instructor for all styles and all levels on drum set, as well as for music theory, sight reading, and composition."
