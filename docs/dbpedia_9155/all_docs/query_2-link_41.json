        "text": "[1995]:\n\nP/P (R/J, Zep, whatever you want to call it) fandom has been an interesting experience for me, because it's different than the \"standard\" types of media fandoms I'd done before.\n\nWe spend hours watching any video that we have, listening to any radio interviews or other audio material that contributes to our understanding of their relationship, scouring the bookstores for recent magazine articles covering the boys, buying and trading at cons and over the Internet for older material that we don't have. Similarly, we extrapolate on what we see \"on the air\" and learn through reading interviews and other press reports. This, as usual, takes the form of fanfic, art, and songtapes.\n\n[Megan Kent] sat me down at Weekend in the Country several years ago, and related the whole plot of _For All the Gods Departed_ (the major Tris/Alex novel by Nancy Arena and Pam Rose). I remembered Led Zeppelin, sort of, and I liked \"Stairway to Heaven\" during the 70s, when it was played about once an hour. But I was intellectually turned off by the idea of slashing real people. Plus, I was deep in the throes of B7 at the time, and wasn't looking for a new fandom. So I thought to myself, \"that's vaguely interesting,\" but didn't pursue it.\n\nHowever, time passed, and I happened to hear a Coverdale/Page song on the radio. I remembered my conversation with Megan Kent], and since I liked the song, I bought the album and liked it, too. So decided to get some Led Zeppelin stuff. [Megan Kent] recommended \"Remasters\", the two-disc \"best of the box set\" album. Liked that, too. So I called [Megan Kent] back and asked to read FATGD. It was one of the most emotionally real (to me) stories I'd read in any fandom. I still can cry my eyes out over some scenes. Of course I had to know more about the people on whom this wonderful story was based, and, voila, I was hooked.\n\nSo how is it different [from episodes from scripted shows]?\n\nShow episodes are the same each time. The show is scripted, and the characters are unlikely to suddenly slip up and declare their undying love/lust for each other.\n\nSlash fans often view new shows with an eye toward finding a slash relationship between two of the characters. I know that I do. (In fact, after recently seeing several of this seasons episodes that I missed, I know I *must* start watching ST:DS9 again, just to see what develops between Garak and Bashir. What a slashable relationship!)\n\nTo my trained slashfan eyes, Robert Plant and Jimmy Page are living what is as close to a real-life slash relationship as I ever expect to witness. They are clearly emotionally dependent on each other, and have been since 1968. They have fought, separated for 14 years, and finally came back together. But even during the long years apart, the one's mind was always on the other, and everything they did ultimately revolved around the other.\n\nNow you get them saying things like \"It's ridiculous how we really didn't even know each other [when we got back together]. We knew what we knew from way back, and that was colored by the passing of time. But I don't think we knew where we were coming from now. I think now, having gone round the world together, there's not a single cobweb or cranny hole that hasn't been opened up and fucked off. That's what it takes when you've been together so seldom.\" And, \"I mean, the crazy thing is, if we could have communicated in 1979 the way we are able to now, I think we would have carried on working with each other. Not as Led Zeppelin, probably. But we'd have had the presence of mind and the maturity to keep going--if we'd been able to communicate.\"\n\nThis is stuff that we, as slash fans, thrive upon. Imagine the fanfic that can be (and probably is being!) written to fill in the gaps, to describe in page after page of angst and hurt/comfort and sex exactly how these two people did manage to reconcile the hurts of the past, and achieve a mature relationship that's been working for close to two years now.\n\nAnd the best part is--it *isn't* scripted! We *don't know* what will happen next! Will they stay together? We hope so, but we don't know. Will they \"declare their undying love/lust for each other?\" Although we're not holding our collective breath for that one, *we don't know*. The remote chance is--they might! After all, as you noted in your message, Robert yelled out at the end of a recent concert in Scotland, \"We're back! And we're courting!\" So who can tell? That's both the joy and hardship of this particular fandom.\n\n[That this fandom is close to actor slash is] exactly what I thought when I first heard about it. I'd never done actor or other real-person slash, so I worried about it. But it turns out that I'm not having any problems keeping *my ideas* about Robert and Jimmy and what's motivating them separate from *the reality* of who they are. In actuality, *I don't know* who they really are. I only know those things they care to show me, and those things others have similarly observed and reported about them. I know that I don't know Robert, and that I don't know Jimmy. But the relationship between them that's visible to me is of the same nature as that between my media heroes, and it gives me the same satisfaction to dwell on it, and imagine its implications.\n\nIt's the same difference between being able to see K/S between Kirk and Spock, and knowing that the relationship between the characters was never intended by the writer/producer/actors/whoever to be viewed as a homoerotic one.\n\nExcept that in Robert and Jimmy's case, there is no writer/producer/...; it's just them. And *who knows* what's really going on between them? That's the exciting part!\n\nThis fandom is as emotionally fulfilling and inspiring as any fandom I've done in the past. In fact, it's perhaps a little more inspirational in that the people are real. They have faced and overcome real problems, real challenges. And they have apparently succeeded. [8]\n\n...Led Zepplin, being the most famous, colorful, and cohesive band in the lot, had (in addition or concomitantly?) sparked the most open slash, having at least two spin-off \"universes\" of recognizable fictional clones with new names: the Paradox material [2] and Bird of Paradise. These re-creations are understood, in the complex fannish fashion, to be fiction with a close basis on LZ's history; they follow it, but are not bound to it. [Megan Kent] made the point that while the ' writers may have ties to and memories of LZ-era events, perhaps even inner-circle private events, their accounts are not necessarily objective or, at this date, reliable. They are, however, an exceptionally grateful basis for fanfic.\n\nWhy focus on rock band musicians to find slash? The milieu, of course, is glamorous but distanced, \"other,\" if very visible; and the characters (meaning the musicians) are extremely high-profile for the population that includes most fans. One audience member said, with emphasis, that 'the image was of' men cooperating with all their resources to create something, rather than to deal death and destruction; the contrast with most slash scenarios is indeed striking. Should we not find that sexy? This highlights the split-second coordination, the years or practice and moments of inspiration that build a band or a close couple within a band. Should they not find it sexy, as characters in our imaginations performing those actions? And, as was at least peripherally acknowledged somewhere in the panel, these guys are not hard on the eyes and in some cases dress to titillate. Not counting the guitar-fucking, the simulated fellatio on stage, and similar stunts. Rock music is based on, and exudes, sexuality from its origins to its social functions today and at all points (if not in all examples) in between.\n\nI brought up rock as a milieu that is not only glamorous but sometimes meant, on stage at least, to be weird and fantastic. SF-like images on stage (Ziggy Stardust...) are not uncommon, and song lyrics with surreal or fantasy elements are common enough. The room as a whole didn't think much of Bowie as a slash icon, but his reputation (and others') for bi and gay behavior certainly feeds the speculation. This is one milieu where a public figure could succeed in flirting with gay images from about 1970 on, however little serious gay activism was accepted there until the 90's.\n\nIf the problem for many slash writers Is that these are real people, said someone, how can we defuse that, make it obvious we're writing fiction for our fantasies instead of trying to defame (as some would see it) popular artists? The solution there is obvious (and has been used by published writers time out of mind) — change the names. Tris/Alex is circulating semi-openly in fandom, though other hinted-at stories are not, because the name change makes it fiction by most people's definition.\n\nThere are some of us who found the Paradox fiction [3] before hearing much about (or of) Led Zepplin, including myself. I know that I was entranced by the fiction — the writing of fans — rather than, originally, the band. No doubt 1 would have been less fascinated if LZ's music had not intrigued me on its own when 1 did hear it, but the appeal is very different. 1 enjoyed the fan-style character writing and the (admittedly sanitized) evocation of a touring band in prose, or I'd never have cared about LZ. Slash at its most abstract, or perhaps slash writing at its least dependent-on-source, attracted me. Is there a significant percentage of mediafans who pick up on rock-milieu slash simply because it's fannish and slash, regardless of the characters' origins? Or do the majority of fans in this sub-group tend to remember their experience of rock music and the rock element in youth culture, seeing the musicians as so numinous that, like TV characters, they are eternal in the common audience's imagination and thus workable as fanwriters' starting points?"
