        "text": "Led Zeppelin is a popular rock band, and the story of how they got their unique name is actually incredible. To figure out what happened we have to start at the beginning.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nThe year was 1968, and guitarist Jimmy Page wanted to form a “supergroup” of a band. He had recently been apart of a band called “The Yardbirds”, so he was going to call his group, “the new yardbirds”. He had a dream lineup in mind so he started getting the members of his band.\n\nBand Mates\n\nHe started with the lead singer, and he wanted Terry Reid to fill that position. Unfortunately, he could not do it so he recommended a 19 year old rising singer, Robert Plant. Jimmy Page wanted to see for himself if Plant was the right fit, so he went North to watch him perform. Page said “Robert was fantastic and having heard him that night and having listened to a demo he had given me, I realized that without a doubt his voice had an exceptional and very distinctive quality.” Plant had a lifelong friend, named John Bonham, and the second Page heard him he was taken aback by his style. Finally came the bass player, and that was easier than Page thought it would be. A man by the name of John Paul Jones answered an ad in a magazine, and that is how he got the job on the band.\n\nThe Name\n\nJimmy Page had recently footed out of a band called the Yardbirds, so he was going to call his band, “The New Yardbirda”, until one fateful night when Page was hanging out with The Who’s drummer Keith Moon. They were talking about how Page’s new band could go down like a lead filled ballon. A zeppelin is a very large balloon, and thus, Led Zeppelin was created."
