        "text": "Since my time at Cuesta College, I have been in the same journalism class.\n\nAs my lackluster attempts to contribute to the class have been muddled by working three jobs, my opinions on certain topics have become clouded by the many tasks featured throughout my day.\n\nPolitically, my stances are a facet of my life that I donâ€™t dwell on.Â\n\nMy politics have changed, but my love for Led Zeppelin never will.\n\nWhen bombarded with irrelevant â€œfactsâ€ from my current journalism teacher and advisor of The Cuestonian, Cyrus Saatsaz, my thoughts on the matter still prevailed.\n\nLed Zeppelin is, and forever will be, better than The Rolling Stones.Â\n\nThough Led Zeppelinâ€™s stint of greatness fell short due to the tragedy of drummer John Bonhamâ€™s death, they have proved themselves as one of the most influential bands of all time.Â\n\nFor those who argue the case of longevityâ€”congratulations on your small win, but I am just getting started.\n\nWithout completely dusting The Rolling Stones, I would like to give credit. They are an awesome band, and I wish I wasnâ€™t such a comparative freak, but I am an opinion editor and some bands just jam harder than others.\n\nWhat I would like to point out is the diversity of Led Zeppelin. They were extreme in their natureâ€”making songs that could be classified as the early component to what is metal, psychedelic rock, blues rock, and other sub genres.\n\nThey were a direct inspiration of Black Sabbath, one of the most highly regarded metal bands, ever. Songs like â€œTravelling Riverside Blues,â€ â€œDazed and Confused,â€ and â€œHow Many More Times,â€ all sound nothing like each other, which is a testament to their spectrum of genres.\n\nWhile The Rolling Stones focus more on blues rock, their scope only broadened slightly throughout the years.Â\n\nBut how many Rolling Stones albums are good from front to back?Â\n\nThough The Rolling Stones have almost five times as many active years as Led Zeppelin, they lack Led Zeppelinâ€™s consistency.Â\n\nWith Keith Richards still extremely bitter, his words seem just a bit harsh, and envious.\n\nâ€œAs a band, I felt aptly named, it never took off for me musically,â€ Richards said.\n\nThis is just one of many oddly childish attacks on Led Zeppelin, with some being directed at former Led Zeppelin drummer, the late John Bonham, for his heavy hand, and another being Robert Plantâ€™s supposedly unoriginal voice.\n\nBefore I give you all a headache while we hear what rock stars say about themselves and others, I would just like to make note of the odd disdain and certain pettiness that courses through the veins of Keith Richards. Most interviews with famous band members are nauseating by themselves, but this one holds a special place in my heart as blatant narcissism.Â\n\nAs far as the band lineups go, I rate Led Zeppelin much higher.\n\nThe chemistry in the video below that they demonstrate, only months in of playing together, is unmatched, even for bands that have been together for decades.Â\n\nLed Zeppelin drummer John Bonham is revered as one of the most intricate drummers of all time, and I am not even going to debate this with The Rolling Stones fan boys. The website named after The Rolling Stones themselves declares Bonham as the best, so if that isnâ€™t a testament to his ability, my word is useless.\n\nJimmy Page has Keith Richards by a country mile in terms of playing. The man has the soloâ€™ing ability that is only second to Jimi Hendrix, and the pure talent that Richards spent 60 years wishing he had, which he hasnâ€™t stopped talking about in a negative way over the years.Â\n\nAs for John Paul Jonesâ€™ mechanics on bass, there are not too many songs of The Stones that you can listen to, and be completely in awe of the bass player. Jones accomplishes that in songs like â€œThe Song Remains the Same,â€ and â€œThe Wanton Song.â€\n\nThe one that is up in the air, for me at least, is Mick Jagger versus Robert Plant. These two are both great in their own aspects. As for front men, they both exuberate raw emotion, unmatched to what could only be replicated by Queen frontman Freddie Mercury and former Van Halen frontman David Lee Roth.\n\nAs great as both sound when compared to each other, when you factor in influence, quality, and consistencyâ€”Led Zeppelin have The Rolling Stones on their toes."
