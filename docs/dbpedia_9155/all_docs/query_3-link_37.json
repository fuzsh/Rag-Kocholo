For this I try not to use any influences that the band don’t claim themselves. There will be a focus on predecessors but successors will be added as they site the band. These trees become more and more interactive as new bands are added, allowing you to click any band that has a tree and jump to it.\n\nWe want our lists to be better. If you know something that belongs on this list, let us know. When in doubt we will leave it out, so we need reliable sources.\n\nEasily one of the most important bands in rock history. Led Zeppelin may not be a metal band but they are as important as any band when it comes to influencing early metal bands. If Black Sabbath are the fathers of Heavy Metal, Led Zeppelin is like the cool uncle or something. Zeppelin had a consistent line up of members who all contributed to the writing so we will look into all of their influences. For the late John Bonham I will use non primary sources because of his early death. I feel like there are probably things missing from this list if anyone has good sources to share please do. With LZ being in trouble for not giving proper credits I can image why they may be less than forth coming about some influences whom they might have “borrowed” from.\n\nJimmy was learned guitar by playing along with records. He eventually learned how to read music. He pretty much took influence from any guitar playing he heard at the time but a bit more from the blues.\n\nJimmy mentions some guitar players the he likely had great respect for but didn’t specifically name them as influences: Classical player Segovia and Julian Bream, flamenco player Manitas de Plata, and gypsy jazz player Django Reinhardt.\n\nJimmy is often said to have “borrowed” things from other guitar players… some might call it stealing. Among the guitarists he is accused of ripping off are folk/jazz guitarist Bert Jansch for “Black Mountain Slide”. Over the years writing credits have been changed in order to reflect many of these songs.\n\nJohn Paul Jones grew up with his dad who was a pianist and trumpeter who was into blues, jazz, and Latin music and was exposed to all of that. He like Page, was interested in many different styles of playing and not afraid to mix things up.\n\nPlant in one interview talks about wanting his voice to be a tenor sax. He says he wanted to be Coleman Hawkins and Dexter Gordon.\n\nBonham was said to have favorite bands including Johnny Kidd & The Pirates, The Hollies and The Graham Bond Organisation.\n\nBands influenced by Led Zeppelin!\n\nAs this project advances, bands will be added here… there are many!"
