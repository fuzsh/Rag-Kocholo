        "text": "Robert Plant\n\nBritish singer\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 25, 2024, 5:17 AM ET (BBC)\n\nLegendary acts set to play four-day Cambridge Folk Festival\n\nRobert Plant (born August 20, 1948, West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England) is a British singer-songwriter best known as the lead singer for the rock band Led Zeppelin. Plant’s dynamic vocal range and flamboyant stage presence has distinguished him as a popular and influential rock and roll front man. Since the dissolution of Led Zeppelin, he has pursued an adventurous solo career, including forays into bluegrass music and early rock and roll.\n\nEarly life\n\nPlant was born in West Bromwich, Staffordshire, England, to Robert C. Plant, a civil engineer, and Annie Celia (née Cain) Plant, who was of Romany descent. Young Plant grew up in nearby Worcestershire and came of age amid a vibrant music scene. He attended King Edward VI Grammar School, though he dropped out before graduating. As a teenager, he sang in a number of bands, and he idolized rock and roll and blues music artists such as Elvis Presley, Muddy Waters, and Sonny Boy Williamson.\n\nUnder pressure from his parents to pursue a career as a chartered accountant, Plant left his childhood home at age 16. After staying with various friends, he moved to Walsall, Staffordshire, with his girlfriend Maureen Wilson. While working a day job in road construction, he founded (1966) the rock group Band of Joy, which included his friend and future Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. The band had fizzled by the spring of 1968. Later that year, Plant and Wilson married and had their first child; they would have two more children before divorcing in 1983.\n\nWhile he was a member of the rock band Obs-Tweedle, he received an invitation from music manager Peter Grant to audition for the British rock group the Yardbirds. Plant was not the first choice of Grant or of Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page, but after traveling from London to hear Plant perform with Obs-Tweedle at a small venue in Walsall, Page invited Plant to his home, where the two bonded over their shared taste in music. In 1968 Plant joined the Yardbirds and suggested that they add Bonham as the group’s drummer.\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nThe band was renamed Led Zeppelin and comprised vocalist Plant, guitarist Page, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer Bonham. Led Zeppelin gained traction with the release of its self-titled debut album and successful tours of the United Kingdom and the United States. Plant’s raw vocal power and wide range propelled Led Zeppelin’s heavy groove, and his growls, shrieks, and unearthly wails punctuated the band’s early recordings. He wrote most of the band’s lyrics, which were often informed by references to Norse mythology and the epic fantasy works of English author J.R.R. Tolkien. Plant came into his own as a lyricist on the album Led Zeppelin III (1970), with songs such as the rollicking “Bron-Y-Aur Stomp,” which was inspired by his blue-eyed collie Strider, and the melancholy ballad “That’s the Way.”\n\nThe band’s popularity soared after the release of its untitled fourth album, commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV (1971). Featuring the hard rock anthems “Stairway to Heaven,” “Rock and Roll,” and “Misty Mountain Hop,” Led Zeppelin IV sold more than 37 million copies worldwide and launched the band into superstardom. Led Zeppelin remained popular throughout the 1970s, but from 1975 to 1980 its success was tempered by hardship and tragedy. Plant and Wilson were seriously injured in a car accident while vacationing in Rhodes, Greece, in 1975. While touring the United States in 1977, Plant learned that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus. As the band prepared for a 1980 U.S. tour, Bonham died from pulmonary aspiration after a bout of heavy drinking. Shortly after his death, the remaining members of Led Zeppelin announced that they would not continue as a band.\n\nSolo career\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Encouraged by Phil Collins, who backed Plant on drums, he recorded the solo albums Pictures at Eleven (1982) and The Principle of Moments (1983). The Honeydrippers: Volume One (1984), which included contributions from Page and guitarists Jeff Beck and Brian Setzer, constituted Plant’s return to early rock and roll and showcased renditions of “Sea of Love” by Phil Phillips and Roy Brown’s “Rockin’ at Midnight.” In 1985 Plant released the experimental album Shaken ’n’ Stirred, featuring the top 40 hit “Little by Little,” which appeared on the Miami Vice episode “Junk Love.” That same year, Plant, Page, and Jones reunited, along with Collins on drums, to perform at the Live Aid benefit concert at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia. Plant, Page, and Jones also played concerts to commemorate occasions that were significant to Led Zeppelin, including its acceptance into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nIn 2007 Plant collaborated with bluegrass singer Alison Krauss and producer T Bone Burnett on the critically acclaimed album Raising Sand, which effortlessly blends country music, blues, and folk and ties together beautiful lead vocals and harmonies from both singers. Plant and Krauss garnered five Grammy Awards in 2009 for their work on Raising Sand, including one for record of the year for the song “Please Read the Letter.” Later that year, Plant was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. In 2021 Plant and Krauss released a second album, Raise the Roof, which features the standout track “High and Lonesome,” penned by Plant and Burnett, and stirring renditions of Merle Haggard’s “Going Where the Lonely Go” and Bobby Moore’s “Searching for My Love.”\n\nAnna Dubey"
