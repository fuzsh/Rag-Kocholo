Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin sent a message to his hometown after an apartment explosion killed dozens in Magnitogorsk, Russia on New Year’s Eve.

Before recording a goal and an assist in a 7-2 Penguins victory over the New York Rangers on Wednesday night, he wrote messages on his skates – translated as “Magnitogorsk, we are with you” and “Magnitogorsk, you are in my heart” – to participate in a day of remembrance for the victims.

At least 33 people died when an explosion, believed to be caused by a gas leak, gutted a block of apartment buildings.

After the game, an emotional Malkin said he hoped to score a goal that he could dedicate to his hometown.

He said he and the Penguins will try to raise money to help the victims and their families in the near future.

“I want to say we support you,” Malkin said. “We’re here. We’re together. Always in my heart, it’s my hometown. It’s the No. 1 city for me, for my family. I’m glad to be born in this town. I know there’s great people in this town. Something bad happens sometimes. We’ll try to help the families. Just be strong.”
