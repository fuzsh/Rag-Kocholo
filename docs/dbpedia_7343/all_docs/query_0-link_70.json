        "text": "When we last were able to watch NHL hockey, Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin owned the title of \"Goal of the Year\" after he took the puck from his own blue line and knifed through the entire Tampa Bay Lightning roster to score the second goal of a hat trick during an 8-1 rout.\n\nThese days Malkin is locked out and playing back with Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the KHL. During today's 3-0 win over Amur, Malkin just embarrassed Alexander Osipov for another beauty:\n\nIt was a tough game for Osipov. He took a hit from Nikolai Kulemin earlier in the period and landed face first into the side boards. For Malkin, the goal was his second of the KHL season and he has 9 points through 9 games for Magnitogorsk, two behind the immortal Cal O'Reilly.\n\nThe list of NHLers heading to Europe is growing daily. As the CBA talks drag on and we miss more and more of the 2012-13 season, YouTube and live streams will sadly be our best friends if we're to watch many of our NHL favorites on an ice sheet this year."
