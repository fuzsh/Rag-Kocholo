        "text": "We have hit the dog days of summer. There is nothing out there worth blogging about. Here are three worthwhile tidbits which are probably already stale:\n\n–> Keith Aucoin signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs. Good luck to him. Here is Tim Leone’s story on Aucoin’s departure.\n\n–> In the wake of the Ryan Craig signing with Springfield, Jonathan Bombulie feels there is going to be a dawning of a new age come the fall.\n\n–> Pens D-man Alex Picard has flown the coop for the KHL’s HC Lev Praha. Since you can’t read Czech, I already translated the story for you. You’re welcome.\n\nThe AHL matrices are expected to be released any day. Of course, I have been saying that for a few weeks now. That will probably be the next update.\n\nLatest on Twitter then Facebook then here. Although not always in that order.\n\nCouple of Penguins in the news of recent, all with new locations they are calling home next year. Off we go:\n\n–> Cal O’Reilly signed this week with Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the KHL. Link here already translated to English for you. Have a laugh at some of the comments which were translated also.\n\n–> Ex-Penguin Tim Wallace signs on with the Carolina organization. I have a strange feeling that the Penguins will be seeing the Checkers at least once this upcoming season, so it will be weird seeing Wallace, who ranks something like second or in the top five of WBS games played, flying around the ice in opposing colors.\n\n–> Captain Ryan Craig to the Springfield Falcons on an AHL deal. This one will take a while to sink in for me, because Craig was like the rock on the ice for all the players. Nothing spiraled out of control that often under his watch. It will be a homecoming of sorts for Craig in his return to Springfield, where he was their captain and will most likely return to the captaincy this fall. It will be hard to boo him when Springfield visits, that is for sure.\n\nFootnote to the above, Falcons president and general manager Bruce Landon, one of the more noticeable AHL GM’s in the league (could you name the Grand Rapids GM? I sure can’t) had nice things to say about Craig and the leadership he is bringing with him to Springfield in the fall.\n\nOther teams had moves of their own:\n\nAnaheim / Norfolk:\n\n–> Signed goalie Marco Cousineau. Technically this is a “re-signing” as Cousineau moonlighted with the Ducks AHL affiliate last year in Syracuse. He has bounced from AHL, ECHL and even to the CHL.\n\nElsewhere:\n\n–> Not really a new signing, but the Gryba Smash will be sticking around the Southern Tier for one more season.\n\n–> Speaking on returns, the Peter Merth Effect is back in Wheeling for another season, from Pens Director of Communications Mike O’Brien, the Penguins were 9-2 when Merth was dressed and in the lineup for the Penguins.\n\n–> Speaking of O’Bie, he wraps up the Season in Review with the Bears and the IceCaps playoff series.\n\nCheck out the Facebook page and the Twitter feed for the latest, or sign up for auto updates on the blog via e-mail.\n\nBut for more late breaking news, have a great weekend!\n\nCouple of things to catch up on because if I leave these go, they may already be stale by the time I blog again:\n\n–> I touched on this in the afternoon “update” of yesterdays entry, but Pittsburgh announced its prospect camp roster for next week. Names familiar to Wilkes-Barre fans include Simon Despres, Brian Gibbons, Philip Samuelsson, Zach Sill and Paul Thompson. Left off the roster was Patrick Killeen. I am openly wondering why. The Penguins invited three goaltenders I have never heard of, but not Killeen. Beginning of the end for him? I hope not. He really hasn’t been given a chance yet.\n\n–> Here’s a nice article the WBS Penguins tweeted late Friday about the depth of the farm club here in Wilkes-Barre and the successes of the Penguins at the AHL level. I firmly believe that the Penguins are attracting the bigger names because of the success and the amenities / facilities afforded to the prospects coming up in the system. All that is missing is that elusive Calder Cup.\n\n–> Syracuse is still adding bodies. Matt Taormina takes the drive southeast from Albany to Syracuse and will provide depth at defense. Tampa Bay signs goaltender Anders Lindback, which means that we can expect at least in the short term Calder Cup Champion Dustin Tokarski back in net with Riku Helenius backing up.\n\n–> Congrats to the AHL’s Ellery Award winners. This is essentially the version of MVP for print, radio broadcasting and television.\n\n–> Finally, I was doing some tinkering “under the hood” of the blog and noticed that Chirps from Center Ice has been viewed more than 70,000 times. Thank you to everyone who reads and interacts with me here, on Twitter and on Facebook. It is really appreciated.\n\nHave a great weekend."
