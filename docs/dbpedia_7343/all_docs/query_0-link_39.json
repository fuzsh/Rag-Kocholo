        "text": "NHL PLAYER, Mats Zuccarello\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn Sep 01, 1987 -- Oslo, Norway\n\nMats André Zuccarello Aasen (born September 1, 1987) is a Norwegian professional ice hockey winger currently playing for the Minnesota Wild of the National Hockey League (NHL). Prior to joining the NHL, he played for Modo Hockey in the Swedish Elite League. In 2010, he won the Guldhjälmen (Golden Helmet), which is awarded annually to the most valuable player in the Swedish Hockey League.\n\nZuccarello grew up in the suburbs of Løren in Grorud Valley, Oslo. He is of Sicilian and Norwegian ancestry. At five-years-old, he started playing hockey in Hasle-Løren. After some years in Hasle-Løren, he started playing for Vålerenga, where he stayed until the end of lower secondary school. By that time, he had been scouted by Frisk Asker, which offered him a scholarship at the Norwegian College of Elite Sport, which he accepted.\n\nAfter three seasons in the GET-ligaen in Norway, Zuccarello signed with Modo Hockey of the Elitserien, Sweden's premier league. In his first season with Modo, he ranked third in team scoring with 40 points in 35 games. The following season, he led the team with 23 goals. With a league-leading 64 points, he was awarded the Guldhjälmen as the league's most valuable player, as voted by Elitserien players.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Zuccarello was signed as a free agent by the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) to a two-year, entry-level contract. He started the 2010–11 season with the Hartford Wolf Pack/Connecticut Whale, the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, to adapt to the North American style of hockey and rink dimensions. On December 22, 2010, he was called up to the Rangers following an injury to right winger Marián Gáborík. He made his NHL debut on December 23, 2010, against the Tampa Bay Lightning, becoming the seventh Norwegian player to play in the NHL, as well as the second undrafted one.\n\nHe earned his first NHL point on December 27th, 2010, tying defenceman Anders Myrvold for the Norwegian player with the fewest number of games played before recording an NHL point. The Rangers won the game 7–2. Nine days later, in his sixth game, Zuccarello scored his first NHL goal against goaltender Cam Ward three minutes into overtime, leading the Rangers to a 2–1 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes. On April 1, 2011 he was reassigned to Connecticut after playing 41 games for the Rangers. On April 13, 2011, Zuccarello became only the second Norwegian to take part in NHL post-season action when the Rangers lost 2–1 against the Washington Capitals.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, Zuccarello confirmed that he had signed a two-year deal with Metallurg Magnitogorsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). However, he returned to the NHL and the Rangers after the 2012–13 NHL lockout.\n\nZuccarello re-signed with the Rangers at the end of the 2012–13 season on a one-year deal, worth $1.15 million. The 2013–14 season turned out to be a breakout season for Zuccarello. He tallied career highs in goals, assists and team-highs in points, as his contributions helped the Rangers reach the 2014 Stanley Cup Final, where they faced-off against the Los Angeles Kings. Although New York lost the series 4–1, Zuccarello made history by becoming the first Norwegian to ever participate in a Stanley Cup Final. His all-around game also took a step forward throughout the season, as he established himself as a hard worker with the ability to get under the skin of his opponents. His work was recognized by being awarded the 2013–14 Steven McDonald Extra Effort Award.\n\nOn July 22, 2014, Zuccarello agreed to a one-year deal with the Rangers worth $3.5 million.\n\nDuring the 2014-15 season, Zuccarello agreed to a 4-year, $18 million contact worth ($4.5 million a year) that extends through the 2018-19 season.\n\nOn 24 February 2019, Zuccarello was traded to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a 2019 conditional second-round pick and a 2020 conditional third-round pick. He debuted with the Stars the same day against the Chicago Blackhawks.\n\nHaving left the Stars as a free agent, Zuccarello was signed to a five-year, $30 million contract with the Minnesota Wild on July 1, 2019.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nNEWS"
