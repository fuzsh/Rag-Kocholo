        "meta_description": "Evgeni (Yevgeni) Vladimirovich Malkin (born 31 July 1986) is a Russian professional ice hockey center and alternate captain for the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He is known for his remarkable skill set and ability to execute plays, earning him the reputation as one of the best players in the NHL. He currently wears number 71 on his jersey.\n\t\n\tMalkin began his career with his hometown club Metallurg Magnitogorsk, playing for their junior and senior teams. He was then selected second overall in the 2004 NHL Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins, though an international transfer dispute delayed the start of his NHL career until 2006. After his first season with the Penguins Malkin was awarded the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's best rookie. In his second season he helped lead Pittsburgh to the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals and was a runner-up for the Hart Memorial Trophy, which is given to the league's most valuable player. The following season saw Malkin win the Art Ross Trophy, awarded to the top-scorer in the NHL and again place second for the Hart Trophy. He and the Penguins again reached the Stanley Cup Final, winning the Stanley Cup championship this time around; Malkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player of the playoffs. In 2012 Malkin was awarded the Hart Trophy and Ted Lindsay Award, awarded to the best player as voted on by the players, after winning the Art Ross Trophy for the second time; his 12-point lead was the largest margin of victory since 1999.\n\t\n\tInternationally, Malkin has competed for Russia in two IIHF World U18 Championships and three IIHF World U20 Championships, capturing one gold, two silvers and one bronze medal, as a junior. In 2006, in addition to a silver medal, he was also named tournament MVP. As a senior, he has played in four IIHF World Championships, winning the gold medal and being named the tournament MVP for the 2012 event. In addition he has won the bronze medals in two other World Championships and has played for team Russia during the last three Winter Olympic Games, in Turin, Vancouver, and Sochi.\n\t\n\tMalkin is primarily a center with very good offensive abilities and decent defensive awareness. He has also been known to play on the wing alongside Sidney Crosby, and on the point during the power play. A good skater with firm balance and exceptional speed, he is not generally physical when it comes to seeking out contact, although he will on occasion deliver heavy hits for a particular purpose. He rather relies on his athleticism most times to avoid checks by opponents. A very emotionally driven athlete, he has been known to let emotions affect his play both positively and negatively (in the form of taking &quot;bad&quot; penalties). He has a strong arsenal of shots (slap, wrist, and snap), and has soft hands and remarkable stick-handling ability. An excellent passer who knows how to open up the game and create space, Malkin is capable of driving the length of the ice to score goals due to his speed, size, and excellent stick handling.\n\t\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeni_Malkin\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgeni_Malkin</a>\n\t\n\t<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>",
