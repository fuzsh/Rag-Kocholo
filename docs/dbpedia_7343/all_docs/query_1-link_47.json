        "text": "With the Stanley Cup Playoffs starting in a few weeks, here’s a good time to review how many teams have qualified for the NHL playoffs over the years. This is just for the NHL playoffs, not the Stanley Cup Playoffs (as the eight postseasons from 1918 to 1925 were inter-league affairs with the PCHA and/or WCHL.\n\nOne of the big criticisms the league has received over the years from both fans and non-fans (including the media) is that too many teams make the playoffs. But how many teams, and what percentage of the league have qualified for the playoffs through the history of the league? Here is a season by season account of the number of playoff teams, overall number of teams and the percentage of them that make the playoffs.\n\n1918-19: 2/3 = 66.7% (Split season)\n\n1920: 1/4 = 25% (Ottawa won both halves, Senators win NHL & go to the Stanley Cup Final)\n\n1921-24: 2/4 = 50% (Split season in 1920-21)\n\n1925: 3/6 = 50% (Hamilton defaulted, only two teams, or 33%, actually played in NHL playoffs)\n\n1926: 3/6 = 50%\n\n1927-31: 6/10 = 60%\n\n1932: 6/8 = 75%\n\n1933-35: 6/9 = 66.7%\n\n1936-38: 6/8 = 75%\n\n1939-42: 6/7 = 85.7% (Highest playoff qualification rate in NHL history)\n\n1943-67: 4/6 = 66.7%\n\n1968-70: 8/12 = 66.7%\n\n1971-72: 8/14 = 57.1%\n\n1973-74: 8/16 = 50%\n\n1975-78: 12/18 = 66.7%\n\n1979: 12/17 = 70.6%\n\n1980-91: 16/21 = 76.2%\n\n1992: 16/22 = 72.7%\n\n1993: 16/24 = 66.7%\n\n1994-98: 16/26 = 61.5%\n\n1999: 16/27 = 59.3%\n\n2000: 16/28 = 57.1%\n\n2001-17: 16/30 = 53.3%\n\n2018-19: 16/31 = 51.7%\n\n2020: 24/31 = 77.4% (Postseason expansion due to COVID-19 pandemic)\n\n2021: 16/31 = 51.7%\n\nWeighted average, excluding the 2021 playoffs, on percent of teams in the playoffs is 64.04% (about 20 teams in a 31 or 32 team league). This makes sense as for the 25 year reign of the Original Six, four out of six teams qualified for the postseason. This is 66.7% of the league, so having the weighted average of playoff qualification near that figure makes sense. There were 12 other seasons in NHL history when two thirds, or 66.7%, of the league made the playoffs. This gives us a total of 37 seasons (out of 102) when that percentage of teams qualified. There have been 104 seasons in league history counting 2004-05 (cancelled) and 2020-21 (not in the calculations).\n\nIt was easiest to qualify for the playoffs for the four seasons (1939 to 1942) when six out of seven clubs would make it. This represents 85.7% of the league. During the often criticized 1980-91 period, 16 out of 21 made the playoffs, or 76.2% of the league. Excluding the split seasons of 1918 to 1921 postseasons where either one or two teams made it; the most difficult time to make it was 1925-26, and again from 1973-74 when only half the NHL made the playoffs. This season is the 99th year since they abandoned the split season format and every season save for those four over half the league played in the playoffs. Assuming no changes to the format, we will return to a 50% qualification rate when the Kraken join the NHL. The league will have 16 teams (out of 32) in the Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nWell the other day the NHL announced that they hope to commence the 2021-22 season (this will be a fun season to say verbally) on October 12, 2021. This is about a week later than normal. This will result in a short offseason as the Stanley Cup won’t be won until mid-July, with the entry and expansion drafts coming on the last weekend of July.\n\nOf course, the Seattle Kraken will join the league next season as well meaning the league will have 32 teams, divided into four eight team divisions. With Seattle joining the Pacific, this means the Arizona Coyotes will move over to the Central Division, giving that division eight teams just like the other three regular divisions. This is assuming, of course, the temporary divisions for this COVID-19 season will last just the one season. Getting back to the schedule, it is expected to return to 82 games, after this shortned 56 gamer. Also, there will be an Olympic Break built into it assuming the league, union & IIHF can come to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee on use of game footage from the Games. There is also the issue of an Olympic boycott this time around but let’s assume that isn’t going to happen. This was one reason why the league held out of the 2018 Games that were held in South Korea. The break will likely to a little longer than usual due to the jet lag factor of flying to and from China. The only time the league had an Olympic Break for Games held in Asia was in 1998 when they paused for 17 games for the tournament in Nagano, Japan. For reference, that regular season started on October 1, 1997 and ended on April 19, 1998. Using that as a gauge, that means the regular season will end on April 30, 2022. The season could end earlier if they play a shortened season of say 76 games (that would shave about two weeks off the schedule). With deceased revenues and a flat cap from the pandemic, there is no way the league and union would agree to anything less than an 82 game schedule. If anything they may add some games to the schedule to help increase revenues.\n\nThis means the playoffs will be held throughout May and June. Depending on network commitments at ESPN & ABC (remember the new TV contract kicks in this fall) and building availability, the last couple of Stanley Cup Final games may creep into July. Don’t be surprised if arenas are busy next spring. The live music business has been unexistant since last March. Everybody from the venues to the artists and their management will be eager to schedule concerts as soon as they can. Arenas will be booked solid next spring, especially if the NHL & NBA tenants make deep playoff runs in 2022.\n\nThis will push the draft back into the second weekend of July to probably Friday, July 8 and Saturday, July 9. This is for the best because, otherwise the draft would be on the weekend of Canada Day and Independence Day which is something they would like to avoid. Free agency will likely kick off a couple days later on say July 11, instead of the traditional Canada Day free agent frenzy. The league has actually proposed in the past to start free agency on July 7-8 to avoid the national holidays but the NHLPA wanted to keep it as it is now.\n\nSince Canada is behind the States in vaccinations it wouldn’t surprise me if for the first quarter to third of the season there is minimal (or no) games in Canada for American based teams. This means Canadian teams will likely play many early season games in the Untied States. Likely, it’ll be a couple extended road trips with the possibility of some neutral site games. The neutral sites would be similar as to what’s being done with the Blue Jays (in Buffalo & Dunedin) and Raptors (in Tampa). It could also mean Global Series games in Europe featuring only Canadian clubs. The league has stated they would like to return to Europe for regular season games next year. Another possibility is the Canadian teams would play each other a lot early in the season to avoid cross border travelling. You could see all the inter-conference games being played in October with some intra-division battles among Canadian teams thrown in (could be a problem for Winnipeg as they’re the only Canadian side in the Central). The amount of fans in the stands in Canada remains to be seen.\n\nI have also heard the Islanders new arena won’t be ready until November. This could mean either an extended trip in October or some last games at Nassau during the first month of the season. Knowing the NHL, they would probably have the team play a couple at Nassau, a couple in Brooklyn before opening up the new digs in Queen’s. The league would also make them play either in Europe or an outdoor game so the team would end up playing games at four separate venues during the season.\n\nPossible Important Date Schedule From Now Until October 2022:\n\nKeep in mind the dates are fluid depending on COVID-19 test results around the league.\n\nMay 19, 2021: 2020-21 Regular Season Ends (depending on make up dates).\n\nMay 20, 2021: Stanley Cup Playoffs begin. Again, this depends on what divisions are playing regular season games on the 19th (so far it’s just the North).\n\nJune 3, 2021: 2021 Second Round begins (may play an expiated playoffs like in 2020 to get it over with).\n\nJune 17, 2021: 2021 League semifinals begin.\n\nJuly 1, 2021: 2021 Stanley Cup Final begins.\n\nJuly 15, 2021: Stanley Cup awarded by now (with the 21st being the last day possible with Tokyo Olympics starting on the 23rd).\n\nJuly 21, 2021: NHL Expansion Draft for the Seattle Kraken.\n\nJuly 23-24, 2021: NHL Entry Draft.\n\nJuly 28, 2021: Free agent frenzy.\n\nSeptember 22, 2021: Training camps for 2021-22 commence. Teams will likely only play a max of four preseason games.\n\nOctober 12, 2021: Opening night for the 2021-22 NHL regular season.\n\nJanuary 1, 2022: Winter Classic, likely in Minnesota as it was scheduled there in 2021.\n\nFebruary 4-20, 2022: Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Break will likely be something like February 5 to 22.\n\nMarch 28, 2022: NHL Trade Deadline (about four to five weeks to the end of regular season, tends to be on a Monday).\n\nApril 30, 2022: 2021-22 NHL Regular Season ends.\n\nMay 3, 2022: 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs begin (usually two off days between regular and post seasons).\n\nMay 18, 2022: 2022 Second Round Begins (like all playoff rounds, varies on previous results, venue availability & whatever the networks want).\n\nJune 3, 2022: 2022 Conference Finals begin (assuming a return to normal playoff format).\n\nJune 18, 2022: 2022 Stanley Cup Final starts.\n\nJune 30, 2022: Final possible date for Stanley Cup (if they play every other day in Final, ie no two consecutive off days during series).\n\nJuly 7-8, 2022: 2022 NHL Entry Draft, likely back in an arena setting.\n\nJuly 10, 2022: Free agent frenzy.\n\nSeptember 16, 2022: Training camps for the 2022-23 season commence.\n\nOctober 5, 2022: 2022-23 NHL regular season starts (tends to be the first Wednesday in October). The league would officially be back on schedule then.\n\nThis is how the league calendar will likely look over the next 18 months for all the important dates. Keep in mind that if the NHL goes to Beijing for the Olympic Games, there will be no All-Star Game. There will likely be a few more outdoor games to make up for lost revenues due to the pandemic. It wouldn’t surprise me if there’s six of them like in 2013-14. This means a Winter Classic, Heritage Classic and a few Stadium Series games (including one in Raleigh, as scheduled for 2020-21). There will probably be another “welcome back” outdoor game after the Olympics like the Blackhawks and Penguins played in 2014.\n\nThe Canadian Hockey League has experienced several delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic across all three of their leagues. The OHL hasn’t played since last March 11. The QMJHL and WHL both have been able to play this season but with reduced schedules.\n\nQMJHL\n\nThis league started play back in October and the Quebec based teams have been in & out of bubbles throughout the season. The QMJHL modified the scheduled, making it 60 games played only within the division. The schedule has been modified several times, with Quebec based teams playing interdivsion games. Since Christmas, the Maritime based teams haven’t played games outside of their province, save for the Charlottetown Islanders who have played against the two Nova Scotia teams.\n\nThe three New Brunswick based teams had breaks of about four months. The league itself was on pause from November 30 to January 21 inclusive. The province was under state of emergency and the teams stayed on the sidelines under the middle of March. This resulted in a situation that the entire offseason following a Memorial Cup Final appearance for the Wildcats (2006) and Sea Dogs (2011) was shorter than the COVID break. The Titan offseason following their 2018 Memorial Cup championship was a week longer than the COVID break.\n\nAcadie-Bathurst Titan: November 20 to March 9 (109 days)\n\nMoncton Wildcats: November 14 to March 11 (117 days)\n\nSaint John Sea Dogs: November 18 to March 9 (111 days)\n\nMemorial Cups\n\nAcadie-Bathurst (2018): May 27 to September 20 (116 days)\n\nMoncton (2006): May 28 to September 14 (109 days)\n\nSaint John (2011): May 29 to September 8 (102 days)\n\nWhen the season ends, teams would have played schedules of 28 games (Victoriaville) to the low to mid-40’s (Halifax). The league plans on having a full playoff bracket, that includes 16 teams. The two Nova Scotia teams will not participate due to the delay in the opening of the Atlantic Bubble.\n\nWHL\n\nThe WHL is playing four mini-leagues this season. The East is made up of the seven teams based in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The Central is made up of the five Alberta teams. The West is made up of the five British Columbia teams. While the five US based franchises make up their own division. The divisions started on staggered dates: East (March 12), Central (February 26), West (March 26) and American (March 18). The East and West are playing in bubbles for the season, while the Central and American Divisions are not. Due to the odd number of teams per division, not everybody started on the same date so offseasons vary in length by a few days. The length of offseasons in the WHL division are:\n\nEast: March 11, 2020 to March 12, 2021 (366 days)\n\nCentral: March 11, 2020 to February 26, 2021 (352 days)\n\nWest: March 11, 2020 to March 26, 2021 (380 days)\n\nAmerican: March 10, 2020 to March 18, 2021 (373 days)\n\nEach team will play a 28 game regular season. The season will end on May 12 with no playoffs. So the Q will be the only league of the three with a postseason.\n\nOHL\n\nThe OHL will not play this season and the province of Ontario has been on lockdown (again) during the month of April. so no surprise they couldn’t get even a 20 game season in. The league’s last games were on March 11, 2020 – meaning April 15 was the 400 day mark without the league being in action. If the league doesn’t begin play until October 1, they will go 569 days without playing.\n\nMemorial Cup\n\nFor the second straight season there will be no Memorial Cup as the CHL cancelled the event a couple weeks ago. The last Memorial Cup game was played May 26, 2019 when Rouyn-Noranda Huskies beat the Halifax Mooseheads in the championship game in Halifax. This makes the Huskies the first team to hold the Memorial Cup for three straight seasons. Next year’s tournament will likely start on May 22, 2022 (1091 days between games). A WHL champion hasn’t won a game at the Memorial Cup since May 29, 2015 when Kelowna won the semi-final. Since, the league champs have lost 13 straight games at the tournament. This means the Ed Chynoweth Cup champs will go at least seven years without a win. Host teams from out west (Red Deer in 2016 and Regina in 2018) have won games.\n\nThe NHL Draft will still be held in late July. With the small sample size, it will be hard to judge this year’s draft class. Expect to see some busts in the early rounds and sleepers from the late rounds due to this. Not to mention how other developmental leagues from minor hockey to juniors right up to the AHL are all either cancelled or shortened. This will affect hockey development for years to come.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about the soccer (football) Super League over the past three days. As of this writing, 12 of the continent’s top football clubs want to form a new league. They want to have three more founding members, a total of 15 and then add five more members that can play in & out from season to season. The Original 15 founding members will not be able to be relegated, this is a similar system to basketball’s EuroLeague. So far, teams from England, Spain and Italy have committed to the new competition. Clubs from Germany and France have (for now) rejected joining this new Super League.\n\nA hockey super league would be made of mostly of teams in Czechia, Finland, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland. Here is how such a league of the continent’s super teams could look like if hockey were to follow in soccer’s footsteps. Teams were selected based on a combination of recent performance, attendance (from 2019-20), market size and historical legacy.\n\nAdler Mannheim (Germany)\n\nAk Bars Kazan (Russia)\n\nCSKA Moscow (Russia)\n\nDjurgardens (Sweden)\n\nDynamo Minsk (Belarus)\n\nDynamo Moscow (Russia)\n\nEisbaren Berlin (Germany)\n\nFarjestad (Sweden)\n\nFrolunda (Sweden)\n\nHIFK Helsinki (Finland)\n\nKolner Haie (Germany)\n\nJokerit Helsinki (Finland)\n\nLausanne HC (Switzerland)\n\nLulea HF (Sweden)\n\nMetakllurg Magnitogorsk (Russia)\n\nMunich (Germany)\n\nSC Bern (Switzerland)\n\nSKA Saint Petersburg (Russia)\n\nSparta Prague (Czechia)\n\nZSC Lions (Switzerland)\n\nA hockey competition could have an NHL style schedule of 76 games (two home and two away against each of the 19 opponents). Playoffs would be something like top 12 qualify, with the top four getting byes. The opening series could be a best of five, with the following rounds being a best of seven. The season would run from September to March, with playoffs wrapping up in mid-May. Another possibility is they play a single round robin with a knockout stage. That would allow the teams to stay in their current leagues but replace the Champions Hockey League with the new super league. That is the plan for soccer’s Super League, with teams staying in their domestic leagues with the new competition replacing the Champions’ League for them. Unless they get kicked out of the domestic competitions, which is being threatened by the Premier League and the other top soccer leagues.\n\nThe top clubs would stay in the league in perpetuity, some of the smaller teams could participate in a play-out series against a qualifier who is deemed worthy of being included. Any new team would not be restricted to the big six leagues, in fact it would be better if more countries more represented. If a team from Austria, Italy, France, Britain, etc. grows enough they would likely be invited into the league as it would increase media exposure by being in a new country. Of course, it should be mentioned that the KHL has been trying to create a type of hockey super league since it debuted in 2008. They have been able to get some non-former Soviet clubs to join but not to much avail with Jokerit being the biggest deflector to date.\n\nLet’s just assume The Great One holds all the records for season & career vs. Canadian teams. With all his records and the advantage he had by being in the Smythe Division for much of his career, that’s probably a safe bet. This year with the 56 game schedule and Canadian teams only playing each other some of these records may fall. But what are they? I will list his games, goals, assists and points vs. Canadian opponents for each of Gretzky’s 20 seasons in the NHL.\n\nGretzky’s Season by Season Record vs. Canadian teams\n\nSo, the record for most goals against Canadian competition was 41 in 1983-84, the most assists is 72 in 1985-86 and points is 102, also in that 1985-86 season. He scored 87 goals over in 1983-84 and had 163 assists and 215 points for the 1985-86 NHL season, both are single season records. Currently, Auston Matthews is projected to score 42 goals which would break the record but just barely. Connor McDavid is currently on pace to have 92 points, which would fall ten points short of the record. Even the advantage of the 2020-21 North Division and the firepower within it, it is very possible that Gretzky holds on to these records. It just goes to show how dominate he was as he scored 102 points in 33 games during that 1985-86 season.\n\nWhile playing for the Oilers his career totals against other Canadian teams are: 263 games, 234 goals, 415 assists for 649 points. These would be his career totals in Creighton Cup games (games that only involve Canadian teams, see my previous post). I believe those are also records but I could see guys like Mark Messier and Mats Sundin coming close as they played more years in Canada in the post-merger era. The post-merger players would have most of these records as they have more games against Canadian teams as there were anywhere between 6-8 teams in Canada from 1979-80 on. Players in the Smythe Division from 1982 on have an even greater advantage. During these seasons, teams played eight games against divisional opponents and three games against non-division opponents. This meant the four Canadian teams in this division played a total of 33 games against Canadian opposition. The division’s lone American side, the Los Angeles Kings, would play 41 games against Canadian teams during this era. Since the league had an 80 game schedule, this meant they played more games against Canadian clubs than American opponents (39). The Kings also played against Canadian teams in all four rounds during their march to the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, their only one during the Gretzky era. They played Calgary in the Smythe semi-finals, Vancouver in the division finals, Toronto in the Campbell Conference final and Montreal the the Cup final.\n\nEarlier, I did a post discussing the 2004 WHA Draft, here is another draft from an earlier start-up league that failed to hit the ice. The Continental Hockey League was to compete with the NHL and had six teams at the time of the draft. The teams were: Florida Makos, Cincinnati Stingers, Hamilton Tigers, Cleveland Barons, Atlanta Warriors and Saskatchewan Force. The teams were sold by the league for $400,000.\n\nThe league itself was based out of Saskatoon, under president “Wild” Bill Hunter, who was the original owner of the Edmonton Oilers when they were in the World Hockey Association. The Atlanta franchise couldn’t get a lease at the Omni Coliseum before the IHL Atlanta Knights got one. The team was owned by a pair of restaurateurs named Greg Wakeham and Joe Ardagna. The Cleveland team was owned by Pat O’Halloran of Minnesota. The Florida Makos (sometimes called Panthers believe it or not) were slated to play out of the Sportatorium in suburban Miami. The team in Saskatoon, named the Saskatchewan Force, had hired a general manager, a man named Bob Strumm who previously worked in the Red Wings scouting department. He resigned from the Wings on June 11 and was hired in Saskatoon two days later. The NHL club planned on suing him as he used information from the Wings during the CHA draft. Hamilton was to be owned by a pair of businessmen from the Kitchener area named Mario Frankovich and Paul Skidmore.\n\nThe North American Hockey League was also trying to challenge the NHL at this time and also held a draft in June 1991. That league also had six franchises, including teams in many of the same cities that were to be part of the CHA. Only Florida, Saskatchewan and Cincinnati had signed lease agreements with arenas in their respective cities. Hamilton has an agreement with Copps Coliseum but it had lapsed in August as there was no ownership group at the time. The league had plans of eventually placing franchises in Europe in future seasons.\n\nThe draft was held on June 14 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. The draft lasted for four hours as each team picked 60 players each. The first five rounds only NHL players about to become free agents were selected, while non-NHLers were taken in the subsequent rounds. I had noted the league for the non-NHL players drafted.\n\nThe picks were (first ten rounds only):\n\nRound 1\n\n1. Florida, Guy Carbonneau, c (Montreal); 2. Cincinnati, Phil Housley d (Winnipeg); 3. Hamilton, Brendan Shanahan, c (New Jersey); 4. Cleveland, Sean Burke, g (New Jersey); 5. Atlanta, Mathieu Schneider, d (Montreal); 6. Saskatchewan, Wendel Clark, lw (Toronto).\n\nRound 2\n\n7. Saskatchewan, Steve Smith, d (Edmonton); 8. Atlanta, Craig Simpson, c (Edmonton); 9. Cleveland, Mark Recchi, rw (Pittsburgh); 10. Hamilton, John Cullen, c (Hartford); 11. Cincinnati, Jimmy Waite, g (Chicago); 12. Florida, Mike Richter, g (NY Rangers).\n\nRound 3\n\n13. Florida, Sylvain Cote, d (Hartford); 14. Cincinnati, Mark Lamb, c (Edmonton); 15. Hamilton, Mario Gosselin, g (Los Angeles); 16. Cleveland, Glen Wesley, d (Boston); 17. Atlanta, Todd Krygier, lw, (Hartford); 18. Saskatchewan, Rick Tabaracci, g (Winnipeg).\n\nRound 4\n\n19. Saskatchewan, Andrew Cassels, c (Montreal); 20. Atlanta, Craig Berube, lw (Edmonton); 21. Cleveland, Dirk Graham, rw (Chicago); 22. Hamilton, Peter Zezel, c (Toronto); 23. Cincinnati, Chris Joseph, d (Edmonton); 24. Florida, Scott Young, rw (Pittsburgh).\n\nRound 5\n\n25. Florida, John Morris, c (New Jersey); 26. Cincinnati, Troy Crowder, rw (New Jersey); 27. Hamilton, Charlie Huddy, d (Minnesota); 28. Cleveland, Neil Sheehy, d, (Washington); 29. Atlanta, Darcy Wakaluk, g (Minnesota); 30. Saskatchewan, Carey Wilson, c (Hartford).\n\nRound 6\n\n31.

According to the New York Times, by not drafting him, this allowed the CHA to offer him a contract from the league as a whole to help tailor his contract to his requests. This is similar to how Bobby Hull’s contract with the WHA Winnipeg Jets was paid for at least partially by all he member clubs of the league. The league did have a $2,500,000 salary cap with an exception for marque players. Such an exemption would have paid such players $200,000 plus money paid under a personal services contract with the owner. Carbonneau was in talks to sign with the Makos, and the Force tried hard to lure Wendell Clark back to his home province of Saskatchewan.\n\nOn August 15, the CHA announced their plans to start up were postponed a year, until the 1992-93 hockey season. Prior to that, it was reported that Cincinnati and Hamilton would be dissolved, replaced with Worcester and Birmingham.\n\nSources include the New York Times, Ice Hockey Wikia, Toronto Star and the Halifax Daily News."
