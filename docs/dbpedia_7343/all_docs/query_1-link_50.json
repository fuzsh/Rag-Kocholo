        "text": "We last looked at the field hockey events that took place before 1980. With the Summer Olympic Games in 1980 taking place in Moscow, Russia, there was a significant change in the field hockey event as the women began play as part of the Olympic Games. We saw how India and Pakistan dominated all of the Olympic Games before 1980, and there are three countries who began to establish their dominance at the Olympics in field hockey. Today, we look at the 1980 Olympic Games until the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe Games in Moscow were a celebration of the Soviet Union, and the men also made a run at a gold medal in the field hockey event. Spain finished atop the standings at 4-0-1 while India finished second at 3-0-2. The Soviet Union finished 3-2-0 to end up third while Poland captured fourth-place with a 2-2-1 record. That set up a bronze medal match between the USSR and Poland, and the Soviet Union captured its first medal in field hockey with a 2-1 win over Poland. India and Spain squared off in the gold medal match, and India returned to the top of the podium with a 4-3 win.\n\nThe women participated for the first time, and it was a one-round, winner-take-all format. The six countries participating were Austria, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland, USSR, and Zimbabwe. India opened the tournament with two wins over Austria and Poland, giving them the early edge. Zimbabwe, however, downed Poland 4-0 and tied Czechoslovakia to find themselves slightly behind. The third draw saw the standings swing, though, as Czechoslovakia downed India while Zimbabwe beat the USSR. India and Zimbabwe tied in the fourth draw, and both the USSR and Czechoslavakia won to create a bunch of win-loss scenarios for Zimbabwe, India, Czechslovakia, and USSR for the three medals. The three winning teams would medal, though, so it was imperative to win. The early game in the fifth draw saw Czechoslovakia beat Poland to put them into medal contention. The afternoon draw saw Zimbabwe down Austria to move them into gold medal contention. In the evening game, the USSR beat India to knock them out of the medals, leaving Zimbabwe with gold at 3-0-2, Czechoslovakia with silver at 3-1-1, and the USSR with bronze at 3-2-0.\n\nThe 1984 Olympic Games were held in Los Angeles, and there was a return to the podium for another men's team. Pool A saw Australia win with 5-0-0 record and West Germany come runner-up with a 3-1-1 record. Pool B was won by Great Britain with a 4-0-1 record while Pakistan finished second with a 2-0-3 record. In the semi-finals, Pakistan overcame Australia by a 1-0 score while West Germany downed Great Britain by the same 1-0 score. Great Britain would capture the bronze medal with a 3-2 win over Australia. After falling behind 1-0, Pakistan would rally to tie the game with West Germany before scoring the winner at the 82nd minute in extra time to capture the gold medal.\n\nThe women saw six teams participate again: Australia, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, and the USA. There aren't many results to be found regarding this event on the Internet, but I can tell you that the Netherlands earned the gold medal, West Germany earned the silver medal, and the United States won the bronze medal. For the second straight year, a country took home medals in both events of the same color.\n\nSeoul, South Korea was the site of the 1988 Summer Olympics, and twelve men's teams took part in the event. Pool A was won by Australia with a 5-0-0 record while the Netherlands finished second with a 3-1-1 record. Pool B saw Germany advance as the top team with a 4-0-1 record while Great Britain captured second-place with a 3-1-1 record. Germany squared off with the Netherlands in the first semi-final, and the Germans got past the Dutch squad with a 2-1 win. Great Britain and Australia played in the other semi-final, and a Sean Kerly three-goal day pushed Great Britain past Australia by a 3-2 score. The bronze medal match pitted the Netherlands against Australia, and a couple of goals by Floris Jan Bovelander was enough for the Netherlands to take the bronze by a 2-1 score. Great Britain and Germany played for gold, and Great Britain jumped on the Germans early and often. Great Britain picked up the gold medal in 1988 by downing Germany 3-1 in the final.\n\nAgain, there seems to be a gap in the information about the '88 Games because there are no records that I can find of how the women's tournament shook down. I can tell you that Australia captured the gold medal, Korea did their country proud in winning the silver medal, and the Netherlands prevailed over Great Britain for the bronze medal. Here's hoping that we get more detailed results as we move into a new decade.\n\nBarcelona, Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games, and we're starting to see trends develop. Pool A in the men's tournament had Australia and Germany advance to the semi-finals while Pool B advanced both Pakistan and the Netherlands. Australia would get by the Netherlands with a 3-2 victory while Germany downed Pakistan in the other semi-final by a 2-1 score. Pakistan and the Netherlands filled the nets, but Pakistan would outlast the Dutch in a 4-3 bronze medal win. In the final, Germany and Australia would battle in a close match, but the Germans would emerge as the gold medalists with a 3-1 win in Barcelona.\n\nThe women's side saw eight teams participate, and they were broken into two pools. Pool A had Germany and Spain advance while Pool B saw Korea and Great Britain move on. Germany would down Great Britain in the first semi-final game on a 2-1 score while Spain would down Korea by the same 2-1 score. That set Great Britain up for another potential bronze medal, and they would bring home a medal with a 4-3 win over Korea. In the final, the host Spanish team was clearly cheered on by their countrymen, and they knocked Germany off by a 2-1 score to capture the gold medal!\n\nWe jump ahead to 1996 where the Olympic Games were held in Atlanta. There were high hopes for a number of nations from the western hemisphere after some impressive showings at the Pan-American Games in 1995, but the final results would look familiar once again. On the men's side, Pool A advanced Spain and Germany while Pool B would send the Netherlands and Australia to the semi-finals. Spain would lock horns with Australia, and the Spaniards would emerge victorious with a 2-1 win. The Netherlands showed their skill by jumping out to a 3-0 lead before the Germans notched a goal, but it was far too late as the Dutch downed the Germans 3-1. Germany, after falling behind early, scored two goals four minutes apart, but the Australians had other plans. Two late goals gave way to a 3-2 victory, and the Aussies would claim the bronze medal. The gold medal game saw Spain open the scoring, but three straight goals by the Netherlands 15 minutes apart put the game out of reach as the Netherlands would capture gold in Atlanta.\n\nThe women's side had eight nations participating once again, and they would play a round-robin format amongst the eight teams with the top-two teams in the standings squaring off for the gold medal, and third- and fourth-place meeting for the bronze medal. After seven games, the Netherlands and Great Britain would finish in third- and fourth-place, respectively, and the gold medal would go to one of Australia or Korea. In the bronze medal match, the Dutch and British played right through extra time without a goal, so penalty strokes would be needed. The Netherlands would push four penalty strokes to the back of the net to the Britons' three strokes, giving them the bronze medal! In the final, Australia overpowered the Koreans in a 3-1 victory that saw Alyson Annan score a pair including the game-winner. Australia captured the gold medal in Atlanta!\n\nSydney, Australia hosted the 2000 Olympic Games, and there was definite anticipation for the field hockey event with the Aussies looking for a gold medal on their home soil. Twelve teams participated, split into two six-team pools. Pool A saw Pakistan and the Netherlands advance to the semi-finals while Pool B would be represented by Australia and South Korea. South Korea and Pakistan would meet in the first semi-final, and Song Seung-Tae's goal in the 56th minute was all the the scoring needed as South Korea rallied past Pakistan 1-0. The other semi-final featured a sold-out pitch as the Netherlands and Australia squared off. While both sides had chances, neither team could find the back of the net in the allotted time, and it was off to penalty strokes. The Netherlands managed to net all five shots to the Australians' four shots, and the Netherlands would advance to the final. In the bronze medal match, Australia exploded for goals, including three by Troy Elder, as the Aussies would capture the bronze medal over Pakistan by a 6-3 score. In the final, the Netherlands appeared to be on their way to a gold medal with a 3-1 lead inside 65 minutes, but two successful penalty corners at the 66th and 68th minutes pull South Korea even. Extra time solved nothing, so it was back to penalty strokes, and the Netherlands pulled out the 5-4 victory margin to capture the gold medal in Sydney!\n\nThe women's tournament saw the top-three teams from each pool advance to a medal-round pool. Pool C had Australia, Argentina, and Spain advance while Pool D was represented by New Zealand, China, and the Netherlands. In the medal pool, the top-four finishers, in order, were Australia, Argentina, Netherlands, and Spain, meaning that the host Aussies would get a chance at a gold medal yet! In the bronze medal match, the Netherlands met with Spain. It wasn't an overly exciting match, but the Dutch women picked up the bronze medal after a 2-0 win over Spain. In the gold medal game, the host Australians used the home crowd's support to jump out to a 3-0 lead just 37 minutes in. Argentina would score a goal at the 43rd minute, but they wouldn't recover as Australia would win the gold medal by a 3-1 score!\n\nThe 2004 Olympic Games returned to Athens, Greece where twelve men's teams would take to the pitch. Once again, there were two pools of six teams, and the top-two teams would advance to the semi-finals. Pool A saw Spain and Germany advance while Pool B had the Netherlands and Australia advance to the semi-finals. The Netherlands met Germany in the first semi-final, and the Dutch squad continued its unbeaten ways as they downed Germany by a 3-2 score. Australia jumped out to a quick lead over Spain, and would down the Spaniards by a 6-3 score in their semi-final. Germany and Spain met for the bronze medal, and it took extra time to decide a winner. Björn Michel's golden goal in extra time would push Germany past Spain in a 4-3 victory! In the gold medal game, the winner would need extra time as well. Jamie Dwyer scored the golden goal for Australia, and the Aussies took home the gold medal!\n\nThe women's side saw ten teams participate, and the favorites had to be Australia going in. Pool A had China and Argentina move on while Pool B saw the Netherlands and Germany advance. Australia actually finished fourth in Pool B as they struggled in the preliminary round, meaning there would be a new gold medalist in Athens! The Netherlands and Argentina would meet in the first semi-final, and the two teams would match each other through regulation time. This 2-2 game would need penalty strokes to decide a winner, and the Netherlands continued its winning ways with the penalty strokes as they outscored Argentina 4-2 to move on. China and Germany also matched each other shot for shot, but neither team would score in regulation time. Penalty strokes would decide this semi-final as well as the Germans downed the Chinese 4-3 to advance to the gold medal game. In the bronze medal game, China continued its tight-checking ways, but Argentina broke through with a Luciana Aymar goal in the 70th minute to capture the bronze medal with a 1-0 victory! In the gold medal game, Germany jumped out to a 2-0 lead before settling in defensively. The Netherlands would get one goal back, but the Germans would be crowned as the gold medalists with a 2-1 win!\n\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympic Games will be our last stop today. Twelve men's teams played in this Olympiad with Australia looking to defend its gold medal. Pool A saw Spain and Germany advance to the semi-finals while Pool B sent the Netherlands and Australia. Germany and the Netherlands would meet again in the semi-finals, and these two teams would find themselves deadlocked at 1-1 after regulation time. In the penalty shootout, Christopher Zeller's goal on Germany's sixth penalty stroke would be the difference as Germany downed the Netherlands 4-3 in the shootout. In the other semi-final, Australia jumped out to a 2-0 lead just 37 minutes in, but Spain would get two goals from Eduard Tubau at the 39th and 44th minutes to tie the game. 24 minutes later, Santi Freixa would deliver the knockout goal as Spain downed Australia 3-2 to advance to the gold medal game. In the bronze medal game, Australia scored three goals before the game was even ten minutes old, and they rode that early lead to a 6-2 victory over the Netherlands for the bronze medal. Spain and Germany battled in a tight affair, but Christopher Zeller's 16th minute goal was the difference as Germany downed Spain 1-0 to capture the gold medal!\n\nThe women's tournament featured twelve teams, and there was hope that the Chinese squad would follow Australia's lead in capturing the gold medal on home soil. Pool A saw the Netherlands and China move on while Pool B had Germany and Argentina emerge as the top-two teams. The first semi-final pitted China against Germany, and the Chinese would rally from a 2-1 deficit to beat the Germans 3-2 and advance to the gold medal game! In the other semi-final, the Netherlands met up with Argentina where Maartje Paumen put on a show in scoring three times, allowing the Netherlands to get by Argentina by a 5-2 score. The bronze medal game saw Argentina jump out to a 2-0 lead before they exchanged goals with the Germans in the second half. With the 3-1 victory, Argentina captured the bronze medal! The gold medal match saw the Dutch team play extremely well as they notched a pair of second-half goals to win the gold medal over China by a 2-0 score!\n\nThere are all of the winners since 1980 on both the men's and women's sides. Here's how the medal standings break down since the introduction of the women's tournament at the Olympics:\n\nMEN'S STANDINGS\n\nGERMANY: 2 gold, 3 silver.\n\nAUSTRALIA: 1 gold, 1 silver, 3 bronze.\n\nNETHERLANDS: 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze.\n\nSPAIN: 3 silver.\n\nGREAT BRITAIN: 1 gold, 1 bronze.\n\nPAKISTAN: 1 gold, 1 bronze.\n\nINDIA: 1 gold.\n\nKOREA: 1 silver.\n\nUSSR: 1 bronze.\n\nWOMEN'S STANDINGS\n\nNETHERLANDS: 2 gold, 1 silver, 3 bronze.\n\nAUSTRALIA: 3 gold.\n\nGERMANY: 1 gold, 2 silver.\n\nARGENTINA: 1 silver, 2 bronze.\n\nKOREA: 2 silver.\n\nZIMBABWE: 1 gold.\n\nSPAIN: 1 gold.\n\nCZECHOSLOVAKIA: 1 silver.\n\nCHINA: 1 bronze.\n\nUSSR: 1 bronze.\n\nUSA: 1 bronze.\n\nGREAT BRITAIN: 1 bronze.\n\nClearly, there isn't a dominant team like India was for so many years on the men's side, but you'd have to think that the British men and women are going to give it their all with them playing in front of their home crowds. We'll break down some of the rules of the game in the next entry, and we'll start to preview some of the teams that have already qualified for the Olympics in the future.\n\nUntil then, keep your sticks on the field!\n\nEvery once in a while, a dynasty comes along in a sport and there's little, it seems, that can derail that team. Sure, there are players that come and go, but there aren't many teams that can string together a long line of success year after year in most sports. Ice hockey has seen a few dynasties in its history, but there is one team that truly was a juggernaut in the sport of field hockey for a long, long time.\n\nThe Olympic Games have featured men's field hockey since 1908, but women didn't get the inclusion to the Olympic field hockey event until 1980 in Moscow. There has been one team who seemingly have dominated this Olympic event, resembling the Soviet Union ice hockey squad in terms of their medal haul.\n\nIf you get confused by this paragraph, just hang in there. The first Olympic field hockey competition saw England, playing as Great Britain, beat Ireland, playing as Great Britain, by an 8-1 score for the gold medal while Scotland, playing as Great Britain, and Wales, playing as Great Britain, were the semi-finalists who lost. In short, Great Britain finished in the top-four spots in the tournament. Germany and France also participated, but they finished in fifth and sixth, respectively.\n\nField hockey was excluded from the Summer Olympics in 1912 in Stockholm, but the sport returned when the Olympic Games were held in Antwerp, Germany in 1916. Great Britain successfully defended its gold medal after the round-robin play, but Denmark would be the team that captured the silver medal. Belgium captured the bronze medal while France was left on the outside of the medal podium in the four-team tournament.\n\nThe 1924 Paris Olympic Games would exclude field hockey again, but, with the help of the newly-formed Fédération Internationale de Hockey sur Gazon (FIH), the sport made a triumphant return with a standardized set of rules to the 1928 Amsterdam Olympic Games. It was here where the world was shocked and awed by a juggernaut Indian team. And this was only the start of the domination by India over the next thirty years.\n\nIndia played in Pool A with Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland, and Austria. The Indian team steamrolled their way to a 4-0-0 record, scoring 26 goals-for while surrendering zero goals! They would meet the winner of Pool B which turned out to be Holland. Again, the Indian squad showed just how dominant they were in controlling the game while downing the Dutch team by a 3-0 score. India would capture its first gold medal, the Netherlands would take home silver, and Germany would take home te bronze medal.\n\nIndia once again dominated in the 1928 Los Angeles Olympics as only three teams competed that year: India, the United States, and Japan. India hammered Japan 11-1 before crushing the US by a 24-1 score to capture the gold medal once again. Japan defeated the US 9-2 in their game, giving the Japanese the silver while the US took home the bronze medal.\n\nAt the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, there were a vast number of countries that participated. However, India was once again the most dominant team at the event. India downed Austria, Hungary, and the US in its pool by a combined score of 20-0, and then proceeded to destroy France 10-0 in the semi-final before crushing the host Germans 8-1 in the final. For a third straight Olympic Games, India had won the gold medal. Germany, as stated above, took silver while the Netherlands beat France for the bronze medal.\n\nWith the Olympic Games being interrupted by World War II, there was a break of twleve years before field hockey would be played at the Olympic level. The 1948 London Olympic Games featured 13 countries, and India found itself atop its pool again after outscoring Argentina, Austria, and Spain by a combined 19-1 score (Argentina had the lone goal against India). In the semi-final, India downed the Netherlands by a 2-1 score before advancing against the host British team. Great Britain was no match for India, and the students who once learned the game from British servicemen laid a 4-0 loss on Britain to capture the gold medal. The Netherlands would defeat Pakistan for the bronze medal. Unknowingly, though, the field hockey powers were beginning to shift.\n\nThe 1952 Helsinki Olympics saw a different format take place as the top-four teams from the previous Olympics - India, Great Britain, Netherlands, and Pakistan - were given first-round byes in a playoff tournament. Despite eight more teams joining them in the tournament, these four teams would end up in the semi-finals again. India would beat Great Britain by a 3-1 score while the Netherlands would beat Pakistan by a 1-0 score. In the final, India hammered the Netherlands for their fifth-straight Olympic gold medal while Great Britain beat Pakistan 2-1 for the bronze medal.\n\nThe 1956 Olympic Games took place in Melbourne, Australia, and everyone came in knowing that the Indian team was still a superpower. India destroyed Pool A as they went 3-0-0 with 36 goals-for and not one against in defeating Singapore, Afghanistan, and the United States. India drew Germany in the first semi-final, and handed the Germans a 1-0 loss to advance to the final. In the second semi-final, Pakistan finally overcame their previous losses by downing Great Britain by a 3-2 score. India, however, was too much for Pakistan in the final, and they captured their sixth gold medal in six straight Olympic Games with a 1-0 win. Germany captured the bronze medal with a 3-1 win over Great Britain. Great Britain, having finished second, third, and fourth in consecutive years, wouldn't see the podium for another 28 years after 1956.\n\nThe 1960 Olympic Games were set in Rome, and there were 16 teams in the event. India blew through Group A by downing Denmark, New Zealand, and the Netherlands for a 3-0-0 record. The only team to score on India was the Netherlands in a 4-1 loss as India scored 17 goals against the three teams. The 1956 silver medalists from Pakistan emerged from Group B in impressive fashion. They downed Australia, Poland, and Japan while scoring 21 goals and not allowing a goal. Kenya, in an upset, took Group C over Germany while Spain won Group D over Great Britain. India and Great Britain met in the first semi-final, and India secured a 1-0 victory. Pakistan and Spain met in the second semi-final, and Pakistan advanced to the final with a 1-0 win. In the final, the Pakistani team carried the play against India, and, in a huge upset, downed India by a 1-0 score to capture their first gold medal. Spain downed Great Britain in the bronze medal match by a 2-1 score.\n\nThe 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan saw 15 teams participate. Pakistan went 6-0 to win their pool while India went 5-0-2 to win the second pool. In the semi-finals, Pakistan downed Spain 3-0 while India dispatched Australia with a 3-1 win. The finals for the third straight year featured India and Pakistan, and India would reclaim their Olympic gold medal with a 1-0 victory over Pakistan. Australia would capture the bronze medal with a 3-2 win over Spain.\n\nThe 1968 Olympic field hockey event has very few details that I could find, but I was able to piece together a few items. For the first time in nine Olympic Games, India would not participate in the gold medal game as they lost in the semi-final to Australia. Pakistan, however, would play for gold again as they defeated West Germany in their semi-final game. Pakistan would once again capture gold as they beat Australia 2-1 in the final while India would take home a bronze medal with their 2-1 victory over West Germany.\n\nThe 1972 Olympic field hockey event from Munich was marred by some very unsportsmanlike behaviour from one of the 16 teams in the event. West Germany and Pakistan finished one-two in their pool while India and the Netherlands finished one-two in their pool, respectively. Pakistan met India in the first semi-final, and Pakistan would down India by a 2-0 score. West Germany and the Netherlands would play in the second semi-final, and the West Germans would advance after downing the Netherlands by a 3-0 score. The bronze medal match would see India defeat the Netherlands by a 2-1 score, but the real action happened in the final.\n\nAfter West Germany defeated Pakistan by a 1-0 score, the Pakistani team proceeded to disrespect the West German team by turning their backs on the raising of the West German flag in victory after they felt that the umpiring in the game was suspect. They wore their silver medals on their feet, and they destroyed the locker room that they were in. After having seen the death of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games, the punishment was harsh for Pakistan: a lifetime ban for the 11 Pakistani field hockey players. After some apologies, the ban was reduced to two years. It should be noted that this was the first gold medal won by a team other than India or Pakistan in 44 years, and the first gold medal for a European team since 1920!\n\nThe final Olympic Games we'll look at today are the 1976 Olympics from Montreal. The eleven teams were broken up into two pools. Group A saw Australia and the Netherlands advance while Group B saw Pakistan and New Zealand advance. Australia would down Pakistan by a 2-1 score in their semi-final game while New Zealand would beat the Netherlands by the same score in their semi-final game to set up an all-Oceania final. After a hard-fought match, New Zealand scored the 1-0 win over Australia while Pakistan would capture the bronze medal with a 3-2 win over the Dutch squad.\n\nThe final chart from the first 13 Olympics that featured field hockey show the medal count as follows:\n\nIndia - 7 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze.\n\nPakistan - 2 gold, 3 silver, 1 bronze.\n\nGreat Britain - 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 bronze.\n\nGermany - 1 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze.\n\nNew Zealand - 1 gold.\n\nNetherlands - 2 silver, 2 bronze.\n\nAustralia - 2 silver, 1 bronze.\n\nUSA - 1 silver.\n\nSpain - 1 bronze.\n\nJapan - 1 bronze.\n\nBelgium - 1 bronze.\n\nIt's clear to see that India, with ten medals, was the powerhouse team in field hockey for forty years. Pakistan came on towards the start of the 1980s, but India was by far the most dominant team in field in some time.\n\nJust as the Soviet Union dominated ice hockey for a long stretch, the Indian team was the pinnacle of the field hockey world. Coming up shortly, we'll look at the more modern Olympic competitions when the women were included into the tournaments.\n\nUntil then, keep your sticks on the field!\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint where a game got its start simply due to the various versions of the game that have been played throughout history. Ice hockey's start is still being debated today, but we're fairly sure it started somewhere in Canada. When it comes to field hockey, however, there doesn't seem to be an exact point in time or even a location where the game got its start. We do know that the modern version of the game has a specific starting point, but the history of field hockey in the past is something more of a mystery.\n\nThe game of field hockey can trace its roots back to a few places of interest. The Greeks were known to have played a game called \"Κερητίζειν\" (\"kerētízein\") as far back as 200 BC, and it resembled field hockey in that a curved horn was used to propel a ball-like object into a defined goal. It differed in a number of ways as well, but the idea of using a curved object that players swung to hit a ball seems like it might have some relation in how field hockey may have evolved.\n\nThere are reports that the Daur people of Inner Mongolia have been playing a game similar to field hockey for over 1000 years called \"Beikou\". Beikou sees a ball-like bundle of apricot root used in place of a ball, and players hitting the root bundle with sticks. The game itself is played in two fifteen-minute halves. Again, this seems like a fairly close description of field hockey, but night games are certainly different as the root bundle changes to a felt-covered ball. That felt-covered ball is set on fire, and players chase the fiery ball around.\n\nThe British have also laid claim to have started playing a sport that certainly is the closest resemblance to field hockey. In 1363, Edward III of England, in order to push the decadence of archery, issued the proclamation: \"[M]oreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games.\" His mention of hockey makes it clear that some sort of hockey-type game is being played in England in 1363, so there could be a relation to the current game of field hockey.\n\nBy all accounts, however, the modern game of field hockey as we know it today got its start in England in the mid-19th century. It was here that the game started its major evolution into the second largest team sport in the world while being played in over 100 countries. The Blackheath Football and Hockey Club was formed in 1861, and became the first organized field hockey club on the planet. The game rapidly grew in popularity in England, and the Teddington Hockey Club radically helped to form the modern game by introducing the striking circle and changing the ball to a sphere from a rubber cube.\n\nThe game followed the British across Eurasia during its reign. In the 1870s, the game was brought to India by British soldiers, and the first clubs were formed in India for field hockey by 1885. Two major tournaments had begun within ten years in India, and the sport's popularity grew within the region in spades. Before long, India and Pakistan had formidable teams made up from local citizens.\n\nThe game continued to follow British servicemen abroad. The sport moved into Australia and New Zealand near the start of the 20th century, and field hockey became increasingly popular in those countries as well.\n\nBack home, this new sport that was being played all over Britain began to expand its borders. Germany, Holland, France, Belgium, Poland, and the Scandinavian countries all saw the sport cross into their countries, and each has seen the sport grow in popularity. Needless to say, field hockey \"fever\" gripped western Europe, India and Pakistan, and the Australian islands very quickly.\n\nIn Canada, the game arrived in the late-19th century as part of the British Commonwealth's influence, but it never really caught on as it did in Eurasia. The game was played where it could find a niche, but the summer sport of choice in Canada during the late-1800s and 1900s was lacrosse. Field hockey never really grabbed the attention of the British servicemen who were here due to lacrosse being far more popular upon the arrival of field hockey.\n\nWhere it did catch on in Canada, however, was in the province of British Columbia. As early as 1896, records have been found of clubs playing field hockey on Vancouver Island and school records have shown that school teams on Vancouver Island were playing field hockey as early as 1903. The game was definitely a fixture on the west coast where lacrosse was not as popular as it was in eastern Canada, and the game found a foothold there for the better part of a century.\n\nBack in England, the Hockey Association was founded in 1886 in order to track club play and establish clear rules for the game that all clubs would follow in order to remove regional rules. In clarifying the rules and laying the groundwork for all clubs to play the game by, the very first international match was played between Ireland and Wales in 1895. The Irish took that game by a 3-0 score, but there were still some concerns over the differing sets of rules being used in different countries.\n\nAfter that historic game, the International Rules Board was founded in 1900. This Board diligently worked to take the best rules from a number of regions to define the current rules to be used by all regions and countries whenever a competition was held. By 1908, the rules had been streamlined enough that field hockey appeared for the first time as a Summer Olympic sport at the 1908 London Olympic Games.\n\nHistorically over time, there have been some excellent teams for periods of years. Great Britain, and now England, usually produce solid squads. The Netherlands has always been a threat to capture a medal, and Germany always seems to find a way to hit the podium. India and Pakistan were once powers in this sport, but their dominance seems to be fading as other countries get better. Australia and New Zealand more recently seem to finding their groove in winning medals as well.\n\nTomorrow, we'll look at the Olympic Games of past and see which teams were the favorites when it came to winning medals. A number of the countries listed above will be mentioned often, so you know that they are leading the way in Olympic field hockey events.\n\nUntil then, keep your sticks on the field!"
