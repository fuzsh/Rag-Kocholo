        "text": "Full name: Evgeni Vladimirovich Malkin\n\nTeam: Pittsburgh Penguins\n\nNumber: 71\n\nPosition: Center\n\nHeight: 6’3”/191 cm\n\nWeight: 195 lbs/88 kg\n\nShoots: Left\n\nBorn: July 31, 1986 in Magnitogorsk, RUS\n\nDrafted: Selected by Pittsburgh Penguins in 1st round (2nd overall) of the 2004 Entry Draft\n\nStrengths: Malkin is already one of the most productive all-around center-forwards in the NHL. His elite combination of skill and size has drawn comparisons to Mario Lemieux and Mats Sundin. In international competition, he is a proven natural leader for Russia.\n\nWeaknesses: Malkin at times can disappear in games, but this is becoming increasingly rare. Malkin does not shy away from the physical part of the game, but he has become injury prone in the last few years and has missed significant time.\n\nBiography: In such a young hockey career, Evgeni “Geno” Malkin has already become a leader in the Russian Superleague, in the NHL, and at the international level. While growing up, Evgeni was fortunate to have a hockey-playing father, Vladimir. Unsurprisingly, Evgeni followed in his father’s footsteps and also made it to the hometown Superleague team. In his three seasons with Metallurg, Malkin transformed into a first-line power center. In 2005 Evgeni was chosen as the second overall pick in the NHL draft (only behind Alexander Ovechkin). Remaining in Russia, Malkin was the only point-per-game player in 2005-06, despite not winning the scoring title. Unfortunately for Evgeni, Metallurg couldn’t win the championship while he was there. But he was so valued that his team did whatever it could to avoid his leave to the NHL. Malkin was persuaded to sign a $4 million contract for another year in Magnitogorsk, but during training camp in Helsinki Malkin quietly left his team to meet up with his agent and fly to North America. Such action drew similarities to the defections of Fedorov and Mogilny fifteen years earlier, but it was really a result of a lack of a proper transfer agreement between Russia and the NHL. In Pittsburgh, Malkin was a key factor in making the Penguins a playoff team. He started the season with 7 goals in his first 6 games! Like Ovechkin a year earlier, Malkin won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year. In his second season, Malkin finished second in NHL scoring and first the next year, claiming the Art Ross Trophy. Malkin was also nominated for the Hart Trophy. In the 2009 playoffs, Malkin put up 36 points in 24 games to lead the Penguins to a Stanley Cup victory over the Detroit Red Wings. “Geno” became the first Russian to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP, making a strong case that he is not any worse a hockey player than fellow superstars Ovechkin and teammate Sydney Crosby. After two injury-prone seasons, Malkin returned to dominate the NHL in 2011-12, finishing with 50 goals for the first time and once again leading the league in scoring. In 2012 Malkin also collected his first Hart Trophy as NHL MVP and the Ted Lindsay Award as the best player as voted by players themselves. The Penguins’ early playoff elimination allowed Evgeni to join Russia at the World Championship in 2012. Playing on a line with Avangard Omsk wingers Alex Popov and Alex Perezhogin, Malkin put in one of the most spectacular offensive performances in World Championship history, scoring 11 goals and 19 points, including two hattricks. Russia won the tournament with ease and Malkin won not only his first gold medal but also the tournament MVP prize. For the duration of the NHL lockout in 2012-13, Evgeni returned to his hometown Magnitogorsk with fellow NHLers Nikolai Kulemin and Sergei Gonchar to play for Metallurg. Malkin continued his torrid scoring pace in the KHL, where he finished 3rd in points despite leaving back to the NHL in the middle of the season.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 2003-04 Metallurg-2 Magnitogorsk (RHL-3) 2 1 0 1 8 2003-04 Metallurg Magnitogorsk 34 3 9 12 12 2004-05 Metallurg-2 Magnitogorsk (RHL-3) 2 1 1 2 2 2004-05 Metallurg Magnitogorsk 52 12 20 32 24 2005-06 Metallurg Magnitogorsk 46 21 26 47 46 2006-07 Pittsburgh 78 33 52 85 +2 80 2007-08 Pittsburgh 82 47 59 106 +16 78 2008-09 Pittsburgh 82 35 78 113 +17 80 2009-10 Pittsburgh 67 28 49 77 -6 100 2010-11 Pittsburgh 43 15 22 37 -4 18 2011-12 Pittsburgh 75 50 59 109 +18 70 2012-13 Metallurg Magnitogorsk 37 23 42 65 +23 58 2012-13 Pittsburgh 31 9 24 33 +5 36 Totals RHL/KHL Reg.

He was a natural goal scorer as well as one of the fastest skaters in the world.\n\nWeaknesses: Bure’s defensive skills were below average for a leading star forward, making him frequently labeled as a one-dimensional player. Bure’s knee injuries and surgeries forced him to retire from playing at the age of 32.\n\nBiography: How did Pavel Bure get to be nicknamed “The Russian Rocket” and become one of the best hockey players in the world? It all started when Pavel was a little boy, and his father – Olympic swimming gold-medalist Vladimir Bure – took him to the rink to teach him how to skate. Pavel wore his mother’s figure skates, and held on to a sliding chair so he wouldn’t fall. About a decade later, Pavel joined the legendary CSKA team in Moscow and won the title of Soviet National Rookie of the Year after his first full season. At the 1989 NHL Entry Draft, Bure was selected only 113th overall, so he played another great season with CSKA before he was signed by the Vancouver Canucks. That was also when Pavel’s international career elevated. He played in three World Junior Championships, winning gold in 1989 and silver in the next two years. That was when he became part of one of the most dangerous forward lines at the time: Mogilny-Fedorov-Bure. That line anchored the Soviet Union to gold at the 1990 World Championship. In his first NHL season, Pavel unsurprisingly won the Calder Trophy as the top rookie! He had a pair of 60-goal seasons under the tenure of coach Pat Quinn. In 1994, Pavel’s leadership and talents helped the Canucks reach the 1994 Stanley Cup final, where they lost to Pavel’s future club, the New York Rangers. Then, Bure began to be plagued by injuries. His reunion in Vancouver with Alexander Mogilny did not last long – Bure missed a lot of games in 1996. But the Russian Rocket managed to come back and rock the hockey world again. At the 1998 Olympics, other than winning the silver medal Pavel led all Olympians with nine goals in and was named top forward of the tournament. In March 1999, he was part of a blockbuster deal that sent him to the Florida Panthers. In 2000, Bure led the NHL in goals, with 58, helping his team finish fifth in the Eastern Conference. One of the highlights of Pavel’s career was playing with his brother Valeri at the 2000 All-Star game in Toronto; Valeri helped Pavel win the game’s MVP award. Next season, Bure again led the league in goals. Unfortunately, his next two seasons were not as successful. In March 2002, Pavel was traded to the New York Rangers, but in his first season with the club, he suffered a season-ending knee injury. After a brief stint in the following campaign, Pavel re-injured his knees and formally retired from playing hockey in 2005. Pavel took on a new challenge when he served as the General Manager of Russia’s men’s hockey team for the 2006 Olympics. In 2012, Bure was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fall and on November 2, 2013 his number 10 was retired by the Vancouver Canucks organization.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 1987-88 CSKA Moscow 5 1 1 2 0 1988-89 CSKA Moscow 32 17 9 26 8 1989-90 CSKA Moscow 46 14 10 24 20 1990-91 CSKA Moscow 44 35 11 46 24 1991-92 Vancouver 65 34 26 60 0 30 1992-93 Vancouver 83 60 50 110 +35 69 1993-94 Vancouver 76 60 47 107 +1 86 1994-95 EV Landshut (DEL) 1 3 0 3 2 1994-95 Spartak Moscow 1 2 0 2 2 1994-95 Vancouver 44 20 23 43 -8 47 1995-96 Vancouver 15 6 7 13 -2 8 1996-97 Vancouver 63 23 32 55 -14 40 1997-98 Vancouver 82 51 39 90 +5 48 1998-99 Florida 11 13 3 16 +3 4 1999-00 Florida 74 58 36 94 +25 16 2000-01 Florida 82 59 33 92 -2 58 2001-02 Florida/NY Rangers 68 34 35 69 -5 62 2002-03 NY Rangers 39 19 11 30 +4 16 Totals USSR/Rus.

He was fast and his defensive qualities were better than those of many defensemen. Whether playing for his club or for the national team, Fedorov’s leadership qualities were irreplaceable.\n\nWeaknesses: Sergei Fedorov’s production had been in decline in his last few seasons. He was no longer the dominant playmaker he previously was.\n\nBiography: As a boy growing up in Pskov – an ancient city near Russia’s western border – Sergei had a lot of potential as a hockey player. He was accepted by the legendary Red Army’s junior team at the age of 15. After a vigorous regimen of training, Fedorov did very well. Sergei became friends and linemates with fellow rising stars Pavel Bure and Alexander Mogilny. Their line helped “CCCP” not only win back-to-back junior championships, but the World Championships as well at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1990, Sergei took advantage of an opportunity to make it to the NHL. Fedorov’s defection was not as highly publicized as Mogilny’s, but it was still an important event for hockey. Not knowing English, Sergei joined the Detroit Red Wings with a new number – 91. After his first season Fedorov was chosen to the NHL’s all-rookie team. In the 1993-94 season, Fedorov trailed only Wayne Gretzky in league scoring! That year he won the Hart Trophy (as the Most Valuable Player), the Pearson Award (as MVP chosen by players), and the Selke Trophy (best defensive forward). Sergei was a vital part of Detroit’s Stanley Cup wins in 1997 and 1998, although he missed most of the 1997-98 season due to a contract holdout. The Carolina Hurricanes offered him a $38 million 6-year deal, but the Red Wings matched it. The year before, Fedorov earned a whopping $20 million ($2 million salary + bonuses)! That money helped him create the Sergei Fedorov Fund that helps children not only in Detroit, but in Russia as well. Although becoming a U.S. citizen, Sergei of course continued to play for Russia. He was a key part of Russia’s silver and bronze medal finishes at the 1998 and 2002 Olympics. During the 2001-02 season under Scotty Bowman’s coaching, Fedorov experimentally played defense. Sergei is a rare player who can be committed to defense, but still be the best offensive player on the ice. This was shown in the 2002 playoffs, in which Fedorov recorded 19 points. In 2003, Sergei decided for a change and signed with the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. In 2005, he was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets. After a few mediocre non-playoff years, Fedorov rejuvenated with the Washington Capitals, where he had a leading role in taking them to the playoffs in 2008. In the same year, Fedorov made a successful return to the national team, playing on a line with his Capitals teammates Alexander Semin and Alexander Ovechkin, and leading Russia to its first World Championship gold medal since 1993. In 2009, Sergei returned to Russia to play with his brother Fedor for KHL’s Metallurg Magnitogorsk. Fedorov was an irreplaceable leader on Metallurg, but retired in 2012 after 26 years of professional hockey. Sergei is now the general manager of CSKA Moscow – the hockey club that made him a star.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 1985-86 Dynamo-2 Minsk (USSR-2) 15 6 1 7 10 1986-87 CSKA Moscow 29 6 6 12 12 1987-88 CSKA Moscow 48 7 9 16 20 1988-89 CSKA Moscow 44 9 8 17 35 1989-90 CSKA Moscow 48 19 10 29 22 1990-91 Detroit 77 31 48 79 +11 66 1991-92 Detroit 80 32 54 86 +29 72 1992-93 Detroit 73 34 53 87 +33 72 1993-94 Detroit 82 56 64 120 +48 34 1994-95 Detroit 42 50 30 50 +6 24 1995-96 Detroit 78 39 68 107 +49 48 1996-97 Detroit 74 30 33 63 +29 30 1997-98 Detroit 21 6 11 17 +10 25 1998-99 Detroit 77 26 37 63 +9 66 1999-00 Detroit 68 27 35 62 +8 22 2000-01 Detroit 75 32 37 69 +12 40 2001-02 Detroit 81 31 37 68 +20 36 2002-03 Detroit 80 36 47 83 +15 52 2003-04 Anaheim 80 31 34 65 -5 42 2005-06 Anaheim/Columbus 67 12 32 44 -2 66 2006-07 Columbus 73 18 24 42 -7 56 2007-08 Columbus/Washington 68 11 30 41 -5 38 2008-09 Washington 52 11 22 33 +4 50 2009-10 Metallurg Magnitogorsk 50 9 20 29 +25 47 2010-11 Metallurg Magnitogorsk 48 7 16 23 +4 40 2011-12 Metallurg Magnitogorsk 43 6 16 22 +6 36 Totals USSR/KHL Reg.

Kovalchuk has the potential to top the league in scoring and he is one of the most exciting players to watch. His defensive work is improving.\n\nWeaknesses: Kovalchuk is a passionate player, but can be prone to taking undisciplined penalties. He needs to be ready when opponents are after him.\n\nBiography: Ilya Kovalchuk grew up in Tver, northwest of Moscow. Even though Kovalchuk was born more than a decade after the 1972 Summit Series, he remembers the event very well. His father repeatedly played tapes of those games for Ilya. Kovalchuk wears number 17 simply in honour of Valeri Kharlamov. While being so young, Kovalchuk already had an enormous impact on his teams. He helped elevate Spartak Moscow to Superleague status as he led them to a 1st-place finish in 2001. Same year, at the Under-18 World Championship, Kovalchuk was the tournament’s best player and won gold. He then became the first Russian and only the fourth European ever to be selected first overall in the NHL Entry Draft. Kovalchuk immediately was a force for the Atlanta Thrashers. Ilya and fellow rookie Dany Heatley were amazing together and led their team in scoring. Kovalchuk was chosen to represent Russia at the 2002 Olympics, playing well on a line with his idols Igor Larionov and Sergei Fedorov. At the 2002 NHL Young Stars Game, Ilya ripped the game with 6 goals. Unfortunately, Kovalchuk’s season was cut short after he dislocated his shoulder. Had that not happened, he would have won the Calder Trophy as NHL’s best rookie. While being only twenty years old, Ilya already had developed a reputation for his cockiness, which his teammates love and opponents hate. Also, he was caught in a few games with illegally curved sticks. Kovalchuk’s second season was also full of ups and downs, but he continued to establish himself as one of the league’s best scorers. In 2004, he already won the Rocket Richard Trophy for most goals. During the NHL lockout, Kovalchuk played for the star-studded Ak Bars Kazan team in Russia. Prior to returning to the Thrashers, Ilya played a few games for Khimik in 2005. In January 2009, he was named the captain of the Thrashers. However, Kovalchuk’s greatest achievement to date was scoring the game-tying and game-winning goals against Canada in the final of the 2008 World Championship on Canadian ice. At the next year’s World Championship, Kovalchuk was the tournament MVP as he led Russia to another gold medal, cementing his status as a sports hero of Russia. Russia finished second at the 2010 World Championship, but Kovalchuk played great hockey on a line with fellow masters Pavel Datsyuk and Evgeni Malkin. In February 2010, Kovalchuk was traded from Atlanta to the New Jersey Devils – the team he ended up signing a long-term $100 million contract with that summer. Ilya’s time as a Devil has been a rollercoaster so far. The Devils lasted only one playoff round in 2010 and got off to a horrible start next season. After sitting dead last in the NHL mid-season, New Jersey dramatically switched gears to finish within six points of a playoff spot. Timely game-winning goals by Kovalchuk propelled the Devils’ comeback, although the season was among his least productive. In 2011-12, Kovalchuk rebounded to finish in the top-5 in NHL scoring. He was also the top scorer in the first three rounds of the 2012 playoffs, in which New Jersey lost to the Los Angeles Kings in the six-game final. Ilya played through the playoffs with a back injury. In September 2012, Kovy returned to Russia to play for St. Petersburg during the NHL lockout.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 1999-00 Spartak-2 Moscow (RHL-3) 2 2 1 3 14 1999-00 Spartak Moscow (RHL-2) 49 12 5 17 75 2000-01 Spartak Moscow (RHL-2) 40 28 18 46 78 2001-02 Atlanta 65 29 22 51 -19 28 2002-03 Atlanta 81 38 29 67 -24 57 2003-04 Atlanta 81 41 46 87 -10 63 2004-05 Ak Bars Kazan 53 19 23 42 72 2005-06 Khimik Moscow Region 11 8 5 13 24 2005-06 Atlanta 78 52 46 98 -6 68 2006-07 Atlanta 82 42 34 76 -2 66 2007-08 Atlanta 79 52 35 87 -12 52 2008-09 Atlanta 79 43 48 91 -12 50 2009-10 Atlanta/New Jersey 76 41 44 85 +10 53 2010-11 New Jersey 81 31 29 60 -26 28 2011-12 New Jersey 77 37 46 83 -9 33 2012-13 SKA St. Petersburg 36 18 24 42 +21 12 2012-13 New Jersey 37 11 20 31 -6 18 Totals RHL/KHL Reg.

He is strong, defensively conscious, and plays the physical game really well. Ovechkin is a once-in-a-generation talent for his NHL club and for Russia.\n\nWeaknesses: Ovechkin can have a limited presence in a hockey game and may find himself playing decreased minutes of ice time. Ovechkin can also be prone to making dangerous physical plays, putting himself at risk of injury. Ovy’s scoring rate has been inconsistent in the past few years.\n\nBiography: Alexander Ovechkin has it in his blood not only to be a superstar athlete, but also a champion. His mother Tatiana won two Olympic gold medals in basketball and his father Mikhail was a professional footballer. Alexander, however, became obsessed with hockey from the age of two. He began playing when he was seven years old, but hard circumstances forced Sasha to abandon the game for two years. With the support of brother Sergei and coaches, Ovechkin continued to develop his hockey skills with the Moscow Dynamo organization. While only sixteen, Ovechkin was already making headlines in the hockey world for breaking the scoring record at the Under-18 World Championship. He scored two hattricks in his first Under-20 World Juniors, leading Russia to a gold medal finish. At seventeen, Alexander became the youngest to ever play and score for the Russian senior national team. Since 2005, he has developed as Russia’s top weapon at the Olympics and World Championships. At the club level, Ovechkin continued to shine with Dynamo until he was drafted by the Washington Capitals as 2004’s number-one pick in the NHL entry draft. In his rookie NHL season, Ovechkin rose to unprecedented heights. As one of hockey’s best players, he won the Calder Trophy (rookie of the year), scored over 50 goals and over 100 points (third in the league), scored one of the most creative goals in hockey history, and became the international face of the game – all in one year. In 2007-08, Ovechkin scored more goals in a single season than any other left wing in NHL history (and won the scoring title too)! In both 2008 and 2009, he received the Hart Trophy as the NHL’s most valuable player and the Lester. B. Pearson Trophy as the most outstanding hockey player as voted by NHLers. After helping return the Capitals to the playoffs in 2008, Ovechkin joined his teammates Alexander Semin and Sergei Fedorov to form the most dangerous line of the World Championship, propelling Russia to its first gold medal in fifteen years. The 2009-10 season was a heartbreaking one for Ovi, as he did not lead Russia to an Olympic medal, his President Trophy-winning Capitals got eliminated in the first playoff round, and a few NHL games missed due to injury and suspension caused him to narrowly miss out on winning the goals and points scoring races. The following season presented new challenges to Alexander, including having to play while nursing injuries and a new defensive playing system implemented by Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau. While Ovechkin’s goal-scoring declined, his overall style of game matured. The next Capitals coach, Dale Hunter, continued to implement a defense-first style and freely limited Ovechkin’s ice time, especially in the 2012 playoffs. After another second round NHL playoff exit, Alex immediately accepted another invitation to join Russia at the World Championship. With Caps teammate Semin and centre Pavel Datsyuk, Ovechkin’s line was the strongest as Russia steamrolled through the elimination round to win the gold – Ovechkin’s second. During the NHL lockout of 2012-13, Alex returned to play for his hometown team, Dynamo. Although he didn’t get a chance to play in the KHL playoffs, Dynamo went on to win the Gagarin Cup and Ovechkin qualified to receive a championship ring, having played over half the season for the team. With the NHL resuming in January 2013, Ovy had a strong bounce-back campaign and led the league in goal-scoring, winning his third Rocket Richard Trophy.\n\nClub Stats:\n\nSeason Team GP G A PTS +/- PIM 2001-02 Dynamo Moscow 21 2 2 4 4 2002-03 Dynamo Moscow 40 8 8 16 26 2003-04 Dynamo Moscow 53 13 10 23 42 2004-05 Dynamo Moscow 37 13 13 26 +26 32 2005-06 Washington 81 52 54 106 +2 52 2006-07 Washington 82 46 46 92 -19 52 2007-08 Washington 82 65 47 112 +28 40 2008-09 Washington 79 56 54 110 +8 72 2009-10 Washington 72 50 59 109 +45 89 2010-11 Washington 79 32 53 84 +24 41 2011-12 Washington 78 38 27 65 -8 26 2012-13 Dynamo Moscow 31 19 21 40 +13 14 2012-13 Washington 48 32 24 56 +2 36 Totals RHL/KHL Reg.
