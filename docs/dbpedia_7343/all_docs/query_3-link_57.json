        "text": "DENVER - University of Denver sophomore forward Beau Bennett (Gardena, Calif.) has decided to forgo his final two years of collegiate eligibility after signing a three-year entry-level contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League, Penguins Executive Vice President and General Manager Ray Shero announced Friday. The deal begins with the 2012-13 season and runs through the 2014-15 campaign.&nbsp;\n\nBennett, who was drafted in the first round (20th overall) by Pittsburgh in 2010, finished his two-year DU career with 38 points (13g, 25a) in 47 games. Bennett tallied 13 points (4g, 9a) in 10 games in 2011-12, but missed 33 games with a wrist injury. The 6-1, 190-pound forward had 25 points (9g, 16a) in 37 games in 2010-11.\n\n\"We are happy for Beau that he is realizing his life-long dream to become a professional hockey player,\" DU head coach George Gwozdecky said. \"Beau is big-time talent, who would have put up big numbers for us last season if it wasn't for his injury. We wish Beau continued success and hope to see him in the NHL soon.\"\n\nBennett is the third DU underclassman to turn pro following the 2011-12 season, joining Drew Shore (Florida) and Jason Zucker (Minnesota). He is also the 17th underclassman to sign a professional contract during Gwozdecky's 18-year tenure at DU. Bennett joins Zucker, Shore, Matt Donovan (2011), Marc Cheverie (2010), Joe Colborne (2010), Patrick Wiercioch (2010), Tyler Bozak (2009), Chris Butler (2008), Brock Trotter (2008), Geoff Paukovich (2007), Ryan Dingle (2007), Paul Stastny (2006), Matt Carle (2006), Brett Skinner (2005), Mark Rycroft (2000) and Matt Pettinger (1999) as Pioneers who left school early to turn pro since 1999.
