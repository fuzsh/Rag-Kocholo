He was there at the start of my NHL career, including my first game. He vividly recalls how it all began for me in Manhattan, and so do I. Coming to New York, directly from the Kitchener Rangers, I was thrust right into a tension-filled series. We were down two games to none after the club had lost the first two games to the Maple Leafs in Toronto. Defenseman Doug Harvey, who was our player-coach at the time, put me on a line with Johnny Wilson and Dave Balon during my first practice with the big team. It was a full house at the Garden, 15,925 fans roaring their heads off. The way the Garden was built, with balconies and mezzanines overhanging the ice, you always had the feeling you were in the middle of a boiler factory. It was wild! They soon quieted down for the playing of the “The Star-Spangled Banner,” but erupted again when it ended. This wasn’t very good for my nervous system. Because it was a playoff game, I was jumpier than before. Maybe a premonition that I was going to be put right into the game gave me the shakes. I was right. Just as Harvey said, I was sent out on a line with Balon and Wilson. At first I was uneasy. We were skating against a veteran Toronto team with aces such as Frank Mahovlich, Bob Pulford, Dave Keon, and Allan Stanley. These fellows knew the ropes. They’d been in the Stanley Cup playoffs before and they were tough. For the first two periods I made it my business\n\nvii\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd vii\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nviii | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\njust to try to keep up with them and not get too fancy until I had the feel of the ice and the opposition. I also wanted to be sure that I got used to Balon and Wilson. It wasn’t easy to do. This was a wild game; the goals were bouncing in like ping-pong balls over a net and nobody was waiting around for Rod Gilbert to get used to NHL hockey. But as the game progressed, I realized that I was able to keep up with the Maple Leafs and I began getting my scoring chances. Late in the third period our line was sent on the ice. We outfeinted the Toronto trio who was guarding us and moved over the blue line in the Toronto zone. I captured the puck and, out of the corner of my eye, noticed that Balon was free. I sent the pass directly to him and he shot it past Johnny Bower. We won the game 5–4, and my assist had helped. My second game was even better. There had been talk that, since we did so well in the last game, our line would be used even more by Coach Harvey. Sure enough, he put us on the ice for the opening faceoff to start the game. The play was in motion. We moved the puck into the Leafs’ end of the ice. Bower was out of position. The puck landed on my stick. Nothing but me and some air behind Bower. I fired the rubber and it hit the twine behind him. I had scored my first NHL goal—at :41 of the first period in the playoffs, no less! I danced around on the ice like a madman and then dived into the net to retrieve the puck. I wanted to save it for my collection, so I skated with it to the Rangers bench and handed it to our trainer, Frank Paice. The goal filled me with a sense of exuberance, describable only by telling you that it was like being pumped up with several hundred pounds of helium. I was so excited that I felt I would fly right out of the arena unless I kept my mind on the game. That wasn’t hard because the Maple Leafs hadn’t given up. They counter-attacked and gave our goalie, Gump Worsley, plenty of trouble. Before the period ended, our line again moved the puck into the Toronto zone. Wilson and Balon passed it back and forth like a yo-yo. Then the puck aimed in my direction. As soon as it touched my stick I flipped it past Bower. When the red light went on I couldn’t believe it. At 15:46 of the first period we were ahead 2–0. As soon as we returned to the bench I leaned over and asked Muzz Patrick, who was sitting behind me, to do something he may never have done before: “Muzz, do me a favor and give me a pinch. I think I’m dreaming.”\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd viii\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nForeword | ix\n\nRod Gilbert is presented with the Most Popular Ranger award for the 1964–65 season.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd ix\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nx | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nWe won the game 4–2. What made the night even more exciting was my pass to Balon, who scored the third and winning goal of the game. That night was by far the biggest thrill of my life up until then. Now the sky was the limit. I began dreaming impossible dreams and wondering just when I would come out of it, hoping always that I wouldn’t. We never did win the series with Toronto but my dreams kept getting better season by season. I had 24 and 25 goals in my second and third seasons. Despite vertebrae surgery, I returned and in 1970–71 I teamed up with my childhood buddy, Jean Ratelle, and Vic Hadfield. Our chemistry was terrific, and in 1971–72 all three of us got 40 goals and we were named the GAG Line, as in “goal a game.” That season was the closest I came to being on a Stanley Cup-winner. We took the Boston Bruins to six games of the Finals but, in the end, we couldn’t stop Bobby Orr, who scored the Cup-winner in Game 6. Still, I have to be pleased to have played almost two decades in the world’s greatest league and all of them with the same team, the Blueshirts, something I’ll always be proud of. Really, that completed my dream. During all those years, I’ve known Stan Fischler as a journalist and a friend. He and Hal Bock helped me write my book, Goal—My Life on Ice, and Stan, like me, continues to be part of the Rangers scene. For these reasons alone, he is the right person to have authored this book, We Are the Rangers. Rod Gilbert and Stan Fischler—we are the Rangers! —Rod Gilbert New York Rangers, 1960–78 Hockey Hall of Fame inductee, 1982\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd x\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nIntroduction With all due immodesty, I must say that We Are the Rangers is a most appropriate title for this book. After all, I became a distant member of the Blueshirts family at age seven— in 1939—when I saw my first hockey game at Madison Square Garden. A mere 15 years later—in 1954—I became an official Rangers employee at the enormous sum of $50 per week. I was hired to be the assistant publicist by manager Frank Boucher, although my immediate boss—and the chap who really wanted me on the roster—was Herb Goren, the chief publicist and former baseball and hockey writer for the defunct New York Sun newspaper. Over the intervening decade-and-a-half, from 1939 through 1954, I assiduously worked my way into a paying position with the Rangers, but it was a long, convoluted trail. My original favorite National Hockey League team was not the Rangers; it was the Toronto Maple Leafs and it remained so until 1951 when my favorite player, defenseman Bashin’ Bill Barilko, died in a plane crash a few months after scoring the Stanley Cup–winning goal for Toronto against the Montreal Canadiens. I was not only stunned to the very core by Barilko’s departure; I was equally dismayed when the Leafs high command picked a former schoolteacher named Hugh Bolton to replace my hard-hitting hero. By sheer, fortuitous coincidence, Boucher and Goren were brainstorming about ways and means to encourage fan support and came up with the absolutely brilliant idea of organizing a Rangers Fan Club, which they did. xi\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd xi\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nxii | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nToo bad they didn’t consult me. A few years earlier, I had joined The Blue Line Club, otherwise known as ardent supporters of the Rangers farm club, the New York Rovers, which played matinees every Sunday at the Garden. No shabby outfit, this. The Blue Liners, led by a chap named Howard Frank, did things right. They sponsored road trips to venues such as Atlantic City; they put on a very professional song-and-dance end-of-season show for players and fans; and, best of all, they welcomed a young hockey nut like me. With that experience, I became a valued member of the Rangers Fan Club and that included co-editing a monthly mimeograph journal called The Rangers Review. Among other assets, the Review enabled me—along with such noble associates as Jerry Weiss and Fred Meier—to actually interview players in person, which we did as avidly as you can imagine. One of my most vivid memories was an interview Meier and Yours Truly conducted with Rangers forward Ed Kullman. He was staying at the Hotel Belvedere on 49th Street across from the old Garden, resting before a game that night. Kullman was in bed as we hurled question after question at him. Eddie obliged, being the gentleman that he was (except on the ice, as Rocket Richard would attest), and made it so easy for us that the MeierFischler tandem was off and running as hockey journalists. On the political side, I managed to finagle my way up to the Fan Club’s vice presidency, a position I would later use to write two stinging letters to thenNHL president Clarence Campbell. After all, I represented 500 Fan Club members and we strongly resented Campbell’s handling of the GeoffrionMurphy incident in the 1953–54 season. In a nutshell, what happened was that Boom Boom Geoffrion, then a Canadiens star, nearly killed youthful Rangers forward Ron Murphy with a baseball swing with his stick to Murph’s head. The Blueshirts prospect survived with a broken jaw while Campbell’s penalties were virtually equal. In my letter I demanded that Campbell further punish Geoffrion. Gentleman that he was, the NHL president replied with a formal letter that essentially told me to go fly a kite! No problem. By this time I had my foot in the Rangers office door. In addition to my chores with the Review and the Fan Club, I arranged during\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd xii\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nIntroduction | xiii\n\nmy senior year at Brooklyn College to be empty of classes on Fridays so that I could do more hockey writing at MSG. This time I approached the Blueshirts business manager, Tom Lockhart, who also ran the Eastern Hockey League and the Rovers as well. I offered to write—gratis, of course—a weekly newsletter for his Eastern League that could be distributed to all the fans. Lockhart agreed, and I was off and running, writing and delivering the newsletter to the Rangers offices every Friday. Better still, Herb Goren got wind of it, took due note that I reminded him of himself, Goren, at the same age (21), and filed the thought in the back of his cranium. My next step was yet another case of incredibly lucky timing, thanks to a note informing me that it was time to visit with my college faculty advisor. His name was William Pitt and—no kidding—he was a direct descendent of the William Pitt of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania fame. The first thing Professor Pitt wanted to know was what my occupation ambition was at that moment. I respectfully replied that I wanted a job in hockey. “Did you say hockey?” Pitt shot back. I cheerfully repeated my wish. At that moment, Pitt picked up his telephone and called Stan Saplin, who just happened to be the Rangers beat writer for the New York Journal-American newspaper. It was Hearst’s flagship evening daily in North America. Prior to his stint at the J-A, Saplin had been Goren’s predecessor as PR man for the Rangers. Within seconds, Pitt had arranged for me to have lunch with Saplin at the paper’s South Street office in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge. Saplin ordered me a cup of coffee in the J-A’s cafeteria and then proceeded to tell me, “Stay outta hockey.” I couldn’t believe my ears but Stan’s point was that I should diversify. I insisted that I wanted hockey more than anything. As it happened, Saplin was one of those who helped me get the Rangers job; second assist to William Pitt. I graduated from Brooklyn College in 1954 and became a member of the Blueshirts organization in September of that year. To say that I had lived a dream come true would be battering a bromide right through the ice. Then again, all my years of scrapbook-collecting, reading—and learning from— endless hockey stories, and the Fan Club writing experience all had paid off at the rate of $50 per week.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd xiii\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nxiv | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nMy year as a junior press agent for the Rangers was all I hoped it to be except for the fact that we had a losing team and missed the playoffs by a mile-and-a-half. No matter; every day and night I was meeting hockey people, networking (although that word was not known then), and planning to be a Rangers employee for life even though I was furloughed for the summer. But a couple of significant events would change all that. For one thing, Stan Saplin, who had become my mentor, left the JournalAmerican to become a public relations executive for New York University. His job as Rangers beat writer was filled by Dave Anderson, who had been writing a column about Brooklyn–Long Island sports. Saplin urged me to replace Anderson but I didn’t want to leave the Rangers. During August of 1955, I huddled with Goren at an Automat cafeteria on 42nd Street and explained the situation. I was hoping that he’d urge me to come back to the Rangers, but being a wise newspaperman at heart, Herbie knew that the J-A offered a terrific opportunity for me as a sports journalist. I took his advice but managed to stay involved with the Rangers by covering the Blueshirts for The Hockey News. And when Anderson moved from the Journal-American to The New York Times, I got the Rangers beat and held it until the Journal merged in 1966 with the World-Telegram and HeraldTribune. By then my wife, Shirley, and I took over the New York Bureau of The Toronto Star and I continued my coverage of the Blueshirts. Eventually, I made my way into hockey broadcasting on television and, lo and behold, I’m now back where I started: an employee of Madison Square Garden Network, even reporting on the Rangers from time to time. Apart from raising a family, hockey has been my life and so have the Blueshirts. Hence We Are the Rangers could not be a more natural enterprise for a guy who originally went to work for the team 59 years ago. When I decided to write about the team that I grew up knowing as the Broadway Blueshirts, I had an assortment of thoughts, some of which had to be deleted for space purposes. The title itself—We Are the Rangers—connotes more than just the fellows who scored the goals and stopped the pucks. I have found during more than a half-century covering the team that some of the most interesting characters\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd xiv\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nIntroduction | xv\n\nwere those in the front office and those who even picked out the sticks for the shooters. Gerry Cosby was a good case in point, as you will see. My fascination with the team’s history magnified during the year I worked at the Garden in publicity. One day I discovered, far in the recesses of a long closet, a collection of skates and hockey sweaters. Since I had been playing ice hockey for fun in those days, I pulled out some of the skates just to see what they were all about. Each pair had a name on it and I soon realized that the skates belonged to players on the 1940 Stanley Cup winners. In those days the skate of choice was called a CCM Tackaberry. The Tackaberry part related to the Australian kangaroo leather, which then was used as part of the skate boot. Out of curiosity I picked out several skates to see if my feet could fit in them. After several tries the skate that belonged to Dutch Hiller fit perfectly. I took the pair home and later had them sharpened at the Brooklyn Ice Palace by a fellow named Tubby Ensign, who was amazed that the blade still had enough steel left to be used for at least a year or two. And so they were, although I hardly scored as many goals as Hiller did during his halcyon days as a Ranger. Having worked in an office so reeking with history, I couldn’t help but learn about other fascinating aspects of New York’s NHL lore. One of the other finds in that endless closet was a white-and-red sweater that belonged to the Springfield Indians. It so happened that Springfield was a farm team in the American Hockey League of the New York Americans and this jersey was worn by Hall of Famer Eddie Shore when he bought the club late in 1930 and actually skated occasionally for the Indians. Over the years fellows such as Tommy Lockhart—who wore more hats than anyone in hockey—fed me stories about their colorful past. Cal Gardner actually told me the story about how he fought with Ken Reardon when the latter was a defenseman for the Montreal Canadiens. One of my favorite stories was another of Gardner’s, only this time from when he was a member of the Boston Bruins and actually “talked” the Rangers out of a playoff berth by virtue of a conversation with then-Ranger Max Bentley. You’ll have to read the Gardner chapter to understand how that happened.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd xv\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nxvi | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nEqually dear to me is the Wally Stanowski chapter. This germinated from a visit to the Gerry Cosby Sporting Goods store many years ago. The owner, Gerry’s son Mike, mentioned that he had gone to college with Stanowski’s son Skip, who was an excellent university hockey player. What’s more he put me in touch with Skip, who in turn connected me with his illustrious father, who played on several Stanley Cup–winning teams in Toronto. Yet Wally confessed to me that his most enjoyable hockey experience was with the Rangers. I’m tickled that Wally, at 94 years old, is still hale and hearty, living in Toronto. He remains the oldest living Ranger, and his contribution to the book, although it only covers a couple of seasons in New York, is very meaningful to me. Let’s not forget that Stanowski played on the 1949–50 Blueshirts who came within an inch of winning the Stanley Cup in a seven-game series with the Detroit Red Wings. More recently I’ve been able to meet Rangers of recent eras and occasionally work on television with the likes of Brian Leetch, Mike Keenan, and Ron Duguay, each of whom has woven many a delightful hockey tale to me. If I share one thing in common with all these characters involved it has been a love of hockey, and I hope you enjoy this work.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd xvi\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I The Early Days\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 1\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 2\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n|\n\nchapter one\n\n|\n\nFrank Boucher From the Royal Canadian Mounties to the New York Rangers BORN: Ottawa, Ontario, October 7, 1901 DIED: December 12, 1977 POSITION: Center, Ottawa Senators, 1921–22; New York Rangers, 1926–44; Coach, New York Rangers, 1939–49, 1953–54; General Manager, New York Rangers, 1948–55 AWARDS/HONORS: Lady Byng Memorial Trophy, 1927–31, 1932–35; NHL Second Team All-Star, 1931; NHL All-Star, 1932–35; Hockey Hall of Fame, 1958\n\nFrank Boucher enjoyed one of the longest runs with one team in NHL history. Nicknamed “Raffles” (a fictional safecracker) because of Boucher’s deft stickhandling skills that seemed capable of breaking into the most difficult safes, he signed with the Rangers in 1926, the club’s first year in the National Hockey League, and eventually became coach of the 1940 Stanley Cup–winning team and later general manager after the retirement of Lester Patrick. Thus his career spanned 29 years including two Stanley Cups in 1928 and 1933. My introduction to Boucher would not come until the early 1950s while I was a student at Brooklyn College and vice president of the Rangers Fan Club. After graduation, I was appointed assistant publicist for the club and Boucher was my boss. He gave me a handsome salary of $50 per week, later hiked to $55 in midseason. Boucher liked me and I loved him like a favorite uncle. In addition to his 3\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 3\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n4 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nsmarts, “Boosh,” as we all called him, was a jocular fellow who annually starred with Joseph Nichols of The New York Times. The pair would do a delightful Vaudeville song and dance act to the tune, “Are You From Dixie.” To this day, the vignette of Boosh and Joe Nick doing their routine is one of my favorite memories. The good news was that during the 1954–55 season, I was able to spend considerable time schmoozing with Boucher; from those chats our friendship tightened and I was able to record many of his tales. The bad news was at the end of the season I was stunned to the core when Boucher was fired and replaced by our thencoach Murray Patrick, the younger son of Lester Patrick. Boucher later became active in Junior hockey in Western Canada, and we remained in touch. Frank died on December 12, 1977, at the age of 76. It could be argued that Boucher was the greatest Ranger of them all, but that’s not the point. The point is that he was my favorite as player, coach, and general manager. Our oral history begins with Boucher talking about his start as a professional player in the Roarin’ Twenties: Are you kidding? Get a bonus for signing my NHL contract? Not on your life. Back in 1921 that’s the way it was. Attitudes were different then. We didn’t have the agents, attorneys, and what-have-you that the Bobby Orrs and Bobby Hulls had later. When the Ottawa Senators asked me to play for them in 1921 I signed a one-year contract for $1,200 and considered myself very lucky and happy to be playing hockey. Nobody cared about images and stuff like that. It’s not that way anymore though; today, hockey players are all business. Why, I once heard that Phil Esposito got paid for a one-hour speaking engagement what I got paid for a whole season! Imagine that. And here I won the Lady Byng Trophy seven times and never made more than $8,500 in one season. Of course, we didn’t have a players’ association in our day and weren’t wrapped up in all those other trappings. Frankly, I don’t know whether it was dedication to the sport or if we were just damn fools. But there’s one thing I’m sure of—I know we had a heck of a lot more fun than they do today. That’s where we had it over them, in the laughs. I’ll never forget that first Rangers training camp. It was the fall of 1926 and Conn Smythe, our manager, had booked us into the Peacock Hotel, which\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 4\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 5\n\nwas right on the outskirts of Toronto. Smythe was later replaced by Lester Patrick but at that time he was organizing the club and he was a real stickler for discipline. One of the things he did was set an early curfew. That was fine except that I had been out having a good time with Ching Johnson and by the time we got back to the hotel that night the place was completely locked. No matter how hard we tried we couldn’t get into the place, so we decided to do the next best thing and head for a hotel downtown. Since there were no cabs around we walked a few blocks to an intersection and discovered a trolley car about to start its first run of the morning. It was about 6:00 am when we got on the trolley and the motorman was an awfully friendly chap. We offered him a bit of the applejack we had been drinking and he proved to be a very congenial host. After about 10 minutes he said he had to start the trolley on its run and asked, “Where are you gentlemen going?” I told him we’d like to head for the King Edward Hotel but at the time I didn’t realize it wasn’t exactly on the same route as the trolley normally would go. The motorman said he’d oblige and before you could say “Jack Robinson” he turned off all the lights except those up front and started downtown. We had gone about three blocks when we came to the first trolley station where a half-dozen or so people were waiting to get on, but our man didn’t slow one bit; he just plowed straight ahead as if the only thing that mattered was getting us to the King Edward Hotel. We passed enough passengers in a mile or so that somebody surely must have phoned the Toronto Transit Commission to complain, but as I said our motorman didn’t seem to care—at least not until we reached a corner where there was a switch. At that point he must’ve realized the tracks weren’t going to take us to the King Edward even though his route was supposed to go directly ahead. Suddenly he gets one of those big steel rods, runs out onto the tracks, and pulls the switch, and off we go toward the hotel. By this time the three of us made quite a barber shop trio and were singing every good song in the book until we looked up and saw the King Edward ahead. Our friend stopped the trolley directly in front of the hotel, shook our hands, and then took off into the early morning.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 5\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n6 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nI was associated with the Rangers for 28 years as a player, coach, and manager and I can say without hesitation that the 1927–28 New York team and the 1939–40 team were the best Rangers clubs of all time and among the finest ever seen in the NHL. Naturally, I’m a little partial to the 1927–28 team because I played on it and I was in my prime then. What made it so great was its two very strong lines—in those day we didn’t have a three- or four-line system as they do today—plus a defense that no club could equal and good goalkeeping. You knew we were good because we won the Cup in strange circumstances. We couldn’t play any of the final Cup games in New York then because Madison Square Garden had other commitments, so all our “home” games had to be played on the road, making it tremendously difficult. We eliminated Pittsburgh and Boston in the opening rounds, then went up against the Montreal Maroons and had to play all the games at the Montreal Forum. That was the series where our regular goalie, Lorne Chabot, got hurt and old Lester Patrick went into the nets. From my own standpoint that was unforgettable because I scored the winning goal at 7:05 of sudden death. Unfortunately, the Maroons were up 2–1 in wins but I scored the only goal in the fourth game and we took it 1–0. So it all boiled down to the fifth game since it was a best-of-five series. After Lester went in as goalie and we won, we got Joe Miller to goaltend for us. He’d been nicknamed “Red Light” Miller because he played for the Americans and they were losers at that time. I personally never thought he was bad, and as things turned out, he was terrific in that last game. Right off the bat we were behind the eight ball. We got a penalty and I was sent out to try to kill the clock until our man returned. For quite a few seconds we did pretty well and then somebody got the puck to me and I found myself at center ice, skating in on Red Dutton, a Maroon defenseman. I knew Red’s weakness—if you pushed the puck through his legs he’d give his attention to it instead of watching you. I tried the trick and, sure enough, he looked down. By the time he looked up I was around him and had picked up the puck, skated in on their goalie, Clint Benedict, and flipped it into the right-hand corner. Not very long after that we got hit with another penalty and Lester sent me out again. My only concern was to stickhandle the puck as much as possible at center ice; however, I suddenly found myself in a position where my only\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 6\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPartXXXXXX | 7 Frank Boucher (7) in front of the Toronto net.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 7\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n8 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nplay was to shoot the puck off the boards and hope to pick up the rebound and keep possession. I miscalculated and shot the puck so far ahead that Dunc Munro, the Maroons defenseman, thought he could intercept it. The puck was about midway between Munro and me, and as I watched him, I realized he was going to try to beat me to it. He came on for quite a run and I could almost hear him thinking, By God, I can’t get there quite in time. He seemed to stop in one motion, then change his mind and go for the puck again. All the while, I was skating madly toward it, and by this time I had reached it. I just swooped over to one side and let Munro go by; I had the whole ice to myself, straight to the goaltender. I moved directly in on Benedict and landed a goal in almost the exact place as I did earlier. We won the game 2–1 and the Cup. It certainly was a tribute to Lester; if he hadn’t gone into the nets when Chabot was hurt I don’t know what we would have done. But that was Lester: a very, very interesting man and a tough taskmaster as well. One funny story about Lester Patrick stands out. We had played in Ottawa one night and won the game with some fantastic score like 10–1 and we went to a party afterward in Hull, Quebec, the town across the river. I guess we stayed long past our curfew but initially decided it was time to get back our Pullman sitting in the Ottawa station. We all knew that Lester must have been asleep so we tiptoed onto the train and kept passing the word along in whispers: “Don’t wake Lester!” It seemed to us that we managed to sneak in without disturbing him—or so I thought until the next morning when I walked into the diner for breakfast. Lester, who was sitting there alone, looked up and said, “Good morning, Mr. Boucher.” As soon as he called me by my last name I knew something was wrong. I sat down next to him and nothing was said for about a minute until Lester offhandedly mentioned to me, “Did you know that Butch Keeling walks in his sleep?” I said, “No, Lester, I didn’t.” To which Lester replied, “Y’know, Frank, that’s very interesting because at about 4:00 in the morning Butch walked into my compartment, peed on the floor, and whispered something about ‘Don’t wake Lester!’” There wasn’t much I could say after that but if you think I was tongue-tied then let me tell you about another situation that really put me on the hot seat\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 8\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 9\n\nfor quite some time. It occurred during the 1930–31 season. Cecil Dillon joined the Rangers as a rookie and it didn’t take long for me to discover I was his idol, but not just as a hockey player. Cecil had been crazy about the Royal Canadian Mountain Police ever since he was a kid, and when he found out that I had once been a Mountie there was nothing I could do to discourage him. It became embarrassing because I was only a Mountie for a short time, as all the other Rangers knew, and had never served in any of the wild Northwest outposts. Dillon nevertheless began to press me about my experiences. At first I thought I’d just let him know that nothing much really had happened to me but I could tell that he was really keen to hear something so I began with a few honest-to-goodness yarns of incidents that actually did occur. They were my best true stories and I hoped they’d be sufficient. I didn’t know whether to be happy or sad about it but Dillon thought my stories were just the greatest things in the world and began begging me to tell some more. Unfortunately, I ran out of true stories and had to make a decision: either let on to Dillon that absolutely nothing else happened that was interesting or start fabricating stories. My mistake was in deciding to do everything possible to make the rookie happy. The next time we sat down I told him a whole pile of fictitious tales. You name it, I did it. Boucher battled the Indians; Boucher commanded a dog team in the Arctic; Boucher was all over the Northwest. When my imagination ran dry I went to the nearest newsstand to pick up a few Western magazines to restore my supply. After a while I even began to hope that Lester might trade Cecil, just to get him off my back. That didn’t happen, though; Dillon was an awfully good hockey player and just as nice a guy to boot. His problem was that he kept wanting more Mountie stories and I had to keep telling them. Once and only once I was nearly exposed. The Rangers were in Atlantic City for some reason and several of us took a stroll on the Boardwalk. When we passed a shooting gallery Dillon asked me to join him in a few rounds, figuring that as a former Mountie my shooting would be super. Actually, I couldn’t shoot the side of a barn. Cecil started shooting first and he was deadly accurate. He had done quite a bit of hunting back home in Ontario so this was second nature to him. When\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 9\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n10 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nhe got through he handed me the gun and I couldn’t touch a thing—not one bloody target! It reached such a point that I could tell Cecil was wearing a long face because he was horrified at my performance. I was about to let on to him that I had been telling a pack of fibs when I suddenly thought of something. I took Cecil aside and mentioned that while he was firing at the targets I had spoken to the fellow running the gallery and had told him to put blanks in my rifle. Cecil fell for it and as long as he played for the Rangers he remained convinced of all those Mountie tales. Maybe that helped me later when I became the Rangers manager, because we needed all the imagination we could get during those bad years. But they didn’t come until later; we had some marvelous teams in the 1930s. After I retired and was made coach we had a wonderful bunch of boys in the 1939–40 season. Yes, that was one of the greatest teams in history. Tops in every position: it started with Davey Kerr in goal; Art Coulter and Murray Patrick as one defense team; and Babe Pratt and Ott Heller on the other. The three forward lines were just fantastic: Phil Watson–Bryan Hextall– Lynn Patrick; Neil and Mac Colville–Alex Shibicky; and Clint Smith–Kilby MacDonald–Alf Pike, with Dutch Hiller as the spare. They were perfect players for a coach because you could encourage suggestions and they’d always come up with something good that we’d practice and eventually use in a game. One result was the “box defense,” where the four players killing a penalty arranged themselves in a box formation in front of the goalkeeper. We had another strategy called offensive penalty-killing which turned out to be the beginning of the modern forechecking. In this one, we tried for goals when we were a man short instead of going into a defensive shell. We’d send out three forwards and one defenseman and we’d forecheck in their own end. Our team was so good it scored more goals over a season than it had goals scored upon it during penalty-killing. Once, though, it backfired on us. We had perfected this system—or so we thought—and went into Chicago with a 19-game unbeaten streak. In that 20th game we played rings around the Black Hawks and should have won by a big margin but for some strange reason we couldn’t score a goal. We were down 1–0 into the third period. During intermission we were batting around ideas in the dressing room when the guys came up with another new one. It was decided that if we were\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 10\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 11\n\nstill down by a goal in the final minute of play we’d pull the goalkeeper and send out an extra skater. Up until that point, the way the system worked you never put the extra man on the ice until there was a whistle for a faceoff. But we thought it’d be better not to make it obvious that we were pulling the goalie; in other words, do it on the fly while the play was still going on. That was the plan. I made one big mistake; I forgot to tell Lester our plan, and on this particular night he was sitting on our bench, which he rarely did in those days. Toward the end of the game, though, he walked over to the Chicago Stadium timekeeper because he didn’t trust him and wanted to keep an eye on the clock. We still were down a goal and the puck was in the opposition’s end of the rink. This was the time to try the new plan and the signal was given for Davey Kerr to come off the ice and for the extra forward to go on. That’s exactly what happened and nobody in the rink knew what was going on except my players—and then Lester. But he didn’t realize that Kerr was removed from the goal. So Lester had thought I made a mistake and put too many men on the ice and started screaming for me to take the “extra” man off before we got a penalty. Paul Thompson, the Black Hawks coach, heard him, and when he saw six men in his zone he started screaming, too. Meanwhile, we had moved the puck into scoring position and the plan was working perfectly. We were about to put it in the net when the referee blew his whistle to give us a penalty. Then he turned around, saw that Kerr was out, and realized there shouldn’t be a penalty at all. But it was too late. The attack was stopped and we lost the game. As things turned out we won the next five games in a row for an overall record of 24 wins or ties in 25 games and went on to win the Stanley Cup. Then the war came and we lost most of our really good players; when it was over a lot of them came back but they had lost a step or two and weren’t really the same. That’s when we had to start rebuilding, which took quite some time. And naturally, when times were bad we used to resort to all kinds of tricks to get people into the Garden. There was one period during the war years when things hit an all-time low. We had lost such fellows as Jim Henry, Murray Patrick, Art Coulter, and Alex Shibicky to the armed forces, and by the time October of 1942 came around,\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 11\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n12 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nFrank Boucher skates with the puck against the Bruins in November 1931.\n\nmore than half our roster that had finished first the previous spring was gone. It was time for training camp to start, and believe it or not, we didn’t have a goalkeeper on hand, not one! Lester was just as worried as I was and I told him the only thing we could do was to check out every town in Canada to see if we could find one. We sent telegrams to all our scouts telling them to wire us if they came across a goalie, and three days later, we got word from our man in Saskatchewan, Al Ritchie. He said he had a chap named Steve Buzinski who’d play goal for us and so I told Ritchie to get him to our camp immediately. Camp was in Winnipeg, as it had been for years, and when we got there and started workouts I discovered that nobody named Buzinski had arrived.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 12\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 13\n\nWell, there was nothing much we could do but sit around and hope that he’d show up; meanwhile we sent the boys through the practice skates and light workouts. After a day or so I really began to get worried but on this particular afternoon we were on the ice when I looked over toward the sideboards and got the surprise of my life. In the Winnipeg Amphitheater the sideboards were quite a bit higher than in other rinks, and as I looked at them I saw this tiny fellow walking along, wearing a black helmet—but all I could see was the helmet over the sideboards. I first thought that it was a “rink rat,” one of those lads who hangs around the rink and cleans the ice between workouts. But soon I saw one goalie pad, then another, climb over the boards, and sure enough, this little chap skated directly to the net. I remember saying to myself when I looked at him, “Oh my gosh, it can’t be him!” This was Steve Buzinski; he not only was small but he was also bow-legged and when he stood in front of the net you saw nothing but holes. We didn’t have much choice, since there were no other goalkeepers around, so Steve was our man when the 1942–43 season started. I can’t say he was the greatest but he did try and he had a strange sense of humor. One night we were playing in Detroit and the Red Wings were scoring on him left and right. Sometime late in the game one of the Detroit players took a long shot and Buzinski nabbed it in his glove and casually tossed it aside, as though he were a Vezina Trophy winner. Just as he did, one of our boys skated by and heard Steve say: “Y’know, this is as easy as picking cherries off a tree!” I can’t honestly say our losing was entirely Steve’s fault but when we found out there was another goalie available with more experience—Jimmy Franks— we got him, but kept Buzinski on the payroll because he was good for his humor and in those days we needed all the humor we could get. Lester finally got rid of him after he refused to attend a practice with our farm team, the Rovers. I believe he told Lester he had some letters to write home and that’s all Lester needed. Buzinski was on the next train to Saskatchewan. The fun didn’t end with Steve. We had some lulus after the war too. Remember Dr. David Tracy, the hypnotist we brought in to help the team win? That was when we were running into tough luck again, in the early 1950s. Tracy was a big bloke who thought he could give the Rangers a winning complex. The night of a Bruins game he talked to Buddy O’Connor and a few\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 13\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n14 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nof the other players and then they went out and lost the game in the final minute. We didn’t see much of Dr. Tracy after that but it wasn’t the end of the gimmicks. Gene Leone, the owner of Mamma Leone’s Restaurant, tried to help us once with what he called “a magic elixir.” He concocted some combination of clam juice or broth and a few other items, put it into a big black bottle, and offered it to the boys in the hopes it would get us going. It worked a lot better than Dr. Tracy had and we actually started winning after Gene created it. Pretty soon the black bottle became a thing around town and Jim Burchard, who was covering hockey for The World-Telegram, decided we should also take it on our road trips. We had a Saturday night game in Toronto and Jim took a plane there, bottle in hand. Damned if we didn’t beat the Maple Leafs 4–2. Now, everybody’s talking about Leone’s black bottle and wondering what’s in it. I don’t think Gene expected to become so popular, and since he was a busy man, he wasn’t able to brew it every time. Once, we didn’t have the magic elixir and we lost to the Red Wings. Burchard claimed that without the bottle we were at a psychological disadvantage. After a while, bottle or not, we got into the old rut and eventually finished in fifth place, out of the playoffs. That was the end of the era of the magic elixir. Of course, my hope was to fill the Garden because we had a good hockey team, not a gimmick. At the same time, I was always trying to think of ways to improve the game. One of my ideas was the use of two goaltenders on a team instead of one. I was a good 20 years before my time since it’s standard practice today, but in the late 1940s it was somewhat revolutionary. At that time, I had two good goalkeepers: “Sugar” Jim Henry and Charlie Rayner. Not only were they teammates, but they were also good friends off the ice and it was always a tough decision whenever I’d have to consider which one to play. I decided to alternate them during the game so I started to change goaltenders every five minutes and it worked. Except I ran into an odd thing once against Toronto when there was only one pair of gloves for them both to use and every time they passed each other during a change they’d transfer gloves, which looked kind of funny at the time. They both lasted with us for a while until we got rid of Henry, though we kept Rayner. Charlie was a good goaltender who helped take us to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1950. But then things got rough again.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 14\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 15\n\nBy 1953–54 we had a horrible hockey team and I had to figure out how to keep the fans from dropping off. That’s when I signed Max Bentley and later talked his older brother, Doug, into coming to New York, even though they both were past their prime. I got Max at the start of the season and he still was good, but a funny sort of character. He was a hypochondriac, always carrying boxes of pills around for all his imaginary illnesses. I had a hell of a time just keeping him playing because of some trivial thing that happened to be bothering him at the time. I felt if I could get Doug to play for us as well he’d get Max to do things he wouldn’t ordinarily. Without Doug, I had to pamper Max. We even brought his cousin, Bev, to New York as our spare goaltender, just to try to keep Max happy. The Bentleys believed in traveling together, like a tribe. If you invited them over it was nothing for 12 to 14 Bentleys—the whole shebang—to come along. So I kept after Doug, trying to get him away from Saskatoon where he was playercoach. Phone calls didn’t work so I finally decided to fly up to Canada and talk directly to him. It took a while—and a lot of money—but I managed to persuade him to take a fling at it with the Rangers. It was worth every penny just to see Doug and Max back together again after all those years with Edgar Laprade on the line with them. I remember Coley Hall of the Vancouver team coming all the way from British Columbia just to see the Bentleys together once more. They scored a whole bunch of goals between them and we beat the Bruins; after it was over Hall said, “That was the greatest thing I ever saw.” Personally, I didn’t think they’d be sensations right off the bat. But they were fantastic, passing and shooting and skating just like in the old days. Doug was the one who put the desire in Max when Max would lose confidence in himself. After they teamed up we gave the Bruins a good run for fourth place but Lynn Patrick was coaching Boston at the time and knew what to do to stop them. Realizing that he couldn’t make Doug back down, he had his players lay into Max. “As soon as Max goes for the puck,” he told them, “you go get him!” They managed to slow Max down but Doug still played beautifully right down to the end. I wish I could say we made the playoffs but it didn’t happen that way; we finished fifth.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 15\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n16 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nJust watching those Bentleys convinced me of one thing: the biggest mistake ever made in hockey was breaking up that team, Max and Doug, when they played for Chicago. They were a funny pair of brothers. While all of this was going on I was trying to build up the farm system, especially the Juniors in Guelph, Ontario. A year after the Bentleys we began to show real progress. Andy Bathgate, Dean Prentice, Harry Howell, and Lou Fontinato all came out of the Guelph Juniors but they were still a little green. We missed the playoffs again in 1954–55, my last season as manager of the Rangers. After that, Guelph kids really developed and the Rangers had a good run of playoff times. It sort of did my heart good to see how they turned out.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 16\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n|\n\nchapter two\n\n|\n\nMyles J. Lane From the Rangers to the New York State Supreme Court BORN: Melrose, Massachusetts, October 2, 1905 DIED: August 6, 1987 POSITION: Defenseman, New York Rangers, 1928–29; Boston Bruins, 1929–30, 1933–34\n\nMyles J. Lane easily could have been mistaken for an All-American football player or even a judge rather than an NHL defenseman for the Rangers. That would not come as a surprise to anyone who knew the tall, handsome scholar-athlete. As a gridder, he starred for Dartmouth College’s varsity team and would later become an attorney and eventually Justice of the New York State Supreme Court. He became a member of the Blueshirts in their third season of existence, 1928– 29, and lasted long enough to become the chief protagonist in one of the funniest front office episodes in history. And while he only played part of one season for New York, his saga is so unique—both as an athlete and jurist—it merits a position in this book. When I met Lane and his wife at their East Side Manhattan apartment, he was 64 years old and still looked like a perfectly formed athlete. Our interview took place in December of 1969, and I still revere the vignette of his gentlemanly deportment and willingness to relate tale after tale of his ventures on ice. 17\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 17\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n18 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nOur oral history begins with Lane recalling his earliest days as a stickhandler in New England. Lots of places across the United States could qualify as “the hockey capital of the nation” but my choice is Melrose, Massachusetts, my hometown. Even before I grew up, hockey was the number one sport there, and some really fine players learned the game in our neighborhood. Many people in the States know the name Hobey Baker since he’s one of the few Americans in the Hockey Hall of Fame, but we had a fellow in Melrose, “Bags” Wanamaker, who in those days was the next best thing to Baker. He wasn’t the only top-notch skater around. Hago Harrington, later a big man in Boston hockey, was also from our area and, like me, played on the big pond in the middle of town whenever it was frozen. I was about six years old when I got my first pair of skates and it was something awful trying to learn on them. I attempted to play with the big boys but could hardly stand up on the blades and was so small my hockey stick would be taller than I was and end up around the faces of my bigger friends. In other words, I was highsticking at the age of six. We had hockey little leagues in grammar school then just as they have in Canada and in parts of the United States now. And, don’t forget, this was back in the early 1920s. It took a bit of time but I soon started to improve my skating and when I reached my teens I was good enough to play defense for our high school team. That was really something. Ours was the best hockey team in the state; we won something like 23 games and lost only one during a single season and that was because we were physically exhausted. I’ll tell you just how good we were. We once scrimmaged with Harvard, the intercollegiate champions, and although they beat us 2–1 in a 60-minute game, it was quite a feather in the cap of Melrose High. That same year we defeated Boston College. Even though I was playing defense for the high school team, I liked rushing and did quite a lot of puck-carrying; I continued to rush right through my college playing career since nobody said, “Don’t do it.” Meanwhile, I played against some really first-rate competition. When I was still in high school I can remember being permitted to play for a team that took on a bunch passing\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 18\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 19\n\nthemselves off as amateurs but who later became the Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets. They were really pros but nobody said anything about it. All of this gave me terrific experience. Here I was, only 16 years old, going up against fellows who were professionals. It provided quite a head start for my college tryout and, in retrospect, it made playing college hockey as easy as rolling off a log. When it came time for me to select a college, I went up to Hanover, New Hampshire, to look over Dartmouth. I had already received three or four football scholarships elsewhere but liked the looks of Dartmouth and decided to go there, although they didn’t give any hockey scholarships. College hockey was very big in those days. We played Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Toronto, Boston University, and M.I.T. Whenever we played in Boston against Harvard or Yale, the arena would be packed, and usually the proceeds for those games went to a charity. At the time my heart was set on graduating from Dartmouth and then going to law school. I didn’t think I wanted to be a professional athlete for the simple reason that a top-notch hockey player couldn’t stay in the NHL for more than eight or 10 years, but one could have a lifetime career by going into law, finance, or some other business. I also figured only the really big stars made the big money. I knew I was taking something of a gamble but my target was law school, not the NHL. Then, in my senior year, our team went up against the University of Toronto, managed by Conn Smythe, who soon left the university to become boss of the Maple Leafs. Apparently he liked the way I played because he contacted me to say he’d like me to join the Toronto Maple Leafs. Naturally, I was flattered but I told Smythe I wanted to go to law school; and if I was going to pursue hockey I would do it with a team in the United States. That way, I could continue my law studies and still play hockey. In those days if a representative of an NHL team talked with you it meant your name was automatically put on that team’s list and no other team could negotiate with you. So I wound up with my name on the Toronto Maple Leafs’ negotiation list. I’ve since heard that Boston had wanted to sign me too because I was a local boy—Melrose is only about seven miles outside Boston—but they couldn’t deal with me on account of Smythe. After a while I convinced Smythe that I\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 19\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n20 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nMyles J. Lane (kneeling, second from left) was a star on the Dartmouth hockey team, which played outdoors until an indoor rink was built in the late 1920s. (Dartmouth Athletic Communications)\n\ndidn’t want to go to Toronto, so the Leafs swapped my name with the New York Rangers and Toronto took a player from the New York list. The Rangers didn’t own me; I was still in college and I hadn’t signed with them. In fact, I didn’t talk to anybody connected with the Rangers until after I had made a trip south that spring with the Dartmouth baseball team. We had gone down to Atlanta and were heading home when I got a wire from Colonel Hammond, the Rangers president. He said he wanted to see me in New York, which was okay with me since we were stopping off at Philadelphia for a game against the University of Pennsylvania. After the game I went up to New York and sat down with him. The first thing he said was that he wanted me to sign, but I replied, “Nothing doing.”\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 20\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 21\n\nAt the time I just wasn’t sure that I wanted to go into hockey. There were other things on my mind, other offers. One was an opportunity to teach at the Taft School in Connecticut, and I couldn’t decide whether I wanted to play one year of hockey or teach one year at Taft, then go to law school. I spoke to Mr. Taft and he said something to me I’ve never forgotten. “Mr. Lane, the job is yours, if you want it. But don’t fool me!” I asked, “What do you mean?” He answered, “Don’t come here for one year and then leave me. It’s a good position if you want to teach for the rest of your life. But don’t fool with me. Let me know if you intend to stay with me or just want to make it a one-year proposition.” “Mr. Taft,” I told him, “I can’t fool you and I can’t give you an answer. I have in the back of my head a desire to go into the law business so I’m not certain whether I’d stay one year or more than one.” Right then and there with that exchange I decided to accept the Rangers’ hockey proposition. In September, I contacted Colonel Hammond and signed with New York, got a bonus, and made a lot more money than any of my college classmates did. When I joined the Rangers they had four defensemen led by Ching Johnson and Taffy Abel. The third man was Leo Bourgeault, a little fellow about 5'8\" and 140 pounds. Leo was a rushing defenseman but too small to do much checking. I was the fourth man. Strangely enough, coach Lester Patrick started me out with Ching. I’ll never forget my first game at Madison Square Garden. I was thrown off the ice three times with penalties and Ching finally came over to me and said, “If you don’t cut this out you’re going to be the bad man of hockey instead of me.” But my penalties were the result of inexperience more than anything else; after all, I was just a rookie. Then, after the game, a funny thing happened. A fellow by the name of Eddie O’Neill was covering hockey for the Associated Press at the time and he came into our dressing room and started interviewing me. His first question was: “How did you feel out there tonight in your first game as a professional?” I replied, “Well, it wasn’t really too bad out there.”\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 21\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n22 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nEddie said, “No, give me an angle. Look, I’m like you—I’m a college man. Was there anything different out there from the kind of hockey you experienced at Dartmouth?” “Look, Eddie,” I told him, “that’s a silly question because you know as well as I do that there’s no comparison between college and professional hockey. It’s an entirely different game, like the difference between minor league baseball and major league ball.” O’Neill went on. “Let me ask you a couple of questions,” he said. “Did you ever play a college game in which you were a lot more tired than you are tonight?” I said, “Of course I did,” and he asked, why. “When I played college hockey,” I replied, “I played as much as 60 minutes without relief. If you’re in a daisy chain for 60 minutes, you’ll still get tired of walking around. But out there tonight I’d get relief every three or four minutes so I wasn’t so tired afterward.” “Wasn’t it rough?” O’Neill asked. “Sure,” I said, “it’s rougher than the college game, but I wasn’t tired because of the relief I got.” When O’Neill was finished I got dressed, returned to my hotel, and went to bed. The next morning I went downstairs for breakfast and ran into the desk clerk, a friend of mine. He asked if I had seen theTimes that morning and when I replied “no” he said, “Here, take a look.” So I picked up the paper and saw a headline across the sports page that read, “LANE SAYS PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY A CINCH COMPARED TO THE COLLEGE BRAND.” That was really something. Worse still, I had to report to the Garden later that day, since it was customary to check in with the club on a daily basis. When I walked into the dressing room there were all those Canadian players and me, just an American collegian—and you could have cut the silence with a knife. I simply told them the headline was a complete fabrication; I had never made such a claim. And that was that as far as the players themselves were concerned. Not long after, we took a trip to Montreal to play the Maroons. This was the English team that represented Montreal in the NHL, and they were big,\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 22\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 23\n\nhusky, and tough. When we arrived in town I picked up a paper and read an article exhorting the populace to come down to the game and watch this upstart American collegian get his comeuppance. The paper went on to say how I had told a reporter what a simple game this Canadian hockey was, and so forth. As expected, the people came streaming into the Forum that night looking for blood and I knew it. On the very first rush I made down the ice two Maroons came at me and tried to put me right over the sideboards. One of them went off with a penalty. I rushed down the ice three times and on those three rushes three Montreal players went into the cooler. The game got rougher and rougher as it went along. Later on, Ching Johnson skated down the ice and was whacked hard by one of the Maroons. He lost his balance and slid into the backboards. Though he threw both his feet up to break the slide, unfortunately his skate got caught in the boards and his ankle twisted around and broke. He was through for the season. After that happened Taffy Abel made a rush down the ice and someone stepped on his foot. He needed 13 stitches to close the wound. That left Leo Bourgeault and myself on defense. We got beaten, and the next night we went to Boston where we again lost. Then it was on to Pittsburgh and a 0–0 tie, followed by a tie with Detroit. That was my introduction to pro hockey, and the reception was all due to some misinformation. Naturally, I could handle myself out on the ice. I was about 6'1\" and 195 pounds and I remembered what Ching had told me at the start: “The first lesson in this game is to protect yourself. Make sure when you bump somebody that your stick is right up in front of you so they don’t give you the stick in the face. When you hit them, hit them hard; hit them clean if you can but always protect yourself because in this game there are no medals for bravery.” So whenever I bumped somebody, I remembered Ching’s advice and never got into much trouble. I got put off the ice quite a bit but never had to drop my gloves and punch. And, after that first incident, I was never really needled about being a collegian. On the whole the guys were very fair. When I was with the Rangers my boss was Lester Patrick, a fine man who treated me fairly, there was no question about it. After a while he suggested\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 23\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n24 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nthat I be sent down to Springfield for some polishing up in the minors. And he was right. If I’d been going to make a career of hockey I would have said “yes” and gone to Springfield but I wasn’t in it for life; I was in it to get enough money for law school. Of course, the Rangers didn’t know that until Lester suggested I go to Springfield. He wanted me there for a month or two and I said I’d go, but on only one condition: that I get my full share of money if the club won the Stanley Cup. He said he couldn’t agree to that and maintained I would have to go down to Springfield. It was February and the season was almost over. “Oh, no,” I told Lester, “I don’t have to go because if you insist that I do, then I’ll just quit hockey.” The next thing I knew I was traded to the Boston Bruins, right there in my first year of NHL hockey. That was fine with me because Boston had a strong team; I came from the Boston area and liked the players on the club. Tiny Thompson was the goaltender. Eddie Shore and Lionel Hitchman were the first-string defensemen with George Owen and myself as secondstringers. Up front we had Harry Oliver, Perk Galbraith, Cooney Weiland, and Dutch Gainor. Dutch was the only man I ever saw in hockey who had a double shift. He’d come at a man, fake it one way, fake it to the other, and then walk right through. Shore was the best of all. He was a lot like Ted Williams in that he could help a teammate if you wanted help. Eddie was very fair about things; if you asked him how to play this or that man, he’d tell you. He didn’t withhold advice. Personally, I liked Shore. He was the greatest hockey player I ever saw. He could skate like Bobby Orr and he could shoot. And he was a great defenseman who could hit. He was a dynamic person who could really lift a team. One night we took off for a game in Montreal; it was a wintry night, snowing and all that. What happens? Shore misses the train. The rest of the club was rolling up to Montreal, snug on the train, while Shore got a hold of a Cadillac from a friend of his and drove all night through the mountains in blizzards and then into the next day and arrived in Montreal about an hour before the game. He got into a uniform and we beat the Canadiens 2–1. Shore scored both goals.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 24\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 25\n\nI know some people have said Shore was a vicious player but I don’t believe they saw him play too much. Let’s say he was a tough, rough player who could give it out as well as take it without complaining. Having players like Shore and Hitchman on defense meant that I didn’t play all that much since they kept the stars out there most of the time—and rightly so; after all it was a money game. Needless to say, my own personal schedule was different from the other players’ since I was going to law school. On Monday the team would practice from noon to 1:00 pm and I’d practice with them after coming from morning classes. Then I’d go back to school in the afternoon. Tuesday night was game night in Boston and I wouldn’t have any practice that day. I’d study all day long and at 6:00 in the evening I’d have my dinner; then at 7:30 I’d go down to the Garden, only a few blocks away, dress, and play the game. On Wednesday, there’d be a 12:00-to-1:00 pm practice or maybe 1:00-to2:00 pm and the same on Thursday. Occasionally we’d play in New York on Thursdays and the team would leave in the morning while I was at school and I’d take the noon or 1:00 pm train. I’d study all the way down to New York, get off and go to Madison Square Garden, play the game, and come back with the team on the midnight train and get into Boston in the early morning, then go to classes. We always had games on weekends so I’d usually catch the 9:00 train on Fridays for Montreal, Ottawa, or Toronto, depending on where we happened to be playing that Saturday night. Wherever we were, I’d stay in the hotel all day with the books then go to the game at night and take the 9:00 again back to Boston on Sunday morning. Every so often there was a conflict between my hockey schedule and law school. Once we had a game in Detroit when I was supposed to be taking my midyear exams. The solution was supplied by the law school, which let me take my exams at the University of Detroit. They sent the exam out ahead, and when the team departed for the next game in Chicago, I was left behind in Detroit. I took the exam on a Friday and Detroit University sent the papers back to Boston while I got the train to Chicago. They were very cooperative that way. From time to time people would ask me whether it was difficult concentrating on the books. Actually, playing was an incentive, and I was doing quite\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 25\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n26 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nwell in the NHL. We knocked off the Canadiens in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, then took the Rangers to win the Cup. I wound up getting that full share of the playoff cut I had demanded of Lester Patrick. But then I had an unfortunate accident that affected my hockey career. During the summer after my rookie season in the NHL I was playing baseball on Cape Cod. One day a bunch of us were in a car, driving to a game, when the car was forced off the road. I came out of the accident with a broken bone in my knee and three fractured vertebrae in my spine. That kept me out of hockey for a whole year and I could never again skate as fast as I did before the accident. To compensate for the loss of speed I began concentrating more on my defensive play than on rushing with the puck. During my year out of action a few good things happened to me. I was still going to law school and doing well there and at the same time was coaching football at Harvard. Meanwhile, I had a good chance to study the Bruins as a team and to think about hockey in general. Art Ross was running the Boston club at the time and he was a really tough one, although I had no complaints with him. He was a strict taskmaster but a good hockey man. In those days the club was known as “The Bruising Bruins” and I think the reputation they had as a rough, tough hockey team stemmed from Ross. They hit and hit hard; that’s just the way he wanted it. I realized that I had also learned some of that in New York. In fact, I think Lester Patrick always figured I could stay back to play a little more defense and do a little less rushing. Maybe I did rush too much and perhaps that’s why Lester wanted to send me to Springfield. Looking back I’d say he was right, but when a guy comes out of college as I did—a star—he thinks he knows a great deal even though he really doesn’t know that much. You don’t know real hockey until you get into the pro ranks. I played against a lot of good men but I think the finest line of all was the one the Rangers had with Frank Boucher centering Bill and Bun Cook. I haven’t seen their equal yet. They played together so much and knew each other’s moves so perfectly that watching them move the puck around was like observing how a clock works. Today the players skate much faster and push the puck a lot but there isn’t the clever stick work we had in my time. Now it’s a game of shove and push,\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 26\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 27\n\nLane went on to play defense for the Rangers and the Boston Bruins before becoming a New York State Supreme Court Justice. (Dartmouth Athletic Communications)\n\nhoping to score with blind shots. I think possibly half the goals scored today are because the goalie is screened and doesn’t see the puck. Nels Stewart was another great. He was slow but deadly with the stick and tremendous around the net. Aurel Joliat of the Canadiens was another terrific stickhandler. He must have weighed about 118 pounds soaking wet but he was a wizard at handling the puck. He had a funny habit of always wearing a black baseball cap when he played and word around the league was that if you knocked Joliat’s black cap off his head he’d get so mad it’d hurt his play. Well, naturally the Bruins would try to knock that cap off and it certainly did upset\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 27\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n28 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nhim. Joliat played on a line with Howie Morenz and Johnny Gagnon and they were quite a bunch. Howie Morenz was the fastest thing I ever saw on ice. He’d be in full speed after taking only two strides. Offhand, I’d say he was one of the greatest hockey players of all time. Being on the shelf that one year I really had a good chance to see them all. I’m sure Ross knew I’d eventually quit hockey to go into law. But that didn’t matter to him and he did get some work out of me the year I was out with the injury. Those were the days when the Bruins had a farm club called the Boston Cubs. They were a good minor league team in need of a manager so Ross put me in charge; it turned out to be a very rewarding experience. When I took over they were in last place and by the season’s end we were on top. The Cubs consisted of a bunch of young fellows going up to the NHL and a group of veterans who had come down. There was a fellow on the team named Joe Giroux who was a little firecracker and nobody could handle him, not even Ross. Here I was, the collegian with a broken back, running this club, trying to control Giroux, and attempting to bring them up from last place. For some reason I was determined to work with Giroux and help him, even though everybody else had dropped him because he was so wild. I knew he was a great hockey player; all he needed was a little balance. Well, I hadn’t been with the Cubs too long when Joe came to me with a problem. He said, “You know those penalties I get for sometimes losing my head? Well, I don’t mind them so much but the $25 fine is cutting into my income. How can I stay on the ice without getting fined?” I began thinking to myself, How am I going to keep him in the game? I started playing for time and finally inquired, “Joe why are you asking me that question?” He replied, “Myles, you’re going to law school. You know all the answers!” I said I wished I did but knew I had to give him some advice, so I said, “Well, Joe, I’ll tell you what you have to do. The next time anybody whacks you out on that ice, count to 10 before you do anything else.” Joe looked at me and said, “Why 10?” “Because,” I told him, “one of two things will happen. Number one: if the man you hit hasn’t broken a leg, he’ll skate out of reach, so should you swing\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 28\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 29\n\nthat stick at him you’ll miss him. Number two: at the end of the count you’ll be all over your mad, so you’ll stay on the ice. Right?” “Well, I’ll try it,” he said, and for the next month he was the star of the league. Then it happened. We went to play a game against New Haven at their rink and they had a Polish fellow on their team by the name of Dutkowski. As the game moved along I could see Joe’s temper was rising because Dutkowski was bothering him. With only eight or 10 minutes left, we were leading by one goal, however, and I was hopeful everything would be all right. Dutkowski, a former Chicago Black Hawk, skated near Joe and suddenly Joe hit him over the head with his stick with such a clout that it looked as if a geyser of blood was coming out of Dutkowski’s head. They carried him off the ice and there was almost a riot. A special platoon of police was called in and Joe was put off with a match penalty. Then New Haven scored two goals and beat us. Later that night we were on the train back to Boston and I was sitting and fuming about the incident when in comes Joe, acting like a big St. Bernard. He just sat there watching me and finally asked, “Myles, what’s the trouble?” “Are you kidding?” I said. “Look, Joe, I’ve been treating you like a brother. I figured to send you back to the major leagues. I’ve built you up all year long; that’s all right, it’s part of my job. But you came to me, wanting to know all about my law experience. You asked me how to stay on the ice—and what do you do, Joe? You disgraced me out there.” “Disgrace you! How?” he said. “You went out there,” I said, “and hit some guy over the head, fractured his skull, and we lost the game. I feel like you’ve let me down.” He said, “Myles, I didn’t let you down.” “Joe,” I asked, “what did I tell you to do?” “You told me to count to 10, didn’t you?” he said. I said, “Yes.” “And you said I could swing my stick,” he told me; I agreed but added, “You didn’t count to 10.” “Yes, I did,” he insisted. I said, “Joe, look, when you got into that bumping with Dutkowski, I started to count and got to five and then you let that stick go.”\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 29\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n30 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nHe replied, “Myles, I forgot to tell you one thing. You know I was born in Poland and came over to Canada when I was seven or eight years old. Whenever I get mad I forget to count in English, so I do it in Polish and count twice as fast. When I was bumping Dutkowski I counted to 10 in Polish, let the stick go, and he was in the way!” What could I say to that? We had a good team and after my year of recuperation I was ready to return to the NHL. One night I’ll never forget was the Eddie Shore–Ace Bailey incident. We were playing Toronto at Boston Garden and the local papers had more or less played up the game as a grudge match. As far as Ace was concerned, though, he was one of the nicest men ever to play hockey. On this night Shore had rushed down the length of the ice and Red Horner of Toronto, no shrinking violet himself, pushed Shore into the boards and really hit him hard. Shore struck his head and down he went. Horner got the puck and went up the ice while Bailey dropped back on the Toronto defense. To this day I really believe Shore was so dizzy getting up that he thought the man in front of him was Horner, not Bailey. As he went by Ace, Shore just dragged his stick. He didn’t bump Ace; he just took the skates out from under him. Not expecting it, Ace fell backward and struck his head on the ice and suddenly he started to shudder. Meanwhile, Shore skated back and stood there on defense, dazed. Horner skated up to him, took his gloves off, wound up like a pitcher would before throwing a fastball, and hit Shore on the chin. Shore fell backward, hitting his head on the ice. Bailey was taken into the Toronto dressing room normally used by the Cubs. The Cubs trainer, Joe Gilmore, had enough presence of mind to get chopped ice to encase Bailey’s head. He looked like a mummy but I think the ice saved his life; he was bleeding inside and that ice kept the bleeding down. He had a double fracture of the skull, one on each side. In the Bruins dressing room they took 18 stitches in Shore’s head and he was out, although few people knew that. Bailey was rushed to the hospital where Dr. Munro, a famous brain surgeon, operated on him. They put two\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 30\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 31\n\nsilver plates in his head. Of course, we didn’t know what would happen to him but we still had the schedule to fulfill and went to New York for a game two nights later. Shore was suspended for the rest of the year, and as far as the Bruins were concerned, they might as well have quit—they were finished. They couldn’t play anymore, but they had to. I remember that night in New York; we were getting regular reports on Bailey’s condition, which was quite serious. They didn’t think he was going to live and he remained on the danger list for quite a while. Ace eventually recovered but never played hockey again. Shore came back a season later and was still a great player. As for me, I finally finished my law studies and quit hockey. I wanted to come to New York so I said, “Good-bye, NHL, you’ve helped me a lot. I’m never going to be a star; I’ve got a broken back. Thanks again for everything.” I got a job with President Roosevelt’s old law firm, Roosevelt and O’Connor, and went to the U.S. Attorney’s office as an assistant. During World War II, I spent four years in the Navy, then back to civilian life with a job as chief assistant at the U.S. Attorney’s office. I became U.S. Attorney and after that was chairman of the New York State Crime Commission for 10 years and a partner in the firm of Schwartz and Froelich. Then I was elected to the New York State Supreme Court. I still enjoy hockey but think the game could be improved a bit. The one thing I don’t see enough of is the real bodychecking or the stickhandling we used to have. I feel it’s important to keep the speed in the game and am a firm believer in the importance of the forward pass. There could be some changes made in the defensive zone—allowing only lateral passing there offensively. That might bring back the old-time bodychecking and more stickhandling. I’d allow forward passing from the net right up to the red line, but only lateral passing to the second blue line and in the defensive zone. Today, if a defensive man tries to hit an opponent at his blue line it takes one man out of the play because the offensive player passes up to someone ahead of him. Because they allow that forward passing in the defensive zone there’s more emphasis on stickchecking than bodychecking. If a man tries to throw a bodycheck he winds up out of the play.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 31\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n32 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nCrowds want three things today: scoring, which there is; good stickhandling, which there isn’t; and speed, which there certainly is. But professional hockey has changed since I played; it’s now a money game, not a sport, a sales job that consists of giving the public what it wants. Today, hockey is getting the crowds but if attendance ever drops off the owners will have to put in more hitting and stickwork—and that’s when I’ll enjoy the game again.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 32\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n|\n\nchapter three\n\n|\n\nTom Lockhart Rangers Business Manager and the Busiest Executive in Hockey BORN: New York, New York, March 21, 1892 DIED: May 18, 1979 POSITION: Business Manager, New York Rangers, 1947–53 AWARDS/HONORS: Hockey Hall of Fame, 1965\n\nAmong all Rangers executives over the years, none had a more complex and fascinating hockey life than Tom Lockhart. At one point, the native New Yorker not only was business manager of the Blueshirts but also was the business manager of the New Haven Ramblers of the American League, manager of the New York Rovers of the Eastern Amateur League, president of the Eastern Amateur League, and president of the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States. Lockhart entered the hockey picture in 1932 when he was called in to reorganize amateur hockey in Madison Square Garden. After that he became the key man in organized amateur hockey in the United States, responsible for more boys in the States taking up the game than anyone else. Ironically Tom never played hockey, although he gained fame as a track man and a bike rider. When his competitive days were at an end, he stepped into the administrative end of athletics, as a member of the managing board of the Amateur 33\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 33\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n34 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nAthletic Union’s Metropolitan Association. It was while he was in charge of that organization’s amateur boxing that Tom was approached to enter the hockey field. By 1947 when Lockhart took over the role of Rangers business manager he and Frank Boucher had succeeded Lester Patrick in command of the Rangers. Tom was the first executive of a National Hockey League team—other than president or vice president—who was born in the United States. Add to this distinction the fact that Thomas F. Lockhart was without a doubt the busiest hockey executive of all time, regardless of place of birth. I met Lockhart for the first time when I was in the Rangers Fan Club. I suggested to him that I could help promote hockey by writing a newsletter about the Eastern League. Tommy obliged me and in a sense became one of my early mentors. Nearly two decades later I sat with him at his Upper East Side Manhattan apartment along with his daughter, Madeline. It was December 1971 and Tommy was in A-1 form, recalling stories from his colorful past. Our oral history begins with Lockhart detailing how a nonhockey man such as himself wound up being the busiest executive in the ice game. Before I was asked to take a job in hockey I was actually running the boxing shows in the old Madison Square Garden on Eighth Avenue and 50th Street. That was right around the corner from where I was born so you can’t consider me a hockey man like those Canadians. I’m New York all the way. My father was born on 27th Street in Manhattan, so that makes me an original Indian. In fact, I’m waiting to get it back from them for $36. I remember meeting Teddy Roosevelt as a kid. My dad took me down to the police headquarters and I shook the great man’s hand. He told me about the time he rode up one hill and down the other in the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt was police commissioner when I met him. Hockey wasn’t even on my mind in those days. I got into sports as a bicycle rider in competition, then did some track and field running for the St. John’s Club on 56th Street. Out of that I somehow became their representative to the Amateur Athletic Union. Then I got into the boxing end of it and eventually wound up running the matches at the Garden. Then the damnedest thing happened: I became involved with hockey because the bosses at the Garden wanted me to throw it out. In those\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 34\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 35\n\ndays—the early 1930s—they had Sunday afternoon amateur hockey, as well as the Rangers’ and Americans’ pro games, and the afternoon games weren’t doing any business. The Garden management had just brought in General John Reed Kilpatrick to get rid of things in the building that weren’t paying off and he called me in with some other AAU officers to eliminate the Sunday afternoon hockey. That didn’t hit me right so I told the General he was making a big mistake; I figured amateur hockey could make a go of it if it was run right. “Look,” the General said, “I’ll go along and give Sunday hockey another try, under one condition: it has to be run by one man, not the way it is now with a big committee.” One of the guys at the meeting was Fred Rubien, chairman of the National AAU. He went in to talk privately with the General after the meeting was over and nothing had been decided. Meantime, I went back to the Garden, and about 5:00 pm Rubin came back and walked over to me to say, “The General told me he knows somebody who should take the hockey job; he’s talking about you.” I said, “What’d I do now? What the hell do I know about hockey?” We stood there talking for about 20 minutes when who walks out of the elevator but the General himself. He says, “Tommy, come up and see me at 10:00 tomorrow morning.” I did and he told me he wanted me to take the hockey job, alone. And that was that. Me, Tommy Lockhart, who had never even owned a pair of roller skates let alone ice skates, had to sell amateur ice hockey at the Garden. At that time we had three amateur teams playing: St. Nick’s, the Crescent Club, and the New York Athletic Club. My idea to promote hockey was the same I had used for boxing: promotions, cut-rate tickets, and contacts. I had several contacts in the AAU that served as a starter but we needed a break and got it in a strange way that connected Mayor Jimmy Walker and Dan Parker, sports editor for the old Mirror. A sportsman fellow named Blumenthal decided the winning team should get a trophy in honor of Jimmy Walker so he went to Cartier’s and bought one for $500; it became the Walker Cup. Somehow, after the Cup was first presented, it wound up in a hock shop on Eighth Avenue and I was tipped off about it and went up to the General with the story. Dan Parker wrote it up in\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 35\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n36 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nTom Lockhart (seated, middle) was a key member of the Rangers front office in the 1950s and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1965. (U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame Museum)\n\nthe Mirror: Jimmy Walker was in exile in Mexico and his Cup was exiled in a hock shop on Eighth Avenue. “What do you want to do about it?” I asked the General. “Bail it out!” he said. So I went down and got the hockey cup for $80. Parker did us a big favor by giving us a whole column about the Walker Cup and also about Sunday afternoon hockey. He had been coming every Sunday to the games with his grandchild and he loved it. That started the people coming with their kids but we still needed more than that. We got\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 36\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 37\n\nanother break that summer when some other promoters decided to organize a hockey league up and down the East Coast. I got wind they were having the meeting on the Fourth of July at the Penn Athletic Club in Philadelphia and decided to invite a friend who was also connected with hockey. I was supposed to meet him at Penn Station; he showed up with a girl and by the time we reached Philadelphia they were both so drunk I had to get porters to take them off the train. When I finally arrived at the Athletic Club, the guy at the desk told me the hockey meeting was all over. “They must’ve gone home,” he said. “But take a look, just in case.” I walked into the room and, sure enough, some people were sitting around the table and one of them asked what I was doing there. I replied, “I came down here to join the league.” What else could I say? They then said, “Look, we’re making the schedule. We’re all set to go.” At that point John Carlin, a real Yankee Doodle Boy, jumped up and pointed at me, “Did you say you wanted to put a team in this league?” I replied, “Yes sir.” He asked how many and I said, “three teams.” Then he wanted to know where, and when I answered Madison Square Garden, he said, “You’re in!” The others protested, “But he can’t be.” Carlin said, “Tear up that schedule. What the hell’s the matter with you guys!” You see, they needed the Garden and I had it—so they needed me. After much discussion they concluded, “Well, if he’s coming in, he’s going to have to make up the schedule.” We finally decided to keep the first two weeks the way they had it and then I’d take it from there. The next item was to pick the name of the new league. Until that time somebody’d been using a rubber stamp for the papers with the same “Eastern Amateur Lacrosse League” on it and I had the thing in my pocket. I took it out, looked at it, and said, “Somebody take the Lacrosse out and put in Hockey.” And that’s exactly how the Eastern Amateur Hockey League got its name. I don’t know who wound up with the rubber stamp. That first season we had seven teams: Baltimore, Atlantic City, Hershey, the Bronx, St. Nick’s, New York A.C., and the Crescents. When I got back to the Garden the next day I went over to see Jack Filman, who was doing\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 37\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n38 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nthe broadcasting from the Garden’s own radio station. He busted the story and soon everybody was talking about Eastern Amateur Hockey League. But my problems were just beginning. They had decided to go with a 48-gameschedule—24 home games, 24 away—which put me in a hole since I had only 16 Sunday afternoon dates at the Garden. One of the first things I did was to make deals with each of the clubs to play my home games in their rinks for $250 and the cost of getting down there and back. It worked out well. Those fellows would get gates they’d never had before and it all helped to encourage interest in hockey and the league. My problems still weren’t over. I couldn’t accommodate all of the extra games so I had to cheat a little. I’d make up phony games; have the Crescents beating the New York A.C. 1–0 and put down somebody’s name for scoring the goal and add an assist or two. Then the next week I’d add two more and a couple of ties. Turned out 21 games were never played but nobody noticed it—at least no one in the league. One time a fellow from the Times got interested in the league and started asking questions about these games. I said, “Well, I’ll tell you. You know the Rangers play on Tuesday nights. The Americans play on Thursday night, and the next week it’s the reverse. I’d have the teams in there playing in the afternoons. We call them ‘dark house’ games. The seats were standing up and cheering.” But it actually happened—21 games never occurred and the league finished its full schedule of games played in that first year. By the time the season was over we were selling out the Garden. Our trick was a little different from today’s procedures. As you left the building after seeing a game you could buy your ticket for next week—before they went on general sale. That meant we almost sold out a week in advance. By the middle of the summer we began getting letters about tickets for the new schedule. We struck it good because we were catering to the little fellow, the working man. The first year we sold tickets at 25 cents for any seat in the house. Then it went up to 50 and 75 cents but that wasn’t bad because the little fellow knew that every Sunday if he had 75 cents or half a dollar he’d have the same seat as when he bought his first ticket. A man could bring three kids for less than $3. The father was happy and so were the kids. They saw a game or they could run all over the place; we didn’t chase kids like they do today.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 38\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 39\n\nAnother thing people liked was our program. It had no ads, just all kinds of columns—a gossip column, a league column—in short, plenty of reading material. We used to sell more programs in one day than the Rangers would in two games. And nobody left their program in the building; there was so much in it to take home and read. That was all part of my principle: you give them something they have to take home and when a friend comes into the house, sees it, and asks what that’s all about, the fan tells him and we have another customer. All the fuss over the Sunday afternoon amateur hockey ultimately seeped down to the Rangers office and pretty soon I got a call from manager Lester Patrick. He thought we had a good thing going and felt he could help. I said, “Great, what can you do?” “Well,” he offered, “next season I could bring you some good hockey players in from Canada.” One word led to another and we decided to ice only one team instead of the three and spent half a day trying to name it. We had the Rangers and the Ramblers so we “roved” between and called it the Rovers. Before our season began Lester went up to Winnipeg for the start of his training camp and picked out some good young players for us. We eventually wound up with Mac and Neil Colville, Alex Shibicky, Murray Patrick, Joe Cooper, and Bert Gardiner—two defensemen, three forwards, and a goaltender. We started with about 10 men and never had more than 11 and we played and won the league championship with 11. The trouble with hockey now is that they have too many men. They sit on the bench too long and don’t get ice. That way they don’t develop the way they used to when we had the Eastern League. And we also had a lot more interesting things for the customers. A lot more. I used to have figure skaters come in and skate between periods. Did you know I was the one to bring Shipstad and Johnson [a touring ice show] into the Garden for the first time? They had come off the outdoor rinks in Minnesota, then played the Colony Club in Chicago. We saw their act and booked them into the Garden even though they had never skated on arena ice before. Well, that was something. There was a big difference between our Garden ice and the nightclub stuff. Maybe that’s what made them. I’ll never forget their first appearance. It was between periods of our hockey game and Shipstad and Johnson were in the dressing room, very nervous.\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 39\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\n40 | WE ARE THE RANGERS\n\nThen they got the call to go out and they ran for the entrance, both at once. The second they hit the ice both of them fell right on their behinds—the house went bananas. They got up, did their act, and came off moaning, “Well, I guess we’re finished as an act.” A minute later one of the Garden big shots walks into their dressing room to say, “That was a helluva act!” “What?” they say. And he says, “The next time you go out there, do it again.” The boys ask, “Do what?” And he says, “Fall!” That fall put the Shipstad and Johnson show on the road and led to their Ice Follies. Made a fortune for them both. That wasn’t all; we also gave Sonja Henie her debut. She had just won the Olympics and was coming to New York for a visit, so the General contacted me to say she was turning pro and that we should get her to skate at the Garden. We had a Rovers game scheduled in the afternoon and an All-Star event in the evening so we figured we’d put Sonja on in between. Some Swedish organization was in charge of selling tickets and they sold the place out, but everyone had to come to the Rovers game first since they didn’t know exactly when she’d go on. What a sight. A terrific game was going on but for 30 odd minutes you could’ve heard a pin drop. Nobody made a sound whether the guys scored or not. Nothing. At the end of the period the teams went back to their dressing rooms completely disgusted. They had played fantastically but nobody reacted. Then Sonja came out and the roof fell in. Everyone in the stands was Swedish, you see. It was some show and we decided to have Sonja skate everywhere we had an Eastern League game. Hershey, Baltimore, Atlantic City— and the Rovers were the supporting cast. Still, she was a funny duck and never my cup of tea. No doubt about it, Sonja Henie was a tough act to follow but we managed to top her with a live bear and, believe it or not, we even flew airplanes in the Garden. Whenever somebody came in with a suggestion I’d try it. If you said you wanted to come to the hockey game and walk the length of the ice on your head, Tom Lockhart would bill you. The airplanes were an example. When I tell you we flew airplanes in the Garden I’m not kidding. It started with this big toymaker in the city. He walked into the Garden one afternoon\n\nWRtR_ptr.indd 40\n\n8/1/13 2:10 PM\n\nPart I: The Early Days | 41\n\nwith an idea: airplane races. He was putting out toy airplanes—the ones we had as kids that you’d run with and they’d go up in the air, their wheels turning—and he wanted us to race them on the ice. So we took a couple of the players in the Metropolitan League, lined them up at one end of the rink before the Rovers game, and had them skate three or four laps around the Garden and then pick a winner. That’s how we flew airplanes in the building. Another guy wanted to have bicycle races on the ice. Since I was an experienced bike-racer I knew it wouldn’t be easy to make those turns and told the guy, “I’ll prove you can’t.” I got on the bike and pedaled up a head of steam but when I got near the endboards I damn near killed myself. I told him if the frame could be altered it might work, but I’m glad we dropped the idea because we might have killed somebody. Working with live bears was a lot easier, believe me. The bear was Jack Filman’s idea. He was doing publicity for the Garden at the rink and told me he’d seen this great act at a roller skating rink. I asked what the act was like and he replied, “There’s a bear that skates.” I said, “How can he skate? And if he does, he’s skating on a roller floor.” Filman said, “Well, we can put him on ice skates, couldn’t we?” One discussion led to another and we decided that maybe we could do something with it. So we went up to take a look at the bear. The bear’s owner was a foreigner and it must have taken eight hours for us to explain to him what we were trying to do and for him to say what his bear could do. He’d tell me the bear roller skates and I’d tell him I’m not interested in roller skates, I want him to ice skate. If we’d say skates he would say he’s got skates. Finally, he got the message. We then asked how much he wanted, but before he could answer I said, “I’ll give you $20,” and he agreed. With that settled the next trick was to get the bear into the Garden before our Sunday afternoon"
