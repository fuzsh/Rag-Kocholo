        "text": "Firstly, I would like to thank Jason Karnosky for his work keeping the Roundtable rolling as I ventured out to California on vacation the past two weeks. I had a blast out there. And I also managed to keep an eye out during the NHL Draft and Free Agent Frenzy days whilst out there thanks to the likes of Jason and our friends of the Nashville media on Twitter. Cheers for all of you guys keeping me in tune even whilst in R&R mode!\n\n~Nashville’s 2014 NHL Draft Selections~\n\nDespite some speculation coming into the NHL Draft over whether or not Nashville would move from the eleventh overall selection – things appeared to go right to plan the way the Predators’ draft unfolded. In fact, SB Nation gave their Draft grade an A+ for the selections and acquisition of James Neal. While the Neal trade is a discussion all its own – let’s keep the Draft focus where it belongs with the newly selected prospects of the Nashville Predators.\n\nKevin Fiala (LW/RW), 1st Round (11th Overall)\n\nVladislav Kamenev (C/LW), 2nd Round (42nd Overall)\n\nJack Dougherty (D), 2nd Round (51st Overall)\n\nJustin Kirkland (LW/RW), 3rd Round (62nd Overall)\n\nViktor Arvidsson (LW/RW), 4th Round (112th Overall)\n\nJoonas Lyytinen (D), 5th Round (132nd Overall)\n\nAaron Irving (D), 6th Round (162nd Overall)\n\nI know exactly what you are thinking. How exciting is it to get a Finnish player named Joonas back into the system? Right? Only me? I digress. Anywho, the thing to really look at with this 2014 Draft Class for the Predators is that four of the first five selections were forwards. I think it provides some insight into the future of a Peter Laviolette led team when you consider what he is stepping into.\n\nLast year’s NHL Draft really didn’t provide much in the way of an impact forward. The 2012 Draft prior to that – we’ll see in-person plenty of what that class has to offer when Pontus Aberg and Brendan Leipsic hit Milwaukee later this year. Max Gortz, of the same draft class, is expected to play with Frolunda of the SHL for the 2014-15 season. Yet, of the past two-years in the Draft, only Colton Sissons has made an NHL impact of some sort for the Predators and I feel that goes into the decision making behind drafting forwards early and often in the recent NHL Draft for the Predators.\n\nWhat will be worth looking into for the new Draft Class is its age. Only two of the seven newly drafted players were born prior to 1996. The oldest of the class is the Swedish winger Arvidsson who is 21-years old. The next oldest player: Finnish defenseman Lyytinen at 19-years old. The rest are 18-years old or younger. When you think about this Draft Class and any potential ETA to the NHL – you may want to wait a tick.\n\nThe top two of the class, Fiala and Kamenev, are both European products who look set for another tenure of hockey overseas. Fiala split last season between the professional and Junior-20 teams of the SHL’s HV71. Kamenev played last season with the KHL team that drafted him in 2013, Metallurg Magnitogorsk. In addition to getting drafted in the KHL and NHL – it is worth noting that Kamenev was also selected second-overall by the Quebec Remparts of the QMJHL in the 2013 CHL Import Draft.\n\nI strongly expect both to put in more time outside of the system prior to making their professional North American debuts. We’ve seen a perfect example of the Predators developing players this way over the years with Aberg, Gortz, as well as Miikka Salomaki and Joonas Rask. It’s all a matter of the rate of development as to when we see the likes of Fiala or Kamenev make the leap in my eyes. It could be one-season. It could be two-seasons. The fact that the Predators are starting to stock up on young forward talent though is what makes me the most excited about the entire draft process this season.\n\n~The Real Deal James Neal~\n\nThose that know me understand that I am a Pittsburgh Penguins fan. So it came to my shock to see my two favorite teams pull off a massive trade on draft day. James Neal has been a revelation playing alongside Evgeni Malkin since the Penguins first acquired him from the Dallas Stars (in a trade that also saw them gain Matt Niskanen for Alex Goligoski… geez did Dallas get hosed). Neal has produced 20-or-more goals in every single season of his NHL playing career. In 2011-12 he scored 81 points (40 goals, 41 assists) in 80 games. Since, he has cooled off somewhat but cooling off while scoring 20+ goals a season still sounds mouthwatering when you think about the Predators offense over the last few years.\n\nThe top goal scorers for the Predators: 2013-14, Craig Smith – 24 goals… 2012-13, David Legwand – 12 goals… 2011-12, Patric Hornqvist – 27 goals… 2010-11, Sergei Kostitsyn – 23 goals… 2009-10, Patric Hornqvist – 30 goals… 2008-09, Jason Arnott – 33 goals… 2007-08, J.P. Dumont – 29 goals…\n\nIt has been tough sledding in the offensive department. It really always has been. Enter the Laviolette era and the hopes to combine the great defensive core of the Predators with some offense. Neal, whether you wag the finger at Malkin or not, provides the Predators with goal scoring numbers and ability that they have lacked for years.\n\nThe real question you may end up asking is: was it worth losing the skill of Hornqvist and all-around ability of Nick Spaling to gain Neal’s services? In my book, as a fan of both teams involved in this specific trade, absolutely. Neal will give Nashville its proven goal scorer. Hornqvist and Spaling finally give Pittsburgh depth on the wing.\n\n~Free Agency~\n\nThe talks of Predators GM David Poile going into free agency were that of signing a top-line center. All of those on came and went. What he ended up getting is Mr. Waffles himself, Olli Jokinen. Perhaps not what you would have hoped for with someone like Paul Stastny on the market but I feel it adds a proven, durable, and experienced player into the Predators system that should really fit well. Also, if someone can inform him of the nearest McDonald’s it may come in handy. Read more on the Jokinen signing via the Roundtable’s post on July 2.\n\nIt would seem the next approach for Poile and the Preds would be to look elsewhere for a center via trade. The name that has been floating around quite often has been Vincent Lecavalier. His contract is ridiculous and, at 34-years of age and counting, I question whether his best days are well behind him. Other options could include free agent Derek Roy or possibly trading for Joe Thornton.\n\nLooking at next year’s free agent class also can provide small hints of who is a possible trade asset that may be available if a deal is right: David Krejci, Carl Soderberg, and Vladimir Sobotka. It isn’t the greatest market right now. Combine that with the crazy spending that went down during day-one of free agency and it leaves lots of questions for Poile as to getting the pieces needed for a playoff contending team with so many strong Western Conference teams getting stronger this off-season. Sit and wait mode might not be the worst place to be from Nashville’s perspective.\n\n~Admiral Free Agent Updater~\n\nIt has been awhile since we’ve taken a look into who went where out of Milwaukee Admirals camp. Here is the update on the latest:\n\nTaylor Beck – RFA\n\nAnthony Bitetto – RFA\n\nPaul Crowder – UFA\n\nScott Darling – Rockford IceHogs – (1-Year; NHL Two-Way Contract)\n\nScott Ford – UFA\n\nJoonas Jarvinen – Sochinskiye Leopardy – (Full Details Unknown; KHL)\n\nMike Liambas – Milwaukee Admirals – (1-Year; AHL Contract)\n\nSimon Moser – RFA\n\nJoe Pendenza – Milwaukee Admirals – (1-Year; AHL Contract)\n\nBraden Pimm – UFA\n\nJoe Piskula – Nashville Predators – (1-Year; NHL Two-Way Contract)\n\nJoonas Rask – HIFK – (1-Year Contract; Finland)\n\nBryan Rodney – UFA\n\nCharles-Olivier Roussel – UFA\n\nVinny Saponari – UFA\n\nMathieu Tousignant – Adirondack Flames (1-Year; AHL contract)\n\nScott Valentine – RFA\n\nFrancis Wathier – UFA\n\nWhat are you thoughts on the NHL Draft, James Neal trade, and free agency? Has David Poile done the right thing by not over-spending in free agency? What trades could be in the cards for the Predators and what players should be considered off-limits for the team?\n\nUPDATE: 5:15 PM\n\nAs of 5:15 PM Central Time, the Nashville Predators have not added a single player, despite high hopes for finding a quality center during today’s proceedings:\n\nEither Lavender or myself will be sure to keep Admirals Roundtable readers informed if something happens in regards to Nashville/Milwaukee in the coming hours or days. Thanks for reading and checking us out on a busy July 1, 2014 #FreeAgentFrenzy. It’s been an interesting afternoon to say the least!\n\nUPDATE: 4:40 PM\n\nFormer Milwaukee captain Mike Moore was signed by the Washington Capitals today to a one-year, one-way deal. My guess is that Moore was one of the direct competitors to Joe Piskula for a contract:\n\nThe New York Rangers will have to continue to retool as one of the most underrated forwards in the NHL, Brian Boyle, signed in Tampa Bay:\n\nUPDATE: 4:24 PM\n\nFormer Marlies defenseman T. J. Brennan, who played a big role in Toronto’s sweep of Milwaukee this past postseason, will not be back to the AHL this year. He signed a one-year, one-way deal with the New York Islanders:\n\nUPDATE: 4:04 PM\n\nOne of the two UFAs on the Nashville Predators, Patrick Eaves, is off the market. He signs in Dallas, which has done a nice job of bolstering its club today. Only Michael Del Zotto remains available.\n\nUPDATE: 3:58 PM\n\nWith Washington’s signing of Matt Niskanen, not only do the Capitals pick up their second ex-Penguin defenseman of the day, but my list of the 10-best free agents available is down to just one name: Radim Vrbata.\n\nDefenseman Willie Mitchell, fresh off winning his second Stanley Cup, now goes to a team no where close to winning one, Florida via TSN’s Aaron Ward:\n\nUPDATE: 3:39 PM\n\nIf the Nashville Predators want a top line center, the options via free agency are getting pretty thin. Sounds like Brad Richards is on his way to Chicago at a rock bottom price (aka less per year than Deryk Engelland):\n\nUPDATE: 3:20 PM\n\nA couple of minor signings to report as #FreeAgentFrenzy enters its fifth hour. Andrej Meszaros signed in Buffalo for $4.125 million. Calgary inexplicably (and likely because of Brian Burke) gave former Pittsburgh defenseman Deryk Engelland $2.9 over three years, per season. The New York Rangers gave $600,000 to defenseman Matt Hunwick on a one-way deal, while Philadelphia resigned goaltender Ray Emery for one year at $1 million.\n\nFinally, goaltender Devan Dubnyk short run as a goaltender with the Predators organization comes to abrupt end as he signs with Arizona:\n\nUPDATE: 2:30 PM\n\nBad news for Milwaukee Admirals forwards next season. Instead of protecting AHL standout goaltender Scott Darling, they will shooting on him, regularly, as he joins Rockford IceHogs/Chicago Blackhawks today:\n\nWith Darling moved on, goaltender Marek Mazanec has strenghtened his hold on the number three slot in the Predators depth chart, aka the top spot in Milwaukee, according to Joshua Cooper of the Tennessean:\n\nUPDATE: 1:54 PM\n\nAfter an eventful season that saw a first experience in the NHL playoffs and a Calder Cup ring with the Texas Stars, former Milwaukee Admirals forward Chris Mueller has found a new home with the New York Rangers, moving him much closer to his hometown of Buffalo:\n\nUPDATE: 1:39 PM\n\nPredlines.com is reporting via Hockey Buzz Eklund a possible imminent trade involving the Predators. Names mentioned are Vincent Lecavalier, Joe Thornton or Radim Vrbata. My completely uneducated guess would be Vrbata:\n\nIn completely unrelated news defenseman Anton Stralman signed for five years at $20 million plus with Tampa Bay:\n\nUPDATE: 1:25 PM\n\nAfter an extended run in Calgary, Jarome Iginla is moving on to his fourth team in less than two years. The first of the two soon-to-be Hall of Famers (including Martin Brodeur) on the free agent list signs in Colorado for three years:\n\nForward Leo Komarov comes full circle from the Leafs to the KHL and back to the Leafs for four years:\n\nPlus there is a report about another failed Nashville trade yesterday involving the Predators and Vincent Lecavalier that has surfaced:\n\nIt seems the Predators were unwilling to eat all that was left on the former Tampa star’s contract after he scored just 37 points in 69 games with a minus-16 rating last year with the Flyers.\n\nUPDATE: 1:12 PM\n\nA thin free agency class is getting a whole lot thinner by the minute as Matt Moulson comes off the board. The forward picked one of his three teams from last year to rejoin, signing in Buffalo for five years at five million dollars annually:\n\nAs far as center upgrades for Nashville the notable targets left are a retread of David Legwand, Mikhail Grabovski and perhaps Brad Richards:\n\nMartin Havlat signed for $1.5 million with New Jersey, and will actually make less per season than his buyout from San Jose will pay him:\n\nUPDATE: 1:00 PM\n\nThe first two hours are in the books and here is a quick recap of the lesser deals. Former Milwaukee Admiral Michael Latta resigned with the Capitals. The forward took to Twitter to express his excitement about resigning:\n\nThe Calgary Flames who really needed an upgrade in goal, got one in Jonas Hiller:\n\nVeteran defenseman Stephane Robidas signed in Toronto for three years at age 37, Winnipeg signed former Ducks forward Mathieu Perreault (3 years at $3M per year), Dominic Moore resigned with the Rangers and Tanner Glass leaves Pittsburgh to add toughness to the Rangers.\n\nUPDATE: 12:55 PM\n\nThe second biggest prize in the free agency pool is off the table as Thomas Vanek signs his expected deal with the Minnesota Wild. More importantly for the Austrian forward, who played for three teams last season, the deal contains a full no trade claus.\n\nUPDATE: 12:15 PM\n\nIt’s still quiet out of Nashville so far as a few more pieces come off the board. Blake Comeau and Thomas Greiss signed with the Penguins, while Florida paid a hefty price for center Dave Bolland.\n\nShawn Thornton adds to the new Panthers brigade, while former Montreal captain Brian Gionta joins Josh Gorges in Buffalo:\n\nUPDATE: 12:05 PM\n\nRyan Miller signed in Vancouver for three years. Forward Ales Hemsky agreed with the Dallas Stars. Joe Vitale signed with Arizona:\n\nUPDATE: 11:58 AM\n\nPittsburgh Penguins stalwart Brooks Orpik continues the exodus out of the Steel City, signing with archrival Washington according to the New York Post’s Larry Brooks:\n\nMeanwhile, Montreal resigns defenseman Mike Weaver, who they traded for at the deadline last season:\n\nUPDATE: 11:43 AM\n\nMore big names off the board: Dan Boyle to the New York Rangers, Mason Raymond to Calgary and Brad Stuart was likely traded to Colorado from San Jose:\n\nUPDATE: 11:38 AM\n\nAnother big ticket center off the board in the first hour. Calgary’s Mike Cammalleri signs with the New Jersey Devils for five years at $5 million per year:\n\nForward Jusssi Jokinen is headed to Florida for four-years at $4 mil per year. Former Wisconsin Badgers defenseman Tom Gilbert heads to Montreal for two years at $2.8 million per year:\n\nUPDATE: 11:35 AM\n\nThe biggest ticket on the NHL Free Agent Market, Paul Stastny is officially off the market. Stastny is heading home to St. Louis, joining a solid Stanley Cup contender in the Blues. Nashville had hopes of signing the big ticket center ice man:\n\nUPDATE: 11:34 AM After refusing a trade to archrival Toronto, defenseman Josh Gorges accepts a trade to Buffalo. I respect Gorges a lot, but last time I checked isn’t Buffalo in the same division as Montreal, just like the Leafs?\n\nUPDATE: 11:26 AM\n\nMinor deals afoot: Forward Milan Michalek resigns in Ottawa for $4 million per year. Goaltender Chad Johnson signs with the Islanders for two years at $1.3 million per year:\n\nUPDATE: 11:15 AM\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers enter the fray with signings of defenseman Mark Fayne (four years) and forward Benoit Pouliot on a whopper of a five-year contract:\n\nUPDATE: 11:08 AM\n\nThe NHL #FreeAgentFrenzy stock market’s opening bell has come and gone with players already getting gobbled up. Defenseman Christian Ehrhoff and forward Manny Malhotra each have new teams. Ehroff signed for one year in Pittsburgh according to Bob McKenzie:\n\nAnd Malhotra in Montreal on a one-year deal:\n\nUPDATE: 10:07 AM\n\nSounds like the Ottawa Senators have decided to trade Jason Spezza to the Dallas Stars, and not the Nashville Predators, who coveted the Canadian center. A couple of sources are reporting it, but CBC’s Elliotte Friedman believes it is three forwards and a draft pick:\n\nThe trade would give Dallas the awesome one-two punch of Tyler Seguin and Spezza at center. Just updated per TSN’s Bob McKenzie, Alex Chiasson, Alex Guptill, Nick Paul and a 2nd round pick in 2015 for Spezza and Ludvig Karlsson:\n\nThis clearly is not blockbuster material in the return from the Stars that the Senators are receiving. Ottawa did not get one first round pick out of this trade that they desperately wanted. Chiasson is a nice developing player, but I’m sure Bryan Murray would have prefered Patric Hornqvist/Nick Spaling and a first-round pick.\n\nUPDATE: 9:00 AM\n\nStarting at 12:00 PM Eastern Time, unrestricted free agents are free to sign wherever they choose, while teams have the opportunity to either match or receive compensation for signed restricted free agents. For more information on this, see article 10 of the NHL/NHLPA CBA. For a fun look back at the 2012 free agent class, and the pitfalls of signing free agents via Grantland’s Sean McIndoe, click here.\n\nThe 2014 free agency class this year is thin overall as NHL teams have tended to hoard their players for better or worse through longer term deals. Here is Predators General Manager David Poile thoughts on what is available.\n\nHere is my list of the 10 most useful free agents currently available (aka best bang for your buck): Paul Stastny, Matt Niskanen, Thomas Vanek, Jarome Iginla, Dan Boyle, Ryan Miller, Radim Vrbata, Matt Moulson, Mike Cammalleri, Anton Stralman. Here is TSN’s list of the top 40 UFA’s of 2014.\n\nIn case you missed it yesterday, here is a list Nashville’s free agents courtesy of CapGeek.com: UFA’s are just forward Patrick Eaves and defenseman Michael Del Zotto (not qualified); In Milwaukee Bryan Rodney, Joe Piskula and Charles Olivier-Roussel (not qualified). The RFAs for Nashville are Ryan Ellis and Mattias Ekholm; In Milwaukee: Anthony Bitetto, Taylor Beck, Scott Valentine and Simon Moser. Both Joonas Jarvinen and Joonas Rask have already signed overseas.\n\nA few moves of significance have taken place so far this offseason, namely Nashville’s trade for James Neal, who was welcomed as the newest member of the Predators yesterday.\n\nEdmonton’s Sam Gagner was flipped twice, ending up in Arizona. Yesterday, a big swap involved Colorado and Montreal, as Daniel Briere was swapped for P.A. Parenteau plus a draft pick. A couple of significant former Admirals/Predators are also available, notably Matt Halischuk and David Legwand, as is one the NHL greatest all-time players, aging goaltender Martin Brodeur.\n\nThe Tennessean’s Josh Cooper believes that Poile is in the mood to deal:\n\n(Joe Piskula headlines Milwaukee’s two-way UFAs. Photo courtesy of Scott Paulus)\n\nUPDATE: 8:30 AM Central Time\n\nGood morning and welcome to the Admirals Roundtable #FreeAgentFrenzy Live Blog on Canada Day. Throughout the day I will be checking in to provide updates on who is signing where out of this year’s free agent class. Feel free to comment about anything going on today, rumors you are hearing, and especially any big news out of Nashville/Milwaukee. I will check in from time to time with updates, especially on the significant signings and anything pertaining to Nashville/Milwaukee. Let the fun begin!\n\nThe first phase of the NHL offseason is already in the books with the NHL entry draft come and gone. The Nashville Predators were one of the league’s most active teams, selecting four players in the first 62 picks, and seven altogether in the first 162 (no pick in the 7th round). Off the draft floor Predators General Manager David Poile was very active as well, trading to key roster components, forwards Partic Hornqvist and Nick Spaling to Pittsburgh in exchange for sniper James Neal. It was the trade that came after the trade that didn’t involving Ottawa.\n\n~Predators Select Kevin Fiala in the first round; four players in the first 62 picks~\n\nHere is the Predators full draft card, via predators.NHL.com:\n\nNashville’s first selection was Kevin Fiala, a skilled smaller forward with game-breaking potential, who hails from Switzerland, is a citizen of both there and Czech Republic and just finished the season playing for HV71 Jonkoping of the Swedish Elite League.\n\nThe Predators second selection was another forward, Orsk, Russia native Vladislav Kamenev most recently of Magnitogorsk Metallurg. Curious if Poile/assistant G.M. Paul Fenton got a tip on the talented forward with good size from Metallurg coach Mike Keenan, who just won a KHL title.\n\nMore importantly for Milwaukee were the selections of Jack Dougherty and Justin Kirkland, 51st and 62nd overall. Though I can’t honestly attest to knowing if Fiala or Kamenev will make an appearance in Milwaukee prior to stepping out in Nashville, both Dougherty and Kirkland will likely be wearing an Admirals jersey in the not so distant future.\n\nIf Jack Dougherty’s name sounds familiar, it should. He’s part of the incoming freshman class at the University of Wisconsin. Once again Poile and Fenton and returning to the Badgers well with the Cottage Grove, Minnesota native that has brought them such prospects as Ryan Suter, Blake Geoffrion and Craig Smith among others. The slew of recent Wisconsin defenseman developed by coach Mike Eaves now playing around the NHL bodes well for Dougherty’s future.\n\nDougherty seemed pretty excited in Philadelphia:\n\nKirkland is currently cutting his teeth in the WHL with the Kelowna Rockets, where forward scored 17 goals and 48 points in his first full season, before adding another 10 in 14 playoff games.\n\nA former teammate and current Predator/Admiral Colton Sissons was pretty excited for the pick of Kirkland:\n\n~The James Neal Trade~\n\nDuring the NHL draft, only a few trades went down with many more expected to happen that did not take place. The biggest transaction involved Nashville as the Predators traded a pair of franchise-developed products, Patric Hornqvist and Nick Spaling to Pittsburgh in exchange for James Neal. In Neal the Predators add a former 40-goal scorer with a bit of a checkered past. Here’s an interesting tidbit from Neal via Twitter back on May 23:\n\nThe exchange sends two big-time character forwards to a Penguins team in desperate need of them. For the record, Hornqvist dressed in 49 regular season and 11 playoff contests with Milwaukee back in 2008-2009, contributing 21 goals and 22 assists. Meanwhile, Spaling dressed in 52 regular season games with Milwaukee over the course of two seasons (2009-2011), chipping in eight goals and 11 assists.\n\n~The Jason Spezza Trade that Wasn’t~\n\nIn many circles, Poile is being lauded for acquiring Neal, but the pieces were in place the same day for an even bigger fish in center Jason Spezza, according to ESPN.com/TSN reporter Pierre LeBrun:\n\nThe rumored trade involved potentially Nashville’s first-round selection in 2014, plus Hornqvist/Spaling. It was quite a risk/bounty for a player in Spezza who can sign anywhere as a free agent after the 2014-2015 season. The Ottawa forward has asked for a trade out of Canada’s capital, but much like former Badger Dany Heatley owns a no-trade claus in his contract preventing a trade to 10 teams of his choosing. The Predators and nine others were on that list.\n\nHow a player has the gall to ask for a trade, then would not accept one to organization as soundly built from top to bottom as Nashville is beyond me, especially with Spezza’s trade demand reasoning being that he wanted to get out of the spotlight of being the focal point of negative press in Ottawa. It’s not like it had to be a long-term thing. In Neal, I think Nashville got a better fit anyway, plus a better contract and didn’t have to give up their first-round pick in the process. Sometimes the best trades are the ones that don’t happen.\n\n~Nashville’s Lower Round Draft Selections~\n\nWith its final three picks, Nashille added another smaller creative Swedish forward in 21-year-old Viktor Arvidsson, currently playing for Skellefteå of the Swedish Elite League with its fourth-round selection. Two blue liners, Espoo, Finland native Joonas Lyytinen and Edmonton, Alberta native Aaron Irving rounded out the Predators 2014 draft class.\n\n~Free Agent Frenzy~\n\nTomorrow marks the first day of open-season on NHL/AHL free agents to be as 2013-2014 contracts officially expire.\n\nNashville’s list of UFAs via CapGeek.com is unbelievably short, involving just forward Patrick Eaves, and Milwaukee’s Bryan Rodney and Joe Piskula. Charles Olivier-Roussel was just added to this list as he was not qualified today. The RFAs for Nashville are three defenseman Michael Del Zotto (still not qualified), Ryan Ellis and Mattias Ekholm. Milwaukee: Anthony Bitetto, Taylor Beck, Scott Valentine and Simon Moser. Both Joonas Jarvinen and Joonas Rask have already signed overseas.\n\nI will have a live blog up here at Admirals Roundtable throughout the day marking the significant signings and extended details of any Predator/Admirals signings. Stay tuned:"
