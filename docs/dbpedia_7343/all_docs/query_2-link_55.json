        "text": "The growth of hockey in Pittsburgh in the last 40 years has been staggering thanks to an influx of some of the greatest players the world has ever seen. Because hockey is truly a global game, towns such as Laval, Quebec; Kladno, Czechoslovakia; Magnitogorsk, Russia and Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia have made themselves into the folklore of the Pittsburgh sports because of the generational talents that were exported to Pittsburgh and forever changed the way a city came to embrace a team as its own.\n\nAs a result of the culture of success that was forged in Pittsburgh, and not to mention 5 Stanley Cup victories, the next generation of stars will include players from all backgrounds and demographics within the region.\n\nWith seven girls’ teams, Pittsburgh Penguins Elite is responsible for the development of the region’s most talented girls between the ages of 10 and 19. Many of the best female players and teams are a part of the Pens Elite program as four teams qualified for the USA Hockey National Championships in April. Recently, USA Hockey announced its list of girls that were invited to the 2018 Girls’ Select Player Development Camps and twelve Pens Elite players were invited.\n\nInvited to the U15 National Camp was Hannah Humes, Mallory Mauracher, Lily Stumm, Brianna Walkom and Sophia Bellina. Humes, Stumm and Walkom play defense for the 16U Girls Pens Elite team while Mauracher is a forward and Bellina is a goaltender for the same team. The five girls will make the trip to St. Cloud, Minnesota for the U15 Girls’ National Player Development Camp from July 7th through 11th.\n\nRepresenting the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite program at the U16/17 Girls’ National Player Development Camp will be three more girls. Corin Trejchel, a defender on the 16U Pens Elite team will be joined by her teammates Ellie Marcovsky and Haley Steffey, both forwards, at the development camp in St. Cloud.\n\nThe Girls’ Under-18 Select National Development Camp will also see its fair share of Pens Elite girls as four were invited to participate in the event that also takes place at the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center in St. Cloud. Lauren Bernard and Chayla Edwards will patrol the blue line as forwards Kaitlyn O’Donohoe and Lacey Eden were also selected to represent Pittsburgh Penguins Elite. Lauren Bernard has committed to playing her college hockey at Clarkson University while Kaitlyn O’Donohoe will join her in the state of New York by playing at Colgate University and Chayla Edwards will take her talents to the Badger State as a member of the University of Wisconsin’s women’s hockey team.\n\nCongrats to all of the Pittsburgh Penguins Elite players who were invited to the USA Hockey National Development Camps!"
