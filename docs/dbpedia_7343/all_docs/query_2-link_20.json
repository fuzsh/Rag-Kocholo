        "text": "A Federal District Court judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that Evgeny Malkin and two other Russians may continue playing in the National Hockey League. Malkin began playing for the Pittsburgh Penguins this season, after leaving Metallurg Magnitogorsk, in southwestern Russia.\n\nMalkin, 20, abruptly left the Russian team while it was in Finland on Aug. 12, days after signing a contract with Metallurg for the 2006-7 season. Shortly afterward, he surfaced in the United States and signed a contract to play with Pittsburgh.\n\nMetallurg initiated the legal action in New York because that is where the headquarters of the N.H.L. are located. The team asked Judge Loretta A. Preska to confirm a finding by a Russian arbitration board that Malkin had acted improperly by switching teams without permission. In addition, Alexander Berkovich, a lawyer for the team, asked the judge to issue an injunction forbidding Malkin from playing for any professional hockey team other than Metallurg.\n\nAlso discussed during the hearing were two other Russian players, Aleksei Mikhnov of the Edmonton Oilers and Andrei Taratukhin of the Calgary Flames. Both had played in Russia for Lokomotiv Yaroslavl.\n\nAfter oral arguments yesterday, Judge Preska rejected Berkovich's request, saying that the Russian teams had failed to prove they would be irreparably damaged by the loss of the players. She said the teams appeared to be motivated mainly by a desire to be paid by the N.H.L. teams and added that Metallurg and Lokomotiv damaged their case by waiting until late October to apply for the injunction. The players announced their intention to leave their former teams in July.\n\n\"These cases were always about money,\" Preska said. \"Plaintiffs hid in the tall grass while the players terminated their Russian contracts and signed N.H.L. contracts.\"\n\nThe news is sure to please fans of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who quickly came to regard Malkin, a center and wing, as a valuable addition. He missed the first four games of the season with a dislocated shoulder, but then scored in his first six N.H.L. games, a deed that had not been accomplished since the Hall of Famer Joe Malone did so at the beginning of the 1917-18 season for the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nLawyers for the N.H.L. argued in court that under Russian labor law, players can terminate contracts with two weeks' notice. Berkovich disagreed with that interpretation.\n\nThe dispute over who had the right to Malkin's services took place against the backdrop of a broader disagreement between the N.H.L. and the Russian Hockey Federation. In the past, American teams could draft and sign overseas players in return for fees of $200,000. But after 2004, the Russian league refused to approve such transfer agreements, saying that their teams were tired of losing talented players to America and denouncing the $200,000 fee as paltry.\n\nIn widely reported comments after Malkin's flight from Metallurg, the team's top executive, Gennady Velichkin, told the publication Soviet Sport: \"This is the theft of the century. They don't care that Malkin is Russia's national treasure.\"\n\nMalkin grew up in Magnitogorsk, an industrial city of 415,000 in the southern Urals about 900 miles east of Moscow that was built as part of the first of Stalin's five-year plans. Metallurg, which pays in Russia's highest league, dominated with Malkin last season. The team went 42-5-4 and clinched the regular-season title with a month and a half left on the schedule.\n\nBerkovich said that he would consult with his clients about the possibility of further legal proceedings.\n\n\"We're very disappointed,\" he said as he left court."
