        "text": "Scouting Report\n\nInjuries have begun to take a toll on the future Hall of Fame forward as he moves through his mid-30s, and are slowing him down in a way opponents rarely have done. When healthy, he is a speedy, powerful skater who has the instincts to know when to shoot and when to pass. Has always brought his best performances when they were needed most. Can still generate a lot of offense, as long as he is healthy. Is a rare superstar who has been able to check his ego at the door for the benefit of the collective good."
