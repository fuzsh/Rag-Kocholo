        "text": "Hockey\n\nMalkin, Gonchar ?to play in Russia\n\n•?NHL stars Evgeni Malkin and Sergei Gonchar signed with Mettalurg of the Kontinental Hockey League after the NHL locked out its players. Metallurg, based in the Russian industrial city of Magnitogorsk, said Sunday that it signed the two Russian players through the 2012-13 season. The NHL formally locked out its players early Sunday after the collective bargaining agreement between the sides expired. Malkin, a 26-year-old center with the Pittsburgh Penguins, is the NHL’s reigning MVP. Gonchar, 38, is a defenseman with the Ottawa Senators.\n\nCollege football\n\nAlabama, LSU top AP poll; USC slips\n\n•?Alabama and LSU are back atop the Associated Press college football poll, holding down Nos. 1 and 2 the way they did most of last season. The Crimson Tide are No. 1 for the third consecutive week, and it was almost unanimous. Alabama received 58 of 60 first-place votes. LSU got the other two. LSU moved up to No. 2 this week after Southern California’s first loss of the season. USC dropped 11 spots to 13th after losing 21-14 at Stanford. Stanford jumped from 21st to ninth.\n\n•?Nebraska coach Bo Pelini returned to work Sunday, a day after he was taken to a hospital during the Cornhuskers’ game against Arkansas State. Pelini was taken by ambulance to a Lincoln hospital after halftime for tests. The 44-year-old was released from the hospital by Saturday evening. He said after his team’s 42-13 win that “everything checked out just fine” and that he planned to work Sunday. Pelini’s statement after the game didn’t mention his symptoms. A team doctor had checked Pelini’s pulse on the sideline during the second quarter.\n\nOTHER\n\nMorgan leads U.S. to another victory\n\n•?Alex Morgan scored a goal and set up another as the U.S. women’s national soccer team rallied from a first-half deficit to beat Australia 2-1 in the second game of a post-Olympic tour in Carson, Calif. Morgan scored the tying goal in the 55th minute and won the penalty kick that fellow Southern Californian Shannon Boxx converted eight minutes later as the London gold medalists shook off a rough first 45 minutes. The United States improved to 2-0 on the 10-game tour. The match drew 19,851 to the Home Depot Center. Australia went ahead in the 34th minute when Lisa DeVanna beat Hope Solo after outsprinting two defenders on a run from midfield.\n\n•?U.S. speedskating coach Jae Su Chun was placed on administrative leave Sunday, hours after his spokesman released a statement denying claims of verbal, physical and psychological abuse brought by current and former members of the national team, including five Olympic medalists. Nineteen short-track skaters filed a wide-ranging grievance against U.S. Speedskating and 14 signed a code of conduct complaint with the U.S. Olympic Committee on Aug. 30.\n\n•?Jonathan Tiernan-Locke became the first home winner of the Tour of Britain in 19 years after finishing safely in the main pack in Sunday’s final stage, won by compatriot Mark Cavendish. Tiernan-Locke kept out of trouble to maintain the 18-?second lead he held from Saturday over the 90-mile trek from Reigate to Guildford in southeastern England. Cavendish claimed his third stage win of the race.\n\n— From wire reports"
