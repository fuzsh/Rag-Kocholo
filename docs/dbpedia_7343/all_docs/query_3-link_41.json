        "text": "April 12, 2017 Speaking on a conference call, Iginla announced he would like to play in a 21st NHL season in 2017-18. Iginla, who turns 40 in July, is coming off one of the least productive campaigns of his brilliant career, finishing with 14 goals and 13 assists over 80 games with Colorado and Los Angeles. Though the impending free agent can certainly be a positive locker-room influence, his days of being a major offensive contributor appear to be over. April 10, 2017 Iginla had an assist in the Kings' 4-3 overtime loss to the Ducks. The 39-year-old Iginla, who earned his 1,300th career point with his assist, hasn't decided whether to keep playing next season, but he is leaning toward continuing his career. ''I've got to play for a long time and with great players and great situations,'' Iginla said. ''The guys were great, and for the last few games, they've been trying to help me get (to 1,300 points). It was nice.'' April 1, 2017 Iginla scored for the third straight game, recording the 625th goal of his career to match Joe Sakic for 15th place all-time in Friday's win over Vancouver. Iginla's power-play goal was his fourth game-winner of the season and the 101st of his career. Acquired from Colorado prior to the trade deadline, the 39-year-old has six goals in 14 games with Los Angeles after scoring just eight times in 61 contests with the Avalanche. March 30, 2017 Playing perhaps for the final time in Calgary, Iginla scored in a second straight game and added an assist to help the Kings post an important 4-1 win over the Flames. The former Calgary captain also was involved in a fight and finished a plus-3. The in-season move to Los Angeles has boosted Iginla's numbers, as he's recorded five goals, two assists and 12 penalty minutes over his last 11 games to put himself back into the fantasy conversation. March 29, 2017 Iginla scored the Kings' only goal in Tuesday's loss to the Oilers. It was Iginla's 12th goal of the season and fourth in 12 games since joining Los Angeles. Iginla's 623 career goals put him two behind Joe Sakic for 15th place all-time. March 17, 2017 Iginla netted the game-winner in Thursday's 2-0 victory over Buffalo. Iginla's 622nd career goal was his third in seven games with the Kings, who acquired the 39-year-old veteran from Colorado two weeks ago for the playoff push. March 10, 2017 Iginla scored with 1:26 left in overtime, and the Kings rallied for a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Thursday night. In his third game with his new club, Iginla got his first two goals for the Kings, both on Los Angeles' frequently struggling power play. He has 10 goals on the season. March 1, 2017 The Kings have acquired Iginla from the Avalanche for a conditional 2018 fourth-round pick. The 39-year-old Iginla joins his fifth NHL team for one more run at the Stanley Cup that has eluded him. He had to waive his no-trade clause to join the Kings. His production has declined this season. He has eight goals and 10 assists in 61 games for the last-in-the-NHL Avalanche. Feb. 24, 2017 Iginla had a goal and an assist in Thursday's 4-2 loss at Nashville. It was the 619th goal of Iginla's career, six shy of Joe Sakic for 15th all-time. Iginla is two goals shy of reaching double digits for the 20th time in as many seasons. Feb. 17, 2017 Iginla needs three goals to reach double digits for the 20th straight season. He's played in each of Colorado's 56 games and is gunning for his 12th season of playing all games - the best mark in NHL history. Iginla moved within 10 games played of 13th best all-time, a spot currently held by Johnny Bucyk at 1,540. Feb. 4, 2017 Iginla registered a long-awaited first multi-point game of the season Saturday, producing a goal and an assist in the Avalanche's win over Winnipeg. The declining forward is boosting his trade value by netting two of his seven goals in the last five games. Iginla may not have much more to offer a potential suitor other than a veteran presence at this stage of his career, though Saturday's performance showed the 39-year-old may still have something left. Dec. 10, 2016 Iginla played his 1,500th NHL game Saturday. While the 39-year-old didn't figure into the scoring, he took two minor penalties for throwing punches at Alexei Emelin after the Canadiens defenseman clipped Joe Colborne with a low check with less than four minutes to play. Nov. 26, 2016 Iginla ended an 11-game goal drought with his third of the season Saturday in a shootout loss to Vancouver. The goal was the 614th of Iginla's career. He ranks 16th on the all-time goals list, 11 behind Joe Sakic. Nov. 2, 2016 Iginla scored Colorado's only goal in Tuesday's loss to Nashville. The 39-year-old scored his 613th NHL goal, putting him within 12 of Joe Sakic for 15th place on the all-time list. Oct. 17, 2016 Iginla scored for the Avalanche in Monday's OT win at Pittsburgh. Iginla's goal was his 191st on the power play, moving him into sole possession of 21st on the all-time list ahead of Pierre Turgeon. The 39-year-old is still very productive, tallying 22 goals and 47 points in 82 games last season. April 2, 2016 Iginla finally scored his 20th goal on Friday. He snapped a 12-game goal drought. March 2, 2016 Iginla scored his 19th goal Tuesday. It was the 608th of his career, tying Dino Ciccarelli for 17th place in NHL history. Feb. 25, 2016 Iginla recorded a goal in Wednesday's win over San Jose. The 38-year-old is on a five-game point streak and has scored five goals in the past seven games. Feb. 18, 2016 Iginla tapped in a perfect pass with 2:03 left for his second goal of the game and the Colorado Avalanche beat the Montreal Canadiens 3-2 on Wednesday night. He has four goals and five assists in seven games. Feb. 12, 2016 Iginla had two goals on the power play and an assist as the Avalanche beat the Senators 4-3 on Thursday night to end a four-game losing streak. Iginla has six points in a four-game surge for the Avs. Jan. 5, 2016 Iginla became the 19th member of the NHL's 600-goal club with his 11th of the season during Monday's 4-1 win over Los Angeles. The 38-year-old has 21 points in his 19th season, the latest coming from a shot that hit off the skate of Kings defenseman Jake Muzzin and bounced past goalie Jhonas Enroth. Dec. 1, 2015 Iginla scored his eighth goal for Colorado on Monday against the Islanders. Iginla snapped an eight-game drought without a goal. Nov. 20, 2015 Iginla assisted on two goals in Thursday's loss to the Penguins. Iginla's eight assists are tied with three other players for the third-best Colorado total. Oct. 19, 2015 Iginla recorded his first assist this season on a Matt Duchene goal in the second period on Sunday. It was Iginla's first point since scoring in the season's first two games. April 12, 2015 Iginla's second power-play goal with 32.9 seconds left lifted the Colorado Avalanche to a 3-2 victory over the slumping Chicago Blackhawks on Saturday night. With 29 goals, Iginla just missed reaching 30 for the 13th time in 14 seasons. He finishes 2014-15 with 589 career goals, 19th all-time. March 29, 2015 Iginla had three assists Saturday night. Iginla has nine points in his last eight games. March 26, 2015 Iginla stayed hot with his 25th goal of the season Wednesday against the Oilers. The 37-year-old veteran continues to produce, scoring seven goals in his last 12 games. March 13, 2015 Iginla scored in the second period and got the decisive goal in the shootout in a 2-1 win over New Jersey on Thurdsay night. Iginla has four of his team-leading 22 goals and two assists in his last seven games. Jan. 9, 2015 Iginla scored two goals in Thursday's win against Ottawa. Ten of Iginla's 12 goals this season have come in his last 21 games. Dec. 24, 2014 Iginla had a goal and an assist in Tuesday's win over St. Louis. Iginla owns a plus-four rating over his last six games to break even on the season. Dec. 22, 2014 Iginla scored in the tiebreaker to lift the Avalanche to a 2-1 victory over the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday night. He doesn't have a non-shootout goal in four games, but is still a decent fantasy option. Dec. 21, 2014 Iginla matched his career high for assists with three in a 5-1 rout of Buffalo on Saturday night. Iginla also tied his season high for points and is now second on the Avalanche with 21. He had three goals in his first seven games this month. Dec. 6, 2014 Iginla scored both goals for the Avalanche on Friday. He's scored four of his six goals in the last seven games. Oct. 25, 2014 Iginla collected his first two goals for Colorado and had an assist, helping the Avalanche beat the Canucks 7-3 on Friday night. Iginla has recorded all seven of his points in the last five games. July 1, 2014 A person with knowledge of the situation says the Colorado Avalanche have signed Iginla to a three-year, $16 million deal. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the deal has yet to be announced. Iginla scored 30 goals and had 31 assists in 78 games with the Boston Bruins last season. He will be counted on to help fill the scoring void left by Paul Stastny, who signed a four-year, $28 million deal with St. Louis earlier in the day. April 3, 2014 Iginla returned to the Boston Bruins lineup on Thursday, a night after he missed a game in Detroit due to injury. Iginla replaced forward Carl Soderberg, who returned to Boston for the birth of his child, according to coach Claude Julien. The 36-year-old former Calgary Flames captain leads the Bruins with 30 goals and is second in points with 61. April 2, 2014 Iginla is sitting out against the Detroit Red Wings because of a lower-body injury. Iginla sat out Wednesday night after playing in the Bruins' first 75 games this season.

March 23, 2014 Iginla scored twice in Saturday's win over Phoenix. He has nine goals and an assist on an eight-game point streak. March 15, 2014 Iginla recorded his 22nd and 23rd goals of the season in Saturday's win over Carolina.

Iginla has six goals over his last eight road games. Dec. 10, 2013 Iginla received an extended standing ovation before the opening faceoff of his first game back in Calgary since his trade last season. The Calgary Flames honored their former captain with a video montage, but Scotiabank Saddledome was on its feet before the tribute. Iginla was a Flame for 16 seasons and team captain for nine before he agreed to be dealt to the Pittsburgh Penguins in March. He signed with the Boston Bruins as a free agent in the offseason. Nov. 12, 2013 Iginla scored his fourth goal in Monday's 3-0 win over Tampa Bay. He had been held five straight games without one.

Iginla has two goals and five assists during a four-game point streak. Oct. 24, 2013 Iginla had two assists in Wednesday's win over the Sabres. He has four assists this season but is still searching for his first goal. July 5, 2013 After the Boston Bruins failed to get Iginla at the trade deadline, they grabbed him in free agency. The longtime Flames forward, who was traded to Pittsburgh in March, signed a one-year deal with the Bruins on Friday. The right wing will have a base salary of $1.8 million along with $4.2 million in incentives, which gives him a $6 million salary cap charge. He registered 14 goals and 33 points in 44 games between Calgary and Pittsburgh, and then had four goals and eight assists in 15 postseason games with the Penguins. March 30, 2013 Jarome Iginla is all set to make his Pittsburgh Penguins debut. The former Calgary Flames captain, acquired early Thursday in Pittsburgh's latest blockbuster trade, was in the lineup Saturday against the New York Islanders. The 35-year-old forward had 525 goals and 570 assists in 1,219 regular-season games during 16 seasons with Calgary. He had nine goals and 13 assists in 31 games this season. March 28, 2013 The Pittsburgh Penguins have acquired Jarome Iginla from the Calgary Flames. The Flames announced the deal after their victory over Colorado on Wednesday night, sending their longtime captain to the Eastern Conference-leading Penguins in exchange for college prospects Kenneth Agostino and Ben Hanowski and a first-round pick this year. The 35-year-old Iginla is in the final year of his contract and will be an unrestricted free agent July 1. He was scratched from Calgary's lineup against Colorado, ending his consecutive games streak at 441. Iginla has nine goals and 13 assists in 31 games this season. In 1,219 career regular-season games in 16 seasons, all with Calgary, he has 525 goals and 570 assists. He has 28 goals and 21 assists in 54 career playoff games. March 27, 2013 The Calgary Flames scratched Jarome Iginla from their lineup Wednesday night against Colorado amid trade speculation surrounding the longtime captain. The 35-year-old Iginla, in his 16th season with the Flames, is in the final year of his contract. Calgary is 14th in the Western Conference and will likely miss the playoffs for the fourth straight season. Iginla missed a game for the first time since April 7, 2007, ending his consecutive games streak at 441. He has nine goals and 13 assists in 31 games this season.

Iginla, who also scored twice in Sunday's 5-4 win over Phoenix, now has four goals in his last three games. He tallied just one over his first 16. Feb. 25, 2013 Iginla scored twice Sunday in a 5-4 win over Phoenix. Iginla had scored just one goal over the first 16 games. Hopefully Sunday's effort is a sign of things to come.

Iginla has been criticized by the Calgary media, but this was a solid performance for the veteran. Feb. 6, 2013 Iginla scored his first goal of the season Tuesday in a 4-1 win at Detroit. Iginla has just two goals (and eight assists) in his last 18 games dating to the end of last season. Jan. 16, 2013 Iginla practiced at Flames training camp for the first time this season Wednesday and believes he'll be ready to play in the season opener against the San Jose Sharks. The 35-year-old captain missed the first three days of training camp because of a groin injury. &quot;Thankfully I felt really good out there today,&quot; Iginla said following practice. &quot;I didn't feel it and it felt way better than last week. Last week, it didn't feel very good at all.&quot; Iginla is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent after this lockout-shortened season. He's entering the final year of a five-year deal paying him $7 million per season. Jan. 13, 2013 Iginla missed the Calgary Flames' first practice of the season on Sunday with a groin injury. The Flames captain watched from the owners' box at the Scotiabank Saddledome while the rest of his teammates had their long-awaited first skate. With Calgary set to open the season with back-to-back home games against the San Jose Sharks next Sunday and the Anaheim Ducks the following day, coach Bob Hartley said he didn't want to take any chances with Iginla. But he expects Iginla to be cleared to get back on the ice with his teammates shortly. March 27, 2012 Iginla had two assists Monday in a 5-4 win over Dallas.

Jan. 7, 2012 The Calgary Flames' captain scored the 500th goal of his career Saturday against the Minnesota Wild. Iginla came down the right wing and sent a pass in front that went off the skates of two Minnesota players and in past Wild goalie Nicklas Backstrom.

Sept. 29, 2011 Iginla skates for the first time since back spasms sent him off the ice during the opening day of training camp on Sept. 18.
