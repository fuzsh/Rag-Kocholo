        "text": "While Evgeni Malkin won’t be leaving the NHL anytime soon, he is thinking ahead to his next deal, telling TASS in Russia that he’d like to play at least one season with Metallurg Magnitogorsk before calling it a career. The 37-year-old has played in that organization twice so far, first at the beginning of his career before being drafted by Pittsburgh while also suiting up for them back in 2012-13 during the lockout where he finished third in KHL scoring despite missing 15 games. Malkin enters 2024-25 sitting 37th in all-time NHL points and with him having two years left on his contract with the Penguins, he will be moving up that list fairly quickly before potentially wrapping up his career back home.\n\nOther international notes with an NHL connection:\n\nWhile veteran free agent Nikita Gusev was hoping to return to the NHL next season, it doesn’t appear that will be the case. Sport-Express’ Mikhail Zislis relays that the 32-year-old is expected to return to Russia in the coming days and re-sign with Dynamo Moscow in the KHL. Gusev last played in the NHL back in 2020-21 with New Jersey and Florida but was a dominant performer last season in Russia, leading the KHL in scoring with 89 points in 68 games, fueling the hope that he could return to the top level but it doesn’t appear that will happen.\n\nVeteran defenseman Andrej Sustr has elected to return home, inking a contract with HC Dynamo, per a team release. The 33-year-old is a veteran of more than 400 NHL games between the regular season and playoffs but hasn’t seen action at the top level since the 2021-22 campaign. Last season, Sustr played with Kolner Haie in Germany, recording 20 points in 44 games.\n\nUnrestricted free agent center Philippe Maillet has signed a one-year deal with HC Ambri-Piotta in Switzerland, per a team release. The 31-year-old returned to North America last summer after spending two years in Russia but spent all of last season in the AHL with Laval where he had 53 points in 67 games. Maillet has two career NHL appearances under his belt with Washington back in 2020-21.\n\nFormer Florida blueliner Bogdan Kiselevich is on the move in Russia as Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk announced that they’ve signed him to a contract for next season. Kiselevich played in 32 games with the Panthers back in 2018-19 but returned to the KHL the following season, signing with CSKA Moscow. The 34-year-old spent last season with Avangard Omsk, recording eight assists in 60 games.\n\nDanny O’Regan is off to the KHL as Kunlun announced (Twitter link) that they’ve signed the veteran to a one-year deal. O’Regan has 30 career NHL appearances over parts of four years but after spending all of 2022-23 in the minors, he opted to head overseas. The 30-year-old spent last season in Sweden with MoDo, picking up four goals and eight assists in 34 games."
