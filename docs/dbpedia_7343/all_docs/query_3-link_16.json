        "text": "All the i's have been dotted and t's have been crossed and the NHL schedule has finally been released. According to the Pittsburgh Penguins, here is their 2012-13 schedule.\n\nPITTSBURGH PENGUINS 2012-13 REGULAR-SEASON SCHEDULE\n\nSaturday Jan. 19 at Philadelphia 3:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Jan. 20 at NY Rangers 7:00 p.m.\n\nWednesday Jan. 23 Toronto 7:00 p.m.\n\nFriday Jan. 25 at Winnipeg 8:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Jan. 27 at Ottawa 5:00 p.m.\n\nTuesday Jan. 29 NY Islanders 7:30 p.m.\n\nThursday Jan. 31 at NY Rangers 7:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday Feb. 2 New Jersey 1:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Feb. 3 at Washington 12:30 p.m.\n\nTuesday Feb. 5 at NY Islanders 7:00 p.m.\n\nThursday Feb. 7 Washington 7:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday Feb. 9 at New Jersey 1:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Feb. 10 New Jersey 7:30 p.m.\n\nWednesday Feb. 13 Ottawa 7:00 p.m.\n\nFriday Feb. 15 at Winnipeg 7:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Feb. 17 at Buffalo 12:30 p.m.\n\nWednesday Feb. 20 Philadelphia 7:30 p.m.\n\nFriday Feb. 22 Florida 7:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Feb. 24 Tampa Bay 7:30 p.m.\n\nTuesday Feb. 26 at Florida 7:30 p.m.\n\nThursday Feb. 28 at Carolina 7:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday Mar. 2 at Montreal 7:00 p.m.\n\nMonday Mar. 4 Tampa Bay 7:30 p.m.\n\nThursday Mar. 7 at Philadelphia 7:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday Mar. 9 at Toronto 7:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Mar. 10 NY Islanders 7:00 p.m.\n\nTuesday Mar. 12 Boston 7:30 p.m.\n\nThursday Mar. 14 at Toronto 7:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday Mar. 16 NY Rangers 1:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Mar. 17 Boston 12:30 p.m.\n\nTuesday Mar. 19 Washington 7:30 p.m.\n\nFriday Mar. 22 at NY Islanders 7:00 p.m.\n\nSunday Mar. 24 Philadelphia 7:00 p.m.\n\nTuesday Mar. 26 Montreal 7:00 p.m.\n\nThursday Mar. 28 Winnipeg 7:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday Mar. 30 NY Islanders 1:00 p.m.\n\nTuesday Apr. 2 Buffalo 7:30 p.m.\n\nWednesday Apr. 3 at NY Rangers 7:30 p.m.\n\nFriday Apr. 5 NY Rangers 7:00 p.m.\n\nTuesday Apr. 9 at Carolina 7:00 p.m.\n\nThursday Apr. 11 at Tampa Bay 7:30 p.m.\n\nSaturday Apr. 13 at Florida 7:30 p.m.\n\nWednesday Apr. 17 Montreal 7:00 p.m.\n\nFriday Apr. 19 at Boston 7:00 p.m.\n\nSaturday Apr. 20 Buffalo 7:00 p.m.\n\nMonday Apr. 22 at Ottawa 7:30 p.m.\n\nThursday Apr. 25 at New Jersey 7:30 p.m.\n\nSaturday Apr. 27 Carolina 7:00 p.m.\n\nSome things that stand out:\n\n-Eight matinee weekend games, all with NBC implications in mind. Pittsburgh has long been one of the most visible and attractive teams on the ratings needle, and coming out of a lockout where the NHL needs to ride their star players and marquee names it's no surprise that Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin promos will be in over-drive.\n\n-Nothing like four of the first six games on the road in the first eight days of the season and that travel itenary is pretty daunting. At Philly for the emotional afternoon opener Saturday, at NY Rangers for their home opener on Sunday night, hosting Toronto on Wednesday before flying out to Winnipeg for Friday night and then jetting back to Ottawa for a weird start-time of 5:00 Sunday.\n\n-Super Bowl Sunday will again be spent in Washington, like it was a few years ago. Luckily this team, there's no chance of a Steelers conflict and hopefully no bad blizzard in DC.\n\n-The worst road-trip of them all might be after Valentine's Day. Wednesday Feb 13, host Ottawa then fly out to Winnipeg for a Friday night game then the Pens have to jet back to the East to play Buffalo at 12:30 on Sunday afternoon. I'm tired just thinking about that swing.\n\n-Things settle down mid-way through, Pens are home 10 of 12 games from March 10 - April 2, with only trips to Toronto (Mar 14) and NY Islanders (March 22) to break up a pretty long home-stand.\n\n-Five Seven back to back games over the course of the season but it's just a relentless schedule with only five instances of two days off in a row.\n\n-Toward the end of the year, Thursday Apr 11 at Tampa then Saturday the 13th at Florida and then no games until Wednesday the 17th. Spring break, anyone?\n\n-The season ends, April 27th by hosting Carolina in what will be ex-Penguin Jordan Staal's only regular season appearance back in Pittsburgh this season.\n\n-Anything else stand out to you guys on the schedule? Any certain days circled or especially looking forward to?"
