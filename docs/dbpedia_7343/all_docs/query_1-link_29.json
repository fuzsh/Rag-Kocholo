        "text": "The Penguins announced last week that they would hold their annual Rookie Development Camp during the week of July 15-19. Wilkes-Barre coach John Hynes will run the on ice portion of the camp but all of the Pens new coaching staff and management team is expected to be on hand. Today, the organization announced the roster for the camp. Twenty-one forwards, twelve defensemen and four goalies will attend including some familiar names and some that you may not have heard. Here is what you need to know about the guys coming to camp.\n\nForwards\n\nTwenty-one forwards were invited to take part in the Pens Rookie Camp next week: Anthony Angello, Josh Archibald, Teddy Blueger, Blaine Byron, Jean-Sebastien Dea, Jake Guentzel, Troy Josephs, Kasperi Kapanen, Tom Kuhnackl, Sam Lafferty, Nick Lappin, Jaden Lindo, Matia Marcantuoni, Brad McClure, Adam Payerl, Bryan Rust, Connor Sheary, Oskar Sundqvist, Dominik Uher, Scott Wilson and Anton Zlobin.\n\nAll four forwards selected in the 2014 NHL Draft will attend camp, including first rounder Kasperi Kapanen. Several familiar names from Wilkes-Barre will appear as well, including several who made their pro debut this spring after finishing up college play. Here are just a few things to look for out of these forwards above:\n\nFirstly, Kasperi Kapanen needs to shine during this camp. GM Jim Rutherford has stated since free agency began that he believes Kapanen can make a run at making the final 23 man roster come October with Pittsburgh. If that is the case, Kapanen needs to shine this week and be above and beyond the other 21 forwards. Remember, Kapanen was the #1 ranked European player available in the Draft and last year at this time Olli Maatta had a stellar rookie camp that propelled him to a final roster spot.\n\nSeveral college players have the chance to make a name for themselves this week as well. Connor Sheary was signed out of UMASS Amherst last spring and is a solid player. Josh Archibald was an offensive powerhouse who played at Jayson Megna's alma mater (U of Nebraska-Omaha) last year and Scott Wilson finished up another solid collegiate campaign at UMASS Lowell. I would expect these three guys to be playing exclusively at Wilkes-Barre this year, but if any can find significant scoring touch (as Archibald really showed at his time at U of N) then they may see some time in Pittsburgh.\n\nOskar Sundqvist will appear again at rookie camp after finally signing an entry-level contract earlier this spring. He should play at Wilkes-Barre this year but the Swede could see time in Pittsburgh in the near future.\n\nAnton Zlobin was featured in one of my earlier pieces about Pens prospects. The young Russian may not impact the Pens this season, but I think he could down the road. A good week in Pittsburgh could go a long way.\n\nDefensemen\n\nTwelve defensemen will attend the Rookie Camp next week. They are: Dane Birks, Alex Boak, Nick D'Agostino, Brian Dumoulin, Scott Harrington, Reid McNeill, Derrick Pouliot, Daniel Renoug, Harrison Ruopp, Ryan Segalla, Clark Seymour and Jeff Taylor.\n\nHalf of the defensemen attending have previously attended this camp. Many were prominent players at Wilkes-Barre last year. Here are a couple things to look for from the defensemen:\n\nDerrick Pouliot was invited, but will not participate in any hockey activities as he recuperates from shoulder surgery. He was expected to make a run at a roster spot come October like Olli Maatta did last season, but I wouldn't expect him to do that even when he is healthy. He will play at Wilkes-Barre when he returns.\n\nBrian Dumoulin and Scott Harrington will once again attend camp. However, this time they both have a lot on the line. It is important that both shine during rookie camp, as both have been speculated to be in the competition to make the final 23 man roster come October.\n\n2014 7th round pick, Jeff Taylor, will also attend camp. He will return to play at Union College in the fall, where he was part of the NCAA Championship team last season.\n\nThough not expected to make a run at roster spots, Nick D'Agostino, Reid McNeill and Harrison Ruopp will be expected to lead the Wilkes-Barre defensive corps this season. All three saw significant time at WBS last year and they will be looked upon to hold the line down there again this season.\n\nGoalies\n\nThe four goalies who will be attending rookie camp are: Tristan Jarry, Matt Murray, Jake Hildebrand and Stephen Mastelerz. Here are a few things too look for out of this group:\n\nTristan Jarry will headline the goalie corps this year. After being drafted in the 2nd Round of 2013 and proclaiming he was ready to take the reins from Marc-Andre Fleury as early as last year, Jarry was phenomenal in the WHL for Edmonton last year. He went 44-14-3 with 2.24 GAA. I would expect him to see another year in Juniors, but with a big camp he may get the jump to Wheeling or Wilkes-Barre.\n\nMichigan State's Jake Hildebrand and UMASS Amherst's Stephen Mastelerz are the only collegiates in the group this year.\n\nMatt Murray made his pro debut for WBS last year, but spent the majority of the season in Juniors. I would expect him make the jump to the pros full time this year, most likely at Wheeling.\n\nEric Hartzell is not part of the camp, because he is no longer on an entry level contract. He will most likely be the full time goalie at Wilkes-Barre this season, especially if Peter Mannino does not return.\n\nDay 2 of the NHL Draft in Philadelphia has proven to be a quieter day for the Pittsburgh Penguins after the shocking events of Round 1. The Penguins had four selections on Day 2, missing out on picks in rounds two and three from previous trades under the Shero administration. The Pens first selection on Saturday came in the 4th round and they went local (more on that later). Overall, the Pens went with three American players today, the most since 2010. OneCanadians were taken by the Pens this year and of course their first round, Kasperi Kapenen, hails for Finland. With that, let's take a look at Sam Lafferty, Anthony Angello, Jaden Lindo and Jeff Taylor, the newest members of the Pittsburgh Penguins.\n\nSam Lafferty\n\nAnthony Angello\n\nAnother American forward was taken by the Pens with the 145th overall pick in the 5th Round. 18 year old Anthony Angello from Albany, New York was the final part of the Pens previous trade of defenseman Ben Lovejoy to the Ducks.\n\nAngello spent the past season playing for Omaha in the USHL. During his season with the Lancers, he put up 11 goals and 21 points in 58 games.\n\nRanked number 114 overall by NHL Central Scouting, he is committed to play college hockey at Cornell. He appears to be more of a two-way forward, not a high flying scorer many would hope. However, his 6'4\" 190lbs frame may remind some of a young Jordan Staal. If he grows into his height, he could be a formidable NHL forward down the road.\n\nJaden Lindo\n\nJeff Taylor\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMy final impressions of the 2014 NHL Draft for the Pens is overall good. They certainly went hard after forwards, which they definitely needed to do. Kasperi Kapanen (who you can read about in one of my previous posts), is a steal at the 22nd pick overall. He is probably two years away from being NHL ready, but that would put him on track to follow in the footsteps of the Finn taken at #22 in the 2012 Draft, Olli Maatta. Sam Lafferty is an interesting pick, but has a while to go before determining who he will develop into. Anthony Angello is a solid pick, his big body could project into a solid bottom six forward. I think besides Kapanen, Jaden Lindo is the steal of the draft. A knee injury caused him to drop three rounds, but the Pens I think will be pleased with him. I think he is comparable to Max Talbot and may have more scoring touch. His scouting report from Elite Hockey Prospects has me very excited about the impact he could have on the Bottom 6 down the road. Jeff Taylor, solid pick. He will add to an already deep pool of defensive prospects for the Pens. If he develops into something, he could be a trade piece down the road or he may work his way into the Pens rotation. Overall, a solid performance by the new staff in their drafting methods. I will close with my welcome to Kasperi, Sam, Anthony, Jaden and Jeff to the Pittsburgh Penguins organization."
