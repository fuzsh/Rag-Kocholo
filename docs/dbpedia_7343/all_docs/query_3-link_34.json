        "text": "It is the Pittsburgh Penguins vs. the Chicago Blackhawks at PPG Paints Arena on Tuesday. The subplot is all-time great Sidney Crosby of the Penguins welcoming 2023 first-overall pick Connor Bedard to the NHL in front of a national TV audience. There are 10 pounds of storylines in a five-pound bag as the Penguins begin the quest to return to the playoffs after their 16-year run was snapped after a loss to the Blackhawks last season.\n\nThe puck will drop after 8 p.m. on ESPN.\n\nThere are no stats and no recent regular season games to draw from. The Penguins beat the Buffalo Sabres 7-4 Friday in their final preseason tilt. Sidney Crosby fought, Drew O’Connor scored a pair of breakaway goals, and coach Mike Sullivan smirked when he referred to the contest as a “high event game.”\n\nEveryone is healthy, though the Penguins maintain All-Star winger Jake Guentzel is a game-time decision. The team has only 12 forwards on the opening night roster after sending Radim Zohorna to the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins after they claimed defenseman John Ludvig on waivers from the Florida Panthers.\n\nLudvig and potential seventh defenseman Ryan Shea await their fate, but both participated in the optional morning skate.\n\nThe game will also be the Penguins’ debut for seven players: defensemen Erik Karlsson and Ryan Graves, forwards Matt Nieto, Reilly Smith, Jansen Harkins, Lars Eller, and Noel Acciari.\n\nTristan Jarry will start for the Penguins. Petr Mrazek will tend the pipes for Chicago.\n\nExpected Pittsburgh Penguins Lines:\n\nJake Guentzel-Sidney Crosby-Bryan Rust\n\nReilly Smith-Evgeni Malkin-Rickard Rakell\n\nJansen Harkins-Lars Eller-Drew O’Connor\n\nMatt Nieto-Noel Acciari-Jeff Carter\n\nDefense:\n\nRyan Graves-Kris Letang\n\nMarcus Pettersson-Erik Karlsson\n\nP.O Joseph-Chad Ruhwedel\n\nGoalie:\n\nTristan Jarry\n\nBlackhawks Lines:\n\nTaylor Hall-Connor Bedard-Ryan Donato\n\nTyler Johnson-Lukas Reichel-Taylor Raddysh\n\nBoris Katchouk-Cole Guttman-Andreas Athanasiou\n\nCorey Perry-Jason Dickinson-Nick Foligno\n\nDefense:\n\nAlex Vlasic-Seth Jones\n\nKevin Korchinski-Connor Murphy\n\nJarred Tinordi-Wyatt Keiser\n\nGoalies:\n\nPetr Mrazek\n\nPenguins Special Teams:\n\nPenguins Power Play: 0-0.\n\nPenguins Penalty Kill: 0-0.\n\nBlackhawks Power Play: 0-0.\n\nBlackhawks Penalty Kill: 0-0.\n\nPenguins Game Notes:\n\nErik Karlsson has points in four consecutive games against Chicago (2-4-6) and has 17 points (2-17-19) in 21 career games against the Blackhawks.\n\nThe Penguins are 30-15-10 all-time in home openers, including a 7-2-1 record in the last 10 games.\n\nHow to Watch the Penguins Game:"
