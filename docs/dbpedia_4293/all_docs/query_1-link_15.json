beginning in the late 1950s and intensive care beds and units have an increasingly important role to play in hospitals around the globe as patients survive conditions to which, in the past, they would have succumbed. Advances in technology, improved understanding of normal physiology and disease pathogenesis, and better general processes of care at all levels of the medical system, have all played a role in this progress. This growth has fuelled research and further development to such an extent that it is, sometimes, difficult to keep up-to-date with the latest best practice for our patients. The Textbook of Critical Care, edited by Dr Yatin Mehta, Dr Jeetendra Sharma and Dr Mukesh Kumar Gupta, is clearly a very welcome update, providing intensivists and all involved in the management of critically-ill patients with the latest guidance from experts on a broad range of relevant topics. Starting with the global concepts like scoring systems and patient transport, the book moves through general physiological aspects of electrolyte and fluid balance, glycemic control and mechanical ventilation, to consider each organ system in more detail. Specific patient groups are also covered, for example, pregnant, post-transplant, or trauma patients. And finally, the topical issues of ICU organization and ethics are addressed. In spite of the internet revolution, books remain a vital source of information and a means of imparting knowledge and expertise. I am honored to have been asked to write the Foreword for this comprehensive book on critical care and congratulate Dr Mehta for a job well done! Jean-Louis Vincent MD PhD Professor of Intensive Care Medicine Université Libre de Bruxelles Department of Intensive Care, Erasme University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium President, World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine (WFSICCM)\n\nAL GRAWANY\n\nForeword The tremendous improvement in critical care over the last two decades is due to better understanding of pathophysiology and management of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome by the intensivists. Patients, who were considered terminally-ill or non-salvageable, are being sent home with good quality of life and this is supported by the technological advances in organ support. As the longevity increases, older patients also come for major surgical procedures such as coronary artery bypass surgery and are discharged home due to joint efforts by the cardiac surgeons and cardiac critical care specialists using all their expertise, knowledge and perseverance ably supported by technology. This is also applicable to all other surgical specialties, as can be seen in the section in this textbook on surgical critical care. Dr Yatin Mehta has been with me for over the last 28 years and I have seen him grow from a cardiac anesthesiologist to a full-fledged intensivist and this comprehensive textbook of critical care is a proof of that. Generally, Indians tend to extrapolate Western literature to Indian context, which may not be completely correct. Environment, genetic and racial factors along with availability of resources may seriously affect the incidence and outcome. This excellent book can fill in that void. Masters of their respective fields, from all over the world, have contributed to this book. I congratulate Yatin and his colleagues for this commendable effort. Naresh Trehan Diplomate American Board of Cardiothoracic Surgery Chairman, Medanta Heart Institute CMD, Medanta – The Medicity Gurgaon, Haryana, India\n\nForeword A new book on critical care medicine always comes with an inherent excitement. This book is no exception. The field of critical care has grown enormously over the last four decades since the Society of Critical Care Medicine was established in the early 1970s. From a humble beginning, the field of this practice has moved at a very rapid pace. In India, there were initial isolated attempts in the early 1980s, but the real thrust came after the evolution of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine in 1993. From then on, the specialty has been galloping to its current uniquely privileged position. Along with the growth in number of ICUs and the equipment and the number of trained and qualified specialists practicing critical care, there has been a constant atmosphere of academics and science. This has disseminated to all parts of the country and has been a major achievement of any body of professionals in the field of medicine. It is, therefore, no surprising that we are now getting a full-fledged textbook of critical care. Dr Yatin Mehta has been a strong pillar and a significant contributor to the ethical, academic, vibrant and modern face of the field of critical care in India. Under his able leadership, this textbook is seeing the light of the day. This is indeed a proud moment for all of us in this field. Along with the contributions in the field of education and practice of this specialty, this has been an additional feather in the cap of Dr Yatin Mehta. The list of contributors to this textbook, both Indian and International, has been significant. Almost everyone who is in ‘Who’s Who in this field, has contributed, and this is very remarkable. Excellent International contributors have complemented this in a balanced way. This retains the flavor of the book and, at the same time, has the weight of International level of contributions. Besides this, the list of topics is also exhaustive. Almost all topics have been covered in detail and one will find most of the academic material here. With the publication of this textbook, Dr Yatin Mehta and his team have made a significant and important contribution for which they deserve all the compliments. I am sure, all of us will find this textbook very useful and interesting. Shirish Prayag MD FICCM Managing Director and Chief Consultant Critical Care Medicine, Prayag Hospital Pune, Maharashtra, India\n\nAL GRAWANY\n\nPreface Critical care has been growing at a rapid pace all over the world, including underdeveloped and developing countries, as the Health Care Industry itself is growing at a very fast rate despite the slump in the growth rate of all other industries. With early detection and diagnosis of life-threatening diseases with population explosion without supportive infrastructure, infectious diseases and severe sepsis are increasing in numbers, severity, and drug resistance with poor outcomes and prolonged ICU and hospital stay with substantial cost implications. Critical care is relatively a new specialty in the medical world, although started in 1954 Polio Epidemic in Denmark where Dr Yatin Mehta had the good fortune to work 30 years back! Since then many postgraduate fellowships and diplomas, such as EDIC, FNB, IDCCM, have come up with standard training and exit examinations. With a surge of research, academics and trainings in critical care assisted by a strong support by technology, there is a need for supporting educational material, and hence this book took the present shape to furnish this requirement. No one is a master of all aspects of critical care—the sea of knowledge is too vast—so first we decided to invite the best people as contributors in their respective fields irrespective of their geographical locations. Obviously, for some specific issues like tropical illnesses requiring intensive care, snakebite, and some poisonings, specific authors were approached. All authors are from around the globe, including US, Canada, UK, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, India, Nepal, and so on. Knowledge has no boundaries, although resources do, but with private tertiary care hospitals coming up and an easy access to internet, these boundaries are also getting blurred. The book is a good example of this phenomenon, as “Critical Care” is uniting the Medical World! This is also proven by one of the best known leaders in critical care worldwide, Professor Jean-Louis Vincent who wrote Foreword for this book in this endeavor. The book is divided into 111 chapters that are further separated by 14 sections for an easy comprehension of the subject. Section 1 (General Principles) deals with general principles of critical care, including severity scoring, and monitoring various aspects of ventilation, ECMO, sugar control, sedoanalgesia, delirium, etc. Section 2 (Cardiovascular System) deals with all aspects of acute cardiovascular pathology requiring ICU admission. With the early diagnosis and shorter door to balloon or needle time even in developing countries, ACS and aortic dissections are reaching to hospitals with subsequent admission in ICU. We have especially included the newer antiplatelets, antithrombotic agents as they are new arrivals in developing countries. Section 3 (Respiratory System) presents critical care in cases of acute respiratory syndrome, respiratory failure, obstructive pulmonary diseases, severe asthma, pneumonia, hemoptysis, pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. Section 4 (Renal System) is on acute kidney infection and renal replacement therapy. Section 5 (Gastrointestinal Tract, Pancreas and Hepatobiliary System) also contains chapters on how to approach elevated live enzymes and portal hypertension, along with the common ICU issues related to GI, pancreas and liver. Section 6 (Neurology) starts with the approach to an unconscious patient and covers the common neurocritical problems like stroke, seizures, infections, and neuromuscular disorders requiring ICU admission. Section 7 (Endocrine) covers the sugar control, DI and SIADH, thyroid and adrenals. Section 8 (Post-surgical Critical Care) is a relatively new section for a critical care book where the chapters are jointly written by the surgeons and critical care specialists in that field and covers neuro, cardiac, vascular, thoracic, and transplants with the discussion on immunosuppression. Section 9 (Obstetric Critical Care) and Section 10 (Hematology, Rheumatology and Oncology) are poorly recognized and poorly developed field in the underdeveloped and developing countries, so these two sections have special significance in the book. Section 11 (Infections) deals with bacterial, viral, fungal, rickettsial infections, including community-acquired and nosocomial. Evaluation of fever in ICU and principles of antimicrobial therapy, including pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are also discussed in this section. Section 12 (Toxicology and Environmental Injuries) contains chapters on poisoning, snakebites and environmental injuries needing critical care.\n\nxxvi\n\nTextbook of Critical Care\n\nTrauma is becoming a major concern all over the developing countries. Factors like faster cars, bad roads, young blood and alcohol, etc. are responsible for an increasing flow to triage and subsequently to the critical care. Section 13 (Trauma) deals separately with initial assessment followed by head, chest, spine, long bones and abdominal trauma with their complications like rhabdomyolysis and fat embolism. Last but not the least is the potpourri which includes brain death, end of life, ICU design and research. These are covered in Section 14 (Miscellaneous). We hope that the book contributes to the teaching and training of everyone involved in the care of critically ill patients, from the residents to the chiefs, from tertiary care modern hospitals in the metropolis to the peripheral hospitals in town with a few ICU beds. Yatin Mehta Jeetendra Sharma Mukesh Kumar Gupta\n\nAcknowledgments I had been thinking of coming out with a comprehensive textbook of critical care since quite some time as there is a want of such multi-author books in the world.

Death may be imminent, for example, in severe upper airways obstruction or from severe prolonged hypoxia due to any other cause or from irreversible cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction. It may not be imminent, yet possible, or even probable in a patient with acute liver cell failure, acute kidney injury or severe trauma to the head with multiple contusions in the brain. These are merely examples (among several) where the criticality of an illness is obvious and the recognition easy. However, there are a number of instances where symptoms, physical examination and the results of basic investigations are such that the nature of a dangerous problem may go undetected. To give just two examples—a very recent mild substernal discomfort which the patient tends to ignore may well be due to an evolving acute myocardial infarction undetected by either electrocardiography or estimation of cardiac enzymes at that point of time. Similarly, sudden onset paresthesia in a limb without any positive neurological findings may herald the evolution of a massive cerebral infarct due to a block in the middle cerebral or internal carotid artery. These are just two examples where suspicion could lead to early recognition, which in turn could prompt correct treatment making more often than not a difference between life and death.\n\nMany critical illnesses have a varying gestation period before they become life-threatening. Good medicine lies in suspecting and diagnosing these illnesses well in time. The earlier the recognition, the better the prognosis. A major tenet of critical care medicine is to anticipate disaster, and not await it. Finally, it must be remembered that though most critical illnesses offer time for a careful clinical appraisal, there are some life-threatening illnesses, which carry an acute sense of urgency with regard to assessment, diagnosis and management. In these acute life-threatening problems, assessment, diagnosis and management often go hand in hand, more or less simultaneously. This is in striking contrast to routine admissions to the medical wards, where definite treatment is offered only after a thorough history, clinical examination, and investigations have provided an exact diagnosis.\n\nASSESSMENT OF A CRITICAL ILLNESS1,2 The initial assessment is necessarily a good clinical bedside evaluation—history and physical examination. In these days of burgeoning science, interns, residents, fellows and even recently qualified consultants in critical care are more concerned with the intricacies of the technological advances in critical care. Their interest is equally overfocused on protocols and guidelines for the management of various problems in critical care medicine. This has led to a\n\nAL GRAWANY\n\n4\n\nSection 1: General Principles\n\nprogressive loss of bedside skills. The use of gleaming machines, sophisticated gadgetry, advanced imaging techniques and numerous laboratory tests often performed in blunderbuss fashion have increased exponentially in recent decades, and critical care physicians often substitute these for a careful bedside evaluation. The physician often at the very outset seeks an answer to a problem from the imaging department or from other tests and when armed with the answer (which may well be wrong) sees little purpose in liaising with the patient or evaluating the patient clinically. The intensivist in these circumstances no longer ministers to a distinctive person, but to separate malfunctioning organs. The distressed patient, the human being is frequently forgotten or relegated to the background. Assessment of the patient on daily rounds is more often focussed on results of investigations, “numbers” churned out by machines, imaging findings, with a total neglect of bedside evaluation. This is not to belittle the importance of science and technology. After all, it is science and technology, which have given a quantum leap to medicine and all its branches into the 21st century. However, there is more to medicine than technology. Technology can substitute neither for a good history nor for a meticulous physical examination.\n\nHISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION If the exigency of a crisis allows no time for a proper history or a history is unavailable from the patient (as when the patient is obtunded) or from the relatives, the intensivist stands at a great disadvantage. If, however, there is sufficient time for a good history or even a targeted history and if the intensivist can separate the chaff from the grain and get to the heart of the problem, he or she starts with a great advantage. He may even make a shrewd guess as to the diagnosis or at least knows in what direction to proceed. Physical examination, time permitting should be thorough and meticulous. If time does not permit, it should start with a quick appraisal of vital signs so as to allow identification of a probable life-threatening illness which demands urgent attention. The signs (when considered together) suggesting severe illness are—heart rate greater than 120/min or less than 40/min, respiratory rate greater than 25/min or less than 8/min, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, temperature greater than 102–103°F or less than 96°F, oxygen saturation less than 90% on room air, capillary refill greater than 3 seconds, urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/hr for more than 4 hours, disturbance in higher functions and mental obtundation. The greater the number of variables that show the abnormalities stated above, and the greater the degree of\n\nCh-01.indd 4\n\nabnormalities of these variables, the greater the likelihood of a severe and often life-threatening illness. In a critically ill patient with immediate danger to life, the physician should adopt the ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure) approach as advocated in the Advanced Life Support, Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines. Problems are thereby prioritized according to the derangement, which is deemed to be most severe. Severe derangement should be dealt with at each stage before going on to the next step. For example, an obstructed airway should be recognized and opened before assessing breathing and circulation. In an emergency, the next step is to clinically evaluate basic features of organ dysfunction or failure. The organ systems one needs to consider are the cardiorespiratory system, the kidneys, central nervous system, the gastrointestinal system (which includes the liver) and the hematopoietic system. It is important not to miss out on metabolic abnormalities. Perturbations in a critical illness are most frequently observed in the cardiorespiratory and renal system. Organs in a critical illness often fail sequentially over time and multiple organ failure is frequently the determinant of death. It is important for the intensivist to detect early features of organ dysfunction. Failure of one organ system can adversely affect the function of another organ system. This is because organ systems are not compartmentalized; organs speak to one another. Early recognition of malfunctioning of one organ system and its appropriate management may well alter for better natural history of a critical illness. If an illness is not immediately life-threatening, there is always time for a meticulously performed physical examination. Physical examination is both an art and a science. The art lies in detecting physical signs and the science lies in interpreting these. It is often forgotten that careful physical examination can reveal signs which a machine cannot detect or signs which allow a more targeted investigation rather than a plethora of unnecessary tests. Here are a few examples—an experienced eye can often gauge the gravity of a patient’s illness from the look and appearance. Examination may reveal an unequal pupil, a flattened nasolabial fold, a markedly depressed bridge of the nose (as in Wegener’s), a butterfly rash on the face as in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), tight skin over the forehead suggesting scleroderma, telangiectasia over the lips in a patient with severe hemoptysis (possible hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia). It may reveal a nodule in the thyroid or a discrete palpable cervical node giving a clue to the diagnosis. Gynecomastia, spider nevi, flapping tremors, a soft aortic diastolic murmur, a pleural rub, pericardial rub, an obstructed femoral or inguinal hernia, absent tendon jerks, each in their own way contribute to a diagnosis or allow targeted investigations.\n\n25-06-2015 4:11:18 PM\n\nChapter 1: Recognition of Critical Illness\n\nIn this machine age, it is so important for the intensivist to cultivate his visual faculty, the ability to hear, feel and smell, to process what he has sensed within his brain to recall past experiences and relate these to the present problem so as to enable him or her to make a considered diagnosis and decide on the management of an illness. He can only do so if he is practiced in the art and science of physical examination. To quote Osler “learn to see, learn to hear, learn to feel, learn to smell and know that by practice alone can you become perfect”. History, a close communication with the patient on daily morning rounds and the ritual of a physical examination at the first encounter and on subsequent rounds serve two purposes: 1. As stated earlier, they may well provide a diagnosis or suggest how to proceed further in investigations. 2. They build a bond between the physician and a critically ill patient, a bond of trust and faith, a bond that in my opinion has a role in healing. It is difficult to give a scientific explanation for this observation. Perhaps faith and trust in the treating physician induce psychological events that causes changes in the neurotransmitters or in the chemistry and circuitry of the patient’s brain,3,4 thereby helping in healing and recovery. It is possible that after an initial assessment and a quick examination of various systems the exact etiology of a critical illness remains undetermined. Even so, there are certain issues, which are often present in critical illnesses caused by differing etiologies. The intensivist must run through these issues meticulously, search for them and if present correct them. He or she should also bear in mind acute conditions which if promptly diagnosed and treated could markedly improve outcome. These include: •• Hypoxia as judged by an O2 saturation less than 90% on room air. The lower the oxygen saturation, the greater the danger and the more imperative is the need to relieve the hypoxia. Even if the cause of severe hypoxia is not immediately evident, oxygen is administered at a high flow rate or better still through a mask and a nonrebreathing reservoir bag. The exception is in hypoxia due to an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) where controlled oxygen through a Ventimask should be administered. It is crucial to recognize and counter hypoxia. Persistent hypoxia leads to increasing organ dysfunction and is an important factor in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure. •• A c u t e c a r d i o r e s p i r a t o r y f a i l u r e a n d a c u t e cardiorespiratory distress may be due to several causes, but it is vital to recognize tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade. Both require urgent intervention, else death results.\n\nCh-01.indd 5\n\n5\n\n•• Shock of course would be recognized during the initial appraisal of the patient. A targeted history and a quick but careful examination of various systems, in particular the cardiorespiratory system should determine whether shock is hypovolemic, septic, cardiac or anaphylactic as appropriate treatment for each of these is urgently indicated. Fulminant tropical infections should always be considered in a patient presenting with septic shock. •• A ‘stroke’ is easily recognized but the diagnosis of a stroke in evolution should not be delayed, for if conditions are appropriate thrombolytic or interventional therapy can favorably influence outcome and disability. •• It should always be kept in mind that acute metabolic and endocrine problems may present with mental obtundation, disturbed consciousness and even coma, as also with hypotensive shock. Hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar nonketotic diabetic states are generally evident. Acute adrenocortical insufficiency, severe myxedema or an underlying hyperthyroid state presenting with atrial fibrillation, a fast ventricular rate and heart failure can be missed. Critical illnesses caused by marked hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia can only be identified with precision by appropriate blood tests. •• Hyperkalemia should always be considered in patients presenting with cardiovascular collapse and a disturbance in rhythm or impulse conduction. It is indeed a surreptitious killer that needs prompt recognition and treatment. •• Amongst the several causes of obtundation and coma, metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis may not be evident clinically, and may be only evident on an estimation of arterial pH and blood gases. There are a few pitfalls, one needs to point out with regard to the recognition of critical illnesses: •• A patient in distress who complains of pain at a particular site should not be dismissed lightly if clinical examination and basic tests reveal no abnormalities. Recent onset pain, particularly if severe, should not be ignored. •• Similarly, recent onset dyspnea on exertion or at rest even in a young individual should never be ignored though physical examination, ECG, X-ray chest and other basic tests are normal. To dub dyspnea as functional because the physician cannot find the cause can be disastrous. Pulmonary embolism is one condition, which may show no signs and no positive findings on routine tests. •• Nondescript symptoms and few or no signs may well hide a smouldering problem, which can suddenly manifest as a life-threatening illness. To diagnose this\n\n25-06-2015 4:11:19 PM\n\n6\n\nSection 1: General Principles\n\ncorrectly before this life-threatening eventually erupts is a credit to the physician and life-saving for the patient. •• In an obscure problem, the possibility of ‘poisoning’ should be kept in mind. •• A critically ill patient may have multiple problems, each life-threatening or potentially life-threatening but in different degrees. The intensivist should learn to prioritize these problems so that the most lifethreatening one is addressed first, even if this involves temporarily ignoring the others. What the physician does in correcting one problem should not as far as possible worsen the others. An intensivist solely focused on protocols and guidelines will be at sea in the above situation. Recognition, prioritization and the ability to handle a complex problem depends not only on knowledge, skill, logic, experience, but on clinical judgment, the hallmark of a good physician. In my opinion, good clinical judgment is an inborn faculty. It cannot be equated with intelligence; it can be augmented by experience but not necessarily so. An intensivist, who in addition to his perceptive faculties also has good clinical judgment, is truly blessed by the gods. He has an attribute, which no science can invent and no machine can duplicate. •• As a corollary to the above, clinical judgment when dealing with an individual patient should not be sacrificed at the altar of protocols and guidelines. •• There is unquestionably a sense of urgency in the diagnosis and treatment of a critical illness. Immediate action is for example needed to treat cardiorespiratory arrest, a tension pneumothorax, a severe bleed, cardiovascular collapse, a life-threatening disturbance in the cardiac rate or rhythm, status epilepticus. Most critical illnesses, however, allow sufficient time for careful thinking and appraisal of the problem before making decisions as to the diagnosis and management. Haste in jumping to conclusions can be dangerous. A good physician invariably takes time to think; he or she does not let an emergency ruffle his equanimity or push him into hasty decision-making. “There will be time,........ Time for all the works and days of Hands that lift and drop a question on your plate”\n\nMONITORING THE ILLNESS AND INVESTIGATIONS Monitoring is started simultaneously with the initial clinical appraisal. The ECG tracing, heart rate, rhythm, O2 saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, the O 2 saturation of blood in the superior vena cava (ScVO2) are all monitored.\n\nCh-01.indd 6\n\nIn special instances, the cardiac output, oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption may also need to be monitored. Investigations should include all basic routine tests, blood cultures and culture of other body secretions if necessary, full blood biochemistry, as also baseline values of functions of all organ systems. An arterial blood lactate value is important. Arterial pH and blood gases should always be done. When necessary a screen for common poisons should be asked for. Tests should be repeated as and when necessary. Imaging studies are often crucial in establishing the nature of a critical illness. The final recognition of the nature of a critical illness and the degree of its criticality require both a bedside clinical evaluation as described earlier and an assessment of results of relevant investigations. There are times when the nature of a critical illness cannot be established by bedside clinical evaluation. This is particularly observed when no history is available or when a patient is obtunded without any localizing signs or without any other clue as to the cause of the obtunded state. In such a situation, investigations and appropriate imaging tests may give the answer to the problem. Optimal critical care is the merging of good bedside skills with a judicious use of technology.\n\nCRITICAL CARE WITHOUT WALLS2 It is not often realized that a patient admitted to a ward for a medical problem can worsen and become critically ill. The recognition of this deterioration may come late or not at all and may well be responsible for increased morbidity and mortality. Intensive care units (ICUs) will never have the capacity for all patients who could benefit from being provided with at least some degree of critical care. The concept of ‘critical care without walls’ is that the critical care needs of patients should be provided irrespective of their geographical location within the hospital. For this concept to achieve a modicum of success, the following steps are necessary: 1. Basic critical care skills with special reference to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and management of the airway should be taught to all doctors and head nurses. Training in advanced life support should be compulsory. 2. A ‘physiological monitoring system’ 2,5,6 should be introduced so as to measure important physiological variables—heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, urine output, level of consciousness. Deviation of each of these variables from normal is scored in numbers (1,2,3) depending on the degree of abnormalities observed in each variable. Action (intervention) may be triggered by a single abnormality\n\n25-06-2015 4:11:19 PM\n\nChapter 1: Recognition of Critical Illness\n\nor an aggregate score. The physiological scoring system (PSS) was developed following the recognition that critically ill patients, particularly patients who suffered a cardiac arrest, were noted to have deteriorated over a number of hours before the acute crisis occurred. The PSS helps to track patients who deteriorate and thereby triggers an appropriate response from the doctor, nurses and health workers in charge of the patient. A medical emergency team also called ‘a critical care outreach team’ should be constituted to provide critical care needs to patients in any location within the hospital who are critically ill. This to an extent can redress the comparative lack of skill, manpower or equipment provided in the hospital wards. The system we follow at Breach Candy Hospital is to keep an emergency trolley (fully equipped with equipment and emergency drugs) together with a defibrillator in the nurse’s duty room of every ward in the hospital. A need for help or a sudden emergency triggers an alarm bell to which\n\nCh-01.indd 7\n\n7\n\na medical emergency team headed by a senior registrar of the ICU together with a senior nurse promptly respond.\n\nREFERENCES 1.

The cost of treatment of patients who are not complicated, and whose stay is for short-time is less. While on the other hand, complicated multiorgan dysfunction patients stay for longtime in ICU. So the cost of treatment increases and their survival is not a guarantee. Scoring system in ICU is a standardized way to assess the severity of admitted patients in ICU. It also helps us in the management of the patient, predicting the outcome, resource relocation and research. It also helps the institute in comparative audit, improving its quality program, justification of the expenses done as per the severity of the disease and explaining to policy makers, insurer and relatives. None of the existing scoring system qualifies for these requirements with 100% sensitivity and specificity. They have limitation of application, complexity, availability, accuracy and data interpretation. Though, they are good tools for comparing the problems but most of them are not accurate in predicting the outcome. The general scoring systems like, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE), simplified acute physiology score (SAPS), therapeutic intervention scoring system (TISS), mortality probability model (MPM) predict mortality and outcome by looking into general vital parameters and other predefined parameters; while organ-\n\nCh-02.indd 8\n\nspecific scoring systems like multiple system organ failure (MSOF) score, multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, and logistic organ dysfunction score (LODS) predict disease severity and outcome based on organ dysfunction severity. SOFA is the most widely used organ failure model. I will be discussing the commonly used scoring system and its practical issues. I will mention the direct web-link to the scoring for calculation. Although scoring system is getting upgraded, but as an intensivist we will be looking for a system, which is easily reproducible and can be used for day-to-day progression of disease. It can also adjust as per case severity, age and chronic organ dysfunction and immune state of the patient. Model should also address the heterogeneity of patient care, ICU staffing and expertise availability.\n\nSEVERITY SCORES AIM Describing Clinical Status at Intensive Care Unit Admission This measures illness severity on the basis of assigned points; helps in comparing groups of patients. These scores predict the probability of hospital mortality for a group of similar patients. They are helpful in assessing individual ICU’s performance and for comparison, e.g. APACHE, SAPS, MPM.\n\n25-06-2015 4:11:41 PM\n\nChapter 2: Scoring Systems\n\nDescribing Patient’s Clinical Status Evolution (e.g. SOFA and MODS) Intensive Care Unit Scoring Models (Outcome) Outcome prediction models (Table 1) aim to predict survival or death at hospital discharge; or at 28 days after ICU admission, based on given set of variables evaluated at ICU admission or within 24 hours of ICU admission. The models developed by multicenter databases are representative of the general critically ill-patient population. Change in homeostasis from baseline adversely affects the patient outcome and increases the hospital mortality. This is directly proportional to severity in derangement of physiological and laboratory variables. This is the basic tenet in developing all general outcome scoring systems. First generation: APACHE I: APACHE I was based on 805 patients.1 It had 34 physiologic variables and preadmission health status. Missing values were considered normal. Admission was used for scoring. Since the APACHE I approach to mortality prediction was new at that time, it was not subjected to the currently accepted discrimination and calibration metrics. Second generation: APACHE II: It is the most commonly used outcome prediction model and was based on data collected from 1979 to 1982 in 13 hospitals in North America.2 The model consisted of 12 physiologic measurements, age, previous health status, and ICU admission diagnosis. The 12 physiologic variables were heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, alveolar to arterial oxygen tension gradient, hematocrit, white blood cell count, creatinine, sodium, potassium, pH or bicarbonate, and Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score. Worst value, 24 hours after ICU admission was considered. The total APACHE II scores range from 0 to 71. Postoperative patients and emergency surgery was given additional weight in outcome calculation. SAPS I: SAPS I, data originated from 679 patients admitted to eight ICUs in France.3 The model included age and 13 physiologic variables. The 13 physiologic variables were heart rate, systolic blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate or mechanical ventilation, urine output, blood urea nitrogen, hematocrit, white blood cell count,\n\nTable 1: Intensive care unit scoring table: Four generations of ICU outcome predictive model have been developed so far: 1st generation APACHE I\n\n1\n\n2nd generation 2\n\nAPACHE II SAPS I4 MPM I10\n\n3rd generation 3\n\nAPACHE III SAPS II5 MPM II6\n\n4th generation APACHE IV9 SAPS III MPM III7,8\n\nAbbreviations: APACHE, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation; SAPS, simplified acute physiology score; MPM, mortality probability model.\n\nCh-02.indd 9\n\n9\n\nglucose, potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, and GCS score. The worst physiologic values in the first 24 hours after ICU admission were considered for calculation. MPM I: The MPM I model was created from a small number of easily available variables.4 The development model was derived from data of 755 patients from the ICU of a single medical center. MPM I assigned weights to the predictor variables based on statistical techniques, rather than expert opinions.5 MPM I had two models: MPM0 I, based on data obtained at ICU admission, and MPM24 I, based on data obtained within 24 hours of ICU admission. MPM0 I included seven predictor variables: Age, systolic blood pressure, level of consciousness, type of admission, cancer, infection, and number of organ system failures. The variables included in the MPM24 I were age, type of admission, level of consciousness, infection, inspired oxygen fraction, shock, and number of organ system failures. Third generation: APACHE III: APACHE III originates from 17,440 patients database of 66 hospitals and 200 ICU beds. 6 Variables taken were age, chronic health conditions, acute physiology score, admission diagnosis category, and patients’ location before ICU admission, as a measure of lead-time bias. Seventeen physiologic variables were included in the APACHE III model: Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, GCS, urine output, hematocrit, white blood cell count, glucose, sodium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, bilirubin, arterial pH, arterial oxygenation, and arterial carbon dioxide tension. Worst acute physiological score (APS) during first 24-hours stay was taken for calculation. The chronic health conditions included acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), lymphoma, hepatic failure, metastatic cancer, leukemia or multiple myeloma, cirrhosis, and immunosuppression. If a patient had multiple chronic conditions, the one with the worst score was used. The APACHE III score is the sum of APS, age score and chronic health condition score, and ranges from 0 to 299. Seventyeight major disease categories were assigned weights by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The area under curve (AUC) of APACHE III was 0.90. The overall explanatory power of APACHE III for hospital mortality as measured by R2 was 0.41. Despite its excellent performance and potential for use, APACHE III is not being used commonly due to unavailability of scoring system, as it is personal property of developers and one needs permission and complex calculation equations. SAPS II: SAPS II represents 13,152 patient’s database from 137 ICUs in 12 countries.7 Seventeen variables were entered to create the SAPS II model: 12 physiologic variables, age, types of admission (scheduled surgical, unscheduled surgical, or medical) and three underlying disease variables\n\n25-06-2015 4:11:41 PM\n\n10\n\nSection 1: General Principles\n\n(AIDS, metastatic cancer, and hematologic malignancy). The physiologic variables used the worst values of the first 24 hours in the ICU. Subsequent studies with SAPS II showed good discrimination but poor calibration unless customized. MPM II: The training and development sets of MPM0 II included 12,610 and 6,514 patients, respectively, from 12 countries.8 Fifteen variables were used in the admission model, MPM0 II: Physiology (coma or stupor, heart rate, systolic blood pressure), chronic diagnosis (chronic renal insufficiency, cirrhosis, metastatic cancer), acute diagnosis (acute renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmia, cerebrovascular accident, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial mass effect), and other (age, cardiopulmonary resuscitation before ICU admission, medical or unscheduled surgery admission, mechanical ventilation). The 13 variables entered in the 24-hour model, MPM24 II: Variables at admission (age, cirrhosis, intracranial mass effect, metastatic cancer, and medical or unscheduled surgery admission) and at 24hour assessments (coma or stupor, creatinine, confirmed infection, mechanical ventilation, arterial oxygen tension, prothrombin time, urine output, and use of vasoactive drugs). The MPM24 II model was developed on data from 10,357 patients still in the ICU at 24 hours. The AUC and calibration of severity and organ failure assessment in adult ICU 645 MPM0 II and MPM24 II were good. Wellperforming models based on data collected at 48 hours, MPM48 II, and 72 hours of ICU admission, MPM72 II, have been subsequently developed for predicting mortality.9 Fourth generation: All the mortality prediction models developed so far have good capacity to identify at risk population but poor predictability. The reasons are mix and difficult cases, ICU care variability, availability of expertise and facilities, and treatment availability. Current and new generation of scoring system needs to consider these variables when formulating the outcome prediction models. APACHE IV: APACHE IV was developed from data collected on 110,558 patients in 104 ICUs of 45 nonrandomly selected hospitals in the United States.10 Exclusion criteria include age under 16 years, ICU length of stay less than 4 hours or more than 365 days, burn, transfer from another ICU, and admission after transplant (except kidney and liver). The study patients were randomly split into development (60%) and validation (40%) subsets. Among the fourth-generation models are the following: •• APACHE IV: This included the largest number of variables. The APS variables and the seven chronic conditions of APACHE IV were the same as those of APACHE III.11 The number of ICU admission diagnostic categories was increased from 78 in APACHE III to 116. The APS of APACHE IV is worst values obtained within 24 hours of ICU admission and ranges from 0 to 252. Unlike\n\nCh-02.indd 10\n\nAPACHE III, age, APS, and chronic health were each given a separate coefficient to calculate the probability of death in APACHE IV. The discrimination of APACHE IV was very good with good calibration. APACHE IV used a different data set for calculating the probability of death of patients admitted to the ICU following coronary artery bypass graft. For patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction, a variable for thrombolysis therapy was added. The explanatory powers of the APACHE IV model were due to acute physiology (65.6%), age (9.4%), chronic health conditions (5.0%), admission variables (2.9%), ICU admission diagnosis (16.5%), and mechanical ventilation (0.8%). •• SAPS III: SAPS III data is extrapolated from 16,784 patients in 303 ICUs.12 For cross validation, the modelbuilding process was run five times, using 80% of randomly selected data for development and the remaining 20% for validation. The model was based on data obtained within 1 hour of a patient’s admission to the ICU. The explanatory powers of the SAPS III model were mostly attributable to the patients’ characteristics before ICU admission (50.0%) and the circumstances of ICU admission (22.5%) and less dependent on the physiological abnormalities at ICU admission (27.5%). •• MPM0 III: MPM0 III was developed from data of patients from the United States. 13 The study patients were randomly split into development (60%) and validation (40%) subsets. Only five acute diagnosis and three physiologic variables were included in the model. MPM0 III was based on data obtained within 1 hour of ICU admission. MPM is the only fourth-generation model that includes ‘‘do-not-resuscitate’’ status as a predictor variable. The discrimination of MPM0 III was very good with good calibration.\n\nOrgan Failure Models Multiorgan failure is the cause for most deaths in ICU. After ICU admission, improvement or deterioration in organ function decides patient outcome. Treatment plan is to support failing organ, treat the cause and keep the patient alive till he recovers or dies. Organ failure model has been developed to keep track on daily patient progress. Its variables include six organs system, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hematological, hepatic and central nervous system. Gastrointestinal and metabolic or endocrine system is not included in scoring due to complex and subjective evaluation. Organ failure models describe complication but do not predict mortality.\n\nOrgan Dysfunction Models Organ failure is a process.14,15 The three currently used main organ failure scoring systems are MODS, SOFA,\n\n25-06-2015 4:11:41 PM\n\nChapter 2: Scoring Systems\n\nand LODS.16 Most of the variables are easily available and usually obtained regularly in the critically ill patients (Table 2). SOFA and MODS assign scores ranging from 0 to 4, based on severity. LODS assigns scores to each organ based on their impacts on mortality, not on arbitrarily selected cut points. MODS differ from LODS and SOFA by its use of pressure-adjusted heart rate (PAR) to measure cardiovascular dysfunction. PAR is calculated as central venous pressure multiplied by heart rate or mean blood pressure. Assessment of cardiovascular function using the MODS criteria is not possible in patients without central venous catheters. When analyzing trends in the daily SOFA score (Table 3) during the first 96 hours, regardless of the initial score, the mortality rate was at least 50% when the score increased, 27–35% when it remained unchanged, and less than 27% when it decreased.17\n\nUSE of ORGAN FAILURE SCORING Because the organ dysfunction measures may be obtained daily, they give a complete understanding of the patient’s entire ICU course as opposed to just the initial 24-hour period. The trend in the daily organ failure scores can be used to demonstrate the effects of various therapeutic interventions in clinical practice as well as clinical trials.\n\nTable 2: Variables of organ failure scores Organ\n\nVariable\n\nMODS12\n\nSOFA13\n\nLODS14\n\nRespiratory\n\nPaO2/FiO2\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nCardiovascular\n\nMean arterial pressure\n\nYes\n\nSystolic blood pressure\n\nYes\n\nHeart rate PAR\n\nHepatic\n\nYes Yes\n\nDopamine\n\nYes\n\nDobutamine\n\nYes\n\nEpinephrine\n\nYes\n\nNorepinephrine\n\nYes\n\nBilirubin\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nProthrombin time Renal\n\nCreatinine\n\nYes Yes\n\nYes\n\nBlood urea nitrogen Platelets\n\nYes Yes\n\nWBCs CNS\n\nGCS\n\nYes Yes\n\nUrine output Hematological\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nAbbreviations: CNS, central nervous system; LODS, logistic organ dysfunction system; MODS, multiple organ dysfunction score; MV, mechanical ventilation; PAR, pressure-adjusted heart rate; SOFA, sequential organ failure assessment; WBC, white blood cells.\n\nCh-02.indd 11\n\n11\n\nDaily scores also help to capture the intensity of resource use and may help us gain a better understanding of what truly ICU-acquired organ dysfunction is.\n\nOTHER ICU SCORING SYSTEMS for DAY-TO-DAY USE Scoring system like therapeutic intervention scoring system (TISS), trauma injury severity score (TRISS), GCS and Ramsay sedation score are useful in respective clinical scenario, if applied properly. •• TISS: This system is based on assumption that regardless of the diagnosis, therapeutic intervention is provided based on physiological derangement and this, also indicates severity of illness. For TISS to be used as a scoring system, hospital must have all the intervention listed in score16 and they should be used for justifiable reason and not for income. •• The TISS score is being used for determining the severity of illness, calculating nurse to patient ratio, ICU and resource utilization, knowing about number of ICU beds. •• TRISS: This score is useful for the study of survival or death outcome in trauma patients.19 It works as a control for the case mix differences in the assessment of trauma outcomes. TRISS is computed using admission values of the revised trauma score, the injury severity score, based on final diagnosis, patient age and type of injury (blunt or penetrating). •• GCS: The GCS was developed to predict the severity of head injury and its outcome.20 Later on, it is being used to assess the day-to-day progression of all types of brain dysfunction; traumatic or nontraumatic. When combined with brainstem dysfunction signs, its predictive power increases. Due to its usefulness, it has been included in all the general outcome predictive model. While assessing the GCS, we need to keep in mind its limitation. It does not correlate well in predicting primary CNS dysfunction, if patient is sedated, narcosed, paralyzed, hypotensive, hyp"
