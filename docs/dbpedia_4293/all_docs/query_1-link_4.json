        "text": "The Catalan territories experienced a very significant territorial expansion and economic growth in the twelfth century. New institutions responded to these changes and boosted them. This can be seen in the redefinition of county power, the beginnings of urban governance and the introduction of new ecclesiastical organizations. In the early twelfth century, the Catalan counties were a mosaic of political powers while by the end of the century they were to some extent subject to the hegemony of the County of Barcelona. Ramon Berenguer IV reinforced his leadership thanks to his union with the heiress to the kingdom of Aragon. Additionally, he became preeminent among other regional powers with the conquest and administration of the Southern lands. From mid-century, signs of population and economic growth were evident. As with the political situation, Barcelona lead the rise in commerce, although other towns prospered as regional centres. Social and economic developments called for a new organization of powers, in order to guarantee peace, and favour commerce and military efficiency. Resumen: Los territorios catalanes experimentaron una trascendente expansión territorial y crecimiento económico en el siglo XII. Nuevas instituciones y nuevas fórmulas de gobierno respondían e impulsaron dichas transformaciones. Se produjo la redefinición del poder condal, los inicios del gobierno urbano y la introducción de nuevas organizaciones eclesiásticas. A inicios del siglo XII, los condados catalanes configuraban un mosaico de poderes políticos mientras que a finales de siglo estaban sujetos a cierta hegemonía del condado de Barcelona, cuyo titular era el rey de Aragón. Ramón Berenguer IV, reforzó su liderazgo gracias a su unión con la heredera del reino de Aragón. Además el conde alcanzó su preeminencia frente a otros poderes regionales gracias a la conquista y a la administración de las tierras meridionales desde mediados de siglo. Desde entonces los signos del crecimiento poblacional y económico se hicieron evidentes en la proliferación de villas, el crecimiento de las ciudades, y de la actividad artesanal, agraria y mercantil. De forma pareja a la situación política, Barcelona fue principal y predominante en el despliegue mercantil, aunque otros núcleos urbanos prosperaron como centros regionales. Las novedades sociales y económicas reclamaron una nueva ordenación de los poderes, que garantizaban la paz, favorecieran la viabilidad comercial y la eficacia militar.\n\nFeudal wars and wars of conquest were characteristic conflicts in Catalonia in the 12 th century and led to a consolidation of the aristocratic military and political leaders. Among these, the highest power was the count or the king, who extended his domination and led the process of expansion through such novel formulae as pacification, the formation of armies and pacts with foreign leaders. The counts and the king used military agents from outside the regional aristocratic interests, implemented new military policies and found ideological or legislative resources to support their pre-eminence in military deployment. The rise of the cities, the towns and the defence or occupation of the conquered frontiers contributed to the reformulation of the military system, which broke the almost exclusive hold of the noble families on military activity. However, the members of the latter ruled and fought in regional settings, focussing their military activity on the defending and acquiring patrimony, as well as on establishing their jurisdiction. The concepts of heritagisation, dominating and fighting were assimilated into a single reality, and even became interchangeable. Meanwhile, conquests guided by providence placed the \" inevitability \" of the conquest, acquisition or \" liberation \" of al-Andalus on another plane.\n\nFor the last decade I have been using the frontier societies of the tenth- and early-eleventh-century area that would become Catalonia as a place to discover social networks in charter evidence in order to develop a vision of how medieval power worked at a local level when required to move beyond force. This work has recently resulted in my Royal Historical Society monograph, Rulers and Ruled, and in this paper I summarised that work into points for discussion and indicated where I have since taken the enquiry, towards the direction of ideological self-representation by the rulers of the area, and where I hope to go with it next.\n\nIn this article, I aim to illustrate the international political situation of Catalonia in the middle and second half of the tenth century. Contrary to received opinion, I argue that while Catalonia maintained a friendly relationship with the Frankish kingdom (at least until 968), it simultaneously moved politically closer to al- Andalus and, in the third quarter of the tenth century, was very close to becoming an Andalusī client state. To make this argument, I first analyse the sources related to Catalan diplomatic missions to the Frankish kingdom. Second, I list all the Catalan embassies to Cordova from 940 to 974. Finally, I describe the sudden political change caused by the accession of the tyrant Almanzor in al-Andalus (978). In fact, I show that when Almanzor reopened hostilities against the Christian realms of northern Spain, Catalonia found itself politically isolated and was forced to seek reconciliation with the Frankish kingdom.\n\nGeislingen a. d. Steige (Germany) Homo Homini Lupus? - Between Conflict and Cooperation-Anthropology takes all aspects of the human condition into consideration while studying the entire, immensely broad spectrum of human behaviour. Against the backdrop of the current global political situation, this is often reduced to two strategies: conflict and cooperation. Acting together and against each other are the extremes of a highly variable continuum of behaviour. Both strategies are deeply rooted in human evolution and adaptation. But there is also a wide scope of action, allowing us to adequately deal with conflicts and to achieve common goals in cooperation. Reflecting about evolutionary adaptations and the complexity of behaviour and methods should help to improve our coexistence. The 12th international meeting of the Society of Anthropology picks up this topic. Abstract: While in most regions of the former Carolingian Empire from the 10th to the 12th Century written documentation is sparse, Medieval Catalonia surprises with a large amount of legal source material. In Catalonia, the borderland region to Islam, the independent counts struggle for power. With no centralized power and the uprising counts of Barcelona ahead in that race, this legal documentary shows those political networks from different angles. Agreements, marriage policies, oaths of loyalty, complex interchange of hostages and castles, allow a glimpse into this society and the values of its dominating warrior class. The importance of the written word since late antiquity did not fade in Catalonia thus allowing us a unique insight into processes that in other parts of Europe might have been happened orally and therefore only left an indirect trace in art or narrative sources. At first glance, the model of a lack of centralized power and a subsequent struggle, to fill that gap seemed logical. However since the millennium, some scholars question this static model of anarchy and take a more anthropological approach to analyse the sources. The establishment of new norms that allow to castigate or punish transgressors, for instance, through exclusion by excommunication, also finds means to reintegrate those wrongdoers into society. That shows that this community was able to cope with violence and establish an internal equilibrium. The winner was not always the strongest but the one that played by the rule in a time when conflict and struggle were seen as a law of nature and peace as the ultimate goal. The presentation aims to outline the different types of sources and give an insight into the political world of the Catalan Counties."
