The local Lilly Pilly at Lord Howe is known as the Scalybark. Recently it has been placed in the "waste basket taxon" of Syzygium. Taxonomy of the Myrtle family is difficult and contentious. This plant is now known as Syzygium fullagarii. Botanists will argue until blue in the face between the differences of Acmena, Syzygium, Eugenia, Backhousia, Waterhousea, Choricarpia and Cleistocalyx. Wars have been started over lesser disagreements. I wish they'd put them all into Syzygium and be done with it!
