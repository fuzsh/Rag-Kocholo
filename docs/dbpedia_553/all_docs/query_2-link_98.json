        "text": "The floristics of the montane bogs in east-flowing catchments of northern New England, north-eastern New South Wales (lat 28° 47’–31° 25’ S; long 151° 50’–152° 30’ E), are described from 62 full floristic survey sites (20 x 20 m in area). Eight vegetation communities are based on flexible UPGMA analysis of cover-abundance scores of vascular plant taxa. Shrub species make up 26% of the flora and herb species 69%, with the remaining taxa trees, climbers or vines. Shrub species were of little diagnostic value, as a few common dominants were shared across most communities. The herbaceous layer was found to be of better circumscriptive value. Communities described (based on dominant herbaceous species) are: (1) Themeda australis – Gonocarpus micranthus, (2) Baumea articulata – Baloskion stenocoleum, (3) Lepidosperma limicola – Baloskion stenocoleum, (4) Baloskion fimbriatum – Lomandra longifolia, (5) Lepyrodia scariosa – Blandfordia grandiflora, (6) Lepidosperma gunnii – Lepidosperma scariosa, (7) Baloskion stenocoleum – Empodisma minus, (8) Lepidosperma limicola – Xyris operculata. The mean annual moisture index was found to account for 26% of the variation in species density. These montane bog systems are some of the richest in Australia, with a high number of rare and restricted taxa. They are vulnerable to both present landuse practices and future changes in climate, are restricted in area, and need further conservation efforts to ensure their long-term survival.\n\nIn the first week of July 2018, the Floodplain Meadows Partnership (FMP) held its annual steering group meeting with field excursions on the Outer Hebrides. The aim of the field part of our meeting was to familiarise ourselves with wet meadows (including those on machair) of the Uists and Benbecula, and compare their composition and ecology with related habitats further south in the UK. However, a chance for us to explore the other habitats of these islands was too good an opportunity to miss. Hence five of us arrived on the islands a few days before the main group and roamed more extensively, looking at a wide range of habitats in addition to meadows. The lead author’s role in this botanical journal was to note incidental observations made in addition to the formal study of the meadows. Hilary Wallace directed the quadrat recording in wet meadows, and the overall programme of work was coordinated by David Gowing and Emma Rothero of the Open University. Even during the FMP field exc...\n\nThese explanatory notes provide additional detail about the standard methods for sampling, describing, classifying and mapping vegetation in Australia that are published by Hnatiuk, Thackway and Walker (2009), referred to here as the ‘Field Handbook’. The methods have been tested extensively in the field and have a wide range of applications in Australia and elsewhere. As much as possible, they accord with the standards of the National Vegetation Information System (NVIS), but we acknowledge that there are significant new items that will need to be incorporated into the next versions of NVIS. This volume updates an earlier vegetation classification (Walker and Hopkins 1990) to meet the current demands of users operating at a wide range of scales and to take advantage of an improved understanding of floristic and structural characteristics of vegetation and developments in remote sensing and geo-location. It is timely in that it provides a single unified system for classifying vegetation across whole landscapes irrespective of whether they support native, exotic or mixtures of these vegetation types.\n\nAnimals have not only accompanied us throughout our natural history, but also throughout our cultural one. Ever since our first encounters in the wild, until today, the sight of a creature of the size and posture of a stag, has never left us indifferent, no matter how anchored we might be in the magical thinking of our ancestors, or in the scientific thinking of the present. We are therefore not surprised by its rich imagery, wherever we've lived along it over time, from the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe, to North America. As expected, such an already imposing animal will exceed its biological limits in myth and take on fantastic dimensions. It is certainly the case of the species under discussion, one that occupies a special place in the mythology of the Romanians and, as we will see, of the neighboring peoples. Archaeological findings indicate we also had traces of a symbolic thought towards the deer dating back to prehistory here. The present article proposes a brief review of the stag related myths, without being exhaustive, starting with the representations of the peoples of the steppes, up to Western medieval bestiaries and encyclopedias. In our country, the Physiologous brings Christian symbolism and overimposes it over an already rich mythos related to cervids. By that time, there were circulating too, a series of animal legends, tales, together with the soltitial carols of clearly pre-Christian origin, that seem to preserve a form of ritual report towards this animal, possibly from an ancient background of a shamanic or totemic nature. After Christianization, we were far enough away from both Rome and Constantinople that these old rites survived hundreds of years after their decline in the West, right into modern times. We have recovered marginalia illustrating men dressed as stags and witness accounts from early Church members complaining of Cervulum facere, a fertiliy-related solstitial dance popular in Medieval Western Europe, very similar to what we still have today. From this point of view, the Carpathian area proved particularly conservative as an ethnological reservoir. The secular carols along with the New Year processions (Colinda Cerbului) seem to indicate an extinct cult of a cervimorphic entity, which later turned into a masquerade, into a dance, and whose vague memory remained encoded in the folk tradition."
