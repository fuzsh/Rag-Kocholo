        "text": "AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL BOTANIC GARDENS\n\nAnnual Report 1986-1987\n\nThe functions of the Australian National Botanic Gardens (ANBG) are to collect, study and display a national collection of living and herbarium specimens of Australian native plants and related species for scientific research, education, conservation and public enjoyment.\n\nThe Gardens occupy 90 ha on the slopes of Black Mountain in Canberra, with an 80 ha annexe in the Jervis Bay Territory on Australia’s eastern coast. The Gardens were officially opened in 1970 and now contain about 6 000 species of living plants. There were 368 000 visitors to the Gardens in Canberra in 1986-87 and about 20 000 to the Jervis Bay Annexe.\n\nADMINISTRATION AND POLICY\n\nAdvisory Committee\n\nThe Minister for Arts, Heritage and Environment, the Hon Barry Cohen announced the membership of the ANBG Advisory Committee on\n\n13 November 1986.\n\nThe Committee was established to advise him on matters concerning the roles and functions of the ANBG in Canberra and at the Jervis Bay Annexe. The first meeting of the Committee was held in Canberra on the same day. The membership is listed in Appendix 1.\n\nOn 11 arid 12 February the Advisory Committee visited the Annexe to inspect the site, familiarise themselves with the current layout and to consider its future development\n\nThe third meeting for the year was held in Canberra on 4 May. Significant matters considered by the Committee during the year included:\n\nthe impact on the ANBG if the proposed John Dedman Parkway is constructed adjacent to the Gardens;\n\nthe need for legislation for the Gardens\n\nthe establishment of Friends of the ANBG and volunteer groups.\n\nFinance\n\nThe Gardens was allocated $1 040 000 for on-going operational expenditure excluding wages and salaries and $110 000 for the purchase of plant and equipment.\n\nAn amount of $640 000 was provided in the Capital Works program:\n\nMinor New Works $140 000\n\nMajor New Works $500 000\n\nEmployment\n\nThe Gardens has an Average Staffing Level allocation of 87 comprising:\n\nProfessional staff 9\n\nTechnical staff 27\n\nAdministrative, clerical and keyboard staff 11\n\nExempt employees, gardening and trades 40\n\nDuring the year 26 apprentices worked at the Gardens for periods of one or two months as part of the Department of Territories’ Land Management Branch Apprenticeship Scheme. Ms lnez Mahony, a participant in the Government’s Work Experience Trainee Program, gained practical experience at the Gardens for 17 weeks.\n\nStaff at 30 June are listed it Appendix 2.\n\nCommunity Employmenr Program (CEP)\n\nOne CEP Project, ‘Path Construction and Garden Bed Development’ continued from the previous year and was completed in January 1987. It incorporated a display of commercially available Australian native cultivars and employed seven people at the Jervis Bay Annexe.\n\nThe Gardens were not eligible to apply for CEP grants in 1986-87\n\nOccupational Health and Safety (OHS)\n\nThe Occupational Health and Safety Committee provided a forum for joint consultation between management and staff on a wide range of health and safety matters relating to the working environment at the Gardens.\n\nThe OHS policies and programs developed throughout the year have focused on:\n\n— an OHS Policy;\n\n— a policy on smoke-free working environments;\n\na program to improve the system of first aid officers and services;\n\n— a program of safety inspections for all sections of the Gardens.\n\nOthers matters considered by the Committee included the development of safety training courses for chainsaw use and use of 4WD vehicles; the use of vehicles and speed control within the Gardens and the storage of fuel. Liaison was maintained with the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment OHS Committee.\n\nIndustrial Democracy\n\nA significant input of time and resources was devoted to determining the mechanism for implementing representational democracy at the Gardens. Two broad options were available:\n\n— to establish a separate ANBG consultative committee consisting of representatives of unions and management; or\n\n— to expand the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment Council to include an ANBG management representative and two representatives of unions not currently covered.\n\nDiscussions were held with the ANBG staff, the staff associations, the Department and the Public Service Board. Subject to the agreement of the Departmental Council, the option to be implemented will be to expand that Council. This will be undertaken within the first few months of 1987-88.\n\nParticipative democracy in the Gardens is covered by a system of monthly meetings which provide the opportunity for each employee to participate in discussion of policy, planning and management issues. An OHS Committee, a fortnightly Newsletter and a monthly Staff Awareness Program also contribute to the participative component.\n\nCounter-Disaster Planning\n\nThe Minister, the Hon Barry Cohen, MP, requested each national collecting institution to prepare a counter-disaster plan. A Counter- Disaster Management Planning Group was set up by the Advisory Committee on National Collections to oversee this. The Gardens has representation on this group.\n\nWork commenced on drawing up a counter-disaster plan for the Gardens on the basis that the greatest threat to the national collection is fire. Capacity to combat this threat has been improved over the past two years including the up-grading of the water supply and access roads for fire fighting. Work commenced on the installation of a perimeter drenching sprinkler system which will be used to saturate a 50 m wide strip in the event of a bush fire approaching the Gardens from the adjacent reserve.\n\nMuseum Review\n\nThe Gardens participated in the wide ranging Review of Commonwealth Involvement in the Development of Museums and Similar Collecting and\n\nExhibiting Institutions conducted jointly by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment and the Department of Finance.\n\nThe review was established by Government to identify any duplication and scope for economies amongst institutions, both existing and proposed, and to examine ways to limit the call on the Commonwealth to meet recurrent funding of existing and proposed institutions.\n\nThe Museum Review Working Party held discussions with senior management of the Gardens on the terms of reference as they applied to this and other botanic gardens.\n\nNATIONAL COLLECTIONS\n\nThe National Collections Section aims to acquire, identify, manage and preserve the national collections of living and dried herbarium specimens of Australian and related plants. The Section consists of three subsections. The Living Collections Subsection is responsible for the collection, maintenance and storage of plants held in the nursery and in the open ground in Canberra and at Jervis Bay Annexe, and for the Seed Store. The Herbarium Subsection is responsible for the collection, identification and storage of dried plant specimens. The Development Subsection is responsible for the co-ordination of planning and construction of major new works and redevelopment of planting areas in the Gardens. This Subsection is also responsible for ADP and the Gardens’ involvement in major overseas horticultural expositions.\n\nLiving Collections\n\nThe Living Collections staff maintain a collection of about 75 000 plants representing about 6 000 species in Canberra and at the Jervis Bay\n\nAnnexe. Plants are grown under a number of different conditions:\n\nNo. of Specimens\n\nNo. of taxa\n\nOpen Ground\n\n– Canberra\n\n58 000\n\n3 500\n\n– Jervis Bay\n\n11900\n\n1 850\n\nUnder Glass\n\n4 700\n\n1 750\n\nPermanent Pots\n\n2 400\n\n1 200\n\nDuring 1986—87 an Endangered Species Collection was established. This collection provides material for research and education at the ANBG and for other Australian and overseas institutions, and could help reduce the pressure on wild populations. To establish this collection assistance was provided by the Herbarium and Research Section to refine procedures for the collection, propagation and cultivation of endangered plants. Using these procedures 20 different species were collected from the wild. During field surveys by the Gardens, additional populations of three of these species were found. These discoveries led to the conservation status of these species being changed from endangered to vulnerable.\n\nThese species are:\n\nAcacia pubescens\n\nPomaderris brunnea\n\nProstanthra stricta\n\nLocalities of good populations of two other species are now known:\n\nGrevillea iaspicula\n\nSwainsona recta.\n\nFurther work is being done by Living Collections in the area of endangered species with funding provided by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service. The two projects are:\n\na survey of the rare and threatened Australian native plant species in cultivation in Australia; and\n\nassessment of nursery practices for the propagation of endangered Norfolk Island plants.\n\nWithin the Gardens, several areas of plantings were upgraded. These included the redesign of an area to display local grassland and woodland plants and a gully area for wet temperate forest plantings.\n\nIn July 1986, the Seed Store was transferred to the Nursery and a coolroom was installed allowing all seed to be housed at about 4°C. Ms Helen Thompson was employed for six months to collect and clean seed. She undertook a number of one day trips collecting seed in the local area.\n\nDuring the year, plant material was donated to the Gardens by twenty individuals and organisations. Of these the most prominent were Mr R Burns of Tasmania, Mr L Bird of Queensland, the Association of Societies for Growing Australian Plants (ASGAP) Grevillea Study Group, the ASGAP Prostanthera Study Group and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. Plant material was also donated to a number of organisations by the ANBG. These included:\n\nRubus cuttings to the National Clonal Germplasm Repository in the United States;\n\nconifer cuttings to the University of Marseilles in France;\n\nBoronia megastigma to the Zurich University;\n\nGrevillea cuttings to the Parks and Recreation Department in Hobart; _cuttings for teaching purposes to the Australian National University and the Ryde School of Horticulture;\n\ncuttings to the Keith Turnbull Research Institute; and\n\nplant materials to the ASGAP Daisy Study Group and the Beaufortia and Allied Genera Study Group\n\nDuring the year, the Minister approved the establishment of a committee representing government and the nursery industry to advise the Director on aspects of the selection and distribution of plants from the National Collection to the nursery trade under the Native Plant Release Program.\n\nAdvice on both the propagation and cultivation of Australian plants was provided to many Australian and overseas organisations.\n\nJervis Bay Annexe\n\nThe Jervis Bay Annexe of the ANBG is situated on the New South Wales south coast. The Annexe is about 80 ha in area and has a staff of six. The Annexe was originally established to enable the cultivation of frost tender plants under more favourable conditions than those which prevail in Canberra. While this function continues it is being complemented by an increasing commitment to the cultivation of regional and endangered flora. The first plantings of endangered species have taken place in the trial plots constructed as part of a CEP project and will continue as the plants become available. The plots are a transitional phase for endangered plants prior to incorporation in the collection proper.\n\nPublic interest in the Annexe is indicated by the greater number of group tours and family group visits. There is a high incidence of repeat visits. The Annexe has been open on the first Sunday of each month and on all public holidays in 1987.\n\nIn response to the growth in public interest, increasing emphasis is being placed on development and plantings adjacent to the major pedestrian routes\n\nA CEP project ‘Path Construction and Garden Bed Development’, which incorporates a large display of commercially available Australian native cultivars, was completed in January 1987. Other activities in the Annexe included work experience for secondary students from Nowra High School, field studies on ecology by students from the Canberra College of Advanced Education and postgraduate studies on the Long Neck Tortoise population in Lake McKenzie.\n\nMinor new works projects undertaken were:\n\nan upgrade of the irrigation and water storage facility;\n\nstage 1 of the Nursery development;\n\nthe provision of underground fuel storage.\n\nCommunications between the Annexe and the Gardens in Canberra were improved with the installation of a facsimile machine in 1986.\n\nHerbarium\n\nThe Herbarium collection contains both vascular and non-vascular (cryptogamic) plants, and there is an active exchange of replicate specimens and associated data with kindred institutions around the world.\n\nNumber of herbarium specimens 185 300\n\nVascular Plant specimens in collection 122 400\n\ncollected in 1986—87 1820\n\nreplicate specimens sent 1500\n\nreplicate specimens received 660\n\nNon-vascular plant specimens in collection 62 900\n\ncollected in 1986—87 1 590\n\nreplicate specimens sent 7 580\n\nreplicate specimens received 2 980\n\nProfessional visitors from the local area, interstate and overseas made use of the collection during the year. In addition 57 loans, comprising 3 252 specimens in total, were sent to kindred institutions for use by specialists either preparing manuscripts for floras or revising groups. There were 38 loans comprising 1 601 specimens received from other institutions for study by the Gardens’ botanists.\n\nWork towards the publication of the Catalogue of the Mosses of Australia and its External Territories in collaboration with the Bureau of Flora and Fauna is almost complete and publication is expected in 1987-88.\n\nProduction of typed labels for the collection has increased, allowing the filing of large numbers of specimens in the main collection and the addition of data to specimens in the Public Access Herbarium\n\nA member of staff attended the Plant Taxonomy Workshop organised by the Council of Heads of Australian Herbaria in Brisbane in mid- June, 1986.\n\nHerbarium staff have assisted other organisations with a number of projects. These included:\n\nidentification and listing of native plants in the Murrumbidgee River Corridor for the Parks and Conservation Branch, Department of Territories;\n\nprovision of information for the Rural and Provincial Affairs Book and for Landsearch—Directory of Commonwealth Land-Related Data and botanical data for a list of New South Wales south coast flora;\n\ndata of collections of some fern, cycad and gymnosperm collections sent to Professor D K Walker, Humboldt State University, California, USA, as an aid to planning field work in Australia;\n\ntraining and educational assistance in the form of talks for groups of tertiary students, a 6 week period of work experience (as a course requirement) for a tertiary horticulture student, and two days’ experience in the Herbarium for a visiting Thai horticulturist;\n\nassistance to a visiting researcher from CSIRO Division of Soils, involving the identification of cryptogam fragments in soil samples and from slides prepared from soil samples;\n\nfurther assistance in the identification of cryptogams for an ecological study of vegetation plots of varying sizes in clear- felled areas at Wog Wog River, south of Bombala NSW, being carried out by CSIRO, Division of Water and Land Resources.\n\nDevelopment\n\nMajor developments within the Gardens have proceeded in accordance with the Australian National Botanic Gardens Development Plan prepared and adopted in 1985.\n\nProjects that commenced in the previous year and were completed this year are:\n\nimprovements to the internal fire access road;\n\nthe final stage of a two-part plan to upgrade the water supply within the Gardens.\n\nWork commenced this year included:\n\ninstallation of a perimeter drenching sprinkler system;\n\nupstream work to protect the Nursery from excessive stormwater;\n\ndesign brief for a proposed Trades and Services Centre;\n\ndesign brief for a proposed Orchid Display House\n\nSome redevelopments have commenced, including:\n\npreliminary design work for the re-development of the area known as the ‘Hawkesbury Sandstone Section’;\n\ndesigning and replanting a section of the Jervis Bay Annexe for Proteaceae and Rdfaceae.\n\nFurther assistance has been given to:\n\nthe Yass River Revegetation Committee;\n\nthe Ginninderra Community Council on plantings for Ginninderra Creek.\n\nMr Geoff Butler, Development Officer, visited the United Kingdom in May, to prepare a feasibility study on an Australian exhibit at the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988. He also visited the Chelsea Flower Show at the invitation of the Royal Horticultural Society to discuss the requirements for Australia to exhibit in 1988.\n\nData Collection\n\nThe portion of the Gardens’ databases that is automated is held on the Department of Territories mainframe computer. New terminals were\n\ninstalled at the Gardens as the data was transferred to the new mainframe\n\nThe data on te horticultural database is being checked. This information will be used in the future to better manage the living collection, and to provide horticultural information to the public. Data related to the Gardens’ photographic collection continued to be added to the automated system.\n\nFurther reports were produced this year, enabling better monitoring of plants in the living collection. One indicates when a species becomes low in number, so that re-propagation can take place.\n\nMr Keith Goddard, a Computer Systems Officer joined the staff for six months to carry out an assessment of the Gardens’ data in preparation for the Gardens having its own computer system.\n\nNational Collections Fieldwork\n\nMr Arthur Court travelled to Tasmania in November 1986 to gather information to prepare advice for the Commonwealth Government on the effects of logging on the forest flora in the Jacky’s Marsh area of north-central Tasmania.\n\nA three week field trip to north-eastern New South Wales and southeastern Queensland in December 1986 yielded material of rare and endangered species and increased the collection, both living and herbarium, of rainforest species. Endangered plants collected included:\n\nAcronychia littoralis, Atalaya multiflora, Boronia keysii, Choricarpia subargenta, Diploglottis cam pbellii, Fontainea oraria, Planchonella eerwah, Randia moorei, Syzygium moorei, Uromyrtus australis, Xanthostemon oppositifolius.\n\nShorter trips of one or a few days duration were undertaken to collect particular plants or plant groups including:\n\nLocation\n\nMain Species Sought\n\nWee Jasper, NSW\n\nGrevillea iaspicula\n\nLake Burrinjuck, NSW\n\nGrevillea iaspicula\n\nSydney Region, NSW\n\nAcacia pubescens, Syzygium paniculatum, Eucalyptus camfieldii, Haloragodendron lucasii, Pimelea spicata, Pomaderris brunnea\n\nNowra Region, NSW\n\nrainforest species\n\nIlford Region, NSW\n\nProstanthera stricta\n\nJervis Bay NSW\n\nSyzygium paniculatum\n\nBlue Range ACT\n\nwet gully species\n\nErrinundra Plateau, VIC\n\nUlota spp., Papillaria spp. and other rare cryptograms\n\nPUBLIC PROGRAMS\n\nThe objective of the Public Programs Section is to provide opportunities for people of all ages and backgrounds to learn about and enjoy Australian and related plants through appropriate education, recreation and interpretation programs.\n\nDuring the year a review of the Public Programs Section was initiated. The review was still in progress at the end of the year.\n\nThe three subsection heads, Education, Therapeutic Horticulture and Visitor Services, worked to the Director pending the outcome of this review.\n\nEducation\n\nThe national collection of Australian native plants in the Gardens is unique as an educational resource in plant biology and related subjects.\n\nEducation Service programs based on the collections were presented to community groups, teachers and teaching ancillary staff, tertiary education students and student groups from primary to tertiary level.\n\nMrs Sandra Farley was recruited to the position of Teacher Band 1 in January 1987 for a period of one year on temporary transfer within the Commonwealth Teaching Service, pending a review of the three teaching positions at the Gardens. Mrs Jan Dean was appointed to the position of Education Assistant on a permanent basis in December 1986.\n\nIn September 1986, a series of five community education programs was conducted as a celebration of wattle, the national flower. Entitled ‘Springtime is Wattle Time’ the program provided practical experience in the propagation of wattles followed by walks through the Gardens’ wattle sections.\n\nAlmost two thousand pre-school and primary school children entered the competition ‘A for Acacia’ also held in September. Individual and group entries were received from primary children in art, craft, creative writing and science and from pre-school children in a special age category. All entries were displayed in the Public Programs Building and each entrant was awarded a certificate and embroidered badge featuring Aacia pycnantha, Australia’s floral emblem. Prizes in each category were presented by Mr Pat Galvin, Secretary of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment and his wife, Dr Lenore Manderson, before a large gathering in an outdoor ceremony at the Gardens.\n\nSelected entries in the ‘A for Acacia’ competition were displayed in the Belconnen Branch of the Canberra Library Service as part of Australian\n\nScience in Schools Week.\n\nGeneral in-service programs for teachers included a series related to the ‘A for Acacia’ program and two based on the display ‘Eaten Alive!’ and the associated education materials.\n\nFormal evaluation of Education Service programs continued with a high level of response from visiting teachers. There was strong support for the practice of giving students hands-on experience with plant specimens in the classroom. The majority of teachers favoured structured programs incorporating an introductory classroom session followed by outdoor observations recorded on worksheets.\n\nParticipants in the national seminar ‘Environmental Education, Past, Present and Future’ organised by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment attended a field session at the Gardens to review education and interpretation programs in their environmental education context.\n\nWork experience placements of secondary students were made in the Nursery, both horticultural maintenance depots and the Education and\n\nVisitor Services Subsections. In addition, two disabled students were placed in the Education and Visitor Services Subsections. The Education\n\nService co-ordinated the four week visit to the Gardens by Ms Nilwan Sumlitdetkajon, Education Officer, Department of Agriculture, Thailand.\n\nPlant specimens for teaching purposes were provided to Woden College of TAFE and the Australian National University.\n\nNational finalists in the BHP National Science Competition for school students visited the Gardens to become familiar with its biological collecting role. Members of Double Helix: the Science Club (co-ordinated by CSIRO) visited the living collection with parents twice and later participated in an experimental horticulture program. Groups from both Australian Industry Development Corporation National Science\n\nSummer Schools, in residence at Canberra College of Advanced Education, attended programs on the biology of Australian orchids coordinated by Mr Mark Clements.\n\nMrs Anne Boden judged the Australian plant section of Science Fair, the annual science competition arranged by the Science Teachers Association of the ACT.\n\nTherapeutic Horticulture\n\nThe Banksia Centre provides horticultural programs to people both young and old with physical or intellectual disabilities and to people\n\nundergoing rehabilitiation for physical or psychological reasons.\n\nPrograms are planned to meet four major goals, rehabilitation, recreation, vocational training and special education. They are designed to equip disabled people with appropriate skills and experience to lead a more fulfilling life.\n\nThe Banksia Centre garden displays a variety of Australian plants which are colourful, scented, textured and attractive to birds. Clients and visitors are encouraged to touch and smell these plants. Vegetables, flowers and herbs are grown in raised beds and containers for demonstration and training purposes by disabled people, enabling them to practice gardening skills using modified tools and techniques.\n\nThe Therapeutic Horticulture Officer, Ms Ricky Smith, left the Centre in July 1986 to take up a position with the Department of Territories and Mr John Pike supervised the Centre from that time.\n\nJohn Pike spoke of the work of the Centre at the TADSEM seminar on sport and recreation for disabled people in Sydney in October 1986.\n\nStaff participated in workshops conducted interstate at the Division of Health Promotion, Queensland Department of Health; the Bathurst Hospital; the Community Education Centre, Wodonga; and the Cumberland School of Health Sciences, Sydney\n\nA two-week training program for staff and trainees from Tingowun Workshop, Kellyville, NSW, was conducted at the Banksia Centre.\n\nOther workshops were run during the year for health care workers and TAFE students in sport and recreation courses. Students from Canberra\n\nTAFE Special Care Course carried out placement training at the Centre. Staff continued to assist with advice to local and interstate health care\n\norganisations.\n\nAbout 1 700 disabled people attended specific programs and utilised services during the year. Over 500 non-disabled people sought training, advice, or made a visit to the Centre.\n\nThis year the Centre has taken part in a program with Woden Community Services mc, and other health care workers to integrate severely and profoundly disabled adults into the community.\n\nVolunteers have played a major role in the activities of the Centre during the year. Mr Wayne Merryman has been conducting a Horticulture Therapy program at the ACT Mental Health Services Hostel at Watson for the last four years, and eleven other active volunteers have continued in their role of assisting disabled people with transport, garden activities, socialisation skills and caring. Banksia Centre volunteers for 1987 are listed in Appendix 3.\n\nVisitor Services\n\nThe significant event for the year was the opening of The Botanical Services Bookshop at the Gardens in February. This completed the functions originally planned for the Visitor Information Centre and provided visitors to the Gardens with a much sought after facility. It also freed the Information Officer from sales and book-keeping tasks and enabled more time to be spent assisting visitors with information about the Gardens and other promotional activities.\n\nThree major exhibitions were staged in the Visitor Information Centre during the year:\n\nThe ‘Kakadu’ exhibition, presenting the diversity of plant habitats, their associated animal life and the rich Aboriginal culture of this northern Australian heritage area, remained on display until October 1986.\n\n‘Gardening in Australia’ was a very different exhibition, examining the way people of European origin had modified the environment in the immediate vicinity of their Australian homes during the present and past century. Fashions and trends in the design of private gardens, and the marketing of products associated with gardening were presented. Loans of furniture and machinery such as lawnmowers were made available from the Australian National Gallery, the National Museum of Australia and several private collectors and contributed significantly to the interest of the exhibition. It remained on display until April 1987.\n\nThe dependence of animals on plants was the broad theme for the next exhibition, ‘Eaten Alive!’. This exhibition was designed with children in mind with many photographs of interesting\n\nanimals and their associated food plants, and skulls that could be handled to allow the teeth of herbivores and carnivores to be compared. The presentation of the concept of food chains made this exhibition especially relevant for students visiting the Gardens, The exhibition will continue until September 1987,\n\nSmall displays, changed more frequently, were also presented in the Visitor Information Centre, These enabled topical or seasonal issues to be promoted and six were arranged during the year:\n\n‘Mosses, Lichens, Liverworts’ gave a brief introduction to these often neglected plants;\n\n‘Wattle Week’ complemented the ‘A for Acacia’ activities of the Education Subsection in promoting this national event\n\n‘Endangered Species’ featured threatened plants and was the venue for celebrations to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the World Wildlife Fund;\n\n‘Christmas Plants’ featured species associated with Christmas through their colloquial name, and some of the folklore associated with plants and the festive season;\n\n‘Daisies’ displayed the diversity within the family Asteraceae at a time when these plants featured prominently in the Gardens and the surrounding bushland;\n\n‘Urban Spaces, People Places’ celebrated the theme of World Environment Day on 5 June.\n\nOn the weekend of 16-17 May the Gardens hosted an exhibition of native and exotic plants arranged by the ACT Chapter of the National Bonsai Group.\n\nSmaller poster presentation displays were produced for the national seminar ‘Environmental Education, Past, Present and Future’ in February and the Australian Nurserymen’s Association conference in March,\n\nAn allocation of funds under the National Rainforest Conservation Program allowed planning to commence on the interpretation of the Rainforest Gully in the Gardens, Graphic signs and labels will explain the concept of species plantings along the length of the Gully to illustrate habitats in eastern Australia\n\nThe use of the Theatrette increased significantly during the year as it became more widely known. When not being used for staff awareness programs or by gardening or botanical societies it was made available for government sponsored seminars, often bringing an awareness of the Gardens to people who might not otherwise visit.\n\nHerbarium and Public Programs staff assisted with the growth of the Public Access Herbarium. While it is a valuable resource for the Horticultural Adviser in answering public enquiries its incomplete state reduces its effective use by visitors.\n\nThe services of Mrs Effie Mullins, the Horticultural Adviser continued to be in great demand during the year. Advice was given to 2 360 people and a further 450 requests for horticultural information or plant identification were handled by mail.\n\nThroughout the year, 188 guided tours of the Gardens were conducted for a total of 3 600 visitors by the Rangers and other Visitor Services staff. These included regular Sunday tours at 10.00 am and 2.00 pm and weekday tours booked by clubs, societies and schools.\n\nThe appointment in March of a part-time graphic designer within Visitor Services added considerably to the range of promotional and other graphic material produced for this and other subsections within the Gardens\n\nStorage for photographic prints used in exhibitions was considerably improved by new shelving in the display preparation area, and the purchase of a small computer and laser printer resulted in more efficient production of display captions and information sheets in the later part of the year\n\nFour officers from Visitor Services were involved with courses or seminars outside the Gardens. Mr Rodney Harvey attended the Council of Australian Museums Association’s annual conference in Perth in October 1986. Mr Murray Fagg attended the first national seminar of the Australian Photographic Access Network (APAN) in Sydney in February 1987. Mrs Jan Wilson attended a Desktop Publishing course in April 1987. Mr Ron Hotchkiss attended ‘Photographics 87’ in Sydney in May 1987.\n\nVolunteers continued to provide valuable service during the year. Mrs Joyce England’s ‘In Flower This Week’ sheet proved increasingly popular and this was continued during her three weeks’ absence from Canberra by Dr. Jeffery Clyde. About 150 copies were taken by visitors each week\n\nOn 22 January 1987 the Gardens hosted the fifth Senior Citizens’ Australia Day concert organised by the Australia Day Council and the Canberra Permanent Building Society with the aid of several business and community organisations. The concert was opened by Mrs Jean Lane, wife of the United States of America Ambassador to Australia and member of the Board of the Pacific Tropical Botanic Gardens. Almost 1 000 people attended.\n\nPhotographic Collection\n\nThe Gardens has a collection of 15 750 35 mm colour slides, of which 7 600 are habit or close-up photos of Australian native plants and 4 000\n\nare field trip records of those plants. The remainder include various lecture slides and records of Gardens activities.\n\nA total of 198 slides were made available for use in government and non-government publications in 1986-87, a 100 per cent rise on last year. The collection was also used extensively for educational purposes and for the production of exhibitions at the Gardens.\n\nWork continues on the incorporation of the records of the photographic collection into the Gardens’ automated data base. During the later part of the year the collection was transferred from timber cabinets to archival suspension folders housed in fire resistant steel filing safes.\n\nRESEARCH\n\nResearch at the Gardens concerns the systematic botany, horticulture and biology of the Australian and related floras. The institutional structure reflects these three components of plant science. Systematic botany provides the phylogenetic and taxonomic framework upon which all of plant science is based. Horticultural research is essential to the successful introduction, propagation and long term maintenance of plants in cultivation. Basic biological information on the breeding mechanisms, genetic diversity and mycorrhizal associations of plant populations is an essential prerequisite toformulating conservation strategies. All areas of research at the Gardens are influenced by the urgent problem of conserving Australia’s endangered species. Staff have developed widely acknowledged expertise in three large families: the Fabaceae, Orchidaceae and Rutaceae. Research programs focus largely upon these families in order to amplify and refine this fund of knowledge. Much of the research is conducted in collaboration with kindred institutions.\n\nHighlights for the year included international liaison by three staff members, (Dr Crisp, Mr Clements and Mr Telford) following invitations to present papers at conferences and carry out joint research in overseas institutions.\n\nMajor acquisitions were a second glasshouse to facilitate horticultural research programs and additional computing equipment for use in data analysis, storage and retrieval and preparation of manuscripts. A Science 2 position was created in Biological Research to allow development of a program for cryogenic storage of plant germplasm, primarily of endangered species. During the year, continuity of several research programs was interrupted by changes in personnel.\n\nBotanical Research\n\nThe Botanical Research subsection is concerned with the systematics of the Australian and related floras. Activities include revisionary and\n\nnomenclatural studies, phylogenetics, biogeography and flora treatments. These studies are carried out in a variety of flowering plant\n\n16\n\nfamilies, with particular emphasis upon Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae and Rutaceae.\n\nCucurbiatceae.\n\nRevisionary studies on the Australian genera continued. Mr IanTelford concluded his account of the family for the Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaii, following a trip to the USA and Europe to examine type specimens\n\nFabaceae.\n\nA revision of the family for a new edition of the Flora of Central Australia was completed with the preparation of a paper by Dr Michael Crisp and Mrs Joan Taylor describing new species of Leptosema and Mirbelia. Dr Crisp, in collaboration with Professor Pate of the University of Western Australia, made a study of the evolution of a remarkable new kind of root anatomy in Daviesia. A paper describing a new species of Isotropis from Queensland was accepted for publication. Work continued towards a revision of Chorizema, with the completion of most descriptions and the preparation of several line drawings.\n\nMyrtaceae.\n\nResearch on the remarkable new species of Eucalyptus from near Braidwood, NSW, yielded further support for the initial hypotheses of a relationship to the Tasmanian endemic, E. vernicosa. A paper by Dr Crisp describing and naming the species (‘E. recurva’) was accepted for publication. Gardens’ studies on this plant received a great deal of media coverage during the year.\n\nOrchidaceae.\n\nRevisionary studies in Calochilus, Chiloglottis, Dendrobium, Dipodium, Prasophyllum and Pterostylis continued towards the preparation of accounts for the Flora of Australia. This research is being done jointly by Mr Mark Clements and Dr D L Jones of Currumbin, Queensland. A revision of the Preliminary Checklist of Australian Orchidaceae by Mr Clements is nearing completion. A manuscript of orchids common to S E Asia and Australia was submitted for publication.\n\nProteaceae.\n\nStudies on the waratahs (Telopea and a new Australian genus related to Oreocallis in South America) by Dr Crisp continued in collaboration with Dr P H Weston of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. An account of the group was submitted to the Flora of Australia. Morphometric studies on geographic variation in Telopea oreades, T. mongaensis and T. speciosissima were completed with the preparation of a manuscript for publication. Work continued on a cladistic and biogeographic analysis of waratahs.\n\nRutaceae.\n\nWork continued on the evolution and classification of the tribe Boronieae. An account of the family by Mr Jim Armstrong and Mr Ian Telford appeared in the Flora of South Australia.\n\nIsland Territories Flora.\n\nPreparation by Mr Telford of a treatment of the Cocos (Keeling) and other tropical island groups for the Flora of Australia continued.\n\nHorticultural Research\n\nThe Horticultural Research Subsection is concerned with the propagation and cultivation of the Australian and related floras, investigating both traditional and newly developed methods. This research is an essential basis for the successful introduction, establishment, maintenance and long term survival of species in the living collections.\n\nCurrent Horticultural Research programs, each of which includes several projects, include:\n\nIn Vitro Studies.\n\nIn vitro techniques continued to be developed for the propagation of endangered plant taxa. These techniques encompassed seed germination and tissue culture including meristem, embryo, ovule and haploid anther culture of both herbaceous and woody species. Preliminary work on anther culture of Correa spp. yielded encouraging results. Some success was achieved with the embryo culture of species possessing recalcitrant seeds.\n\nPropagation and Cultivation Studies.\n\nStudies on Phytophthora cinnamomi, a pathogenic fungus which is adversely affecting some native plants in Australia continued. Initial work concerned the wide range of Boronia species represented in the Gardens. Different species were evaluated for resistance or acceptability to the pathogen. Assessment of grafting trials, including that of Eremophila spp. onto Myoporum stocks, continued. Work commenced on selection of a root- suckering form of Eriostemon buxifolious for amenity horticulture. Papers by Dr Ish Sharma and others reporting two earlier studies on leaf pathogens of Swainsona galegifolia and Correa spp. were published.\n\nMycorrhiza in plant production.\n\nResearch to establish a method for routine symbiotic germination of the orchids Cypripedium and Paphiopedilum was commenced.\n\nBiological Research\n\nThe Biological Research Subsection was established with the aim of developing a more sophisticated laboratory-based operation for studying the biology of Australian and related plants. To this end, work over the past year was focused on study of the breeding systems and pollination biology of species that are endangered or belong to the families in the which the Gardens specializes.\n\nBiological Research continued in the following major programs, each encompassing several projects:\n\nRare and Endangered Plant Studies.\n\nConservation biology studies of the endangered species Hibiscus insularis continued with investigations of its breeding systems, conducted in the insect-free environment of the new quarantine glasshouse.\n\nBreeding Systems/Pollination Biology Studies.\n\nStudies continued on Thelymitra (Orchidaceae) and Zieria (Rutaceae). Further investigations were made with the aim of improving techniques in the Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rutaceae.\n\nPhytochemical/Isoenzyme Studies.\n\nStudy of plant genetics by means of isoenzymes provided information on the heterogeneity of taxa. Such information is of prime importance in planning to ensure the long term survival of endangered species. Isoenzyme studies also provide invaluable information for systematic projects. This program is in its preliminary stages.\n\nBiology of Mycorrhizal Fungi.\n\nThis program investigated plant/mycorrhizal relationships in Australian and related plants. Two papers concerning orchid- fungus-host associations in epiphytic orchids and two about recent developments in the symbiotic germination and propagation of orchids by Mr Mark Clements and Ms Karen Groeneveld were presented at conferences during the year and are now in press.\n\nResearch Fieldwork and Conferences\n\nFieldwork to collect plant material for research on Orchidaceae and Rutaceae was undertaken in the Little Desert and the Grampians (Victoria) and on Eyre Peninsula ( South Australia). Several short trips were made to Braidwood ( New South Wales) to study a rare eucalypt. A trip to the D’Aguilar Range west of Brisbane ( Queensland) yielded material from which a rare new species of Isotropis (Fabaceae) was described and named, as well as being brought into cultivation.\n\nMr Mark Clements attended three international conferences, where he presented papers: the Sixth Asian Orchid Congress in Bangkok, Thailand in November; the 12th World Orchid Conference in Tokyo; and the World Orchid Hiroshima Symposium in Hiroshima, Japan in March.\n\nDr Michael Crisp travelled to USA in June and July 1986 where he made systematic studies on Fabaceae at the Missouri Botanical Garden. He also visited Professor T Duncan and Dr C. Meacham to carry out cladistic studies and discuss computer applications in botany.\n\nMr Jim Armstrong and Ms Karen Groeneveld presented papers at the Australian Pollination Ecologists Society Meeting held in August at the\n\nLittle Desert Lodge in Victoria.\n\nMr Mark Clements presented a paper at the 10th Australian Orchid Conference in Adelaide in September.\n\nMr Ian Telford and Dr Michael Crisp attended the Symposium on the Ecology of Australia’s Wet Tropics in August, where Mr Telford presented a poster paper on the biogeography of the Cucurbitaceae. Dr Crisp attended the Council and General meetings of the Australian\n\nSystematic Botany Society.\n\nLIBRARY\n\nThe Australian National Botanic Gardens Library has a collection of approximately 2 500 titles, 450 serials and 4 700 maps. Professional and technical services to the Gardens’ Library are provided by the Department of Arts, Heritage and Environment’s Library Services Section.\n\nDuring the year concerted efforts were made to improve the Library facilities and services. These included:\n\nthe temporary employment of a Librarian, Mrs Jocelyn Brown, to develop indexing, information systems, resource-sharing networks and to refine administrative procedures;\n\nassessment of user needs by consultation;\n\ninvestigation of botanical information services in other institutions;\n\nimproved access to online data bases;\n\ninstallation of a terminal to allow access to online cataloguing through the Department’s library.\n\nMAJOR OFFICIAL VISITS\n\nMrs Srimati Gandhi, wife of the Prime Minister of India visited the Gardens on 15 October. Mrs Gandhi inspected the Visitor Information Centre and met staff before touring the Gardens with the Director.\n\nDr Dong Zhiyong, Chinese Vice-Minister for Forestry visited the Gardens with a party of officials from the Ministry of Forestry on 20 October. The Director welcomed the group which then inspected the Gardens.\n\nMr Liu Jiang, Chinese Vice-Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries visited the Gardens on 2 April accompanied by Mr Geoff Miller, Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry. Mr Liu was welcomed by the Visitor Services Officer who took him on a tour of the Gardens.\n\nOn 13 March 1987 the Gardens hosted a seminar by the internationally renowned conservationist, Dr Norman Myers, on the Conservation of\n\nThreatened Species Habitats and the Protection of Wild Genetic Resources.\n\nMs Nilwan Sumlitdetkajon, Education Officer for the Department of Agriculture in Thailand, visited and worked in all areas during a four week traineeship at the Gardens in October.\n\nA fourteen week visit by Mr Robert Mitchell of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, enabled him to learn new techniques in orchid propagation developed by the Research Section.\n\nThe Trustees and Fellows of the Pacific Tropical Botanical Garden, Hawaii, visited the Gardens in November. The group was welcomed by the Director and guided around the Gardens by Public Programs’ staff.\n\nThe Australian Nurserymen’s Association visited the Gardens as part of their national convention in February.
