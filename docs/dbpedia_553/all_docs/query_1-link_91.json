        "text": "Grad. Dip. Sci. (1997) Australian National University, Canberra.\n\nWork in the Herbarium\n\nMy work in the herbarium can be split into four broad areas:\n\n1. Curation\n\nThis involves the curation of a number of families including Myrtaceae, Rutaceae, Casuarinaceae, Goodeniaceae, Campanulaceae, Stylidiaceae and Thymelaeaceae, conveying name changes to ANBG Living Collections, the identification of plant specimens for the ANBG, other scientific institutions and the public, and finally, training and overseeing herbarium student interns, work experience students, volunteers and other herbarium users.\n\n2. Field Work\n\nPlanning and preparing field trips involving the collection of herbarium specimens and live material.\n\n3. Research\n\nResearch centres upon the family Myrtaceae with particular interest in the genus Leptospermum.\n\nI am also involved in the Flora of Australia project as a contributor for the genera Choricarpia, Lindsayomyrtus and Osbornia.\n\n4. Miscellaneous\n\nThere are a number of other tasks that come along with varying frequency involving OH&S (Occupational Health and Safety) and EEO (Equal Employment Opportunity). One major miscellaneous task involves the -\n\nWorld Wide Web - Maintenance of files associated with the Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research and Australian Systematic Botany Society (ASBS) WWW sites.\n\nPublications\n\nLyne, A.M. et. al.
