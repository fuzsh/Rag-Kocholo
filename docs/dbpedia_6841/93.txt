Murder, My Sweet is a 1944 film noir directed by Edward Dmytryk. It was based on Raymond Chandler's 1949 novel "Farewell My Lovely" and was released in the United Kingdom with this title but although the film was first screened in Minneapolis as "Farewell My Lovely it opened a year later in New York as Murder, My Sweet; a second film adaptation released in the United States in 1975 also bore Chandler's title.

Dick Powell, cast as Philip Marlowe, was known mainly as a comedy and musical star so his casting as a hard-nosed private detective was a surprise to audiences. His casting was the reason for the name change as executives believed that Farewell My Lovely sounded like a musical. Die hard Marlowe fans often contend Powell's performance was too light hearted but others consider it the most accurate portrayal of Chandler's protagonist.

Murder, My Sweet is considered one of the best film adaptations of a Chandler novel, marching the first person narrative and the dark atmosphere that was unmatched at the time.

Murder, My Sweet won five Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America including Best Motion Picture and Best Actor for Dick Powell.
