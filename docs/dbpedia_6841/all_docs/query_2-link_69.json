        "text": "Dick Powell stars as Raymond Chandler's hard-bitten, world-weary private detective, Philip Marlowe, in this classic film noir adaptation of Chandler's novel \"Farewell, My Lovely\". Marlowe takes a job looking for Moose Malloy's (Mike Mazurki) girlfriend Velma. Malloy's a petty criminal just released after a seven-year prison sentence, and Velma has not been seen for six years. But a simple missing-person case becomes much more twisted than Marlowe ever anticipated as initially promising clues lead to a complex web of deceit, bribery, perjury and theft, in which no one's motivation is clear ... least of all Marlowe's.\n\nWelcome to CriterionForum.org, one of the premier destinations on the web to discuss DVD releases from The Criterion Collection, Masters of Cinema, and other DVD production companies from around the world.
