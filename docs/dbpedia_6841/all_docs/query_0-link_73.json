So successful was the film that he need not make musicals. Even writer Raymond Chandler praised his performance. There is minor soiling at the blank white margins, a single pin holes at each top corner, three pin holes at center of top blank margin a pin hole at center bottom blank white margin and one about three-quarters down from top on both the left and right side blank white margins. There is some dark tape on the back of the card at the very top. VERY GOOD+.",
