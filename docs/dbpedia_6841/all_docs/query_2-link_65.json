This copy brought over $8,000 at auction, Heritage June, 2008.\n\nOne of the finest crime novels ever written, by one of the inventors of the hard-boiled detective genre. A Haycraft-Queen cornerstone, \"Farewell, My Lovely\" was the second Philip Marlowe novel, published in 1940. The plot was inspired by a number of short stories Chandler had written earlier, including \"Mandarin's Jade\", \"The Man Who Liked Dogs\", and “Try the Girl.” It follows Marlowe as he investigates the violent murder of a night club manager. The book was actually the first of Chandler’s novels to be made into a film, in 1942, as \"The Falcon Takes Over.\" It was filmed again in 1944 as the critically acclaimed \"Murder, My Sweet\" and in 1975, in a version starring Robert Mitchum. “…the appeal of 'Farewell, My Lovely' is in its toughness, which is extremely well done.” (Contemporary New York Times Review) Fine in Near Fine dust jacket.
