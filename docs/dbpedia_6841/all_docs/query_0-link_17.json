        "text": "MOOSE\n\nWho asked you to stick your face in?\n\nMARLOWE\n\nYou did. Remember me? I'm the guy who came in with you, Chunky.\n\nMOOSE\n\nMoose. The name is Moose. On accounta I'm large.\n\nMARLOWE V.O.\n\n(on Mr. Florian)\n\nHe died in 1940 in the middle of a glass of beer. His wife Jessie finished it for him. Tracing her was easy. I could do that. A real bright third grader could have done it. But not Malloy. He needed a private detective. She was a charming middle-aged lady with a face like a bucket of mud. I gave her a drink. She was a gal who'd take a drink, if she had to knock you down to get to the bottle.\n\nMARRIOTT\n\nI'm afraid I don't like your manner.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nYeah, I've had complaints about it but it keeps getting worse.\n\nMARLOWE V.O.\n\nI caught the blackjack right behind my ear. A black pool opened up at my feet. I dived in. It had no bottom. I felt pretty good. Like an amputated leg.\n\nMARLOWE V.O.\n\nIt was a nice little front yard. Cozy. Okay for the average family. Only you needed a compass to go to the mailbox. The house was alright too. But it wasn't as big as Buckingham Palace.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nI worked for the DA and got fired.\n\nMRS. GRAYLE\n\nNot for incompetence, surely.\n\nMARLOWE\n\nFor talking back. I had an interesting childhood too but you didn't drop in on me to get a biography."
