        "text": "August 29, 2024\n\nI’m speechless after reading this bone chilling, dark, twisty, mind bending thriller which is one of the best works of Lisa Jewel.\n\nAfter reading a few pages, you find yourself drawn into riveting psychological thriller with unreliable characters, shocking revelations in podcast meets documentary blending in narration of incidents by hours and dates. It starts slow but the sinister feeling tingles beneath your neck, warning you bad things are about to come and sooner all hell breaks loose. So many red flags appear in your vision as you keep flipping the pages. At the second half, things get escalated! You barely hold your screams as more tragic events follow each other. It’s like listening to a concerto slowly raises its tempo and as you reach the ending, you hear the crescendo: that’s moment the earth shattering revelation squeezes your heart, you barely breathe!\n\nI have so many words for the ending that are not enough to express my feelings. It’s heartbreaking, shocking, eerie, unsettling, disturbing!\n\nThe storyline revolves around two women who share the same birthday, were born in the same city, hospital, chose the same place to celebrate their 45th birthday. One of them is Alix Summers; famous podcaster promoting aspiring women who take their second changes for life to achieve bigger things. The other woman is Josie Fair, married with her husband two times older than her, mother of 2 daughters in twenties, a teen mother, who is unsatisfied with her life and her unaccomplished dreams.\n\nOn the other hand, Alix lives in her dream house, happily married, with two young children. Her husband’s late benders start to damage their marriage. She wants a distraction not to confront for her problems.\n\nJosie is adamant to involve in Alix’s life, creating coincidences to bump into her around her children’s schoolyard. When Josie starts to tell her about her traumatic life, Alix thinks she already found the distraction she needed. Using Josie’s story who wants to make imminent changes in her life may attract her audiences’ attention.\n\nBut Josie seems like more than telling her story, lurking around Alix’s house, trying to be part of her life, criticizing her marriage.\n\nThe things Josie confesses during podcast recording scare the living daylights of Alix. Is Josie survivor of years long abuse, neglect, traumatic experiences? Could Alix help her birth twin for setting her free from her torturous life?\n\nOr did she invite trouble into her own house by accepting to make this podcast?\n\nWhen Josie knocks her door in the middle of the night, Alix realizes things can get more out of control and nothing as it seems.\n\nOverall, it’s one of the stories that stay with you for years, still giving you goosebumps at each time you remember the characters and main events. It took my breath away! I think I’m not going to get peaceful sleep for a long time. The birthday twins’ story may haunt me forever! Dear Lisa Jewel perfectly achieved to rock my world again!\n\nGiving my highly deserved five stars to this mind numbing, complex, highly sinister, perfectly developed and executed novel!\n\nSpecial thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for sharing this brilliant novels of digital copy in exchange my honest thoughts.\n\nIf you’re interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below:\n\nmedium.com\n\ninstagram\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nJuly 23, 2023\n\n4 1/2 stars. I want to start by saying: this was absolutely riveting. I inhaled this book. The only way the pages could have turned faster is if I had more hours in my day.\n\nThe reason I am not giving None of This Is True five stars, which I thought I would for 95% of the book, is that I feel conflicted about the ending. Maybe it is because I have certain expectations from Jewell at this point, and the ending here didn't fit with them... I just know that I wanted more from the final chapters. In a way, it felt unfinished. Could there be a sequel lined up?\n\nBut back to me gushing about the stuff I loved because this is a cracktastic ride.\n\nJewell throws together two women-- birthday twins, born on the same day in the same hospital -- from very different backgrounds. Alix Summer, with her seemingly perfect life as a podcaster and her seemingly perfect family in their beautiful house, and Josie, a woman from a council estate with a past filled with abuse, grooming and who-knows-what other horrors.\n\nWhen Josie proposes she be a guest on Alix's podcast to tell the story of her life, Alix is curious about this strange woman. Josie lets Alix into her life and history through the podcast and Alix, in turn, gradually lets Josie into her life too. But the more Alix comes to know Josie and her past, the more she worries she's made a terrible mistake.\n\nLots of short, punchy chapters, interspersed with a Netflix documentary and podcast extracts, all make for a very fast-paced read. You know bad shit has happened from the start, maybe reeeaaaaalllly bad shit, but I didn't have a clue what, exactly, had gone down, and I was desperate to find out.\n\nAlix's life is nowhere near as shiny as it appears on the surface and Josie is just a fascinating character. Peeling apart the layers of her backstory, discovering her childhood, her role as a mother, and the lies she has told, was pure heart-pounding fun!\n\nThe wait for Jewell's next book will be too long.\n\nDecember 22, 2023\n\nI don't know how to feel about this 😵‍💫 (but I did binge it in one sitting)\n\nJanuary 25, 2024\n\nOkay this is definitely an interesting ride. Two women living two totally different and separate lives are brought together in a pub on the same night because they share the same birthday. One of them is a nut job and the story goes from there. Different than most thrillers I’ve read, but I needed more from the ending! Solid 4\n\nAugust 17, 2023\n\nNone of This is True couldn’t be more apt for the title.\n\nAlix Summers, a popular podcaster, is out celebrating her forty-fifth birthday when she meets her birthday twin Josie Fair. She doesn’t think much more about it until she runs into Josie again outside her children’s school. One thing leads to another, and Josie convinces Alix they should make a podcast about Josie’s life, sharing her truth and making some big changes.\n\nAlix believes Josie has a compelling story to tell, even if she finds her unsettling and a bit intense. Things escalate quickly, and the two women’s lives become inextricably tied.\n\nIf this book didn’t victim blame a thirteen-year-old girl, it would have been a four-star read. A teen is incapable (and inculpable) of holding any power over a creepy middle-aged man.\n\nI was engrossed in this story until Walter’s crimes were glossed over. It seems his repeated pedophilia was excusable because he was supposedly a good father. Can a pedo even be a good father? It doesn’t add up.\n\nUntil this point, I found the story utterly compelling. I could feel Alix’s anxieties and Josie’s oppressive presence, but it all went downhill from there. The more I think about it, the worse it gets.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nApril 11, 2023\n\nTrust Your Instincts\n\nNone of This is True is a psychological thriller about two women who, through a chance encounter, learn they are birthday twins. Their unlikely meeting turns into a podcast in which shared confidences become the motive for murder.\n\nMeet Josie Fair, a 45-year-old part-time seamstress. Married to a man significantly older, she has decided to change the course of her life in her 45th year. Alix comes into her life at just the right time--a podcast host, she is the perfect woman to help Josie share her intriguing story. Alix and Josie’s lives become intertwined in more ways than one, culminating in a chilling crime.\n\nChapters alternate between Josie and Alix. Josie is alluring, but she is also intense and odd. She is off-putting but enthralling at the same time. Her story is questionable, and I was waffling back and forth while reading this on her reliability. Alix’s chapters are not as interesting as Josie’s, but she adds a level of stability to the story.\n\nInterspersed between chapters are interviews filmed for a Netflix series called “The Birthday Twin.” These tidbits add another layer to the events, but the snippets don’t show the whole of the situation until the end when the truth is finally revealed.\n\nThis is an addictive page-turner that I couldn’t put down. Josie is a train wreck of a character that I couldn’t look away from. Her character is one of the reasons I enjoyed this novel. At the same time, themes include pedophilia, alcoholism, and physical and emotional abuse, so it is not a fun read. It is also dark, tense, suspenseful, and has some major creepy vibes. The ending gave me the chills.\n\nI haven’t loved Jewell’s most recent novels, but this one is back to form.\n\nI received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Atria Books in exchange for an honest review.\n\nSeptember 27, 2023\n\nIt took me awhile to sort out my thoughts on this one, as it was not quite what I expected, but that isn’t a bad thing. I buddy read this with my sister Irina, and part of the reason I love reading the same book as a friend or friends is due to the fact that you can really hash out your book review content ahead of time. We both ended up with similar feelings on None of This Is True, and foremost agreed that it was a compulsive, must read suspense tale.\n\nLisa Jewell is an incredibly talented storyteller, as she can really take the odd day-to-day occurrences and entwine them with clear and concise character development, giving birth to novels that allow the reader to fully engage with the cast of characters, no matter if they are likable or despicable. This book is no different, and the multiple povs really give us insight into the various narrators inner thoughts and feelings while the tension ramps up around them. Josie and Alix couldn’t be more different; they come from different lifestyles and circumstances, and yet… Could they be more similar than originally meets the eye?\n\nNo spoilers, but there are some heavy themes discussed here. In fact, the build up of 85% of the novel is such a beautiful master class on slow burning suspense, and how to do it so that you don’t lose the reader in the process, that I was sure this would be Jewell’s darkest novel yet. The final 15% is what threw me for a loop. There are a few aspects that I had to overlook up until this point, behaviors and lack of affirmative action in the characters that I don’t think would play out the way it did in the book in real life, but understandably needed to be done to progress this particular story.\n\nHowever, my reason for not giving this a full 5 stars is that this final 15% felt as if it just lost steam and wasn’t sure of how it wanted to end, so it took a milder finale that had me feeling a little deflated, going from full speed ahead to a little bit of, “Wait, that’s it?” I believe the ending was designed to give the reader some authority over how they perceived not only the entire story, but also what happens after the final page is turned, although I would have been more satisfied with full closure.\n\nThat said, this game of cat and mouse was such a deviously delightful read that I can’t help but highly recommend it for your 2022 TBR. While not my favorite Lisa Jewell novel, it is an immensely enjoyable read that will be a fantastic book club choice, brimming with copious discussion material.\n\n*Many thanks to the publisher for my review copy.\n\nAugust 15, 2023\n\nCompared to Jewell's previous few books, I liked this one quite a bit better. Most of it anyway.\n\nNone of This Is True--but what is true and what isn't? That's the question I was asking myself throughout my reading.\n\nJosie and her husband are celebrating Josie's 45th birthday in a pub. At a table nearby, podcaster Alix is also celebrating her 45th birthday. Josie has a quiet, reserved, different type of life, and Alix seems to have everything Josie wants. The two meet and discover that they are \"birthday twins\" and this eventually involves Alix interviewing Josie for her podcast. Josie tells the tale of her life and Alix is shocked. But what is true? Is any of it?\n\nJewell's writing is strong and I was thoroughly invested. I could not stand Josie, but that was totally the point. The ending is interesting and really got me thinking. My recommendation is to just go into the reading of this book with an open mind and without any preconceived notions as to what you think is going on, because that will probably change many times throughout.\n\nThere were a few holes in the narrative and a few times that I thought the story could have been a bit tighter and less repetitive. However in the end I was able to overlook those factors and just go with it. And you have to be ready to set aside that a 13-15 year old CHILD cannot consent to a relationship regardless of how whackadoodle sociopathic she is. She just can't. And if Walter was turned on by that, then ew. If I had my MSW daughter read this she would say Josie's actions throughout the book all stemmed from that unresolved trauma and she wouldn't be wrong.\n\nDecent psychological suspense story that will provide a wild ride, so buckle up!\n\nI voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own.\n\nAugust 29, 2024\n\nLisa Jewell's latest Psychological Thriller grabbed my attention from the start and held it all the way through. This was absolutely addictive!!\n\nWhen I first heard about this, I could hardly believe it. A story that follows two women turning forty-five, and I am turning forty-five this year. It can't be coincidence...\n\nI just knew I was going to love it and per usual, I was right. Not only did I love it, I freaking loved it. This will definitely be on my Favorites of the Year list.\n\nAn added treat was Buddy Reading it with my beautiful niece, Lyss. I definitely recommend it for Buddy Reads or Book Clubs. There's a lot to discuss.\n\nThis story follows two women, Alix Summers, a popular podcaster, and Josie Fair, an unassuming woman, whose profession is so inconsequential, I can't recall it.\n\nAlix and Josie bump into each other for the first time in the bathroom of a local pub, coincidentally on the day they were both turning 45. They were birthday twins!\n\nShortly after, they bump into each other again outside of the school that Alix's children currently attend, and Josie's attended years ago.\n\nAs they are chatting, Josie, who has listened to Alix's podcast, pitches an idea to her. Alix should do a podcast focusing on Josie's life.\n\nJosie tells Alix that she is on the brink of making some very drastic changes and she'd like Alix to document the process.\n\nEven though Alix finds Josie's vibe unsettling, she admits there's something fascinating about her. She is intrigued.\n\nUnable to resist temptation to dig into Josie's life, Alix accepts her offer and begins to record the podcast, inviting Josie to her home studio for interview sessions.\n\nFrom that point on, the women's lives become entangled. It doesn't take long for Alix to suspect that Josie is so much more than she initially appeared. Josie is a smart woman, who happens to be hiding some very dark secrets.\n\nJosie infiltrates Alix's life so deeply, she eventually ends up living at her house. Alix hardly knows how any of this happened and then suddenly, Josie's gone. That's when Alix's real nightmare begins.\n\nI was completely swept up in the lives of these two women. I loved the back and forth, learning about their past and present circumstances. Their dynamic, as well, was fascinating.\n\nRight off the bat, I was intrigued and I felt like I was being misdirected in some way. The path the story took, I was never quite sure who I could trust.\n\nAs the story progresses, it's like a veil being pulled from your eyes, but I still couldn't believe what I was reading. It was so twisted!\n\nI absolutely recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast-paced and tense Psychological Thrillers. Bonus points if you have enjoyed Jewell's work in the past, or love stories that incorporate a podcast, or true crime, element.\n\nFor the record, I thought Jewell nailed the podcast turned True Crime documentary angle. Additionally, her use of mixed media, with the sections from the Netflix series, was amazingly well done; round of applause.\n\nThank you so much to the publisher, Atria Books, for providing me with a copy to read and review. This was an absolute blast to read. I cannot wait to pick up more from this author!\n\nAugust 5, 2023\n\n2.5⭐️ the best part of this book is that it's finally over\n\nMy work colleagues might fight me on this one on Monday 🤭 was the premise good? yes, very good actually. It was new and fun and twisty and I loved it.\n\nUnfortunately as the story progressed every character became less interesting. I thought oh wait but the storyline build-up is good so maybe there's still time to save the book. Guess what? it didn't save the book 😬 the last 20% was very anticlimactic and some twists just ruined the book for me.\n\n*** incoming minor spoiler\n\n...\n\nSo you want to tell me that every person was defending on a pedophile and the mc's mum is viciously angry because her 16 year old daughter seduced a 43 year old man who was married to another woman but having an affair with this little girl's mum? 😳😳😳\n\nAugust 18, 2023\n\nCould. Not. Put. It. Down. Very few books cause me to wake up at 2:00 am to finish reading. This heart-pounding, gripping thriller opens with two women celebrating their forty-fifth birthday at the same pub. They meet in the loo and learn they were born on the same day in the same hospital.\n\nOne of the women is a podcaster and the small piece of information about being birthday twins starts a relationship that is faster than a runaway locomotive. While reading the book, I felt like the emoji that has both hands over their eyes but with their fingers spread so that the upcoming train wreck is slightly visible.\n\nHighly, highly recommend! Buckle up for the ride!\n\nAugust 1, 2023\n\n4 depraved, twisty, dark, and disturbing stars✨✨✨✨. One star blacked out because of the ending.\n\nI am a huge fan of Lisa Jewell, and this was right up there in terms of thrill, fast pace, plot, writing style and characterisation – yes but that doesn’t mean I liked the characters. Josie in particular was detestable.\n\nThe Plot\n\nAs the birthday celebrations get underway, a chance encounter between Josie and Alix reveals they not only share the same birth date, but they were also born in the same hospital, on the same day, and went to the same school. Except one is psychotic, a murderer, and a serial abuser.\n\nIt doesn't end there, these two women seemingly share frustrations with each of their respective partners. Alix, whose husband, Nathan, is a binge drinker and frequently fails to come home, and Walter whose age gap has become even more noticeable to his much younger wife. Although she feels ‘groomed’ and controlled from the age of sixteen. A storyline which makes this difficult to endure in some parts, but they are real life issues so of course we should cover them.\n\nAlix is convinced by Josie to make her the subject and storyline of her next podcast which reaches out to thousands of women suffering domestic and psychological abuse, and women who enjoy hearing other life stories. What is to happen here though, changing format is the story has not yet completed. Its real time crime!!!.\n\nReview and Comments\n\nThis story had me gripped throughout but I feel the ending let the book down a little. It was too contrived, and I failed to appreciate what drove this woman to do the things she did. I also enjoy more analysis when taking on difficult subjects and wanted a better ending for Roxy and Erin. The story behind Walter was left vague for me and didn’t conclude on the various aspects of his life and actions. Did he marry a much younger girl or was he guilty of ‘grooming’ her??. I settled on the former in the absence of any more detail. Even that was weird though.\n\nThe ending did not spoil the book - it's just it could have been better. I would like to have seen the threads tied up nicely or differently, and then this would have been a clear 5 star book.\n\nHowever, for the plot as a whole this was excellent and whilst not entirely surprising, it was unpredictable which maintained the tension in the story. To have disliked some of the characters so much means Lisa Jewell did her job well. The suspense was palatable, the sense of danger and thrill was accretive and penetrating. The themes were well chosen. The underlying messages are great although some could have been fleshed out more, and the writing style just works a treat for me.\n\nI read this in day which I am deliberately not doing any more, because this was such a captivating read and a great book overall.\n\nA thrilling thriller, a chilling reminder to pick your friends carefully, and an immersive read that should keep you hooked.\n\nAugust 1, 2023\n\nThis book started off on a really good foot. The storyline was gripping. I was invested. I liked how this book took the podcast element up a notch by adding a Netflix documentary spin. However, the last 20% of the book was a huge disappointment. Without getting into spoilers, this story has two possible scenarios that are left open for the readers' interpretation on what the truth is (if you don't like open ended endings then you won't like this book). However, either way you swing it, there is one particular character who is 100% a horrific person regardless of which scenario is correct. Sure, that particular character did meet their fate in this book, however, why did they get a redemption arc/sympathy. I thought it was in bad taste. Lisa Jewell completely missed an opportunity with this one, but instead decided to victim blame a 13-year-old who was groomed by a 40 year old and married her abuser. I almost settled on 2 stars because I did enjoy the book up until that point. However, the more time went by after I finished this book, the more enraged I became. I am not a sensitive reader, so for me to be offended by a book, it has to really grind my gears.\n\nThank you Netgalley, Atria Books, and Lisa Jewell for the eARC.\n\nExpected Publication Date: 8/8/2023\n\nAugust 24, 2023\n\nTrigger warning: abuse\n\nI’ve seen mixed reviews for this book, but overall I enjoyed it. It is dark, and some have fairly remarked on how the matter of child abuse was treated. I don’t want to get into that, although I get why this is a sensitive topic. Despite the book being about dark topics, it read as a thriller and I liked the podcast angle. For some reason I like the twisted minds of someone with their own agenda, and the anticipation of what will happen next. You know something isn’t quite right, there are red herrings making feel uncomfortable inside, but you want to dive into the murky water to see the creatures lurking there. After all, isn’t that why we love unrealistic horror movies, because we can watch but still feel detached from it all? This isn’t a pleasant read, and it can easily become too much, but the exploration of themes like obsession, manipulation and warped mindsets did appeal to me.\n\nI think it’s best to make up one’s own opinion on this one, I get why some might feel uncomfortable, angry and frustrated by how some themes are handled.\n\nJanuary 10, 2023\n\nAlix Summer has a successful podcast that features women who have overcome extreme difficulties and hardship, to lead happy and successful lives.\n\nAlix herself has a pretty good life too - a smart ultra modern home in London, two beautiful children, a husband that she loves - you get the picture, life’s pretty good in the main, although her husband Nathan does have a tendency to go on benders from time to time, which Alix finds worrying.\n\nWhilst celebrating her 45th birthday at the local pub with family and friends, Alix is approached by a woman in the restroom who introduces herself as Josie Fair and tells her that they’re ‘birthday twins’ as it’s her 45th birthday too.\n\nA few days later Josie approaches Alix as she’s waiting to pick her children up outside school, and says she’s been listening to her podcasts, and wants to know if Alix will feature her, not as a successful woman, but as a woman who has some dark secrets but is about to change her life completely.\n\nAfter much debating, Alix thinks she would make an interesting subject so she decides to give it a go. Bad choice! As Josie slowly integrates herself into Alix’s life, into her very home, she’ll discover that Josie isn’t exactly who she portrays herself to be.\n\nAs the podcast continues, some very disturbing facts begin to reveal themselves, and Alix realises that she’s made a big mistake!\n\nThere’s lots of tension, some great twists, together with some very dark and complex characters, as Ms Jewell expertly peels back the layers with consummate skill to reveal an intricate and twisted tale that’s such a worthy read.\n\n*Thank you to Netgalley and Random House UK, Cornerstone, Century for an ARC in exchange for an honest unbiased review\n\nSeptember 16, 2023\n\n3.75 stars\n\nhonestly, the title itself is basically a spoiler. so… that’s an interesting decision…\n\nbecause of this, the plot was not incredibly surprising and the plot twists were extremely mild/predictable… BUT all of it was unsettling and i enjoyed the vibe. i loved the documentary/podcast aspect of the book!\n\nnot a bad way to start spooky season. i’m very harsh on thrillers (i’m sorry!!) so a thriller above 3 stars is a winner in my book.\n\nJuly 25, 2023\n\nthank goodness this is finally over😩\n\ni'm well aware i'm in a minority here and i now know not to trust positive reviews so easily after experiencing this complete mess.. listen, idc how you try to spin it, but you can't make me sympathize with the groomer and a pedophile while portraying the minor as a villain in the situation, the whole attempt was utterly despicable and disgusting!\n\nmoving beyond the problematic content, the book was also painfully dull that it actually put me in a slump as i repeatedly picked it up and set it aside, ultimately losing all interest in the story, which, to begin with, didn't captivate me at all with how much it dragged. it felt like i was just waiting for something to happen the entire time, only to find that the outcome was predictable from the title alone🙄 i wouldn't even classify this as a thriller or mystery\n\nhonestly, fuck this book!\n\nJanuary 19, 2023\n\n4.5 rounded up\n\nJosie Fair and her much older husband Walter go to a gastropub to celebrate her 45th birthday. It’s not their usual style but hey, why not once in a while! In walks a blonde, well dressed, attractive ‘Birthday Queen’ and this proves to be podcaster Alix Summer with a big crowd including husband Nathan. It’s quiet and reserved versus noisy and effervescent energy, the proverbial chalk and cheese. Josie is mesmerised and fascinated and then she realises that Alix too is 45 today, they really are birthday twins! When Alix leaves her table and heads for the ladies, Josie follows…..The story unravels via alternating points of view and via a Netflix podcast/documentary entitled ‘ Hi! I’m your birthday twin’. This format works very well as it’s slickly and skilfully told in this experienced writers hands.\n\nThis is just soooo good that it is very hard to put down. The characterisation is excellent and I’m going to say little about either Alix or Josie as that is one of the joys of the book to discover for yourself! Your views on both of them undergo several U-turns via the plot revelations which makes for fascinating and at times, horrifying reading. One character in particular is a puzzling conundrum to say the very least!\n\nThe Netflix extracts are particularly powerful as they pile intrigue on intrigue, to say nothing of the building suspense. Things escalate to such a degree you find yourself furiously turning pages in disbelief and yes, there are some jaw droppers! If you add in bad vibes, off notes and some weird and uncomfortable situations that your reactions switch between sadness, concern and shock in equal measure. Oh boy, does the plot ever become intense with examples of dysfunction on a level that beggars belief. The plot twists, turns and barrels it’s way at a fast pace to a good ending which isn’t neatly sewn up but which feels real as, let’s face it, life frequently isn’t tied up in a pretty bow.\n\nOverall, this is a cracking read from a very accomplished author who sure understands how to entertain her readers.\n\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Random House U.K., Cornerstone for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nMy Reviews Can Also Be Found On:\n\nTwitter - Amazon - Storygraph - The Book Review Crew\n\n3.5 Stars\n\nThis is my sixth book by this author, she is obviously a favourite of mine and I had really high hopes for this one and it is getting rave reviews everywhere. I did enjoy it for the most part BUT the title is a spoiler for sure. The first two-thirds of the book was gripping and I would have given that five stars, but the last bit was anti-climatic.\n\nThe story itself is very immersive and it was a quick read that was easy to follow along. I even found the characters compelling, learning about their history and Josie's background. I didn't like the fact that one of them is the typical needy/oppressed housewife who envies and wants another's life, there are so many books like that out there. I also found that the character of Alix was just too easily manipulated by Josie.\n\nThe format was unique as it uses a podcast and a Netflix show as part of the story. And even though it was a huge letdown in the surprise department it was still a fun read. BUT after a very strong start, and me loving the short chapters the ending was kind of ambiguous and left me wanting more.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.\n\nAugust 9, 2023\n\n3.5⭐\n\nIn 2019, “Birthday Twins” Alix Summers and Josie Fair meet for the first time on their forty–fifth birthday in a pub where they have both come to celebrate- Alix with her husband and friends and Josie with her husband.\n\nJosie is curious to know more about Alix and looks her up on the internet and finds out that Alix is a popular podcaster known for sharing the stories of strong women who have overcome the odds to exact positive change in their lives. Josie approaches Alix with the idea of being a subject of her next podcast feature citing the fact that she is in the process of making big changes in her life. Alix is both intrigued and a tad unsettled by Josie’s intensity and eventually agrees. Josie’s revelations about her past and her marriage are shocking and Alix finds herself becoming inextricably drawn into Josie’s narrative. Alix begins to doubt some parts of Josie’s revelations when she talks to people who know her and have interacted with her in the past. Just how much of Josie’s story is true? Josie seems to be fixated on Alix and is curious about Alix’s marriage which is also somewhat troubled. What follows is a complex web of lies, deceit, manipulation and murder. All is revealed when Alix becomes the subject of a true crime podcast to be featured in a Netflix documentary in 2020.\n\nNone of This is True by Lisa Jewell is a masterfully crafted work of psychological fiction- the kind of dark, edgy and suspenseful story that makes Lisa Jewell one of my favorite authors in this genre. Complex characters, shocking twists and several surprises (till the very end) and an ending that leaves you unsettled, made for a riveting read. I loved the structure of the novel, which is presented from the perspectives of Josie and Alix with transcripts of the podcast interviews (featuring Josie, Alix and several other characters) interspersed throughout the narrative.\n\nHaving said that, there are a few things that keep me from giving this novel a higher rating. I know this is fiction and but a few things did bother me. None of the characters are particularly likeable (some worse than the others) which is fine. I know this is fiction but I could not ignore certain aspects of the story no matter how much I tried. Alix's inability to read the situation, her apparent blindness to several red flags in Josie’s behavior and her insensitivity to some extremely disturbing aspects of Josie’s life was off-putting. I also had issues with certain choices that were made in the handling of Josie’s present storyline. The author ventures into some very dark and disturbing themes in this novel (grooming, pedophilia, sexual abuse of a minor, trauma and mental health) and I’m not comfortable with the way those topics were presented.\n\nOverall, this is an intense and suspenseful read that delivers on the thrills. For the rest, it boils down to the reader’s ability and/or willingness to ignore certain aspects of the story.\n\nMany thanks to Atria Books and NetGalley for the digital review copy of this novel.

I’m Your Birthday Twin!\n\nA Documentary from Podcaster Alix Summer, Coming SOON to Netflix! (in the book)\n\nAlix Summer was celebrating her 45th birthday with a large group of friends at her local Pub, when she meets her birthday twin in the Ladies room-an unassuming woman called Josie Fair, who was quietly celebrating with just one older gentleman. Turns out they were both born on the same day, in the same year at the same hospital.\n\nAlix was known for a series of popular Podcasts called “All Woman” about successful local women, but it was time for something fresh and new. So when she “accidentally” bumps into her “birthday twin” again, a few days later, and Josie suggests that she might be an interesting subject, because Alix can follow her AS she changes her life instead of after someone has ALREADY done so, Alix decides to record a “test session” to see how it goes.\n\nA woman’s voice fades in…\n\nThe things that Josie begins to share are QUITE shocking, and like an accident you can’t look away from, Alix cannot stop listening.\n\nBUT-how much of it is true?\n\nWhat if, NONE OF IT WAS TRUE?\n\nAlix has now passed the point of no return, and because of this-her recordings, interspersed throughout the narrative, have just become part of a TRUE CRIME podcast and SHE is now its subject.\n\nWhat will the result be, when the final screen fades to black?\n\nWho is Josie Fair, and what has she really done?\n\nThere are TWO things you can ALWAYS count on with Lisa Jewell.\n\nFirst, if you handed me the first three chapters of a story in a binder, with no title and asked me to guess the author-I could identify her distinctive writing by her often QUIRKY and always well developed characters.\n\nAlthough our “host” Alix, is a likable mom, sister and wife-her husband, Nathan, has a bit of a drinking problem and often goes off on benders, not returning home until the next afternoon.\n\nAnd, we have Josie, the original subject of the Podcast, a shy woman who always dresses in denim, and who carries her Pomchi dog, Fred, clutched close to her chest in a denim pouch, his collar and lead, both made of denim too. (Don’t worry, no harm comes to Fred!)\n\nAnd, she isn’t the only peculiar one….\n\nIt’s always fun to meet her new characters\n\nBut, please be aware-Lisa Jewell is NOT AFRAID to go there!\n\nWARNING ⚠️ There IS an “ICK” factor to this book, and some of the subjects in the podcast include pedophiles, child abuse, and incest. (though thankfully, off page!)\n\nSo, if you are a Lisa Jewell fan-get ready!\n\nYou won’t be disappointed!\n\nAVAILABLE NOW!!\n\nThank You to Atria Books for my gifted copy provided through NetGalley! It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!\n\nDecember 17, 2023\n\n➳ 𝟒.𝟓/𝟓 𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙨\n\nThis book genuinely left me in a state of shock, no exaggeration. The plot twist hit me like a freight train, and after reading it, I found myself staring at my wall for a good five minutes, trying to process what I had just uncovered. The level of craft in both writing and plotting was truly impressive. I must admit, I thought I had the plot twist figured out, but man, I was so wrong. The actual twist took a completely different and, dare I say, terrifying turn. It's a testament to the author's skill in creating a narrative that keeps readers on the edge of their seats.\n\nNone of this is true is an enthralling psychological thriller that captivates you from the very first page until the gripping conclusion. The narrative unfolds as two distinct women, brought together by a chance encounter at a pub, discover they share the same birthday. This connection sparks a collaboration, leading them to embark on a fascinating podcast journey delving into the intriguing life of Josie Fair. The plot promises an intricate exploration of psychological twists and turns, ensuring readers remain hooked throughout the entirety of this compelling thriller.\n\n➳ 𝙅𝙤𝙨𝙞𝙚 𝙛𝙖𝙞𝙧\n\nMeet Josie Fair, a 45-year-old woman navigating the complexities of a marriage with a man twice her age, a mother to two daughters and a dog enthusiast. Dissatisfied with her current life, Josie desires a change, craving a life free of responsibilities. This quest leads her to Alix Summer, a renowned podcaster, where she sees an opportunity to share her intriguing life story and embark on a journey of reinvention.\n\n➳ 𝘼𝙡𝙞𝙭 𝙎𝙪𝙢𝙢𝙚𝙧\n\nAlix Summer, also 45, leads a life vastly different from Josie's. With her dream home and two lovely children, Alix is happily married, yet recent issues in her marriage leave her seeking a distraction. When Josie offers her the opportunity to explore this intriguing life story, Alix is intrigued and decides to embark on a podcast journey with her.\n\nUpon hearing Josie's life story, Alix becomes deeply affected by the traumatic experiences she endured, prompting sympathy and concern. In contrast, Josie takes an unsettling turn, becoming adamant about getting involved in Alix's life. This involvement escalates to stalking, stealing items from Alix's house, lurking around, critiquing her marriage, and manipulating her by portraying Alix's husband as worse than her own. The story takes a dark and intricate turn as the dynamics between the two women become increasingly complex.\n\nThe narrative shifts dramatically when Alix discovers Josie at her door one night, bearing signs of severe abuse. This unsettling encounter unveils a darker side to Josie, revealing not only her controlling nature but also a high level of manipulation. As the story unfolds, the layers of Josie's character are peeled back, exposing the intricacies of \"her very intriguing life story.\" The revelation sparks a tense and compelling journey into the depths of manipulation and control within the dynamics of their relationship.\n\n➳ Overall, this is the kind of story that lingers, imprinting itself in your thoughts and sending chills down your spine whenever it crosses your mind. Its impact is lasting, leaving a haunting impression that stays with you for a long time 🫶🏻\n\nJanuary 22, 2024\n\nthis is exactly how you write a thriller\n\nMarch 9, 2023\n\nDid it deliver???

This year is going to be no different!!! She killed it!! 👏👏👏 Perhaps her best yet!!! 🤫😍\n\nBirthday 🥳 twins 👯‍♀️…Umm I actually use that term… let’s just say … I might need to stop.. 😬… Holy fricking creepiness!! 😳 Two girls walk into a pub… Alix Summers… glitz and glamour… podcaster… she is quite the talk of the town… girl is 45🥳… and then… there is Josie… also in the pub… also turning 45…. but… there’s something about Josie… 🤔…something bizarre…she wears denim… ALL the time… heck her curtains are denim… look 👀.. I have nothing against denim but she is one odd duck!! 🦆\n\nAs Josie starts to stalk… oops 🤭.. I mean “run into” Alix… things get…. really… umm weird…😳… like lock 🔐 the door 🚪… put the house 🏡 up for sale weird!! The characters were fantastic… in classic @lisajewelluk fashion… they all were a little sketchy and had my mind working double time!! WHAT AN ENDING!!!

Have you read this? THOUGHTS??? Is this on your list??? What is your favorite @lisajewelluk book?\n\nThank you Atria books for my gifted copy!\n\nSeptember 12, 2023\n\nThe audio production was outstanding and with an ominous tone (5 star performance)!\n\nI lost track of how many times I nearly fell off the couch! Although, I could never get quite comfy. It is NOT a comfy kind of read. 🖤\n\nI had a sense of panic from the beginning when the \"birthday twins\" Alix and Josie unexpectantly meet. The story became darker than dark the further I read. It was quite unputdownable and going places that gave me anxiety. I think Alix felt it too, I wanted to shake her!! Tell her to just R-U-N 🏃‍♂️\n\nA slippery slope of truth! Who do I believe? Who will you believe? Everyone is flawed and makes questionable, even detestable decisions. The characters were mostly abhorrent and toxic.\n\nLets just pack all the toxicity into one novel shall we - a pedo, a narcissist, an alcoholic and a psycopath! The train wreck is coming at full speed. In the end though, I still wanted a little bit more after all the highs and lows, something was missing for me.\n\nI've made up my mind about the ending, and I hope I'll stop thinking about it now!\n\nLibrary Audio / Published on July 20, 2023\n\nAugust 19, 2023\n\nAll the stars! Hands-down, the best audio production of 2023!🙌\n\nJosie is out for her birthday dinner with husband Walter. At the next table is Alix, celebrating her birthday with her husband and friends as well. As Josie strike up a conversation in the ladies room she realizes not only were they born on the same day…but in the same hospital.\n\nWhat are the odds she’d come face to face with her birthday twin!👭\n\nSoon Josie enmeshes herself fully into Alix’s life. Even suggesting Alix, a famous podcaster, create a podcast all about Josie’s life.\n\nThis is where you need to start questioning what is truth and what is a lie! Good luck with that one!\n\nThe audio was brilliant! The two principal narrators did a thoroughly amazing job bringing Josie and Alix to vivid life. The supporting cast of narrators that lent their gifted voices to the ‘podcasts’ were phenomenal as well!\n\nThis book needs to be experienced in the audio format! My favorite Lisa Jewell book to date!\n\nAugust 27, 2023\n\n**Many thanks to NetGalley, Atria, and Lisa Jewell for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review! Now available as of 8.8!!**\n\nImagine you're at a birthday dinner with anyone close to you...a friend, a significant other, a few family members. And though you're thrilled to be there and order something special, there's a TINY part of you that is dreading the possibility that at any moment, a server (or a cadre of servers) are going to come your way carrying a cake and singing the obligatory Happy Birthday song (or the restaurant approved version, anyway.)\n\nAnd what if THAT dread was only the beginning?\n\nWhile podcaster Alix Summers is out with her husband to celebrate her 45th, after the big song, a woman named Josie approaches the table and informs her that she is her TRUE birthday twin---down to the year. Though Alix finds this surprising, the two go about their separate celebrations and she figures that will be the end of it. UNTIL Josie happens to run into Alix yet again - this time, outside of her children's school - and Josie has become completely enamored with Alix's podcast. In fact, she thinks she has the perfect candidate for Alix's next episode: Josie Fair herself.\n\nAll Josie tells Alix initially is that she's looking for a change and a fresh start in her life...but nothing can prepare Alix for the details to come. Josie reveals shocking secret after shocking secret about her dangerous past and even MORE dangerous present -- stories of grooming and abuse that haven't quite ended yet. Josie's predicament terrifies Alix...but at the same time, this mysterious and quirky woman slowly worms her way further into Alix's life...and her home.\n\nAlthough she wants to help her, Alix fears that this case may be far more involved than any she's explored in her podcast thus far. Will Josie's desperation to escape her situation lead her to say just about ANYTHING to get out, once and for all? And just how much of this 'true crime' tale is, well, TRUE?\n\nLisa Jewell has been around the scene for a while now: this is her ELEVENTH thriller after making the transition from romance novels. Even Jewell herself has said her thrillers follow a general trend: now and then timelines, unlikable characters, at LEAST one teenage POV...and there's often a big 'didn't know they were related' reveal. This formula has suited her well, and I've never doubted her ability to write a compelling narrative. Whether I agreed with the way it played out or not, despite occasional uneven pacing, I'm a Jewell fan through and through and also feel like I have a good sense of what to expect when I grab one of her books.\n\nWell. To say this one threw ALL of my preconceived notions out of the window COULD be the understatement of the YEAR!\n\nThis is a darker Jewell...a more DISTURBED Jewell...and in some ways it was everything I could have asked for in her evolution as an author. That being said, there were a few aspects of this plot that kept it from being a 5 star read for me and more than a few times I wished I could slowly back away from the characters in this book....and faster than Usain, BOLT! 🏃‍♂️\n\nFirst off, I am the last person to be excited by the premise of a true crime podcast/documentary/Netflix show etc. But WOWZA. If Jewell wanted to shelve novel writing and jump into screenwriting TOMORROW, I think she could do it. The Netflix show ABOUT the podcast is cleverly and neatly interspersed into the narrative, and I kid you not, every time one of these sections popped up, I could almost SEE the drama unfolding before me. Rather than a plot device, it felt like an evocative and intriguing way to leave a tiny trail of breadcrumbs throughout the story to keep you dying for more detail, more insight, and that next provocative interview. Needless to say, if this were a real Netflix documentary...UTTERLY bingeable.\n\nThese characters though...they might have been her most unlikable group to date. Even protagonist Alix has her blinders on selectively throughout and doesn't exactly do her due diligence with, well, anything. Josie is obviously a woman of mystery, but as a reader, I had a hard time buying her stories and suspected that a LOT was wrong with this situation (beyond the obvious). Nevertheless, I was excited to get to the bottom of things and had a hard time stopping myself from extrapolating endlessly as the novel wore on, with theory after theory about all of the players involved.\n\nBut then it's revealed, amidst a sea of lies, that one story was TRUE: a character involved in grooming a young woman really DID groom said teenager. And where this should have left another character horrified, it was basically brushed aside entirely because the same character is painted to be a \"good guy\" for other reasons. Not only is this not the first time Jewell has done this sort of thing, but it took what was SUCH a disturbing and powerful narrative to a sort of icky place. In a book that turns out to not be AS full of bad people as you may initially believe...there was no need for this turnaround. The character in question didn't really DESERVE any sort of redemptive mention or a 'pass' for the disgusting behavior...EVEN if someone else turns out to be worse, and I just wish that Jewell hadn't soured such a strong and impactful story with this choice.\n\nAt the end of a particularly sinister and AMAZING horror movie, I always have that moment where I'm GRATEFUL to leave the theater, blink in the sunlight, and feel part of the less ominous real world. This book took me to that same sort of deep, scary place...and while I did manage to enjoy most of the ride?\n\nI have NEVER been more relieved to pick up my sunglasses and bask in the warm comforting glow of the summer sun! 🕶 🌞\n\n4 stars\n\nSeptember 8, 2023\n\nLisa Jewell is the queen of the dark thriller!\n\nIf you are a sensitive reader, be aware there are trigger warnings galore, but know the events take place off the page.\n\nAnd what a tale it was…\n\nAlix Summer is a popular podcaster who is celebrating her 45th birthday when she meets Josie, also celebrating her 45th birthday. Birthday twins! How fun. (Or not!)\n\nJosie tells Alix she is about to make big changes in her life and wants Alix to document it for her podcast. Alix agrees, as this could be her big break. As the interviews unfold, we learn the secrets of both women.\n\nAlix’s life and marriage is far from perfect, and Josie likes to call her out on the situation. By the time Alix feels unease, Josie has wormed her way into Alix’s life and home, with repercussions that are unforeseeable and devastating.\n\nI enjoyed the alternating POV of both women which includes transcriptions of the podcast and scenes from a Netflix documentary on the case.\n\nThe reader knows this isn’t going to end well, but when the inevitable twist came, I had to pick my jaw off the floor…it was brilliant.\n\nMy reading buddy, Marialyce, and I had a fabulous discussion as we tried to suss out the ending. Who is truthful and who is not? For us, a story that is discussion worthy is the mark of a great read. All the stars! There is a LOT to unpack here.\n\nA winner for Lisa Jewell who has written a literary thriller of substance!\n\n* I received a digital copy of the book via NetGalley. All opinions are my own.\n\n*I also listened to it on audio, which was very well done!"
