The Huffington Post reports that Elizabeth Hurley and her husband Arun Nayar are divorcing after three years of marriage. However, Hurley disregarded one major precaution most celebrities take before marrying: having a pre-nuptial agreement.

Hurley could potentially lose a significant amount of her fortune because of this oversight. The British actress is said to have over £13 million (over $17 million USD), including a £4.3 million (approximately $5.7 million USD) mansion in South-West England as well as a £2.5 million (about $3.3 million USD) townhouse in London, which her ex-boyfriend Hugh Grant co-owns.

A source close to the soon-to-be divorced couple says that a pre-nuptial agreement would have been a deal breaker for Nayar.

It can be uncomfortable to discuss having a pre-nuptial agreement with your significant other before marriage. However, it can help both you and your future spouse plan ahead for unexpected events in the future, which is a wise thing to do, no matter a person’s social or economic standing, or whether they are a celebrity or not. Besides offering asset protection, a pre-nuptial agreement can also protect one spouse from the other’s separate debts. Additionally, the agreement can protect a spouse’s pension benefits and retirement funds from the other.

In the case of Elizabeth Hurley, when a spouse is wealthier than the other and no pre-nuptial agreement was made prior to the marriage, the spouse that is poorer can make a claim on a portion of the richer spouse’s money, or even demand to receive other assets such as a house.
