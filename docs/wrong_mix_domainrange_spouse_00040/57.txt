Elizabeth Hurley’s marriage to Arun Nayar is likely over.

The British model and actress and designer Tweeted Sunday, amid reports of her cheating on Nayar: “Not a great day. For the record, my husband Arun and I have separated as of few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware.”

Hurley’s announcement coincided with a scandalous report in Britain’s News of the World claiming her alleged affair with cricket player Shane Warne.

She and Nayar, an Indian businessman and textile heir, began dating in 2003 and got married in March 2007 at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, UK.

They exchanged vows in an Anglican ceremony before 300 guests. Days after the ceremony they threw a sumptuous week-long celebration in India.

Hurley has an 8-year-old son, Damian, with her ex Stephen Bing. She previously dated actor Hugh Grant for 13 years before splitting up in 2000.
