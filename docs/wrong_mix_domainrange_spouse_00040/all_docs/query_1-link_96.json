Born on September 9, 1960, in London, Grant was exposed to the arts at a young age. His mother was a schoolteacher and his father served in the British Army before becoming a carpet salesman. Grant's education at Oxford University, where he received a scholarship to study English literature, allowed him to hone his acting skills as he participated in student theater productions, setting the stage for a successful acting career. Grant's breakthrough came in 1987 when he starred in the Merchant Ivory drama Maurice, which earned him a Best Actor award at the Venice Film Festival. However, it was his role in the 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral that catapulted him to international stardom. The film was a global success, earning over $245 million worldwide, and Grant's performance won him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. This paved the way for a string of successful romantic comedies including Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary, and Love Actually, solidifying Grant's position as one of the leading men of the genre. Despite his early success in romantic comedies, Grant demonstrated his versatility by tackling diverse roles in films such as The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Florence Foster Jenkins, and the critically acclaimed miniseries A Very English Scandal. His portrayal of disgraced politician Jeremy Thorpe in the latter earned him a BAFTA and a Golden Globe nomination. Off-screen, Grant is noted for his advocacy work, particularly in media reform following his involvement in the UK phone hacking scandal. Throughout his career, Hugh Grant has proven to be not only a talented actor but also a dedicated advocate, making him a respected figure in both the entertainment industry and beyond.\n\nAge : 63\n\nBirthplace : Hammersmith, London, England, UK\n\nMatthew Perry, born on August 19, 1969, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, is a celebrated actor, comedian, and producer. He is best known for his role as the sarcastic Chandler Bing on the popular American sitcom Friends, which aired from 1994 to 2004, garnering him international fame and recognition. Perry's journey into acting began at a young age. Raised by his mother in Ottawa, Canada, after his parents' divorce, Perry developed an interest in tennis. However, his love for acting led him to leave his promising tennis career behind. His breakout moment came when he landed a role in the television series Second Chance in 1987. This was followed by several other TV appearances before hitting the jackpot with Friends. His performance in Friends earned him an Emmy nomination in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. Aside from his success in Friends, Perry also made a mark in the film industry. His notable film credits include Fools Rush In (1997), The Whole Nine Yards (2000), and its sequel The Whole Ten Yards (2004).
