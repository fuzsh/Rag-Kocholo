        "text": "The molecular structure of the borate mineral inderite Mg(H4B3O7)(OH) Â· 5H2O--a vibrational spectroscopic study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFrost, Ray L; LÃ³pez, AndrÃ©s; Xi, Yunfei; Lima, Rosa Malena Fernandes; Scholz, Ricardo; Granja, Amanda\n\n2013-12-01\n\nWe have undertaken a study of the mineral inderite Mg(H4B3O7)(OH) Â· 5H2O a hydrated hydroxy borate mineral of magnesium using scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetry and vibrational spectroscopic techniques. The structure consists of [Formula: see text] soroborate groups and Mg(OH)2(H2O)4 octahedra interconnected into discrete molecules by the sharing of two OH groups. Thermogravimetry shows a mass loss of 47.2% at 137.5 Â°C, proving the mineral is thermally unstable. Raman bands at 954, 1047 and 1116 cm(-1) are assigned to the trigonal symmetric stretching mode. The two bands at 880 and 916 cm(-1) are attributed to the symmetric stretching mode of the tetrahedral boron. Both the Raman and infrared spectra of inderite show complexity. Raman bands are observed at 3052, 3233, 3330, 3392 attributed to water stretching vibrations and 3459 cm(-1) with sharper bands at 3459, 3530 and 3562 cm(-1) assigned to OH stretching vibrations. Vibrational spectroscopy is used to assess the molecular structure of inderite. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Vibrational frequencies and intensities were also calculated for n=1 and 2 at the second-order MÃ¸ller-Plesset (MP2) level, to aid in the interpretation of the spectra, and at the singles and doubles coupled cluster (CCSD) level energies of n=1 isomers were computed at the MP2 geometries. The smaller clusters (n=1 to 3) were complexes of H2O ligands bound to a nitrosonium ion NO+ core. They possessed perturbed H2O stretch bands and dissociated by loss of H2O. The H2O antisymmetric stretch was absent in n=1 and gradually increased in intensity with n. In the n=4 clusters, we found evidence for the beginning of a second solvation shell as well as the onset of an intracluster reaction that formed HONO. These clusters exhibited additional weak, broad bands between 3200 and 3400 cm-1 and two new minor photodissociation channels, loss of HONO and loss of two H2O molecules. The reaction appeared to go to completion within the n=5 clusters. The primary dissociation channel was loss of HONO, and seven vibrational bands were observed. From an analysis of the spectrum, we concluded that the n=5 cluster rearranged to form H3O+(H2O)3(HONO), i.e., an adduct of the reaction products.\n\nStudy of the solvent effects on the molecular structure and Cdbnd O stretching vibrations of flurbiprofen\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTekin, Nalan; Pir, Hacer; Sagdinc, Seda\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe effects of 15 solvents on the C=O stretching vibrational frequency of flurbiprofen (FBF) were determined to investigate solvent-solute interactions. Solvent effects on the geometry and C=O stretching vibrational frequency, Î½(C=O), of FBF were studied theoretically at the DFT/B3LYP and HF level in combination with the polarizable continuum model and experimentally using attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR). The calculated C=O stretching frequencies in the liquid phase are in agreement with experimental values. Moreover, the wavenumbers of Î½(C=O) of FBF in different solvents have been obtained and correlated with the Kirkwood-Bauer-Magat equation (KBM), the solvent acceptor numbers (ANs), and the linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs). The solvent-induced stretching vibrational frequency shifts displayed a better correlation with the LSERs than with the ANs and KBM.\n\nVibrational mode frequencies of silica species in SiO2-H2O liquids and glasses from ab initio molecular dynamics.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSpiekermann, Georg; Steele-MacInnis, Matthew; Schmidt, Christian; Jahn, Sandro\n\n2012-04-21\n\nVibrational spectroscopy techniques are commonly used to probe the atomic-scale structure of silica species in aqueous solution and hydrous silica glasses. However, unequivocal assignment of individual spectroscopic features to specific vibrational modes is challenging. In this contribution, we establish a connection between experimentally observed vibrational bands and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) of silica species in solution and in hydrous silica glass. Using the mode-projection approach, we decompose the vibrations of silica species into subspectra resulting from several fundamental structural subunits: The SiO(4) tetrahedron of symmetry T(d), the bridging oxygen (BO) Si-O-Si of symmetry C(2v), the geminal oxygen O-Si-O of symmetry C(2v), the individual Si-OH stretching, and the specific ethane-like symmetric stretching contribution of the H(6)Si(2)O(7) dimer. This allows us to study relevant vibrations of these subunits in any degree of polymerization, from the Q(0) monomer up to the fully polymerized Q(4) tetrahedra. Demonstrating the potential of this approach for supplementing the interpretation of experimental spectra, we compare the calculated frequencies to those extracted from experimental Raman spectra of hydrous silica glasses and silica species in aqueous solution. We discuss observed features such as the double-peaked contribution of the Q(2) tetrahedral symmetric stretch, the individual Si-OH stretching vibrations, the origin of the experimentally observed band at 970 cm(-1) and the ethane-like vibrational contribution of the H(6)Si(2)O(7) dimer at 870 cm(-1).\n\nStretching dependence of the vibration modes of a single-molecule Pt-H-2-Pt bridge\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nDjukic, D.; Thygesen, Kristian Sommer; Untiedt, C.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nisotope substitution is obtained. The stretching dependence for each of the modes allows uniquely classifying them as longitudinal or transversal modes. The interpretation of the experiment in terms of a Pt-H-2-Pt bridge is verified by density-functional theory calculations for the stability, vibrational...\n\nThe dimers of glyoxal and acrolein with H 2O and HF: Negative intramolecular coupling and blue-shifted C-H stretch\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKarpfen, Alfred; Kryachko, Eugene S.\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe structures and the vibrational spectra of the hydrogen-bonded complexes: glyoxal-H 2O, glyoxal-HF, acrolein-H 2O, and acrolein-HF, are investigated within the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ computational approach. It is demonstrated that the calculated blue shifts of the C-H stretching frequencies in the glyoxal-H 2O complexes are only indirectly pertinent to hydrogen bonding to the C-H group. The comparison with the glyoxal-HF and the acrolein-HF complexes reveals that these blue shifts are a direct consequence of a negative intramolecular coupling between vicinal C dbnd O and C-H bonds in the aldehyde groups of isolated glyoxal and acrolein molecules. To support this interpretation, the halogen-bonded complexes glyoxal-BrF and acrolein-BrF are discussed.\n\nEffect of antisymmetric CâH stretching excitation on the dynamics of O({sup 1}D) + CH{sub 4} â OH + CH{sub 3}\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPan, Huilin; Yang, Jiayue; Zhang, Dong; Shuai, Quan; Jiang, Bo [State Key Laboratory of Molecular Reaction Dynamics, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning 116023 (China); Dai, Dongxu; Wu, Guorong, E-mail: wugr@dicp.ac.cn, E-mail: xmyang@dicp.ac.cn; Yang, Xueming, E-mail: wugr@dicp.ac.cn, E-mail: xmyang@dicp.ac.cn [State Key Laboratory of Molecular Reaction Dynamics, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Dalian, Liaoning 116023 (China); Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230026 (China)\n\n2014-04-21\n\nThe effect of antisymmetric CâH stretching excitation of CH{sub 4} on the dynamics and reactivity of the O({sup 1}D) + CH{sub 4} â OH + CD{sub 3} reaction at the collision energy of 6.10 kcal/mol has been investigated using the crossed-beam and time-sliced velocity map imaging techniques. The antisymmetric CâH stretching mode excited CH{sub 4} molecule was prepared by direct infrared excitation. From the measured images of the CH{sub 3} products with the infrared laser on and off, the product translational energy and angular distributions were derived for both the ground and vibrationally excited reactions. Experimental results show that the vibrational energy of the antisymmetric stretching excited CH{sub 4} reagent is channeled exclusively into the vibrational energy of the OH co-products and, hence, the OH products from the excited-state reaction are about one vibrational quantum hotter than those from the ground-state reaction, and the product angular distributions are barely affected by the vibrational excitation of the CH{sub 4} reagent. The reactivity was found to be suppressed by the antisymmetric stretching excitation of CH{sub 4} for all observed CH{sub 3} vibrational states. The degree of suppression is different for different CH{sub 3} vibrational states: the suppression is about 40%â60% for the ground state and the umbrella mode excited CH{sub 3} products, while for the CH{sub 3} products with one quantum symmetric stretching mode excitation, the suppression is much less pronounced. In consequence, the vibrational state distribution of the CH{sub 3} product from the excited-state reaction is considerably different from that of the ground-state reaction.\n\nVibrational Dynamics of Interfacial Water by Free Induction Decay Sum Frequency Generation (FID-SFG) at the Al2O3(1120)/H2O Interface.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBoulesbaa, Abdelaziz; Borguet, Eric\n\n2014-02-06\n\nThe dephasing dynamics of a vibrational coherence may reveal the interactions of chemical functional groups with their environment. To investigate this process at a surface, we employ free induction decay sum frequency generation (FID-SFG) to measure the time that it takes for free OH stretch oscillators at the charged (pH â 13, KOH) interface of alumina/water (Al2O3/H2O) to lose their collective coherence. By employing noncollinear optical parametric amplification (NOPA) technology and nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy, we showed that the single free OH peak actually corresponds to two distinct oscillators oriented opposite to each other and measured the total dephasing time, T2, of the free OH stretch modes at the Al2O3/H2O interface with a sub-40 fs temporal resolution. Our results suggested that the free OH oscillators associated with interfacial water dephase on the time scale of 89.4 Â± 6.9 fs, whereas the homogeneous dephasing of interfacial alumina hydroxyls is an order of magnitude slower.\n\nOn the origin of red and blue shifts of X-H and C-H stretching vibrations in formic acid (formate ion) and proton donor complexes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTÃ¢me Parreira, Renato Luis; Galembeck, SÃ©rgio Emanuel; Hobza, Pavel\n\n2007-01-08\n\nComplexes between formic acid or formate anion and various proton donors (HF, H(2)O, NH(3), and CH(4)) are studied by the MP2 and B3LYP methods with the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set. Formation of a complex is characterized by electron-density transfer from electron donor to ligands. This transfer is much larger with the formate anion, for which it exceeds 0.1 e. Electron-density transfer from electron lone pairs of the electron donor is directed into sigma* antibonding orbitals of X--H bonds of the electron acceptor and leads to elongation of the bond and a red shift of the X--H stretching frequency (standard H-bonding). However, pronounced electron-density transfer from electron lone pairs of the electron donor also leads to reorganization of the electron density in the electron donor, which results in changes in geometry and vibrational frequency. These changes are largest for the C--H bonds of formic acid and formate anion, which do not participate in H-bonding. The resulting blue shift of this stretching frequency is substantial and amounts to almost 35 and 170 cm(-1), respectively.\n\nComparing the effects of 3 weeks of upper-body vibration training, vibration and stretching, and stretching alone on shoulder flexibility in college-aged men.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFerguson, Steven L; Kim, Eonho; Seo, Dong-Il; Bemben, Michael G\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThis study compared the effects of 3 weeks of upper-body vibration training, vibration and stretching, and stretching alone on shoulder flexibility in college-aged men. Twenty-one men were randomly assigned to vibration-stretching (VS; n = 8), vibration only (VO; n = 6), or stretching only (SO; n = 7) groups that trained 3 times per week for 3 weeks. All 3 groups performed 9 total sets of 30-second stretches. The VS group performed four 30-second upper-body vibration exercises and five 30-second upper-body stretching exercises. The VO group performed nine 30-second upper-body vibration exercises. The SO group performed nine 30-second upper-body stretching exercises. Shoulder flexion (SF), shoulder extension (SE), and shoulder transverse extension (STE) were assessed by a Leighton Flexometer and back scratch tests bilaterally (BSR, BSL) were measured via tape measure. A 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) evaluated groups at baseline and a 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA evaluated the interventions over time. At baseline, there were no group differences in age, height, or weight. There was a significant (p alone or combined with stretching, is a viable alternative to a standard stretching routine when attempting to increase shoulder flexibility. Adding vibration training to a flexibility regimen may improve the likelihood of regularly performing flexibility sessions because of increased variety.\n\nThe acute effects of stretching with vibration on dynamic flexibility in young female gymnasts.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJohnson, Aaron W; Warcup, Caisa N; Seeley, Matthew K; Eggett, Dennis; Feland, Jeffery B\n\n2018-01-10\n\nWhile stretching with vibration has been shown to improve static flexibility; the effect of stretching with vibration on dynamic flexibility is not well known. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of stretching with vibration on acute dynamic flexibility and jump height in novice and advanced competitive female gymnasts during a split jump. Female gymnast (n=27, age: 11.5 Â± 1.7 years, Junior Olympic levels 5-10) participated in this cross-over study. Dynamic flexibility during gymnastic split jumps were video recorded and analyzed with Dartfish software. All participants completed both randomized stretching protocols with either the vibration platform turned on (VIB) (frequency of 30 Hz and 2 mm amplitude) or off (NoVIB) separated by 48 h. Participants performed 4 sets of three stretches on the vibration platform. Each stretch was held for 30 s with 5 s rest for a total of 7 min of stretch. Split jump flexibility decreased significantly from pre to post measurement in both VIB (-5.8Â°Â±5.9Â°) (p<0.001) and NoVIB (-2.6Â°Â±6.1Â°) (p=0.041) conditions (adjusted for gymnast level). This effect was greatest in lower skill level gymnasts (p=0.003), while the highest skill level gymnasts showed no significant decrease in the split jump (p=0.105). Jump height was not significantly different between conditions (p=0.892) or within groups (p=0.880). An acute session of static stretching with or without vibration immediately before performance does not alter jump height. Stretching with vibration immediately prior to gymnastics competition decreases split jump flexibility in lower level gymnasts more than upper level gymnasts.\n\nTheoretical study of the changes in the vibrational characteristics arising from the hydrogen bonding between Vitamin C ( L-ascorbic acid) and H 2O\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDimitrova, Yordanka\n\n2006-02-01\n\nThe vibrational characteristics (vibrational frequencies, infrared intensities and Raman activities) for the hydrogen-bonded system of Vitamin C ( L-ascorbic acid) with five water molecules have been predicted using ab initio SCF/6-31G(d, p) calculations and DFT (BLYP) calculations with 6-31G(d, p) and 6-31++G(d, p) basis sets. The changes in the vibrational characteristics from free monomers to a complex have been calculated. The ab initio and BLYP calculations show that the complexation between Vitamin C and five water molecules leads to large red shifts of the stretching vibrations for the monomer bonds involved in the hydrogen bonding and very strong increase in their IR intensity. The predicted frequency shifts for the stretching vibrations from Vitamin C taking part in the hydrogen bonding are up to -508 cm -1. The magnitude of the wavenumber shifts is indicative of relatively strong OHÂ·Â·Â·H hydrogen-bonded interactions. In the same time the IR intensity and Raman activity of these vibrations increase upon complexation. The IR intensity increases dramatically (up to 12 times) and Raman activity increases up to three times. The ab initio and BLYP calculations show, that the symmetric OH vibrations of water molecules are more sensitive to the complexation. The hydrogen bonding leads to very large red shifts of these vibrations and very strong increase in their IR intensity. The asymmetric OH stretching vibrations of water, free from hydrogen bonding are less sensitive to the complexation than the hydrogen-bonded symmetric O sbnd H stretching vibrations. The increases of the IR intensities for these vibrations are lower and red shifts are negligible.\n\nDynamics of the OH stretching mode in crystalline Ba(ClO4)2.3H2O\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHutzler, Daniel; Brunner, Christian; Petkov, Petko St.; Heine, Thomas; Fischer, Sighart F.; Riedle, Eberhard; Kienberger, Reinhard; Iglev, Hristo\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe vibrational dynamics of the OH stretching mode in Ba(ClO4)2 trihydrate are investigated by means of femtosecond infrared spectroscopy. The sample offers plane cyclic water trimers in the solid phase that feature virtually no hydrogen bond interaction between the water molecules. Selective excitation of the symmetric and asymmetric stretching leads to fast population redistribution, while simultaneous excitation yields quantum beats, which are monitored via a combination tone that dominates the overtone spectrum. The combination of steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy with quantum chemical simulations and general theoretical considerations gives indication of various aspects of symmetry breakage. The system shows a joint population lifetime of 8 ps and a long-lived coherence between symmetric and asymmetric stretching, which decays with a time constant of 0.6 ps.\n\nTorsion-inversion tunneling patterns in the CH-stretch vibrationally excited states of the G12 family of molecules including methylamine.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDawadi, Mahesh B; Bhatta, Ram S; Perry, David S\n\n2013-12-19\n\nTwo torsion-inversion tunneling models (models I and II) are reported for the CH-stretch vibrationally excited states in the G12 family of molecules. The torsion and inversion tunneling parameters, h(2v) and h(3v), respectively, are combined with low-order coupling terms involving the CH-stretch vibrations. Model I is a group theoretical treatment starting from the symmetric rotor methyl CH-stretch vibrations; model II is an internal coordinate model including the local-local CH-stretch coupling. Each model yields predicted torsion-inversion tunneling patterns of the four symmetry species, A, B, E1, and E2, in the CH-stretch excited states. Although the predicted tunneling patterns for the symmetric CH-stretch excited state are the same as for the ground state, inverted tunneling patterns are predicted for the asymmetric CH-stretches. The qualitative tunneling patterns predicted are independent of the model type and of the particular coupling terms considered. In model I, the magnitudes of the tunneling splittings in the two asymmetric CH-stretch excited states are equal to half of that in the ground state, but in model II, they differ when the tunneling rate is fast. The model predictions are compared across the series of molecules methanol, methylamine, 2-methylmalonaldehyde, and 5-methyltropolone and to the available experimental data.\n\n2D heterodyne-detected sum frequency generation study on the ultrafast vibrational dynamics of H{sub 2}O and HOD water at charged interfaces\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nInoue, Ken-ichi; Singh, Prashant C.

In contrast, 2D HD-VSFG spectrum of the CTAB/H{sub 2}O interface at 0.0 ps clearly shows two diagonal peaks and their cross peaks in the bleaching region, corresponding to the double peaks observed at 3230 cm{sup â1} and 3420 cm{sup â1} in the steady-state HD-VSFG spectrum. Horizontal slices of the 2D spectrum show that the relative intensity of the two peaks of the bleaching at the CTAB/H{sub 2}O interface gradually change with the change of the pump frequency. We simulate the pump-frequency dependence of the bleaching feature using a model that takes account of the Fermi resonance and inhomogeneity of the OH stretch vibration, and the simulated spectra reproduce the essential features of the 2D HD-VSFG spectra of the CTAB/H{sub 2}O interface. The present study demonstrates that heterodyne detection of the time-resolved VSFG is critically important for studying the ultrafast dynamics of water interfaces and for unveiling the underlying mechanism.\n\nMULTIMODE quantum calculations of vibrational energies and IR spectrum of the NO+(H2O) cluster using accurate potential energy and dipole moment surfaces\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHomayoon, Zahra\n\n2014-09-01\n\nA new, full (nine)-dimensional potential energy surface and dipole moment surface to describe the NO+(H2O) cluster is reported.

Mode coupling of the water \"antisymmetric\" stretching mode with the low-frequency intermolecular modes results in intensity borrowing.\n\nMULTIMODE quantum calculations of vibrational energies and IR spectrum of the NO+(H2O) cluster using accurate potential energy and dipole moment surfaces\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHomayoon, Zahra\n\n2014-01-01\n\nA new, full (nine)-dimensional potential energy surface and dipole moment surface to describe the NO + (H 2 O) cluster is reported.

Such mode specificity provides insights into the transition-state modulation of reactivity and might be used to control chemical reactions. We report here a state-of-the-art full-dimensional quantum dynamical study of the hydrogen abstraction reaction H + NH3 â H2 + NH2 on an accurate ab initio based global potential energy surface. This reaction serves as an ideal candidate to study the relative efficacies of symmetric and degenerate antisymmetric stretching modes. Strong mode specificity, particularly for the NH3 stretching modes, is demonstrated. It is further shown that nearly identical efficacies of the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching modes of NH3 in promoting the reaction can be understood in terms of local-mode stretching vibrations of the reactant molecule.\n\nIR and Raman spectra of LaH(SeO3)2 and FeH(SeO3)2\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRatheesh, R.; Suresh, G.; Nayar, V.U.; Morris, R.E.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe infrared and Raman spectra of LaH(SeO 3 ) 2 and FeH(SeO 3 ) 2 crystals are recorded and analysed. Bands confirm the coexistence of HSeO 3 - and SeO 3 2- ions in both LaH(SeO 3 ) 2 and FeH(SeO 3 ) 2 crystals. The Se-OH stretching vibrations are observed to be at lower wavenumbers in LaH(SeO 3 ) 2 than that in the iron compound in agreement with the short O-O distance in the former. Observed bands indicate that the SeO 3 2- ions are more angularly distorted in FeH(SeO 3 ) 2 crystal. ABC bands, characteristic of strong hydrogen bonded systems are observed in the infrared spectra of both the crystals.

The thermal analysis of datolite shows a mass loss of 5.83% over a 700-775 Â°C temperature range. This mass loss corresponds to 1 water (H2O) molecules pfu. A quantitative chemical analysis using electron probe was undertaken. The Raman spectrum of datolite is characterized by bands at 917 and 1077 cm-1 assigned to the symmetric stretching modes of BO and SiO tetrahedra. A very intense Raman band is observed at 3498 cm-1 assigned to the stretching vibration of the OH units in the structure of datolite. BOH out-of-plane vibrations are characterized by the infrared band at 782 cm-1. The vibrational spectra are based upon the structure of datolite based on sheets of four- and eight-membered rings of alternating SiO4 and BO3(OH) tetrahedra with the sheets bonded together by calcium atoms.\n\nVibrational spectroscopy of NO^+(H_2O)_n: Evidence for the intracluster reaction NO^+(H_2O)_nâH_3O^+(H_2O)_(n-2)(HONO) at nâ¥4\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nChoi, Jong-Ho; Kuwata, Keith T.; Haas, Bernd-Michael; Cao, Yibin; Johnson, Matthew S.; Okumura, Mitchio\n\n1994-01-01\n\nInfrared spectra of massâselected clusters NO^+(H_2O)_n for n=1 to 5 were recorded from 2700 to 3800 cm^(â1) by vibrational predissociation spectroscopy.

ILs based on 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation with different anions, OH(-), CF(3)CO(2)(-), HSO(4)(-), H(2)PO(4)(-), Cl(-), PF(6)(-), and BF(4)(-), are investigated in the present work. It has been shown that the C(2)-H stretching vibration of the imidazolium ring is closely related to the electron density of H-bonding between the two closest cations and anions for pure ILs. The electron density of H-bonding between cation and anion with different anions decreases in the order [OH](-) > [H(2)PO(4)](-) > [HSO(4)](-) > [CF(3)CO(2)](-) > [Cl](-) > [BF(4)](-) > [PF(6)](-). For aqueous ILs, with increasing water content, the aromatic C-H stretching vibration of the imidazolium cation showed systematic blue-shifts. Especially for BmimOH, the nu(C(2))(-H) undergoes a drastic blue-shift by 58 cm(-1), suggesting that the formation of the strong hydrogen bonds O-H...O may greatly weaken the electron density of H-bonding between the cation and anion of ILs.\n\nMULTIMODE quantum calculations of vibrational energies and IR spectrum of the NO{sup +}(H{sub 2}O) cluster using accurate potential energy and dipole moment surfaces\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHomayoon, Zahra, E-mail: zhomayo@emory.edu [Cherry L. Emerson Center for Scientific Computation and Department of Chemistry, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322 (United States)\n\n2014-09-28\n\nA new, full (nine)-dimensional potential energy surface and dipole moment surface to describe the NO{sup +}(H{sub 2}O) cluster is reported. The PES is based on fitting of roughly 32â000 CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ electronic energies. The surface is a linear least-squares fit using a permutationally invariant basis with Morse-type variables. The PES is used in a Diffusion Monte Carlo study of the zero-point energy and wavefunction of the NO{sup +}(H{sub 2}O) and NO{sup +}(D{sub 2}O) complexes. Using the calculated ZPE the dissociation energies of the clusters are reported. Vibrational configuration interaction calculations of NO{sup +}(H{sub 2}O) and NO{sup +}(D{sub 2}O) using the MULTIMODE program are performed. The fundamental, a number of overtone, and combination states of the clusters are reported. The IR spectrum of the NO{sup +}(H{sub 2}O) cluster is calculated using 4, 5, 7, and 8 modes VSCF/CI calculations. The anharmonic, coupled vibrational calculations, and IR spectrum show very good agreement with experiment. Mode coupling of the water âantisymmetricâ stretching mode with the low-frequency intermolecular modes results in intensity borrowing.\n\nApplication of comparative vibrational spectroscopic and mechanistic studies in analysis of fisetin structure\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDimitriÄ MarkoviÄ, Jasmina M.; MarkoviÄ, Zoran S.; MilenkoviÄ, Dejan; JeremiÄ, Svetlana\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThis paper addresses experimental and theoretical research in fisetin (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroxychromen-4-one) structure by means of experimental IR and Raman spectroscopies and mechanistic calculations. Density Functional Theory calculations, with M05-2X functional and the 6-311+G (2df, p) basis set implemented in the Gaussian 09 package, are performed with the aim to support molecular structure, vibrational bands' positions and their intensities. Potential energy distribution (PED) values and the description of the largest vibrational contributions to the normal modes are calculated. The most intense bands appear in the 1650-1500 cm -1 wavenumber region. This region involves a combination of the C dbnd O, C2 dbnd C3 and C-C stretching vibrational modes. Most of the bands in the 1500-1000 cm -1 range involve C-C stretching, O-C stretching and in-plane C-C-H, C-O-H, C-C-O and C-C-C bending vibrations of the rings. The region below 1000 cm -1 is characteristic to the combination of in plane C-C-C-H, H-C-C-H, C-C-C-C, C-C-O-C and out of plane O-C-C-C, C-C-O-C, C-C-C-C torsional modes.

Several initial guess structures are considered for each size of cluster to locate the global minimum-energy structure by applying a Monte Carlo simulated annealing procedure including spin-orbit interaction. In the Raman spectrum, hydration reduces the intensity of the I-I stretching band but enhances the intensity of the O-H stretching band of water. Raman spectra of more highly hydrated clusters appear to be simpler than the corresponding IR spectra. Vibrational bands due to simultaneous stretching vibrations of O-H bonds in a cyclic water network are observed for I(2)(*-) x n H(2)O clusters with n > or = 3. The vertical detachment energy (VDE) profile shows stepwise saturation that indicates closing of the geometrical shell in the hydrated clusters on addition of every four water molecules. The calculated VDE of finite-size small hydrated clusters is extrapolated to evaluate the bulk VDE value of I(2)(*-) in aqueous solution as 7.6 eV at the CCSD(T) level of theory. Structure and spectroscopic properties of these hydrated clusters are compared with those of hydrated clusters of Cl(2)(*-) and Br(2)(*-).\n\nApplication of comparative vibrational spectroscopic and mechanistic studies in analysis of fisetin structure.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDimitriÄ MarkoviÄ, Jasmina M; MarkoviÄ, Zoran S; MilenkoviÄ, Dejan; JeremiÄ, Svetlana\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThis paper addresses experimental and theoretical research in fisetin (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroxychromen-4-one) structure by means of experimental IR and Raman spectroscopies and mechanistic calculations.

In addition, intermolecular dynamical calculations are performed in full 5D on the recent ab initio intermolecular potential of Valiron et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 129, 134306 (2008)] in order to further elucidate the identity of the infrared transitions detected. Excellent agreement is achieved between experimental and theoretical spectral predictions for the most strongly bound van der Waals complex consisting of ortho (I = 1) H(2) and ortho (I = 1) H(2)O (oH(2)-oH(2)O). Specifically, two distinct bands are seen in the oH(2)-oH(2)O spectrum, corresponding to internal rotor states in the upper vibrational manifold of Î£ and Î rotational character. However, none of the three other possible nuclear spin modifications (pH(2)-oH(2)O, pH(2)-pH(2)O, or oH(2)-pH(2)O) are observed above current signal to noise level, which for the pH(2) complexes is argued to arise from displacement by oH(2) in the expansion mixture to preferentially form the more strongly bound species. Direct measurement of oH(2)-oH(2)O vibrational predissociation in the time domain reveals lifetimes of 15(2) ns and <5(2) ns for the Î£ and Î states, respectively. Theoretical calculations permit the results to be interpreted in terms of near resonant energy levels and intermolecular alignment of the H(2) and H(2)O wavefunctions, providing insight into predissociation dynamical pathways from these metastable levels.\n\nVibrational spectroscopic study of poldervaartite CaCa[SiO3(OH)(OH)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFrost, Ray L.; LÃ³pez, AndrÃ©s; Scholz, Ricardo; Lima, Rosa Malena Fernandes\n\n2015-02-01\n\nWe have studied the mineral poldervaartite CaCa[SiO3(OH)(OH)] which forms a series with its manganese analogue olmiite CaMn[SiO3(OH)](OH) using a range of techniques including scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman and infrared spectroscopy. Chemical analysis shows the mineral is reasonably pure and contains only calcium and manganese with low amounts of Al and F. Thermogravimetric analysis proves the mineral decomposes at 485 Â°C with a mass loss of 7.6% compared with the theoretical mass loss of 7.7%. A strong Raman band at 852 cm-1 is assigned to the SiO stretching vibration of the SiO3(OH) units. Two Raman bands at 914 and 953 cm-1 are attributed to the antisymmetric vibrations. Intense prominent peaks observed at 3487, 3502, 3509, 3521 and 3547 cm-1 are assigned to the OH stretching vibration of the SiO3(OH) units. The observation of multiple OH bands supports the concept of the non-equivalence of the OH units. Vibrational spectroscopy enables a detailed assessment of the molecular structure of poldervaartite.\n\nMolecular dynamics simulation based on the multi-component molecular orbital method: Application to H5O2+,D5O2+,andT5O2+\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIshimoto, Takayoshi; Koyama, Michihisa\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGraphical abstract: Molecular dynamics method based on multi-component molecular orbital method was applied to basic hydrogen bonding systems, H 5 O 2 + , and its isotopomers (D 5 O 2 + andT 5 O 2 + ).

The MC M O based MD (MC M O-MD) method is applied to the basic structures, H 5 O 2 + (called âZundel ionâ), and its isotopomers (D 5 O 2 + andT 5 O 2 + ). We clearly demonstrate the geometrical difference of hydrogen bonded O â¯ O distance induced by H/D/T isotope effect because the O â¯ O in H-compound was longer than that in D- or T-compound. We also find the strong relation between stretching vibration of O â¯ O and the distribution of hydrogen bonded protonic wavefunction because the protonic wavefunction tends to delocalize when the O â¯ O distance becomes short during the dynamics. Our proposed MC M O-MD simulation is expected as a powerful tool to analyze the proton dynamics in hydrogen bonding systems.\n\nLocal-mode vibrations of water\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLawton, R.T.; Child, M.S.

J.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nAbsolute infrared intensities are predicted for the vibrational bands of gas-phase H2O2 by the use of a hydrogen atomic polar tensor transferred from the hydroxyl hydrogen atom of CH3OH. These predicted intensities are compared with intensities predicted by the use of a hydrogen atomic polar tensor transferred from H2O. The predicted relative intensities agree well with published spectra of gas-phase H2O2, and the predicted absolute intensities are expected to be accurate to within at least a factor of two. Among the vibrational degrees of freedom, the antisymmetric O-H bending mode nu(6) is found to be the strongest with a calculated intensity of 60.5 km/mole. The torsional band, a consequence of hindered rotation, is found to be the most intense fundamental with a predicted intensity of 120 km/mole. These results are compared with the recent absolute intensity determinations for the nu(6) band.\n\nIntramolecular Vibrational Energy Transfer and Bond-Selected Photochemistry in Liquids\n\nNational Research Council Canada - National Science Library\n\nCrim, F\n\n2001-01-01\n\n....

The aim was to show how differences in the chemical composition and/or in the topology of the zeolite framework and, in particular, the possibility for the guest water molecules to develop guest-guest and/or host-guest interactions, lead to substantial differences in their vibrational dynamical properties. The spectra, collected in the O-H stretching and H 2 O bending mode regions, are complex, with multiple bands being observed. As far as water in the CHA and LTA frameworks is concerned, whose behaviour is governed by the balance of water-water, water-framework and water-extra-framework cations interactions, the assignment of the resolved components of the O-H stretching band has been discussed by fitting the band shapes into individual components attributed to H 2 O molecules engaged in different degrees of hydrogen bonding. A detailed quantitative picture of the connectivity pattern of water, as a function of temperature and according to the chemical and topological properties of the environment, is furnished. The H 2 O bending vibrational bands give additional information that perfectly agrees with the results obtained from the analysis of the O-H stretching spectral region. In the case of scolecite, a small-pored zeolite where water-water interactions are eliminated, the increased complexity observed in the infrared spectra in the O-H stretching and H 2 O bending regions was explained as due to the hydrogen bonding between the water molecules and the network, and also with the extra-framework cation. Furthermore, these observations have been correlated with the different\n\nInfrared and Raman spectroscopic characterizations on new Fe sulphoarsenate hilarionite (Fe2(III)(SO4)(AsO4)(OH)Â·6H2O): Implications for arsenic mineralogy in supergene environment of mine area\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiu, Jing; He, LiLe; Dong, Faqin; Frost, Ray L.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHilarionite (Fe2 (SO4)(AsO4)(OH)Â·6H2O) is a new Fe sulphoarsenates mineral, which recently is found in the famous Lavrion ore district, Atliki Prefecture, Greece. The spectroscopic study of hilarionite enriches the data of arsenic mineralogy in supergene environment of a mine area. The infrared and Raman means are used to characterize the molecular structure of this mineral. The IR bands at 875 and 905 cm- 1 are assigned to the antisymmetric stretching vibrations of AsO43 -. The IR bands at 1021, 1086 and 1136 cm- 1 correspond to the possible antisymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of SO42 -. The Raman bands at 807, 843 and 875 cm- 1 clearly show that arsenate components in the mineral structure, which are assigned to the symmetric stretching vibrations (Î½1) of AsO43 - (807 and 843 cm- 1) and the antisymmetric vibration (Î½3) (875 cm- 1). IR bands provide more sulfate information than Raman, which can be used as the basis to distinguish hilarionite from kaÅkite. The powder XRD data shows that hilarionite has obvious differences with the mineral structure of kaÅkite. The thermoanalysis and SEM-EDX results show that hilarionite has more sulfate than arsenate.\n\nVibrational spectroscopy and intramolecular energy transfer in isocyanic acid (HNCO)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCoffey, M.J.; Berghout, H.L.; Woods, E. III; Crim, F.F.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nRoom temperature photoacoustic spectra in the region of the first through the fourth overtones (2Î½ 1 to 5Î½ 1 ) and free-jet action spectra of the second through the fourth overtones (3Î½ 1 to 5Î½ 1 ) of the N - H stretching vibration permit analysis of the vibrational and rotational structure of HNCO. The analysis identifies the strong intramolecular couplings that control the early stages of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) and gives the interaction matrix elements between the zero-order N - H stretching states and the other zero-order states with which they interact. The experimentally determined couplings and zero-order state separations are consistent with ab initio calculations of East, Johnson, and Allen [J. Chem. Phys. 98, 1299 (1993)], and comparison with the calculation identifies the coupled states and likely interactions. The states most strongly coupled to the pure N - H stretching zero-order states are ones with a quantum of N - H stretching excitation (Î½ 1 ) replaced by different combinations of N - C - O asymmetric or symmetric stretching excitation (Î½ 2 or Î½ 3 ) and trans-bending excitation (Î½ 4 ). The two strongest couplings of the nÎ½ 1 state are to the states (n-1)Î½ 1 +Î½ 2 +Î½ 4 and (n-1)Î½ 1 +Î½ 3 +2Î½ 4 , and sequential couplings through a series of low order resonances potentially play a role. The analysis shows that if the pure N - H stretch zero-order state were excited, energy would initially flow out of that mode into the strongly coupled mode in 100 fs to 700 fs, depending on the level of initial excitation. copyright 1999 American Institute of Physics\n\nInfrared spectra and stability of CO and H2O sorption over Ag-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite: DFT study\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJiang Shujun; Huang Shiping; Tu Weixia; Zhu Jiqin\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe infrared spectra and stability of CO and H 2 O sorption over Ag-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite were investigated by using density function theory (DFT). The changes of NBO charge show that the electron transfers from CO molecule to the Ag + cation to form an Ï-bond, and it accompanies by the back donation of d-electrons from Ag + cation to the CO (Ï*) orbital as one and two CO molecules are adsorbed on Ag-ZSM-5. The free energy changes ÎG, -5.55 kcal/mol and 6.52 kcal/mol for one and two CO molecules, illustrate that the Ag + (CO) 2 complex is unstable at the room temperature. The vibration frequency of C-O stretching of one CO molecule bonded to Ag + ion at 2211 cm -1 is in good agreement with the experimental results. The calculated C-O symmetric and antisymmetric stretching frequencies in the Ag + (CO) 2 complex shift to 2231 cm -1 and 2205 cm -1 when the second CO molecule is adsorbed. The calculated C-O stretching frequency in CO-Ag-ZSM-5-H 2 O complex shifts to 2199 cm -1 , the symmetric and antisymmetric O-H stretching frequencies are 3390 cm -1 and 3869 cm -1 , respectively. The Gibbs free energy change (ÎG H 2 O ) is -6.58 kcal/mol as a H 2 O molecule is adsorbed on CO-Ag-ZSM-5 complex at 298 K.

The hydrogen atom in D 2 O ice lattice has three distinguished vibrations: two modes normal to the O---H bond at lower frequency and a stretching mode along the O-H bond at higher frequency. For different ice phases these frequencies are different, it was found that the lower defect mode is at â¼97 meV for ice-II, at about 95 meV for hda-ice and ice-VIII, and they are all lower than the value of 105 meV for ice-Ih. The O-H stretching modes are at 415 meV for ice-II, at 418 meV for hda-ice, and at 425 meV for ice-VIII, which all are much larger than the value for ice-Ih, 406 meV. It was also found that O-D stretching modes in D 2 O ice-VIII is centered at â¼320 meV which is significantly higher than the corresponding value of â¼305 meV for ice-Ih\n\nOn the intramolecular origin of the blue shift of A-H stretching frequencies: triatomic hydrides HAX.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKarpfen, Alfred; Kryachko, Eugene S\n\n2009-04-30\n\nA series of intermolecular complexes formed between the triatomic hydrides HAX and various interaction partners are investigated computationally aiming (1) to demonstrate that either an appearance or nonappearance of a blue shift of the A-H stretching frequency is directly related to the sign of the intramolecular coupling that exists between the two degrees of freedom, the A-H and A-X bond lengths, and (2) to offer the following conjecture: the theoretical protonation of a triatomic neutral molecule HAX at the site X is a simple and rather efficient probe of a red or blue shift that the stretching frequency nu(A-H) undergoes upon complex formation regardless of whether this bond is directly involved in hydrogen bonding or not. In other words, to predict whether this A-H bond is capable to display a blue or red shift of nu(A-H), it suffices to compare the equilibrium structures and vibrational spectra of a given molecule with its protonated counterpart. The two above goals are achieved invoking a series of 11 triatomic molecules: HNO, HSN, HPO, and HPS characterized by a negative intramolecular coupling; HON and HNS as intermediate cases; and HOF, HOCl, HCN, HNC, and HCP with a positive intramolecular coupling. For these purposes, the latter molecules are investigated at the MP2/6-311++G(2p,2d) level in the neutral and protonated HAXH(+) forms as well as their complexes with H(2)O and with the fluoromethanes H(3)CF, H(2)CF(2), and HCF(3).\n\nQuantum-mechanical study of energies, structures, and vibrational spectra of the H(D)Cl complexed with dimethyl ether\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBoda, Åukasz, E-mail: lboda@chemia.uj.edu.pl; Boczar, Marek; GÅug, Maciej; WÃ³jcik, Marek J.

Equilibrium and vibrationally averaged structures, harmonic and anharmonic wavenumbers of the complex and its deuterated isotopomer were calculated using harmonic and anharmonic second-order perturbation theory procedures with Density Functional Theory B3LYP and B2PLYP-D and ab initio MÃ¸ller-Plesset second-order methods, and a 6-311++G(3d,3p) basis set. A phenomenological model describing anharmonic-type vibrational couplings within hydrogen bonds was developed to explain the unique broadening and fine structure, as well as the isotope effect of the ClâH and ClâD stretching IR absorption bands in the gaseous complexes with dimethyl ether, as an effect of hydrogen bond formation. Simulations of the rovibrational structure of the ClâH and ClâD stretching bands were performed and the results were compared with experimental spectra.\n\nProton conducting system (ImH2)2SeO4Â·2H2O investigated with vibrational spectroscopy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZiÄba, Sylwia; Mizera, Adam; Pogorzelec-Glaser, Katarzyna; ÅapiÅski, Andrzej\n\n2017-06-01\n\nImidazolium selenate dihydrate (ImH2)2SeO4Â·2H2O crystals have been investigated using Raman and IR spectroscopy. Experimental data were supported by the quantum-chemical calculations (DFT), Hirshfield surfaces and fingerprint plots analysis, and Bader theory calculations. The imidazolium selenate dihydrate crystal exhibits high proton conductivity of the order of 10- 1 S/m at T = 333 K. The spectra of this compound are dominated by bands related to the lattice modes, the internal vibrations of the protonated imidazole cation, selenate anion, water molecules, and hydrogen bonds network. For the imidazolium selenate dihydrate crystal, the formal classification of the fundamental modes has been carried out.\n\nBandshapes in vibrational spectroscopy\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDijkman, F.G.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nA detailed account is given of the development of modern bandshape theories since 1965. An investigation into the relative contributions of statistical irreversible relaxation processes is described, for a series of molecules in which gradually the length of one molecular axis is increased. An investigation into the theoretical and experimental investigation of the broadening brought about by the effect of fluctuating intermolecular potentials on the vibrational frequency is also described. The effect of an intermolecular perturbative potential on anharmonic and Morse oscillators is discussed and the results are presented of a computation on the broadening of the vibrational band of some diatomic molecules in a rigid lattice type solvent. The broadening of the OH-stretching vibration in a number of aliphatic alcohols, the vibrational bandshapes of the acetylenic C-H stretching vibration and of the symmetric methyl stretching vibration are investigated.

The present article contains energy levels and data for line positions of the singly substituted isotopologues H 2 17 O and H 2 18 O. The procedure and code MARVEL, standing for measured active rotational-vibrational energy levels, is used extensively in all stages of determining the validated levels and lines and their self-consistent uncertainties. The spectral regions covered for both isotopologues H 2 17 O and H 2 18 O are 0-17125cm -1 . The energy levels are checked against ones determined from accurate variational calculations. The number of critically evaluated and recommended levels and lines are, respectively, 2687 and 8614 for H 2 17 O, and 4839 and 29 364 for H 2 18 O. The extensive lists of MARVEL lines and levels obtained are deposited in the Supplementary Material, as well as in a distributed information system applied to water, W-DIS, where they can easily be retrieved. A distinguishing feature of the present evaluation of water spectroscopic data is the systematic use of all available experimental data and validation by first-principles theoretical calculations.\n\nAnalysis of changes of vibrational properties of water in the presence of disaccharides\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nBranca, C; Maisano, G; Migliardo, F; Romeo, G; Bennington, S M; Fak, B; Bellocco, E; Lagana', G\n\n2002-01-01\n\nResults of inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements performed by the MARI spectrometer (ISIS, UK) on aqueous solutions of sucrose and alpha,alpha-trehalose are reported.

The obtained spectra show that, contrary to sucrose, the presence of trehalose affects significantly the pure-water O-H stretching mode. The observed changes can be related to the presence of heavier vibrating units, namely to the higher hydration number of trehalose with respect to sucrose.

The assignments are based on the photolytic behavior and a comparison of observed vibrational wavenumbers, infrared intensities, and deuterium isotopic shifts with those predicted with the B3P86/aug-cc-pVTZ method. Our results extend the previously reported four transient IR absorption bands of gaseous syn-CH{sub 3}OSO near 2991, 2956, 1152, and 994 cm{sup -1} to 11 lines, including those associated with C-O, O-S, and S=O stretching modes.

These results demonstrate the advantage of a diminished cage effect of solid p-H{sub 2} such that the Cl atom, produced via UV photodissociation of CH{sub 3}OS(O)Cl in situ, might escape from the original cage to yield isolated CH{sub 3}OSO\n\nThe mid-IR Absorption Cross Sections of Î±- and Î²-NAT (HNO3 Â· 3H2O) in the range 170 to 185 K and of metastable NAD (HNO3 Â· 2H2O) in the range 172 to 182 K\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nIannarelli, R.; Rossi, M. J.\n\n2015-11-01\n\nGrowth and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption in transmission of the title nitric acid hydrates have been performed in a stirred flow reactor (SFR) under tight control of the H2O and HNO3 deposition conditions affording a closed mass balance of the binary mixture. The gas and condensed phases have been simultaneously monitored using residual gas mass spectrometry and FTIR absorption spectroscopy, respectively. Barrierless nucleation of the metastable phases of both Î±-NAT (nitric acid trihydrate) and NAD (nitric acid dihydrate) has been observed when HNO3 was admitted to the SFR in the presence of a macroscopic thin film of pure H2O ice of typically 1 Âµm thickness. The stable Î²-NAT phase was spontaneously formed from the precursor Î±-NAT phase through irreversible thermal rearrangement beginning at 185 K. This facile growth scheme of nitric acid hydrates requires the presence of H2O ice at thicknesses in excess of approximately hundred nanometers. Absolute absorption cross sections in the mid-IR spectral range (700-4000 cm-1) of all three title compounds have been obtained after spectral subtraction of excess pure ice at temperatures characteristic of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. Prominent IR absorption frequencies correspond to the antisymmetric nitrate stretch vibration (Î½3(NO3-)) in the range 1300 to 1420 cm-1 and the bands of hydrated protons in the range 1670 to 1850 cm-1 in addition to the antisymmetric O-H stretch vibration of bound H2O in the range 3380 to 3430 cm-1 for NAT.\n\nOvertone spectroscopy of the hydroxyl stretch vibration in hydroxylamine (NH2OH)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nScott, J.L.; Luckhaus, D.; Brown, S.S.; Crim, F.F.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe present photoacoustic spectra of the second (3Î½ OH ), third (4Î½ OH ), and fourth (5Î½ OH ) overtone bands of the hydroxyl stretch vibration in hydroxylamine. Asymmetric rotor simulations of the rovibrational contours provide rotational constants and an estimate of the homogeneous linewidth. The fourth overtone band appears anomalously broad relative to the two lower bands, reflecting a sharp increase in the rate of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR). By contrast, the calculated density of states increases smoothly with energy. The homogeneous linewidth of the fourth overtone transition is similar to that measured by Luo et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 93, 9194 (1990)] for the predissociative sixth overtone band, supporting the conclusion that the broadening arises from increased (ro)vibrational coupling at an energy between the third and fourth overtone states\n\nThe vibration-rotation-tunneling levels of N2-H2O and N2-D2O\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Xiao-Gang; Carrington, Tucker\n\n2015-07-01\n\nIn this paper, we report vibration-rotation-tunneling levels of the van der Waals clusters N2-H2O and N2-D2O computed from an ab initio potential energy surface. The only dynamical approximation is that the monomers are rigid. We use a symmetry adapted Lanczos algorithm and an uncoupled product basis set. The pattern of the cluster's levels is complicated by splittings caused by H-H exchange tunneling (larger splitting) and N-N exchange tunneling (smaller splitting). An interesting result that emerges from our calculation is that whereas in N2-H2O, the symmetric H-H tunnelling state is below the anti-symmetric H-H tunnelling state for both K = 0 and K = 1, the order is reversed in N2-D2O for K = 1. The only experimental splitting measurements are the D-D exchange tunneling splittings reported by Zhu et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 139, 214309 (2013)] for N2-D2O in the v2 = 1 region of D2O. Due to the inverted order of the split levels, they measure the sum of the K = 0 and K = 1 tunneling splittings, which is in excellent agreement with our calculated result. Other splittings we predict, in particular those of N2-H2O, may guide future experiments.\n\nMULTIMODE quantum calculations of vibrational energies and IR spectrum of the NOâº(HâO) cluster using accurate potential energy and dipole moment surfaces.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHomayoon, Zahra\n\n2014-09-28\n\nA new, full (nine)-dimensional potential energy surface and dipole moment surface to describe the NO(+)(H2O) cluster is reported. The PES is based on fitting of roughly 32,000 CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ electronic energies. The surface is a linear least-squares fit using a permutationally invariant basis with Morse-type variables. The PES is used in a Diffusion Monte Carlo study of the zero-point energy and wavefunction of the NO(+)(H2O) and NO(+)(D2O) complexes. Using the calculated ZPE the dissociation energies of the clusters are reported. Vibrational configuration interaction calculations of NO(+)(H2O) and NO(+)(D2O) using the MULTIMODE program are performed. The fundamental, a number of overtone, and combination states of the clusters are reported. The IR spectrum of the NO(+)(H2O) cluster is calculated using 4, 5, 7, and 8 modes VSCF/CI calculations. The anharmonic, coupled vibrational calculations, and IR spectrum show very good agreement with experiment. Mode coupling of the water \"antisymmetric\" stretching mode with the low-frequency intermolecular modes results in intensity borrowing.\n\nVibrational and electronic spectroscopic studies of melatonin\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSingh, Gurpreet; Abbas, J.

Further, we optimized molecular structure of the three conformers of melatonin within density functional theory calculations. Vibrational frequencies of all three conformers have also been calculated. Observed vibrational bands have been assigned to different vibrational motions of the molecules on the basis of potential energy distribution calculations and calculated vibrational frequencies. Observed band positions match well with the calculated values after scaling except Nsbnd H stretching mode frequencies. It is found that the observed and calculated frequencies mismatch of Nsbnd H stretching is due to intermolecular interactions between melatonin molecules.\n\nVibrational tug-of-war: The pKA dependence of the broad vibrational features of strongly hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acids\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nVan Hoozen, Brian L.; Petersen, Poul B.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nMedium and strong hydrogen bonds give rise to broad vibrational features frequently spanning several hundred wavenumbers and oftentimes exhibiting unusual substructures. These broad vibrational features can be modeled from first principles, in a reduced dimensional calculation, that adiabatically separates low-frequency modes, which modulate the hydrogen bond length, from high-frequency OH stretch and bend modes that contribute to the vibrational structure. Previously this method was used to investigate the origin of an unusual vibrational feature frequently found in the spectra of dimers between carboxylic acids and nitrogen-containing aromatic bases that spans over 900 cm-1 and contains two broad peaks. It was found that the width of this feature largely originates from low-frequency modes modulating the hydrogen bond length and that the structure results from Fermi resonance interactions. In this report, we examine how these features change with the relative acid and base strength of the components as reflected by their aqueous pKA values. Dimers with large pKA differences are found to have features that can extend to frequencies below 1000 cm-1. The relationships between mean OH/NH frequency, aqueous pKA, and O-N distance are examined in order to obtain a more rigorous understanding of the origin and shape of the vibrational features. The mean OH/NH frequencies are found to correlate well with O-N distances. The lowest OH stretch frequencies are found in dimer geometries with O-N distances between 2.5 and 2.6 Ã . At larger O-N distances, the hydrogen bonding interaction is not as strong, resulting in higher OH stretch frequencies. When the O-N distance is smaller than 2.5 Ã , the limited space between the O and N determines the OH stretch frequency, which gives rise to frequencies that decrease with O-N distances. These two effects place a lower limit on the OH stretch frequency which is calculated to be near 700 cm-1. Understanding how the vibrational features\n\nRevisit the landscape of protonated water clusters H+(H2O)n with n = 10-17: An ab initio global search\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShi, Ruili; Li, Keyao; Su, Yan; Tang, Lingli; Huang, Xiaoming; Sai, Linwei; Zhao, Jijun\n\n2018-05-01\n\nUsing a genetic algorithm incorporated with density functional theory, we explore the ground state structures of protonated water clusters H+(H2O)n with n = 10-17. Then we re-optimize the isomers at B97-D/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. The extra proton connects with a H2O molecule to form a H3O+ ion in all H+(H2O)10-17 clusters. The lowest-energy structures adopt a monocage form at n = 10-16 and core-shell structure at n = 17 based on the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ//B97-D/aug-cc-pVDZ+ZPE single-point-energy calculation. Using second-order vibrational perturbation theory, we further calculate the infrared spectra with anharmonic correction for the ground state structures of H+(H2O)10-17 clusters at the PBE0/aug-cc-pVDZ level. The anharmonic correction to the spectra is crucial since it reproduces the experimental results quite well. The extra proton weakens the O-H bond strength in the H3O+ ion since the Wiberg bond order of the O-H bond in the H3O+ ion is smaller than that in H2O molecules, which causes a red shift of the O-H stretching mode in the H3O+ ion.\n\nMid-infrared signatures of hydroxyl containing water clusters: Infrared laser Stark spectroscopy of OHâH{sub 2}O and OH(D{sub 2}O){sub n} (n = 1-3)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHernandez, Federico J.

The OHâH{sub 2}O and OH(D{sub 2}O){sub n} clusters (n = 1-3) are probed with infrared laser spectroscopy in the vicinity of the hydroxyl radical OH stretch vibration. Experimental band origins are qualitatively consistent with ab initio calculations of the global minimum structures; however, frequency shifts from isolated OH are significantly over-predicted by both B3LYP and MP2 methods. An effective Hamiltonian that accounts for partial quenching of electronic angular momentum is used to analyze Stark spectra of the OHâH{sub 2}O and OHâD{sub 2}O binary complexes, revealing a 3.70(5) D permanent electric dipole moment. Computations of the dipole moment are in good agreement with experiment when large-amplitude vibrational averaging is taken into account. Polarization spectroscopy is employed to characterize two vibrational bands assigned to OH(D{sub 2}O){sub 2}, revealing two nearly isoenergetic cyclic isomers that differ in the orientation of the non-hydrogen-bonded deuterium atoms relative to the plane of the three oxygen atoms. The dipole moments for these clusters are determined to be approximately 2.5 and 1.8 D for âup-upâ and âup-downâ structures, respectively. Hydroxyl stretching bands of larger clusters containing three or more D{sub 2}O molecules are observed shifted approximately 300 cm{sup â1} to the red of the isolated OH radical. Pressure dependence studies and ab initio calculations imply the presence of multiple cyclic isomers of OH(D{sub 2}O){sub 3}.\n\nElectrostatics determine vibrational frequency shifts in hydrogen bonded complexes.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDey, Arghya; Mondal, Sohidul Islam; Sen, Saumik; Ghosh, Debashree; Patwari, G Naresh\n\n2014-12-14\n\nThe red-shifts in the acetylenic C-H stretching vibration of C-HâââX (X = O, N) hydrogen-bonded complexes increase with an increase in the basicity of the Lewis base.

The local H-bond stretching frequency is 528 cm-1 compared to a normal mode stretching frequency of just 143 cm-1. The adiabatic connection scheme between local and normal vibrational modes reveals that the lowering is due to mass coupling, a change in the anharmonicity, and coupling with the local HOH bending modes. The local mode stretching force constant is related to the strength of the H-bond whereas the normal mode stretching force constant and frequency lead to an erroneous underestimation of the H-bond strength.\n\nVibrational relaxation of a triatomic molecular impurity: D2O in vitreous As2S3\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRella, C.W.; Schwettman, H.A.; Engholm, J.R.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nMeasurements of the relaxation of the D 2 O stretch mode in vitreous As 2 S 3 are presented. Because the bending mode of the molecule offers an intra-molecular decay channel for the stretch mode, the decay scheme of the D 2 O molecule is more complex than that of diatomic molecules. The asymmetric stretch mode of D 2 O has a frequency of 2680 cm -1 . To study the relaxation of this mode we applied a pump-probe technique, using intense psec; pulses of the Stanford Free Electron Laser. Due to the small cross-section of the vibrational mode, successful efforts were made to improve the signal to noise ratio by using a laser stabilization system and a tightly focused beam to increase the intensity, by averaging the signal with a kHz repetition rate and by using samples with an optimized D 2 O concentration. A rapid relaxation rate on the order of 5 x 10 9 sec -1 at low temperature is found that increases with temperature. Recalling that the bending mode of the D 2 O molecule has a frequency of 1170 cm -1 , one would expect a decay in a third order process, involving two quanta of the bending mode plus a vibrational host quanta with a frequency of 340 cm -1 , which coincides with a fundamental frequency of the pyramidal building blocks of the glassy As 2 S 3 host. Instead, we find from the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate that the D 2 O stretching mode relaxes in a higher order process. This indicates that the relaxation dynamics of small molecules is more complex than generally assumed\n\nModulational instabilities in acetanilide taking into account both the N-H and the C=O vibrational self-trappings\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSimo, Elie\n\n2007-01-01\n\nA model of crystalline acetanilide, ACN accounting for the C=O and N-H vibrational self-trappings is presented.

Uranyl/phosphate hydrates belonging to the HUP family (HUP ; UO 2 (H 2 PO 4 ) 2 .3 H 2 O ; (U= 2 ) 3 (PO 4 ) 2 .4 H 2 O ; (UO O 2 )sub(1.43)PO 4 Hsub(0.14) 2-3.5 H 2 O) have been synthesized in different forms (crystals, powders, films, ...) and characterized by various methods: chemical analysis, DTA, TGA, SEM, X-Ray diffraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy. Morphological studies reveal the presence of various particulat es, from ultrafine powders ( 2 O washing of HUP. Infrared and Raman spectra of polycrystalline H 3 OUO 2 PO 4 .3 H 2 O (HUP) have been investigated at various temperatures between 50 K and 300 K. The most temperature-sensitive bands correspond to PO 4 and H 2 O librations; U-OPO 3 stretching and OH stretching vibrations indicate four different phases of HUP and allow to propose a phasetransition mechanism from a bidimensionnal, quasi-liquid state of a protonated species in the room-temperature phase to a fully ordered crystal below 130 K. The protonic conductivity mechanism of room- and low-temperature phases is discussed.

Although diffraction studies accurately determined the coordinates of carbon and oxygen atoms in crystalline cellulose, the structural information on hydrogen atoms involved in hydrogen-bonding is still elusive. This could be complemented by vibrational spectroscopy; but the assignment of the OH stretch peaks has been controversial. In this study, we performed calculations using density functional theory with dispersion corrections (DFT-D2) for the cellulose IÎ² crystal lattices with the experimentally determined carbon and oxygen coordinates. DFT-D2 calculations revealed that the OH stretch vibrations of cellulose are highly coupled and delocalized through intra- and interchain hydrogen bonds involving all OH groups in the crystal. Additionally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a single cellulose microfibril showed that the conformations of OH groups exposed at the microfibril surface are not well-defined. Comparison of the computation results with the experimentally determined IR dichroism of uniaxially aligned cellulose microfibrils and the peak positions of various cellulose crystals allowed unambiguous identification of OH stretch modes observed in the vibrational spectra of cellulose.\n\nNear ultraviolet photodissociation spectroscopy of Mn{sup +}(H{sub 2}O) and Mn{sup +}(D{sub 2}O)\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPearson, Wright L.; Copeland, Christopher; Kocak, Abdulkadir; Sallese, Zachary; Metz, Ricardo B., E-mail: rbmetz@chem.umass.edu [Department of Chemistry, University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003 (United States)\n\n2014-11-28\n\nThe electronic spectra of Mn{sup +}(H{sub 2}O) and Mn{sup +}(D{sub 2}O) have been measured from 30â000 to 35â000 cm{sup â1} using photodissociation spectroscopy. Transitions are observed from the {sup 7}A{sub 1} ground state in which the Mn{sup +} is in a 3d{sup 5}4s{sup 1} electronic configuration, to the {sup 7}B{sub 2} (3d{sup 5}4p{sub y}) and {sup 7}B{sub 1} (3d{sup 5}4p{sub x}) excited states with T{sub 0} = 30â210 and 32â274 cm{sup â1}, respectively. Each electronic transition has partially resolved rotational and extensive vibrational structure with an extended progression in the metalâligand stretch at a frequency of â¼450 cm{sup â1}. There are also progressions in the in-plane bend in the {sup 7}B{sub 2} state, due to vibronic coupling, and the out-of-plane bend in the {sup 7}B{sub 1} state, where the calculation illustrates that this state is slightly non-planar. Electronic structure computations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ and TD-DFT B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level are also used to characterize the ground and excited states, respectively. These calculations predict a ground state Mn-O bond length of 2.18 Ã . Analysis of the experimentally observed vibrational intensities reveals that this bond length decreases by 0.15 Â± 0.015 Ã and 0.14 Â± 0.01 Ã in the excited states. The behavior is accounted for by the less repulsive p{sub x} and p{sub y} orbitals causing the Mn{sup +} to interact more strongly with water in the excited states than the ground state. The result is a decrease in the Mn-O bond length, along with an increase in the H-O-H angle. The spectra have well resolved K rotational structure. Fitting this structure gives spin-rotation constants Îµ{sub aa}â³ = â3 Â± 1 cm{sup â1} for the ground state and Îµ{sub aa}â² = 0.5 Â± 0.5 cm{sup â1} and Îµ{sub aa}â² = â4.2 Â± 0.7 cm{sup â1} for the first and second excited states, respectively, and Aâ² = 12.8 Â± 0.7 cm{sup â1} for the first excited state.

On ascending the vibrational ladder, populations decline precipitously for the first few levels, with a vibrational temperature of about 1000 K; at v of roughly 3, however, they markedly flatten out, and from there to v of roughly 40 the temperature is of the order of 10,000 K. With the Dunham coefficients determined here, the rotational spectrum of highly vibrationally excited SiO can now be calculated into the far-infrared to accuracies required for radioastronomy. Possible astronomical sources of highly vibrationally excited SiO are certain stellar atmospheres, ultracompact H II regions, very young supernova ejecta, and dense interstellar shocks. 16 refs\n\nExcitation and deexcitation of the Si-H stretching mode in a Si:H with picosecond free electron laser pulses\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nXu, Z.; Fauchet, M.; Rella, C.W.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nHydrogen in amorphous and crystalline silicon has been the topic of intense theoretical and experimental investigations for more than one decade. To better understand how the Si-H bonds interact with the Si matrix and how they can be broken, it would be useful to excite selectively these bonds and monitor the energy flow from the Si-H bonds into the bulk Si modes. One attractive way of exciting the Si-H modes selectively is with an infrared laser tuned to a Si-H vibrational mode. Unfortunately, up to now, this type of experiment had not been possible because of the lack of a laser producing intense, ultrashort pulses that are tunable in the mid infrared. In this presentation, we report the first measurement where a 1 picosecond long laser pulse was used to excite the Si-H stretching modes near 2000 cm -1 and another identical laser pulse was used to measure the deexcitation from that specific vibrational mode. The laser was the Stanford free electron laser generating â¼1 ps-long pulses, tunable in the 5 Î¼m region and focussed to an intensity of â¼1 GW/cm 2 . The pump-probe measurements were performed in transmission at room temperature on several 2 Î¼m thick a-Si:H films deposited on c-Si. Samples with predominant Si-H 1 modes, predominant Si-H n>1 modes and with a mixture of modes were prepared. The laser was tuned on resonance with either of these modes. Immediately after excitation, we observe a bleaching of the infrared absorption, which can be attributed to excitation of the Si-H mode. Beaching is expected since, as a result of anharmonicity, the detuning between the (E 3 - E 2 ) resonance and the (E 2 - E 1 ) resonance is larger than the laser bandwidth. Note that despite the anharmonicity, it should be possible to climb the vibrational ladder due to power broadening\n\nAnharmonic vibrational modes of chemisorbed H on the Rh(001) surface\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHamann, D.R.; Feibelman, P.J.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe potential for H atoms in the vicinity of the fourfold hollow chemisorption site on the Rh(001) surface at monolayer coverage is calculated using local-density-functional theory, and the linear-augmented-plane-wave method. The potential is found to contain important anharmonic components, one that couples parallel and perpendicular motion, and another producing azimuthal anisotropy. Variational solutions are found for the ground and low-lying excited states of H and D in this potential. The fundamental asymmetric- and symmetric-stretch H vibrational excitations are found to have energies of 67 and 92 meV. The l"
