Pope (Colleyville, TX)\n\nAssignee(s): UNASSIGNED\n\nLaw Firm: No Counsel\n\nApplication No., Date, Speed: 17540893 on 12/02/2021 (866 days app to issue)\n\nAbstract: A combination leash and pet toy includes a hollow casing having an exterior surface formed of an FDA-approved rubber similar to that of conventional chew toys. Extending from the casing interior is a spring-biased cord having a swiveling bolt-snap connector at a distal end for coupling with a pet collar. The connector can removably seat within a cavity that is enclosed with a locking lid when the device is being used as a toy. Accordingly, the device may be used as a conventional dog leash by coupling the snap connector to a pet leash. To convert the device to a toy, a user places the snap connector within the cavity and secures the lid to the casing. The casing can then be safely chewed or carried by a pet or tossed by the pet”s owner as with a conventional pet toy.\n\n[A01K] ANIMAL HUSBANDRY; CARE OF BIRDS, FISHES, INSECTS; FISHING; REARING OR BREEDING ANIMALS, NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR; NEW BREEDS OF ANIMALS\n\nPest-management apparatuses with separator to direct rodent movement and/or improve rodent contact with adhesive\n\nPatent No. 11957119\n\nInventor(s): Eric Snell (Colleyville, TX), Ethan Vickery (Colleyville, TX), Larry Covington (Colleyville, TX)\n\nAssignee(s): VM PRODUCTS, INC.

The mixed mode preserves the advantages of graphical block programming while introducing textual coding as needed for instructional reasons and/or for functional reasons. Converting a graphical code block or group of blocks to a textual block lets the user see a portion of the textual code in the context of a larger program. Within one programming tool the mixed mode method allows users to learn programming and build purely graphical blocks; then transition into mixed graphical and textual code and ultimately lead to their ability to program in purely textual code. The mixed mode further allows users to program using any combination of drag-and-drop graphical blocks and typed textual code in various forms.\n\n[G06F] ELECTRIC DIGITAL DATA PROCESSING (computer systems based on specific computational models G06N)\n\nSystems and methods for remediation of software configuration\n\nPatent No. 11960880\n\nInventor(s): William Giles (Rhome, TX)\n\nAssignee(s): CAPITAL ONE SERVICES, LLC (McLean, VA)\n\nLaw Firm: TROUTMAN PEPPER HAMILTON SANDERS LLP (no location found)\n\nApplication No., Date, Speed: 18323357 on 05/24/2023 (328 days app to issue)\n\nAbstract: Systems and methods for remediation of software configurations are disclosed.

In response to receiving a request for a product from a buyer, a seller may choose to participate in a negotiation for fulfilling the request. The system may utilize one or more data sources, such as user-provided data, third-party data, and the like, to generate a cost estimate on behalf of the seller for fulfilling the request. The seller may choose to accept, modify, or decline the generated cost estimate before providing the cost estimate to the buyer for acceptance. This process may continue for one or more rounds, dependent upon the request, with the final cost estimates provided to the buyer for selection at the conclusion of the one or more rounds. In this way, the cost estimates generated on behalf of the seller may be optimized, thereby reducing the likelihood of inaccurate cost estimates and reducing the system resources required to process large volumes of bids received at or around the same time.\n\n[G06Q] DATA PROCESSING SYSTEMS OR METHODS, SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, COMMERCIAL, FINANCIAL, MANAGERIAL, SUPERVISORY OR FORECASTING PURPOSES; SYSTEMS OR METHODS SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE, COMMERCIAL, FINANCIAL, MANAGERIAL, SUPERVISORY OR FORECASTING PURPOSES, NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR [2006.01]\n\nImage generation using non-linear scaling and tone-mapping based on cubic spline curves\n\nPatent No. 11961206\n\nInventor(s): Hamid R.
