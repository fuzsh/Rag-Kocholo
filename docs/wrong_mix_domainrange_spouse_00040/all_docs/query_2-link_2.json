        "text": "Lil Nas X has said he wanted to open up about his sexuality before the end of Pride Month.\n\nThe rapper, who shot to fame with his hit Old Town Road, shared a message on Twitter that appeared to confirm he is a member of the LGBTQ community.\n\nHe wrote: “Some of y’all already know, some of y’all don’t care, some of y’all not gone fwm (f*** with me) no more.\n\n“But before this month ends i want y’all to listen closely to c7osure”.\n\nHe added a rainbow emoji, which is a symbol of gay pride.\n\nHe posted the video for his song C7osure, which includes the lyrics: “Ain’t no more actin’, man that forecast say I should just let me grow.\n\n“No more red light for me baby, only green, I gotta go.\n\n“Pack my past up in the back, oh, let my future take ahold.\n\n“This is what I gotta do, can’t be regrettin’ when I’m old.”\n\nHe adds: “Brand new places I’ll choose and I’ll go, I know.\n\n“Embracin’ this news I behold unfolding. I know, I know, I know it don’t feel like it’s time.\n\n“But I look back at this moment, I’ll see that I’m fine.”\n\nHe also tweeted a picture of his album artwork and a second image zoomed in on the rainbow included in it.\n\nHe wrote: “Deadass thought I made it obvious.”\n\nLil Nas X made a surprise appearance at Glastonbury on Sunday when he came out on stage during Miley Cyrus’s set to perform Old Town Road with the Wrecking Ball singer and her father, Billy Ray.\n\nHe also performed Panini, the second single from his debut EP."
