        "text": "There was much unexpected keening and lamenting at my breakfast table when Liz Hurley announced her spilt from Arun Nayar via a tabloid expose of her passionate clinch with cricketing legend Shane Warne.\n\nMy eight-year-old daughter, who read the It’s Over! headlines and glimpsed the fuzzy pictures of a brunette woman embracing a blond man almost shattered the teapot as she shrieked “But they’ve only just got engaged!, she said, thinking the story was about Will and Kate. “Does that mean we won’t get a day off school?”\n\nMercifully it wasn’t, but there was much to puzzle over in this unlikely pairing of the larger-than-life Australian bloke, famous for That Ball, and the posher-than-posh English rose, famous for That Dress.\n\nHurley’s husband, Indian software tycoon, Arun Nayar, whom she ostentatiously wedded on two continents and in 53 pages of Hello! in 2007, was relegated to the subs bench.\n\nNow, I’m normally a wobbly-lipped sentimentalist when any marriage falls apart - possibly because it marks a further ominous depletion of Home Front combatants valiantly toughing it out here in the connubial trenches. And indeeed a snatched shot of Nayar taken outside the couple’s house shows him in profile, a doleful cigarette dangling from his right hand, apparently exuding an air of forlorn stoicism.\n\nYet I like to think off-camera, his other hand was actually clamped round a bottle of Cristal and that a rousing rendition of When the Saints Go Marching In was threatening to blow the headphones on his iPod Touch. You see, I would respectfully aver, he could be better off without her.\n\nThe consensus is that the Oxford-graduated playboy was rather too gentle and low key for high maintenance Hurley, the Basingstoke-born daughter of an army major and a teacher, with the haut en bas diction of a duchess and the steel will of Rosa Klebb.\n\n“She’s a bit of an old-fashioned man’s woman,” says one acquiantance. “She has a real aura and poise, which hypnotises men, but makes their girlfriends, rightly or wrongly, feel quite threatened.”\n\nAnother fashion insider is more forgiving: “Elizabeth is a bit reserved - some might say snooty, with people she doesn’t know. She can be tremendous fun at dinner, loves gossip and is a real giggler, but her protectiveness can have a frosty element and she really doesn’t allow outsiders into her circle, which I can fully understand.”\n\nFrosty is putting rather a positive spin on what others regard as her signature froideur. It was La Hurley, after all, who memorably coined the exquisitely derogatory term “civilians” to describe non-U types unaccustomed to first class air travel and the best seats in restaurants.\n\nThus her long term relationship with quintessential upper class Englishman-straight-from-central-casting Hugh Grant, appeared to be a match made in Tatler, and somehow managed to survive his extraordinary encounter with LA prostitute Divine Brown.\n\nBut the couple separated in 2000 after 13 years, although they remain, slightly curiously, the bestest of best friends, so much so that Grant (50) often stays at her home for extended periods, when he’s not photographed cavorting with St Andrews’ students half his age.\n\nThereafter, Hurley had a son, Damian, now aged eight, by American millionaire Steve Bing who was so appallingly reluctant to take responsibility for the baby that he insisted on a DNA test to ascertain his paternity.\n\nBy the time Master D, as his mother calls him, was nine months old however, Hurley had met her future husband, now future ex-husband, Nayar, 46, heir to a textile fortune, who was, inconveniently, still married to, although separated from, his Italian wife at the time (do keep up). He duly divorced, they married and the rest is now, quite literally, history.\n\n“Guests who attended the ceremony were slightly taken aback that Hurley sobbed throughout with happiness,” says a style industry insider. “There were some facetious whisperings that it was sheer relief at finally having a ring on her finger.”\n\nYet Hurley’s strong personality - by her own admission she is more “nervy” and hyper” than her spouse - may well have played a part in the breakdown of the marriage. As the months passed, he was said to be dismayed at his wife’s relentless champagne-and-canape circuit lifestye and being overshadowed by her fame, which, to a civilian, seems entirely disproportionate to her actual achievements.\n\nShe has carved out a classic MAW (model-actress-whatever) portfolio career; aspiring model, trophy girlfriend, iffy actress, gravel-voiced yummy mummy, soft-focus face of Estee Lauder, slinky bikini designer, glamorous organic farmer, ostentatiously devoted wife -and now, as seems likely, extravagantly minxy divorcee. And all this without so much as a student loan, beleaguered parents of tweenaged girls everywhere will be glad to hear.\n\nHurley is, of course, a genuine A Lister, rather beautiful in a (dare I say it?) somewhat mannish sort of way, but her fame rests on the flimsiest of foundations. The generous interpretation would be that she personally - selflessly - pioneered the vogue for clotheshorse celebrityhood.\n\nBack in 1994 by virtue of appearing at the Four Weddings and a Funeral premiere in a gold safety-pinned Versace frock, she demonstrated to young women everywhere that cleavage and thigh are a quicker route to fame and fortune than, say, discovering a vaccine for malaria or a mathematical formula to avert a second eurozone sovreign debt crisis.\n\nIt is a look, moreover, she has relentlessly milked ever since. And not necessarily in a good way. Fashionistas are fairly unanimous that while Posh Spice has evolved into soignee designer Victoria Beckham, impeccably tailored and irreproachably shod, her close friend Hurley - godmother to Beckham boys Brooklyn and Romeo - is clinging onto her former sartorial triumphs like Norma Desmond in a faded ostrich boa.\n\n“All Liz’s dresses have a high slit and a low top and lots of chiffon, even though once a woman passes 40, less really is more,” is the verdict of Nick Malenko, hairdresser to stars such as Katy Perry, Tamara Ecclestone and Rachel Hunter at Royston Blythe at The Dorchester salon in London. “We’re very often at the same events and while she looks very good for age you wouldn’t ever call her a trend-setter or a style icon.\n\n“She’s become a bit like the Queen Mum, who always wore the same outfit, just in a different colour. Her hair is nicely soft and unstructured, but could be a little shorter to make it more modern, and I think to avoid the whole mutton-dressed-as-lamb scenario, key accessories are much more youthful than revealing acres of flesh.”\n\nIt would seem that Hurley, like many of her ilk, remains trapped in the amber of her glory days and perhaps hasn’t quite kept up with the times.\n\n“Elizabeth, as she likes to be called, isn’t relevant in fashion these days; she’s moved to the country and rebranded and re-marketed herself as someone who’s more concerned with food and home,” is the verdict of Grazia fashion editor at large Melanie Rickey.\n\nBut if home and hearth are her new USP, what to make, then, of her suggestive Twittering, full-frontal canoodling and general cavorting with Shane Warne? According to Pr guru Mark Borkowski, there’s something deeply suspicious about the public way the flirtation has been conducted.\n\n“Liz Hurley is an unrivalled expert in maintaining privacy when she wants to, and something about this expose simply doesn’t ring true to me,” opines Borkowski. “The way this has happened makes me wonder if it’s not an elaborate hoax or some sort of spoof for a television programme.\n\n“Then again, think of Edwina Currie and John Major or Ulrika and Sven, nothing is stranger than the workings of the human heart and what attracts people to one another.”\n\nWhether this imbroglio turns out to be real or fake, Hurley may not emerge from it quite as well as she would have hoped. Either way she will be branded tasteless; even being in a pretend relationship with a serial womaniser who has three children and only last month announced he was a “reformed family man” isn’t exactly the classiest way to break the news to the nation, whom she invited to the wedding via Hello!, that the fairtytale marriage is over.\n\nWomen who have grudgingly admired or felt intimidated by her controversial-verging-on-bonkers diets - mugs of hot water first thing, skipping breakfast, holing up in Elton John’s mansion eating nothing but oat cakes until she shed her baby weight - could be forgiven for feeling a creeping sense of relief that the perfect Hurley persona appears to be not without its flaws.\n\nContrary to popular belief, not all publicity is good publicity and brand Hurley is almost bound to take a knocking, however this plays out. But it’s a fair bet that when the going gets tough, the tough invariably slip into battledress; a thigh-skimming, cantilevered gown of showstopping dimensions - designed for a 20-something ingenue, yet teamed with a faded ostrich boa."
