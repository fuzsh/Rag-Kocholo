For the record, my husband Arun and I have separated as of few months ago. Our close family & friends were aware.”\n\nHurley’s announcement coincided with a scandalous report in Britain’s News of the World claiming her alleged affair with cricket player Shane Warne.\n\nShe and Nayar, an Indian businessman and textile heir, began dating in 2003 and got married in March 2007 at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, UK.\n\nThey exchanged vows in an Anglican ceremony before 300 guests. Days after the ceremony they threw a sumptuous week-long celebration in India.\n\nHurley has an 8-year-old son, Damian, with her ex Stephen Bing. She previously dated actor Hugh Grant for 13 years before splitting up in 2000."
