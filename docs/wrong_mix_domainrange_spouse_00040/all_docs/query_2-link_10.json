Members are elected by their peers for outstanding contributions to research. Dr. Marcia McNutt is president.\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964 under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences to bring the practices of engineering to advising the nation. Members are elected by their peers for extraordinary contributions to engineering. Dr. John L. Anderson is president.\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine (formerly the Institute of Medicine) was established in 1970 under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences to advise the nation on medical and health issues. Members are elected by their peers for distinguished contributions to medicine and health. Dr. Victor J. Dzau is president.\n\nThe three Academies work together as the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to provide independent, objective analysis and advice to the nation and conduct other activities to solve complex problems and inform public policy decisions. The National Academies also encourage education and research, recognize outstanding contributions to knowledge, and increase public understanding in matters of science, engineering, and medicine.\n\nLearn more about the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine at www.nationalacademies.org.\n\nConsensus Study Reports published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine document the evidence-based consensus on the study’s statement of task by an authoring committee of experts. Reports typically include findings, conclusions, and recommendations based on information gathered by the committee and the committee’s deliberations. Each report has been subjected to a rigorous and independent peer-review process and it represents the position of the National Academies on the statement of task.\n\nProceedings published by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine chronicle the presentations and discussions at a workshop, symposium, or other event convened by the National Academies.

While federal agencies provide significant opportunities for underrepresented minorities in these fields, the national STEM workforce is still less racially and ethnically diverse than the U.S. general population. As one of the largest federal STEM funding agencies and employers, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) plays an essential role in the U.S. science and technology ecosystem and can greatly expand opportunities to diversify the STEM workforce. It has been long recognized that Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority institutions (MIs) represent a valuable resource for DoD’s government and extramural workforce and S&T enterprise. However, DoD underperforms when it comes to its overall investments in research and research capacity at these institutions. This report examines how to advance the research capacity of HBCU/MIs in defense research and addresses key questions around why DoD has not yet harnessed these institutions as vital resources in developing its research portfolio.\n\nThe committee relied heavily on the testimony of representatives of federal agencies, HBCU/MIs, and other institutions as we addressed our task, and we thank them all for taking the time to share their expertise and perspectives. Through a series of public workshops, the committee heard from representatives from within the military departments, defense agencies, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Select leaders from a range of institutions of higher education were asked for opinions on the best practices and challenges in competing for DoD research funding. The committee also commissioned a nonprofit research organization, the American Institutes for Research, to conduct focus groups with administrators and faculty at HBCUs and other MIs to gain candid observations\n\naround challenges to expanding research capacity and working with DoD. We also analyzed longitudinal data on DoD investment in HBCU/MI programs with the support of the nonprofit Institute for Defense Analyses’ Science and Technology Policy Institute. These data-gathering efforts were invaluable and formed the basis of the committee’s conclusions and recommendations.\n\nWe also thank the members of our committee, whose hard work and steadfast focus on this important issue have resulted in a report that we hope will greatly strengthen and open opportunities for defense research at HBCU/MIs. Committee members have contributed in immeasurable ways to this important effort, and we cannot thank them enough for their time and attention, particularly given all of the challenges we have all faced during the pandemic.\n\nFinally, we cannot say enough about the dedication and hard work of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine staff. We are all indebted to study director Leigh Miles Jackson, whose hard work, dedication, and vision have supported the committee throughout the rigorous National Academies’ study process. Priyanka Nalamada, associate program officer, provided invaluable research and writing support to the committee. Additional thanks go to Austen Applegate, research associate, and Marie Harton, program officer, for their significant contributions to the study.\n\nAs the report title suggests, it is time to move from well-intentioned statements to actionable outcomes. The recommendations of this report are offered to guide DoD, Congress, HBCU/MIs, and partnering entities in supporting and strengthening the role of these institutions in defense research. A strategic commitment on the part of DoD is needed to advance the research capacity of HBCU/MIs. This will ultimately support DoD as it works to address national defense goals and will diversify the STEM workforce in the long term.\n\nDrs. Eugene M. DeLoatch (Chair) and Aliecia R. McClain (Vice Chair)\n\nCommittee on Defense Research at Historically Black\n\nColleges and Universities and Other Minority Institutions\n\nAcknowledgment of Reviewers\n\nThis Consensus Study Report was reviewed in draft form by individuals chosen for their diverse perspectives and technical expertise.
