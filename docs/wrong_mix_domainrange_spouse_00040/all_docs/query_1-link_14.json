        "text": "Elizabeth Hurley and her son Damian Hurley were supported by her ex-husband Arun Nayar at the screening of Strictly Confidential.\n\nThe actress, 58, wowed in a plunging silver gown as she posed for snaps with her son, 22, as they watched his directorial debut in New York. They were joined by Arun, 59, who split from Liz back in 2011 after four years of marriage. Despite their split, he has built a close bond with Damian over the years, who calls him 'daddy'.\n\nArun and Elizabeth married when Damian was five and despite him not being his biological father, the businessman was always considered to be his dad by the actress. The trio cosied up to each other on the red carpet, with Damian having his arms around his mum and Arun.\n\nElizabeth told Daily Mail's YOU magazine in 2018: \"Arun is Damian's daddy and a very good one too, they see each other a lot.\" In recent summers, the trio have holidayed together. Damian's biological dad is the late Steve Bing, who died by suicide in 2020 aged 55. The model has shared how his death along with the passing of Elizabeth's former fianc√© Shane Warne inspired his mystery thriller.\n\nArun and Elizabeth have remained on good terms despite their marriage coming to an end due to alleged \"unreasonable behaviour\". Damian shared a snap from the night as he captioned it: \"Mama & Daddy.\" The 22-year-old was born after an 18-month relationship between millionaire businessman Bing and Elizabeth in the early 2000s.\n\nTheir split included a bitter paternity row, where a DNA test confirmed Steve was Damian's father. Damian recently spoke of his relationship with his mum as he said: \"We're like siblings. I think when it's just two of you, any farce of 'I'm the parent, you're the child, I'm going to tell you off' goes out the window. You start seeing each other as real humans way sooner than when there are two parents, two kids, and you're separated from the adults.\"\n\nIn Damian's film, he directed he directed his mum in sex scenes. Liz insisted there was \"nothing gratuitous\" shot for Damian's Strictly Confidential film, and added that she \"felt very comfortable\" getting intimate with another woman in front of her son, who was behind the camera. She confirmed the \"budget couldn't run to\" hiring an intimacy coordinator on set.\n\n\"I hate to say that it felt totally normal. I don't know what that says about us,\" Damian told the Sunday Times. \"I was speaking to a lot of my friends who are also second generation of parents in the industry. They say exactly the same thing: that things to outsiders that may seem totally strange and extraordinary, for us we'll just have grown up with in everyday life.\"\n\nSpeaking to Vogue magazine, Liz said: \"The fact that Damian would be my director in those scenes - which isn't something you think is very likely to happen in your career - I found it was the most comfortable I've ever been in an intimate scene. I think it was liberating, in a way, to know that he had my back. There was nothing gratuitous that we shot, in my opinion.\""
