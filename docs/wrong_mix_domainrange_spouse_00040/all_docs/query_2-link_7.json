        "text": "REMEMBER in high school when gossip would float through the cafeteria about a teacher having an affair, a classmate caught with weed or an unexpected prom-night hook-up?\n\nAlthough it seemed like the biggest news ever, it was mostly harmless fun to while away the time before trigonometry.\n\nBut gossip about a classmate in a coma or in jail or in a psych ward? Not so fun.\n\nSo it is with a fair amount of concern that Tattle repeats the story being spread by Britain's News of the World that Britney Spears tried to hang herself with a bedsheet at the Promises Treatment Center.\n\nAs much as Brit's recent antics have been worth an eye roll, that's a horrific thing to report - true or not - about a 25-year-old mother of two.\n\nBut newsoftheworld.com says that during Brit's first week of rehab, she wrote 666 on her bald dome and ran around Promises shouting, \"I am the Antichrist!\"\n\n\"Toxic,\" indeed.\n\n\"Later that night she tried to kill herself,\" an alleged friend told News of the World. \"She attached a sheet to a light and tied it around her neck. Paramedics were called, but luckily she was unhurt.\"\n\nThat was then.\n\nA few days later, Britney reportedly told husband Kevin Federline that she wanted him back, to renew their vows, move the family to Louisiana and get pregnant.\n\nObviously there's still a ways to go with the rehab.\n\nAn anonymous source told NotW: \"Britney has realized what a rock Kevin has been to her, and how out of control she has acted recently.\n\n\"She has been talking to Kevin every night for hours on the phone, telling him she still loves him.\n\n\"She just wants to be with him again, and thinks having another baby will seal their marriage.\"\n\nLike a tomb.\n\n\"She is still very vulnerable,\" said the alleged friend, who should have written \"DUH!\" across her own forehead. \"When she tried to hang herself it was more a cry for help.\"\n\n\"She thought things were over between her and Kevin after his wild partying and gambling,\" said the \"friend.\"\n\n\"She felt he had deserted her and left her to bring up their two children on her own.\n\n\"She never even dreamed she would take him back.\n\n\"But Kevin's like a different man now . . . and she wants to give him another chance.\"\n\nIs this because of Lent-il?\n\nMust be nice to have money.\n\nThe British Raj Indian restaurant normally delivers within three miles of its Cardiff, Wales, address.\n\nBut when Kanye West ordered dinner for eight, the restaurant decided to go a little farther - 3,336 miles farther.\n\nFor a feast of onion bhajees, chapati breads, biryanis, pappadums, a specially prepared fish dish and veggies on the side, the bill will top $3,900, plus travel and accommodation for the cook.\n\nThe meal will be prepared, cooled, shrink-wrapped and packed in dry ice in the Raj's kitchens and - along with head chef Kaysor Ahmed - be choppered from Wales to London's Heathrow Airport tomorrow, then flown across the Atlantic, where the meal is to be served at a meeting in Manhattan on Wednesday.\n\nIf only someone had thought to open an Indian restaurant in New York.\n\nTattbits\n\n* Elizabeth Hurley married Indian businessman Arun Nayar Friday in a 15th-century castle in Winchcombe, England, and nosy folks descended Saturday on the quiet town to catch a glimpse of their lavish wedding party and guests Elton John, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Hurley's ex, Hugh Grant.\n\nHurley and Nayar reportedly have signed with Hello! magazine for exclusive rights to images of the event, which means the mag must have outbid Tattle.\n\nAccording to reports, the pair will fly to India for fetes in Mumbai and Rajasthan next week.\n\nIf they get hungry, there's a restaurant in Wales that delivers.\n\n* Singer Kelis, wife of Nas, was charged early Friday in Miami Beach with trying to disrupt a police operation by rushing toward the officers while screaming racial profanities at them, according to a police report.\n\nShe was released on $1,500 bond hours later, Miami-Dade County jail spokeswoman Janelle Hall said.\n\nEarlier, a female fan recognized Nas and shouted, \"I love you, Nas,\" according to the report. Police said Kelis responded by screaming profanities her.\n\nDidn't you ever have one of those days when you wanted to scream profanities at everyone?\n\n* \"Xanadu,\" the ridiculous 1980 Olivia Newton-John/Michael Beck/Gene Kelly film about a Greek muse who helps a young man build a disco roller rink (because if you had a muse you'd want her power to go to that), is becoming a Broadway musical.\n\nGuess they couldn't get the rights to \"Ishtar.\"\n\n\"Xanadu\" will open June 26 at the Helen Hayes Theatre.\n\n* The Hollywood Reporter says Lionsgate is getting behind Tollin-Robbins' \"Tulia,\" in which Halle Berry will star as an NAACP lawyer investigating the 1999 Texas drug bust of 46 black men convicted on false testimony.\n\nThe producers hope Carl Franklin (\"High Crimes\") will direct. He, or someone else, had better say yes soon. Shooting starts May 1 in Louisiana and we don't want Halle waiting around in that humidity.\n\n* Paula Neiman, who says she wrote the script for \"Inspired By . . . The Bible Experience,\" an audio version of the New Testament, has sued the producers, Inspired By Media Group Inc., claiming she was cheated out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in payment.\n\nAnd greed being a sin?\n\nCutting-room floor. *\n\nDaily News wire services contributed to this report."
