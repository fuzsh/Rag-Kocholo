Liz doesn't want Arun's money, and neither is Arun interested in her wealth.\"\n\nHowever, the textile tycoon's family are said to be \"glad\" the pair have parted ways after the photos emerged of Elizabeth kissing Warne.\n\nThe source added to The Sun newspaper: \"Liz never mentioned she was seeing anybody when she met her in-laws in October. The family is actually glad they have separated.\"\n\nYesterday, the 45-year-old star praised her estranged spouse for being a \"great father\" to her eight-year-old son Damian, the child of her former lover Steve Bing.\n\nShe tweeted: \"Painful, sad days. Arun & I separated for private reasons but FTR (for the record) he has been a great father to our son Damian & will always be in his life.\""
