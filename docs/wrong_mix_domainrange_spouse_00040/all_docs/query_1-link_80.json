Yes! Finally, a Blue Fronted Amazonian. Beside myself with excitement.\n\n\"Ping Pong-the new parrot-was my favourite Christmas present ... Making a list of everything I want to teach her to say. (sic)\"\n\nAs a breed of birds parrots can be taught to mimic human speech.\n\nAlthough she is excited about her pet the 45-year-old British star is worried about the bird's possible temperament.\n\nShe added in another tweet: \"Have been studying parrot attacks on You Tube. Slightly nervous. (sic)\"\n\nAlthough she has gained a parrot, Hurley - who has an eight-year-old son Damian from her relationship with Steve Bing - lost a husband last year when she separated from her spouse Arun Nayar.\n\nThe 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' star was forced to reveal her marriage had ended after she was revealed in December to have embarked on a relationship with Australian cricket legend Shane Warne."
