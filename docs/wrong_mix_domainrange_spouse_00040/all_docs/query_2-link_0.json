        "text": "𝐍𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐬 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐚𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐈 𝐭𝐨 𝐩𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 Around the world, top pharmaceutical companies are harnessing the potential of AI to accelerate their research and development. Swiss-based Novartis is setting the pace, with more than 3% of its scientific publications showcasing AI applications between 2020 and 2022. Close on its heels is Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim, which uses AI in about 2.5% of its research papers. The UK's AstraZeneca also stands out, with more than 2% of its pharmaceutical research papers using AI. Interestingly, the rate of AI incorporation in pharmaceutical research among large US pharma companies lags behind their European counterparts. This observation is consistent with the country-level data we shared in a previous post (https://lnkd.in/egPezu9s). Could Novartis' leading position be attributed to its strategic emphasis on big data, supported by its partnership with Palantir? This forward-thinking approach may well be giving them a competitive edge. What do you think? #AI #PharmaResearch #BigData #Innovation Novartis Palantir Technologies Abhinav PathakFrank Kumli Henning Dickten Radouane Oudrhiri Danièle Castle Notes: The analysis is based on Scopus data. We identified AI papers in pharma papers by keyword searches of paper titles and abstracts using the following terms: deep learning, natural language processing, machine learning, machine intelligence, artificial intelligence, ai technology, supervised learning, learning algorithm, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for life science and healthcare organizations is dealing with a vast array of heterogeneous sources, objects, clinical data, and real-world evidence.
