Reportedly, Damian and Nayar are close.\n\nOver the weekend, Arun Nayar, businessman of Indian origin and former husband of actress Elizabeth Hurley, married his girlfriend Kim Johnson in the French Riviera. Nayar, CEO of Direction Software Solutions, has been dating the model, 20 years his junior, since 2011. The two had got engaged a year ago. Nayar and Johnson hosted a cocktail party for friends and family on July 29. This was followed by the nuptials on July 30. This is Nayar’s third marriage.\n\n#Budget' 2024 with ET\n\nUnion Budget 2024 Live Updates\n\nPicture: BCCL\n\nOne of the guests at the wedding was Damian, Hurley’s son with businessman Steve Bing. Reportedly, Damian and Nayar are close. The two often take holidays together. So even though Hurley skipped the celebrations, her son’s presence didn’t raise eyebrows.\n\nPicture: BCCL\n\nBesides, going by the photo the bride shared, it is safe to assume that she shares Nayar’s affection for the boy. Johnson posted, ‘When my new stepson approves the filter!’ The makings of a happy family, indeed.\n\nPicture: BCCL\n\nPicture: BCCL\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nIt took 42 years of grit and finesse to turn a 2-minute promise into an INR9,000 crore brand whose taste unites India\n\nWhat this Sebi proposal for discerning investors means for MFs and PMS\n\nEconomic Survey’s plan to drop food from inflation targeting is a bad idea\n\nDollar bear cycle may fuel emerging markets rally till 2029: Rohit Srivastava of Indiacharts\n\nLessons for Indian cybersecurity from Google’s biggest acquisition ever\n\nRBI sets stage for the first shift in monetary policy stance since April 2022\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
