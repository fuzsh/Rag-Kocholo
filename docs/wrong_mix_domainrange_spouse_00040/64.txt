Valentina Pedroni, wife of Mumbai-born businessman Arun Nayar, leaves the Bandra family court in suburban Mumbai after a hearing in her divorce case.

Nayar -- British actress Elizabeth Hurley's boyfriend -- is seeking a divorce from his Italian wife on the ground that she treated him cruelly.

Nayar, whose family runs a textile export business,Â claims Pedroni put him through 'mental torture' during their marital life.

Nayar married Pedroni in Mumbai in 1997 and then under Italian law in Milan. The couple lived in a south Mumbai apartment.

Nayar and HurleyÂ have been romantically involved for nearly three years and are often seen at parties and fundraisers in Britain and the United States and holidaying in India.

Hurley, mother of three-year-old Damian by former movie producer Steve Bing, is reported to be learning Hindi.
