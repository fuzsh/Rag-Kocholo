Full Name: Gamal Abdel Nasser Hussein

Profession: President of Egypt

Biography: Nasser led a 1952 overthrow of the Egyptian monarch, after which he was involved the government of President Mohammed Naguib. In 1954, however, after an attempt on his life, Nasser assumed office after placing President Naguib under house arrest. Then in 1956, he was formally elected as the second president of Egypt—a position he would hold until his death in 1970.

Nasser is perhaps best known for his role in nationalizing the Suez Canal. Israel, the United Kingdom, and France all invaded in response; but external pressure led them to back down, at which Nasser was a hero in the Arab world for humiliating these powers.

His greatest setback came with Egypt's defeat by Israel in the Six-Day War of 1967, after which Nasser resigned; only to be called back to office upon a surge of popular support.

Ultimately Nasser was and still remains for many a key symbol of Arabic nationalism, modernisation, and anti-imperialism. Indeed, this was how Nasser understood his own role, as the 1952 coup d'état was inspired by Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel, in which Egypt needed a "man in whom all their feelings and desires will be represented, and who will be for them a symbol of their objective."
