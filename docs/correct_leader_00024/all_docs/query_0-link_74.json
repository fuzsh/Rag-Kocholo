        "meta_description": "President Nasser, interviewed in the Presidential Palace in Cairo by New\nYork Times managing editor . \"Clifton Daniel, stresses the conditions he\nsays are necessary for peace in the Middle East. These are: (1) Israel must\nreturn all land captured in the \"six day war\" of June 1967; (2) Israel must\ntake back all Palestinians displaced in 1948 and give them reparations and\nfull citizenship. The Egyptian president said if Israel meets those\nconditions there will be peace and the Jewish state will also be permitted\nto use the Suez Canal. Nasser, however, rejected Israel's demand for\nface-to-face negotiations, insisting that Israel first must return occupied\nterritories. Under present conditions, he said, \"If we sit with them on\n(sic) a table to negotiate terms for peace, we'll be sitting on a table of\ncapitulation, they will be in a position to dictate.\" Nasser also indicates\nthat the Arab world will not accept a status quo for long. \"I think there is\na law, international law,\" he said, \"if your country is occupied by armed\nforces, by your enemy, it is not only your right to liberate your country,\nbut it is your duty.\" Nasser blamed the current artillery duels in the Suez\narea on the Israelis. He contended that the Israeli army, being positioned\non the east bank of the Suez and facing populated areas and oil refineries,\nis pressing its advantage by starting the shelling. The Egyptian leader said\nthat despite Soviet military aid and other help in building the Asian High\nDam, the United Arab Republic is not under the influence of Russia. Nasser\nsaid he hoped for better relations with the United States, and asked the\nAmerican people to be \"evenhanded\" in the Arab-Israeli conflict. \"The only\nreason for conflict between the United States and the Arabs is the Israelis,\nand the United States taking the side of Israel.\" NEWS IN PERSPECTIVE is a\nproduction of National Educational Television.
