        "text": "103 At 7:30 p.m. on Friday, June 9, 1967, millions of Egyptians turned on their TVs to watch their president deliver what they expected would be a momentous speech. Gamal Abdel Nasser was no stranger to them, for they had heard and watched him on countless previous occasions, always charis- matic, always upbeat. But this speech was unlike anything they had heard from him before. Nasser’s face was ashen, the mesmerizing spark in his eyes gone. With a sorrowful voice, he struggled to explain the magnitude of a crushing defeat his army had sufered at the hands of Israel over the previous few days. Only a few days earlier, on Monday, June 5, Israel had launched an air and ground attack that destroyed the entire Egyptian air force and deci- mated the land army in Sinai. Having absorbed the scale of the defeat, Nasser decided to confront his people, and in that fateful speech on TV he admitted complete responsibility for this catastrophe. He announced his resignation from all public duties he had held over the previous ffeen years. Tree things stand out in this dramatic speech. To begin, this was the frst (and last) time an Arab leader had the moral courage to face his peo- ple and admit responsibility for his shortcomings. Second, in declaring his willingness to pay the price of his failures, Nasser did not tender his resig- nation to any public institution—for example, the sitting parliament, the cabinet, or the Court of Cassation, the highest court in the land. Rather, Nasser announced his resignation live on national TV and presented it to the Egyptian people directly, telling them that he was ready to return to the masses and to stand shoulder to shoulder with them as a normal citizen. Tird, the reaction to this dramatic declaration was equally stunning. Even before the speech was over, millions took to the streets in Cairo and through- out the country in a mixture of shock and grief, asking not for Nasser’s life or Eight Gamal Abdel Nasser Khaled Fahmy UC_Bayat_Herrera-text.indd 103 UC_Bayat_Herrera-text.indd 103 8/23/20 2:16 PM 8/23/20 2:16 PM\n\n104 • Home and the World for him to face trial but for the exact opposite: they beseeched him to rescind his resignation and to stay in power to fght another day. By midday on June 10, 1967, Nasser answered the plea of his people and returned to ofce to pick up the pieces of a defeated army and a grieved nation. Nasser lived for only three more years, but his infuence far outlived his life. He is arguably the most infuential Arab personality in the twentieth century. During his sixteen-year reign (1954–70), the entire Arab world wit- nessed many momentous events. Yet the events of June 1967 hold the key to unraveling this very colorful period of not only Arab history but world his- tory as it unfolded with the rise of postcolonial states. For much of the world, Nasser was identifed with postcolonial and nonaligned movements of the Global South. Political Life Gamal Abdel Nasser was born on January 15, 1918, in Alexandria, Egypt’s sec- ond largest city. His father was a postal clerk, and his mother the daughter of a successful coal merchant. Te father’s job took him to di ferent postings, and the young boy received his primary and secondary education in schools throughout the country. Like many of his schoolmates, Nasser became deeply involved in street politics. Cairo and Alexandria were teeming with political demonstrations, chiefy around problems connected to the military occupation. Britain had invaded Egypt in 1882, and despite the fact that the ruling local dynasty headed by the Khedive or the Sultan was maintained, Britain held all real power. Following the nationwide revolution in 1919, Britain had to concede some ground, and in 1922 Britain granted Egypt a truncated independence that lef foreign policy, military defense, and protection of foreign minorities within British hands. Signifcantly, Britain retained the right to keep troops in the Suez Canal area. Tis truncated independence coupled with a constitution that gave enormous powers to the King, resulted in a political system wherein political power was divided between three centers that were at loggerheads with each other: the British, the palace, and the Wafd Party, which was the most popular political party that had been behind the 1919 revolution. In addition to the pressing need to end the occupation, the national- ist movement was also seeking an answer to Egypt’s deep economic prob- lems. Despite heavy investment in infrastructure, the agricultural sector was UC_Bayat_Herrera-text.indd 104 UC_Bayat_Herrera-text.indd 104 8/23/20 2:16 PM 8/23/20 2:16 PM"
