        "text": "Nasser was born on January 15, 1918, in Alexandria, Egypt. During his youth, Egypt was controlled by Great Britain. People in Egypt did not want to be dependent on Britain, so Nasser and others participated in anti-British street demonstrations.\n\nNasser graduated from the Royal Military Academy of Egypt in 1938. While he served in the Egyptian army, he met three fellow officers, including Anwar el-Sadat. This group formed a secret revolutionary organization called the Free Officers. Their aim was to force the British and the Egyptian royal family from power.\n\nOn July 23, 1952, Nasser and 89 other Free Officers forced the Egyptian monarchy from power. The officers took control of the country. Nasser named himself prime minister in 1954. He was elected president in June 1956.\n\nDuring his presidency, Nasser was responsible for much progress in Egypt. He gave women the right to vote, built the Aswan High Dam, and introduced modern technology into many villages. However, Egypt, under Nasser, was strictly controlled. Phone calls were monitored, and the media was censored.\n\nEgypt faced two significant international conflicts while Nasser was president. The first is known as the Suez Crisis. On July 26, 1956, Nasser declared that Egypt was taking over the Suez Canal. At the time, the canal was owned by France and Britain. Britain, France, and Israel tried to take it back by force. Egypt won.\n\nThe second conflict is known as the Six-Day War. In June 1967 war broke out between Israel and Egypt. Israel wiped out almost all of Egypt’s air force and took over the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War, Nasser tried to resign, but he was more popular than ever. People wanted him to continue his presidency. Nasser remained in office until his death in Cairo on September 28, 1970."
