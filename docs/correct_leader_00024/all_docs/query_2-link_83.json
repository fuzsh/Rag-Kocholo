        "text": "The last few weeks have seen violent scenes and several hundred deaths in Egypt following a crackdown on those protesting against the overthrow of democratically elected Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, by the powerful Egyptian military.\n\nThat ousting was itself triggered by widespread protests against Mr Morsi's government, which had come to power following a period of military rule after Hosni Mubarak was forced out of office in 2011.\n\nIn this look back at the history and legacy of military rule in Egypt, Middle East expert Dr Omar Ashour argues that the challenges facing the country following the Arab Spring go back to the era of President Nasser and before.\n\n\"The coup leader - the hero Mohammed Naguib - gave an example of humility by refusing promotion to the rank of 'lieutenant-general'â¦This proves that the army does not want power, just the general good,\" wrote Egypt's renowned historian, Abd al-Rahman al-Rafai, in al-Akhbar newspaper on 1 August 1952.\n\nHis statement did not stand the test of time.\n\nBy February 1954, the humble general, who acted as Egypt's first president, was removed by younger, more power-hungry officers led by Colonel Gamal Abdul Nasser.\n\nEgypt back then, as it is now, was divided.\n\nOne part of the country wanted a parliamentary democracy, a return to constitutionalism, and the army back to its barracks.\n\nAnother part of Egypt wanted a strong, unchecked charismatic patron who promised land and bread.\n\nBy November 1954, the latter part not only crushed the former, but also destroyed its demands. Basic freedoms and parliamentary constitutionalism were among the casualties.\n\nNasser did deliver on some of his promises, including land confiscation and redistribution, and confronting the United Kingdom, the former colonial power, in 1956.\n\nBut the cost was the establishment of an officers' republic: a state where the armed institutions are above any other, including the elected ones.\n\nAt the very least, security sector reform, democratic control of the armed forces, military and police oversight by civilian institutions, accountability to elected civilians, and budgetary transparency of the army were all radical, alien concepts for it. At worst, these concepts were threatening taboos and therefore should be eliminated or rendered meaningless.\n\nAfter the removal of Mubarak in February 2011, the Scaf had a minimum of three demands it insisted on: a veto in high politics, independence for the army's budget and economic empire, and legal immunity from prosecution on charges stemming from corruption or repression.\n\nIt also wanted constitutional prerogatives to guarantee those arrangements.\n\nThese demands were reflected in a July 2012 constitutional addendum that gave the Scaf the prerogatives of the first post-revolution parliament, dissolved by Scaf's decision number 350 on 30 June 2012 (following a constitutional court verdict that part of the parliament's electoral law was unconstitutional).\n\nThis decision vested all legislative powers in the Scaf only days before Egypt's first elected civilian president was scheduled to take office in July 2012.\n\nThe independent military-economic empire, which benefits from preferential customs and exchange rates, tax exemption, land ownership and confiscation rights (without paying the treasury) and an army of almost-free labourers (conscripted soldiers), is a source of much military influence and thus another thorny issue for any elected civilian.\n\nA black hole in the suffering Egyptian economy, post-revolution elected politicians might well seek to improve conditions by moving against the military's civilian assets and imposing oversight.\n\nBut in March 2012, a loud public warning was declared by General Mahmoud Nasr, a member of the Scaf in charge of financial affairs: \"This is our sweat and we will fight for itâ¦.we will never allow anyone near the projects of the armed forces.\"\n\nYet despite its power, the Scaf was quite sensitive to certain factors. Pressure from the United States is one of them, due to arming, training, equipping, and financing.\n\nStreet mobilisation is another factor. Most of the Scaf's pro-democracy decisions have come as a result of massive pressure from street protesters.\n\nThese include the removal of Hosni Mubarak, his trial, and that of other regime figures, and bringing the date of the presidential election forward to June 2012 from June 2013.\n\nA third factor that influenced the Scaf's decision-making is the army's internal cohesion.\n\n\"The sight of officers in uniform protesting in Tahrir Square and speaking on Al Jazeera really worries the field marshal,\" a former officer told me.\n\nOne way to maintain internal cohesion is to create \"demons\" - a lesson learned from the \"dirty wars\" in Algeria in the 1990s and Argentina in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nCoptic protesters were an easy target to rally soldiers and officers against.\n\nIn October 2011, the army cracked down on a rally protesting against the burning of a church.\n\nTwenty-eight Christian Copts were killed and more than 200 protesters were injured, but state-owned television featured a hospitalised Egyptian soldier screaming, external: \"The Christians - sons of dogs - killed us!\"\n\nThe systematic demonisation of anti-Scaf revolutionary groups, and the violent escalation that followed in November and December 2011, served the same purpose. After the coup of July 2013, the Muslim Brothers and Islamists became the new/old \"demons\".\n\nThey are not certain, but the future of Egypt's democracy is certainly in danger.\n\nWhen elected institutions are removed by military force, past patterns show that the outcome is almost never favourable to democracy: outright military dictatorship, military-domination of politics with a civilian facade, civil war, civil unrest or a mix of all of the above.\n\nA few highlights include Spain in 1936, Iran in 1953, Chile in 1973, Turkey in 1980, Sudan in 1989, and Algeria in 1992.\n\nThe July coup is a backward step for democratic civilian-military relations.\n\nEven more worrying are its regional implications.\n\nThe message sent by the coup to Libya, Syria, Yemen and beyond is that of militarising politics: only arms guarantee political rights, not the constitution, not democratic institutions and certainly not votes.\n\nIn the end, what remains certain is that no democratic transition is complete without targeting abuse, eradicating torture, ending exclusion, and annulling the impunity of security services, with effective and meaningful civilian control of both the armed forces and the security establishment.\n\nThis will always be the ultimate test of Egypt's democratic transition.\n\nDr Omar Ashour, external is a Senior Lecturer in Middle East Politics and Security Studies at the University of Exeter.\n\nHe is non-resident Fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and the author of The De-Radicalization of Jihadists: Transforming Armed Islamist Movements, external and From Good Cop to Bad Cop: The Challenge of Security Sector Reform in Egypt, external."
