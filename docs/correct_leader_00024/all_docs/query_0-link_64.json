        "text": "Few people in contemporary Middle East history and the Arab world have been as influential as Gamal Abdel Nasser, an Egyptian politician who created a Pan-Arabism ideology that broke away from the region´s traditional religious culture.\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser, an Egyptian politician and military officer, was born in Egypt in 1918. His training was decisive in his nation´s history, as the Royal Military Academy is where the Association of Free Officers, which in 1952 led the coup d'état that dethroned King Faruk (although the British are actually the ones who governed the country), was created\n\nThe creation of the new government could be configured around two different systems represented by two leaders of the revolution. On the one hand, the ideology of Muhammed Naguib, who was committed to creating a constituent assembly and defending public liberties. On the other, to implement the unitary and socialist regime proposed by Nasser. Naguib was forcedly removed from office in 1954 by Gamal Abdel Nasser, who assumed the highest magistracy in the country, subsequently becoming the visible leader of a socialist and Pan-Arab State with the name of a republic, who instilled nationalism and banned political opposition.\n\nHis leadership elevated him to a prestigious figure, also in the international world, especially with his position within the Non-Aligned Movement (neutrality in light of the USSR and USA power blocs during the Cold War). However, Soviet support slowly emerged throughout the years.\n\nTwo important crises, which also represent two important moments in world history, made their mark in the history of Nasser´s Egypt: the Suez Canal crisis and the Six-Day War, with the defeat of the Arabs. Twelve years later, Nasser died from a heart attack. Five million Egyptians and the Islamic world in general gave him a heartfelt tribute.\n\nSource: Wikipedia"
