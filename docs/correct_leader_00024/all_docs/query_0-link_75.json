He was 52 years old.‚†Ä\n-‚†Ä\nBorn in Alexandria, Egypt, on 15 January 1918, Nasser had been involved in political activism from an early age. In 1937, he dropped out of law school to join the Military Academy, where he would kick-start his military career.‚†Ä\n-‚†Ä\nIn July 1952, as a senior officer in the army, Nasser led a military coup that deposed King Farouk, the British-backed monarch of Egypt. Due to the success of the coup, he became prime minister, serving in that position until June 1956, when he was formerly elected president of the country.‚†Ä\n-‚†Ä\nDuring his life-long presidency, Nasser abolished political parties, establishing a one-party state with autocratic rule. His domestic and foreign policies often collided with the interest of Britain and France, most notably his 1956 nationalisation of the Suez Canal.‚†Ä\n-‚†Ä\nNasser was a hero in the Arab world. A strong proponent for socialism and the unity of the Arab people, he advocated socialist policies like free education and subsidies. The news of his death was met by great mourning across the Arab world. He was buried in Cairo, Egypt.‚†Ä\n____________‚†Ä\nüìù: Adams x Tomisin, Editorial Interns‚†Ä\nüì∑: The Egyptian Prime Minister, Gamal Abdel Nasser is cheered by a huge crowd on his arrival back in Cairo from Alexandria, where he announced he had taken over the Suez Canal Company, on 1 August 1956.
