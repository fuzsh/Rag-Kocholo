Formed on 22 February 1958 after the signing of the Act of the Unification of Egypt and Syria.\n\nThe largest cities are Cairo, Baghdad, Alexandria, Giza, Basra, Mosul.\n\nState structure[]\n\nThe state structure of the United Arab Republic is determined by the Interim Constitution, adopted on 5 March 1958, which proclaims the UAR as a federal presidential-parliamentary republic. In fact, the state is an authoritarian regime with a strong presidential power and a one-party system.\n\nLegislative power is exercised by a unicameral parliament, the People's Assembly (Arabic: الجمعية الوطنية), consisting of 600 people: the number of representatives from different regions is strictly fixed in accordance with the size of their population[1]. Elections are held in majoritarian constituencies — 2 deputies are elected in each constituency, and to be elected, each of them must collect more than 50% of the votes. If one or both candidates did not receive the required number of votes, and as well as if none of them is a representative of the working class or peasantry, a second round is held. Elections are actually uncontested — even at the stage of nominating candidates, all unreliable elements are eliminated through the so-called “Conferences of candidates” (Arabic: مؤتمرات المرشحين) involving the party and military bureaucracy. In addition, Article 16 of the Constitution stipulates that “in cases of extreme necessity,” the President of the Republic is empowered to cancel elections in the constituency and appoint both representatives by decree.\n\nThe only and indisputable head of the UAR is in fact its president (Arabic: الرئيس), who is directly elected by the population for a 6-year term. The number of possible terms of office is not regulated in any way. In fact, the presidential candidacy is approved by a referendum — in a one-party system, the voters are left with only the right to approve or reject the figure proposed by the Arab Socialist Union (Arabic: الاتحاد الاشتراكي العربي). The president alone manages foreign policy, is the supreme commander in chief of the armed forces, issues regulations that have the force of laws, etc. In the event of martial law, the president also receives the authority to appoint mayors of cities, the leadership of universities, can subject people to arrest or evict them. Among other things, the president single-handedly appoints vice-presidents (Arabic: نائب الرئيس), the number of which is not limited — most often 2 vice presidents represent one UAR state — and the prime minister (Arabic: رئيس الوزراء), who leads the government and presenting ministerial candidates to the president for approval. Since there are no laws prohibiting the combination of posts in the UAR, one and the same person can be president, prime minister and minister at the same time.\n\nGeographically, the UAR is divided into regions (Arabic: منطقة) - the former independent states that became part of the Republic. Each district, in turn, consists of provinces or governorates (Arabic: محافظة), which are subdivided into urban and rural. On the local level, the regional branches of the Arab Socialist Union play an important role, which has great influence, especially among the rural population.\n\nList of UAR presidents[]\n\nNational Union\n\nArab Socialist Union\n\n№ Photo Name Term Party 1 Gamal Abdel Nasser\n\n(1918—1970) 22 February 1958 28 September 1970 National union Arab Socialist Union — Ali Sabri\n\n(1920—1991) 28 September 1970 15 October 1970 Arab Socialist Union 2 15 October 1970\n\nHistory[]\n\nTowards unification[]\n\nOn 23 July 1952, during the July Revolution in Egypt, the Free Officers group, led by 34-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, overthrew the Egyptian monarchy and proclaimed the republic — the Revolutionary Command Council, led by Nasser and General Mohammed Naguib, came to power. The latter was offered the post of prime minister, and in 1953 — the first president of Egypt. However, very quickly, the two leaders of the revolution became political opponents — Naguib was more of a moderate conservative, while Nasser intended to carry out large-scale reforms in the country, eliminating the remnants of feudalism and making Egypt a secular state. On 26 February 1954, Naguib was removed from the post of chairman of the RCC, and on 14 November, after the unsuccessful attempt on the life of the Muslim Brotherhood on Nasser's life, he was also stripped of his presidential powers.\n\nAs a result, Nasser became a full-fledged head of Egypt — under his leadership an agrarian reform took place, the old political parties were disbanded, and in January 1953, the \"Liberation Congress\", campaigned in support of Nasser, and on 23 June 1956, in a referendum, the population voted for the adoption of a constitution developed by the Nasserists, according to which, for example, women received voting rights for the first time in the Arab world. The constitution enshrined the one-party system, and the Liberation Congress on 28 May 1957 was reorganized into the National Union party.\n\nAt first, Nasser maneuvered between the superpowers and even tried to improve relations with Israel, but in February 1955, after the Israelis seized the Gaza Strip and Britain's refusal to sell weapons to Egypt, he was forced to turn to the socialist camp for support. In April, Nasser took part in the Bandung Conference, during which he developed friendly relations with the leaders of the future Non-Aligned Movement Josip Broz Tito, Mohammed Mossadegh and Jawaharlal Nehru, and on 27 September a contract was signed with Czechoslovakia, which agreed to supply the Egyptians with weapons worth $ 320 million. The response to this step was the refusal of the United Kingdom and the United States to finance the construction of the Aswan Dam, despite they had previously promised to help Nasser with. On 26 July 1956, Nasser announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal in order to use the proceeds from its operation to build a dam, which led to a secret agreement in Sevres between Britain, France and Israel for a trilateral intervention against Egypt.\n\nSuez Crisis[]\n\nThe culmination of the Suez crisis came on 29 October, when Israel Defense Forces soldiers attacked Egyptian troops in the Sinai Peninsula as part of Operation Kadesh — on the 3rd day of the war, the British and French joined the intervention, and by 7 November they completely occupied Sinai and the Suez Canal zone. Egypt was on the brink of a military catastrophe, but it was in this situation that the United States and the USSR came to its aid, which achieved the withdrawal of interventionist troops and the entry of UN forces into the conflict zone. For the Soviet Union, the decision to support Egypt was not easy and closely intertwined with the struggle for power within the CPSU — Malenkov and his nominees, primarily Shepilov and Kuznetsov, were in favor of improving relations with the Arab world, while Molotov and Kaganovich, who held pro-Israeli positions, were against. By this time, Moscow already had close relations with another Muslim state — Iran — largely through whose mediation negotiations with Cairo were conducted. The weakening of Molotov's positions in the leadership and the beginning of the rapprochement of the USSR with the United States and Yugoslavia, with which Nasser had already established contacts, tipped the balance in favor of an alliance with Egypt.\n\nThe Soviet-Egyptian rapprochement led to the fact that Nasser's policy began to shift more and more \"to the left\" — on 15 January 1957, the \"Egyptianization\" law was adopted, that is, the transfer of foreign banks, foreign trade, industrial and transport companies into the hands of the Egyptian Arabs, all are British and French. On 1 November, Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer arrived in Moscow on a 20-day visit, and on 29 January 1958, the two countries signed an agreement on economic cooperation. At the same time, the attitude of the Soviet leadership towards Nasser remained wary, mainly due to the persecution of the Egyptian leader of the communists, as well as the ties of some people from his entourage, for example, the secretary of the National Union Anwar Sadat, with the Nazis during the Second World War.\n\nAfter the Suez crisis, Nasser began to be perceived as the leader of the entire Arab world — back in January 1957, Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia signed the Arab Solidarity Pact, and on 11—12 September, at the talks in Cairo, an agreement was reached on the future unification of Egypt and Syria, where the nasserists also came to power in 1955, the parliaments of both republics approved the unification project on 18 November 1958, all the relevant documents were signed after the referendum on 21 February, at which the population of Egypt and Syria almost without exception voted for unification and the election of Nasser as president, the creation of the United Arab Republic was proclaimed.\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser's reign[]\n\nThe creation of the UAR further strengthened Nasser's influence in the Arab world — on 8 March, the Crown Prince of North Yemen concluded an agreement with him to create a confederal union of the United Arab States; in May, the Nasserists raised an uprising in Lebanon, which required the intervention of American troops to suppress; on 14 July, a group of Iraqi officers overthrew and killed King Faisal II, proclaiming a republic in Iraq and starting a rapprochement with the UAR. Success of his foreign policy inspired Nasser so much that on 19 July he openly admitted for the first time that he was fighting for the unification of all Arab countries.\n\nHowever, the success was temporary — on 9 March 1959, relations between Nasser and the ruler of Iraq, General Abd al-Karim Qasim, deteriorated after the last suppression of the Naserist uprising in Mosul, and in 1961 a serious crisis arose in Syria.\n\nPolitics in Syria[]\n\nEgypt clearly dominated the UAR, since significantly surpassed Syria in terms of territory, population, and economic indicators. Nevertheless, the Syrians still occupied a number of important positions in the state — for example, the governor of the new region of Nasser, in addition to his closest associate Marshal Amer, also appointed the ex-head of the Syrian intelligence service Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, and the last Prime Minister and Speaker of the Parliament of independent Syria — al-Asali and al-Hawrani — received the posts of vice-presidents of the UAR. In October 1958, the administration of the Syrian region was reorganized — the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Zakaria Mohieddin, who led the repression against the anti-Nasser opposition, was instructed to head the Committee for the Development of Syria. Amer, al-Sarraj and Mohieddin turned their territories into a police state, persecuting anyone who opposed Egyptian-style land reform, nationalization of industry and the banking sector. All Syrian political parties were disbanded, including the Ba'ath.\n\nNasser's \"socialist\" reforms displeased the Syrian elite, who held important positions in the management of the economy and the army. On 28 September 1961, supporters of the secession from the UAR carried out a coup and arrested Marshal Amer. In response to this, units loyal to Nasser revolted in northern Syria, thousands of demonstrations in support of Nasser were held in the cities, and an Egyptian landing force landed in Latakia on 30 September. The separatist forces were in the minority and soon capitulated — the organizers of the rebellion, the Kuzbari brothers were arrested, Marshal Amer was released, but Nasser thought it good to recall him to Egypt.\n\nReforms in Syria were put on hold for a while, Egyptian Mahmoud Riad, an experienced diplomat whose career began under the monarchy, was appointed governor of Syria amid growing discontent with al-Sarraj, and after Riad ascended to the head of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of UAR, he was replaced by Syrian General Lu'ay al-Atassi.\n\nExpanding influence[]\n\nOn 27 September 1962, Colonel Abdullah al-Sallal overthrew the last king of North Yemen, proclaiming the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) — on 5 October, the king receve supported by Saudi Arabia, starting the bombing of cities loyal to the republicans, many Zaidi tribes went over to his side, a civil war broke out in the country. Al-Salal appealed to Nasser, who declared his determination to provide YAR with all possible support. In July 1962, France recognized the independence of Algeria, which Nasser considered his personal victory, since he had long financed Algerian independence fighters. On 8 February 1963, Iraqi Baathists overthrew General Qasim — on 14 March, Iraq applied to join the UAR.\n\nIn the 1960s, the UAR's influence in the world increased significantly, since at the Belgrade Conference in September 1961, the creation of the Non-Aligned Movement, headed by Tito, Mossadegh, Nehru, Sukarno and Nasser, was formally announced. The second congress of this movement was held in 1964 in Cairo. Thanks to Nasser's efforts, the Organization of African Unity and the Organization for the Liberation of Palestine were created, the first chairman of which was his protégé Ahmad Shukeiri. On 15 May 1963, a referendum was held on the territory of the UAR and Iraq on the latter's joining the federation. The next day, Iraq officially became the third region of the UAR, and its rulers Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Abdul Salam Arif received vice-presidential posts. The new head of Algeria, Houari Boumedienne, also considered the possibility of joining the UAR, but this project was never implemented. On 15 March 1964, Nasser was re-elected to a second presidential term in a referendum, receiving, as always, the unanimous support of voters.\n\nModernization of the country[]\n\nSince 1961, Nasser openly proclaimed the ideology of a \"second revolution\" that would combine Islam with socialism. Large-scale reforms in the field of culture began, during which mixed schools were created, where boys and girls studied at the same time, the teaching of evolution was included in the curriculum, secular and religious courts were united, Shiites, Alawites and Druze were equated with the Sunni population. In 1962, Nasser introduced the National Charter, which called for a universal health care system, affordable housing, vocational schools, women's empowerment, family planning, and the expansion of the Suez Canal. On 4 November 1961, the National Union was renamed the Arab Socialist Union (ASU).\n\nMany of Nasser's associates opposed the socialist course — the vice-presidents Latif Boghdadi and el-Shafei resigned, but the president did not think curtailing the reforms. A minimum wage was introduced, the accrual of a share of the enterprise's profits to its employees, free education and medicine, reduced working hours, guarantees of protection of the rights of farmers-tenants, thanks to which it was possible to achieve an increase in agricultural production and reduce the number of hungry in rural areas. As a result of nationalization, the share of the state in the Egyptian economy increased to 51%.\n\nOn 9 January 1960, construction began on the Aswan Dam — the largest hydraulic structure on the African continent. In addition to the UAR government, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Iran and a number of Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, took part in financing the construction. And although the construction was formally completed only after the death of Nasser, already in 1967 the Aswan hydroelectric power station occupied the 6th place in the world in terms of capacity and provided electricity to half of Egypt.\n\nConfrontation with Amer[]\n\nThe separatist insurgency in Syria seriously complicated relations between Nasser and Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer, who, in addition to destabilizing the situation in the Northern Region, was blamed for turning the army and intelligence into a “state within a state” and did not bother to modernize the armed forces. At the end of 1961, a Presidential Council was created, which approved appointments to the highest army posts, which Amer previously did alone, and in 1962 he was stripped of the post of defense minister and the post of commander-in-chief. On 2 October, on the third day after his resignation, Egyptian officers loyal to Amer blockaded Nasser's house, demanding that the marshal be reinstated in office, but the president did not give in to their threats — about 50 people were arrested through the efforts of al-Sarraj on charges of attempting a coup d'etat. On 20 October, a meeting took place between Nasser and Amer, at which the latter demanded the release of all arrested military officers. Nasser went to meet him, but all the released immediately re-entered into a conspiracy to return Amer to power — on 4 January 1963, an armed mutiny was planned, the forces of the airborne school cadets were supposed to seize the General Staff and dictate their conditions to the president.\n\nHowever, a day before the speech, Amer and several hundred of his supporters in the army were arrested - the marshal was put under house arrest, and on 23 January, according to the official version, he committed suicide by taking poison. Despite the conflict that arose between them, Nasser announced the death of Amer as the loss of his \"closest friend.\" The post of commander-in-chief was transferred to Mohamed Fawzi, the commander of the expeditionary force in North Yemen, who was in pro-socialist positions.\n\nInternal conflicts[]\n\nThe defeat of the opposition by the military forced Nasser to seriously change the government of the country — the number of vice presidents was reduced from 6 to 4 (one was appointed to Syria and Iraq and two to Egypt), almost all the “rightists” were dismissed, which led to an uprising The Muslim Brotherhood in the Syrian Hama in 1964. Lu'ay al-Atassi, despite his personal loyalty to Nasser, showed himself not on the best side as a politician, gradually yielding influence to the former Baathists — Amin al-Hafiz, Salah Jadid, Yusuf Zuayyin (they represented the \"left\" and were guided by the USSR) and Hafez Assad (who was more of a national-democrat). Under the leadership of Zueyin since 1965, radical socialist reforms, modeled on the Egyptian ones, unfolded in the Syrian region again.\n\nIn Iraq, the situation was much more complicated, because there were acute religious and national contradictions. Under the leadership of Abdul Salam Arif, repressions against the opposition unfolded in the country — up to 5,000 people were killed, another 10,000 were imprisoned. In addition, the Kurds remained a constant headache - at first their leader Mustafa Barzani, who maintained contacts with Arif before he came to power, counted on the opportunity to negotiate with Baghdad, but after the refusal to grant autonomy to Kurdistan on 9 July 1963, hostilities between Arabs and Kurds resumed. In January 1964, Aref expelled the Baathists from the state apparatus, as a result of which the Prime Minister and Vice President al-Bakr lost their posts, and on 14 July laws were passed on the nationalization of large enterprises in industry and trade, all banks and insurance companies, including branches of foreign banks and insurance companies. In the fall, Baath attempted to overthrow the failed Arif — many Baathist leaders, including Saddam Hussein, ended up in prisons.\n\nGradually, the contradictions between Arif and Nasser grew — the leader of Iraq acted too independently of Cairo, threatening to destabilize the situation in the republic, so the president decided to replace Aref with his loyal General Arif Abd ar-Razzaq, who headed the Executive Council of Iraq. On 30 June 1966, by the forces of the 4th division stationed in Mosul, Arif was arrested and deprived of the post of vice-president — Razzak became the head of the Iraqi region, supporters of the ousted leader went to prison, but a year later many of them were released. The coup took place in the midst of negotiations with the Kurds on the conclusion of a truce — Barzani perceived the rise to power of Razzak as an unfavorable signal, so he announced the denunciation of the truce.\n\nArabian revolution[]\n\nOn 2 November 1964, the King of Saudi Arabia Saud bin Abdulaziz, who was at one time an ally of Nasser, was removed from the throne by his much more pro-American brother Faisal. Faisal actually ruled the Saudi government since 1962, and largely under his influence, Saudi Arabian troops invaded Yemen to suppress the Nasserist rebellion, which seriously complicated relations with the UAR. In response, Nasser stated:\n\n“ To liberate all of Jerusalem, the Arab peoples must first liberate Riyadh. ”\n\nNasser openly supported the opposition within the Saudi dynasty — the \"Free Princes Movement\", led by Talal bin Abdulaziz, demanded the introduction of a constitution in the country, parliamentarism and an independent court. From September 1962, Egyptian, Syrian and Yemeni radio stations began to openly urge the Saudis to rebel against their \"corrupt\" and \"reactionary\" monarchy. In 1966, the first coup attempt took place — the conspirators set off bombs near the palace of the Interior Minister Prince Fahd, in the office of the American adviser in Riyadh, in the buildings of the capital's post office and the security headquarters in Ad Dammam, as well as at an airbase near the Yemeni border. However, the coup failed — King Faisal appealed to the United States, which confirmed that they are the guarantors of the territorial integrity of Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn 1969, many more people were involved in the conspiracy — primarily, officers of the Saudi Air Force. The National Liberation Front (NLF) was formed, which included the Chief of the General Staff, the Director of the Air Force Academy in Dhahran, the commander of the Al-Hasa military garrison, the former commander of the Mecca garrison, and others — over 50 officers and generals in total. In total, between 200 and 300 people were involved in the conspiracy. On 12 July, several rebel-controlled Saudi Air Force planes took off from Dhahran airfield and headed for Riyadh. At about 7:30 am, the royal palace was bombed, killing King Faisal, as well as princes Khalid and Fahd, and Prince Mohammed seriously wounded. At the same time, the leader of the conspirators, Colonel Daud Rumi, spoke on the radio from the military base in Dhahran, who proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Arabia.\n\nGarrisons in the western part of the country, the former kingdom of Hejaz, from which a significant part of the NLF was formed, went over to the side of the conspirators almost immediately. The capital was quickly occupied by forces stationed in Mecca and Al-Khas, and on 15 July, Abdullah Tariki, a former oil minister, expelled from Saudi Arabia for his liberal views, returned to the country, who was offered the post of prime minister. On the model of Egypt, the Revolutionary Command Council was formed, led by Colonels Rumi and al-Arami, which was immediately recognized by Nasser. Ideologically, the RCC was nasserist, but liberals, supporters of the Baath party and even Marxists were also represented in it.\n\nSeptember war[]\n\nThe revolution in Arabia alarmed Israel and Jordan most of all — the former was surrounded on all sides by left-wing pan-Arabist regimes, sharply hostile to the Jewish state, and King Hussein of Jordan, who previously had a reliable ally on the eastern borders, now remained the only monarch in the Levant and in the conditions of a rapid deterioration in relations with Nasser, he lived in constant expectation of a conspiracy. By this time, the situation on the Arab-Israeli border since 5 years already resembled a sluggish war — the conflict was constantly fueled by the Palestinian Arabs, who committed sabotage against Israel, and in the spring of 1967, due to the dispute over the Golan Heights, full-fledged hostilities almost began.\n\nThe overthrow of the Saudi monarchy unleashed Nasser, who got rid of the main rival in the Arab world — having lost support, the North Yemeni monarchists suffered a final defeat, in connection with which the UAR troops fighting in Yemen could be used against Israel, and, in addition, still in 1965, a supporter of Nasser Abdullah al-Asnag came to power in the Federation of South Arabia, which gained independence from Great Britain, and transformed the Federation into the People's Republic of South Yemen (PRSY). The nasserists suffered a failure only in Libya, where on 13 August 1969, an officer's conspiracy led by Captain Gaddafi was revealed. On 17 August, Nasser received a notification from Soviet intelligence about the concentration of IDF forces on the border with the UAR — after which Cairo accused the government of Golda Meir of provoking aggression and demanded the withdrawal of UN troops from the ceasefire line, which had been patrolling it since 1956. On 25 August, after the withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces, the UAR announced a general mobilization — 5 days later than Israel and 4 days later than Jordan. Mohammed Fawzi — Minister of War of the United Arab Republic — flew to Moscow on 29 August to obtain permission to attack Israel, but at a meeting with the head of the Soviet government, Mikhail Zimyanin, that was refused: the Soviet Union promised to stand up for the Arabs only if the Israelis were the first to strike the United States openly come into conflict.\n\nNasser was ready to temporarily stop preparations for war, but on 31 August a school bus was blown up by a mine planted by Palestinian militants in the Eilat area, which was used by Israel as a pretext for war. On 1 September, King Hussein was asked to maintain neutrality in exchange for guarantees of non-aggression and the preservation of East Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramallah and other territories beyond Jordan, to which the king agreed, hoping that the Israelis would bleed the nasserists and the threat of a republican revolution in his possessions would disappear. On 3 September, the IDF went on the offensive along the entire border with the UAR, and the Israeli Air Force attacked the airfields of Egypt, Syria and Iraq, securing almost overwhelming air supremacy - only the Commander of the Syrian Air Force, Major General Hafez al-Assad, managed to keep his forces relatively combat-ready , but they could no longer decide the outcome of the war. On 7—10 September, during a large-scale tank battle near Mount Hermon, after which almost 330 tanks and over 200 armored vehicles were left on the battlefield, the Golan Heights were captured by the Israelis.\n\nOn the Sinai Peninsula, Generals Mohammed Fawzi and Abdul Munim Riad correctly assessed the situation on the very first day and proposed to withdraw troops to the Suez Canal and build a defense based on it, but Nasser rejected this plan. On 5 September, after the capture of Gaza, Israeli general Ariel Sharon attacked two Egyptian armies at the junction and began to rapidly advance westward. Only then did Nasser allow the withdrawal, but by this time the threat of encirclement hung over the Arab troops in the Sinai. To restrain the movement of Sharon's troops, Fawzi threw tanks against the enemy rushing to the Suez Canal — on 6—7 September, a large-scale battle took place at Nehel, in which over 600 tanks and armored vehicles came together from both sides. The battle ended with the complete defeat of the Arabs, but nevertheless, the delay in the IDF offensive allowed Fawzi to build defenses along the canal — for about 2 days, the UAR soldiers successfully held back enemy attacks, but on 10 September, Sharon's forces broke through the canal south of Ismailia, almost putting Egypt on the brink military disaster.\n\nOn 10 September, the UN Security Council achieved a ceasefire in the Middle East — at 19:30 Defense Minister Moshe Dayan gave the order to withdraw troops east of the canal, and the next day the Arabs laid down their arms. The fighting thus lasted 8 days and resulted in a heavy defeat for the UAR — its losses were estimated at 10,200 killed, about 17,600 wounded and 5,000 prisoners. According to official figures, Israel lost only 1,170 soldiers killed, 3,320 wounded and only 114 prisoners.\n\nNasser's government crisis[]\n\nOn 10 September, on the day of the breakthrough of Sharon's divisions near Ismailia, Nasser announced his voluntary resignation on the radio, but hundreds of thousands of Arabs, among whom the president was still extremely popular, took to the streets of the UAR cities on the same day, chanting: “We are your soldiers, Gamal!\" On 11 September, Nasser agreed to return to power — on 20 September, he also took over the posts of head of the Executive Council of the Egyptian region and the commander-in-chief of the ground forces. He promised large-scale reforms, the essence of which was outlined in the manifesto of 2 July 1970 — the endowment of citizens with all rights and freedoms, greater independence of parliament from the executive branch, and a large-scale anti-corruption campaign were proclaimed. Even earlier — on 5 June — the powers of the special services were significantly curtailed, in connection with which Nasser solemnly announced \"the end of the state of Mukhabarat [2]\" On 4 August, at a referendum, the president's program was approved, and he himself was re-elected for another term, and after that elections were held to the supreme body of the Arab Socialist Union — the Supreme Executive Committee. Nasser hoped to draft a permanent constitution by the end of the year, which would consolidate all his transformations, but did not manage to do this.\n\nSeeing that the Soviet economic model on Arab soil did not bring victory over Israel, Nasser began a gradual pivot to the right, weakening control over the private sector, raising taxes to overcome budget deficits, encouraging government loans and stimulating exports. Dissatisfied with the actions of the Syrians during the September war, immediately after the ceasefire, he replaced the leadership of the Syrian region — Lu'ay al-Atassi was dismissed, Amin al-Hafez became the vice-president and governor of Nasser, and Salah Jadid led the Syrian troops. The resignation of old associates of Nasser was also planned, primarily the vice-presidents of Zakaria Mohieddin and Ali Sabri. They also discussed projects to include North and South Yemen and Arabia in the UAR. On 1 September 1970, following the assassination of King Hussein by members of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine Marxist organization, civil war broke out in Jordan. Nasser, who considered Hussein a traitor because of his neutrality during the conflict with Israel, planned a military operation in support of the Jordanian Republicans, but on 28 September, when the date and plan of the invasion had already been agreed, he suddenly died of a heart attack before he was 60 years old.\n\nNasser's funeral gathered almost 5 million people — all the leaders of the Arab world arrived, except for the kings of Hassan of Jordan, the brother of the murdered Hussein, and Idris of Libya, as well as the head of the USSR Council of Ministers Zimyanin and French Prime Minister Valerie Giscard d'Estaing. During the 18 years that Nasser led Egypt and the UAR, the country completely got rid of British influence and became one of the leaders of the Third World. The citizens of the republic were provided with housing, education, work, healthcare, benefits, etc. in an unprecedented amount. The President was known for his close relations with the people, was available to ordinary people, as a result of which he enjoyed their love during his lifetime and after his death.\n\nVice Presidents of the UAR at the time of Nasser's death\n\nAli Sabri's reign[]\n\nAt the time of Nasser's death, four people in the UAR were serving as vice-president — Zakaria Mohieddin, Ali Sabri, Amin al-Hafiz and Arif Abd ar-Razzaq. The latter two represented Syria and Iraq, so they were not seen as contenders for Nasser's inheritance — a power struggle unfolded between Mohieddin, a right-wing leader and supporter of normalizing relations with the United States, and Sabri, a consistent socialist. Fatigue from socialist transformations and the disappointing results of the September War played against Sabri, but Mohieddin's positions turned out to be even more precarious — on 10 September 1969, Nasser officially resigned in his favor, but Mohieddin didn't understand the president's game and agreed take power, which immediately incurred his suspicions. In his political testament, Nasser recommended the election of Sabri as the interim head of state until the new elections, but refused to recognize him as his official successor.\n\nSabri was not among the leaders of the July Revolution, but very quickly became part of the top leadership of Egypt — during the February crisis of 1954, when General Naguib was ousted from power, he ensured the loyalty of the Air Force to Nasser, which he was close to them, becoming an assistant to the president. At one time he headed the Egyptian special services, held various ministerial posts. It was Ali Sabri who led the creation of the Arab Socialist Union, as well as its militarized structure — the \"Vanguard of the Socialists\", which was staffed in many respects by former communists. On 1 October 1965, he was named vice president.\n\nPower struggle[]\n\nSabri was considered the most loyal supporter of the Soviet Union in the leadership of the UAR — since 1967 he has been in constant polemics with the Mohieddin group, which sought to remove the party from the commanding heights in the economy. By the time of Nasser's death, Sabri had been promoted to air marshal, concentrating control over the army, party, interior ministry and intelligence in his hands, and in addition he enjoyed the support of Soviet military advisers, of whom there were about 30,000 people in the UAR. With the death of Nasser, the post of prime minister of the UAR, which he held after the September war, was also vacated — Sabri immediately took advantage of this, having achieved the appointment of his protege Sharawi Gomaa as head of government. On 15 October 1970, Sabri became the only candidate in the presidential elections, having received the support of over 90% of voters and was declared president on the same day.\n\nOn 21 April 1971, there was an open conflict between Sabri and Mohieddin — on that day, thank to the forces of General Fawzi, loyal to the president, the vice-president himself, chairman of the National Assembly Anwar Sadat, ex-ministers of planning and economy, as well as the chief of the General headquarters of Muhammad Sadek and the commander of the Republican Guard, General Natif were arrested. Those arrested were accused of plotting a coup to overthrow Sabri — on 4 August, 91 accused were brought to trial, during which Mohieddin and several others were sentenced to death, immediately commuted to 25 years of hard labor.\n\nThe April events were declared by the UAR press as \"the revolution on 21 April, which correcting the revolution on 23 July,\" but Sabri himself preferred to speak of them as a \"correctional movement\" that stopped the attempt to deviate from the path chosen by Nasser. Speaking on 25 July 1972 at the opening of the ASU congress, he declared that \"we have no other revolution than the 23 July revolution.\" Nevertheless, the situation in the country has changed significantly — on 27 May 1971, the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the UAR and the USSR was signed, and on 12 June, Sabri openly proclaimed the task of building socialism in the Middle East:\n\n“ The determination to continue moving along the path of socialist transformations and the creation of a socialist society is the historical predetermination of our nation! ”\n\nJordanian Civil War[]\n\nKing Hussein's neutrality during the September War allowed him to maintain control over East Jerusalem and the West Bank of the Jordan River, but for the Arab world he suddenly turned into a traitor to national interests — Palestinian Arab organizations acted on Jordanian territory, constantly committing sabotage against the Israelis, who actually created in the possession of Hussein \"state within a state.\" In addition to the PLO, which had a young leader Yasser Arafat in 1969, and its militant wing, Fatah, there were communist armed organizations — the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), as well as all kinds of nationalist, Baathist and other groups.\n\nIn June 1970, the royal government tried to disarm the militants, to which they responded by starting an armed struggle against the royal power — on 1 September DFLP militants killed Hussein, after which his 23-year-old brother Hassan took the crown. The Palestinians were openly supported by the Chief of the General Staff of Jordan, General Al-Jazi — the army almost split, and only thanks to the efforts of the new King Hassan, it was possible to maintain the loyalty of most of the monarchy's units. On 18 September, the UAR leadership decided to intervene in support of the Palestinians, but the death of Nasser prevented the plan from being fully implemented. Nevertheless, in addition to Cairo, Riyadh also began to provide armed assistance to the PLO — at this time, since six months between Arabia and the United States, a diplomatic crisis was raging, caused by the hostage-taking at the American embassy in Jeddah, and on 23 September it reached its climax when the US military commanders launched Operation Sandstorm to free the hostages, which ended in complete failure.\n\nThe situation of King Hassan became more and more alarming — at the west he was threatened by up to 40,000 armed Palestinians, and at the east Jordan was invaded by a 10,000-strong Arabian corps. Since the Red Sea was blocked by the forces of five Arab states that supported the PLO, the United States decided to deploy its 6th Fleet off the coast of Israel and supply weapons to the Jordanians through it. On 27 September, the Jordanian Air Force struck the territory of Arabia — the region could be engulfed in a major war at any moment.\n\nNevertheless, despite the fact that by the end of the month the fighting was already taking place in the vicinity of Amman — the capital of the kingdom — the UAR never sided with the Palestinians. After the death of Nasser, the leadership had enough internal problems, moreover, the country had not yet fully recovered from the severe defeat in the September War. The decisive battle took place on 30 September at Karam — in it the Jordanian army managed to win, after which the scales began to lean towards King Hassan. By the end of the year, Arabian troops had left Jordan.\n\nActive hostilities in the West Bank continued until the end of November 1971, and individual groups of Palestinians staged terrorist attacks against the royal troops even in 1973—1974. The total number of victims of the conflict exceeded 25,000, and another 150,000 Palestinians fled Jordan, which was a heavy blow for the country of 1.5 million. Most of the militants, led by Arafat, took refuge in Lebanon, from where they continued to sabotage the Israelis and Jordanians, but the territory of Palestine was now firmly controlled by the Hashemites. One of the consequences of the civil war in Jordan was a surge in international terrorism — at the Berlin Olympics in 1972, members of the \"Black September\" organization, named in memory of the Jordanian events, took hostage members of the Israeli Olympic team, 17 of whom died during their release.\n\nCoup in Iraq[]\n\nAfter the defeat in the September War, the popularity of Nasser and his loyal General Razzak in Iraq was greatly shaken — against the latter a conspiracy led by the underground Baathists and supporters of Iraqi independence, who on 15 October 1970, immediately after receiving news of the president's death, made a bloodless coup in Baghdad and removing Razzak to Egypt. The country was headed by the Revolutionary Command Council, chaired by the conservative general Abdel Aziz al-Okayli, who two weeks later — on 28 October — arrested the entire leadership of the Baath party led by al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein, establishing a military dictatorship in the country.\n\nAl-Okayli's regime was of a nationalistic nature — he was skeptical of pan-Arabism, sought to turn Iraq into a state independent of both superpowers, and also advocated a military solution to the Kurdish issue. At first, his power remained fragile and Cairo could count on the success of the intervention against the Iraqi separatists, but these plans were not destined to come true — the leadership of the UAR was busy with an internal struggle, and in addition, on 30 October, there was an unsuccessful coup attempt in Syria by General Hafez al-Assad. Thanks to the efforts of Salah Jadid and Yusuf Zuayyin, loyal to Cairo, they managed to keep Syria within the UAR, but internal turmoil buried plans for military operations against Iraq and Jordan.\n\nAs a result, on 31 October, Ali Sabri recognized the separation of Iraq and made a change in the leadership of the Syrian region — Jadid and Zuayyin received the posts of vice presidents, the former governor Amin al-Hafiz lost his post and left politics. The UAR as a federation was preserved, but the plans to include Arabia, Yemen and Jordan were temporarily abandoned. The only success of pan-Arabism was the unification of North and South Yemen into a single state headed by Abdullah al-Salal in 1972.\n\nPeace with Israel[]\n\nAttempts at a peaceful settlement in the Middle East were made constantly after the end of the September war — in August 1970, as a result of the mission of diplomat Gunnar Jarring and with the active mediation of German Chancellor Willie Brandt, Egypt agreed to conclude peace with Israel in exchange for the return of the occupied territories. The Jarring Plan was, however, initially rejected by the Israelis, who refused to retreat from the Sinai and the Golan Heights before the start of official negotiations — only US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was able to rehabilitate the idea of ​​a peace treaty, who in June 1971 put forward a draft settlement based on UN Security Council Resolution No. 270. On 19 June , the Israeli government agreed to return the occupied territories to the UAR, which opened up an opportunity for improving relations between Arabs and Israelis.\n\nAli Sabri, having received Moscow's approval through the Soviet representative Yevgeny Primakov, announced his intention to visit Israel by the end of the year — this decision was truly revolutionary, since for the first time an Arab leader de facto recognized the right of the Jewish state to exist. Sabri arrived in Israel on 17 November visiting West Jerusalem, where he addressed the Knesset, urging the government of Golda Meir to sit down at the negotiating table. This visit caused a mixed reaction in the world — Arab states such as Libya, Jordan and Lebanon, condemned the president's peace initiative, but there were also expressions of support from Sudan, Yemen and Somalia. The leaders of the Palestinian Arabs declared Sabri as a traitor to the common cause, but after the defeat in Jordan, their position no longer had the same weight.\n\nOn 15 September 1972, agreements were signed in Geneva on the return of the UAR Sinai and the Golan Heights and on the creation of demilitarized zones on the border, and on 24 March 1973, Sabri and Golda Meir signed a peace treaty between the UAR and Israel. The withdrawal of Israeli troops was completed by 1976.\n\nRelations with the Arab world[]\n\nNotes[]\n\nto be continued...\n\nCredit[]\n\nThe universe \"Socialism with Human Face\" is the intellectual property of his author Huey Long on the site Альтернативная История.
