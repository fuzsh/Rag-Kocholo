        "text": "Almost seven in the evening, and night is slowly falling over Alexandria’s vast Mohammed Ali Square, where a well-behaved crowd is hemmed in by police cordons. A pleasant breeze is blowing, raising the spirits of all gathered here, especially as we have just endured one of the hottest weeks on record. We are standing on a balcony where President Gamal Abdel Nasser will soon deliver a speech. It’s only 20 metres from where Muhammad Abed al-Latif, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, fired eight shots at Nasser (as “an agent of Anglo-American imperialism”) two years before.\n\nThe Egyptian president appears, walks past us and climbs to the rostrum. Apparently unconcerned by any memory of the attack, Nasser smiles a little. He takes the microphone and begins to address the crowd. This is not the sort of speech people are used to. What are we to make of his popular, even vulgar, baladi tone? The crowd hangs on his every word, every nuance. His up-beat tone wins them over. We came here expecting a monologue with tragic overtones; instead we are getting comic relief.\n\n“Now I just want to mention the problems I’ve had with the American diplomatic corps.” Nasser, usually austere, adopts the mocking tone of Egypt’s satirical songwriters and the language of the poor. The crowd bursts out laughing.\n\n“A US diplomat told me this: if Mr Allen (1) delivers a State Department message to you about Czech arms sales (2), you’ve got to send him packing. But if he returns to the US without relaying the message, Mr Dulles will send Mr Allen packing.” Nasser is acting, relishing his role as the cunning Goha (3) battling foreign behemoths.\n\nSurprised by this style, some Egyptian journalists are murmuring “kuwais awi” (very good) under their breath. This timid, self-conscious man has finally discovered how to speak to the people — with humour. Waves of laughter, not angry cries, well up from the darkness of the square. Nasser’s tone starts to change as he outlines the troubles he has had with Eugene Black, the World Bank president (4). He makes a bizarre observation: “Mr Black reminded me of Ferdinand de Lesseps [the Frenchman who designed the Suez Canal].” Nasser pronounces the surname as a hiss.\n\nThe speech reaches a crescendo. Bitter, vicious and furious, Nasser rails against “the imperialists who have mortgaged our future”. At first the crowd reacts tentatively, expecting Nasser to end his anti-US diatribe by announcing pro-Soviet action. So why has he invoked de Lesseps? “We will reclaim the profits that this imperialist company — this state-within-a-state —made while we were starving to death.” People on the official platform and down below are applauding rapturously; they are stunned and bewildered. “I would like to announce that the Official Gazette is at this very moment publishing a statute nationalising the Suez Canal Company. At this very moment government agents are taking possession of the Company’s offices!”\n\nPeople around us and in the vast darkness below react fervently. Journalists once sceptical of Nasser’s regime stand on their chairs and shout. Nasser is suddenly overcome by uncontrollable laughter; his announcement is so shocking, his audacity incredible. He goes on: “The Suez Canal will pay for the Aswan dam project. Four years ago, King Farouk fled this country from this spot. Tonight I am wresting control of the Company on behalf of the Egyptian people. Tonight the Suez Canal will be managed by Egyptians!” Nasser’s words and laughter are drowned by a groundswell of cheering and yelling. He drags himself away from the rostrum; the few foreign observers look on in amazement. Never has a man thrown himself into so risky a mission with such delight.\n\nThirty minutes earlier, Egyptian radio had broadcast that sentence: “Mr Black reminded me of Ferdinand de Lesseps.” Army units responded to the pre-arranged signal and occupied the Suez Canal Company’s headquarters in Cairo and offices in Ismailia, Port Said, Port Tewfik and Suez. The military operation had an almost un-Egyptian precision. Mr Ménessier, the Company’s senior administrative officer, was an “honoured guest” at the Ismailia governor’s office, where he listened to the broadcast of Nasser’s announcement. Ecstatic residents of Alexandria ran along the corniche as trucks with loudspeakers drove around blaring the speech. The British warship Jamaica, moored in Alexandria’s harbour as part of a courtesy visit, dampened the enthusiasm of some residents. “It’s a courageous step, but God help us all,” said a friend.\n\nWe witnessed the frenzy in Cairo two days later when Egypt’s hero returned. What a contrast between the formerly timid technocrat and the man who now stood above the cheering crowd, waving his arms as if shipwrecked in a sea of rapturous people: he was like a boxing champion returning in triumph to his childhood home. We heard the same comments everywhere, from poor cafés to middle-class salons: “Nasser did it! He beat countries that tried to destroy him. Egypt has waited a long time for this! We must show our support!”\n\nSimilar sentiments were expressed by the opposition, including the nationalists of the Wafd party, Muslim Brotherhood sympathisers and landowners who had been victims of Nasser’s agrarian reform. The Communist party and friends were delirious. The only reservations were from people over 50 who followed the British press and were troubled by the intensity of reactions in London. But the people we spoke to asked: “What can you do about it?” Were they anxious? It seemed not."
