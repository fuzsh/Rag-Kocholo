        "text": "Winner of the 2013 Reuven Chaikin Prize, University of Haifa\n\nOne of Choice's Outstanding Academic Titles for 2013\n\nNasser's Gamble draws on declassified documents from six countries and original material in Arabic, German, Hebrew, and Russian to present a new understanding of Egypt's disastrous five-year intervention in Yemen, which Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser later referred to as \"my Vietnam.\" Jesse Ferris argues that Nasser's attempt to export the Egyptian revolution to Yemen played a decisive role in destabilizing Egypt's relations with the Cold War powers, tarnishing its image in the Arab world, ruining its economy, and driving its rulers to instigate the fatal series of missteps that led to war with Israel in 1967.\n\nViewing the Six Day War as an unintended consequence of the Saudi-Egyptian struggle over Yemen, Ferris demonstrates that the most important Cold War conflict in the Middle East was not the clash between Israel and its neighbors. It was the inter-Arab struggle between monarchies and republics over power and legitimacy. Egypt's defeat in the \"Arab Cold War\" set the stage for the rise of Saudi Arabia and political Islam.\n\nBold and provocative, Nasser's Gamble brings to life a critical phase in the modern history of the Middle East. Its compelling analysis of Egypt's fall from power in the 1960s offers new insights into the decline of Arab nationalism, exposing the deep historical roots of the Arab Spring of 2011.\n\nContents\n\nAcknowledgments ix\n\nINTRODUCTION - 1\n\nThe Golden Age of Nasserism 3\n\nIdealism and Pragmatism in Nasser's Foreign Policy 11\n\nThe Nature of Middle Eastern Politics 14\n\nThe Place of the Intervention in Egyptian Memory 16\n\nStructure of the Book 21\n\nCHAPTER ONE - The Road to War 24\n\nThe Coup in Yemen 29\n\nThe Struggle for Power in Egypt 37\n\nThe Accidental Intervention? 49\n\nThe Denouement of the Crisis in Cairo 61\n\nChapter TWO - The Soviet-Egyptian Intervention in Yemen 70\n\nThe Nature of Soviet Relations with Egypt and Yemen 71\n\nThe Egyptian Appeal and the Soviet Response 75\n\nExplaining Soviet Behavior 88\n\nForms of Early Soviet Involvement 94\n\nChapter THREE - Food for \"Peace\": The Breakdown of US-Egyptian Relations, 1962–65 102\n\nRecognition 106\n\nDisengagement 113\n\nThe Suspension of US Aid 127\n\nThe Balance of Payments Crisis 139\n\nChapter FOUR - Guns for Cotton: The Unraveling of Soviet-Egyptian Relations, 1964–66 142\n\nGuns for Cotton 144\n\nThe Soviet Quest for Base Rights in Egypt 146\n\nFrom Jiddah to Moscow 151\n\nIn the Cracks of Cold War Geology 159\n\nThe Final Unraveling 162\n\nChapter FIVE - On the Battlefield in Yemen--and in Egypt 174\n\nCounterinsurgency 176\n\nCasualties 190\n\nCost 195\n\nCorruption 199\n\nThe Spread of Popular Discontent 206\n\nChapter SIX - The Fruitless Quest for Peace: Saudi-Egyptian Negotiations, 1964–66 215\n\nThe First Arab Summit 217\n\nThe Second Arab Summit 222\n\nThe Jiddah Agreement 232\n\nFrom the Islamic Pact to the Long Breath Strategy 249\n\nThe Kuwaiti Mediation and the Return of Sallal 258\n\nChapter SEVEN - The Six-Day War and the End of the Intervention in Yemen 262\n\nThe Sinai Option 266\n\nThe Syrian Connection 272\n\nThe Soviet Spark 275\n\nThe Egyptian Initiative 284\n\nThe Impact of the Yemen War on Egyptian Military Performance in the Six-Day War 289\n\nThe Khartoum Conference and the Withdrawal of the Egyptians from Yemen 290\n\nAFTERWORD - The Twilight of Egyptian Power 295\n\nBibliographical Note 313\n\nBibliography 319\n\nIndex 335\n\nReviews:\n\n\"[R]equired reading for those interested in the history of the Middle East.\"--Laura James, History Today\n\n\"Nasser's Gamble draws on an impressive selection of Russian, US and British diplomatic archives, as well as the Arabic language memoirs of politicians and senior military officials and contemporary press coverage.
