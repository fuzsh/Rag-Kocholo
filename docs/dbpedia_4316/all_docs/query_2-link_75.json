        "text": "Mortlock’s new single 'Traces' explores some new territory into the more energetic and euphoric world of electronic music.\n\nInfluenced by melodic electronica similar to artists like Tycho, Ross From Friends and Machinedrum, Traces takes elements of the breakbeat genre, enhanced by some subtle piano and circular synth melodies to create a blissful, glittering tapestry of sounds.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to explore these more experimental elements of electronic music, and I’m certainly a fan of blending styles together. Traces is really just a tribute to this more chilled-out electronica and breakbeat music I was listening to in the 90s which felt like it made everything just feel warm and fuzzy again. This style seems to have made a major comeback and with really surprising and innovative results. I can’t wait to share more stuff like this!”\n\n'Traces' is out on Mortlock’s own imprint andflows records on the 8th March."
