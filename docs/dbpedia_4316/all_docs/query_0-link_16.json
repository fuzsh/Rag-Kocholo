        "text": "Ever since the introduction of digital recording in the 1980s there has been an ongoing controversy as to the merits of the new medium over the old. And unlike the leap from acoustic to electrical recording which happened about 1929 and the move to stereo recording in the mid 1950s the adoption of digital recording in the 1980s was not universally embraced as a step forward in recording technology by audiophiles.\n\nSo what is the issue? Well itâs really quite simple. Acoustic recording involved a needle connected to a membrane which vibrated analogously (more or less) to the sounds stimulating that membrane. Electrical recording basically extended this technology by having the membrane (in the microphone) translate the sounds into analogous electrical impulses which were then recorded to a disc and later to magnetic tape. This in turn would be used to drive a cutting lathe which cut the vinyl discs. The discs are played with a needle in the groove which reads the little bumps and translates them into electrical impulses which are amplified to drive speaker cones which excite the air and produce sound.\n\nDigital recording involves a sampling technique in which certain sounds or parts of sounds get encoded digitally and then reproduced or re-converted back to electrical impulses which then drive speaker cones. The problem is that this is a sampling involving choices on the part of programmers as to which sounds/parameters will get encoded. So potentially this would not be as accurate a representation of the sound as analog recording which responded directly to the sound as it occurred. Of course more sampling containing more information produces a better recording than one which uses less sampling.\n\nNow to be fair, all recording technologies have their flaws. Even the best analog recordings do not reproduce the experience of hearing the sound live and in person. Characteristics and flaws in the analog equipment can and do limit aspects of the recording. There is a limit to what this equipment can record so there are choices made even in the best case scenario as to what portions of the sound spectrum will get captured. The frequency range and dynamic range are limited for example. But the sonic experience of an analog recording is said by connoisseurs to be a warmer and more genuine sound than digital.\n\nCertainly most people can hear the difference between early digital recordings and more recent ones. That is because the sampling has gotten better, a wider range of frequencies and dynamics are being included. But die hards will insist that analog recording was the finest recording technology for reproducing a satisfying listening experience and for faithfully reproducing the experience of the live sound.\n\nI am not an engineer but as a person with ears I still enjoy the warm sound of analog recording. Of course I listen to digital recordings because it is the dominant technology and I want to hear new recordings. I am not advocating a change here, just pointing out the essential differences.\n\nOK, you ask, this is all about sound but your title said it wasnât all about sound. So what gives?\n\nWell my intention here is to use this simple exposition of recording technology as a metaphor for the digital sampling of opinions which are rampant in todayâs business driven culture. Everywhere we are asked for our opinions. Whether you are approached by an interviewer, filling out a warranty card, or evaluating some experience youâve just had at a concert or theater your opinions are being surveyed and placed into some sort of database which in turn undergoes some kind of analysis and that analysis, in turn, drives future choices made in a given business model.\n\nMost of the audience at the premiÃ¨re of Igor Stravinskyâs Le Sacre du Printemps (The Rite of Spring) were rather famously not pleased with their listening experience on that night in 1913. Yet today there are few people who would deny that this music is one of the most significant compositions of the twentieth century. Modern business practices however would dictate that such music should not be programmed because it displeased the audience who would likely not return if they expected a repeat of such an experience.\n\nThe great musicologist/conductor/composer Nicolas Slonimsky (1894-1995) identified this phenomenon in his marvelous Lexicon of Musical Invective (1953) in which he documents quite a number of critical reviews of music which is now acknowledged as great but which, on first hearing by said critics, was described as inferior. The point is well-taken. Our initial experience of a new piece of music may be very different from our subsequent opinion after hearing it again.\n\nWith the elevation of statistical modeling to a religious practice there is increasing belief that those models embody the essence of truth and clear vision. But what are the motivations behind this modeling? Anyone who has taken a statistics course or who thinks about it for a bit will realize that statistics can obscure outcomes just as efficiently as they can clarify it. So if the motivation is profit (as it should be in a business model) then there would necessarily be less of a focus on quality (whatever that is).\n\nI have had many exciting and joyful experiences of hearing a new piece of music at a concert which I had never heard before. I have experience the exhilaration of discovery. Now not every new piece of music has this effect and, as Iâve said before, I have had that exhilaration of discovery after a second or third hearing.\n\nI used to be very much a fan of classical broadcast radio. At the time, in my adolescence, classical music was an adventure of discovery. Of course I heard a lot of average and even poor music alongside the masterpieces but I also recall that there was an element of risk at times in programming new and less familiar music. Sometimes I was bored, sometimes I was repelled, but sometimes I discovered something new to add to my listening repertoire choices.\n\nThat was in Chicago in the 1970s and 80s with Zenithâs WEFM, WFMT and the late lamented independent WNIB. But radio seems to have changed in similar fashion in terms of its programming to that of the concert hall. Those radio stations frequently broadcast concerts of various orchestras including the Chicago Symphony, Milwaukee Symphony, Boston Symphony and various foreign orchestras. Their programming also contained a fair amount of new music.\n\nOver the last 5-10 years or so I have found classical broadcast radio to be increasingly dull and predictable. Sure itâs good to hear Beethoven Symphonies and Mozart Piano Concertos but some stations have gone to a ârequestâ model for their broadcasting which has resulted in an over representation of Bolero, the 1812 Overture and the broadcasting of what one writer called âwallpaper musicâ. Wallpaper music is a reference to any number of newly recorded repertoire which is so mediocre as to make me almost scream with boredom and ennui.\n\nI am not advocating ditching digital recording or a libertarian approach to concert programming. Certainly both radio stations and concert organizations need to make at least a slim profit to survive. What I am advocating is the inclusion of adventure and discovery in those business models to which I referred earlier.\n\nDemocratizing musical programming and playing to the center or the majority appears to produce mediocrity. Every concert program and every broadcast classical station now are largely the same. Of course there are notable exceptions as some orchestras employ resident composers and play the occasional premiere of a new work. Less common is a second performance of a new work.\n\nThere are adventurous festivals of new music which program interesting music. But these stand outside of the vast majority of classical programming today. So, at the end of the day (or the end of this little essay) listen to what gives you joy, but donât be afraid of new musical ideas. And just be aware of new (and old) sound recording/reproducing technology and its impact on what you hear. It is not just about the music, itâs about the sound.\n\n37.763922 -122.269772\n\nThe 1913 riotous premiere of Stravinskyâs âRite of Springâ is pretty well known in classical music history. Sandwiching the premiere of his masterpiece of modernism between well known conservative chestnuts such as âLes Sylphidesâ (an orchestration by Alexander Glazunov of piano music by Chopin, 1907-9) which opened the concert along with Carl Maria von Weberâs âLes Spectre de la Roseâ (an 1841 Berlioz orchestration of Weberâs 1819 piano piece, âInvitation to the Danceâ) and Alexander Borodinâs âPolovtsian Dancesâ from his opera âPrince Igorâ (1887-1890) which were programmed to follow it. Combine these (familiar to audiences) conservative works with the Riteâs original choreography by Vaclav Nijinsky and the subject of pagan ritual that form the scenario played before an audience consisting of elite concert goers seeking a familiar easy experience along with a burgeoning group of bohemian leaning audience members (who loved the Riteâs loud, subversive nature of both music and staging) and you have a formula for conflict. Speculation is that Stravinsky and/or his producers planned this event to create a contrast for his new modernist work but more likely it was a largely a product of its time and of human nature.\n\nFifty two years later, Hans Werner Henze appears to have had nothing in mind (at least initially) other than the premiere of his new work, âDas FloÃ der Medusaâ (The Raft of the Medusa) on December 9, 1968 in Hamburgâs âPlanten und Blomenâ Hall. The recording which was later released on DGG LPs had been done sans audience on the previous days, December 4-8th, and preparations were being made for that nightâs world premiere performance before an audience.\n\nAn article would later run in the German magazine Der Spiegel describing the event. I present the text of that article in my own translation:\n\nDer Spiegel, December 12, 1968\n\nâWhat is necessaryâ, says Hans Werner Henze, 42, âare not museums, opera houses and world premieres â¦ What is necessary is the creation of mankindâs greatest work of art: the world revolution.â\n\nLast Monday, Henzeâs âDas Floss der Medusa,â an âOratorio volgare e militare, in due partiâ commissioned by the NDR, was to be premiered in Hamburg â instead, there was a revolution in the hall.\n\nThe 1060 seats in Hall B by Planten un Blomen were fully occupied, the NDR Symphony Orchestra was already tuning the instruments, on the podium were ready: Edda Moser (soprano), Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (baritone) and Charles Regnier (speaker) , the North German Radio Choir, the RIAS Chamber Choir and the St. Nikolai Boysâ Choir. The game could begin, and it began â a duo volgare e militare between NDR and SDS.\n\nBecause the Berlin SDS friends under Gaston Salvatore, summoned by Henze, didnât want to do without this premiere of the APO (AuÃerparlamentarische Opposition) man Henze any more than the socialist students of the Hamburg Music Academy â albeit for different reasons: The Hamburgers cared about Henzeâs music as reactionary to expose the Berliners, to bring their Hamburg colleagues to reason and to divert attention to the middle-class audience. Action against Henze, argued the Berlin âProject Group Culture and Revolution,â would only benefit the bourgeois enemy.\n\nAfter three days of palaver, the Hamburg wing was lame. For example, the intention to ask the composer to explain the structures of his music when he played Medusa was abandoned, as was the plan to intervene in the choral singing, and the attempt to expose Henzeâs listeners to Henze as culinary Henze consumers.\n\nOn Monday evening, Berliners and Hamburgers moved in socialist harmony to Planten un Blomen, the premiere location that Henze claims to have confused with Blohm & Voss. At least thatâs how the Berlin SDS had informed the Hamburg SDS.\n\nNDR program director Franz Reinholz, to whom Henze owes the âMedusaâ commission, knows otherwise: âHenze,â Reinholz assures, âinspected the hall himself beforehand. He was also informed about the audience.â shipyard workers, it was, the socialist students recognized once again, an audience of ârich bastards.â\n\nShortly before 8 p.m. the squad was ready for action in Hall B. And before the conductor Henze stepped out of the artistâs room, Che was already in the hall: the agitators had pinned a Che Guevara portrait to the desk; it was intended to remind us of what had been concealed in the program with Henzeâs approval: the oratorio is dedicated to the Latin American freedom fighter.\n\nNDR program director Franz Reinholz didnât appreciate this memento at all â he tore down the poster. He felt that politics and art did not go together.\n\nThe students didnât think so. They put up a new poster and hoisted the red flag, and a team of anarchists, who had come with duck decoys and other hunting instruments, hung a black one next to it. Then the radio hit, the police joined in, the RIAS Chamber Choir began, but not in unison. âLower the red flag,â demanded one singer, two singers left sobbing: âWe are Berliners and have had enough of red flags.â to whose honor they should sing, left the stage and never came back.\n\nThe composer, however, was determined to prove his revolutionary sentiment to his comrades for the first time by saying, âThe red flag,â said Henze, âit stays.â\n\nWhile NDR director Gerhard SchrÃ¶der (SPD), long since in the safe broadcasting van, stopped the live tumult at 8:19 p.m. and radioed his listeners a recording of the dress rehearsal, his deputy, Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord (CDU), countered in the hall the resistance of the demonstrators banners and placards; A little later, a squad of 25 police officers, visors on combat helmets, broke into the hall. âNazis!â âFascists!â shouted the audience. One artist yelled enthusiastically, âDown with the Reds!â\n\nâThe police,â Hammerstein explained, âwere ready at the request of the NDR, which considered demonstrations possible and had to ensure the safety of its employees, the audience and valuable instruments.â\n\nNDR employee Ernst Schnabel, librettist of âMedusaâ, felt the precautions thoroughly. Several police officers threw him through a glass door, expedited him with six other delinquents to police headquarters, took his fingerprints, and locked him in cell 7 until midnight. Schnabel to Hammerstein-Equord: âWe donât have breakfast together anymore.â\n\nMeanwhile, Hammerstein kept order in Planten un Blomen. When Henze informed the audience: âThe intervention of the police prevented the discussion,â Hammerstein snatched the microphone from his hand. The hands in the stalls responded with rhythmic Ho Chi Minh clapping, and Henze clapped along â three times. Then he disappeared through a back door.\n\nAt that time the âraft of the Medusaâ was already well advanced in the ether waves â on the usual counter-revolutionary course.\n\nâWhereverâ, the âSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitungâ judged, âthe choirs sang, there was the old, floating, iridescent Henze sound, which doesnât hurt anyone and never becomes distinctive. The orchestra â¦ strangely often reminded of Richard Strauss.â\n\nThe music critic Heinrich von LÃ¼ttwitz saw âMedusaâ as a âtragi-comic absurdityâ full of âromantic coloursâ, with âsometimes clumsy, sometimes fussy recitatives and melodramasâ.\n\nHenze biographer Klaus Geitel saw the âraftâ in the âocean of an emotional but overly extended, lyrically colored monotonyâ.\n\nIt may be that, as Henze puts it, this evening âbrought him a little furtherâ politically. But the Henze fans in the APO have failed â thatâs how the currently most thoroughly analyzing music theorist Heinz-Klaus Metzger, who identifies with the âanti-authoritarian wing of the SDS,â puts it.\n\nâThe APO, Metzger predicts, âwill only have created meaningful conditions when German musicians no longer refuse to perform under a red or even a black flag, but instead perform a work by Henze. And for strictly musical reasons. Unfortunately, not even Tucholskyâs bon mot applies to this composer: âBecause of bad weather, the German revolution took place in music.â\n\n______________________________________\n\nâââââââââââââââââââ\n\nSo it went in 1968. The Oratorio performance was cancelled and the world premiere had to wait until January 29, 1971 when it was performed in Vienna by the ORF Orchestra conducted by Miltiades Carides. The recording of the first performance was achieved prior to the performance with the audience. That recording was released in 1969.\n\nMany more performances followed but one of those performances, in 2001, was attended by a former chorister, Henning Sidow. He was twelve years old at that 1968 non-concert. And the following article on his experiences of that attempted performance was published in Der Spiegel in 2013.\n\nâââââââââââââââââ\n\n__________________________________\n\nBlaze at the choral-concert. How the âRaft of the Medusaâ went down.\n\nHe was anxiously awaiting the big performance: when he was twelve, Henning Sidow was supposed to perform on stage with the NDR boysâ choir in Hamburg. And indeed, the live performance of the oratorio was exciting â but for completely unexpected reasons.\n\nThe boysâ choir was founded in 1960 as the choir of the North German Radio and has been connected to the main church of St. Nikolai since 1967.\n\nâAs a twelve-year-old in 1968, I had only vague ideas about the political and social turmoil of the time. But on December 9th, as a member of the St. Nikolai boysâ choir, they became tangible experiences for me as a result of the unsuccessful premiere of the oratorio âDas Raft der Medusaâ by composer Hans Werner Henze in Hall B in Hamburgâs Planten un Blomen Park.\n\nI had been in the boysâ choir for four years, which belonged to the NDR until 1967 and was then taken over by the St. Nikolai parish in Hamburg. We âexperiencedâ boys felt quite up to the task of taking part in Henzeâs musically demanding oratorio and also appearing in a world premiere that was to be broadcast live on the radio.\n\nThe play tells the tragic story of the French frigate âMedusaâ, which ran aground as the only ship in a convoy on the way to Senegal in 1816. Since there were not enough lifeboats for the 400 people on board, the crew built a raft that could accommodate around 150 men, women and children and which was to be pulled ashore by the boats. But the officers fled in the boats, leaving the people on the raft to fend for themselves. On the day of the accidental rescue 13 days later, there were only 15 survivors. The others fell victim to starvation, lack of water or cannibalism.â\n\nHide and seek in the empty hall\n\nâOur boysâ choir was supposed to portray the children on the raft â first as living, then as dead. A difficult piece with a socially critical background, this âRaft of the Medusaâ, we knew that. It meant not only intensive rehearsals, but also many afternoons and evenings of rehearsals. What we didnât know was that the premiere was never to take place.\n\nThe location of the event and the preparations fascinated me. The hall seemed huge to me as a child. Large platforms were set up here for the performance, with countless instruments on them. There were people everywhere: stagehands, technicians, orchestra musicians, choristers and soloists â it was just teeming. Now we guys were added.\n\nWe had a lot of waiting time and were able to explore everything. So we crawled under the stage construction, played hide and seek, crawled under the platforms and shimmied over wooden struts until we got too many splinters in our fingers. And right next door there was another hall, several stories high â a gigantic glass box. There was no event taking place at the time, so the hall was yawning and unlit. We strolled through them, hearts in our pants because of the darkness and the eerie acoustics of the room.â\n\nProtest in the concert hall\n\nâThen things got serious, rehearsals began. In my memory, Hans Werner Henze was a small man who was already a bit bald at the time, but incredibly energetic. He radiated a mixture of warmth, ingenious artistry and normality. We boys found him sympathetic, but he had no airs and graces and met everyone completely naturally, friendly and patiently. He treated us as if we were adults, which I found very beneficial. When I was a child, I was used to other well-known personalities whom we had met here and there through our performances to be treated and professionally not taken very seriously.\n\nHenze was excellent at conveying his music to the participants, it was lively, colorful and exciting like the story itself. The dramatic story and the historical background that he and the music told us captivated me even then. Conducting, however, was not his thing, I remember his somewhat awkward gestures. But thatâs not so important in a professional ensemble, as long as the right impulses and cues come. In any case, we children liked and admired him and his music.\n\nOn December 9, 1968, as far as I can remember, the hall was filled to the last seat with an audience. There was talk of more than 1000 guests. Henze was already at the desk. But just before it started, there was a small crowd in front of the stage. A few protesting students stood directly in front of the podium and hung red flags to the left and right of Henzeâs desk. It was not clear whether the master just put up with this or whether it had been agreed with him, as was later speculated. In any case, he didnât seem to put up much resistance to the activities.â\n\nThe situation is escalating\n\nâShortly thereafter, the audience and the choir became restless. Because one of the choirs, the RIAS Chamber Choir, came from Berlin, the enclosed city. Red flags were literally a red rag for many who lived there. At first I â and Iâm sure my fellow boys too â didnât understand much of what was happening down there. But when voices from the Berlin choir grew louder and louder, refusing to sing under âthe red flagâ, I understood what it was all about. The adults feared that they and the music would be exploited by demonstrating communist students. In addition, a large portrait of ChÃ© Guevara has now been erected, to which the work is dedicated.\n\nHenzeâs efforts to get the performance started were nipped in the bud by the boycott of the Berlin singers. The removal of the communist symbols was demanded louder and louder from the podium, before they would refuse to sing a single note. In the meantime it was getting more and more restless in the auditorium and in front of the stage there were small scuffles between the demonstrators and some spectators who got involved. Negotiations between the choir and the composer were taking place behind the scenes as to the conditions under which the performance could still take place.\n\nWe boys watched the whole thing with suspense, since the circumstances had now reversed: the auditorium had become the stage, and we on the podium had a box view of this live cultural scandal. Music was out of the question. In the back of the hall, the doors flew open and police officers in full riot gear marched in. Like a horde of ants, they came down the aisles from several sides to the podium. I donât remember how many there were, maybe a hundred. They looked particularly martial with their helmets with full visors and the shields they â to protect against what actually: a few students, musicians and false notes? â carried in front of them.â\n\nA dark chapter\n\nâHenze had meanwhile disappeared unnoticed and downstairs young people were having their arms twisted behind their backs in order to be taken away. Among them was Ernst Schnabel, who wrote the text of the play. He was later charged with âresisting the authority of the stateâ. On the other hand, part of the audience did not like the actions of the police and protested, which did not prevent the state authorities from their plan to convict the âperpetratorsâ in flagrante delicto.\n\nI canât remember exactly how long the commotion lasted. In any case, it never came to a performance, and at some point we left the stage disappointed. It was incomprehensible to us children why a few red flags and the likeness of a bearded South American led to such an uproar. For us it was about art, about music. We felt cheated of our work.\n\nThe newspapers reported extensively on this event in the following days. Some tabloids insisted on turning it into a real political scandal. To this day it is unclear to me what the state authorities were thinking when they made this appearance. Thatâs for sure\n\nThat she was thin-skinned in those times and liked to overreact on such occasions. The fear that the ideology that prevailed behind the Iron Curtain could also spread to the West was too great.\n\nFor Hans Werner Henze, who died in 2012, this scandal is said to have been a dark chapter in his artistic career. Later, it is said, he did not want to be reminded of it.\n\nMy own memories of that evening only surfaced again years later: at the much delayed premiere in June 2001 in Hamburgâs Laeiszhalle. After 33 years I experienced âThe Raft of the Medusaâ a second time. The fact that I was still able to silently speak and sing along to the lyrics and the music showed how much the piece and the story it was based on had impressed me at the time. None of it was lost. I left the performance deeply touched.â\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nSo, here we are some 46 years after the riotous non-premiere of Henzeâs fine oratorio/requiem, 111 years since the famed âriots at the Riteâ. The Stravinsky has since firmly taken its place in the commonly performed orchestral and ballet repertory. The Henze work, never laying any claim to the seminal and visionary compositional methods that characterize Stravinskyâs landmark work, continues to receive performances and recordings having established itself as a substantial work, and himself as a significant composer with a rich and varied career.\n\nNB: All translations are my own efforts. Historical photos are included under fair use terms.\n\nAfter agonizing about writing a âbest ofâ blog and publishing it before January 1, I decided to take a pause and enjoy the holidays. So here I look back on my 2023 in the rear view mirror but with memories still pretty fresh.\n\nRegular readers of this blog likely already know of my oft shared opinion of the superfluous nature of âbest ofâ lists and of my acquiescence in producing such on an annual basis. I certainly donât think of this as a meaningless exercise and I think the process has grown on me. It is a chance to achieve a perspective which would be missed by simply plowing on ahead with the usual flow of reviews and articles. But drawing down that 12 month perspective is an opportunity to evaluate those months, to see where weâve been and to hopefully get a smidgen of insight into where I/we are likely headed.\n\nMy Facebook friends will recognize the representative meme at the head of this article which is one of the more cloying aspects of âAIâ, whatever that is. So indulge me for a moment to look at this seemingly new intrusion into the reality we thought we knew. So, what is âAIâ and what will it do to us? Ultimately Iâm not the one to answer that question but Iâd like to throw some ideas to add to the speculation.\n\nFirst, the choices a composer makes, like the choices of a painter, a writer, etc. are the stuff of the mystery of creation itself. Why âA majorâ, or why that tuning, or scale, or rhythm, or orchestration, etc? So along comes the notion of removing, or at least distancing, the artist from their creative product. That notion started not with famed proponent John Cage but rather with Johannes Chrysostymous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in his K. 516f musical dice game. Voila! Algorithmic composition (actually fairly common practice in the classical era). An early manifestation of âAIâ? Perhaps.\n\nLejaren Hiller (1924-1994) was the first composer to employ electronic data processing in a musical work in his Fourth String Quartet subtitled âIliac Suiteâ in 1957. There followed similar experiments with various iterations of electronic creations at music centers worldwide including The University of Illinois at Champaign, Columbia-Princeton, Stanford, The University of California Berkeley and San Diego, The San Francisco Tape Music Center (later subsumed into the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music, IRCAM in Paris, Israel Electronic Music Studio, and counterparts in the Nordic countries, Germany, Belgium, etc. Proto âAIâ?\n\nWhile historically interesting I raise this issue to say that, as far as I can tell, âAIâ has not made this writerâs greatest hits list but it is interesting and maybe even useful. With that, my concern for the subject officially goes to the back burner for a later time.\n\n2023 has been a year of great personal changes for the writer of this blog. A job change, a geographical relocation, and many things unrelated to this blog characterized a busy year for New Music Buff. So here in a sort of holiday tradition I present my âBest of 2023â from my little listenerâs corner of the world. For the sake of simplicity I present a more or less chronological exposition of my sonic adventures. (N.B. Not one portion of this article made use of âAIâ).\n\nI begin with not with my 20 most read posts, a practice that characterized previous iterations of this annual exercise. Instead I am providing my top 20 favorite releases that were reviewed in 2023. Please note a couple of caveats. First, I receive a lot of review requests, more than I can even listen to, much less give a reasonably intelligent review. Albums that Iâve not reviewed should not be assumed to be bad or insignificant and my reviews are personal observations. I really only review albums that interest me anyway. Second, this article is only one reviewerâs opinion and not intended to be definitive or to supersede anyone elseâs opinions. Third, this is not the end of my attention to music that was released in 2023. Some releases require more time to give a fair listen and a respectful review. There are more to come in 2024.\n\nFirst a few stats: 2023 saw the publication of some 45 blog posts on New Music Buff, earning me 9693 views for the year. I rarely get comments on my posts (though I welcome and invite comments both positive and negative). Not bad, I think, for the overall less appreciated musical styles that fuel my desire to write about.\n\nNow, in chronological order (of publication) are my personal favorites as a listener:\n\nBinaural Beats in the Tudor Rainforest started my new year with a bang. Reviewing this disc required me to take a closer look at the astounding work of David Tudor and his unique contributions to new music. This important release is a recording of a work which, by its own concept cannot receive a âdefinitiveâ performance. But this recording comes mighty close, involving âbinauralâ recording utilizing a mobile set of binaural microphones which are worn by the recordist. In addition this recording involved a collaboration with Pauline Oliveros and a group called, âComposers Inside Electronicsâ. The recording was done during Oliverosâ tenure at UCSD. Rainforest IV is so called because it is the fourth iteration of the instructions that form the original concepts of Tudorâs composition, âRainforestâ. It is an immersive sonic experience heard on headphones but actually not bad even heard on stereo speakers. A rich and wonderful release.\n\nFrom a 1960s electroacoustic to a budding 21st Century composer Kotoka Suzuki released on the reliably interesting and even visionary Starkland label. Next Gen Electroacoustic: Kotoka Suzuki will introduce the listener to this rising star who doubtless will produce more of her compelling compositions.\n\nIgor Levit is a fine concert pianist whose albums are effectively redefining the way we, as listeners, perceive the western classical oeuvre. Igor Levit: Defining Tristan does for the various musical pieces inspired by the Tristan legend what Levit did for the concept of the great keyboard variations in which he selected Beethovenâs âDiabelli Variationsâ and Frederic Rzewskiâs âEl Pueblo Unido Variationsâ to join his recording of the Bach âGoldberg Variationsâ in a 3 disc package placing these three large sets of variations as emblematic of the genre in three different centuries (18th, 19th, and 20th). Levit, by his recorded output, is providing a valuable perspective which may influence repertory choices for years to come.\n\nLevitâs traversal of the Tristan legend here ranges from the second recording of Hans Werner Henzeâs too seldom heard âTristan Preludesâ back to works by Wagner (of course) and Liszt. He even slips in his wonderful solo piano transcription of the Adagio of Mahlerâs unfinished 10th Symphony into the mix. This is a very compelling Tristan anthology by a deservedly still rising star.\n\nThis Cantaloupe release by Bang on a Can composer and master clarinetist Evan Ziporyn is both masterful and great fun. Evan Ziporyn: Bang on a Pop consists of transcriptions of âpopâ songs for multiple clarinets all played by Ziporyn via his very effective multi-track recordings. The album is very personal and pretty much cliche free with these engaging and insightful transcriptions. It is an homage to the songwriters as well as a showcase for Ziporyn both as composer and as performer.\n\nThe Young Personâs Guide to Ben Johnston is an ideal way to introduce listeners to the wonderful world of the late Ben Johnstonâs music. Johnston, a student and colleague of Harry Partch shows his compositional skills utilizing non-traditional western tunings in these representative works. Johnston here does for some quasi pop tunes what Evan Ziporyn did with his clarinetist perspective for the tunes on Pop Matters. But Johnstonâs pretty, accessible work belies fascinating complexities that donât actually sound complex to the listener. This disc contains Johnstonâs last completed work, âAshokan Farewellâ (which Johnston took to be a public domain folk tune but is in fact a piece written by Jay Ungar). It is paired with the 4th String Quartet (a set of ingenious variations on âAmazing Graceâ) from 1982 and the 9th String Quartet of 1997. Profound, lovely to listen to, and a great homage.\n\nThis DVD is a major addition to the discography of Charles Amirkhanianâs sound poetry as fine sampling of one aspect of Carol Lawâs (Amirkhanianâs life partner) complementary visual art. These collaborations are also important contributions to the visual and performative aspect of these collaborative works. Amirkhanian has been a fine curator and promoter of the work of others but he has rather seldom stepped into the spotlight himself. This quirky genre got some fabulous exposure at the 7 day Other Minds 23 festival in 2018 in which Amirkhanianâs work was presented in the (surprisingly varied) context of sound poetry of the amazing international collection of artists who were hosted at those events. This DVD should be in the collection of anyone interested in new music sound poetry and performance art. It is both entertaining and mind bending featuring a juxtaposition of images and sound reviewed in greater detail in the post âDyadic Dreamsâ. But words cannot do justice to these works. You really have to see them.\n\nReaders of this blog know my fondness for the Chicago based label Cedille and their promotion of Chicago based musicians. This disc stands out in this groupâs embrace of non-traditional composers alongside more traditional works. The inclusion of works by DJ composer Jlin and the academy based genre defying duo Flutronics alongside composers like Danny Elfman and Philip Glass demonstrate the wide ranging repertoire of Third Coast Percussion. Much more information can be found in Perspectives: Spectacular World Premiere Recordings from Third Coast Percussion on my blog. This one reimagines the percussion ensemble.\n\nThis disc is a good example of why listeners and collectors should pay attention to the Neuma record label. Philip Blackburn, who had been the very successful curator of Innova records, took over the defunct Neuma label which was founded with the intention of promoting largely electroacoustic music though not exclusively.\n\nAgnese Toniuttiâs New Music Vision is actually a review of two discs by this rising star, a dedicated new music pianist that needs to be on your radar. The other Neuma disc contains Toniuttiâs traversal of John Cageâs reluctant masterpiece, âSonatas and Interludes for prepared pianoâ.\n\nThe disc pictured here is Toniuttiâs vision beyond the Cage work. This one focuses on mostly living composers Lucia Dlugoszewski, Tan Dun, Philip Corner, and Toniuttiâs herself. Basically, if Toniutti plays it, you should probably at least give a listen.\n\n2023 saw the completion of Bay Area pianist Sarah Cahillâs epic survey of piano music by female composers. Cahill is another (predominantly) new music focused pianist about whom I would also assert that, if she plays it, you should probably give at least one listen.\n\nThe End of the Beginning: Sarah Cahillâs âThe Future is Femaleâ Trilogy Completed will tell you all you need to know about this trilogy which encompasses about 300 years of music history and sheds light on some fascinating and substantial music written by women. Most of the works on this trilogy of albums are, in fact, world premieres but, fear not, even the pieces which are not premieres are likely not in your collection. This is a brilliant selection of music that effectively throws down the gauntlet to challenge other artists to explore this repertory. This trilogy is a true landmark and a joy to the ears.\n\nThis third volume in the wonderful Catalyst Quartetâs survey of another unjustly neglected group of composers focuses on the music of three black Americans of the twentieth century. Catalyzing Blackness, Volume Three: The Catalyst Quartet plays 20th Century music by Black Americans was nominated (but didnât win) for a Grammy Award and, happily, Iâm told that more volumes are in preparation. Again, this music is a pleasant revelation that does for black composers what Sarah Cahill has done for women composers (N.B. The first volume by the Catalyst Quartet focused on the black female composer Florence Price). And hereâs hoping that Coleridge Taylor Perkinson, George Walker and William Grant Still will become household names in the concert hall.\n\nSon of Partch, Carrying on a Tradition is a really wonderful disc which, though I reviewed it in exceedingly positive terms, provoked a strongly negative reaction from the artist. The reaction apparently also provoked enough interest to have made this review one of my most read of 2023.\n\nBut, aside from the unfortunate negative reaction, I still maintain that this is a fine release worthy of attention from anyone who likes new music, microtonality, and the music of Harry Partch. Cris Forster is a composer, theoretician, and instrument builder clearly descended from the Partch tradition. His work deserves attention and this disc is a very satisfying experience.\n\nSteven Schick is a master percussionist and conductor. This release is the first volume of his personal choices of solo percussion repertoire. Solo Percussion Manifesto Volume I: Steven Schickâs âA Hard Rainâ is a manifesto of sorts and does for solo percussion music what Sarah Cahill has done for women composers and the Catalyst Quartet is doing for black composers. There are not many recordings of solo percussion music and Maestro Schick essentially presents his favorite works in definitive performances on a label produced by Bang on a Can cellist Maya Beiser. The second volume is in my review queue and, if this first volume is any indication, it will be a landmark survey.\n\nRising Star Seth Parker Woodsâ âDifficult Graceâ is a Classic in the Making. Hereâs another Grammy nominee that did not win but, this second album by this fine American new music cellist is a winner in my book (er, blog). This is actually the audio of what was developed as a staged performance but the music speaks for itself. Keep an eye/ear out for this rising star who, even now, is storming the new music cello scene in invigorating ways.\n\nA Reason to Listen: Roger Reynoldsâ Latest, âFor a Reasonâ,new recordings on Neuma Records. Here we see Neuma following its original electroacoustic mission with this remarkable set in celebration of Roger Reynoldsâs 90th year. This is a lavish 2 CD box set with a beautiful booklet and lucid liner notes. It is a worthy production which showcases recent works by this prolific and important American composer.\n\nReaders of this blog likely are aware of my interest in music that is suppressed and/or neglected so this disc grabbed my attention immediately. Israel does a great job of funding the arts and this can be seen in the proliferation of truly fine performers nurtured by that funding. Less well known are the composers who have flourished in the art healthy politics of this country. Some 50 years of history are represented here. This is but a sampling, albeit finely curated, of several generations of composers displaying a plurality of styles with substantial results. This entertaining disc will whet the appetites of intelligent and curious listeners and, hopefully, bring about more recognition of the world class composers who deserve an audience.\n\nSo, finally, went my 2023.\n\nUtter the name âIsraelâ and probably only a handful of people will think, âclassical musicâ. As a lifelong new music fan Iâve made many wonderful discoveries by looking at work done by composers in countries that arenât part of the typical America, Germany, Italy, France, Russia nexus. Throw in the Nordic countries, Canada, and Australia more recently and you have perhaps 90% of what is marketed (even if not efficiently distributed) as new classical music. Israel, at 75, remains a young country but its participation with world class classical composers and musicians is among their proudest contributions to the world at large and those contributions are both extensive and interesting.\n\nThis fine release gives only the briefest taste with a curious selection of pieces that will likely lead listeners to the âmore where that came fromâ path to discover a huge trove of music that really needs to be heard. The only problem with this release is that itâs not a 20 or 30 CD box set of representative western classical music from a comparatively new country in a very old artistic/cultural hotbed.\n\nThis fine Neuma release is actually a very nice taste whetting collection of three generations of Israeli composers. I wish I could call it ârepresentativeâ but that would be a tall order. It is an intelligent selection that will hopefully inspire further exploration of Israelâs classical music artistic legacy. Israel is, in many ways, a country of challenges and this release is, similarly, an extension of this countryâs challenges to the canon of western art music in its way and a gentle nudge to curious listeners.\n\nThis project began with a 1986 Israel residency by American composer/musicologist (now Professor Emeritus at NIU) Robert Fleisher. The culmination of this residency resulted in his marvelous book, âTwenty Israeli Composersâ (1997) and all but one track on this disc from an earlier concert at NIU in 1987. which was fortunately recorded rather nicely. You can download the book for free by clicking on the title above. Fleisher wrote the very useful liner notes which are also available as a free download. Those two sources can help guide the avid listener to a wider range of music from Israelâs first 75 years.\n\nGerman refugee Paul Frankenburger (1897-1984), better known as Paul Ben-Haim is doubtless the one name in this collection that listeners may have heard. He emigrated to the (then British Mandate of Palestine) in 1933 just ahead of the onslaught of the Third Reich in Germany. He Hebraicized his name when he became an Israeli citizen at that countryâs inception in 1948. Truly, he was there at the beginning.\n\nHis pupils Tvi Avni, Eliahu Inbal, Henri Lazarof, Ami Maayani, Ben-Zion Orgad, and Shulamit Ran (to name just a few) all went on to make significant impacts on the musical world. Some made their careers in Israel, others established the Israeli artistic diaspora but that is another story.\n\nThe disc opens with one of Ben-Haimâs finest and best known compositions, his 1943 protominimal âToccataâ for piano. This brief piece is a virtuoso showpiece that this listener found immediately appealing having heard it played as an encore after a concerto performance. Here, a wonderful rendition by Liora Ziv-Li makes a strong case for this piece to be heard more often. This first release of this live performance is, happily, not the only recording of the work. Ben-Haim whose style is of a post romantic/nationalistic style somewhat like an Israeli Aaron Copland, creative and nationalist with just a dash of liturgical. His work is fairly well represented on recordings and on YouTube but he is far less known outside his adopted country where his pedagogy also sowed further seeds.\n\nThis second track is one of two (with Tsippi Fleischerâs âThe Gown of Nightâ) that did not appear on the 1987 concert referenced in the intro. Bashrav (2004) by Betty Olivero (the first Israeli born composer represented on this recording) was recorded in Tel Aviv in 2020. The inclusion of this work can stand as a challenge to get listeners to hear one of the finest living composers from Israel. Olivero (1954- ) is very well known in Israel but less so elsewhere despite the fact that some major American orchestras have embraced her work. She is a lyrical and substantive composer whose work is quite appealing. Bashrav is an instrumental chamber orchestra piece based on a Turkish/Iranian musical form from which the workâs title is drawn. It was commissioned and first performed by the San Francisco Contemporary Chamber Players. This is the first commercial recording.\n\nNow we come to another name changer. Tzvi Avni (1927- ) was born Hermann Jakob Steinke in Saarbrucken, Germany. He, like Ben-Haim (with whom he later studied) fled Germany (in 1935) for the safety of the British Mandate of Palestine and took a name reflecting his adopted national alliance. Avni is probably the second best known Israeli composer outside of Israel. His somewhat Stravinskian (to this listenerâs ears) neoclassicism is another voice seriously in need of a wider hearing. His brief Capriccio (1955/1975) for piano has had several recordings and performances and the release of this live recording provides an opportunity to hear the work as well as the opportunity to hear another artistâs interpretation of the work. Avni had the foresight to tap into the emerging world of electronic and computer music and added a stint at the justly famed Columbia Princeton Electronic Music Studio to his musical training. Sadly, though he may have name recognition, his representation in recordings is nothing short of abysmal.\n\nAmi Maayani (1936-2019) is, in this writerâs opinion, the third best known composer of those represented here outside of Israel. He was the founder of several fine Israeli music ensembles including the Israel Youth Orchestra. Like Avni, he chose to supplement his traditional music studies at the fledgling Columbia Princeton Electronic Music Center. He also counts Paul Ben-Haim among his teachers. His musical style derives from Arabic traditional music (one of the few folk musics routinely incorporating the microtonal quarter tone) as well as Ashkenazi and Sephardic folk music. In addition to training in music, he studied architecture and has written several books.\n\nWhile he has written more experimental work, the majority of his available music sounds basically tonal with folk and sometimes electronic elements. Maayani was a prolific composer who, like his âbest knownâ colleagues, suffers from a distribution problem. His architectural work is represented in several portions of Israelâs infrastructure. His three volume study in Hebrew of Richard Wagner challenged Israelâs (understandable) dislike of Wagnerâs music. And now time is nigh for a fair reckoning of Maayaniâs own music. This is not the first recording of his Arabesque No. 2 (1973) scored for flute and harp. His sister Ruth Maayani (1948-1921), herself an accomplished musician plays the harp in this 1987 performance. His orchestral work, âQumranâ (1970) was the first Israeli composition to be performed in Germany after World War II (even that took nearly thirty years to achieve).\n\nNow we come to another refugee from early to mid century European fascism. Abel Ehrlich (1915-2003) was born in east Prussia and took a more circuitous route to Israel, arriving in the Palestine Mandate in 1939. Unlike some of his predecessors he made no changes to his name. He did study at the Eretz-Israel Conservatory in Jerusalem and went on to write music and teach at Israel Conservatory, the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem; the Rubin Academy of Music, Tel Aviv; Bar-Ilan University and Oranim Academic College. He was of an age that didnât create a web page but even Wikipedia has very little to say about him except that he was recognized during his lifetime with various prizes and I was able to find this laudatory 2004 concert review in Haâaretz which reports a count of some 3500 compositions (sic)! It also makes mention of one of his best known compositions, his 1953 âBashravâ for solo violin. This is a piece based on the Arabic musical form for which it is named. Astute listeners/readers will recognize the name from the earlier Betty Olivero work with which it shares both its name and structure. Would that a performance could have been included here but listeners can easily find several recordings of that other Bashrav on YouTube.\n\nAbel is represented on this recording by two works, both from 1986 and both world premiere recordings from the 1987 concert that forms the core of this album. Track five documents a piano work called, âThe Death of Dan Pagisâ. It is a sort of lament for Pagis (1930-1986) some of whose poetry Abel set musically but was sadly never heard by the poet. Track eight gives us a hearing of Ehrlichâs âThe Dream About Strange Terrorsâ for two flutes. Both are brief but effective works and, like much of the music here (and a lot of art) seem to be a form of sublimation, a Freudian derived term which refers to an adaptive psychological mechanism, a transformation of pain, anxiety, anger, etc. into something positive. The otherwise informative liner notes say little about these two works but given the composerâs history, both works would seem to fall into that category. Both are in a sort of mid century post romantic style that challenge the performers but speak pretty directly, in a musical sense, to the listener.\n\nTrack six introduces us to another native born Israeli composer, Tsippi Fleischer (1948- ). This one is a graphic score which is realized electronically. âThe Gown of Nightâ (1988) is a setting of a poem. It is performed in the original Arabic. The English translation is below.\n\nTHE GOWN OF NIGHT\n\nMuhammad Ghanaâim\n\nThe gown of night\n\nEnvelops the desert\n\nEngulfing tent and well\n\nFrom the boundaries of night\n\nThe howling of jackals descends\n\nTo raise the dawn\n\nEngulfing tent and well\n\nThen came the dawn â¦\n\nA portion of the graphic score is reproduced in both physical and digital formats of the album. It is one of the pieces that has actually been released before but those releases on small limited distribution independent labels has likely remained obscure to all but the most tenacious listeners and collectors. It is a fine example of purely electronic music and was composed using recordings of Bedouin children reciting the poem.\n\nI was astounded and oh so pleased to learn that all of Fleischerâs recorded output (including liner notes) is available for free downloads via her website the link for which can be accessed by clicking on the composerâs name in this review. Well, brava Maestra Fleischer for striking a blow against obscurity.\n\nArie Shapira (1915-2013) is another substantial and prolific composer with no personal website, no government generated website, no publisher generated website, and a way too brief Wikipedia page. In fact Professor Fleisherâs book remains the âgo toâ resource for this manâs work. A quick look on the discogs site, not surprisingly, list only two CD releases.\n\nHe is represented in this collection by âOff Pianoâ (1984) written for the Michal Tal who performs it here. The 1984 premiere was broadcast by Israeli media. This all too brief work immediately suggested the pianistic fireworks of Frederic Rzewski.\n\nTracks nine, ten, and eleven comprise the second largest offering by time of all the composers on this album. The âThree Romancesâ (1986) for piano by Ari Ben-Shabetai (1954- )The works, premiered in 1986 and were written for Liora Ziv-Li whose 1987 performance are on the present disc. Ostensibly an homage to Robert Schumannâs similarly titled work are a modernist and highly virtuosic set of pieces.\n\nLastly we have by far the longest offering of music of all the represented composers with Oded Zehaviâs âWireâ (1986) for chamber orchestra and soprano (Zehavi plays the piano part in the ensemble). Born in 1961, he is by far the youngest composer this collection. Wire is a setting of a poem in Hebrew by Chaya Shenhav, English text given below.\n\nChaya Shenhav, âStrange Brightness,â\n\n(âThread: Poemsâ), Hakibbutz Hameuchad\n\nPublishers Ltd, 1984, p. 22; Translated by\n\nOded Zehavi. Â©All rights reserved.\n\nIn those awful shadowless\n\nminutes before sunset\n\nwhen greenish lights rise\n\nfrom the valley\n\nWhen the trees on the slopes\n\nglow with a sudden great light\n\nbut beingless, perhaps,\n\nAnd the children slowly climb the path,\n\ntheir faces shining with a strange brightness . . .\n\nCall out to them quickly, âspeak,â âshout,â\n\nlike the partridges screaming in the valley\n\nscream,\n\nYou see, you know, donât you?\n\nthat they are moving away\n\nThis release is a testament to Professor Fleisherâs musicological efforts that help raise awareness that Israel has some truly world class composers of new classical music. It is also a fine place for listeners to begin their explorations of this repertoire.\n\nRoger Reynolds (1934- ) turns 90 next year. This prolific American artistâs work is being collected and preserved by the Library of Congress. The present recording is the most recent release documenting Reynoldsâ music, now numbering about 30 CDs and DVDs. And this is but a fraction of his musical works.\n\nI first encountered Reynoldsâ music when I heard a broadcast of the first commercial recording of his music. The disc, released in 1969 on Nonesuch records documented performances of Frederic Myrowâs âSongs from the Japaneseâ (1964) paired with Reynoldsâ âQuick are the Mouths of the Earthâ (1965), a work that actually uses the text of the title to derive the music. I recall that the sound of this music sent chills up my spine and sent me to a record store to purchase a copy. This first encounter was a visceral experience, one of many I would encounter as I heard his subsequent music, and that of his contemporaries.\n\nReynolds has been a prolific composer, writer, and reader. His father was an architect, Roger would go on initially to study engineering and then also encountered some of the new interest in experimental music at the ONCE Festival in Ann Arbor, Michigan in the early 60s. His studies in music and literature continued to be wide ranging and the fine liner notes by Thomas May in âFor a Reasonâ are extremely useful in grasping the range of inspirations that inform Reynoldsâ music. This is one of those gorgeous new music releases that will likely become one of those odd but much sought after collectibles. The booklet jdesign by Karen Reynolds, Stacie Birky Greene, and producer Philip Blackburn is by itself, worth the price of this release.\n\nWhile listeners can certainly appreciate Reynoldsâ work without those details, they add a dimension of understanding and provide contexts as well. In some ways, Reynolds is unclassifiable but this writer finds him to be the consummate experimentalist and modernist, two aspects that appear to have been in his work from the very beginning. His work is rarely easy listening but, even if you donât get it on first hearing, his compositions tend to reveal weight and substance with repeated listenings.\n\nThat said, Reynoldsâ music produces sounds that might be heard as romantic, expressionist, and even classical at times. Much of his work, as is the case with most of this 2 CD set, is electroacoustic. It is not heavily dissonant or overly complex to the listenerâs ear but his music presents unique challenges to performers. And, as mentioned, this beautifully designed set includes a decent set of liner notes to help navigate this voyage.\n\nThree of the four works here are âelectroacousticâ, meaning that some form of electronics interacts with the performer. The one work that does not fit that category pretty much needs itâs own category. Pieces for speaking pianist are getting more common in the last 20 years or so but pieces for speaking percussionist are far less common. Frederic Rzewskiâs âTo the Earthâ for speaking percussionist playing on clay flower pots comes to mind. Of course John Cage also wrote in this genre but Reynoldsâ essay is the longest, most complex work this listener has encountered for solo percussionist with speaking duties.\n\nThe first track is âDream Mirrorâ (2010), the first of Reynoldsâ âSharespaceâ series of compositions in which an instrumental performer interacts in the shared performance space with a computer musician in a duet. This first sharespace work is for guitar and computer musician. It features the fine Mexican guitarist, Pablo Gomez Cano. The fact that Cano is not a familiar name is likely that his work has focused on challenging new music such as this. Dream Mirror is a big work, at over 20 minutes in performance, but it has a chamber music quality consistent with the composerâs focus on the interaction of this duet in their shared performance space.\n\nThe second track introduces listeners to the fourth in the Sharespace series, this time, for violin. âShifting/Driftingâ (2015) was written for Irvine Arditti, one of the finest working musicians of our time supporting new music via his solo efforts and his work with his esteemed âArditti Quartetâ. Like the preceding track, this big duet takes some 20+ minutes in performance.\n\nOn to CD 2 for the third offering, âHere and Thereâ (2018), both the longest work and the most recent. This one is for solo percussionist with a substantial speaking part designed to be spoken by the percussionist (in this case, Steven Schick, one of Reynoldsâ fellow faculty at UCSD). Solo percussion works are relatively uncommon, though readers will want to familiarize themselves with volume one of Mr. Schickâs ongoing series of the solo percussion repertoire Hard Rain.\n\nThis will likely become a showpiece but, at the time of this writing only Schick and the ubiquitous William Winant come to mind as being both willing and able to perform this work right now. And it is apparently a beast of a challenge for the performer but remarkably engaging for the listener. The texts, from Samuel Beckett, are referenced in the liner notes. Not surprisingly, Schick delivers a stunning performance, setting a bar for successive performers and performances. The texts are non-narrative and have a more musical than didactic or dramatic function.\n\nLast but not least is the earliest work on the album, âSketchbookâ(1985), originally written for Joan LaBarbara but never performed. Here, singer, Liz Pearse effectively took a page from Irvine Arditti (whose doctoral studies resulted in research that culminated in John Cage being able to finish his partially completed solo violin work, âFreeman Etudesâ). Pearse, also pursuing doctoral studies came upon this work and collaborated with Reynolds in creating a performance. His texts here come from Milan Kundera. The work, while dramatic and challenging, is not a species of opera or monodrama but, like the preceding works, a piece that, like Reynolds, thrives on collaboration. In addition to requiring some pianistic skills, the singer collaborates with interactive computer electronics.\n\nThese four works, despite their differences, clearly fit Reynoldsâ interest in literature, collaboration, and in various technical aspects described in the well documented liner notes. Those notes provide technical detail and insights beyond the scope of your humble reviewerâs skills but what I can tell you is that this release is a marvelously engaging experience revealing fascinating aspects of this composerâs work.\n\nThe experience of listening and reading and the visual experience of the graphics was an immersive one and a delightful use of my time. Heads up to all my fellow new music aficionados. This is truly spectacular.\n\nEvery solo artist, regardless of what instrument they play seeks to define themselves. Generally that means setting limits. Some set limits by specializing in an era (baroque, classical, etc.). Some specialize in working with electronics, some with jazz, some with experimental music, some with standard recital repertoire, etc. Seth Parker Woods (1984- ) seems almost unaware of such limits. He plays what he chooses. And, oh, what choices. From standard classics to the leading edge of musical creativity woods is poised at the beginning of a very promising career.\n\nThis album is in fact the musical portions of what was produced as a staged presentation with Woods playing, singing, talking. No doubt something is lost without the staging but Woodsâ asserts himself with great clarity on the sonic aspect alone. Think of this as a sort of cast album, though it is more than just a souvenir. It is Woodsâ second album and it has this writer enthralled at where he may go next. You will be too.\n\nI feel privileged to have known this artist via digital media and to have watched with increasing interest his development as a true rising star in the new music world. I only recently acquired his first album via bandcamp. It was released âacross the pondâ when he was completing his Ph.D. at the University of Huddersfield.\n\nBorn in Houston, his father, a jazz and gospel singer, Woods was exposed to a great deal of music. He rehearsed in a home studio and somehow came to a fascination and deep appreciation for a wide variety of repertory.\n\nHis affiliations continue to be wide ranging from Peter Gabriel to George Lewis. He has appeared on many recordings but this is only the second disc dedicated entirely to Woods as performer and the first such solo efforts on a US label. Woods is apparently able and willing to tackle music of all eras and genres including the wildly experimental, like his âIce Celloâ homage to Charlotte Moorman and the theatrical, which brings to the the album at hand.\n\nFour of the seven works presented are world premieres. And, despite this being a sort of âcast albumâ which lacks the visuals, this is a major release that presents a characteristic variety of musical choices and is a fine calling card for the artist. This is one classy production.\n\nHe begins with the title track, âDifficult Graceâ by Chicago based composer Frederic Gifford (1972- ). It is a setting of poetry by Dudley Randall subjected to some Cageian mesostic like manipulation. This first track tells us we are dealing with modern music and sort of sets the tone of this project. This is a complex work in concept (lucidly described in the composerâs notes) and involves projections of the texts onto the performer as well as electronics which, by careful use of both the sounds and the spoken text (spoken by the cellist) which then contributes to the musical structure. Photographs in the booklet show some of the striking visual design for this project.\n\nWoods follows with what is to this listener a stunningly beautiful piece, âCalvary Ostinatoâ (1973) by the late, sadly neglected Coleridge Taylor Perkinson (1932-2004), a black American composer (actually represented admirably in a fine earlier Cedille release CDR 90000 087). The Ostinato is one movement from Perkinsonâs âLamentations: Black/Folk Song Suite For Solo Celloâ (1973). Woodsâ performance is available on YouTube. Itâs truly enthralling. One gets the feeling that Woods really gets inside the music he performs and that deep feel for the music is delightfully obvious in this track, the second oldest work on the disc and one that is for the solo cello sans electronics or vocals but using a dazzling variety of extended instrumental techniques, none involving a bow.\n\nThen we hear Monty Adkinsâ (y. 1972- ) âWinter Tendrilsâ (2019) written for cellist who, in addition to playing his instrument, is asked to use his voice and work with electronics, albeit in a different manner than the title track. Adkins worked closely with Woods on the creation of this work. The work essentially an impressionistic piece with clever use of counterpoint to depict fresh fallen snow on the branches of a tree.\n\nNathalie Joachim (1983- ), a Haitian-American vocalist, flautist, and composer, is represented by two works. The first, âThe Race 1915â (2019), a work that contributes to the Chicago centered Cedille label by its use of historical quotations from The Defender, a major and influential black newspaper in Chicago. Woods is again asked to use his vocal skills in this work which celebrates efforts to undo social inequalities.\n\nThe multitalented Joachim lends her vocal skills to Woodsâ performance in Joachimâs second piece on the album, âDam Men Yoâ (2017). The title is Haitian Creole for âthey are my ladiesâ. It is a sort of black feminist peaen celebrating the strength of the women with whom the composer was raised in her native Haiti. (NB: Haiti is the site of the only successful slave revolt in history, a fact that continues to be reflected in their turbulent politics).\n\nIn between those two pieces we get to hear perhaps the best known composer in this mix, Alvin Singleton (1940- ). Singleton is represented by âArgoru IIâ (1970) for solo cello (the Argoru series is a set of pieces for solo instruments akin to Luciano Berioâs âSequenzaâ series). The title is from the Twi language (spoken in Ghana) and translates as âto playâ. It is a virtuosic piece employing extended instrumental techniques which Woods accomplishes with almost supernatural ease. He does honor to this living elder statesman of American music.\n\nAnd here we are back in Chicago now with Maestro Woodsâ performance of a work by Chicago born composer Ted Hearne (1982- ), a name which did make it to this writerâs musical radar but one whose work I have just begun to explore. But this is a fine example of one of the reasons for my admiration for Woodsâ scope of musical interest. I think he is one of those artists to whom I will turn to look for good new music. His instincts for repertory choices are amazing.\n\nThis is perhaps the most unusual entry on this disc as well as one that, if any controversy is forthcoming, it will likely originate with this set of songs to poetry by Keri Alabi. A casual listen to some of Hearneâs music on YouTube suggests a sort of post minimalist ethic but this last work is not discernibly minimal. Like the music that preceded it, this cycle is overtly about politics and equality.\n\nHearneâs little 6 movement song cycle is a combination of poetry, electronics, cello (of course), and the voice of said cellist. Hearneâs expletive title, âfree fuckedâ, is apparently very much in line with the composerâs assertive and playfully humorous style.\n\nWe return in these tracks to the avant garde and complex with which the album opened. Again we have a multitasking role for the cellist demanding his vocal participation and working in a distinctly electroacoustic genre. Hearne lends his voice to the final track of this unusual work.\n\nWhile political themes and references abound in this release it is as much about black politics and civil rights as well as feminist, gender, and global equality issues. But ultimately this recording is a landmark in the career of this fine young musician who works fearlessly with a variety of composers, poets, designers, political activists, progressive ideas, and new music in general.\n\nCedille is one of my top favorite new music record labels and has been since they first started in 1987. Their releases (not limited to new music) are consistently well recorded and produced but producer James Ginsburg really pulls out all the stops on this one. From concept to recording, from lucid liner notes to gorgeous package design this has all the marks of a classic and collectible release. I mean, the music is great, but the whole package is something youâll want to own. Thatâs right, Iâm calling for âcollectorâs itemâ status here. Now is the time to get your copy.\n\nThis release completes Sarah Cahillâs monumental survey of piano music written by women which saw its first two CD volumes last year.last year. This, the third volume titled âAt Playâ, follows the first two as seen below. This trilogy is not, of course, the last word, the end on the subject of piano works by women. There can be no last word but these selections are a reflection of Cahillâs perspective as a performer but also a producer/programmer whose scholarship and advocacy are well known and respected worldwide. These releases speak to women, certainly. But they also speak to audiences in general, producers, and fellow musicians. They comprise a careful sampling of some three hundred years of music which effectively demonstrates that âthereâs gold in them thar hillsâ (after all Cahill is a Californian). Hereâs hoping that this survey will help start a metaphorical gold rush to unearth the gold that can be found in this neglected music.\n\nI recall my fascination with Cahillâs earlier commissioning project which resulted in her CD âA Sweeter Musicâ (2013). I recall attending a very preliminary recital at Mills College where she did brief run through of some of the compositions and spoke about the project. She later toured the music (sometimes with John Sanbornâs wonderful accompanying visuals, sometimes without). Little did Cahill know that she hit upon a genre of classical music dear to this listenerâs heart, that of politically inflected classical music. As a result, my interest in her artistry and choices of repertoire escalated tremendously (I heard two of her Bay Area recitals of this music and reviewed the recording in the early incarnation of this very blog). So another project, this time supporting female composers, with even greater dimension than that earlier project has similarly grabbed my attention in this landmark collection of music by women composers which has largely been neglected by mainstream artists, producers, and programmers.\n\nThis trilogy of recordings hardly solves the egregious neglect of this music but it does contribute rather authoritatively to the canon (there is one now) of music by non-male composers. Cahill is not the first artist to do this, and there are multiple ongoing projects exploring the work of female composers, but this project deserves top billing as it casts a mighty wide net with its three volumes covering about 300 years (of neglect). These recordings of some 30 pieces are but a fraction of music by women composers in this pianistâs repertoire. But, more than simply righting wrongs, this is about celebrating a legacy of artists getting their due recognition. (The âbad ideaâ Biblical metaphor of hiding a lamp beneath a basket comes to mind). Just look, er, listen at/to whatâs been under that basket!\n\nThis now completed trilogy doubtless will not mark the end of Cahillâs advocacy but it will stand as a major manifesto of sorts and will hopefully bring more performers and producers to be open to performing and recording them. Simply hearing these recordings exposes the listener to music of stunning substance selected by an artist whose curatorial radar is finely tuned and whose choices will speak definitively to listeners (and likely fellow performing artists) for years to come. (N.B. Listeners would do well to check out Cahillâs YouTube channel where one can find a gold mine of music which reflects the scope of her performances and advocacy, not just for women composers, but for an amazing range of artists.)\n\nThis third volume is entitled, âAt Playâ. Like the previously released volumes, this collection gets a collective title that vaguely hints at the character of the music herein. The sequencing of the music is, like the previous two volumes, pretty much chronological. The essential program notes by Ms. Cahill (in all three volumes) provide just enough background to provide useful contexts for the listener. And you have to love the âCahill and friendsâ photo galleries (on each volume) reflecting the deeply personal nature of this undertaking. That may sound hyperbolic but just listen to this music and feel the love, the passion, the connections, the sincerity, and the incisive playing. (Should I throw in a âPied Piperâ metaphor?) Listen and youâll likely get hooked.\n\nThere are 16 tracks comprising nine works by nine female composers over nearly three centuries. Four of the nine works receive here receive their first (or first commercial) recordings. As noted earlier, the track sequence is chronological. (N.B. That makes 30 + works over the 3 CDs), a little less than half of the total commissions.\n\nWe begin with the last of 9 sonatas by HÃ©lÃ¨ne de Montgeroult (1764-1836). Her lifespan covers the classical to the early romantic eras in western musical history but recordings of her music didnât begin to appear until about 2006 when JÃ©rÃ´me Dorival published a biography of her. Listeners will likely find this music similar to that of Mozart, Haydn, and early Beethoven but with a level of virtuosic writing that anticipates Chopin and Liszt. This three movement sonata was published in 1811. This is apparently the second recording of this work as another new music champion, Nicolas Horvath, released a recording of all nine of these in 2021, further testament that time has come for this composer (and perhaps women composers in general).\n\nNext is the ThÃ¨me variÃ©, Op. 98 (1895) by CÃ©cile CHAMINADE (1857â1944). This late romantic composer is probably the only name with which most listeners may be acquainted. A recording of her Concertino for flute and orchestra (1902) continues to receive attention by classical broadcasters but most of her work remains very little known. Cahill makes a strong case for this music with her interpretation of this virtuosic early romantic styled work. She is far better known in her native France. It is time we see what the French have been hiding.\n\nGraÅ¼yna BACEWICZ (1909â1969), represented here by her Scherzo (1934), has gotten recognition in her native Poland but has only fairly recently become known internationally. This early work, less modernist than her later work, has apparently been recorded before but is new to this reviewerâs ears. Bacewicz was a prolific composer and this fine piece, a virtuosic showpiece, is likely to encourage listeners to further explore her extensive catalog which includes Symphonies, Concertos for violin, viola, cello, and for piano, 7 string quartets, symphonies, operas, songs, and much more.\n\nNow Cahill brings us into present time, featuring living composers, beginning with the music of Chinese-American composer Chen YI (b. 1953). Guessing (1989) is a small piano piece which incorporates a Chinese folk song in a set of variations.\n\nThis is the first commercial recording of this music. To be honest, I am not familiar with much of this composerâs work (nor most of them here) save for Oliveros and Wong) but this piece as with all the selections here are sufficiently intriguing to prompt listeners to explore further. That is the point of an anthology such as this, to spark curiosity, suggest another path for the journey. Mission accomplished.\n\nFranghiz ALI-ZADEH (b. 1947), born in Azerbaijan, incorporates elements from her ethnic heritage into modern classical idioms. Music for Piano (1989/1997) utilizes Cagean-like preparations, in this case a glass beaded necklace laid across the strings. The resulting sound, evoking Alan Hovhaness and/or Henry Cowell at times, is intended to evoke that of the traditional Azerbaijani string instrument called âtarâ (not a reference to the recent film). The composers use of different scales also seems to derive from folk models. The piece is in several sections delineated by dynamics and by register in which is, I believe, an ingenious use of register used to control when to allow for those prepared strings to sound. The piece is by a composer with a wide expressive pallete and the ability to use those methods judiciously toward her unique creative ends.\n\nNext, in the briefest entry at just over 4 minutes, we get one piece from a set of commissions (all by women composers) Cahill made to honor the 100th birthday of American composer Ruth Crawford (1901-1953). Pauline OLIVEROS (1932â2016) submitted this work (her first notated composition since the 60s) which uses her own unique approach to indeterminate composition in Quintuplets Play Pen: Homage to Ruth Crawford (2001), here in its world premiere recording. Oliveros, who exerted a profound influence on a generation of composers, performers, and listeners via her work in electronic music and improvisation, but most powerfully via her âDeep Listeningâ concepts which effectively define the role of the listener as being a part of the compositional process.\n\nHannah KENDALL (b. 1984) is a black British composer whose three movement âOn the Chequerâd Field Arrayâdâ (2013) is based on the 1763 poem Caissa by Sir William Jones and depicts the three sections\n\nof a game of chess. The lengthy Elizabethan styled poem can easily be read as protofeminist given that the female chess piece heroically wins. Read it if you donât believe me. And there are musical metaphors as well. It is these: mindplay, middlegame, and coda into which the work is divided. The music, like the poem is an intimate perspective which invites the reader (or hearer of the music) to create their own meanings here.\n\nAida SHIRAZI (b. 1987), an Iranian born composer, takes the performer inside the piano. Her blandly titled, âAlbumblattâ (2017) belies her deep understanding of the piano and its possibilities. This is arguably the most avant garde (or modernist if you prefer) composition of the trilogy. Cahillâs choices reflect her eclectic approach to music programming.\n\nIn addition to a chronological approach, this trilogy is stylistically diverse. This music borrows from forbears such as John Cage and Morton Feldman as well as Henry Cowell. This meditative music only reveals itself fully to the focused listener. This is like an etude comprised of sounds you rarely hear (intentionally) from a piano. Played much of the time inside the piano but also at the keyboard more conventionally, the piece also demands close attention to dynamics (down to silence). Here is where the recordistâs art shines through. The subtleties of dynamics and the ability to capture the variety of harmonics evoked. Of course said performer had to accomplish rather large postural changes and do so silently if the performance adheres to the score, lol. And both are accomplished here in what sounds like a single take. This is a pretty great listen.\n\nRegina HARRIS BAIOCCHI (b. 1956), a native Chicagoan poet and composer is given the last word with her, âPiano Poemsâ (2020). Last but not least by any means is a testament to Cahillâs singular but relevant choices as well as her advocacy of young composers as their stars begin to rise. This artist is new on my radar but one that will remain there. As both poet and composer, this young artist, commissioned by Cahill with a request that the music be about poetry, specifically by fellow (adopted) Chicagoans Gwendoline Brooks (one of this formerly Chicagoan reviewerâs personal faves) and Richard Wright.\n\nThe response was these 4 meditations on Brooks, Wright, and on the composerâs own poetical musings. The language here seemingly derives, appropriately, from 30s to 40s jazz of Ellington and Basie and a seemingly latter day version of that in the last two pieces describing the composerâs own literary utterances. Both virtuosic and apparently written by a composer very familiar with the instrument, a fitting and hopeful glimpse to the future.\n\nEach of these discs contains at least one piece that reflects a deeper than average commitment by the performer. Cahillâs collaborative wok (with Dr. John DesMarteau) in the Agi Jambor sonata in volume I, her advocacy of Teresa Wong premiering the first performance of (She dances Nakedâ¦),the justly celebrated bay area artistâs selection on volume II. And her reaching out to Regina HARRIS BAIOCCHI for a commission (in volume III) all reflect another valued aspect of this performer.\n\nThe recording by Matt Carr is very listener friendly demonstrating serious skills at times in dealing with the many sonic challenges. This album and its two predecessors belong in any serious collectorâs library. If the future is indeed female, then this is a fine soundtrack. Listeners, performers, Brava!!\n\nLet me start with a positive image from a brief photography trip which I managed this year. It was one of the highlights of what has been a difficult year for many of us. Weather, politics, COVID, itinerant employment issues, financial, and personal difficulties were an encumbrance but now stand in relief to the many positive aspects of 2022.\n\nFirst, let me say that nothing musical fell into the category of âworst ofâ so fear not, what follows is essentially my âbest ofâ from 2022. In my head I blame the aforementioned encumbrances for delays and sheer lack of production on my part. Whether that is the ultimate truth does not matter really so here, for better or worse, is my celebration of the positive experiences enumerated in this music blog in 2022.\n\nMy first post for the year struck a sad note. It was my personal tribute to a composer, A Belated Fan Letter: Homage to George Crumb described George Crumb, who had been one of my âgateway drugsâ, so to speak, which helped put me on the exciting roads of new music upon with I continue to travel with great joy. Recordings of his complete works are still being released on the visionary Bridge Records.\n\nCarolyn Shawâs striking and much performed âIn Manus Tuasâ (on solo viola as well as solo cello) was originally written for Collins. Her selections on this album, including that Shaw work, suggest to this writer/listener that she has both vision and an encyclopedic knowledge of music, especially that written for her instrument. She will be among the major shapers of this repertoire via her vision as well as her interpretive talents. And Sono Luminusâ superb sonics certainly helps make this a great release.\n\nI have followed the work of Sarah Cahill since her first solo CD (music of Ravel). Like Collins, she has been an artist who, by her intelligent selection of repertoire, serves as a guide to listeners (and musicians) as well. She has championed many composers as a pianist and as a broadcaster on her weekly KALW broadcasts. Her curation of concerts throughout the Bay Area, such as her solstice concerts at Oaklandâs Chapel of the Chimes, have showcased a large variety of creative performers.\n\nAs she focuses her lens on women composers (neglected is implied) she embraces a stunning range of styles from the baroque era to the present and it seems as though she can play anything she chooses well. She is also collaborative with an amazing ability to discern the substance in the works she chooses to play. And she has discovered (or rescued?) much music from obscurity via scholarship and intelligent collaboration. Canât wait for the next release. She is consistently interesting and relevant.\n\nThis album was sent to me by a friend. I knew the Ligeti pieces but heard them with new ears in this release and I was amazed by the Kodaly works too. Marcus Creed may not be as well known in the U.S. as he is across the pond but he should be.\n\nThis album was kindly sent to me for review by John Schneider of Microfest records. Read the review. Listen to this album. And watch for more from Chris Votek, another rising star in 2022.\n\nDan Lippel is one of the founders of the fabulous new music label, New Focus Recordings. Here he is acoustic, electric, conventional, and experimental but always interesting. Keep his name on your radar.\n\nThis is a gorgeously designed, very collectible art object. It is a beautiful hard cover, full color book which also contains a CD of a recording (from acetate masters) which had languished in the archives of the Eastman/Rochester Music School where Harry Partch gave this lucid lecture/performance in 1942. Mr. Schneider, who sent me the Votek release as well, fronts an ensemble called PARTCH which, in addition to performing Harry Partch âs work, is recording Partchâs complete works for David and Becky Starobinâs Bridge label. This one is both eye and ear candy to my ears.\n\nRescuing those acetate masters from obscurity is a major find that rises in significance (in the musical sense) almost to the level of the archeological discovery of Tutâs Tomb. Schneider is a musician, a composer, a radio broadcaster, and an archivist and now a sonic archeologist I suppose. He also sports a collection of authentic copies of Partchâs curious instruments which were built to play the microtonal scales required. Partch is a major American composer whose work is now gaining its rightful place among the best of American classical music.\n\nI first discovered Mr. Susmanâs work when I was asked to review a performance of another composerâs work. I heard one of his works played by the remarkable San Jose Chamber Orchestra on that same concert. Here we have another multi volume release of these lovely and significant piano works. The remarkable pianist (mentioned often in these pages) has contracted to record all 4 books of this sort of âWell Tempered Clavierâ type gesture which effectively provides much insight to this composer. Nicolas Horvath, known for marathon concerts performing (and subsequently recording) all of Philip Glassâ piano music, among others. (Weâre talking 15 hours or so. There is also a 35 hour live rendition of Erik Satieâs âVexationsâ on you tube.) Who better to record these? The remaining three volumes are due some time this year. Who better to take on this post minimalist set of pieces? Canât wait for the next volume.\n\nYolanda Kondonassis is about as household a name that you can find among harpists. These five minute (more or less) pieces are a significant addition to the solo harp repertoire. They are forward looking works for her instrument. Very interesting work, excellently performed.\n\nI remain in awe at the curatorial and historically aware work of this truly fine pianist. Greenberg helped me grasp the historical context of the Second Viennese School in a new way with his earlier release âBook of the Hanging Gardensâ. In that release he played all the Debussy Preludes along with Schoenbergâs pre twelve tone song cycle, Webernâs Variations, and the Berg Sonata which helped this listener to better grasp the historical context of this music. This small collection of works written for him reflects a collaborative and visionary ethic akin to that of Sarah Cahillâs. Keep an ear out for this guy.\n\nI have received some good natured teasing about the fact that this, one of my longer reviews, is of a 15 minute piece of music. But this act of musical archeology by the bay areaâs Kate Stenberg (who is a regular collaborator with Sarah Cahill BTW) has made the first recording of this little work. Itâs Webernian duration belies a style very much in character with this beloved composerâs other work. My review was as much about the music and the recording as it was about the dedication of Stenberg to new music. This release is from Other Minds, another shining example of advocacy of new music and collaboration among composers and performers. Get it. Listen to it. And donât miss a chance to hear Stenberg live performances or to hear anything Harrison has written.\n\nThe Chicago based Cedille label is one of my favorite classical music labels. Producer James Ginsburg has a golden ear and Cedille is the finest Chicago based classical label since the justly fabled Mercury records. All their releases deserve attention but this two disc set of little known works for String Trio written between the world wars is a feast of substantive, if slightly conservative, voices. This one is a great listen and, trust me, none of this music is in your collection.\n\nWhile circumstances conspired to limit my attendance to only one of the three days of OM 26, I would be loathe to leave this world class music festival off my âbest ofâ list. My first published blog of 2023 was of the 30th anniversary celebration which showcased Marc-Andre Hamelinâs stunning reading of Charles Ivesâ massive Concord Sonata. Anything OM does deserves your attention but the roughly annual festival continues to present composers and performers from around the world. Not to be missed.\n\nAnother exciting release of Cahillâs visionary series. Like the previous volume (and the aforementioned Cedille release) the consumer will suffer no unnecessary duplications if the music herein. Fascinating and expertly done. This set (the third volume due this year) is a testament to Cahillâs encyclopedic knowledge of piano music as well as her collaborative nature and, of course, her skills as a pianist.\n\nIâm cheating a bit here since I wasnât able to complete my review until 2023 but this Starkland disc was released in 2022 and definitely earns its place in my âbest ofâ list. This rising star is another one to watch. Starkland, run by the dynamic Tom Steenland is one of those labels that reliably finds interesting and substantive new music. This one is no exception. It goes a long way to alleviating my skepticism of the electroacoustic genre.\n\nAnd, in order to be fair I must cheat equitably. Charles Amirkhanian kindly sent me this exciting and excellent DVD of his collaboration with his partner in life and in artistic crimes, Carol Law. My more extensive review will appear shortly but this was a major release in 2022. Amirkhanian spends far less time promoting and performing his own unique compositions so this is an especially welcome release.\n\nLast but not least of my best of 2022 is this wonderful Neuma release which, when I began my research to write a cogent and informed review, left me stunned at how little I actually knew about composer David Tudor and the astounding dimensions of this unusual piece that evolves with every performance. After gathering a whole ton of data I finally decided that I could not write a comprehensive review without more research so I settled on a tasteful (I hope) summary with the expectation that I will write a larger piece on Tudor and his work. The review will be out very shortly. This is an amazing and significant release.\n\nHappy 2023 to all my readers and thanks to those who kept reading my blog during more fallow times. I have many blogs currently in preparation that I look forward to sharing in the months to come. Peace, health, and music to all."
