        "text": "Page 129 →Four Indistinct Minimalisms Punk, No Wave, and the Death of Minimalism\n\nMinimalism died in the late 1970s. It’s hard to precisely date the change, but in the same moment that the music was nationally recognized as an accessible style of American composition demanding audience attention, the name itself was widely judged inadequate for a music overcoming its prior, unfortunate commitments. Within those judgments it circulated all the more.\n\nThe shifts away from earlier austerity were visible everywhere. Philip Glass and Steve Reich, the two composers most closely associated with the style, had each turned to large-scale commissions for traditional orchestras and opera companies. In the New York Times, John Rockwell wrote that Reich’s most recent piece Tehillim included “variation of tempo, a freer harmonic palette, and specific examples of word painting.” If he’s writing such Page 130 →music, “Can Mr. Reich really be called a ‘minimalist’?”4 Reich is happy to declare the movement dead—but only while noting that he isn’t, and that minimalism’s impact can be heard in the music of John Adams, on the one hand, and in rock, on the other. Writing a year earlier in High Fidelity, Tim Page foregrounded the inadequacy of the name and some possible alternatives: “Minimalist music? Pulse Music, if you prefer. Pattern Music. The New York Times has called it ‘trance music’; critic Richard Kostelanetz refers to ‘modular music.’ Philip Glass, one of the leading figures in the field, likes to call his work ‘music with repetitive structures’; the rock crowd grooves to ‘space music’; and detractors have decried the ‘stuck-record school of composition.’”5 Page’s “Minimalist Primer” eventually concedes to “settle upon the most popular, if not the most apt, label for this style.”\n\nHow are we to read his presentation of all of these, potentially more appropriate, synonyms? First, they suggest that properly naming a compositional style is difficult, but possible, work; and second, that “minimalism” is to be read as dismissive or slanderous. In 1977 Joan LaBarbara had dismissed the label for precisely that reason, saying that the label minimalism was “purely laughable to label such rich and complex music.”6 John Adams, Reich’s preferred inheritor of minimalism’s estate, had much the same complaint: his music, “Romantic, classical, minimalist, all at the same time,” is “a little too rich” to be labeled minimalist.7 These proclamations of death and inadequacy nevertheless did not stop Time magazine from declaring 1982 “the year of minimalism.”8\n\nEach of these accounts, written between 1977 and 1982, insists that minimalism is something to be gotten over. It is ignorance, negativity, austerity—even, we can extrapolate from LaBarbara and Adams, impoverishment. But High Fidelity, Newsday, and Time introduce minimalism to a national audience not because the music is ignorant, negative, and austere, but rather as a success story: the composers of ignorance, negativity, and austerity have grown up and come to their senses! Certainly another name could have been proposed for this music at the moment of its arrival to national attention. But the fact that the name generates so much handwringing is perhaps the point. Minimalism arrived not only as an exciting, new compositional style: it also a moral and historical lesson about abandoning youthful naivete, radicalism, and ignorance. Capital-M Minimalism was announced to national audiences precisely as a celebration of having overcome its being early. “Minimalism is dead” should perhaps rather be read as “(Early) minimalism is dead—say hello to Minimalism!”\n\nAll of these (early) M/minimalism(s) must be read as homonymic, and the discourse of minimalism as a battle over homonyms.9 Homonymy provides Page 131 →one overshadowed genealogy of Rancière’s use of the (near synonyms) “disagreement” and “dissensus.” Indeed, the short-lived discourse of homonymy in his work precedes those more popular concepts as terms of art in his work. Published immediately prior to Disagreement, Rancière’s The Names of History sets in motion a reading of French historiography through placing in tension disjunct meanings of a disciplinary homonym: histoire. Whereas English and German distinguish between fictional story and factual account, “The French language designates lived experience, its faithful narrative, its lying fiction, and its knowledgeable explanation all by the same name.”10 This poses a problem for “homonym hunters” who insist that a rigorous science of history requires precise definition of terms and ardent, unequivocal language. Therein lies the founding paradox of history as a discipline: “The confusion of language was in fact needed to measure the dilemma in its rigor: . . . the difference between history as science and history as narrative was necessarily produced in the heart of narrative, with the latter’s words and use of words.”11 That is, while historical scholarship often polices historical uses of language in contemporary statements of distinction, it retains a proximity to literature—to storytelling—in its medium (words) and their inescapably ambiguous usages.\n\nHow do we tell apart histories and stories? Rancière uses the term poetics of knowledge to name “the set of literary procedures by which a discourse escapes literature, gives itself the status of a science, and signifies this status.”12 History, he argues, is a result of the conjunction of science and nonscience, fact and fiction. Opining this conjunction leads too many historians into elaborate narrative frameworks aimed at escaping the danger of narrative in constructing the historical facticity of their account.13 And indeed the language of the account is fundamental here too: Rancière often notes that logos, as reason or speech, is not only speech but also its account. That is, the stagings or emplotments of logic, reason, language, and speech as recounted after the fact are inseparable from reason itself.14 Hence the place of staging, of teaching, of historiography in his work; hence, too, the skepticism toward articulated gaps between presentation and representation, transitivity and intransitivity, discourse and metadiscourse, and so on. There is history as a discipline, he argues, precisely because words are not in precise “harmony” with the things they refer to. These tensions and paradoxes are what produce not only historiography, but also the objects of histories: disagreements, misunderstandings, appropriations of language to render a counterfactual, failures to properly articulate policy, revolts against unjust laws, punning critiques on protest placards, and battles over the implied, presumed, and unthought meanings of our most ambiguous (that is, our most important) words.\n\nPage 132 →Homonymy plays a key role here. The normative practice of historical science is to examine the documents of history to distinguish the “true,” or “proper,” or “correct” usages of a term like “minimalism” from those that are false, improper, or incorrect. We build a metadiscourse and a method around such distinctions. In a later essay, “The Use of Distinctions,” Rancière calls back to his discussion of homonymy as fundamental to his political, aesthetic, and historiographical conceptions, and retroactively redefines disagreement as “a conflict over homonyms.”15 He continues, “There are two ways to deal with homonyms. One is to proceed to purify them, to identify the good name and the good sense and disperse the bad. Such is often the practice of the so-called human and social sciences, which boast that they only leave to philosophy empty or definitely equivocal names.”16 We can think here of key terms in philosophy like truth, love, or justice. “The other way considers that every homonymy arranges a space of thought and of action, and that the problem is therefore neither to eliminate the prestige of the homonymy, nor to take names back to radical indetermination, but to deploy the intervals which put the homonymy to work.”17 To think through homonyms means to privilege not masterful, scientistic explanations of surfaces and depths or causes and effects, but distributions of sensibility as apportioned by a given usage in a particular historical context.\n\nSuch a conception of homonymy could be a broad principle for historical work, as is made clear in Rancière’s discussion of disciplinary names like “history,” “politics,” and “philosophy” as homonyms.18 In the case of minimalism, however, I want to make the case that more is at stake. I want to tie Rancière’s notion of homonymy (as setting up and “inhabiting the gap”19 between terms) to my earlier discussion of (early) minimalism as productive of indistinctions. That is, where many important terms can be historiographically staged as homonymic, I want to insist not only that minimalism is served by this Rancièrian method, but more importantly that minimalism provides an exemplary instance for building upon it. This is because minimalism is precisely about setting up and operating indistinctions: between composition and performance, rehearsal and concert, writing and recording, composing and listening, composers and bands, and so on. In this chapter, I am also interested not in the distinction that Reich suggests between “rock” and “John Adams,” but rather another indistinction, this time between “punk” and “minimalism.” Minimalist music sets as its task the staging of such indistinctions, and staging musical indistinctions is productive of minimalist music. This is the challenge that it offers to (art) music historiography. In light of this production of minimal, proximate relationships, we need to seriously questionPage 133 → the efforts to classify and distinguish within it or, as in the case of this chapter, to insist upon its death as a means of arguing that it has ceased to be what it was (early minimalism) in favor of becoming what it is (Minimalism).\n\nFrom Rancière, then, in this chapter I borrow a conceptual framing of historiography as staging disputes over homonyms. My question is this: How did “minimalism” circulate as an undifferentiated label in the years prior to becoming universally and consensually recognized as referring to the (inadequately named) Minimalist music of Young, Riley, Reich, and Glass? Against existing narrations of such a question, I do not distinguish between good and bad uses of the word, but rather insist that they are all homonyms of each other: that is, that everyone is using the same name but meaning a different thing by it. Such a rendering of speech and writing relies not on truth and falsity, but on different distributions of sensibility. This is not a gesture of throwing up my hands in the air in favor of relativism. Rather, I want to insist that the term circulated broadly and is consistently found as an operator in naming various indistinctions mobilized across sounds, venues, and figures in downtown New York of the late 1970s. Most importantly, none of the critical applications examined below will be negative accusations or dismissals, in contrast to the above concerns about the term’s inadequacy. That is, in the moment before Minimalism arrived as a singular discourse of celebrating getting-over-being-minimal, minimalism was a positive label of various practices of performing indistinction on the downtown scene. Minimalism moved quickly from being dismissed as “early” to being lamented as “dead.” My claims about homonymy should not be reduced to a cynical suggestion that interpersonal communication is impossible; rather, the whole point is the miraculous fact, constantly affirmed in everyday life, that we manage to communicate even across such layered and incommunicative misunderstandings. I am reminded here of the discussion of Young and Conrad in Chapter 2. There my point was not that Conrad was purely right and Young purely wrong; rather, I think the remarkable thing is that the Theatre of Eternal Music managed to function for three years with many members differently (mis)understanding the nature of what they were doing together.\n\nTo present my reading, I turn to yet another pair of composer-collaborators: Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham. Few would challenge their minimalist credentials, but they have played little part in understanding minimalism’s discursive arrival, and certainly not in the conventional narratives of music history courses. For my part, they were a contingent choice: I explored their reviews as part of an initial framing of media portrayals of collaborators prior to their (inevitable) disputes. I spent little time in earlier Page 134 →chapters working through the nature of the authorial disputes and none on resolving them. Here I pay even less attention: the reasons for Branca and Chatham’s falling out play no part here. Instead, they are figures that help locate a discourse in its place while also following its broadest circulation. The two worked together frequently in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and each was frequently acknowledged as a leader of the downtown scene. Tracking their crossings leads me to all manner of indistinctions. These play most importantly on Reich’s distinctions in the epigraph to this chapter. Minimalism should be buried, he says, but not before counting its relevance and impact in the autonomous, compositional minimalism of John Adams on the one hand, and on a heterogeneous style like rock music, on the other. Chatham and Branca draw us into a world not of either-or, but of both-and; not of distinction, but of indistinction, between two coterminous, emergent discursive labels: punk and minimalism.\n\nWhere can we point to an exemplary blurring of these chronologies? In 1976, the same year that many histories insist that the term “minimalism” came into common usage in art music criticism, the Ramones played over forty shows at CBGB and other clubs in support of their first album, released on 23 April. The next day Steve Reich and Musicians premiered Music for 18 Musicians at Town Hall. I am not claiming that either directly influenced the other, that we should suggest they are musically the same, or that either could possibly be seen to precede the other (as both went through extensive rehearsal and performance well before these “official” release dates). Instead, I simply contend that such contrast calls to attention why, when albums like Reich’s Music for a Large Ensemble or Glass’s North Star were released in 1977 critics might have raised flags about them being particularly “minimal.” This is even truer when they appeared on record store shelves alongside the first Ramones LP in the spring of 1976, or in comparison to No New York produced by Brian Eno (discussed below) in the fall of 1978. Perhaps most importantly, as I will show below, in the summer of 1976 and the months and years immediately following, it would become increasingly difficult to know whether New York critics were referring to Reich or the Ramones when they labeled a performance or recording “minimal.” Such homonymic blurring has played no part in music-historical genealogies of the term “minimalism” in large part because such writing begins from a teleological drive toward tidy, taxonomic classification. But as I will show, by 1978 it had become far more common to label a punk show “minimal” than a concert by Glass at Carnegie Hall.\n\nWe should take the rejections and distancing from “minimalism” that were so prominent among composers and critics not as yet another instance of an Page 135 →ahistorical, transcendent dismissal of a genre name as insufficient to the complexity of a composer’s output. (As Reich likes to note, Debussy disliked the term impressionism.) Rather, I want to suggest that such rejections are more in line with what we should call—redirecting the term from Johann Girard’s history of minimalism—a “double rejection.”20 For Girard, the two rejections were minimalism’s foundational refusals of both serialism and chance. For my purposes, the rejections are not only historical but also political. Reich, Glass, and others were not only distancing themselves from the authorial politics of their own early music; they were also refusing the critical discourses that articulated a connection between their music and that of the Ramones, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Talking Heads, Theoretical Girls, and other bands being labeled as “minimal” far more often than were Reich or Glass in the New York music press at the time. Choosing to follow Branca and Chatham in their movements through the downtown New York scene means voting in favor of following minimalism’s production of indistinction. Keeping a close eye to both the presence and the absence of the word “minimal” in New York music press during the late 1970s, particularly in reviews related to Branca and Chatham, helps clarify what the emergent, major discourse of Minimalism covered up, and where those blurring indistinctions do not carry over. This chapter’s real dispute, then, is less that between Branca and Chatham than that between various indistinct minimalism(s) and the hegemonic image of a distinct, zombified, big-M Minimalism.\n\nBuilding “Minimal” Consensus\n\n22 Jill Johnston’s 1964 review of the first Theatre of Eternal Music performance;23 and John Perreault’s 1968 article on Young are prominent early examples.24 In his negative review of an early performance of Four Organs, Donal Henahan used the term, Edward Strickland writes, “more specifically than Perreault’s relatively casual adjective, though still not in a specifically denominative manner.”25 Michael Nyman’s first interview with Steve Reich, in 1970, is often connected to Reich’s 1972 Artforum interview with Emily Wasserman, in which he concedes that “there is some relationshipPage 136 → between my music and any Minimal art” in that an artist like Sol LeWitt “will set up an idea and work it through rigorously.”26 Pride of place frequently goes to Village Voice critic Tom Johnson, who Strickland argues “first applied [minimalism] explicitly and directly to the music as a movement or shared style in” September 1972 in his article “La Monte Young, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, Philip Glass.”27 Johnson further stabilized the term by referring, in an often-cited usage, to the tape music of Charlemagne Palestine as “perhaps the most extreme form of musical minimalism” he had yet encountered.28 A few months later, John Rockwell, another New York critic who will be of central importance below, noted that Glass’s music relied on an “austerely minimalist aesthetic”—though he was referring to the fact that his new piece, Music in 12 Parts, might in fact be a betrayal of this aesthetic.29\n\nHistorians have been rather consistent in their narrations of these appearances. Strickland contends that, despite this flurry of early applications, the frequent usage of minimal/ism by Johnson, Rockwell, and Nyman around 1974 “did not cause either a terminological or musical revolution” because the “music itself had yet to attain mainstream acceptance as classical music.”30 Instead, it was only with the popular and institutional successes of 1976—Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians premiered at Town Hall on 24 April, and Glass’s Einstein on the Beach at the Metropolitan Opera on 21 November—“that mainstream critics began looking in earnest for a label . . . and Minimalism . . . slowly became a household word, at least in more progressive households.”31 Strickland is clear on this point in developing his method for sorting through the archive: while the word appears more or less concretely, more or less assertively, and more or less frequently from the mid-1960s on, it only takes on a strong denominative consistency following the major 1976 premieres by Glass and Reich, and then often as a retrospective label for the style that the two had left behind. That is, as the term began to appear in heavy circulation, it was already being dismissed: “By the time the term was affixed to the music, the period of strict Minimalism was long since over and the composers had evolved in distinctly non-minimal directions.”32 Early, then dead.\n\nThe conductor Paul Hillier’s stance in his introduction to the 2000 Oxford edition of Reich’s Writings on Music is characteristic of the more recent treatment of this period. “By the mid-1970s,” Hillier writes, soon pointing specifically to 1976, the style of music based on\n\nsteady-state tonality, a fixed rhythmic pulse, and unremitting focus on a single, slowly unfolding pattern . . . had earned the epithet “minimalist”Page 137 → . . . , although the composers most deeply involved were already beginning to produce works of such size and stature that both the label and the dismissiveness with which it was so often applied began to look mean-spirited and, worse, misguided.33\n\nIndeed it is the exact years in question, 1976 to 1982, from Music for 18 Musicians and Einstein on the Beach through to Reich’s Tehillim, Glass’s Koyaanisqatsi, and Time’s “year of minimalism,” that have been treated as the obvious stopping point in many of the major scholarly histories of minimalism.34 Indeed, it’s a difficult period for many historians who refuse to get over the universal importance heaped onto the (radical, or swinging, or hip, or countercultural) 1960s. Regardless of the supposed freedoms resulting from breaking with metanarratives inaugurated by “postmodernism,” Kristin Ross has noted that the early 1980s marked the moment when “consensus first comes to be taken for granted as the optimum political gesture or goal.”35 Moreover, such consensus was very often introduced and carried by figures formerly associated with radical politics, but who had become repentant for their earlier radicalism (see the Introduction).\n\nHistorians have sought to impose consensus upon the diverse usage of the word “minimalism.” Much like the discourse of “purity” around Pendulum Music (see Chapter 1), this historical consensus most often takes the form of sorting through the archive of available reviews to narrate the arrival at an unequivocal meaning. Scholars like Keith Potter, Peter Shelley, Edward Strickland, and most recently Christophe Levaux have uniformly fallen into the same trap: that of believing that minimalism is what it is, that it could be found where it was, and that history should be the process of narrating how it got there. Despite the valuable archival and historical contributions each draws from his idiomatic readings, they each more and less write this evidence within a narrative of minimalism becoming itself somewhere around 1980. Levaux’s recent book drastically expands upon these possibilities by reintroducing dead-end labels like “theatre of mixed means,” “music with roots in the aether,” and “solo ensemble music” for early tapes and live musician pieces.36 Even still, articulating the definition of a label like minimalism under such assumptions necessarily begins from drawing a line partitioning “proper” and “improper” usage. Within this regime of archival investigation, any piece of evidence can be split into one of two categories: first, pieces of criticism that use the term “minimalism,” but require qualification in that they do not precisely align with the meaning of the term that we expect today;37 and second, pieces of criticism that accurately reflect the aesthetic Page 138 →of minimalism as we today understand it but call it something other than minimalism.38\n\nWhile these and other historians carefully follow the nuances and subtleties of reception, there is a general methodological fault in trying to build up the discourse around the eventually dominant figures and applications of closely related terminology—that is, in expecting to find minimalism exactly where we know it to be.39 This method produces striking aporias in the archival search. For example, while scholars frequently note that Johnson’s first review was of Reich’s Drumming premiere in 1971, that he grouped together Young, Riley, Reich, and Glass in 1972, or that he labeled Charlemagne Palestine’s music a radical form of minimalism in 1974, no scholars has remarked on Johnson’s very strong application of the term in March 1972.\n\nRhys Chatham was hired by Woody and Steina Vasulka as the Kitchen’s first music programmer at the end of 1971 at the age of nineteen, and held the position until 1973, and then again in 1976–1978 following stints by Arthur Russell and Garrett List. During the first months of his programming, Chatham put on several concerts featuring his own music, including one that drew a review from Johnson in the Voice.40 The 9 March 1972 article, titled “A Surprise under the Piano”—only three months after the review of Drumming that began Johnson’s career at the Voice (and which did not include the word “minimal” in any form)41—reviews Chatham’s concert “Music with Voice and Gongs.” The closing piece for four amplified gongs, Johnson writes, “allowed [the gongs] to do their own beautiful thing, with a minimum of human tampering.” While the adjective “minimum” here is a general descriptor, it is closely followed by the proclamation that Chatham’s music was “a radical new kind of minimalism which almost negated the whole idea of composition.” Here, the close proximity of two applications—“minimum” as a descriptor, and “minimalism” as a stylistic label—encourages consideration of the concept’s consistency. Indeed, the second usage recalls Johnson’s frequently cited claim—from two years later—about Palestine’s tape music as “the most extreme form of musical minimalism” the critic had yet encountered.42\n\nWhat is minimal, across both usages in the article on Chatham, is not the sonic materials; instead, it is that the composer’s interventions in the sound are kept to a minimum, and that this refusal to tamper created a music in which the traditional concept of composition was “almost negated.” Indeed, it is the only early, explicit usage of the term that is immediately followed by a definition of what Johnson means by the term, and several years before the early usages that Johnson himself prioritizes in his volume of collected writings.43 This helps distinguish quite clearly the “minimal” (which he often applied Page 139 →to Palestine, Spiegel, Behrman, and Chatham) and the “hypnotic” (Young, Riley, Reich, Glass) in Johnson’s writing. For Johnson, minimalism has more to do with authorship (or its near negation) than with formal features of the sounding results; though minimal authorship is surely audible in the sonic product, emphasis is placed on the composer’s minimal involvement in producing that sound.\n\nOf course, “minimal” came up in a number of contexts during the mid- to late 1970s. For Bernard Gendron the aesthetics of “minimalism” played a key role in Lester Bangs’s conception of punk, which Gendron summarizes in relation to three themes: “sheer aggressiveness and loudness,” “minimalism,” and “defiant, rank amateurism.”44 While Gendron’s outline of the Bangs/punk aesthetic as a whole is important, his understanding of minimalism in particular helps in considering the interrelated senses of the “minimal” in circulation in music in late 1970s downtown New York. Gendron writes:\n\nAs a label, “minimalism” entered art world discourses rather late, only in the mid-1960s, when it became a favorite aesthetic buzzword in painting and sculpture reduced to bare-bones abstraction. . . . By the early 1970s, “minimalism” was being applied to the stripped-down, repetitive pattern-oriented music of Lamonte Young [sic], Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Philip Glass—not to their liking, one might add [Gendron here cites Strickland’s overview of the term]. By the mid-seventies New York rock criticism, operating within the hothouse atmosphere of the New York art world and increasingly receptive to Bangs’s punk philosophy, was actively incorporating the art label “minimalism” into its discourses about the CBGB scene.45\n\nBangs’s punk philosophy tracked the development of a freer, noise-oriented, and less song-based form of rock music emerging from the Velvet Underground and the Stooges.46 This music straddled an entirely different relationship between artfulness and populism than the one explored by groups like the Who and what Bangs called “lumbering sloths like Led Zeppelin.” Gendron reads this distinction through an “art/pop dialectic” by showing how the term “minimalism” functioned in the “promotional jargon for the CBGB underground . . . [as] the productive dissonance of art and pop.” The group that appeared as the “ultimate and paradigmatic minimalists”—producing this indistinct dissonance between art and pop—was, for critics at the time, the Ramones. Within their music, the term “minimalism” served a dual discursive function:\n\nPage 140 →On the pop side, “minimalism” implied simplicity and adherence without ornamentation to a basic universal rock framework, which in turn implied accessibility, familiarity, and eminent commerciality. . . . On the other hand, “minimalism” is clearly an art term betokening a certain self-conscious approach to musical materials—a certain conceptuality, certain views about history and tradition, even a certain detachment.47\n\nThere is a problem with Gendron’s reading, however. None of the critics that he cites directly uses the term “minimalism”; it is Gendron’s own term to summarize a particular aesthetic value within the punk scene, which he sees as the relationship to a “universal rock framework” that refuses the flighty song forms, improvisation, solos, and jams of the dominant stadium rock bands of the time. (This distinction is heavily racialized, with many of the new-wave and no-wave bands entirely erasing any African American influence from their music, in contrast to most rock music of the time.)48 The first time “minimalism” appears in the primary citations in this section of Gendron’s book is in a quotation from Tommy Ramone, cited decades later in Clinton Heylin’s oral “pre-history for a post-punk world”: “Whenever we had to find someone to play with us, we’d use the Talking Heads. Even though the Ramones played hard and raunchy, conceptually there were a lot of similarities: the minimalism.”49 Later Chris Frantz of Talking Heads, reflecting on the exact same issue from the other side, is quoted as saying: “The Ramones, in their purist minimalism, could be viewed more abstractly ‘not just [as] a band,’ but as ‘a real good idea.’” Indeed, minimalism, “with doses of irony and parody,” Gendron writes, “became the recognized aesthetic trademark of the Talking Heads as well as of the Ramones.”50\n\nNevertheless—and Gendron surely knew this, but did not directly need to quote these sources to make his admittedly more philosophical than historical case—these two bands, alongside many others, were frequently labeled minimalists in the rock press of the late 1970s. This was particularly true of English publications like Melody Maker and New Musical Express, which used the concept of “minimalism” to clearly distinguish a feature of the American punk scene from its English counterpart. Reflecting on this difference, Michael Watts, writing from England in September 1976, argues that New York “punk is Minimalism (I think it means making a virtue out of very little),” in contrast to the aggressive assault of the British bands.51 When Talking Heads were put on the cover of the Village Voice following their third-ever concert in 1975, James Wolcott wrote that they are “one of the most intriguingPage 141 → off-the-wall bands in New York. Musically, they’re minimalists.”52 As outlined above, at this point the term had not yet gained any precise consistency as an identity for composers. The title of the article—“A Conservative Impulse in the New York Rock Underground”—suggests that minimalism in rock is a backward-looking mellowing of bombastic 1970s rock.\n\nThe British context was similar. In the summer of 1977, Nick Kent of New Musical Express wrote that Talking Heads had immediately taken their place among “Television, Patti Smith, the Ramones, and Heartbreakers” as part of the CBGB scene in New York. He continues, “Convenient tags like ‘punk’ and ‘art-rock’ found themselves strange bed-fellows in numerous articles consummated by the inevitable bandying of the term ‘minimalism.’”53 Kent joins British colleagues in using minimalism to contrast the current New York punk scene from the “gashed-up rock” of a few years earlier by acts like the New York Dolls. Minimalism is defined as a “new austerely dressed-down form of rock” of which Talking Heads were the dominant practitioners. Mick Farren, also writing from England, offers a similar perspective. He refutes the belief that the Ramones draw on the noisy legacy of the New York Dolls, MC5, or The Who; rather, Farren claims, their music recalls “the Shangri-Las, the Ronettes” and all the rest of the “baroque” school of early sixties, Phil Spector pop. The difference is that “they’ve taken that music, and . . . they’ve removed the arrangement, the harmonies, the twenty-piece orchestra, the introduction, the coda, and even the melody.” He continues, “This is minimalism in its highest and purest form.” He concludes, recognizing one of the central critical problems of the coming years, by noting that “one of the crosses the minimalist has to bear is that the lumpen public always tends to assume that his constant efforts to reduce everything to its basic components is a symptom of stupidity and lack of talent.”54 The British press continued its effort to make sense of the New York rock scene even into 1980, when an article in Melody Maker again referred to “the infectious minimalism of the Ramones [that] has been with us for six years now.”55 Talking Heads and the Ramones became the dominant models of this self-conscious, intellectualized version of American punk as minimalism. Perhaps most importantly, the term is applied sincerely, without claiming its inadequacy; that is, it is a more direct and literal application than was the case, around the same time, of “minimalism” among the big four.\n\n“Minimalism,” as I will continue to show, meant a lot of things throughout the 1970s in New York. In the early years, it referred to a style of visual art in which an idea was set up and allowed to rigorously run through a process, which critics immediately recognized as heavily influential on Reich (via Page 142 →Sol LeWitt) in particular.56 Around this same time, it became an important adjective for critics like Johnson and Nyman, who used it rather consistently to refer to music involving little contrast between materials such that most of the material is present at the outset, as well as music in which the authorial voice is defined by as little tampering as possible in the resultant sound or formal structure. When rock critics picked up on the term, it was used, as Gendron notes, to reference the self-conscious conceptualism of the visual arts, as well as to stripping down song structures to their bare bones. It was only after this punk usage that the term took on consistency as the proper name of a genre defined by repetition and drone, as exemplified by emergent household names like Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, and, shortly thereafter, John Adams. But more than any of these uses, what’s important is how, at each step, we find the term “minimalism” used to mark indistinct junctures, moments of impurity and indifferentiation. We must avoid the trap of staging such moments of indistinction as sloppy steps on the way toward a pure, metaphysical conception; rather, each indistinction exacerbates and intensifies the preexisting ones. Minimalism, that is, does not need to be made distinct, but rather registered as an operator of indistinction.\n\nWhat is most important for me is considering the indistinct blurring between these two usages of the term: not that there is a world of art where it holds one meaning and a world of pop in which it holds another, but that these two worlds were essentially the same. The word “minimalism” names a discursive gap and the practice of inhabiting it. The “distinctive” feature of minimalism I am drawing out, if it must be seen that way, is “not between two principles of [mutual] exclusion, but between two principles of co-existence.”57 These two worlds existed within the same venues, called to the same critics and performers, and staged a real-world denotative conjunction. The historiographic obligation is to find a way for writing to inhabit that gap rather than beginning from dividing the scene into distinct zones and hybrids, notable precursors and traceable influences. Criticism of Chatham and Branca can help animate that buzzing, minimal gap rather than resolving it. Their selection was contingent. I am not putting them forward as exceptional figures not given their due, but rather as figures who draw our attention to how different emphases empower trajectories of minimalism living through and beyond the era of its imposed “death.” I want to show that, while authors for major publications like High Fidelity and Time always tied mention of minimalism (vis-à-vis Young, Riley, Reich, and Glass) to the inadequacy of the term, downtown critics like Johnson, John Rockwell, Page 143 →Greg Sandow, and Jon Pareles, when writing about Branca or Chatham and their broader circle, frequently labeled music “minimal” without any cynical distance—that is, without feeling the need to reject the term as insufficient or derogatory. It did not name an imposed austerity or ignorant regression but a new principle about how composition, performance, and authorship could be understood.\n\nRhys Chatham’s Minimalist Education\n\nAs Johnson’s review above already shows, reading criticism of Chatham from the 1970s adds a new dimension to the discourse of “minimalism” in play at the time. Indeed, Chatham was central to what minimalism was and would become in the early 1970s—not only through his compositions, but also in his modes of performing, curating concerts, and sharing resources. For my part, I recognize Chatham as the first composer to have been pedagogically steeped in the early music of Young, Riley, Conrad, Reich, Glass, and others while they were all still involved in collaborative early minimalism. Like each of them, Chatham’s turn toward minimalism was a specific rejection of an earlier attachment to academic serialism.\n\nThis rejection began at a 1969 Terry Riley concert in a series called the Electric Ear.58 The intermedia performance was well attended, and even drew a positive review from the notoriously conservative Harold C. Schonberg in the Times. There the eminent critic referred to Riley as “a pianist-saxophonist-composer-electronics specialist who has become one of the heroes of the new movement.”59 There is no mention of “minimalism” or anything “minimal”; indeed, Schonberg’s one complaint is of the maximal volume pushed beyond the pain threshold. He writes that “[Riley’s] thing is repetition of patterns to the point of hypnosis,” adding, “His left hand . . . must be made of one of the new unbreakable synthetic plastics.” Schonberg’s review calls my attention to where New York and its music scene stood at that moment: plastics were new, repetition was new, high-volume concerts were new, as was a non-proscenium venue that included a state-of-the-art “color console” for throwing elaborate psychedelic projections onto and behind the performer—but it was all becoming prevalent enough that the Times had to send its chief classical music critic.\n\nA 1981 profile of Chatham by John Rockwell singled out the importance of this concert for the young composer. Chatham is quoted as saying, “In 1968 [sic], the Electric Circus had a Monday evening series of new-music Page 144 →concerts called ‘The Electric Ear.’ At the time, I didn’t even like tonal music, but I heard Terry Riley, and that was [a] big influence.”60 Chatham further discussed the event when I spoke with him in 2014.\n\nI went to hear Terry Riley. I was this young composer and I thought, “I’m gonna hear some really good noise!” And I got there and saw this long-haired guy with red hair and striped bell-bottom pants playing circus organ! And I was absolutely disgusted . . . because at the time, tonality was completely out. If you wanted to be a hip composer, it had to be dissonant. So I went downstairs and asked for my money back. It was five dollars to get in, which you can imagine what five dollars was like for a seventeen-year-old in 1968 [sic]. . . . And they wouldn’t give it to me, so I said, “Aw, what the heck, I’ll go back and listen.” And I listen, and I said, “You know, this isn’t so bad!” Of course it was Rainbow in Curved Air—like a long, hour-and-a-half version. And then there was an intermission and then they played Poppy Nogood with David Rosenboom playing viola. And all I can say is I walked in there a serialist and I walked out converted as a hardcore minimalist.61\n\nFollowing the Riley concert, Chatham became involved in Morton Subotnick’s studio at New York University, where he met composers Maryanne Amacher, Charlemagne Palestine, and Ingram Marshall. “And so, there was Charlemagne doing these pieces of long duration, and I said, ‘Well, I like pieces of long duration too.’ I had just been to see the Terry Riley concert. And Marianne was into music of long duration too.” He continues,\n\nComposers back then, on the downtown scene, couldn’t play at McMillan Hall at Columbia because we weren’t doing the right type of music. And neither was Philip and neither was Steve. And so the way all those guys handled it, Philip and Steve before Charlemagne and me of course, and La Monte and Terry ten years before anybody—the way we handled it, we realized we could do the concerts in people’s living rooms in SoHo.62\n\nChatham set out to develop a music series to provide himself and his friends a space to perform their music, and found the space to do so at the Kitchen. “I modeled the series I did at the Kitchen on Thais Lathem’s series Monday nights at the Electric Circus”—the same series in which he first heard Riley (and minimalism) two years earlier.63 It was thus out of that first minimalist Page 145 →experience that Chatham became a “minimalist”—something that he viewed as not only an aesthetic orientation, but also a practice of programming, institutional relations, and performance practice; in the 1981 profile with Rockwell, he retroactively labels Riley’s performance at Lathem’s series a “first epiphany.”\n\nChatham’s first stint as a concert programmer began in October 1971 and leaned heavily on the parallel influences of La Monte Young and Tony Conrad. The 4 October concert featured works by Laurie Spiegel alongside pieces by Chatham with titles like Composition Equalizer, Composition 15.iv.71, and Journey of the Sine Wave Generator and the Square Wave that clearly reflect Young’s influence not only sonically but in titling practices (Figure 11). He subsequently booked Young for a concert on 13 December 1971 (Figure 12). Because the Kitchen could not afford to pay Young’s high fees, he was offered 100 percent of the door sales. As Chatham recalls it, Marian Zazeela insisted that they accept the offer, as the pair were particularly cash strapped at the moment. Young’s concession was to put on a “performance” that was simply a listening session to the couple’s recent Black LP. “So we had the record player and La Monte put the needle on and we listened to the record. And on one side it was a version of just Marian and he and the Moog synthesizer playing The Tortoise, His Dreams and Journeys, and on the other side was the gong piece. And the concert finished and Marian was very pleased: ‘Well, La Monte, we got our grocery money.’”64\n\nThe Kitchen had become the home of the 60 Hz hum. On 11 March 1972, the Kitchen provided space for the first performance of Conrad’s Ten Years Alive on the Infinite Plane, featuring Conrad on “violin, intervals from the just intonation families of 2, 3, 7, 11, and 17,” Chatham on “long string drone,” and Laurie Spiegel on “pulsing bass.”65 A few months later, on 25 May, “Rhys Chatham & Associates” presented the New York premiere of “Dr. Drone in Concert performing his quiet version of ‘composition in the key of 60 cycles.’” The piece again shows the overlapping influences of Conrad and Young during a period when the two were still on good terms; indeed, the work seems a direct outgrowth of the Theatre of Eternal Music, which Young had reformed with Chatham as one of the singers. Labeling the music “in the key of 60 cycles” recalls Conrad’s writing from Film Culture: “Outside the domain of 60 cycle current, our music will fall less resonantly on the city ear, the most tonal of all cultures.”66 The poster from the Kitchen proudly announces—the only instance of such an announcement I have ever seen—a program note written by Conrad for the concert. We should certainly take this as a sign of Chatham’s enthusiasm for Conrad’s theoretical sanction (Figure 13).67\n\nFollow for extended description\n\nFollow for extended description\n\nPage 147 →For all its associations with Young and Conrad, Chatham would have first encountered the 60-cycle drone at the Electric Ear. “Time is suspended,” Harold Schonberg wrote in his review of Riley’s performance. “One idea—either ingenious or Machiavellian, depending on how you look at it—occurred in the second piece. There Mr. Riley pulled a plug from one of the amplifiers to create an open circuit. This low-pitched sound—around a B-flat?—kept going throughout the course of the composition, the longest pedal point in history.”68 Schonberg’s ear is surprisingly accurate, if his technological awareness was less so: the 60 Hz drone that would have resulted from his open circuit falls only slightly above the B-flat three octaves below middle C. In Page 148 →his program note, Conrad encouraged his readers to tune in to 60 cycles: stick your finger in a socket (“it’s more a shock to people watching”) or “transmit it through the air. Use your ears as transducers. . . . Join the most constant universal life event on our continent. Hum at 60 cycles.”69\n\nFollow for extended description\n\nClearly Chatham was a student of the Theatre of Eternal Music school, tuned into the punk-Pythagoreanism of open-circuit hum. The 60 Hz drone was perhaps the defining aesthetic of music curation in the Kitchen’s first years. Young and Conrad spent the summer of 1972 in Kassel, Germany, as participants in Documenta V, where both the Dream House (with Conrad hired to maintain Young’s oscillators), and Conrad’s film work were presented. When the performances were done, Conrad headed to Wümme, where he made his record Outside the Dream Syndicate with the progressive rock band Faust.70 Chatham recently claimed that he felt slighted at the time, as he had been involved in developing the music with Conrad and Spiegel as Ten Years Alive. In a 2008 interview, Chatham told Alan Licht that he was “really jealous . . . and a little pissed off” about Conrad recording the album with Faust. Page 149 →“Because we had developed the music as a trio—Tony, Laurie Spiegel, and myself. And then Tony went on tour and that record with Faust came out, and I was so sad. But I got over it really quickly. I liked what they were doing so much and I still listen to the album with great pleasure.”71\n\nTom Johnson was impressed with both the new venue and its precocious young music director. He profiled Chatham in an October 1972 piece titled “Someone’s in the Kitchen—with Music.”72 There Chatham is described as “a 23-year-old [sic] composer,” and “remarkably open-minded,” though “not the ambitious type that you might expect to be organizing concerts.”73 The Kitchen is described as “simply a space where composers can organize their own concerts,” in contrast to the institutionalized contemporary music venues and performance organizations around New York. The major contribution was in the concert format, as particularly highlighted by events in the upcoming second season, and in particular the “one-man” events by composers like Laurie Spiegel, Jim Burton, Judith Sherman, Garrett List, Phil Niblock, Tony Conrad, Alvin Lucier, and others. This “one-man format,” Johnson explained to his readers, was a welcome contrast to the typical art music program consisting of pieces by several different artists—a format in which “many remarkable ideas have gone by almost unnoticed, simply because they were stuffed into the middle of a concert which contained a potpourri of conflicting styles.”74 In contrast, the Kitchen allows artists to craft their own presentation context, giving their music (often drone-based, or duration-oriented, or repetitive) the space and time required to best experience it. As in Riley’s In C premiere, or the Theatre of Eternal Music loft concerts, composers now had a venue that supported novel presentation of not only music, but also authorship. What’s more, the composers were in almost every single case involved in the performance—a situation unheard of in uptown venues.\n\nIn 1973 Chatham passed the music director job to the cellist and composer Arthur Russell so that he could focus on his own music (Chatham would later take up the position again from 1976 to 1978). Chatham decided that he “had to break away from La Monte” because the pieces that he was writing “sounded very very much like Charlemagne Palestine or La Monte Young.” In the spring of 1976, Chatham had what he would call his “second epiphany,” following the first one at Electric Ear; in this case, the composer Peter Gordon (of the Love of Life Orchestra) brought Chatham to see a Ramones concert celebrating the release of their first LP, The Ramones; the concert was probably in April or May 1976.75 As Chatham had been working extensively with Young, Conrad, and Palestine during the period, and writing his Page 150 →own drone-inspired electronic music, his first experience of the Ramones was ironically one of harmonic complexity: “Those guys, their music was highly complex. They were playing two more chords than I was. They were playing three, I was only playing one.”76 The Ramones “epiphany” became an experience through which to clarify his own compositional voice; he realized a common trend among the composers he was interested in: “La Monte . . . had been highly influenced by a different kind of music, by North Indian classical music. Steve was influenced by jazz and had studied Ghanaian music. Philip was highly influenced by process art and by Ravi Shankar. And I said, ‘What can I do?’”77 Chatham immediately borrowed a Fender Telecaster from the composer Scott Johnson and began learning how to play electric guitar.78 Minimalism, Chatham reaffirms, places in resonant adjacency musical and artistic resources formerly imagined as “distant” or external, at least within the associated composers’ pedigreed backgrounds.\n\nThe two epiphanies—Riley and Ramones—position Chatham’s compositional career as a meeting of what we would today call “punk” and “minimalism,” though neither term was yet in concrete circulation. Chatham was primed for the Ramones concert as a result of prior listening experiences going back to the Electric Ear concert. He heard the Ramones as “complex”—against all discourse of the time, which labeled their music as the peak of punk rock “minimalism”—because he had been working with one chord since, after listening to Terry Riley, he became a self-described “hardcore minimalist.” Chatham made the connection clear as early as 1981 in his conversation with Rockwell: “I had never been to a rock concert in my life, and I loved what [the Ramones] were doing. There seemed to me a real connection between the minimalism I had been involved with and that kind of rock.”79 That Chatham clearly and loudly identifies as a “minimalist” is central—and that he was doing so in 1981 even more so. As in my reading of Reich writing It’s Gonna Rain “after listening to Terry Riley” (see Chapter 2), the foundational mythology of Chatham as a composer forms around a double epiphany in which he was converted into the identity “minimalist” after hearing Riley, which allowed him to hear the Ramones as minimalist. I say as minimalist in a double sense: that is, both Chatham himself listening as a minimalist, and that he heard the Ramones as fellow minimalists. For Chatham, minimalist had become an identification of an entrained listening positionality.80\n\nThe importance of Chatham’s role as programmer cannot be overstated, even before his compositional career took off. The Kitchen was the central institution for forging, in the early years, what Benjamin Piekut might call an Page 151 →“actually existing” minimalism. While Branden Joseph does not specifically mention it, the “death at BAM” surely implies leaving behind not only private concert venues like Glass’s loft at Chatham Square, but in particular artist-run institutions like the Kitchen where Young, Conrad, Chatham, Spiegel, and Palestine performed under Chatham’s direction, while Reich workshopped his Music for 21 Musicians and Singers in May 1975 under Russell’s directorship.81 Chatham’s musical tastes—converted overnight by an encounter with Riley’s repetitive form of composer-performance amid the 60 Hz drone—set the tone for music curation at the Kitchen, and drew together the nascent “minimalist” scene of early 1970s New York. Nevertheless, it is only when his Ramones epiphany truly sets in, and his engagement with volume and electric guitars brings him into contact with the rock scene and colleagues like Glenn Branca, Jules Baptiste, Jeff Lohn, Wharton Tiers, and Robert Longo, that Chatham becomes notable as a composer in his own right, rather than just a precocious young organizer.\n\nBands at Artists Space\n\nIn the 8 May 1978 Village Voice, Robert Christgau’s addition to the “Voice Choices” column was headed “ARTS SPACE NEW WAVE ROCK”:\n\nShowcasing some of the horde of third-generation New York bands to have surfaced recently. Schedule: Terminal and the Communists May 2 (before this issue goes on sale); Theoretical Girls and the Gynecologists May 3; Daily Life and Tone Death May 4; DNA and the Contortions May 5; Mars and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks May 6. Except for the May 6 groups (both of whom have struck me as arty and empty), I like all the bands I’ve seen enough to catch them again, and the word-of-mouth on the others is intriguing. Those who seek finished music should stay away; otherwise, check it out.82\n\nAlongside the poster for the event, whose capitalized heading “BANDS at Artists Space” suggests novelty to hosting rock acts at an art gallery, this announcement garnered excitement in the downtown music and art scene—despite the fact that none of the artists listed on the program had released a record. That Christgau calls the music “third-generation” suggests it is a “third wave,” following on early adopters like Television and Patti Smith, and then the Ramones and Blondie. After the release of Brian Eno’s LP No New York later that year—discussed below—this short-lived third wave Page 152 →took on the nihilistic label “no wave” in subsequent histories of underground and experimental rock. I would like to consider how this scene intersected with minimalism. Perhaps more than the cross-fertilizations of punk as minimalism highlighted by Gendron, no wave gives discursive counterweight to musicological efforts to construct genres as discrete entities beholden to well-defined criteria that always precede their impacts. That is, the image of no wave as a melding of punk and minimalism overdetermines the historical priority of any of those three names.\n\nArtists Space was founded in 1972 by arts administrator Trudi Grace and critic Irving Sandler. Much like the Kitchen a few blocks away—which opened only a few months earlier, and with a similar mandate and funding from the New York State Council on the Arts—Artists Space was founded by artists to support “the needs of artists who were involved in the production and presentation of work outside the context of an existing institutional structure.”83 In this sense, both venues were closely tied to the impulses that developed the loft jazz scene, again in the exact same neighbourhood, as discussed by Michael Heller. Loft jazz and no wave shared very similar musical and institutional origin stories, including developing out of the desolation of downtown New York, and relying on artists’ capacity for self-determination in live-work venues like Ornette Coleman’s Artists House at 131 Prince Street, just around the corner from Artists Space.84\n\nThe 1978 Artists Space festival grew out of a regular event among many of the Buffalo-associated artists now known as the “Pictures” generation—including Robert Longo, a close frequent of Chatham and Branca—who frequently held Battle of the Bands evenings at the loft space owned by Paul McMahon and Nancy Chunn at 135 Grand Street. These battles were “raucous competitions in nonmusician musicianship that made the punk bands of the moment seem like virtuosi.”85 That many of these “bands” featured conservatory-trained musicians and composers from Juilliard or Mills College by no means deterred from the anti-everything aesthetic. Many of the “musicians” involved in the scene were artists from other media, as the gallery’s publicity material for the festival makes clear: “This area of music has lately received much attention by artists, both as listeners and as performers. The series is in keeping with Artists Space policy of presenting what is currently of interest in the art community.”86 Indeed, no wave can most easily be defined as the sonic result of avant-garde theater, performance, and visual artists forming amateurish, antispecialization “punk” bands.\n\nIn his oral history of no wave, Marc Masters describes the indistinction no wave bands produced between artists, artistic media, and output in the Page 153 →downtown scene at the time. Glenn Branca, one of the scene’s early leaders, told Masters:\n\nI wanted to make art, and it was so cool that you could make art in rock clubs. You can’t imagine how exciting that was to people. There was this whole new scene of young visual artists who had grown up listening to rock music, who had come to New York to do visual arts, to do painting, to do conceptual art. And they heard these bands that were clearly coming from the same kind of sensibility, and all they could do was imagine themselves up on that stage playing this fucking art music.87\n\nThe designator art music is surely a careful choice on Branca’s part: he is not referring to “Western art music” but rather to music, made by visual artists, that was one product of their artistic practice. Other no wave musicians have made similar claims. China Burg of Mars says she got into bands because “it’s very up front sleazy. It’s not this world of pretension that the fine arts can be so entrenched in.”88 Pat Place of the Contortions argues that the music scene was “way more exciting to me than what was going on in the art world . . . in performance art and conceptual art.”89 Her bandmate Don Christensen said, “I came to New York basically to be a painter, [but] I got seduced by the CBGB’s scene and meeting musicians and having a good time.”90 Branca later discusses the constitution of audiences: “It was clear there was this audience made up of people just like me[:] they were visual artists or theatre artists or performance artists.”91 The filmmaker James Nares told Masters, “Different disciplines came together. There were filmmakers, artists, musicians, poets, everybody. Everyone seemed to have a common purpose.” In a quote that closely echoes Tony Conrad’s 1965 claim that John Cale was “by night sawmill and by day a frightening rock ‘n’ roll orchestra,”92 Nares continues, “We would be making a racket in a studio one day, and shooting a movie the next.”93 Lydia Lunch of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks agreed: “Everybody was doing everything. You painted, you were in a band, you made films, you wrote songs.”94 For many artists involved at Artists Space, the “band” was a new medium that supplemented film, paint, or theater as a collaborative enterprise for artistic production. Artists thwarted their own training, talent, and expertise in favor of the indistinction between disciplines and media, such that an antivirtuosic antimusic became a form of antiart broadly rather than specifically a musical project.\n\nFollowing on the popularity of this -music among the artists, Artists Page 154 →Space organized the “BANDS at Artists Space” series. The festival’s legendary status results from indirectly producing one of the best-known documents of the period: the Brian Eno–produced LP No New York, which supplemented the record industry-preferred punk label from “new wave” to an anti-institutional and antiart no wave. While the festival featured ten bands, Eno’s LP, released in fall 1978, only included four short songs each by four of the bands—DNA, Mars, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, and Contortions.95 Much debate has circulated as to how the four represented bands were chosen, and has produced particular mystery around the “other” bands—most of whom never even got into the studio. Pitchfork’s review of the 2005 reissue of No New York credits the close interrelationship among the four recorded bands as the principal reason the other artists were left off: “Original DNA member Gordon Stevenson left the band to play bass for Teenage Jesus & the Jerks. DNA’s name came from a song by Mars. Lydia Lunch and James Chance were dating—he quit Teenage Jesus in ’78 to do his own thing. Bands who weren’t as entrenched in the loop—Red Transistor, Static, Theoretical Girls [only the last of whom played the Artists Space festival]—were left off the comp.”96\n\nOther means of introducing distinctions between the bands have been proposed. Bernard Gendron argues that Eno simply dismissed some of the now lesser-known bands because of a distinction that was as much geographic as generic:\n\nBoth [Branca and Chatham] appeared at the original Artists Space festival, Branca with Theoretical Girls and Chatham with the Gynecologists. But from its first days, no wave proved volatile in its designations and divisions. It did not take long for a split to appear between the East Village groups closer to the pop scene at CBGB’s—Teenage Jesus, the Contortions, among others—and the SoHo “art fags,” such as Branca and Chatham. The East Village groups soon were perceived as central to the no wave movement and the SoHo groups only marginal to it. This separation was permanently fixed in 1979 [sic] with the release of the No New York album, that canonical no wave compilation, which only featured the East Village bands.97\n\nSimon Reynolds’s history of postpunk relies on the same practice of division, suggesting that Theoretical Girls and the Gynecologists were left off simply because they were more associated with the SoHo scene.98 Like Strickland making a case for why Young wrote the Theatre of Eternal Music’s drones Page 155 →based on the work that Conrad and Cale would later do (see Chapter 1), Reynolds further bases his argument on proleptical perspective when he argues that Theoretical Girls “boasted no less than two composers in its lineup, Glenn Branca and Jeffrey Lohn.” To suggest that Theoretical Girls was excluded from the collection because Branca was a composer is to proleptically introduce divisions between the scene that did not necessarily exist at the time. It is to use the results of that scene as evidence of its formation. It is only as a result of the Artists Space festival and the indistinct interrelation of various “minimalisms” in downtown New York that Branca was ever able to become a “composer,” a claim that I will elaborate upon in the next section. In all cases, the distinction between composers and bands, or composer-led bands and “actual” collective bands, plays a key sense in how the scene is retroactively cut up into distinct camps.\n\nPerhaps the most startling absence in these readings is that Branca and Chatham were not only in the 3 May groups, Theoretical Girls and the Gynecologists. They both also performed on 4 May, Branca alongside Barbara Ess, Paul McMahon, and Christine Hahn as a guitarist in Daily Life, while Chatham performed a version of his Guitar Trio as Tone Death. Branca and Chatham were thus members of four of the ten bands, though none of them made it onto No New York.\n\nMany of these groups ended up being very short-lived. Existing writing tends to accredit this to the no wavers being particularly “volatile,” thus mapping a biographical parallel onto the austere sound. But I think something less contentious is in play: these groups were never formalized bands in the first place. The band names were a means of positioning this music as an art project, perhaps turning each composition or compositional style into a stable political formation. Accordingly, the Static and Daily Life are largely the same people, performing under different concepts; the same is true of Tone Death and the Gynecologists. They can perhaps be more likened to the title of an art show or museum event—they form, draw work and artists together, take a name, and are gone again. But presenting this music as performances by bands, regardless of how contingent or momentary, and in rock music spaces, was central to the material practice of no wave and, by extension, Branca’s and Chatham’s early careers. Taking a name was perhaps the fundamental performative gesture here as a means of playing with genre, authorship, and audience expectation. In doing so, Branca, Chatham, and their friends and collaborators marked indistinct slippages between proper and collective authorial names.\n\nLooking at contemporary reviews of the festival from the New York Times Page 156 →will help clarify the actual position of these artists at the time. Much like his British colleagues discussed above, Rockwell distinguishes New York’s “underground” scene from the one in London, insisting that the former involves “a more deliberate attempt to create art out of rock, a closer connection between young rocksters and experimental artists.”99 Most importantly, he writes, “Sometimes the bands are ones that have also played the C.B.G.B./Max’s circuit . . . sometimes they are more obviously experimental. . . . But usually—and here’s where things get really interesting . . .—you can’t tell the difference.”100 Rockwell lists the bands involved in the festival without interpellating individual “composers” out from the band of which they are members, though he does mention that “like all such groups their memberships appear to be in a constant state of flux.” Turning to the keyword throughout all of this, Rockwell describes Mars as performing a “tightly controlled and generally interesting brand of minimal rock” and Teenage Jesus and the Jerks as “content[ing] themselves with minimalist instrumentals.” He closes by warning—against all contemporary perspective on how shocking no wave was in its time—that the “minimalism . . . of both bands suggest[s] that the whole New York underground scene is in danger of falling into a new orthodoxy as rigid as anything that may have preceded it.” It is quite clear that Rockwell is not referring to Reich and Glass, and that no contemporary reader would make that mistake. Perhaps more importantly, when he needs a catchword for stagnant, downtown orthodoxy, minimalism is the clear choice.\n\nA longer piece in the 2 June Times developed many of these ideas. First discussing the several years of “rock-art” that had come out of British “art-school graduates” and progressive rockers, Rockwell searches for yet another means of distinguishing these acts from bands like the Velvet Underground, Patti Smith, Television, and Talking Heads—all performers central to the punk aesthetic that Lester Bangs and others were outlining: “Rock has always been a populist medium, and that populism has tended to express itself in commercial terms. . . . [But] today there is a whole crop of bands in New York that either have no pretensions whatsoever to commercial success or, if they do, are operating in a realm of total delusion.”101 For Rockwell, the distinction between rock and art has always been that rock is inherently populist—“commerciality incarnate”; now that there are bands about whom this decidedly cannot be argued, he seems to be asking, how are we to redraw distinctions? Again, indistinction is the principle in play, rather than a problem to be sorted out: this indistinct experimental sensibility is a result of avant-garde artists from painting, theater, performance art, film, and sculpture pervading what would have (or should have) simply been another Page 157 →“rock” scene. That the noisy music made by these bands can be heard as “rock” is every bit as conflicted as is the capacity to hear it as “art.” After noting that “Mr. Eno is now producing a documentary collection of some of these bands,” Rockwell introduces the ones he considered notable: “These bands go by such as names as Theoretical Girls, Tone Deaf, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars, D.N.A., the Contortions and many more.” They not only perform at “such punk haunts as Max’s Kansas City or CBGB’s” but also at venues typically set up for “experimental ‘classical’ music, loft jazz, performance art or video,” including Artists Space and the Kitchen, which have been offering “rock nights more and more often” (under Chatham’s second stint as director, post-Ramones epiphany).102 The distinction, it seems, between rock and art, or between pop and experimentalism, has been minimized so far as to raise questions about the very terms of that distinction. Critics and historians too often take it as their job to articulate new lines of fracture.\n\nIn reviewing the Artists Space festival, Rockwell does not single out Branca by name from Theoretical Girls (as any author writing after the fact would), though he does write that “Rhys Chatham, who’s the Kitchen’s music director and a long-time SoHo composer, is in Tone Deaf.” Returning to the art-pop binary still in place, and capturing a strong contemporary definition of no wave, Rockwell writes:\n\nThis sort of rock is itself so uncommercial that even most rock fans would be confused by it. . . . Much of the music of this sort carried the notion of minimalism to new extremes. A few lonely chords are pummelled away with furious strumming while a drummer pounds out a repetitive beat with merciless, humorless insistence. Tuning seems to strike most of these bands as a silly frill, and the vocals are generally toneless screams. But amid the silly posturing some fascinating ideas can emerge. Theoretical Girls got into some unusual shifting planes of instrumental color at the Kitchen, balancing gritty blocks of aural texture in an eerie, affecting way.103\n\nAllow me to draw out several key features of these reviews. First, Branca is not mentioned at all by name, though Theoretical Girls is clearly the band that most caught Rockwell’s attention; Chatham is the only individual interpellated from any of the ensembles, and there only as a potentially valuable contextualizing name among readers of the Times. Second, commentary on the music focuses on specifically the lesser-known bands from these performances: Rockwell is not interested in discussing James Chance’s infamous Page 158 →mischief (including getting into a fistfight with Voice critic Robert Christgau at the festival—the other major reason why the Artists Space festival makes it into most histories of punk), but rather focuses on Theoretical Girls’ “unusual shifting planes of instrumental color” and Nina Canal (of Gynecologists and Tone Death, and soon to be in the all-woman band Ut) who “came on stage with a little girl and sang duets with her to a half-rock, half-harmonium accompaniment that was very beautiful. But also very, very far from the commercial arena.”\n\nThese performances—and no wave as a genre—introduce an important disruption into the musical discourse of “minimalism” in late-1970s New York experimentalism. In writing that the no wave groups “take the notion of minimalism to a new extreme,” it’s impossible to tell whether Rockwell is referencing the concerts by Talking Heads and the Ramones at CBGB, Reich at Carnegie Hall, or Arthur Russell, Tony Conrad, and Charlemagne Palestine at the Kitchen. It is in these moments that homonymy carries its most important historiographic impact. Anyone reading this review might be inclined to suspect that the minimalism taken to new extremes is that of Reich, Glass, Young, or Conrad. But we have little reason to suspect that—or at least absolutely no reason to prioritize that assumption over the belief that he was referring to the Ramones or Talking Heads.\n\nIndeed, Rockwell reviewed Philip Glass’s first concert (“At Last”) at Carnegie Hall that same month; Robert Palmer wrote in a preview of that concert that Glass’s music has been called “solid state, minimalism, [and] trance music.” He continues, “The aesthetic of minimalism, repetition, and structural lucidity is now an important aspect of the punk and new-wave movements in rock,” as evidenced by the fact that Glass had recently been seen hanging out with Brian Eno at CBGB.104 Nevertheless, when Rockwell reviewed Glass’s concert—his second article in the 2 June 1978 issue, along with the above “The Rock World and the Visual Arts,” in which he described so many of the Artists Space bands as minimalists—he did not describe Glass or his music as “minimal,” highlighting instead a disappointing shift uptown as Glass hired professional singers, unamplified, and turned his own electric organ way down: “The result was extremely quiet for a Glass piece” and, to someone who had followed Glass’s small space ensemble development of Music in 12 Parts and other pieces, “a little disconcerting.”105 (The review reveals the drastic changes in taste that the minimalist aesthetic effected over the course of the decade; in a 21 February 1973 review of a Glass concert at the Kitchen, Rockwell opined that Glass had his “Music for Voices” performed by the Mabou Mines dance troupe—“it would be interesting to hear it sometimePage 159 → with a trained choral ensemble.”106 By contrast, in 1978, he writes that “the Smith Singers supplied a nicely full-bodied choral sound, but it can’t be said that they were all that radically superior to the dancer-singer-actors of the original cast.”107)\n\nNo matter which idea of “minimalism” Rockwell had in mind when he claimed that it had been taken to a new extreme (Ramones? Reich?), the central fact stands: the howls, yelps, incessant detuned strumming, and neurotic percussion of the Artists Space bands had produced a new extreme of how “minimal” music could be—both in material and in authorial intervention. No wonder that, in the New York press of 1978 or 1981, it became difficult to call a European orchestral commission by Reich or a concert by Glass at Carnegie Hall “minimal.” And no wonder those composers were rejecting that label for their own work.\n\nGlenn Branca, Illiterate Symphonist\n\nChatham’s role within the downtown scene is already visible by 1971 and 1972, when all of the canonic early minimalists were still working together to varying degrees in collaborative agreement. His eventual collaborator and friend Glenn Branca only arrived in New York several years later, transplanted from Boston, where he had founded the Bastard Theatre. The two quickly became close collaborators. Like La Monte Young, Branca was rather secretive about his career and personal life, rarely granting interviews or sharing archival documents with researchers. Branca died of throat cancer in 2018; in the months prior, he sold a number of signed posters on eBay that provide a glimpse at the chronology of events in which Branca and Chatham performed side by side. There was a concert held at the Kitchen a few weeks before the Artists Space festival featuring two bands each with Branca and Chatham: Daily Life and Theoretical Girls for Branca, the Gynecologists and Arsenal for Chatham (9 April 1978); there was an early Static concert on 13 June 1978 that featured Branca’s Instrumental for Six Guitars (though the poster does not specify that it is his own composition) and probably included Chatham as one of the guitarists; a 29 January 1979 show at Hurrah’s featured both Branca (backed by Anthony Coleman, Mike Gross, Frank Shroder, and Stephen Wischerth) and Chatham (with Jules Baptiste, Robert Longo, and Wharton Tiers) listed by name as composers. Some external evidence comes from a scanned page from the 1979 itinerary of the booker at Tier 3, which shows Branca penned in for 5 December and Chatham for 6 December.108 Further, for Branca’s first solo gig—at the Kitchen, discussed below—in JanuaryPage 160 → 1980, the program claims that Chatham played guitar in Instrumental for Six Guitars, and existing recordings and commentary from both suggest that Branca performed frequently in Chatham’s Guitar Trio.109\n\nMy major concern in this section is to argue, simply by accumulation, against the model of hybridity often relied on in discussing these artists. Branca’s and Chatham’s collaborations reveal a close blurring between the worlds of no wave and new music composition, often again falling under the label minimalism or, at times, “minimal rock”—a label John Rockwell in particular used during the late 1970s to label performances like theirs. Reviews take on the form of comparison between Branca and Chatham as composers, as critics insisted on articulating a distinction between the two, always grounded in reference to their backgrounds: Chatham the former serialist, Branca the long-standing punk. In particular, I am opposed to the discourses of “accreditation” relied on by both contemporary critics like John Rockwell and later historians like Bernard Gendron, in which it is assumed that individuals can only reproduce the conditions of their background.110 Instead of arguing that Branca and Chatham are different in their very similar music because Chatham is at heart a classicist and Branca is at heart a rocker, I think it necessary to consider the larger network within which this distinction is articulated. That is, what about their scene has made it possible for these crossovers to occur so easily, so discretely, and so indistinctly as to keep critics on their toes in feeling the need to articulate a distinction for them? Reading reviews of concerts that they were both involved in further develops my claim about the indistinction developing between composer and band following the Artists Space festival. I lastly present reviews of Branca’s early symphonies in the New York press, as critics began to regularly label Branca the hero of the downtown scene, and even the greatest composer living—despite the fact that he was musically illiterate and did not write traditional scores for his ensemble.\n\nOf course Chatham is a classicist who studied serialism as a teen, tuned pianos, and so on before turning to the Ramones and loud guitars; of course Branca cannot write music. These are differences, and I do not aim to efface or deny them. My argument is more mundane: that these background distinctions cannot be the focal point for all analysis, and that perhaps in making them such, we have long missed something far more fundamental and interesting about this scene and Branca and Chatham as only two actors within it. Rather than considering this a chiastic, dual process of accreditation, of world-crossing and hybridity, we should perhaps consider something both simpler and more theoretically interesting: under the label minimalism, Page 161 →a composer could form a punk band, and a theater artist could become a prominent symphonist. It is not that either crossed from one discrete camp to another; rather, it is that this minimalist scene, in this place at this time, had created such indistinction and dislocation that there was barely a gap to cross. Arguments grounded in preexisting domains subsequently hybridized rely on the same ahistorical reifications as does examining the era prior to authorial disputes as if the collaborators are always necessarily on a collision course with proprietary battles. These modes of prolepsis are absolutely standard when historiography begins from searching out causes that will rationalize effects.\n\nJohn Rockwell’s June 1979 review of a no wave concert outlines the indistinction between composer and band that the word “minimal” was used to mark at the time.111 In “Rock: 2 of the No-Wave,” Rockwell writes that the scene had moved on from lofts and art galleries to assert itself in the same venues that “spawned the new-wave [punk] scene of just a few years ago.” The titular use of the label “no wave” implies a balance between two political formations: there is the impulse toward the tradition of art music, of sole authors, with recognition that they are attempting to present their work under collective names; and there is the simultaneous observation that these performances are noisy, distorted, and performed on electronic instruments by bands well versed in and more associated with rock music. While Chatham was performing under his most recent band name, Melt Down, and Robin Crutchfield (formerly of DNA) with Dark Days—recall that “these ensembles tend to exchange members from gig to gig”—Rockwell presents the proper names Chatham and Crutchfield as those of composers, and the pieces they performed were read as works: “Mr. Chatham’s first effort Tuesday was the same piece he’d done at the Kitchen festival of new music recently: one chord strummed in a rhythmic ostinato with light percussive accompaniment, illustrated by Robert Longo’s handsome slides.” “Minimal” comes up repeatedly, objectifying this indistinction between composers within bands, or bands formed by composers: “It’s easy to mock the no-wavers, who reduce rock to such minimalism that to some it might seem there’s nothing there at all. But minimal painting can look simple, too, and at its best no-wave rock focuses the issues of musical creation and perception in a remarkable way.”112\n\nThe recent “Kitchen Festival of new music” Rockwell references was New Music, New York, which subsequently toured for years as New Music America, becoming one of the dominant forums for 1980s American experimentalism. The biggest names at New Music, New York were surely Glass and Reich, but it also featured major downtowners like Tony Conrad, Meredith Monk, Page 162 →Garrett List, Jill Kroesen, Tom Johnson, George Lewis, Laurie Spiegel, Jon Gibson, Charlemagne Palestine, Annea Lockwood, Gordon Mumma, and Barbara Benary. In his review of the festival, Rockwell singled out Phill Niblock, Charles Dodge, David Behrman, Rhys Chatham, Frankie Mann, and Laurie Anderson.113 While many of the New Music, New York artists might today be at least peripherally labeled “minimalists,” the term barely comes up in the article. Niblock’s piece “sounded like the inside of some cosmic organ”; Behrman’s “blended humanism and electronics in a specially charming way”; Anderson “confirmed her status as about the most charismatic performance artist we have who uses sound extensively.” In fact, the only appearance of the term “minimal” is in reference to Chatham, who “did a minimal-rock piece that really fused those tendencies superbly.”114 Chatham’s performance—of Guitar Trio, which he performed extensively throughout 1977–1979 with bands including Tone Death at Artists Space—occurred on the final night of the festival, 16 June, alongside pieces by Anderson, Gordon, Lohn, Mann, and Ned Sublette. While Branca was not included as a composer in the festival—why would he have been?—he was a member of the band Lohn formed for the evening, alongside Wharton Tiers, Margaret Dewys (already performing their own shows as the Static), Julius Eastman, and Scott Johnson.\n\nThe distinction between Glenn Branca, the composer, and the Static, the band, was still lost on Tom Johnson in a review of the Static’s first seven-inch record in September 1979. While he writes that the new band is “an experimental rock trio headed by Glenn Branca,” he does not explicitly hear the music as Branca’s writing, though he does provide the first accurate description of what is now Branca’s well-known compositional style: The band’s song “‘My Relationship’ revolves around a curious kind of chord change. The two guitars alternate between a unison and a two-note cluster, while the drummer pounds out a beat that is extremely insistent, even for rock. The song isn’t all that ‘static.’ In fact, it changes tempo once and even builds to a climax before its three minutes are over.”115 In that Johnson’s review recognizes the group as “headed by” Branca, but still hears the music as by the Static, it differs sharply from Rockwell’s review of the Dark Days and Melt Down concert. A few weeks later, Rockwell wrote about an evening of short pieces by “emerging composers” on the SoHo scene at the Kitchen; he bemoans its quality: while “two or three top-notch successes can redeem a concert like this . . . only one piece had much luck.” Branca’s “limply titled ‘Untitled’” was “another of the minimal-rock efforts the Kitchen likes to present” and “made one want to hear more of Mr. Branca’s music.”116\n\nPage 163 →Later in November, the magazine New York Rocker published an essay by Branca on his colleague Rhys Chatham. Branca wrote the single-page piece from a dual position of upholding Chatham’s academic pedigree while pushing for his recognition as a rocker in his own right by the magazine’s dominant audience. “Over the past two years,” Branca writes, “Rhys Chatham has been performing ‘Guitar Trio’ in clubs, galleries and new music spaces around New York under the successive names Tone Death, Meltdown, and New Americans.” Branca continues, “The piece has varied in length from six or seven minutes to thirty minutes, and has undergone many changes of personnel and instrumentation. At the Mudd Club, Rhys added two trombones; at Hurrah, three percussionists, bass, and twelve-string guitar; at the Kitchen, a full orchestra. But the standard set-up is three six-string guitars and drums.” Whether this is true—I have come across no mention of a full orchestra performing Guitar Trio—is less relevant than the rhetorical position Branca takes on the music. “Although this music can certainly be seen as innovative or modern, the final effect is still that of vicious, uncompromising rock music. This is what [Lou Reed’s] Metal Machine Music should have sounded like.”117 Branca’s appraisal is clearly aimed at pointing out Guitar Trio’s capacity for wide programming at punk clubs (Hurrah’s), art discos (the Mudd Club), and avant-garde spaces (the Kitchen), and simultaneously questioning the grounds upon which such distinctions are made.\n\nWhile Branca was attempting to offer his colleague the punk rock credibility he needed, he was eager in his own right to be seen as a composer. Greg Sandow wrote several reviews in 1980–1981 that aimed to distinguish between the styles of Branca and Chatham. Two months after the piece was published, Branca’s first solo concert took place at the Kitchen in January 1980 (Figure 14), before touring to other venues including Hallwalls Gallery in Buffalo. In contrast to his work with the Static, the program featured pieces titled so “limply” as to assure audiences of their artful nature and not risk a possible misunderstanding as popular music: (Instrumental) for Six Guitars, Nos. 1, 2, and 3 from 5 Lessons for Electric Guitar, and (Untitled) 1979. Sandow’s review combined Branca’s 16 January Kitchen concert with performances by Rhys Chatham at the Mudd Club on 10 January and Hurrah’s on 29 January.118 The review is titled “Classical Music for Loud Guitars,” and headed by a Deborah Feingold photo of Branca and Chatham in front of a graffiti-covered wall (Figure 15). “Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham write some of the most challenging classical music in town,” Sandow writes, before adding dubiously, “for their rock bands.” Where Chatham’s classical background holds him to a “rapt and impassive” performance style, “the members Page 164 →of his band (Jules Baptiste, Robert Longo, and Wharton Tiers) . . . thrash at their instruments more wildly.”119 In contrast, Branca is compared to Reich and Glass, though Sandow is concerned about the limits imposed by his musical illiteracy: “Sometimes Branca’s musical structure is a little rough. . . . Chatham is the only member of either band who reads music; the complicated scores have to be notated informally and taught to the players by rote.” He closes this review by noting that while “Chatham . . . has made a conscious effort to become a rocker . . . Branca . . . [has] always been involved in rock.” The comparisons continue in a 17 September review. There Sandow writes of being that he was surprised to see people dancing, and decided “that Chatham’s stuff might be rock after all,” before Chatham, “stung, perhaps, by put-downs from rock critics . . . decided that his music . . . is really, at heart, classical.” Branca, on the other hand, surprised Sandow with a newly updated version of Lesson No. 1 that leads him to describe as “frighteningly good, one of the best composers alive.”120\n\nOn 17 April 1981 at the Kitchen, Chatham put on a concert titled “Drastic Classical Music for Electric Instruments.” Sandow reviewed the performance a few weeks later as a case study in the relationship between the new music scene and academicism.121 Sandow uses Chatham’s concert to argue for the strength of the rock/classical hybrid in the downtown scene and as particularly exemplified by Chatham: “Rhys Chatham’s music is too loud and too exciting to be academic. The excitement’s partly physical—from high volume and a rock and roll beat—and partly intellectual.” While some find it “brash and punky,” Sandow hears it as “severe and classical.”122 Alongside “Glenn Branca, Peter Gordon, [and] the members of DNA,” Sandow argues that Chatham “is writing the newest new music around,” and that it is “aggressive and triumphant” in the face of the “older new music” (the reference is clearly to minimalism), which is “often soft, playful, or meditative.” In the two Sandow essays and Rockwell’s “no wave” review, we see much the same: critics attempting to sort, amid a number of concerts in 1980 and 1981, the distinction between minimalism in rock, in “classical” music, and the terms of any minimal-rock hybrid.\n\nSandow was right in his prediction about the shock Branca’s music would provide for the new music scene as he settled into his role of—rather traditional—composer. Between 1981 and 1983, Branca composed and performed his first three symphonies: Symphony No. 1 (Tonal Plexus) (1981), Symphony No. 2 (The Peak of the Sacred) (1982), and Symphony No. 3 (Gloria): Music for the first 127 intervals of the harmonic series (1983). While Kyle Gann has suggested that critics were bothered by Branca’s pretension in labeling the Page 166 →pieces “symphonies,”123 major paper critics like Rockwell and Sandow who had been following Branca’s career had little issue with the change and, other than criticizing Branca’s understanding of large-scale form or notation—and thus labeling him a “primitive” directly or opaquely—were excited by the quick rush of work. In the first review of one of the symphonies, John Rockwell calls the work “ambitiously entitled,” before conceding that Branca is no exception among the long line of “composers [who] have been violating the orthodox symphonic form for 150 years now.”124 Rockwell is simultaneously untroubled by including the work within the symphonic tradition and, what’s more, considers it “the acme of what recent New York art-rockers have yet accomplished.” Only eighteen months into the decade, Rockwell concludes by claiming that Branca has “the talent, organizational skills and charisma to establish himself as the glamorous leader of the lower Manhattan experimental scene of the 80’s.”125\n\nFollow for extended description\n\nIn May 1982, the Times assigned the review of Branca’s second symphony to its chief rock critic, Robert Palmer.126 Perhaps caught on the work’s subtitle, The Peak of the Sacred, Palmer notes that Branca’s “transcendentalist Page 167 →strain,” which goes “back through La Monte Young to Ives, Ruggles, and other American tinkerers,” is brought “into the foreground” in the second symphony.127 Immediately after praising the work for being more “rapturously lyrical and hymnlike than much of the Symphony No. 1,” Palmer nevertheless argues that “Mr. Branca is running short of ideas. There was little in Symphony No. 2 . . . that one hadn’t heard in his earlier pieces.” He continues, turning to the primitivist line, “Mr. Branca may eventually have to learn more about conventional music notation in order to avoid painting himself into a corner.” The article then suddenly changes on a dime:\n\nBut what a corner! The sound of all those guitars, overtones bouncing around the room, sonic masses forming and dissolving like curtains of rain, is still utterly invigorating. And Mr. Branca has made remarkable strides in his ability to control dynamics, foreground-background relationship, and other fine-tuning aspects of his presentation. He is an inspired American original, and one can imagine him winning a sizable nationwide audience in the months and years to come.128\n\nThe tone is distinct from the preview of the second symphony that Rockwell wrote a week earlier, in which he praised Branca’s “music of massive sonic grandeur.”129 Like every one of these articles, Rockwell raises for the reader the problem of placing Branca within a genre: “What . . . are we to make of Glenn Branca? . . . Whether this is ‘serious’ or classical or rock or all three, Mr. Branca is the leader of the most vital new trend to transform downtown new music since the minimalists.” Rockwell disagrees with Branca’s contention that “there’s no adherence to any kind of classical structure,” writing, “while there is no sonata-form, there is certainly the sectional juxtaposition of contrasting moods that characterizes the modern, post-Mahler symphony.” Despite Gann’s claims (which are likely true in some other contemporary publications), Rockwell, as at least one major critic, was perhaps even more defensive of the use of the term “symphony” than the self-conscious Branca in the early years, arguing for its consistency with historical application. Nevertheless, Rockwell asserts that Branca’s “development might seem to be impeded by his inability to read music with any fluency”; while his music is written down, it is “in a kind of shorthand that does not correspond to conventional notation.” Branca is thus “a prime example of the postliterate avant-gardism that has sprung up in the electronic era—an era in which the recording studio and electronics provide the ‘permanent’ documentation that written notation used to provide.”130 For both Palmer and Rockwell, Branca Page 168 →is not a minor character on the downtown scene: he is the best composer living and primed to be the “leader” of the experimental 1980s, continuing the legacy of the composers who can now be labeled without qualification “the minimalists.”131 Perhaps most importantly, in the wake of those minimalists, it is now possible for an illiterate composer to create transcendent, important work by writing purely to electronic media rather than staff paper. This situation would have been unthinkable two decades earlier and, importantly, has remained so within prominent didactic music histories, where the existence of scores remains a primary boundary to mark inclusion/exclusion within a teachable canon.132\n\nThat Johnson, Rockwell, Sandow, and others were so closely tracking genre shifts among Chatham, Branca and others at the Kitchen (often as “minimalists” or “rock-minimalists”) at the exact moment that the national “middlebrow” press defined minimalism for readers as a style without adequate label, is revealing of those major publications’ interest. Of course, for Time or High Fidelity, the goal is to present their readers with up-to-date information on trends moving out of the vanguard and into mainstream acceptance; rather than following an aesthetic into the run-down lofts and art galleries of late-1970s SoHo, they turn the best-known and most successful members of that style into representatives and spokesmen of that aesthetic. That tracking the style in its early development is beyond the scope of Time is of course not news to any historian of an avant-garde. Indeed, by definition, the appearance in middlebrow press is typically taken as a sign of that vanguard’s death, which is of course what many (including those magazines) proclaimed. Perhaps the death of minimalism is the necessary criterion for its public emergence as Minimalism. As Kristin Ross has argued, this sort of turn to spokesmen from within a pluralist and vibrant movement is a “tried and true tactic of confiscation” of a political message; it is even more helpful in dismissing an effective critique if those spokesmen are listened to primarily for their “trumpeted renunciations.”133\n\nIn contrast to following the big names, pursuing “actually existing minimalism” as evident in an event like the Artists Space festival reveals the multiple paths that a musician within the late-1970s downtown scene could follow. For Chatham, it was an entry into the punk scene authorized by the connection Branca forged between Guitar Trio and Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music; for Branca, the formation of Static allowed enough indistinction between his “limply titled” minimalist works and his rock songs to allow him to slide into the role of “composer” of transcendental symphonies. These two cases raise important issues of generic and biographical constraints: Are Page 169 →we to consider Chatham as having successfully become a punk? Or is he forever stuck in the position of a serialist aiming to escape the status of poseur? In contrast, is Branca—perhaps one of the most prolific contemporary symphonists—a “composer” or a “rocker”? As Rockwell wrote in his early review of no wave, it doesn’t matter. The distinction between composer and band had been so minimized by the time of the Artists Space festival as to be irrelevant. These artists were inhabiting that minimal gap, that buzzing indistinction, though critics and historians rely on methods that widen it and recreate distant binaries. After a decade of composer-performers leading their own ensembles, focusing on in-rehearsal development and recordings rather than scores, and playing in lofts and art galleries rather than concert halls, it had become entirely possible for Glenn Branca, the illiterate symphonist, to be proposed as the uncontested leader of the downtown compositional vanguard. It had simultaneously become unclear to critics how to position this music generically for their readers. When bands are in artists’ spaces, composers are performing in clubs, jazz musicians are in live-work lofts, and so on, critics and audiences have been deprived of the clear, institutional boundaries that define genre at least in part by venue, concert etiquette, audience makeup, and record label affiliations. To follow Kristin Ross’s description of May ’68, perhaps downtown experimentalism, too, was a crisis of functionalism produced by physical dislocation. To begin from putting participants back “where they belong” is not only to undervalue the shift"
