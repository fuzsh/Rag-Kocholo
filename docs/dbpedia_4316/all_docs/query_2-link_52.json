Cuyler Endowment, seeks to assist with some expenses graduate students incur when they deliver papers at academic conferences sponsored by scholarly societies. Endowment support is only available in support of reading a formal conference paper; it is not available to support service on panels, committees, workshops, and other such functions.\n\nTop funding priority will be assigned to papers presented at either international or national conferences. The definition of “national” is interpreted broadly, and certainly includes the annual meetings of the American Musicological Society, the Society for Ethnomusicology, and the Society for American Music. Applications for travel funding to present papers at regional conferences (such as a chapter meeting of a national society) are also encouraged. Please address questions concerning other conferences to the department chair, who will bring them to the department for consideration prior to application.\n\nAlong with an application form, please submit to the department chair the abstract submitted to the conference; a copy of the letter or email accepting the paper; and a proposed budget, estimating as precisely as possible the costs of conference registration, travel, and lodging. The Award does not cover meals. The faculty will review application materials on a revolving basis throughout the academic year. Preference will be given to applicants who also document requests for matching funds from other University sources. Please apply for funds after acceptance of the abstract but before the trip; please retain all receipts, which must be submitted within 3 weeks of travel (even in the summer).\n\nThe Glenn McGeoch Memorial Scholarship in Musicology was endowed in 1989 by his family, former colleagues, and students to provide scholarship assistance to graduate students in Musicology. In 2014, the McGeoch endowment expanded from a single annual scholarship to two distinct scholarships given each academic year. One scholarship is given annually to an outstanding graduate student instructor of SMTD music majors; the other scholarship is given annually to an outstanding graduate student instructor of non-majors. No applications are required. Previous recipients of a McGeogh scholarship are not eligible to receive the award a second time. The faculty will choose the scholarship recipients at the end of each school year.\n\nPast Recipients\n\n’23-’24 Emma Beachy (majors); Ingrid Racine (non-majors)\n\n’22-’23 Sunhong Kim (majors); Clay Conley (non-majors)\n\n’21-’22 Piper Foulon (majors); Cody Jones (non-majors)\n\n’20-’21 Joshua Kerobo (majors); Alyssa Wells (non-majors)\n\n’19-’20: Chuyi Zhu and Michaela Franzen (majors); Kai West (non-majors)\n\n’18-’19: Richard Smith (majors); Casper Chan (non-majors)\n\n’17-’18: Lena Leson (majors); Anne Heminger (non-majors)\n\n’16-’17: Lisa Decenteceo (majors); Conner Vanderbeek (non-majors)\n\n’15-’16: Megan Hill (majors); Austin Stewart (non-majors)\n\n’14-’15: Mishona Collier (majors); Kristen Clough (non-majors)\n\n’13-’14: Jessica Grimmer\n\n’12-’13: Sarah Suhadolnik\n\n’11-’12: Meredith Juergens\n\n’10-’11: J.
