        "text": "Josh Goldberg, one third of Chapman Stick Supergroup, GEPH, has branched out on his own. I have a soft spot for Josh and his music, his first solo album, albeit behind the facade of The Afro Circus, Journey To The Centre Of The Ear was my “audition spot” for TPA.\n\nAm I Cool yet? is again using a pen name – Tap Theory. In his collaborative work Josh Goldberg does a lot of progressive, jazzy, rocky “fusion” instrumental stuff. For the first time, as far as I’m aware, we hear Josh add vocals to his work. This is a brave step and he pulls it off brilliantly with honest, unpretentious singing and carefully constructed harmonies. These are pop songs and purely as a frame of reference, I’d pop them in the same box as Talking Heads or Brian Eno’s early solo stuff.\n\nThe harmonies and melody on My Best Life are uplifting and just made me smile. Social awkwardness, the desire to be loved, getting old, every one of these songs made me smile to myself, whatever Josh intended. Whatever the lyrical content, I just like the sound of it.\n\nIf you want to hear straight-forward, melodic songs that appear to speak from the artist’s heart and that you can identify with, yet without even the tiniest hint of hipsterism, then this is for you.\n\nForgas Band Phenomena – L’Oreille Électrique\n\nRoger Trenwith\n\nJack O’The Clock – Repetitions Of The Old City – II\n\nPhil Lively\n\nPaola Tagliaferro – Fabulae\n\nKevan Furbank\n\nOak – False Memory Archive\n\nPhil Lively\n\nArabs in Aspic – Live at Avantgarden\n\nJohn Wenlock-Smith\n\nLazuli – Saison 8\n\nJez Rowden\n\nJo Quail – Exsolve\n\nLeo Trimming\n\nEl Tubo Elastico – Impala\n\nMel Allen\n\nJamie Saft Quartet – Blue Dream\n\nShawn Dudley"
