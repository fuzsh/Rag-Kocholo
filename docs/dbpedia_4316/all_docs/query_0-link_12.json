        "text": "Julio Arce – Celsa Alonso, From the Chotis to the Charleston: Jazz in Spanish Films prior to the Civil War The arrival of jazz in Spain contributed to modify some customs and forms of leisure in the process of modernisation of the country. Jazz was not just to listen, enjoy and dance, it was also to watch, becoming a powerful iconographic theme. This explains the presence of jazz in silent film. Until well into the 1920s, filmmakers in Spain initiated a hard-fought battle with popular musical theatre, particularly zarzuela (Spanish operetta), that showed a great capacity to absorb and disseminate foreign musical fads, including jazz music, sharing the stage with cuplés, zambras, tangos, flamenco, chotis and pasodobles. The presence of jazz rhythms (providing a visual landscape through dance) along with native music made the assimilation of jazz more natural. After the arrival of sound films, Spanish Republican cinema continued with the popular genres of the previous decade, including adaptations of zarzuelas and folkloric musicals. However, comedies and musical comedies with an American taste were also very successful, articulating discourses of modernity and cosmopolitanism. As in the 1920s, modernity could and should coexist with traditional elements of Spanish popular culture, which explains the relevance of popular music in films, from copla to jazz. Famous theatre and zarzuela composers ( Jacinto Guerrero and Francisco Alonso) or jazz musicians such as Daniel Montorio became film composers, while jazz found an appropriate place in Spanish comedy.\n\n3. FRIDAY, MAY 29, 1:30 – 3:00. Room 303. Lisa Scoggin, freelance musicologist FROM STAGE TO SCREEN: THE EFFECTS OF HOLLYWOOD ADAPTATION ON STEPHEN SONDHEIM’S SWEENEY TODD Stephen Sondheim’s musical Sweeney Todd (1979) has achieved critical success from its inception as well as enough popular success to be revived several times both in New York and London, reorchestrated so that the actors also serve as the pit orchestra, and, most recently, made into a movie directed by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. In this paper, I will examine how the various musical changes in Tim Burton’s version from the original Broadway play affect the scope, focus, and meaning of the work. First, using information from authors such as Steve Swayne, Stephen Banfield, Joanne Gordon, and Jim Lovensheimer, as well as interviews with Stephen Sondheim, I will describe the role that music has in the play, concentrating on its influence on the psychological aspects and the setting and scale of the work. Afte...\n\nOnce mostly considered a commercial composer and a mere rewriter of previous composers’ styles, only recently Williams’ music has begun to be taken seriously, and scholars from the music and the film departments have begun to produce research in the form of books, journal articles, conference papers, and Ph.D. theses. The present volume seeks to build upon, complement and review what has been written so far on Williams. This volume is a large exploration of the many sides of Williams's output, aimed at showing the range of his production (not merely focussing on film music) and at analysing the depth of his dramaturgic and compositional skills with selected case studies. To accomplish this exploration – which has not the pretence of exhaustiveness but certainly that of being an accurate survey possessing both latitude and depth – a large team of international scholars has been assembled from all around the world. The contributors come from film and music departments, to provide a variety of disciplinary perspectives on Williams's work.\n\nFor several years audiovisual analysis has been a growth area in musicology and cultural studies. And yet, very little has been published that recognises its relevance to a wide range of practices, including music videos, film and television music, video art, and gaming music. A thread that runs through the chapters is the recognition of audiovisual performance as a central theoretical category. The focus of the essays is exclusively contemporary. In this way, the book addresses a cluster of concerns that pertain to audiovisual production, performance and consumption in a variety of present day contexts. Chapters are organised thematically around the headings Avant-garde aesthetics, Re-sounding soundtracks, Televisual intertexts, Interrogating the mainstream, and Personal politics and embodied performance. What we attempt to put forward in this book is not a solution to the analysis of sound and vision, but rather, a list of possibilities and approaches through which interpretation can be undertaken. Thus, the essays collected provide critical readings through which the authors provide answers to questions, such as what is the relationship between sound and vision? And what is music's potential for communicating meaning into understanding?"
