        "text": "Clinician composer\n\nIn December 2024 Alex will join conductors Gregory X. Whitmore and William Tonissen and composer Michael Markowski at The Midwest Clinic in Chicago, presenting an action-packed session on the future of wind band music titled, The Band Director's Toolbox: Fusing Innovative Programming and Immersive Ensemble Rehearsal Techniques.\n\nAlex had a GREAT time presenting a multimedia clinic on artificial intelligence, immersive performances, and their impact on concerts and education, at the College Band Directors National Association Western/Northwestern Division Conference on March 29, 2024. Speaking at the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts, Alex (or was it her avatar?) described (as written by GTP4, or by her??) the many exciting (and sometimes terrifying) options ahead that are permanently changing the field.\n\nPosture-challenged composer\n\n\"Sit up straight!\". \"Stretch out your diaphragm!\". \"Folks in the back: no slumping!\".\n\nIf you're a band director, this probably sounds familiar. While sharing tales of these typical frustrations with a colleague one day, it dawned on Alex that a piece could serve as an object lesson. Voila, SLUMP, her newest electroacoustic band piece that's playable by musicians of all ages and... of all awful playing postures. A physically dramatic piece as well as a sonically one, audiences will laugh at the spectacle. And maybe everyone will even enjoy the music!\n\nThe piece has just been delivered to the many members of its commissioning consortium, and will be available for purchase after November 1, 2024.\n\nHear a demo of SLUMP:\n\nDoes your life lack the luster and shine that can only come from hearing a lively podcast conversation while you brush your teeth, get dressed, and sip your coffee while doom-scrolling the news on your phone? Well, no longer!\n\nLet fabulous music educator and host Catheryn Foster and Alex, a grateful-to-have-gotten-to-gab-with-her composer and advocate-with-a-good-radio-voice, fill your ears with excited chatter about:\n\n Music in rural communities\n\n Technology as a portal for DEI and socio-economic access\n\n Alex testifying to the FCC in Washington D.C.\n\n 30 years of copyright challenges, from Napster to AI\n\n The best way to license music\n\n Teaching the basics of intellectual property to young students\n\n How electroacoustic pieces are designed\n\n EA music and multimedia in education and performance\n\n Positive messages for students: encouraging curiosity and risk-taking without fear...\n\n...and at 44:10: an exceptionally blunt conversation about how to NORMALIZE, not TOKENIZE, when programming concerts and teaching materials.

CLICK HERE to enjoy!\n\nIs there a sonic hole in your day that would benefit from the cheery background patter of three musicians gabbing? And if those three musicians didn't just talk about music, but also about everything from the Manhattan island scene in the 70s, the San Juan Island scene in the 2020s, and a very slithery scene somewhere in Los Angeles in the 80s and 90s, would that entertain you? Well, it entertained Alex and the wonderful podcast hosts of Beyond Artless Phil Ostrander and Peter Haberman! Fill that sonic hole in your day and join them by clicking HERE!\n\nAdvocate composer\n\nJune 12th-16th in New York City is known as Music Week, but Alex jokingly calls it Annual Acronym Week. She was back in her home town of Manhattan for the board meetings of ASCAP, the ASCAP Foundation, and the MPA (Music Publishers Association of the United States), as well as annual events for the NMPA (National Music Publishers' Association) and SHoF (Songwriters Hall of Fame).\n\nEach of these organizations advocates tirelessly for creators, copyright, and these days, for the workable co-existence of artificially generated intelligence and biologically generated music-makers!\n\nClick each photo for a closer look at a lot of smiles.\n\nLow, low, and lower composer\n\nBetween May 29 and June 3 2023, Alex steeped herself in the low brass world at the International Tuba and Euphonium Association conference in Tempe, Arizona. Her sonata for tuba and piano, MUSIC FOR TWO BIG INSTRUMENTS, was among the required competition pieces in the Solo Tuba, Artist Division category, and was also heard in concert by Kevin Waas and pianist Susan Waas-- with four dancers performing to it, as well! Wanna see an excerpt? Click HERE.\n\nAnd thanks to a commission from Matt Hightower at University of Kentucky, a fresh electroacoustic piece for tuba and euphonium ensemble titled DEPTH SOUNDING was masterfully premiered at the conference on May 31st during the first main concert at Gammage Hall. Click below to listen, or you can watch the performance on the piece's webpage linked above!\n\nDetermined to get it right composer\n\nOf the roughly 200 pieces in Alex's diverse concert catalog from the past 25 years, all but one of them was composed, premiered, published, patted on the head, and sent out into the world by the composer to make friends with more musicians while she moved on to other things. Like writing the next piece. Or scooping out the cat litter box. Yes, all but one: ARCHIPELAGO.\n\nA chamber ensemble work for ten players commissioned in 2009 for Chicago's wonderful Fifth House ensemble, its first iteration excluded a piano part solely due to the lack of space for one on the stage in the premiering venue. A few years later, Alex created a second version of the piece with piano, turning the dectet into an onzetet. And giving her an excuse to make up words.\n\nDespite the efforts of ardent conductors who in post-rehearsal distress from attempting to make sense out of this ragged music should have billed Alex for their therapy sessions, subsequent performances of ARCHIPELAGO always pinned Alex's internal Cringe-O-Meter. She revised the piece in 2013. And again in 2015. And again in 2021. The Cringe-O-Meter remained unforgiving and relentless.\n\nFinally in 2023, Alex's muses stumbled upon an epiphany of cognitive dissonance (ooh!): the true essence of the music that she'd actually written was at cross purposes with the intellectual \"idea\" of the music that had been lodged in her head since 2009. Using her sharpest extraction pliers, Alex finally freed herself from her preconceptions. Her internal Cringe-O-Meter has forever been silenced. Well, at least for this piece!\n\n14 years later, she is delighted to publish the final version of ARCHIPELAGO. You can hear a demo, and hopefully sometime soon, a live version!\n\nSecond symphony\n\nJuly 13, 2021 at the DeVos Performance Hall in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Alex's four-movement symphony for winds, percussion, and pre-recorded soundscape, SUSPENDED, was premiered. Conducted by Cynthia Johnston Turner and commissioned by Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma for their National Intercollegiate Band and Convention, it is Alex's most dramatic and emotional reflection to date: addressing not only the pandemic, but the many troubling, ongoing issues of the times. Dr. Johnston Turner gave a second performance of the symphony on March 23rd 2022, leading the Eastman Wind Ensemble at Kodak Hall in Rochester, NY.\n\nWant to hear it?

Click HERE to watch!\n\nListen to SUSPENDED:\n\n2021 premiere\n\nMuch of the year 2020 can be epitomized by the concept of being deprived of breath. From the lung-destroying effects of COVID-19, to the murderous strangulations of police brutality. From the searing, choking walls of wildfire smoke, to the smothering treason of politicians attempting to asphyxiate democracy.\n\nAll of these topics traversed Alex's mind and heart as she composed BREATHE, a new, ten minute work for electroacoustic wind ensemble, commissioned by the Colorado Mesa University Wind Symphony, Calvin Hofer, conductor, with the generous support of Karen Combs and Lynn Wegener. The piece is Alex's second one utilizing a 12-tone row (the first being the very, VERY different TIGHT SQUEEZE). BREATHE would have premiered in Colorado in December 2020, but the pandemic delayed the concert to April 27, 2021.\n\nWhat was not delayed was the sense of emotional release that Alex felt through the catharsis of composing this work, which begins as bleakly as the subject matter, but shifts mood as the final minutes appear. You can hear for yourself, in a powerful recording from the premiere.\n\nListen to BREATHE:\n\n2020 premiere\n\nAlex created an unusual, sound design-heavy electroacoustic concert opener for wind band, ASCENT. It was scheduled to be performed by the University of Hawai'i Wind Ensemble conducted by lead commissioner Jeffrey Boeckman at the CBDNA Western/Northwestern Division Conference in Tacoma, WA on March 19, 2020, but we all know what happened to this and every other conference across the world that month. The work was commissioned by 25 ensembles from the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAlso featured at the conference on March 20th would have been Alex's band work MOMENT, performed by the University of Alberta Symphonic Wind Ensemble conducted by Angela Schroeder, and a presentation on large ensemble multimedia works and social activism that Alex was looking forward to giving, with University of British Columbia Director of Bands Rob Taylor, and University of Puget Sound Director of Bands Gerard Morris.\n\nNonetheless, right before all the concert cancellations, the University of Hawai'i Wind Ensemble was able to perform ASCENT a couple of times for their local island audiences. You can hear the fantastic job they did for the Honolulu premiere by clicking on the links below.\n\nListen to ASCENT:\n\n2019 and 2024 premieres\n\nBand director Jim Mobley loves the fresh genre of electroacoustic wind band music, and believes that there should be more such pieces in the repertoire— especially for younger musicians to perform. He put together the N-BEAM consortium, which over the course of three years, has supported the addition of three new Grade 2.5 EA works to the concert band world. Composers Daniel Montoya Jr. and Benjamin Taylor wrote their pieces-- TECHNO BLADE, and AXE TO GRIND, respectively-- for the 2018 and 2019 seasons, and in 2020, Alex delivered OFF THE EDGE, to its 35 commissioning ensembles.\n\nHave a listen to Alex's pop-EDM/Euro-disco approach to music for middle schoolers: and play it loudly!\n\nListen to OFF THE EDGE:\n\nWant to witness just how ridiculous three composers and a band director can be under the glare of conference floor lights at the Midwest Clinic? Click here:\n\n2020 album\n\nA [non-performing!] pianist herself, Alex has always loved composing for the instrument. Pianist Adam Marks recorded all of Alex's solo piano works for a gorgeous album on innova Recordings titled ARCANA. The collection was released on August 28, 2020, and if you visit the dedicated page for the [slightly unusual] project, you can read about it and enjoy preview excerpts, and videos!\n\nThe March-April 2021 issue of American Record Guide includes a glowing review of the entire album, penned by Stephanie Ann Boyd, who concludes with, \"This disc is a triumph and I highly recommend spending time with the work of these two artists.\" Click HERE to read the entire review of ARCANA on Ms. Boyd's website.\n\nActivist Music has published a collection of Alex Shapiro's solo piano works, available at a discounted rate as a set of .pdf downloads. Ranging from short offerings to those with multiple movements, these idiomatic pieces reveal an especially personal musical world. For complete information about the published collection, click HERE.\n\n2022 clinician\n\nAlex is proud to be a clinician for Conn-Selmer, and is available to speak to groups on myriad topics ranging from technology, DEI initiatives, copyright and business, activism, and the art of composition.\n\nAs part of the Winter 2022 Music Educator Master Class series, New Beginnings: Rehearse and Renew, Alex gave a webinar titled \"Music and Activism: Raising Awareness One Note at a Time\" in which she offered powerful examples of the power possessed by music educators and creators to raise musician and audience awareness of social and environmental topics.\n\nIn April 2022, Alex had the pleasure of being hosted by Dr. Paula Crider as they walked the audience through Alex's latest symphony, SUSPENDED during her interview for Conn-Selmer's Concert Artistry series.\n\n2021 residency\n\nAlex was the guest composer at the Total Band Director Workshop, held July 28 & 29 at Rush Creek Golf Course in Maple Grove, Minnesota.\n\nHosted by Eckroth Music and sponsored by Hal Leonard, J.W. Pepper, Yamaha, and Conn & Selmer, this annual event is an intensive workshop for band directors that provides new tools, materials, and fresh perspectives on the field.\n\nAlex gave presentations on electroacoustic music, multimedia, and the power of sharing environmental and social messages through music and the impact performances can have on raising audience awareness. Additionally, there was an electroacoustic \"petting zoo\" reading session, during which directors played excerpts from a selection of Alex's EA band works and learned how to set up the tech and become comfortable with a click track!\n\n2021 clinician\n\nAlex was a clinician on two panels at the 2021 Midwest Clinic in Chicago.\n\nEmbedding Social Emotional Learning in Instrumental Music Education explored creative approaches to bringing out the best in students, and Alex-- appearing via a multimedia video presentation- was joined by co-hosts Scott Edgar and Bob Morrison of Music for All, and composers Brian Balmages, Cait Nishimura, Richard Saucedo, Jim Stephenson, and Omar Thomas. You can watch the session HERE.\n\nAlex is also pleased to be a clinician for Music for All, and has participated in several of their field-expanding webinars.\n\nThe Horizon Leans Forward… A Panel Discussion on the Issues of Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity in the Wind Band Field offered a frank conversation among Alex's composer and conductor co-authors Erik Leung, Courtney Snyder, Alfred Watkins, Rob Taylor, and Jodie Blackshaw.\n\nLobbying\n\nAlex has often gone to Capitol Hill where each spring, members of the Board of Directors of ASCAP and writer members who are strong copyright advocates meet with Senators, members of Congress, and their aides, to keep the message of fair compensation for music creators front and center. Known as \"Stand with Songwriters\" Advocacy Day, the office visits are preceded by an inspiring evening concert at the Library of Congress called, \"We Write the Songs,\" where policy makers enjoy performances by some of the world's top ASCAP creators.\n\nOver the years Alex has spoken with many Representatives, including Joaquin Castro (D-TX), pictured here in May 2016 with Alex and ASCAP board President and Chairman Paul Williams.\n\nInternational workshops\n\nAlex was in Tokyo, Japan in late May 2019 for meetings with her colleagues on the Executive Committee of The International Council Of Music Authors (CIAM)— the writers council of CISAC.\n\nWhile there, she and several CIAM ExCo members gave a workshop hosted by Japan's collective management society JASRAC, for an auditorium of Japanese music creators, addressing local and international copyright issues.\n\nIn January 2019 during the CIAM ExCo meetings in Cabo Verde, Africa, Alex participated in career and copyright workshops with her CIAM ExCo writer colleagues.\n\nIn November 2018 in Mexico City, Alex was with her writer colleagues on the CIAM ExCo at the Annual CIAM Congress in Mexico City. She moderated a panel discussion with music creators from Australia, Europe, Canada, and South America, discussing not only the problems of far-reaching biases, but the solutions. Also in attendance were ASCAP President and Chairman Paull Williams, and ASCAP CEO Elizabeth Matthews.\n\nAlex again joined her international writer colleagues on the CIAM ExCo at the May 2018 CISAC General Assembly meeting in Warsaw, Poland, at which she spoke on a panel addressing gender inequity issues throughout the music industry. You can read about it by clicking here.\n\nCIAM addresses issues ranging from global copyright and royalty payment improvements, to transfer of value, fair trade music, blockchain potential, and much more, in an effort to advance the wellbeing of music creators around the world.\n\nSpeaking\n\nThe ASCAP EXPO-- now known as the ASCAP EXPERIENCE-- brings artists from every genre together in Hollywood for an inspiring conference of workshops, panels, performances and networking. In 2017 Alex spoke on a panel titled \"Getting Credit Where Credit is Due,\" addressing the need for accurate attribution across all genres and in all uses of digital media, alongside songwriter and performer Aloe Blacc, songwriter and fellow ASCAP Board member Desmond Child, attorney and panel moderator Dina LaPolt, and Auddly founder Niclas Molinder (pictured L-R). You can read about the animated discussion-- which included comments from Pandora's head of publisher licensing Adam Parness during the Q&A by clicking here.\n\nAt the 2016 EXPO, Alex gave a lively presentation on a panel about creative uses of multimedia in concert music, titled \"Seeing Music: Multimedia Concerts for a Visual World.\" Pictured L-R: Composer Veronika Krausas, Alex, visualists Candace Reckinger and Michael Patterson, and ASCAP VP of Concert Music Cia Toscanini.\n\nAlex has been a speaker at nearly all of the ASCAP EXPOS-- now called The ASCAP Experience-- since the annual conference was launched in 2005.\n\nAlex Shapiro is very, very fortunate to have her works performed in hundreds of venues every year. A list of selected concerts for which she has information can be found by visting THIS PAGE.\n\nIf you have programmed a Shapiro work or have an upcoming concert date, please email the information— as well as a program, if possible— to Alex by clicking HERE. You'll be added to the Concerts page, and a smile will be added to Alex's face! Thanks!\n\nChapters\n\nAlex is one of six co-authors of the new book, The Horizon Leans Forward...Stories of Courage, Strength, and Triumph of Underrepresented Communities in the Wind Band Field, released by GIA Publications December 2020.\n\nEdited by conductor Erik Kar Jun Leung (Oregon State University), the book includes Ms. Shapiro's chapter, Reaching Out and Bringing Women In, along with those from composer Jodie Blackshaw and conductors Alfred L. Watkins, Robert Taylor (University of British Columbia), Courtney Snyder (University of Michigan), and Erik Leung, each of whom address perspectives of women, BIPOC, and LGBTQIA2S+ composers and conductors of the past and present.\n\nAdditionally, the publication includes a notable annotated bibliography of works by underrepresented composers. The six co-authors have done several compelling Zoominars about the book contents, and those links can be found in the diversity and includion section, HERE:\n\nTo read more about the book and to order a hard copy, click HERE:\n\nTo order the digital copy, click HERE:\n\nBlogs\n\nGreg Sandow is the author of an insightful blog on the future of classical music, and invited Alex to be a guest blogger in March 2013. Click here to see what she has to say about the fun of living in the middle of nowhere and being in the center of everywhere, in an essay titled E-ing there\n\nAnd without question, the very best resource for Alex's musings can be found in the decade-worth of pixels and photographs of her blog, Notes from the Kelp.\n\nDocumentary appearances\n\nIn a segment filmed at her San Juan Island home, Alex is featured speaking about composer Morten Lauridsen at the opening of a beautiful film about his life and music, titled Shining Night. Winner of Best Documentary at the 2012 Washington, D.C. Independent Film Festival, the film was directed by Michael Stillwater, and has been screening at festivals in the U.S. and Europe in conjunction with the release of the DVD. You can enjoy a trailer of the film here.\n\nAlex also appears in a longer segment at the opening Stillwater's 2015 documentary, In Search of the Great Song, which is the winner of the award for Best Documentary from the 2016 Moondance International Film Festival in Boulder, CO. Alex speaks about the many inspirations for her music that are found in the natural world surrounding her, as BELOW, in which she features a Humpback whale song, plays as the underscore.\n\nIn Michael Stillwater's third film, Beyond the Fear of Singing, Alex talks about non-musicians freely embracing the freedom of expression.\n\nYou can enjoy previews of all three beautiful documentaries here.\n\nPhotography\n\nVisitors to Alex's blog know she's rarely without her camera, and her photos have been used for other people's CD covers and websites.\n\nAlex is one of the winners of the 2012 IMA Marine Life Photography Contest, hosted by the San Juan Islands Museum of Art and judged by the legendary Ernest Brooks II.\n\nAlex's photo of a Bald Eagle headed straight toward her hung in the museum throughout the summer, alongside Brooks's stunning Silver Seas exhibit. That bird also spent the summer of 2013 hanging in Seattle's Museum of Flight, as a selection for its Spirit of Flight exhibit.\n\nThe photo, Incoming!, (also a first prize winner at the 2012 San Juan County Fair!) can be viewed slightly larger, by clicking on the bird.\n\nCreative curriculum\n\nCOVID-19 has brought many challenges to university music programs, but in the face of limitations there are also positive opportunities. Rather than try to make something as precious as live ensemble performance exist in a format not yet designed for it, Alex gave some thought to what an online connection for students in band and orchestra can uniquely provide.\n\nAt the invitation of the University of Washington's Director of Bands Timothy Salzman, Alex came up with a syllabus for the students that reflects our current reality. Click to read the article about the successful project, Putting the E- in E-nsemble.\n\nBetween March and December 2020, Alex oversaw the curriculum with more than 30 universities and high schools, and the free syllabus continues to be used by educators at all levels, to bring the project to even more music students who discover an inner creativity they hadn't realized they possess.\n\nIf you would like to see the syllabus, just email Alex and she'll be happy to get it to you. She's available as a consultant, or to help you customize the course for your students and to Zoom in to work with them!\n\nCells that morph\n\nJoining 11 of her peers, Alex co-founded the Creative Repertoire Initiative to encourage composers to create adaptable works for ensembles with varying personnel and rehearsal circumstances.\n\nFor this world in constant flux, Alex's 2020 electroacoustic work, PASSAGES, offers a calming, centering, meditative, and encouraging outlook for any combination of instruments. Each cellular phrase sounds beautiful whether stacked or exposed, and played with any of the chords in the accompaniment track. It's never quite the same piece twice, because musicians make random choices from a selection of melodies and rhythms of varying difficulty. The music is especially well suited for musicians recording themselves during distance learning sessions, and even for soloists wishing to improvise!\n\nStream an excerpt\n\nfrom the PASSAGES accompaniment track:\n\nListen to the entire\n\nlive recording of PASSAGES (3:00):\n\nFlex for newbies\n\nDuring the same period during which Alex composed her oh-so-very sophisticated second symphony SUSPENDED, she also composed her first piece for beginning music students, a 3-part plus percussion flex work titled COUNT TO TEN. Why? Because she believes that all living composers should be writing primers for the music of their time, by participating in the educational process and providing fresh, creative repertoire that can further inspire the students to keep playing!\n\nToddlers can count to ten, so surely, middle schoolers can count to nine! And once a young student can count to nine, meters in 5 and 7 won't be daunting. For a closer look at this unusual piece with an optional and REALLY GROOVY accompaniment track, click HERE:\n\nListen to COUNT TO TEN:\n\nEverything but the\n\nKITCHEN SYNC was composed in 2021 as a very flexible stand-alone miniature that is also one fifth of a collective offering of similarly micro-length pieces titled SUITE TREATS. Composers & Schools Executive Director Lisa Oman and conductor and Creative Repertoire Initiative co-founder Robert Ambrose invited five founding members of CRI to add their voices to a compilation of brief, medium difficulty ensemble works designed to be highly adaptable.\n\nAlex, along with composers Brian Balmages (Focal Point), Jennifer Jolley (Neoncore), Pete Meechan (Lullaby), and Frank Ticheli (Moving On), were each paired with high school wind band directors in different parts of the U.S., and engaged with the students online to come up with a fresh take on what can be accomplished musically-- in only about a minute.\n\nMore than a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic made online resources a necessity, Alex was among the earliest composers to use the web to connect with ensembles all over the world.\n\nAlex really enjoys interacting in person with students and faculty during rehearsals and guest artist residencies in which she spends a few days at a university and gives master classes, private composition lessons, lectures on the changing paradigm of the music business, and attends rehearsals and performances of her music. But when budgets and schedules and, oh, y'know, global pandemics don't allow for travel, Zoom, Skype, Webex, Google Meet or anything similar have become the next best thing.\n\nWhether for a rehearsal of a concert wind band piece or chamber work, or to bring Alex right into your lecture hall for an interactive discussion about the music business, web video is a great tool. Alex's live feedback is valuable, and musicians love it when Alex turns her camera around to show them a source of her inspiration: the sea at her feet, with the occasional Bald Eagle or Orca whale gliding past. The technology brings a unique dimension into the art of collaborative music-making, and connects students to the person-- and sometimes to the very funny stories-- behind the notes on the music stands.\n\nMy compositions are a very personal expression, but I also write to give musicians pieces which they'll really enjoy playing, and to offer audiences music which will speak to them directly and emotionally. As with the sea which surrounds me here on San Juan Island, there's an ebb and flood to this happy relationship. I compose music because I have to, without expectation that others will resonate with it, yet with the hope that many might. My art is a tidepool, inviting others to enter and... with luck, thrive.\n\nComposing is a lot like making love. We're trying to please ourselves. We're hoping to please at least one other person. And, we are in fact, communicating. Passionately. I compose to communicate, and ideally, my work will show you not only a glimpse of me, but a reflection of yourself.\n\nThe intimacy of the magic triangle of composer, musicians and audience is what draws me to compose. In the midst of writing, I love exploring and balancing the voice of each instrument within a group, whether a small chamber ensemble or a symphonic band. When I have the opportunity to rehearse one of my pieces with players, it's exciting to be part of the volley of interpretations and personalities. Music lives through the art of others.\n\nFinally, when the new piece is performed, the triangle between me, the musicians and the audience is complete. A musical idea which was formerly a personal impression has now become a public gesture.\n\nAmong the many inspirations for my music has been the gorgeous coastal areas in which I've lived; water seems to be an inescapable theme in my life. I grew up in Manhattan overlooking first the East River, then later, I lived by the Hudson. At 21, I moved to southern California and spent most of my 24 years there at the shore in Malibu and even afloat on the water itself, living part-time on a sailboat in Santa Barbara.\n\nSince 2007, it's been the serenity of Washington State's remote San Juan Island (TWICE the size of the island on which I grew up!) and the Salish Sea that makes my muses so happy. When I'm not composing, I'm marveling at the abundant shoreline life and tidepools directly in front of my house. This connection to the natural world has become as necessary to me now as urban life was to me years ago.\n\nI've developed a little hobby of capturing in photographs the creatures and the small, yet remarkable moments that define my daily life here. This website is riddled with them, and you can experience more of this joy with me via my blog, Notes From the Kelp, and two personal Facebook pages that reflect my life here: San Juan Island's Golden Point, and the more recent San Juan Island's Mineral Point.\n\nI'm convinced that there has never been a better time to be a composer.\n\nThere are no longer stylistic boundaries limiting our expression, and thanks to tools such as social media and websites like this, we can share our explorations with the world, regardless of where we choose to live.\n\nI get a lot of joy from encouraging my peers to take full advantage of the freedom and power artists now possess. The internet is every bit as significant to human history as the invention of the printing press, as I've written about in essays like this one.\n\nSo, there's a bit about me and what motivates my work as a composer. If you'd like to read a little more on my thoughts about composers, listeners and life in general, my musings continue HERE\n\nOr, click around the other pages on this site to learn more about my background, read about my recent pieces and hear audio clips of my music. Drop me an email if you feel like it; I love hearing from people around the world. Enjoy!\n\nZip back up to the top of this looooong page!\n\n_____________________"
