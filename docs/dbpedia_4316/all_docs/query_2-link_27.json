        "text": "The 1913 riotous premiere of Stravinskyâs âRite of Springâ is pretty well known in classical music history. Sandwiching the premiere of his masterpiece of modernism between well known conservative chestnuts such as âLes Sylphidesâ (an orchestration by Alexander Glazunov of piano music by Chopin, 1907-9) which opened the concert along with Carl Maria von Weberâs âLes Spectre de la Roseâ (an 1841 Berlioz orchestration of Weberâs 1819 piano piece, âInvitation to the Danceâ) and Alexander Borodinâs âPolovtsian Dancesâ from his opera âPrince Igorâ (1887-1890) which were programmed to follow it. Combine these (familiar to audiences) conservative works with the Riteâs original choreography by Vaclav Nijinsky and the subject of pagan ritual that form the scenario played before an audience consisting of elite concert goers seeking a familiar easy experience along with a burgeoning group of bohemian leaning audience members (who loved the Riteâs loud, subversive nature of both music and staging) and you have a formula for conflict. Speculation is that Stravinsky and/or his producers planned this event to create a contrast for his new modernist work but more likely it was a largely a product of its time and of human nature.\n\nFifty two years later, Hans Werner Henze appears to have had nothing in mind (at least initially) other than the premiere of his new work, âDas FloÃ der Medusaâ (The Raft of the Medusa) on December 9, 1968 in Hamburgâs âPlanten und Blomenâ Hall. The recording which was later released on DGG LPs had been done sans audience on the previous days, December 4-8th, and preparations were being made for that nightâs world premiere performance before an audience.\n\nAn article would later run in the German magazine Der Spiegel describing the event. I present the text of that article in my own translation:\n\nDer Spiegel, December 12, 1968\n\nâWhat is necessaryâ, says Hans Werner Henze, 42, âare not museums, opera houses and world premieres â¦ What is necessary is the creation of mankindâs greatest work of art: the world revolution.â\n\nLast Monday, Henzeâs âDas Floss der Medusa,â an âOratorio volgare e militare, in due partiâ commissioned by the NDR, was to be premiered in Hamburg â instead, there was a revolution in the hall.\n\nThe 1060 seats in Hall B by Planten un Blomen were fully occupied, the NDR Symphony Orchestra was already tuning the instruments, on the podium were ready: Edda Moser (soprano), Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (baritone) and Charles Regnier (speaker) , the North German Radio Choir, the RIAS Chamber Choir and the St. Nikolai Boysâ Choir. The game could begin, and it began â a duo volgare e militare between NDR and SDS.\n\nBecause the Berlin SDS friends under Gaston Salvatore, summoned by Henze, didnât want to do without this premiere of the APO (AuÃerparlamentarische Opposition) man Henze any more than the socialist students of the Hamburg Music Academy â albeit for different reasons: The Hamburgers cared about Henzeâs music as reactionary to expose the Berliners, to bring their Hamburg colleagues to reason and to divert attention to the middle-class audience. Action against Henze, argued the Berlin âProject Group Culture and Revolution,â would only benefit the bourgeois enemy.\n\nAfter three days of palaver, the Hamburg wing was lame. For example, the intention to ask the composer to explain the structures of his music when he played Medusa was abandoned, as was the plan to intervene in the choral singing, and the attempt to expose Henzeâs listeners to Henze as culinary Henze consumers.\n\nOn Monday evening, Berliners and Hamburgers moved in socialist harmony to Planten un Blomen, the premiere location that Henze claims to have confused with Blohm & Voss. At least thatâs how the Berlin SDS had informed the Hamburg SDS.\n\nNDR program director Franz Reinholz, to whom Henze owes the âMedusaâ commission, knows otherwise: âHenze,â Reinholz assures, âinspected the hall himself beforehand. He was also informed about the audience.â shipyard workers, it was, the socialist students recognized once again, an audience of ârich bastards.â\n\nShortly before 8 p.m. the squad was ready for action in Hall B. And before the conductor Henze stepped out of the artistâs room, Che was already in the hall: the agitators had pinned a Che Guevara portrait to the desk; it was intended to remind us of what had been concealed in the program with Henzeâs approval: the oratorio is dedicated to the Latin American freedom fighter.\n\nNDR program director Franz Reinholz didnât appreciate this memento at all â he tore down the poster. He felt that politics and art did not go together.\n\nThe students didnât think so. They put up a new poster and hoisted the red flag, and a team of anarchists, who had come with duck decoys and other hunting instruments, hung a black one next to it. Then the radio hit, the police joined in, the RIAS Chamber Choir began, but not in unison. âLower the red flag,â demanded one singer, two singers left sobbing: âWe are Berliners and have had enough of red flags.â to whose honor they should sing, left the stage and never came back.\n\nThe composer, however, was determined to prove his revolutionary sentiment to his comrades for the first time by saying, âThe red flag,â said Henze, âit stays.â\n\nWhile NDR director Gerhard SchrÃ¶der (SPD), long since in the safe broadcasting van, stopped the live tumult at 8:19 p.m. and radioed his listeners a recording of the dress rehearsal, his deputy, Freiherr von Hammerstein-Equord (CDU), countered in the hall the resistance of the demonstrators banners and placards; A little later, a squad of 25 police officers, visors on combat helmets, broke into the hall. âNazis!â âFascists!â shouted the audience. One artist yelled enthusiastically, âDown with the Reds!â\n\nâThe police,â Hammerstein explained, âwere ready at the request of the NDR, which considered demonstrations possible and had to ensure the safety of its employees, the audience and valuable instruments.â\n\nNDR employee Ernst Schnabel, librettist of âMedusaâ, felt the precautions thoroughly. Several police officers threw him through a glass door, expedited him with six other delinquents to police headquarters, took his fingerprints, and locked him in cell 7 until midnight. Schnabel to Hammerstein-Equord: âWe donât have breakfast together anymore.â\n\nMeanwhile, Hammerstein kept order in Planten un Blomen. When Henze informed the audience: âThe intervention of the police prevented the discussion,â Hammerstein snatched the microphone from his hand. The hands in the stalls responded with rhythmic Ho Chi Minh clapping, and Henze clapped along â three times. Then he disappeared through a back door.\n\nAt that time the âraft of the Medusaâ was already well advanced in the ether waves â on the usual counter-revolutionary course.\n\nâWhereverâ, the âSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitungâ judged, âthe choirs sang, there was the old, floating, iridescent Henze sound, which doesnât hurt anyone and never becomes distinctive. The orchestra â¦ strangely often reminded of Richard Strauss.â\n\nThe music critic Heinrich von LÃ¼ttwitz saw âMedusaâ as a âtragi-comic absurdityâ full of âromantic coloursâ, with âsometimes clumsy, sometimes fussy recitatives and melodramasâ.\n\nHenze biographer Klaus Geitel saw the âraftâ in the âocean of an emotional but overly extended, lyrically colored monotonyâ.\n\nIt may be that, as Henze puts it, this evening âbrought him a little furtherâ politically. But the Henze fans in the APO have failed â thatâs how the currently most thoroughly analyzing music theorist Heinz-Klaus Metzger, who identifies with the âanti-authoritarian wing of the SDS,â puts it.\n\nâThe APO, Metzger predicts, âwill only have created meaningful conditions when German musicians no longer refuse to perform under a red or even a black flag, but instead perform a work by Henze. And for strictly musical reasons. Unfortunately, not even Tucholskyâs bon mot applies to this composer: âBecause of bad weather, the German revolution took place in music.â\n\n______________________________________\n\nâââââââââââââââââââ\n\nSo it went in 1968. The Oratorio performance was cancelled and the world premiere had to wait until January 29, 1971 when it was performed in Vienna by the ORF Orchestra conducted by Miltiades Carides. The recording of the first performance was achieved prior to the performance with the audience. That recording was released in 1969.\n\nMany more performances followed but one of those performances, in 2001, was attended by a former chorister, Henning Sidow. He was twelve years old at that 1968 non-concert. And the following article on his experiences of that attempted performance was published in Der Spiegel in 2013.\n\nâââââââââââââââââ\n\n__________________________________\n\nBlaze at the choral-concert. How the âRaft of the Medusaâ went down.\n\nHe was anxiously awaiting the big performance: when he was twelve, Henning Sidow was supposed to perform on stage with the NDR boysâ choir in Hamburg. And indeed, the live performance of the oratorio was exciting â but for completely unexpected reasons.\n\nThe boysâ choir was founded in 1960 as the choir of the North German Radio and has been connected to the main church of St. Nikolai since 1967.\n\nâAs a twelve-year-old in 1968, I had only vague ideas about the political and social turmoil of the time. But on December 9th, as a member of the St. Nikolai boysâ choir, they became tangible experiences for me as a result of the unsuccessful premiere of the oratorio âDas Raft der Medusaâ by composer Hans Werner Henze in Hall B in Hamburgâs Planten un Blomen Park.\n\nI had been in the boysâ choir for four years, which belonged to the NDR until 1967 and was then taken over by the St. Nikolai parish in Hamburg. We âexperiencedâ boys felt quite up to the task of taking part in Henzeâs musically demanding oratorio and also appearing in a world premiere that was to be broadcast live on the radio.\n\nThe play tells the tragic story of the French frigate âMedusaâ, which ran aground as the only ship in a convoy on the way to Senegal in 1816. Since there were not enough lifeboats for the 400 people on board, the crew built a raft that could accommodate around 150 men, women and children and which was to be pulled ashore by the boats. But the officers fled in the boats, leaving the people on the raft to fend for themselves. On the day of the accidental rescue 13 days later, there were only 15 survivors. The others fell victim to starvation, lack of water or cannibalism.â\n\nHide and seek in the empty hall\n\nâOur boysâ choir was supposed to portray the children on the raft â first as living, then as dead. A difficult piece with a socially critical background, this âRaft of the Medusaâ, we knew that. It meant not only intensive rehearsals, but also many afternoons and evenings of rehearsals. What we didnât know was that the premiere was never to take place.\n\nThe location of the event and the preparations fascinated me. The hall seemed huge to me as a child. Large platforms were set up here for the performance, with countless instruments on them. There were people everywhere: stagehands, technicians, orchestra musicians, choristers and soloists â it was just teeming. Now we guys were added.\n\nWe had a lot of waiting time and were able to explore everything. So we crawled under the stage construction, played hide and seek, crawled under the platforms and shimmied over wooden struts until we got too many splinters in our fingers. And right next door there was another hall, several stories high â a gigantic glass box. There was no event taking place at the time, so the hall was yawning and unlit. We strolled through them, hearts in our pants because of the darkness and the eerie acoustics of the room.â\n\nProtest in the concert hall\n\nâThen things got serious, rehearsals began. In my memory, Hans Werner Henze was a small man who was already a bit bald at the time, but incredibly energetic. He radiated a mixture of warmth, ingenious artistry and normality. We boys found him sympathetic, but he had no airs and graces and met everyone completely naturally, friendly and patiently. He treated us as if we were adults, which I found very beneficial. When I was a child, I was used to other well-known personalities whom we had met here and there through our performances to be treated and professionally not taken very seriously.\n\nHenze was excellent at conveying his music to the participants, it was lively, colorful and exciting like the story itself. The dramatic story and the historical background that he and the music told us captivated me even then. Conducting, however, was not his thing, I remember his somewhat awkward gestures. But thatâs not so important in a professional ensemble, as long as the right impulses and cues come. In any case, we children liked and admired him and his music.\n\nOn December 9, 1968, as far as I can remember, the hall was filled to the last seat with an audience. There was talk of more than 1000 guests. Henze was already at the desk. But just before it started, there was a small crowd in front of the stage. A few protesting students stood directly in front of the podium and hung red flags to the left and right of Henzeâs desk. It was not clear whether the master just put up with this or whether it had been agreed with him, as was later speculated. In any case, he didnât seem to put up much resistance to the activities.â\n\nThe situation is escalating\n\nâShortly thereafter, the audience and the choir became restless. Because one of the choirs, the RIAS Chamber Choir, came from Berlin, the enclosed city. Red flags were literally a red rag for many who lived there. At first I â and Iâm sure my fellow boys too â didnât understand much of what was happening down there. But when voices from the Berlin choir grew louder and louder, refusing to sing under âthe red flagâ, I understood what it was all about. The adults feared that they and the music would be exploited by demonstrating communist students. In addition, a large portrait of ChÃ© Guevara has now been erected, to which the work is dedicated.\n\nHenzeâs efforts to get the performance started were nipped in the bud by the boycott of the Berlin singers. The removal of the communist symbols was demanded louder and louder from the podium, before they would refuse to sing a single note. In the meantime it was getting more and more restless in the auditorium and in front of the stage there were small scuffles between the demonstrators and some spectators who got involved. Negotiations between the choir and the composer were taking place behind the scenes as to the conditions under which the performance could still take place.\n\nWe boys watched the whole thing with suspense, since the circumstances had now reversed: the auditorium had become the stage, and we on the podium had a box view of this live cultural scandal. Music was out of the question. In the back of the hall, the doors flew open and police officers in full riot gear marched in. Like a horde of ants, they came down the aisles from several sides to the podium. I donât remember how many there were, maybe a hundred. They looked particularly martial with their helmets with full visors and the shields they â to protect against what actually: a few students, musicians and false notes? â carried in front of them.â\n\nA dark chapter\n\nâHenze had meanwhile disappeared unnoticed and downstairs young people were having their arms twisted behind their backs in order to be taken away. Among them was Ernst Schnabel, who wrote the text of the play. He was later charged with âresisting the authority of the stateâ. On the other hand, part of the audience did not like the actions of the police and protested, which did not prevent the state authorities from their plan to convict the âperpetratorsâ in flagrante delicto.\n\nI canât remember exactly how long the commotion lasted. In any case, it never came to a performance, and at some point we left the stage disappointed. It was incomprehensible to us children why a few red flags and the likeness of a bearded South American led to such an uproar. For us it was about art, about music. We felt cheated of our work.\n\nThe newspapers reported extensively on this event in the following days. Some tabloids insisted on turning it into a real political scandal. To this day it is unclear to me what the state authorities were thinking when they made this appearance. Thatâs for sure\n\nThat she was thin-skinned in those times and liked to overreact on such occasions. The fear that the ideology that prevailed behind the Iron Curtain could also spread to the West was too great.\n\nFor Hans Werner Henze, who died in 2012, this scandal is said to have been a dark chapter in his artistic career. Later, it is said, he did not want to be reminded of it.\n\nMy own memories of that evening only surfaced again years later: at the much delayed premiere in June 2001 in Hamburgâs Laeiszhalle. After 33 years I experienced âThe Raft of the Medusaâ a second time. The fact that I was still able to silently speak and sing along to the lyrics and the music showed how much the piece and the story it was based on had impressed me at the time. None of it was lost. I left the performance deeply touched.â\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nSo, here we are some 46 years after the riotous non-premiere of Henzeâs fine oratorio/requiem, 111 years since the famed âriots at the Riteâ. The Stravinsky has since firmly taken its place in the commonly performed orchestral and ballet repertory. The Henze work, never laying any claim to the seminal and visionary compositional methods that characterize Stravinskyâs landmark work, continues to receive performances and recordings having established itself as a substantial work, and himself as a significant composer with a rich and varied career.\n\nNB: All translations are my own efforts. Historical photos are included under fair use terms.\n\nAfter agonizing about writing a âbest ofâ blog and publishing it before January 1, I decided to take a pause and enjoy the holidays. So here I look back on my 2023 in the rear view mirror but with memories still pretty fresh.\n\nRegular readers of this blog likely already know of my oft shared opinion of the superfluous nature of âbest ofâ lists and of my acquiescence in producing such on an annual basis. I certainly donât think of this as a meaningless exercise and I think the process has grown on me. It is a chance to achieve a perspective which would be missed by simply plowing on ahead with the usual flow of reviews and articles. But drawing down that 12 month perspective is an opportunity to evaluate those months, to see where weâve been and to hopefully get a smidgen of insight into where I/we are likely headed.\n\nMy Facebook friends will recognize the representative meme at the head of this article which is one of the more cloying aspects of âAIâ, whatever that is. So indulge me for a moment to look at this seemingly new intrusion into the reality we thought we knew. So, what is âAIâ and what will it do to us? Ultimately Iâm not the one to answer that question but Iâd like to throw some ideas to add to the speculation.\n\nFirst, the choices a composer makes, like the choices of a painter, a writer, etc. are the stuff of the mystery of creation itself. Why âA majorâ, or why that tuning, or scale, or rhythm, or orchestration, etc? So along comes the notion of removing, or at least distancing, the artist from their creative product. That notion started not with famed proponent John Cage but rather with Johannes Chrysostymous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in his K. 516f musical dice game. Voila! Algorithmic composition (actually fairly common practice in the classical era). An early manifestation of âAIâ? Perhaps.\n\nLejaren Hiller (1924-1994) was the first composer to employ electronic data processing in a musical work in his Fourth String Quartet subtitled âIliac Suiteâ in 1957. There followed similar experiments with various iterations of electronic creations at music centers worldwide including The University of Illinois at Champaign, Columbia-Princeton, Stanford, The University of California Berkeley and San Diego, The San Francisco Tape Music Center (later subsumed into the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music, IRCAM in Paris, Israel Electronic Music Studio, and counterparts in the Nordic countries, Germany, Belgium, etc. Proto âAIâ?\n\nWhile historically interesting I raise this issue to say that, as far as I can tell, âAIâ has not made this writerâs greatest hits list but it is interesting and maybe even useful. With that, my concern for the subject officially goes to the back burner for a later time.\n\n2023 has been a year of great personal changes for the writer of this blog. A job change, a geographical relocation, and many things unrelated to this blog characterized a busy year for New Music Buff. So here in a sort of holiday tradition I present my âBest of 2023â from my little listenerâs corner of the world. For the sake of simplicity I present a more or less chronological exposition of my sonic adventures. (N.B. Not one portion of this article made use of âAIâ).\n\nI begin with not with my 20 most read posts, a practice that characterized previous iterations of this annual exercise. Instead I am providing my top 20 favorite releases that were reviewed in 2023. Please note a couple of caveats. First, I receive a lot of review requests, more than I can even listen to, much less give a reasonably intelligent review. Albums that Iâve not reviewed should not be assumed to be bad or insignificant and my reviews are personal observations. I really only review albums that interest me anyway. Second, this article is only one reviewerâs opinion and not intended to be definitive or to supersede anyone elseâs opinions. Third, this is not the end of my attention to music that was released in 2023. Some releases require more time to give a fair listen and a respectful review. There are more to come in 2024.\n\nFirst a few stats: 2023 saw the publication of some 45 blog posts on New Music Buff, earning me 9693 views for the year. I rarely get comments on my posts (though I welcome and invite comments both positive and negative). Not bad, I think, for the overall less appreciated musical styles that fuel my desire to write about.\n\nNow, in chronological order (of publication) are my personal favorites as a listener:\n\nBinaural Beats in the Tudor Rainforest started my new year with a bang. Reviewing this disc required me to take a closer look at the astounding work of David Tudor and his unique contributions to new music. This important release is a recording of a work which, by its own concept cannot receive a âdefinitiveâ performance. But this recording comes mighty close, involving âbinauralâ recording utilizing a mobile set of binaural microphones which are worn by the recordist. In addition this recording involved a collaboration with Pauline Oliveros and a group called, âComposers Inside Electronicsâ. The recording was done during Oliverosâ tenure at UCSD. Rainforest IV is so called because it is the fourth iteration of the instructions that form the original concepts of Tudorâs composition, âRainforestâ. It is an immersive sonic experience heard on headphones but actually not bad even heard on stereo speakers. A rich and wonderful release.\n\nFrom a 1960s electroacoustic to a budding 21st Century composer Kotoka Suzuki released on the reliably interesting and even visionary Starkland label. Next Gen Electroacoustic: Kotoka Suzuki will introduce the listener to this rising star who doubtless will produce more of her compelling compositions.\n\nIgor Levit is a fine concert pianist whose albums are effectively redefining the way we, as listeners, perceive the western classical oeuvre. Igor Levit: Defining Tristan does for the various musical pieces inspired by the Tristan legend what Levit did for the concept of the great keyboard variations in which he selected Beethovenâs âDiabelli Variationsâ and Frederic Rzewskiâs âEl Pueblo Unido Variationsâ to join his recording of the Bach âGoldberg Variationsâ in a 3 disc package placing these three large sets of variations as emblematic of the genre in three different centuries (18th, 19th, and 20th). Levit, by his recorded output, is providing a valuable perspective which may influence repertory choices for years to come.\n\nLevitâs traversal of the Tristan legend here ranges from the second recording of Hans Werner Henzeâs too seldom heard âTristan Preludesâ back to works by Wagner (of course) and Liszt. He even slips in his wonderful solo piano transcription of the Adagio of Mahlerâs unfinished 10th Symphony into the mix. This is a very compelling Tristan anthology by a deservedly still rising star.\n\nThis Cantaloupe release by Bang on a Can composer and master clarinetist Evan Ziporyn is both masterful and great fun. Evan Ziporyn: Bang on a Pop consists of transcriptions of âpopâ songs for multiple clarinets all played by Ziporyn via his very effective multi-track recordings. The album is very personal and pretty much cliche free with these engaging and insightful transcriptions. It is an homage to the songwriters as well as a showcase for Ziporyn both as composer and as performer.\n\nThe Young Personâs Guide to Ben Johnston is an ideal way to introduce listeners to the wonderful world of the late Ben Johnstonâs music. Johnston, a student and colleague of Harry Partch shows his compositional skills utilizing non-traditional western tunings in these representative works. Johnston here does for some quasi pop tunes what Evan Ziporyn did with his clarinetist perspective for the tunes on Pop Matters. But Johnstonâs pretty, accessible work belies fascinating complexities that donât actually sound complex to the listener. This disc contains Johnstonâs last completed work, âAshokan Farewellâ (which Johnston took to be a public domain folk tune but is in fact a piece written by Jay Ungar). It is paired with the 4th String Quartet (a set of ingenious variations on âAmazing Graceâ) from 1982 and the 9th String Quartet of 1997. Profound, lovely to listen to, and a great homage.\n\nThis DVD is a major addition to the discography of Charles Amirkhanianâs sound poetry as fine sampling of one aspect of Carol Lawâs (Amirkhanianâs life partner) complementary visual art. These collaborations are also important contributions to the visual and performative aspect of these collaborative works. Amirkhanian has been a fine curator and promoter of the work of others but he has rather seldom stepped into the spotlight himself. This quirky genre got some fabulous exposure at the 7 day Other Minds 23 festival in 2018 in which Amirkhanianâs work was presented in the (surprisingly varied) context of sound poetry of the amazing international collection of artists who were hosted at those events. This DVD should be in the collection of anyone interested in new music sound poetry and performance art. It is both entertaining and mind bending featuring a juxtaposition of images and sound reviewed in greater detail in the post âDyadic Dreamsâ. But words cannot do justice to these works. You really have to see them.\n\nReaders of this blog know my fondness for the Chicago based label Cedille and their promotion of Chicago based musicians. This disc stands out in this groupâs embrace of non-traditional composers alongside more traditional works. The inclusion of works by DJ composer Jlin and the academy based genre defying duo Flutronics alongside composers like Danny Elfman and Philip Glass demonstrate the wide ranging repertoire of Third Coast Percussion. Much more information can be found in Perspectives: Spectacular World Premiere Recordings from Third Coast Percussion on my blog. This one reimagines the percussion ensemble.\n\nThis disc is a good example of why listeners and collectors should pay attention to the Neuma record label. Philip Blackburn, who had been the very successful curator of Innova records, took over the defunct Neuma label which was founded with the intention of promoting largely electroacoustic music though not exclusively.\n\nAgnese Toniuttiâs New Music Vision is actually a review of two discs by this rising star, a dedicated new music pianist that needs to be on your radar. The other Neuma disc contains Toniuttiâs traversal of John Cageâs reluctant masterpiece, âSonatas and Interludes for prepared pianoâ.\n\nThe disc pictured here is Toniuttiâs vision beyond the Cage work. This one focuses on mostly living composers Lucia Dlugoszewski, Tan Dun, Philip Corner, and Toniuttiâs herself. Basically, if Toniutti plays it, you should probably at least give a listen.\n\n2023 saw the completion of Bay Area pianist Sarah Cahillâs epic survey of piano music by female composers. Cahill is another (predominantly) new music focused pianist about whom I would also assert that, if she plays it, you should probably give at least one listen.\n\nThe End of the Beginning: Sarah Cahillâs âThe Future is Femaleâ Trilogy Completed will tell you all you need to know about this trilogy which encompasses about 300 years of music history and sheds light on some fascinating and substantial music written by women. Most of the works on this trilogy of albums are, in fact, world premieres but, fear not, even the pieces which are not premieres are likely not in your collection. This is a brilliant selection of music that effectively throws down the gauntlet to challenge other artists to explore this repertory. This trilogy is a true landmark and a joy to the ears.\n\nThis third volume in the wonderful Catalyst Quartetâs survey of another unjustly neglected group of composers focuses on the music of three black Americans of the twentieth century. Catalyzing Blackness, Volume Three: The Catalyst Quartet plays 20th Century music by Black Americans was nominated (but didnât win) for a Grammy Award and, happily, Iâm told that more volumes are in preparation. Again, this music is a pleasant revelation that does for black composers what Sarah Cahill has done for women composers (N.B. The first volume by the Catalyst Quartet focused on the black female composer Florence Price). And hereâs hoping that Coleridge Taylor Perkinson, George Walker and William Grant Still will become household names in the concert hall.\n\nSon of Partch, Carrying on a Tradition is a really wonderful disc which, though I reviewed it in exceedingly positive terms, provoked a strongly negative reaction from the artist. The reaction apparently also provoked enough interest to have made this review one of my most read of 2023.\n\nBut, aside from the unfortunate negative reaction, I still maintain that this is a fine release worthy of attention from anyone who likes new music, microtonality, and the music of Harry Partch. Cris Forster is a composer, theoretician, and instrument builder clearly descended from the Partch tradition. His work deserves attention and this disc is a very satisfying experience.\n\nSteven Schick is a master percussionist and conductor. This release is the first volume of his personal choices of solo percussion repertoire. Solo Percussion Manifesto Volume I: Steven Schickâs âA Hard Rainâ is a manifesto of sorts and does for solo percussion music what Sarah Cahill has done for women composers and the Catalyst Quartet is doing for black composers. There are not many recordings of solo percussion music and Maestro Schick essentially presents his favorite works in definitive performances on a label produced by Bang on a Can cellist Maya Beiser. The second volume is in my review queue and, if this first volume is any indication, it will be a landmark survey.\n\nRising Star Seth Parker Woodsâ âDifficult Graceâ is a Classic in the Making. Hereâs another Grammy nominee that did not win but, this second album by this fine American new music cellist is a winner in my book (er, blog). This is actually the audio of what was developed as a staged performance but the music speaks for itself. Keep an eye/ear out for this rising star who, even now, is storming the new music cello scene in invigorating ways.\n\nA Reason to Listen: Roger Reynoldsâ Latest, âFor a Reasonâ,new recordings on Neuma Records. Here we see Neuma following its original electroacoustic mission with this remarkable set in celebration of Roger Reynoldsâs 90th year. This is a lavish 2 CD box set with a beautiful booklet and lucid liner notes. It is a worthy production which showcases recent works by this prolific and important American composer.\n\nReaders of this blog likely are aware of my interest in music that is suppressed and/or neglected so this disc grabbed my attention immediately. Israel does a great job of funding the arts and this can be seen in the proliferation of truly fine performers nurtured by that funding. Less well known are the composers who have flourished in the art healthy politics of this country. Some 50 years of history are represented here. This is but a sampling, albeit finely curated, of several generations of composers displaying a plurality of styles with substantial results. This entertaining disc will whet the appetites of intelligent and curious listeners and, hopefully, bring about more recognition of the world class composers who deserve an audience.\n\nSo, finally, went my 2023.\n\nIt was the day before Passover and all through the lovely acoustics of the Granada Theater, nostalgia was afoot. It came in the form of a Mozart Overture, a Mahler Symphony, and some new music for clarinet, the klezmer clarinet of David Krakauer. (N.B. Klezmer is a style of playing common to the Ashkenazi Jewish communities of Eastern Europe and Russia).\n\nMaestro Kabarettiâs thoughtfully crafted program featured the integration on non-western vernacular (folk) musics into the western classical idiom. The incorporation of an ageâs popular music into the newly written concert music of that era is a time honored tradition in music history.\n\nTodayâs concert would feature Wolfgang Amadeus Mozartâs imitation of the exotic music (to Viennese audiences) of Turkish Janissary music in the overture to his opera, âThe Abduction from the Seraglioâ. The plot consists of a story that involves a Turkish Pasha who has kidnapped the lover of the leading man. (Spoiler: He rescues her).\n\nThere was a personal nostalgia in that the first opera recording I bought was the budget LP of the Josef Krips conducted performance of that opera. The overture quotes some of the music of the opera and sets the exotic locale with the imitation of Turkish music.\n\nThe relative exoticism of Turkish music was imitated by Mozart in his 5th Violin Concerto, subtitled âTurkishâ, as well. Listeners may recall the imitation of Turkish martial music in the finale of Beethovenâs 9th Symphony (just after the cherub stands before God). Mozartâs inclusion of piccolo, triangle, big drum, and cymbals (rarely seen in classical era orchestras) typify the European imitation of this ethnic music.\n\nMozartâs overture works well as a standalone piece and Kabarettiâs Santa Barbarans stimulated at least this listenerâs sense of nostalgia in a beautifully crafted reading of this music. From the familiar opening notes this overture this listener was transported to nostalgic reverie and simultaneously enthralled by the energetic reading of the work. It was a delightful balance of both nostalgia and an opportunity to somehow hear this work anew.\n\nWhat followed that delightful overture brought featured performer David Krakauer to the stage for a performance of a new (2018) concerto for klezmer clarinet. But before that, we were treated to what Krakauer described as âan arrangementâ of a classic klezmer wedding tune. The affably chatty Krakauer is apparently possessed of a genuine humility here because this was virtually a mini concerto for clarinet and string orchestra whose style had some resemblance to the Mahler Symphony programmed post intermission.\n\nKrakauer is a seriously accomplished musician, composer, musicologist, and teacher. His technical and interpretive skills are of Olympian dimension and his ability to relate to fellow musicians and the audience were a joy to behold. Readers of this blog might recall an earlier review of yet another klezmer concerto also championed by Krakauer. You can read that blog entry here.\n\nThe youngest music by the youngest composer on the program was next. Wlad Marhulets (1986- ) is a Polish born and educated composer. His name had been unfamiliar to me but a quick look at his website and a few listens on YouTube revealed this man to be a marvelously skilled and creative composer. Put this manâs name on your listenerâs radar.\n\nDoubtless our soloist had some input on the performance of this concerto but Marhulets appears to have an in depth understanding of klezmer performance along with a solid grounding in western classical music and a marvelously nuanced skill at orchestration. This is a substantial concerto and a great addition to the repertory.\n\nLike the Mahler Symphony which would follow in the second half of the concert, Mr. Marhulets demonstrated a range of compositional skills. He can evoke humor, terror, nostalgia, joy. He handles a large orchestra augmented by an electric bass guitar and a drum kit. And he has a subtle but effective sense of orchestral color. The soloist, who has a lot to do, winds in and out of passages that pit his clarinet variously against the full orchestra and in duet pairings, sometimes fleetingly, that suggest images of pub, dance hall, and street concerts. All of these the natural milieu of Klezmer music.\n\nThe concerto began loudly, raucously, and assertively. The soloist navigated the complex rhythms and subtle balances of texture as only a master musician can do. Kabaretti and his fine orchestra were clearly up to the significant challenges of this music and clearly enjoyed their labors.\n\nThe loud, declarative, opening gave way to a lovely and lyrical slow movement followed by a long and engaging cadenza, sometimes punctuated briefly at times by the orchestra. It then led into a really fun (though hardly trite) finale.\n\nFollowing a richly deserved standing ovation, Krakauer and the orchestra gifted the audience with an encore. Echoes of klezmer in the many moods evoked by this afternoonâs music making left this listener reflecting on the chaos in our world here, in this beautiful hall, in this beautiful city, on the eve of Passover. I fancy that there is a gentle activism here, one in which the sharing of the beauty of a cultureâs esteemed artists (composers and performers) acts as a proud display of some of the best that that culture has to offer. The quality of the music and the music making canât fix the worldâs problems but they can give us hope and joy. Great art elevates the soul. At least thatâs what this reviewer felt.\n\nThe intermission was needed to replenish listenersâ emotional reserves for the second half. No doubt the musicians needed to recharge as well.\n\nThe Mahler First Symphony (1888) triggers more personal nostalgia for two reasons. One, my first Mahler purchase was the Bruno Walter reading of this and the ninth symphony. Second, I will forever associate that first movement depicting dawn in its opening. Astute listeners may recognize television and film composer Alexander Courageâs appropriation of this music in his now iconic theme for the original Star Trek series (which debuted in 1964 when your humble reviewer was 9 years old). I would encounter Mahler some years later.\n\nIt is difficult over 100 years after the symphonyâs premiere to understand how radical this music seemed to players and listeners. Its Budapest premiere has been described as a disaster mediated by uncooperative musicians in the orchestra and an unsympathetic audience. After his death in 1911, Mahlerâs compositional star rose to new heights when the late, great Leonard Bernstein championed his work during his long and fruitful career, even reintroducing Mahlerâs music to the Vienna of its beginnings. This is the Vienna where Maestro Kabaretti was trained. And he gets this music deeply.\n\nTo be fair, this piece presents many challenges for players and conductors but, when it is well done, it thrills audiences. Maestro Kabaretti and his Santa Barbarans delivered as fine a performance of this symphony that this reviewer has heard. It was positively thrilling and, unlike the musicians who played in the disastrous premiere, the Santa Barbara Symphony clearly enjoyed their hard work and respected their leader.\n\nThis was a thrilling and invigorating concert experience. The hometown orchestra put in a world class performance and our esteemed soloist was matched in his expertise by their skills. The nearly full house was most obviously pleased as was this reviewer.\n\nThere are many ways to debut on the world stage and there are many ways to represent political activism. Violist NoÃ©mie Chemali has chosen, as her important first impression in her recorded debut, a selection of music from young composers whose heritage includes political oppression. The albums profits are promised to MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders. These works are not directly political, rather they are a carefully curated selection of new works produced by composers who, in varying degrees, have experiences of dealing with or having friends and family whose lives are negatively impacted by political conflicts and oppression. This is gorgeous music by emerging talents.\n\nThe good news is that these wonderfully creative artists persevere in creating great art and it is the celebration of that creative drive that lies at the heart of this fine release. While the pieces here variously reference tunings, rhythms, and melodies representative of their individual ethnic heritages, they are not confrontational. Rather the music here stands as evidence of the beauty of artistic invention which stands defiantly in contrast to the cruelty of oppression and warfare. That gentle activism casts a kinder and gentler image of people more commonly represented in the media as terrorists (actually a numerical minority) in a culture with ancient roots and a powerful artistic soul (the better descriptor of the actual majority).\n\nLinks to the composersâ web sites can be accessed by clicking the names of said composers.\n\nThe albumâs contents are as follows:\n\nWajdi Abou Diab (1991- )\n\n1. âThe Morabaâ Danceâ (2020)\n\nThis, the composerâs Opus 13C, is based on an Arabic rhythm called âAl Mourabaâ. It is for solo viola and is cast in the unusual meter of 13/4, using an Arabic scale. The music imitates traditional music which ostensibly enticed horses to dance in times past.\n\nSami Seif (1998- )\n\n2. âLaâib an-nard / The Dice Playerâ (2019)\n\nThis musical impression of a poem of the same name by Mahmoud Darwish. It is, in the composerâs description, a meditation on the random elements that affect our lives. It is scored for viola, cello, and double bass.\n\nLayale Chaker (1990- )\n\n3. Cadenza from âThe Brown Textsâ; movement one (2017-2020)\n\n4. Cadenza from âThe Brown Textsâ;movement two\n\nThe term âcadenzaâ derives from the word âcadenceâ and it generally refers to the improvisations (by the soloist) in a concerto. The notion of a solo cadenza does not appear, as far as this listenerâs encounters, until the mid to late twentieth century. Pendereckiâs Cadenza for Viola is the only example that immediately comes to mind. Though that work is sometimes performed separate from the viola concerto from which it derives, its origin is in the classical/romantic tradition of a virtuoso work that displays the skills of the soloist. As with the previous work, this one is a musical rendition of originally poetic ideas, those of the late Nadia Tueni. And, unlike any other cadenza Iâve known, it is cast in two separate movements. The piece is a fine showcase for Ms. Chemaliâs technical and interpretive skills.\n\nNoemie Chemali:\n\n5. âKadishatâ (2021)\n\nDelightfully, Ms. Chemali has chosen to include one of her own compositions. She describes this as a set of variations on the ancient Aramaic Trisagion âQadishat alohoâ, a tune which has been firmly ensconced in the composer/performerâs consciousness from having heard it since her childhood. One could characterize it as one of the greatest hits of the Eastern Orthodox Church and one of its most deeply felt pieces. Chemali casts this work for violin, viola, and cello. This writer is reminded of another fine example of the incorporation of sacred hymns into the classical music tradition, that of Carolyn Shawâs fine âIn Manus Tuasâ which mines that composerâs memory of hearing a sacred chant. Both works reflect the composerâs internal process of hearing and attempt to convey that spiritual experience to the listener.\n\nMary Kouyoumdjian (1983- ):\n\n6. âThe Revolt of the Starsâ (2018/2020)\n\nThis piece, another musical expression of a literary work, namely, the Armenian fable that provides the title for this work which is cast for cello, voice, and electronics. It is presented here in a transcription for viola by the soloist. The fable deals with the strength in numbers that rise up against those in positions of power. It is a delightful work with dark implications.\n\nSaad Haddad (1992- ):\n\n7. âDohreeâ (movements 1&2)\n\n8. âDohreeâ (movement 3)\n\nThis work, scored for viola, harp, and flute is cleverly written in three movements which, in turn, each give a solo to each of the musicians who are, in turn, accompanied by the others in the group. âDohreeâ is an Arabic word which translates as âmy turnâ.\n\nSix pieces over eight tracks with chamber groups ranging from solo viola to viola with electronics (in the Kouyoumdjian work) and small chamber groupings in the others. All in all a fine and engaging selection of music that bear witness to the beauty and creativity of people living with oppression. This music reflects the human experience that can get erased by merely identifying ethnicity.\n\nIn addition to Ms. Chemali this recording includes the following musicians: Shaleah Feinstein, violin; Raffi Boden, violoncello; Kebra-Seyoun Charles, double bass; Lauren Scanio, flute; Deanna Cirielli, harp. They really do honor to the spirit of this music and this album is beautifully recorded as well.\n\nKouyoumdjian was the only composer known to this reviewer prior to hearing this album but she is apparently in very good company here and listeners would do well to make note of these rising stars. We will doubtless hear from them again. Hereâs hoping.\n\nThis is the artistâs biography as it appears on her website (linked above):\n\nFrench-Lebanese-American violist NoÃ©mie Chemali received her Bachelorâs degree from McGill Universityâs Schulich School of Music, her Artist Diploma from the Robert McDuffie Center for Strings at Mercer University, and her Masterâs Degree from The Juilliard School. Her principal teachers include Becca Albers, Hsin-Yun Huang, and Carol Rodland.\n\nDuring her time at Juilliard, she made her Carnegie Weill Hall solo debut in the UN Chamber Music Societyâs Arabic Language Day concert and collaborated with dancers of the New York City Ballet. During her time at the McDuffie Center for Strings, she performed alongside faculty members of the Cavani and Ehnes String Quartets. In 2019, she also performed in âA Night of Georgia Music,â a tour the American South with violinist Robert McDuffie, guitarist Mike Mills of the band R.E.M., and pianist Chuck Leavell of the Allman Brothers Band/Rolling Stones. Some performance highlights from McGill include playing a concert with clarinetist David Krakauer in a program of Klezmer music, being selected to perform a chamber work by John Rea in a concert presented by the SociÃ©tÃ© de musique contemporaine du QuÃ©bec (SMCQ) alongside Schulich faculty and students, and participating in the 2018 Musical Chairs Chamber Music Festival, where she collaborated with students from the Mozarteum (Austria) and the Yong Siew Toh Conservatory of Music (Singapore).\n\nNoemie has spent her summers at music festivals such as The Music Academy of the West, Sarasota Music Festival, Orford Musique, The Lunenburg Academy of Music Performance (LAMP), Scotia Festival of Music, Manhattan in the Mountains, and Green Mountain music festivals. While Ms. Chemali was a fellow at the Music Academy of the West, she played under the baton of esteemed conductors Larry Rachleff, StÃ©phane DenÃ¨ve, Gustavo Dudamel, and James Conlon. While at Sarasota Music Festival, she served as principal violist of the festival orchestra under the baton of Jeffrey Kahane and performed in a faculty concert as a member of a quintet with bassoonist Frank Morelli. She has, throughout the years, participated in various masterclasses with artists such as Joseph Silverstein, Ida Kavafian, Cynthia Phelps, Karen Dreyfus, Richard OâNeill, James Dunham, Jutta Puchhammer and the Pacifica String Quartet.\n\nPassionate about diversifying musical audiences, she co-founded the Hildegard Project, which aims to bring music written by women composers to womenâs shelters in the greater Montreal area and was invited to speak about her work at the Classical Evolution/Revolution Conference in Santa Barbara, CA. Most recently, she founded Music@Daybreak, an interdisciplinary performance and research project which features performances at homeless shelters in collaboration with the Sociology department at Mercer University.\n\nNoÃ©mie is the recipient of a Juilliard Career Grant, George J. Jakob Global Enrichment Grant, Gluck Community Engagement Fellowship, Juilliard Entrepreneurship Grant, Barenboim-Said Foundation (USA) Grant, and a Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Creative Engagement Grant. In January 2024, she will be releasing Opus 961, her debut album of music written by contemporary Lebanese composers.\n\nHer website includes some YouTube videos reflecting the artistâs fascinating choices of repertory. Along with fervent activism, she demonstrates a pretty unique take on what she chooses to play. Her biography evidences an eclectic group of collaborators and influences that will likely characterize her career.\n\nThis is quite an impressive first impression from an artist who greets us at the beginnings of what this reviewer believes will be a long and interesting career representing a new generation of musicians with a unique and (hopefully more effective) approach to the ills of our age. Great art inspires, if not action, at least hope. And we desperately need hope. Thanks for that Ms. Chemali.\n\nThe primary importance of this new release is, of course, the presentation of these two major works but it also an exposition of the diversity (or do you prefer, âheterogeneityâ?) that can become obscured by well intended terms like, âLatinoâ and âHispanicâ, or even conductor Gustavo Dudamelâs âPan Americanâ. All are well intended but racial, nationalist, and other categories are insufficient on their own in recognizing the rich diversity inherent in their cultures. Here we go, just in time for Latin History Month.\n\nThe concise liner notes tell us that even the albumâs title, âFandangoâ has multiple meanings depending on cultural contexts. The fact is that no single style or genre can be said to be representative of the marvelous diversity that exists within their intended scope which attempts to represent practically the whole of the western hemisphere as is the case with this release. So, while Fandango is certainly about the musical works presented, it also touches on the issue of diversity by the choice of two major works separated chronologically by some 80 years and representing composers from Argentina on the one hand, and Mexico on the other. Two different cultures that share a language in both words and , to some extent, music.\n\nThe centerpiece of this album is, of courses, the concerto that Maestra Akiko-Meyers commissioned from Mexican composer Arturo MÃ¡rquez Navarro (1950- ). Iâm sad to say that I am only now learning of this composer but delighted in his mastery of the orchestra and the grand romantic gestures of a past era along with an acute and personal appreciation of the folk idioms of his culture. At first I was skeptical of a âmariachiâ inspired concerto because such attempts, even the most sincere, donât always seem to work. Well, that is certainly not the case here. This is a strong contender for regular inclusion in the current canon of widely performed violin concertos. This one is a masterpiece which poses challenges to the soloist (which give her a chance to show her virtuosity) and surround it with rich, subtly, ultimately beautiful orchestral textures that support the soloist but which demand much of the orchestra and its conductor as well.\n\nThe concerto (written in 2020) is in the traditional three movements. The first, entitled âFolia Tropicalâ (tropical leaves) embraces the spirit of late romantic concerti like those of Bruch and Brahms. It is an extended movement that introduces and develops many moods and themes. It is a big symphonic movement worthy of a symphony and it gives the soloist much to do and upon which to demonstrate her musical and interpretive skills all the while with a very busy orchestra accompanying her.\n\nThe second movement, âPlegariaâ (prayer) is a hugely substantive chaconne, the baroque contrapuntal variation form with a repeating bass line and thematic variations over the harmonic structures supported by those notes.. At least that is my listenerâs understanding. But what is not necessary to âunderstandâ technically is the emotional impact of this movement. This is an amazing use of the form. The soloist moves into different roles, sometimes very much upstage, sometimes an adjunct to the orchestra, sometimes not there at all. There is a slow, meditative beauty in this movement which is also characteristic of the romantic idiom in which this is written.\n\nThe third movement, âFandanguitoâ (little Fandango) is a somewhat lighter and very energetic finale one might expect in a movement following the previous deeply emotional ones. And the composer does not disappoint. He writes a joyous, energetic finale which nonetheless stands up as substantially as its predecessors.\n\nThe joy, to this listener, is to hear a master composer in collaboration with a fine soloist both technically and interpretively. The composer has integrated his experiences and study of his own cultural folk musics and infuses the spirit of the music into his grand romantic idiom. That is, the concerto does not, for the most part use direct quotation from folk sources but uses structural elements in his composition. Maestra Akiko Meyers discharges her soloist duties with both startling facility and a deep understanding of the music and the composerâs intent.\n\nGustavo Dudamel is a joyfully rising star who brings his cultural proclivities and his own lens on western orchestral music. He is an exciting and incisive conductor. I donât know the extent of Dudamelâs study of Latin folk musics but he really gets this work and brings out the composerâs subtleties in this gorgeous and exciting concerto.\n\nThe âB sideâ as they used to be called is no mere filler, it is the entirety of the Alberto Ginastera (1916-1983) ballet, âEstanciaâ Op. 8 (1941). Here, 15 separate movements are used in a five scene scenario. The work, usually heard in its four movement suite format and, even more frequently, just the spectacular finale, the Malambo.\n\nIn addition to its large orchestra, the ballet calls for a singer/speaker soloist who acts as both narrator and as soloist with orchestra. In this performance the challenge is admirably met by baritone GUSTAVO CASTILLO, another shining light cultivated by El Sistema. He performs well in both his baritone vocal duties and his narrator task in which he speaks Spanish in an elegant and, Iâd say, almost Shakespearean grasp of the beauty of the language. The man understands drama as well as music.\n\nThis ballet is clearly a masterpiece. It reminds this listener of Prokofiev if he was born in Argentina. Nothing derivative here though. This is an intensely entertaining work, as substantial as Romeo and Juliet, similarly constructed in relatively brief musical segments designed to accompany a dance whose scenario is the story of the âgauchoâ or cowboy that lived and worked hard lives, lives that were romanticized into a poem by Argentinian poet JosÃ© HernÃ¡ndez (1834-1886). (click on the word âpoemâ for a link to an English translation of the poem).\n\nAll that to say that this is a truly enjoyable and important release. A valuable addition to the discography of Latin classical music.\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge begat Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, who begat Coleridge Taylor Perkinsonâ¦ Wait, thatâs not right. But these three men, listed in chronological order, became intertwined, much as they were admired, by their names. Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1792-1834) is the great (white) British poet. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875-1912), named in honor of that poet (and the subject of this review) was a much lauded, though subsequently neglected British composer, as it happens a black British composer. Taylor Coleridge Perkinson (1932-2004), a much lauded and subsequently neglected black American composer named in honor of those predecessors. Stick with me, this comes together (for the purposes of this review) with the name of the orchestra on this recording, âChinekeâ, a word taken from the African Igbo religion, meaning, âGodâ. Add an exclamation point and you get âChineke!â, the orchestra which was founded in 2015 by the double bass player, Chi-chi Nwanoku CBE, to provide career opportunities for Black and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe.\n\nAll that to introduce listeners to this landmark of the recording industry, fulfilling in part the mission of this fine orchestra. This two CD set provides an intelligent selection of the music of Samuel Taylor-Coleridge which is nothing short of revelatory. Knowledge (at least outside of Britain) of his music, up until this release pretty much limited to his fine choral work âHiawathaâs Wedding Feastâ and perhaps a short orchestra movement. The late great Paul Freeman included an aria from that choral work and one movement (Danse Negre) from his African Suite in his defining set of recordings on Columbia/Sony, âBlack Composersâ. These brief pieces were the introduction for many people, this writer included, to this composerâs work.\n\nChineke! now presents a far more representative selection of this manâs work with a truly nice touch of alreleasing the first recording of music by Coleridge-Taylorâs daughter Gwendolyn Avril Coleridge-Taylor (1903-1998) who wrote under the pen name Peter Riley (it is hardly a secret that both black people and women suffer from lack of recognition in the world of classical music).\n\nColeridge-Taylorâs output was large, comprising some 82 pieces with opus numbers and unpublished works as well. Thatâs a lot of music from a man who died at age 37 from pneumonia. This two disc set does a very nice job of presenting music from all eras of his brief career. From the Opus 2 Nonet (1894) to the Opus 80 Violin Concerto (1912) this release provides a larger perspective on this artist (dubbed by white musicians in New York, in what today would be judged a pejorative appellation, âThe Black Mahlerâ). My guess is that the same people who would speak condescendingly about Coleridge-Taylor were also not appreciative of that Jewish Austrian conductor/composer.\n\nThough it appears that all these works have appeared previously in recordings (appropriately on mostly British labels) this collection does a great service in demonstrating the arc of his truncated lifeâs work. Only the Avril Coleridge-Taylor work, âSussex Landscapeâ (1940), is a world premiere recording.\n\nFor the purposes of this review I will be discussing these works in chronological order rather than the order on the recordings. Even a short career demonstrably goes through changes over time, led by social, political, historical, and musical experiences. A photo (above) shows the order on the discs.\n\nThe Nonet Op. 2 (1894) for strings, winds, and piano was written by the 19 year old (still a student at the Royal College of Music). This unusual combination, nearly a chamber orchestra in dimension as is the grand, late romantic, Brahmsian dimension. His skill in orchestration is evident here and serves to clarify the musical lines in these four large movements. It is virtually a symphony with a virtuoso piano obbligato.\n\nHere, emissaries of the nascent Harlem Renaissance came to England in the the form of a 1896 concert by the Fisk Jubilee Singers who presented a program of âNegro Spiritualsâ (Fisk is one of the so called âHistorically Black Colleges and Universitiesâ which were formed to provide educational opportunities for Black Americans who were barred from admittance to other colleges). The following year Coleridge-Taylor met the Black American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906), who had come to England on a literary tour. His parents were freed slaves in Kentucky. Both of these experiences had a profound effect on Coleridge-Taylor and his music. Coleridge-Taylor would attend the first Pan-African Conference in London in July 1900. There he would explore the ideas and philosophies of Pan-Africanism which emphasised the importance of a shared African heritage. The orchestral works âBallade in A minorâ Op. 33 and the âAfrican Suiteâ Op. 35, (both 1898) reflect those influences.\n\nThe two movement Ballade is a grand romantic work with no particular program but one that demonstrates the composerâs amazing command of the orchestra. The African Suite, one of his more popular works, was directly influenced by the work of Dunbar (whose career, like Coleridge-Taylorâs, also ended prematurely).\n\nThe two movement âRomanceâ Op. 39 (1899) for violin and orchestra is a foreshadowing of the later Violin Concerto. It is a heavily late romantic work with a beautiful and substantial violin part.\n\nHis âPetite Suiteâ Op. 77 (1911) is among his most popular works and arguably served as a precursor to what would later be termed, âLight Musicâ. The second movement strikes deep into this writerâs memory as one of those pieces whose charm prompted me to find out what it was so I might hear it again. Very charming and immediately listener friendly music.\n\nThe first work on this set, The five movement, âOthelloâ Orchestral Suite Op. 79 was published in 1909 and first performed in 1911. It was conceived and written as an orchestral suite, not a suite of music drawn from another work and is complete as performed here. It is a stunning example of the composerâs skills with orchestration and with dramatic writing.\n\nNow we come to the Op. 80 Violin Concerto of 1911-2 which is dedicated to American violinist Maud Powell, a staunch advocate for female musicians, black composers, and new music in general (an early model for the likes of Rachel Barton Pine). This work of high late romanticism echoes Brahms and Bruch in its Melodieâs, itâs harmonies, and the grand sweep of its gorgeously orchestrated three movements. It is easy to imagine this as a regular repertoire piece.\n\nLast and most certainly not least is the world premiere recording by Coleridge-Taylorâs daughter, Gwendoline Avril Coleridge-Taylor (1903-1998), her âSussex Landscapeâ Op. 27 (1940). This is just a taste of her 60+ compositions but it is compelling enough to prompt listeners (and hopefully progressive organizations such as âChineke!â) to pursue more exploration of her oeuvre.\n\nChineke! Truly achieves their goal in producing this wonderful portrait of a composer whose work has, until very recently languished in relative obscurity. Even this writer, whose obsessive interest in the new and interesting, has been seriously transformed by this release. You really have to hear this release. My thanks and congratulations to everyone involved in this fine Chineke! release.\n\nUtter the name âIsraelâ and probably only a handful of people will think, âclassical musicâ. As a lifelong new music fan Iâve made many wonderful discoveries by looking at work done by composers in countries that arenât part of the typical America, Germany, Italy, France, Russia nexus. Throw in the Nordic countries, Canada, and Australia more recently and you have perhaps 90% of what is marketed (even if not efficiently distributed) as new classical music. Israel, at 75, remains a young country but its participation with world class classical composers and musicians is among their proudest contributions to the world at large and those contributions are both extensive and interesting.\n\nThis fine release gives only the briefest taste with a curious selection of pieces that will likely lead listeners to the âmore where that came fromâ path to discover a huge trove of music that really needs to be heard. The only problem with this release is that itâs not a 20 or 30 CD box set of representative western classical music from a comparatively new country in a very old artistic/cultural hotbed.\n\nThis fine Neuma release is actually a very nice taste whetting collection of three generations of Israeli composers. I wish I could call it ârepresentativeâ but that would be a tall order. It is an intelligent selection that will hopefully inspire further exploration of Israelâs classical music artistic legacy. Israel is, in many ways, a country of challenges and this release is, similarly, an extension of this countryâs challenges to the canon of western art music in its way and a gentle nudge to curious listeners.\n\nThis project began with a 1986 Israel residency by American composer/musicologist (now Professor Emeritus at NIU) Robert Fleisher. The culmination of this residency resulted in his marvelous book, âTwenty Israeli Composersâ (1997) and all but one track on this disc from an earlier concert at NIU in 1987. which was fortunately recorded rather nicely. You can download the book for free by clicking on the title above. Fleisher wrote the very useful liner notes which are also available as a free download. Those two sources can help guide the avid listener to a wider range of music from Israelâs first 75 years.\n\nGerman refugee Paul Frankenburger (1897-1984), better known as Paul Ben-Haim is doubtless the one name in this collection that listeners may have heard. He emigrated to the (then British Mandate of Palestine) in 1933 just ahead of the onslaught of the Third Reich in Germany. He Hebraicized his name when he became an Israeli citizen at that countryâs inception in 1948. Truly, he was there at the beginning.\n\nHis pupils Tvi Avni, Eliahu Inbal, Henri Lazarof, Ami Maayani, Ben-Zion Orgad, and Shulamit Ran (to name just a few) all went on to make significant impacts on the musical world. Some made their careers in Israel, others established the Israeli artistic diaspora but that is another story.\n\nThe disc opens with one of Ben-Haimâs finest and best known compositions, his 1943 protominimal âToccataâ for piano. This brief piece is a virtuoso showpiece that this listener found immediately appealing having heard it played as an encore after a concerto performance. Here, a wonderful rendition by Liora Ziv-Li makes a strong case for this piece to be heard more often. This first release of this live performance is, happily, not the only recording of the work. Ben-Haim whose style is of a post romantic/nationalistic style somewhat like an Israeli Aaron Copland, creative and nationalist with just a dash of liturgical. His work is fairly well represented on recordings and on YouTube but he is far less known outside his adopted country where his pedagogy also sowed further seeds.\n\nThis second track is one of two (with Tsippi Fleischerâs âThe Gown of Nightâ) that did not appear on the 1987 concert referenced in the intro. Bashrav (2004) by Betty Olivero (the first Israeli born composer represented on this recording) was recorded in Tel Aviv in 2020. The inclusion of this work can stand as a challenge to get listeners to hear one of the finest living composers from Israel. Olivero (1954- ) is very well known in Israel but less so elsewhere despite the fact that some major American orchestras have embraced her work. She is a lyrical and substantive composer whose work is quite appealing. Bashrav is an instrumental chamber orchestra piece based on a Turkish/Iranian musical form from which the workâs title is drawn. It was commissioned and first performed by the San Francisco Contemporary Chamber Players. This is the first commercial recording.\n\nNow we come to another name changer. Tzvi Avni (1927- ) was born Hermann Jakob Steinke in Saarbrucken, Germany. He, like Ben-Haim (with whom he later studied) fled Germany (in 1935) for the safety of the British Mandate of Palestine and took a name reflecting his adopted national alliance. Avni is probably the second best known Israeli composer outside of Israel. His somewhat Stravinskian (to this listenerâs ears) neoclassicism is another voice seriously in need of a wider hearing. His brief Capriccio (1955/1975) for piano has had several recordings and performances and the release of this live recording provides an opportunity to hear the work as well as the opportunity to hear another artistâs interpretation of the work. Avni had the foresight to tap into the emerging world of electronic and computer music and added a stint at the justly famed Columbia Princeton Electronic Music Studio to his musical training. Sadly, though he may have name recognition, his representation in recordings is nothing short of abysmal.\n\nAmi Maayani (1936-2019) is, in this writerâs opinion, the third best known composer of those represented here outside of Israel. He was the founder of several fine Israeli music ensembles including the Israel Youth Orchestra. Like Avni, he chose to supplement his traditional music studies at the fledgling Columbia Princeton Electronic Music Center. He also counts Paul Ben-Haim among his teachers. His musical style derives from Arabic traditional music (one of the few folk musics routinely incorporating the microtonal quarter tone) as well as Ashkenazi and Sephardic folk music. In addition to training in music, he studied architecture and has written several books.\n\nWhile he has written more experimental work, the majority of his available music sounds basically tonal with folk and sometimes electronic elements. Maayani was a prolific composer who, like his âbest knownâ colleagues, suffers from a distribution problem. His architectural work is represented in several portions of Israelâs infrastructure. His three volume study in Hebrew of Richard Wagner challenged Israelâs (understandable) dislike of Wagnerâs music. And now time is nigh for a fair reckoning of Maayaniâs own music. This is not the first recording of his Arabesque No. 2 (1973) scored for flute and harp. His sister Ruth Maayani (1948-1921), herself an accomplished musician plays the harp in this 1987 performance. His orchestral work, âQumranâ (1970) was the first Israeli composition to be performed in Germany after World War II (even that took nearly thirty years to achieve).\n\nNow we come to another refugee from early to mid century European fascism. Abel Ehrlich (1915-2003) was born in east Prussia and took a more circuitous route to Israel, arriving in the Palestine Mandate in 1939. Unlike some of his predecessors he made no changes to his name. He did study at the Eretz-Israel Conservatory in Jerusalem and went on to write music and teach at Israel Conservatory, the Rubin Academy of Music, Jerusalem; the Rubin Academy of Music, Tel Aviv; Bar-Ilan University and Oranim Academic College. He was of an age that didnât create a web page but even Wikipedia has very little to say about him except that he was recognized during his lifetime with various prizes and I was able to find this laudatory 2004 concert review in Haâaretz which reports a count of some 3500 compositions (sic)! It also makes mention of one of his best known compositions, his 1953 âBashravâ for solo violin. This is a piece based on the Arabic musical form for which it is named. Astute listeners/readers will recognize the name from the earlier Betty Olivero work with which it shares both its name and structure. Would that a performance could have been included here but listeners can easily find several recordings of that other Bashrav on YouTube.\n\nAbel is represented on this recording by two works, both from 1986 and both world premiere recordings from the 1987 concert that forms the core of this album. Track five documents a piano work called, âThe Death of Dan Pagisâ. It is a sort of lament for Pagis (1930-1986) some of whose poetry Abel set musically but was sadly never heard by the poet. Track eight gives us a hearing of Ehrlichâs âThe Dream About Strange Terrorsâ for two flutes. Both are brief but effective works and, like much of the music here (and a lot of art) seem to be a form of sublimation, a Freudian derived term which refers to an adaptive psychological mechanism, a transformation of pain, anxiety, anger, etc. into something positive. The otherwise informative liner notes say little about these two works but given the composerâs history, both works would seem to fall into that category. Both are in a sort of mid century post romantic style that challenge the performers but speak pretty directly, in a musical sense, to the listener.\n\nTrack six introduces us to another native born Israeli composer, Tsippi Fleischer (1948- ). This one is a graphic score which is realized electronically. âThe Gown of Nightâ (1988) is a setting of a poem. It is performed in the original Arabic. The English translation is below.\n\nTHE GOWN OF NIGHT\n\nMuhammad Ghanaâim\n\nThe gown of night\n\nEnvelops the desert\n\nEngulfing tent and well\n\nFrom the boundaries of night\n\nThe howling of jackals descends\n\nTo raise the dawn\n\nEngulfing tent and well\n\nThen came the dawn â¦\n\nA portion of the graphic score is reproduced in both physical and digital formats of the album. It is one of the pieces that has actually been released before but those releases on small limited distribution independent labels has likely remained obscure to all but the most tenacious listeners and collectors. It is a fine example of purely electronic music and was composed using recordings of Bedouin children reciting the poem.\n\nI was astounded and oh so pleased to learn that all of Fleischerâs recorded output (including liner notes) is available for free downloads via her website the link for which can be accessed by clicking on the composerâs name in this review. Well, brava Maestra Fleischer for striking a blow against obscurity.\n\nArie Shapira (1915-2013) is another substantial and prolific composer with no personal website, no government generated website, no publisher generated website, and a way too brief Wikipedia page. In fact Professor Fleisherâs book remains the âgo toâ resource for this manâs work. A quick look on the discogs site, not surprisingly, list only two CD releases.\n\nHe is represented in this collection by âOff Pianoâ (1984) written for the Michal Tal who performs it here. The 1984 premiere was broadcast by Israeli media. This all too brief work immediately suggested the pianistic fireworks of Frederic Rzewski.\n\nTracks nine, ten, and eleven comprise the second largest offering by time of all the composers on this album. The âThree Romancesâ (1986) for piano by Ari Ben-Shabetai (1954- )The works, premiered in 1986 and were written for Liora Ziv-Li whose 1987 performance are on the present disc. Ostensibly an homage to Robert Schumannâs similarly titled work are a modernist and highly virtuosic set of pieces.\n\nLastly we have by far the longest offering of music of all the represented composers with Oded Zehaviâs âWireâ (1986) for chamber orchestra and soprano (Zehavi plays the piano part in the ensemble). Born in 1961, he is by far the youngest composer this collection. Wire is a setting of a poem in Hebrew by Chaya Shenhav, English text given below.\n\nChaya Shenhav, âStrange Brightness,â\n\n(âThread: Poemsâ), Hakibbutz Hameuchad\n\nPublishers Ltd, 1984, p. 22; Translated by\n\nOded Zehavi. Â©All rights reserved.\n\nIn those awful shadowless\n\nminutes before sunset\n\nwhen greenish lights rise\n\nfrom the valley\n\nWhen the trees on the slopes\n\nglow with a sudden great light\n\nbut beingless, perhaps,\n\nAnd the children slowly climb the path,\n\ntheir faces shining with a strange brightness . . .\n\nCall out to them quickly, âspeak,â âshout,â\n\nlike the partridges screaming in the valley\n\nscream,\n\nYou see, you know, donât you?\n\nthat they are moving away\n\nThis release is a testament to Professor Fleisherâs musicological efforts that help raise awareness that Israel has some truly world class composers of new classical music. It is also a fine place for listeners to begin their explorations of this repertoire.\n\nThis is Tim Bradyâs fourth Starkland release, a distinction shared by only two other composers, the late Tod Dockstader and (the delightfully very much living) Guy Klucevsek. And given the impressive track record of the Starkland labelâs ability to find and promote innovative composers and performers who later achieve much wider recognition, this is an event that demands serious attention.\n\nWith a catalog presently numbering some 39 plus CDs and a CV that boasts 4 operas and a massive catalog of compositions for ensembles ranging from solo to large orchestra, this proudly Canadian composer has mounted (metaphorically, of course) an invasion from the United Stateâs northern border of his distinctive artistic vision prompting this reviewer to suggest a comparison to the pop âinvasionâ of the Beatles in the early 60s.\n\nMy admittedly tongue in cheek Beatles comparison is not meant to eclipse the incredible artistry of this obviously very industrious artist. My previous reviews compared his work to electric guitar giants like Rhys Chatham and the late Glenn Branca. But this only serves to illuminate a fraction of this manâs work. I invite listeners to peruse his well organized website to get a perspective.\n\nBut let me get back to this release. It is undoubtedly a bold move to use the term âsymphonyâ to describe a work for a solo artist. Charles Valentine Alkan (1813-1888) wrote a symphony for solo piano (opus 39 nos. 4-10 from 1857) Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji (1892-1988) referred to his third piano sonata (1922) as a symphony and later wrote six more symphonies for solo piano between 1938 and 1976. And more recently the late Glenn Branca (1948-2018) wrote several works for various configurations of guitars he called symphonies. But this is the first symphony written expressly for solo guitar as far as I can determine.\n\nâSymphony in 18 Parts for solo electric guitar (2021) â 50 minutes\n\nFor solo electric guitar, FX pedals and looper, in 18 movementsâ as it is listed on the composerâs website is (if I counted correctly) his 8th Symphony. Brady apparently numbers his symphonies in order of composition without reference to instrumentation. While several of his symphonies involve one or more electric guitars, this is the first solo guitar work to which he gives the weighty title of âSymphonyâ (unless, as noted above, you count the solo version of Symphony No. 5).\n\nThe term âsymphonyâ carries with it connotations, at least, of grandeur, painstaking structure, and serious music making. And this work is very serious and meticulously constructed. It is, of course, reflective of a mid career composer who has written a great deal and has learned from that experience. It has as much a right to be called a âsymphonyâ as any similarly large and painstakingly written piece of music.\n\nFirst, let me say that, other than a tendency to use one (or a lot more than one) electric guitar in his music, Bradyâs music has relatively little in common with Glenn Branca and Rhys Chatham. In fact, Brady seems to have more in common with Steve Reich and Elliott Sharp. But while Chatham and Branca emerged from a music scene dominated by punk in all its iterations, Brady seems more connected to the Beatles and Les Paul.\n\nThe work is divided into 18 sections, each running a modest 1.5 to just under 5 minutes. It is a structure similar in this listeners mind to American composer Alan Hovhaness (1911-2008), whose Symphony No. 9 (1949-50) âSt. Vartanâ, a similarly epic masterpiece in no fewer than 24 short movements. It is the interrelatedness of those movements that make them a part of the whole symphony. And so it is with Bradyâs Symphony. David Lang (Pulitzer Prize Winner and founding Bang on a Canâ member) says essentially this in his segment of the liner notes that come with the recording. Tim Brady acknowledges much the same in his segment of the liner notes.\n\nThe cover art by fellow adventuring guitarist and composer Elliott Sharp is functionally an homage to Brady and his work. The recording by Tim Brady and Morris Apelbaum, mastered by Brady, Apelbaum, and John Klepko is lucid (and great on headphones especially when Brady pans the sounds across the stereo field).\n\nThe 18 movements all have titles which are metaphorically related to the music therein. David Lang aptly describes these varied and intense movements as sort of biographical statements about what the composer can do with his instrument. Each movement has both form and development much as one would expect of a symphonic movement.\n\nOn the one hand, this symphony is not easy listening. On the other hand it is likely catnip to electric guitarists as well as to new music enthusiasts including your humble reviewer. Bradyâs Canadian invasion, far from a takeover, is simply a musician sharing his substantial art from across the northern border and presenting his latest efforts. Like the Beatles, Brady deserves to be welcomed. This prolific composer/performer/teacher/innovator has interesting things to say.\n\nAt first I attempted to write something about each of the 18 movements but I donât think that would have added anything useful for prospective listeners. This piece taken as a whole most aptly deserves the descriptor âtour de forceâ as each movement seems to have its own character deriving from the composerâs use of various (apparently deeply studied and judiciously chosen) techniques and ideas which sometimes threaten to overwhelm the listener, sometimes with sheer volume, sometimes with dazzling virtuosity, sometimes with softness, sometimes with silence, and always with interesting ideas.\n\nIn some ways this is a collections of ideas and techniques the composer has amassed over some 50 + years of playing. Each movement seems to be a more or less self contained exposition of playing techniques and the composers own approach to harmony and invention. That sounds potentially very dull but this is not a collection of etudes didactically accounting for and crystallizing his ideas. It is the organic appropriation of personal achievements in developing his compositional style. And it is an homage to electric guitarists that preceded him. Not a textbook as much as perhaps a signpost defining his present stage of development even as he moves forward with other projects.\n\nI suppose one could challenge the notion of calling this a work for solo guitar given the effects pedals, looping systems, etc. but the use of electronics and looping techniques as a compositional aid or method is so ubiquitous that point is moot. Call it what you like but just listen. Let the music flow over your ears. At the very least this is a defining milestone in Bradyâs long and productive career. Itâs hard to to imagine what he might do next but Iâm sure heâll think of something.\n\nEvery Starkland release is an event and this one is no different. This is a composer new to this writer and likely new to most of the new music community. But fear not of the unknown. Advance praise from the likes of John Chowning (one of the reigning bright lights of electronic music) of Stanford certainly add a heady air of anticipation as we are now privileged to hear what is definitely leading edge and the future of electroacoustic composition. And Starkland releases always feature carefully chosen repertoire which is not infrequently a harbinger of success for the chosen artist. This young Japanese composer reveals a distinctive voice that heralds her as a rising star in the field of what is called by some âelectroacousticâ music.\n\nThe only problem for listeners or reviewers is the fact that this is a new composer. And though she is clearly a rising star we know very little about her and her work so a bit of background is necessary.\n\nSuzuki was born in Japan. She studied at the estimable Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University where she earned a B.A. in music. She followed this with a D.M.A.. from Stanford University where she was mentored by the late great Jonathan Harvey (1939-2012). Another stellar antecedent and influence, John Chowning, the composer and sound engineer whose work has virtually defined electronic music synthesis as we now know it. He provides appreciative and insightful liner notes on this former student.\n\nI do feel the need to express a disclaimer here regarding the musical genre known as âelectroacousticâ. This has been, for me personally, an entertainment minefield. Attempts to join electronics with acoustic instruments go back at least to Edgar Variese (1883-1965) who used electronic interpolations (produced on magnetic tape) between the orchestral sections of his work Deserts (1950-54). This parallel construction strategy (electronic segments performed/played separate from acoustic instrument sections) seems to have had an echo in the so called âThird Streamâ music promoted by Gunther Schuller. Third Stream compositions sometimes similarly segregated the jazz combo with the orchestral sections of a given work. This strategy, now seldom used, was innovative in its time but sounds very dated in this new millennium, There are, however, shining examples of more successful integration of electronic and acoustic media such as Mario Davidovskyâs (1937-2019) ten âSynchronismsâand some of Milton Babbitâs (1916-2011) works. There are others of course but that discussion is beyond the scope of this review.\n\nSuffice it to say that many attempts at combining electronics with acoustic instruments have failed to tickle this listenerâs fancy and made me skeptical of this genre though that is changing the more I listen (so its not clear if my perceptions are due to better composition techniques or my learning curve). But be not afraid.\n\nThis album, no doubt due to the many successful antecedents of works by the likes of Mr. Harvey and Mr. Chowning, is successful enough in its construction as to suggest it may be a landmark in the evolution of said genre. It certainly works for this listener and explains my title for this review. In fact this album is a new statement, tantamount to a manifesto on âelectroacousticâ music. In addition to clearly having mastered the electronics (including judicious use of technology), Suzuki also writes for acoustic instruments from her native Japan. She even uses paper instruments. And in music that deals with elegy, evanescence, and impermanence her choices are most apt.\n\nThis is the first disc devoted entirely to Suzukiâs work and no label, save for Starkland, Innova, and the newly revived Neuma can be said to be more notable in their attention to electronic and electroacoustic work. Works do appear on other labels of course but Starkland Innova, and Neuma seem to have a more efficient curatorial radar with this genre. I certainly feel confident that we will hear much more from this hard working, emerging artist.\n\nThere is a theme of darkness, homage, mystery, and sadness that pervades this album. It is about night, darkness, loss, and cherished memories. But darkness does not here translate to sadness, rather it seems to be about what follows sadness and honoring those memories.\n\nThere are 7 compositions represented on 7 tracks:\n\nEpiphyllum Oxypetalum (Queen of the Night) (2009) takes its title from the Latin taxonomic name of the above pictured Dutchmanâs Pipe or, more elegantly, Queen of the Night cactus. It is a nocturnal blooming species, a perfect choice for this non-narrative tone poem about the composerâs dreams. These aural images stand in for the visuals that only the dreamer can fully recall but can hopefully elicit in the listener.\n\nInspired by a 1933 essay, âIn Praise of Shadowsâ (2015), is a eulogy about evanescence. It is simultaneously about the visual importance of shadow in eastern visual art and the relative loss or obscuring of those images as they are impacted by modern technology. We lose the shadows when we light them but lose their impact as they succumb to it. In a marvelously clever parallel metaphor the composer makes use of paper instruments as a part of the sonic fabric. Their impermanence is also their value here.\n\nMinyo (1997), the earliest composition here incorporates Japanese folk songs commonly sung by workers and incorporates some of the acoustic instruments which commonly accompany these songs. Here the use of electronics is fairly subtle, sometimes imitative augment the acoustic string quartet. Doubtless the songs used would be more familiar to native Japanese but this hardly detracts from the beauty of this work, an homage of sorts to the Melodieâs and instruments of the composerâs native land.\n\nAutomata (Mechanical Garden) is an homage to the late Folkmar Hein, former director of the Electronic Music Studio at TU Berlin. The piece uses mechanical sounds of increasing complexity, mechanical devices evolving in complexity to become automatic, perhaps a mechanical analogue of a golem not (at least not yet) out of control as the golem of legend.\n\nReservoir (2013) is a 24 channel work for voice and electronics. It was inspired by an anonymous post on a âsuicide blogâ (I didnât know such things existed). The text of the anonymous poster, the replies, and presumably the poster have all disappeared. This, perhaps the most complex and ambitious piece featured here, is a remarkably powerful work and, appropriately, the texts are provided in English.\n\nSagisÅ (2012) is a miniature representing this fringed orchid species native to Japan. It is said by some to represent a White Egret in flight.\n\nShimmer, Tree (In Memoriam Jonathan Harvey) (2014) is a two movement work in honor of one of Suzukiâs cherished mentors who died in 2012. It is a sort of mini concerto for piano and electronics. This is the longest and, to this listenerâs ears, the most forward looking and substantial work on the disc. Harvey would have been proud.\n\nThe Spektral Quartet (in Minyo), tenor/countertenor Javier Hagen (in Reservoir), and pianist Cristina Valdes discharge their duties admirably. The album is mixed and produced by the composer and mastered by the inimitable Silas Brown.\n\nThis listener looks forward with eager anticipation to more from this fine composer.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Though I received this album well before itâs 2022 release date, I was unable to complete my review in a timely manner. I did, however, include this release in my âbest ofâ for 2022.\n\nThe fanciful subtitle of this release, âThe Danceâ is a follow up to the first volume titled, âIn Natureâ (a third volume titled, âAt Playâ is due out in March, 2023). These vague titles are fanciful and more connotative than specific. They seem to reflect the nature of the project and the nature of Sarah Cahillâs style of conceptualizing what must be an overwhelming undertaking, Beginning with the simple concept of female composers (the term âneglectedâ would be redundant here) Cahill has produced a sweeping survey ranging from the baroque era (the earliest piece so far in this anthology is from 1687) to the present and her survey seems to know few geographical boundaries in this representative survey of keyboard music. Of course we are talking about basically the paradigm of western classical music but non-western influences are of course included via the composersâ individual talents. Many of these works were presented in Cahillâs fine YouTube series which can give listeners further clues to the pianistâs varied interests.\n\nThe cover art (which I had described as âdrabâ in the first review) now seems to aptly reflect the struggle for equality and now nicely represents this project in an iconic way with the same monochrome cover photo on each of the three volumes and a primary color panel with the disc title. Green for Volume I, Yellow for Volume II (Iâm guessing âredâ for Vol III?). This survey is shaping up to be an influential as well as hugely entertaining anthology.\n\nWhat struck this listener is Cahillâs facility with both technique and interpretation of a mighty diverse set of pieces. Known primarily for her work with music written after 1950, she demonstrates in these recordings an impressive command of baroque, classical, romantic, and modern idioms. I have never heard her play Bach but I wouldnât miss an opportunity to hear her do the Goldberg Variations.\n\nThis was particularly striking in her reading of the keyboard suite that opens this release. This is apparently not the first recording of Elisabeth JACQUET DE LA GUERREâs (1665-1729) Suite no. 1 in d minor (the complete suites for harpsichord were recorded by harpsichordist Carol Cerasi in 1998) but Cahill seems to channel the spirits of the pioneering efforts of Wanda Landowska and Rosalyn Tureck whose abilities to play harpsichord music effectively on the modern piano helped set the standard for this practice in the twentieth century and beyond. This late French baroque suite is a thoroughly engaging way to draw the listener in. With echoes of Bach and Couperin this virtually unknown composer is seriously engaging and substantive. This recording includes five (of nine) movements of the suite. One hopes to hear more of this womanâs music and Cahill is very much up to the task of providing a definitive performance.\n\nWith the next track we hear the music of Clara SCHUMANN (1819-1896), better known as the wife of Robert Schumann (1810-1856). Clara was in fact a highly accomplished virtuoso and composer whose works are only now getting the recognition they deserve. The piece chosen here is her Variations on a Theme of Robert Schumann Op. 20. These seven variations were a gift for her husband on his 43rd birthday in 1853. Sadly it was to be the last birthday he would celebrate with his family. Robert Schumann was infamously institutionalized in 1854 and died in 1856. The work has all the splendor of high romanticism with the virtuosity associated with the great composer/pianists (Brahms, Schumann, Liszt, Rubinstein, et al). And, as with the previous piece, Cahill seems very at home in her reading of this wonderful set of variations.\n\nGermaine TAILLEFERE (1892-1983) is next up with her three movement partita of 1957. The title âPartitaâ suggests a connection with the baroque suite which opens this collection. The connection is one of form, not harmony or melody. The three movements here are âPerpetuum Mobileâ, âNotturnoâ, and âAllegramenteâ. Taillefere, who is perhaps best known for her lively Harp Concertino of 1927, was the only female member of Franceâs celebrated âLes Sixâ (the other members were, Louis Durey, Georges Auric, Arthur Honneger, Darius Milhaud, and Francis Poulenc). This largely neoclassical group of composers developed their styles in the shadow of Debussy and Ravel. Cahillâs first album was a fine reading of Ravelâs piano music and she is very much in her element with this delightful three movement work which echoes Ravel to some degree,\n\nZenobia POWELL PERRY (1908-2004) is the first composer in this collection to be born in the twentieth century. She was a black composer/conductor/pianist and teacher. Her work appeared before in this blog in coverage of her opera âTarawa Houseâ which was given a revival in Modesto, CA in 2014. Her âRhapsodyâ (1960) is in a sort of Neo-romantic style with some challenging virtuosity required. This is a fine introduction to her work which deserves serious reassessment and more performances. Musicologist Jeannie Gayle Pool continues to publish, preserve, and advocate for this neglected American artist. Pool maintains the website for this composer and is a useful, informative site,\n\nMadeleine DRING (1923-1977), a British composer/pianist, a new name to this writer, is characterized by her use of popular and jazz idioms. Cahill here plays two (of five) movements of her âColor Suiteâ (1963). This whets the listenerâs appetite for more of this interesting composer whose work was well known during her career but whose star has dimmed since her passing. Dring is one of many women composers of that era whose work, though influential, has not been incorporated into the repertory of contemporary classical musicians.\n\nBetsy JOLAS (1926- ), a French born American composer whose career has included work as a composer, pianist, and teacher. No stranger to the Bay Area, Jolas taught at UC Berkeley and Mills College as well as Harvard and Yale. The listener accessible nature of her music belies the innovation and complexities it contains. Though she has been recognized throughout her career her work is due for a new reckoning. Her brief âTango Siâ (1984) is entertaining and sufficiently compelling to spark interest in her work going forward.\n\nElena KATS-CHERNIN (1957- ) hails from Uzbekistan and migrated to Australia where she studied at the New South Wales Conservatorium and subsequently with Helmut Lachenmann in Germany. Kats-Chernin has been a prolific composer and is now perhaps mid-career and, happily, pretty well known. âPeggyâs Ragâ (1996) is one of a set of several rags written between 1995 and 1999. This work is dedicated to Australian composer Peggy Glanville-Hicks (1912-1990), another artist, another female composer deserving of a revival.\n\nMeredith MONK (1942- ) has long been one of this reviewerâs favorite âdowntownâ composers whose initial musical ventures were first heard in her New York SOHO loft. She, along with other rising stars, including Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Phill Klein, Rhys Chatham, etc., are now the historically recognized mavericks whoâs creative ideas formed in contrast to the power elite of the âuptownâ composers heard commonly at Lincoln Center.\n\nMonk was initially trained as a dancer and that has been evident in most of her output. But she is perhaps best known for her exploration of extended vocal techniques (which she also teaches). It is fitting that her âSt. Petersburg Waltzâ (1997) is included in this dance themed installment of music by women composers. Despite being an âeast coastâ composer initially, Monk has achieved international recognition and has a particularly large following in the Bay Area. No surprise then that our pianist guide in this journey has a long standing familiarity with Monkâs work. Cahill demonstrates her grasp of Monkâs minimalist inflected style most admirably and, as in the preceding tracks, leaves the listener wanting more.\n\nGabriela ORTIZ (1964) is a Mexican composer. Born in Mexico, trained in England, and now teaching in Mexico. Her light shines brightly even in the glare of the heavily politicized immigration issues that dominate the media and is another in a long line of world class composers from that underrated country. Ortiz, in addition to her academic appointments, has produced a large number of works in multiple formats from piano and chamber music, to orchestral, dance, and opera. Her work draws in part on the folk music traditions she absorbed in her childhood and she has amassed a significant number of international commi"
