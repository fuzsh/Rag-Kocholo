        "text": "Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.\n\n* AEROSMITH, Continental Airlines Arena, East Rutherford, N.J., (212) 307-7171. Since the band's first heyday in the 1970's and with its resurgence in the 1990's, Aerosmith's main songwriting team, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry, has created a durable cartoon of teen-age romance, always ricocheting between extremes. As Mr. Tyler shows off his rubber face and waves his scarf-draped microphones, the band's songs are half snickering double-entendres (with genuine affection for their blues and rhythm-and-blues roots) and half self-absorbed, heart-on-sleeve power ballads that stop short of too much self-importance. Sunday at 8 P.M., with Candlebox opening; tickets are $35 and $50 (Jon Pareles).\n\nRAY ANDERSON, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. He's a brash, bruising trombonist, and he's brought together a band that includes the keyboardist Amina Claudine Myers, the bassist and guitarist Jerome Harris and the drummer Cecil Brooks. In his hands, the music can move anywhere from funk and rhythm-and-blues to straight-ahead jazz or free improvisation. He's exuberant. Shows through Sunday are at 9 and 11 P.M. and 12:30 A.M., with no third set on Sunday. The cover is $20, and there's a $10 minimum (Peter Watrous).\n\nBLACK 47, Connolly's Pub and Restaurant, 14 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 867-3767. Larry Kirwan and the boys are in the midst of recording an album, which might include a tribute to Bobby Kennedy, a diatribe against the Aryan Nation and a wild yarn about having sex on the grave of James Joyce. Expect nothing less than goofy passion from New York's favorite Irish expatriate classic rock outfit. The band will be trying out these new songs and playing old favorites at this weekly midtown gig. Tomorrow at 10:30 P.M.; tickets are $10 (Ann Powers).\n\nHAMIET BLUIETT QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue, at 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 427-0253. What a sound that baritone saxophone can make when Mr. Bluiett is stalking a good time. A longtime member of the World Saxophone Quartet, Mr. Bluiett only gives the full scope of his sense of play in his own gigs. Sets tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30 P.M. and midnight; there is an $8 cover and a two-drink minimum (Ben Ratliff).\n\nCHICK COREA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. Last time through Mr. Corea's band was impressive, and a bit stiff; it was playing some of the material without much rehearsal. This time, the material is familiar, and the band still includes the saxophonist Steve Wilson, an articulate, intelligent soloist. And Mr. Corea, the master of modern harmony, will supply the colors. The sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11:30 P.M.; the cover charge is $45 and there's a $5 minimum (Watrous).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
