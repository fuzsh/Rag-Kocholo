        "text": "Pasifika Black: Oceania, Anticolonialism, and the African World\n\nQuito Swan\n\nOceania is a vast sea of islands, large scale political struggles and immensely significant historical phenomena. Pasifika Black is a compelling history of understudied anti-colonial movements in this region, exploring how indigenous Oceanic activists intentionally forged international connections with the African world in their fights for liberation.\n\nLearn more about Swan\n\nA Casebook on Roman Water Law\n\nCynthia Bannon\n\nThe Romans are famous for constructing aqueducts, canals, and dams. But their law is also a lasting, if less visible, monument to their attempts to control water. A Casebook on Roman Water Law presents an analytical collection of Roman sources for water rights.\n\nLearn more about Bannon\n\nPauulu's Diaspora: Black Internationalism and Environmental Justice\n\nQuito Swan\n\nPauulu’s Diaspora is a sweeping story of black internationalism across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean worlds, told through the life and work of twentieth-century environmental activist Pauulu Kamarakafego.

King\n\nCharting the course of Audubon’s life and work, from his birth in Haiti to his death in New York City, Irmscher and King’s sweeping introduction and carefully drawn commentary confront the challenges Audubon’s legacy poses for us today. Rounded out by hundreds of historical and ornithological notes and beautiful illustrations, and with a foreword by distinguished photographer and conservationist Subhankar Banerjee, Audubon at Seais the most comprehensively annotated collection of Audubon’s work ever published.\n\nLearn more about Irmsher & King\n\nThe Light Always Breaks\n\nAngela Jackson-Brown\n\nThe author of When Stars Rain Down returns with a historical romance about all that has---and has not---changed in these United States. As 1947 opens, Eva Cardon is the twenty-four-year-old owner of Washington, D.C.’s, most famous Black-owned restaurant. When her path crosses with Courtland, a handsome white senator from Georgia, both find themselves drawn to one another—but the danger of a relationship between a Black woman and a white man from the South could destroy them and everything they’ve worked for.\n\nLearn more about Jackson-Brown\n\nThe Democratic Ethos: Authenticity and Instrumentalism in US Movement Rhetoric After Occupy\n\nA. Freya Thimsen\n\nA multidisciplinary analysis of the lasting effects of the Occupy Wall Street protest movement. What did Occupy Wall Street accomplish? While it began as a startling disruption in politics as usual, in The Democratic Ethos Freya Thimsen argues that the movement's long-term importance rests in how its commitment to radical democratic self-organization has been adopted within more conventional forms of politics.\n\nLearn more about Thimsen\n\nXenophon and the Athenian Democracy: The Education of an Elite Citizenry\n\nMatt Christ\n\nThis book seeks to understand Xenophon as an elite Athenian writing largely for an elite Athenian audience in the first half of the fourth century BC. It argues that Xenophon calls on men of his own class to set aside their assumptions of superiority based on birth or wealth and to reinvent themselves as individuals who can provide effective leadership to the democratic city and serve it as good citizens. Xenophon challenges, criticizes, and sometimes satirizes the Athenian elite, and seeks to instruct them concerning the values, knowledge, and practical skills they will need to succeed as civic leaders.\n\nLearn more about Christ\n\nIsis in a Global Empire: Greek Identity through Egyptian Religion in Roman Greece\n\nLindsey Mazurek\n\nIn Isis in a Global Empire, Lindsey Mazurek explores the growing popularity of Egyptian gods and its impact on Greek identity in the Roman Empire.

Examining its urban infrastructure and the administrative, social, religious, and cultural institutions that gave the city life, it also considers visitors' encounters with both its urban reality and its place in imagination.\n\nLearn more about Bassett\n\nThe Arabesque from Kant to Comics\n\nCordula Grewe\n\nThe Arabesque from Kant to Comics tracks the life and afterlife of the arabesque in its surprising transformation from an iconoclastic literary theory of early German Romanticism to aesthetic experimentation in both avant-garde art and popular culture.\n\nLearn more about Grewe\n\nThe Dream of Absolutism: Louis XIV and the Logic of Modernity\n\nHall Bjørnstad\n\nIn this sweeping reconsideration of absolutist culture, Hall Bjørnstad argues that the exuberance of Louis XIV’s reign was not top-down propaganda in any modern sense, but rather a dream dreamt collectively, by king, court, image-makers, and nation alike.\n\nLearn more about Bjørnstad\n\nOdious Praise: Rhetoric, Religion, and Social Thought\n\nEric MacPhail\n\nThis book reveals a tradition of thought overlooked in our intellectual history but enormously influential even now: the tradition of odious praise. Distinct from more conventional rhetorical exercises, such as panegyric or the funeral oration, odious praise uses acclaim to censure or to critique. This book reassesses the genre of praise-and-blame rhetoric by considering the potential of odious praise to undermine consensus and to challenge a society’s normative values.\n\nLearn more about MacPhail\n\nLiturgical Song and Practice in Dante's Commedia\n\nHelena Phillips-Robins\n\nIn Liturgical Song and Practice in Dante’s “Commedia,” Helena Phillips-Robins explores for the first time the ways in which the relationship between humanity and divinity is shaped through the performance of liturgy in the Commedia.\n\nLearn more about Phillips-Robins\n\nCommedia e civiltà: Dinamiche anticonflittuali nella letteratura italiana\n\nMassimo Scalabrini\n\nThe rhetorical and ethical values of conversation, decorum and moderation—all inherited from Greco-Latin antiquity—became instruments of conflict prevention, containment and resolution in the literary Classicism of sixteenth-century Italy, particularly in the canonical genres of the treatise on behavior, the epic poem and erudite comedy.\n\nMore about Scalabrini\n\nThe Lives of Jessie Sampter\n\nSarah Imhoff\n\nIn The Lives of Jessie Sampter, Sarah Imhoff tells the story of an individual full of contradictions.

Haberman\n\nUnderstanding Climate Change through Religious Lifeworld,edited by David Haberman, presents a unique collection of essays that detail how the effects of human-related climate change are actively reshaping religious ideas and practices, even as religious groups and communities endeavor to bring their traditions to bear on mounting climate challenges.\n\nLearn more about Haberman\n\nReligious Intimacies\n\nMary Dunn and Brenna Moore\n\nReligious Intimacies, edited by Mary Dunn and Brenna Moore, brings together nine scholars of modern Christianity to probe this in-between space. In essays that range from treatments of Jesuit-indigenous relations in early modern Canada to the erotics of contemporary black theology, each contributor makes the case for the study of the presence and power of affective ties and relational dynamics between friends, lovers, and intimate others (even things) as vital to the understanding of religion.\n\nLearn more about Dunn & Moore\n\nAt Home and Abroad\n\nWinnifred Fallers Sullivan and Elizabeth Shakman Hurd\n\nAt Home and Abroad bridges the divide in the study of American religion, law, and politics between domestic and international, bringing together diverse and distinguished authors from religious studies, law, American studies, sociology, history, and political science to explore interrelations across conceptual and political boundaries.\n\nMore about Sullivan & Hurd\n\nProblems in Lexicography\n\nMichael Adams\n\nProblems in Lexicography is an essential, classic work of practical lexicography (the practice of writing dictionaries) and meta-lexicography.

Forty years after their first groundbreaking work of feminist literary theory, The Madwoman in the Attic, award-winning collaborators Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar map the literary history of feminism’s second wave.\n\nLearn more about Gilbert & Gubar\n\nInciting Joy\n\nRoss Gay\n\nIn these gorgeously written and timely pieces, prize-winning poet and author Ross Gay considers the joy we incite when we care for each other, especially during life’s inevitable hardships. Throughout Inciting Joy, he explores how we can practice recognizing that connection, and also, crucially, how we expand it.\n\nLearn more about Gay\n\nDevotion Three Inquiries in Religion, Literature, and Political Imagination\n\nConstance M. Furey\n\nWe are living in a time of radical uncertainty, faced with serious political, ecological, economic, epidemiological, and social problems. Scholars of religion Constance M.

Fritz Breithaupt is a distinguished literary scholar, cognitive scientist, and the Director of the Experimental Humanities Lab at the IU Bloomington.\n\nDating the Old Norse Poetic Edda\n\nChristopher D. Sapp\n\nThis book offers new dating of the poems of the Old Norse Poetic Edda , perhaps our best sources about the mythology and legends of the Viking Age.

Her book will appeal to readers with interests in the philosophy of set theory, modal logic, and the role of mathematics in the sciences.\n\nLearn more about Berry\n\nMixed Messages\n\nKathryn Graber\n\nFocusing on language and media in Asian Russia, particularly in Buryat territories, Mixed Messages engages debates about the role of minority media in society, alternative visions of modernity, and the impact of media on everyday language use. Graber demonstrates that language and the production, circulation, and consumption of media are practices by which residents of the region perform and negotiate competing possible identities.\n\nLearn more about Graber\n\nRichard Rufus of Cornwall, Scriptum in Metaphysicam Aristotelis\n\nRega Wood\n\nThis is the first great commentary in the Western European tradition of expounding Aristotle's Metaphysics. Dated about 1238, this work by Richard Rufus of Cornwall is a major contribution to the history of Western philosophy and the study of Aristotle. No future account of thirteenth-century metaphysics will be able to ignore its contribution.\n\nLearn more about Wood\n\nSmellosophy: What the Nose Tells the Mind\n\nAnn-Sophie Barwich\n\nSmellosophy asks a deceptively simple question: What does the nose tell the brain, and how does the brain understand it? A. S. Barwich interviews experts in neuroscience, psychology, chemistry, and perfumery in an effort to understand the biological mechanics and myriad meanings of odors, ultimately arguing that it’s time to stop recycling ideas based on the paradigm of vision for the olfactory system.\n\nLearn more about Barwich\n\nIntervention Narratives: Afghanistan, The US and the Global War on Terror\n\nPurnima Bose\n\nIntervention Narratives examines the contradictory cultural representations of the US intervention in Afghanistan that help to justify an imperial foreign policy. By investigating the familiar recurring tropes of heroism, terrorism, entrepreneurship, and canine love, Purnima Bose demonstrates that contemporary imperialism operates on an ideologically diverse cultural terrain to enlist support for the war across the political spectrum.\n\nLearn more about Bose\n\nSuites y el viaje de la percepción / Suites and the Voyage of Perception\n\nMelissa Dinverno\n\nAn exhibition catalog containing two scholarly essays, this bilingual monograph celebrates Suites y el viaje de la percepción (Suites and the Voyage of Perception), a 2020 exhibit curated by Melissa Dinverno at the Centra Federico García Lorca in Granada, Spain.

Dodson\n\nThis book is a re-evaluation of modern urbanism and architecture and a history of urbanism, architecture, and local identity in colonial north India at the turn of the twentieth century. Focusing on Banaras and Jaunpur, Dodson argues that interactions with the colonial state were an integral aspect of the ways that Indians created a sense of their own personal investment in the city in which they lived.\n\nLearn more about Dodson\n\nEconomic Theory and the Roman Monetary Economy\n\nColin P. Elliott\n\nModern economics tantalizes historians, promising them a set of simple verbal and mathematical formulas to explain and even retrospectively predict historical actions and choices. In this volume, Colin P. Elliott challenges economic historians to rethink the way they use economic theory, offering novel analyses of key events in Roman monetary history, from Augustus' triumph over Mark Antony and Cleopatra, to third-century AD coinage debasements.\n\nLearn more about Elliott\n\nDesired States: Gender, Sexuality, and Political Culture in 20th Century Chile\n\nLessie Jo Frazier\n\nDesired States challenges the notion that in some cultures, sex and sexuality have become privatized and located in individual subjectivity rather than in public political practices and institutions. Instead, Frazier contends that desire is a central aspect of political culture. Through fieldwork and archival research, she explores the gendered and sexualized dynamics of political culture in Chile, an imperialist context.\n\nLearn more about Frazier\n\nDaniel Johnston: A Portrait of the Artist as a Potter in North Carolina\n\nHenry Glassie\n\nDrawing from his international fieldwork in ceramic traditions and years of interviews with potter Daniel Johnston, Henry Glassie presents a portrait of the young artist in this book.

By actively shaping the interaction between user and machine, overcoming styling limitations, and generating a distinct corporate identity, Atari designed products that impacted the everyday visual and material culture of the late 20th century.\n\nLearn more about Guins\n\nCross-Theoretical Explorations of Interlocutors and Their Individual Differences\n\nLaura Gurzynski-Weiss\n\nThis edited volume examines the role of interlocutors and their individual differences (IDs) in second language development from four theoretical lenses: the cognitive-interactionist approach, sociocultural theory, the variationist approach, and complex dynamic systems theory. A theoretical overview to each approach is written by a preeminent scholar in the framework, and each overview is followed by an empirical study demonstrating how interlocutor IDs can be fruitfully researched within that framework.\n\nLearn more about Gurzynski-Weiss\n\nFlaming?: The Peculiar Theo-Politics of Fire and Desire in Black Male Gospel Music Performance\n\nAlisha Lola Jones\n\nMale-centered theology, a dearth of men in the pews, and an overrepresentation of queer males in music ministry: these elements coexist within the spaces of historically black Protestant churches, creating an atmosphere where simultaneous heteropatriarchy and \"real\" masculinity anxieties are all in play. In this book, Jones observes how male vocalists traverse their tightly-knit social networks and negotiate their identities through and beyond the worship experience.\n\nFrom Street to Screen, Charles Burnett’s Killer of Sheep\n\nMichael T.
