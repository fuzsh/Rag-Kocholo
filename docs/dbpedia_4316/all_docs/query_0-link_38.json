Reminiscent of times past and recalling consciousness of the midnight circuits.\n\nTape 1 is a limited copy of 100 cassettes, including patch, pin and a especially designed box by Jonas Holmberg. Artwork: Jonas Andersson\n\nPre-order open NOW!\n\nRelease: July 20th on pomperipossarecords.com\n\nKULMA is:\n\nChristian berg\n\nDaniel Noring\n\nThobias Eidevald\n\nJean-Charles Schwarzmann\n\nDEN SORTE DØD ::: DE BUNDLØSE SØER\n\nFABIENNE ERATO\n\nENTRANCE TO THE END\n\nA trippy and brutal psycho-ethnographic expedition into the tropical jungles of the subconscious. The dense, tropical motifs in 'Entrance to the End' are immortalised on analogue 16mm film in Panama's jungles by Maria von Hausswolff during a trip to Panama, and all the film's sound is recorded on a cassette tape by the co-director Anne Gry Kristensen. Title cards set the tone and define the evolutionary law of the jungle: 'We didn't come to dominate the world because we were the smartest or the fittest... but because we were the craziest, baddest motherfuckers around.' Hausswolff and Kristensen's dark, audiovisual work is the subconscious's answer to an ultra-violent Italian cannibal film from the 1970s, and to every romantic notion of nature as a harmonic place that is in balance with itself and its inhabitants. A work between reality and fantasy, and one of the most uncompromising films this year.\n\nOn Tuesday march 20th at 9.45PM in Cinemateket, Copenhagen - it has its first screening ever - at DOX - in the Next Wave competition. If you can - come join us in the dark. Have drinks with us afterwards.\n\nANNA VON HAUSSWOLFF ::: DEAD MAGIC\n\nSCANNER ::: FIBOLAE\n\nDEN SORTE DØD ::: INTET KAN STOPPE DEN SORTE DØD\n\nUltra limited edition of 50 vinyl copies.\n\nOpen for pre-order NOW.\n\nRELEASE DATE: October 13th, 2017\n\nDRØNE ::: A PERFECT BLIND\n\nDisruption between then and now/memory and presence, dulcimer, psaltery, ‘cellos, violas and violin embroider radio, static, stray voices and electronics… ‘a perfect blind’ is the second album by drøne (Mark Van Hoen & Mike Harding) with an array of guest artists, including label supremo Anna von Hausswolff, dreamer and composer Paul Haslinger, field recordist and sound designer Charlie Campagna and Touch artists Bethan Kellough & Philip Jeck. Strings by Seattle-based Marie Takahashi and Oleg Belyaev are also layered into this complex and perhaps more musical offering. Moving in all directions, ‘a perfect blind’ continues where ‘reversing into the future’ [pomperipossa records, 2016] left off.\n\n‘a perfect blind’ was conceived and designed in Los Angeles with organ recordings from London (at Union Chapel), short wave radio, treated voices and other archaic sound sources.\n\nA stunning front cover image by Maria von Hausswolff and miss-taken typography by Nico embrace this sense of dislocation; as the mediaeval language which enfolds our collapsing 19th Century institutions fails to find relevance, our sense of entrapment in the old is accompanied by an assault on the senses. The destabilising effect of “post-truth” adds to our sense of unbelonging, of being elsewhere, observers not participants.\n\n‘a perfect blind’ is the term used for the best possible observation point where the viewer is unseen by the object of interest. Is this the best place to be? Memories which slowly fade away, also reverse back from the past shoving us into the future…\n\nLimited Edition Vinyl (500 copies)\n\nRelease date: 22nd April 2017 [Record Store Day]\n\nAnd afterwards available on Bandcamp (digital download only)\n\nANNA VON HAUSSWOLFF ::: KÄLLAN (BETATYPE)\n\nDRØNE ::: REVERSING INTO THE FUTURE\n\nANNA VON HAUSSWOLFF ::: THE MIRACULOUS\n\nCritically acclaimed artist and musician Anna von Hausswolff is finally back with her long awaited third studio album.\n\nThe new album “The Miraculous” floats like a ghost, from the subdued elegance of the title track, and the bewitching “En Ensam Vandrare”, to the unbearably tense, Godspeed You! Black Emperor atmospherics of “Discovery” and the brutal, Swans-meets-Black Sabbath savagery of “Come Wander With Me / Deliverance”.\n\nThe album will be available in November on 2 LP and CD. One of the LP’s will have an etched backside with artwork done by Anna von Hausswolff.\n\nhttp://www.bengans.se/campaigns/anna-von-hausswolff\n\nBERG ::: THE TRANÅS DRONE RECORDINGS 1\n\nSolo project of Christian Berg. Minimalistic drone landscapes that penetrates your brain.\n\nFirst cassette release on Pomperipossa Records. Handprinted cover and figure artwork by Leif Elggren. The cassette comes in a black velvet pouch.\n\nLimited edition of 195 copies.\n\nReleased November 13.\n\nPre-order http://pomperipossarecords.com/products/berg-the-tranas-drone-recordings-1\n\nOFFERMOSE ::: BAG DE HVIDE TINDER\n\nThe epic repetitious synth landscapes of Offermose will finally see the light of day. In what is best described as a mix between early Berlin School electronic music and sacrificial rituals of the ancients. The debut EP \"Bag De Hvide Tinder\" will be out on 10´ vinyl January 22nd. Limited edition of 100 copies. Pre-order is now available."
