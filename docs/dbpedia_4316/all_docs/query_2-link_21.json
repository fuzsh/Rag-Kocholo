        "text": "Music\n\nA student choosing to major in music can develop a course of study intended to cultivate specific musical interests and abilities. Advisers in each music field may suggest the best academic plan for each student. Areas of focus include performance or composition in classical, jazz, or electronic music genres; western music research and history; music theory and analysis; and ethnomusicology. To fulfill requirements in a desired focus, students are suggested to take no fewer than six 200/300 level theory and history courses by the time of graduation. Additional requirements may include regular enrollment in one or more of the performance workshops, private lessons, composition workshops, or ensembles that are offered each semester. By the time of moderation, a student should ideally have completed half of their suggested course requirements. Students Moderation and Senior Projects should ideally reflect their expressed musical interests and goals, whether they are based in performance, composition, research, analysis, or any combination of these. The Moderation Project for a student focused on composition or performance usually consists of a 25-40 minute recital, highlighting original work and/or other repertoire. For students interested in music scholarship or analysis, a substantial music history or theory paper serves as an appropriate moderation project. A Senior Project in music can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Performers and composers usually present two concerts from 30 to 60 minutes each. For some composers, one concert can be replaced by an orchestra work written for performance by The Orchestra Now. In certain circumstances, a finished, sophisticatedly produced recording or multimedia project serves in place of a live performance. Music History and Theory students typically present an advanced, scholarly research or analysis paper as the main component of a Senior Project. Specific requirements for each area can be found on the Music Program website: https://music.bard.edu.\n\nCollege & Community Ensembles\n\nUnless otherwise noted, each ensemble is for one credit. It is possible to participate in more than one ensemble and receive additional credit accordingly. If private lessons are taken in conjunction with an ensemble, one or two credits may be added. Private lessons must be separately registered.\n\nMusic Courses\n\nArithmetic of Listening\n\nProfessor:\n\nKyle Gann\n\nCourse Number:\n\nMUS 304\n\nCRN Number:\n\n90013\n\nClass cap:\n\n22\n\nCredits:\n\n4\n\nSchedule/Location:\n\nMonWed3:30 PM - 4:50 PM Blum Music Center N217\n\nDistributional Area:\n\nMC Mathematics and Computing\n\nThe human ear can distinguish about 250 pitches per octave; why do we satisfy ourselves with only twelve? This introduction to the mathematics of harmony and the history of tuning will ponder and explore that question. First we will study the development of scales and harmony from the ancient Greeks onward, through the tuning arguments of the 15 th through 18 th centuries, including the various meantone systems (such as Mozarts 55-step octave) and temperaments that preceded the bland homogeneity prevalent today. In the second half we will explore modern experimental tunings, including quarter-tone music, 72-tone music, and the just intonation of Ben Johnston, La Monte Young, and other microtonal composers, plus pitch tendencies of Indian, Thai, Indonesian, and Arabic musics. Basic ability to read music is recommended, though it may be compensated for by a background in mathematics or acoustics. Class will be graded on two small exams, a midterm project, a final project, occasional smaller assignments, and active class participation. The student will need a calculator for class with logarithmic functions. This course fulfills a mathematics distribution requirement and also either a theory or history requirement for music majors, and is especially recommended for those interested in early music performance.\n\nMusical Electronics\n\nProfessor:\n\nDanielle Dobkin\n\nCourse Number:\n\nMUS 320\n\nCRN Number:\n\n90009\n\nClass cap:\n\n15\n\nCredits:\n\n4\n\nSchedule/Location:\n\nTue3:10 PM - 5:30 PM Blum Music Center N119\n\nDistributional Area:\n\nPA Practicing Arts\n\nThis course concentrates on the creative use of electronic circuitry and the construction of devices for musical applications. Students will develop an understanding of how basic electronic components are used in audio circuits and how to read schematic diagrams. Well discuss topics such as Voltage Control, Synthesis, Filtering, Waveshaping, Phase Shifting, Ring Modulation, Theremins, Circuit Bending, etc. Well work from existing designs and also create new devices as we hone our skills of soldering, point-to-point wiring and layout. Familiarity with basic electronics and the use of hand tools is helpful but not a prerequisite for this class.\n\nHistory of Electronic Music\n\nProfessor:\n\nSarah Hennies\n\nCourse Number:\n\nMUS 326\n\nCRN Number:\n\n90019\n\nClass cap:\n\n20\n\nCredits:\n\n4\n\nSchedule/Location:\n\nMonWed3:30 PM - 4:50 PM Blum Music Center N119\n\nDistributional Area:\n\nAA Analysis of Art\n\nThis course provides a thorough overview of the musical, technological, and social conditions that contributed to the creation, development, and proliferation of electronic music in the 20th century. The advent of electronic sounds and technology in music is arguably the most important development in Western music of the last 100 years, and the course traces the evolution of the use of electronics in music through a variety of historical and contemporary tools and techniques. This includes early electronic and pre-electronic instruments, development of the commercial synthesizer and drum machine, sampling, musique concrete, synthesis, psychoacoustics, ambient music, noise, and more. Students will be given weekly reading, listening, and writing assignments and are expected to complete a final project at the end of the semester that includes a substantial research paper and brief presentation. Assignments are expected to be submitted on time; overdue assignments will result in a 10% reduction of grade for each day the assignment is overdue. This is a required course for the electronic music major; prior music experience is preferred but not required.\n\nField Methods:Ethnomusicology\n\nProfessor:\n\nWhitney Slaten\n\nCourse Number:\n\nMUS 334\n\nCRN Number:\n\n90045\n\nClass cap:\n\n10\n\nCredits:\n\n4\n\nSchedule/Location:\n\nThurs12:30 PM - 2:50 PM Blum Music Center N210\n\nDistributional Area:\n\nSA Social Analysis\n\nCrosslists:\n\nAnthropology\n\nStudents in this advanced seminar will examine the craft, pertinent intellectual frameworks, practical concerns, audio and video recording techniques, and significant ethical considerations associated with contemporary ethnographic field methods. The seminar focuses on how to collect qualitative data using observation, participation, and interviewing practices that begin to situate each students individual project into broader frameworks of knowledge. Preference will be given to students who plan to pursue ethnographic senior projects. Students will be evaluated on how they develop ethnographic research into a formal proposal for fieldwork that includes project description, literature review, methodology, budget, timeline, and modes of analysis.\n\nAdv Score Study Workshop\n\nProfessor:\n\nGeorge Tsontakis\n\nCourse Number:\n\nMUS 353\n\nCRN Number:\n\n90056\n\nClass cap:\n\n8\n\nCredits:\n\n4\n\nSchedule/Location:\n\nThurs12:30 PM - 2:50 PM Blum Music Center HALL\n\nDistributional Area:\n\nPA Practicing Arts\n\nA workshop for composers, conductors and instrumentalists wherein a myriad of musical scores from all periods of classical music will be examined, to include almost any genre  orchestral or otherwise. Emphasis will be on discussing what makes the particular piece work whether it be its dramatic power, balanced form, figuration design, orchestral flair or melodic and harmonic uniqueness. In short, trying to get to the essence of just what's so great about this piece? The instructor will present certain works but an equal and complimentary part of the workshop will be students introducing and leading class discussions on a work they choose to present, with the first question always to be answered: why did you choose this work? Prerequisites: advanced theory and general music experience.\n\nArranging Techniques: Jazz\n\nProfessor:\n\nErica Lindsay\n\nCourse Number:\n\nMUS 356\n\nCRN Number:\n\n90024\n\nClass cap:\n\n10\n\nCredits:\n\n4\n\nSchedule/Location:\n\nWed5:40 PM - 8:00 PM Blum Music Center N211\n\nDistributional Area:\n\nPA Practicing Arts\n\nThis class will focus on the various techniques used in jazz ensemble writing from trio to large ensembles.
