        "text": "Since its founding in the 1970s, the Residency program has woven living art and artists into the fabric of the Cathedral, providing time and space for artists to respond to the Cathedral as a powerful creative statement in stone, and opportunities for the public to access their work.\n\nMany of the artists, scholars, and environmentalists have remained involved with the Cathedral since their appointment in the 70s and 80s. Terms for more recently appointed residents are now three years. Some present regular performances—which have become synonymous with the Cathedral itself—throughout the year; others lend their art to the Cathedral on a project basis.\n\nThe Cathedral greatly values its Residency program, which will be carried forward in new ways into the 21st century\n\nMusicians\n\nDavid Briggs, Organist\n\nDavid Briggs is an internationally celebrated organist whose performances are acclaimed for their musicality, virtuosity, and ability to excite and engage audiences of all ages.

Since then, they have performed and taught at many New York City venues and cultural institutions, and have brought their fiery productions to cities throughout the U.S. They were recently featured in “SPIDER SEX,” a National Geographic Documentary on spiders directed by Jeff Morales, in which they performed the tarantella, a dance used as an antidote to cure the mythical bite of the tarantula.\n\nJudy Collins, Musician\n\nGrammy-winning singer-songwriter Judy Collins has been performing and recording since the 1960s, with a repertoire spanning folk, show tunes, pop, and rock-and-roll standards.
