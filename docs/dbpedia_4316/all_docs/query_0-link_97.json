        "text": "Songs are effective mediums to tell stories, communicate ideas, and convey emotions. In this course we will explore the long and widespread practice of singing Spanish Songs. We will engage with a variety of sources and methodologies that trace different forms of preservation, transmission, and circulation from thirteenth-century cantigas to Billboard hits enjoyed today in personal portable devices. The song repertory will give you the opportunity to develop critical thinking and analytical writing as you engage with a variety of ideas including memory, love and desire, race and identity, power and propaganda, cultural resistance and protest. We will consider narratives of music, musicians, and musical instruments that illustrate transcultural musical encounters around the globe, covering topics from the Spanish Reconquista to the Latinx and Caribbean diasporas in the US. (Same as: LACL 1018)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2020.\n\nThe term “experimental music” is broadly applied across a range of genres to indicate adventurous music that breaks with tradition and defies expectations. In this seminar, we discuss experimentation as a creative disposition and investigate why musicians and audiences might embrace or reject this approach. Our discussions will be informed by listening assignments, and by our own collective experiments with sound. We will also examine and practice writing about music by interrogating the term “experimental.” The way critics and musicians talk about experimental music not only reveals their preferences but also has important consequences for how music is understood and valued. Music does not speak for itself, and so what we say and write about music is essentially part of its meaning.\n\nExplores the role of music and sound as social practice, political catalyst, market commodity, site of nostalgia, environment regulator, identity tool, and technology of the self. Enables students to communicate about sound and music. Addresses music in relation to: mood manipulation; signification; taste and identity; race, class, gender, and sexuality codes; urban tribes and subcultures; economics and politics; power; authenticity; and technology. Emphasis will be on contemporary North American socio-musical contexts; however, cross-cultural and historical perspectives will also be introduced. Case studies may include gym, study, road trip, and party playlists; music in political campaigns; Muzak; advertising jingles; film music, and a variety of musical genres such as goth, funk, and hip hop.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2022, Spring 2022.\n\nIntroduces students to the rich and diverse musical traditions of sub-Saharan Africa. Covers traditional and modern musical practices from various regions, and explores their roles in social, cultural, and political contexts from historical and contemporary perspectives. Students learn to identify basic regional musical properties and characteristic musical styles. Case studies may include West African dance-drumming, Ghanaian highlife, musical oral historians, “African Ballets,” South African a cappella, the protest music of Nigerian Fela Kuti and Zimbabwean Thomas Mapfumo, as well as contemporary hip-hop and religious pop music. Based on lectures, readings, performances by visiting artists, discussions, and audio and video sources. No prior musical knowledge necessary. (Same as: AFRS 1211)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2021.\n\nFrom silent films (which were always accompanied with music and were therefore never really “Silent”) to today’s computer enhanced blockbusters, music has always been an integral part of cinema, allowing for suspension of disbelief, establishing mood and emotion, and cogenerating narrative. Through lectures and film viewings, discussion sections, small group projects, and readings (hyperlinked to movie clips), students in this course will gain the ability to critically analyze the musical language of cinema and understand how its related aesthetics, technology, and economics have changed over the last 100 years. Films studied will include works scored by Desplat, Herrmann, Junkie XL, Korngold, Ligeti, Public Enemy, Raskin, Simon, Tamar-Kali, Vangelis, and Williams. (Same as: CINE 1161)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2024, Fall 2021, Fall 2020.\n\nThis course is an opportunity to engage with the history, heritage, and culture of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Latin American and Caribbean communities in the US through music. We will explore issues of race, identity, religion, and politics from a broad temporal span of around five hundred years—from the sixteenth to the twenty-first century. We will cover a broad variety of regions, contexts, and musical genres from classical, folk, and popular traditions, such as salsa, Cuban son, hip-hop, Latin polyphony, rock, villancicos, protest song, chamber music, reggaeton, vallenato, and more. This course is not meant to be comprehensive but will reflect on the many ways in which music has been used in different cultural and historical contexts, offering a close examination of its characteristics, means, and meanings. (Same as: AFRS 1271, LACL 1271)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2023, Fall 2021, Fall 2020.\n\nStudents will explore different phases of the creative process that involve drama and music for the stage. We will study and compare recent productions of operas, musicals, and other theatrical and dance performances. Now that theaters, opera venues, and concert halls are closed, this course will serve as a reminder of the vibrant collaborative work between artists and the connections they establish with their audiences. We will discuss the different areas of design, such as scenography, costume, lighting, sound, and projection, and we will analyze in a cohesive way how they relate to the music score. We will engage with a variety of genres covering a wide time span, and we will analyze in-depth specific works, such as Mozart’s Don Giovanni, Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd, Gershwin’s Porgy and Bess, Monteverdi’s Il ritorno d’Ulisse in patria, Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring, and Robert Lepage’s staging for Peter Gabriel’s The Secret World Tour.

Positioning disability as a facet of human diversity, rather than a deficit, the course examines how conditions of, and ideas about, ability and disability affect experiences with music and how musical sounds, practices, and discourses in turn shape ideas and values about dis/ability. Includes a variety of socio-musical contexts and musical genres (among them, popular and classical) and cross-cultural and historical perspectives, as well as considerations of gender and race. No prior musical knowledge is necessary.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2022, Spring 2021.\n\nSeminar. Examines black sacred music from its earliest forms, fashioned by enslaved Africans, through current iterations produced by black global actors of a different sort. Explores questions such as: What does bondage sound like? What does emancipation sound like? Can we hear corresponding sounds generated by artists today? In what ways have creators of sacred music embraced, rejected, and re-envisioned the \"strange land\" over time? Looks at musical and lyrical content and the context in which various music genres developed, such as Negro spirituals, gospel, and sacred blues. Contemporary artists such as Janelle Monáe, Beyoncé, Bob Marley, and Michael Jackson included as well.

Attention will be given to manifestations of musical globalization and will incorporate the study of sources that reveal the circulation and transmission of Iberian and African musicoliterary genres in the vast transatlantic Spanish empire, including Portugal, Italy, the New World, and Asia. We will pay special attention to complex representations of ethnic and religious others (indigenous people of the Americas, African slaves, Muslims, Jews) in relation to literary conventions and early modern ideas about religious devotion and racial, gender, and class difference. We will approach these topics through a close engagement with materials in special collections and archives. This course is part of the following fields of study: Colonial Latin America, transatlantic studies, Spanish Golden Age Poetry, and early music. (Same as: LACL 2330)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2022.\n\nHow “African” is Latin American music? Although the size, nature, and significance of the Black population in Spanish America is often dismissed, the massive forced migration of African peoples to transatlantic Portuguese and Spanish dominions changed not only the soundscape but also tastes and musical practices in the entire Western Hemisphere. This course explores the legacies of Western African traditions in the music of Latin America. The scope and diversity of Afro-Latin, Afro-Caribbean, and Afro-Latinx musical traditions is immense, but we will explore specific historical narratives, regions, music genres, and sources and will engage with diverse scholarly approaches for the study of African roots in Latin American music(s). Some examples include seventeenth-century negrillas, eighteenth-century songs and dances for the Luso-Brazilian viola, Afro-Dominican salves, Mexican spirituals, Colombian vallenato, Brazilian samba, Cuban timba, Puerto Rican bomba, and Caribbean reggae, reggaetón, rap, and hip-hop. (Same as: AFRS 2336, LACL 2336)\n\nPrerequisites: MUS 1101 or AFRS 1101.\n\nThis course examines hip-hop culture's vast array of expressive practices. Focusing primarily on hip-hop dance practices, our study will situate these dances within a larger hip-hop culture, acknowledging hip-hop as both inherently African diasporic and specific to the particular US historical, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts in which—and the communities from whom—these practices emerge. Exploring aesthetics and/as cultural values, we will pay particular attention to the roles of power and inequity, interrogating themes that may include racism, anti-Blackness, white supremacy, globalization, appropriation, community, joy, and agency. We will examine our own positionalities, asking what it can mean to engage responsibly in hip-hop as well as what it can mean to be responsible to the communities of folks who created and continue to create hip-hop culture. Primarily a reading-, writing-, and discussion-based course, our study will be supplemented with physical practice in the studio. (Same as: DANC 2404, AFRS 2290)\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2023.\n\nIn this course, students explore a variety of theatrical genres that use music as a central component, typically ranging from early Italian opera to current Broadway musicals.

Positioning sound and music as our primary lens of inquiry, we examine primary sources and ethnographic studies in our attempt to grapple with the variegated ways religious or mystical experiences are experienced and interpreted. A central component to this course is a focus on practices of listening and it will place in conversation relevant discourse from the fields of voice studies, ethnomusicology, religious studies, and sound studies. Students will engage in methods of vocal analyses and religious studies methodologies on performativity and embodiment. Weekly topics and their affiliated readings will include, but are not confined to Islam and El-Ghayb; spiritualism; African-American sermon traditions; Hindu mysticism; American evangelicalism; Jewish aniconism.

Students learn techniques for generating and developing musical ideas through exercises and four main compositional assignments: a work for solo instrument, a theme and variations for solo instrument and piano, a song for voice and piano, and a multi-movement work for three to five instruments. Students also learn ways to discuss and critique their own and one another’s work. Ends with a concert of student compositions.\n\nPrerequisites: MUS 1401 or MUS 2401 or MUS 2402 or MUS 2403.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2023, Spring 2021.\n\nThe celebrated German film director Fatih Akin has stated, \"Film is a two dimensional thing—it goes up and down and left to right but if you put music into that two dimensional medium, it acquires a third, fourth, and fifth dimension.\" This course will explore the myriad ways that music creates deeper meaning in film. This will be accomplished through both analysis of preexisting films scores and composing original music for five common filmic categories: establishing sequences, montage sequences, dialogue underscoring, and action and love scenes. Students will need to be able to read music notation. (Same as: CINE 2502)\n\nPrerequisites: MUS 1401 or MUS 2403 or CINE 1000 - 2969 or CINE 3000 or higher.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Fall 2022.\n\nDo we understand improvised and composed music differently, and if so how?

This course will give students with experience in acting, singing, and dancing an opportunity to hone their skills together through the performance of songs and scenes from a variety of musical theater styles. Students will do projects in ballad singing, choral numbers, group dances, and acting the song. Actors, singers, choreographers, and musicians will be encouraged to work together in class and in evening rehearsals toward a public performance and a cabaret performance at the end of the semester. Performances will be grounded in historical readings and research that contextualizes the origins of the pieces being performed. (Same as: THTR 2205, DANC 2205)\n\nPrerequisites: THTR 1100 - 1799 or DANC 1100 - 1799.\n\nPrevious terms offered: Spring 2022.\n\nWhen we perform music on stage, what are we performing? Is it only the “music” or is there something more? When we watch a live musical performance, what are we taking into our bodies? Are we learning lessons about which bodies go with which music or who is allowed on a particular stage and who is “different” in that context? This course investigates lineages of performance practice for what these lineages teach about bodies and genre. For example, how did jazz music created in African American communities and initially replete with women artists in the 1920s turn into a musical community dominated by white middle-class boys and men? We will examine how musical lineages are constructed with particular attention to the history of segregation in post-secondary education in the United States. The course includes a final performance of a musical and/or theatrical nature. Previous music experience is not necessary but is welcomed.

Examines how gender and racial codes have been used historically, for example to describe music as “authentic” (rap, rock) or “commercial” (pop, new wave), and at how these codes may have traveled, changed, or re-appeared in new guises over the decades. Considers how gender and sexuality are inscribed at every level of popular music as well as how music-makers and consumers have manipulated these representations to transgress normative codes and open up new spaces in popular culture for a range of sexual and gender expressions. Juniors and seniors only; sophomores admitted with consent of the instructor during the add/drop period.

Musical genres covered range from early twentieth-century West African palm wine music to contemporary manifestations of hip hop across the African continent and include musical products of post-independence cultural policies and the transnational marketing niche of “Afropop.” The rise and popularity of these genres is historicized and analyzed in the context of major social, ideological, political, and economic forces that have shaped Africa over the past 100 years, including colonialism, modern urbanization, independence movements, and globalization. Course materials include writings from the fields of ethnomusicology, cultural studies, and postcolonial theory, musical audio and video recordings, and journalistic and promotional sources, as well as film documentaries.
