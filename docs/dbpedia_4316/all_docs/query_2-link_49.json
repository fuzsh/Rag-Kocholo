        "text": "William Bastianon is a composer, performer, arranger, and artist from Ontario, Canada. He is currently studying composition with Dr. Reiko Fueting.\n\nIn his work, Will seeks to blend music and storytelling, drawing from a deep love of musical theatre, jazz, popular, and classical traditions, blurring the lines between genres.\n\nUsing this eclectic mix of musical languages, Will strives for humour and clarity through a marriage of carefully chosen convention and emotionally charged content.\n\nThroughout his ongoing musical exploration,\n\nWill is constantly deepening his love and respect for the artistic process, collaboration, and his connection to the artists who came before him.\n\nWill has worked as an arranger and copyist for clients such as Nicolas Dromard (Broadway performer), Kate Schutt (singer-songwriter), and Voices Rock Canada (Canadian choir). He has written music for two Toronto Fringe shows (one of which he also performed in) and two independent short films (one of which he acted in).\n\nWebsite: https://www.willbastianon.com\n\nSebastian Block is a composer and classical guitarist. He is studying at the Manhattan School of Music under Professor David Adamcyck.\n\nSebastian was born and raised in Los Angeles, and currently resides in New York City. He started to take an interest in composition when a music teacher introduced him to Steve Reich’s Different Trains, opening him to the limitless nature of “classical music.” Since then, Sebastian has been inspired and influenced by a number of composers, including Lili Boulanger, Heitor Villa-Lobos, and John Adams.\n\nGrowing up in Los Angeles, Sebastian played in the rock band Swandive, and he was immersed in the city’s young artists’ scene. His many friends in art, film, and music also have greatly influenced his compositions.\n\nSebastian’s latest work, String Quartet No. 1, seeks to explore our minds and the memories we keep inside. It combines philosophical and scientific elements to create an immersive experience of exploring consciousness and perspective.\n\nJemina Brechoire is a Franco Algerian composer, pianist, vocalist, and producer. Having originally trained as a jazz pianist, Jemina entered Berklee College of Music with the prestigious Presidential Scholarship where she studied under the tutelage of Alain Mallet. There, she deepened her love for cross cultural music and interdisciplinary art.\n\nShe has an interest in folklore from all other the world that stems from her Franco-Algerian background and her exposure to many traditional folk genres from a young age (North African folklore, French chanson, Jazz).\n\nIt is an interest that has grown significantly when she moved to the United States having been exposed to ever more local traditions and people.\n\nAs an artist, she strives to be innovative and eclectic in all her creations. Jemina has arranged for Best Jazz Album Grammy Awards Nominee Tia Fuller, was the musical director of the Berklee Esperanza Spalding Ensemble, co-wrote with Tokyo Metropolitan Theater artistic director and avant-garde composer Dai Fujikura, and recorded for Cop21 premiered documentary “Terra Libra” amongst many other projects.\n\nIn her work she has been striving to connect seemingly unrelated themes, people, and places both through the medium of music and throughout her collaborations: her first album “22” was entirely produced and written by her and featured musicians from more than eight different countries. The album was recorded remotely due to the pandemic and pays tribute to North African Folklore, taking a global approach to music making and, hoping to serve as a medium to help composers and performers through uncertain times as it did for the composer herself.\n\nJemina sees her interests lying in creating a music in movement, centered around our multitudes. Although her first instrument is piano, she also started developing an interest for the voice early on. Listening to jazz records she discovered scat through Ella Fitzgerald and is, to this day, fascinated by the power and emotional intensity that vocalists can deliver even with a wordless approach to music. A lot of Jemina’s music pays tribute to that vocal jazz legacy and to the artists that have been reclaiming the voice as an instrument.\n\nThis coming month Jemina will be performing for the arrival of Little Amal in New York, an eleven-foot giant refugee puppet from Syria and symbol of international human rights.\n\nHer compositions have premiered in places such as the University of Toronto Massey College and Berklee Performance Center among others.\n\nwww.jeminamusic.com\n\nMarco Catella is a freshman student composer from Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was exposed to music throughout his life but developed a stronger interest in writing in 2019, at age 16. Although his musical influences are noticeably diverse, he attempts to unite them by creating vividly dramatic works. Wagner, Mahler, Strauss, and many film composers like Hermann and Rosza enkindled his love for drama. He majored in economics for one year in Argentina but decided to take the risk and study music. While unfamiliar with US music schools, he quickly fell in love with the Manhattan School of Music. After going through the thorough application process, including a very engaging interview, he visited the school and attended a concert. After that day, he had no doubt about which place would be best to cultivate his musical potential.\n\nIsaac Ismael Cortijo is a Brooklyn born and raised pianist, composer and conducting student.

Isaac aims to connect and communicate with his audience through his music to invoke an emotionally rich listening experience. He hypothesized that music, sound and frequency are what connect us all fundamentally as living beings and plans to explore that hypothesis in his future studies and explorations. As a student of Valerie Coleman, Isaac looks forward to learning more about what it means to be a composer, creator, and contributor to the arts.\n\nAlaina Ferris is an interdisciplinary composer, poet, and performer who specializes in choral works, opera, and contemporary theater.

He has been studying the saxophone and clarinet for seven years and participated in two All-State competitions with both. He discovered his desire to compose in elementary school and continued forward with his passion. In high school, he studied saxophone and clarinet privately with Mr. Don Goldstone, piano with Mrs. Blair Myers, and composition with Dr. Mathew Fuerst.\n\nHe is obsessed with a medley of composers and of the folk music from many cultures. He strongly believes that music is a universal medium and music must be able to resonate as strongly with everyone playing and listening. His music possesses strong melodicism and richly colorful harmonic palette, focusing on the intense joys and the cataclysmic lows of the human condition. He often derives music from nature, and alongside his synesthetic responses, finds music in every tenet of life.\n\nBesides music, he loves reading, studying butterflies and geology, hiking in the mountains, and talking with his friends and family.\n\nEric Impey is a contemporary classical composer and multi-instrumentalist, taking inspiration from pop, metal, jazz, and classical.\n\nHe began composing as a young child independently from the music classes he had been exposed to. He recalls seeing and hearing music in his head for as long as he can remember, which eventually became a desire to share those visions with an audience.\n\nEric’s development as a composer has been intense and unexpected. His formal composition instruction began at the age of 17, and his body of work spans early 2022 – present. While he studied piano, tuba via public education, and later guitar as an adolescent – he was not exposed to intensive music education in his youth. While he enjoyed his experience with the world of performance, he quickly recognized a more prominent and ever-present interest in composition that had underlined his musical journey.\n\nThis led to attending the Atlantic Music Festival, summer of 2022, followed by the Boston University Tanglewood Institute Young Artist’s Program, summer of 2023. His orchestra work, ‘The Floodgates’ had the honor to be debuted during the Tanglewood on Parade Young Artist concert.\n\nAs Eric embarks on his B.A. in Music at the Manhattan School of Music with mentor, Reiko Fueting, he seeks to expand his style and vocabulary within his compositions and experience the variety of music available during his time at MSM.\n\nWebsite: https://ericimpeymusic.com\n\nFrench undergraduate composer Gabriel Legros pronounced his wish to work in the field of Music from his early juvenescence.\n\nGabriel started his classical training in voice at age 4 and developed, throughout the years, an utter interest in multiple instruments such as the Piano, Classical Guitar, Bass Guitar and Cello.\n\nYears later, he began working intensely on his theory and ear training under the private tutelage and mentorship of Juilliard School professor Dr. Wayne Oquin.\n\nBeing an avid performer, Gabriel has performed in various venues including events involving high representatives of the French government, charitable organizations, and musicals amongst others.\n\nSoon after turning 17, Gabriel commenced showing a deep interest in Composition, which led him to ask Dr. Oquin to specifically instruct him on the subject. From there, Gabriel’s passion for composition never ceased to grow, to a point where he came to conclusion to pursue his studies in Conservatoire.\n\nIn September 2023, Gabriel will begin his Bachelor of Music at The Manhattan School of Music under the guidance of Dr. Reiko Füting, where he will develop his musical endeavors.\n\nShuwen Liao was born in China, graduated from the Music Middle School Affiliated to Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 2018, where she majored in composition with Dr. Wenpei Ju.
