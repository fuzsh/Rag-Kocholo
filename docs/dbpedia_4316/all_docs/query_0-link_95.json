        "text": "A world class guitar hero, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and composer, an international recording artist with over 20 acclaimed solo albums to date, and a soundtrack composer for film and television, GARY LUCAS is on the move in 2009.\n\nA world class guitar hero, a Grammy-nominated songwriter and composer, an international recording artist with over 20 acclaimed solo albums to date, and a soundtrack composer for film and television, GARY LUCAS is on the move in 2009. He was just cited as one of the “100 Greatest Living Guitarists” in Classic Rock magazine (UK). His latest album, a collaboration with Indian vocalist Najma Akhtar, is currently #4 on the World Music Charts Europe. Gary has performed This summer Gary sold-out the Holland Festival in Amsterdam 2 nights running with a new silent film score he performed live, made his performing debut in South Korea and Latin America (he has toured in 40 countries), recorded a new album with legendary Stones producer Andrew Loog Oldham in Bogota Colombia, and rocked festivals in France, Brazil and Spain.\n\nDubbed “The Thinking Man’s Guitar Hero” by The New Yorker, “The world’s most popular avant-rock guitarist” by The Independent (UK), “Legendary Leftfield guitarist” by The Guardian (UK), “Guitarist of 1000 Ideas” by The New York Times, “A true axe God” by Melody Maker, and “One of the five best guitarists in the world” by the national Czech newspaper Lidove Noviny, the British world music magazine fRoots recently described Gary Lucas as “without question, the most innovative and challenging guitarist playing today.” Rolling Stone’s David Fricke wrote: “Gary Lucas is one of the best and most original guitarists in America” in a review of Gary’s latest avant-rock album “Coming Clean”. Gary was also selected by the editors of DownBeat Magazine as one of their “Hot 66 6-Stringers”.\n\nGary Lucas tours the world relentlessly both solo and with several different ensembles, including his longtime band Gods and Monsters, whose ranks once included the late singer Jeff Buckley. Gary co-wrote two of Jeff Buckley’s most famous hits, “Grace” and “Mojo Pin”, which later became the title track and the opening track on Jeff’s double platinum Sony album “Grace”—which MOJO magazine recently named the #1 Modern Classic Rock Album. Gary and Jeff’s early collaborations can also be heard on the Jeff Buckley and Gary Lucas album “Songs to No One”, which charted internationally with worldwide sales approaching 100,000. Other notable Lucas releases include the soon-to-be reissued “The Edge of Heaven”, an album of Gary Lucas’ lush arrangements of classic 1930’s Chinese pop songs, which was #1 on the World Music charts and received rave reviews around the world from Rolling Stone to the Hong Kong Music Weekly. Gary’s compilation of the best of his early band and solo work entitled “Operators are Standing By” garnered a 4-star MOJO review: “This album confirms Gary Lucas as THE psychedelic guitarist for the post-modern set.” Most of Gary’s extensive back catalog as well as his current releases were recently licensed for digital distribution by IODA, and are now available on iTunes and on digital portals worldwide.\n\nGary Lucas leads several different ensembles, including his longtime NYC-based band Gods and Monsters, a super-group psychedelic jamband based around Gary’s guitar playing, singing, and Grammy-nominated songwriting, featuring Billy Ficca (Television) and Ernie Brooks (Modern Lovers). They recently played a Live Nation booked 20th Anniversary Show in NYC, and have a new live DVD and studio album wrapped, produced by Jerry Harrison (Talking Heads). Gary is also collaborating with the UK Indian vocalist Najma Akhtar, and their debut album “Rishte” was released this summer to 5 star reviews, with an upcoming tour in the works including an appearance at WOMAD Las Palmas in November. Gary also plays with vocalist Dean Bowman in their spiritual roots project Chase the Devil, with an upcoming European tour and debut album release. He also plays with DJ Cosmo in electronica duo Wild Rumpus, who have released 3 successful 12-inch singles to date with an album on the way. Gary Lucas also co-leads Fast ‘N’ Bulbous, who have released 2 albums devoted to the music of avant-rock visionary Captain Beefheart, who first put Gary Lucas on the musical map as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nDescribed as “a 21st century Cream” by Rolling Stone, Gods and Monsters also includes Jason Candler (Hungry March Band) on alto and tenor sax, and Joe Hendel (Faddy Acids) on trombone and keyboards. With their illustrious pedigrees they comprise an art-rock supergroup and a major cross-section of the rock avant-garde (Beefheart, Buckley, Television, Modern Lovers)—Time Out New York raving “The group is mind-blowing!” and The New Yorker hailing them as “An underground-rock fan’s dream team”.\n\nGods and Monsters have toured extensively in Europe over the years, most recently at festivals in the Austrian Tirol, in the Netherlands, and in Moscow and Saint Petersburg Russia in the company of former Talking Heads keyboardist and hit record producer Jerry Harrison (Live, OAR), who produced their latest studio album. Harrison joined the band live at South by Southwest in Austin Texas where Gary Lucas was given an unheard of double-length showcase for both his silent film/live music project “Gary Lucas Plays The Golem” and for Gods and Monsters, which garnered significant press attention—and Harrison played with them live in NYC at the CMJ Festival and also joined them at New York’s Knitting Factory for a concert with Czech underground band The Plastic People, where the group was greeted backstage by former Czech President Vaclav Havel and David Byrne. Gods and Monsters recently celebrated their 20th anniversary in June 2009 with an all-star concert at the Gramercy Theater in NYC, produced by Live Nation and featuring guest appearances from Gary’s friends Alan Vega (Suicide), Jon Spencer (Blues Explosion) and Lenny Kaye (Patti Smith).\n\n“Coming Clean”, the most recent Gods and Monsters album was released in 4 different international editions: in Russia under the title “Follow”, in the USA, Canada, and Japan; in the UK in France, and in the Benelux. The reviews were uniformly excellent, with Rolling Stone raving: “Gary Lucas is one of the best and most original guitarists in America…a songwriter of established invention…he plays astounding guitar throughout, but always for the sake of the song.” The album received 4 star reviews in MOJO, Uncut, and Record Collector, and also in France’s Crossroads and Vibrations. One of the standout tracks on “Coming Clean” was Gary’s song “Follow”, an anthem he wrote to comfort the victims of AIDS, which was performed in 2007 at a huge rally in the gay club Crobar in Manhattan attacking the Bush administration’s proposed anti-gay marriage constitutional amendment. The song was introduced and sung by Gary’s friend comedienne Sandra Bernhard, who performed with Gary to guitar.\n\nIn addition to being lionized by the critics, Gary’s work and playing has received much enthusiastic praise from his musical peers. He contributed a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “Ain’t Got You” to “Light of Day”, a Bruce Springsteen tribute album for charity, which prompted the Boss himself to remark: “You’re a phenomenal guitarist—and your version of my song is phenomenal as well!!.” Gary also recently received high compliments from Lou Reed, who praised his “lovely guitar playing” on his collaborations with Jeff Buckley, described Gary’s solo version of his song “European Son” as “Beyond Cool!”, and told him, “I could listen to you play for hours, Gary”.\n\nIn addition to Gods and Monsters, Gary co-leads with composer/musician Phillip Johnston a free jazz-oriented all instrumental 7-piece tribute band dedicated to the music of his former mentor Captain Beefheart (Don Van Vliet) featuring some of NYC’s greatest improvisers Fast ‘N Bulbous, The Captain Beefheart Project. Applying a free-wheeling horn and guitar-driven approach to the knotty avant-blues/rock/jazz compositions of Van Vliet, they’ve made triumphant appearances at the Saalfelden Festival in Austria, the Frankfurt Jazz Festival, and the Lisbon Jazz Em Agosto Festival. Their debut album “Pork Chop Blue Around the Rind” received much favorable praise worldwide, was profiled on NPR, and charted on college radio in the US. An extensive European tour last November saw them selling out shows at the London Jazz Festival and at Amsterdam’s BimHuis, as well as concerts in Bern, Vienna, Schwaz, and Llubljana Slovenia. In 2009 the band released their second Cuneiform album “WAXED OOP (An impetuous stream bubbled up)” which received rave reviews internationally.\n\nGary also played for several years as part of the reunion of Captain Beefheart alumni known as The Magic Band, performing with them at the UK’s famed Glastonbury Festival, London’s Shepherd’s Bush Empire, a sold-out night at Royal Festival Hall, and at the All Tomorrow’s Parties Festival in LA where they were introduced by Beefheart/Magic Band fan Matt Groening (The Simpsons), and in Camber Sands UK. They made several extensive UK and European tours, which took them to Amsterdam’s Paradiso, Belgrade Serbia, and to Sweden, where they performed live on Swedish national television. They released a rehearsal CD “Back to the Front”, cited as one of the albums of the year in The Wire, a live double album “21st Century Mirror Men”, and a live DVD/documentary, “Crow’s Milk” with narration by the late John Peel, one of Beefheart’s biggest champions. In fact, the legendary UK underground tastemaking DJ John Peel became one of Gary Lucas’ biggest champions shortly after The Magic Band recorded a live session for him, subsequently spinning several cuts from Gary Lucas’ solo albums on his widely listened-to program on the BBC on 2 separate broadcasts shortly before he died.\n\nOther long running media champions of Gary’s work on UK radio include the well-respected legendary world music maven Charlie Gillett, who invited Gary to perform live on his 20th anniversary show, Verity Sharp and Fiona Talkington who have featured Gary’s work on their BBC 3 experimental music programme Late Junction, and club music DJ king Rob Da Bank, who has repeatedly added the avant-dance music of Wild Rumpus, Gary’s DJ project with DJ Cosmo, Wild Rumpus, to his popular BBC radio program.\n\nGARY LUCAS established his reputation as a guitarist’s guitarist with 5 years spent playing with his childhood hero, the visionary avant-garde vocalist/composer/bandleader Captain Beefheart (a/k/a Don Van Vliet).\n\nA graduate of Yale University, where he was a DJ and served as Music Director at WYBC FM, Gary’s childhood dream of joining Beefheart’s band came true when he recorded two Captain Beefheart albums in the early 80’s on Virgin Records, “Doc at the Radar Station” (1980) and “Ice Cream for Crow” (1982), which featured his explosive solo renditions of Don Van Vliet’s twisted instrumental compositions, “Flavor Bud Living” and “Evening Bell”—about which the latter piece Esquire wrote “Gary Lucas apparently grew extra fingers in order to negotiate his way through it”. These recordings put Gary on the musical map as a force to be reckoned with, and laid the groundwork for his subsequent career.\n\nIn 1988, Gary Lucas mounted his first solo guitar show at New York’s downtown mecca for avant-garde and alternative music, the Knitting Factory, and was an instant hit. The club became the launching pad for Gary’s ensuing European success, as he was invited shortly after his first Knitting Factory gig to appear at the prestigious 1988 Berlin JazzFest, where a performance of his solo piece “Verklarte Kristallnacht” was broadcast live from the festival on WDR on the 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht and absolutely stunned the audience. The Berlin Morgenpost raved in a review the next day: “It is Lucas!”\n\nTo date Gary Lucas has released over 20 highly acclaimed albums in various different genres (psychedelic rock, solo acoustic, world music, electronic dance, rock-jazz, classical, ambient), played as a guest on over 50 other albums, and has performed in 40 countries around the world, from Tokyo to Tel Aviv.\n\nIn summer 2009 Gary made well received debuts in Latin America (closing the 1st International Sao Paulo Fantasy Film Festival SP Terror accompanying the silent horror film “The Golem” and performing and recording in Bogota Colombia with legendary Stones producer Andrew Loog Oldham) and in South Korea (appearing at the 5th Jecheon International Film and Music Festival with “The Golem”). He has performed in India with DJ Cosmo in their Wild Rumpus project, and made his Australian debut in the company of UK electronica band Future Sound of London and there returned recently for 4 triumphant shows at festivals in Sydney and Melbourne. He has been a regular visitor to London’s Royal Festival Hall (5 separate appearances) and Amsterdam’s famed Paradiso (over 20 separate appearances since 1980). He recently expanded his touring base to Russia, and has made 5 separate appearances in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In summer 2006 he performed his original solo guitar score accompanying the silent classic German horror film “The Golem” (1920, d. Paul Wegener and Carl Boese) in landmark cinemas in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, appeared on national tv before an estimated 50 million viewers, and was profiled in the Russian edition of Rolling Stone.\n\nSince debuting his live score for “The Golem” in the company of his original collaborator, keyboardist/composer Walter Horn in 1989 at the Museum of the Moving Image on a commission from the BAM Next Wave Festival, he’s played with “The Golem” in over 20 countries all over the world—including sold-out performances at the Venice Biennale, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, London’s Royal Festival Hall, in Budapest, in festivals in Spain, Switzerland and Italy, opening the New York Jewish Film Festival at Lincoln Center, as part of a weeklong artist-in-residency at the Quebec City Summer Festival, and in Prague, home of the Golem. He has also performed with the film at Atlanta’s Dragon*Con, the largest science fiction festival in the world.\n\nGary also tours with several other music and film projects, including “Sounds of the Surreal”, a program commissioned by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, accompanying 3 short silent film classics by Rene Clair, Fernand Leger, and Ladislaw Starewicz, with his original guitar scores—and “Monsters from the Id”, where Gary improvises live soundtracks to clips from horror classics by Roman Polanski, Mario Bava, Ray Harryhausen, and others. Gary presented the European premiere of “Sounds of the Surreal” in Vienna in September 2007, and in February 2009 played a triumphant performance before a packed hall in the Wintergarden of NYC’s World Financial Center. His most recent live silent film score is for the Lon Chaney film “The Unholy Three” (1925, d. Tod Browning), a commission from the Film Society of Lincoln Center which premiered to rave notices at Lincoln Center’s Walter Reade Theater in October 2009 . He is presently working on a new live score accompanying the 1931 Spanish-language “Dracula” (d. Enrique Tovar Avalos and Henry Melford) which he will premiere at the 35th Havana Film Festival in December. And Gary just received an invitation to perform the US premiere at the 48th New York Film Festival in Fall 2010.\n\nOver a long performing career Gary Lucas has played and collaborated with Leonard Bernstein, Captain Beefheart, Jeff Buckley, Lou Reed, John Cale, Robyn Hitchock, Nick Cave, David Johansen, jazz greats Roswell Rudd, Steve Swallow, Joe Lovano, Dave Liebman, the Willem Breuker Kollektieff, Yael Naim and David Donatien, Ninet Tayeb, Anath Benais, Bob Holman, Greg Cohen, Alan Vega, Piers Faccini, Ensemble Kamelon, Marc Ribot, Dean Bowman, Jennifer Charles, Lee Ranaldo, Mary Margaret O’Hara, John Zorn, Peter Stampfel, Patti Smith, Lenny Kaye, Jon Spencer, Mike Edison, Kevin Coyne, Claudia Brucken (Propaganda), Paul Humphreys (OMD).

Most recently his playing is featured prominently on former Soundgarden/Audioslave singer Chris Cornell’s new album “Carry On”, and he played and co-wrote a song on the new Onetwo album as well as the latest album by French singer Melissa Mars (Universal France).\n\nSome of these collaborations can be heard on his 20-year rarities retrospective album “Improve the Shining Hour” which also features excerpts of his film and tv music for ABC News. Exhibiting a flair for composing soundtrack music going back to early student films he made as a boy in both the narrative and documentary genres, Gary has gone on to score 8 documentaries for ABC shows “20/20” and “Turning Point”, as well as music for Showtime and HBO documentaries. He’s also produced several major label albums for composer/saxophonists Tim Berne and Peter Gordon (Columbia and Columbia Masterworks retrospectively) as well as for the French avant-rock band Tanger (French Mercury). In 2001 Gary scored the Oscar-nominated Maysles Films documentary “Lalee’s Kin: The Legacy of Cotton” for HBO, which recently screened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York as part of their Maysles Films 50 Year Retrospective, and about which Variety wrote: “Gary Lucas’ Delta blues guitar music adds vivid color to this report from America’s forgotten underbelly.” And he’s composed music for documentaries shown on Showtime (“Trust Me”), PBS (“Mayor of the West Side”, nominated for an Emmy this year), and at international film festivals (“The Legacy of Jedwabne”, which was also broadcast internationally).\n\nAdditionally Gary’s services as producer have resulted in several major label albums for composer/saxophonists Tim Berne and Peter Gordon on Columbia Records and Columbia Masterworks retrospectively, as well as for the French avant-rock band Tanger (French Mercury).\n\nThe breadth and scope of Gary Lucas’ work is impressive, and he straddles genres with ease. His 2001 entry in the World Music category, “The Edge of Heaven” a dreamy melodic album featuring his arrangements of Chinese pop music of the 1930s, was #1 on the World Music Charts in Canada, and garnered an unbelievable amount of international attention, England’s Q Magazine awarding it 4 Stars, and MOJO writing: “It is simply gorgeous.” In addition, the album was chosen as one of the Best Discs of the year in France’s Liberation newspaper. Gary’s experiences making the album also was also the subject of a lengthy profile for the album in The Wall Street Journal, as well as an NPR interview. The title song from the album was featured on the soundtrack to the Bill Moyers PBS Series “Becoming American: The Chinese Experience”. The album is scheduled for re-release on the Knitting Factory label in 2010 with additional bonus tracks.\n\nGary’s latest foray into the World Music genre is a new duo album collaboration with the UK Indian-based vocalist Najma Akhtar, who has released many solo albums of her own and has collaborated in the past with Page and Plant and Andy Summers. Gary and Najma’s album “RISHTE”, an album fusing folk, blues, raga, rock and more, was released on World Village/Harmonia Mundi worldwide in summer 2009 and continues to receive accolades around the world, including a 5 star review in the Financial Times.\n\nThe critical raves go hand in hand with Gary’s international press standing.\n\nIn the last few years Gary has been profiled and interviewed in Rolling Stone, DownBeat, the Columbia University Spectator, Record Collector, The Wire, MOJO, the International Herald Tribune, the French daily paper Liberation, featured on the cover of the Jewish Weekly Forward, and profiled in the national Dutch newspaper Het Parool.\n\nRecent live appearances include a specially commissioned concert at the Czech Embassy in Washington DC by invitation of the Czech ambassador to the US spotlighting Gary’s solo guitar arrangements of Czech classical music in honor of the 14th anniversary of the Czech Velvet Revolution (Gary is of Bohemian descent on his father’s side). Gary has also made several solo tours of Spain, which resulted in much media appearances on national Basque radio and TV, and recently joined forces with the famous Spanish spoken word artist Bruno Galindo which resulted in a sold-out appearance in Mexico’s Casa de Lago in the fall of 2008 and several very well received shows in NYC. The duo is working on a new album together scheduled fusing Galindo’s surrealistic poetry with Gary’s ambient guitar.\n\nGary Lucas has also lectured over the years on his life and career in music, his songwriting technique, extensive collaborations, and the music business from the inside, at the Amsterdam Music Conservatorum, Yale University (his alma mater), the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, New York University and Columbia University. He also has given guitar master classes at Amsterdam’s Paradiso, the Amsterdam Music Conservatorum, and at the University of Hawaii. In March 2006 he gave a lecture and solo performance at McGill University in Montreal for a course taught by Prof. Sandy Pearlman (Blue Oyster Cult/Clash producer) and Music School Dean Don McLean entitled “Bruckner and Heavy Metal”, where Gary performed his “Bruckner Fantasia” based on themes from Bruckner’s 8th Symphony, which was filmed and broadcast on CTV, the Canadian national television network. He also recently gave a Master Class and lecture at The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music, as part of their “Eyes of the Masters” series.\n\nRecent soundtrack work includes an original music for Sebastian Doggart’s “American Faust: From Condi to Neo-Condi”, which was just nominated for the Maysles Award for Best Documentary at the Starz Denver Film Festival. “Trust Me”, a Showtime documentary about a summer camp for Christian, Muslim and Jewish children, and a score for Slawomir Grunberg’s “They Called Me Mayer July” (2009) and also for his award-winning documentary “Bed and Breakfast 9/11”, which was shown on PBS. In addition he scored and is interviewed in Grunberg’s “The Legacy of Jedwabne,” which is continually playing the international film festival circuit and has been broadcast internationally. He also has contributed music to several BBC documentaries recently as well as a Canadian Movie of the Week, “Dragon Boys.” Gary recently wrapped an original score for a new documentary about American Ivy League collegiate football, “For Love and Honor” (2008, d. Erik Anjou) as well as a new score for the Emmy award-winning documentary filmmaker Peter Bull for his latest film “Dirty Business—Clean Coal and the Battle for Our Energy Future”, which was funded and commissioned by the Center for Investigative Research.\n\nRecent collaborations include several albums with Dutch lutist Jozef Van Wissem, including “The Universe of Absence,” and “Diploplia”, and the pair recently performed live on the Dutch national tv network VPRO show “Free Sounds”.\n\nGary Lucas is also working with the UK-based DJ Cosmo (Colleen Murphy) on a dance-oriented duo project called Wild Rumpus. Their first single “Musical Blaze-Up” sold-out it’s 12-inch vinyl run in 2 days upon release in May 2007, was played extensively on the BBC and on European radio, received rave reviews in Time Out London, Time Out New York, and HITS Magazine, and was chosen as one of the Best of the Week by iTunes UK, who made it available for download on a special sampler alongside new tracks by Prince, Crowded House and Gwen Stefani. Their second single “Purple Somersault” was similarly well received and sold out its vinyl pressing almost immediately. Gary has been performing DJ improv sets with Cosmo as Wild Rumpus in a variety of exotic locales, including high profile gigs in Romania and India, and at the London ICA. They recently made their live NYC debut before a full house at famed New York dance club Cielo. A third single “Rock the Joint” featuring UK Human Beatbox Champion Beardyman crashed into the UK dance charts on the heels of a hand animated video by Tabitha O’Connell (Ren and Stimpy) , and a fourth single “Kazan” was released in Japan in summer 2009. An album release is scheduled for 2010.\n\nIn addition, Gary recently released a new collaborative album with UK electronica ensemble The Dark Poets (James Hunter and Sarah Hilliard) “Beyond the Pale” on the Some Bizarre label. In a review of the album the Independent (UK) wrote: “Gary Lucas is possibly the world’s most popular avant-rock guitarist.”\n\nIn 2009 Gary Lucas released a collaborative album with Swiss avant-garde guitarist Gerald Zbinden entitled “Down the Rabbit Hole”, an epic sound phantasmagoria without words that is racking up impressive reviews internationally. Moors Magazine (Holland) wrote: “Sound so sophisticated and so unusual, they magically transport you without the aid of overdubs. This album is an absolute must!” Just out is a new collaboration “The Exploding Note Theory” with Italian psych-rockers Gallo + The Roosters which was chosen Album of the Month in Blow Up magazine (Italy).\n\nScheduled for a February 2010 release on Knitting Factory Records is the debut album from Chase the Devil, Gary’s new spiritual roots duo with jazz/blues vocalist Dean Bowman (Screaming Headless Torsos, Don Byron). The duo recorded their debut album with Steve Addabo (Shawn Colvin) and are about to embark on a European tour spanning 6 countries in Nov. 2009.\n\nAnd look for a new DVD to be issued in 2010 featuring Gary’s new collaborative score composed with Dutch-Iranian composer Reza Namavar for Abel Gance’s 1919 silent anti-war masterpiece “J’Accuse” which sold out its premiere two nights in a row in the Amsterdam Stadtsshouwburg in June 2009 as part of the Holland Festival. Featuring Gary performing with the Dutch Ensemble Kamelon led by Wilmar Devisser and featuring violinst Emi Ohi Resnick, the DVD will contain the recently restored print of “J’Accuse” courtesy of the Netherlands Film Museum—and plans are afoot for more live performances to support the DVD release in a variety of venues internationally.\n\nAlso in the works for a 2010 release is a new album of instrumental versions of classic Rolling Stones hits arranged and performed by Gary in the company of several outstanding Latin American musicians, recorded in Bogota and produced by legendary Stones producer Andrew Loog Oldham.\n\nAll in all, GARY LUCAS continues to live up the credo of his favorite artist, Bob Dylan—“He not busy being born is busy dying”—by continuing to record, release and perform an astonishing variety of music in as many arenas of the global village as possible."
