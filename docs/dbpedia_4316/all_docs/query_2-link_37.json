        "text": "Of the many musical genres that Bach cultivated during his lifetime, none has enjoyed more lasting influence than the prelude and fugue.\n\nThe fugue is a strict form that challenges both the performer and the listener.\n\nThe prelude is something quite different -- a warmup, if you will, to prepare the crowd -- and the fingers -- for what's to come.\n\nWhere the fugue is direct, the prelude is more of a fantasy and \"moody.\"\n\nListen online to one of the finest Bach interpreters, Hungarian organist Balint Karosi -- First Prize winner at the 16th International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition in Leipzig. He plays Bach's Prelude and Fugue in B minor, BWV 544 in a concert from Oberlin College.\n\n---\n\nMichael Barone hosts an all-day free \"concert crawl\" on Saturday -- the day before Bach's birthday.\n\nThe first hour will be broadcast live on Classical MPR. Performers include organist, Raymond Johnston; harpsichordists, Paul Boehnke and Tami Morse; the Bach Society Chorus, and the Choir of St Mark's Cathedral."
