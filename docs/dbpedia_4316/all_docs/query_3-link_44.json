        "text": "Saturday 9th May 2015, 8:00pm (Doors open at 7:30pm)\n\nBerry School of Arts\n\nTickets: $47.50, or $68.50 w/meal or $154.50 for a Festival Pass\n\nTo purchase tickets in person visit the Berry Music Centre, located at 1/118 Queen Street, Berry.\n\nPhillip Johnston is an American jazz musician and composer who divides his time between Sydney and New York. As a composer, he has composed theatre music for the Bell Shakespeare Company and film music for Paul Mazursky, Henry Bean and Philip Haas; his silent film scores have been performed at the New York Film Festival, across Europe, and at the Melbourne Festival and Perth Film Festival. His collaboration with graphic artist Art Spiegelman, Wordless, has recently made a nine-city tour of the US, following its premiere at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nIn March of 2015, he did a one-week residency at The Stone in New York, in which he presented 12 different ensembles over six days. In Berry, he will recreate some of this music with a group of top-shelf Australian jazz musicians. Drawing upon his work with The Microscopic Septet and Big Trouble, this seven-piece ensemble featuring four saxophones will present an evening of original swinging jazz, blues and Latin music that “infuses big-band-era dance music with beguilingly modernist sensibilities” (Jazziz). John Shand of the Sydney Morning Herald called Manhattan Moonrise, his most recent record with The Microscopic Septet, “one of the most distinctive sounds in contemporary jazz.”\n\nSpecial supper tickets are available for the concert with local caterer Garnish supplying fresh, delicious antipasto platters.\n\nPhillip Johnston (soprano sax) Peter Farrar (alto sax) Jeremy Rose (tenor sax) James Loughnan (baritone sax) Matt McMahon (piano) Jonathan Zwartz (bass) Nic Cecire (drums)"
