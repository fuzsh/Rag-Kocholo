        "text": "Cult Icon Eugene Chadbourne returns to Tour Australia for the first time in 13 years with Andy Burns + Esse & The Brave New Sounds! Eugene has worked extensively with the likes of Jello Biafra in Mojo Nixon, Jimmy Carl Black from Zappa’s Mothers of Invention & John Zorn just to name a few, he is beloved by cultural icon’s like Lydia Lunch and experimenters who look up to him as one of the Pioneers of the Avant Garde. Don’t miss out on seeing him play his genre-defying, boundary smashing mix of psychedelic punk, folk, spiritual jazz, experimental, Shockabilly, Freedom-Lovin’ repertoire. Joining Eugene on stage will be Sydney Jazz Great Phillip Johnston on saxophone, Phillip has worked with a number of associates, many of whom have become life long collaborators, such as John Zorn, Joel Forrester, Eugene, Bill & Wayne Horvitz, Dave Hofstra, Richard Dworkin, Shelley Hirsch, Bruce Ackley and Jon Raskin. Recently lauded by the Sydney Morning Herald as “one of the most distinctive sounds in contemporary Jazz” for his recent performance at the Opera House.\n\nOpening for Eugene is Perth Sensation Andy Burns – an electrifying lyricist and performer who brings elements of Bryan Ferry, Adam Ant & Eno in his lyrical guise & Pop/Rock/Art Rock Outfit Esse & The Brave New Sounds deliver a versatile mix of classic catchy tunes. A riveting band made up of sensual Frontwoman Susannah Powell, Nilstock on lead guitar (UnAustralians, SSS, Housing Project), Danny Heifetz on the Kit (Mr. Bungle, Secret Chiefs, Umlaut) & Wylie J (the man many of us have seen rocking our Melbourne Streets with his Olympia Bass & it’s Rainbow Strings).
