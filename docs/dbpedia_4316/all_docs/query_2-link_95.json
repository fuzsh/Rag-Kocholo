        "text": "Title: The Unconventional Journey: From Classical Strings to Rock ‘n’ Roll Riffs I’ve been strumming the guitar since my days in boarding school, a journey that began not out of passion, but due to a directive from my father and housemaster. They envisioned me as the next Louis Armstrong, pushing me into the world of trumpets. However, my disdain for the brass was palpable, and it wasn’t long before I traded a high-end trumpet for a rebellious, yet perpetually out-of-tune £50 guitar. Self-taught from the echoes of The Rolling Stones that filled my room, I tried to emulate Keith Richards’ haunting sound but soon realized that achieving his unique tune was a feat of its own. My classical and jazz attempts felt like misguided detours, yet they secretly laid the groundwork for a deeper understanding of music’s various layers. The real transformation began with the blues and the pivotal switch to Open G tuning—an open door to a new world where the guitar seemed to breathe and invite endless creativity. This style, favored by legends like Richards, was not just about playing; it was about feeling the music and letting loose on the riffs that spontaneously burst forth. Now, years down the line, I’m no guitar hero, but I’ve found my groove in simplicity and emotion—key ingredients to originality in music. Unlike the flashy virtuosos who fade into the background, my tunes aim to resonate with the soul of rock ‘n’ roll. Whether it’s through a simple riff or a catchy chorus, I strive to create songs that stick with you, the kind you’d hum in the shower or belt out during a drive. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best creativity comes from letting go—whether it’s reflecting on youthful rebellions or just losing yourself in the music. After all, it’s only rock ‘n’ roll, but I love it. And as I continue to navigate this musical journey, I carry with me the wisdom that authenticity often speaks louder than complexity in the quest to touch hearts with a guitar.\n\nOur manager stole our music and sold it to Metallica, Led Zeppelin and Van Halen. At least, that was the backstory of my air guitar band band (Air on Maiden). --- 20 years ago, I accidentally became an air guitar champ. And I decided to go all in. For two years, we toured Europe. With a change of clothes and a good story. (I share it in the video below) What a short career in air guitar taught me: 1/ The stories we believe about ourselves shape our reality. (Some people even didn’t notice we didn’t play proper instruments.) 2/ Ideas are nothing without execution. (We rehearsed daily, and analysed every show. Being funny is no excuse for not being a pro.) 3/ Own the script. (The best remedy for stage fright, or any scary new venture: act \"as if \"you’ve done it a thousand times before) 4/ Think big, act small. (We had tape on stage (invisible to the crowd) to remind us where our ‘amps’ were. We had a roadie to tune our invisible guitars. And we always carried guitar picks. ) 5/ Boundaries create freedom. (We had agreed to exist for two years, and not a day longer. It created freedom, and focus. We gave our all, and then said goodbye.) 6/ Lots of love in, lots of love out. (The energy you radiate comes back to you.) This applies when you’re playing a festival crowd. And it applies when you’re appearing on a podcast. --- Being invited to Anya's show was yet another slightly terrifying (and hugely joyful) experience. We talked about: • founder and origins stories • the breakdown that led me to do what I do now • the significance of connecting with \"people like you.\" • my role at KdG and impacting the lives of our students • flipping the script: accepting pain as a gift • stories as a superpower • and of course: air guitar The link to the show is in the comments. PS: I'm speaking at two higher education conferences this week, so might be slow to respond, (& will post less) PPS: If you're a participant at one of these conferences, it's okay to ask me if I brought my air guitar. (the answer is 'depends who's asking') #podcast #interview #storytelling #originstories\n\n50 years ago on June 29, 1974, Neil Peart replaces John Rutsey as the drummer for Rush. Rutsey played on the band's first album, but Peart played on the next 18, joining singer/bassist/keyboardist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson in one of the most productive ventures in rock history. Peart was born in Hamilton, Ontario (75 miles from Buffalo). In addition to percussion, he was also the band’s primary lyricist who wrote: “One likes to believe in the freedom of music, but glittering prizes and endless compromises shatter the illusion of integrity.” -‘The Spirit Of Radio’ “Any escape might help to soothe the unattractive truth, but the suburbs have no charms to soothe the restless dreams of youth” -‘Subdivisions’ “He's noble enough to know what's right, but weak enough not to choose it. He's wise enough to win the world, but fool enough to lose it.” -‘New World Man’ Knowledgeable and articulate, this explanation he offered to Drum! magazine about why he breaks in new cymbals sums up why he was nicknamed ‘The Professor’: “I have long felt that a much-played cymbal changes in many ways from a bright new one. For example, over time a ride cymbal develops a subtle array of overtones across the bow that lends it a more complex attack, and the bell becomes warmer and more musical. With crash cymbals, the difference is more immediate, and greater: after 2 or 3 shows, the attack, swell, and decay become more unified, and even the physical movement of a struck cymbal becomes more responsive – it starts to ‘dance’.” Below is a link to Rush’s Tom Sawyer that Geddy Lee called “In many ways, [] the quintessential Rush song.\" If he’s right, Peart’s drums are quintessential to the quintessential Rush song. Peart said in an interview with the CBC: “Music is certainly about sharing your enthusiasm. . . And in the writing, too, these were things that I was moved to write about…And if you do infect them with your fire…The literal meaning of enthusiasm is infected with the God and if you can share that God, that fire, of yours to light someone else’s, that’s a great thing.” During that same interview, he talked about how much it meant to him when Taylor Hawkins, the drummer of the Foo Fighters, showed him a photo of Hawkins’ son playing drums in front of an old banner with Peart’s picture on it. The banner had inspired Hawkins as a kid so he tracked it down on eBay for his son. Neil Peart lost his battle with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020. On hearing the news, Dave Grohl issued a statement: “I still vividly remember my first listen of ‘2112’ when I was young. It was the first time I really listened to a drummer. And since that day, music has never been the same. His power, precision, and composition was incomparable. He was called ‘The Professor’ for a reason: We all learned from him.” Taylor Hawkins said: “Neil Peart had the hands of God. End of story.” Neil Peart was 67 years old.\n\nParadox Guitars: Harmonizing Tradition and Innovation Dive into the rhythm of Paradox Guitars, where we're pioneering the next wave of musical evolution.

Musicians of the ear are the type who improvise, jam, and feel the music. Musicians of the eye are the classically trained ones who expertly read the music on the printed page. Of course, there are the types who possess degrees of both, but probably still tend more one way or the other. I see a lot of similarities to this phenomenon in software engineering. There are the “developers of the ear” that are typically self taught, often from a more creative background. They have a feel and instinct for writing good software. And there are “developers of the eye”, that typically come from a formal IT education, and often come from a more analytical and process minded background. And of course, in the real world, we tend to have elements of both. It presents some interesting challenges for how these two types of personalities work together. I suspect the developers with a more creative bent might struggle to work in teams more. And the ones with a more analytical bent might struggle to imagine what a “good” finished product looks like. I lean more to the “developer of the ear” end, and not surprisingly the same as a musician (can’t read sheet music, but I can replicate rhythms and harmonies pretty well). What about you? If you’re a developer, which way does your background lean?\n\nCris Cohen: I would classify your playing on most of these songs (on the album \"Velvet Kiss, Lick of the Lime\") as… it’s almost like your guitar work is kind of another backing vocal. There’s a harmony to it, a lyrical essence to it. It’s not just a show-off shred kind of thing, but more… Michael Lockwood of Lions & Ghosts: There’s no more shredding now. [Laughs] Cris Cohen: …but more layers of, again, it’s like a harmony. I’m curious, how did you develop that style? Where did that come from with you? Michael Lockwood: That’s a great question. And I, obviously, have a lot of guitar player friends and we always sort of talk about guitar players and what we like about them and who influenced us. And I’ve always been the guy that says, “Listen. There’s no vocals happening. There has to be an event. But I don’t think it needs to be a shredded event. I want it to be lyrical and melodic. I want it to be something that sets up something that’s about to happen or an answer to something that just went by.” And it’s the way that I think if I’m playing bass or if I’m playing keyboard or anything. That’s my first thought, “What serves this song? What serves this singer? Do I mimic the melody of the chorus on my solo?” I don’t know where I got that from. I grew up listening to the Beatles. That was sort of my first big musical influence. Clearly, those guys are great crafters of arrangement and ideas and little things that orchestrate their music. So, probably some of it’s that. And a lot of the guitar players I listen to and grew up listening to, like James Honeyman-Scott from The Pretenders… Even Jimmy Page is a parts player. I know that he’s a shredder too, but he’s really an orchestrator of parts. And I really enjoy that when I’m working on music."
