        "text": "Music addict. Spent too long and all my money chasing tapes, records, cds and now music ‘files’. Introduced to metal as a child(about 9), probably still my first love. I’ve always been open to interesting music be it stone roses, throwing muses, at the same time as Slayer and Suicidal Tendencies. Partial to a bit of Hip hop(though mostly older stuff) electronica, folk, jazz as much as modern extreme metal and stuff with a post in it somewhere.\n\nPreviously wrote for Sludgelord, Dan(editor) let me contribute to E+D now and then. Since 2013 rolled in I’ve been encouraged (he holds a gun to my head, help!) by Metal Editor Sander to contribute more. Which I’m happy to do as I can’t stop seeking new music and feel the need to tell people. Its the online version of the mad drunk on the bus no-one makes eye contact with. That’s me, wide-eyed deranged shouting about bandcamp discoveries."
