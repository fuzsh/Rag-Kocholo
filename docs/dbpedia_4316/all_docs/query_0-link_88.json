        "text": "The following individuals will be performing in 100% all-new collaborations during High Zero 2007--\n\nFrom Afar:\n\nJaap Blonk\n\nvoice, electronics\n\nHolland\n\nJaap Blonk (born 1953 in Woerden, Holland) is a self-taught composer, performer and poet. He went to university for mathematics and musicology but did not finish those studies. In the late 1970s he took up saxophone and started to compose music. A few years later he discovered his potential as a vocal performer, at first in reciting poetry and later on in improvisations and his own compositions. For almost two decades the voice was his main means for the discovery and development of new sounds. From around the year 2000 on Blonk started work with electronics, at first using samples of his own voice, then extending the field to include pure sound synthesis as well. He took a year off of performing in 2006. As a result, his renewed interest in mathematics made him start a research of the possibilities of algorithmic composition for the creation of music, visual animation and poetry.\n\nAs a vocalist, Jaap Blonk is unique for his powerful stage presence and almost childlike freedom in improvisation, combined with a keen grasp of structure. He performed in many European countries, as well as in the U.S. and Canada, Indonesia, Japan, South Africa and Latin America. With the use of live electronics the scope and range of his concerts has acquired a considerable extension.\n\nBesides working as a soloist, he collaborated with many musicians and ensembles in the field of contemporary and improvised music, like Maja Ratkje, Mats Gustafsson, Nicolas Collins, Joan La Barbara, The Ex, the Netherlands Wind Ensemble and the Ebony Band. He premiered several compositions by the German composer Carola Bauckholt, including a piece for voice and orchestra. A solo voice piece was commissioned by the Donaueschinger Musiktage 2002. On several occasions he collaborated with visual computer artist Golan Levin.\n\nBlonk's work for radio and television includes several commissioned radio plays. He also makes larger-scale drawings of his scores, which are being exhibited.\n\nHe was the founder and leader of the long-standing bands Splinks (modern jazz, 1983-1999) and BRAAXTAAL (avant-rock, 1987-2005). He also has his own record label, Kontrans, featuring a total of 15 releases so far. Other Blonk recordings appeared on Staalplaat, Basta and VICTO.\n\njaapblonk.com\n\nJaimie Branch\n\ntrumpet\n\nChicago\n\nJaimie Branch is a trumpeter interested in sounds. She lives in Chicago where she plays an active role in the creative music scene as a performer, recording engineer, and presenter.\n\nmyspace.com/jaimiebranch\n\nAsimina Chremos\n\nmovement\n\nChicago\n\nCalled \"a strong, elegant, long-limbed dancer who moves with a sense of stark drama and genuine lyricism\" by the Chicago Sun-Times (12/18/06), Asimina Chremos had intensive early training in classical ballet and later forayed into studies with postmodernists such as Simone Forti and Ishmael Houston-Jones. Chremos was a member of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater from 1983-86, during which time she danced corps and soloist roles in works by Balanchine and full length classics under the direction of Patricia Wilde. Her desire to experience a deeper level of creativity and curiosity in the dance studio and on the stage eventually led her to earn a BFA in Dance from Temple University, where she was introduced to the work of Rudolph Laban, the history of American modern dance and perhaps most significantly, contact improvisation. She graduated summa cum laude in 1991. Since that time she has worked independently and consistently as a dancer, choreographer, educator and collaborator. Recent influences on Chremos' process include regular investigation of vinyassa-style yoga, Klein/Mahler Technique and contact improvisiation; as well as collaboration with musicians such as experimental vocalist Carol Genetti. Since receiving a Chicago Dancemakers Forum Grant in 2005, Chremos has opened an inquiry into her Greek cultural heritage, particularly the solo dance known as zembekiko. This has resulted in performances and collaborations with the Hellenic Museum and Cultural Center and New York-based artist Angela Kariotis.\n\nasiminachremosdance.net\n\nAaron Dilloway\n\n8-tracks, electronics, voice\n\nAnn Arbor\n\nAaron Dilloway has been releasing and recording music since the age of 16. He is a former guitarist and tape manipulator for the noise rock band Wolf Eyes, which he left in 2005 to live most of that year in Kathmandu, Nepal. While his wife did her graduate work there, he roamed the streets recording every sound he could, many of which are used in his recent recordings and performances. Currently he runs the noise label and mailorder Hanson Records in Ann Arbor, Michigan which he began in 1994, and performs solo using eight track tapes and vocal sounds. He also currently records modular synthesizer music as Spine Scavenger, and more recently with an ever-changing cast of sound artists under the name The Nevari Butchers.\n\nhansonrecords.net\n\nChris Heenan\n\ncontrabass clarinet, alto saxophone\n\nGermany\n\nChris Heenan is an active performer and organizer of experimental music working on projects in which improvisation is a major component. He plays alto saxophone, contrabass clarinet and analog synthesizer in contexts ranging from solo to large groups. In 2004 he founded REIFY, a recording label specializing in experimental and improvised music, and in 2002 he co-founded LINE SPACE LINE, a new and improvised music series and yearly festival in Los Angeles dedicated to improvised music that ran through August 2005. His regular groups include Team Up, a trio with guitarist Jeremy Drake and a revolving third member percussionist, Phantom Limb and Bison with Chris Forsyth (guitar), Jaime Fennelly (electronics) and Shawn Hansen (organ) and both acoustic and electric duos with percussionist / light artist Michael Vorfeld. Recent releases include Exclusively in Wire by Team Up, Widerstand, an analog synthesizer and light bulb duo with Michael Vorfeld, Half Cloud, Half Plain, a contrabass clarinet and percussion duo with Michael Vorfeld and The Hot Days with The Dietrich Eichmann Ensemble.

He has deep-seated love and respect for jazz traditions, ingrained by instructors like Shelly Berg and Larry Slezak. In a tribute to Houston musicians, he compiled and published the first Houston Musician's Realbook. He has appeared at the Montreux Jazz Festival, and has recorded with Joe LoCascio, Carol Morgan, Chris Connolly, Smitty, Kevin Patton, & Cindy Scott.\n\nThomas brings all of his passion and experience for jazz to the table when it comes to his other half, avant-garde music. Early in his jazz career, Thomas was inspired by the sounds of John Zorn and Peter Kowald to venture outside mainstream musical bounds. This journey began with the Rosta Jazz Avengers, a Houston-based quartet all about free improvisation and sonic exploration. Thomas quickly jumped into composition, beginning to develop a style that combines thematic composition with free improvisation, a sort of loosely controlled writing style showcasing his hand-selected performers. His accomplishments in the genre include: Recipient of Houston Arts Alliance composer grant, 2007; Curator of the Sunday Sonorities series at DiverseWorks, Houston; Featured performer at the High Zero Festival 2007, Baltimore; Five commissions from the Michele Brangwen Dance Ensemble; NYC tour, 2007, including premiering new works at The Stone; DiverseWorks artist residency for \"Pride,\" a music & video collaboration with Maria del Carmen Montoya; Performer at the Norcal Noise Fest, 2003; Member of the Society of Improvised Music; Composed/Collaborated with the Michele Brangwen Dance Ensemble.\n\nThomas has released three albums to date. \"Good Robot\" (2007) and \"Experimentations in Minimalism\" (2006) feature compositions for small ensemble. \"Doublebass\" (2003) is a collection of live, freely-improvised solo performances. Thomas also appears on the 2003 Norcal Noise Fest compilation CD, as well as the KUHF \"The Front Row\" 2006 compilation CD.\n\nthomashelton.com\n\nSofia Jernberg\n\nvoice\n\nSweden\n\nSofia Jernberg, vocalist and composer born in Ethiopia in 1983.

She has also played together with GUSH (Mats Gustafsson, Raymond Strid and Sten Sandell). Together with pianist Cecilia Persson she co-leads the group paavo. They released their debut album in February 2007 on Apart records. paavo is an example of how free improvised and notated music can interact. Sofias music has frequently been broadcasted by Swedish national radio. She has also received several scholarships, among them one from STIM (Swedish Performing Rights Society) and two from The arts grants committee. She is also an active board member of FRIM (The Association for Free Improvised Music in Sweden).\n\nMatthias Kaul\n\npercussion, hurdy-gurdy\n\nGermany\n\nMatthias Kaul started as a Rock- and Jazzdrummer.

She uses the same two looped pedals to create deceptively simple rhythms and textures over rich backgrounds. Her live performances are known for their bursts of energetic sound that are as intense as they are brief. Donna has performed extensively throughout the U.S. and Europe, released a full length solo LP on the Twisted Village label and is also a frequent collaborator with Jessica Rylan (Can't) and Boston art rockers Neptune.\n\nEve Risser\n\nprepared piano, toys, voice\n\nFrance\n\nEve has her musical roots in chamber music as a flutist and pianist. While residing in Alsace, France, she merged in to the contemporary and jazz/improvised music world. Eves multifaceted musical creativity has been heard in various settings and groups throughout Europe, USA and Japan. She has had the opportunity to play with interesting improvisers in a broad range of contexts, such as in theatre, dance, poetry, children, solo performances, contemporary and live soundtracks to films. This young improvising version of Conlon Nancarrow uses piano, flute, Ondes Martenot, voice, composition and sound objects (toys, Barbie guitar, Theremin, turntables etc) and moves boundless between written current music, improvised music, Free Jazz and Metal. Curently Eve´s musical life is based out of Paris where she is involved in organizing contemporary and improvised music live performances and a festival. Eve has had the possibility to play with great musicians such as Joel Grip, Yuko Oshima, Caroline Kraabel, Nina de Heney, Michael Zerang, David Stackenäs, Christine Senhaoui, Sofia Jernberg, Shelly Blake, Charlie Haden, Tim Murphy, Niklas Barnö, Adolfo Kaplan, Joris Rühl, Seiko Fukushima, to name a few.\n\nMatana Roberts\n\nsaxophones\n\nNew York\n\nMatana ( mah-tah-Na) Roberts is a dynamic saxophonist, composer and improviser, who tries to expose in her music the mystical roots and spiritual traditions of African American creative expression.\n\nAs a Chicago native and a member of the AACM (Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians) she was fortunate enough to be surrounded by elder musicians who showed her by distinct example the importance of listening to one's personal creative voice while at the same time using the profound and many layered traditions of jazz and improvised musics to act only as her creative guide, not as her creative definer. By using their mentorship, she has been able to craft a voice and creative focus that truly speaks to her own true artistic individuality. She feels strongly that her music should not only reflect the many colors and moods of universal human emotions, but that it should also testify, critique, document, and respond to the many socio-economic, historical, and cultural inequalities that exist not only in this country, but all over the world.\n\nMatana has appeared as a collaborator on recordings and performances in the U.S., Europe, and Canada with her own ensembles as well as with the collaborative jazz trio Sticks and Stones, Black Rock Coalition founder Greg Tate's Burnt Sugar, and Reg E Gaines and Savion Glover's homage project to the late great John Coltrane. Matana is an avid freelancer on a wide array of artistic projects, has played alongside some of the most intriguing creative sound visionaries of this time period.\n\nmatanaroberts.com\n\nMarina Rosenfeld\n\nturntables, sound\n\nNew York\n\nMarina Rosenfeld is an artist and composer based in New York City.

Rosenfeld continues to mount large-scale ensemble works scored for custom instrumentation (Emotional Orchestra, WHITE LINES), and performs frequently in the U.S., Canada and Europe as a turntablist spinning original dub plates. Shes performed with leading contemporary artists including Merce Cunningham Company, Sonic Youth, Christian Marclay, George Lewis and Ikue Mori, to name a few.

By chance then ,one day, he finds himself playing those same tools but in a different context..... he starts to intervene in a group of musician-friends (Popoli Dalpane Ensemble with a more classic direction..) as a satellite.....shifting the original concept towards a new planet... With this new approach they participate to different festivals hosting at times other musicians.... as Lindsay Cooper & Tony Coe. Another project was the AaltoSounDesign (Tiziano popoli, Roberto Monari & Massimo) which aimed to make parks & \"spaces\" alive with music. He starts also taking care & programming different radio programs on the independent \"Radio Citta103\" & \"Radio Citta del Capo\" in Bologna.which comprehended also an artistic overlook....they're called Umano Ovest & L'Ora d'Aria (the hour of air). He's invited by Gianni Gebbia to play on tour in a 'jazz trio' (they also release an album for Splach) & subsequently in duo, Bachstage, & in trio again with Tiziano Popoli in \"All'Improvviso\".

Duos are also done between Chris Cutler & Massimo. In 1991, in collaboration with Mario Zanzani, he invents Angelica (which is also a label), now is 17 years old. A festival which aim is to open, to search, to push & to find the unexpressed...what is in between & what is beyond....A jouney..... The first of this kind, in Italy, equally respected here as in the foreign in 2008 shall reach the 18th years. Massimo takes care of the artistic direction & the label. As a producer he realized different \"masters\" for foreign (New albion, Col legno, Rer Megacorp, Ipecac, Rai Trade Tracce) & italian labels (all the catalogues of i dischi di angelica) collaborating with Stefano Scodanibbio, Fred Frith, Phil Minton e Veryan Weston, Alvin Curran, Dr. Ilayaraaja, Eyvind Kang, Lawrence D. Butch Morris, Mike Patton.... Under suggestion of Angelica a workshop brings to life \"Eva Kant \"(an ensemble of more or less 30 elements), working with Butch Morris, Conduction 32 & 61 (Podewil-Berlin) & recorded \"Pacifica\" music by Fred Frith for Eva Kant (released on Tzadik). Currently he has different projects.... Bellezza Fiammeggiante: quintet of radical improvisation, highly energetic & inflammable (Eugenio Sanna, Edoardo Maraffa, Edoardo Ricci, Mirko Sabatini & Massimo); Ska Maria Pastora: an improvised juke-box with mixed singing & different windows to open... (Lullo Mosso, Vincenzo Vasi & Massimo); with Francesca Valente & Abi (Fabrizio Rota) instead they search , through improvisation, for a kind of music-massage with a consequent time release; with Riccardo Pittau a new form of song is explored; Antichi & Astronauti: a duo with Eugenio Sanna; a trio with Vincenzo Vasi & Mirko Sabatini... He works on his own & organizes workshops about \"domestic & invented\" instruments with musicians & non...(we remind you \"Rumore da Camera\" presented by The Popular School of Music Ivan Illich & Link). Invited by Marie Goyette he played in quartet which took place at the International Archipel Festival in Geneva with Maurizio Martusciello & Olivia Block & Marie. In a duo with Abi he works at a \"solo\" project as if he was a mirror...the image reflected is transformed....raga is contemplated & decontestualized.... With Tristan Honsinger (without his cello) & Pierre Bastien they improvise \"Theater\"... Shelley Hirsh appears as courtesy.... With Tristan he recorded a record live without audience (not yet released) that speaks about their indstuments (records and strings) and music, they sings songs and improvised texts: \"Call Me Us\" is the title, a karmic story. Mattino Marino: a project with Gayla Freed where he explores for the first time, live, the relation between music & image. The \"domestic\" taste of her images blends with a music still to find... With Fabrizio 'Abi' Rota, Massimo he realized what he calls 'concept-composition': \"Porzione di Cuore di Gabbiano in un Quadrilatero di Emozioni\", is the title. \"Evocazione\" its another work with the same working on the evocation of the composer, friend, died, Fernando Mencherini, we use prerecorded materials of him (records, tapes, samples) and we create an invisibile chamber orchestra. In the occasion of Angelica 2002, Massimo he is guest as mobile actor of the opera mobile by Tristan Honsinger Galleria San Francesco, ideated by Massimo e Tristan with text by Ermanno Cavazzoni. Massimo he relaized \"private for public\" with Vittorio Pettinella, Tiziano Popoli (...three friends speaking in italian about life, love, nothing.....something private...a pubblic english radio... ..a domestic atmosfere transmitted in others houses...a displaced language.....a domestic sound to find...) for Out of The Blue Radio Resonance FM. 104.4 FM of London for a series of radio programmes commissioned by Chris Cutler. With Vincenzo Vasi, Massimo he played in duo: \"Quasi Cocco\", in the concert series of Cocoricò of Riccione (a discoteque), and with Tiziano Popoli and with guest narrator Giampiero Cane (teacher of the Univeristy of Bologna). With Audrey Chen and Gianni Gebbia, and with Audrey Chen and Tiziano, Massimo did only 2 intense concerts. He also composed music for theatre & dance: the Reon Theater, the Valdoca Theater ( his music has been used by Virgilio Sieni).... Photography, the creation of objects, painting, drawing...often accompany his life images about light....\"domestic & naturalistic\" representation about time, as in absence.....without time..... In 2009 he shall conduct a workshop \"transparent ,time\" (interior time & other time, harmony & collision) for musicians & non which shall end in a concert. Massimo is now working on a new indstrument, a prepared theremin that he invented, with a software made to measure for Massimo realized by Bruno Zamborlin after a work of almost 2 years; the first time will be used live will be in Baltimora at High Zero Festival in september 2007.\n\nID M Theft Able\n\nmouth, frictions, textures, air, objects, vibrations, etc.\n\nPortland\n\ni did in know do what i did know in i bio do 1 o.i.n OING of did err dews i-saap do wonk bio-id i in did know of b.o.i OING do in i DID bio knews graphicals of DIDs on eons too dided then i bio'd of when n'DID th' done doing when i i i i knew of DID doings i DID i DID or i-saap not when if'd when i don't know of DID and DOESINGS that DONE for the does i\n\nkraag.org\n\nFrom Baltimore:"
