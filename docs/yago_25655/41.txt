Biography[]

Princess Bejaratana was born on 24 November 1925 in the Royal Grand Palace, Bangkok, the only child of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) and Princess Suvadhana. Having seen his daughter only one time, the king died the following day. Her uncle, who became King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), performed the naming ceremony for the princess on 30 December.

Princess Bejaratana and her mother moved to Suan Hongsa Villa in Dusit Palace, where she received her education from a private tutor. They moved in with Queen Sri Savarindira (the Queen Dowager) during World War II, and the princess attended Rajani School until she was 12. She and her mother then moved to England, where she continued her education and took medication for her poor health. She first stayed at Fairhill Villa in Surrey, before settling in Brighton.[6]

In November 1957, Princess Bejaratana returned to Thailand. She bought land on Sukhumvit Road Soi 38, and built Ruenruedi Villa Palace. The princess undertook her duties of representing the royal family. Her special interests were in education, public health, Buddhism, the soldiers and police guarding Thailand's borders, and general public welfare.

Near the end of her life she reduced her royal duties due to age, but occasionally still did work relating to her royal father.

Princess Bejaratana died on 27 July 2011 at 16:37 at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, aged 85.[7]
