She was a first cousin of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and third cousin of King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.[1][2]\n\nHer funeral was held on 9 April 2012, at Sanam Luang ceremonial ground in Bangkok.[3][4][5]\n\nBiography[]\n\nPrincess Bejaratana was born on 24 November 1925 in the Royal Grand Palace, Bangkok, the only child of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI) and Princess Suvadhana. Having seen his daughter only one time, the king died the following day. Her uncle, who became King Prajadhipok (Rama VII), performed the naming ceremony for the princess on 30 December.\n\nPrincess Bejaratana and her mother moved to Suan Hongsa Villa in Dusit Palace, where she received her education from a private tutor. They moved in with Queen Sri Savarindira (the Queen Dowager) during World War II, and the princess attended Rajani School until she was 12. She and her mother then moved to England, where she continued her education and took medication for her poor health. She first stayed at Fairhill Villa in Surrey, before settling in Brighton.[6]\n\nIn November 1957, Princess Bejaratana returned to Thailand. She bought land on Sukhumvit Road Soi 38, and built Ruenruedi Villa Palace. The princess undertook her duties of representing the royal family. Her special interests were in education, public health, Buddhism, the soldiers and police guarding Thailand's borders, and general public welfare.\n\nNear the end of her life she reduced her royal duties due to age, but occasionally still did work relating to her royal father.\n\nPrincess Bejaratana died on 27 July 2011 at 16:37 at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, aged 85.[7]\n\nTitles and styles[]\n\nStyles of\n\nPrincess Bejaratana of Thailand Reference style Her Royal Highness Spoken style Your Royal Highness Alternative style Ma'am\n\n30 December 1925 – 27 July 2011 : Her Royal Highness Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda.\n\nThe Princess's style and title in full: Her Royal Highness Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda Sirisobhabannavadi (Thai language: สมเด็จพระเจ้าภคินีเธอ เจ้าฟ้าเพชรรัตนราชสุดา สิริโสภาพัณณวดี; rtgs: Somdet Phrachao Phakhinithoe Chaofa Phetcharat Ratchasuda Sirisopha Phannawadi) The word \"Phakhini\" (Thai language: ภคินี) is meaning Cousin.[8]\n\nThai royal decorations[]\n\nKnight of The Most Illustrious Order of the Royal House of Chakri\n\nKnight Grand Cordon of The Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao\n\nKnight of the Ratana Varabhorn Order of Merit\n\nKnight Grand Cordon of The Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant\n\nKnight Grand Cordon of the Order of the Crown\n\nKnight Grand Cordon of the Order of the Direkgunabhorn\n\nThe Order of Symbolic Propitiousness Ramkeerati (Special Class) - Boy Scout Citation Medal\n\nKing Rama VI Royal Cypher Medal (First Class)\n\nKing Rama VII Royal Cypher Medal (First Class)\n\nKing Rama IX Royal Cypher Medal (First Class)\n\nThe Red Cross Commendation Medal\n\nMilitary rank[]\n\nGeneral, Admiral and Air Chief Marshal[9][10]\n\nAncestry[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
