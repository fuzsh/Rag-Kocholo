        "text": "Professor Luang Visal Silpakarm was born Chua Patamajinda on 2 February 1884 in Samut Prakarn, and was the grandson of Luang Prasitthi Artakarn, a Royal Arts and Crafts Master. He was married to Busarakam Tupvatana, and had 5 children. His eldest daughter, Samniang, married Vidya Bhiromhakdi, son of Praya Bhirom Bhakdi, the founder of the first brewery in Thailand. Luang Visal was probably the last great Thai Architect, and was bestowed the title of Luang for his contribution to traditional Thai architecture.\n\nHe was educated at the Tongsalangam Temple, and did some art studies. At 18, he was enrolled in the Department of Police, at a department that oversaw the Royal Grounds. During this time, he showed a keen interest in architecture and was involved in the building of the Merumas or Cremation Structure of Crown Prince Maha Vajirunhis."
