        "text": "The term lady-in-waiting refers to a female servant in a royal court. Some of these ladies manage to work their way up to gain a higher social status. Stories about these ladies sometimes reveal glimpses of palace life. But an even more interesting historical account can be sampled when these \"ladies\", along with the duties they perform, are replaced by men.\n\nChanan Yodhong's Naii Nai During the Reign Of King Rama VI stirred much interest two months ago during the National Book Fair. This audacious book is an extension of Chanan's masters' thesis on feminism at Thammasat University. The book has seen robust sales and stimulated much discussion, with Chanan appearing on television for an interview.\n\nNaii Nai explores the little-known all-male environment inside the court of King Vajiravudh and ponders the definition of \"masculinity\" and \"femininity\" as interpreted during the 15 years of the monarch's reign. Given its original purpose as a dissertation, the book is written in an unfussy academic style, supported by a large number of footnotes and references.\n\nHowever, Chanan's prose is accessible, engaging and his presentation of rare historical images and anecdotes is truly fascinating and eye-opening.\n\nUnlike most monarchs, King Vajiravudh married late. Chanan's book narrates how, throughout his reign, there was a shift in the inner circle of the palace that was once reserved for female servants.\n\nThe term naii nai is used by the writer for the king's male assistants. In Thai, \"lady-in-waiting\" is nang nai _ nang referring to \"woman\" and nai meaning \"inside\". Chanan replaced the word nang with naii, an honorific for men.\n\nSimply put, all the work that used to belong to nang nai, from preparing food to dressing the king, was taken over by male staff.\n\nChapter by chapter, the writer gradually sketches the lives of these naii nai, sometimes keeping a distance, sometimes probing closer, and all the while alluding to the complexity of gender issues through the eyes of a sociologist.\n\nAccording to the book, naii nai were among the people who spent the most time with the king and some of them were believed to be influential in court politics _ with the help of certain favourite naii nai, mandarins and politicians could gain access to the king.\n\nThe experimental democratic city of Dusit Thani _ much cited in Thai textbooks _ originated as a leisure activity between the king and his servants. The significant difference that the writer points out is that while ladies-in-waiting usually came from aristocratic families, naii nai could be commoners who had impressive qualities, either looks or talent.\n\nTrained in a military school, King Vajiravudh started a boy scout movement and the Wild Tiger Corps in Thailand, as well as the first all-male boarding school. All of these brought the idea of institutionalised masculinity to the public, where gentlemen must be physically fit and must value \"friendship\" and \"brotherhood\" above all things.\n\nWhile \"good men\" must be patriotic, the writer believes that the idea was taken from Victorian values where women must take care of the house and men must go out for adventures and protect the country. According to the book, naii nai needed the king 's permission if they wanted to marry a woman.\n\nKing Vajiravudh's passion for literature and theatre is widely known and it was also a duty of the naii nai to help him with performances and his writing.\n\nSince the palace was a men-only area, some of his assistants had to perform as female characters. Chanan's book reveals that while masculinity and gentlemanly etiquette was emphasised, dressing up as a woman was acceptable within the palace, which leaves room for further discussion about the history of gender and sexual identity in our society today."
