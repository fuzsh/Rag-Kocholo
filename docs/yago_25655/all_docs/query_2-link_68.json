        "text": "Abstract: In the traditional period (Before the reformation in King Rama V period), Thai women had less freedom. Before their marriage, they depended on their parents. When they married, they depended on their husbands.Their duty was to serve their family and took care of their houses. However common women had to pursue a career such as farmer, weaver, laborer and merchant which did not require any skill as they had no chance for education. In Modernization Period of Rattanakosin era, since the reign of King Mongkut (King Rama IV) up to the reign of King Vajiravudh (King Rama VI). The status of Thai women changed a lot . This increased expectations of the ability of Thai women. They should learn more about western culture and modified their daily life. Their status was wildly accepted in the society. Common women could go out and communicate with the outside world. For women outside Bangkok especially in Northern towns, they were in trading business. In Bangkok, women who were daughters of nobles and daughters of merchants, they had chance to study in missionary or government schools. When women became more educated, they became middle-class people. They had new career that matched society’s need such as teachers and nurses. However, the common women still continued in farming, dancing, weaving and theatre-acting. Christian Thai women learned sewing clothes from missionaries. This rendered them a new career which later developed to factory made cloth."
