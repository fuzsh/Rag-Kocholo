        "text": "Vajiravudh (January 1, 1880 – November 25, 1925) (also known as Rama VI, reigning title Phra Mongkut Klao Chaoyuhua; Thai-script พระบาทสมเด็จพระมงกุฎเกล้าเจ้าอยู่หัว) was King of Siam (now Thailand) from 1910 until his death. He succeeded his father, King Chulalongkorn. His mother was Queen Sripatcharinthara.\n\nWhen Vajiravudh was only 11 years old, he was sent to study at Sandhurst Military Academy, and then Christ Church College, University of Oxford, to study history and law. Unsurprisingly, therefore, Siam inherited a great deal of Anglo-Saxon culture. When Crown Prince Vajirunahit died, Vajiravudh succeeded him and was crowned as the 6th king of the Chakri dynasty on October 23 1910, after his father's death.\n\nKing Vajiravudh reigned during the transition from an old-fashioned to a modernized and prosperous Thailand. He continued the modernizations introduced by his father, whose great achievements were difficult to follow. At the end of the reign of Rama VI, Siam had many serious problems, many of which were setbacks resulting from modernization. Siam spent a lot of money on western technology, while receiving little from exporting its mostly agricultural products. When King Vajiravudh ascended to the throne, he was the only hope for the people of the famine and plague stricken country. However, some were disappointed to see that the new king could barely manage the tasks that were essential for the country.\n\nThis was most strikingly visible when a coup d'etat against him took place on November 11 1911, led by young soldiers. The plot was to seize the king and force him to peacefully abdicate, after which they would urge other princes to take his place as the first President of a Siamese republic. The coup failed, and all the accomplices were arrested. Those soldiers thought that the king had nothing to do but write plays and act in them himself with his favorites. They also accused the king of living a luxurious life in western style; building Sanam Charn castle and Lumphini park, and owning expensive horses from Australia, while preaching to his subjects to be austere and nationalistic. The most important factor in the coup was the king's introduction of senior scouts to the nobility and the soldiers. The accomplices thought that this disrupted the military order and secretly consolidated the monarchial power. Nonetheless, this coup became the inspiration for the revolution in 1932.\n\nKing Vajiravudh was one of Thailand's highly renowned artists, writing modern novels, short stories, plays and even journals. Among his works were translations of three Shakespeare plays - The Merchant of Venice, As You Like It and Romeo and Juliet and many other writing pieces to promote the ideology of Thai nationalism.\n\nOn 10 August 1924, King Vajiravudh married to Chao Chom Suwatana (Thai script: เจ้าจอมสุวัทนา). She was later appointed as Queen Suwattana (Thai script: พระนางเจ้าสุวัทนา พระวรราชเทวี) on 10 October 1925. King Vajiravudh has one daughter named Princess Phetcharattana (Thai script: สมเด็จพระเจ้าภคินีเธอ เจ้าฟ้าเพชรรัตนราชสุดา สิริโสภาพัณณวดี) who was born on 24 November 1925, one day before His Majesty's death. Thus his brother became the new king Rama VII.\n\nAmong King Vajiravudh's most notable accomplishments were the reform of the country's administration, the growth of public education, the surname system as used in western countries, and the modern flag. However his most notable contribution was the focus on Nationalism. King Vajiravudh could be praised as the father of Thai nationalism, which was later reproduced by Field Marshall Phibunsongkhram and Sarit Dhanarajata.\n\nIn addition, King Vajiravudh had believed that education was a crucial factor in the countrys modernization. Upon his accession to the throne, he founded Royal Pages School in 1910, instead of a Buddhist temple that had traditionally been practiced at the beginning of each reign. King Vajiravudh realized that there had already been enough temples in those days and high quality education for young men would be more essential for the future development of the country. The school was modelled on the traditional English public school, which the King had appreciated while he was spending his education in England. After his in 1925, the school was renamed Vajiravudh College in his honor. Today, the school carries its traditions and legacies as an all-boy boarding school. Besides, Vajiravudh also established Chulalongkorn University in 1917. The University, which was named in honour of his father, was the first western-style university in the country. These showed his great vision of the educational reform.\n\nVajiravudh was also the first king to see Thailand in a foreign war. Siam took place in World War I on the side of the Allied Powers. Though the Thai did not do much fighting, they were the only Southeast Asians in the war (except for 20,000 Vietnamese coolies drafted by their colonial French overlords).\n\nPreceded by:\n\nChulalongkorn\n\n(Rama V) the Great Kings of Thailand Succeeded by:\n\nPrajadhipok\n\n(Rama VII)\n\nde:Rama VI."
