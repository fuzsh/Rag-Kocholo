        "text": "In Message Tue, 7 Mar 1995 15:27:28 +0700,\n\nNorman Owen <NGO...@HKUCC.HKU.HK> writes:\n\n\n\nI think it is one of the worst kept secrets among Thai historians. But I\n\ndoubt if people outside the field or even new historians know this much. I\n\nthink it is a kind or norm, tradition, taboo (whatever you call), that we\n\nwon't discuss the issue publicly, hence no formal writing on it. This\n\nhints that homosexuality is not really \"accepted\" as some may romaticize\n\nabout Thailand. In English the fact was mentioned in passing in some works\n\nwhich don't deal with the issue. In Thai, the fact was hinted at in a few\n\nworks which deal with the King or his reign.\n\nIt must have been a common knowledge to his court at the time. There were\n\nfour attempts to marry him with princesses. All failed, though we can say\n\nthat the last one was officially succeeded. It is not clear if homosexuality\n\nin itself hurt the credibility of the king or his reign. The king faced many\n\noppositions because of his choices or preferences of his close associates\n\nand ministers, many of whom were incompetent. But only a few of them, who\n\nhappened to be among the most powerful couriters in his reign, were his male\n\npartners. Others could be the wrong choices he made like every other\n\nleaders could have done. The favors given to his partners were a subject of\n\ngossip criticism like favors given by any other leaders to their cronies,\n\nalthough in his case cronyism included his sexual partners. (Contrast with\n\nPrem who was said to be uncorrupted because he has no \"Madame Ten Percent\"\n\nwhich is rather an anti-women saying.) It looks like homosexuality in\n\nitself was not to blame.\n\nThis should not confirm the romanticised notion that Thailand does not\n\ndiscriminate against homosexuals. The Thais may treat homosexuality\n\ndifferently from the West. But don't jump to the conclusion that they are so\n\ntolerant just by comparing to the West.\n\nThongchai Winichakul, Assistant Professor\n\nDept. of History, Univ. of Wisconsin, 455 North Park St., Madison,\n\nWI 53706, Ph.(608) 263-8931 FAX: (608) 263-5302\n\ntwin...@facstaff.wisc.edu\n\nSomeone wrote:\n\n\n\nFirst, the list ought not be limited to \"news.\"\n\nSecond, I have seen no more gossip in this thread\n\nthan on others. Seems to me people are raising the\n\nissue of homosexuality in the upper levels of the\n\nThai government, how aware people in the broader Thai\n\npopulation are of this, and the impact it has on\n\npolitics, social issues, and so on.\n\nExcept in the really obvious cases where people like Wallace\n\nand Nyiri have been abusing the list as a place to unload\n\ntheir prejudices and nothing more, efforts to assume the\n\nrole of \"list police\" ought to be discouraged.\n\nJeffrey\n\nNorthwestern\n\n>Seems to me people are raising the\n\n>issue of homosexuality in the upper levels of the\n\n>Thai government, how aware people in the broader Thai\n\n>population are of this, and the impact it has on\n\n>politics, social issues, and so on.\n\n>\n\n>Except in the really obvious cases where people like Wallace\n\n>and Nyiri have been abusing the list as a place to unload\n\n>their prejudices and nothing more, efforts to assume the\n\n>role of \"list police\" ought to be discouraged.\n\n>Jeffrey\n\n>Northwestern\n\n>\n\nIn addition, there is the distinct possibility in this case of seeming to\n\ncensor material that might be construed as odious to the official state\n\nideology about the Thai monarchy. But this would border upon subjecting\n\nourselves to the Thai use of the charge of lese majeste. Now, where can one\n\ndiscuss things about the customs, politics and history of these countries\n\nwithout fear of being under pressure from the various restrictive state\n\nideologies of the region, except on this list? Since we must be acutely\n\naware of this latter problem, as South East Asianists, I suggest that we\n\ntread especially lightly with regard to restricting what the List allows us\n\nto argue about.\n\nF.
