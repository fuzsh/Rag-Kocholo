        "text": "After questioning the conventional distinction between traditional and modem theater in Asia, this essay suggests that it may be more fruitful to view today’s live theater traditions as part of a garden of theater culture that includes both native and imported elements and both deep-rooted and recently transplanted traditions. The remainder of the essay amplifies this perspective using examples from Thailand’s theater traditions during the last century and a half. This prepares the way to consider the strengths and weaknesses of traditional theater staged in Thailand during the last decade or so, whether centered on juxtaposing various artistic forms onstage or performing artistic reinterpretations of traditional stories. In seeking to strengthen these approaches for future performances, the author suggests the need for pooling the discipline and creativity performers have in order to fashion patterns of artistic expression that convey significance both among artists and to their au...\n\nQuite apart from urgencies arising within the theatre as an enterprise, it is independently necessary to bring the tools of speech act theory to bear on the theatre. This paper begins by redescribing the foundational moves of that theory in terms of drawing successive core-supplement boundaries – Austin’s first move demarcates a propositional core from a spoken-performative supplement; his second move, generalizing performativity over all speaking, demarcates a spoken (illocutionary) core from an active (perlocutionary) supplement. A third move, proposed here, extends this strategy of expanding the core in a performative direction. So extended, the central theoretical concern of speech act theory converges with what one major tradition articulates, both practically and conceptually, as the way forward for theatrical performance. That tradition – which has travelled from Stanislavski’s Russia, via Grotowski’s Poland, to Badal Sircar’s India – is in the business of giving democracy theatrical teeth. While Sircar does not explicitly claim a classical Indian ancestry for his work, serious Indology will find it easy to place him in that context.\n\nRepresentations of Thailand in western films have received little attention by film scholars, notable exceptions being widely popular films such as \"Anna and the King of Siam\" (USA 1946), \"The King and I\" (USA 1956), and \"The Beach\" (USA & UK 2000). This gap in research is astonishing, given the fact that the first western films made in Thailand date back to the emergence of the travelogue film genre in the 1910s. Travelogues are documentary-style scenic films engaging with cultures and peoples around the globe. During the silent film period (1895-1927), western films depicting Siam were almost exclusively travelogues. They sought to entertain and ‘educate’ western audiences about this ostensibly ‘exotic’ Asian nation. The 1930s marked the first decade of the sound film period and coincided with the beginning of Hollywood’s Golden Era, when travelogues became more sophisticated and voiceover narration took on a central role. This paper seeks to make an original contribution to the study of western visual representations of Siam in the 1930s. To this end, its objects of interest are western films made in Siam during that decade. The paper focuses on two travelogues in particular: \"Siam to Korea\" (USA 1931) and \"Serene Siam\" (USA 1937). Both films were made by James A. FitzPatrick, aka ‘The Voice of the Globe’. The paper discusses and contextualizes these two films’ representations of Bangkok, Siamese society and culture, focusing especially on their chosen subjects and FitzPatrick’s guiding voiceover commentaries."
