But following the abdication of King Rama VII, it was decided that the Princess, nine years old at that time, should continue her studies overseas.\n\nThe Princess returned to Thailand in 1959 when she was 34 and she had since then devoted her time to projects initiated by her father.\n\nShe had also worked closely with Chulalongkorn University, Silpakorn University, Vajiravudh College, Vajira Hospital and the Sanam Chan Palace Restoration Project.\n\nThe Princess had devoted her time to projects initiated by her grandmother as well, including Rajini School and the Thai Red Cross Society.\n\nA royal bathing rite for the late Princess was set at the Piman Rathaya Throne Hall in the Thai capital later today and the royal urn will then be installed in the Dusit Maha Prasart Throne Hall, to be given the highest honours according to the wishes of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej.\n\nThe public are allowed to pay their respects to the late Princess at Sala Sahathai Samakhom inside the Grand Palace from 1pm and 4pm today and members of the Royal Thai Family, the Royal Court and the public will observe a 100-day mourning period. – Bernama"
