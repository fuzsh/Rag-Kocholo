        "text": "Minister King to the Secretary of State.\n\nSir: In view of the disturbed conditions in China and the recent unfortunate incident at Lien Chow, I have thought the following would be of interest to the department.\n\nHis Royal Highness Prince Maha Vajiravudh, the Crown Prince of Siam, has just returned from an extended trip of three months’ duration throughout the entire northern portion of Siam. He stopped a few days at Chiengmai, the principal city of the north, and the center of the disturbed district at the time of the insurrection in 1902. Here he gave a considerable portion of his time to a careful and interested inspection of the American Presbyterian Mission and its work, kindly consented to lay the corner stone of their new school building, and on his departure gave a name to the new school. I inclose a translation of the address made by His Royal Highness at the laying of the corner stone and a copy of the English note which was handed to Mr. Harris, the head master of the institution, on the evening before the prince left Chiengmai.\n\nThe prince very graciously gave permission to use this address and note if the friends of the work so desired.\n\nI have, etc.,\n\n[Inclosure—Translation.]\n\nAddress of Grown Prince Maha Vajiravudh.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen: I have listened with great pleasure to the complimentary remarks which have just been made. I regard them as a clear and indisputable evidence of your friendship for the Kingdom of Siam. While on my visit to the United States the American people were pleased to give me a most enthusiastic welcome. I may mention particularly the sumptuous banquet with which your board of foreign missions honored me. I then clearly perceived that the American people received me whole heartedly and not perfunctorily. This also made it evident to me that the American people have sincere friendship for the Kingdom of Siam. Of this fact I was profoundly convinced, and I certainly shall not soon forget my visit to the United States.\n\nThis being so, I feel impelled to reciprocate this kindness to the full extent of my ability. As my royal grandfather and my royal father have befriended the Christian missionaries, so I trust that I, too, shall have the opportunity on proper occasions to assist them to the limit of my power.\n\nYour invitation to me to lay the corner stone of your new school building on this occasion is another evidence of your friendship and good will toward Siam. I have full confidence that you will make every endeavor to teach the students to use their knowledge for the welfare of their country. Therefore, I take great pleasure in complying with your request, and I invoke a rich blessing on this new institution. May it prosper and may it fulfill the highest expectations of its founders.\n\n[Page 1340]\n\n[Inclosure 2.]\n\nNote of the Crown Prince.\n\nI have great pleasure in naming the new school, the foundation stone of which I have just laid, as follows: “The Prince Royal’s College.” May this school, which I have so named, be prosperous and realize all that its wellwishers hope for. May it long flourish and remain a worthy monument of the American Presbyterian Mission of Chiengmai. This is the wish of their sincere friend.\n\nVajiravudh."
