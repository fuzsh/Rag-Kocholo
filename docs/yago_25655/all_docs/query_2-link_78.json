        "text": "It has been widely acknowledged that translation played an important role in the process of colonization. Colonizers often used it to reinforce their hegemony over the colonized who, in turn, employed it to encourage either submission to or resistance of that hegemony. Focusing on Vajiravudh’s translation, or more precisely adaptation, of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” this article illustrates how the story reflects not only the desire to be civilized like Westerners but also the strategies that the Siamese elite employed in order to achieve the trappings of civilization, namely the construction of a primitive Other and the imitation of Europeans. These strategies were, however, inherently problematic. Imitation did not, for example, pave the way towards acceptance but reinforced instead the stereotype of the mimicking natives. The article shows, however, that the Siamese elite were able to use the tactic of adaptation, both literary and otherwise, to navigate th...\n\nIn 1941, in the midst of a small boom in the publishing of detective novels, a series of short detective novels were published in the south-central Javanese town of Yogyakarta. These novels were not published in a vacuum, but rather in the social, economic and political context of the final year before World War II. This paper examines the fifth of this series of long-forgotten detective novels featuring a Javanese detective, Raden Soebroto, and a mysterious villain, Patjar Koening, presenting the context of publication and an examination of the novel in the context of political scandals of the day. This examination demonstrates that the novel was clearly shaped in part by the legal risks facing the author and publisher, particularly where there is explicit discussion of contemporary people and events. Finally, this article briefly considers the fate of the Indonesian detective novel in periods of high political tension like the Japanese occupation or the revolutionary period which immediately followed this novel’s publication.\n\nAs the generic nomenclature suggests, detection of the criminal constitutes the chief narrative interest in a detective fiction. In Saradindu Bandyopadhyay's detective stories that palpably bear the impress of the classical detective fiction, crime and criminal are treated as an infection in the society that needs the healing touch of the private detective, Byomkesh Bakshi, for restoration of status quo. Prevention and investigation of crime and protection of the innocent are the official assignment of a law enforcing authority. The private investigator and an investigating police officer operate in the same direction, though their methodology, commitment and competency level differ significantly, prompting thereby a mutuality of clash and coalescence in their relationship. The present paper invokes the spirit of postcolonial criticism that encourages ambivalent mechanism in any decolonization agenda, to study the political import of police-private detective interaction in select detective stories of Saradindu Bandyopadhyay.\n\nThis article explores Erik Seidenfaden's life and scholarly career in Thailand. Seidenfaden arrived in the country in 1906 to take up a position as officer in the provincial gendarmerie and resided there until he returned to Denmark in 1946. During his forty years' residence, Seidenfaden became an influential amateur scholar in the fields of ethnography and archaeology. He was an active member of the Siam Society, a prolific contributor to the JSS and, for a short period, the Society's president. The aim of this article is to present a broader assessment of Seidenfaden and his scholarly work. In doing so, we will present new knowledge on his life history and how he refashioned himself as an amateur scholar, and contributed to turning Siam into a knowable object.\n\nThis article explores Erik Seidenfaden's life and scholarly career in Thailand.

The ‘feminization’ of masculine orders through the feminine every day, makes these films significant despite the fact they are mostly chamber dramas, and trade with middle-class concerns."
