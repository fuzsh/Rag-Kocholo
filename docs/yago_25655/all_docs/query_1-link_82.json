CHANAT KAYANYU\n\nBy Terry Fredrickson\n\nThe funeral proceedings to bid farewell to HRH Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda have begun with thousands taking part.\n\nPlease join us on our facebook page: http://www.facebook.com/bangkokpostlearning\n\nClick button to listen to Royal funeral and rightclick to download\n\nNation bids farewell to princess\n\nUsnisa Sukhsvasti\n\nThailand bids farewell to HRH Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda today, with three processions to escort her royal urn from Dusit Maha Prasart Throne Hall to the cremation pyre at Sanam Luang.\n\nA cast of thousands in full uniform will be in formation along the surrounding streets as Princess Bejaratana makes her final journey.\n\nThe princess passed away from septicemia on July 27, 2011, aged 85.\n\nThe royal cremation site of Her Royal Highness Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda glitters ahead of the ceremonial cremation, which will be presided over by Their Majesties the King and the Queen at 4.30pm today. PATIPAT JANTHONG\n\nThe day will begin at 7am when the royal urn is carried from Dusit Maha Prasart Hall atop the royal golden palanquin to an area in front of Wat Phra Chetupon, or Wat Pho.\n\nThere, the urn will be transferred to the Phra Maha Pichai Ratcharot, or royal chariot, for the one-and-a-half-hour procession to Sanam Luang.\n\nThe chariot was built from gilded teak wood during the reign of King Rama I, and was used for the funeral of Her Royal Highness The Princess Mother and Her Royal Highness Princess Galyani Vadhana. It weighs around 13 tonnes and requires 216 men to pull.\n\nThe chariot will set off along Sanam Chai Road towards Ratchadamnoen Avenue.\n\nWhen it arrives at Sanam Luang, the urn will be returned to the palanquin for the third and final procession.\n\nThe palanquin will circumnavigate the phra meru, or royal funeral pyre, three times, with each lap covering 260 metres, before the urn is placed on the pyre.\n\nMembers of the public wishing to pay their respects may leave paper and sandalwood flowers for the cremation at 4pm at five points around Sanam Luang and at 46 temples in Bangkok.\n\nA daytime view of the cremation site. APICHART JINAKUL\n\nThe ceremonial cremation will go ahead at 4:30pm, followed by the more private official cremation at 10pm and a programme of cultural events for the public through the night.\n\nThe funeral is the culmination of about eight months of work by the Fine Arts Department and Religious Affairs Department, which allocated a budget of 218.1 million baht for the preparations and ceremony.\n\nPrincess Bejaratana was the only child of King Vajiravudh, Rama VI, and Phra Nang Chao (Queen) Suvadhana.\n\nHer royal father, seriously ill at the time, passed away just one day after the princess was born, and it was her grandmother, Queen Savang Vadhana, who took the baby princess under her wing.\n\nThe princess spent much of her formative years in the United Kingdom after the 1932 revolution which toppled the absolute monarchy and led to the abdication of her uncle, King Prajadhipok. By the time she returned to Thailand in 1959, her cousin, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, was on the throne.\n\nShe spent the rest of her life at Ruenrudi Villa, working on behalf of various charitable organisations and projects that were established and initiated by her royal father as well as her grandmother, Queen Savang Vadhana, with her mother constantly by her side.\n\nYou can read the full and much longer story here: http://bit.ly/HqJKRC\n\nYou can read previous article at www.bangkokpost.com/learning/all-article ."
