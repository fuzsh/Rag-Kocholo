Given his long-held view that the country should have retained its name as Siam, he has brought an exceptional perspective to how Thailand approached the idea of modern nationhood—both before and after the age of imperialism. The name change that followed the military coup of 1932 and the end of the historic monarchy had created greater insecurity in a region that was about to be transformed. The uncertainty was compounded by Japanese ambition and the outbreak of the European War that became worldwide. This was followed after the war by a total change in the regional environment when the imperialist powers retreated and new nations gained their independence. Siam had the difficult experience of remaining sovereign and independent during the nineteenth century when its neighbours were being invaded. The wisdom of its rulers and the skills of its diplomats were the envy of all those who were colonized. Having survived multiple threats with exceptional success, those who were set to build a new kind of nation in 1945 would have assumed that Thailand was free from that particular burden. Indeed, many post-war studies made the process of Thai nationhood appear to be a seamless development that required no special attention. They therefore concentrated on economic, diplomatic and security affairs that enabled the country to play important roles in the region’s fresh start as new polities.\n\nix\n\n22-J08326 00 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 9\n\n12/4/22 8:51 AM\n\nx • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nIt needed someone with Charnvit’s historical sensitivity to go behind the country’s confident front to discover other dimensions to the special kind of nationhood that the various peoples of Thailand sought to establish. His focus on the long reigns of the royal house as determinants in the country’s political architecture is original and illuminating. It does not only emphasize a unique phenomenon but also throws light on how the kings could find the space to strengthen their position under some extremely unstable conditions. As a historian, he is not satisfied simply to have found an instructive angle from which to explore the mysteries in a modern experimental monarchy. His keen sense of time has filled his narrative with insights that only few people could have identified. To me, that is a mark of one with a fine sense of what the past can mean. I thank him for the chance to see this mature and thoughtful Charnvit at work and commend this book to everyone who wants to understand Thailand better. I would also like to say why the nation of Thailand has a special significance here. It was at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok at the 14th International Historians of Asia (IAHA) Conference that I first suggested that it was time for historians to write the history of nation-building in Southeast Asia. I was speaking on the history of nationalism in Southeast Asia and complained that the study of the difficult task of building nation had been largely in the hands of political scientists. I felt that, while that task was still work in progress, there had been enough done over the past fifty years for historians to examine what has been achieved so far. On my return to Singapore, I asked Chan Heng Chee, then Director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, for her support to plan a modest Nation-Building Series to produce histories of the five original members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. She was most encouraging and provided funding for me to invite outstanding historians of the five countries to meet about the project. Her successors also gave me their warm support. I chose five established historians whose work I knew and who each had lived through the nation-building process in their respective\n\n22-J08326 00 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 10\n\n12/4/22 8:51 AM\n\nForeword • xi\n\ncountries. I gave an account of this in my introduction to the first volume published, that on Malaysia by Cheah Boon Kheng.1 When the historians agreed to join the project, ISEAS invited them to spend time there together and use its extensive library. After a few meetings, we were convinced that each country had a very different story to tell. Each one was building its post-war modern nation under exceptional political conditions that were largely shaped by its distinctive demographic, social and cultural components. As we examined these differences, we were made all the more conscious of the need to identify and explain the backgrounds of each country. We realized that this was a necessary corrective to social science approaches that tend to look for generalities. We concluded that we should not seek to find a common framework for the five volumes but should let the country differences dictate the way each volume should be presented. We also held a workshop attended by other colleagues who were experts in the history of each of the countries. They were asked, after discussing the project with the five authors, to set down their views in a volume of essays, entitled Nation-building: Five Southeast Asian Nations. That way, they could each make a contribution to the project while the five books were being planned. As it happened, Craig Reynolds was the one who drew attention to the ideas of nation and state that applied to Thailand and it is fitting that Charnvit has asked him to provide a Prologue to this volume. It is a gesture of deep friendship and understanding on their parts, something I truly appreciate.

Reynolds\n\nCharnvit Kasetsiri was born in 1941, the eldest of seven siblings, in Ban Pong on the Maeklong River just outside of Bangkok. Having written numerous history books and articles in Thai and English, he has been a prolific author since his first book in English, The Rise of Ayutthaya: A History of Siam in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries (1976). Through the Social Sciences and Humanities Textbooks Foundation over which he presides, he has fostered the publication of countless works in Thai, many translated from English and other languages. He has passionately advocated the study of Southeast Asia and its languages. His collaborative networking across the region through the Southeast Asia Regional Exchange Program as well as his scholarly accomplishments earned him in 2014 the Distinguished Contributions to Asian Studies Award given by the Association for Asian Studies. In 2012 he won the prestigious Fukuoka Academic Prize for outstanding achievements in the field of Asian Studies. Charnvit taught history for many years at Thammasat University, founded in 1934 by Pridi Banomyong, one of the architects of the 1932 coup that overthrew the absolute monarchy, and Charnvit has been a tireless campaigner for the integrity of this second-oldest Thai university and for the reputation of Pridi Banomyong who was wronged more than once in the course of Thailand’s fractious politics. A Pridi partisan and inveterate international traveller to overseas conferences who has sometimes gone abroad temporarily for strategic reasons, Charnvit does not board a plane without a liberal supply of brochures, pamphlets and T-shirts that xiii\n\n22-J08326 00 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 13\n\n12/4/22 8:51 AM\n\nxiv • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nadvertise new publications by the Textbook Foundations or promote his latest enthusiasms—“Change Thailand to Siam!”, “Democracy Walk for Thammasat, Tha Prachan Campus, and Communities on Rattanakosin Island!”. On Facebook, Charnvit has supported student protesters in their demands to reform the monarchy. In recent years Charnvit’s team has been organizing historical tours. Its lead guide is able to speak at length on all topics relevant to what the tourists are about to see as they alight from their buses to visit shrines and temples, ancient monuments and public sculptures. A colleague once referred to Charnvit as the Great Disseminator. He has the capacity to turn everything he sees, hears and touches into observations about the past in the present. He cannot help himself. I mention these details as background to alert the reader about what follows in Charnvit’s contemporary history of Thailand’s struggle for the nation: expect the unexpected. What transpires in the following pages is not a straightforward account of how this struggle has evolved into the polarized divisions that have paralysed the country for the past two decades. Instead, we find a non-linear narrative that testifies to the dominance of the Thai monarchy, the pole star, “the centre of the universe for everyone’s well-being,” as one senior Thai historian has put it.1 Rather than proceeding chronologically from the reform-minded fifth monarch of the dynasty, Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910) through the 1932 event, the decline of the institution after the abdication of the seventh monarch in 1935, and the rehabilitation of the institution under King Bhumibol (r. 1946–2016), Charnvit toggles back and forth between the two longest reigns in Thai history. The structure of the book takes this form to highlight the parallels, the similarities and the differences between what happened when powerful and forward-thinking kings passed from the scene and were succeeded by figures born to reign and rule but who were less able to govern their realms. For those in academic and activist circles familiar with Charnvit’s enthusiasms and causes, his treatment of twentieth- and twenty-firstcentury history may be surprising. Social movements are not a focus of the\n\n22-J08326 00 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 14\n\n12/4/22 8:51 AM\n\nPrologue • xv\n\nbook; this is not history from below. Nationalism is guided nationalism, the product of elite policies, not the expression of the people’s will. At a time when young protestors are being imprisoned for violating the lèse majesté law, a statute that criminalizes defamation of the Supreme Institution, it may seem unfashionable to put forward an argument that elite and particularly royal talent, accomplishment and energy have been so beneficial to the kingdom. The second half of the nineteenth century was the watershed period when the Thai ruling elite was forced to respond to the new world of Western imperialism dominated by farang, a Thai loan word for white people. Westerners in Bangkok asked questions of Siamese officials about origins of the Thai, and responses to these questions as well as the technology of printing and cartography gradually transformed the Thai world from religious and dynastic to national as Western models of nationhood took hold in the minds of the elite. King Vajiravudh (r. 1910–25), who was not nearly so interested in governing as his father, articulated in his plays and other writings some of the elite responses to origins and race that have endured in Thai public discourse to the present day. Vajiravudh’s eight years in England epitomizes what had become a hallmark of elite practice: Western education and training. From the middle of the nineteenth century until after the Second World War the world outside Siam was Europe where the first generation of Thais went for their education. Chulalongkorn’s travels abroad took him at first to Dutch and British colonies, but in later decades he travelled to Europe where he endeavoured to demonstrate to his hosts in imperial capitals that his ancient kingdom and nascent nation could be as modern as any other. Charnvit describes him as “diminutive and dapper” and through his intuitive grasp of how film and photography could project an international image, as “media-savvy”. The social and administrative reforms engineered by Chulalongkorn were as much about lifting Siam’s international image in the eyes of Europe as they were about addressing inequities and injustices, although prostration as a sign of subjugation and oppression was a priority reform early in the reign. Left unsaid in Charnvit’s account is whether or\n\n22-J08326 00 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 15\n\n12/4/22 8:51 AM\n\nxvi • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nnot prostration was completely abandoned; it returned with a flourish for royal personages in the second half of the twentieth century during the reign of King Bhumibol.2 Well into the twentieth century Europe remained the source of the modern. King Bhumibol’s father, Mahidol Adulyadej, Prince of Songkhla, went to America for his medical education where he met and married Sangwan Talapat, a commoner. At that time the United States was an unusual destination for Thais to study abroad. Mahidol died in 1929 leaving Sangwan Talapat to raise their daughter, Galyani Vadhana (b. 1923), and two sons, Ananda (b. 1925) and Bhumibol (b. 1927), the elder of whom had become king in 1935 when King Prajadhipok abdicated. The children were brought up in Switzerland until the end of the war when the family was flown back to Bangkok by the British. Following the mysterious death of Ananda in June 1946, Bhumibol acceded to the throne. By that time the United States, which replaced the French, Dutch and British colonial powers to become the paramount power in the region, had declared itself an ardent foe of the communist-inspired nationalisms in Asia. Thailand found itself in a world divided into “two halves of the same walnut” and was quickly enlisted as an American ally in the Cold War. Many elite children still went to Europe for their education, but middle-class children, hundreds of them, went to the United States courtesy of American funding. Coups and prime ministers come and go in this history, much of which will be familiar to those knowledgeable about the country’s turbulent politics. The longest reign in Thai history from 1946 to 2016 provides a semblance of stability that is both spiritual and political thanks to King Bhumibol’s popularity. The military is a constant presence. When the army took over in the late 1930s and changed the name of the country from Siam to Thailand, new lyrics in the national anthem infused Thai identity topdown with race and sacrifice. In 1952 the military government presented King Bhumibol with his own radio station. The king was both announcer and disc jockey and in the daily broadcasts played classical music as well as his own compositions. From 1950 until 1997 he personally attended\n\n22-J08326 00 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 16\n\n12/4/22 8:51 AM\n\nPrologue • xvii\n\ngraduations and awarded degrees to 470,000 students, thus creating a personal rapport between the exalted figure of the monarch and young Thai people who would remember forever the moment they received their degrees from the king’s hand. Charnvit’s history throws up all kinds of surprises. An unfamiliar detail about Sino-Thai heritage, so important in commerce, custom, religion, and popular culture, is tucked away in a footnote. After the death of the Princess Mother in 1995 her eldest child, Princess Galyani, and her granddaughter, Princess Sirindhorn, wore mourning clothes of sack and raw cotton in a performance of Kong Tek, the Chinese mourning rite. General Surayud Chulanont was prime minister from 2006 to 2008 after the 2006 coup against an elected caretaker government. Who could imagine that General Surayud’s father, Lieutenant Colonel Payom Chulanont, had joined the Communist Party of Thailand in the late 1950s and rose in the ranks of the People’s Liberation Army? The twists and turns in Thailand’s history can be dizzying. Charnvit’s birth town Ban Pong, once a busy hub of commerce, was on a river route to the west and south. As I turned the pages of Charnvit’s history of Thailand’s struggle for the nation I wondered if his forebears in Ban Pong during King Chulalongkorn’s time had come out to see the king’s vessel pass by on the Maeklong River, or later in the early 1900s when the railroad was finished to see the royal rail carriage stop briefly on its journey. With his siblings Charnvit has written lovingly of his upbringing in Ban Pong and Paknam. The two memoirs, dense with details and photographs of family life, include an episode during the Japanese Occupation in 1944–45 when the Japanese used Ban Pong as a base in their construction of the Death Railway in Kanchanaburi.3 In 1990 the History Association and the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy organized an academic conference on “Language and History” at the academy’s new campus in Nakorn Nayok where the academy had recently moved. Princess Sirindhorn, known popularly as Phra Thep and patron of the History Association who has given history lectures at the Academy, was in attendance. The most academic of King Bhumibol’s four\n\n22-J08326 00 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 17\n\n12/4/22 8:51 AM\n\nxviii • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nchildren, she presented a conference paper on an episode at the end of the Second World War when some ten thousand Japanese soldiers were stationed in the area as they were about to be repatriated to Japan. In the dining room Princess Sirindhorn sat with senior military officers and seemed quite at ease in their company. At lunch one day the kitchen staff prepared moji, a chewy red bean desert dusted with coconut, inspired by a Japanese sweet that had made its way into Thai cuisine during the Japanese period. In conversation with conference delegates Charnvit observed that Thailand must be the only country in the world where a princess, patron of an academic association, shared a meal with military officers and the army cooks would serve a Japanese desert reminiscent of the Occupation. Charnvit is always ready with a quip that can turn an otherwise insignificant detail into a historical observation. His good nature notwithstanding, Charnvit makes clear in the final pages that he is not very sanguine about the country’s future. During Thailand’s democratic spring in 1974 the Thai constitution was changed to allow female succession. This apparent loosening of male prerogative had no effect on the reign change in 2016 when the designated male heir, Prince Vajiralongkorn, succeeded without challenge to become the tenth Bangkok king. Communism, long gone as the spectre that once haunted Thailand’s political order, has been replaced by another. The spectre now haunting Thailand is authoritarianism. NOTES 1.

Indeed, one might say that they co-produce each other as the principal mode of belonging in the twentieth century. Individuals learn to identify with nation-states that have supposedly evolved over a long history to reach the self-conscious unity of the two and are thus poised to acquire mastery over the future.1 Prasenjit Duara, 1998\n\nIntroduction: The Dynastic History of Siam2 Few instruments of power are as vital for the modern Thai state as the idea of a bounded nation-state and its corresponding history. To understand nationalism and nation-building in modern Siam, it is therefore crucial to look at how present-day national Thai History was achieved. The official history of Thailand is taught in schools and colleges as a ceaseless forward march of the nation, beginning in ancient times when the Thai people lived in China. The golden age of the mighty Kingdom of Nan Chao (Nanzhao) which they had established in Yunnan, was followed by a mighty fall and swift resurrection. Driven out by the Mongols, the Thais entered mainland Southeast Asia. By the thirteenth century, they had established their first kingdom after freeing themselves from the yoke of the Khmer of Angkor. The Kingdom of Sukhothai was ruled by the benevolent hero-kings Si Intrathit (?1240s–?1270s) and Ramkhamhaeng (?1279–1298), who brought the Thais another golden age. 1\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 1\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n2 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nIn 1351, the second kingdom was founded by King Uthong in the city of Ayutthaya. It remained the main centre of the Thais for more than 400 years, governed by another set of hero-kings (aided by very few women) such as Naresuan (1590–1605) and Narai (1656–88), until, in 1767, Ayutthaya was defeated and sacked by the Burmese. The Thais successfully fought back. After the defeat of the eternal enemy from the West came the last and present Kingdom of Rattanakosin/Bangkok with ten great King Ramas of the Chakri Dynasty.3 Siam preserved her independence and became modern during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910) who was followed, two generations later, by another great modernizer who steered Thailand through a troublesome time of change, King Bhumibol Adulyadej (1927–2016). Following this national history of Siam, the story of Siam’s geo-body, as Thongchai Winichakul’s Siam Mapped (1994) deemed it, would appear neatly woven, linear, progressive, and easily traced back through lines of kings, dynasties and kingdoms.4 Yet, the objective historian recognizes this line of interpretation and presentation as obviously modern and, more importantly, imagined and created. A close look at how the Thai ruling elite has come to view its past in this manner is revealing. An article written by King Mongkut in the mid-nineteenth century highlights the artificial construction of the history of Siam. It was published in 1851 in Canton, China. That year, Rama III (Nangklao), a half-brother of Mongkut, passed away after reigning for twenty-seven years (1824–51). For all those years, Mongkut had been forced to wear an orange robe as a Buddhist monk. After the death of his half-brother, he immediately disrobed and left his temple, Wat Bowonniwet in Bang Lamphu, to become king. The new ruler’s statement was in English, and it is worth quoting in full: I am just availing myself of an opportunity for searching into some pages of Siamese ancient history, and beg to state that our ancient capital Ayuthia before the year AD 1350, was but the ruin of an ancient place belonging to Kambuja (now known as Cambodia), formerly called\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 2\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 3\n\nLawek … There were other cities not far remote, also possessed by the Kambujans … Sometime near the year AD 1300, the former inhabitants were much diminished by frequent wars with the northern Siamese and the Peguans, or Mons, so that these cities were vacated … and nothing remained but their names. Former inhabitants declared that the people of Chiang-rai, a province of what is now called Chiang-mai (North Laos), and Kampengpet, being frequently subjected to great annoyance from their enemies, deserted their native country and formed a new establishment at Ch’a-liang in the western part of Siam Proper; and built a city which they called Thephamaha-na-khon, whence has been preserved, in the national records, as the name of our capital down to the present day, Krung-Thepha-maha-nakhon … and there five kings of the first dynasty reigned, until the sixth, named U-T’ong Rama-thi-bodi ascended the throne in 1314. This king, it is said, was the son-in-law of his predecessor, who was named Sirichai Chiang Sen, who was without male issue, and therefore the throne descended to the son-in-law by right of the royal daughter. U-T’ong Rama-thi-bodi was a mightier prince than any of his predecessors, and subsequently conquered and subjected to his sway all Southern Siam, and some provinces in the Malayan Peninsula. He made Ch’a-liang the seat of his government for six years, and then in consequence of the prevalence of disease of a pestilential character, he caused various researches to be made for some more healthy location, and finally fixed upon the site of Ayuthia, and there founded his new capital in April 1350. This date is an ascertained fact. From this period, our Siamese annals are more exact, and the accounts generally reliable—being accompanied by dates and days, months, and years from 1350 to 1767.5\n\nIt is very clear from King Mongkut’s account that the history of his kingdom did not go back very far into the past. The time was around 1300 and the space was mostly around Ayutthaya or present-day central Thailand; such space was very much more connected with the Angkorian Khmer than with the Chinese.6 There was no mention of the Thais in China, nor of Sukhothai and the great King Ramkhamhaeng, both of which were central to later versions of “national” history. Of course, the cities of Chaliang, Chiang Saen, and\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 3\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n4 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nChiang Mai further north were mentioned, but only to establish the dynastic line of King Uthong, the founder of Ayutthaya; and this line went back only five generations. Even as late as 1904, towards the end of the reign of King Chulalongkorn (1868–1910) who is credited with reforming and modernizing Siam, its history did not much differ from that of King Mongkut. That year, the sizeable volume The Kingdom of Siam (1904) was prepared by the Siamese Ministry of Agriculture for distribution at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri. The commission overseeing the volume included Prince Vajiravudh, the future King Rama VI, who had just returned from England by way of America and Japan in early 1903; Prince Devawongse (1858–1923), the minister of foreign affairs; Prince Mahisra (1866–1907), the minister of finance; and Chao Phya Devesra, the minister of agriculture. It is safe to assume that such a book had royal and governmental approval to present the nation’s history to a readership at a prominent international event. In Chapter 5 on “Siam from an Historical Standpoint”, the volume states: Little is known about the early history of the country, which was first called Siam by the Portuguese and, following them, by the other nations who first came into contact with it … Siemlo, the Chinese name, is of equally doubtful etymology, and by the neighboring countries, such as Burmah and Cambodia, the country was called, after the name of its former capital, Sri Ayuddhya … The Siamese call themselves Thai, probably the equivalent of Franks, the free ones, i.e., free from the foreign (Cambodian) yoke… The chief source of the earliest history is found in the Phongsawadan Muang Nua (The Annals of the North) … Besides these Annals … there are local annals, some written in Pali, some in Siamese or Laosian, which also throw a certain light on pre-Buddhistic times… In the earliest times, before the capital was established at Ayuthia in 1350, there extended throughout the country a number of small principalities. These extended over what is now called Siam, from the borders of China east and west through the valleys of the Menam Chow\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 4\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 5\n\nPhya and the Menamkong and down the Malay Peninsula, with Ligor as capital, as far south as Malacca … The early history of the race shows a continual migration from the north to the south, seeking an outlet to the sea … until in 1350 the branch of the Tai race known now as Siamese established their capital at Ayuthia … The history of the Siamese as a dominant power begins from this date … From the founding of the capital at Ayuthia in 1350 down to its destruction in 1767 by the Burmese …7\n\nAs may be seen from the above, again the time was 1350, and the space was Ayutthaya. However, since the two sources were written in English, it may be that they were meant for foreign consumption only, reflecting what the Thai elite wanted to present to the outside world, especially to the farang, and those who mattered and read or spoke English. A look at the presentation of history intended for local consumption gives a clearer picture of actual historical knowledge and construction at that time. In 1887, King Chulalongkorn commissioned an important project of ninety-two modern large-format oil paintings, illustrating scenes chosen from among those believed to be core events of the past. Each was to be accompanied by poems describing the historical episode. They were elaborately framed in gold in a modern Western style. The paintings were exhibited at the cremation ceremony of three of King Chulalongkorn’s children who died at early ages, along with one of his concubines. The solemn occasion took place at Sanam Luang, the main ground in front of the Grand Palace, and the public was invited to admire these representations of the past. Tellingly, the first painting was of the foundation of Ayutthaya by King Uthong. Perhaps more importantly, the poem describing the event was written by King Chulalongkorn himself. The rest followed in a series according to the Ayutthaya and Bangkok phongsawadan (chronicles), focusing on hero-kings, their actions, and battles. Of course, these battles were fought to defend the kingdom against the Burmese. The series ended with painting No. 91 portraying Mongkut’s ordination and painting No. 92 showing Henry Burney, a British envoy, at an audience with King Rama III in 1825.8\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 5\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n6 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nIt is again important to note that this history exhibition was of a dynastic, rather than national, nature; and the time went back to 1350, the founding date of Ayutthaya, linking King Chulalongkorn, who commissioned the project, through the early Bangkok kings right back to the founder, King Uthong. Therefore, the Bangkok-Chakri Dynasty was historically linked with that of Ayutthaya and no other. A glance through lists of turn-of-the-century school history textbooks confirms the conception of time and space and the treatment of history then current. In her study of the Ministry of Education history texts from 1897 to 1969, Suphanni Kanchanatthiti, a senior historian, found that the 1895 official curriculum, probably the oldest, required middle school students to read two history books. The first was A Brief Chronicle (Phongsawadan) of Ayutthaya and the second, A Chronicle (Phongsawadan) of the Present Dynasty.9 She further elaborated that school textbooks from 1897 to 1901 were all about the phongsawadan type of history of Ayutthaya and Thonburi-Bangkok. Suphanni noted that these books were full of detail, “heavy”, boring, and required a great deal of memorization, making them unsuitable for young students. She concluded that one can learn from them more about the good, proper and correct forms of Thai court literary style than about history.10 Between 1913 and 1931, just before the end of the absolute monarchy, history textbooks were slightly changed in content, and a brief world history was included. More interestingly, a new Thai word coined for history began to appear, though phongsawadan was still used. The new term, found in two textbook titles in 1923 and 1930, was prawatkan,11 eventually to be replaced by earlier coinages—prawatsat or prawatisat—now popularly used to mean history.\n\nA Step towards “National History” In his acclaimed study of nationalism,12 Benedict Anderson pointed out the distinction between Chulalongkorn and Vajiravudh as Kings of Siam. In the chapter “Official Nationalism and Imperialism”, Anderson\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 6\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 7\n\ncompared Siam to Japan when both dynasties faced the rise of nationalist movements: Meiji’s contemporary, the long-reigning Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910), defended his realm from Western expansion in a style that differed markedly from that of his Japanese opposite number. Squeezed between British Burma and Malaya, and French Indochina, he devoted himself to a shrewd manipulative diplomacy rather than attempting to build up a serious war machine … Nor was anything much done to push an official nationalism through a modernized educational system … primary education was not made compulsory till more than a decade after his death, and the country’s first university was not set up until 1917, four decades after the founding of the Imperial University of Tokyo … Nonetheless, Chulalongkorn regarded himself as a modernizer. But his prime models were neither the United Kingdom nor Germany, but rather the colonial beamtenstaaten [official states] of the Dutch East Indies, British Malaya, and the Raj. Following these models meant rationalizing and centralizing royal governments, eliminating traditional semi-autonomous tributary statelets, and promoting economic development somewhat along colonial lines. The most striking example … was his encouragement of a massive immigration of young single male foreigners to form the disoriented, politically powerless workforce needed to construct port facilities, build railway lines, dig canals, and expand commercial agriculture. This importing of gastarbeiter [guest workers] paralleled, indeed was modelled on, the policies of the authorities in Batavia and Singapore. And as in the case of the Netherlands Indies and British Malaya, the great bulk of the labourers imported during the nineteenth century were from southeastern China … Indeed the policy made good short-term sense for a dynastic state, since it created an impotent working class ‘outside’ Thai society and left that society largely ‘undisturbed’.”\n\nFor Anderson, Chulalongkorn’s Siam was very much a dynastic realm.13 And as the king’s leadership style was organized around the royal centre, it was logical that the past was treated as dynastic history. However, after the turn of the century, things appear to have changed rapidly. Anderson states:\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 7\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n8 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nWachirawut [Vajiravudh], his son and successor (r. 1910–1925), had to pick up the pieces, modelling himself this time on the self-naturalizing dynasts of Europe. Although—and because—he was educated in late Victorian England, he dramatized himself as his country’s “first nationalist”. The target of this nationalism, however, was neither the United Kingdom, which controlled 90 per cent of Siam’s trade, nor France, which had recently made off with easterly segments of the old realm: it was the Chinese whom his father had so recently and blithely imported. The style of his anti-Chinese stance is suggested by the titles of two of his most famous pamphlets: The Jews of the Orient (1914), and Clogs on Our Wheels (1915).\n\nAnderson concluded: Here is a fine example of the character of official nationalism—an anticipatory strategy adopted by dominant groups which are threatened with marginalization or exclusion from an emerging nationally-imagined community. (It goes without saying that Wachirawut also began moving all the policy levers of official nationalism: compulsory state-controlled primary education, state-organized propaganda, official rewriting of history, militarism—here more visible show than the real thing—and endless affirmation of the identity of dynasty and nation).14\n\nIn short, towards the end of Chulalongkorn’s reign and the early years of Vajiravudh’s, the Thai dynastic realm was increasingly being threatened and had to come to terms with “Nation-ness”. Here are the roots of the shift from dynastic to linear “national” (official) history. Prince Damrong (1862–1943), a half-brother and right-hand man of King Chulalongkorn who served as his minister of education and the interior, would be labelled as “Father of Thai History”.15 In 1914, Prince Damrong introduced a neatly woven, linear, and progressive interpretation of Thai history. From then on, it was accepted as official and “national” up to the present day. The prince wrote that the “history of Siam may properly be divided into three periods, namely, (1) when Sukhothai was the capital, (2) when Ayutthaya was the capital, and (3) since Ratanakosin (Bangkok) has been the capital.”16\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 8\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 9\n\nThis periodization of Thai history became known as sam krung, or three capitals (Sukhothai, Ayutthaya, Ratanakosin/Bangkok). It focuses on the time when each capital and its kings were considered the centre of historical events. This sequence was possibly influenced by the European division of history as classical, medieval and modern. According to these divisions, Sukhothai represented the classical, Ayutthaya medieval, and Ratanakosin/ Bangkok modern. Damrong went back even before classical Sukhothai, adding a lengthy elaboration on eras before the capitals of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya in what was, in his day, central modern Siam. He explained, focusing on territories (space) and races (ethnicities), that the “territory of which Siam is now made up was originally occupied by people of two races, the Khmers (Khom) and the Lao.”17 Since Thais were not the original people of Siam, the Prince had to look elsewhere. By relying on nangsu farang (books written by authors of the white race), Prince Damrong had concluded that the Original home of the Thai was in what is now known as Southern China, in a region stretching from the Yangtse River through Szechuan and Yunnan down to the Lao country18 … the Thai had established several independent states19 … From about the year B.E. 400, as a result of over-population, these Thais began to emigrate to the South-West and South. Later on, the Chinese, as their power increased, extended their frontiers so as to encroach upon the domain of the Thai who, being thus pressed, were unable to dwell in comfort in the region which they had first occupied. Knowing from their fellows who had emigrated previously that it was easier to support life in the lands to the South-West and South, the Thai thereupon descended into those parts in ever growing numbers.20\n\nThe Thai southward migration theory advocated by Prince Damrong was convincingly argued. On their long journey southward from SzechuanYunnan, the Thais paused to establish the mighty Kingdom of Nan Chao (Nanzhao) in Yunnan, which lasted from the sixth to the mid-thirteenth centuries.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 9\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n10 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nThe Prince elaborated at length about Nan Chao (Nanzhao), explaining the hybrid name derivation of the kingdom as from the Chinese (Nan meaning south), whereas Chao (zhao) is a Thai word for lord. “For the better understanding of my reader”, the historian prince explained, “I shall henceforward refer to Nan Chao (Nanzhao) as muang Thai doem, the original country of the Thai.”21 To illustrate his point, the names of the rulers Meng Hsi-nu-lo /Khun Luang (d. 678), Sheng-luo-pi (712–728), P’i-lo-ko/Pilaoko (728–750), and Ko-lo-feng/Khun Luang Fa (750–778) were cited and their actions regarding the Chinese discussed.22 Of the Nan Chao (Nanzhao), Damrong concluded that the Family of King Hsi-Nu-Lo ruled for thirteen generations, extending over a period of 255 years. The customs of the country became more and more assimilated to those of China, owing to the continual influx of Chinese settlers … In BE 1797 (1254), the Mongols of the Yuan dynasty conquered China, extending their territory to the South-West and subduing the original Thai homeland at the same time as they conquered Burma.23\n\nNan Chao (Nanzhao) was lost, but the link continued. Prince Damrong argued that while the Thais were still powerful in their “original home”, many had already migrated to the valleys of the Salween, while some went as far as Arakan and Assam. Large numbers had settled down in northern Vietnam and Laos, and about the year BE 1400 (CE 857), a powerful Thai monarch named Phraya Chao Phrom (or King Brahma, the first of the line of King Uthong who founded Ayutthaya) succeeded in wresting territory from the Khmers … [for] the first Thai settlement on the southern bank of the River Mekhong [south of the present-day Golden Triangle].24\n\nThe last few lines here are crucial to understanding how the Prince established a link between the “original Thai” and their “original home” (muang Thai doem) in southern China on the one hand, and on the other, with King Uthong, founder of Ayutthaya at the heart of modern Siam. A linear and progressive history had been completely and satisfactorily created. The time was pushed back from 1350 to around 850.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 10\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 11\n\nDamrong’s interpretation stretched Thai history back 500 years, if counted from the time of King Phrom, or 800 from Hsi-nu-lo/Khun Luang of Nan Chao (Nanzhao). Meanwhile, the space had been vastly enlarged to cover an area from Sukhothai/Ayutthaya up to the Yangtse and Szechuan-Yunnan. It included the mainland of Southeast Asia: Shan states in Burma, northern Laos, Vietnam, and Assam in India. The Thais were older and bigger than the Angkorian Empire. The Thai “nation” suddenly appeared very ancient. It had a good past (Nan Chao [Nanzhao], Sukhothai, and Ayutthaya) and progressed linearly to modern times (1914). This was a history that had, and probably still has, a profound emotional effect on urban educated Thais. It is unsurprising then to learn that the respected Sino-Thai linguist, anthropologist, and ethnographer Phraya Anuman (1888–1967), is believed to have felt overwhelmed when he stood at the northern tip of modern Siam, in Chiang Rai Province. He imagined a stream of Thais emerging from China into modern Siam on the Southeast Asian mainland.25\n\nFarang—King Vajiravudh and the Contestation Why the change from dynastic to “national history”? Three factors were involved. First was the Thai elite’s contact with the West, especially with farang, or white people. Second was the impact of Vajiravudh, King Rama VI, and his official nationalist policies. Third was domestic pressures and challenges from a new urban educated social stratum, along with a newly emerging free press. Doubtless, the linear and progressive version of national history resulted from the elite’s contact with the West. As Craig J. Reynolds pointed out, [W]e might find that the dominant story types of Western culture have traveled with the global structures of capitalism and the nation-state, a form of the state put in place by elites who had lived and studied in the West. Modern Thai historiography is, to a large extent, a Western import, though it bears some unmistakable features of being a Thai historiography.26\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 11\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n12 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nAlthough Thais from the generations of Mongkut and ChulalongkornDamrong did not dwell or study in the West, they were highly familiar with its core values and ideas. Mongkut was one of the first Thais to learn how to speak and write English, mainly by teaching himself and associating with missionaries. The future King Chulalongkorn, his brothers and sisters, as well as ladies of the court were tutored by different foreign teachers. The best-remembered of these is Anna Leonowens, whose fictionalized memoir later inspired the Broadway musical comedy The King and I.27 A handful of Thai elites followed the same path as the royal children. Some went overseas to get a Western colonial education in British schools in neighbouring Penang and Singapore. In the 1880s, by the time Chulalongkorn’s children were of schoolgoing age, a tradition had started in which princes and other sons of the nobility were sent to elite schools in western Europe, especially England. This was the beginning of a long line of a new breed—the nakrian nok (returning students from overseas education). When these foreign-educated pupils reappeared in Siam, they enjoyed much influence, easily rising in bureaucratic careers. They had huge advantages over their domestically educated counterparts, the nakrian nai, and were far more successful materially. In short, Western education, whether formal or informal, overseas or domestic, had become part of the Thai elite’s world since the latter part of the nineteenth century. They knew about the West from classrooms, books, or newspapers, and were also in physical contact with powerful and civilized farang at home and overseas: missionaries, merchants, diplomats, teachers, and friends. It might be useful to visualize the kind of social environment in which the Thai elite encountered farang. The experience probably made them more conscious of their own identity. It is easy to imagine that the farang often asked about Siam this and that, as well as being Thai or about Thai things. Phaithūn Phongsabut, a geographer, and Wilatwong Phongsabut, a historian, both at Chulalongkorn University, observed that works by farang scholars on the Thai race and the original Thai homeland had a profound\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 12\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 13\n\nimpact on the writing of Thai “national history”, probably as early as the turn of the nineteenth century. For example, in his Cradle of the Shan Race (1885), Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1844–94), an orientalist at University College, London, was likely the first to suggest that the Thais originally lived in Central China before migrating south. He came to this conclusion by comparing different Tai dialects of Southeast Asia and those spoken in China. At about the same time, others arrived at similar conclusions. Archibald Ross Colquhoun (1848–1914), first Administrator of Southern Rhodesia (1890–94), a self-governing British colony in Africa, was among these pioneers. Colquhoun led several exploratory expeditions to Assam, Burma, Indochina and southern China. In his volume Across Chrysê: Being the Narrative of a Journey of Exploration Through the South China Border Lands from Canton to Mandalay (1883), Colquhoun suggested that the Thais were from Yunnan. His proposal was further confirmed by Edward Harper Parker (1849–1926), a British consular official in Hainan, in his essay published in The Chinese Recorder, “The Old Thai Empire” (March 1894). This was when Nan Chao (Nanzhao) was first identified as a Thai kingdom.28 These are some examples of works in which the Thai ruling elite had to engage with a farang-dominated new world. The situation never existed in the early Ratanakosin/Bangkok days of the first two King Ramas (1782–1824). They were never confronted by questions of race or the original Thai homeland. Their Thai world was religious and dynastic, not national. But by the middle of the nineteenth century, when Western models of nationhood were being emulated, copied and pirated, it became necessary to deal with the issues of race and homeland. Culture was a crucial mediating force because Siam had abundant religious relics, pagodas, Buddha images, and Hindu statues that were studied and classified by Western scholars from the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Germany and other nations. Identities such as Dvaravati Mon, Angkorian Khmer, and other terms relating to race or kingdom were duly attached to archaeological artefacts.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 13\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n14 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nConsequently, the Thais came to believe that their original homeland was elsewhere. China and Nan Chao (Nanzhao) were proposed as sites of origin upon “scientific” grounds. They seemed appropriate and archeologically (borankhadi) correct.29 By the start of the twentieth century, Western-style interest in antiquity and a search for the past had become accepted and even fashionable among the Thai ruling elite. Their contacts with—and frequent visits to—Western colonies in Southeast Asia, plus first-hand knowledge of European civilization gave them access to organizations of learning, such as the Royal Asiatic Society, the École française d’Extrême-Orient (EFEO), and many museums, libraries and journals. One effect was that a series of activities and institutions were established. In 1904, the Siam Society was founded under the patronage of Crown Prince Vajiravudh, who had just returned from his studies in the United Kingdom. Among the first articles in the Journal of the Siam Society was Prince Damrong’s “The Foundation of Ayuthia”.30 Thai history was discussed, proposed, and in some way, also created in the journal. In 1905, the Ho Samut Samrap Phra Nakhon, or Bangkok Library,31 was launched, again with the Crown Prince as president. It was not entirely new, since its predecessor, the Vajirayana Library, had been inaugurated in memory of King Mongkut. In 1907, the Royal Research Society (Samakhom subsuan khong buran nai prathet sayam, later changed to Borankhadi Samoson or Antiquarian Society) was also started. These institutions were mechanisms to search for, and learn about, Thainess while promoting official nationalism. From these endeavors grew what is known as Thai studies today. Such studies of antiquity had a particularly acute political and psychological impact upon the Thai ruling elite and the urban educated. The second point to stress is the impact of Vajiravudh, Rama VI, and his official nationalist policy. As suggested above, the last ten years of King Chulalongkorn’s reign were crucial for understanding changes within Thai society in connection with a nation-state’s emergence and search for new historiography.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 14\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 15\n\nWhen Vajiravudh returned from England in 1902 at the age of twentyone, after a nine-year educational sojourn in England, he was poised to become the first king who was a nakrian nok. Indeed, he differed from his predecessors on the throne. As a prince and later king (1910–25), Vajiravudh was considered rather aloof; he isolated himself from his father’s large and active palace family, relatives, and the bureaucracy. In the early years of his reign, he often stayed at the newly built Sanam Chandra Palace in Nakhon Pathom Province, 56 kilometres outside Bangkok. He surrounded himself with a male entourage and occupied himself in singular ways. The Bangkok circle likely thought of him as somewhat plaek or pralad (strange or unusual). The fifteen years he spent on the throne fell between the long, successful absolutist forty-two-year reign of his father and the relatively weak and unsuccessful effort by the brother who succeeded him, Prajadhipok (Rama VII; 1925–35). As a highly prolific author, Vajiravudh is now officially remembered as Phra Maha Dhiraratchao, or the Great Scholar King. He signed around 200 travelogues, plays, poetry, songs, articles, and sermons with over 100 pen names. He is also known for his official nationalistic policy which earned him the title of Father of Thai Nationalism.32 The reign of Vajiravudh was a time of change. The first work stoppages by Bangkok’s Chinese merchants and labourers occurred just before his first coronation on 11 November 1910. The next year, the Celestial Monarchy in Peking abruptly ended.33 February 1912 saw an attempted coup, known as Kabot R.S. 130, or the 1912 Rebellion, aimed at overthrowing Vajiravudh. It happened only a few months after the thirteen-day extravaganza of his second coronation in November 1911. Indeed, the 1900s and 1910s differed from previous years. With domestic changes, a new, albeit small, educated middle class emerged, several of whom were Sino-Thai, critical of their absolute monarchy. The time was also marked by the spread of a free press claiming to represent paksiang (mouth and voice) of the common people; in addition, print capitalism34 also made people think of their status in society differently.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 15\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n16 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nAnd as mentioned before, the rise of nationalism—along with the fall of monarchies in Europe and Asia (the Qing, Ottomans, Romanovs, Habsburgs)—motivated King Vajiravudh to consolidate his rule and compelled him to embark on an individual nationalist policy. On 1 May 1911, not long after his first coronation, Vajiravudh founded the Wild Tigers Corps (sue pa), a royal national paramilitary force intended to “instill the love of the nation” among the Thai. On 1 July, he followed it up by establishing the Boy Scouts (luk sua, meaning cubs or male offspring of a tiger). The Wild Tigers Corps was soon criticized as an unprofessional extension of the king’s personal bodyguards. Military leaders did not approve, and the corps was dissolved soon after the reign ended. Yet within the Wild Tigers circle, the king launched his nationalist programmes. He personally lectured them about chat (nation), satsana (religion), and phra maha kasat (great king),35 which became the three pillars of Siamese modern state ideology; since then, this so-called Holy Trinity has been exploited frequently by right-wing military regimes. King Vajiravudh used different strategies in historiography and constructing historical narratives to achieve the policy of pluk chat-pluk chai or Wake the Nation and the Heart. Doing so, he coined a new Thai term for history, prawatisat (from the Pali-Sanskrit: paravati + sastra or science of recording). He may have found the established Thai word phongsawadan unsuitable in a global context since its direct translation, referring to the reincarnation of a royal family, did not appear sufficiently modern. Prawatisat caught on, and by 1917 the word was frequently seen in titles of history texts.36 Following the Thai ruling elite’s aforementioned interest in antiquity, one important outing for Vajiravudh was to visit the “classical heartland of the Thai”. In 1907, the Crown Prince voyaged to Kamphaengphet, Sukhothai, Sawankhalok, Uttaradit and Phitsanulok. The trip took four months by train, boat and horse. Vajiravudh clearly intended to “discover” the Sukhothai Kingdom. He went very well prepared, taking along copies of translations of King Ramkhamhaeng’s Inscription\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 16\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 17\n\n(translated into modern Thai by the French scholar of Southeast Asian archaeology and history George Cœdès, not long before this trip). He also carried a copy of the translation of a Sukhothai inscription, the Phongsawadan Nua (Chronicle of the North), and a Phongsawadan Krung Si Ayutthaya. These served in some ways as his guidebooks. The Prince examined most of the major ruins in those five cities. He noted details of his observations and added extensive comments, using the inscription and phongsawadan as references. He compared them with sites in Egypt.37 The outcome of the trip was a sizeable volume entitled Ruang Thieo Muang Phra Ruang (A Tour of the Phra Ruang Country 1908) printed with photographs and an appendix consisting of King Ramkhamhaeng’s Inscription. In a preface, Vajiravudh expressed the hope that his writings and discoveries would make Thais “aware that Our Thai Nation (chat Thai) is not a new nation, and not a nation of barbarians, or what is called in English ‘uncivilized’”.38 In short, Vajiravudh not only “discovered” Sukhothai but gave life to ruins that had been abandoned and covered with trees and vines for over a century since the late 1700s. His observations and comments became part of the plot for a linear history to be developed in full by Prince Damrong in 1914, as mentioned above. This trip set the stage for what would later become Sukhothai-ism among the Thai ruling class. From then on, the ruins of Sukhothai symbolized the golden age of national Thai history. Sukhothai’s stone inscriptions and phongsawadan written records would become sources of inspiration, sparking the imaginations of professional and amateur Thai historians. To them, Sukhothai was an exceptional Buddhist realm of righteous kings “elected” by public consent; it was rich and fertile with “fish in water and rice in the fields”.39 His upper-class education in Victorian England had familiarized Vajiravudh with Shakespeare, operetta and English language popular theatre. Indeed, the king fell very much in love with English literature and drama. He translated into Thai Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice,\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 17\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n18 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nand As You Like It. He also restaged many plays and performances he had seen in England, from Othello to Gilbert and Sullivan’s Mikado for court audiences. He even acted in many of them. These included the 1888 play My Friend Jarlet (as Mittara Teah or True Friend) by Arnold Golsworthy (1865–1939) and E.B. Norman, a work which outside Thailand has been largely forgotten, as well as its authors. It was in this context that the king began to turn episodes from the phongsawadan into plays to “waken” the Nation (pluk chat). Of his many plays, two featuring legendary heroes are worth mentioning. They are the stories of Phra Ruang and Thao Saenpom, illuminating Vajiravudh’s type of nationalism and construction of linear history. Three Phra Ruang plays exist: a dance drama from 1912, a modernized version in 1914, and a later musical in the Bangkok style from 1924. The best-remembered today is the 1914 play originally prepared for the king’s Wild Tigers entourage.40 It was formerly included in high school textbooks. Vajiravudh found the plot in the Phongsawadan Nua (Chronicle of the North) which he carried along on his 1907 tour, although at the time he commented that the document was unreliable on historical facts.41 According to the chronicle, Phra Ruang was Governor of Lopburi (Lavo), just north of Ayutthaya. His duty was to send water as a tribute to the king of Angkor. Using a magic spell, Phra Ruang could command water to remain in bamboo baskets. Upon learning that a man had such powers, the Angkorian king sent a soldier to execute Phra Ruang, who fled to Sukhothai. The Khmer soldier chased after him by diving into the earth, emerging on the grounds of the Temple of the Great Relics (Wat Phra Si Rattana Mahathat) in Sukhothai, where he eventually found Phra Ruang. Not recognizing him, the soldier asked the governor himself where he might be found. Using magic, Phra Ruang advised the soldier to stay and wait there. The Khmer immediately turned to stone and has stayed put there ever since. Seeing that Phra Ruang had such miraculous powers, the people of Sukhothai “invited/elected” him to be their king. End of story.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 18\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 19\n\nBy transforming this tale into a play, Vajiravudh modernized and rationalized it to fit a modern nation. For him, Phra Ruang was a Thai king of Lopburi, a vassal of Cambodia. Phra Ruang was ingenious, having invented the basket for carrying water, light enough for long-distance transportation from the central Menam basin to Angkor. Upon learning of such a clever Thai, the Khmer king sent his commander to eliminate him. The commander went underground (not diving into the earth as in the original version) to find Phra Ruang. He went all the way to Sukhothai, where Phra Ruang was hiding. He met the king, whom he did not recognize, and asked how to find him. Phra Ruang told him to wait, called his men to arrest the Khom, and had chased him back to Cambodia, effectively freeing the Thais from the Cambodian yoke. In his preface to the play, Vajiravudh said that Phra Ruang was a “ruang ching” or true story.42 After peeling off all the miraculous and fabulous camouflage, he suggested, historical verity remained. He identified Phra Ruang with a figure in the Ramkhamhaeng Inscription. In his opinion, Phra Ruang was Si Intrathit, the first king of Sukhothai. He made the Thais independent and in return, the local population invited him to be their monarch. By matching the story in the chronicle with information from the inscription and a touch of modern rationalist interpretation, Vajiravudh had constructed the first Thai capital and dynasty, forming a link with previous dynasties in China and with later ones in Ayutthaya and Ratanakosin/Bangkok. There was a further extravagant attempt to link Sukhothai with Ratanakosin/Bangkok and the Chakri Dynasty. In 1925, preparations were made for an exhibition to showcase the products and culture of Siam at the site now known as Suan Lumpini, on what was then the outskirts of Bangkok. The Bangkok Expo was meant to be a grand event, like those popular in Europe and the United States, which Vajiravudh had experienced while studying in England from 1893 to 1902. For the fifteenth anniversary of the king’s accession to the throne, it was deemed appropriate to have such a grand exhibition to promote Siam as a modern, although unindustrialized, nation. However, the king\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 19\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n20 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nfelt badly ill and passed away on 25 November 1925. The Bangkok Expo never occurred. Yet a commemorative volume entitled Souvenir of the Siamese Kingdom Exhibition at Lumbini Park B.E. 2468 was prepared for print. Two years later, in 1927, it was published in English and Thai with compelling illustrations. The section “Historical Sketch of Siam” features a photo of a ruined pagoda. The caption reads The Seven Rows of Pagodas, Swankaloke, The Middle One Being the Abiding Place of the Relics of the First of the Chakri Dynasty. This was an attempt to link the Chakri, or probably Vajiravudh himself, with the Sukhothai-Phra Ruang Dynasty, a line some 600 years distant, back to the thirteenth century. It is difficult, almost impossible, to prove any such connection. But nations and nationalism may imagine what is unprovable.\n\nThin-Skinned The other play was Thao Saenpom or The King Who Had a Hundred Thousand Bumps on His Body. In it, King Vajiravudh again “demythologized the history of the father of the founder of Ayutthaya”.43 As the historian Walter F. Vella pointed out, Thao Saenpom was not turned into a national hero as Phra Ruang had been. Yet by removing the miraculous and fabulous coating around this legendary figure, Vajiravudh again concluded that his hero was real and historical. He established a link between King Uthong’s father and branches of ruling Thai families who had migrated across the Mekong into present-day northern Siam. In 1913, in a handwritten memorandum, the king theorized at length about Thao Saenpom, including where he came from and what he had done. He cited his discussions and arguments on the subject with Prince Damrong and another scholar, Ayutthaya governor Phraya Boran (Phon Tejagupta, 1871–1936), about whether Uthong’s city was located south of Kamphaengphet, or Nakhon Pathom, or Suphanburi. The opinions of these royal-aristocratic historians differed in detail to an extent beyond the scope of this chapter. They shared one vision in common: a linear history of the Thai nation and the steady southward migration of the Thai people.44\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 20\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 21\n\nAs is clear from the above account, those involved in the making and writing of history were kings, princes, and other members of the nobility. Modern Thai national history thus appears as a craft of the ruling elite. It was a prerogative of the ruling elite of the dynastic realm. An Ayutthayan law describes the daily royal routine from 7:00 a.m. until late at night, specifying that at 1:00 a.m., the Phongsawadan is to be read to the king before His Majesty retires to bed.45 Royal manuscripts were jealously guarded and regarded as sacred. They were kept at the centre of power and were not intended for the public. In the mid-nineteenth century, when one officer got a newfangled bourgeois idea and printed the kotmai tra sam duang, or Three Seals Law, for sale, Rama III had the books confiscated and enshrined in a pagoda at Wat Saket in Bangkok. It took an outsider to break the taboo. By 1863, Rama III was long gone and Mongkut, his half-brother, had become Rama VI (r. 1851–68). Dan Beach Bradley (1804–73), an American Protestant missionary from Marcellus, New York, defied tradition by printing a Phongsawadan in two volumes. They were for sale and were allowed to circulate freely. Bradley was a key figure in bringing print capitalism and modern journalism to Siam. He was the first to translate the American Constitution into Thai language, published in his own journal in the late 1860s. This English language journal, The Bangkok Recorder, received subscription requests from seventeen princes, fifty-seven noblemen, seven foreigners (farang and Chinese), and nineteen monks and commoners46 for a total circulation of only 100. The literate circle, mostly male, of Bangkok was still very limited. This first newspaper of Siam was printed monthly from 1844 to 1845 and again from 1865 to 1867. It did not prosper commercially. Nevertheless, printing had become a competitive business. Another American missionary, Samuel Smith, founded his own printing house, issuing the Siam Weekly Advertiser and Siam Repository. For a time, King Mongkut likewise had his court announcements printed as ratchakitchanubeksa, the Royal Gazette. In 1873, in the era of Chulalongkorn, the Royal Printing House was established.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 21\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n22 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nNevertheless, the ruling elite began to gradually lose their prerogatives, as David K. Wyatt has noted: Late in the Fifth Reign and early in the Sixth, a handful of mavericks, outsiders, trenchantly criticized the existing social, economic, and political order. Noteworthy among them were the turn-of-the-century journalists and essayists K.S.R. Kularb and Thianwan, both commoners.\n\nCraig J. Reynolds called K.S.R. Kularb (1834–1913) a “challenge to royal historical writing” and Walter Vella praised Thianwan as “a man who fought giants”.47 Both became known through print capitalism and belong to the first group of nationalists from humble backgrounds.48 Kularb became involved with the realm of royal history. He was born in Bangkok at a time when Western influence, especially the printing press and journalism, first made itself felt. His father was Chinese, while his mother was from the Nakhon Ratchasima (known as Korat) official class. He grew up in a minor princely residence, became a novice and later a monk, thus receiving a traditional Thai education. But he represented not only old Siam but also the modern West, during the fifteen years that he toiled as a clerk for several farang companies. Reportedly he travelled widely to Singapore, Penang, Sumatra, Manila, Batavia, Macao, Hong Kong and Calcutta. Some even claim that he went as far as England which would have outdone some Siamese kings and princes. By the 1880s, Kularb was known and respected as a learned man in the small-scale educated circle of the Bangkok elite. He stood out because of his background as a commoner, as well as his energetic printing and writing. He had become a bibliophile, with a large personal library. In 1882, on the occasion of the Bangkok-Chakri Centennial, Kularb joined a royal exhibition by showcasing 1,000 books from his private collection. In the 1890s, he became an editor and published his own journal, Sayam praphet. A prolific author, he wrote many works expressing changes that took place during the transitional nineteenth century. He published biographies and genealogies of important individuals and families of Siam, an unusual activity at the time. Eventually, this practice got him into trouble with the Palace, when he wrote a biography of a Supreme Patriarch. Kularb was accused of lèse\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 22\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 23\n\nmajesté and fabrication. After the investigation was over, he was sent for a one-month hospital stay to be “cured” of his “madness” (a new notion of punishment in modern Siam).49 After that, his reputation was tarnished. The ruling elite, which had no interest in a writer from outside its circles, had successfully associated him with lies, fabrication, invention, shamelessness, and madness. As Reynolds pointed out, his crime was likely “borrowing” and “pirating” royal documents, which he later edited and published in different versions. This infuriated the ruling elite. In 1897, Kularb wrote an essay, “On the Independence of a Country”. He presented it as a series of questions and answers exchanged by a father and son, including some recondite references from Phongsawadan and other ancient texts: Q: What must one do to remain a civilized and independent country? A: To remain independent and prosperous, a country must have four qualities. It must: (1) be a land of the Buddha, (2) be a Kingdom ruled with law and order, (3) have a good Government and (4) have good people.\n\nThis was Kularb’s idea of the nation, which he formulated long before the triad of nation, religion, and king of Vajiravudh. Notably, he emphasized good leadership and good relations between king and people as mutually dependent masters and servants. As Reynolds put it, Evidence exists that [Kularb] had a part in awakening nationalist sentiments, speaking sometimes as a cultural nationalist by criticizing European handkerchiefs, Egyptian cigarettes, Swedish matches, and imported whisky in which faddish residents of Bangkok indulged. But his reaction was not so much one of xenophobia but of dismay at the lack of confidence in the Siamese way.50\n\nIn his publication Ayatiwat (Growth or Progress; 1911)51 he compiled 136 stories about “changes from old to new customs”, offering a vivid picture\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 23\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n24 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nof what was happening in the top echelons of Thai society at the time. He wanted to inform and alert his public readership, the small urban educated class in Bangkok, about changes taking place. The cover of Ayatiwat was decorated with his seal and picture inside a rose (his name Kularb, a word derived from the Persian, means rose). On it he wrote “Ayatiwat: A book for knowledge of the people, on the changes of various official customs, from old to new, 136 stories, useful for officials and the public to know.”52 Kularb survived until the age of 79, but by the time he died in 1913, he had been reduced to an impoverished, marginalized status. Kularb’s life and work indicate that the rise of nationalism and nationness in Siam was not just hierarchical. This becomes more explicit in a PhD thesis by Matthew Phillip Copeland, Contested Nationalism and the 1932 Overthrow of the Absolute Monarchy in Siam.53 Copeland convincingly argues that the role of the Chakri kings in the “early history of Thai nationalism has been grossly overstated”, that attempts to make monarchy the “focal point of Thai nationalist sentiment met with little success”, and that Thai nationalism is a matter of contestation between the “ruling elite and a disenfranchised urban literato”.54 Copeland observed that many royal nationalist programmes triggered criticism, contestation, and reinterpretations, of the concept of samakkhi or unity, patriotism, nationalism, and most controversially, races and the Chinese. From 1912 to 1915, Vajiravudh wrote essays under his penname Asvabahu, promoting his ideas of the nation. Using strong and sharp language, they invited responses, backlash, and sometimes outright ridicule. Vajiravudh promoted unity, but his critics from among the disenfranchised urban literati countered with diversity. For example, in his 1915 essay on “True Nationhood”, Vajiravudh wrote that there were many interpretations of chat, or Nations. Some were held by those who claimed that they were samai mai, or modern, but this group was merely following the farang, or Westerners. Vajiravudh compared them with Thewathat, the enemy of the Buddha, because following these people would amount to destroying the nation. He went on to elaborate on which words were beneficial to the nation.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 24\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 25\n\nHe put it simply: words which created unity, yes, but division, no. He concluded that what was national was determined by one’s language. To him, nation and language were one. A further requirement was loyalty. “If he loves and is loyal to the King of Siam, he is, therefore, really Thai (Thai thae thae).” On the other hand, if one considered oneself free, with no loyalty to anyone, one must be stateless, since no one person or group can be established as a separate nation. Such essays triggered heated reactions over who were the “nation’s real patriots”. There was even an assertion implying that the “false patriots” of the realm were none other than Vajiravudh and his courtiers.55 His 1914 essay, “Jews of the Orient” was controversial, suggesting that, according to one academic, the “Anglicized monarch had imbibed the particular racisms of the English ruling class”.56 It also met with mild to extreme approval, but hostile reactions were common, especially from the Sino-Thai community. Copeland referred to an editorial in Chino-Sayam Warasap, Thailand’s first daily Chinese newspaper, which urged its readers to oppose such discriminatory views. However, the tone of the editorial was highly restrained. The editor also offered a brief explanation of how he conceived of his “duties” as a Sino-Thai, asking readers to judge for themselves whether he posed a threat to the nation. Among other things, he noted that he had a responsibility to promote justice in Siam, to not only love justice as an abstract principle but also to make sure that it was afforded to “people of all races” so that none could claim that the kingdom had no justice to give them… he felt there was nothing right about unjustly maligning “fellow citizens of Chinese descent.”57\n\nOn 22 July 1917, King Vajiravudh declared war against Germany and the Central Powers. The declaration, drafted by the king himself, stated that Siam wished to defend the “peace of the world”, “respect for small states”, and the “sanctity of International Rights”.58 An expeditionary force of 1,300 soldiers was sent to Europe. They marched under a new three-\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 25\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n26 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\ncoloured national flag: red (symbolizing the nation), white (religion), and blue (king). The symbol of Siam had thus been changed from an image of a white elephant before a red background to fall in line with iconographic norms of the civilized West. War became an act of nation-building. The king’s declaration was therefore praised as wise and practical because “first, [Siam] will secure her place as an independent nation…. she will throw off extraterritorial rights which now brand her as a nation of inferior civilization … (and) relieve her of unequal and unfair tariff agreements.”59 But the king’s policy did not go unchallenged. Narin Phasit (1874– 1959),60 a controversial gadfly, opposed the war declaration, claiming that “Siam should just sit still. Joining the war is like joining a pack of dogs’ (ma mu, or when dogs gang up to attack others). Narin was jailed for two years.61 But he had already taken a place among those who joined the “contest for the Nation” like Kularb, Thianwan, and other political journalists. Narin had served as governor of Nakhon Nayok, but had resigned in 1911, disgusted by bureaucracy. He proceeded to found his own press, propagating ideas about nation, religion, and monarchy. He published pamphlets like Choie bamrung chat [Help and Care for the Nation] and launched Khana yindi kan kadkhan [Glad to Oppose Party], to help exploited and underprivileged people petition the king. One of Narin’s most important achievements was successfully disputing ngoen ratchupakan, a head tax levied upon the population. He managed to eliminate it after the coup of 1932; the new government went along with Narin’s long, patient campaign. In terms of religion, Narin accused the sangha, the community of monks, of materialism. He overturned Thai men’s monopoly on Buddhist ordination by having his daughter ordained as a monk, a tradition he claimed existed in Buddha’s time, but had lapsed in modern Siam. As for the monarchy, Narin campaigned for the rehabilitation of King Taksin, whom he respected for restoring the independence of Siam after the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767. Taksin was portrayed by early Bangkok phongsawadan as having gone insane, a claim that was used to justify his execution by Rama I, a\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 26\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\nFrom Dynastic to “National History” • 27\n\nSiamese general who created a new dynasty, the Chakri, in 1782. Since the mid-nineteenth century, Taksin’s Chineseness was exaggerated to weaken his legitimacy as a king of Siam. King Mongkut wrote, “The first king established in Bangkok was an extraordinary man of Chinese origin, named Pin Tat. He was called by the Chinese Tia Sin Tat, or Tuat.”62 That does not necessarily mean Mongkut was overly concerned about race. It may have been natural for him to state the kind of fact which he had learned. But by the time of Vajiravudh, race had become an important element in nationalistic programmes. The Souvenir of the Siamese Kingdom Exhibition at Lumbini Park B.E. 2468, the 1925 commemorative volume published at the end of Vajiravudh’s reign, put it candidly: It was reported that the King had become very unpopular owing to at least three causes: his foreign extraction, for he was partly Chinese by birth; his appointment to those high offices which the Siamese considered should have been regarded, so to speak, as an heirloom for themselves … the King was forced to his mental attitude, and, as a result, the conclusion was come to that it was a matter of absolute necessity that there should be a change … [and] selected one of their own members as his successor … Somdet Chao Phya Maha Krasat Seuk [Rama I].63\n\nIn the early morning of 24 June 1932, a coup took place. The last absolute monarch, King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) and his Queen were at their seaside residence, Klai Kang Won (Sanssouci) Palace in Hua Hin, 190 kilometres south of Bangkok. A group of 100 Western-educated military officers, lawyers, and bureaucrats had assembled a People’s Party, or Khana Ratsadon. They called themselves promoters (phu ko kan, short for phu ko kan plian plaeng kan pokkhrong, literally, initiators of change in government). They took five days, from 24 to 28 June, to finish the task: June 24: Captured power and held senior princes and ministers hostage. June 25: Handed an ultimatum to the king to cede power and return to Bangkok. June 26: Received the king’s agreement to sign a royal pardon for the coup’s promoters.\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 27\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n28 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\nJune 27: Had the king sign an interim constitution. June 28: Convened parliament with seventy selected representatives and appointed Phraya Mano, a senior lawyer, as first Prime Minister of postabsolute monarchy Siam. Siam’s short-lived absolute monarchy from Rama V to Rama VII (Chulalongkorn to Prajadhipok by way of Vajiravudh) had ended.64 The nation was transformed by the People’s Party, or Khana ratsadon into a “constitutional monarchy”.65 NOTES 1.

The word Phongsawadan is generally translated as chronicle. It combines two Pali-Sanskrit words: vaṃsa (line, family, king) and avatāra (reincarnation). The coining is vaṃsāvatāra, pronounced phongsawadan in Thai language. They mostly contain dynastic history, with stories of kings who are supposed to be reincarnations of Hindu gods. In the Thai case, the king is a reincarnation of Vishnu.

Vajiravudh dated his dynastic state/nation Ratanakosin-Chakri back 700 years to Sukhothai in the thirteenth century, comprising a space within the boundaries of modern Siam. King Narai (1656–88) of the Ayutthya-Prasatthong dynasty went back further, to the eighth century, and extended the nation to Cambodia. For Narai if a golden age existed, it was not in Sukhothai, but Angkor.

Ironically, Prince Damrong (1862–1943) is popularly labelled as Phra Bida Haeng Prawatisat Thai, meaning Royal Father of Thai history. The prince never fully accepted the newly coined word prawatisat, corresponding to the English “history”. He remained committed to Phongsawadan (popularly taken as meaning chronicle) until the end. 16.

Prince Damrong mistook the word Lao for Lawa. The two are ethnically and linguistically different. Lao belongs to the Tai-Lao family and Lawa is Mon-Khmer. He went on to ask, “Who were the original Khmers and Lāo? To-day we only know that the peoples designated under the names of Kha, Khamu, Cambodians, Mons and Meng all speak languages which are of Khmer stock. We may conclude, therefore, that these peoples are descended from the Khmers. As for the original Lāo, they are to be identified in the people styled today Luă or Lawā…”.

Strangely, Nan Chao (Nanzhao) names of kings do not sound Thai, and that Nan Chao kings had naming customs different from the Thais. For example, the three names of its famous warrior kings: (A) Sheng-lo-pi; (B) P’i-lo-ko; and (C) Ko-lo-fung. The last word of (A) becomes the first of (B), and the last of (B) becomes first of (C). This is probably a genealogy, signalling succession from father to son. This naming custom was unknown in old or modern Siam. Prince Damrong dismissed this issue with only a casual remark. He stated: “As regards the Chinese rendering of the names of the Thai kings, it is quite impossible to say what were the various equivalents in the Thai language”, ibid., p. 65. 23. Ibid., p. 65. 24.

As mentioned above, the theory that China was the original homeland of the Thai and their mighty kingdom was Nan Chao, was finally accepted by Prince Damrong in 1914. The idea was further developed by Luang Wichitwathakan in the 1930s and 1940s, especially after the 1932 coup overthrowing the absolute monarchy. It became a monstrous Thai past, attached with nationalistic emotion during the first Phibun regime (1938–43) when even the official name of the country, Siam, was changed to Thailand in 1939. The theory remained unchallenged through the 1950s until in 1964 when Frederick W. Mote, a senior China Historian at Princeton University, criticized its validity in his short, but influential, article “Problems of Thai Prehistory”, Sangkhomsat Parithat 2, no. 2 (October 1964). The idea of original homeland, however, remained influential within academic circles. See also Lak Thai [Thai Pillars], a highly influential text on the Thai original homeland by Khun Wichitmatra (Sa-nga Kanchanakhaphan; 1897–1980). The book was given a literary prize by King Prajadhipok in 1928. See also Charles Backus, The Nan-chao kingdom and T’ang China’s Southern Frontier (Redwood Burn Ltd., Trowbridge, Wiltshire: Cambridge Studies in Chinese history, Literature, and Institutions, 1981), pp. 47–52.

The word borankhadi, which is now taken to mean archaeology, reveals an inherent connection between race and homeland. It means studies or affairs of old things. Since old things were labelled as Mon or Khmer, Thais must originally be from elsewhere. 30. A good account of the early years of the Siam Society is by William Warren, The Siam Society: A Century (Bangkok: The Siam Society, 2004). 31. The library’s name is usually translated as “National Library”. However, in Thai it is the Library for Phra Nakhon (Nagara), meaning for Bangkok and/or for the capital, which further implies that it belongs to the dynastic, rather than the national realm. 32. The best positive account of Vajiravudh in English is by Walter F. Vella, Chaiyo! King Vajiravudh and the Development of Thai Nationalism (Honolulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1978). On his official nationalism, see more in Anderson’s Imagined Communities (cited above) and Kullada Kedboonchoo,\n\n22-J08326 01 Thailand_A Struggle for the Nation.indd 31\n\n12/4/22 8:52 AM\n\n32 • Thailand: A Struggle for the Nation\n\n“Official Nationalism under King Chulalongkorn”, paper presented at the International Conference on Thai Studies, Canberra, 1987; also see her The Rise and Decline of Thai Absolutism (London: RouledgeCurzon, 2004). The book is translated into Thai as Somburanayasitthirat: Wiwatthakan rat Thai (Fah diew kan, 2019). See also Stephen L.W. Greene, Absolute Dreams: Thai Government Under Rama VI, 1910–1925 (Bangkok: White Lotus, 1999), and a provocative new treatment of the inner court life of Vajiravudh by Chanan Yodhongs, Nai nai nai samai ratchakan thi 6 [Inner Men in the Reign of King Rama VI] (Bangkok: Matichon, 2013). 33.

Benedict Anderson remarks that Vajiravudh’s triad echoes the theme of late Tsarist Russia, Autocracy, Orthodoxy and Nationality, but in reverse order. Anderson, Imagined Communities, p. 101. Many Thais believe that the king copied the English slogan of God, King, and Country, adapting it in a different order in Thai language. 36. See Krommakhun Phitthayalab, Huakho prawatisat phak 1 [Headings of History, Part 1], 1917. The author claimed that he first saw this word used by Ramchitti, one of King Vajiravudh’s many pen names, published in Witthayachan, no. 16, p. 104. 37.

Here, the prince assumed the pen name: Ram Vajiravudh. One must wonder whether the prince had, by this time, come to identify himself with Rama of the Ramayana as well as King Ramkhamhaeng of Sukhothai. He seems to have merged the present with the past. Vajiravudh also started the traditions of naming Chakri kings Rama and numbering them as Rama I, II, III to Rama X. In the heated debate over whether the King Ramkhamhaeng Inscription is genuine, Dr Piriya Krairiksh used the writings of Vajiravudh along with his extensive study of the context of the Inscription, to question the validity of the famous stone, which had become the foundation of the modern Thai state and Sukhothai historiography. See the huge volume by James R. Chamberlain, The Ram Khamhaeng Controversy (Bangkok: The Siam Society, 1991). 39.
