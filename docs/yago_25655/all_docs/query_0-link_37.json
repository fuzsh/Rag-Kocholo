        "text": "Thailand, officially the Kingdom of Thailand and formerly known as Siam, is a country in Southeast Asia that was a Puppet Regime of Japan since Japan invaded the country in 1941 all the way to 1980 in which the nation gained independence from Japan.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPre-WII, WWII and After[]\n\nA bloodless revolution took place in 1932, carried out by a group of military and civilian officials Khana Ratsadon. Prajadhipok was forced to grant the country's first constitution, thereby ending centuries of absolute monarchy. The combined results of economic hardships brought on by the Great Depression, sharply falling rice prices, and a significant reduction in public spending caused discontent among aristocrats. In 1933, a counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred which aimed to reinstate absolute monarchy, but failed. Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to abdication. The government selected Ananda Mahidol, who was studying in Switzerland, to be the new king.\n\nLater that decade, the army wing of Khana Ratsadon came to dominate Siamese politics. Plaek Phibunsongkhram (b. 1897) who became premier in 1938, started political oppression and took an openly anti-royalist stance. His government adopted nationalism and Westernisation, anti-Chinese and anti-French policies. In 1939, there was a decree changing the name of the country from \"Siam\" to \"Thailand\". In 1941, Thailand was in a brief conflict with Vichy France resulting in Thailand gaining some Lao and Cambodian territories. On 8 December 1941, the Empire of Japan launched an invasion of Thailand, and fighting broke out shortly before Phibun ordered an armistice. Japan was granted free passage, and on 21 December Thailand and Japan signed a military alliance with a secret protocol, wherein the Japanese government agreed to help Thailand regain lost territories. The Thai government declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom. The Free Thai Movement was launched both in Thailand and abroad to oppose the government and Japanese occupation.\n\nThe War was a Japanese victory as the Free Thai Movement was purged by Plaek Phibunsongkhram and the Japanese Loyalists. The King, Rama VIII was allowed to return to the throne. Rama VIII married Huang Zongying a Chinese girl who was his very age, but the marriage only lasted 12 days because Anti-Chinese Thai Nationalists assassinated Rama VIII and Zongying calling them traitors of the master state of Japan and Thai people. Bhumibol Adulyadej Mahndoli took the throne as the new king of Thailand 2 days after the funeral of his brother.\n\nThe New King reformed Japan into a new Pro-Japanese Monarchy with a Constitution in the style of Japan. Bhumibol Adulyadej then married Sirikit Kitiyakara, daughter of Nakkhatra Mangala, Prince of Chanthaburi II, the eldest son of Kitiyakara Voralaksana, Prince of Chanthaburi I and Princess Apsarasaman Kitiyakara who was the Ambassador of the now defunct Kingdom of Great Britain and the now defunct Republic of France. They have They have 4 children, Ubolratana (b, 1951), Maha Vajiralongkorn (b. 1952), Sirindhorn (b. 1955) and Chulabhorn (b. 1957).\n\nPlaek Phibunsongkhram had died in 1966 and he was replaced with his deputy Prem Tinsulanonda (b. 1920) who became the new Prime Minister of Thailand and the reception was met with uproar as the people demanded democracy. The rebellion was quelled but it was not enough to appease the Japanese who sent in troops to kill people and scare people into no longer committing any rebellions against their Puppet Regime.\n\nBhumibol's children had married later on in life. Ubolratana (b, 1951) had married Mamoru Shō (b. 1950), Vajiralongkorn (b. 1952) married Princess Yūko Higashikuni (b. 1954) and had one son named Hideyoshi Mahndoli (b. 1979), Sindhorn (b. 1955) married Norodom Sihamoni (b. 1953), Chulabhron (b. 1957) married Royal Thai Air Force officer Group Captain Virayudh Tishyasarin.\n\nJapan approved of the marriages of the heirs of Bhumibol and desired to educate the future Grandchildren of the King and keep Thailand pro-Japanese, knowing they ain't able to keep Thailand as a Puppet State any longer.\n\nIndependence[]\n\nThailand had gained independence in 1980 after a revolt that Japan could not put down. However Thailand remains a Pro-Japanese monarchy and an ally of Japan to this day.\n\nNotable Members[]\n\nHeads of State[]\n\nRama VIII/Ananda Mahidol\n\nRama IX/Bhumibol Adulyadej\n\nOrder of Succession[]\n\nChulalongkorn (Rama V) (b. 1853-1910) + 116 wives\n\nSaovabha Phongsri\n\nVajiravudh (Rama VI) (1881-1925) + Four wives\n\nSuvadhana\n\nPrincess Bejaratana Rajasuda (b. 1925)\n\nChakrabongse Bhuvanath, the Prince of Bishnulok (b. 1883-1920)\n\n(3) Chula Chakrabongse (b. 1908) + Princess Kan'in Hanako (b. 1909)\n\n(4) Kotohito Chakrabongse (b. 1952)\n\nPrajadhipok (Rama VII) (1893-1941) + Rambai Barni (b. 1904)\n\nSavang Vadhana\n\nMahidol Adulyadej (1892-1929) + Srinagarindra (b. 1900)\n\nGalyani Vadhana (b. 1923) + Colonel Aram Rattanakul Serireongrit (b. 1920)\n\nDhasanawalaya Sornsongkram (b. 1945) + Prince Tsuneharu Takeda (b. 1944)\n\nAnanda Mahidol (Rama VIII) (1925-1946) + Huang Zongying (1925-1946)\n\nBhumibol Adulyadej (b. 1927) + Sirikit Kitiyakara (b. 1932)\n\nPrincess Ubolratana (b, 1951) + Prince Mamoru Shō (b. 1950)\n\n(1) Vajiralongkorn (b. 1952) + Princess Yūko Higashikuni (b. 1954)\n\n(2) Hideyoshi Mahndoli (b. 1979)\n\nSindhorn (b. 1955) + Norodom Sihamoni (b. 1953)\n\nChulabhron (b. 1957) + Royal Thai Air Force officer Group Captain Virayudh Tishyasarin\n\nSaisavali Bhiromya, Princess Suddhasininat Piyamaharaj Padivaradda\n\nYugala Dighambara, Prince of Lopburi (b. 1882-1932) + Two Wives\n\nChalermkhetra Mangala\n\n(5) Prince Bhanubandhu Yugala (b. 1910) + Three wives\n\nPrincess Bandhusawali Yugala + Adulakit Kitiyakara (b. 1932)\n\n(6) Prince Thitibhan Yukol\n\n(7) Prince Rangsinopphadol\n\nPrincess Rangsinobhadol Yugala\n\n(8) Prince Bhanubandhu + Mom Boonlom\n\n(9) Prince Bhuribhan Yukol\n\n(10) Prince Navabarn Yugala\n\nPrincess Bhanuma Yugala\n\n(11) Prince Anusorn Mongkolkarn (b. 1915)\n\nChantara Charassri Yukol\n\nBhumree Bhirom Yukol\n\nMalinee Mongkol Yukol\n\nPattamana Rangsi Yukol\n\n(12) Prince Chatrichalerm Yukol\n\n(13) Prince Pattama Yukol\n\n(14) Prince Dechachalerm Yukol\n\n(15) Prince Mongkolvhai Yukol\n\nChulcherm Yugala\n\nNoppadol Chalermsri Yukol\n\nUam Bisalayabutra\n\nKitiyakara Voralaksana, Prince of Chanthaburi I (1874-1931) + 5 consorts\n\nMom Chao Absornsamarn Dhevakul\n\nPrince Amorn Samarnluksana Kitiyakara (1897-1968) + 2 wives, 3 sons and 3 daughters\n\nPrince Nakkhatra Mangkala Kitiyakara (1898-1953) + Bua Kitiyakara (b. 1909)\n\n(16) Mom Rajawongse Kalyanakit Kitiyakara (b. 1929) + Arun Snidvongs na Ayudhya\n\n(17) Phlaichumphon Kitiyakara\n\nSirina Chittalan\n\n(18) Mom Rajawongse Adulakit Kitiyakara\n\nMon Luang Soamsawali Kitiyakara (b. 1957), consort of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn\n\nPrincess Bajrakitiyabha (b. 1978)\n\nMom Luang Sarali Kitiyakara, (born April 8, 1966) + Thiradej Chirathiwat, has 2 sons\n\nThan Phu Ying Busba Kitiyakara Sathanapong (b. 1934) + Thawisan Ladawan (b. 1923)\n\nSuthawan Sathirathai (b. 1958) + Surakiart Sathirathai (b. 1958)\n\nDr. Santitarn Sathirathai\n\nWat\n\nPurachatra Jayakara, Prince of Kamphaengphet (b. 1881-1936) + 7 wives\n\nPrincess Prabhavasidhi Narumala\n\nPrincess Mayurachatra (1906-1970) + Mom Chao Sohbhana Bharadaya Savastivatana, has issue\n\n(19) Prince Prem Purachatra (b. 1915) + Ngamchitti Sarsas (b. 1915)\n\nThirachatra Purachatra\n\nMom Euam Chatrajaya na Ayudhya\n\n(20) Prince Dibyachatra Chatrajaya (b. 1934), married 3 wives, has issue\n\nTabtim Rojanatisha\n\n(21) Admiral Prince Vudhijaya Chalermlabh, Prince of Singha (b. 1883), married 2 wives\n\n(22) Prince Songvudhijaya Vudhijaya\n\n(23) Prince Udayachalermlabh Vudhijaya + Vimalachatra (b. 1921)\n\n(24) Mom Rajawongse Chalermchatra Vudhijaya (b. 1942)\n\n(25) Mon Luang Apichit Vudhijaya (b. 1969)\n\nMon Luang Atitra Vudhijaya (b. 1972)\n\nPrincess Suvabavabraobarn Vudhijaya\n\nPrincess To Vudhijaya\n\n(26) Prince Pho Vudhijaya\n\n(27) Prince Kraisingha Vudhijaya\n\nPrincess Vudhisavad Vudhijaya\n\nPrincess Vudhichalerm Vudhijaya\n\nPrincess Vudhividura Vudhijaya\n\nPrime Ministers[]\n\nPlaek Phibunsongkhram\n\nPrem Tinsulanonda\n\nMilitary Officers[]"
