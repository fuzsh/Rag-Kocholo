        "text": "BANGKOK'S Patpong red-light district is fast losing its appeal.\n\nIt used to be a tourist hot spot - a place where you could be shocked, and awed, as you wandered the parallel side streets in the area celebrated for its sex trade, found between Silom and Surawongse roads.\n\nThe strip joints and bars offering girlie shows flank the night market where you can buy a knock-off Gucci bag or a Polo shirt on your way home from watching one of the shows.\n\nAt one time this was all done with a sense of theatre. And a sense of fun. It was a \"must see\" part of the Bangkok culture for visitors to Thailand.\n\nBut it is definitely losing its lustre.\n\nI was in Patpong on the weekend and yes I did end up at one of those girlie bars after being dragged there on a hen's night.\n\nOK, dragged may be too strong a word - I admit I went along willingly in a group of five women and two guys.\n\nWhat we saw though was not \"fun\", it was not even bad theatre.\n\nThe undercurrent in the bar felt nasty, with the girls angrily demanding money after every show.\n\nIt was like we had been sucked into a freak show and we were now part of the performance.\n\nWe were all uncomfortable and the women on stage looked bored out of their minds.\n\nThere were more women guests in the bar than men, something that surprised me. Most people had one quick drink, and left.\n\nWe were approached seconds after we set foot on the pavement and asked if we wanted to go to the girlie bar.\n\nOur tour leader, a Bangkok veteran, negotiated the entry fee deal right there on the street before we entered the venue.\n\nThis, we later discovered, was essential if you didn't want to get ripped off.\n\nFor 300 baht (about $10) each we were allowed in, given front row seats and one beer each.\n\nThree young South African backpackers paid 2700 baht each for the same thing.\n\nThey entered the bar without negotiating a price first. As soon as they sat down, they were swamped by six bikini-clad women who hassled them for money. The young South African girls handed over the money out of fear, they felt they had no choice.\n\nIt was an expensive lesson to learn for travellers on a budget.\n\nThe plan was to spend an hour at the show but left after 25 minutes. The bride decided that she would actually rather look for a bargain at the night market.\n\nSadly, the vendors here were also nasty. The idea of markets, I thought, was to bargain.\n\nBut the prices were double that of other Bangkok markets and there was no sense of them wanting to bargain.\n\nIt is certainly not a shopper's paradise. The vendors just laughed when you offered a price.\n\nFor a tourist mecca there was not a lot of people around and nothing much was being bought and sold.\n\nThere was also little happening in the bars down Silom road.\n\nThey had one or two white males holding court with Thai girls pretending to hang on every word.\n\nBusiness was not booming.\n\nBangkok will always have Patpong.\n\nDespite what anyone thinks of the morals of a place like this, it will continue to exist.\n\nIt is a part of the fabric of the city.\n\nIts days of prospering however may be over.\n\nI would never go back.\n\nToday's Bangkok has so much more to offer tourists.\n\nPatpong is now an oddity rather than a attraction."
