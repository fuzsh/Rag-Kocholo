        "text": "Articles about Hua Hin\n\nRoyal heritage\n\nThere is more to the sleepy town of Cha-am than meets the eye. International golf courses and beaches aside - the elegant Mrigadayavan Palace and its surrounding mangrove nature trail has become increasingly popular among visitors.\n\nRead Full Article\n\nA royal love story\n\nApril 2024 marks the centenary of the birth of Phra Nang Chao Suvadhana Phra Vora Raja Devi, royal consort of King Vajiravudh, Rama VI.\n\nShe was born Tew Abhaiwongse on April 15, 1905. Her star was on the ascendant during a period of approximately one and a half years between April 1924, when King Vajiravudh made his first summer retreat to Mrigadayavan Palace in Hua Hin, and November 1925 when he passed away. It was their love for theatre and the arts that brought them together at the summer palace that is known as the Palace of Love and Hope.\n\nRead Full Article\n\nSummer court by the sea\n\nKing Chulalongkorn, Rama V, constructed Ban Puen Palace in Phetchaburi in the Western art deco style. King Vajiravudh had a palace built by Chao Samran beach in 1921, but when the flies from the nearby fishing community became too annoying, the king decided to uproot to a new location. Southern venues had been opened up due to the advent of the railway in 1896, and the Cha-am beachside area of Huay Sai offered the perfect solution, and Mrigadayavan Palace was built there. Klaikangwol Palace in Hua Hin was later built by King Prajadhipok.\n\nRead Full Article\n\nThe first coup and the last absolute king\n\n“On that morning, we heard about the coup at the golf course,” Queen Rambai Barni said, recalling the revolution that ended the Siamese Monarchy on June 24, 1932.\n\nAt the time, King Prajadhipok – ruler of Siam between 1925 and 1935, who also loved tennis and squash – was playing golf with the queen and his entourage at Hua Hin, where he spent his leisure time at Klai Kangwon Palace.\n\nRead Full News\n\nRoyal museum a towering draw\n\nKhao Wang or the Phra Nakhon Khiri royal palace atop a mountain in Phetchaburi province makes for a scenic stroll along its frangipani garden and stone paths. Built during the Ayutthaya period, it was the summer palace of King Rama IV which has now been turned into a museum.\n\nRead Full Article\n\nRoyal retreat top draw"
