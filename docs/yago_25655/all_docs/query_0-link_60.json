In his teens he developed and performed a stage hypnotism act and in 1882 formed a partnership with a local journalist, Douglas Blackburn, to work a telepathy act. This attracted the attention of the newly-formed Society for Psychical Research (SP), whose members, including Edmund Gurney and William Fletcher Barrett, tested Smithâs ability as a âsensitiveâ to thought-transference. They sought evidence of his ability to receive thoughts from Blackburn while blindfolded, his ears plugged with putty, a bolster case and a blanket over his head. Blackburn was shown drawings made by members of the Thought-Transference Committee, then entered the room and stood behind Smith, who made remarkably similar âreproductionsâ of the original drawings1.\n\nThe SPRâs committee was convinced and Smith became the private secretary to Edmund Gurney, the SPRâs honorary secretary. Gurney died in mysterious circumstances of a chloroform overdose in a bedroom at the Royal Albion Hotel, Brighton in June 1888. Although the coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, there has been speculation ever since that Gurney was murdered. Even Smith has been named, without foundation, as a possible suspect because of a claim that Gurney had discovered his thought-transference experiments to have been faked. In 1908 Douglas Blackburn admitted the fraud: âThe whole of these alleged experiments were bogus. They originated in the honest desire of two youths to show how easily men of scientific mind and training could be deceived when seeking for evidence in support of a theory they were wishing to establish.â This is a telling statement in the light of Smithâs recognition of filmâs ability to deceive the eye. Smith remained a member of the SPR throughout his life and never acknowledged the deception. In 1967 the BBC broadcast a television play, Edmund Gurney and the Brighton Mesmerist in its Theatre 625 strand, featuring Richard Todd as Edmund Gurney and Ray Brooks as Albert Smith.\n\nAround the time he left the employ of the SPR in 1888, Smith married Laura Eugenia Bayley in Ramsgate.They lived initially in Kent and briefly in London before moving to Hove. Here he leased of St Annâs Well Gardens in 1894, which he developed as a pleasure ground with an assortment of attractions. A 50-foot hot air balloon âmade its escapeâ on 24 August 1894 and was later sighted over London. The pump house that was used to dispense mineral waters later became the home of his âfilm factoryâ.\n\nHe also gave optical lantern shows (âdioramic lecturesâ) at such locations as Brighton Aquarium and Hastings Pier. By late 1896 he was concluding his performances with âanimated photographs of real lifeâ, including âMoving local pictures at each representationâ. He acquired a film camera from Alfred Darling in late 1896/early 1897; his surviving cashbook2 shows that he paid Â£16 for a âtakerâ (meaning a camera) on 6 January 1897. in the first year he shot 35 films, including coverage of Queen Victoriaâs diamond Jubilee procession. More importantly, he started to shoot comic sketches using techniques that developed filmâs unique qualities: the jump cut and running film backwards. in 1898 he used double exposure to add a vignette of a flashback or dream in The Corsican Brothers (possibly the first ever film adaptation from a literary source) and of parallel action in Santa Claus. The Kiss in the Tunnel (1899) developed editing technique by interpolating a scene inside a railway carriage into a âphantom rideâ film shot from the front of a train. A cutaway from an establishing shot to a close-up is a feature of As Seen Through a Telescope and is used several times in Grandmaâs Reading Glass (both 1900).\n\nIn parallel with his own filming activity he ran a film processing and printing business from 1898, servicing various clients including John Benett-Stanford, as well as Warwick Trading Company, run by Charles Urban, with whom his work became increasingly associated. Backed by Warwick, Smith built a small glasshouse studio in 1900 in the gardens and signed a two-year exclusive distribution contract with Warwick, under which he became the manager of its âBrighton Studio & Film Worksâ.\n\nHis films were also doing well in the USA: Vitagraph offered 29 of his titles by 1900. The peak of his inventiveness was probably Mary Janeâs Mishap, or Donât Fool with the Paraffin (1903), which displays an impressive array of editing devices and effects. However, this also proved to be something of a swansong, for in 1903 Urban persuaded Smith to take on a project to develop colour film. Urban had backed work already done by Edward R Turner, who had taken out a patent in 1899 but died suddenly in 1902, leaving the project unfinished. Urban bought the patent rights. Smith passed on the lease on St Annâs Well Gardens and moved to âlaboratory lodgeâ, his new home in Roman Crescent, Southwick.\n\nSmith filed a patent application on 24 November 1906 for âimprovements in & relating to Kinematograph Apparatus for the Production of Coloured Pictures'. Patent no 26,271 was granted in July 1907. However, it was not until 1 May 1908 that demonstrations of what became known as Kinemacolor were given. On 9 December Smith gave a lecture to the Royal Society of Arts on âAnimated photographs in natural coloursâ, as a result of which he was awarded the societyâs Silver Medal. The first commercial film made in Kinemacolor was, appropriately, Smithâs A Visit to the Seaside, shot in Brighton, which was trade-shown in September 1908. He sold his patent rights in March 1909 to Ada Jones, Urbanâs future second wife, for Â£5,000 and, with a five-year contract as a consultant to Urbanâs newly-formed Natural Colour Kinematograph Company (with a fee of Â£500 a year as a âtechnical advisorâ), started to turn out large numbers of Kinemacolor films: over 40 that year, 35 in 1910 and as many as 83 in 1911. He travelled widely to make these films.\n\nSmith and Urban attended the New York launch of Kinemacolor in December 1909 together but soon fell out, Urban believing that Smith had given valuable information about the colour system to William Friese Greene, Smith thinking Urban had paid him far too little for developing the system. They were reconciled only when Urban moved to Brighton in 1938.\n\nAfter Southwick, Smith lived in the Seven Dials area of Hove. They had a son and a daughter. Harold Norman Smith (1889-1975) was a âkinematographer in natural coloursâ in the 1911 census. Laura died in October 1938.
