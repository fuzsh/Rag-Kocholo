I have no Mouth But I must Scream,\n\nThis is a fantastic story, but it's also maybe the darkest piece of fiction I have ever read. I usually recommend people don't read it unless they have a lot of fortitude.\n\nI'd like to chirp in with the recommendation that you read some modern sci-fi books as well. Some people just prefer classics and that's fine, but if you're looking to get published today you ought to read what's being published today.\n\nI used to read only a handful of novels a year but when I got serious about writing I knew I was going to have to read more. So now I try to read about two novels a month. My goal is 20 novels for 2020. (Still, I know there are some people out there that read a hundred books a year. If you read 1 hour a day consistently throughout the whole year you could probably read about 50 books--Unless you throw Brandon Sanderson into the mix.)\n\nAnyway, what I've been doing is alternating between a book published in the last five or so years and a book published any time before that.\n\nSome of my favourites of the more modern I've read this year are:\n\nAgency by William Gibson\n\nStation Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel.\n\nA Memory Called Empire by Arkady Martine\n\nAnnihilation by Jeff VanderMeer - Actually, I'd say you should read the whole trilogy though the first is the best.\n\nAlso, the more you read the easier and faster it gets, like any skill.\n\nHi! Well, I have built my entire thematic and influence corpus (yes, I subscribe to what Harold Bloom says) based on the following authors. And beware, not all of them are sci-fi:\n\n1. Arturo Pérez-Reverte and the saga of Captain Alatriste. Historical novel.\n\nWhat did this author teach me? A clear example of how to have an MC in the first person but who becomes omniscient since he tells in retrospect the things that he did not witness or in which he did not participate directly. In particular, the novels El Sol de Breda and El Oro del Rey are very rich and useful to learn how to make descriptions that catch the reader and make him feel as if he were really walking through the old ports of Cadiz or Sevilla. The Sun of Breda makes you feel the misery of the Spanish thirds, but also the glory of their acts of valor. Highly recommended the movie Alatriste. The moment when, after so much desperation and hunger, Alatriste tells a badly injured colleague: \"Breda has surrendered\", unforgettable.\n\n2. The same Arturo Pérez-Reverte, but with Cabo Trafalgar. Also historical novel.\n\nThis book serves to wake one up as a writer in many ways:\n\nA. The almost vulgar nonchalance of the type of omniscient narrator that Pérez-Reverte uses to recreate the historic combat of Cape Trafalgar aboard the Antilla, a two 74-gun bridges that he invents for the novel. I don't really read yet another author who is more entertaining telling precisely something as tragic as a battle.\n\nB. The way this omniscient narrator allows multiple points of view to be used to address the feelings of different characters.\n\nC. The glory. Again. Something that Pérez-Reverte had already done superbly in El Sol de Breda now, in Cabo Trafalgar, makes it simply a masterpiece. Of all the books I have read, that last paragraph is the best, and also an epic ending, which draws tears.\n\n3. James Ellroy. Black novel.\n\nWhat did this author teach me? Brazen, above all brazen. Learn to swear and use street slang with style.\n\nSynthesis. Sometimes as raw as a shotgun blast to the head.\n\nDevelopment of the plot. How your various MCs manage to solve intricate police puzzles and mysteries.\n\n4. Dashiell Hammett. Police and black.\n\nThe author of the Maltese Falcon and one of the pioneers of social criticism that has made the crime novel constitute a genre apart from the police one that existed until then.\n\n5. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Sherlock Holmes. What can I tell you?\n\nElegance. Phlegm. The first rudiments of the detective method.\n\n6. Anthony Burgess. Earthly Powers. The Clockwork Orange.\n\nAlso elegance, but with a good dose of sarcasm. The case of The Clockwork Orange, very useful for portraying slang such as nadsat in a way that does not need side notes.\n\n7. Peter Benchley. Jaws.\n\nHandling suspense in the well-known Jaws saga. It catches you, you can read it in a day.\n\n8. Herbert Marcuse. Eros and Civilization. Philosophy.\n\nI personally think that a sci-fi writer must have a minimal ideological base in their stories. This isn't just about leather suits and blasters. I also recommend Nietzsche. Erich Fromm.\n\n9. Stephen King. Everything is Eventual. Terror.\n\nThe master. This particular book is very useful for brainstorming or learning about writing short stories.\n\nNow we start with the science fiction authors.\n\n10. Michel Houellebecq. The Elemental particles. Sci-fi speculation or prospective.\n\nSarcasm. And crying. Yes, crying. Not recommended for depressives. But a very tender, endearing story, behind an interesting theory.\n\n11. Dan Simmons. Hyperion. Endymion. Ilium. Olympus.\n\nAgain, why do I tell you? Another teacher. There you have daring, suspense, speculation and excitement all rolled into one.\n\nThey are long books, yes, but they give an orientation on how to order the paragraphs, how many pages the chapters should be, the handling of parallel arcs, etc.\n\n12. William Gibson. Neuromancer. Accelerated Monalisa. Among many others.\n\nImmortal. The genius of cyberpunk. Conceptual synthesis and dare.\n\n13. Alan Dean Anderson. Star Wars, a new hope.\n\nSafety pin. The novelized version of the film is far more raw, it describes to you what a blaster shot actually does to a human being, even if it is a stormtrooper. Still a great influence when it comes to describing action scenes.\n\n14. Donald F. Glutt. Star Wars, the empire strikes back.\n\nFollowing the trend set by Dean Anderson, in this other version of the novel F. Glutt pulls out of his hat a couple of scenes that do not appear on film that are simply glorious: the heroic sacrifice of a rebel pilot, for example.\n\n15. Frank Herbert and sons. The entire Dune series.\n\nAnother unmissable. Teacher. Unforgettable, considering the series is from the 60s, I think.\n\npersonally I’d ask why you don’t like to read and what mediums you do enjoy and why. Writing isn’t just about novels - there are so many forms and ways to approach a piece of work these days\n\nI really enjoy reading non-fiction like biographies, travel books, stuff like that. With novels... I don't know. I think I've just given up on Mockingbird. I just couldn't devote any more time reading about two kids from the deep south running around being kids. I'm sure the legal crux might have been worth persisting for but... I started 1984 last night but only got in 3 or 4 pages before I fell asleep. It was very good though. Straight away it had me doubting whether I should even bother trying to write when there was already something this good out there!\n\nIt's really just having the time. On the 3 evenings a week I write, then I am writing till about 11:30 and the last thing I want to do after that is read. The other evenings I have a drink and watch TV shows or movies. After that, I may or may not be in the mood.\n\nAnother major factor in my reluctance to read was to not be overly dissuaded to keep on going as a result of reading something in my target genre that was far better than I could ever come up with.\n\nIt's a bit of a conundrum.\n\nI really enjoy reading non-fiction like biographies, travel books, stuff like that.\n\nHi! I think it should work exactly the other way around. I mean, not that you arrogantly say \"I can do this much better\", but the feeling is close. I don't know, maybe my family is like that; for example, my grandfather was a policeman, a sergeant in a poncho and horse in the rain, one of those skinny old men with mustaches and two blunderbuss or shotguns clipped on the chair that later became a guard of presidential palace; or everything I know about weapons and martial arts was taught to me by my older brother, who was an Army officer; for example, sometimes we would watch a movie together and he would shake his head and say, \"no, that kind of explosive doesn't work like that.\" Worse when it was a science fiction movie: \"lasers are not seen in space,\" he said with a smile.\n\nPerhaps that is the main reason that I have never set a fighter fight in space and have based my entire saga on a planet where everything happens below and is even more old-fashioned. He was the one who introduced me to the first authors, Asimov, Bradbury, K. Dick. I guess now he must be smiling out there, somewhere, wherever he is. Also, he used to say that commandos only go to hell to find reinforcements and regroup. Militarys. They think so. So him often thought.\n\nBut I am getting off the thread. The point is that, based on what Harold Bloom says, it is not that we are in competition with the authors that we like or frustrate us because of their immense ability; but, whether we like it or not, in an unconscious way we will always want to overcome them; therefore, becoming aware of this process should free us from anguish and become it a creative engine. In any case, it is a desire for cultural exchange; not marketing like I said out there.\n\nAnd beware for travel books, are a detail that you don't have to ignore. In fact, much of what is in Burgess's Earthly Powers is basically a travel book in the guise of a novel. A great influence, going back to Harold Bloom, who now makes me notice those details every time my characters are in a new place so that I can convey them to the reader. Or Ali Bey's travels in Morocco, also half a travel book and novel.\n\nPerhaps, since you have a clearly more poetic and conceptual streak, as I mentioned in the Critics, William Gibson could be an author who could entertain you more and does not have such extensive books as a Peter Hamilton or a Simmons (they have easy 200K). But instead, Gibson can give you some very useful lessons on how you manage to convey a feeling or a color or an aroma to the reader with nothing more than two or three words. Amazing.\n\nNow if you want to get hit in the head, try The Nova Express by William S. Burroughs. You know, \"word falling, image falling\". That book is great; nobody usually understands it, until you realize that the narrator who tells the story is actually ... (I'm not going to spoil it, no way).\n\nRoger Zelazni: Creatures of Light and Darkness.\n\nAnother blow to the head. Enigmatic, lyrical, magnificent. To suit you, I think. Also another great conceptualizer; something is left spinning in a line you just read and you realize that the guy has just described a terrifying atomic explosion or so."
