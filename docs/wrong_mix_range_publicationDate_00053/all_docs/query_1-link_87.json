Check out the cover and the dedication of his album Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School.\n\nJANUARY 26\n\nNYC cartoonist and author Jules Feiffer born in 1929. His P.I. novel., Ackroyd (1977), is a real head-scratcher: an existential blowout that’s part-mind game and part-satire.

Although I don’t think she ever wrote a P.I. novel, her books of domestic suspense, starting with Where Are the Children? (1975), are among the best that genre ever produced (and in fact that book was an early favourite of mine, stoking my interest in the genre). A MWA Grand Master, she lent her name to the short-lived but sorely missed Mary Higgins Clark Mystery Magazine, and inspired many writers to follow her path, including her daughter Carol Higgins Clark and former daughter-in-law Mary Jane Clark.\n\nLaura Lippman, the author of some great standalones and the creator of Baltimore’s Tess Monaghan, one of the great private eyes of all time, born on this day in 1959, in Columbia, Maryland.\n\nNational Gorilla Suit Day\n\nOkay, you got me.

Sid Halley.\n\nFEBRUARY 18\n\nGahan Wilson, celebrated and much beloved American cartoonist, whose oddball magazine illustrations earned him such nicknames “the Michelangelo of the Macabre” and “the Wizard of Weird,” and whose Eddy Deco’s Last Caper is one of my all-time favourite P.I. lampoons, born on this day in 1930.\n\nFEBRUARY 19\n\nBirthday (1941) of Jersey boy Stephen Dobyns, poet and novelist, who wrote several books about Saratoga milkman/private eye Charlie Bradshaw.\n\nFEBRUARY 20\n\nChandler fetishists might consider this a Day of Infamy, but filmmaker Robert Altman was born this day in Kansas City, MO, He gave us M*AS*H, McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), Nashville (1975), The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993), and Gosford Park (2001), but around these parts he’s best remembered for giving us the still- hotly debated The Long Goodbye (1973), an audacious take on the Raymond Chandler novel starring Elliot Gould as Philip Marlowe which is either sublime or ridiciculous, depending on how tight your fedora is screwed on.\n\nFEBRUARY 22\n\nThe Thrilling Detective and The Girl Detective make it legal, 2003.\n\nEd Hoch, serial short story writer, with over 700 stories to his credit, and creator of such series heroes as New York State cop Captain Leopold, master thief Nick Velvet, crime-solving gypsy Michael Vlado, 2000-year old Simon Ark and my favourite, private eye Al Darlan, born in Rochester, New York in 1930.\n\nPeter Cheyney, an Englishman who learned to speak American, and gave us hard-boiled private eye Slim Callaghan and hard-boiled FBI agent turned eyeLemmy Caution, born in 1896.\n\nPhilip Kerr, creator of the acclaimed series of historical thrillers which follow hapless Berlin private eye Bernie Gunther as he gets kicked around by history before, during and after World War II, born on this day in Edinburgh in 1956. A sly mix of Chandleresque prose and LeCarre reach, the series remain a high-water mark in the genre.\n\nFEBRUARY 23\n\nDashiell Hammett stands his ground, testifying before Supreme Court in 1955. “Communism for me is not a dirty word.”\n\nFEBRUARY 26\n\nIn memory of writer Michael Avallone (who passed away on this day in 1999) and his greatest creation, it’s suggested that everyone grab a nooner.\n\nWisconsin writer August William Derleth, born on this day, 1909, creator of Solar Pons, arguably the world’s greatest Sherlock Homes pastiche.\n\nHugh Wiley, creator of Chinese private eye James Lee Wong, born in Zanesville, Ohio in 1884 on this date.

Turow’s never written a private detective novel, per se, but the well-rendered and colorful investigators in supporting roles in his novels suggest he could certainly whack one out of the park if he chose to.\n\nAPRIL 13\n\nBill Pronzini, author, critic, anthologist, editor and pulp collector, born in Petaluma, California in 1943. Although he’s written everything from westerns to some of the creepiest, nastiest noir imaginable, his greatest creation by far is the long running San Francisco private eye who shall remain Nameless.\n\nAPRIL 14\n\nPulpster and screenwriter Horace McCoy born in Pegram, Tennessee in 1897. One of the earliest contributors towhat would become known as the Black Mask style, he’s best known today for such nasty, hard-boiled classic as They Shoot Horses, Don’t They, No Pockets in a Shroud and Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye. He was also allegedly an uncredited script assistant on King Kong.\n\nAPRIL 15\n\nTV and film writer, editor and crime novelist Howard Browne born in 1908 in Omaha, Nebraska.

First celebrated in 1995.\n\nWorld Book Night, chosen due to the anniversary of Cervantes, death, as well as Shakespeare’s birth. First celebrated in 2011.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare. English writer, born on this date in 1564 (traditional accepted birth date, based on his April 26th baptism). To keep things neat, he also died on this day in 1616. Very considerate of him, really… But I still think Hamlet woulda made a great private eye story…. “When a man’s father is killed, he’s supposed to do something about it.”\n\nDirector, screenwriter, illustrator, editor, and detective novelist Satyajit Ray, creator of the much beloved Feluda, one of the world’s most popular private eyes, passed away on this day in 1992.\n\nAPRIL 24\n\n“B” is for Birthday.

He also wrote the noir classic Solomon’s Vineyard (1941), a standalone that somehow hit the sweet spot between Ross Macdonald’s Lew Archer AND Mickey Spillane’s Mike Hammer, years before anyone had heard of either of them.\n\nOCTOBER 28\n\nThe mojo of authorand martial arts instructor Joe R. Lansdale began working on this day in Gladewater, Texas. Sure, he’s written everything from shitkicker horror to Tarzan (and some genres which may not have been invented yet), but we love him for Hap and Leonard, Jim Bob Luke and for delivering plenty of, as he calls it, “private eye action… as we like it.”\n\nOCTOBER 29\n\nAuthor Fredric Brown was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His crazy-ass takes on sci-fi, fantasy and, of course, detective fiction, can still spin your head around. His The Fabulous Clipjoint (1947), which introduced P.I.s Ed and Am Hunter, is a must-read.\n\nLee Child, the creator of Tarzan-in-a-T-shirt Jack Reacher, born on this day in 1954 in Coventry, England and raised in nearby Birmingham.\n\nOCTOBER 31\n\nDick Francis born on this day in 1920 in Lawrenny, Pembrokeshire, Wales, UK.

A dramatist and short story writer, he created not one but two of the more interesting rivals to Sherlock Holmes: private detectives Martin Hewitt and “cheerfully unrepentant sociopath” Horace Dorrington. Morrison was very keen on social reform, and wasn’t shy about it–his vividly drawn depictions of the London slums of the Victorian era were proof enough of that.\n\nNOVEMBER 2\n\nAll Souls Day A day for the rest of us.\n\nTo celebrate my birthday, the Beta version of The Thrilling Detective Web Site goes live, 1997, at the urging of my good friend Peter from Liverpool. Only Rara-Avians knew of its existence, but somehow the word leaked out…\n\nNOVEMBER 3\n\nFrederick Nebel, one of the most hard-boiled of the hard-boiled detective writers, born this day in 1903. In his long career, he racked up over 300 stories and novels, but is best known for his pulp fiction, most notably tough guy private dicks “Tough Dick” Donahue and Cardigan and the Kennedy and McBride series, about a newsman and his police detective nemesis.\n\nNOVEMBER 9\n\nIn 2004, journalist and author Stieg Larsson, the author of the Millenium Trilogy, dies of a heart attack, Sweden. The first book in the trilogy, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, was published several months later, and quickly became a global phenomenon.\n\nNOVEMBER 10\n\nRobert A. Arthur, Jr., best known (at least to me) for creating the popular Alfred Hitchcock and The Three Investigators series of YA mysteries, born in Corregidor in the Philippines in 1909.\n\nDora Amy Elles born on this date in 1878 in India. She grew up to become British crime writer Patricia Wentworth, who wrote 32 bestselling novels featuring spinster private eye Miss Maud Silver, a detective so unworried about appearing “cozy” that she actually knits.\n\nNOVEMBER 13\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson born on this day in Edinburgh 1850. Mr. Hyde says he’s feelin’ alright, but Dr. Jekyll says he’s not feelin’ too good himself.\n\nNOVEMBER 14\n\nOn this day in 1980, the first National Book Award for Mystery (Hardcover) was given to John D. MacDonald, for his Travis McGee novel The Green Ripper. William F. Buckley won in the Paperback category for his novel Stained Glass. And then they eliminated the Mystery category.\n\nNOVEMBER 18\n\nAuthor and book designer Lee Thayer (born Emma Redington Lee) dies on this day in 1973, a few months short of her 100th birthday, leaving behind 60 mystery novels, all but one featuring the red-headed private detective Peter Clancy and his faithful valet, Wiggar.\n\nGeorge C. Chesbro, creator of the popular Mongo novels, about a dwarf private eye whose cases frequently wander into the occult, dies on this date in 2008.\n\nNOVEMBER 21\n\nGahan Wilson, celebrated and much beloved American cartoonist, whose oddball magazine illustrations earned him such nicknames “the Michelangelo of the Macabre” and “the Wizard of Weird,” and whose Eddy Deco’s Last Caper is one of my all-time favourite P.I. lampoons, passed away at the age of 89 on this day in 2019.\n\nNOVEMBER 25\n\nOut of the Past, what many consider the ultimate film noir, is released on this day in 1947.

Thousands of cops and fans scoured the country for her, and Arthur Conan Doyle even hired a medium to help locate her–all to no avail. And then she reappeared, safe and sound, eleven days later, offering no explanation. To this day, nobody knows exactly why she took a powder. Maybe somebody should have hired The Continental Op or someone? This sounds like a dynamite premise for a book. Max?\n\nDECEMBER 4\n\nCrime writer Cornell Woolrich was born on this day in 1903.\n\nDECEMBER 5\n\nCrime writer James Lee Burke, famed for his Dave Robicheaux series, was born in Houston, Texas, in 1936.\n\nDECEMBER 7\n\nLeigh Brackett, beloved writer of space operas and crime novels, but best known for her Hollywood screenplays, most notably The Big Sleep (1945), Rio Bravo (1959), The Long Goodbye (1973) and the first draft of The Empire Strikes Back (1980), born in 1915. Her P.I. novel, No Good From a Corpse (1944), is a gotta-read classic.\n\nGravel-voiced, noir-leaning troubadour and ace performer Tom Waits, a man who can turn out phrases worthy of Chandler himself, is born in Pomona, California, in 1949. Anyone who can toss out something like “The eggs chased the bacon/’Round the frying pan” ought to be included here.\n\nDECEMBER 8\n\nLeigh Brackett was born on this day in 1915 in Los Angeles. Known primarily for her sci-fi and fantasy fiction, she became known as “The Queen of Space Opera,” but she also penned the P.I. classic No Good from a Corpse, and co-wrote the screenplays for a couple of stone-cold private eye classic Chandler adaptations, The Big Sleep (1946) and The Long Goodbye (1973), as well as the best Star Wars flick of them all, The Empire Strikes Back (1980).\n\nHillary Waugh passed away on this day in 2008, in Conneticut, the setting for many of his mysteries. He was best known for his police procedurals, perhaps, but all of his work, including those featuring private eyes such as Philip Macadam, Sheridan Wesley and Simon Kaye, drew praise for the way they used real police techniques to solve crimes.\n\nDECEMBER 9\n\nHanns Gustav Adolf Gross, often considered the “Father of Modern Criminology,” passed away on this day in Graz, Austria, in 1915.\n\nDECEMBER 10\n\nDorothy Porter, Australian poet, passed away on this day in 2008 of breast cancer. She gave us one of the best lesbian P.I. novels of all time, The Monkey’s Mask (1995). In verse form, no less. It was subsequently made into a pretty good P.I. film as well, starring Susie Poter and Kelly McGinnis.\n\nDamon Runyon died, 1946.\n\nDECEMBER 12\n\nHanns Gustav Adolf Gross, often considered the “Father of Modern Criminology,” born on this day in Graz, Austria, in 1847.

Although born in the States, he grew up in Kitchener, Ontario. He and his wife, fellow crime writer Margaret Millar, eventually settled in Santa Barbara, California, better known to his zillions of fans as “Santa Theresa.”\n\nDECEMBER 16\n\nShane Black, the writer-director behind such rock ‘em sock ‘em P.I. flicks as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Long Kiss Goodnight, The Last Boy Scout and The Nice Guys, was born on this day in 1961 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also did some stuff like Lethal Weapon and Iron Man 3, but don’t hold that against him.\n\nDECEMBER 17\n\nWriter and director Rian Johnson (Brick, Knives Out, Poker Face, etc.) was born on this day in 1973 in Silver Spring, Maryland.\n\nDECEMBER 20\n\nSydney Greenstreet, who got to play one of the all-time great villains in detective fiction, was born on this day In 1879 in Eastry, Kent, England\n\nDECEMBER 21\n\nJim French, creator of The Adventures of Harry Nile, the longest running private detective audio series in the history of American broadcasting (it’s still running!), passed away on this day in 2017.\n\nDECEMBER 24\n\nOne mystery’s most beloved and bestselling authors, Mary Higgins Clark, was born on this day in 1927, at the age of 92. Although I don’t think she ever wrote a P.I. novel, her books of domestic suspense, starting with Where Are the Children? (1975), are among the best that genre ever produced (and in fact that book was a fondly remembered early favourite of mine, stoking my interest in the genre). A MWA Grand Master, she lent her name to the short-lived but sorely missed Mary Higgins Clark Mystery Magazine, and inspired many writers to follow her path, including her daughter Carol Higgins Clark and former daughter-in-law Mary Jane Clark.\n\nDECEMBER 25\n\nAmerican film and theater actor Humphrey Bogart born on this day in 1899. He became a cultural icon for his definitive tough guy roles in such classic films as High Sierra, Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon (Sam Spade!) and The Big Sleep (Philip Marlowe!). In 1999, the American Film Institute selected him as the greatest male star of classic American cinema.\n\nDECEMBER 26\n\nCharacter actor Elisha Cook, Jr. born on this date in 1903. He made a career out of playing cowardly villains and mousy headcases in dozens of crime movies and films noir, and is probably best known for his portrayal of the “gunsel” Wilmer in John Huston’s 1941 adaptation of The Maltese Falcon.\n\nDECEMBER 27\n\nAndrew Vachss, American crime fiction author, child protection consultant, and attorney devoted to representing children and youths, and creator of the New York man-for-hire Burke, a man almost as relentless as his creator in his pursuit of those who would abuses others, passed away on this day in 2021.\n\nDECEMBER 28\n\nStan Lee born on this day in 1922. ’nuff said!\n\nThe Deep-Blue Goodbye?
