        "text": "Burroughs, William S.\n\nThe Job\n\nISBN: 0714540285\n\nLondon, England: John Calder (Publishers) Limited, 1984. First UK Edition Thus. Softcover. \"From a well-argued attack on those who wish to over protect our privacy and sense of shame, to a remarkable series of interviews with Daniel Odier, and a consideration of the ways in which information is transmitted and received in different cultures of the past and in our own increasingly robotized world, The Job reveals the mind of William Burroughs in many different lights. Above all it shows the questing intelligence of a literary scientist to whom no aspect of the human condition is less than fascinating, who understands the revolution that has taken place in communications and the control of the individual by technology as well as any other...writer. Utter frankness and honesty about his methods, researches and preoccupations are the Burroughs hallmark so that every reader, in addition to discovering more vintage imaginative work, will find much to provoke and inform him about literature, the world we inhabit and Mr. Burroughs himself.\" (from back cover) A volume of interviews with William S. Burroughs, Founding Father of the Beat Generation & among the most brilliant, influential literary & cultural figures of all time; conducted by Daniel Odier & including other miscellaneous writings inserted as answers to some of Odier's inquiries (as explained by WSB in his Author's Foreword, pg. 23). First published in France in the French language in 1969 (see our item No. 2039), followed by many various editions issued in Britain, the USA & elsewhere. This copy is a British trade-format softcover original first edition thus published in 1984. With a most Burroughsian front cover illustration by Thomi Wroblewski reproduced on front cover. Shoaf, Section I, 18(f), pg. 34; Schottlaender, H9(F), pg. 144. An essentially collectible version of the profoundly prescient WSB classic- now more relevant than ever. In fine condition with mild rubbing & sunning/ browning to laminated front, back covers & spine; very light wear & a few tiny bumps at edges & corners of same; one mild vertical crease across front cover near right edge (not significantly effecting image or text); mild rubbing & spotting to edges of text block; one thin, faint streak across width of lower edge of same near right corner. Interior very fine with only very small, faint creases & tiny bumps at esp. upper corners of some page leaves. Fine. [Item #4304]"
