        "text": "1. David Antin (1932–2016) [22 April 1965]\n\nEleanor Antin’s first subject was her husband David, the poet, translator, editor of the poetry journal Some/thing, and prominent art critic. The two met at the City College of New York (he graduated in 1955, she in 1958) and they married in December 1960. From 1959 David published extensively in the little magazines and mimeographed journals that shaped the 1960s scene, and performed his poetry in New York and internationally. His book of poetry Definitions was published as a chapbook (a small pamphlet) by Clayton Eshleman’s (75) Caterpillar Press in 1967. By 1965, when Eleanor started Blood of a Poet Box, David had also made his name as an art critic, writing routinely for Kulchur magazine, among others, on the work of artists such as Andy Warhol, Alex Katz, Robert Morris, Sol LeWitt and Carl Andre.\n\n2. Diane Wakoski (born 1937) [22 April 1965]\n\nFollowing her arrival in New York from California in 1960, Wakoski became involved in the East Side Scene, though she was also associated with the Beat movement. Her first collection of poetry, Coins and Coffins, was published by Hawk’s Well Press, which had been founded by Jerome Rothenberg (4), Diane Rothenberg and David Antin (1). In 1965, inspired by Eleanor Antin’s Blood of a Poet Box, Waskoski wrote ‘A Long Poem for Eleanor Who Collects the Blood of Poets’. Her work was included in Allen De Loach’s volume The East Side Scene (An Anthology of a Time and a Place) and Paul Carroll’s The Young American Poets, both published in 1968. Wakoski was married to Shepard Sherbell (51) from 1965 to 1967.\n\n3. Wesley Day (born 1935) [22 April 1965]\n\nPoet and friend of Diane Wakoski (2). His book of poems, On To Me Now, was published in 1959. In 1969 Day was included in the anthology In a Time of Revolution: Poems from our Third World, edited by Walter Lowenfels (59).\n\n4. Jerome Rothenberg (born 1931) [2 May 1965]\n\nPoet, editor, anthologist and translator of German poetry. Rothenberg met David Antin (1) at the City College of New York in the late 1940s, and Eleanor just a few years later. Rothenberg and David Antin collaborated on several writing and translation projects and in 1959 the two co-founded Hawk’s Well Press with David Witt. Under that imprint, Rothenberg published the early work of Armand Schwerner (27) and Rochelle Owens (8), as well as his own first book White Sun Black Sun (1960). He edited the journal Poems from the Floating World (1959–63), and in 1965 co-founded the journal Some/thing with David Antin.\n\n5. Durward Collins [Jr] (born 1937) [15 June 1965]\n\nAfrican American poet who won the Hopwood Prize for Poetry at the University of Michigan in 1959.

Allen Katzman (died 1985) [27 June 1965]\n\nPoet (often publishing as Allan Katzman) and founder in October 1965 of the East Village Other, which published monthly, then fortnightly, then weekly. Katzman also ran open readings at various East Village coffeehouses, including Les Deux Mégots and Café Le Metro.\n\n7. George Economou (born 1934) [27 June 1965]\n\nPoet, translator, founding editor of the Chelsea Review (1957–60) and co-founder with Robert Kelly of the poetry magazine Trobar (1960–4), which published work by David Antin (1), Jerome Rothenberg (4), Clayton Eshleman (75), Frank Kuenstler (18) and others. From 1962 Economou was married to Rochelle Owens (8), whose name appears next in Antin’s Blood of a Poet Box.\n\n8. Rochelle Owens (born 1936) [27 June 1965]\n\nA poet and playwright, Owens was a regular contributor to the St Mark’s Poetry Project and Les Deux Mégots, and a key figure in New York’s off-off-Broadway theatre movement. In the mid-1960s her plays premiered at Judson Poets’ Theater and Café La Mama, among other venues, and her poetry was published in Trobar and Kulchur, and by Black Sparrow Press. Owens appears in both Blood of a Poet Box and Antin’s Portraits of Eight New York Women 1970. From 1962 she was married to George Economou (7).\n\n9. Leonard [Lenny] Neufeld [27 June 1965]\n\nWhile still a student at Brooklyn College, Neufeld co-edited (with peers Harry Lewis (19) and Robert Shatkin) the one-off poetry journal Pogamoggan. They were encouraged by the poet Jerome Rothenberg (4). Neufeld’s wife, the artist Martha Rosler, served as the publication’s art editor. He and Rosler left New York for California in 1968.\n\n10. David Ignatow (1914–1997) [27 June 1965]\n\nWhen Eleanor Antin approached Ignatow to participate in Blood of a Poet Box, he had already published several books of poetry, including Poems (1948), The Gentle Weightlifter (1955), Say Pardon (1962) and Figures of the Human (1964), although the latter was the first that garnered significant critical praise. Inspired by William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane and Walt Whitman, Ignatow was known for his treatment of subjects drawn from ordinary life and for his economy of language. He also had a significant career as an editor, including as associate editor for American Scene magazine (1935–7), co-editor for Beloit Poetry Journal (1949–59), poetry editor for the Nation (1962–3) and consulting editor for Chelsea magazine (1969–71).\n\n11. Mary [E.] Mayo [27 June 1965]\n\nMayo performed her poetry regularly at Les Deux Mégots and was also associated with the Tenth Street Coffee House group along with Diane Wakoski (2). Her poems appeared in Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts, among other publications.\n\n12. Gail [Baugher] Kuenstler [27 June 1965]\n\nWriter and visual artist, married to Frank Kuenstler (18). Her writing was published in the Eventorium Muse, and her artwork appeared on the journal’s cover. In 1972 excerpts from ‘The Journal of Gail Kuenstler’ were broadcast by the listener-sponsored New York radio station WBAI (Pacifica Radio) as part of The Diary Series, which was dedicated to women’s writing.\n\n13. Susan Sherman (born 1939) [27 June 1965]\n\nPoet, playwright, community activist and founder in 1965 of IKON, a multicultural magazine of poetry and visual art, which published work by Yvonne Rainer (42), Margaret Randall (22), Anselm Hollo (58) and Ishmael Reed (76), among others. Sherman’s first book, Areas of Silence, was published in 1963 by Hespiridian Press and Hardware Poets Theater. The latter also premiered Sherman’s plays. Her poems appeared in the Nation, El Corno Emplumado/The Plumed Horn and the Judson Review.\n\n14. Paul Blackburn (1926–1971) [27 June 1965]\n\nPoet and translator of Spanish literature and poetry. Several of his poems were published in Black Mountain Review, via which Blackburn became associated with the Black Mountain Poets, and he was included in Donald Allen’s 1960 anthology The New American Poetry, 1945–1960. In many ways, Blackburn epitomises the cultural networks that are embodied in Antin’s Blood of a Poet Box: he was a central figure in New York’s Lower East Side poetry scene, organising important readings at Café Le Metro, Les Deux Mégots, Max’s Kansas City, and the St Mark’s Poetry Project, which he had helped to establish. He made extensive recordings of the poetry scene, which are housed in his archive at the University of California, San Diego. In 1964–5, Blackburn hosted his own radio show, ‘Contemporary Poetry’, on New York station WBAI, which introduced listeners to the scene via readings, conversations and interviews with key contemporary poets.\n\n15. David Franks (1948–2010) [27 June 1965]\n\nBaltimore-based poet, writer, artist and editor of Magazine, a poetry journal published in the East Village in six issues between 1965 and 1967, each jacketed in contemporaneous pages of the New York Times. It featured, among other poets and artists, the work of Diane Wakoski (2), Wesley Day (3), Paul Blackburn (14), Ed Sanders (87) and Franks himself.\n\n16. Jackson Mac Low (1922–2004) [27 June 1965]\n\nPoet, composer and artist associated with the Fluxus group. In 1963 he co-published, with La Monte Young, the Anthology of Chance Operations, and from 1964 he participated in the Annual Festivals of the Avant-Garde in New York. Mac Low published several books of poems throughout the 1960s.\n\n17. Seymour Faust (1924?–2017?) [27 June 1965]\n\nFaust knew David Antin (1) when he was at the City College of New York, and his book The Lovely Quarry was published by Jerome Rothenberg (4) and David Antin’s Hawk’s Well Press in 1958. His poems also appeared in Trobar, Origin and other poetry journals.\n\n18. Frank Kuenstler (1928–1996) [no label affixed to the slide]\n\nPoet, assemblage artist and filmmaker, married to Gail Kuenstler (12). He taught at the School of Visual Arts in New York, edited the little magazines Bread& and Airplane, and was a founding member of The Eventorium, an arts collective on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, in whose quarterly journal, the Eventorium Muse, Kuenstler’s poetry was first published in 1964. Kuenstler’s first book LENS was published by Film Culture the same year.\n\n19. Harry Lewis (1901–1985) [27 June 1965]\n\nProbably a reference to the American communist poet Harold Harwell [H.H.] Lewis, who came to prominence in the 1930s with writing that focused on the plight of ordinary farmers and sharecroppers. Lewis was a friend of William Carlos Williams.\n\n20. Harvey Bialy (born 1945) [2? August 1965]\n\nPoet and biochemist: he studied the former at Bard College under Robert Kelley, and the latter at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n21. George Oppen (1908–1984) [26 September 1965]\n\nIn Paris in the 1920s, Oppen worked as a poetry editor, publishing work by William Carlos Williams and Ezra Pound, among others. On returning to the United States in 1932, he co-founded The Objectivist Press, with which he published his first book, Discrete Series, in 1934. The press closed shortly afterwards, and Oppen would not write poetry again until the late 1950s. Instead he turned to communist politics and was forced to flee to Mexico in 1950 when investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Two books marked his re-entry into poetry: The Materials (1962) and This in Which (1965), both published by New Directions. Of Being Numerous (1968) won him the Pulitzer Prize.\n\n22. Margaret Randall (born 1936) [14 October 1965]\n\nPoet, translator and co-founder (with her husband Sergio Mondragón (23) and Harvey Wolin) of the bilingual Spanish/English quarterly poetry journal El Corno Emplumado/The Plumed Horn. This was published from Mexico City and ran from 1962 to 1969, publishing the work of US and Latin American authors. It is likely that Randall first came into contact with David Antin (1) when he submitted his poetry for consideration in 1963. Randall also published work by Paul Blackburn (14), Harvey Bialy (20) and Clayton Eshleman (75). The journal was forced to close on account of its support of Mexico’s 1968 Student Movement, as a result of which Randall herself was forced underground in mid-1969.\n\n23. Sergio Mondragón (born 1935) [14 October 1965]\n\nMexican poet associated with the Beat movement and co-founder with Margaret Randall (22) of the bilingual Spanish/English quarterly poetry journal El Corno Emplumado/The Plumed Horn. Early publications include Yo soy el otro (1964) and the anthology Poesía en movimiento: México 1915–1966 (1966). Mondragón’s strident editorial on the violent repression of the student movement in Mexico City appeared in El Corno Emplumado in October 1968, which also featured George Cohen’s photographs of the 1967 Pentagon protests in the US. Mondragón’s support of the Mexican student movement precipitated his departure to the United States shortly afterwards.\n\n24. Allen Planz (1937–2010) [14 October 1965]\n\nPoet, fisherman and poetry editor at the Nation from 1969 to 1973. His book A Night for Rioting was published in 1969, and Wildcraft appeared in 1975.\n\n25. Hannah Weiner (1928–1997) [14 October 1965]\n\nPoet whose visual approach to language positioned her at the centre of the confluence of poetry, performance and art in 1960s New York, where she organised poetry events at Max’s Kansas City, among other venues. In 1969, with Les Levine, Eduardo Costa and John Perreault, she organised The Fashion Show Poetry Event, a collaboration between poets and artists held at the Center for Inter-American Relations on Park Avenue. The following year, she invited an audience to observe her at work designing ladies’ underwear, in a performance entitled Hannah Weiner at Her Job. In the 1970s she began writing clairvoyance or ‘clair-style’ journalistic poetry that reproduced the hallucinated words she saw written on her body, face, clothing and the walls around her. Weiner is one of the subjects of Antin’s later series Portraits of Eight New York Women 1970.\n\n26. George Dowden (born 1933) [14 October 1965]\n\nPoet whose book Flight from America was published by Mandarin Books in 1954. In 1966 he wrote the book-length poem Renew Jerusalem, inspired by William Blake along with Dr Timothy Leary, Allen Ginsberg (61), Bob Dylan, Ed Sanders (87) and Michael McClure. It was published by Smyrna Press, New York, in 1969.

In 1965 her writing appeared in Some/thing, edited by David Antin (1) and Jerome Rothenberg (4), with whose poetry Schneemann herself identified correspondences. In her 1972 artist’s book Parts of a Body House Book, Schneemann would list both Eleanor and David Antin as among those ‘poets who understood best first what I made’.\n\n42.

Among many other things, he organised an event at which Allen Ginsberg’s (61) Howl was recited in numerous languages simultaneously while Brodey directed proceedings in a red plastic raincoat.\n\n55. David Shapiro (born 1947) [11 March 1966]\n\nViolinist, writer and poet whose first collection of poems, January, was published in 1965, when Shapiro was just eighteen.

Sotère Torregian (born 1941) [11 March 1966]\n\nAt the time of Antin’s project, Torregian was mostly associated with the New York School of poets, though he also self-identified as a surrealist. He frequented Café Le Metro, where he attended readings with Paul Blackburn (14), Joseph Ceravolo (52) and David Shapiro (55), the latter two of whom donated blood to Antin on the same occasion as Torregian. He published his poems in Art and Literature, Paris Review and C, the magazine edited by Ted Berrigan (53). Torregian taught at the experimental Free University of New York and at Stanford University, where he helped establish the African American studies programme in 1969.\n\n57.

It was manifested in black ink on white paper, published as an offset edition, and was also the source of what Mac Low described as a ‘verbal musical performance’.\n\n68. Allan Kaprow (1927–2006) [15 April 1966]\n\nA leading proponent of the happenings movement that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Kaprow’s environments and happenings were staged at several venues in New York, including the Judson Gallery, Reuben Gallery and Smolin Gallery.

Sanders was founder of the mimeographed little magazine Fuck You: A Magazine of the Arts, which published thirteen issues at irregular intervals between 1962 and 1965, when Sanders was arrested for obscenity and the journal ceased publication. Sanders has described his editorial approach as favouring ‘joyful, satirical, freaky, and politically sensitive writing’. Indeed, he seemed to court controversy, with volumes produced under the associated Fuck You Press imprint including Bugger: An Anthology (1964), Despair: Poems to Come Down By (1964) and Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s (90) To Fuck Is To Love Again (1965), and Sanders’s own volume Fuck God in the Ass (1967). Sanders was also founder and owner of the Peace Eye Bookstore, which he opened in a former Kosher meat store at 383 East 10th Street in 1964. It became an important venue for poets, writers, artists and the alternative press, and also hosted art shows. In the same year, Sanders co-founded the avant-garde musical group The Fugs with Tuli Kupferberg (47). On 1 January 1966, the Peace Eye Bookstore was raided by police, who again charged Sanders with obscenity, charges against which he was defended by the American Civil Liberties Union. The notoriety that the case brought led to his appearance on the cover of the 17 February 1967 issue of Life magazine, which proclaimed him ‘a leader of New York’s Other Culture’.\n\n88. A.B. [Alfred Bennett] Spellman [Jr] (born 1935) [14 January 1967]\n\nPoet and music critic. His first book of poems, The Beautiful Days, was published in 1965, and his seminal history of African American music, Four Lives in the Bebop Business, appeared in 1966. Much of his work fuses poetry, music and black culture, as in the poem ‘Did John’s Music Kill Him?’ (1969), an elegy to the jazz saxophonist John Coltrane. Spellman was closely involved with the black arts movement alongside his former classmate Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), and undertook a national tour of historically black colleges with other African American poets in 1967.

Barbara Guest (1920–2006) [27 January 1967]\n\nIn the 1950s Guest worked for the magazine ARTnews, but she came to be known as part of the first generation of the New York School poets, to whom she was introduced by the artist Tony Smith (indeed, she is the only woman poet usually included in this group). Her first collection of poems, The Location of Things, was published in 1960, and in the same year she was included in Donald Allen’s The New American Poetry, 1945–1960.\n\n90. Lawrence Ferlinghetti (born 1919) [27 January 1967]\n\nPoet and founder in 1953 of City Lights booksellers and press in San Francisco.

Robert David Cohen (born 1945) [24 March 1967]\n\nActive in the New York poetry scene of the 1960s, Cohen was also a performer in the New York version of Carolee Schneemann’s (41) Meat Joy in 1964. He moved to Mexico near the end of that decade, and married Margaret Randall (22), with whom he co-edited the bilingual journal El Corno Emplumado/The Plumed Horn between 1968 and 1969.\n\n92. Joanne Kyger (1934–2017) [13 May 1967]\n\nKyger was associated with the Beat and San Francisco Renaissance poets in California, including Robert Duncan, Jack Spicer and Gary Snyder. Despite this, she resisted these labels and also had social links to and stylistic affinities with other groupings, including the second generation of the New York School. Her first book, The Tapestry and the Web, was published in 1965. Antin’s work on Blood of a Poet Box coincided with the brief period in which Kyger lived in New York in 1966–7.\n\n93. Leandro Katz (born 1938) [1 July 1967]\n\nAn Argentine-born artist and writer, Katz moved to New York in 1965. From 1976 he was also a prolific maker of experimental films.\n\n94. Tony Weinberger [4 February 1967]\n\nPoet who produced the slender publication Neon Orbit in 1960. This was intended as an offshoot of the journal Neon, although the latter folded shortly after.\n\n95. George Quasha (born 1942) [11 February 1968]\n\nPoet, writer and editor of Stony Brook Magazine, in which both Eleanor Antin and David Antin (1) published work.

Mike Heller (born 1937) [11 February 1968]\n\nPoet, critic and essayist who, though living in Spain during the early 1960s, was nonetheless involved in the New York poetry scene during that decade. Heller was particularly interested in the Objectivist poets, and would write a series of essays on George Oppen (21). Heller wrote poetry as well as criticism, and his book Accidental Center was published in 1972.\n\n97. Hugh Seidman (born 1940) [11 February 1968]\n\nPoet whose first book, Collecting Evidence, was published by Yale University Press in 1970, winning the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition.\n\n98. W.S. [William Stanley] Merwin (born 1927) [11 February 1968]\n\nPoet and prolific translator. His first poetry collection, A Mask for Janus, was published in 1952, and he published several more books throughout the 1950s and 1960s, when his work expressed opposition to the American Vietnam War, most notably in The Lice (1967). From 1962 Merwin was poetry editor at the Nation. He moved to New York in 1968, and it is likely that Antin drew his blood just afterwards.\n\n99. Howard Loeb [‘Howie’] Schulman [25 July 1967]\n\nPoet and activist, member of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in New York, and editor of the political poetry journal Pa’lante: Poetry Polity Prose of a New World, published by the League of Militant Poets in 1962. His connections with Cuba and perceived support of Fidel Castro drew attention from the FBI from 1961, and in 1963 Schulman was arrested in Morocco in connection with the murder of President John F. Kennedy, though this proved unfounded. Although housed in the box’s penultimate slot, the date indicates that this sample was taken earlier, so that it should have been placed 95th."
