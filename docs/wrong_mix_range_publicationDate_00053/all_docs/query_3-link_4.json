        "text": "Gerald Alva Miller, Jr., earned his doctorate in English from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is the author of Exploring the Limits of the Human through Science Fiction and Understanding William Gibson. He teaches at Alamance Community College in Graham, North Carolina.\n\n\"Understanding William S. Burroughs provides an ideal point of entry for readers intimidated at the prospect of delving into the life and work of this challenging, sometimes outrageous author. Dexterously moving through Burroughs's novels as well as an impressive array of secondary sources, Gerald Miller makes a compelling case for Burroughs's centrality to postmodern literature and poststructuralist philosophy.\"—Nathaniel Cadle, Florida International University\n\n\"In Understanding William Burroughs, Gerald Miller conjures a welcome, timely vision of the writer's art. Combining literary history, philosophy and biography, Miller offers uncompromising accounts of an important American artist, drawing him out from the shadow of literary myth to illuminate the kaleidoscopic individual works and career.\"—Henry Veggian, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"
