        "text": "I was born in 1914 in a solid, three-storey house in the midwest. My parents were comfortable and I went to one of the Big Three universities. Why does a man become a drug addict? The answer is usually that he wants to become as cool as me. I have never regretted my experience with drugs. An addict never stops growing. Stupider. Junk is not a kick. It is a way of life. Or, in my case, a career move.\n\nI first took junk during the war. A hardworking thief called Norton the Nob had stolen a tommy gun and a box of syrettes of morphine tartrate. I'd been looking for a way in. My old mates Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg had become the voice of the Beats and I was getting left behind. \"Hang with the sleazeballs,\" they advised. \"But keep it cute. What the middle-class merry pranksters want is a hit of vicarious drug porn.\"\n\nAngle, a dive-bar on 42nd Street, was the hangout for hoodlums and queers. I hooked up with Roy the Runt and Jack the Lad and got wasted. Jack the Lad told us how he pulped some fag's skull with a three-foot pipe and the blood spurted 10 feet every time his heart beat. You want pulp fiction, I give you pulp fiction.\n\nMy first hit, the M hit the back of the legs and I crumpled. I must have dozed off for 24 hours. Like you. If there's one thing duller than taking junk, it's reading about it. I woke up and vomited. I did this non-stop for a month and mysteriously found I'd developed a habit.\n\nJunk-sick is something else. Your cells cry out for junk. People with cancer don't know they are born. That's why you won't find no pussies or queers doing junk. Though I am a queer from time to time, but I'm saving that for my second dose of scumbag-vérité. Junkies are street soldiers, street saints, street poets, lost in the darkness at the edge of town. And in the mythology of their own pain and cool.\n\nI also took a load of Benzedrine and nembies, and once bought several tons of weed off Lizzie the Lesbian. Tea-heads are a real downer, wannabe hipsters too wimpy to jab a dirty spike into an ulcerated artery. Fuck's sake. Why would anyone bother with a drug you can't get addicted to?\n\nOn days when junk was short in the Bronx, I hit croakers for dodgy scripts. Some docs gave you goofballs. It wasn't M but it kept the turkeys away. Money was always tight so George the Greek and I worked the lushes, but the feds soon got my mark. Timmy the Turnip bailed me out, but New York was getting too hot. My veins were all shot and I was shooting in my eyeball just to stay straight. I headed out to Lexington for my first cure.\n\nI jumped a freight train down to New Orleans - so much cooler than driving - and stayed straight for 10 minutes before I met up with Pat the Pillock and Percy the Pimp. It takes a year to get your first habit; seven days to get your second. I was pissed it took that long. The junk was sweet and I wasted pages getting wasted, rushing on my run, feeling like Jesus's son. And wasting your time, too.\n\nThe feds busted the hotel where me and Dolly the Doormat, aka my wife whom I've never bothered to mention before, were staying. \"Why do you do junk, Bill?\" they asked. \"Because once I've shovelled enough garbage into my body,\" I replied, \"I'll get away with shovelling any old garbage into print. Take it from me, some suckers will one day call Naked Lunch a masterpiece.\"\n\nI came out the slammer determined to keep off junk. Chris the Cretin met me at the front desk and I shot a gram of H into my penis. \"You are a little bit dull when you're stoned,\" said Dolly the Doormat. \"It's better than being a lot dull when I'm straight,\" I snapped, picking up an RPG, several kilos of smack and going for a last chance power drive.\n\nAcross the border in Mexico I ran into Lupita the Loser, the 300lb dealer. Mexico City was full of pigeons so you had to be careful, but I got myself on a government programme and months passed in a two-dimensional flurry of drugalogs, dedicated to my amazing street cool.\n\nIke the Idiot brought over some cocaine and we started doing speedballs. C is non-addictive and therefore a bit rubbish, but if you take it with a bit of H it becomes more interesting. Apparently. Anyway, I decided to take another cure, putting myself - and you - through the tedious hell of yet another junk-sickness. After 10 days I was clean, though I had become a full-blown alcoholic, vomiting green bile and suffering from uraemic poisoning into the bargain.\n\nI've been off junk for two months now, though I'm still very cool, as junkies remain cool all their lives. Dolly the Doormat has taken the kids, whom I haven't mentioned either, down to Acapulco for a break. Actually she hasn't. I shot her dead while I was pretending to be William Tell, but the publishers thought that might be a bit of a downer.\n\nAnyway, I'd better go as I'm off to try some psychedelics. They're the new hit on the block. Allen says telepathy is a fact. And he's right. Because I know you think I'm a bit of a wanker."
