        "text": "from The Road Is Life: Maher on Kerouac (or maybe the title will change!) Coming soon . . .\n\nI do not remember the exact circumstances of reading Doctor Sax in 1984, other than I know it was the third book of his I read. I remember what prompted me to buy it, it was the Evergreen edition with its backcover synopsis:\n\n“Describing the mystery and terror of an intensely felt adolescence, Doctor Sax is the story of Jack Duluoz, like Kerouac himself a French-Canadian, growing up among the shadowy doorways and brown tenements of Lowell, Massachusetts. Always lurking in the back of Jack’s mind is the shadow of Doctor Sax, cape flowing, slouch hat half concealing a malevolent leer. He is one of the many ghosts, monsters, and demons that inhabit Jack’s fantasy-hidden world. Memory and dream are intermixed in a mad universe which at last erupts in an apocalyptic vision that destroys the reincarnation of evil, and with it the boy’s morbid world.”\n\nIt was that first sentence that caught my attention in the polished sterile confines of that San Diego bookstore, approximately 3,000-miles from Lowell. I was attracted to “intensely felt adolescence.” What was my adolescence, but intensely felt? Then there was Pawtucketville, a Lowell neighborhood that was very familiar to me. I may have held off on reading it, because my own experiences there had perhaps been to close for comfort. How would this book begin to describe that which lurked in my past like a slinking dog?\n\nI knew Pawtucketville. I remember the reeking smell of raw garbage spilling over sidewalks where the residents left their trash bags. The sidewalks always seemed dirty. Or Textile Avenue, where the college kids sat on the university steps in small groups. I thought that I was a long way from home when I crossed there with my friend. The neighborhoods somehow seemed worn out, as if populated by ghosts. My forays by foot were few and far, but I often drove there with my father. On Crawford Avenue, he lived after my parents were divorced. My grandmother had inherited a big house, and so he lived on the top floor with her. The bottom was rented to a tenant I never met. Next door, was the St. Jeanne d’Arc church, and so the house overlooked the parking lot. Years later, I found out that Jack Kerouac lived for a short while on the same street, and that he had claimed to have found the meaning of “beat” in the church vestry where he prayed. There was a little corner store that sold fresh baked beans. You could smell them cooking in the crock pots behind the counter. They were our Saturday afternoon staple. That was after I joined the navy and had come home occasionally for leave.\n\nAs a boy, we occasionally traversed Pawtucketville because of its proximity to the river. Other than that, we had no use for it. Once my bike was stolen, and as I drove around with my father, we saw it on the side of a road in Pawtucketville. There was no confrontation, as I simply took it back. I only seem to remember the neighborhood seemed to always be raining. It stung the air with the hue of brown, probably because of the old tenements in need of new paint jobs.\n\nUpon reading Doctor Sax, I was instantly familiar with what he was describing without making any sense of how he was doing it. Again, I had no initiation into this method of writing. When he wrote the book, he was high on marijuana, smoking huge joints as he sat on a toilet in William S. Burroughs’s toilet in Mexico City, that’s the legend of it. Boy, it read like it. The back cover was no lie in its approximation, that “memory and dream” were intermixed. Kerouac was transgressing what he knew with what he dreamt he knew, creating a conglomeration at once real yet otherworldly. Researching it later, I learned that much of what he described was factually accurate. It had that going for it. The memories of the streets, the overall aura of it drew me in, and it was those portions of the book that fascinated me. The rest, his apocalyptic portions steeped un Aztec mythology, or of Doctor Sax creeping through Pawtucketville’s river shadows and the orphanage grotto (it was always known as the “orphanage” when we were little, and if we misbehaved, we were admonished with the threat that we could end up there). The “gray afternoons in summer” always seemed like that, at least to me. As I wrote, the browns and grays of that world were spectral and timeless.\n\nThere were other reasons that Doctor Sax resonated. As a toddler, I was taken to an air show at Hanscom Air Force base by my father and younger brother. I remember none of this, but we had ascended the cockpit of a plane. I was behind my father, and when we reached the top stair, there was a small space between the cockpit and the upper rung of the stair. I had fallen through approximately eight to ten feet to the ground. My forming soft skull struck the paved tarmac. I had narrowly missed some piping that stuck out of a concrete barrier. I was sent to a hospital with a massive swelling to my skull. It was a severe concussion. I was hospitalized for several weeks. Not much after that (again, I do not remember,) I had struck my head again, and the swelling returned. My speech was affected and all of my cognitive faculties were disturbed. I suffered some paralysis in my mouth, causing me to drool. My ability to speak was afflicted with a stutter. This continued until first grade, when I entered Saint Louis de France school in Centralville – Lowell. The fall had awarded my parents some money from a lawsuit, and with it, they were able to buy our growing family our first house.\n\nIn the classroom, I daydreamed. I did not follow my lessons taught by Sister Rita Jean of the Sisters of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. There was a first-floor window facing the convent window directly across a little brick vestibule where there seemed to always be a little whirlwind causing dried leaves and litter to spin in circles. There was a goldfish bowl in the convent window directly across from where I sat. I only saw a little golden flick of a tail as it swam in circles. Everything spun in circles, especially the cycle of life and death rewarded by the redemption of God and its eternal reward of Heaven. I do not remember anything except that my head felt heavy, almost drowsy and I simply napped during our lessons. This caused me to stay back a year. Later, in adulthood, I retrieved a copy of my report card from 1968-1969, and pencilled in there from Sister Rita Jean was this: “Needs psychological help.”\n\nBut I never got it.\n\nMuch of my childhood of that time is lost to me. I recall that we walked to school every day (my brother and I). We walked from Ludlam Street to Saint Louis, approximately 1/3 of a mile. Through the little quiet cottage-like homes of Centralville our routine was obligatory and rote. Take the same path, every day, walking west down Ludlam Street, turn on Hildreth (past one of Kerouac’s childhood homes), a right onto Ennell Street, and then left on Boisvert. Rain or shine, winter or spring. It didn’t matter. We did it. There was a recess yard, and the boys were separated from the girls as I already wrote. Much of these memories were stirred by reading Visions of Gerard, and so I will save it for that chapter.\n\nI am just preambling, because the scar tissue is hard. To pierce to the quick of the matter, I need to describe what it was in Doctor Sax that stirred such deplorable memories. Throughout the text, Kerouac resurrects periods of sexual dysfunction he had experienced as a boy. It ranges from watching “fat lovers disentangling huge dimpled lady legs and hairy manlegs out of an intercourse” to that of a mentally-challenged late teen named “Zaza” who masturbated for Jackie Duluoz and his cohorts. In the school, the children’s restrooms were in the basement. There was a row of urinals for the boys, and it is there that Kerouac remembers a priest querying his older brother, Gerard, about the size of a schoolmate’s penis. Or, a “whore named Sue” who “threw up her dress” for the boys. Kerouac’s loss of innocence is documented with crazed precision. For myself, reading this book for the first time, it did not occur to me then. Only after several times did I realize that I had been sexually abused too. It had been from the crib onward, a memory of a man looming over me and later, in my pre-teens, an uncle who plied with me with whiskey after he had convinced my parents to let me sleep over he and my aunt’s house. They were heavy drinkers, and it always ended up that she would pass out in her bed and he would remain awake, endlessly querying me, trying to act like a soul-confidante, the friend I did not have. He would fill a tumbler with ice and whiskey and give it to me, and tell me to drink. I only recall two occasions, but the second time I drank, and the effects of which were instant. Once I was almost incoherent, he was on me.\n\nDoctor Sax, then, was never a pleasant reading experience. In recent years I culled it for its historical resonance in terms of biography, but now I realize it is, in 21st-century parlance, a “trigger” work. Kerouac’s miasma of memory and fantasy succeeds at every level in that regard. In its pages, something lurks deeper than we could ever truly know; it provokes for the reader an inexplicable diorama encapsulating all of the rich and disturbing memories that must have flooded Kerouac as he wrote this book. Perhaps cloaking this tenuous fantasy-structure, of castles and hills and apocalyptic visions of Aztec eagles clutching the serpent only served to shield him from unpleasant memories of death and sex. It may have exorcized bad experiences of his own. They must have clawed his emerging adolescence like screaming birds.\n\nI often wonder how Doctor Sax reads for others who have never been to Lowell, or specifically, Pawtucketville. It is a difficult work, to say the least. Without the talking heads to point out real-life landmarks and people, it is an impenetrable thicket. One could safely construct this world by the verisimilitude of Kerouac’s memories into writing much like Joyce’s Dublin of Ulysses. However, one cannot decipher his intentions, unlike say, the picaresque nature of his road novel, or the lovelorn brooding of The Subterraneans. In those creative realms, we can each draw from common experience. We have all hit the road at one time or another. We have each and all found and lost a love. However, Doctor Sax endures as something starker. It isn’t merely a recounting of childhood glee, as Kerouac proclaims. The people who move through these pages are spectral ghosts; they are what Herman Melville describes in Pierre, “Bannered armies of hooded phantoms” that linger as burning after-images, much as you may experience when you close your eyes for an instant and the visual burns your retina as it fades into nothingness. My over-familiarity with Doctor Sax’s landmarks brought home certain things that I vaguely remember. There was a crumbling edifice that we played around, that I believe was Kerouac’s “castle.” It was on a small hill that I vaguely recall having shards of broken glass on its concrete spillway, as kids had shattered all of the windows before it was finally demolished.\n\nBut how does Doctor Sax serve the average reader? Kerouac placed it into the chronology of his Duluoz Legend, and so it must be considered, at the very least, in this context. He also claimed, in an Italian interview, that it was his personal favorite. The book is the crystallization of Kerouac’s creative zenith because it is unencumbered the editorial intrusions that helped make On the Road such an accessible best-seller. Doctor Sax is his purest realization. It is the source of the desperation and loss that haunts On the Road. It is the vehicle that leads to the emotional, physical, and creative breakdown of Big Sur. The unpolished resonance of the prose is impinged by an honesty that undermines its intentions. Having studied Kerouac, I know that shortly before he wrote this book, he had written a series of “confessional” letters to his pal, Neal Cassady. This was in response to Cassady’s letter, a lengthy missive to which he had gone into explicit details his relations with a woman named Joan Anderson. With the floodgates opened, Kerouac was inspired with the realization that this was a viable avenue of expression. It was possible to draw from personal experience no matter how harrowing, embarrassing or painful. It is stream of consciousness prose to the ninth degree, but rendered inarticulate at times because there is no authentic point of connection. It is books like Doctor Sax that polarizes potential readers, because they like the idea of what he is doing more than the reality of reading his work.\n\nYet, is this truly not how a child sees the world? We witness adulthood’s problematic trials without having to take part in them. The book’s realism asks of its readers to imagine back to a time when the world seemed grander and more fantastical, when one was permitted to witness the world in a way that gets lost as we age. The vulgar and sometimes profane passages are unfiltered memory sequences that we don’t get to choose to witness when we are young. Kerouac is unrelenting in his choice to recapture it all with poetic density. He is looking back from his adult perspective, reflecting on this important period of his life. The novel’s subtitle, “Faust Part III” suggests a Faustian bargain of a sort, to which we can surmise that Jackie Duluoz had made a pact with Dr. Sax in return for the gift of his literary imagination. The result is lifelong torment and sadness.\n\nI was relieved to get through the book. By then, I was still close enough to my Lowell experiences so as to not miss it all that much and was not much willing to relive them. My memories of the time were harrowing, and I had successfully buried them into the fog of my brain injury. Kerouac had created a kaleidoscopic lens of Lowell, and by turning the scope, every facet shined a perspective that I was familiar, though not comfortable with. I was anxious to return to his road poetry. To this day, I have kept the original paperback of Doctor Sax. It is musty and aged, and perhaps that is appropriate given its subject matter. The book is seated in decay, of crumbling mansions and the ailing Canuck elders that populate the neighborhood. It has the symbol of the dead and dying, of purple wreaths on doors and the satin coffin of Mr. Yipe inside, but it does not make me want to ever return to Lowell.\n\nIt is sunny, no humidity in the late spring of 1960. A brisk breeze blows in Northport, Long Island where Jack Kerouac has made his home with his mother for two years now.\n\nHe sits in his yard reading his copy of Suranguma Sutra:\n\nWhat suffers rebirth is not the individual, but the pain of individuality…\n\nHe is sober, for now, having taken upon himself a concerted effort to abstain once again, to hold together his unraveling sanity and to maintain the endurance necessary to write. The mail has stopped coming since he hasn’t published a new book since the previous summer. For now there is Book of Dreams to which he was recently busy pencilling edits (changing names) in his “blackboard onionskin private Dreambook” he has to return to Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s City Lights in San Francisco. He also deletes dreams selected for publication by Ferlinghetti dealing with “ex-wives” so as to avoid libel lawsuits.\n\nThe momentum of On the Road slowed to a crawl, and the past three years had gone by in a blur, exacerbated by alcohol abuse and a hesitant dalliance with fame. Most of his important books written between 1952 and 1954 had already been published by publishers eager to snatch up a slice of the Kerouac pie, all released to little fan fare. There still is little regard for the merits of his unique writing and for the most part each book is panned by critics and shunned by readers. They bring royalty checks to cover the bills, but little else. Little by little, in America, they drop out of print, and since they had become forgotten, so was he.\n\nHe craves attention as much as he despises it.\n\nSo for now he sits in a lounge chair in his suburban backyard, bitterly remarking in his diary on the Soviet’s nuclear fallout from test bombing nuclear weaponry, that such men could ever “contaminate the freedom of eternity.” The previous night he had observed the rising moon. It reminded him of watching numerous rising moons in the northwest when he served as a fire lookout in the Washington Cascades. It makes him yearn for such an escape once more.\n\nThis night it rises again, bright and yellow as Kerouac watches from his yard with its stockade fencing, four trees and fresh-mown grass. He liked to think of himself as hiding incognito from the sufferings of fame and the nightmarish hellhounds of drinking. Or those who throw rocks at his door to get his attention. Here is serenity among his mother’s roses and daisies. To carry out his wish fulfillment of being like Henry Thoreau, he planted bean and corn plants. But somehow none of that is enough.\n\nHis mind is his means of making a living, yet he is barely driven to write. When he can’t write, he retrieves older work. This time he is under pressure to write another column for Escapade and another for True magazine. He considers using an abstract from an early draft of On the Road, his “Ray Smith ROAD” which he titles “The Loneliness of Doren Coit.” Finishing it means he could earn $1500.00 to buy a piano and take him to Mexico. But he doesn’t want to write it. To write his new column, Kerouac recited some of it into his reel-to-reel tape recorder. He knew what he wanted to say in it, but still felt like he didn’t want to. In the late 40s and early 50s, he was motivated by the truth of what he wanted to say, to describe, to confess, but all of that has faded into a memory as intangible as the dreams in Ferlinghetti’s fair copy of manuscript he has sent him.\n\nBy June 9, he is more hopeful. When he wakes, the sky reminds him of Canada and he learns that he has finally sold Doctor Sax overseas to French publisher, Gallimard. Doctor Sax, he regards as his masterpiece and its failure of America to accept that means he has another chance in the homeland of his ancestors.\n\nBy night he wonders, watching a full moon rising “cold & strange” over the sterile suburban Long Island landscape.\n\nThe next day Kerouac “knocked out” his jazz column for Escapade (which won’t be published until its December 1960 issue): “Ten years ago my good friend Seymour Wyse of London ran his finger across his throat and said: “Jass killed itself.”\n\nIt isn’t the piece abstracted from his “Ray Smith” working draft, but another utilized from his tape recording recital. But he still has the article to write for True. Another idea occurs to him where he imagines explaining “beat” to his old Lowell buddy, Mike Fournier. On several occasions, taking this creative tact helped him jumpstart his writing when he was starved for a method to move him through time. In April 1951, it was his second wife to which he explained the story of the road and Neal Cassady. In a few years it will be his third wife to which he will write of his long-gone football youth, when everything was fresh and exciting and the road was still ahead of him (in Vanity of Duluoz). But who to speak to now? He reaches into his past, to a person he hadn’t spoken to in almost two decades and is confounded because it baffles him into futility.\n\nHe is proud of the fact that he hadn’t had a drop of alcohol in days now. But that spell of sobriety is broken by evening when he has acquaintances over, Tom Payne, his “millionaire girlfriend” Mickey and Kerouac’s girlfriend Lois Sorrels. He gets drunk on gin. The ghost horrors of his heart resumes tenancy.\n\nBy the following morning, Kerouac is sick, not only because he is hungover, but with pangs of remorse. There is, he realizes, a pattern to his illness, and though he can identify this pattern, he does little to stop it. He continues drinking into the next day with Lois, his woman for the moment. Though she fulfills his sexual needs (under Gabe’s roof no less, crudely telling Ginsberg that she “comes to fuck and suck”), she is helpless to aid him in other ways.\n\nBy June 13, a Monday, he sinks to a gloomy funk. By Tuesday, he feels that his brain has gone “soft” and the labor of writing is the furthest thing from his mind. He has fallen into the same old trappings and no amount of reading the Surangama Sutra was going to save him. He only had to turn to his own Dharma notebooks for guidance:\n\n“The reason not to drink any alcohol at all is to attain permanently to the shivering bliss of pure blood. To keep the mind from confusion.” [see also Some of the Dharma, 94].\n\n“Drink,” he writes in his “Dharma” notebook on January 30, 1955, “is the curse of the Holy Life.” 5.5 years later he is battling the very same demons, this time in his house with the “reverend mother,” Gabrielle (as he referred to her in a Lowell interview a couple of years later). But that can’t shield him from his personal demons. There is little to do to wile away the long hours of a springtime slowly growing hotter into summer. Most times he makes “tape records” from jazz playing off the radio. In his heart he craves to write another novel by candlelight, like he did with Visions of Gerard when he penciled it in the candlelit darkness high on benezedrine in the wintry nights of January 1956 on his sister’s table top in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (addressing it to Lucien Carr).\n\nHe craves the impressionistic rush of holy words that came to him effortlessly, unhampered by brain fog and boredom, bowing to the great Buddhawork of his holy mission, salved by St. Paul’s Corinthians: “Neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.”\n\nHe is in need of a “secret trip” he tells Allen Ginsberg in a letter written to him in Peru on June 20. Mexico is his first choice: “if only I could have a month alone, and smile and talk to myself quietly in French in a flowery sad Mexican midnight study, with a big garden wall of lizards maybe …” He feels that he nothing more than a “hairy loss old man with not-thought and no-talk almost.” [letter to Ginsberg, June 20, 1960]\n\nBy mid-June not much has changed. Writing is the furthest thing from his mind. He feels sick and brain soft. He obsesses on the idea of going away by himself for a month. North port, its humdrum normalcy is driving him mad. When he wakes in the morning, he is “horrified” at that prospect of facing his mother … or anybody. Sitting in his midnight yard he self-analyzes what his problem is and what he should do about it. He is disturbed by the darkest depths of his depression to the degree that it tears him away from those life choices that brought him solace and joy. He doesn’t want to write or read. He doesn’t want to pray or meditate. He doesn’t want to “believe in anything any more.” He craves a “holiday to rediscover my heart.”\n\nBy mid-month agent Sterling Lord writes that Italian publishers have purchased the rights to Doctor Sax and Maggie Cassidy. More earnings he can count on when the years grow lean.\n\nHe yearns respect. It was Dan Talbot’s June 1958 New York Times review of Tristessa that last lauded Kerouac as a writer worthy of seriousness:\n\n“The true importance of Kerouac is that he rekindled the Super-Romantic tradition at a time when it needed rekindling. He is a born writer, as against an Academy-trained smithy. He loves language, and he obviously has a profound feeling for the human race. Never having been trained, since he didn’t care, to use prose as a sociological weapon or a Czerny exercise, he became a vaudeville bard. At times he sounds embarrassing, even sloppy. In the end he is more truthful, entertaining and honest than most writers on the American scene.”\n\nBut that seems like an eternity ago. He needs to reverse his thinking, to grasp an elusive mindset to write for himself and not for magazines and novels. He needs to find his own “private groove” like he did sketching in doorways and beat diner counter-tops in ’52, when he could describe the artificial affects of a Manhattan society girl with the same winsome ease as he writes of a junkie Mexican prostitute.\n\nHe gets drunk again on his latest favorite pairing: Schweppes and Gin. He pours the delicious clear tonic over his mother’s ice cubes popped from her ice tray and hits it with a splash of gin and soon he is blissfully high, turning the radio knob higher the drunker he gets.\n\nOn TV he watches the 1934 film starring Will Rogers, David Harum. In the mail he receives letters at last from Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Gregory Corso and Henri Cru then traveling in Genoa, Italy and scheduled to come to Northport in a few weeks. Desperate to finish his article for True, he starts to write again and stops. Beneath the stars he watches the universe reel a silent dance and for once, feels good. He remembers James Weschler’s essay that states that Kerouac was irresponsibly apolitical. Kerouac concedes because he is more attached to the freedom of eternity. Doesn’t one’s personality belie sufferance with life and death without ever being truly involved with either?\n\nPeople, he realizes, only tended to get bored with “final things”; they sought a means to an end, striving to get there without being present in the moment. He rejoined the Prajna understanding of life and death and emptiness. Inspired he composed several sonnets:\n\n“The world’s more / complicated than / an essay.”\n\nThere it all was, and he could have died that day knowing that he’d at least brought into manifestation his life’s sole mission, his life’s work. The Legend of Duluoz. Wrestling with mind and body for most of his life was yet to defeat by his sense of artistic responsibility. When he returned to New York City on June 22 (with Lois) he fell into a drinking binge. On the train back to Northport (Tom Payne was supposed to pick them up but didn’t) he experienced strange “benevolent” visions of the passengers.\n\nAt home, he sobered. He poured boiling water on poison ivy in the yard and read Norman Mailer’s advent of New Journalism, Advertisements for Myself, picking up on the writer’s humility and sense of humanity. Yet, Kerouac also picked up on the fact that Mailer misidentified “hipster” as a word from 1952. The term reached further back, Kerouac wrote in his diary, as far back as 1932. The word “beat” went possibly further to 1910 (“I’m sure”) to the black South and up to the more-recent exchange between Jack Teagarden and Louis Armstrong (“I sure is beat”). Mailer, Kerouac realized, had only chosen to take one side “righteously.” Mailer called Kerouac “dishonest.”This so disturbed him that his hand began to shake with dismay: “I just can’t take all this sea of sinister human hate engulfing my head.” Having received his “original manuscript” of On the Road that day, Kerouac realizes that he could have published something far greater than Mailer essays like “The White Negro.” It didn’t happen because On the Road was “horribly” marked-up and “castrated” by Malcolm Cowley. In Kerouac’s opinion, it would have been a far greater book had it been left intact in its original April 1951 incarnation; a long single confessional paragraph of breathless American wonderment (stowing it away in his carefully-maintained archive, Kerouac made plans to republish it in its original form in 1970).\n\nKerouac had endured being maligned by the American press both over- and under-handedly. The day he struggled with Mailer’s denouncement of his character, Newsday published a cartoon of a bearded, coffee cup/bongo holding beatnik smiling at a headline:”IKE VISIT CANCELLED.” Also pictures was a “Jack Kerouac” book. A drunken Gabrielle wrote Newsday declaring that the Kerouacs were Republicans: “We like Ike.” She called the staff liars and bums. Jack, for his part, did nothing. He never expected to be hated for writing honest-to-life books. He just wanted to be loved for his work. He allowed criticism to wound him because, like a child, he craved encouragement. Children, Kerouac noted, cannot thrive on hatred, nor could any human. Did this sinister encroachment arrive from Eastern Europe? Was it from the nuclear fallout? What of the recent riots storming Tokyo over U.S. occupation, to such a violent extent that Eisenhower was forced to cancel his trip? Do people really want peace at all?\n\nHe recalled his Desolation Peak satori: “I don’t know, I don’t care, and it doesn’t make any difference.” It didn’t even make a difference to go to Heaven, or the work it took to get there. There is no connection to what we are doing now and what we’ll be doing in Heaven. On earth, there is no “honest justice” so one is forced to hang in the balance in the great Void existing between Heaven and Earth.\n\nDeath haunted, Kerouac pictured his gravestone and its epitaph:\n\nI DON’T KNOW\n\nI DON’T CARE\n\nAND IT DOESN’T MAKE\n\nANY DIFFERENCE\n\nKerouac daydreamed of his death, of dying alone in the whirling Void, of the futility of a vainglorious funeral. He feels wiser because he sees the humor of it all. It wasn’t the death of Self that brings you closer to Heaven, but the “not-Self.”\n\nFrom June 23 to the 29th, there comes another long drinking binge. This time he graduates from gin to whiskey, leering, laughing, shouting with a house full of people. He calls his mother “ugly” in front of an encyclopedia salesman tries to get him to buy a $300.oo book set. Kerouac signs on the dotted line, “Go Fuck Yourself.” He drunk-dials newly jail-sprung Neal Cassady because he is afraid to do it sober (though Carolyn Cassady has written Kerouac in 1959: “You must banish any thought of any guilt as must Neal. There is none anywhere. Certainly your book would have had nothing whatever to do with his present circumstances!”\n\nHe continues drinking until he has difficulty breathing.\n\nHe wants to get a cabin and read more; to become a Thoreau of the Mind and a Buddha of the spirit. In the mirror he sees himself growing flabby and fat. The muggy weather makes him feel even more miserable. There is no more solace in Jesus or jazz.\n\n“I’m dying.”\n\nWhat lies truly around him? Long Island is a jungle waiting to devour him alive. He begins to despise even the springtime leaves and is scared of the birds on his mother’s feeder. He is suffering, he feels, from being hexed by “everybody.”\n\nHe is going mad.\n\nKerouac reads Herman Hesse’s Steppenwolf to which one presumes Kerouac might find some solace in authorial kinship. Hesse writes, “He belongs to those whose fate it is to live the whole riddle of human destiny heightened to the pitch of a personal torture, a personal hell.” Instead, Kerouac finds Hesse’s pronouncement “absurd” and that the German writer is no more than a “shameless old relic of the 19th century.” Furthermore, he feels that Hesse is an imitator of Dostoevsky. Bitterly, Kerouac is especially vexed because of Hesse’s winning of the 1946 Nobel Prize.\n\nAnd where was he? What had he earned for all of his troubles? Toward what aim did he sacrifice? He had forsaken two wives and one daughter, and of late, had even reacted badly toward his mother who in turn enabled him with her own drinking. He leans into his pencil, aghast at his naked diary confessions yearning for the Mexican night, of the lean tanned legs of “Tristessa” Esperanza and the swarming shadows of the Market Thieves. Not for him is the soft breeze of Parisian evenings, but that of the hot muggy Catholic guilt he witnessed all over Mexico City as potently as Lowell, Massachusetts. It was all sickening. In his books, critics and readers failed to see the scope and purity of his intent.\n\nHe is a martyr. He is Christ ascending Cavalry. He is Buddha beneath a tangerine tree.\n\nHe wants a hideout of his own, maybe somewhere in New England, to leave his mother to grow old in Northport. He wondered, in his state, why nobody bothers to help him, to take him away and allow him be left alone. For now he has an attic where the air conditioner pumps in dry air and keeps him away from the stifling summer heat that drops upon the Long Island shore by the end of June.\n\nJohn Clellon Holmes comes to visit. They sit in the attic and have a long talk. Kerouac shares details of his horrible state of mind. At 2 AM he tries to write but the dense silence of the suburbs affects him to such a degree that he has to turn on his fans to cover the sounds of his scribbling.\n\n“I HATE IT SO MUCH IT’S UNBELIEVABLE THIS HOUSE.”\n\nKerouac always feels eyes upon him, peering through half-closed drapes, from the street, through the doorway and into his mind. Time shows its emptiness throughout the “shit American Suburban horror” he sought to avoid.\n\nOn the morning of July 1, Kerouac wakes with stomach cramps so bad that he writhes on the floor. He shits black blood.\n\nHe feels better once it passes until more people come to his door, this time Charlie Byers and his cousin. Kerouac tells him that he’s sick, that his nerves are shot. Byers tries to talk him into a boat ride with his family. He says he’ll even hide the booze so Kerouac isn’t tempted. Kerouac is ashamed that such an offer even has to be made.\n\nThen his sister and nephew comes to visit. Lois wants to come over, and Henri Cru. Ginsberg is expected in a few weeks too.\n\nThe film The Subterraneans is about to have its premiere. MGM had taken liberties with his book subtitling it “Love Among the Bohemians.” It’ll start all over again, his peace and quiet, what little he has of it, to be shattered and his will to live disrupted.\n\nHe needs to be alone. Craves it with all of his heart’s desire.\n\nIn the first week of July, Ferlinghetti, all too aware of Kerouac’s problems, offers him the use of his cabin at Big Sur California. Kerouac writes back on July 8:\n\n“What I need now is a rest, is sleeping in my bag under the stars again, is quiet meditative cookings of supper, reading by oil lamp, singing, sitting by beach with note book and occasional wine.”\n\nFearing a railroad strike, he leaves earlier than planned.\n\nHe’s ready to start anew, brooding new promises to himself.\n\nTo find Buddha in sea waves and Christly temples in the Redwoods.\n\nThe Church is blowing\n\na sad windblown\n\n“Kathleen” on the\n\nbells in the skid\n\nrow slums.\n\nBut there is nowhere to go, he is caught between Heaven and Earth, whirling in the Void waiting to be set free at last."
