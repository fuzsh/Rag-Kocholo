        "text": "<strong>JACK</strong> <strong>KEROUAC</strong> (1922 - 1969) (Born Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac) American novelist, poet, essayist, and nonfiction writer. Kerouac is regarded as the one of the key figures of the Beat movement. He brought the term “Beat,” meaning both “beaten down,” or outcast, and “beatific,” or full of spiritual joy, into common use to describe the condition of his generation. His 1957 novel On the Road gained widespread recognition, both positive and negative, for the unconventional lifestyle and literary techniques practiced by the Beats. Some passages of the book are considered early examples of the “spontaneous prose” method that Kerouac developed in an effort to escape the strictures of grammar and syntax. Consequently, On the Road moves with the same frenetic energy as the reallife road trips and drunken episodes that are chronicled in a narrative that eschews extensive characterizations or plot development. Kerouac used several of his friends, including poet Allen Ginsberg and novelist William S. Burroughs, as models for the prominent characters in the autobiographical narrative, as well as in many of his other works. BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION Born in a French-Canadian community in Lowell, Massachusetts, Kerouac was reared in a devout Roman Catholic family and educated in parochial schools. An outstanding athlete, he received a football scholarship to Columbia University, but withdrew from the university during the fall of his sophomore year. He joined the U.S. Navy in 1943 and was honorably discharged after six months as an “indifferent character.” Kerouac worked for the remainder of World War II as a merchant seaman and later began associating with the bohemian crowd around Columbia, which included Ginsberg and Burroughs, both of whom were influential in Kerouac’s intellectual and artistic coming of age as well as becoming major figures associated with the Beat movement. Like Ginsberg and Burroughs, many of Kerouac’s friends among the Beats served as the basis for the characters in his novels. Poet Gary Snyder, for instance, inspired Japhy Ryder, the main character in The Dharma Bums (1958). The single most influential personality in Kerouac’s circle of friends, and the protagonist in both On the Road and Visions of Cody (1972), was Neal Cassady. Kerouac saw the energetic, charismatic Cassady as the quintessential Beat figure—an independent spirit who lived unhindered by societal conventions. Kerouac also cited Cassady’s stream-ofconsciousness writing style, exemplified in his voluminous correspondence, as having inspired his own “spontaneous prose” technique. This freeflowing, fast-paced, and self-consciously poetic style of narrative, which is not observable in Kerouac’s first novel, The Town and the City (1950), BEAT GENERATION: A GALE CRITICAL COMPANION, VOL. 3 63"
