        "text": "The U.S. finally got to enjoy an easy night at the World Cup.\n\nThere might not be many more of those.\n\nJaylen Brown scored 20 points, Kemba Walker added 15 and the U.S. rolled past Japan 98-45 Thursday in the Group E finale. And now, the stakes get higher with the Americans set to face Greece — and NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo — in a second-round opener on Saturday in Shenzhen, China.\n\n“They were very serious tonight and they respected the Japanese team very much,” U.S. Coach Gregg Popovich said. “They didn’t take anything for granted and they played hard. So I was pleased with their performance.”\n\nHarrison Barnes scored 14 points while Joe Harris and Donovan Mitchell each had 10 for the Americans (3-0), who are bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive World Cup title. The 45 points allowed were the fewest yielded by any team in the first round of this World Cup, the 53-point margin was the third-biggest so far in the tournament, and Mitchell thought it was the best defense the Americans have played this summer.\n\n“We’ve had games where we played 30 minutes of great defense or 35 and kind of let up a little bit,” Mitchell said. “I think for a whole game, to really lock in and set a tone, it was really impressive.”\n\nYudai Baba scored 18 for Japan (0-3), which will play in classification games the rest of the way. Rui Hachimura, Japan’s best player and the No. 9 draft pick this year by the Washington Wizards, was held to four points on 2 for 8 shooting.\n\nA U.S. program that is accustomed to blowout wins, particularly when it has NBA players, hadn’t enjoyed one yet in six games against international competition this summer. The Americans finally got one, two days after needing late-game heroics to beat Turkey 93-92 in overtime, was drama-free.\n\nIt was 13-0 before Japan scored, 23-9 after a quarter, 56-23 at halftime and 73-25 midway through the third quarter when Hachimura got loose for a dunk and his first points of the night.\n\nGreece 103, New Zealand 97\n\nGreece is headed to the second round of the World Cup after beating New Zealand 103-97 on Thursday in a showdown between teams that both had a shot at advancing.\n\nGreece (2-1) was the last team to make the 16-team field for the second round.

Patrick Auda also scored 16 points for the Czechs (2-1).\n\nCedi Osman scored 24 points and Furkan Korkmaz added 16 for Turkey (1-2), which came within one-tenth of a second of beating the United States on Tuesday and wasted a five-point lead in overtime of that game before losing 92-91.\n\nFrance 90, Dominican Republic 56\n\nAt Shenzhen, France and the Dominican Republic were both assured of making the second round. The French team’s emphatic victory left no doubt that it was the best team in Group G.\n\nNando De Colo led France (3-0) with 15 points and Rudy Gobert added 13.
