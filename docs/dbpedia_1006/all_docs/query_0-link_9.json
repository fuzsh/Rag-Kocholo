        "text": "In 2018 at halftime of a Pro B game between the Fraport Skyliners Juniors and TG s.Oliver Wurzburg on a BBL game free Saturday night, one could observe the usual suspects of the BBL team hanging around as Finish national player Shawn Huff was chasing his kids around, Mike Morrison was calm and collected in the stands raving about his son who was strutting his early youth basketball ability on the side with another child while Quantez Robertson (188-SG-1984, college: Auburn, agency: Interperformances) was chilling next to Morrison playing a basketball game on his phone and was in control in his mindset not only what was happening on his phone, but also seemed to know exactly what else was happening around him just like when he is being his freak athlete self on the basketball court. Suddenly Mr Canada Philip Scrubb popped up scaring the hell out of Morrison who couldn’t believe that he had missed the whole first half. Scrubb along with Quantez Robertson or ‘Tez’ as everyone calls him except for maybe his mom belong to the most faithful Fraport Skyliners who diligently watch the farm team almost every weekend in their free time. For Scrubb, it’s not a burden, but something very self evident. ‘I just like watching basketball and I think that it is important to support the guys. I’m living on my own so usually I don’t have anything else to do’, stressed Philip Scrubb. Just like Scrubb, Tez Robertson is a basketball junkie and for him, if he wasn’t at the gym watching the farm team, he would be in his apartment playing games on his phone, so why not be at a game supporting the guys. Scrubb and Robertson have only been teammates for two seasons now, but something definitely links their basketball existence in Frankfurt especially when the word ‘greatest’ is mentioned. For many who follow basketball in Canada, Scrubb is seen as being the greatest Canadian college player of all-time, while in basketball Frankfurt Quantez Robertson is simply a living legend the way Ricky Paulding was in Oldenburg and Tez was working on his legacy as a Skyliner as developing that label greatest was in progress. Robertson is a Fraport Skyliner lifer who would never play for another professional team and continued to carve his legacy of becoming one of the greatest Fraport Skyliners of all-time.\n\nMiles Schmidt Scheuber and Tez calling the 2010 BBL allstar game in Bonn\n\nBefore coming to the Fraport Skyliners in 2009 as a rookie, the Cincinnati native first made a name for himself playing at Auburn (NCAA) for head coach Jeff Lebo the school that gave the basketball world the creative and special character of Charles Barkley that people have loved or hated for 40 years. Before coming to Auburn in 2005, he already had gained some extra basketball know how at the well known Laurinburg Institute in North Carolina a place that trained future greats like Sam Jones, Chris Washburn, Joey Dorsey and Renaldo Balkman. Robertson was already fascinating people in high school and 8 years later in 2013 former teammate Kris Douse even remembered his play despite having not seen him play since then. ‘I can imagine he is the best defender in the German league. He is super athletic and a freak athlete’, warned Kris Douse. That freak athlete label is something that has carried him through his whole career and would really get noticed at Auburn where he got more onto a national stage in the NCAA. In his first three years at Auburn, the team finished fifth, fourth and sixth in the SEC west, but in his senior year, the school was second in the SEC west with a solid 10-6 record and 24-12 record overall and reached the NIT Elite 8. It was at Auburn where Tez started to develop his freak athlete game and with his day to day battles on the court with pure scorer Rasheem Barrett, the American was able to grow as a defender. It was here that Robertson who lists former NBA player Marcus Thornton as his hardest opponent in the NCAA really set the foundation for his defensive game coupled with scoring tendencies that would make him into a top player in the German BBL. He was named outstanding defensive player at Auburn three times and left the school as the all-time steal leader with 210. He also started a personal trend that would carry over into his professional career with showcasing consistency and filling up the stat sheet with ease on a regular basis the way swimming legend Michael Phelps did Olympic medals. He also left a lasting impression there for teammates and future Auburn players by his playing style. In the fall of 2013, ex Auburn player Frankie Sullivan was briefly with the Fraport Skyliners, but then left. Sullivan came to Auburn when Robertson was a senior and remembers the impact that he had on him. ‘Quantez Robertson is one of the reasons why I even attended Auburn. I look up to him. One of if not the hardest workers I know in the game of basketball. He really is a freak athlete’, stressed Frankie Sullivan. There is that freak athlete word again, a term that has become as common when describing Robertson’s play as it is giving Tom Brady the GOAT term. Even guys coming to Auburn like a Kenny Gabriel who reached the Euroleague with Panathinaikos Superfoods Athens (Greece-A1) remembers Tez well. ‘Quantez is one of the best defenders I know! I remember playing pick up over the summer before he left to go to overseas and he looked at me and said ‘you haven’t got your second wind yet’?! But man he can really play basketball’, added Kenny Gabriel. On the court, Tez once blocked 7 Oklahoma State shots, but Sullivan remembers one block the most. ‘The most amazing thing I ever seen him do was the game saving block shot against Florida in the SEC tournament my freshman year. The man blocked a three point shot for us to win the game. Fun times’, stressed Frankie Sullivan. Robertson left Auburn as a legend and would soon start to leave lasting memories as a professional overseas in Germany.\n\nThe jersey of Tez after his last game of the 2012-2013 season after the 77-72 win over Ludwigsburg as a gift for me thanks Tez\n\nIn 2018 most of Robertson’s ex Auburn teammates like Rasheem Barrett, Lucas Hargrove, Dewayne Reed and Frankie Sullivan had all retired while Tay Waller was still active having played in Italy that season. In his first 9 seasons with the Fraport Skyliners he had played primarily for three coaches with Murat Didin, Muli Katzurin and Gordon Herbert with the later having been his basketball teacher for 6 seasons. Robertson came to Frankfurt in 2009 as a quiet and shy freak athlete and needed no adjustment period as he was thrown into cold water right away from the Turkish Babbaaa Murat Didin. Even if his former teammates Phiip Scrubb and Mike Morrison have compared Tez’s game to a Joe Dumars or Scottie Pippen funny enough he didn’t look up to some NBA guard growing up, but to power forward Kevin Garnett as he was trying to leave a lasting impression as a rookie in Frankfurt. ‘ I liked the way he plays. He plays with a lot of emotion and aggression on the court. He is a leader and I like how he teaches things on the bench to the other players’, stressed Quantez Robertson. When Tez came to Frankfurt, he was only 24, but played like a mature 27 or 28 year old man. ‘I have played a lot of Basketball in my life and have played with good players with some going to the NBA. It has helped me being around them, because they helped me to get along with teammates and discuss strategies on the court’, stressed Quantez Robertson. As a rookie with Frankfurt he played 48 games averaging 6.0ppg, 4.0rpg, 2.1apg, 1.3spg, FGP: 49.3%, 3PT: 35.6%, FT60.0%. Even though his defensive presence was his staple in his game, his outside shooting was exceptional and the best rate he would have until the 2015-2016 season where he shot 36%. He almost won his first professional title as he lost a bitter 5 game series to Bamberg and was teammates with guys like Pascal Roller, Derrick Allen and Jimmy Mckinney. Robertson made huge strides as a defender at the end of his rookie season as Gordon Herbert replaced Murat Didin in April and almost led the team to their third team title. ‘Coach helped me to improve my shooting and my free throws and on defense. He tells me to keep being aggressive and since I am one of the best defenders of the team, he tells me I should act like it. He has helped me to improve getting in the passing lanes and stopping the other teams’ best player’, stressed Quantez Robertson in 2010. His absolute humbleness which he has carried into his ninth professional season was already present as a rookie. When asked where the team would have really been in June 2010 with his defensive presence, he answered the way a team player should. ‘I think they would still be where they are. I am just a piece of the puzzle to the success on the defense’, added Quantez Robertson. But sometimes one has to wonder what could have been had he made the jump to the NBA. He is good enough to play in the NBA based off of his defensive skills alone, but his knock has always been his shot which may have been the reason why he didn’t get a shot. It would have been very interesting to see how he would of defended some of the best scorers in the NBA. But then again getting to the NBA is so difficult and it shouldn’t be a major surprise he isn’t there even if many believe he could be there. ‘It doesn’t surprise me because the NBA is hard to get into. However I do think that he could play in the NBA and be a great defensive stopper for a lot of teams. The only thing that I think would be the problem is a scout talking about him not being able to score at his height. The crazy thing is he can score the basketball when he is aggressive. I really think if a team would pick him up they would be getting a steal’, warned ex teammate Frankie Sullivan. The Fraport Skyliners aren’t sad he isn’t in the NBA, but been thankful for 14 seasons that he not only has been with the team, but never left. In 2013 he had interest from Alba Berlin and FC Bayern Munich, but stayed in Frankfurt playing for a lot less, but the comfortable surroundings of Frankfurt and the tight knit Skyliner family won over the dough.\n\nJustin Cobbs, Sean Armand, Quantez Robertson and Miles Schmidt-Scheuber in Langen in 2014\n\nIn his second professional season, the Fraport Skyliners would have another potent season as they were one of the top teams in the league and finished in second place. However their title run was stopped in the semi-finals against Alba Berlin. Both teams had gone against the norm winning their 2 road games, and when it came down to that all deciding do or die game 5 in Frankfurt, the home team couldn’t grind out the win getting clobbered 87-68. The low point of the season was the career ending injury to AJ Moye who might have been the missing link to winning the title had he not gone down in November. Robertson and Moye had been meshing so well off the court and who knows where their chemistry would have been in the playoffs had he been around. ‘We were like brothers from the start. We were the two first guards that got to Frankfurt that summer and worked out together and hung out together. He is like a brother away from home’, expressed Quantez Robertson in 2010. A big highlight in this season were the frequent back door cuts and dunks from Robertson that 2011 MVP Dashaun Wood would feed to him. ‘I think that Tez doesn’t have those spectacular dunks like two years ago. He really should call me and thank me for all those back door passes that I gave him’, smiled Dashaun Wood in 2013. Wood was the star on the team and Tez in his shadow, but Wood knew that Tez was just as valuable as he was. ‘Tez always does the important things that are not seen on the stats. His biggest job was playing 40 minutes and defending the Braunschweig guards. He had the same energy and intensity for 40 minutes. I strongly believe that we would not have won without Tez’, warned ex Wright State guard Dashaun Wood. Tez also had great teammates in Roger Powell and Chris Moss that kept the boat afloat. This was also the last season of guard Pascal Roller who would retire. On the court, Robertson would be able to improve his scoring and rebounding stats from his rookie season as he played 38 games averaging 7.7ppg, 5.0rpg, 1.8apg, FGP: 55.3%, 3PT: 29.1%, FT: 68.9%. In the Eurocup, he battled against ex Skyliner Keith Simmons and was expressed by the young Skyliner. ‘Robertson is very athletic. He is one of the most athletic players that I have ever played against. I thought that he was taller than what he was, but he made up for it with his explosiveness. You just have to try to stay in front of him’, warned ex Banvit guard Keith Simmons. In that season Robertson also battled future Euroleague player Marquez Haynes who witnessed the ex Auburn star with Gran Canara and didn’t only notice his defense. ‘What stood out was the way he attacks the basket. He is relentless’, warned ex Boston College Eagle Marquez Haynes.\n\nQuantez Robertson and the Fiba Europe Cup title in 2016\n\nThe next three seasons from 2011-2014 were some down years for the organization as money was tight which effected the caliber of players that were available. The club didn’t reach the playoffs, but it was still an important time as this was a phase of player development as the club laid an emphasis on German players and the German big three of Johannes Voigtmann, Danilo Barthel and Konstantin Klein was born and being groomed and getting ready to attack that third club title. After bowing out to Alba Berlin, Frankfurt and Berlin swapped head coaches as Herbert went to Berlin and Israeli Muli Katzurn came to Frankfurt. Katzurin would stay two seasons and had had prior success with Czech Republic team Nymburk having won 8 titles in 4 years, but didn’t bring any success to Frankfurt. The club did defend very well, but couldn’t muster much offense on a consistent basis and finished ninth and 14th. Even if the team achieved no real success, Robertson was able to add on to his game through the two year guidance of Katzurin. ‘I have learned from him to always keep playing no matter what is happening. He also told us to always attack the rim and shoot when we can and not to think about it, but just shoot’, said Quantez Robertson. In those two years, the American played with further strong players like Devin Gibson, Michael Thompson, Zach Peacock and Johannes Herber and also formed new relationships as well and gained further experience. It is always a pleasure to hear the extreme respect from teammates or opponents for Quantez Robertson. ‘I miss his athleticism and it was a lot of fun to watch him go coast to coast in practice and games. Defensively his hard work and desire was unreal and he was a lot of fun to watch and play with’, added ex teammate Michael Thompson. ‘Tez is probably the most competitive guy I have played with on and off the court. Every day he competed at a very high level’, expressed Devin Gibson.\n\nMiles Schmidt-Scheuber and Tez at Basketball City Mainhatten 2016\n\nAfter two years, the Katzurin era was over and to the delight of many fans, the organization brought back Gordon Herbert. However the success didn’t come right away as this was another difficult season for the team as they finished in 11th place and probably would have made the playoffs had they not had had the crunch-time blues as they lost six games by three points or less in the second half of the season against weak teams like MBC, Tuebingen and Braunschweig, but then again came home and beat top teams Munich and Ulm. The club had a lot of youth as they had to rely on rookie guards Ramon Galloway and Jarred Dubois to carry a lot of the load which didn’t translate in consistency or success. A bright spot was the German big three of Voigtmann, Barthel and Klein who continued to develop their game. Robertson continued to be a main contributor at both ends of the court and averaged in double figures in scoring for the first time in his professional career in 2012-2013 playing 34 games averaging 10.8ppg, 6.3rpg, 2.9apg, Steals-2 (1.9spg), FGP: 49.7%, 3PT: 29.8%, FT: 75.0%. Ex Polish champion and ex top BBL point guard Kevin Hamilton who played with Braunschweig and Bayreuth rememberd that when he had the ball, he had to be aware all the time where he Robertson was. ‘Quantez Robertson was one of the best defenders in the league, and one of the most athletic human beings I have ever seen’, added Kevin Hamilton. That was just another good example of the unending respect that his peers gave him.\n\nMiles Schmidt-Scheuber and Tez at basketball City Mainhatten in 2018\n\nIn the next two seasons, the club would improve their play each season and would lead to the team’s third professional title with the 2016 Fiba Europe Cup title. In the 2014-2015 season, the club finished in sixth place and reached the Final 4 of the Eurochallenge losing in the semi-finals. Barthel and Voigtmann had become house hold names in German basketball and the club had a strong trio of Americans with Justin Cobbs, Sean Armand and Aaron Doornekamp that carried the offense. Robertson also gave his two cents and had his best offensive season as a professional as in the BBL he played 37 games averaging 11.1ppg, 4.4rpg, 3.2apg, 1.4spg, FGP: 50.3%, 3PT: 34.1%, FT: 80.6%; and in the EuroChallenge he played 17 games averaging 10.9ppg, 4.6rpg, 2.5apg, 1.5spg, FGP: 55.2%, 3PT: 33.9%, FT: 76.2%. Suddenly it wasn’t a hazard anymore to keep him in the corner and let him fire away, but he had become a real feared shooter as you couldn’t keep him alone. The club played a hard fought 4 game series against FC Bayern Munich, but lost as it wasn’t ready yet for that big coup in the playoffs. In the Eurochallenge he would face Dutch powerhouse Den Bosch and face an ex Auburn player with Chris Denson who played there after Robertson had left and had heard of him being a legend there. Robertson was in his sixth season, but continuing to have guys looking up to his success and progress as a professional. ‘I have spoken to him in the past. But when I speak to him again I would ask him advice about how he has been able to have a good career in Germany. I look up to older players and hope I can progress like he did’, stressed Chris Denson. In the 2015-2016 season, it all came together as the team finished in third place in the BBL and won the Fiba Europe Cup. The club was led by Jordan Theodore who played a MVP type season and just carried the team and especially in crunch-time when the team need a bucket he was instant buckets. Voigtmann and Barthel had transformed into top BBL players while Doornekamp became more of a scorer and Robertson was aided on the defensive end with the pit bull John Little. It also didn’t hurt that you had a sniper and high basketball IQ player like rookie Philip Scrubb coming from the bench. Robertson had another very strong season playing 40 games averaging 9.7ppg, 3.5rpg, 3.1apg, 1.4spg, FGP: 45.3%, 3PT: 36.3%, FT: 77.0% and in the FIBA Europe Cup played 19 games averaging 11.2ppg, 4.1rpg, 2.8apg, 1.4spg, FGP: 60.6%, 3PT: 40.2%, FT: 82.9%. He had battled Brandyn Curry in the Eurochallenge the season before and in this season in the BBL and also got lauding words from the Harvard graduate. ‘Quantez Robertson is the best defensive player I’ve come across in my career thus far. A very good overall player who plays so hard at all times and never backs down from anything’, added Brandyn Curry. ‘He was a huge part of our team when we won the Fiba Cup. We wouldn’t have won without any of the other guys, but Tez made a lot of big plays in the final two games’, stressed Philip Scrubb. ‘We had a great team and Tez still played 37 minutes a game. He was the glue, won best defender and hit a huge 3. No doubt we would of lost it without him’, warned teammate Mike Morrison. In the 2016-2017 season, the club finished only in 10th place and just missed the playoffs. The biggest weakness was at the point guard position where the club just didn’t have that Cobbs or Theodore like guy that could change games and know how to combine scoring and playmaking at the right moments in games to impact it. Robertson had another solid season playing 32 games averaging 10.8ppg, 6.1rpg, 3.1apg, Steals-1 (2.5spg), FGP: 48.5%, 3PT: 30.6%, FT: 82.4%; In the BCL he played 16 games averaging 8.4ppg, 5.4rpg, 3.1apg, Steals-3 (2.4spg), FGP: 38.5%, 3PT: 31.3%, FT: 82.8%.\n\nMiles Schmidt-Scheuber and Tez in 2019\n\nIn the 2017-2018 season the Fraport Skyliners were hit hard by injuries, but the club reached the playoffs again with a depleted team losing a tough 5 game series to FC Bayern Munich. The club was as thin as a professional ski jumper as often they played with a 6-7 man rotation and won games as well as losing despite having every chance to win. The club brought in the correct point guard with rookie Taj Webster and had the experienced role player on board with Shawn Huff and saw the Germans Isaac Bonga and Richard Freudenberg developing nicely. Robertson as always kept the team together and was able to conserve his energy better than in previous seasons as the club didn’t play in the international competition. But he is still averaged 32 minutes per game which was fourt most in his professional career. This shows just how valuable he still was for the team and Gordon Herbert as he continued to be a vital factor at both ends of the court. In the last years, the Fraport Skyliners have often been plagued with injuries and that was always the time where Robertson had to play at the highest level and his teammates noticed. ‘It’s been great playing with Tez, he’s someone who helps the team in so many different ways, which takes a lot of pressure of the rest of the guys’, warned ex Carleton (CIS) guard Philip Scrubb. ‘His strength is the same as always. Tez plays hard, tough, and leads the team. He’s a great teammate. His work ethic and toughness he brings everyday we all feed off of. If you had a team full of Tez’s u would have no choice but to be successful’, warned ex George Mason (NCAA) center Mike Morrison. He had some big games in his career in terms of steals as he produced six steals against FC Bayern Munich and Alba Berlin and hit teams like Ludwigsburg, Wurzburg, Bonn and Bayreuth twice for five steals in his career. He had 16 games where he had one steal or more in a row and 14 games of one steal or more in a row. Great defense aren’t always measured with steals, but that is often what gets the Frankfurt fast break rolling which in turn sparks their offense. Even if his defense doesn’t rub off on every player, they do try to get something positive from his defense. ‘A lot of the things he can do on the court I can’t replicate, but I think his attitude and intensity on the floor is something everyone can learn from’, stressed Philip Scrubb. In the 2017-2018 season he averaged 10.1ppg, 4.6rpg, 2.7apg, Steals-2 (1.9spg), FGP: 45.6%, 3PT: 33.3%, FT: 79.3%\n\nMiles Schmidt-Scheuber and Tez in 2021\n\nNot only on the court is his play loved by many especially in Frankfurt, but off the court, he is a guy that is always good for a laugh and also keeps the team loose on the road. He has vastly improved in his question and answer sessions with me after games as 5-6 years ago, it seemed like he was practicing a standard post and pre game answers as more often than not they seemed the same like ‘we have to rebound well and limit them to one shot’, but through time, practice and experience, he has developed into a very good interview before and after games. He also has added wit and is always good for a comical answer to lighten up the conversation. Since covering him for 14 seasons, the ex Auburn star knows very well that I will be lurking in the catacomb of the Fraport arena and knows that I will bombard him with many questions. In the last years he has added a standard phrase when he approaches me with ‘Miles I’m not answering any questions today’ while I say ‘Tez I only got 25 questions today and not 85 like last game’. It’s all in good fun as he never hesitates, but answers all my questions to the best of his ability. He even developed a very nice friendship with Mike Morrison off the court as they were always joking around and having fun. Morrison and Robertson were teammates for 4 years and already have a big history of stories. ‘You know we have a million stories. We always have jokes going back and forth and always clowning on the road. Tez is really goofy’, added Mike Morrison. But even with their actions on the court can lead to clowning around as observed after the 90-63 drubbing of the Walter Tigers Tuebingen where the Morrison and Tez Lebron show failed. In a Frankfurt run came what could have been the play of the game, but wasn’t as the Lebron like pass off the back board to himself dunk didn’t work between Robertson and Morrison as both gave each other the blame for the miss. Robertson made a quick heads up play getting in the passing lane and making a steal while Morrison was sprinting down the left hand of the court. Robertson had the big fellow in eyesight somehow, and instead of finishing himself tossed the ball underhand off the backboard which Morrison couldn’t handle as it sailed out of bounds. ‘I knew that Tez would throw me the ball. He threw it too soon and I had to jump inward instead of upward. It was Tez’s fault’, joked Mike Morrison. ‘Of course Mike said it was my fault, but he missed it’, yelled Quantez Robertson. It is never dull with Morrison and Tez as they have made Frankfurt their second home as they have been with the club a combined 18 years. Even his ex teammate Jordan Theodore remembers the good times with Robertson even if his overall competitiveness was also present off the court. ‘Tez and I hung out a lot and played a lot of UNO and Tez liked to cheat. He liked being the old head at Uno. Tez made his own rules at Uno. If you don’t believe me ask Mike Mo and Aaron’, smiled ex Seton Hall (NCAA) standout Jordan Theodore. Robertson is just loved by his teammates and they are happy he was on their side and not on the other side of the court.\n\nMiles Schmidt-Scheuber and Tez in 2021 clowning around\n\nSo the question in 2018 was how much longer would Quantez Robertson still play and where does he rank up in the all-time greatest players in Fraport Skyliners basketball history? Robertson wasn’t the youngest anymore, but wasn’t slowing down either. In a way he is like the Tom Brady of basketball that seems to be getting better with age. His offensive production has been consistent and been at its best in the last four seasons and he still belonged to the top defenders in the league with no real signs of slowing down. He already had the right frame of mind as a rookie about how to survive major minutes and it has continued to carry over into his thirties as his minutes continue to be much. ‘Sometimes in practice, I don’t get a break so I am used to it. When I am on the floor in games, I just don’t pay attention to it, but just want to win’, warned Quantez Robertson. His non stop work off the court through the years have allowed him to keep that explosiveness and athleticism which is his bread and butter. ‘I started doing squats in college as well as lunges which I have continued to do now to help keep my athletic ability’, stressed Quantez Robertson. In 2018, he was still going strong. ‘I have no idea how he plays so many minutes so hard. I doubt he has any plans to stop playing anytime soon’, warned Mike Morrison. ‘How long he plays is up to him and how he feels, he’s still playing at a high level so I can see him playing for a while longer’, added Philip Scrubb ‘? I see Tez playing his entire career in Frankfurt. Tez will always be seen as the recognizable player for Frankfurt basketball’, stressed Euroleague player Jordan Theodore in 2018. One thing that separates Robertson from most in the BBL is that he is always a draw. The way fans go to packed arena’s in the NBA to witness greatness from a Lebron, Westbrook or Durant, fans do the same with Tez in the BBL. When the day comes that he is no longer playing, then there will be a huge void left as his exciting play is seen in every game as there is at least one memorable play by him. ‘He makes some crazy plays. The most impressive was a miss. He tried to dunk on Berlin’s big man 2 seasons back and he jumped so fast and so high, he actually jumped to high and tried to dunk it too hard. I was on the bench and I turned to a teammate and said “that’s the best miss I’ve ever seen in my life’, laughed Mike Morrison in 2018. There is that comical side of the big man surfacing while talking about his friend Quantez Robertson. For some just witnessing a routine Tez play which would be a spectacular play for any other player is something that will be missed from each game. ‘Any time he gets a rebound and takes the ball coast to coast for a layup or assist is pretty impressive’, warned Philip Scrubb in 2018.\n\nMiles Schmidt-Scheuber and Tez May 2023"
