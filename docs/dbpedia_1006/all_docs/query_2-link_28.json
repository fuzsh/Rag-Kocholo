        "text": "By Antonis Stroggylakis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nFenerbahce Beko is signing swingman Jarell Eddie to a one-plus-one deal, sources told Eurohoopsâ€™ Nikos Varlas. Eddie will play in EuroLeague for the first time in his career with the Turkish powerhouse.\n\nEddie, 28, spent the 2019-2020 season in Spain with UCAM Murcia. The American player averaged 14.4 points and 3.1 rebounds in 26:35 minutes over 22 games of the Spanish ACB League while shooting 44.0 percent on 175 3-point attempts.\n\nIn January, Eddie drained 10 3-pointers in a win over Badalona, tying a club record set by Taqwa Pinero (then Taquan Dean) for the most 3-pointers made by a Murcia player in a single game.\n\nBefore Murcia, Eddie made his European debut in France with SIG Strasbourg. He competed in both the French Jeep Elite League and the Basketball Champions League.\n\nEddie will become the sixth new addition of Fenerbahce during the 2020 offseason, after guard/forward DyShawn Pierre, center Johnathan Hamilton, forward/center Danilo Barthel, forward Edgaras Ulanovas and guard Lorenzo Brown. The 2017 EuroLeague champions have been undergoing a major renovation this summer following the hiring of Igor Kokoskov as the new head coach."
