        "text": "EuroLeague\n\nFans of the Turkish Airlines EuroLeague and 7DAYS EuroCup will get a sneak preview of the star power coming their way in those competitions when more than 100 Euroleague Basketball players put on their national team jerseys for continental championships starting this week.\n\nSeveral EuroLeague and EuroCup players are already competing in the FIBA Americas Cup 2017 in Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay, with the objective of becoming medalists on Sunday, September 3. Meanwhile, the signature international tournament of the summer, FIBA EuroBasket 2017, tips off on Thursday in four countries – Finland, Israel, Romania and Turkey – with 24 national teams aiming for glory. The tournament will run until a winner claims the continental title on Sunday, September 17 at Sinan Erdem Dome in Istanbul, Turkey, the same venue where Fenebahce Dogus Istanbul was crowned EuroLeague champion last May. Out of the 24 national teams, 19 have a connection to Euroleague Basketball as players on next season's rosters at 15 EuroLeague and 19 EuroCup teams are represented at EuroBasket.\n\nGroup A\n\nFinland, France, Greece, Iceland, Poland, Slovenia\n\nGreece, which features as many as 10 players combined from Olympiacos Piraeus and Panathinaikos Superfoods Athens, is poised to try to return to the medals podium for the first time since 2009. Greece posseses a deep trio of playmakers – Nick Calathes of Panathinaikos, Vangelis Mantzaris of Olympiacos and Kostas Sloukas of Fenerbahce Dogus Istanbul – who share six EuroLeague titles. The Greek frontcourt has loads of veteran leadership, too, in All-EuroLeague forward Georgios Printezis and the competition's all-time leading rebounder, Ioannis Bourousis. France, always aiming high, is led this time by the CSKA Moscow guard duo of Nando De Colo and Leo Westermann. Also expected to have important roles are a pair of new FC Barcelona Lassa additions – playmaker Thomas Heurtel and big man Kevin Serpahin. Slovenia will surely be among the must-watch teams. EuroLeague Rising Star Trophy winner Luka Doncic of Real Madrid has emerged as its new go-to guy, while his Real Madrid teammate Anthony Randolph makes his debut for Slovenia. Sharpshooter Klemen Prepelic of Levallois Metropolitans and Jaka Blazic of EuroCup newcomer MoraBanc Andorra are among the other potential difference-makers for Slovenia. This group's host, Finland, will rely on perimeter shooting from Petteri Koponen of Barcelona and Sasu Salin of Unicaja Malaga. A reigning EuroCup champ from Unicaja, Adam Waczynski, will be among the leaders for Poland, which also features A.J. Slaughter of Asvel Villerubanne in the backcourt, and Przemek Karnowski of Andorra in the paint.\n\nNicolo Melli — Brose Bamberg — EB16\n\nGroup B\n\nGeorgia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Lithuania, Ukraine\n\nAlthough hurt by injury, Lithuania won silver medals at the last two EuroBaskets and will aim for nothing less again. Forward Jonas Maciulis of Real Madrid is one of the leaders of this team, which also features playmaker Mantas Kalnietis of AX Armani Exchange Olimpia Milan, sharpshooter Arturas Milaknis of Zalgiris Kaunas and rebounder Arturas Gudaitis of Lietuvos Rytas. Lithuania will miss Lukas Lekavicius of Panathinaikos in the backcourt, however, after his injury in a friendly game. One team certain to challenge Lithuanians is Italy, coached by four-time EuroLeague winner Ettore Messina. He'll have a brand new EuroLeague champ, Luigi Datome of Fenerbahce, and All-EuroLeague forward Nicolo Melli, who joined Fenerbahce this summer, to give versatility to the frontcourt. Daniel Hackett of Brose Bamberg and Andrea Cinciarini of Milan can expect to share ballhandling duties for Italy. Israel is a team with experience and home-court advantage in this group. Guard Gal Mekel of Herbalife Gran Canaria Las Palmas will be an important offensive weapon for Israel, but so will the group of players from the reigning Israeli champion and perennial EuroCup contender Hapoel Bank Yahav Jerusalem: Yogev Ohayon, Bar Timor and Yotam Halperin in the backcourt, and Lior Eliyahu up front. Versatile forward Tornike Shengelia of Baskonia and former EuroLeague champ Giorgi Shermadini of Unicaja are expected to carry some of the load for Georgia. Another Baskonia big man, Johannes Voigtmann, could be a force in the paint for his national team, Germany, as he was in his EuroLeague debut. FC Bayern Munich forward Danilo Barthel should provide Germany with scoring, while Bamberg sharpshooter Lucca Staiger brings experience and his club teammate, Patrick Heckmann, makes his senior national team debut.\n\nAdam Hanga — Baskonia Vitoria Gasteiz — EB16_7q6laq4nstth5b83\n\nGroup C\n\nCroatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, Romania, Spain\n\nThe defending champions and perennial favorites Spain go into the tournament having won medals at eight of the last nine EuroBasket tournaments, including the last five. However, Spain suffered a huge blow during the preparation period when it lost the reigning EuroLeague MVP, Sergio Llull of Real Madrid, to a knee injury. Spain does not lack additional weapons, however. Sergio Rodriguez, the former EuroLeague MVP point guard who joined CSKA Moscow this summer, will share point guard duties with former EuroLeague Rising Star Trophy winner Ricky Rubio. All-time EuroLeague scoring king Juan Carlos Navarro of FC Barcelona is back with the national team alongside the Gasol brothers, Pau and Marc, who will carry the load in the paint. And Valencia Basket contributes three of its perimter players – Fernando San Emeterio, Joan Sastre and Guillem Vives – to the Spanish cause. Croatia has plenty of experience in a backcourt that features Krunoslav Simon of Anadolu Efes Istanbul and Roko Ukic of Cedevita Zagreb. Montenegro has FC Barcelona's Tyrese Rice – former EuroLeague Final Four MVP – running the offense. Versatile shooting guard Suad Sehovic of Buducnost VOLI Podgorica will have an important role on the perimeter, as will big men Bojan Dubljevic of Valencia Basket and Marko Todorovic of Khimki Moscow Region in Montenegro's stocked front line. Hungary, playing its first EuroBasket in almost two decades, will look to the EuroLeague's Best Defender Trophy winner, Adam Hanga of Barcelona, for leadership as it hopes to get into elimination rounds from a group that also includes Czech Republic and Romania, this group's host.\n\nAlexey Shved — Khimki Moscow Region — EC16 (photo Eugene Solodov — Khimki)\n\nGroup D\n\nBelgium, Great Britain, Latvia, Russia, Serbia, Turkey\n\nEach time that Turkey has hosted big tournaments – as the 2001 EuroBasket and the 2010 World Cup — it has won the silver medal. Hosting both the group stage and the final rounds this time, and coming off the signature success of Fenerbahce in the EuroLeague, Turkey's hopes are high. The squad features three of Fenerbahce's EuroLeague-winning players, including starting point guard Ali Muhammed and sharpshooter Melih Mahmutoglu. A new Fenerbahce player, Sinan Guler, is Turkey's captain and one of the key pieces of the team, as is Darussafaka Istanbul big man Furkan Aldemir. Turkey's biggest rival in group stage will surely be Serbia. Led by FC Bayern Munich head coach Sasha Djordjevic, Serbia has won silver medals at the Rio Olympics last summer and the 2014 World Cup. With All-EuroLeague guard Bogdan Bogdanovic as its new leader, Serbia is strong at each position. Bayern passing ace Stefan Jovic should see his most extensive role so far with Serbia, as should Ognjen Kuzmic, the new big man for Real Madrid. Both were teammates last season with defensive ace Branko Lazic of Crvena Zvezda mts Belgrade. Russia arrives to Istanbul led by 7DAYS EuroCup MVP Alxey Shved of Khimki Moscow Region. Andrey Vorontsevich and Nikita Kurbanov, two-time former EuroLeague champs with CSKA, will provide huge veteran presence and winning mentality for the Russians. Latvia enters the tournament with high hopes and arguably its deepest roster ever. Janis Strelnieks of Olympiacos and Dairis Bertans of Milan will threaten from perimeter, while Baskonia's Janis Timma will give extra depth in the frontcourt. Belgium will be another dangerous opponent in this group, with veteran forward Axel Hervelle leading this squad. His RETAbet Bilbao Basket teammate Jonathan Tabu will run the offense.\n\nSource http://www.euroleague.net/news/i/85gh4of457l336g4/eurolea..."
