Seventeen football or soccer players from a Spanish Third Division football team participated voluntarily in this study. A prospective longitudinal study was developed during the 2020/2021 season. Twenty-four weeks were analyzed from October to March, including a regenerative microcycle due to the absence of competition during Christmas. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and session-rate of perceived exertion (sRPE) were registered for every training and game session. Afterward, acute and chronic workloads were calculated, and ACWR was subsequently derived from them. Furthermore, non-contact injuries were registered during the period mentioned. The main findings were that there is a poor correlation between the ACWR and non-contact injuries (r=0.069 (p<0.05)), and the use of the ACWR by itself is insufficient to predict the occurrence of non-contact injuries in a semiprofessional football team. Consequently, the ACWR is not an useful predictive tool for injuries in semiprofessional football teams. metadata Seco-Serna, Roberto; Lago-Fuentes, Carlos y Barcala Furelos, Martín mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, carlos.lago@uneatlantico.es, martin.barcala@uneatlantico.es (2024) The Acute: Chronic Workload Ratio and Injury Risk in Semiprofessional Football Players.

The present research aims to validate the 3 × 2 achievement goals questionnaire of Mascret in Spanish in a population of athletes. (2) Method: By using a latent factor approach, it is possible to identify the underlying dimensions of these goals and to better understand how they are structured. For this purpose, this questionnaire has been translated and compared with the life satisfaction scale. An exploration of the multifaceted nature of sport goals has been carried out using structural equation modelling. A total of 580 athletes (463 males and 216 females, M = 21.5, SD = 2.36) from different sport disciplines and from 12 autonomous communities in Spain participated in the research. (3) Results: The results show that the questionnaire presents a high scale reliability and that all items contribute significantly to the internal consistency of the scale.

To address this challenge, hybrid data processing methods, combining complementary rough sets, have emerged as a promising approach for handling uncertainty. However, selecting an appropriate model and effectively utilizing it in data mining requires a thorough qualitative and quantitative comparison of existing hybrid data processing models. This research aims to contribute to the analysis of hybrid data processing models based on neighborhood rough sets by investigating the inherent relationships among these models. We propose a generic neighborhood rough set-based hybrid model specifically designed for processing hybrid data, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the data mining process without resorting to discretization and avoiding information loss or practical meaning degradation in datasets. The proposed scheme dynamically adapts the threshold value for the neighborhood approximation space according to the characteristics of the given datasets, ensuring optimal performance without sacrificing accuracy. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we develop a testbed tailored for Parkinson’s patients, a domain where hybrid data processing is particularly relevant. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms existing schemes in adaptively handling both numerical and categorical data, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95% on the Parkinson’s dataset. Overall, this research contributes to advancing hybrid data processing techniques by providing a robust and adaptive solution that addresses the challenges associated with handling hybrid data, particularly in the context of Parkinson’s disease analysis. metadata Raza, Imran; Jamal, Muhammad Hasan; Qureshi, Rizwan; Shahid, Abdul Karim; Rojas Vistorte, Angel Olider; Samad, Md Abdus y Ashraf, Imran mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, angel.rojas@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Adaptive neighborhood rough set model for hybrid data processing: a case study on Parkinson’s disease behavioral analysis.

Extensive data analysis was done on different databases spanning diverse variables such as location, property type, facility, and user level. The database is constructed utilizing robust approaches such as feature augmentation, outlier reduction, and value loss. A number of complex regression models, such as linear regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient regression, are generated on the pre-developed database. The model is improved through hyperparameter adjustment to increase prediction accuracy. A cross-validation approach was employed to examine the performance and resilience of the model. In addition, a feature significance study was undertaken to discover the most significant elements impacting Airbnb prices. The experimental findings suggest that the improved regression approach delivers greater prediction accuracy than the standard model. The results of this study add to Airbnb’s pricing system and can promote improved decision-making for hosts and visitors searching for competitive pricing. metadata Sar, Ayan; Choudhury, Tanupriya; Bajaj, Tridha; Kotecha, Ketan y Garat de Marin, Mirtha Silvana mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, silvana.marin@uneatlantico.es (2024) Airbnb Price Prediction Using Advanced Regression Techniques and Deployment Using Streamlit.

Accordingly, medical professionals and health-related institutions reach out to patients and seek feedback to analyze, monitor, and uplift medical services. Such views and perceptions are often shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Twitter is the most popular and commonly used by the researcher as an online platform for instant access to real-time news, opinions, and discussion. Its trending hashtags (#) and viral content make it an ideal hub for monitoring public opinion on a variety of topics. The tweets are extracted using three hashtags #healthcare, #healthcare services, and #medical facilities. Also, location and tweet sentiment analysis are considered in this study. Several recent studies deployed Twitter datasets using ML and DL models, but the results show lower accuracy. In addition, the studies did not perform extensive comparative analysis and lack validation. This study addresses two research questions: first, what are the sentiments of people toward medical services worldwide? and second, how effective are the machine learning and deep learning approaches for the classification of sentiment on healthcare tweets? Experiments are performed using several well-known machine learning models including support vector machine, logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, extra tree classifier, k nearest neighbor, random forest, decision tree, and AdaBoost. In addition, this study proposes a transfer learning-based LSTM-ETC model that effectively predicts the customer’s satisfaction level from the healthcare dataset. Results indicate that despite the best performance by the ETC model with an 0.88 accuracy score, the proposed model outperforms with a 0.95 accuracy score. Predominantly, the people are happy about the provided medical services as the ratio of the positive sentiments is substantially higher than the negative sentiments. The sentiments, either positive or negative, play a crucial role in making important decisions through customer feedback and enhancing quality. metadata Usman, Muhammad; Mujahid, Muhammad; Rustam, Furqan; Soriano Flores, Emmanuel; Vidal Mazón, Juan Luis; Díez, Isabel de la Torre y Ashraf, Imran mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, emmanuel.soriano@uneatlantico.es, juanluis.vidal@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Analyzing patients satisfaction level for medical services using twitter data.

Many systems have been developed for the agriculture supply chain to overcome such issues, however, monopolistic centralized control is the biggest hurdle to realizing the use of such systems. It has eventually gained consumers’ trust in branded products and rejected other products due to the lack of traceable supply chain information. This study proposes a blockchain-based framework for supply chain traceability which provides trustable, transparent, secure, and reliable services for the wheat crop. A crypto token called wheat coin (WC) has been introduced to keep track of transactions among the stakeholders of the wheat supply chain. Moreover, an initial coin offering (ICO) of WC, crypto wallets, and an economic model are proposed. Furthermore, a smart contract-based transaction system has been devised for the transparency of wheat crop transactions and conversion of WC to fiat and vice versa. We have developed the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to improve data availability, security, and transparency which stores encrypted private data of farmers, businesses, and merchants. Lastly, the results of the experiments show that the proposed framework shows better performance as compared to previous crop supply chain solutions in terms of latency to add-blocks, per-minute transactions, average gas charge for the transaction, and transaction verification time. Performance analysis with Bitcoin and Ethereum shows the superior performance of the proposed system. metadata Alam, Shadab; Farooq, Muhammad Shoaib; Ansari, Zain Khalid; Alvi, Atif; Rustam, Furqan; Díez, Isabel De La Torre; Vidal Mazón, Juan Luis; Rodríguez Velasco, Carmen Lilí y Ashraf, Imran mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, juanluis.vidal@uneatlantico.es, carmen.rodriguez@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Blockchain based transparent and reliable framework for wheat crop supply chain.

This study aims to explore the connections between personality and ED symptoms, identify central nodes, and compare the EDs network to a healthy control network. Methods We employed network analysis to examine the personality-ED symptom connections in 329 individuals with an ED diagnosis and 192 healthy controls. We estimated a regularised partial correlation network and the indices of centrality and bridge centrality to identify the most influential nodes for each group. Network differences between groups were also examined. Results Low Self-Directedness and high Harm avoidance emerged as central bridge nodes, displaying the strongest relationship with ED symptoms. Both networks differed in their global connectivity and structure, although no differences were found in bridge centrality and centrality indices. Conclusions These findings shed light on the role of personality dimensions, such as Self-Directedness and Harm Avoidance in the maintenance of ED psychopathology, supporting the transdiagnostic conceptualisation of ED. This study advances a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between personality dimensions and ED symptoms, offering potential directions for clinical interventions. metadata Ruiz‐Gutiérrez, Jose; Miras‐Aguilar, María del Mar; Rodríguez‐Pérez, Noelia; Ventura, Ludovica; González Gómez, Jana; del Barrio, Andrés Gómez y González‐Blanch, César mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, cesar.gonzalezblanch@uneatlantico.es (2024) Bridging personality dimensions and eating symptoms: A transdiagnostic network approach.

It has been demonstrated that the consumption of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) with a high content of phenolic compounds is beneficial in the prevention and/or treatment of many diseases. The main objective of this work was to study the relationship between the content of phenolic compounds and the in vitro neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity of EVOOs from two PDOs in the province of Granada. To this purpose, the amounts of phenolic compounds were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS) and the inhibitory activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes by spectrophotometric and fluorimetric assays. The main families identified were phenolic alcohols, secoiridoids, lignans, flavonoids, and phenolic acids. The EVOO samples with the highest total concentration of compounds and the highest inhibitory activity belonged to the Picual and Manzanillo varieties. Statistical analysis showed a positive correlation between identified compounds and AChE and COX-2 inhibitory activity, except for lignans. These results confirm EVOO’s compounds possess neuroprotective potential. metadata López-Bascón, María Asunción; Moscoso-Ruiz, Inmaculada; Quirantes-Piné, Rosa; del Pino-García, Raquel; López-Gámez, Gloria; Justicia-Rueda, Andrea; Verardo, Vito y Quiles, José L. mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, jose.quiles@uneatlantico.es (2024) Characterization of Phenolic Compounds in Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Granada (Spain) and Evaluation of Its Neuroprotective Action.

However, how these models evolve over time has not been studied. The objective of the present work is to compare the characteristics of patients who present mortality in the short, medium and long term, and to derive and validate a predictive model for each mortality time. Methods: A prospective multicenter study was conducted, which included adult patients with unselected acute illness who were treated by EMS. The primary outcome was noncumulative mortality from all causes by time windows including 30-day mortality, 31- to 180-day mortality, and 181- to 365-day mortality. Prehospital predictors included demographic variables, standard vital signs, prehospital laboratory tests, and comorbidities. Results: A total of 4830 patients were enrolled. The noncumulative mortalities at 30, 180, and 365 days were 10.8%, 6.6%, and 3.5%, respectively. The best predictive value was shown for 30-day mortality (AUC = 0.930; 95% CI: 0.919–0.940), followed by 180-day (AUC = 0.852; 95% CI: 0.832–0.871) and 365-day (AUC = 0.806; 95% CI: 0.778–0.833) mortality. Discussion: Rapid characterization of patients at risk of short-, medium-, or long-term mortality could help EMS to improve the treatment of patients suffering from acute illnesses. metadata Enriquez de Salamanca Gambara, Rodrigo; Sanz-García, Ancor; del Pozo Vegas, Carlos; López-Izquierdo, Raúl; Sánchez Soberón, Irene; Delgado Benito, Juan F.; Martínez Díaz, Raquel; Mazas Pérez-Oleaga, Cristina; Martínez López, Nohora Milena; Dominguez Azpíroz, Irma y Martín-Rodríguez, Francisco mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, raquel.martinez@uneatlantico.es, cristina.mazas@uneatlantico.es, nohora.martinez@uneatlantico.es, irma.dominguez@unini.edu.mx, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) A Comparison of the Clinical Characteristics of Short-, Mid-, and Long-Term Mortality in Patients Attended by the Emergency Medical Services: An Observational Study.

In the last years, unusual manifestations have become very frequent, and currently, it is not so uncommon to diagnose CD in subjects with overweight or obesity, especially in adults; however, little is known in the pediatric population. This systematic review aims to evaluate the literature regarding the association between CD and overweight/obesity in school-age children. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. An electronic database search of articles published in the last 20 years in English was carried out in Web of Sciences, PubMed, and Medline. The quality of the included studies was assessed by using the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology statement. Results: Of the 1396 articles identified, 9 articles, investigating overweight/obesity in children/adolescents affected by CD or screening CD in children/adolescents with overweight/obesity, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the results showed that the prevalence of overweight or obesity in school-age children (6–17 years) affected by CD ranged between 3.5% and 20%, highlighting that the coexistence of CD with overweight/obesity in children is not uncommon as previously thought. Conclusion: Although CD has been historically correlated with being underweight due to malabsorption, it should be evaluated also in children with overweight and obesity, especially those who have a familiar predisposition to other autoimmune diseases and/or manifest unusual symptoms of CD. metadata De Giuseppe, Rachele; Bergomas, Francesca; Loperfido, Federica; Giampieri, Francesca; Preatoni, Giorgia; Calcaterra, Valeria y Cena, Hellas mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, francesca.giampieri@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Could Celiac Disease and Overweight/Obesity Coexist in School-Aged Children and Adolescents?

Much of the research has focused on image captioning, which involves describing images with meaningful sentences. Typically, when generating sentences that describe the visual content, a language model and a vision encoder are commonly employed. Because of the incorporation of object areas, properties, multi-modal connections, attentive techniques, and early fusion approaches like bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), these components have experienced substantial advancements over the years. This research offers a reference to the body of literature, identifies emerging trends in an area that blends computer vision as well as natural language processing in order to maximize their complementary effects, and identifies the most significant technological improvements in architectures employed for image captioning. It also discusses various problem variants and open challenges.

A major challenge in predicting depression using social media posts is that the existing studies do not focus on predicting the intensity of depression in social media texts but rather only perform the binary classification of depression and moreover noisy data makes it difficult to predict the true depression in the social media text. This study intends to begin by collecting relevant Tweets and generating a corpus of 210000 public tweets using Twitter public application programming interfaces (APIs). A strategy is devised to filter out only depression-related tweets by creating a list of relevant hashtags to reduce noise in the corpus. Furthermore, an algorithm is developed to annotate the data into three depression classes: ‘Mild,’ ‘Moderate,’ and ‘Severe,’ based on International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) depression diagnostic criteria. Different baseline classifiers are applied to the annotated dataset to get a preliminary idea of classification performance on the corpus. Further FastText-based model is applied and fine-tuned with different preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning to produce the tuned model, which significantly increases the depression classification performance to an 84% F1 score and 90% accuracy compared to baselines. Finally, a FastText-based weighted soft voting ensemble (WSVE) is proposed to boost the model’s performance by combining several other classifiers and assigning weights to individual models according to their individual performances. The proposed WSVE outperformed all baselines as well as FastText alone, with an F1 of 89%, 5% higher than FastText alone, and an accuracy of 93%, 3% higher than FastText alone. The proposed model better captures the contextual features of the relatively small sample class and aids in the detection of early depression intensity prediction from tweets with impactful performances. metadata Rizwan, Muhammad; Mushtaq, Muhammad Faheem; Rafiq, Maryam; Mehmood, Arif; Diez, Isabel de la Torre; Gracia Villar, Mónica; Garay, Helena y Ashraf, Imran mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, monica.gracia@uneatlantico.es, helena.garay@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Depression Intensity Classification from Tweets Using FastText Based Weighted Soft Voting Ensemble.

IoT health monitoring solutions eliminate the need for regular doctor visits and interactions among patients and medical personnel. Many patients in wards or intensive care units require continuous monitoring of their health. Continuous patient monitoring is a hectic practice in hospitals with limited staff; in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, it becomes much more difficult practice when hospitals are working at full capacity and there is still a risk of medical workers being infected. In this study, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based patient health monitoring system that collects real-time data on important health indicators such as pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature but can be expanded to include more parameters. Our system is comprised of a hardware component that collects and transmits data from sensors to a cloud-based storage system, where it can be accessed and analyzed by healthcare specialists. The ESP-32 microcontroller interfaces with the multiple sensors and wirelessly transmits the collected data to the cloud storage system. A pulse oximeter is utilized in our system to measure blood oxygen saturation and body temperature, as well as a heart rate monitor to measure pulse rate. A web-based interface is also implemented, allowing healthcare practitioners to access and visualize the collected data in real-time, making remote patient monitoring easier. Overall, our IoT-based patient health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in remote patient monitoring, allowing healthcare practitioners to access real-time data on important health metrics and detect potential health issues before they escalate. metadata Islam, Md.

Identifying pigment signs (PS) linked with RP is crucial for monitoring and possibly slowing the disease’s degenerative course. However, the segmentation and detection of PS are challenging due to the difficulty of distinguishing between PS and blood vessels and the variability in size, shape, and color of PS. Recently, advances in deep learning techniques have shown impressive results in medical image analysis, especially in ophthalmology. This study presents an approach for classifying pigment marks in color fundus images of RP using a modified squeeze-and-excitation ResNet (SE-ResNet) architecture. This variant synergizes the efficiency of residual skip connections with the robust attention mechanism of the SE block to amplify feature representation. The SE-ResNet model was fine-tuned to determine the optimal layer configuration that balances performance metrics and computational costs. We trained the proposed model on the RIPS dataset, which comprises images from patients diagnosed at various RP stages. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed model in classifying different types of pigment signs associated with RP. The model yielded performance metrics, such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f-measure of 99.16%, 97.70%, 96.93%, 90.47%, 99.37%, 97.80%, 97.44%, and 90.60% on the testing set, based on GT1 & GT2 respectively. Given its performance, this model is an excellent candidate for integration into computer-aided diagnostic systems for RP, aiming to enhance patient care and vision-related healthcare services. metadata Rashid, Rubina; Aslam, Waqar; Mehmood, Arif; Ramírez-Vargas, Debora L.; Diez, Isabel De La Torre y Ashraf, Imran mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, debora.ramirez@unini.edu.mx, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) A Detectability Analysis of Retinitis Pigmetosa Using Novel SE-ResNet Based Deep Learning Model and Color Fundus Images.

The approach poses security challenges, such as model integrity, that must be addressed to ensure the reliability of the learned models. In this context, software-defined networking (SDN) can play a crucial role in improving the security of federated learning systems; indeed, it can provide centralized control and management of network resources, enforcement of security policies, and detection and mitigation of network-level threats. The integration of SDN with federated learning can help achieve a secure and efficient distributed learning environment. In this paper, an architecture is proposed to detect attacks on Federated Learning using SDN; furthermore, the machine learning model is deployed on a number of devices for training.

At varying stages of requirement specification, multiple ambiguities emerge. Ambiguities may appear at several levels including the syntactic, semantic, domain, lexical, and pragmatic levels. The primary objective of this study is to identify requirements’ pragmatic ambiguity. Pragmatic ambiguity occurs when the same set of circumstances can be interpreted in multiple ways. It requires consideration of the context statement of the requirements. Prior research has developed methods for obtaining concepts based on individual nodes, so there is room for improvement in the requirements interpretation procedure. This research aims to develop a more effective model for identifying pragmatic ambiguity in requirement definition. To better interpret requirements, we introduced the Concept Maximum Matching (CMM) technique, which extracts concepts based on edges. The CMM technique significantly improves precision because it permits a more accurate interpretation of requirements based on the relative weight of their edges. Obtaining an F-measure score of 0.754 as opposed to 0.563 in existing models, the evaluation results demonstrate that CMM is a substantial improvement over the previous method. metadata Aslam, Khadija; Iqbal, Faiza; Altaf, Ayesha; Hussain, Naveed; Gracia Villar, Mónica; Soriano Flores, Emmanuel; Diez, Isabel De La Torre y Ashraf, Imran mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, monica.gracia@uneatlantico.es, emmanuel.soriano@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Detecting Pragmatic Ambiguity in Requirement Specification Using Novel Concept Maximum Matching Approach Based on Graph Network.

Vegetarian diets have been associated with cardiovascular benefits, including improvements in metabolic parameters. However, the impact of a vegetarian diet on cardiovascular parameters, specifically arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis, in healthy individuals remains unclear. Thus, this study aims to analyze differences in arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis between vegetarian and omnivorous diets in healthy subjects. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following established guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies examining the association between vegetarian and omnivorous diets with arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis. Cross-sectional studies reporting carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWv) as a measure of arterial stiffness and carotid intima media thickness (c-IMT) as a measure of atherosclerosis were included. Data were synthesized using random effects models, and sensitivity analyses, meta-regressions, and assessment of publication bias were performed. Results: Ten studies were included in the systematic review, and seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis demonstrated that individuals following a vegetarian diet had differences in the levels of arterial stiffness (cf-PWv) compared to those following an omnivorous diet (MD: −0.43 m s−1; 95% CI: −0.63, −0.23). Similarly, atherosclerosis (c-IMT) was found to be different in individuals adhering to a vegetarian dietary pattern (MD = −29.86 mm; 95% CI: −58.41, −1.32). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a vegetarian diet is associated with improved arterial stiffness and reduced atherosclerosis in healthy individuals. These results support the inclusion of a well-balanced vegetarian dietary pattern in the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases. However, further research is needed to explore the effects of a vegetarian diet on arterial health in diverse populations and to assess long-term cardiovascular outcomes. metadata Saz-Lara, Alicia; Battino, Maurizio; del Saz Lara, Andrea; Cavero-Redondo, Iván; Dávalos, Alberto; López de Las Hazas, María-Carmen; Visioli, Francesco; Lucerón-Lucas-Torres, Maribel y Giampieri, Francesca mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, maurizio.battino@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, francesca.giampieri@uneatlantico.es (2024) Differences in carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity and carotid intima media thickness between vegetarian and omnivorous diets in healthy subjects: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Infertility conditions affect the female reproductive tract (FRT) and its resident microbiota. However, a disturbance in homeostasis could influence the FRT and other distal body sites, such as the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). We included 21 patients with endometriosis and other infertility-associated diseases with clinical profiles and biological samples from the FRT (endometrium, endometrial fluid, and vagina), and GIT samples (oral and feces). We performed a 16S rRNA analysis of site-specific microbial communities and estimated diversity metrics. The study found body site-specific microbial patterns in the FRT–GIT. In both study groups, Lactobacillus was the most shared Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV), a precise identifier of microbial sequences, between endometrial and vagina samples. However, shared Gardnerella and Enterobacteriaceae ASVs were linked to other conditions but not endometriosis. Remarkably, Haemophilus was a specific GIT-shared taxon in endometriosis cases. In conclusion, infertility influences distinctly the FRT and GIT microbiomes, with endometriosis showing unique microbial characteristics. We proposed the concept of ‘female holobiont’ as a community that comprises the host and microbes that must maintain overall homeostasis across all body sites to ensure a woman’s health. Insights into these microbial patterns not only advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of infertility but also open new avenues for developing microbe-based therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring microbial balance, thereby enhancing fertility prospects. metadata Marcos, Ana T.; Rus, Maria J.; Areal-Quecuty, Victoria; Simon-Soro, Aurea y Navarro-Pando, José Manuel mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, jose.navarro@uneatlantico.es (2024) Distinct Gastrointestinal and Reproductive Microbial Patterns in Female Holobiont of Infertility.

The analysis uses financial data of 14,619 ICT listed companies of 22 countries from 2003 to 2018. Additionally, macroeconomic data specific for the countries and the sector were used. For the analysis of dynamic panel data, a System-GMM method is used. Among the findings, we highlight that cash flow, contrary to the known theoretical models and empirical evidences, negatively impacts on R&D investment. Debt is neither the right source for R&D funding, as the effect is also negative. This suggests that ICT companies are forced to manage their R&D activities differently, relying more on other funding sources, taking advantage of growth opportunities and benefiting from a favourable macroeconomic environment in terms of growth and increased business sector spending on R&D. These results are similar in both sub-sectors and in all countries, both bank- and market based.

There is a gap in the scientific literature regarding training programs that improve the performance of young futsal players. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of different strength and velocity training programs on lower body physical performance in youth futsal players. Forty-two youth futsal players were divided into control group (CG, n = 14) and a strength intervention group (SG, n = 14), which included a weekly session for 8 weeks of eccentric strength training, plyometrics and core strengthening, and a velocity intervention group (VG, n = 14), which included a weekly session during 8 weeks of training with linear speed exercises and with change of direction, accelerations with resistance bands and core strengthening. SG significantly improved horizontal jump (HJ) (p:0.02), V-CUT (p:0.91) and change of direction deficit (CODD) (p:0.01). VG showed significant improvements in HJ (p:0.01), in 25 m sprint (p:0.01), in total repeated sprint ability time (p:0.01), in V-CUT (p:0.01) and in CODD (p:0.01). SG showed significant intergroup differences (p:0.01) in COD variables with respect to CG and VG. In conclusion, SG and VG showed significant improvements in lower body performance variables in youth futsal players. In addition, the SG has substantial changes in COD compared to the other two groups, so it has a greater effect. metadata Villanueva-Guerrero, Oscar; Lozano, Demetrio; Roso-Moliner, Alberto; Nobari, Hadi; Lago-Fuentes, Carlos y Mainer-Pardos, Elena mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, carlos.lago@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Effects of different strength and velocity training programs on physical performance in youth futsal players.

The analysis focused on changes in carbohydrate properties within the black mulberry fruit matrix during simulated digestion and fermentation. Human fecal microbiota were collected and introduced to the fruit matrix to monitor the fate of both soluble and insoluble polysaccharides during fermentation. The results revealed that enzymatic treatments enhanced the solubilization of carbohydrates from mulberry fruits, with pectinase showing the most significant effect. Throughout the process of in vitro digestion, there was a gradual increase in the percentage of solubilized carbohydrates from the mulberry juice substrate. The digested suspensions underwent dialysis to remove degradation fragments, and a lower quantity of carbohydrate in the enzyme-treated groups compared to the control. Polysaccharide populations with varying molecular weights (Mw) were obtained from the soluble fractions of mulberry residues for subsequent fermentation. An increase in Mw of soluble polysaccharides was detected by HPSEC during fermentation in certain cases. The gut microbiota demonstrated the ability to convert specific insoluble fractions into soluble components, which were subsequently subjected to microbial utilization. Enzymatic treatments during mulberry juice preparation can potentially positively impact health by influencing gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) modulations. Enzymes could serve as valuable tools for producing functional fruit and vegetable juices, with the need to specify processing conditions for specific raw materials remaining a subject of further investigation. metadata Luo, Peihuan; Ai, Jian; Wang, Yuxin; Wang, Songen; Schols, Henk A.; Smidt, Hauke; Battino, Maurizio; Bai, Weibin y Tian, Lingmin mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, maurizio.battino@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Effects of enzymatic treatment on the in vitro digestion and fermentation patterns of mulberry fruit juice: A focus on carbohydrates.

Hence, complementary and alternative treatments for uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) are explored for their efficacy. Therefore, this study determined the therapeutic efficacy and safety of Sesamum indicum Linn seeds with Rosa damascena Mill Oil in uPID with standard control. Additionally, we analyzed the data with machine learning. Materials and methods: We included 60 participants in a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized standard-controlled study. Participants in the Sesame and Rose oil group (SR group) (n = 30) received 14 days course of black sesame powder (5 gm) mixed with rose oil (10 mL) per vaginum at bedtime once daily plus placebo capsules orally. The standard group (SC), received doxycycline 100 mg twice and metronidazole 400 mg thrice orally plus placebo per vaginum for the same duration. The primary outcome was a clinical cure at post-intervention for visual analogue scale (VAS) for lower abdominal pain (LAP), and McCormack pain scale (McPS) for abdominal-pelvic tenderness. The secondary outcome included white blood cells (WBC) cells in the vaginal wet mount test, safety profile, and health-related quality of life assessed by SF-12. In addition, we used AdaBoost (AB), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers in this study to analyze the experimental data. Results: The clinical cure for LAP and McPS in the SR vs SC group was 82.85% vs 81.48% and 83.85% vs 81.60% on Day 15 respectively. On Day 15, pus cells less than 10 in the SR vs SC group were 86.6% vs 76.6% respectively. No adverse effects were reported in both groups. The improvement in total SF-12 score on Day 30 for the SR vs SC group was 82.79% vs 80.04% respectively. In addition, our Naive Bayes classifier based on the leave-one-out model achieved the maximum accuracy (68.30%) for the classification of both groups of uPID. Conclusion: We concluded that the SR group is cost-effective, safer, and efficacious for curing uPID.

Willd. and Cinnamomum camphora (L.) J. Presl. vaginal suppository in addressing heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) and their impact on participants' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) analyzed using machine learning algorithms. Method: A total of 62 participants were enrolled in a double-dummy, single-center study. They were randomly assigned to either the suppository group (SG), receiving a formulation prepared with Acacia arabica gum (Gond Babul) and camphor from Cinnamomum camphora (Kafoor) through two vaginal suppositories (each weighing 3,500 mg) for 7 days at bedtime along with oral placebo capsules, or the tranexamic group (TG), receiving oral tranexamic acid (500 mg) twice a day for 5 days and two placebo vaginal suppositories during menstruation at bedtime for three consecutive menstrual cycles. The primary outcome was the pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBLAC) for HMB, and secondary outcomes included hemoglobin level and SF-36 HRQoL questionnaire scores. Additionally, machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), AdaBoost (AB), naive Bayes (NB), and random forest (RF) classifiers were employed for analysis. Results: In the SG and TG, the mean PBLAC score decreased from 635.322 ± 504.23 to 67.70 ± 22.37 and 512.93 ± 283.57 to 97.96 ± 39.25, respectively, at post-intervention (TF3), demonstrating a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). A higher percentage of participants in the SG achieved normal menstrual blood loss compared to the TG (93.5% vs 74.2%). The SG showed a considerable improvement in total SF-36 scores (73.56%) compared to the TG (65.65%), with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). Additionally, no serious adverse events were reported in either group. Notably, machine learning algorithms, particularly AB and KNN, demonstrated the highest accuracy within cross-validation models for both primary and secondary outcomes. Conclusion: The A. arabica and C. camphora vaginal suppository is effective, cost-effective, and safe in controlling HMB. This botanical vaginal suppository provides a novel and innovative alternative to traditional interventions, demonstrating promise as an effective management approach for HMB. metadata Fazmiya, Mohamed Joonus Aynul; Sultana, Arshiya; Heyat, Md Belal Bin; Parveen, Saba; Rahman, Khaleequr; Akhtar, Faijan; Khan, Azmat Ali; Alanazi, Amer M.; Ahmed, Zaheer; Díez, Isabel de la Torre; Brito Ballester, Julién y Saripalli, Tirumala Santhosh Kumar mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, julien.brito@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Efficacy of a vaginal suppository formulation prepared with Acacia arabica (Lam.)

This disease is not only infectious among humans, but among animals as well. Malaria causes mild symptoms like fever, headache, sweating and vomiting, and muscle discomfort; severe symptoms include coma, seizures, and kidney failure. The timely identification of malaria parasites is a challenging and chaotic endeavor for health staff. An expert technician examines the schematic blood smears of infected red blood cells through a microscope. The conventional methods for identifying malaria are not efficient. Machine learning approaches are effective for simple classification challenges but not for complex tasks. Furthermore, machine learning involves rigorous feature engineering to train the model and detect patterns in the features. On the other hand, deep learning works well with complex tasks and automatically extracts low and high-level features from the images to detect disease. In this paper, EfficientNet, a deep learning-based approach for detecting Malaria, is proposed that uses red blood cell images. Experiments are carried out and performance comparison is made with pre-trained deep learning models. In addition, k-fold cross-validation is also used to substantiate the results of the proposed approach. Experiments show that the proposed approach is 97.57% accurate in detecting Malaria from red blood cell images and can be beneficial practically for medical healthcare staff. metadata Mujahid, Muhammad; Rustam, Furqan; Shafique, Rahman; Caro Montero, Elizabeth; Silva Alvarado, Eduardo René; de la Torre Diez, Isabel y Ashraf, Imran mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, elizabeth.caro@uneatlantico.es, eduardo.silva@funiber.org, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Efficient deep learning-based approach for malaria detection using red blood cell smears.

Such a disease can exists in human eye that can affect one or both eyes is diabetic retinopathy (DR) which can impair function, vision, and eventually result in permanent blindness. It is one of those complex complexities. Therefore, early detection of DR can significantly reduce the risk of vision impairment by appropriate treatment and necessary precautions. The primary aim of this study is to leverage cutting-edge models trained on diverse image datasets and propose a CNN model that demonstrates comparable performance. Specifically, we employ transfer learning models such as DenseNet121, Xception, Resnet50, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3, and machine learning models such as SVM, and neural network models like (RNN) for binary and multi-class classification. It has been shown that the proposed approach of multi-label classification with softmax functions and categorical cross-entropy works more effectively, yielding perfect accuracy, precision, and recall values. In particular, Xception achieved an impressive 82% accuracy among all the transfer learning models, setting a new benchmark for the dataset used. However, our proposed CNN model shows superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.27% on this dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art Xception model. Moreover, for single-label (binary classifications), our proposed model achieved perfect accuracy as well. Through exploration of these advances, our objective is to provide a comprehensive overview of the leading methods for the early detection of DR. The aim is to discuss the challenges associated with these methods and highlight potential enhancements.

Methods Sociodemographic, clinical, and neurocognitive information was considered on 610 FEP patients form the PAFIP cohort (Spain). Baseline and three-year follow-up comparisons were carried out. Chi-square tests and ANCOVA analysis were performed controlling for the effect of age and years of education. Results Men comprised 57.54% of the sample, with only 5.41% having offspring when compared to 36.29% of women. Parenthood was related to shorter duration of untreated illness (DUI) in women with children (12.08 months mothers vs. 27.61 months no mothers), showing mothers better premorbid adjustment as well. Childless men presented the worst premorbid adjustment and the highest cannabis and tobacco consumption rates. Mothers presented better global cognitive function, particularly in attention, motor dexterity and executive function at three-year follow-up. Conclusions Diminished parental rates among FEP men could be suggested as a consequence of a younger age of illness onset. Sex roles in caregiving may explain the potential role of parenthood on premorbid phase, with a better and heathier profile, and a more favorable long-term outcome in women. These characteristics may be relevant when adjusting treatment specific needs in men and women with and without offspring. metadata Díaz-Pons, Alexandre; Soler-Andrés, Marina; Ortiz-García de la Foz, Víctor; Murillo-García, Nancy; Yorca-Ruiz, Angel; Magdaleno Herrero, Rebeca; Castaño-Castaño, Sergio; González-Rodríguez, Alexandre; Setién-Suero, Esther y Ayesa-Arriola, Rosa mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, esther.setien@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Exploring parenthood in first episode of psychosis: the potential role of the offspring in the outcome of women.

Although numerous research applied machine learning methods to forecast signs of depression. Nevertheless, only a limited number of research have taken into account the severity level as a multiclass variable. Besides, maintaining the equality of data distribution among all the classes rarely happens in practical communities. So, the inevitable class imbalance for multiple variables is considered a substantial challenge in this domain. Furthermore, this research emphasizes the significance of addressing class imbalance issues in the context of multiple classes. We introduced a new approach Feature group partitioning (FGP) in the data preprocessing phase which effectively reduces the dimensionality of features to a minimum. This study utilized synthetic oversampling techniques, specifically Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN), for class balancing. The dataset used in this research was collected from university students by administering the Burn Depression Checklist (BDC). For methodological modifications, we implemented heterogeneous ensemble learning stacking, homogeneous ensemble bagging, and five distinct supervised machine learning algorithms. The issue of overfitting was mitigated by evaluating the accuracy of the training, validation, and testing datasets. To justify the effectiveness of the prediction models, balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and f1-score indices are used. Overall, comprehensive analysis demonstrates the discrimination between the Conventional Depression Screening (CDS) and FGP approach. In summary, the results show that the stacking classifier for FGP with SMOTE approach yields the highest balanced accuracy, with a rate of 92.81%. The empirical evidence has demonstrated that the FGP approach, when combined with the SMOTE, able to produce better performance in predicting the severity of depression. Most importantly the optimization of the training time of the FGP approach for all of the classifiers is a significant achievement of this research. metadata Shaha, Tumpa Rani; Begum, Momotaz; Uddin, Jia; Yélamos Torres, Vanessa; Alemany Iturriaga, Josep; Ashraf, Imran y Samad, Md.

The rhythm of production to satisfy the request of the population has become unsustainable and the concept of the linear economy, introduced after the Industrial Revolution, has been replaced by a new economic approach, the circular economy. In this new economic model, the concept of “the end of life” is substituted by the concept of restoration, providing a new life to many industrial wastes. Leaves are a by-product of several agricultural cultivations. In recent years, the scientific interest regarding leaf biochemical composition grew, recording that plant leaves may be considered an alternative source of bioactive substances. Plant leaves’ main bioactive compounds are similar to those in fruits, i.e., phenolic acids and esters, flavonols, anthocyanins, and procyanidins. Bioactive compounds can positively influence human health; in fact, it is no coincidence that the leaves were used by our ancestors as a natural remedy for various pathological conditions. Therefore, leaves can be exploited to manufacture many products in food (e.g., being incorporated in food formulations as natural antioxidants, or used to create edible coatings or films for food packaging), cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries (e.g., promising ingredients in anti-aging cosmetics such as oils, serums, dermatological creams, bath gels, and other products). This review focuses on the leaves’ main bioactive compounds and their beneficial health effects, indicating their applications until today to enhance them as a harvesting by-product and highlight their possible reuse for new potential healthy products. metadata Regolo, Lucia; Giampieri, Francesca; Battino, Maurizio; Armas Diaz, Yasmany; Mezzetti, Bruno; Elexpuru Zabaleta, Maria; Mazas Pérez-Oleaga, Cristina; Tutusaus, Kilian y Mazzoni, Luca mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, francesca.giampieri@uneatlantico.es, maurizio.battino@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, maria.elexpuru@uneatlantico.es, cristina.mazas@uneatlantico.es, kilian.tutusaus@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) From by-products to new application opportunities: the enhancement of the leaves deriving from the fruit plants for new potential healthy products.

Methodological issues concerning the role of archaeological imaging are often implied within those debates. Do the tracings belong to the observational data exposition chapter, or are they part of the interpretative conclusions? How can the current technological scenario help solve these problems? In 2017, we conducted new documentation of the Peña Tu rock shelter, a well-known site with an intriguing post-palaeolithic graphic collection documented on several occasions throughout the twentieth century. Our objective was to provide quantifiable and, if possible, objective documentation of the painted and engraved remnants on the shelter’s surface. To achieve this, we employed two data capture strategies. One strategy focused on analysing the vestiges of paintings using a hyperspectral sensor, while the other centred on the geometric definition of engravings and the rock support, utilising photogrammetric techniques and laser scanning. These approaches presented various parallax challenges. Despite these challenges, our results were highly satisfactory. We resolved uncertainties regarding the formal features of specific designs that had been subject to debate for a long time. Additionally, we discovered previously unpublished areas with traces of paintings. Lastly, we developed a map highlighting recent alterations and deteriorations, providing a valuable tool for assessing the site’s preservation status. In conclusion, by employing advanced technology and comprehensive documentation methods, we significantly contributed to understanding and preserving the prehistoric graphic expressions at the Peña Tu rock shelter. metadata Teira, Luis; Bayarri Cayón, Vicente; Ontañón, Roberto; Castillo, Elena y Arias, Pablo mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, vicente.bayarri@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Geometric and radiometric recording of prehistoric graphic expression: the case of Peña Tu (Asturias, Spain).

Although these models have undeniably contributed to increase our mechanistic understanding of basic biological processes, they do not adequately model complex human physiopathological phenomena, creating concerns about the translatability to humans. During the last decade, extraordinary advancement in stem cell culturing, three-dimensional cell cultures, sequencing technologies, and computer science has occurred, which has originated a wealth of novel human-based and more physiologically relevant tools. These tools, also known as “new approach methodologies,” which comprise patient-derived organoids, organs-on-chip, multi-omics approach, along with computational models and analysis, represent innovative and exciting tools to forward nutrition research from a human-biology-oriented perspective. After considering some shortcomings of conventional in vitro and vivo approaches, here we describe the main novel available and emerging tools that are appropriate for designing a more human-relevant nutrition research. Our aim is to encourage discussion on the opportunity to explore innovative paths in nutrition research and to promote a paradigm-change toward a more human biology-focused approach to better understand human nutritional pathophysiology, to evaluate novel food products, and to develop more effective targeted preventive or therapeutic strategies while helping in reducing the number and replacing animals employed in nutrition research. metadata Cassotta, Manuela; Cianciosi, Danila; Elexpuru Zabaleta, Maria; Elío Pascual, Iñaki; Sumalla Cano, Sandra; Giampieri, Francesca y Battino, Maurizio mail manucassotta@gmail.com, SIN ESPECIFICAR, maria.elexpuru@uneatlantico.es, inaki.elio@uneatlantico.es, sandra.sumalla@uneatlantico.es, francesca.giampieri@uneatlantico.es, maurizio.battino@uneatlantico.es (2024) Human‐based new approach methodologies to accelerate advances in nutrition research.

Traditional models, such as the Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO II), rely heavily on historical and accurate data. In addition, expert judgment is required to set many input parameters, which can introduce subjectivity and variability in the estimation process. Consequently, there is a need to improve the current GSD models to mitigate reliance on historical data, subjectivity in expert judgment, inadequate consideration of GSD-based cost drivers and limited integration of modern technologies with cost overruns. This study introduces a novel hybrid model that synergizes the COCOMO II with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to address these challenges. The proposed hybrid model integrates additional GSD-based cost drivers identified through a systematic literature review and further vetted by industry experts. This article compares the effectiveness of the proposed model with state-of-the-art machine learning-based models for software cost estimation. Evaluating the NASA 93 dataset by adopting twenty-six GSD-based cost drivers reveals that our hybrid model achieves superior accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models. The findings indicate the potential of combining COCOMO II, ANN, and additional GSD-based cost drivers to transform cost estimation in GSD. metadata Ahmed, Mehmood; Ibrahim, Noraini B.; Nisar, Wasif; Ahmed, Adeel; Junaid, Muhammad; Soriano Flores, Emmanuel y Anand, Divya mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, emmanuel.soriano@uneatlantico.es, divya.anand@uneatlantico.es (2024) A Hybrid Model for Improving Software Cost Estimation in Global Software Development.

This study aimed to evaluate the composition profile and the antioxidant capacity of a hydrophilic extract derived from broccoli byproducts, as well as its influence on redox biology, Alzheimer’s disease markers, and aging in the Caenorhabditis elegans model. The presence of glucosinolate was observed and antioxidant capacity was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro acetylcholinesterase inhibitory capacity was quantified, and the treatment ameliorated the amyloid-β- and tau-induced proteotoxicity in transgenic strains via SOD-3 and SKN-1, respectively, and HSP-16.2 for both parameters. Furthermore, a preliminary study on aging indicated that the extract effectively reduced reactive oxygen species levels in aged worms and extended their lifespan.

Quorum quenching (QQ), the enzymatic inhibition of quorum sensing (QS), has emerged as a promising solution. This study delves into the QQ capabilities of the probiotic strain Bacillus velezensis D-18 and its products, particularly in Vibrio anguillarum 507 communication and biofilm formation. Chromobacterium violaceum MK was used as a biomarker in this study, and the results confirmed that B. velezensis D-18 effectively inhibits QS. Further exploration into the QQ mechanism revealed the presence of lactonase activity by B. velezensis D-18 that degraded both long- and short-chain acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs). PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of a homologous lactonase-producing gene, ytnP, in the genome of B. velezensis D-18. The study evaluated the impact of B. velezensis D-18 on V. anguillarum 507 growth and biofilm formation. The probiotic not only controls the biofilm formation of V. anguillarum but also significantly restrains pathogen growth. Therefore, B. velezensis D-18 demonstrates substantial potential for preventing V. anguillarum diseases in aquaculture through its QQ capacity. The ability to disrupt bacterial communication and control biofilm formation positions B. velezensis D-18 as a promising eco-friendly alternative to conventional antibiotics in managing bacterial diseases in aquaculture. metadata Monzón-Atienza, Luis; Bravo, Jimena; Torrecillas, Silvia; Gómez-Mercader, Antonio; Montero, Daniel; Ramos Vivas, Jose; Galindo-Villegas, Jorge y Acosta, Félix mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, jose.ramos@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) An In-Depth Study on the Inhibition of Quorum Sensing by Bacillus velezensis D-18: Its Significant Impact on Vibrio Biofilm Formation in Aquaculture.

The current landscape of basketball coach training shows an increasing demand for innovative training models and emerging pedagogies, including e-learning-based methodologies. The study sample consisted of fifty students from these courses, all above 16 years of age (36 males, 14 females). Among them, 16% resided outside the autonomous community of Cantabria, 10% resided more than 50 km from the city of Santander, 36% between 10 and 50 km, 14% less than 10 km, and 24% resided within Santander city. Data were collected through a Google Forms survey distributed by the Cantabrian Basketball Federation to training course students. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The survey, consisting of 56 questions, was validated by two sports and health doctors and two senior basketball coaches. The collected data were processed and analysed using Microsoft® Excel version 16.74, and the results were expressed in percentages. The analysis revealed that 24.60% of the students trained through the e-learning methodology considered themselves fully qualified as basketball coaches, contrasting with 10.98% of those trained via traditional face-to-face methodology. The results of the study provide insights into important characteristics that can be adjusted and improved within the investigated educational process. Moreover, the study concludes that e-learning training effectively qualifies basketball coaches in Cantabria. metadata Alemany Iturriaga, Josep; Velarde-Sotres, Álvaro; Jorge, Javier y Giglio, Kamil mail josep.alemany@uneatlantico.es, alvaro.velarde@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Influence of E-learning training on the acquisition of competences in basketball coaches in Cantabria.

However, their levels may be influenced by physiological parameters and comorbidities that should be considered before they can be used at the population level. For this purpose, we assessed the influences of different comorbidities on AD plasma markers in 208 cognitively unimpaired subjects. We analyzed both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 using the fully automated Lumipulse platform. The relationships between the different plasma markers and physiological variables were studied using linear regression models. The mean differences in plasma markers according to comorbidity groups were also studied. The glomerular filtration rate showed an influence on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. The amyloid ratio was significantly lower in diabetic and hypertensive subjects, and the mean p-tau181 levels were higher in hypertensive subjects. The glomerular filtration rate may have an inverse relationship on plasma Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels but not on the amyloid ratio, suggesting that the latter is a more stable marker to use in the general population. Cardiovascular risk factors might have a long-term effect on the amyloid ratio and plasma levels of p-tau181. metadata Martínez-Dubarbie, Francisco; Guerra-Ruiz, Armando; López-García, Sara; Irure-Ventura, Juan; Lage, Carmen; Fernández-Matarrubia, Marta; Pozueta-Cantudo, Ana; García-Martínez, María; Corrales Pardo, Andrea; Bravo, María; Martín-Arroyo, Juan; Infante, Jon; López-Hoyos, Marcos; García-Unzueta, María Teresa; Sánchez-Juan, Pascual y Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Eloy mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, andrea.corrales@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Influence of Physiological Variables and Comorbidities on Plasma Aβ40, Aβ42, and p-tau181 Levels in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals.

To achieve these goals, first, microparticles of a propolis extract with inulin as the coating polymer were prepared under the optimal conditions previously determined. Then, a fraction of inulin was replaced with other encapsulating agents, namely sodium alginate, pectin, and chitosan, to obtain different ingredients with controlled release properties in the gastrointestinal tract. The analysis of the phenolic profile in the propolis extract and microparticles showed 58 compounds tentatively identified, belonging mainly to phenolic acid derivatives and flavonoids. Then, the behavior of the free extract and the formulated microparticles under gastrointestinal conditions was studied through an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion process using the INFOGEST protocol. Digestion of the free extract resulted in the degradation of most compounds, which was minimized in the encapsulated formulations. Thus, all developed microparticles could be promising strategies for improving the stability of this bioactive extract under gastrointestinal conditions, thereby enhancing its beneficial effect. metadata Cea-Pavez, Inés; Manteca-Bautista, David; Morillo-Gomar, Alejandro; Quirantes-Piné, Rosa y Quiles, José L. mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, jose.quiles@uneatlantico.es (2024) Influence of the Encapsulating Agent on the Bioaccessibility of Phenolic Compounds from Microencapsulated Propolis Extract during \"In Vitro\" Gastrointestinal Digestion.

These phytochemical compounds have been targeted for their proven antioxidant and protective effects. Recognizing the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), there is a growing interest in understanding the potential cardiovascular benefits associated with these phytochemical compounds. Gut microbiota may play a key role in mediating the effects of isoflavones on vascular and endothelial functions, as it is directly implicated in isoflavones metabolism. The findings from randomized clinical trials indicate that isoflavone supplementation may exert putative effects on vascular biomarkers among healthy individuals, but not among patients affected by cardiometabolic disorders. These results might be explained by the enzymatic transformation to which isoflavones are subjected by the gut microbiota, suggesting that a diverse composition of the microbiota may determine the diverse bioavailability of these compounds. Specifically, the conversion of isoflavones in equol—a microbiota-derived metabolite—seems to differ between individuals. Further studies are needed to clarify the intricate molecular mechanisms behind these contrasting results. metadata Laudani, Samuele; Godos, Justyna; Romano, Giovanni Luca; Gozzo, Lucia; Di Domenico, Federica Martina; Dominguez Azpíroz, Irma; Martínez Díaz, Raquel; Giampieri, Francesca; Quiles, José L.; Battino, Maurizio; Drago, Filippo; Galvano, Fabio y Grosso, Giuseppe mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, irma.dominguez@unini.edu.mx, raquel.martinez@uneatlantico.es, francesca.giampieri@uneatlantico.es, jose.quiles@uneatlantico.es, maurizio.battino@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Isoflavones Effects on Vascular and Endothelial Outcomes: How Is the Gut Microbiota Involved?

Objective:To determine the utility of a newly developed Learning and Associative Memory face test: LAM test. This study examined the relationship between AD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and performance on LAM test, and assessed its potential clinical applicability to detect subtle changes in cognitively healthy subjects at risk for AD. Methods:We studied eighty cognitively healthy volunteers from the Valdecilla cohort. 61% were women and the mean age was 67.34 years (±6.416). All participants underwent a lumbar puncture for determination of CSF biomarkers and an extensive neuropsychological assessment, including performance on learning and associative memory indices of the LAM-test after 30 min and after 1 week, and two classic word lists to assess verbal episodic memory: the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). We analyzed cognitive performance according to amyloid status (A+ versus A–) and to ATN model (A–T–N–; A+T–N–; A+T+N–/A+T+N+). Results:Performance on the LAM-test was significantly correlated with CSF Aβ ratio. A+ participants performed worse on both learning (mean difference = 2.19, p = 0.002) and memory LAM measures than A– (mean difference = 2.19, p = 0.004). A decline in performance was observed along the Alzheimer’s continuum, with significant differences between ATN groups. Conclusions:Our findings suggest that LAM test could be a useful tool for the early detection of subjects within the AD continuum, outperforming classical memory tests. metadata García-Martínez, María; Pozueta-Cantudo, Ana; Lage, Carmen; Martínez-Dubarbie, Francisco; López-García, Sara; Fernández-Matarrubia, Marta; Corrales Pardo, Andrea; Bravo, María; Cavada, Nadia C.; Anuarbe, Pedro; Infante, Jon; López-Higuera, José Miguel; Rodríguez-Cobo, Luis; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, Eloy; Butler, Christopher R. y Sánchez-Juan, Pascual mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, andrea.corrales@uneatlantico.es, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) LAM Test: A New Cognitive Marker for Early Detection in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease.

Among modifiable risk factors, diet quality has been suggested to influence sleep features. The Mediterranean diet is considered a landmark dietary pattern in terms of quality and effects on human health. However, dietary habits characterized by this cultural heritage should also be considered in the context of overall lifestyle behaviors, including sleep habits. This study aimed to systematically revise the literature relating to adherence to the Mediterranean diet and sleep features in observational studies. The systematic review comprised 23 reports describing the relation between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and different sleep features, including sleep quality, sleep duration, daytime sleepiness, and insomnia symptoms. The majority of the included studies were conducted in the Mediterranean basin and reported a significant association between a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a lower likelihood of having poor sleep quality, inadequate sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness or symptoms of insomnia. Interestingly, additional studies conducted outside the Mediterranean basin showed a relationship between the adoption of a Mediterranean-type diet and sleep quality, suggesting that biological mechanisms sustaining such an association may exist. In conclusion, current evidence suggests a relationship between adhering to the Mediterranean diet and overall sleep quality and different sleep parameters. The plausible bidirectional association should be further investigated to understand whether the promotion of a healthy diet could be used as a tool to improve sleep quality. metadata Godos, Justyna; Ferri, Raffaele; Lanza, Giuseppe; Caraci, Filippo; Rojas Vistorte, Angel Olider; Yélamos Torres, Vanessa; Grosso, Giuseppe y Castellano, Sabrina mail SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR, angel.rojas@uneatlantico.es, vanessa.yelamos@funiber.org, SIN ESPECIFICAR, SIN ESPECIFICAR (2024) Mediterranean Diet and Sleep Features: A Systematic Review of Current Evidence.
