        "text": "Female urinary incontinence and sexuality\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMota, Renato Lains\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Urinary incontinence is a common problem among women and it is estimated that between 15 and 55% of them complain of lower urinary symptoms. The most prevalent form of urinary incontinence is associated with stress, followed by mixed urinary incontinence and urge urinary incontinence. It is a symptom with several effects on quality of life of women mainly in their social, familiar and sexual domains. Female reproductive and urinary systems share anatomical structures, which promotes that urinary problems interfere with sexual function in females. This article is a review of both the concepts of female urinary incontinence and its impact on global and sexual quality of life. Nowadays, it is assumed that urinary incontinence, especially urge urinary incontinence, promotes anxiety and several self-esteem damages in women. The odour and the fear of incontinence during sexual intercourse affect female sexual function and this is related with the unpredictability and the chronicity of incontinence, namely urge urinary incontinence. Female urinary incontinence management involves conservative (pelvic floor muscle training), surgical and pharmacological treatment. Both conservative and surgical treatments have been studied about its benefit in urinary incontinence and also the impact among female sexual function. Unfortunately, there are sparse articles that evaluate the benefits of female sexual function with drug management of incontinence.

Oliver; Cartwright, Rufus\n\n2018-01-01\n\nUrinary incontinence symptoms are highly prevalent among women, have a substantial effect on health-related quality of life and are associated with considerable personal and societal expenditure. Two main types are described: stress urinary incontinence, in which urine leaks in association with physical exertion, and urgency urinary incontinence, in which urine leaks in association with a sudden compelling desire to void. Women who experience both symptoms are considered as having mixed urinary incontinence. Research has revealed overlapping potential causes of incontinence, including dysfunction of the detrusor muscle or muscles of the pelvic floor, dysfunction of the neural controls of storage and voiding, and perturbation of the local environment within the bladder. A full diagnostic evaluation of urinary incontinence requires a medical history, physical examination, urinalysis, assessment of quality of life and, when initial treatments fail, invasive urodynamics. Interventions can include non-surgical options (such as lifestyle modifications, pelvic floor muscle training and drugs) and surgical options to support the urethra or increase bladder capacity. Future directions in research may increasingly target primary prevention through understanding of environmental and genetic risks for incontinence.

The urinary incontinence is divided into stress-, urge incontinence and hybrid forms as well as overflow incontinence. The fact that there are increasingly more men over 60 means that the prevalence of the urinary incontinence is up to 40%, and urinary incontinence will increasingly gain importance in daily routine practice. Many investigations and therapies can be realized by the general practitioner. Already simple therapy approaches can lead to a considerable clinical improvement of male urinary incontinence. If the initial therapy fails or pathological results (i.âe. microhaematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, raised residual urine and so on) are found, the patient should be referred to a urologist.\n\nUrinary incontinence in familial dysautonomia.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaini, J; Axelrod, F B; Maayan, C; Stringer, J; Smilen, S W\n\n2003-08-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence in women with familial dysautonomia (FD). A telephone survey was conducted on 68 known surviving female FD patients over 13 years of age registered with the Dysautonomia Centers in the USA and Israel. The mean age of the surveyed group was 27.1+/-9.8 years and 99% of the patients were nulliparous. The overall reported prevalence of urinary incontinence was 82% (n=56). Of the patients with incontinence, 59% (n=33) reported stress incontinence, 11% (n=6) reported urge incontinence, and 30% (n=17) reported symptoms of both, or mixed incontinence. In most women urinary loss was both small and infrequent, but 36% of women (n=20) with incontinence experienced a loss sufficient to necessitate the use of protection (panty liners, pads or diapers); in 7% (n=4) such loss occurred daily. Twelve per cent of all women with FD surveyed experienced primary nocturnal enuresis and 26% experienced nocturia. The prevalence of urinary incontinence is high in young female patients with familial dysautonomia. Neurophysiologic testing in this population may provide a better understanding of the role of the autonomic nervous system in urinary incontinence.\n\nLower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Urinary Incontinence During Pregnancy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalik, GÃ¼lÅah; GÃ¼ven, Emine Seda G; Tekin, YeÅim B; ÅentÃ¼rk, Åenol; KaÄitci, Mehmet; ÃstÃ¼ner, IÅÄ±k; Mete Ural, ÃlkÃ¼; Åahin, Figen K\n\n2016-05-01\n\nLower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) can frequently be seen in pregnant women. Pregnancy and delivery have been considered as risk factors in the occurrence of pelvic floor dysfunction and determinants of LUTS. The main associated risk factor is parity. In the present study, we aim to determine the frequency of LUTS and urinary incontinence (UI) during pregnancy and the associated risk factors. This prospective study was carried out in a total of 250 women during their 28- and 40-gestational week checks. The Urinary Distress Inventory-6, the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7, and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form were used to determine LUTS and its effect on quality of life. The mean age and gestational age of the participants were 29.41 Â± 5.70 year (range 18-44) and 35.45 Â± 2.98 weeks (range 28-40), respectively. The prevalence of LUTS was 81.6%. The prevalence of UI during pregnancy was 37.2%. Stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence and mixed urinary incontinence were diagnosed as 15.6, 4.8 and 16.8%, respectively. We found that advanced age, smoking and multiparity were risk factors associated with incontinence. Incontinence reduced pregnant women's quality of life. Lower urinary tract symptoms are commonly seen among pregnant women and these symptoms negatively affect the quality of life of pregnant women. Advanced age, smoking and multiparity were risk factors associated with urinary incontinence and LUTS. Obstetricians should be on the lookout for individual urological problems in pregnancy. Resolving any urological issues and cessation of smoking for the affected individuals will help alleviate the problem.

Records of women who attended a tertiary urogynecological unit were reviewed retrospectively. A standardized interview included evaluations of symptoms, menopause age (ie, time since last menstrual period or onset of menopausal symptoms), current or previous hormone use, and visual analogue scales for bother. Multichannel urodynamics, including urethral pressure profilometry and determination of abdominal leak point pressure, was performed. Of 382 women seen during the inclusion period, 62% were postmenopausal. Current systemic or local hormone use was reported by 7% and 6%, respectively. Two hundred eighty-eight women (76%) reported symptoms of stress urinary incontinence, with a mean bother of 5.7, and 273 women (72%) reported symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, with a mean bother of 6.4. On univariate analysis, symptoms and bother of urge incontinence were significantly related to menopause age, whereas this relationship was not found for stress incontinence. After calendar age was controlled for, length of menopause showed no significant relationship with any symptom or sign of urinary incontinence. Hormone deficiency after menopause is unlikely to play a major role in urinary incontinence.\n\nThe female urinary microbiome in urgency urinary incontinence.\n\nPubMed\n\nPearce, Meghan M; Zilliox, Michael J; Rosenfeld, Amy B; Thomas-White, Krystal J; Richter, Holly E; Nager, Charles W; Visco, Anthony G; Nygaard, Ingrid E; Barber, Matthew D; Schaffer, Joseph; Moalli, Pamela; Sung, Vivian W; Smith, Ariana L; Rogers, Rebecca; Nolen, Tracy L; Wallace, Dennis; Meikle, Susan F; Gai, Xiaowu; Wolfe, Alan J; Brubaker, Linda\n\n2015-09-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to characterize the urinary microbiota in women who are planning treatment for urgency urinary incontinence and to describe clinical associations with urinary symptoms, urinary tract infection, and treatment outcomes. Catheterized urine samples were collected from multisite randomized trial participants who had no clinical evidence of urinary tract infection; 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was used to dichotomize participants as either DNA sequence-positive or sequence-negative. Associations with demographics, urinary symptoms, urinary tract infection risk, and treatment outcomes were determined. In sequence-positive samples, microbiotas were characterized on the basis of their dominant microorganisms. More than one-half (51.1%; 93/182) of the participants' urine samples were sequence-positive. Sequence-positive participants were younger (55.8 vs 61.3 years old; P = .0007), had a higher body mass index (33.7 vs 30.1 kg/m(2); P = .0009), had a higher mean baseline daily urgency urinary incontinence episodes (5.7 vs 4.2 episodes; P < .0001), responded better to treatment (decrease in urgency urinary incontinence episodes, -4.4 vs -3.3; P = .0013), and were less likely to experience urinary tract infection (9% vs 27%; P = .0011). In sequence-positive samples, 8 major bacterial clusters were identified; 7 clusters were dominated not only by a single genus, most commonly Lactobacillus (45%) or Gardnerella (17%), but also by other taxa (25%). The remaining cluster had no dominant genus (13%). DNA sequencing confirmed urinary bacterial DNA in many women with urgency urinary incontinence who had no signs of infection. Sequence status was associated with baseline urgency urinary incontinence episodes, treatment response, and posttreatment urinary tract infection risk. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Urinary incontinence is a prevalent morbidity experienced by post-stroke patients that is associated with long term disability and institutionalization effects on these patients. An extensive literature review was conducted using multiple academic search engines using the keywords: 'stroke,' 'CVA,' 'urinary incontinence,' 'urodynamics,' 'pharmacologic treatments,' and 'conservative treatments.' Articles were reviewed and summarized to explain incidence, assessment, and treatments of urinary incontinence in post-stroke individuals. Twenty-eight percent to seventy-nine percent of stroke survivors experience urinary incontinence with detrusor overactivity being the most common type of incontinence assessed by urodynamic studies. There continues to be insufficient data studying the effects and benefits of non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments in post-stroke patients. Similarly, urinary incontinence remains an indicator of increased morbidity, disability, and institutionalization rates in the post-stroke patient. Stroke is a debilitating disease which causes urinary incontinence in many patients. As a result, patients have increased rates of hospitalization and disability compared to post-stroke patients without urinary incontinence. The history and physical exam are key in diagnosing the type of urinary incontinence with urodynamic studies being an adjunctive study. Non-pharmacologic treatment, such as behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic agents including antimuscarinics and beta adrenergic medications, are not well studied in the post-stroke patient. Urinary incontinence in stroke patients needs to be further studied to help decrease morbidity and mortality rates within this population.\n\nEffect of weight loss on urinary incontinence in women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWhitcomb, Emily L; Subak, Leslee L\n\n2011-01-01\n\nBackground The purpose of this research was review the epidemiology of the association of obesity and urinary incontinence, and to summarize the published data on the effect of weight loss on urinary incontinence. Methods A literature review of the association between urinary incontinence and overweight/obesity in women was performed. Case series and clinical trials reporting the effect of surgical, behavioral, and/or pharmacological weight loss on urinary incontinence are summarized. Results Epidemiological studies demonstrate that obesity is a strong and independent risk factor for prevalent and incident urinary incontinence. There is a clear dose-response effect of weight on urinary incontinence, with each 5-unit increase in body mass index associated with a 20%â70% increase in risk of urinary incontinence. The maximum effect of weight on urinary incontinence has an odds ratio of 4â5. The odds of incident urinary incontinence over 5â10 years increase by approximately 30%â60% for each 5-unit increase in body mass index. There appears to be a stronger association between increasing weight and prevalent and incident stress incontinence (including mixed incontinence) than for urge incontinence. Weight loss studies indicate that both surgical and nonsurgical weight loss leads to significant improvements in prevalence, frequency, and/or symptoms of urinary incontinence. Conclusion Epidemiological studies document overweight and obesity as important risk factors for urinary incontinence. Weight loss by both surgical and more conservative approaches is effective in reducing urinary incontinence symptoms and should be strongly considered as a first line treatment for overweight and obese women with urinary incontinence.

A cross-sectional community-based study was conducted. A total of 332 women were interviewed; they were seen for whatever reason at the public primary healthcare units of the city of JundiaÃ­, from March 2005 to April 2006. A pre-tested questionnaire was administered and consisted of questions used in the EPINCONT Study (Epidemiology of Incontinence in the County of Nord-Trondelag). Statistical analysis was carried out using the Ï2 test and odds ratio (95%CI). Urinary incontinence was a complaint for 23.5% of the women interviewed. Stress urinary incontinence prevailed (50%), followed by mixed urinary incontinence (35%) and urge incontinence (15%). Being in the age group of 35-64 years, having a body mass index of 30 or greater and having had only vaginal delivery or cesarean section, with uterine contraction, regardless of the number of pregnancies, were factors associated with stress urinary incontinence. However, being in the age group of 55 or older, having a body mass index of 30 or greater and having had three or more pregnancies, only with vaginal deliveries, were factors associated with mixed urinary incontinence. One third of the interviewees complained of some type of urinary incontinence, and half of them presented stress urinary incontinence. Cesarean section, only when not preceded by contractions, was not associated with stress urinary incontinence. The body mass index is only relevant when the stress factor is present.\n\nSacral Nerve Stimulation For Urinary Urge Incontinence, Urgency-Frequency, Urinary Retention, and Fecal Incontinence\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2005-01-01\n\nExecutive Summary Objective The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) to treat urinary urge incontinence, urgency-frequency, urinary retention, and fecal incontinence. Background: Condition and Target Population Urinary urge incontinence, urgency-frequency, urinary retention, and fecal incontinence are prevalent, yet rarely discussed, conditions. They are rarely discussed because patients may be uncomfortable disclosing their symptoms to a health professional or may be unaware that there are treatment options for these conditions. Briefly, urge incontinence is an involuntary loss of urine upon a sudden urge. Urgency-frequency is an uncontrollable urge to void, which results in frequent, small-volume voids. People with urgency-frequency may or may not also experience chronic pelvic pain. Urinary retention refers to the inability to void despite having the urge to void. It can be caused by a hypocontractile detrusor (weak or no bladder muscle contraction) or obstruction due to urethral overactivity. Fecal incontinence is a loss of voluntary bowel control. The prevalence of urge incontinence, urgency-frequency, and urinary retention in the general population is 3.3% to 8.2%, and the prevalence of fecal incontinence is 1.4% to 1.9%. About three-quarters of these people will be successfully treated by behaviour and/or drug therapy. For those who do not respond to these therapies, the options for treatment are management with diapers or pads, or surgery. The surgical procedures are generally quite invasive, permanent, and are associated with complications. Pads and/or diapers are used throughout the course of treatment as different therapies are tried. Patients who respond successfully to treatment may still require pads or diapers, but to a lesser extent. The Technology Being Reviewed: Sacral Nerve Stimulation Sacral nerve stimulation is a procedure where a small device attached to an electrode is\n\nEvaluation of the urinary microbiota of women with uncomplicated stress urinary incontinence.\n\nPubMed\n\nThomas-White, Krystal J; Kliethermes, Stephanie; Rickey, Leslie; Lukacz, Emily S; Richter, Holly E; Moalli, Pamela; Zimmern, Philippe; Norton, Peggy; Kusek, John W; Wolfe, Alan J; Brubaker, Linda\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFemale urinary microbiota are associated with urgency urinary incontinence and response to medication. The urinary microbiota of women with stress urinary incontinence has not been described. We sought to study the cross-sectional relationships between urinary microbiota features and demographic and clinical characteristics of women undergoing stress urinary incontinence surgery. Preoperative urine specimens were collected from women without urinary tract infection and were available from 197 women (174 voided, 23 catheterized) enrolled in a multicenter prospective randomized trial, the Value of Urodynamic Evaluation study. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained including stress and urgency urinary incontinence symptoms, menopausal status, and hormone use. The bacterial composition of the urine was qualitatively assessed by sequencing the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Phylogenetic relatedness and microbial alpha diversity were compared to demographics and symptoms using generalized estimating equation models. The majority of 197 urine samples (86%) had detectable bacterial DNA. Bacterial diversity was significantly associated with higher body mass index (PÂ = .02); increased Medical, Epidemiologic, and Social Aspects of Aging urge index score (PÂ = .04); and hormonal status (P < .001). No associations were detected with stress urinary incontinence symptoms. Increased diversity was also associated with a concomitant lower frequency of Lactobacillus in hormone-negative women. Women undergoing stress urinary incontinence surgery have detectable urinary microbiota. This cross-sectional analysis revealed that increased diversity of the microbiota was associated with urgency urinary incontinence symptoms, hormonal status, and body mass index. In contrast, the female urinary microbiota were not associated with stress urinary incontinence symptoms.

Cases were defined as patients (47) with urinary incontinence symptoms. Controls (50) were defined as patients without urinary incontinence who presented to a tertiary care gynecology clinic for other reasons. Both, cases and controls, completed two questionnaires recommended for the evaluation of symptoms, The Urinary Distress Inventory, and quality of life impact The Urinary Impact Questionnaire. There was a significant correlation between aging (r=0.614; p<0.01), body mass index (r=0.357; p<0.01) and menopause (r= -0.572; p<0.01) and urinary incontinence. All patients had symptoms of stress incontinence, 61.7% had urge incontinence symptoms, 21.3% voiding difficulty and 85.1% dysuria. Ninety-four patients believed that urinary incontinence impaired their quality of life: 50% of patients reported an impaired ability to do household activities, 59.1% avoided social activities, 70.4% reported an impaired ability to travel more than 30 minutes by car or bus, 88.6% avoided leisure activities, 45.5% of patients had impaired emotional health and 34% felt frustrated. The dominant type of urinary incontinence in more than half of the respondents was a mixed type, with moderate to very severe problems.

Methods This is a secondary cohort analysis of 338 obese and overweight women with â¥ 10 weekly episodes of urinary incontinence enrolled in an 18-month randomized clinical trial of a weight loss intervention compared to a structured education program to treat urinary incontinence. Quantities of resources used for incontinence management, including pads, additional laundry, and dry cleaning were reported by participants. Direct costs for urinary incontinence management (âcostâ) were calculated by multiplying resources used by national resource costs (in 2006 U.S. dollars). Randomized groups were combined to examine the effects of change in incontinence frequency on cost. Possible predictors of change in cost were examined using generalized estimating equations controlling for factors associated with change in cost in univariable analyses. Results Mean (Â±SD) age was 53Â±10 years and baseline weight was 97+17 kg. Mean weekly urinary incontinence frequency was 24+18 at baseline and decreased by 37% at 6 months and 60% at 18 months follow-up (both P<0.001). At baseline, adjusted mean cost was $7.76Â±$14 per week, with costs increasing significantly with greater incontinence frequency. Mean cost decreased by 54% at 6 months and 81% at 18 months (both P<0.001). In multivariable analyses, cost independently decreased by 23% for each decrease of seven urinary incontinence episodes per week and 21% for each 5 kg of weight lost (P<0.001 for both). Conclusion In obese and overweight women enrolled in a clinical trial of weight loss for urinary incontinence, incontinence management cost decreased by 81% at 18 months ($327 per woman per year) and was strongly and independently associated with decreasing incontinence frequency\n\nUrinary incontinence in working women: a comparison study.\n\nPubMed\n\nPalmer, Mary H; Fitzgerald, Sheila\n\n2002-12-01\n\nTo compare the findings of two surveys concerning the nature of urinary incontinence and management strategies used by full-time employed working women. The first study was conducted in an urban academic setting with a survey distributed to 2000 women. The second study was conducted with 500 women in a rural pottery manufacturing facility. Twenty-one percent of the women working in an academic setting (group A) and 29% (p = 0.002) of the women working in a manufacturing setting (group B) reported being incontinent of urine at least monthly. More women in group B reported antecedents mixed incontinence (i.e., antecedent to both stress and urge incontinence). More women in group B also used panty liners to manage urine loss (p = 0.003), whereas more women in group A used voiding schedules (p = 0.008) and pelvic muscle exercises (p = 0.04). More women in group A reported that they did not know if their incontinence could improve (40% vs. 1%, p = 0.00). The majority in both groups said that getting treatment was of no or little importance, yet, overwhelmingly, most women (group A 81%; group B 86%) wanted more information about incontinence. Incontinence is a prevalent condition in working women. Discrepancies exist in the nature of the urine loss and strategies used to manage incontinence. Treatment also differs for those women who report urine loss to healthcare providers. Most women want to learn more about incontinence. Secondary prevention strategies need to be tailored and tested to meet symptoms and concerns for women in different work settings.\n\nUrinary incontinence in patients with cystic fibrosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nReichman, Gina; De Boe, Veerle; Braeckman, Johan; Michielsen, Dirk\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOwing to evolution in treatment, the average life expectancy of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) has increased. This has been followed by an increase in urological complications such as urinary incontinence. As stress incontinence occurs during exercise, it may have a negative effect on the implementation of respiratory physiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of urinary incontinence and its effect on the quality of life and physiotherapy in a population with CF. Questionnaires were used to determine the prevalence of incontinence in patients of the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic of the University Hospital in Brussels. Two different surveys were used, depending on the age of the patients (< 12 or â¥ 12 years). The different characteristics of incontinence were emphasized. Questionnaires were completed by 122 participants aged 6-59 years, showing an overall prevalence of 27% for urinary incontinence. Mainly adults reported urinary incontinence, with a prevalence of 11% in men and 68% in women aged 12 and above. The amount of urinary leakage was usually only a few drops and it was mainly triggered by coughing. Many of the participants had never mentioned this symptom to anyone. Doctors' and physical therapists' attention should be drawn to the fact that urinary incontinence is part of the complication spectrum of CF. A quarter of the study population refrained from coughing up phlegm and from physiotherapy. It is important to actively question and inform about this problem, to enable its detection and treatment.\n\nPrevalence of Urinary Incontinence During Pregnancy and Associated Risk Factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nDinÃ§, Ayten\n\n2017-07-04\n\nTo investigate the prevalence of urinary incontinence during pregnancy and associated risk factors. The study is a cross-sectional and descriptive study. A questionnaire was conducted with a total of 750 pregnant women about their urinary incontinence complaints between April and December 2013. The prevalence of urinary incontinence during pregnancy was 300 in 750 (40%). Stress urinary incontinence was the most common type of incontinence during pregnancy. 41.7% of nulliparous women, 38% of primipara women, and 20.3% of multipara women experienced urinary incontinence. Among women reporting UI, 29.3% experienced leakage a few times a day and the amount of leakage was generally (59.7%) moderate. Factors significantly associated with urinary incontinence included age group, gestational age, parity, previous urinary incontinence, constipation, mode of delivery at last childbirth, previous urinary tract infection, body mass index during pregnancy. But on multivariable analysis, the risk factors for urinary incontinence during pregnancy were previous urinary tract infection (ORâ=â3.8, 95%CI 1.5-9.3), constipation (OR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7-5.6) and gestational age (OR 0.5, 95%CI 0.3-0.9). As a result of this study, urinary incontinence is a common condition during pregnancy. Results would help the design of more intensive training programs to prevent incontinence during pregnancy by increasing the awareness about urinary incontinence of healthcare staff engaging in the care of pregnant women.

Baseline clinical diagnoses were compared with Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis diagnoses (criterion validity). Nine-month Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis change scores were compared across treatment groups (responsiveness). Clinical diagnoses included stress (n = 15), urge (n = 26), and mixed urinary incontinence (n = 72). Internal consistency and test-retest reliability estimates were good. Sensitivity and specificity were 85% (95% CI, 75%, 91%) and 71% (95% CI, 51%, 87%), respectively, for stress urinary incontinence and 79% (95% CI, 69%, 86%) and 79% (95% CI, 54%, 94%), respectively, for urge urinary incontinence. The Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis correctly diagnosed urinary incontinence type in 80% of subjects. Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis Stress and Urge scores decreased significantly in treated subjects. The Questionnaire for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis, a new 6-item questionnaire for female urinary incontinence type diagnosis, is reliable and able to diagnose stress urinary incontinence and urge urinary incontinence in a referral urogynecology patient population with accuracy.\n\nFactors Related to Urinary Incontinence among the Malaysian Elderly.\n\nPubMed\n\nEshkoor, S A; Hamid, T A; Shahar, S; Mun, C Y\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUrinary incontinence is a prevalent condition in the elderly that is the spontaneous leakage of urine. It is an age-related problem and increases especially in people aged above 65 years. It can cause many psychological, behavioral, biological, economic and social effects. The treatment of urinary incontinence can reduce morbidity and mortality. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effects of variables including age, ethnicity, gender, education, marital status, body weight, blood elements and nutritional parameters on urinary incontinence among the Malaysian elderly. The study was on 2322 non-institutionalized Malaysian elderly. The hierarchy logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate the risk of independent variables for urinary incontinence among respondents. The findings indicated that approximately 3.80% of subjects had urinary incontinence. In addition, constipation was found a significant factor that increased the risk of urinary incontinence in samples (p=0.006; OR=3.77). The increase in dietary monounsaturated fat (p=0.038; OR=0.59) and plasma triglyceride levels (p=0.029; OR=0.56) significantly reduced the risk of incontinence in subjects. Many of suspected variables including socio-demographic factors, diseases, nutritional minerals, blood components and body weight were non-relevant factors to urinary incontinence in respondents. Constipation increased the risk of urinary incontinence in subjects, and increase in dietary monounsaturated fat and plasma triglyceride levels decreased the risk.\n\nLongitudinal comparison study of pelvic floor function between women with and without stress urinary incontinence after vaginal delivery.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoshida, Mikako; Murayama, Ryoko; Haruna, Megumi; Matsuzaki, Masayo; Yoshimura, Kenichi; Murashima, Sachiyo; Kozuma, Shiro\n\n2013-04-01\n\nTo compare the pelvic floor function between women with and without stress urinary incontinence after vaginal delivery. Seventeen women (age 35.5Â Â±Â 3.5) were prospectively studied at about 6Â weeks, 3 months, and 6Â months after vaginal delivery. Urinary incontinence was assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form. Pelvic floor function was assessed by antero-posterior diameter of the levator hiatus using transperineal ultrasound. Five of 17 women experienced postpartum stress urinary incontinence. The antero-posterior diameter of the levator hiatus at rest was significantly longer in stress urinary incontinent women than in continent women until 3Â months after delivery (pÂ <Â 0.01), though shortening of the antero-posterior diameter of the levator hiatus was not significantly different between continent women and stress urinary incontinent women. Regardless of urinary incontinence, the antero-posterior diameter of the levator hiatus at rest shortened at 6Â months postpartum, compared to 6Â weeks postpartum (pÂ <Â 0.001). The antero-posterior diameter of the levator hiatus during contraction had shortened only in continent women by 6Â months postpartum (pÂ =Â 0.02). The extended pelvic floor may be a cause of stress urinary incontinence in the postpartum period. Therefore, treatment to improve the extended pelvic floor should be developed for the prevention of stress urinary incontinence.\n\n[Drug therapy of female urinary incontinence].\n\nPubMed\n\nHampel, C; Gillitzer, R; Pahernik, S; Melchior, S W; ThÃ¼roff, J W\n\n2005-03-01\n\nDrug treatment for female urinary incontinence requires a thorough knowledge of the differential diagnosis and pathophysiology of incontinence as well as of the pharmacological agents employed. Pharmacotherapy has to be tailored to suit the incontinence subtype and should be carefully balanced according to efficacy and side effects of the drug. Women with urge incontinence require treatment that relaxes or desensitizes the bladder (antimuscarinics, estrogens, alpha-blockers, beta-mimetics, botulinum toxin A, resiniferatoxin, vinpocetine), whereas patients with stress incontinence need stimulation and strengthening of the pelvic floor and external sphincter (alpha-mimetics, estrogens, duloxetine). Females with overflow incontinence need reduction of outflow resistance (baclofen, alpha-blockers, intrasphincteric botulinum toxin A) and/or improvement of bladder contractility (parasympathomimetics). If nocturia or nocturnal incontinence are the major complaints, control of diuresis is obtained by administration of the ADH analogue desmopressin. Future developments will help to further optimize the pharmacological therapy for female urinary incontinence.\n\nUrinary incontinence among female soldiers.\n\nPubMed\n\nDavis, G; Sherman, R; Wong, M F; McClure, G; Perez, R; Hibbert, M\n\n1999-03-01\n\nA self-administered questionnaire was developed to assess the prevalence of urinary incontinence among active duty female soldiers. The questionnaire also addressed basic demographic information, including height, age, weight, and the subjects' present and past military activities. Adaptive measures that the soldiers commonly used to continue exercising and perform their duties were also explored. Seven hundred thirteen questionnaires were handed out to female soldiers at Fort Lewis (Washington), Fort Benning (Georgia), and Fitzsimons Army Medical Center (Colorado) during preparation for physical fitness tests. Of the 563 soldiers (79%) who returned completed questionnaires, 31% indicated that they commonly experienced urinary incontinence during duty and/or training to the extent that it interfered with job performance, hygiene, or was socially embarrassing. Thus, urinary incontinence is a pervasive problem among female soldiers.\n\nConservative Management of Urinary Incontinence in Women\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFaiena, Izak; Patel, Neal; Parihar, Jaspreet S; Calabrese, Marc; Tunuguntla, Hari\n\n2015-01-01\n\nUrinary incontinence in women has a high prevalence and causes significant morbidity. Given that urinary incontinence is not generally a progressive disease, conservative therapies play an integral part in the management of these patients. We conducted a nonsystematic review of the literature to identify high-quality studies that evaluated the different components of conservative management of stress urinary incontinence, including behavioral therapy, bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training, lifestyle changes, mechanical devices, vaginal cones, and electrical stimulation. Urinary incontinence can have a severe impact on our healthcare system and patientsâ quality of life. There are currently a wide variety of treatment options for these patients, ranging from conservative treatment to surgical treatment. Although further research is required in the area of conservative therapies, nonsurgical treatments are effective and are preferred by some patients.

Cross-sectional study conducted at the urogynecology outpatient clinic. The following questionnaires were used for quality of life assessment: Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Short-Form (ICIQ-SF), King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). The study included 556 women. Mixed Urinary Incontinence was the most frequent type (n=348/62.6%), followed by Stress Urinary Incontinence (n=173/31.1%) and Urge Urinary Incontinence (n=35/6.3%). Women with mixed urinary incontinence had greater impact on the general (SF-36) and specific quality of life (KHQ and ICIQ-SF) compared to the others (p<0.05). In the evaluation of sexual function (PISQ-12), there was no difference between groups (p=0.28). All types of urinary incontinence interfere both in the general and specific quality of life, but women with mixed urinary incontinence are the most affected.\n\nValidity and reliability of parental report of frequency, severity and risk factors of urinary tract infection and urinary incontinence in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nSureshkumar, Premala; Cumming, Robert G; Craig, Jonathan C\n\n2006-06-01\n\nWe describe the validity and reliability of a questionnaire designed to determine frequency, severity and risk factors of urinary tract infection and daytime urinary incontinence in primary school-age children. Based on published validated questionnaires and advice from content experts, a questionnaire was developed and piloted in children attending outpatient clinics. Construct validity for parent report of frequency and severity of daytime urinary incontinence was tested by comparison with a daily accident diary in 52 primary school children, and criterion validity of parent report for UTI was verified by comparison with the reference standard (urine culture) in 100 primary school children. Test-retest reliability of the questionnaire was assessed in 106 children from primary schools. There was excellent agreement between the questionnaire and accident diary in severity (weighted kappa 0.94, 95% confidence intervals 0.85 to 1.03) and frequency of daytime urinary incontinence (0.88, 0.7 to 1.0). Parents reported urinary tract infection in 15% of children, compared to a positive urine culture in 8% (sensitivity 100% and specificity 68.5%). Test-retest reliability of the questionnaire was excellent (mean k 0.78, range 0.61 to 1.00). Parents overreport UTI by about 2-fold but can recall frequency and severity of daytime urinary incontinence well during a 3-month period. The developed questionnaire is a valid tool to estimate frequency, severity and risk factors of daytime urinary incontinence and UTI in primary school children.\n\nPrevalence and Characteristics of Urinary Incontinence in a Treatment Seeking Male Prospective Cohort: Results from the LURN Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHelfand, Brian T; Smith, Abigail R; Lai, H Henry; Yang, Claire C; Gore, John L; Erickson, Brad A; Kreder, Karl J; Cameron, Anne P; Weinfurt, Kevin P; Griffith, James W; Lentz, Aaron; Talaty, Pooja; Andreev, Victor P; Kirkali, Ziya\n\n2018-03-01\n\nMale urinary incontinence is thought to be infrequent. We sought to describe the prevalence of urinary incontinence in a male treatment seeking cohort enrolled in the LURN (Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network). Study inclusion and exclusion criteria, including men with prostate cancer or neurogenic bladder, were previously reported. LURN participants prospectively completed questionnaires regarding lower urinary tract symptoms and other clinical variables. Men were grouped based on incontinence type, including 1) no urinary incontinence, 2) post-void dribbling only and 3) urinary incontinence. Comparisons were made using ANOVA and multivariable regression. Of the 477 men 24% reported no urinary incontinence, 44% reported post-void dribbling only and 32% reported urinary incontinence. African American men and those with sleep apnea were more likely to be in the urinary incontinence group than in the no urinary incontinence group (OR 3.2, p = 0.02 and OR 2.73, p = 0.003, respectively). Urinary incontinence was associated with significantly higher bother compared to men without leakage (p <0.001). Compared to men without urinary incontinence and men with only post-void dribbling those with urinary incontinence were significantly more likely to report higher scores (more severe symptoms) on the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) questionnaire regarding bowel issues, depression and anxiety than men without urinary incontinence (p <0.01). Urinary incontinence is common among treatment seeking men. This is concerning because the guideline recommended questionnaires to assess male lower urinary tract symptoms do not query for urinary incontinence. Thus, clinicians may be missing an opportunity to intervene and improve patient care. This provides a substantial rationale for a new or updated symptom questionnaire which provides a more comprehensive symptom assessment.

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2008 were merged to include 5,297 men 20 years old or older. The question, \"Did you ever serve in the Armed Forces of the United States?\" (yes/no) was used to assess military exposure. Urinary incontinence was categorized as any or moderate/severe urinary incontinence vs none. Because the impact of military exposure varied by age, multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the OR and 95% CI stratified by 3 age groups, including 55 or less, 56 to 69 and 70 years or greater. Analysis was adjusted for race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, self-reported health status, number of chronic conditions, depression and prostate conditions, the latter in men 40 years old or older. Overall 23% of male respondents reported military exposure. Men with military exposure were more likely to report any urinary incontinence (18.6% vs 10.4%) and moderate/severe urinary incontinence (9.0% vs 3.1%, each p <0.001) than men without military exposure. After multivariate adjustment in men 55 years old or younger those with military exposure had 3 times greater odds of urinary incontinence (OR 3.28, 95% CI 1.38-7.77). Military exposure did not increase the odds of urinary incontinence in men 56 to 69 years old (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44-2.18), or 70 years old or older (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.55-1.50). Prior military exposure was associated with moderate/severe urinary incontinence in American men 55 years old or younger even after controlling for known risk factors. Case finding is warranted for urinary incontinence in younger men with a history of military service. Copyright Â© 2014 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.

Urinary incontinence after stroke has negative physiological, psychological, and economic effects, which lead to lifestyle changes for both patients and caregivers. Nurses play an important role in preventing and improving incontinence, understanding the experiences of individuals experiencing incontinence, providing healthcare for them, and implementing behavioral therapy methods. The aim of this study was to determine the experience related to urinary incontinence of stroke patients. In this qualitative descriptive study, using semistructured interviews, 15 participants with urinary incontinence after stroke selected through purposeful sampling were interviewed. Data were collected with a semistructured interview form prepared within the framework of the Health Belief Model. All data were analyzed using content analysis. Three main themes were identified: \"perception of urinary incontinence,\" \"effects of urinary incontinence,\" and \"management of urinary incontinence.\" The respondents explained that urinary incontinence also adversely affected their caregivers. They experienced many daily life and psychological problems because of urinary incontinence. In addition, they made several changes to management urinary incontinence such as limiting fluid intake, changing underwear frequently, using waterproof mattress protectors, applying traditional practice, and taking medicine. This study revealed that stroke patients needed help and support for urinary incontinence management. Nurses should provide information about management and urinary incontinence after stroke.\n\nNursing students' knowledge and attitudes toward urinary incontinence: A cross-sectional survey.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuo, Yan; Parry, Monica; Huang, Yan-Jin; Wang, Xiu-Hua; He, Guo-Ping\n\n2016-05-01\n\nNurses must have adequate knowledge to manage the complexities of urinary incontinence. Nursing students are the nurses of the future, yet little is known about urinary incontinence education in undergraduate nursing programs. The aim of this study was (a) to assess the knowledge and attitudes of urinary incontinence held by undergraduate nursing students in China and (b) to explore the relationship between knowledge, attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional survey using cluster random sampling. Undergraduate departments of Nursing within the Faculty of Health Sciences at six Universities, located in different areas of China. A random selection of 6 faculties with a total of 1313 full time undergraduate nursing students completed the survey. Self-reported data were collected using two validated questionnaires, the Urinary Incontinence Knowledge Scale and the Urinary Incontinence Attitude Scale, to access students' knowledge and attitudes toward urinary incontinence. Overall urinary incontinence knowledge was poor (49.9%, 15.0/30) and attitudes about urinary incontinence were generally positive (71.7%, 43.0/60). A high level of interest in learning more about urinary incontinence was found. There was a weak correlation between urinary incontinence knowledge and attitudes (r=0.135, p<0.01). There was also a significant positive correlation between urinary incontinence knowledge and attitudes and nursing students' year of study, urinary incontinence education and training, and formal clinical practicum experience in urology (p<0.05). Chinese nursing students showed poor urinary incontinence knowledge but generally positive attitudes toward urinary incontinence. This study suggests there is a need to examine urinary incontinence content throughout undergraduate nursing curricula in China. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The patients were divided into two groups. The patients in Group I were additionally subdivided into two subgroups with respect to the physiotherapeutic method used. The patients of subgroup IA received a rehabilitation program consisting of three parts. The patients of subgroup IB rehabilitation program consist of two parts. Group II, a control group, had reported for therapy for persistent urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy but had not entered therapy for personal reasons. For estimating the level of incontinence, a 1-hour and 24-hour urinary pad tests, the miction diary, and incontinence questionnaire were used, and for recording the measurements of pelvic floor muscles tension, the sEMG (surface electromyography) was applied. The therapy duration depended on the level of incontinence and it continued for not longer than 12 months. Superior continence outcomes were obtained in Group I versus Group II and the difference was statistically significant. The odds ratio for regaining continence was greater in the rehabilitated Group I and smaller in the group II without the rehabilitation. A comparison of continence outcomes revealed a statistically significant difference between Subgroups IA versus IB. The physiotherapeutic procedures applied on patients with urine incontinence after prostatectomy, for most of them, proved to be an effective way of acting, which is supported by the obtained results.\n\nDiagnostic agreement of the 3 Incontinence Questionnaire to video-urodynamics findings in women with urinary incontinence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOmar, Mohammad Ali; Laniado, Marc\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIntroduction There are limited studies evaluating the 3 Incontinence Questionnaire (3IQ) against urodynamics based diagnosis as a reference standard. The 3IQ has been proposed to be useful to evaluate women at the level of primary care. The aim of this study was to determine correlation between 3IQ and video-urodynamics (VUDS) in diagnosing types of urinary incontinence. Material and methods Prospective data was collected on 200 consecutive female patients referred by primary care physicians for urinary incontinence. The mean age was 55 years (range 15â83 years). The patients were evaluated using the 3IQ and video-urodynamics. The 3IQ-based diagnosis of type of female urinary incontinence was compared to VUDS-based results. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios and positive predictive values were calculated. Results On 3IQ based self-evaluation, 28% of patients were classified as having stress urinary incontinence, 20% with urge incontinence and 40% with mixed incontinence. On video-urodynamics, urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (UDSUI) was detected in 56% of patients, detrusor overactivity (DO) in 15% and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) in 19%. The 3IQ had a sensitivity and specificity respectively of 43% and 92% for UDSUI, 57% and 86% for DO and 58% and 64% for MUI. The corresponding positive likelihood ratios (CI, 95%) were 5.4 (CI 2.6 to 11.3) for stress urinary incontinence, 4.0 (CI 2.5 to 6.5) for DO and 1.62 (1.2 to 2.3) for MUI. The respective positive predictive values were 87% (CI 75% to 95%), 42% (CI 26% to 58%) and 28% (18% to 39%). Conclusions In our study population, stress urinary incontinence was reasonably well predicted by the 3IQ, but the questionnaire under-performed in the diagnoses of detrusor overactivity and mixed urinaryincontinence.

Participants in a NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) sponsored summit reviewed findings from NIH (National Institutes of Health) funded clinical research on urinary incontinence in women and discussed the future of urinary incontinence research. The NIDDK convened the Summit on Urinary Incontinence Clinical Research in Women on March 14, 2014. Participants representing a broad range of clinical expertise reviewed completed NIH sponsored urinary incontinence related studies, including results from community based epidemiological studies such as the BACH (Boston Area Community Health) Survey and from randomized clinical trials such as PRIDE (Program to Reduce Incontinence by Diet and Exercise), and studies conducted by the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network and the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network. BACH Survey results improved our understanding of precursors, incidence, prevalence and natural history of urinary incontinence in a diverse group of women. The Pelvic Floor Disorders Network study found that anticholinergic medications and onabotulinumtoxinA are efficacious for treating urge urinary incontinence, and Burch colposuspension and retropubic mid urethral polypropylene slings are efficacious for decreasing stress urinary incontinence following pelvic organ prolapse surgery in women with potential stress urinary incontinence. The Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network study found that fascial slings were better than colposuspension, and that retropubic and transobturator mid urethral polypropylene slings were equivalent for stress urinary incontinence. In patients with stress urinary incontinence a preoperative urodynamic study was noninferior to basic office examinations for surgical outcome. The addition of behavioral intervention did not allow female patients to discontinue antimuscarinics for urge urinary incontinence.

Between April 2002 and May 2017, a total of 32 patients (median age, 40.8Â years) with urinary incontinence had undergone artificial urinary sphincter placement during urinary tract reconstruction. Eighteen patients (56.3%) were urethral injuries associated urinary incontinence, 9 (28.1%) had neurogenic urinary incontinence and 5 (15.6%) were post-prostatectomy incontinence. Necessary surgeries were conducted before artificial urinary sphincter placement as staged procedures, including urethral strictures incision, sphincterotomy, and augmentation cystoplasty. The mean follow-up time was 39Â months. At the latest visit, 25 patients (78.1%) maintained the original artificial urinary sphincter. Four patients (12.5%) had artificial urinary sphincter revisions. Explantations were performed in three patients. Twenty-four patients were socially continent, leading to the overall success rate as 75%. The complication rate was 28.1%; including infections (nâ=â4), erosions (nâ=â4), and mechanical failure (nâ=â1). The impact of urinary incontinence on the quality of life measured by the visual analogue scale dropped from 7.0âÂ±â1.2 to 2.2âÂ±â1.5 (P <0.001). The primary sources for artificial urinary sphincter implantation in our center are unique, and the procedure is an effective treatment as a part of urinary tract reconstruction in complicated urinary incontinence cases with complex etiology.\n\nUrodynamic study in women with pure stress urinary incontinence.\n\nPubMed\n\nValdevenito, J P; Ãguila, F; Naser, M; ManrÃ­quez, V; Wenzel, C; DÃ­az, J P\n\n2015-03-01\n\nTo describe the results of urodynamic study in women with pure stress urinary incontinence symptoms, including the characteristics of the overactive detrusor. No other clinical assessments were taken into account. A retrospective study in women with urinary incontinence consecutively evaluated by urodynamic study. From a total of 710 women, only 108 (15%) with pure stress urinary incontinence symptoms were selected. Women with prior urinary incontinence surgery, pelvic organ prolapse (stage â¥iii), pelvic radiotherapy, using medication active on the lower urinary tract and neurological diseases were excluded. Infusion rate was 70 ml/min. Detrusor overactivity was induced only by cough. A standardized cough stress test with progressive cough intensity was carried out. Reference urodynamic values for stress incontinent women are described. Urodynamic stress incontinence was observed in 79 women (73.1%), detrusor overactivity in 4 (3.7%) and mixed urodynamic diagnosis in 15 (13.8%). Test was inconclusive in 10 patients (9.2%). Two women had detrusor overactivity incontinence (1.9%). One patient had detrusor overactivity induced by cough without urodynamic stress incontinence (0.9%). There was an association between detrusor overactivity and nocturia â¥2 (P=.002; odds ratio: 3.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.22-11.39). One woman had a bladder outlet obstruction (0.9%). In women with pure stress urinary incontinence, without knowing the outcome of other clinical assessments, urodynamic study can provide useful information to define the proper therapy.

PWS is characterized by mental retardation, short stature, obesity and hypogonadism. The behavioural phenotype includes eating problems, temper outbursts, affective disorders, stereotypies and speech abnormalities. UI is common in children with mental retardation in general, but has not been reported systematically in children with PWS so far. The Dutch version of the 'Parental Questionnaire: Enuresis/Urinary Incontinence' was completed by 118 parents of children with PWS. This questionnaire includes items referring to day- and night-time wetting, toilet habits, observable voiding behaviours and reactions, urinary tract infections, stool habits and behavioural symptoms. The rate of nocturnal enuresis in persons with PWS was 13.6% (16) at a mean age of 15.1 years. 3.8% (5) had additional daytime urinary incontinence, and 3.3% (4) had faecal incontinence. Lower urinary tract symptoms were commonly indicative of overactive bladder, dysfunctional voiding and postponement. Also, the rate of internalizing and externalizing behavioural problems was high. Urinary incontinence is more common in persons with PWS than in typically developing children, adolescents and adults. As lower urinary tract symptoms are common, detailed assessment and specific treatment of UI should be part of the care of all persons with PWS. Â© 2010 THE AUTHORS.

Incidence rises as people age, often because of reduced mobility or conditions affecting the nervous system, such as dementia and stroke. Urinary incontinence can be a distressing condition and can harm a person's physical, financial, social, and emotional well-being. People with urinary incontinence are susceptible to skin irritation, pressure sores, and urinary tract infections. Urinary incontinence is also associated with an increased risk of falls in older adults. This health technology assessment examined the effectiveness of, budget impact of, and patient values and preferences about electronic monitoring systems to assess urinary incontinence for residents of long-term care homes or geriatric hospital inpatients with complex conditions. Methods A clinical evidence review of the published clinical literature was conducted to June 9, 2017. Critical appraisal of the clinical evidence included assessment of risk of bias and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria to reflect the certainty of the evidence. We calculated the funding required for an electronic urinary incontinence monitoring system in the first year of implementation (when facilities would buy the systems) and in subsequent years. We interviewed six people with urinary incontinence and two caregivers, who described ways urinary incontinence affected daily life. Results We included one observational study in the clinical review. Most of the 31 participants in the observational study were female (78%) and required high levels of care, primarily because of cognitive impairment. The quality of evidence for all outcomes was very low owing to potential risk of bias and indirectness. We are consequently uncertain about how electronic monitoring systems affect management of urinary incontinence.

Incidence rises as people age, often because of reduced mobility or conditions affecting the nervous system, such as dementia and stroke. Urinary incontinence can be a distressing condition and can harm a person's physical, financial, social, and emotional well-being. People with urinary incontinence are susceptible to skin irritation, pressure sores, and urinary tract infections. Urinary incontinence is also associated with an increased risk of falls in older adults.This health technology assessment examined the effectiveness of, budget impact of, and patient values and preferences about electronic monitoring systems to assess urinary incontinence for residents of long-term care homes or geriatric hospital inpatients with complex conditions. A clinical evidence review of the published clinical literature was conducted to June 9, 2017. Critical appraisal of the clinical evidence included assessment of risk of bias and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group criteria to reflect the certainty of the evidence.We calculated the funding required for an electronic urinary incontinence monitoring system in the first year of implementation (when facilities would buy the systems) and in subsequent years.We interviewed six people with urinary incontinence and two caregivers, who described ways urinary incontinence affected daily life.

This pilot study investigates the kinds of coping strategies developed by family caregivers of urinary incontinent persons. Therefore, it seeks to explore how family caregivers experience and shape everyday life with an incontinent family member.Based on a qualitative design, problem-centered interviews were carried out with 10 family caregivers (4 men, 6 women) and analyzed according to Grounded Theory.The results show that family caregivers place major emphasis on maintaining continence, which is conceived as an expression of concern for the care-dependent person. The data facilitated the development of four major concepts: incontinence as a cause of dependency, feelings of shame, striving for continence and coping with incontinence. These concepts indicate that family caregivers look for strategies to provide the incontinent family member with the opportunity of (self-) controlled excretion. Yet this kind of support is linked to feelings of shame on both parts.\n\nManagement of urinary incontinence in residential care.\n\nPubMed\n\nLim, David S\n\n2016-07-01\n\nUrinary incontinence is prevalent in residential care and rates are expected to increase with the ageing population in Australia. It contributes to poor quality of life (QoL), functional impairments in activities of daily living, and deterioration of mental and sexual health. Management depends on the type of incontinence, its aetiology, the severity of symptoms, the effects on QoL, and patient factors. Treatment options include active treatment and passive containment. However, not all active treatment options are feasible in residential care. There is little evidence to advise on standard best practice. The aims of this article are to review treatment options for urinary incontinence in residential care, feasibility of service delivery and challenges associated with this. A greater understanding of the issues surrounding the management of urinary incontinence in residential care is required to deliver satisfactory patient-centred care on a consistent basis.\n\n[Prevalence and associated factors of female urinary incontinence in Hebei province].\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Y; Yan, L; Du, F D; Zheng, P T; Zhang, L; Jiang, L; Huang, X H\n\n2016-12-25\n\nObjective: To estimate the prevalence and associated factors of adult female urinary incontinence in Hebei province. Methods: Stratified and multistage sampling method was used, between January 2016 to May 2016, to investigate the target population in Hebei province. While, logistic regression was used to analyse datas. Results: A population-based survey was conducted in 2 450 women in Hebei province, there were 2 408 effective questionnaires after deleting 48 invalid questionnaires. According to the results, the average age of subjects was (56Â±15) years old, and the urinary incontinence prevalence of adult female in Hebei province was 27.70% (667/2 408). Stress urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence and mixed urinary incontinence were diagnosed as 23.13% (557/2 408), 1.58% (38/2 408) and 2.99% (72/2 408), respectively. There were only 2.85% (19/667) urinary incontinence patients seeking medical help. The results of logistic regression analysis showed that age, daily water intake, pulmonary diseases, urinary tract infection, hypertension, chronic low back pain, dysmenorrhea, vaginitis, abortion, mode of delivery, postpartum infection were statistically significant (all P â¤0.05). Among these factors, cesarean section was the protective factor for urinary incontinence ( OR= 0.365, 95 % CI: 0.195-0.685, P <0.01). Conclusions: The prevalence of urinary incontinence in adult female in Hebei province is high, and there are few patients seeking medical help. It is a common disorder in women and is associated with many factors; among these factors, cesarean section is the protective factor for urinary incontinence.\n\nMidurethral Slings for Women with Stress Urinary Incontinence\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2006-01-01\n\nliterature published between January 2000 and February 2006 was searched in the following databases: OVID Medline, In Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CENTRAL, INAHTA. The database search was supplemented with a search of relevant Web sites, and a review of the bibliographies of selected papers. The search strategy can be viewed in Appendix 1. Inclusion Criteria General population with SUI Randomized controlled studies, health technology assessments, guidelines Female subjects Midurethral, self-fixing, and minimally invasive slings/tapes English language The search strategy yielded 391 original citations. Studies were excluded for a variety of reasons, such as using traditional, suburethral slings as opposed to midurethral slings, not including patients with stress urinary incontinence, including males in the study, case reports, and not reporting the outcomes of interest. There were 13 randomized controlled trials identified that compared midurethral slings to other midurethral slings or traditional surgery. (8-20) (Table 1) Three of the randomized controlled trials (15;17;20) have had subsequent updated articles of longer term results. (21-23) The results of the randomized controlled trials have been stratified into 2 groups: TVT versus colposuspension and comparisons of midurethral slings. No randomized controlled trials were identified that compared a midurethral sling other than TVT to colposuspension. Summary of Findings Effectiveness At this time, there does not appear to be one procedure that is more effective than another at curing stress urinary incontinence. TVT appears to have similar cure rates to open colposuspension; and the various midurethral sling types seem to have similar cure rates. Procedure Time and Length of Hospital Stay The procedure time and the length of hospital stay for TVT are significantly shorter than the procedure time and length of stay for colposuspension.

METHODS We included 7,270 women from the 2005â2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, stratified into three groups of glycemic control defined by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): i) those below the diagnostic threshold (HbA1c<6.5%), ii) those with relatively controlled diabetes (HbA1c 6.5â8.5%), and iii) those with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c>8.5%) to allow for a different relationship between glycemic control and urinary incontinence within each group. The primary outcomes were the presence of any, only stress, only urgency, and mixed urinary incontinence. We calculated adjusted risk ratios using Poisson regressions with robust variance estimates. RESULTS The survey-weighted prevalence was 52.9% for any, 27.2% for only stress, 9.9% for only urgency, and 15.8% for mixed urinary incontinence. Among women with relatively controlled diabetes, each one-unit increase in HbA1c was associated with a 13% (95% CI: 1.03â1.25) increase for any urinary incontinence and a 34% (95% CI 1.06â1.69) increase in risk for only stress incontinence but was not significantly associated with only urgency and mixed incontinence. Other risk factors included body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, smoking, and physical activity. CONCLUSIONS Worsening glycemic control is associated with an increased risk for stress incontinence for women with relatively controlled diabetes. For those either below the diagnostic threshold or with poorly controlled diabetes, the risk may be driven by other factors. Further prospective investigation of HbA1c as a modifiable risk factor may motivate measures to improve continence in women with diabetes.

We retrospectively investigated the medical records of patients housed in facilities for patients with autistic disorder with mental retardation. Those who had undergone a medical examination at a hospital in Tokyo from April 1999 to March 2009 were included in the study.Retrospective data were gathered including age, sex, IQ, birth weight, dosage of risperidone, urinary density, as well as existence of urinary and fecal incontinence. We divided the participants into those who did and did not experience urinary incontinence after taking risperidone and compared the 2 groups. Risperidone had been prescribed to 35 patients. In spite of the fact that no patient had a history of urinary incontinence, 14 patients experienced urinary incontinence after receiving risperidone. Moreover, 4 of these 14 patients also had fecal incontinence. Among the variables we examined, the only significant difference between groups was in sex, with significantly more women experiencing incontinence compared with men. When the dose of risperidone was reduced or the patients switched to other drugs, urinary incontinence of the patients improved.Hence, risperidone may have a casual relationship with urinary incontinence. Further research is needed to understand the pathophysiology of possible effect.\n\nEffects of stigma on Chinese women's attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Cuili; Li, Jingjing; Wan, Xiaojuan; Wang, Xiaojuan; Kane, Robert L; Wang, Kefang\n\n2015-04-01\n\nTo examine whether and how stigma influences attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence, and whether its effect varies by symptom severity. Urinary incontinence is prevalent among women, but few seek treatment. Negative attitudes towards urinary incontinence treatment inhibit from seeking care. Urinary incontinence is a stigmatised attribute. However, the relationship between stigma and attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence has not been well understood. This was a cross-sectional community-based study. We enrolled a sample of 305 women aged 40-65 years with stress urinary incontinence from three communities in a Chinese city between May-October in 2011. Data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, urinary incontinence symptoms, stigma and attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence using a self-reported questionnaire. Effects of stigma were analysed using path analysis. Attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence were generally negative. For the total sample, all the stigma domains of social rejection, social isolation and internalised shame had direct negative effects on treatment-seeking attitudes. The public stigma domain of social rejection also indirectly affected treatment-seeking attitudes through increasing social isolation, as well as through increasing social isolation and then internalised shame. The final model accounted for 28% of the variance of treatment-seeking attitudes. Symptom severity influenced the strength of paths: the effect of internalised shame was higher in women with more severe urinary incontinence. Stigma enhances the formation of negative attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence; public stigma affects treatment-seeking attitudes through internalisation of social messages. Stigma reduction may help incontinent women to form positive treatment-seeking attitudes and engage them in treatment.

Pelvic floor muscles suffer significant trauma throughout pregnancy and childbirth, which may sometimes lead to urinary incontinence postpartum. However, it is uncertain how effective pelvic floor muscle exercises are in treating this incontinence. Several trials have been analysed to try to understand this question. Issues such as when the exercises were undertaken, how often they were performed and in what circumstances they were carried out, have all been considered. While it is still uncertain whether they are effective in reducing urinary incontinence postpartum, as they are non-invasive and fairly simple to carry out, they are still the first-line management for urinary incontinence postpartum with other treatments being considered if this is ineffective.\n\nThe greatest taboo: urinary incontinence as a source of shame and embarrassment.\n\nPubMed\n\nElenskaia, Ksenia; Haidvogel, Karin; Heidinger, Christine; Doerfler, Daniela; Umek, Wolfgang; Hanzal, Engelbert\n\n2011-10-01\n\nWhile urinary incontinence is often labeled as a taboo in the literature, we found no scientific data addressing this issue exclusively. The aim of our study was to measure the perception of urinary incontinence as a taboo and how this compares to other medical conditions that may be embarrassing. 150 test persons completed a self-administered 13-item questionnaire about perception and knowledge of urinary incontinence. Data were analysed with the SPSS 10.0.5 software package using the U-test, Chi-square-test, Yates-correction, Fisher's exact test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Eighty-six (60.6%) of 142 respondents thought that urinary incontinence constituted a taboo in Austria. To be incontinent was considered significantly more embarrassing than depression or cancer, respectively (p = 0.001). Despite its high prevalence, urinary incontinence is still considered a taboo in up to 60% of our Austrian test persons. The level of shame and embarrassment of urinary incontinence is significantly higher than that of depression and cancer.\n\nBony Pelvis Dimensions in Women With and Without Stress Urinary Incontinence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBerger, Mitchell B.; Doumouchtsis, Stergios K.; DeLancey, John O.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAIMS To test the null hypothesis that bony pelvis dimensions are similar in women with and without stress urinary incontinence, both in the postpartum and midlife periods. METHODS Secondary analyses were performed of two case-control studies comparing women with stress urinary incontinence to asymptomatic controls. One study examined primiparas in the first 9â12 months postpartum; the other study involved middle-aged women. Stress urinary incontinence was confirmed by full-bladder stress test. All subjects underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. The interspinous and intertuberous diameters, subpubic angle and sacrococcygeal joint-to-the inferior pubic point distance were measured from the images independently by two authors. RESULTS In the young cohorts, we compared primiparas with de novo postpartum stress urinary incontinence to both continent primiparas and nulliparas. Postpartum stress urinary incontinence is associated with a wider subpubic angle. There is also a trend towards wider interspinous and intertuberous diameters in the stress-incontinent primiparas as compared to the continent cohorts, although this did not reach statistical significance with our sample sizes. By contrast, no significant differences in bony pelvis dimensions were identified when comparing middle-aged women with stress urinary incontinence and their continent controls. CONCLUSIONS Bony pelvis dimensions are different in women with stress urinary incontinence than in matched continent controls. However, these differences are only identified in young primiparas in the postpartum period, not in middle-aged women.

Urinary incontinence (UI) is the most bothersome lower urinary tract symptom; however, in the literature, reports regarding urinary dysfunction and/or incontinence among hyperthyroid patients are scarce. This population-based cohort study aimed to examine the relationship between hyperthyroidism in women and the risk of developing UI in Taiwan. This study used data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. For this study, 10,817 female patients diagnosed with hyperthyroidism from 2001 to 2005 were recruited together with a comparison cohort of 54,085 matched enrollees who did not have a history of hyperthyroidism. All patients were tracked for a 3-year period from their index date to identify those who had a subsequent UI. The stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to compute the risk of UI between study and comparison cohorts. During the follow-up period, of 64,169 patients, 173 (1Â·60%) from the hyperthyroidism group and 560 (1Â·04%) from the comparison group, had a diagnosis of UI. The regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for monthly income, geographic region, urbanization level of the community in which the patient resided, obesity and hysterectomy, patients with hyperthyroidism were more likely to have UI during the 3-year follow-up period than the comparison patients (hazard ratio = 1Â·54; 95% CI = 1Â·30-1Â·83; P < 0Â·001). Our results suggest an increased risk of UI in patients with hyperthyroidism at the 3-year follow-up.

Between November 2001 and December 2005, 126 patients with USI were surveyed in our hospital using the King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ), which is a specific instrument to measure the quality of life among female patients with urinary incontinence (UI). The mean age of patients was 57.09 aÃ±os (SD: 9.57) and the mean BMI was 28.14 Kg/m2 (SD: 4.66). The mean evolution of UI was 114.48 months, with a median of 96 months. During the last week of the study period, a total of 73 women (57.94%) had more than 10 urine leaks a day. As regards the number of sanitary towels used a day, 82.5% (104 cases) stated they used less than 6. The urodynamic diagnosis was described as normal in 8 cases (6.3%), 16 cases (12.7%) were diagnosed as mixed urinary incontinence and, finally, 102 cases (81%) suffered genuine USI. The best scores were presented in the Personal Relationships scale with a mean score of 26.8, whereas the worse scores were noted in that of Impact of Urinary Incontinence, whose mean score was 82.96. Generally, the lowest scores (better quality of life) were obtained in the youngest age groups. Scores in the scales of General Health, Impact on daily activities, Impact on physical activity, Impact on social activity and Emotions, were significantly higher in patients who had undergone a histerectomy. Patients whose evolution of urinary incontinence was longer presented lower scores in the Personal Relationships scale (r=0.179; p=0.045). The quality of life of female patients with U.I. is affected, which limits both their physical activity and image. Their quality of life worsens with age, a greater extent of incontinence, greater urinary symptomatology and when episodes of urinary infection are associated.\n\nThe \"costs\" of urinary incontinence for women.\n\nPubMed\n\nSubak, Leslee L; Brown, Jeanette S; Kraus, Stephen R; Brubaker, Linda; Lin, Feng; Richter, Holly E; Bradley, Catherine S; Grady, Deborah\n\n2006-04-01\n\nTo estimate costs of routine care for female urinary incontinence, health-related quality of life, and willingness to pay for incontinence improvement. In a cross-sectional study at 5 U.S. sites, 293 incontinent women quantified supplies, laundry, and dry cleaning specifically for incontinence. Costs were calculated by multiplying resources used by national resource costs and presented in 2005 United States dollars (2005). Health-related quality of life was estimated with the Health Utilities Index. Participants estimated willingness to pay for 25-100% improvement in incontinence. Potential predictors of these outcomes were examined using multivariable linear regression. Mean age was 56 +/- 11 years; participants were racially diverse and had a broad range of incontinence severity. Nearly 90% reported incontinence-related costs. Median weekly cost (25%, 75% interquartile range) increased from 0.37 dollars (0, 4 dollars) for slight to 10.98 dollars (4, 21 dollars) for very severe incontinence. Costs increased with incontinence severity (P < .001). Costs were 2.4-fold higher for African American compared with white women (P < .001) and 65% higher for women with urge compared with those having stress incontinence (P < .001). More frequent incontinence was associated with lower Health Utilities Index score (mean 0.90 +/- 0.11 for weekly and 0.81 +/- 0.21 for daily incontinence; P = .02). Women were willing to pay a mean of 70 dollars +/- 64 dollars per month for complete resolution of incontinence, and willingness to pay increased with income and greater expected benefit. Women with severe urinary incontinence pay 900 dollars annually for incontinence routine care, and incontinence is associated with a significant decrement in health-related quality of life. Effective incontinence treatment may decrease costs and improve quality of life. III.\n\nAnti-diuresis in the management of daytime urinary incontinence\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRobinson, D.; Cardozo, L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nUrinary incontinence and lower urinary tract dysfunction, whilst not life threatening conditions, remain an important cause of morbidity in women and are responsible for significant impairment of quality of life. Drug therapy is often used to treat women who complain of urgency and urge incontinence and has an emerging role in the management of stress urinary incontinence. However, bothersome side effects are known to affect compliance and therefore compromise efficacy, making longterm drug therapy unpopular. The principle aim of this thesis is to assess the role of antidiuresis in women complaining of daytime urinary incontinence and also to examine its role as a âdesigner therapyâ which women can choose to use as, or when, required. In addition both the patientsâ and cliniciansâ attitudes towards treatment have been studied to clarify the meaning of âcureâ, and to determine treatment acceptability, overall outcome and patient satisfaction. In the first study the patientsâ concept of cure is explored as well as their expectations regarding treatment and outcome. The second study examines cure from the clinicianâs perspective in addition to reviewing outcome measures in the clinical and research settings. Finally in the third study the use of desmopressin in women complaining of daytime urinary incontinence is reported.
