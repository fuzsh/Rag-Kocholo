        "text": "Physical activity is associated with improved breast cancer survival, but the underlying mechanisms, possibly including modification of the inflammatory state, are not well understood. We analyzed changes in interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and TNF-α in a randomized controlled trial of exercise in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors. Seventy-five women, recruited through the Yale-New Haven Hospital Tumor Registry, were randomized to either a six-month aerobic exercise intervention or usual care. Correlations were calculated between baseline cytokines, adiposity, and physical activity measures. Generalized linear models were used to assess the effect of exercise on IL-6, CRP, and TNF-α. At baseline, IL-6 and CRP were positively correlated with body fat and body mass index (BMI) and were inversely correlated with daily pedometer steps (P &lt; 0.001). We found no significant effect of exercise on changes in inflammatory marker concentrations between women randomized to ...\n\nBackground: Moderate-intensity physical activity has been associated with a lower risk of chronic diseases such as breast cancer. Low-grade chronic inflammation is associated with metabolic disorders and cancer. Purpose: We evaluated the association between self-reported moderate-intensity physical activity and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in women with and without breast cancer. Methods: We studied a random subsample of 352 cases and 381 controls obtained from a large population based case-control study. An in-person interview, anthropometric measurements and blood samples were obtained. For the analyses, multiple linear regression models were used. Results: In controls, there was a negative association between moderate-intensity physical activity and serum levels of IL-6 and CRP (β =-0.0041, 95% CI-0.0079 to-0.0003; β =-0.0088, 95% CI-0.0172 to-0.0005, respectively); no association was found with serum TNF-α levels. In cases, no statistically significant associations were found. Conclusions: Engaging in moderate-intensity physical activity was independently associated with lower serum concentrations of IL-6 and CRP only in women without breast cancer. Prospective studies are required in order to understand in which moment this association is lost.\n\nTo determine immune response to acute moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in breast cancer (BrCa) survivors compared with healthy controls. 15 sedentary females were age-matched to 21 BrCa survivors and performed 30 minutes of intermittent exercise at 60% wattage achieved at VO2peak. Hematological data was obtained, and immune cells were isolated from whole blood samples at rest and following exercise. All leukocyte populations significantly increased from pre to immediately post-exercise (P &lt; 0.001) and returned to baseline values 1-hour post-exercise (P &lt; 0.001). Exercise and recovery patterns from leukocytes, leukocyte subsets, and plasma volume shifts were similar between groups, except lymphocyte counts, which were significantly higher in controls (P &lt; 0.001). BrCa survivors displayed similar immune responses to 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise to that of physically similar women without a history of cancer diagnosis. Although the results of this study are pre...\n\nSeveral sources of evidence indicate that exercise during and after breast cancer could positively modulate the tumor microenvironment. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the effects of exercise training on mediators of inflammation in breast cancer survivors. We searched for randomized controlled trials published from January 1990 to March 2014. An inverse variance method of meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model in the presence of statistical heterogeneity. Eight high-quality trials (n = 478) were included. Exercise improved the serum concentrations of IL6 [weighted mean difference (WMD) = −0.55 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval (CI), −1.02 to −0.09], TNFα (WMD = −0.64 pg/mL; 95% CI, −1.21 to −0.06), IL8 (MD = −0.49 pg/mL; 95% CI, −0.89 to −0.09), and IL2 (WMD = 1.03 pg/mL; 95% CI, 0.40 to 1.67). No significant differences were found in the serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (WMD = −0.15; 95% CI, −0.56 to 0.25) or IL10 (WMD = 0.41; 95% CI, −0.18 to 1.02)....\n\nBackground Exercise interventions in order to improve disease-related symptoms and improve quality of life in cancer patients are an approach that has received a lot of attention in recent years. The aim of our study is to investigate the effect of aerobic exercise on cancer recovery and to determine the change of cancer markers before and after treatment. Methods 70 women between 18–65 years were included in this study during chemotherapy. They were part of two groups; aerobic exercise (Group I) and control (Group II) groups. Their demographic features, quality of life and some cancer markers were evaluated. Assessments were done pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy. In aerobic exercise group third a week aerobic exercises on submaximal level applied. A 12-week exercise program was planned, conducted under the supervision of a physiotherapist. Results As a result of this study, the quality of life in the aerobic exercise group was significantly higher in breast cancer patients re...\n\nThe role of exercise therapy in the rehabilitation of cancer patients and survivors is becoming increasingly important as it is thought to modulate immunity and inflammation. More knowledge about the effects of exercise on immune function in these patients is needed. Our aim is to systematically review changes in immune parameters after acute and chronic exercise in cancer patients. Of the 3586 retrieved articles, 21 met the inclusion criteria, and were included in this systematic review. The systematic search yielded 18 articles in adults, and three in children. Six were of low methodological quality, mainly due to lack of blinding of the assessor and high drop-out rates. The effect of chronic exercise on immune function was examined in 18 studies, while two studies evaluated the effects of acute exercise, and one study combined acute and chronic exercise. Following exercise, increases were seen in Natural Killer cytotoxic activity, as well as lymphocyte proliferation and the numbe...\n\nCurrently, breast cancer accounts for a quarter of all cancers and 15% of cancer-specific deaths amongst females. The global occurrence of breast cancer has increased in the last decade whilst the mortality rate has decreased. Exercise can be beneficial to breast cancer patients through changes in adiposity and immune responses. Even though there is some evidence supporting the improvement of fat metabolism and immune function after an exercise program in breast cancer, randomized controlled studies are limited and require further comprehensive analysis in this population group. Herein, we identify the known effects of exercise programs on adiposity and immunological markers which can improve breast cancer outcomes."
