        "text": "Posted by African Examiner Featured, Latest Headlines, Sports News\n\n(AFRICAN EXAMINER) – Nigeria’s senior male basketball team, the D’Tigers, on Wednesday lost their second Group B match in the men’s basketball event of the ongoing 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe D’Tigers fell apart in the fourth quarter of their second game at the Tokyo Olympics to lose 92–99 to Germany.\n\nComing from a disappointing loss to Australia, D’Tigers secured the first basket via Miami Heat point-guard, Gabe Vincent.\n\nThey went on to accumulated most of their points via three-pointers, an improvement from the performance in their first game.\n\nGermany, also having suffered a first match loss to Italy, made it an end-to-end game inspired by Orlando Magic’s Moritz Wagner and Danilo Barthel.\n\nBoth teams were tied at half-time (50-50) and at the end of the third quarter (74-74) making it a frantic fourth quarter where Germany took the game beyond Nigeria.\n\nNigeria at some point in the game led with as much as twelve points but didn’t do enough defensively, giving away fouls the Germans easily converted from the free-throw line.\n\nJohnannes Voigtmann scored 19 points, and Germany used a 14-0 run in the final minutes to pull away and beat Nigeria 99-92.\n\nMoritz Wagner scored 17 points, while Danilo Barthel scored 14, Maodo Lo had 13 and Andreas Obst finished with 12 for Germany (1-1).\n\nBarthel was subbed in after Wagner got his fourth foul late in the third quarter — and he made a big impact.\n\nHe was 4 for 4 from the field in the final period, including the basket that started the 14-0 run which broke an 81-81 tie and put the Germans on top for good.\n\nJordan Nwora scored 33 points for Nigeria (0-2), while Miye Oni scored 15. Nigeria made 17 three-pointers, but were outscored 19-7 from the foul line.Each team let double-digit leads slide.\n\nGermany started the game on a 22-12 run; Nigeria responded with a 15-2 burst to take a 27-24 lead early in the second quarter. And then it was Nigeria’s turn to grab and cede control.\n\nA 16-5 run to open the second half put the D’Tigers up 11, but Niels Giffey’s three-pointer rattled in as the third-quarter horn sounded and sent the teams into the final period tied at 74.\n\nThe lead changed hands five times in the opening minutes of the final quarter, before Germany put together the decisive run.\n\nThey ended up taking a big step towards qualifying for next week’s knockout stage.\n\nBoth teams will finish their round-robin Group B schedule on Saturday.\n\nNigeria will face Italy on Saturday as their chances of qualifying for the next round now hang in the balance, while Germany take on Australia.(NAN)"
