        "text": "The Czech Republic is headed to the second round of the World Cup, and Turkey’s collapse is complete.\n\nVojtech Hruban scored 18 points, Ondrej Balvin finished with 17 points and 11 rebounds and the Czechs beat Turkey 91-76 in Shanghai yesterday to take the second and final second-round spot from Group E.\n\nPatrick Auda also scored 16 points for the Czechs (2-1).\n\n“We fought hard and in the end we wanted this game more than anybody else,” Balvin said.\n\nCedi Osman scored 24 points and Furkan Korkmaz added 16 for Turkey (1-2), which came within one-tenth of a second of beating the United States on Tuesday and wasted a five-point lead in overtime of that game before losing 92-91.\n\nThat meant Thursday’s matchup was win-or-else for Turkey and the Czech Republic — and the Czechs held the lead for most of the second half.\n\nMelih Mahmutoglu’s 3-pointer with 8:29 left got Turkey within 69-66, but the Czechs scored the next eight points and kept control the rest of the way. The Czechs, who outrebounded Turkey 41-26, will play Brazil in their second-round opener on Saturday.\n\n“We are very sorry,” Turkish assistant coach Recep Sen said after the second of two disappointing losses. MDT/AP\n\nMatches\n\nCANADA 82, SENEGAL 60\n\nCanada picked up its first victory in its final Group H game, and Senegal remained winless in three games. Both teams moved into the consolation round, playing for 17th to 32nd place. Cory Joseph of the Sacramento Kings led Germany with 24 points and Kevin Pangos added 13 with five rebounds and five assists. Mouhammad Faye had 14 as Senegal’s top scorer.\n\nBRAZIL 84, MONTENEGRO 73\n\nBrazil finished 3-0 to top Group F and moved into the second round. Montenegro lost all three and is headed to consolation-round play. Brazil had three players in double figures: Marcelinho Huertas with 16 points, Marquinhos Sousa with 13, and Alex Garcia with 11. Derek Needham led Montenegro with 16 points and 10 assists.\n\nGERMANY 96, JORDAN 62\n\nGermany salvaged a victory in its last Group G match, and Jordan finished winless. Both move into the consolation round. Max Kleber of the Dallas Mavericks led the Germans with 18 points and Danilo Barthel had 13. Ahmad Al Dwairi had 17 points and eight rebounds to lead Jordan. Dar Tucker added 14.\n\nCHINA 59, VENEZUELA 72\n\nA spirited Venezuela defeated China 72-59 on Wednesday, a second straight loss for the hosts that means they failed to advance to the second round. The team also lost in overtime to Poland on Monday. “Again this is a very tough loss,” China coach Li Nan said, speaking through an interpreter. “We put in a lot effort to get ready.”\n\nFRIDAY SCHEDULE\n\nSECOND ROUND\n\nGroup I: Poland (3-0) vs. Russia (2-1); Argentina (3-0) vs Venezuela (2-1)\n\nGroup J: Serbia (3-0) vs. Puerto Rico (2-1); Spain (3-0) vs. Italy (2-1)\n\nCLASSIFICATION ROUND\n\nGroup M: Nigeria (1-2) vs. Ivory Coast (0-3); China (1-2) vs. Korea (0-3)\n\nGroup N: Angola (1-2) vs. Iran (0-3); Tunisia (1-2) vs. Philippines (0-3)"
