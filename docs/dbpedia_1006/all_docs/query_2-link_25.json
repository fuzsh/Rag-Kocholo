He is questionable for the game.\n\nCSKA added the CSKA-2 guard Yuri Umrikhin to the team’s Euroleague roster.\n\nThis double-week is devoted to the fight against racism. EuroLeague authorities allowed the players to put authorized messages onto their uniforms. SCSKA players decided altogether to use the black patches instead of the names. You were able to see it on the game warmuo clithes, now it will be visible on the screens.\n\nPre-game quotes\n\nDimitris Itoudis, CSKA head coach:\n\nWe respect Fenerbahce a lot, the team has a new coach and new system, and they are undefeated this season so far having won both EuroLeague games and three Turkish league games. We were preparing for the game very seriously despite all obstacles, and we go to Istanbul to fight.\n\nTornike Shengelia, CSKA forward:\n\nWe know that Fenerbahce has a bunch of new guys, but the core of the team remains the same. They have important players on every position, so it is going to be a huge fight against tough opponent. They started the season strong, they are very confident, so we have to go out thetre and give all we have to win the game.\n\nClose “relations”\n\nDe Colo returns to Moscow where he spent five seasons as an All-EuroLeague performer for CSKA, helping the team win 2016 and 2019 EuroLeague titles.\n\nFenerbahce guard Leo Westerman played for CSKA during the 2017-18 season.\n\nWestermann was a teammate of CSKA center Nikola Milutinov’s at Partizan Belgrade for two seasons, from 2012 to 2014.\n\nDe Colo and Toko Shengelia were teammates at Valencia Basket during the 2009-10 season and won the 2010 EuroCup title together that season.\n\nJohannes Voigtmann and Fenerbahce’s Danilo Barthel were teammates on the German national team at the 2019 World Cup.\n\nImportant numbers\n\nMike James has made at least 1 three-point shot in 23 straight games.\n\nJames has scored in double figures in each of his last 28 games.\n\nDarrun Hilliard has made at least 1 three-point shot in seven straight and 12 of his last 13 games. Darrun Hilliard needs 2 more three-pointers to reach 100 in the EuroLeague.\n\nTornike Shengelia has had double-digit PIRs in 13 of his last 14 games.\n\nShengelia has scored in double figures in eight of his last nine games.\n\nTornike Shengelia needs 7 more three-pointers to reach 100 in the EuroLeague.\n\nShengelia needs 6 more free throws made to reach 400 for his career.\n\nJanis Strelnieks ranks sixth all-time in free-throw accuracy at 90.9%.\n\nNikola Milutinov ranks 12th all-time with 376 offensive rebounds. Former CSKA great Mirsad Turkcan is 11th with 385.\n\nWill Clyburn needs 4 more three-pointers to reach 100 in the EuroLeague.\n\nDaniel Hackett needs 5 more free throws made to reach 400 for his career.\n\nPast matchups\n\nWins/losses: 24-11\n\nShort dossier\n\nFenerbahce Istanbul, Turkey\n\nFounded: 1913\n\nColors: yellow, dark-blue\n\nHomecourt: Ulker Sports Arena (13800)\n\nPresident: Azim Yildirim\n\nHead coach: Igor Kokoskov\n\nWebsite: www.fenerbahce.org\n\nTrophy case: EuroLeague champions (2017), Turkish champions (1991, 2007, 08, 10, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18), Turkish Cup winners (1967, 2010, 11, 13, 16, 19), President’s Cup winners (1990, 91, 94, 2007, 13, 16)"
