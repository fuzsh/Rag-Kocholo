        "text": "Higher levels of physical activity are associated with a lower risk of developing postmenopausal breast cancer, as well as a lower risk of cancer recurrence, and improved survival. However, the mechanisms for these associations are not well understood. Proposed mechanisms include altered levels of inflammation and altered immune function due to physical activity. PURPOSE: To review the literature on aerobic exercise interventions investigating inflammatory and immunological markers among healthy female and breast cancer survivors. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched using the search terms: breast cancer, exercise, immunological markers (specifically monocytes, T cells, lymphocytes and leukocytes), as well as inflammation markers affected by exercise and relevant to cancer prevention and survival, namely, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Included studies were full text English-language randomized controlled trials of aero...\n\nWhile debate on the optimal level of flexibility still lingers, the majority of sports practitioners consider some degree of flexibility to be essential to maximize sports performance. Several researchers have recommended static stretching as the most effective method of stretching compared to other forms of stretching. However, comparisons of long-term static and dynamic stretching on range of motion are limited. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of chronic static and dynamic stretching on hamstring flexibility. METHODS: Participants included 25 female high school volleyball players (M age = 15.1 yrs). Each participant was randomized into either a static stretching (n = 13) group or a dynamic stretching (n = 12) group. The stretching intervention, which included either a static or dynamic hamstring stretch, was performed 3 days per week for 4 weeks. Range of motion was assessed pre- and post-intervention using an isokinetic dynamometer. RESULTS: An ANCOVA indicated there were no vi...\n\nAltitude training is used by athletes in order to increase hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) and, consequently, to enhance oxygen transport. The individual erythropoietic response, however, is very individual and the causes for this variability are not well known. PURPOSE: To ascertain the range of individual changes in Hbmass in response to altitude training in elite athletes, and to identify possible influencing factors on this response. METHODS: Data from 61 elite swimmers (26 M, 35 F) of 7 different teams and 8 different countries were included in the analysis. 5 teams formed the altitude group (20M, 24F) and completed a 3-4 week altitude training camp at 2320m at Sierra Nevada (Spain). At the same time, two control groups (6M, 11F) performed a training camp at near sea level (Madrid and Barcelona, Spain). Hbmass was measured before, every week during the camp, and at the end using the optimized CO-rebreathing method. Training load was quantified using the TRIMP heart rate-based method. ..."
