        "text": "Quantifying Training Loads in Contemporary Dance.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeffries, Annie C; Wallace, Lee; Coutts, Aaron J\n\n2017-07-01\n\nTo describe the training demands of contemporary dance and determine the validity of using the session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) to monitor exercise intensity and training load in this activity. In addition, the authors examined the contribution of training (ie, accelerometry and heart rate) and non-training-related factors (ie, sleep and wellness) to perceived exertion during dance training. Training load and ActiGraphy for 16 elite amateur contemporary dancers were collected during a 49-d period, using heart-rate monitors, accelerometry, and sRPE. Within-individual correlation analysis was used to determine relationships between sRPE and several other measures of training intensity and load. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to determine a predictive equation to estimate sRPE during dance training. Average weekly training load was 4283 Â± 2442 arbitrary units (AU), monotony 2.13 Â± 0.92 AU, strain 10677 Â± 9438 AU, and average weekly vector magnitude load 1809,707 Â± 1015,402 AU. There were large to very large within-individual correlations between training-load sRPE and various other internal and external measures of intensity and load. The stepwise multiple-regression analysis also revealed that 49.7% of the adjusted variance in training-load sRPE was explained by peak heart rate, metabolic equivalents, soreness, motivation, and sleep quality (y = -4.637 + 13.817%HR peak + 0.316 METS + 0.100 soreness + 0.116 motivation - 0.204 sleep quality). The current findings demonstrate the validity of the sRPE method for quantifying training load in dance, that dancers undertake very high training loads, and a combination of training and nontraining factors contribute to perceived exertion in dance training.\n\nThe Relationships Between Internal and External Measures of Training Load and Intensity in Team Sports: A Meta-Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcLaren, Shaun J; Macpherson, Tom W; Coutts, Aaron J; Hurst, Christopher; Spears, Iain R; Weston, Matthew\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe associations between internal and external measures of training load and intensity are important in understanding the training process and the validity of specific internal measures. We aimed to provide meta-analytic estimates of the relationships, as determined by a correlation coefficient, between internal and external measures of load and intensity during team-sport training and competition. A further aim was to examine the moderating effects of training mode on these relationships. We searched six electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL) for original research articles published up to September 2017. A Boolean search phrase was created to include search terms relevant to team-sport athletes (population; 37 keywords), internal load (dependent variable; 35 keywords), and external load (independent variable; 81 keywords). Articles were considered for meta-analysis when a correlation coefficient describing the association between at least one internal and one external measure of session load or intensity, measured in the time or frequency domain, was obtained from team-sport athletes during normal training or match-play (i.e., unstructured observational study). The final data sample included 122 estimates from 13 independent studies describing 15 unique relationships between three internal and nine external measures of load and intensity. This sample included 295 athletes and 10,418 individual session observations. Internal measures were session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE), sRPE training load (sRPE-TL), and heart-rate-derived training impulse (TRIMP). External measures were total distance (TD), the distance covered at high and very high speeds (HSRDÂ â¥Â 13.1-15.0Â kmÂ h -1 and VHSRDÂ â¥Â 16.9-19.8Â kmÂ h -1 , respectively), accelerometer load (AL), and the number of sustained impacts (ImpactsÂ >Â 2-5Â G). Distinct training modes were identified as either mixed (reference condition), skills, metabolic, or\n\nInfluence of Disease Severity and Exercise Limitation on Exercise Training Intensity and Load and Health Benefits From Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Patients with COPD: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuynh, Virginia C; Fuhr, Desi P; Byers, Bradley W; Selzler, Anne-Marie; Moore, Linn E; Stickland, Michael K\n\n2018-04-11\n\nSome patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) fail to achieve health benefits with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Exercise intensity and load represent stimulus for adaptation but it is unclear whether inappropriate exercise intensity and/or load are affected by severity of COPD, which may affect health benefits. The purpose was to determine whether COPD severity and/or the severity of pulmonary limitation to exercise (PLE) impacted exercising intensity or load and whether resultant intensity/load affected health outcomes derived from PR. Patients with COPD (n = 58, age = 67 Â± 7 y, forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration [FEV1] % predicted = 52 Â± 21%) were recruited upon referral to PR. Primary health outcomes evaluated were 6-min walk distance and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Patients were stratified for disease severity using Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) staging and PLE severity by change in inspiratory capacity during exercise. Exercise intensity and load were calculated from daily exercise records. Participants achieved comparable training duration and load regardless of GOLD severity. Patients with more severe PLE achieved greater training duration (more severe: 546 Â± 143 min., less severe: 451 Â± 109 min., P = .036), and relative training load (more severe: 2200.8 Â± 595.3 kcal, less severe: 1648.3 Â± 597.8 kcal, P = .007). Greater overall training load was associated with greater improvements in 6-min walk distance (r = 0.24, P = .035). No significant relationships were observed between PLE, GOLD severity, training parameters, and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire response. Improvements in exercise tolerance can be explained by achieving greater training loads, demonstrating the importance of appropriate training load to maximize health outcomes in PR.\n\nHigh-Intensity Training and Salivary Immunoglobulin A Responses in Professional Top-Level Soccer Players: Effect of Training Intensity.\n\nPubMed\n\nOwen, Adam L; Wong, Del P; Dunlop, Gordon; Groussard, Carole; Kebsi, Wiem; Dellal, Alexandre; Morgans, Ryland; Zouhal, Hassane\n\n2016-09-01\n\nOwen, AL, Wong, DP, Dunlop, G, Groussard, C, Kebsi, W, Dellal, A, Morgans, R, and Zouhal, H. High-intensity training and salivary immunoglobulin A responses in professional top-level soccer players: Effect of training intensity. J Strength Cond Res 30(9): 2460-2469, 2016-This study aimed (a) to test the hypothesis that salivary immunoglobulin A (s-IgA) would vary with training intensity sessions (low-intensity [LI] vs. high-intensity sessions [HI]) during a traditional training program divided into 4 training periods and (b) to identify key variables (e.g., GPS data, rating of perceived exertion [RPE], and training duration), which could affect s-IgA. Saliva samples of 10 elite professional soccer players were collected (a) before the investigation started to establish the baseline level and (b) before and after each 4 training sessions (LI vs. HI). Training intensity was monitored as internal (through heart rate responses and RPE) and external (through GPS) loads. High-intensity sessions were associated with higher external load (GPS) and with higher RPE. Baseline and pretraining s-IgA did not differ between the 4 training sessions both for HI and LI. Post-training s-IgA were not different (in absolute value and in percentage of change) between HI and LI sessions at the first 3 periods. However, at the fourth period, s-IgA concentration for HI session was significantly lower (p â¤ 0.05) than the LI session. The percentage change between s-IgA post-training and s-IgA baseline concentrations differ significantly (p â¤ 0.05) between HI and LI training sessions. Significant correlations between s-IgA and training intensity were also noted. High-intensity soccer training sessions might cause a significant decrease in s-IgA values during the postexercise window as compared with LI sessions. This study encourages coaches to monitor s-IgA in routine, particularly during HI training periods, to take precautions to avoid upper respiratory tract infection in highly trained\n\nPlayer Load in Elite Netball: Match, Training, and Positional Comparisons.\n\nPubMed\n\nYoung, Christopher M; Gastin, Paul B; Sanders, Nick; Mackey, Luke; Dwyer, Dan B\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe activity profile of competition and training in elite netball has not been comprehensively reported in the literature. To measure and analyze player load in elite netballers during matches and training sessions. The primary research question was, How does player load vary between playing positions in a match and between matches and training sessions? Various measures of player load were recorded in 12 elite professional netballers with a mean Â± SD age of 26 Â± 4.9 y and height of 183.2 Â± 8.7 cm. Player load was assessed using a published method that uses accelerometry. Load was represented as total load in arbitrary units (au), playing intensity (au/min), and relative time spent in each of 4 playing intensity zones (low, low to moderate, moderate, and high). Data from 15 games and up to 17 training sessions were analyzed for each player. Player load in matches for the goal-based positions (goal shooter, goal keeper, and goal defense) tended to be lower than the attacking and wing-based positions (goal attack, wing attack, wing defense, and center). The difference was largely due to the amount of time spent in low-intensity activity. Playing intensity of matches was greater than in training sessions; however, the total time spent in moderate- to high-intensity activities was not practically different. Accelerometry is a valuable method of measuring player load in netball, and the present results provide new information about the activity profile of different playing positions.\n\nMetabolic Demand and Internal Training Load in Technical-Tactical Training Sessions of Professional Futsal Players.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilke, Carolina F; Ramos, Guilherme P; Pacheco, Diogo A S; Santos, Weslley H M; Diniz, Mateus S L; GonÃ§alves, Gabriela G P; Marins, JoÃ£o C B; Wanner, Samuel P; Silami-Garcia, Emerson\n\n2016-08-01\n\nWilke, CF, Ramos, GP, Pacheco, DAS, Santos, WHM, Diniz, MSL, GonÃ§alves, GGP, Marins, JCB, Wanner, SP, and Silami-Garcia, E. Metabolic demand and internal training load in technical-tactical training sessions of professional futsal players. J Strength Cond Res 30(8): 2330-2340, 2016-The aim of the study was to characterize aspects of technical-tactical training sessions of a professional futsal team. We addressed 4 specific aims: characterize the metabolic demands and intensity of these training sessions, compare the training intensity among players of different positions, compare the intensity of different futsal-specific activities (4 Ã 4, 6 Ã 4, and match simulation), and investigate the association between an objective (training impulse; TRIMP) and a subjective method (session rating of perceived exertion; sRPE) of measuring a player's internal training load. Twelve top-level futsal players performed an incremental exercise to determine their maximal oxygen consumption, maximal heart rate (HRmax), ventilatory threshold (VT), and respiratory compensation point (RCP). Each player's HR and RPE were measured and used to calculate energy expenditure, TRIMP, and sRPE during 37 training sessions over 8 weeks. The average intensity was 74 Â± 4% of HRmax, which corresponded to 9.3 kcalÂ·min. The players trained at intensities above the RCP, between the RCP and VT and below the VT for 20 Â± 8%, 28 Â± 6%, and 51 Â± 10% of the session duration, respectively. Wingers, defenders, and pivots exercised at a similar average intensity but with different intensity distributions. No difference in intensity was found between the 3 typical activities. A strong correlation between the average daily TRIMP and sRPE was observed; however, this relationship was significant for only 4 of 12 players, indicating that sRPE is a useful tool for monitoring training loads but that it should be interpreted for each player individually rather than collectively.\n\nHeart Rate Responses and Training Load During Nonspecific and Specific Aerobic Training in Adolescent Taekwondo Athletes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHaddad, Monoem; Chaouachi, Anis; Wong, Del P.; Castagna, Carlo; Chamari, Karim\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe efficacy of replacing generic running with Taekwondo (TKD) specific technical skills during interval training at an intensity corresponding to 90â95% of maximum heart rate (HRmax) has not yet been demonstrated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the HR responses and perceived exertion between controlled running and high-intensity TKD technical interval training in adolescent TKD athletes. Eighteen adolescent, male TKD athletes performed short-duration interval running and TKD specific technical skills (i.e. 10â20 [10-s of exercise interspersed with 20 s of passive recovery]) in a counterbalanced design. In both training methods, HR was measured and expressed as the percentage of HR reserve (%HRres). Rating of perceived exertion (RPE, Borgâs category rating-10 scale), Banisterâs training impulse (TRIMP) and Edwardsâ training load (TL) were used to quantify the internal training load. Recorded cardiovascular responses expressed in %HRres in the two training methods were not significantly different (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the two training methods induced similar training loads as calculated by Banister and Edwardsâ methods. Perceived exertion ranged between âhardâ and âvery hardâ during all interval training sessions. These findings showed that performing repeated TKD specific skills increased HR to the same level, and were perceived as producing the same training intensity as did short-duration interval running in adolescent TKD athletes. Therefore, using specific TKD kicking exercises in high-intensity interval training can be applied to bring more variety during training, mixing physical and technical aspects of the sport, while reaching the same intensity as interval running.

However, quantifying the training of elite Australian rowers is challenging because of (a) the multicenter, multistate structure of the national program; (b) the variety of training undertaken; and (c) the limitations of existing methods for quantifying the loads accumulated from varied training formats. Therefore, the purpose of this project was to develop a new measure for quantifying training loads in rowing (the T2minute method). Sport scientists and senior coaches at the National Rowing Center of Excellence collaborated to develop the measure, which incorporates training duration, intensity, and mode to quantify a single index of training load. To account for training at different intensities, the method uses standardized intensity zones (T zones) established at the Australian Institute of Sport. Each zone was assigned a weighting factor according to the curvilinear relationship between power output and blood lactate response. Each training mode was assigned a weighting factor based on whether coaches perceived it to be \"harder\" or \"easier\" than on-water rowing. A common measurement unit, the T2minute, was defined to normalize sessions in different modes to a single index of load; one T2minute is equivalent to 1 minute of on-water single scull rowing at T2 intensity (approximately 60-72% VO2max). The T2minute method was successfully implemented to support national training strategies in Australian high performance rowing. By incorporating duration, intensity, and mode, the T2minute method extends the concepts that underpin current load measures, providing 1 consistent system to quantify loads from varied training formats.\n\nAnalysing a cycling grand tour: Can we monitor fatigue with intensity or load ratios?\n\nPubMed\n\nSanders, Dajo; Heijboer, Mathieu; Hesselink, Matthijs K C; Myers, Tony; Akubat, Ibrahim\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThis study evaluated the changes in ratios of different intensity (rating of perceived exertion; RPE, heart rate; HR, power output; PO) and load measures (session-RPE; sRPE, individualized TRIMP; iTRIMP, Training Stress Scoreâ¢; TSS) in professional cyclists. RPE, PO and HR data was collected from twelve professional cyclists (VO 2max 75Â Â±Â 6Â mlâminâkg -1 ) during a two-week baseline training period and during two cycling Grand Tours. Subjective:objective intensity (RPE:HR, RPE:PO) and load (sRPE:iTRIMP, sRPE:TSS) ratios and external:internal intensity (PO:HR) and load (TSS:iTRIMP) ratios were calculated for every session. Moderate to large increases in the RPE:HR, RPE:PO and sRPE:TSS ratios (dÂ =Â 0.79-1.79) and small increases in the PO:HR and sRPE:iTRIMP ratio (dÂ =Â 0.21-0.41) were observed during Grand Tours compared to baseline training data. Differences in the TSS:iTRIMP ratio were trivial to small (dÂ =Â 0.03-0.27). Small to moderate week-to-week changes (dÂ =Â 0.21-0.63) in the PO:HR, RPE:PO, RPE:HR, TSS:iTRIMP, sRPE:iTRIMP and sRPE:TSS were observed during the Grand Tour. Concluding, this study shows the value of using ratios of intensity and load measures in monitoring cyclists. Increases in ratios could reflect progressive fatigue that is not readily detected by changes in solitary intensity/load measures.\n\nMonitoring Training Load and Fatigue in Rugby Sevens Players\n\nPubMed Central\n\nElloumi, Mohamed; Makni, Emna; Moalla, Wassim; Bouaziz, Taieb; Tabka, Zouhair; Lac, GÃ©rard; Chamari, Karim\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose Trainers and physical fitness coachesâ need a useful tool to assess training loads to avoid overtraining. However, perceived scales or questionnaires were required. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess whether a short 8-item questionnaire of fatigue could be a useful tool for monitoring changes in perceived training load and strain among elite rugby Sevens (7s) players during preparation for a major competition. Methods Sixteen elite rugby 7s players completed an 8-week training program composed of 6-week intense training (IT) and 2-week reduced training (RT). They were tested before (T0), after the IT (T1) and after the RT (T2). The quantification of the perceived training load and strain were performed by the session-RPE (rating of perceived exertion) method and concomitantly the 8-item questionnaire of fatigue was administered. Results Training load (TL) and strain (TS) and total score of fatigue (TSF from the 8-item questionnaire) increased during IT and decreased during RT. Simultaneously, physical performances decreased during IT and were improved after LT. The changes in TL, TS and TSF correlated significantly over the training period (r=0.63-0.83). Conclusions These findings suggest that the short questionnaire of fatigue could be a practical and a sensitive tool for monitoring changes in training load and strain in team-sport athletes. Accordingly, the simultaneous use of the short questionnaire of fatigue along with the session-RPE method for perceived changes in training load and strain during training could provide additional information on the athletesâ status, allowing coaches to prevent eventual states of overreaching or overtraining.

Youth soccer players (12.1Â±2.2 y) were assigned to either a jump training group (JG, n=21), a jump training group plus haltere type handheld loading (LJG, n=21), or a control group following only soccer training (CG, n=21). Athletes were evaluated for maximal-intensity performance measures before and after 6 weeks of training, during an in-season training period. The CG achieved a significant change in maximal kicking velocity only (ES=0.11-0.20). Both jump training groups improved in right leg (ES=0.28-0.45) and left leg horizontal countermovement jump with arms (ES=0.32-0.47), horizontal countermovement jump with arms (ES=0.28-0.37), vertical countermovement jump with arms (ES=0.26), 20-cm drop jump reactive strength index (ES=0.20-0.37), and maximal kicking velocity (ES=0.27-0.34). Nevertheless, compared to the CG, only the LJG exhibited greater improvements in all performance tests. Therefore, haltere type handheld loading further enhances performance adaptations during jump training in youth soccer players.

Muscular strength and power output values measured from vertical jump and Wingate anaerobic tests are higher in elite than in non-elite young athletes and normal children, and the specific training effects on maximal power output normalised for body size are clearly more distinct before puberty. At present, there is no scientific evidence to support the view that high-intensity and/or resistance training might hinder growth and maturation in young children. Pre-pubertal growth is not adversely affected by sport at a competitive level and anthropometric factors are of importance for choice of sport in children. However, coaches, teachers and parents should be aware that unsupervised high-intensity and resistance training programmes involving maximal loads or too frequently repeated resistance exercises increase the risk of injury. Resistance training alone is an effective additional means of developing athletic performance throughout planned youth sports training programmes. Strategies for enhancing the effectiveness and safety of youth resistance and high-intensity exercise training are discussed in this chapter. Copyright Â© 2011 S.

But the difference between high intensity interval training and moderate intensity interval training (MIIT) in simulated weightlessness still has not been well studied. This study sought to characterize the difference between 6 weeks high intensity interval training and moderate intensity interval training under reduced weight (RW) gait training device and zero-gravity locomotion system (ZLS). Twenty-three subjects (14M/4F, 32.5Â±4.5 years) volunteered to participate. They were divided into three groups, that were MITT (alternating 2 min at 40% VO _{2} peak and 2 min at 60% VO _{2} peak for 30min, five days per week) RW group (n=8), HITT (alternating 2 min at 40% VO _{2} peak and 2 min at 90% VO _{2} peak for 30min, three days per week) RW group (n=8) and HITT ZLS group (n=7). The Z-axis load used in RW group was 80% body weight (BW) and in ZLS was 100% BW. Cardiopulmonary function was measured before, after 4-week training and after 6-week training. Isokinetic knee extension-flexion test at 60(Â°) deg/s and 180(Â°) deg/s were performed before and after the 6-week training, and isometric knee extension-flexion test at 180(Â°) deg/s was also examined at the same time. It was found that the VO _{2} peaks, metabolic equivalent (MET), Speedmax and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) were significantly increased after 4 and 6-week training in all three groups and no significant group difference were detected. The peak torque at 60(Â°) deg/s for right knee flexion were significantly increased after 6 week-training in all three groups, and only in HITT RW group the total power at 60(Â°) deg/s for right knee flexion enhanced. The total power and average power at 60(Â°) deg/s for right knee extension decreased significantly after 6-week training in all three groups. The peak torque at 60(Â°) deg/s for right knee extension in MIIT RW group was\n\nIs there a minimum intensity threshold for resistance training-induced hypertrophic adaptations?\n\nPubMed\n\nSchoenfeld, Brad J\n\n2013-12-01\n\nIn humans, regimented resistance training has been shown to promote substantial increases in skeletal muscle mass. With respect to traditional resistance training methods, the prevailing opinion is that an intensity of greater than ~60Â % of 1 repetition maximum (RM) is necessary to elicit significant increases in muscular size. It has been surmised that this is the minimum threshold required to activate the complete spectrum of fiber types, particularly those associated with the largest motor units. There is emerging evidence, however, that low-intensity resistance training performed with blood flow restriction (BFR) can promote marked increases in muscle hypertrophy, in many cases equal to that of traditional high-intensity exercise. The anabolic effects of such occlusion-based training have been attributed to increased levels of metabolic stress that mediate hypertrophy at least in part by enhancing recruitment of high-threshold motor units. Recently, several researchers have put forth the theory that low-intensity exercise (â¤50Â % 1RM) performed without BFR can promote increases in muscle size equal, or perhaps even superior, to that at higher intensities, provided training is carried out to volitional muscular failure. Proponents of the theory postulate that fatiguing contractions at light loads is simply a milder form of BFR and thus ultimately results in maximal muscle fiber recruitment. Current research indicates that low-load exercise can indeed promote increases in muscle growth in untrained subjects, and that these gains may be functionally, metabolically, and/or aesthetically meaningful. However, whether hypertrophic adaptations can equal that achieved with higher intensity resistance exercise (â¤60Â % 1RM) remains to be determined. Furthermore, it is not clear as to what, if any, hypertrophic effects are seen with low-intensity exercise in well-trained subjects as experimental studies on the topic in this population are lacking. Practical\n\nThe effectiveness of session rating of perceived exertion to monitor resistance training load in acute burns patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrisbrook, Tiffany L; Gittings, Paul M; Wood, Fiona M; Edgar, Dale W\n\n2017-02-01\n\nSession-rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is a method frequently utilised in exercise and sports science to quantify training load of an entire aerobic exercise session. It has also been demonstrated that session-RPE is a valid and reliable method to quantify training load during resistance exercise, in healthy and athletic populations. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of session-RPE as a method to quantify exercise intensity during resistance training in patients with acute burns. Twenty burns patients (mean age=31.65 (Â±10.09) years), with a mean TBSA of 16.4% (range=6-40%) were recruited for this study. Patients were randomly allocated to the resistance training (n=10) or control group (n=10). All patients completed a four week resistance training programme. Training load (session-RPEÃsession duration), resistance training session-volume and pre-exercise pain were recorded for each exercise session. The influence of; age, gender, %TBSA, exercise group (resistance training vs. control), pre-exercise pain, resistance training history and session-volume on training load were analysed using a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression. Session-volume did not influence training load in the final regression model, however training load was significantly greater in the resistance training group, compared with the control group (p<0.001). Pre-exercise pain significantly influenced training load, where increasing pain was associated with a higher session-RPE (p=0.004). Further research is indicated to determine the exact relationship between pain, resistance training history, exercise intensity and session-RPE and training load before it can be used as a method to monitor and prescribe resistance training load in acute burns patients.

However, field data supporting this are limited. The authors examined the relationship between heart-rate variability and training-intensity distribution in 9 elite rowers during the 26-wk build-up to the 2012 Olympic Games (2 won gold and 2 won bronze medals). Weekly averaged log-transformed square root of the mean sum of the squared differences between R-R intervals (Ln rMSSD) was examined, with respect to changes in total training time (TTT) and training time below the first lactate threshold (training time in a particular training zone or load, standardized changes in Ln rMSSD were +0.13 (unclear) for TTT, +0.20 (51% chance increase) for time LT(2). Correlations (Â± 90% confidence limits) for Ln rMSSD were small vs TTT (r = .37 Â± .80), moderate vs time LT2 (r = -.22 Â± .50). These data provide supportive rationale for the polarized model of training, showing that training phases with increased time spent at high intensity suppress parasympathetic activity, while low-intensity training preserves and increases it. As such, periodized low-intensity training may be beneficial for optimal training programming.\n\nPotential contributions of training intensity on locomotor performance in individuals with chronic stroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolleran, Carey L; Rodriguez, Kelly S; Echauz, Anthony; Leech, Kristan A; Hornby, T George\n\n2015-04-01\n\nMany interventions can improve walking ability of individuals with stroke, although the training parameters that maximize recovery are not clear. For example, the contribution of training intensity has not been well established and may contribute to the efficacy of many locomotor interventions. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate the effects of locomotor training intensity on walking outcomes in individuals with gait deficits poststroke. Using a randomized cross-over design, 12 participants with chronic stroke (>6-month duration) performed either high-intensity (70%-80% of heart rate reserve; n = 6) or low-intensity (30%-40% heart rate reserve; n = 6) locomotor training for 12 or fewer sessions over 4 to 5 weeks. Four weeks following completion, the alternate training intervention was performed. Training intensity was manipulated by adding loads or applying resistance during walking, with similar speeds, durations, and amount of stepping practice between conditions. Greater increases in 6-Minute Walk Test performance were observed following high-intensity training compared with low-intensity training. A significant interaction of intensity and order was also observed for 6-Minute Walk Test and peak treadmill speed, with the largest changes in those who performed high-intensity training first. Moderate correlations were observed between locomotor outcomes and measures of training intensity. This study provides the first evidence that the intensity of locomotor practice may be an important independent determinant of walking outcomes poststroke. In the clinical setting, the intensity of locomotor training can be manipulated in many ways, although this represents only 1 parameter to consider.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A90).\n\nThe relationships between internal and external training load models during basketball training.\n\nPubMed\n\nScanlan, Aaron T; Wen, Neal; Tucker, Patrick S; Dalbo, Vincent J\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe present investigation described and compared the internal and external training loads during basketball training. Eight semiprofessional male basketball players (mean Â± SD, age: 26.3 Â± 6.7 years; stature: 188.1 Â± 6.2 cm; body mass: 92.0 Â± 13.8 kg) were monitored across a 7-week period during the preparatory phase of the annual training plan. A total of 44 total sessions were monitored. Player session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE), heart rate, and accelerometer data were collected across each training session. Internal training load was determined using the sRPE, training impulse (TRIMP), and summated-heart-rate-zones (SHRZ) training load models. External training load was calculated using an established accelerometer algorithm. Pearson product-moment correlations with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to determine the relationships between internal and external training load models. Significant moderate relationships were observed between external training load and the sRPE (r42 = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.23-0.69, p < 0.001) and TRIMP models (r42 = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.09-0.61, p = 0.011). A significant large correlation was evident between external training load and the SHRZ model (r42 = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.38-0.77, p < 0.001). Although significant relationships were found between internal and external training load models, the magnitude of the correlations and low commonality suggest that internal training load models measure different constructs of the training process than the accelerometer training load model in basketball settings. Basketball coaching and conditioning professionals should not assume a linear dose-response between accelerometer and internal training load models during training and are recommended to combine internal and external approaches when monitoring training load in players.\n\nModelling of optimal training load patterns during the 11 weeks preceding major competition in elite swimmers.\n\nPubMed\n\nHellard, Philippe; Scordia, Charlotte; Avalos, Marta; Mujika, Inigo; Pyne, David B\n\n2017-10-01\n\nPeriodization of swim training in the final training phases prior to competition and its effect on performance have been poorly described. We modeled the relationships between the final 11 weeks of training and competition performance in 138 elite sprint, middle-distance, and long-distance swimmers over 20 competitive seasons. Total training load (TTL), strength training (ST), and low- to medium-intensity and high-intensity training variables were monitored. Training loads were scaled as a percentage of the maximal volume measured at each intensity level. Four training periods (meso-cycles) were defined: the taper (weeks 1 to 2 before competition), short-term (weeks 3 to 5), medium-term (weeks 6 to 8), and long-term (weeks 9 to 11). Mixed-effects models were used to analyze the association between training loads in each training meso-cycle and end-of-season major competition performance. For sprinters, a 10% increase between â¼20% and 70% of the TTL in medium- and long-term meso-cycles was associated with 0.07 s and 0.20 s faster performance in the 50 m and 100 m events, respectively (p < 0.01). For middle-distance swimmers, a higher TTL in short-, medium-, and long-term training yielded faster competition performance (e.g., a 10% increase in TTL was associated with improvements of 0.1-1.0 s in 200 m events and 0.3-1.6 s in 400 m freestyle, p < 0.01). For sprinters, a 60%-70% maximal ST load 6-8 weeks before competition induced the largest positive effects on performance (p < 0.01). An increase in TTL during the medium- and long-term preparation (6-11 weeks to competition) was associated with improved performance. Periodization plans should be adapted to the specialty of swimmers.\n\nCan HRV be used to evaluate training load in constant load exercises?\n\nPubMed\n\nKaikkonen, Piia; Hynynen, Esa; Mann, Theresa; Rusko, Heikki; Nummela, Ari\n\n2010-02-01\n\nThe overload principle of training states that training load (TL) must be sufficient to threaten the homeostasis of cells, tissues, organs, and/or body. However, there is no \"golden standard\" for TL measurement. The aim of this study was to examine if any post-exercise heart rate variability (HRV) indices could be used to evaluate TL in exercises with different intensities and durations. Thirteen endurance-trained males (35 +/- 5 year) performed MODE (moderate intensity, 3 km at 60% of the maximal velocity of the graded maximal test (vVO(2max))), HI (high intensity, 3 km at 85% vVO(2max)), and PRO (prolonged, 14 km at 60% vVO(2max)) exercises on a treadmill. HRV was analyzed with short-time Fourier-transform method during rest, exercise, and 15-min recovery. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE), blood lactate (BLa), and HFP(120) (mean of 0-120 s post-exercise) described TL of these exercises similarly, being different for HI (P < 0.05) and PRO (P < 0.05) when compared with MODE. RPE and BLa also correlated negatively with HFP(120) (r = -0.604, -0.401), LFP(120) (-0.634, -0.601), and TP(120) (-0.691, -0.569). HRV recovery dynamics were similar after each exercise, but the level of HRV was lower after HI than MODE. Increased intensity or duration of exercise decreased immediate HRV recovery, suggesting that post-exercise HRV may enable an objective evaluation of TL in field conditions. The first 2-min recovery seems to give enough information on HRV recovery for evaluating TL.\n\nOptimizing Preseason Training Loads in Australian Football.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarey, David L; Crow, Justin; Ong, Kok-Leong; Blanch, Peter; Morris, Meg E; Dascombe, Ben J; Crossley, Kay M\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTo investigate whether preseason training plans for Australian football can be computer generated using current training-load guidelines to optimize injury-risk reduction and performance improvement. A constrained optimization problem was defined for daily total and sprint distance, using the preseason schedule of an elite Australian football team as a template. Maximizing total training volume and maximizing Banister-model-projected performance were bothÂ considered optimization objectives. Cumulative workload and acute:chronic workload-ratio constraints were placed on training programs to reflect current guidelines on relative and absolute training loads for injury-risk reduction. Optimization software was then used to generate preseason training plans. The optimization framework was able to generate training plans that satisfied relative and absolute workload constraints. Increasing the off-season chronic training loads enabled the optimization algorithm to prescribe higher amounts of \"safe\" training and attain higher projected performance levels. Simulations showed that using a Banister-model objective led to plans that included a taper in training load prior to competition to minimize fatigue and maximize projected performance. In contrast, when the objective was to maximize total training volume, more frequent training was prescribed to accumulate as much load as possible. Feasible training plans that maximize projected performance and satisfy injury-risk constraints can be automatically generated by an optimization problem for Australian football. The optimization methods allow for individualized training-plan design and the ability to adapt to changing training objectives and different training-load metrics.\n\nTraining-Load Distribution in Endurance Runners: Objective Versus Subjective Assessment.\n\nPubMed\n\nManzi, Vincenzo; Bovenzi, Antonio; Castagna, Carlo; Sinibaldi Salimei, Paola; Volterrani, Maurizio; Iellamo, Ferdinando\n\n2015-11-01\n\nTo assess the distribution of exercise intensity in long-distance recreational athletes (LDRs) preparing for a marathon and to test the hypothesis that individual perception of effort could provide training responses similar to those provided by standardized training methodologies. Seven LDRs (age 36.5 Â± 3.8 y) were followed during a 5-mo training period culminating with a city marathon. Heart rate at 2.0 and 4.0 mmol/L and maximal heart rate were used to establish 3 intensity training zones. Internal training load (TL) was assessed by training zones and TRIMPi methods. These were compared with the session-rating-of-perceived-exertion (RPE) method. Total time spent in zone 1 was higher than in zones 2 and 3 (76.3% Â± 6.4%, 17.3% Â± 5.8%, and 6.3% Â± 0.9%, respectively; P = .000 for both, ES = 0.98, ES = 0.99). TL quantified by session-RPE provided the same result. The comparison between session-RPE and training-zones-based methods showed no significant difference at the lowest intensity (P = .07, ES = 0.25). A significant correlation was observed between TL RPE and TL TRIMPi at both individual and group levels (r = .79, P < .001). There was a significant correlation between total time spent in zone 1 and the improvement at the running speed of 2 mmol/L (r = .88, P < .001). A negative correlation was found between running speed at 2 mmol/L and the time needed to complete the marathon (r = -.83, P < .001). These findings suggest that in recreational LDRs most of the training time is spent at low intensity and that this is associated with improved performances. Session-RPE is an easy-to-use training method that provides responses similar to those obtained with standardized training methodologies.\n\nMonitoring Training Load in Indian Male Swimmers\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMAJUMDAR, PRALAY; SRIVIDHYA, SRI\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe present study was initiated to monitor the training load with the magnitude of impact on the hormone concentrations such as testosterone, cortisol and T/C (Testosterone/Cortisol) ratio during the three phases of training (i.e. preparatory, pre-competitive, and competitive phases) in Indian male swimmers preparing for the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Blood samples were collected at the end of each training phase and hormone concentration was determined by ELISA. Our results reveal that testosterone concentration and the T/C ratio significantly decreased and the cortisol concentration increased in the subsequent periodized cycle. Change in hormone concentration was associated with the intensity and duration of individual exercise sessions. The greatest performance enhancement was realized with the lowest plasma cortisol, highest testosterone, and a high T/C ratio. Monitoring of these hormones also have implications for identifying and preventing overreaching in swimmers.

METHODS: The study was conducted on six national male badminton players. Maximum oxygen consumption (VO2), ventilation (VE), heart rate, and respiratory quotient were measured by a protocol of graded treadmill exercise. Twelve training sessions and 35 singles matches were analysed. Heart rate and blood lactate were monitored during technical training routines and match play. Fasting blood samples collected on two occasions--that is, during off season and 12 hours after specific training--were analysed for serum urea, uric acid, and CPK. RESULTS: Analysis of the on court training regimens showed lactate values of 8-10.5 mmol/l in different phases. The percentage of maximum heart rate ranged from 82% to 100%. Urea, uric acid, and CPK activity showed significant changes from (mean (SD)) 4.93 (0.75) mmol/l to 5.49 (0.84) mmol/l, 0.23 (0.04) to 0.33 (0.06) mmol/l, and 312 (211.8) to 363 (216.4) IU/l respectively. CONCLUSION: Maximum lactate reported in the literature ranges from 3-6 mmol/l. Comparatively high lactate values and high percentage of maximum heart rate found in on court training show a considerable stress on muscular and cardiovascular system. The training load needs appropriate monitoring to avoid over-training. Workouts that are too intensive may interfere with coordination, a factor that is important in sports requiring highly technical skill such as badminton.

R-R intervals were recorded in resting supine (SU) and standing (ST) positions. Heart rate, low (LF), high (HF) frequency powers of HRV were determined. Training volume, training load (TL, a.u.) according to ventilatory threshold 1 (VT1) and VT2 were measured in zones Iâ¤VT1; VT1VT2, IV for strength. TL was performed at 81.6Â±3.5% in zone I, 0.9Â±0.9% in zone II, 5.0Â±3.6% in zone III, 11.6Â±6.3% in zone IV. 172 HRV tests matched a fatigue state and four HRV fatigue patterns (F) were statistically characterized as F(HF-LF-)SU_ST for 121 tests, F(LF+SULF-ST) for 18 tests, F(HF-SUHF+ST) for 26 tests and F(HF+SU) for 7 tests. The occurrence of fatigue states increased substantially with the part of altitude training time (r2=0.52, p<0.001). This study evidenced that there is no causal relationship between training load/intensity and HRV fatigue patterns. Four fatigue-shifted HRV patterns were sorted. Altitude training periods appeared critical as they are likely to increase the overreaching risks.

High-speed equine treadmills are sometimes used to supplement exercise on a track in the training of young Thoroughbreds because the horse can run at high speeds but without the added weight of a rider. We tested the hypothesis that intermittent high-intensity exercise on a treadmill of young Thoroughbred horses entering training can enhance development of aerobic capacity (Vo2max) and running performance more than conventional training under saddle, and do so without causing lameness. Results Twelve yearling Thoroughbreds trained for 8Â months with conventional riding (C) only, conventional riding plus a short (2Â month, S) interval of once-per-week high-intensity treadmill exercise, or a long (8Â month, L) interval of once-per-week high-intensity treadmill exercise. Three treadmill exercise tests evaluated Vo2max, oxygen transport and running performance variables in June of the yearling year (only for L), October of the yearling year and April of the 2-year-old year. No horses experienced lameness during the study. Aerobic capacity increased in all groups after training. In both October and April, Vo2max in L was higher than in C, but did not differ between L and S or S and C. Running speeds eliciting Vo2max also increased in all groups after training, with S (809âÂ±â3Â m/s) and L (804âÂ±â9Â m/s) higher than C (764âÂ±â27Â m/s). Maximum heart rate decreased for all groups after training. Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration increased for L throughout training. Conclusions Young Thoroughbred horses can increase aerobic capacity and running performance more than by strictly using track training under saddle with the addition of intermittent high-intensity treadmill exercise, and they can do so without experiencing lameness\n\nThe effects of training with loads that maximise power output and individualised repetitions vs. traditional power training\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMoya-RamÃ³n, M.; HernÃ¡ndez-DavÃ³, J. L.; Fernandez-Fernandez, J.; Sabido, R.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground It has been suggested that strength training effects (i.e. neural or structural) vary, depending on the total repetitions performed and velocity loss in each training set. Purpose The aim of this study is to compare the effects of two training programmes (i.e. one with loads that maximise power output and individualised repetitions, and the other following traditional power training). Methods Twenty-five males were divided into three groups (optimum power [OP = 10], traditional training [TT = 9] and control group [CG = 6]). The training load used for OP was individualised using loads that maximised power output (41.7% Â± 5.8 of one repetition maximum [1RM]) and repetitions at maximum power (4 to 9 repetitions, or ârepsâ). Volume (sets x repetitions) was the same for both experimental groups, while intensity for TT was that needed to perform only 50% of the maximum number of possible repetitions (i.e. 61.1%â66.6% of 1RM). The training programme ran over 11 weeks (2 sessions per week; 4â5 sets per session; 3-minute rests between sets), with pre-, intermediate and post-tests which included: anthropometry, 1RM, peak power output (PPO) with 30%, 40% and 50% of 1RM in the bench press throw, and salivary testosterone (ST) and cortisol (SC) concentrations. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and power output were recorded in all sessions. Results Following the intermediate test, PPO was increased in the OP group for each load (10.9%â13.2%). Following the post-test, both experimental groups had increased 1RM (11.8%â13.8%) and PPO for each load (14.1%â19.6%). Significant decreases in PPO were found for the TT group during all sets (4.9%â15.4%), along with significantly higher RPE (37%). Conclusion OP appears to be a more efficient method of training, with less neuromuscular fatigue and lower RPE.

We do not know of any known function describing the relationship of power and velocity and load in the bench press exercise. The objective of the study is to find a function modeling of the relationship of relative velocity, relative load and mechanical power output for the bench press exercise and to determine the intensity zones of the exercise for specifically focused strength training of soccer players. Fifteen highly trained soccer players at the start of a competition period were studied. The subjects of study performed bench presses with the load of 0, 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% of the predetermined one repetition maximum with maximum possible speed of movement. The mean measured power and velocity for each load (kg) were used to develop a multiple linear regression function which describes the quadratic relationship between the ratio of power (W) to maximum power (W) and the ratios of the load (kg) to one repetition maximum (kg) and the velocity (mâ¢sâ1) to maximal velocity (mâ¢sâ1). The quadratic function of two variables that modeled the searched relationship explained 74% of measured values in the acceleration phase and 75% of measured values from the entire extent of the positive power movement in the lift. The optimal load for reaching maximum power output suitable for the dynamics effort strength training was 40% of one repetition maximum, while the optimal mean velocity would be 75% of maximal velocity. Moreover, four zones: maximum power, maximum velocity, velocity-power and strength-power were determined on the basis of the regression function.

L.; Cook, S. B.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDecreases in strength and neuromuscular function are observed following prolonged disuse. Exercise countermeasures to prevent muscle dysfunction during disuse typically involve high intensity resistance training. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of low-load resistance training with a blood flow occlusion to mitigate muscle loss and dysfunction during 30 days of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS).\n\nA pilot study on quantification of training load: The use of HRV in training practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaboul, Damien; Balducci, Pascal; Millet, GrÃ©goire; Pialoux, Vincent; Hautier, Christophe\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRecent laboratory studies have suggested that heart rate variability (HRV) may be an appropriate criterion for training load (TL) quantification. The aim of this study was to validate a novel HRV index that may be used to assess TL in field conditions. Eleven well-trained long-distance male runners performed four exercises of different duration and intensity. TL was evaluated using Foster and Banister methods. In addition, HRV measurements were performed 5 minutes before exercise and 5 and 30 minutes after exercise. We calculated HRV index (TLHRV) based on the ratio between HRV decrease during exercise and HRV increase during recovery. HRV decrease during exercise was strongly correlated with exercise intensity (R = -0.70; p < 0.01) but not with exercise duration or training volume. TLHRV index was correlated with Foster (R = 0.61; p = 0.01) and Banister (R = 0.57; p = 0.01) methods. This study confirms that HRV changes during exercise and recovery phase are affected by both intensity and physiological impact of the exercise. Since the TLHRV formula takes into account the disturbance and the return to homeostatic balance induced by exercise, this new method provides an objective and rational TL index. However, some simplification of the protocol measurement could be envisaged for field use.\n\nValidity and reliability of the session-RPE method for quantifying training load in karate athletes.\n\nPubMed\n\nTabben, M; Tourny, C; Haddad, M; Chaabane, H; Chamari, K; Coquart, J B\n\n2015-04-24\n\nTo test the construct validity and reliability of the session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) method by examining the relationship between RPE and physiological parameters (heart rate: HR and blood lactate concentration: [La --] ) and the correlations between sRPE and two HR--based methods for quantifying internal training load (Banister's method and Edwards's method) during karate training camp. Eighteen elite karate athletes: ten men (age: 24.2 Â± 2.3 y, body mass: 71.2 Â± 9.0 kg, body fat: 8.2 Â± 1.3% and height: 178 Â± 7 cm) and eight women (age: 22.6 Â± 1.2 y, body mass: 59.8 Â± 8.4 kg, body fat: 20.2 Â± 4.4%, height: 169 Â± 4 cm) were included in the study. During training camp, subjects participated in eight karate--training sessions including three training modes (4 tactical--technical, 2 technical--development, and 2 randori training), during which RPE, HR, and [La -- ] were recorded. Significant correlations were found between RPE and physiological parameters (percentage of maximal HR: r = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.64--0.86; [La --] : r = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.49--0.75; P < 0.001). Moreover, individual sRPE was significantly correlated with two HR--based methods for quantifying internal training load ( r = 0.65--0.95; P < 0.001). The sRPE method showed the high reliability of the same intensity across training sessions (Cronbach's Î± = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.61--0.92). This study demonstrates that the sRPE method is valid for quantifying internal training load and intensity in karate.\n\nDifferent loading schemes in power training during the preseason promote similar performance improvements in Brazilian elite soccer players.\n\nPubMed\n\nLoturco, Irineu; Ugrinowitsch, Carlos; Tricoli, Valmor; Pivetti, Bruno; Roschel, Hamilton\n\n2013-07-01\n\nThe present study investigated the effects of 2 different power training loading schemes in Brazilian elite soccer players. Thirty-two players participated in the study. Maximum dynamic strength (1RM) was evaluated before (B), at midpoint (i.e., after 3 weeks; T1), and after 6 weeks (T2) of a preseason strength/power training. Muscle power, jumping, and sprinting performance were evaluated at B and T2. Players were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 training groups: velocity-based (VEL: n = 16; age, 19.18 Â± 0.72 years; height, 173 Â± 6 cm; body mass, 72.7 Â± 5.8 kg) or intensity-based (INT: n = 16; age, 19.11 Â± 0.7 years; height, 172 Â± 4.5 cm; body mass, 71.8 Â± 4.6 kg). After the individual determination of the optimal power load, both groups completed a 3-week traditional strength training period. Afterward, the VEL group performed 3 weeks of power-oriented training with increasing velocity and decreasing intensity (from 60 to 30% 1RM) throughout the training period, whereas the INT group increased the training intensity (from 30 to 60% 1RM) and thus decreased movement velocity throughout the power-oriented training period. Both groups used loads within Â±15% (ranging from 30 to 60% 1RM) of the measured optimal power load (i.e., 45.2 Â± 3.0% 1RM). Similar 1RM gains were observed in both groups at T1 (VEL: 9.2%; INT: 11.0%) and T2 (VEL: 19.8%; INT: 22.1%). The 2 groups also presented significant improvements (within-group comparisons) in all of the variables. However, no between-group differences were detected. Mean power in the back squat (VEL: 18.5%; INT: 20.4%) and mean propulsive power in the jump squat (VEL: 29.1%; INT: 31.0%) were similarly improved at T2. The 10-m sprint (VEL: -4.3%; INT: -1.6%), jump squat (VEL: 7.1%; INT: 4.5%), and countermovement jump (VEL: 6.7%; INT: 6.9%) were also improved in both groups at T2. Curiously, the 30-m sprint time (VEL: -0.8%; INT: -0.1%) did not significantly improve for both groups. In summary, our data suggest that male\n\nWhole-Body High-Intensity Interval Training Induce Similar Cardiorespiratory Adaptations Compared With Traditional High-Intensity Interval Training and Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training in Healthy Men.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchaun, Gustavo Z; Pinto, Stephanie S; Silva, Mariana R; Dolinski, Davi B; Alberton, Cristine L\n\n2018-05-07\n\nSchaun, GZ, Pinto, SS, Silva, MR, Dolinski, DB, and Alberton, CL. Sixteen weeks of whole-body high-intensity interval training induce similar cardiorespiratory responses compared with traditional high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training in healthy men. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2018-Low-volume high-intensity interval training (HIIT) protocols that use the body weight as resistance could be an interesting and inexpensive alternative to traditional ergometer-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT-T) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). Therefore, our aim was to compare the effects of 16 weeks of whole-body HIIT (HIIT-WB), HIIT-T, and MICT on maximal oxygen uptake (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max), second ventilatory threshold (VT2), and running economy (RE) outcomes. Fifty-five healthy men (23.7 Â± 0.7 years, 1.79 Â± 0.01 m, 78.5 Â± 1.7 kg) were randomized into 3 training groups (HIIT-T = 17; HIIT-WB = 19; MICT = 19) for 16 weeks (3Ã per week). The HIIT-T group performed eight 20-second bouts at 130% of the velocity associated to V[Combining Dot Above]O2max (vV[Combining Dot Above]O2max) interspersed by 10-second passive recovery on a treadmill, whereas HIIT-WB group performed the same protocol but used calisthenics exercises at an all-out intensity instead of treadmill running. Finally, MICT group exercised for 30 minutes at 90-95% of the heart rate (HR) associated to VT2. After the intervention, all groups improved V[Combining Dot Above]O2max, vV[Combining Dot Above]O2max, time to exhaustion (Tmax), VT2, velocity associated with VT2 (vVT2), and time to reach VT2 (tVT2) significantly (p < 0.05). Moreover, Tmax, vVT2, and tVT2 were greater after HIIT-T compared with HIIT-WB (p < 0.05), whereas oxygen uptake increased and HR decreased during the RE test in all groups (p < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that HIIT-WB can be as effective as traditional HIIT while also being time-efficient compared with MICT to\n\nEffect of training load structure on purine metabolism in middle-distance runners.\n\nPubMed\n\nZieliÅski, Jacek; Kusy, Krzysztof; Rychlewski, Tadeusz\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThere are no studies analyzing the effect of training loads on purine metabolism during long training periods. The study's purpose was to evaluate the effect of training load changes and subsequent detraining on purine metabolism in middle-distance runners during a 1-yr cycle. In four characteristic points of the training cycle, loads assigned to five intensity zones, pre- and postexercise plasma hypoxanthine (Hx) and uric acid, and erythrocyte Hx-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity were determined in 11 male middle-distance runners at the national level, practicing competitive sport for 8.1 Â± 0.3 yr and with a mean age of 22.3 Â± 0.7 yr, body mass of 73.0 Â± 3.4 kg, and body height of 180 Â± 2.2 cm. In the competition phase (CP), training loads in aerobic compensation and threshold zones decreased by 65.4% and by 20.5%, respectively. At the same time, anaerobic training loads increased by 132.5% in the VO(2max) zone and by 74.6% in the lactic acid tolerance zone. Postexercise Hx decreased significantly in CP by 6.2 Î¼molÂ·L(-1). and increased in the transition phase (TP) by 17.4 Î¼molÂ·L(-1). Both pre- and postexercise HGPRT activity increased significantly in CP by 9.3 nmolÂ·mg(-1)Â·h(-1). and by 4.9 nmolÂ·mg(-1)Â·h(-1). , respectively, and decreased significantly in TP by 10.6 nmolÂ·mg(-1)Â·h(-1). and by 12.0 nmolÂ·mg(-1)Â·h(-1). , respectively. A significant uric acid increase of 54 Î¼molÂ·L(-1). was revealed merely in TP. The effect of anaerobic training on purine metabolism is significant despite of a very short total duration of anaerobic loads. Elevated preexercise HGPRT activity in CP suggests adaptation changes consisting in a \"permanent readiness\" for purine salvage. The detraining in TP leads to reverse adaptation changes. Probably, plasma Hx concentration and erythrocyte HGPRT activity may be considered as a useful measure of training status.\n\nInterval training intensity affects energy intake compensation in obese men.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlkahtani, Shaea A; Byrne, Nuala M; Hills, Andrew P; King, Neil A\n\n2014-12-01\n\nCompensatory responses may attenuate the effectiveness of exercise training in weight management. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of moderate- and high-intensity interval training on eating behavior compensation. Using a crossover design, 10 overweight and obese men participated in 4-week moderate (MIIT) and high (HIIT) intensity interval training. MIIT consisted of 5-min cycling stages at Â± 20% of mechanical work at 45%VO(2)peak, and HIIT consisted of alternate 30-s work at 90%VO(2)peak and 30-s rests, for 30 to 45 min. Assessments included a constant-load exercise test at 45%VO(2)peak for 45 min followed by 60-min recovery. Appetite sensations were measured during the exercise test using a Visual Analog Scale. Food preferences (liking and wanting) were assessed using a computer-based paradigm, and this paradigm uses 20 photographic food stimuli varying along two dimensions, fat (high or low) and taste (sweet or nonsweet). An ad libitum test meal was provided after the constant-load exercise test. Exercise-induced hunger and desire to eat decreased after HIIT, and the difference between MIIT and HIIT in desire to eat approached significance (p = .07). Exercise-induced liking for high-fat nonsweet food tended to increase after MIIT and decreased after HIIT (p = .09). Fat intake decreased by 16% after HIIT, and increased by 38% after MIIT, with the difference between MIIT and HIIT approaching significance (p = .07). This study provides evidence that energy intake compensation differs between MIIT and HIIT.\n\nImpact of high-intensity interval training and moderate-intensity continuous training on resting and postexercise cardiac troponin T concentration.\n\nPubMed\n\nNie, Jinlei; Zhang, Haifeng; Kong, Zhaowei; George, Keith; Little, Jonathan P; Tong, Tomas K; Li, Feifei; Shi, Qingde\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWhat is the central question of this study? Does exercise training impact resting and postexercise cardiac troponin T (cTnT) concentration? What is the main finding and its importance? This randomized controlled intervention study demonstrated that 12Â weeks of either high-intensity interval training or moderate-intensity continuous training largely abolished the exercise-induced elevation in cTnT when exercise was performed at the same absolute intensity. There was no impact of training on resting cTnT or postexercise appearance of cTnT when exercise was performed at the same relative intensity. These findings provide new information that might help clinicians with decision-making in relationship to basal and postexercise values of cTnT in individuals with different training status. We evaluated the influence of 12Â weeks of high-intensity interval training [HIIT; repeated 4Â min cycling at 90% of maximal oxygen uptake (VÌO2max) interspersed with 3Â min rest, 200-300Â kJ per session, 3 or 4Â days each week] and work-equivalent moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT; continuous cycling at 60% VÌO2max) on resting cardiac troponinÂ T (cTnT) and the appearance of exercise-induced cTnT. Forty-eight sedentary obese young women were randomly assigned to HIIT, MICT or a control group. The VÌO2max and body composition were measured before and after training. At baseline, cTnT was assessed using a high-sensitivity assay at rest and immediately, 2 and 4Â h after 45Â min cycling at 60% VÌO2max. After a 12Â week training period, cTnT was assessed before and after 45Â min cycling at the same relative and absolute intensities as before training. Training led to higher VÌO2max and lower fat mass in both HIIT and MICT groups (all PÂ <Â 0.05). Before training, cTnT was significantly elevated in all three groups (by 35-118%, all PÂ <Â 0.05) with acute exercise. After training, both resting and postexercise cTnT concentrations (same relative intensity) were similar to\n\nEmotion, cognitive load and learning outcomes during simulation training.\n\nPubMed\n\nFraser, Kristin; Ma, Irene; Teteris, Elise; Baxter, Heather; Wright, Bruce; McLaughlin, Kevin\n\n2012-11-01\n\nSimulation training has emerged as an effective way to complement clinical training of medical students. Yet outcomes from simulation training must be considered suboptimal when 25-30% of students fail to recognise a cardiac murmur on which they were trained 1 hour previously. There are several possible explanations for failure to improve following simulation training, which include the impact of heightened emotions on learning and cognitive overload caused by interactivity with high-fidelity simulators. This study was conducted to assess emotion during simulation training and to explore the relationships between emotion and cognitive load, and diagnostic performance. We trained 84 Year 1 medical students on a scenario of chest pain caused by symptomatic aortic stenosis. After training, students were asked to rate their emotional state and cognitive load. We then provided training on a dyspnoea scenario before asking participants to diagnose the murmur in which they had been trained (aortic stenosis) and a novel murmur (mitral regurgitation). We used factor analysis to identify the principal components of emotion, and then studied the associations between these components of emotion and cognitive load and diagnostic performance. We identified two principal components of emotion, which we felt represented invigoration and tranquillity. Both of these were associated with cognitive load with adjusted regression coefficients of 0.63 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.99; p = 0.001) and - 0.44 (95% CI - 0.77 to - 0.10; p = 0.009), respectively. We found a significant negative association between cognitive load and the odds of subsequently identifying the trained murmur (odds ratio 0.27, 95% CI 0.11-0.67; p = 0.004). We found that increased invigoration and reduced tranquillity during simulation training were associated with increased cognitive load, and that the likelihood of correctly identifying a trained murmur declined with increasing cognitive load.

M.; Miramonti, Amelia A.; Hill, Ethan C.; Smith, Cory M.; Cochrane-Snyman, Kristen C.; Housh, Terry J.; Cramer, Joel T.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe examined the neuromuscular adaptations following 3 and 6 weeks of 80 vs. 30% one repetition maximum (1RM) resistance training to failure in the leg extensors. Twenty-six men (age = 23.1 Â± 4.7 years) were randomly assigned to a high- (80% 1RM; n = 13) or low-load (30% 1RM; n = 13) resistance training group and completed leg extension resistance training to failure 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Testing was completed at baseline, 3, and 6 weeks of training. During each testing session, ultrasound muscle thickness and echo intensity, 1RM strength, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) strength, and contractile properties of the quadriceps femoris were measured. Percent voluntary activation (VA) and electromyographic (EMG) amplitude were measured during MVIC, and during randomly ordered isometric step muscle actions at 10â100% of baseline MVIC. There were similar increases in muscle thickness from Baseline to Week 3 and 6 in the 80 and 30% 1RM groups. However, both 1RM and MVIC strength increased from Baseline to Week 3 and 6 to a greater degree in the 80% than 30% 1RM group. VA during MVIC was also greater in the 80 vs. 30% 1RM group at Week 6, and only training at 80% 1RM elicited a significant increase in EMG amplitude during MVIC. The peak twitch torque to MVIC ratio was also significantly reduced in the 80%, but not 30% 1RM group, at Week 3 and 6. Finally, VA and EMG amplitude were reduced during submaximal torque production as a result of training at 80% 1RM, but not 30% 1RM. Despite eliciting similar hypertrophy, 80% 1RM improved muscle strength more than 30% 1RM, and was accompanied by increases in VA and EMG amplitude during maximal force production. Furthermore, training at 80% 1RM resulted in a decreased neural cost to produce the same relative submaximal torques after training, whereas training at 30% 1RM did not. Therefore, our data suggest that high-load training results in greater neural adaptations that may explain the disparate increases\n\nMultifactorial monitoring of training load in elite rugby sevens players: cortisol/cortisone ratio as a valid tool of training load monitoring\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBouaziz, T; Makni, E; Passelergue, P; Tabka, Z; Lac, G; Moalla, W; Chamari, K\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe effectiveness of selected physiological and perceptual measures for monitoring training load and fatigue was studied in 16 male elite rugby sevens players during a 6-week intense training block (IT) and 2-week tapering (TAP). Daily training load (TL) and strain (TS) as well as weekly total score of fatigue (TSF) were quantified respectively by the session-rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method and an 8-item questionnaire. Also, testing was performed and 24 h urinary cortisol (C), cortisone (Cn), adrenaline (A) and noradrenalin (NA) excretion was measured before (T0) and after the IT (T1) and after the TAP (T2). The TL, TS and TSF increased during the IT and decreased during the TAP, in conjunction with a significant drop and improvement, respectively, of performance standards during the two periods. At T1, C and Cn levels increased while A and NA levels decreased, resulting in a higher C/Cn ratio and lower A/NA ratio, respectively. At T2, both C/Cn and A/NA returned to baseline values. The changes in C/Cn ratio, after the 6-week IT, were more closely related to mean TL, TS and TSF (r=0.75-0.76 vs. r=0.48-0.58, p<0.01) and to changes in the majority of performance measures than to A/NA ratio. Only the changes in C/Cn ratio after the 2-week TAP were related to mean TL, TS and TSF (r=0.61-0.68, p<0.01). The changes in hormone levels, training strain and performance standards reflected the physical and mental stressors of training, with complete recovery, as indicated by physiological homeostasis, achieved after an appropriate tapering period.

Exercise protocols ramp eccentric loads over an initial 3 weeks period in order to prevent muscle damage and delayed onset muscle soreness. Final training loads reach 400â500 W in rehabilitative settings and over 1200 W in elite athletes. Training is typically carried out three times per week for durations of 20â30 min. This type of training has been characterizes as moderate load eccentric exercise. It has also been denoted RENEW (Resistance Exercise via Negative Eccentric Work by LaStayo et al., 2014). It is distinct from plyometric exercises (i.e., drop jumps) that impose muscle loads of several thousand Watts on muscles and tendons. It is also distinct from eccentric overload training whereby loads in a conventional strength training setting are increased in the eccentric phase of the movement to match concentric loads. Moderate load eccentric exercise (or RENEW) has been shown to be similarly effective as conventional strength training in increasing muscle strength and muscle volume. However, as carried out at higher angular velocities of joint movement, it reduces joint loads. A hallmark of moderate load eccentric exercise is the fact that the energy requirements are typically 4-fold smaller than in concentric exercise of the same load. This makes moderate load eccentric exercise training the tool of choice in medical conditions with limitations in muscle energy supply. The use and effectiveness of moderate load eccentric exercise has been demonstrated mostly in small scale studies for cardiorespiratory conditions, sarcopenia of old age, cancer, diabetes type 2, and neurological conditions. It has also been used effectively in the prevention and rehabilitation of injuries of the locomotor system in particular the rehabilitation after anterior\n\nRelationships between rating-of-perceived-exertion- and heart-rate-derived internal training load in professional soccer players: a comparison of on-field integrated training sessions.\n\nPubMed\n\nCampos-Vazquez, Miguel Angel; Mendez-Villanueva, Alberto; Gonzalez-Jurado, Jose Antonio; LeÃ³n-Prados, Juan Antonio; Santalla, Alfredo; Suarez-Arrones, Luis\n\n2015-07-01\n\nTo describe the internal training load (ITL) of common training sessions performed during a typical week and to determine the relationships between different indicators of ITL commonly employed in professional football (soccer). Session-rating-of-perceived-exertion TL (sRPE-TL) and heart-rate- (HR) derived measurements of ITL as Edwards TL and Stagno training impulses (TRIMPMOD) were used in 9 players during 3 periods of the season. The relationships between them were analyzed in different training sessions during a typical week: skill drills/circuit training + small-sided games (SCT+SSGs), ball-possession games+technical-tactical exercises (BPG+TTE), tactical training (TT), and prematch activation (PMa). HR values obtained during SCT+SSGs and BPG+TTE were substantially greater than those in the other 2 sessions, all the ITL markers and session duration were substantially greater in SCT+SSGs than in any other session, and all ITL measures in BPG+TTE were substantially greater than in TT and PMa sessions. Large relationships were found between HR>80% HRmax and HR>90% HRmax vs sRPE-TL during BPG+TTE and TT sessions (r=.61-.68). Very large relationships were found between Edwards TL and sRPE-TL and between TRIMPMOD and sRPE-TL in sessions with BPG+TTE and TT (r=.73-.87). Correlations between the different HR-based methods were always extremely large (r=.92-.98), and unclear correlations were observed for other relationships between variables. sRPE-TL provided variable-magnitude within-individual correlations with HR-derived measures of training intensity and load during different types of training sessions typically performed during a week in professional soccer. Caution should be applied when using RPE- or HR-derived measures of exercise intensity/load in soccer training interchangeably.\n\nElite Junior Australian Football Players Experience Significantly Different Loads Across Levels of Competition and Training Modes.\n\nPubMed\n\nLathlean, Timothy J H; Gastin, Paul B; Newstead, Stuart; Finch, Caroline F\n\n2018-07-01\n\nLathlean, TJH, Gastin, PB, Newstead, S, and Finch, CF. Elite junior Australian football players experience significantly different loads across levels of competition and training modes. J Strength Cond Res 32(7): 2031-2038, 2018-Well-developed physical qualities such as high jumping ability, running endurance, acceleration, and speed can help aspiring junior elite Australian football (AF) players transition to the Australian Football League competition. To do so, players need to experience sufficient load to enhance their physical resilience without increasing their risk of negative outcomes in terms of impaired wellness or injury. The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in load for different levels of competition and training modes across one competitive season. Elite junior AF players (n = 562, aged 17.7 Â± 0.3, range: 16-18 years) were recruited from 9 teams across the under-18 state league competition in Victoria. All players recorded their training and match intensities according to the session rating of perceived exertion method. Training sessions were categorized according to skills, strength, conditioning, and other activities, whereas matches were identified according to level of competition. The loads in U18 state league matches (656.7 Â± 210.9 au) were significantly higher (p = 0.027) than those in school matches (643.3 Â± 260.9 au) and those in U18 representative matches (617.2 Â± 175.4). Players, who undertook more than one match per week, experienced significantly less load in subsequent matches (p < 0.001). Furthermore, U18 state league training sessions carried the most load when compared with other training modes. This article highlights that different combinations of training and match involvement affect overall player load, which may predispose players to negative outcomes such as impaired wellness or increased injury risk.\n\nThe Effect of Different Resistance Training Load Schemes on Strength and Body Composition in Trained Men\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLopes, Charles Ricardo; Aoki, Marcelo Saldanha; Crisp, Alex Harley; de Mattos, RenÃª Scarpari; Lins, Miguel Alves; da Mota, Gustavo Ribeiro; Schoenfeld, Brad Jon; Marchetti, Paulo Henrique\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of moderate-load (10 RM) and low-load (20 RM) resistance training schemes on maximal strength and body composition. Sixteen resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a moderate-load group (n = 8) or a low-load group (n = 8). The resistance training schemes consisted of 8 exercises performed 4 times per week for 6 weeks. In order to equate the number of repetitions performed by each group, the moderate load group performed 6 sets of 10 RM, while the low load group performed 3 sets of 20 RM. Between-group differences were evaluated using a 2-way ANOVA and independent t-tests. There was no difference in the weekly total load lifted (sets Ã reps Ã kg) between the 2 groups. Both groups equally improved maximal strength and measures of body composition after 6 weeks of resistance training, with no significant between-group differences detected. In conclusion, both moderate-load and low-load resistance training schemes, similar for the total load lifted, induced a similar improvement in maximal strength and body composition in resistance-trained men.

He was recovering from quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and had completed several weeks of traditional cardiac rehabilitation in his hometown, but the exercise program no longer met his needs. He wanted help in returning both to his normal training regimen and to powerlifting competition but was unable to attend the Dallas program in person. An exercise physiologist with the program devised a virtual coaching model in which the patient was sent a wrist blood pressure cuff for self-monitoring and was advised about exercises that would not harm his healing sternum, even as the weight loads were gradually increased. After 17 weeks of symptom-limited, high-intensity training that was complemented by phone and e-mail support, the patient was lifting heavier loads than he had before CABG. At a powerlifting competition 10 months after CABG, he placed first in his age group. This case report exemplifies the need for alternative approaches to the delivery of cardiac rehabilitation services.

High-intensity interval training might cause higher increases in cardiorespiratory fitness in comparison with moderate-intensity continuous training; nevertheless, current evidence is not conclusive. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the effect of high-intensity interval training with total load duration of 7.5 min per session. A randomized controlled trial will be performed on two groups of healthy, sedentary male volunteers (nâ=â44). The study protocol will include 24 exercise sessions, three times a week, including aerobic training on a treadmill and strength training exercises. The intervention group will perform 15 bouts of 30 s, each at an intensity between 90 % and 95 % of maximal heart rate. The control group will complete 40 min of continuous exercise, ranging between 65 % and 75 % of maximal heart rate. The primary outcome measure to be evaluated will be maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be evaluated as secondary outcome measures. Waist circumference, body mass index, and body composition will also be evaluated. Epidemiological evidence shows the link between VO2max and its association with chronic conditions that trigger CVD. Therefore, finding ways to improve VO2max and reduce blood pressure it is of vital importance to public health. NCT02288403 .

The majority of studies present a âpyramidalâ TID with a high proportion of high volume, low intensity training (HVLIT). Some world-class athletes appear to adopt a so-called âpolarizedâ TID (i.e., significant % of HVLIT and high-intensity training) during certain phases of the season. However, emerging prospective randomized controlled studies have demonstrated superior responses of variables related to endurance when applying a polarized TID in well-trained and recreational individuals when compared with a TID that emphasizes HVLIT or threshold training. The aims of the present review are to: (1) summarize the main responses of retrospective and prospective studies exploring TID; (2) provide a systematic overview on TIDs during preparation, pre-competition, and competition phases in different endurance disciplines and performance levels; (3) address whether one TID has demonstrated greater efficacy than another; and (4) highlight research gaps in an effort to direct future scientific studies.

R. M.; Le Pen, L. M.; Thompson, D. J.; Powrie, W.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nA train in motion applies moving steady loads to the railway track as well as dynamic excitation; this causes track deflections, vibration and noise. At low frequency, the spectrum of measured track vibration has been found to have a distinct pattern; with spectral peaks occurring at multiples of the vehicle passing frequency. This pattern can be analysed to quantify aspects of train and track performance as well as to design sensors and systems for trackside condition monitoring. To this end, analytical methods are developed to determine frequency spectra based on known vehicle geometry and track properties. It is shown that the quasi-static wheel loads from a moving train, which are the most significant cause of the track deflections at low frequency, can be understood by considering a loading function representing the train geometry in combination with the response of the track to a single unit load. The Fourier transform of the loading function describes how the passage of repeating vehicles within a train leads to spectral peaks at various multiples of the vehicle passing frequency. When a train consists of a single type of repeating vehicle, these peaks depend on the geometry of that vehicle type as the separation of axles on a bogie and spacing of those bogies on a vehicle cause certain frequencies to be suppressed. Introduction of different vehicle types within a train or coupling of trainsets with a different inter-car length changes the spectrum, although local peaks still occur at multiples of the passing frequency of the primary vehicle. Using data from track-mounted geophones, it is shown that the properties of the train load spectrum, together with a model for track behaviour, allows calculation of the track system support modulus without knowledge of the axle loads, and enables rapid determination of the train speed. For continuous remote condition monitoring, track-mounted transducers are ideally powered using energy harvesting devices. These need\n\nEffects of intensity and duration of exercise on muscular responses to training of thoroughbred racehorses.\n\nPubMed\n\nRivero, JosÃ©-Luis L; Ruz, Antonio; MartÃ­-Korff, Silvia; Estepa, JosÃ©-Carlos; Aguilera-Tejero, EscolÃ¡stico; Werkman, Jutta; Sobotta, Mathias; Lindner, Arno\n\n2007-05-01\n\nThis study examined the effects of the intensity and duration of exercise on the nature and magnitude of training adaptations in muscle of adolescent (2-3 yr old) racehorses. Six thoroughbreds that had been pretrained for 2 mo performed six consecutive conditioning programs of varying lactate-guided intensities [velocities eliciting blood lactate concentrations of 2.5 mmol/l (v2.5) and 4 mmol/l (v4), respectively] and durations (5, 15, 25 min). Pre- and posttraining gluteus muscle biopsies were analyzed for myosin heavy chain content, fiber-type composition, fiber size, capillarization, and fiber histochemical oxidative and glycolytic capabilities. Although training adaptations were similar in nature, they varied greatly in magnitude among the different training protocols. Overall, the use of v4 as the exercise intensity for 25 min elicited the most consistent training adaptations in muscle, whereas the minimal training stimulus that evoked any significant change was identified with exercises of 15 min at v2.5. Within this range, muscular adaptations showed significant trends to be proportional to the exercise load of specific training programs. Taken together, these data suggest that muscular adaptations to training in horses occur on a continuum that is based on the exercise intensity and duration of training. The practical implications of this study are that exercises for 15 to 25 min/day at velocities between v2.5 and v4 can improve in the short term (3 wk) the muscular stamina in thoroughbreds. However, exercises of 5-15 min at v4 are necessary to enhance muscular features related to strength (hypertrophy).\n\nUtility of the Conconi's heart rate deflection to monitor the intensity of aerobic training.\n\nPubMed\n\nPasselergue, Philippe A; Cormery, Bruno; Lac, GÃ©rard; LÃ©ger, Luc A\n\n2006-02-01\n\nThe Conconi's heart-rate deflection point (HRd) in the heart rate (HR)/speed curve is often used to set aerobic training loads. Training could either be set in percentage running speed or HR at HRd. In order to establish the limits and usefulness of various aerobic-training modalities for intermediate athletic level (physical-education students), acute responses were analyzed while running for a typical 40-minute training session. Speed, HR, lactate, and cortisol were thus recorded during training at 90 and 100% of running speed (RS: n = 14) and HR (HR: n = 16) at HRd (90% running speed [RS90], 100% running speed [RS100], 90% HR [HR90], and 100% HR [HR100]). During constant HR training, RS decreases while HR drifts upward during constant RS training. Half of the subjects can not finish the 40-minute RS100 session. For HR90, RS90, HR100, and RS100, average intensities are 67, 69, 74.9, and 77% maximal aerobic speed (multistage test), respectively. This study indicates that (1) training at HR100 and RS100 is more appropriate to improve high-intensity metabolic capacities (increased cortisol and lactate) while RS100 is too difficult to be maintained for 40 minutes for subjects at that level at least, (2) training at HR90, however, is better to improve endurance and capacity to do a large amount of work considering cortisol and lactate homeostasis, and (3) training at a constant HR using a HR monitor is a good method to control the intensity of the training with subjects not used to pacing themselves with the split-time approach.\n\nRelationships between training load, injury, and fitness in sub-elite collision sport athletes.\n\nPubMed\n\nGabbett, Tim J; Domrow, Nathan\n\n2007-11-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to develop statistical models that estimate the influence of training load on training injury and physical fitness in collision sport athletes. The incidence of training injuries was studied in 183 rugby league players over two competitive seasons. Participants were assessed for height, body mass, skinfold thickness, vertical jump, 10-m, 20-m and 40-m sprint time, agility, and estimated maximal aerobic power in the off-season, pre-season, mid-season, and end-season. Training load and injury data were summarised into pre-season, early-competition, and late-competition training phases. Individual training load, fitness, and injury data were modelled using a logistic regression model with a binomial distribution and logit link function, while team training load and injury data were modelled using a linear regression model. While physical fitness improved with training, there was no association (P=0.16-0.99) between training load and changes in physical fitness during any of the training phases. However, increases in training load during the early-competition training phase decreased (P= 0.04) agility performance. A relationship (P= 0.01-0.04) was observed between the log of training load and odds of injury during each training phase, resulting in a 1.50 - 2.85 increase in the odds of injury for each arbitrary unit increase in training load. Furthermore, during the pre-season training phase there was a relationship (P= 0.01) between training load and injury incidence within the training load range of 155 and 590 arbitrary units. During the early and late-competition training phases, increases in training load of 175-620 arbitrary units and 145-410 arbitrary units, respectively, resulted in no further increase in injury incidence. These findings demonstrate that increases in training load, particularly during the pre-season training phase, increase the odds of injury in collision sport athletes. However, while increases in training load\n\nHigh Intensity Interval Training for Maximizing Health Outcomes.\n\nPubMed\n\nKarlsen, Trine; Aamot, Inger-Lise; Haykowsky, Mark; Rognmo, Ãivind\n\nRegular physical activity and exercise training are important actions to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and maintain health throughout life. There is solid evidence that exercise is an effective preventative strategy against at least 25 medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, colon and breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Traditionally, endurance exercise training (ET) to improve health related outcomes has consisted of low- to moderate ET intensity. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that higher exercise intensities may be superior to moderate intensity for maximizing health outcomes. The primary objective of this review is to discuss how aerobic high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as compared to moderate continuous training may maximize outcomes, and to provide practical advices for successful clinical and home-based HIIT.

Twenty nine sedentary participants (36.3 Â± 6.9 yrs) at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease were recruited for 12 weeks of exercise training on a treadmill and cycle ergometer. Participants were randomised into three groups: CMIET + HIIT (n = 7; 8-12 x 60 sec at 100% VO2max, 150 sec active recovery), CMIET (n = 6; 30 min at 45-60% oxygen consumption reserv"
