        "text": "Fans in the Audi Dome Munich always have a treat as they get a smorgasbord of different kind of players racing up and down the floor from the home team from quick footed Malcolm Delaney who seemingly can draw a foul as easily as David Ortiz can squash an orange with his palm, Heiko Schaffartzik dazzling the fans with his wild and acrobatic shooting from outside as the only thing missing from his collection of amazing shots is trying to hit the bells in the city hall building at the top of the hour or big John Bryant making the zone as uncomfortable for opponents as it is for New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton to watch the Drive of Tom Brady in the recent 30-27 loss to the New England Patriots. Fans may not have as many familiar faces on the Fraport Skyliners to watch, but guys like Andrew Rautins who can shoot out the lights and exchange catch and pop stories with Heiko Scahffartzik, Dawan Robinson who can penetrate like a Georgia Bull dog without biting his opponent and having him for dinner, or Jacob Burtschi who will do anything on the court to win except for begging for shots like a well nourished dog who knows better but tries its luck. Both FC Bayern Munich and the Fraport Sklyiners have very talented players, but there is one difference in the rosters. When one releases the two numbers of 524 and 44, the difference is as great as it is for a poor dog having to cross the Rhine river or it is for Tim Tebow ever finding another NFL team as the closest he is too playing football now is touch football on the beach of Hawaii. These two numbers show the difference in international club games between the two clubs as FC Bayern Munich players have 524 and the Fraport Skyliner players have only 44 games. Fc Bayern Munich little used guard Steffen Hamann almost has twice as much as Frankfurt with 81 games. The Fraport Skyliners came into the game with a two game winning streak going up against the 4-0 FC Bayern Munich team and played without Quantez Robertson and Azit N’Diaye and got clobbered 97-65 as the experience factor was as huge as the Olympia tower compared to the bear that greets people who arrive to Munich on the highway. “Having the experience factor is huge for us. The club found many experienced players and that really has helped us so far. It is one of the reasons why we are 6-0. We gain experience each day and that will help us throughout the season”, stressed 2 time Beko BBL MVP John Bryant. After the loss Skyliner point guard Dawan Robinson was doing his stretching and got wide eyes when talking about the FC Bayern Munich experience. “Their vast experience showed tonight. They started quick and executed well and did the little things well. We fought against their experience, but it wasn´t easy playing against the best team in Europe”, stressed Philadelphia native Dawan Robinson. Despite the shell shocking, ex Alba Berlin guard Bryce Taylor tried to have comforting words for Frankfurt. “Our experience hurt them, but you play to get experience. I think these type of games will help them down the line. The German players will keep growing”, commented Bryce Taylor. Fraport Skyliner Konstantin Klein who played 21 minutes scoring seven points explained that it wasn´t only experience that hurt Frankfurt. “I don´t think that experience played so much a factor tonight as it does in close games. Munich worked harder than we did on rebounding and hustled more”, warned Konstantin Klein.\n\nFc Bayern Munich signed many top players, but Malcolm Delaney might be the best all around player that FC Bayern Munich picked up this summer to help bolster their guard play. Ex teammate Ilian Evtimov of Chalon France once classified the American as a player that can draw a foul on command. Drawing fouls wasn´t necessary against the Fraport Skyliners for Delaney as he finished with 15 points and dished out five assists. He may only be in his third professional season, but he plays as if he is a 10 year veteran. “Delaney is a player that always looks comfortable and never looks under pressure. He does everything well shooting and finding his teammates. The Munich win is credited to the whole team, but Delaney is a great player”, stressed Fraport Skyliner guard Konstantin Klein. Bryce Taylor gets to see the stellar play of Delaney each day and knows exactly what the American does well. “He has done a great job getting everyone involved this season. I like his moves off the dribble and the way he uses his size to get past defenders”, stressed ex Artland Dragon Bryce Taylor. Not only the experience of Delaney will help FC Bayern Munich, but also that he is a winner wherever he has played winning the France Pro A title with Chalon, winning the Ukraine cup with Kiev and reaching the Eurochallenge and Eurocup final four the last two years. On top of that he has always been a scoring option never averaging less than 14ppg his first two seasons in club and international play. John Bryant may be one of the superstars of the team, but he knows just how much worth a Delaney will have for helping the team win titles. “He is a great point guard that has great vision and is smart. He also does the little things well which is a big plus. He will help us a lot in crunch time in the future with how he can break down people”, stressed California native John Bryant.\n\nThe Fraport Skyliners entered the game riding on a two game winning streak and wanted to take the high of the big win against Wurzburg to Munich. They had to play without Quantez Robertson who continues to leave a big hole on defense and Senegal native Aziz N’Diaje who had to go home on account of personal reasons. The loss of the big man left a giant hole under the basket which put a huge load on the shoulders of young Germans Johannes Voigtmann and Danilo Barthel who had to defend first class, but also try to avoid getting into foul trouble. The Fraport Skyliners started out slow and had to play pickup basketball the rest of the game which effected their fatigue rate and mental state. “Munich started very fast and just ran us over. They executed very well and just did the easiest things well that we couldn´t take away from them. That made the game very easy for them. We got into foul trouble early and had to hold back. It isn´t easy defending John Bryant, but I did the best that I could”, stressed Danilo Barthel. It was also apparent to see that there wasn´t just a class difference, but possibly a two class difference. “They just out played us and were a lot better than us. They are a great team”, warned Dawan Robinson. FC Bayern Munich keep rolling past opponents and despite playing Euroleague in Poland 48 hours earlier and arriving back in Munich at 5am Saturday morning, the club played a very solid game playing their game, getting an early rhythm quick and despite some break downs at the start of the second quarter and third quarters, the team finished strong in the fourth quarter going on a 16-4 run to win by 32 points. “We had some lulls in the game, but that is part of the game. Our team focus is always to get the opponent uncomfortable with our defense and cause turnovers. We try to have our offense feed off our defense and we did that tonight”, stressed Bryce Taylor.\n\nFC Bayern Munich didn´t waste any time getting hot quick as they jumped out on a 10-0 lead. FC Bayern Munich spread out the scoring as Robin Benzing, Boris Savovic, Nihad Djedovic and John Byrant were successful from the field. Dawan Robinson finally got the Fraport Skyliners on the board with two lay ups as Klein connected with a no look pass and on the second the American tip toed to the basket like a child does on Christmas morning in the living room trying to get a sight of the presents and not get caught. Robinson then ended his 6-0 run with free throws. FC Bayern Munich got Frankfurt their fifth team foul early and got many free throws from guys like Yassin Idbihi and Djedovic. After Kevin Bright cut the Munich lead to 20-9, it was Robin Benzing that got hot with a three pointer and lay in. Jacob Burtschi took his hot shooting from the Wurzburg game and dropped a three pointer cutting the Munich lead to 25-12. FC Bayern Munich kept their fire power going ending the first quarter with a 7-2 run. Bryce Taylor electrified the crowd with a dunk and Idbihi hit one of his typical mid distance jumpers as FC Bayern Munich led 32-14. “Often when teams come back from Euroleague, you might await a less solid performance, but we played like a successful team with very much self confidence. You could see it with our body language. Recently against Ludwigsburg, they doubled our bigs so we shot from outside and today we went inside against Frankfurt with success”, stressed FC Bayern Munich youth coordinator Volker Stix. FC Bayern Munich was shooting 56% from the field and 0% from outside while the Fraport Skyliners were shooting 36% from the field and 25% from outside. FC Bayern Munich had the overwhelming 13-4 rebound edge and three turnovers while Frankfurt had four turnovers.\n\nThe Fraport Skyliners started out the second quarter with much focus and spirit stuffing the first six FC Bayern Munich possessions, but couldn´t capitalize on the stops except one Johannes Voigtmann free throw cutting the Munich lead to 32-15. FC Bayern Munich then put a dagger into the Fraport Skyliner defense as Heiko “I know every parking lot in Germany “Schaffartzik nailed two bombs for a lightening 6-0 run and 38-15 advantage. Danilo Barthel then led Frankfurt on a 4-0 mini run with a put back and dunk cutting the FC Bayern Munich lead to 38-19. Both teams kept scoring at a healthy rate as neither team could go on runs. After Troutman and Burtschi traded baskets, it was time for Delaney to nail a three pointer as Frankfurt trailed 45-21. Frankfurt would have little spurts of offense, but just didn’t have it on a consistent pace despite a Barthel floater from the corner and three pointer from Andrew Rautins who had been untypically cold to this point. The second quarter ended with a spectacular tip in from Barthel after a nice pass from Voigtmann and lay in from Chevon Troutman as FC Bayern Munich led 49-29 at the break. “We tried too much at the start of the second quarter and had too much one on one play. We continued to play with a lot of self confidence and our rebounding was good. It was quite out of the ordinary at the end of the second quarter where Frankfurt played with four Pro B players, but it is very important how Frankfurt has decided to have extra German players instead of filling their roster with another American player”, added Volker Stix. FC Bayern Munich was shooting 55% from the field and 33% from the three point line while Frankfurt was shooting 41% from the field and 22% from the three point line. Munich led the rebounding battle 17-12. Munich had seven turnovers and Frankfurt had eight turnovers.\n\nThe Fraport Skyliners started the third quarter again very motivated hurrying out on a 5-0 run with a Klein three pointer and Rautins jumper while getting three FC Bayern Munich stops. However this run didn´t annoy FC Bayern Munich as they shook it off like John Bryant does a smaller center who is jockeying for position going on a 9-0 run to extended their lead to 58-34. It was Heiko Schaffartzik again like in the second quarter who hurt Frankfurt with a three pointer and lay in. Savovic also produced a three pointer. “The Heiko shots were huge for us in both quarters. Our offense helps spark our defense which should be the other way around, but his shots really gave the team energy”, stressed John Bryant. Despite the run, the Fraport Skyliners didn’t hang their heads, but actually were able to dig into the FC Bayern Munich lead. After Vogtmann and Benzing exchanged buckets, the Fraport Skyliners went on a 7-0 run to cut the FC Bayern Munich lead to 61-45. Frankfurt was moving the ball very well, finding open shots and connecting. Rautins started the run with a three pointer, Voigtmann scored inside and Robinson then made a steal and went coast to coast scoring hard over John Bryant. FC Bayern Munich got some production from Heiko Schaffartzik from the free throw line and Bryce Taylor found some space slamming home a two handed dunk. However the Fraport Skyliners closed out the third quarter with a 6-0 run to cut the FC Bayern Munich lead to 67-53 and had some hope for the fourth quarter. Klein hit free throws, Voigtmann a layup and Robinson a jumper. Fc Bayern Munich was shooting 51% from the field and 43% from the parking lot while the Fraport Skyliners were shooting 45% from the field and 31% from the parking lot. FC Bayern Munich kept having the rebound edge 25-17, but 13 turnovers while Frankfurt had 12 turnovers.\n\nThe Fraport Skyliners wanted to keep cutting into the FC Bayern Munich lead in the fourth quarter and the quarter started with a Yassin Idbihi jumper which was followed by a Johannes Voigtmann tip in. The Fraport Skyliners then got a scare as Andrew Rautins was hit with his fourth and fifth fouls within 30 seconds giving him an early end to his basketball working day. “I don´t think that this was the turning point of the game. Their experience helped them pull out the win tonight”, expressed Fraport Skyliner forward Danilo Barthel. Fc Bayern Munich then went back to their old ways showing why they are averaging 94 points per game in the early going of the Beko BBL season going on a 10-2 run to have the 79-57 lead. On the run, FC Bayern Munich shone with the play of the double D´s Delaney and Djedovic who scored two buckets a piece. Especially the continued beauty of the play of Delaney was fascinating to watch as he held private shooting clinic´s just opting for tough shots like a fade away in the corner despite not being covered. When your up by 20 points and the team self confidence sky rocketing as if its July 4th, you can try out things even if a Pesic doesn´tactually approve of it. The Fraport Skyliners couldn´t muster anymore consistent offense in the last five minutes as FC Bayern Munich put an extra exclamation mark on a big win with an 18-6 run to show no mercy that they are on a mission this season to just win win win. FC Bayern Munich countered with two Chevon Troutmann three pointers, another tricky off balance shot by Delaney and little used Lucca Staiger who once scored 106 points in a youth game also nailed a three pointer ending the game with an easy 97-65 victory for Germany´s most famous sports team.\n\nFC Bayern Munich was led by Heiko Schaffartzik and Malcolm Delaney with 15 points a piece. Yassin Idbihi countered with 14 points. Chevon Troutman chipped in with 12 points and six rebounds. Nihad Djedovic added 10 points. The Fraport Skyliners were led by Johannes Voigtmann with 13 points, five rebounds, three assists and two blocks. Ander Rautins, Danilo Barthel and Dawan Robinson added 12 points a piece. FC Bayern Munich ended a superb working weekend with 59% from the field and 47% from outside while the Fraport Skyliners shot 45% from the field and 24% from outside. FC Bayern Munich won the rebound battle 29-22 and had 13 turnovers and Frankfurt had 17 turnovers. Despite losing by 32 points there are positives taken from the game. “I liked how Max Merz played and we fought very hard in the second half in our comeback until the last few minutes”, stressed Danilo Barthel. Sometimes a big loss like this can do wonders for a young team. “We improved a bit, and now we need to take our experience form the Munich game and apply it better in the next game”, warned Dawan Robinson."
