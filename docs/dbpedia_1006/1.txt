German basketball player Danilo Barthel has left Türkiye's Fenerbahçe Beko, the club confirmed on Monday.

In a statement, Fenerbahçe Beko said that Barthel, who played for the Istanbul team in 2020-2022, parted his ways with the club.

It was the German international's first overseas experience.

Fenerbahçe Beko also thanked the 30-year-old for his contributions to the team and wished him the best in his future endeavors.

Barthel previously played for Germany's USC Heidelberg, Fraport Skyliners, and Bayern Munich.

In 2016, he helped the Skyliners win the FIBA Europe Cup.

Barthel is a 2022 Turkish champion with Fenerbahçe Beko.

In the 2021-22 Turkish Airlines EuroLeague season, Barthel averaged 4.5 points and 1.5 rebounds per game.
