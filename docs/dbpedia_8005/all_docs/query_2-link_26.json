        "text": "Guildford, UK (Business Wire) – March 4, 2024 – Intellias, the global software engineering and digital consultancy company, has announced that it has consolidated its retail growth, expanding account growth by +40% in the last 12 months.\n\nAs well as adding over 40 new logos to its roster of global brands last year across all of its key sector verticals, including retail, financial services and mobility, Intellias now works with 12 leading international FMCGs and retailers on their digital transformation. These include department store Magasin du Nord, which was formerly owned by Debenhams until 2021, and TemaBit, part of the Fozzy Group.\n\nIntellias was also recognised for its work with existing clients, including Travis Perkins, having been shortlisted in a raft of 2023 industry awards, including the UK IT Industry Awards, the UK Ecommerce Awards and the Modern Retail Awards, for its work supporting the UK’s largest builders’ merchants’ B2B ecommerce capabilities.\n\nIn addition to rapidly increasing the number of new clients and expanding existing customer relationships, Intellias has also grown its ecosphere of retail technology partners. These strategic alliances enable Intellias to continue to provide best-of-breed tech solutions to brands and retailers, which unlock the digital experiences that drive value, growth and sales opportunities as well as delivering significant ROI. Already partnering with key technology leaders, including AWS, Microsoft and Google Cloud, in 2023 Intellias inked new strategic alliances with 13 partners, including ecommerce platform BigCommerce, headless commerce platform and MACH Alliance member Commercetools, Contentful, Blue Yonder and AI-site search solution, Bloomreach.\n\nWith digital transformation remaining a critical cornerstone for retail performance, we’re excited to be partnering with some of the best, forward-thinking solution providers that are delivering new capabilities to brands and retailers. Whether its unlocking Gen AI use cases, leveraging automation to drive supply chain and operational efficiencies or exploring new way to enhance shopper engagement digitally in-store via retail media, we’re able to bring together the systems integrations needed to maintain margin, increase sales and deliver far reaching ROI and value.\n\nIn 2023, Intellias continued its international expansion, opening new international markets including India, Colombia and Portugal. This follows 70% growth in 2022, which saw Intellias opening new offices in Croatia, Bulgaria, Spain, Portugal, and Poland and acquiring Digitally Inspired, a fast-growing UK-based development company focusing on retail and eCommerce industries. In 2024, Intellias will accelerate its international expansion, with further growth in the U.S. a key target.\n\nIntellias has supported its global growth trajectory with a wealth of new senior executive hires, having announced the appointment of Alexander Goncharuk as VP of Global Retail, bolstering its retail division with decades of digital transformation experience. It also announced the appointment of Anurag Tyagi as VP of Retail Sales in North America and Myles Bunbury as VP of Consumer Solutions, who also focuses on North America’s retail vertical, to accelerate the business’ retail capabilities and further expansion."
