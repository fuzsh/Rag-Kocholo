        "text": "Magasin is a Danish chain of department stores. It has seven department stores with its flagship store located on Kongens Nytorv in Copenhagen.\n\nIn May 2021, Peek & Cloppenburg acquired Danish department store chain Magasin du Nord from British retailer Debenhams in a £120 million deal.\n\nThe brand is described as:\n\n“Part of taking responsibility is about us understanding our role in the market. As a large company and an important player in the Danish retail landscape, Magasin cannot take responsibility for all partners’ ways of producing, but we can work in the future to create a framework that emphasizes responsible consumption, responsible production and responsible choices – both for ourselves and for the partners we work with. We can set an example for others to follow, and the goal is that our responsibility policy will help to boost the development of a more responsible lifestyle industry.\n\nConsumers trust and have confidence in Magasin, both as a brand and as a department store. Having trust in a company increasingly means that consumers expect that there is control over how the company affects the environment, climate and social conditions, and therefore we have based our work with responsibility on two core principles that have been developed on the basis of Magasin’s existing DNA: honesty and authenticity.”"
