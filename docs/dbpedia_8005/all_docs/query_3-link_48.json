        "text": "A visual consistency connecting to every touchpoint\n\nEstablished in 1868, Magasin Du Nord stands as Denmark’s oldest and largest chain of department stores. With 20 million annual visitors and revenues exceeding DKK 2.5 billion, Magasin strives to cultivate inspirational shopping experiences and emerge as one of Europe’s premier department stores. Committed to exceeding customer expectations, Magasin pledges to deliver “a little more” to its patrons.\n\nA contemporary design\n\nCollaborating closely with Magasin, we’ve undertaken a substantial rebranding effort, streamlining all platforms with a sleek and adaptable identity. Our focus has been on optimizing efficiency and reducing lead times in the marketing and design processes, spanning from pre-order stages to in-store launch events. This update encompasses a refreshed Magasin logo, a revamped Mad & Vin logo, and the introduction of new products and packaging.\n\nLogo Evolution\n\nSince its inception in 1952, the logo has remained largely unchanged and is widely recognized as a household symbol in Denmark. However, upon closer examination, it became apparent that some refinements were needed. The new logo preserves the original’s essence while receiving a much-needed modernization, optimized for new platforms and highlighting its unique features. For instance, the “M” now aligns with the italicized font, maintaining harmony throughout the design. Additionally, the iconic Magasin star now follows suit with the italic style. This evolution ensures the logo’s longevity and relevance for another 50 years, ensuring its continued success and recognition.\n\nA visual consistency connecting to every touchpoint\n\nEstablished in 1868, Magasin Du Nord stands as Denmark’s oldest and largest chain of department stores.
