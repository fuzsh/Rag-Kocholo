        "text": "Magasin oozes of nostalgia and surely creates great shopping memories through multiple generations. When the department store wanted to conquer the world of e-commerce, Alpha Solutions was chosen to solve the complex task of transforming the 150 years old brand and its extensive supplies to an online universe where the customer and shopping experience should live up to the same standards as in the physical stores.\n\nFROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL\n\nMagasin needed a local and agile solution partner who was able to handle big digital commerce solutions.\n\nThe Danish retail industry is very tough, and expectations about sales numbers are sky high. There is no margin for error. The same applies, of course, within e-commerce. There is no time for integrations that do not work.\n\nThe department store therefore chose Alpha Solutions to develop a modern webshop that could handle the diversity of the assortments and Magasin’s visual and well-known brand expression.\n\nWith the solution, there was also an intention to bring the customers closer to the company through loyalty programs, e.g. by integrating the Magasin Goodie Card.\n\nIT BEGAN ONLY WITH A WEBSHOP…\n\nIn May 2012, Alpha Solutions began working on Magasin’s online shop version 2.0. The webshop was developed on the already existing Demandware platform (now Salesforce Commerce Cloud), and things went fast. The new online shop was live just as planned in September 2012, only after four months. Alpha Solutions became the first in Scandinavia to build on Demandware.\n\nThe setup of the new shop was only the beginning though, of what should become a long and competent partnership. Alpha Solutions since helped and supported Magasin in their growth by integrating solutions that secured that the shop could live up to the high standards, a business with the caliber of Magasin demands.\n\nTHE COMPLEX PRODUCT VARIATION\n\nIt is without a doubt a comprehensive task to run an online assortment that contains of more than 300,000 products. Especially when there’s a significant difference in products, which means that the product pages are built differently to be modified to the given product. The associated ’brand stores’ all have specific requirements to the brand’s unique design on the site. A challenge that Alpha Solutions was able to handle with a deep business understanding."
