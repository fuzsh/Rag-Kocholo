For this purpose, cookies are used that allow an analysis of the use of the website by your users. The information generated thereby is transmitted to the server of the provider and stored there.\n\nYou can prevent this by setting up your browser so that no cookies are stored. The relationship with the web analytics provider is based on a European Commission adquacy decision: Privacy Shield.\n\nThe data processing takes place on the basis of the legal regulations of the § 96 Abs 3 TKG as well as the art 6 Abs 1 a) (consent) and / or f (legitimate interest) of the DSGVO.\n\nSince the privacy of our users is important to us, we insured that Google also is compliant with the GDPR and thus far, it seems as though the company is updating the system to be compliant\n\nThrough certain settings on your computer you can avoid the saving of cookies; however you might then not be able to use all functions of this website.
