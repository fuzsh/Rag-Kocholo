        "text": "// Debenhams has sold off its Magasin du Nord fascia to new owners in an undisclosed deal\n\n// Terms of the transaction with Peek & Cloppenburg have not been disclosed\n\n// It comes shortly after Debenhams exited the UK high street for good this month\n\nThe Danish department store fascia owned by Debenhams has been sold to a new owners in an undisclosed deal.\n\nDepartment Store Realisations Limited, formerly trading as Debenhams, today confirmed that it has agreed the sale of Magasin du Nord to Peek & Cloppenburg.\n\nThe terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nDebenhams London flagship to transform into new retail and office scheme\n\nDebenhams exits high street for good\n\nDebenhams Irish store staff approve compensation deal\n\nPeek & Cloppenburg is one of Europe’s leading multi-brand omnichannel fashion retailers, headquartered in Germany, with 140 stores in 15 countries.\n\nMagasin du Nord has seven stores – two in Copenhagen plus Lyngby, Odense, Aarhus, Rødovre and Aalborg, as well as an online business.\n\nIt was first acquired by Debenhams in 2009.\n\nThe news comes after Debenhams left the UK high street for good earlier this month. Its Irish operations shut down last year.\n\nDebenhams had shut down its remaining 28 stores across the UK on May 15, marking the final nail in the coffin in its 243 years of trading on the high street.\n\nThe department store had suffered slumping sales in recent years as shoppers moved away from traditional department store models.\n\nHowever, the enforced closure of sites during the Covid-19 pandemic was the final straw, resulting in the retailer falling into administration in April last year – just weeks after the first UK-wide lockdown began.\n\nDebenhams then went into liquidation in December after the administration process failed to secure any buyers to save the business. The administration did not include Magasin du Nord.\n\nAbout a month later in January, Debenhams’ brand, ecommerce operations and assets were purchased by Boohoo Group in a £55 million deal.\n\nThe deal did not include Debenham’s store estate, which spelled the end of the department store’s bricks-and-mortar operations."
