        "text": "Stunning Fort Robinson State Park comprises more than 22,000 acres of exquisite Pine Ridge scenery, compelling Old West history, exceptional lodging, scenic camping and the park’s own bison and longhorn herds.\n\nAs its name implies, Fort Robinson was operated as a fort from the early days of the Old West until after World War II. Many original buildings survive and remain in use at the park today, and others have been reconstructed. Fort Robinson was the site of the tragic Cheyenne Breakout in 1879 and the death of famed Sioux Chief Crazy Horse. Over the years, the fort served the Red Cloud Indian Agency, as a cavalry remount station, K-9 dog training center, POW camp and beef research station. It was established as a state park in 1962.\n\nFeatures\n\nBiking\n\nBoating\n\nCabins\n\nCamping\n\nCanoe/Kayak\n\nEquestrian trails\n\nFishing\n\nFood service\n\nHiking\n\nHunting\n\nLodging\n\nPicnicking\n\nPlayground\n\nSwimming\n\nTrail rides\n\nLodging options\n\nFort Robinson is a particularly popular destination for family reunions and has been named one of the nation’s top family reunion spots by USA Today, among other publications.

All options have kitchens, baths and bedrooms. Larger cabins also feature living rooms. Cabins are furnished with blankets, towels, stoves, refrigerators, silverware and cooking utensils.
