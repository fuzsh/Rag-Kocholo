        "text": "Debenhams shares plunged after the retailer issued its third profit warning for 2018, saying market weakness and competitor discounting had hit sales.\n\nThe department store chain suffered 1.7% drop in like-for-like sales over the 15 weeks to June 16, and said trading was \"below plan\" in May and early June despite weak comparatives from a year earlier.\n\nThe disappointing performance has forced the retailer to \"reassess\" expectations, with full-year pre-tax profits now set to come in between £35 million and £40 million, down from previous estimates of £50.3 million.\n\nIt marks Debenhams' third profit warning for the year, having first slashed forecasts in January on the back of painful price cuts.\n\nAnother update in April noted earnings would be at the lower end of forecasts after the retailer was gouged by extreme weather brought in by the Beast from the East.\n\nThe latest warning - sparked by \"increased competitor discounting and weakness in key markets\" - sent shares down more than 16% in early trading on Tuesday.\n\nFellow retailers also took a hit, sending the likes of Next down 1.4%, Burberry down 2.1% and Marks and Spencer Group down 1.1%\n\nDebenhams said further cost cuts are now on the cards, with a ramped-up efficiency drive set to focus on \"self-help and prioritising cash generation\".\n\n\"We also intend to conduct a strategic review of non-core assets, aiming to focus investment behind our strategy,\" it added.\n\nDebenhams executives said they are considering the sale of its Magasin du Nord subsidiary in Denmark, where it currently has six stores.\n\nIt will also look at disposing of a small in-house printing operation called Magenta, which prints materials for Debenhams and third parties and has an annual turnover of less than £10 million.\n\nThe company stopped short of announcing store closures but, as previously announced, it is still assessing whether to shut 10 of its outlets over the next five years, a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe footprint of up to 30 of its stores may also be reduced, while the leases of 25 locations may be renegotiated as they come up for renewal over the next five years.\n\nThe spokeswoman said no job cuts are currently planned.\n\nChief executive Sergio Bucher said: \"It is well documented that these are exceptionally difficult times in UK retail and our trading performance in this quarter reflects that.\n\n\"We don't see these conditions changing in the near future and, because it is our priority to maintain a robust balance sheet, we are making very careful choices about how we deploy capital.\"\n\nNicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the disappointing results \"will be all too familiar to long-suffering Debenhams shareholders\".\n\nHe added: \"Unfortunately it all feels like Debenhams is playing catch-up with an industry that's left it behind.\n\n\"Debenhams reckoned it was heading for something like £750 million in annualised digital sales at the half-year, compared to total sales of £2.3 billion in 2017.\""
