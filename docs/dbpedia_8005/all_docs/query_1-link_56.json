        "text": "U.K. department store Debenhams PLC will be liquidated, after an attempt to sell or restructure the business failed.\n\nDebenhams Group said in a statement this morning that its administrator, FRP Advisory, has concluded it should commence a wind-down of Debenhams UK, while continuing to seek offers for all or parts of the business. \"All reasonable steps were taken to complete a transaction that would secure the future of Debenhams. However, the economic landscape is extremely challenging and, coupled with the uncertainty facing the UK retail industry, a viable deal could not be reached,\" said Geoff Rowley, joint administrator to Debenhams and partner at FRP.\n\nJD Sports Fashion had in recent weeks been in discussions to buy Debenhams. However, the group announced that these talks have been terminated, reportedly as a result of the administration of Arcadia Group, whose brands Topshop, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins are sold in Debenhams stores.\n\nDebenhams said it will continue to trade through its 124 U.K. stores and online to clear its current and contracted stock. On conclusion of this process, if no alternative offers have been received, the U.K. operations will close. This does not impact Magasin du Nord in Denmark, which continues to operate independently.\n\nDebenhams filed for administration of its operating company on April 9.\n\nA pre-pack administration in April 2019 delisted Debenhams from the London Stock Exchange and handed control to lenders led by Silver Point Capital. Creditors then approved and completed a company voluntary arrangement in May 2019 that paved the way for rent reductions and the closure of up to 50 stores. The pre-pack administration and restructuring resulted in the firm restating debt of £200 million of first-lien notes, a £117.3 million second-lien piece, and a £302.7 million third-lien tranche. All tranches are due June 30, 2021."
