        "text": "Mike Ashley has ramped up his efforts to gain control of Debenhams as the department store chain puts in motion plans to secure £200m in new funding and has made an offer to buy its Danish business Magasin du Nord.\n\nDebenhams has also announced it will pursue a restructuring plan in a move which could wipe out existing shareholders, including the Sports Direct founder.\n\nHowever, Following the announcement this morning, Sports Direct issued a statement saying it had offered to buy Magasin du Nord.\n\nThe terms of the deal would involve installing Ashley as chief executive of Debenhams, to assist in its restructuring process.\n\nIt would also allow Debenhams to buy back the business at the same price in 12 months, and could even sell it to another bidder at a higher price.\n\n“Sport Direct believes its proposal would provide additional management and first-class leadership to Debenhams through this challenging period of restructuring, together with additional funding,” the company said.\n\nDebenhams is understood to consider the offer to be too low.\n\nSports Direct said in its statement that it had invited further details on valuation if the company believes the business to be worth more.\n\nDebenhams on Friday launched a consent solicitation for its lenders in a bid to secure up to £200m, a higher amount than previously thought.\n\nIf successful, the retailer will also embark on a restructuring in an effort to “secure the future of the business”.\n\nOptions are thought to include a debt-for-equity swap and a pre-pack administration, with the latter expected to be more likely as it does not require shareholder approval.\n\nBoth options would result in existing investors, including Sports Direct, losing their holdings in the company.\n\nA Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to speed up store closures and rent reductions could also be part of the plans, or come at a later stage.\n\nShares in Debenhams dropped as much as 91% in early trading on Friday, hitting a low of 0.25p. By mid-morning shares were changing hands for just under 2p.\n\nAshley, who owns just under 30% of Debenhams through Sports Direct, has been trying to oust the high street chain’s board and install himself in their place.\n\nOn Thursday, he reiterated his call for a shareholder vote on the proposal, which would see all directors except finance boss Rachel Osborne kicked out.\n\nHe already ousted former chairman Sir Ian Cheshire from the company in January by teaming up with fellow shareholder Landmark to vote against his re-election.\n\nChief executive Sergio Bucher was also removed as a director but has remained in his post for the time being.\n\nAshley had also offered Debenhams a loan, which it said would be considered."
