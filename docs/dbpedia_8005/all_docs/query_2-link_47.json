With guidance from Kristine Aronsson, the pre-health advisor at North Park, we were able to provide vaccines to many people.”\n\n— Dhruvi Patel C’22, Biomedical Sciences\n\nRead Dhruvi’s Full Story\n\n130 Stories of North Park\n\n“As a person who has always felt a calling to service, I was inspired by the Bible’s teachings that we must be good stewards of the earth. This led me to become co-president of the Green Team club at North Park and lead an initiative to have the cafeteria compost foods.”\n\n— Christopher Lempa C’18, Marketing and Spanish\n\nRead Christopher’s Full Story\n\n130 Stories of North Park\n\nThis academic year marks the 130th anniversary of the founding of North Park University–and one of the ways we will celebrate is by sharing 130 stories of North Park students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends.
