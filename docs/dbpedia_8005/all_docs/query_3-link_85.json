This surge comes amid enhanced bilateral relations and growing recognition of Australian products in Vietnam. 🌏 At the South Australia Wine Connect 2024 gala in Hanoi, Australian Ambassador Andrew Goledzinowski highlighted the deepening ties between the two countries, which have set the stage for expanded wine trade opportunities. 📈 The Vietnamese wine market, valued at $347.10 million in 2022, is expected to nearly double by 2030, reaching $692.27 million. This growth trajectory is fueled by rising disposable incomes and a robust retail sector that saw a nearly 20% increase in 2022. 🍷 The SA Wine Connect event extended to Ho Chi Minh City, featuring Master Class wine-tasting sessions that attracted hundreds of wholesalers and retailers. Renowned Australian wineries like Turkey Flat, First Drop, and Sorby Adams showcased their products, targeting sophisticated consumers aged 25 and above. 📚 These educational initiatives are proving crucial for Vietnamese wine enthusiasts, particularly those between 25 and 40 years old, who are increasingly seeking premium experiences. The success of these events has been amplified by significant social media buzz, underlining the growing importance of Vietnam as a key market for international wine exports. #WineIndustry #AustralianWine #MarketExpansion #Vietnam #CulturalExchange #BusinessGrowth\n\nAs we approach the end of the year, I would like to make a small reflection on ICCO Canada’s most recent event, ICCO Unico Primo Pentola d'Oro Awards, and share what our plans for the future are. The Pentola d’Oro Awards, an event that is very dear to me and already in its 11th edition, has, once again, resonated with you all and thanks to your participation I am proud to say it was a resounding success. The #foodandbeverageindustry plays an important role in various aspects of society. From an economic standpoint, it is a significant contributor to national and global GDP, and in many countries, it supports numerous businesses from farmers and producers to distributors and restaurants. Socially, it provides a key medium that fosters socialization. Moreover, it reflects the cultural diversity now widespread thanks to globalization. It is for this reason that we partner with, and support, various companies to promote the excellence of #Italianproducts here in Canada, driving #imports and #distribution. Throughout the year, we coordinate #masterclasses, #meetings and #tastingsessions that culminate with the Pentola d’Oro Awards during the Week of Italian Cuisine in the world. The Pentola d’Oro, born from the desire to promote the food and beverage industry in Ontario recognizes leaders who have dedicated their careers to its improvement and growth. This year we welcomed to our stage Dino Bianco from Kruger Products, who shared his extensive experience gained from leading the Kraft Group in the US and Canada, David Rocco, well-known for spreading his love for Italian food worldwide through his shows, Paul Spagnuolo, whose parents founded Fortinos and who now leads Pane Fresco, Fil Bucchino, dedicated to preserving groves and importing authentic olive oil, and Massimo Zitti, whose cocktail creations are widely appreciated in the city. A few years ago, we took a significant step towards promoting #authentic Italian taste by launching Buonissimo, featuring articles on Italian recipes, ingredients, and companies, and providing news on the local landscape. Italian cuisine has, in fact, a strong presence in Toronto’s diverse culinary scene, offering a taste of Italy’s culinary traditions without needing to travel. For the Italian-Canadian community, it serves as a connection point highlighting a distinctive cultural identity and promoting cross-cultural understanding. I believe CAMERA will symbolize exactly that. Conceived from the vision to propel ICCO Canada into the future, #CAMERA will be a hub that will support the entrepreneurial spirit of the next generation of Italian-Canadian business leaders, cultivate connections with international companies and encourage innovations. We are committed to celebrating #Italianculture, promoting #bilateraltrade all the while igniting the culinary passions and knowledge of many through our kitchen. I am looking forward to the day we will be able to welcome you into this new amazing space.\n\n🟢⚪️🟢 ANDALUCIA SHOWING CULINARY DELIGHTS IN VIETNAM 🥘 🍷🫒 What a pleasure to represent the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (SCCV) in this roadshow of Food & Beverage from Andalucía. Thank you Manuel Menéndez and Paola Castro for the invitation. The potential for Spanish food and beverage products in the Vietnamese market is big. Vietnam’s F&B industry has been growing rapidly, driven by factors such as population growth, rising household incomes, and changing consumer behaviors. Vietnam’s diverse cuisine and openness to trying new products present opportunities for foreign brands. The country’s F&B industry is recovering post-pandemic and is expected to continue its growth trajectory. Additionally, the increasing middle-class population and a substantial youth demographic could be key targets for Spanish F&B products. Spanish companies looking to enter the Vietnamese market should consider these trends and the preferences of Vietnamese consumers, who have shown a willingness to spend a significant portion of their income on food and beverages. With strategic market entry and understanding of local tastes, Spanish F&B products have the potential to find a receptive audience in Vietnam. Contact the Spanish Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam (SCCV) to explore further opportunities. #lacamara #spanishcchamber #foodandbeverageindustry #vietnam #spain\n\nOver 100 Australian businesses showed off the exciting possibilities of Australia’s high-quality food and beverage offering at Gulfood - The World’s Largest, Most Trusted F&B Sourcing Event on 17-21 February. 🥤🥫 A delegation of premium #FoodAndBeverage brands seeking to diversify their consumer base across the region convened at The Australia Lounge, thanks to partners Department for Trade and Investment South Australia, Global Victoria, and Trade and Investment Queensland.
