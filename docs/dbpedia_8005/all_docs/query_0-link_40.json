        "text": "Magasin du Nord is a Denmark-based retailer operating seven major department stores retailing products such as apparel, luxury cosmetics, household goods and gifts.\n\nHeadquartered in Copenhagen in the iconic building at the King’s New Square, the fashionable department store formerly traded as Debenhams and was acquired by Peek & Cloppenburg in May 2021. Peek & Cloppenburg is one of Europe’s leading multi-brand omnichannel fashion retailers, headquartered in Germany with 140 stores in 15 countries.\n\nMagasin were looking for a more modern Point of Sales (POS) solution which could become part of their omnichannel ecosystem. This meant being able to integrate into a new order management system easily and also having the ability to deploy new customer journey features into mobile channels at speed.\n\nCore to Magasin’s mission is connecting consumers to high-quality brands. In an omnichannel world this is only possible to achieve through inventory flexibility via a single, omnichannel cloud platform like Enactor, that combines mobile POS, self-checkout, order management system (OMS) and clienteling.\n\nMagasin will be deploying Enactor on Demand, a flexible omnichannel solution that will enable the retailer to deploy new features into stores quickly and easily, without large up-front investment. The cloud-enabled solution is a good functional fit for the retailer. Built with a flow-based architecture and distinctive microservices framework, Enactor on Demand offers Magasin the flexibility to choose from a suite of out- of- the- box features and also the freedom to extend its front end itself and add its own applications easily."
