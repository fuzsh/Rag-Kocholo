        "text": "Comments: NOTE: The below Blu-ray captures were ripped directly from the Blu-ray disc.\n\nFirstly, we intended to review this entire\n\nBlu-ray 'Coppola Restoration' package fully (as well as the supplemental 4th disc) but as interest is so high on these titles - we have also decided to compare them to the original SD releases first - as well as the SD-DVD 'Restoration' when it arrives. Stay tuned.\n\nAs for the middle entry in the series, the dual-layered second\n\nBlu-ray, taking up 46.6 GB for the 3+ hour feature film, has a much greater variance in color than in the first. It is significantly brighter and is a shade blue showing the older SD-DVDs to be extremely, unflatteringly (but authentic patina look?), greenish cast - looking as if it was shot through an aquarium fish tank! This restoration looks significantly improved to my eye. It shows as much - possibly even more - grain than the first entry and those anticipating dramatic detail improvement will be disappointed. The stock used will not support that look. Leonard Norwitz has covered the entire collection with more screen captures HERE. I'm slowly coming to the conclusion that this will be the best these films can look with the extensive low-lighting and grainy-filled image. It probably looks very close to how it was meant to.\n\nNOTE: I've done my best to match the captures below at the exact same frame.\n\nAgain in this first spin my ears didn't note a humungous difference in the TrueHD track (and the older 5.1), but more so than in The Godfather. I'll be examining this in closer detail during the week and conferring with our other Blu-ray reviewer Leonard Norwitz on his take.\n\nAside from the commentary there are no additional extras on this second\n\nBlu-ray disc. We will report more (the rest of the package) as soon as we can. Sean in email says: \"I just viewed your initial review/comparison of the first two Godfather Blu-rays and I wanted to chime in with my two cents. I saw The Godfather Coppola Restoration 35mm print at Film Forum in New York on Saturday and I have to say that the Blu-ray captures come closest to what I saw. Although I was never fortunate enough to see an original print in the theatre, I must assume that if Coppola restored them this way, that this is how he wants them to look, and therefore how they should look. The film I saw had clear and vibrant color that was, parodoxically, restrained. Nothing leapt off the screen at me, but everything seemed to have a sort of life on the screen that I haven't seen on the old DVD collection. I also noted an abundance of grain in the presentation, which was clearly visible in scenes using a brighter color palette.\" NOTE: 'The Godfather and The Godfather, Part II underwent extensive frame-by-frame examination and restoration utilizing state-of-the-art digital technology in this historic preservation effort, which required more than a year to complete. Robert A. Harris of the Film Preserve supervised the restoration under the direction of Coppola and cinematographer, Gordon Willis.'\n\n****\n\n- Gary Tooze."
