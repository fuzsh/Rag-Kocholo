        "text": "Half Million $ horse? I think it was the money and stud money he lost\n\nYes, the book definitely makes Paulie the traitor. They called someone at the phone company to check on calls involving Paulie and Clemenza. Paulie had talked to numbers associated with the Tattaglia family. Also it was the third time in a month he called in sick which made Vito suspicious although Fredo waived it off.\n\nVito always had tighter control over Clemenza feeling he was a bit too impulsive and hot-tempered. He didn’t feel that way about Tessio and kept the two somewhat separate so they wouldn’t gang up on Vito and overthrow him. When the hit came down, one of Sonny’s first phone calls was to Tessio and have his men become bodyguards of the Corleone compound in Long Beach. When Michael showed up, one of Tessio’s men didn’t recognize him but another did and vouched for him.\n\nIt's too bad that they didn't play this up in the movies -- it would have made Tessio's betrayal seem more shocking.\n\nThis is my favorite: “Fredo, you’re my older brother, and I love you. But don’t ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.”\n\nOnce our team (five attorneys) was involved in negotiations with a buyer over a significant subsidiary we were trying to sell and the junior person said something out of turn. The rest of us could see that the senior guy was none too happy. When we got back to our offices, he was about to say something when one of the other people used the above Godfather line. We all cracked up but the point was made."
