        "text": "‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my family, Kay. That‚Äôs not me.‚Äù ‚Äì Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)\n\nWith Hollywood still sputtering, now is the time to review some old favorites and see them in a new light. Such is the case with the Godfather Trilogy, one of the best films series ever made.\n\nEven better than the best selling book of the same name, which writer Mario Puzo said was more a rough draft. In the films, in collaboration with the great Francis Ford Coppola, we have the rare occasion of a film bettering the novel upon which it is based.\n\n*Different Drummer herself has new respect for The Godfather trilogy after watching all three films in a row, Godfather 3 being replaced by the newly released Coppola cut now named what the director and writer originally wanted: Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.\n\nOriginally rejecting what seemed to be a glamorized portrait of mobsters, after watching the whole trilogy in sequence, Different Drummer now realizes her earlier judgment was absolutely wrong.\n\nInstead of glamorizing the gangster life, The Godfather trilogy is a tragedy in the Shakespearean sense. A fatal flaw initiates its protagonist‚Äôs fall from grace. The conventional wisdom is that The Godfather is like Shakespeare‚Äôs King Lear, with Vito Corleone‚Äôs three sons competing for his love and attention in the same way Regan, Goneril and Cordelia did for King Lear, except, of course, that Cordelia, his best loved, did not compete at all.\n\nBut that analogy would make Vito Corleone the tragic hero, and it is clear that he is not. This myth is probably due to Marlon Brando‚Äôs oversized and memorable portrayal of Vito as well his unforgettable lines in the original Godfather film of 1972. Who can forget his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make him an offer he cannot refuse,‚Äù and the subsequent bloody scene in California involving the death of such a magnificent horse? And, of course, that voice, even more compelling than Clint Eastwood menacing whisper.\n\nAll that presence aside, though, it is Michael Corleone who is the tragic hero; it is his fall from grace that permeates all three films. And here he is much like Shakespeare‚Äôs Macbeth.\n\nAs in Shakespearian tragedies, the hero does not enter right away, but he is talked about to set up his stature. Vito Corleone, host at his daughter‚Äôs wedding, shows us his respect for Michael by waiting for his arrival to take the family wedding picture. And Michael‚Äôs late arrival is a sort of power play in itself, planned or not planned.\n\nBut the most essential quote from a trilogy is the line that the fine young actor Al Pacino literally throws away. Of course, that line nails the story arc that ignites everything. A lesser actor would have ‚Äústrutted it across the stage,‚Äù so to speak. But Michael just says matter of factly to Kay (Diane Keaton), his very WASP girlfriend,\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my family, Kay. That not me.‚Äù\n\nEverything about Michael shows him trying to separate himself from his family‚Äôs expectations, even the well-drawn path upward that Vito has planned ‚Äì Michael becoming a lawyer. But Michael cuts loose here, joining the Marines and becoming a war hero, too. The fact that he chooses to wear his military uniform to his sister‚Äôs wedding advertises that intent as well.\n\nBut as he says in later films, ‚ÄúJust when I thought I was out, they pull me back in.‚Äù\n\nExcept, that denies Michael‚Äôs free will. He did not have to be the one to volunteer to kill the crooked cop and Barzini (Richard Conte), the rival mob boss at the Italian restaurant. Was the war hero getting his own hero complex here? Maybe that is his fatal flaw.\n\nHe still has some idealism, though, and we see that in his time in Sicily, where he is thunderstruck by the beauty of Apollonia (Simonetta Stefanelli), her name the female version of Apollo, the sun god, appropriate for her blinding beauty. He woos her in the very traditional sense, patiently waiting for her hand. Maybe it is her death that changes him.\n\nSo when he returns to America and takes over the family business, it is a very different Michael who awkwardly intercepts Kay a full year after returning from Sicily. His marriage proposal is wooden, as is his almost perfunctory declaration of love. It is almost a business proposition he offers rather than a marriage proposal, and his new description of his role as mob boss defines the new Michael:\n\nMichael Corleone: I‚Äôm working for my father now Kay. He‚Äôs been sick, very sick.\n\nKay Adams: But you‚Äôre not like him Michael. I thought you weren‚Äôt going to become a man like your father. That‚Äôs what you told me.\n\nMichael Corleone: My father is no different than any other powerful man, any man who is responsible for other people, like a senator or a president.\n\nKay Adams: You know how naive you sound?\n\nMichael Corleone: Why?\n\nKay Adams: Senators and presidents don‚Äôt have men killed.\n\nMichael Corleone: Oh. Who‚Äôs being naive, Kay?\n\nThe difference between this and his courtship of Appolonia is stark and it is his relationship with Kay that best details Michael‚Äôs fall from grace.\n\nLater he lies to his wife Kay about ordering the death of his sister Connie‚Äôs (Talia Shire) husband, as he shuts Kay out of his life more and more. Connie (Talia Shire), however, is not so easily deceived. Throughout the saga, it is Connie who seems to know her brother best, and it is she who is sometimes able to persuade him against his stubbornness.\n\nGodfather 2 shows Michael wheeling and dealing, brutally disposing of those who get in his way, such as Moe Greene (Alex Rocco ) and Hyman Roth (master method actor coach Lee Strasberg) when they refuse to acquiesce to his plans for more and more power. The fact that these men are so powerful and well connected shows Michael‚Äôs ruthless ambition making him more and more like Macbeth\n\n‚ÄúI am in blood / Stepped in so far, that, should I wade no more,\n\nReturning were as tedious as go o'er.‚Äù\n\nBut it is with Kay that we see Michael‚Äôs utter debasement. When she intends to leave him, he doesn‚Äôt just slap her; her punches her in the face, then taking the children away and literally shutting door in her face after she visits them. What was a figurative shutting out in the earlier film is now literal.\n\nNot to mention having his brother Fredo killed.\n\n‚ÄúI know it was you, Fredo . You broke my heart. You broke my heart.‚Äù\n\nApparently, having Michael order the death of his own brother, or even having Fredo be the one who had betrayed him was not author and screenwriter Mario Puzo‚Äôs idea. It was Coppola who had to convince him to it. The compromise was that Michael would spare Freda as long as his mother was alive. And so it is shortly after Mama‚Äôs death that Fredo swims with the fishes.\n\nWhich gets us to the most disparaged film of the trilogy, Godfather 3, now out in a new form and Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Coreleone.\n\nOriginally this was supposed to be a stand a lone film. It premiered in 1990, 16 years after Godfather 2, which had followed Godfather 1 with a gap of only 2 years. Some speculate that Coppola never wanted to make this film, but a few poorly received films and the need for cash brought him around.\n\nThere are many reasons why The Godfather Part III failed to meet expectations. Here is an overview.\n\nThe Godfather Part III was a movie that Francis Ford Coppola never intended to make. The first two movies told the complete story of the rise and fall of Michael Corleone and the Corleone family. There was nothing more that needed to be added. But Paramount Pictures wanted Coppola to make a sequel. For fifteen years they begged him to helm the third installment, but he always refused. They tried to get other writers and directors to make the movie, but nothing ever materialized.\n\nUnfortunately, fate was smiling upon Paramount Pictures while aggressively frowning on Coppola. Almost all of Coppola's films during the 1980s took a beating at the box office.\n\n¬∑ One from the Heart flopped.\n\n¬∑ Rumble Fish underperformed.\n\n¬∑ The Cotton Club was a massive failure.\n\n¬∑ Gardens of Stone flopped.\n\n¬∑ Tucker: A Man and His Dream underperformed.\n\n¬∑ And finally, the New York Stories compilation not only performed poorly at the box office, but critics were quick to point out that Coppola's segment was the weakest of the bunch and the worst work of his career (the other segments were by Woody Allen and Martin Scorcese).\n\nPeggy Sue Got Married was Coppola's only success during the 80s (The Outsiders met expectations, but wasn't a success).\n\nThe string of flops left Coppola and his production company, American Zoetrope, in poor financial standing. Realizing that he needed the money, he agreed to make Godfather Part III. ‚ÄìAaron Ellis\n\nBut the real spanner in the works was the casting of Sofia Coppola in role of Michael‚Äôs teenage daughter, Mary.\n\nThe character of Mary Corleone proved to be a curse. Actress Rebecca Schaeffer was murdered after she auditioned for the part. Winona Ryder was cast in the role, but then dropped out at the start of filming due to \"exhaustion.\" Desperate for an actress who could work on short notice, Coppola ended up casting his daughter, Sofia, to play Mary. Sofia didn't want the role, but took it to appease her father, despite having no significant acting experience..‚Äì Aaron Ellis\n\nApparently Coppola turned down the studio recommendations for Madonna or Julia Roberts because he thought they were too old. He has said that he wanted Mary to still have the baby fat on her face, and 19-year-old Sofia Coppola did. Later, after her performance was panned, he opined that just as Mary took the bullet designed for her father Michael in the film, so Sofia, doing him a favor in taking he role, took the bullet his critics aimed at her performance.\n\nAt any rate, Different Drummer thinks the third film in this new cut is much better than the critics thought. Sofia as Mary doesn‚Äôt cut it for me either, but Al Pacino brings back some dignity to Michael, so that his final tragic fall hits us anew. Especially good is his final confession to Cardinal Lamberto (Raf Vallone), who is briefly the Pope before the corrupt Cardinals take him out:\n\nMichael Corleone: I betrayed my wife.\n\nCardinal Lamberto: Go on, my son.\n\nMichael Corleone: I betrayed myself. I killed men. And I ordered men to be killed.\n\nCardinal Lamberto: Go on, my son. Go on.\n\nMichael Corleone: It‚Äôs useless.\n\nCardinal Lamberto: Go on, my son.\n\nMichael Corleone: I killed, I ordered the death of my brother. He injured me. I killed my mother‚Äôs son. I killed my father‚Äôs son.\n\n[Michael breaks down]\n\nCardinal Lamberto: Your sins are terrible, and it is just that you suffer. Your life could be redeemed, but I know that you don‚Äôt believe that. You will not change.\n\nBut Michael does try to change. He cedes to Kay‚Äôs wishes and lets their son pursue a career in music instead of law, mirroring the young and idealistic Michael abandoning his father‚Äôs lawyerly plans for him when he joined the Marines. And it is on the culmination of that new career, with Michael having a kind of rapprochement with Kay and watching his son as the star tenor in a Sicilian opera that the final tragedy strikes.\n\nIf Michael had been killed off in Godfather 2, we probably would have cheered it on, but to have him spiritually killed here, after he has tried to redeem himself, elevates him to at least some stature so we also feel his anguished cry and lament his fall.\n\nWhat better choice for the long weekend ahead than to revisit this fine film trilogy and see it with new eyes?\n\nGodere!\n\n*It is said that if you find new meaning in an old book, it is not the book that has changed, but it is you. Perhaps that is true with films as well. Some age wonderfully, like The French Connection or Cool Hand Luke while other not so much (Play Misty for Me, unfortunately)\n\nThe earlier me could not get over what seemed to be glamorizing gangsters, especially given my Italian roots and my mother‚Äôs profound dislike of that genre, since she thought it made everyone think all Italians were gangsters. My own Italian grandfather, Vito ‚Äì yes, that was his name ‚Äì originally came over from Italy with a group who started a banking company in Chicago. But he found them crooked and left the group to open up the little grocery that supported his wife and 11 children as long as he lived.\n\n‚ÄìKathy Borich\n\nü•Åü•Åü•Åü•Å1/2\n\nTrailer"
