        "text": "Not even Diane Keaton was ready to defend The Godfather Part III after its release on Christmas Day in 1990.\n\n“When I saw it, I thought, Well, this movie doesn’t work,” Keaton, who starred as Kay Corleone in the acclaimed series, told Vanity Fair in a recent interview. “I had just dismissed it. I thought, No, it’s not good.”\n\nShe wasn’t alone. While reviews of director Francis Ford Coppola’s final Godfather film are stronger than its subpar reputation—Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin were both fans—The Godfather Part III has for years been branded a failure. Coppola rather famously was pushed into directing the film in the first place, after being told that Paramount had looked at other filmmakers to continue the saga. “It’s like when you have an ex-girlfriend: You hear about her and you say, ‘I don’t care.’ But you do care,” he said in 1990. “I wish they would just leave it alone and let it be finished and not have to get me jealous or possessive of it.”\n\nProduction was fraught from the start. Coppola didn’t even want to call the project The Godfather Part III, preferring instead to think of the movie as a definitive epilogue to the earlier films. Lead actress Winona Ryder, who was cast as the grown-up daughter of Kay and Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), exited the project in its early days, citing exhaustion. She was eventually replaced by Coppola’s own daughter, Sofia Coppola, whose performance was widely mocked. After the first two films won a combined nine Academy Awards, including two best-picture trophies, Part III was shut out altogether, despite multiple Oscar nominations.\n\nBut Coppola, who is famous for tinkering with his films, was never really done with The Godfather Part III. “There’s a cut I want to make that would be 14 minutes shorter,” Coppola told Deadline last year. “Usually, I go back and make them longer. This would be effective, and it makes the ending break your heart.”\n\nA year later, Coppola’s wish has become reality. As announced in September, a new version of The Godfather Part III—given the director’s approved if unwieldy title, Mario Puzo’s The Godfather, Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone—arrives in a limited theatrical release this week before a special edition Blu-ray become available on December 8. For the new version, Coppola cut down the opening to more quickly get into the heart of the story and made good on a previous promise to conclude Michael’s life with a fate “worse than death.”\n\n“It’s just brilliant what he did, in my opinion,” Keaton said of the new cut. “That’s what’s so annoying to me about myself. I saw it and I was so moved and touched. That includes the massive amount of it that’s just the film, not even the changes. That ending is really good. But what was really interesting to me as I was watching it is thinking, What the fuck were you thinking, Diane, when you saw it the first time? Like, it’s not up to par or something? What?”\n\nKeaton said she heard about Coppola’s new version of the film from the director himself. After not speaking for years, he called her up recently and invited her to the Paramount lot for a screening. There, she watched the film with Pacino and their fellow costars Andy Garcia, Talia Shire, and George Hamilton.\n\n“I saw it in a totally different light, a completely different point of view. It was touching and moving and the way he managed his daughter in this and the way he changed his story in the end,” she recalled. “It was a really important moment in my life. I was so thrilled. It was also really nice to see those people again, and it meant a lot that Francis did that. It was really kind of him.”\n\nKeaton was 26 when The Godfather was released. A young actress with a few credits to her name at the time, Keaton said she always felt like an outsider in the movie—a similarity she shared with Kay, who is literally left with a door closing in her face at the end of the first film. (“The door did close on my face,” Keaton said of how The Godfather’s iconic final shot came together.)\n\n“I got the part. I don’t even know why,” she recalled, adding that she auditioned with Martin Sheen and James Caan—both of whom were up for the role of Michael Corleone, in addition to Pacino. Coppola had to fight to get Pacino cast in the role. “He just held onto Al,” Keaton said. “He would have me work with the other two, and they were wonderful. But it was always Al.”\n\nKeaton and Pacino remained close over the years, even dating during the production of The Godfather Part III. “It was this really spectacular thing to happen,” she said of going back to play Kay years after The Godfather Part II. “There were many things about it that I enjoyed at the time. I had a great time when we made Part III. It was really special for me.”\n\nBut now, Keaton said, she’s cherishing the chance to watch the film again in a new light. “It’s like you’re going back in time to an experience in your life that was such a huge experience,” she said. “I’ll never get over it.”\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— The Crown: The True Story of the Queen’s Institutionalized Cousins\n\n— A Real-Life Chess Champion Talks The Queen’s Gambit\n\n— Prince Andrew’s Most Appalling Real-Life Antics Were Left Out of The Crown\n\n— Review: Hillbilly Elegy Is Shameless Oscar Bait\n\n— Inside the Obstinate Life of Bette Davis\n\n— The Crown: What Really Happened When Charles Met Diana\n\n— Diana’s Relationship With Princess Anne Was Even More Rocky Than in The Crown\n\n— From the Archive: Bette Davis on Her Failed Marriages and the Man Who Got Away\n\n— Not a subscriber?
