We hear a marching band playing in the background. The introduction is overlaid:\n\nTHE GODFATHER WAS BORN VITO ANDOLINI IN THE TOWN OF CORLEONE IN SICILY. IN 1901 HIS FATHER WAS MURDERED FOR AN INSULT TO THE LOCAL MAFIA CHIEFTAIN. HIS OLDER BROTHER PAOLO SWORE REVENGE AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE HILLS, LEAVING VITO, THE ONLY MALE HEIR, TO STAND WITH HIS MOTHER AT THE FUNERAL. HE WAS NINE YEARS OLD.\n\n[The marching band is followed by a procession of mourners including VITO and his MOTHER. There is a casket, apparently containing the body of VITO's father.

Would you please welcome SENATOR Pat GEARY of the state of Nevada, and there is Mrs. GEARY.\n\n[SENATOR GEARY walks up onto the stage]\n\nGEARY\n\nThank you very much, Ladies and Gentlemen -- and this is a very very happy day for me and ugh -- my wife, Mrs. GEARY. We see Nevada far too seldom -- but particularly today when we can -- we can join with old friends -- we can make new friends -- and we help celebrate -- a young man's first communion. And also, to thank that boy's family for a magnificent contribution to the state. I have here in my hand, a check -- made out to the University, and it is a magnificent endowment in the name of - uh, ANTHONY VITO Corleone -- and the check is signed by that young man's parents -- whom I think we should recognize Mike -- Pat -- uh, KAY -- stand up please -- stand up, let the folks see you. Folks, I want you to join with me in giving a real Nevada -- thank-you to Mr. and Mrs. MICHAEL Corleone!\n\n[The crowd claps. The conductor whispers something to GEARY.]\n\nWe also have as a special added attraction, the Sierra Boys Choir.

Alright. Now SENATOR, this is you and Mrs. Corleone.\n\n[The director comes over and gives GEARY the check and places him next to KAY. They also shake hands.]\n\nOkay that's enough, Senator --\n\n[MICHAEL an GEARY shake hands for one more picture, holding the check]\n\nCUT TO: EVERYONE listening to the choir.\n\nCUT TO: The interior of MICHAEL's office.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThis is my lawyer, TOM HAGEN; SENATOR GEARY. He's the one who arranged this whole thing through your man Turnbull.\n\nGEARY\n\nYes -- Yes.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nSit down.\n\nGEARY\n\nWell I was under the impression that you and I would talk alone.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI trust these men with my life, SENATOR. If I were to ask them to leave, it would be an insult.\n\nGEARY\n\nWell uh, it's perfectly all right with me, but I should tell you that I am a blunt man and I intend to speak very frankly to you -- maybe -- more frankly than anyone in my position's ever spoke to you before.\n\n[MICHAEL lights a cigarette]\n\nThe Corleone family has done very well here in Nevada. You own, or, you control, two major hotels in Vegas -- one in Reno. The licenses were grandfathered in, so there is no problem with the gaming commission. Now, my sources tell me that -- you plan to make a move against the Tropicalla. They tell me within a week -- you're gonna move Klingman out. That's quite an expansion. However it will leave with one little technical problem. Ahh -- The license will still be in Klingman's name.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nTurnbull is a good man.\n\nGEARY\n\nYeah, well let's cut out the bullshit. I don't want to spend any more time here than I have to. You can have the license, the price is 250,000 dollars. Plus a monthly payment of 5% of the gross -- of all four hotels. Mister -- Corleone.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNow the price of the license is less than 20,000 dollars, am I right?\n\nGEARY\n\nThat's right.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNow why would I ever consider paying more than that?\n\nGEARY\n\nBecause I intend to squeeze you. I don't like your kind of people. I don't like to see you come out to this clean country in your oily hair -- dressed up in those silk suits - and try to pass yourselves off as decent Americans. I'll do business with you, but the fact is, I despise your masquerade -- the dishonest way you pose yourself. Yourself, and your whole fucking family.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nSENATOR - we're both part of the same hypocrisy. But never think it applies to my family.\n\nGEARY\n\nAll right, all right -- some people have to play little games. You play yours. So lets just say that you'll pay me because it is in your interest to pay me. But I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow. And one more thing: don't you contact me again -- ever. From now on you deal with Turnbull.\n\n(then, to Al)\n\nOpen that door son.\n\n[He starts to leave]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nUh, senator -- you can have my answer now if you like. My offer is this -- nothing. Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would appreciate if you would put up personally.\n\nGEARY (laughing)\n\nGood afternoon, gentlemen.\n\n[He opens the door and walks out]\n\nKAY, I didn't know you were out here. Honey, we have to go -- we're 30 minutes late.\n\nKAY\n\nOh really? I'm sorry.\n\nGEARY\n\nMrs. Corleone, I've been delighted.\n\nKAY\n\nOh, no --\n\nGEARY\n\nThank you.\n\nKAY\n\n-- It was our pleasure. Thank you so much; it was wonderful talking with you.\n\nCUT TO: People dancing.

Hey, FREDO what's with the food around here?\n\nFREDO\n\nWhat's the matter.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nA kid comes up to me in a white jacket, gives me a Ritz cracker, and uh, chopped liver, he says Canapés. I say uh, uh, can o' peas my ass, that's a Ritz cracker and chopped liver!\n\n[FREDO laughs]\n\nPENTANGELI\n\n[Something in Italian, then] Bring out the peppers and sausage.\n\nFREDO\n\nAh, seeing you reminds me of New York -- the old days, huh!\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nHey, FREDO -- you remember, uh, WILLIE CICCI, he was with old man CLEMENZA in Brooklyn. Yeah, look here --\n\nFREDO\n\nLook, we were all upset about that, Frankie.

JOHNNY -- sit down. TOM isn't gonna sit in with us -- he only handles specific areas of the family business. TOM --\n\nTOM\n\nSure, Mike.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWhat are you drinking, JOHNNY?\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nAnisette.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nAnisette.\n\nTOM\n\nIf you need anything, Mike, I'll be outside, alright?\n\n[TOM walks out the door.]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nJust tell ROCCO we're waiting, TOM\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nI just left, uh, Mr. ROTH in Miami.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nHow's his health?\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nAhh -- it's not good.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nIs there anything I can do -- anything I can send?\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nHe appreciates your concern, MICHAEL -- and your respect. The casino you're interested in -- the registered owners are Jacob Lawrence, Allen Barclay - they're both Beverly Hills Attorneys. The real owners are the old Lakeville Road group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami. Meyer Klingman runs the store -- he runs a piece of it, too -- he does alright. But I've been instructed to tell you that if you move Klingman out, our friend in Miami will go along.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThat is very kind of him. You tell him, that's greatly appreciated.\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nHYMAN ROTH always makes money for his partners. One by one, our old friends are gone. Death -- natural or not - prison -- deported. HYMAN ROTH is the only one left -- because he always made money for his partners.\n\nCUT TO: Outside, PENTANGELI runs up to the stage.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nWha'? Wha'?

Now, why don't you stay with us - with the family. You can live here on the estate with your kids. You won't be deprived of anything and you can have everything you want. Now -- I don't know this MERLE -- I don't know what he does -- I don't know what he lives on. Now why don't you tell him that marriage is out of the question, and you don't want to see him anymore. Now he'll understand, believe me.\n\n[CONNIE and MERLE reach out to hold hands]\n\nCONNIE -- if you don't listen to me -- and marry this man -- you'll disappoint me.\n\nCUT TO: Outside, nighttime.

That'd be true if my father were still alive.\n\nMAMA CORLEONE\n\nConnie --\n\nCONNIE\n\nMERLE, you've met my sister-in-law, DEANNA.\n\n[They shake hands]\n\nFREDO's wife.\n\nDEANNA\n\nPleasure\n\nMERLE\n\nHow do you do.\n\nMAMA CORLEONE [to Tom, in Italian]\n\n[A reference to DEANNA and MERLE]\n\nTOM HAGEN [in Italian]\n\n[Responds]\n\nMERLE (to CONNIE)\n\nWhat did she mean by that?\n\nPENTANGELI (in Sicilian)\n\nHey, Michael - excuse me.

You know something, those daigos are crazy when it comes to their wives.\n\n[ROCCO walks up to FREDO]\n\nROCCO (to FREDO)\n\nMICHAEL says that if you can't take care of this -- I have to.\n\nFREDO\n\nMaybe you better.\n\nDEANNA\n\nNever marry a WOP! they treat their wives like shit!\n\n[ROCCO runs over and gabs he]\n\nI didn't mean to say WOP.

That's why at his moment you're the only one I completely trust. FREDO -- ah, he's got a good heart -- but he's week, and he's stupid, and this is life and death. TOM, you're my brother.\n\nTOM\n\nI always wanted to thought of as a brother by you, Mikey -- a real brother.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI know. You're gonna take over -- you're gonna be the Don.

They're killed by somebody close to us -- inside. Very, very scared they botched it.\n\nTOM\n\nWhat about your people ROCCO and NERI? You don't think that they had something to do with this.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYou see -- all our people are business men, their loyalty is based on that.

It's almost over -- you following the football game?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNope, not for a while I haven't.\n\nROTH\n\nI enjoy watching football in the afternoon, one of the things I enjoy about this country; baseball, too. I've loved baseball ever since Arnold Rothstein fixed the World Series in 1919.\n\n[They both chuckle.]\n\nI heard you had some trouble. Stupid -- people behaving like that with guns Important thing is, that you're alright. Good health -- the most important thing in the world. More than success, more than money -- more than power.\n\n[MICHAEL stands up and shuts the door; moves the chairs closer as ROTH turns up the TV.]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI came here because there is gonna be more blood shed. I want you to know about it before it happens so that there's no danger of starting another war.\n\nROTH\n\nNobody wants another war.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nFRANK PENTANGELI came to my home and he asked my permission to get rid of the Rosato brothers. When I refused, he tried to have me killed. He was stupid, I was lucky; I'll visit him soon. The important thing is that nothing interferes with our plans for the future. Yours and mine.\n\n[ROTH shakes his head.]\n\nROTH\n\nNothing is more important.\n\n[There is a long pause between them, then.]\n\nYou're a wise and considerate young man\n\nMICHAEL\n\nAnd you're a great man, Mr. ROTH.

What we'll do together in the next few months will make history, MICHAEL -- history. It's never been done before.

In my bedroom, were my wife sleeps! Where my children come and play with their toys. In my home.\n\n[A long pause, MICHAEL sits down.]\n\nI want you to help me take my revenge.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nMICHAEL, anything -- what can I do?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nSettle these troubles with the Rosato brothers.\n\n[PENTANGELI is confused.]\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nMike, I don't understand, I don't -- look -- I don't have your brain -- uh -- for big deals -- but this is a street thing. That HYMAN ROTH in Miami -- he's backing up those son of a bitches.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI know he is.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nWhy do you ask me to lay down to them Mike?\n\n[A long pause.]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nIt was HYMAN ROTH that tried to have me killed. I know it was him.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nNow -- Jesus Christ, Mike, Jesus Christ. Look, let's get 'em all -- let's get 'em all now, while we got the muscle.\n\n[Another long pause then MICHAEL stands up.]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThis used to be my father's old study -- it's changed. I remember there used to be a big desk, righthere. I remember when I was a kid, Frankie, we had to be very quiet when we played near here. I was very happy that this house never went to strangers -- first CLEMENZA took it over, now you. My father taught me many things here -- he taught me in this room.\n\n(then, as Michael sits beside PENTANGELI)\n\nHe taught me -- keep your friends close but your enemies closer. Now, if HYMAN ROTH sees that I interceded in this thing, and the Rosato brothers failed him, he's gonna think his relationship with me is still good. Capide?\n\nPENTANGELI\n\n[Acknowledge in Italian.]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThat's what I want him to think. I want him completely relaxed, and confident, in our friendship. Then I'll be able to find out who the traitor in my family was.\n\nCUT TO: The bedroom of FREDO's house-late night. FREDO and DEANNA are sleeping. The telephone begins to ring.

A man runs in front of JOHNNY OLA's car and the driver honks the horn at him. A Cuban police officer walks up to the car and talks to the driver.\n\nOFFICER\n\n[Something in Spanish]\n\n[We see OFFICERS making an arrest of a rebel.]\n\nDRIVER\n\nHe say that they're making an arrest and that in a few minutes he'll let us through.\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nIt's nothing. Just some lousy bandits. The police are cleaning them up.\n\n[The rebel pushes a police captain into the car and explodes a grenade that he had hidden in his jacket.]\n\nCUT TO: On top of a Cuban building. A birthday cake for HYMAN ROTH is wheeled toward him and a small group of people. The cake has a drawing of Cuba on it.\n\nROTH\n\nI hope my age is correct -- I'm always accurate about my age. Make sure that everyone sees the cake before we cut it. I'm very pleased you were all able to come from such distances to be with me today. When a man comes to this point in his life -- he wants to turn over the things that he's been blessed with -- turn them over to friends. As a reward for the friends he's had -- and to make sure everything goes well after he's gone.\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nNot for years.\n\nEVERYONE\n\nHear! Hear!\n\nROTH\n\nWell, we'll see; the doctors would disagree, but what do they know? These are wonderful things that we've achieved in Havana -- and there's no limit to where we can go from here. This kind of Government knows how to help business...to encourage it -- the hotels here are bigger and swankier than any of the rug joints we've put in Vegas -- and we can thank our friends in the Cuban government -- which has put up half of the cash with the Teamsters on a dollar for dollar basis -- has relaxed restrictions on imports. What I am saying now is we have what we have always needed -- real partnership with the government.\n\n[The waiter brings over a piece of cake but ROTH rejects it.]\n\nSmaller piece.\n\n(then, to the group)\n\nYou all know MICHAEL Corleone -- and we all remember his father. At the time of my retirement -- or death -- I turn over all my interests in the Havana operation --\n\nMICHAEL (to WAITER)\n\nGrazie\n\nROTH\n\n-- to his control. But -- all of you will share. The National will go to the Lakeville Road boys. The Capri to the Corleone Family. The Sevilla Biltmore, also, but Eddie Levine of Newport will bring in the Pennino Brothers -- Dino and Eddie - for a piece, and also to handle the actual casino operation. And we've saved a piece for some friends in Nevada, to make sure things go smooth back home. I want all of you to enjoy your cake -- so, enjoy.\n\nGUESTS\n\nHappy Birthday!\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI saw an interesting thing happen today. A rebel was being arrested by the military police, and rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had hidden in his jacket. He killed himself, and took a captain of the command with him.\n\n[ROTH looks concerned]\n\nRight JOHNNY.\n\nJOHNNY OLA\n\nThose rebels, you know, they're lunatics.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nMaybe so -- but it occurred to me. The soldiers are paid to fight -- the rebels aren't.\n\nROTH\n\nWhat does that tell you?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThey can win.\n\nROTH\n\nThis county's had rebels for the last fifty years -- it's in their blood, believe me, I know. I've been coming here since the 20's. We were running molasses out of Havana when you were a baby -- the trucks, owned by your father. MICHAEL --\n\n[ROTH tilts his head, a sign for MICHAEL to talk to him alone. The get up and walk.]\n\n-- I'd rather we talked about this when we were alone. The two million never got to the island.\n\nCUT TO: The inside of ROTH's room in the Capri. ROTH is lying on the couch talking to MICHAEL.\n\nROTH\n\nI wouldn't want it to get around that you held back the money because you had second thoughts about the rebels.\n\n[A long pause as MICHAEL paces.]\n\nSit down MICHAEL.\n\n[He pats a chair.]\n\nSit down.\n\n[MICHAEL sits down next to ROTH.]\n\nIf only I could live to see it -- to be there with you. Uh, what I wouldn't give for -- twenty more years. Here we are protected -- free to make our profits without key follow with the goddamn Justice Department and the FBI. Ninety miles away, partnership with a friendly government -- ninety miles. It's nothing. Just one small step, looking for a man that wants to be President of the United States -- and having the cash to make it possible. MICHAEL, we're bigger than U.S. Steel.\n\nCUT TO: Outside the Capri, a car that is driving FREDO from the airport pulls up. A man opens the door and another man gets his luggage. FREDO is caring one suitcase of his own. The porter tries to take it from him but FREDO pulls it away. He walks into the Capri.\n\nCUT TO: Inside the Capri, FREDO an MICHAEL embrace. The people in the room are MICHAEL, FREDO and MICHAEL's BODYGUARD.\n\nFREDO\n\nMikey -- how are you, okay?\n\n[FREDO walks over to MICHAEL's BODYGUARD.]\n\nHi, uh, Freddie Corleone.\n\n[FREDO holds out his hand and MICHAEL acknowledges in Italian that it's okay.]\n\nJesus Christ, what a trip -- the whole time I'm thinkin' what if somebody knows what I got in here. Can you imagine that, huh? Two million dollars in the seat next to me in the plane?\n\n[He opens up the briefcase, unzips it, and begins to show MICHAEL the money. He then looks over at the BODYGUARD.]\n\nWhoop, excuse me.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNo, it's okay.\n\nFREDO\n\nYou wanna count it?\n\n[MICHAEL doesn't answer instead he pats FREDO on the cheek.]\n\nFREDO\n\nMICHAEL, what the hell is goin' on anyway? I'm totally in the dark.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThe family's making an investment in Havana --\n\n[MICHAEL takes the briefcase over to a guard.]\n\n-- This is a little gift for the PRESIDENT.\n\nFREDO\n\nOh -- well that's great -- Havana's great -- it's my kinda town -- anybody I know in Havana?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nOh, HYMAN ROTH, JOHNNY OLA.\n\n[FREDO looks distracted.]\n\nFREDO\n\nNo -- I never met them.\n\n[There is a long pause as we hear sirens in the background.]\n\nListen, Mikey, I'm uh -- I'm kind of, uh --\n\n[MICHAEL lights a cigarette for FREDO.]\n\n-- I'm kinda nervous from the trip. Can I -- can I get a - a drink or something?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI thought maybe we'd -- we'd go out together. I know a place we can spend some time together - okay?\n\nCUT TO: An outside café where MICHAEL and FREDO are sitting at a small table together.\n\nFREDO\n\nSometimes I think I shoulda married a woman like you did -- like KAY. Kids -- have a family. For once in my life -- be more like -- Pop.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nIt's not easy to be his son -- it's not easy.\n\nFREDO\n\nYou know MAMA used to tease me. She'd say, uh - \"You don't belong to me; you were left on the doorstep by gypsies.\" Sometimes I think it's true.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYou're no gypsy, FREDO.\n\nFREDO\n\nMikey -- I was mad at you.\n\n[There is a long pause as FREDO shuffles around.]\n\nWhy didn't we spend time like this before? You wanna drink right? WAITER!\n\n[A waiter walks up to them.]\n\nPor Favor -- how do you say \"banana daiquiri\"?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nBanana daiquiri.\n\nFREDO\n\nThat's it?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYes.\n\nFREDO\n\nUno Banana Daiquiri.\n\nWAITER\n\nBanana Daiquiri.\n\nFREDO\n\nSi -- and uh -- a club soda.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nSENATOR GEARY is flying in from Washington tomorrow night with some people -- some government people. I want you to show them a good time in Havana.\n\nFREDO\n\nMy specialty, right?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nCan I trust you with something, FREDO?\n\nFREDO\n\nOf course, Mike.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nLater on in the evening we're all invited to the Presidential Palace reception, to bring in the New Year. After it's over - they're gonna take me home in a military car -- alone -- for my protection. Before I reach my hotel, I'll be assassinated.\n\n[The waiter comes with their drinks.]\n\nWAITER\n\nGracias\n\nFREDO\n\nWho?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nROTH.\n\n[FREDO glances on with surprise.]\n\nIt was ROTH who tried to kill me in my home. It was ROTH all along. He acts like I'm his son -- his successor -- but he thinks he's gonna live forever -- and he wants me out.\n\nFREDO\n\nHow can I help?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nJust go along as if you know nothing. I've already made my move.\n\nFREDO\n\nWhat move?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nHYMAN ROTH will never see the New Year.\n\nCUT TO: Inside ROTH's Havana room in the Capri. JOHNNY OLA guides MICHAEL and his BODYGUARD into the room were ROTH is. A DOCTOR has inspected ROTH and begins to talk to MRS. ROTH in Spanish.]\n\nMRS. ROTH [translating the DOCTOR]\n\nSays you have to take it easy. And he's gonna give you a prescription. He'll be back tomorrow.\n\nROTH\n\nI want my own doctor. Fly him in from Miami - I don't trust a doctor can't speak English.\n\nMRS. ROTH\n\nGracias, señor\n\nROTH\n\nHoney, go down to the casino.\n\nMRS. ROTH\n\nWell, if you're sure you're felling better.\n\nROTH\n\nFeell fine. Play the bingo game.\n\nMRS. ROTH\n\nAlright.\n\n[Then to MICHAEL.]\n\nNice to see you Mr. Paul. Just make yourself at home.\n\n[After she's left.]\n\nROTH\n\nMy sixth sense tells me your brother FREDO brought a bag full of money. Where is it?\n\n[MICHAEL is silent.]\n\nYou're pulling out?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nJust wanna -- I just wanna wait.\n\n[ROTH and JOHNNY OLA exchange worried glances.]\n\nHow do you fell?\n\nROTH\n\nTerrible -- I'd give four million just to be able to take a piss without it hurting.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWho had FRANK PENTANGELI killed?\n\nROTH\n\nThe -- Rosato brothers.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI know -- but who gave the go ahead. I know I didn't.\n\n[Once again JOHNNY OLA and ROTH exchange glances. This time ROTH is mad.]\n\nROTH\n\nThere was this kid I grew up with -- he was younger than me. Sorta looked up to me -- you know. We did our first work together -- worked our way out of the street. Things were good, we made the most of it. During Prohibition -- we ran molasses into Canada -- made a fortune -- you father, too. As much as anyone, I loved him -- and trusted him. Later on he had an idea -- to build a city out of a desert stop-over for GI's on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Green -- and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man -- a man of vision and guts. And there isn't even a plaque -- or a signpost -- or a statue of him in that town! Someone put a bullet through his eye. No one knows who gave the order -- when I heard it, I wasn't angry; I knew Moe -- I knew he was head-strong, talking loud, saying stupid things. So when he turned up dead -- I let it go. And I said to myself, this is the business we've chosen -- I didn't ask who gave the order -- because it had nothing to do with business!\n\n[He turns around and thinks of what he just said.]\n\nThat two million -- in a bag in you room. I'm going in to take a nap -- when I wake, if the money's on the table, I'll know I have a partner -- if it's not, I'll know I don't.\n\n[ROTH and JOHNNY OLA leave. MICHAEL looks over at his BODYGUARD who understands.]\n\nCUT TO: The Presidential Palace. Dancers performing on the stage.\n\nCUT TO: A woman dancer begins to sing.\n\nCUT TO: The Corleone table.

But it's worth it -- watch -- you're not gonna believe this.\n\nGEARY\n\nI don't believe it already.\n\nFREDO\n\nHuh? Fifty dollars, right?\n\nGEARY\n\nYou got a bet, Mister.\n\n[On stage, two women in black drag a girl out on stage and tie her to a pole. A man walks out from behind the curtain.]\n\nFREDO\n\nThat's him -- that's Superman.\n\n[MICHAEL looks over at his BODYGUARD. On stage two more women throw Superman on the ground. As everybody looks on he opens his robe to the girl tied to the pole. Then he drops the robe from his shoulders. EVERYONE screams and shouts when they see why he is called Superman.]\n\nFREDO\n\nDid I tell ya, or did I tell ya?\n\nGEARY\n\nI don't believe it!\n\nREEVES\n\nThat thing's gotta be fake!\n\nFREDO\n\nThat ain't no fake, that's real -- that's why they call him Superman.\n\nGEARY\n\nHey, Freddie - Freddie, where did you find this place?\n\nFREDO\n\nJOHNNY OLA told me about this place. He brought me here. I didn't believe him -- but seein' is believin', huh?\n\n[MICHAEL glances over at FREDO.]\n\nJUDGE DEMALCO\n\nI see it, and I still don't believe it!\n\nFREDO\n\nFifty bucks, Pat. Old Man ROTH would never come here, but Old Man JOHNNY knows these places like the back of his hand. Now watch him -- he's gonna break a cracked with it.\n\nGEARY\n\nBreak a cracker -- I want to see him break a brick.\n\n[MICHAEL turns and signals to his BODYGUARD then turns back. He looks at the floor and then covers his face with his hand. He is in great pain realizing that FREDO is the Family traitor]\n\nCUT TO: HYMAN ROTH's room in the Capri. JOHNNY OLA walks out onto the balcony and looks around. As he does, MICHAEL's BODYGUARD comes from behind and strangles him with a coat hanger. MICHAEL's BODYGUARD walks over to ROTH's room and opens the door. Inside are MRS. ROTH, two DOCTORS, and ROTH on the bed.\n\nDOCTOR #1\n\nRelax, Señor ROTH, we're taking you to the hospital.\n\n[As they take his blood pressure he winces in pain.

Above is a banner that reads \"FELIZ AÑO NUEVO\" [\"Happy New Year\"]\n\nCUT TO: SENATOR GEARY talking to some girls and a Cuban politician.\n\nGEARY\n\nAnd in my judgment ,you'll continue to get those, because I don't believe that PRESIDENT Eisenhower well ever pull out of Cuba -- not as long as we have over one billion dollars invested in this country.\n\n[He toasts with a couple of the guests. FREDO stands up and begins to walk out]\n\nNow, the American public believes in non-intervention --\n\n[MICHAEL walks over to meet FREDO]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nFREDO -- where you goin'?\n\nFREDO\n\nI gotta get me a real drink, 'cause I can't --\n\n[He trails off and walks away.]\n\nCUT TO: A long shot of everyone dancing.\n\nCUT TO: The hospital. MRS. ROTH looks at HYMAN and begins to cry. Two men walk away from HYMAN's bed. MICHAEL's BODYGUARD walks up the stairs and down the hall with flowers.

Many people are still dancing.\n\nCUT TO: GEARY walking over to REEVES, FREDO, and, MICHAEL.\n\nREEVES\n\nWhat's kept Mr. ROTH?

Just long enough to ring in the New Year.\n\n[As they speak the Military Police walk through the Dance Hall towards and into a room with the PRESIDENT.]\n\nCUT TO: ROTH's hospital room.

As he is driving, Don FANUCCI jumps into the car.\n\nFANUCCI [in Italian]\n\nGo, Go! Young man, I hear you and your friends are steeling goods. But you don't even send a dress to my house. No respect! You know I've got three daughters. This is my neighborhood. You and your friends should show me some respect. You should let me wet my beak a little.\n\n[FANUCCI reaches into the back of the truck and pulls out a dress.]\n\nI hear you and your friends cleared $600 each. Give me $200 each, for your own protection. And I'll forget the insult. You young punks have to learn to respect a man like me!\n\n[FANUCCI steps on the break.]\n\nOtherwise the cops will come to your house. And your family will be ruined. Of course if I'm wrong about how much you stole -- I'll take less. And by less, I mean -- a hundred bucks less. Now don't refuse me. Understand, paisan? Understand, paisan?\n\nVITO\n\nI understand.

Don't worry.\n\n[VITO walks over and gets his spaghetti.]\n\nVITO [in Italian]\n\nNow what I say stays in this room. If you both like, why not give me $50 each to pay FANUCCI? I guarantee he'll accept what I give him.\n\nTESSIO [in Italian]\n\nIf FANUCCI says $200 -- he means it, VITO!\n\nVITO [in Italian]\n\nI'll reason with him. Leave everything to me. I'll take care of everything. I never lie to my friends. Tomorrow you both go talk to FANUCCI. He'll ask for the money. Tell him you'll pay whatever he wants. Don't argue with him. I'll go and get him to agree. Don't argue with him since he's so tough.\n\nCLEMENZA [in Italian]\n\nHow can you get him to take less?\n\nVITO [in Italian]\n\nThat's my business.

You understand, don't you?\n\n[FANUCCI laughs and takes back the money.]\n\nFANUCCI [in Italian]\n\nYou've got balls, young man! How come I never heard of you before? You've got a lot of guts. I'll find you some work for good money.\n\n[FANUCCI stands and gets his jacket.]\n\nNo hard feelings, right?

All she has id her neighborhood.\n\nROBERTO\n\nI already rented the place to another family.\n\n[ROBERTO begins to walk away.]\n\nVITO\n\nI told her that I'd talk to you. That you're a reasonable man. She got rid of the animal that caused the trouble. So let her stay.\n\n[ROBERTO says something in Italian.]\n\nAre you Sicilian.\n\nROBERTO\n\nNo, I'm Calabrese.\n\nVITO\n\nWe're practically paisan, do me this favor.\n\nROBERTO\n\nI already rented it!

For years now a growing number of my constituents have been of Italian decent -- and I have come to know them well. They have honored me with their support and with their friendship. Indeed I can proudly say some of my very best friends are Italian-Americans. However, Mr. CHAIRMAN, at this time very unfortunately I have to leave these proceedings in order to preside over a very important committee of my own committee. But before I leave I do want to say this. These hearings on the Mafia are in no way what-so-ever a slur upon the great Italian people. Because I can state from my own knowledge and experience -- that Italian-Americans are among the most loyal -- most law-abiding -- patriotic, hard working American citizens in this land. And it would be a shame. Mr. CHAIRMAN if we allowed a few rotten apples to bring a bad name to the whole barrel. Because from the time of the great Christopher Columbus up through the time of Enrico Fermi right up to the present day -- Italian-Americans have been pioneers in building and defending our great nation. They are the soil o' the earth and one of the backbones of this country.\n\n[GEARY walks off in applause. He poses for a picture.]\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nI think we all agree with our esteemed college. Now Mr. Corleone you have been advised as to your legal rights. We have testimony from a witness -- a previous witness, one -- WILLIE CICCI. He has stated that you are the head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country. Are you?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNo I'm not.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nThe witness has testified that you are personally responsible -- for the murder of a New York City police Caption in 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo. You deny this?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYes I do.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nIs it true that in -- in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the so-called five families in New York. Who assume and consolidate your nefarious power.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThat's a complete falsehood.\n\nANNOUNCER\n\nMr. QUESTADT\n\nQUESTADT\n\nIs it true that you have a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNo it is not true -- I own stock in some of the hotels there -- but very little.\n\n[TOM whispers something into MICHAEL's ear.]\n\nI also have stock in IBM and IT&T.\n\nQUESTADT\n\nMr. Corleone do you have any interests or control over gambling or narcotics -- in the state of New York.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNo I do not.\n\nTOM\n\nSENATOR my client would like to read a statement before this committee.\n\nSENATOR\n\nMr. CHAIRMAN -- Mr. CHAIRMAN -- I think this statement is totally out of order at this time.\n\nTOM\n\nSir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with utmost sincerity -- he has not taken the 5th amendment as it was his right to do. So in all fairness I think the statement should be heard.\n\n[QUESTADT whispers something to the CHAIRMAN.]\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nNo, no I'm going to allow Mr. Corleone to read his statement -- I'll put it in the record.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nIn the hopes of clearing my family name -- and in the sincere desire to give my children the fare share of the American way of life, without a blemish on their name and background -- I have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power. I find it a great dishonor for me personally to have to deny that I am a criminal. I wish to have the following noted for the record. That I served my country faithfully and honorably in World War two and -- was awarded the Navy Cross for action in defense of my country. That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime what-so-ever. That no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy whether it is called \"Mafia\" or \"Cosa Nostra\" or whatever other name you wish to give has ever been made public. I have not taken refuge behind the 5th amendment as it was my right to do. I challenge this committee -- to produce any witness or evidence against. And if it do not -- I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have now besmirched it.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nI'm sure we're all quite impressed. Particularly with your love for our country. The committee will stand in recess until ten o'clock when this committee will produce a witness who collaborates the charges that were made against you today. And at which time Mr. Corleone you may very well be subject to indictment for perjury. I remind you that you're still under soepeana Mr. Corleone. This court is adjured.\n\nCUT TO: Inside an Army Barrack PENTANGELI sits on a couch.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nTen to one -- ten to one shot you said -- ten to one shot he would take the 5th -- and I lose.

Nobody gets near you -- you're not goin' anywhere.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nAh that's great -- that's beautiful -- some deal I made.\n\nFBI MAN #2\n\nAh, you'll live like a king -- you'll be a hero. You'll live better in here than most people on the outside.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nSome deal, sheesh.\n\n[PENTANGELI throws the que on the pool table.]\n\nCUT TO: The compound TOM is leaning against a brick wall.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nAlive -- PENTANGELI is alive. How'd they get their hands on him?\n\nTOM\n\nROTH. He engineered it MICHAEL. Frankie went to make a deal with the Rosato Brothers -- and they tried to kill him. Our people with the New York detectives said he was half dead, scared stiff, and calling out loud that you'd turned on him. They'd already had him on possession, bookmaking, murder 1, and a lot more.\n\nNERI\n\nThe FBI has him air-tight -- he's on an army base twenty-four hour guards.\n\nTOM\n\nNo way we can get to him. If we don't it's up to five counts of perjury.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWhat about FREDO? What does he know?\n\nTOM\n\nHe says he doesn't know anything -- and I believe him. ROTH well he -- he played this one beautifully.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI want to talk to FREDO.\n\nCUT TO: MICHAEL walking into the boat house. ROCCO leaves and FREDO stays in his chair. MICHAEL sits down.\n\nFREDO\n\nI haven't got a lot to say Mike.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWe have time.\n\nFREDO\n\nI was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWhat about now. Is there anything you can help me out with. Anything you can tell me now.\n\nFREDO\n\nThey've got PENTANGELI that's all I can tell you.\n\n[MICHAEL stands up.]\n\nFREDO\n\nI didn't know it was gonna be a hit Mike -- I swear to god I didn't know it was going to be a hit. JOHNNY OLA bumped into me in Beverly Hills -- and he said that he wanted to talk -- he said that you and -- and -- ROTH were in on a -- a -- big deal together. And that there was something in it for me if I'd help 'em out. He said that -- he said that -- you were bein' tough on the negotiations. But if they could get a little help -- and close the deal fast -- it'd be good for the family.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYou believed that story. You believed that.\n\nFREDO\n\nHe said there was something in it for me -- on my own.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI've always taken care of you FREDO.\n\nFREDO\n\nTaken care of me. You're my kid brother and you take care of me. Did you ever think about that -- did you ever once think about that. Send FREDO off to do this -- send FREDO off to do that! Let FREDO to take care of some Mickey Mouse night club somewhere! Send FREDO to pick somebody up at the airport! I'm your older brother Mike and I was stepped over!\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThat's the way Pop wanted it.\n\nFREDO\n\nIt ain't the way I wanted it! I can handle things I'm smart -- not like everyone says -- not dumb, smart and I want respect!\n\nMICHAEL\n\nIs there -- you can tell me about this investigation?\n\nFREDO\n\nThe Senate Lawyer QUESTADT -- he belongs to ROTH.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nFREDO you're nothing to me now you're not a brother, you're not a friend, I don't want to know you or what you do -- I don't want to see you at the hotels -- I don't want you near my house -- when you see our mother I want to know a day in advance, so I won't be there -- you understand.\n\n[FREDO doesn't answer. MICHAEL walks off.]\n\nFREDO\n\nMikey.\n\nCUT TO: AL NERI sitting in a chair. MICHAEL walks up to him.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI don't want anything to happen to him while my mother's alive.\n\nCUT TO: The Army base. A man who looks like PENTANGELI is escorted to a jeep. Another door is opened and the real PENTANGELI walks out dressed like an office.\n\nCUT TO: Inside the Senate Committee room PENTANGELI is escorted in.\n\nREPORTER\n\nHere he comes now.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nMore people that a ball game in here. Hey that's WILLIE CICCI.\n\nCICCI (O.S.)\n\nFrankie Five Angles.\n\nCUT TO: MICHAEL being frisked by some guards. The man behind him is also frisked.\n\nCUT TO: PENTANGELI looks at the man behind MICHAEL.\n\nCUT TO: The man behind MICHAEL looks right back.\n\nCUT TO: PENTANGELI seems to be in a trance.\n\nCUT TO: MICHAEL looks at the stares the two men exchange.\n\nCUT TO: The man still looks at PENTANGELI.\n\nCUT TO: PENTANGELI finally looks away.\n\nCUT TO: PENTANGELI stands next to the witness' table.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nThis Committee will come to order, please.\n\nDISLOVE TO: The crime family tree sign.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nState your name, please.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nFRANK PENTANGELI.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nAnd where were you born?\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nPar Panico -- it's outside of Palermo\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nAnd where do you live now?\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nI live -- uh -- in an army barracks with the FBI guys.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nWe have here finally a witness that will further testify to MICHAEL Corleone's rule over a crime empire that controls all the gambling in this country and perhaps other countries. This witness has had no buffer between himself and MICHAEL Corleone. He can corroborate our charges on enough counts for this committee to recommend a count of perjury against MICHAEL Corleone. SENATOR.\n\nSENATOR\n\nThank you.\n\n[MICHAEL is whispering something to the man who was behind him earlier. PENTANGELI watches them.]\n\nMr. PENTANGELI -- Mr. PENTANGELI. Were you a member of the Corleone family? Did you serve under Caporegime Peter CLEMENZA -- under VITO Corleone -- also known as -- \"The Godfather\"?\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nI -- I -- I never know no Godfather.I got my own family, SENATOR.\n\nQUESTADT\n\nMr. PENTANGELI you are contradicting a sworn statement that you previously made to me and signed. I ask you again sir -- you are now under oath -- were you at any time a member of a crime organization -- headed by MICHAEL Corleone.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nI don't know nothin' about that.. Oh -- I was in the Olive Oil business with his father but that was a long time ago that's all.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nWe have a sworn affidavit -- we have it -- your sworn affidavit that you murdered on the orders of MICHAEL Corleone. Do you deny that confession, and do you realize what will happen as a result of your denial.\n\nPENTANGELI\n\nLook the FBI guys promised me a deal. So I made up a lot of stuff about MICHAEL Corleone 'cause that's what they wanted -- but it was all lies -- uh -- everything. And I kept saying -- MICHAEL Corleone did this and MICHAEL Corleone did that -- .uh -- so I said yea sure, why not.\n\nSENATOR #2\n\nMr. Corleone would you kindly identify for the committee the gentleman sitting to your left.\n\nTOM\n\nI can answer that. His name is Vincenzo PENTANGELI.\n\nSENATOR #2\n\nIs he related to the witness?\n\nTOM\n\nI believe he is in fact his brother.\n\nQUESTADT\n\nWill he come forward and be sworn sir?\n\nTOM\n\nSENATOR this man does not understand English. He came at his own expense to aid his brother in his time of trouble. He's not under soepena -- and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.\n\nQUESTADT\n\nAre you saying that he knows nothing about these matters.\n\nTOM\n\nTo my knowledge nothing.\n\nCHAIRMAN\n\nI'm gonna find out what the hell happened here! Alright this committee is now adjourned. The witness is now excused.\n\nTOM\n\nSENATOR! SENATOR! This committee owes an apology, this committee owes an apology -- an apology SENATOR!\n\n[TOM tells something to PENTANGELI's brother in Italian.]\n\nCUT TO: The outside of the Hotel Washington.\n\nCUT TO: A room inside the Hotel Washington. KAY is watching MICHAEL fill out some papers with ROCCO.\n\nKAY\n\nMICHAEL -- excuse me.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nHello darling.\n\nKAY\n\nThe children are outside we're going.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWhat d"
