        "meta_description": "Godfather 2 is widely considered the greatest film sequel of all time. Two storylines run through the film, Vito Corleone's (Robert De Niro) arrival in the United States in 1901 and Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) attempt to expand the family business in the late 1950s. The earlier scenes are set in New York City while the later scenes are filmed at the Corleone family home in Lake Tahoe and a pre-Communist Cuba. This US One Sheet poster is from the films first release and includes the classic Godfather image of the puppeteer pulling strings. The font style has been widely copied by 'The Sopranos' and 'Snoop Dog' amongst others. The folder is in very fine folded condition. n nThe round white/black objects you may see in the corners are magnets, used to photograph the posters. They have not damaged the posters in any way.",
