A low flat rate for the rest of the world.\n\nSize: 76 cm x 102 cm (30 in x 40 in).\n\nA guaranteed original U.S. '30x40' movie poster for Francis Ford Coppola's fantastic 1974 sequel \"The Godfather: Part 2\", based on the characters created by Mario Puzo and starring Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Robert De Niro, John Cazale and Talia Shire.\n\nThe sequel to 1972's epic serves as both a prequel and sequel to The Godfather. One story follows Pacino's Michael Corleone as he becomes head of the Corleone family. The other explores his father's (De Niro) journey from Sicily to New York mafia boss.\n\nOn release, the film polarised critics, but it is now considered one of the greatest films of the Twentieth Century. It would win Coppola the Best Picture and Best Director Oscars, with De Niro picking up the Best Supporting Actor Award. (He was one of three actors from the film nominated!)\n\nIt would be followed in 1990 by The Godfather Part 3.\n\nThis superb poster is a rarer '30x40' format. These posters were produced for use outside of a U.S. movie theatre and so were printed on thicker card-like paper stock. They were also, crucially, unfolded!\n\nThis example shows signs of its near fifty years. It has pin-holes around the edges and the bottom left corner in particular has been knocked around. HOWEVER, the central poster image has come through all of that pretty well and this poster will look fantastic framed and on display! (In our on-line images, we imagine it framed with a mount, with the mount sized to fit the central image, with the white border hidden from sight behind it.)\n\nThis really is a fantastic find!"
