        "text": "FADE FROM BLACK: Int. of Don Corleone's home office -day\n\nBONASERA (seated in front of the Don's desk, facing the camera)\n\nI believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the\n\nAmerican fashion. I gave her freedom, but -- I taught her never to dishonor her family. She\n\nfound a boyfriend; not an Italian. She went to the movies with him; she stayed out late. I\n\ndidn't protest. Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made\n\nher drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her\n\nhonor. So they beat her, like an animal. When I went to the hospital, her nose was a'broken.\n\nHer jaw was a'shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain.\n\nBut I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life -- beautiful girl. Now she will\n\nnever be beautiful again.\n\n[Bonasera breaks down. The Don gestures to Sonny to give Bonasera a drink]\n\nSorry...\n\n[Bonasera, taking the drink, sips from the shot glass]\n\nI -- I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The\n\njudge sentenced them to three years in prison -- suspended sentence. Suspended sentence!\n\nThey went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastard,\n\nthey smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, \"for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.\"\n\nVITO CORLEONE (sitting behind his desk, petting a cat)\n\nWhy did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?\n\nBONASERA\n\nWhat do you want of me? Tell me anything. But do what I beg you to do.\n\nVITO CORLEONE\n\nWhat is that?\n\n[Bonasera gets up to whisper his request into Don Corleone's ear]\n\nThat I cannot do.\n\nBONASERA\n\nI'll give you anything you ask.\n\nVITO CORLEONE\n\nWe've known each other many years, but this is the first time you came to me for counsel,\n\nfor help. I can't remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of\n\ncoffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here: you\n\nnever wanted my friendship. And uh, you were afraid to be in my debt.\n\nBONASERA\n\nI didn't want to get into trouble.\n\nVITO CORLEONE\n\nI understand. You found paradise in America, had a good trade, made a good living. The\n\npolice protected you; and there were courts of law. And you didn't need a friend of me. But\n\nuh, now you come to me and you say -- \"Don Corleone give me justice.\" -- But you don't ask\n\nwith respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me Godfather. Instead,\n\nyou come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you uh ask me to do\n\nmurder, for money.\n\nBONASERA\n\nI ask you for justice.\n\nVITO CORLEONE\n\nThat is not justice; your daughter is still alive.\n\nBONASERA\n\nThen they can suffer then, as she suffers.\n\n(then)\n\nHow much shall I pay you?\n\nVITO CORLEONE (stands, turning his back toward Bonasera)\n\nBonasera... Bonasera... What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? Had\n\nyou come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering\n\nthis very day. And that by chance if an honest man such as yourself should make enemies,\n\nthen they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.\n\nBONASERA\n\nBe my friend --\n\n(then, after bowing and the Don shrugs)\n\n-- Godfather?\n\nVITO CORLEONE (after Bonasera kisses his hand)\n\nGood.\n\n(then)\n\nSome day, and that day may never come, I'll call upon you to do a service for me. But uh,\n\nuntil that day -- accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day.\n\nBONASERA (as he leaves the room)\n\nGrazie, Godfather.\n\nVITO CORLEONE\n\nPrego.\n\n(then, to Tom Hagen, after Bonasera leaves the room)\n\nAh, give this to ah, Clemenza. I want reliable people; people that aren't gonna be carried\n\naway. I'm mean, we're not murderers, despite of what this undertaker says.\n\nCUT TO: Connie's Wedding reception.

The Mazurka ends.\n\nSONNY\n\nEh -- what's this -- Get outta here; it's a private party, go on!\n\n(then, to FBI man in car)\n\nWhat's is it?

And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it.\n\nNow, Johnny is my father's godson. And my father went to see this band leader, and he\n\noffered him $10,000 to let Johnny go. But the band leader said no. So the next day, my father went to see him; only this time with Luca Brasi. And within an hour, he signed a release, for a certified check for $1,000.\n\nKAY\n\nHow'd he do that?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nMy father made him an offer he couldn't refuse.\n\nKAY\n\nWhat was that?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nLuca Brasi held a gun to his head, and my father assured him that either his brains -- or his signature -- would be on the contract.\n\n(then)\n\nThat's a true story.\n\n(then, after we see Johnny ending the song)\n\nThat's my family, Kay.

Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. That part is perfect for him;\n\nit'll make him a big star. And I'm gonna run him out of the business, and let me tell you why.\n\n(then, after he stands)\n\nJohnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges. For five years\n\nwe had her under training. Singing lessons; acting lessons, dancing lessons. I spent hundreds\n\nof thousands of dollars on her. I was gonna make her a big star! And let me be even more\n\nfrank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, and it's not all dollars and cents.\n\nShe was beautiful; she was young, she was innocent. She was the greatest piece of ass I ever\n\nhad, and I had'em all over the world! And then Johnny Fontane comes along with his olive-\n\noil voice, and guinea charm. And she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me look\n\nridiculous! And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous! Now you\n\nget the hell outta here! And if that gumbah tries any rough stuff, you tell him I ain't no band\n\nleader! Yeah, I heard that story....\n\nTOM\n\nThank you for the dinner and a very pleasant evening.

Now -- he needs cash, and he needs\n\nprotection from the police, for which he gives a piece of the action -- I couldn't find out how\n\nmuch. The Tattaglia family is behind him here in New York.

There's more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking\n\nat. Now if we don't get into it, somebody else will. Maybe one of the Five Families, maybe\n\nall of them. Now with the money they earn, they can buy more police and political power;\n\nthen they come after us. Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; an' they're the best\n\nthings to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. An' if we don't get a piece of that\n\naction, we risk everything we have -- I mean not now, but ah ten years from now.\n\nSONNY\n\nSo, what's your answer gonna be, Pop?\n\nCUT TO: Sollozzo meeting in Don Corleone's Genco office.

Why do I deserve this generosity?\n\nSOLLOZZO\n\nIf you consider a million dollars in cash just finance, te salute, Don Corleone.\n\nVITO CORLEONE (gets up to pour Sollozzo another drink)\n\nI said that I would see you because, I heard that you're a serious man, to be treated with\n\nrespect.\n\n(then, after sitting)\n\nBut uh, I must say \"no\" to you -- and I'll give you my reasons. It's true, I have a lot of friends\n\nin politics, but they wouldn't be friendly very long if they knew my business was drugs\n\ninstead of gambling, which they rule that as a -- harmless vice. But drugs is a dirty business.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n\nDon Corleone...\n\nVITO CORLEONE\n\nIt -- makes -- it doesn't make any difference to me what a man does for a living, understand.\n\nBut your business is ah -- a little dangerous.\n\nSOLLOZZO\n\nIf you're worried about security for your million, the Tattaglia's will guarantee it.\n\nSONNY\n\nAw, you're telling me that the Tattaglia's guarantee our investment?\n\nVITO CORLEONE (to Sonny)\n\nWait a minute...\n\n[Clemenza and Tom look at each other, realizing Sonny's faux pas.

You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some\n\ngarlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it; ya make sure it doesn't\n\nstick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs; heh?... And a\n\nlittle bit o' wine. An' a little bit o' sugar, and that's my trick.\n\nSONNY (after entering the kitchen)\n\nWhy don't you cut out the crap. I got more important things for you to do.\n\n(then)\n\nHow's Paulie?\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nOh, Paulie? Won't see him no more...\n\nSONNY (nods)\n\n(then to Michael, who's walking out of the kitchen)\n\nWhere you going?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nTo the city.\n\nSONNY\n\nNo... wanna send some bodyguards with him -- alright?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nNo, I'm just going to the hospital to see Pop\n\nSONNY\n\nNever mind; send somebody with him\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nAw, he'll be alright -- Sollozzo knows he's a civilian\n\nSONNY\n\nAlright; be careful, huh?\n\nMICHAEL (as he exits)\n\nYes, sir...\n\nSONNY\n\nSend somebody with him, anyway...\n\nCLEMENZA (chuckles)\n\nCUT TO: Michael goes to the city, driven by bodyguards -early evening\n\nDISSOLVE TO: Kay's hotel room.

Michael arrives by cab. He enters the quiet hospital to\n\nfind no one at the nurse's station. He walks down the hall to check an office, and only sees a\n\nhalf-finished sandwich on a desk. He runs down the hall and up the stairs towards his\n\nfather's room. He pauses, noticing there is no guard outside the Don's door. He walks around\n\nthe corner up to Room #2 and hesitates before he pushing the door open. His father is in the\n\nbed, and Michael wonders if he's alive. He walks up to the Don. -night\n\nNURSE (entering the room)\n\nWhat are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here now!\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI'm Michael Corleone -- this is my father.\n\n(then)\n\nThere's nobody here. What happened to the guards?\n\nNURSE\n\nYour father just had too many visitors. They interfered with hospital service. The police\n\nmade them leave about ten minutes ago.\n\n[As the nurse checks the Don's pulse, Michael picks up the phone]\n\nMICHAEL (into phone)\n\nAh, Get me, ah, Long Beach-4-5620, please...\n\n(then, to nurse, who was leaving the room)\n\nNurse, wait a minute. Stay here.\n\n(then, into phone)\n\nSonny -- Michael. I'm at the hospital.\n\nSONNY'S VOICE (over the phone)\n\nYeah?\n\nMICHAEL (into the phone)\n\nListen -- I got here late. There's nobody here.\n\nSONNY'S VOICE (over the phone)\n\nWhat? Nobody?\n\nMICHAEL (into the phone)\n\nNobody... no no no Tessio's men, no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.\n\nSONNY'S VOICE (over the phone)\n\nDon't panic -- I'll send somebody...\n\nMICHAEL (loudly)\n\nI won't panic!\n\n[hangs up the phone]\n\nNURSE\n\nI'm sorry; but you will have to leave.\n\nMICHAEL (as he checks to see if the bed would fit through the doorway)\n\nUhh... You and I are gonna moo -- move my father to another room. Now can you\n\ndisconnect those tubes so we can move the bed out?\n\nNURSE\n\nThat's out of the question!\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYou know my father? Men are coming here to kill him. You understand? Now help me,\n\nplease.\n\n[Michael and the nurse roll the Don's bed to another room. We hear a door close,\n\nthen footsteps are heard coming up the stairs as Michael peers from the doorway. A man\n\nholding flowers seems to be looking for a room]\n\nMICHAEL (coming out of hiding)\n\nWho are you?\n\nENZO\n\nI am Enzo, the baker -- Do you remember me?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nEnzo...\n\nENZO\n\nYes, Enzo...\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYou better get out of here, Enzo; there's gonna be trouble...\n\nENZO\n\nIf there is trouble, I stay here to help you. For your father -- for your father\n\nMICHAEL\n\nAlright... Listen, wait for me outside in front of the hospital. Alright? I'll be out in a minute.\n\nGo ahead...\n\nENZO\n\nOkay... okay.\n\n[Michael returns to the Don's room, at his bedside. The nurse is still in the room]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nJust lie here, Pop. I'll take care of you now. I'm with you now. I'm with you...\n\n[Michael kisses the Don's hand; the Don smiles, with a tear in his eye. Michael\n\nleaves to meet Enzo outside of the hospital]\n\nMICHAEL (grabbing and tossing the flowers that Enzo is still holding)\n\nGet rid of these\n\n(then, as Michael turns Enzo's collar up)\n\nCome 'ere... Put your hand in your pocket like you have a gun. You'll be alright.\n\n(then, after he sighs)\n\nYou'll be okay...\n\n[A black sedan pulls up to the front of the hospital. The occupants look at Michael\n\nand Enzo, as Michael undoes a button of his coat and puts his hand in, as if he had a gun.\n\nThe car then drives off]\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYou did good.\n\n[Enzo, very scared, takes out a cigarette and has trouble lighting it with his Zippo\n\nlighter. His hands are shaking. Michael takes the lighter and lights his cigarette, noticing\n\nthat his hands are not shaking. Sirens are heard as police cars screech to a halt in front of the\n\nhospital. Michael shoos Enzo away as he is grabbed by an officer]\n\nOFFICER (grabbing Michael)\n\nNow hold still...\n\nCAPTAIN McCLUSKEY (entering the scene)\n\nI thought I got all you guinea hoods locked up! What the hell are you doing here?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWhat happened to the men who were guarding my father, captain?\n\nMcCLUSKEY\n\nWhy you little punk! What the hell are you doing telling me my business? I pulled them\n\nguys off of here, eh! -- now you get outta here -- and stay away from this hospital!\n\nMICHAEL\n\nI'm not moving until you put some guards around my father's room\n\nMcCLUSKEY\n\nPhil, take him in!\n\nOFFICER PHIL\n\nThe kid's clean, Captain. He's a war hero. He's never been busted for the rackets...\n\nMcCLUSKEY (overlaps)\n\nGoddamn it, I said take him in!\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWhat's the Turk paying you to set up my father, Captain?\n\nMcCLUSKEY\n\nTake a hold of him. Stand him up. Stand'im up straight.\n\n[McCluskey punches Michael in the jaw as a Corleone car screeches up. Men get\n\nout and run up the steps toward the Don's room. Tom and a couple of men go to get\n\nMichael]\n\nTOM (to McCluskey)\n\nI'm attorney for the Corleone family. These men are private detectives hired to protect Vito\n\nCorleone. They're licensed to carry firearms. If you interfere, you'll have to appear before a\n\njudge in the morning and show cause.\n\nMcCLUSKEY (to his officers)\n\nAlright... let'im go. [inaudible \"Shit!\" as he turns away] Come on!\n\nDISSOLVE TO: Corleone mall, during the day. Tom, Clemenza and Michael get out of the\n\ncar and walk through the gate, noticing armed men all over the mall. Tessio greets them.\n\n-day\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nWhat's with all the new faces?\n\nTESSIO\n\nWe'll need'em now. After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad. We hit Bruno Tattaglia 4\n\no'clock this morning.\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nJesus Christ...\n\n(then, motions to Michael to come on)\n\nIt looks like a fortress around here...\n\nCUT TO: Inside the Corleone office -day\n\nSONNY (to Tom)\n\nTom-anuch! Hey, a hundred button men on the street twenty-four hours a day; that Turk\n\nshows one hair on his ass, he's dead --\n\nTOM (going to sit down)\n\nYeah?\n\nSONNY\n\n-- believe me...\n\n(then, to Michael, whose face is bruised from McCluskey's punch)\n\nHey, Michael, come're, let me look at you. You look beautiful! Beautiful! Just gorgeous!\n\n(then, to Tom)\n\nHey, listen to this -- the Turk wants to talk. Eh gosh -- imagine the nerve of the sonofabitch,\n\neh? Craps out last night, and wants a meetin' today...\n\nTOM\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nSONNY\n\nWhat did he say -- Badda-beep, badda-bap, badda-boop, badda-beep -- He wants us to send\n\nMichael here to proposition. And the promise is, that the deal is so good, that we can't\n\nrefuse. Eh...\n\nTOM (as Tessio enters the room)\n\nWhat about Bruno Tattaglia?\n\nSONNY\n\nThat's part of the deal -- Bruno cancels out what they did to my father...\n\nTOM\n\nSonny, we ought to hear what they have to say...\n\nSONNY (standing in front of Tom, who's seated)\n\nNo; no; no! No more! Not this time, consiglieri. No more meetin's, no more discussions, no\n\nmore Sollozzo tricks. You give'em one message: I want Sollozzo -- if not, it's all-out war --\n\nwe go to the mattresses...\n\nTOM (stands)\n\nSome of the other families won't sit still for all-out war!\n\nSONNY\n\nThen they hand me Sollozzo!\n\nTOM\n\nYour father wouldn't want to hear this! This is business, not personal, Sonny!\n\nSONNY\n\nThey shot my father -- that's business? Your ass...\n\nTOM\n\nEven the shooting of your father was business, not personal, Sonny!\n\nSONNY (now seated behind the desk)\n\nWell, then, business will have to suffer, alright? And listen -- do me a favor, Tom -- No\n\nmore advice on how to patch things up. Just help me win, please, alright?\n\nTOM (after they settle down)\n\nI found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw...\n\nSONNY\n\nWhat about 'im?\n\nTOM\n\nNow he's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey has agreed to be\n\nthe Turk's bodyguard. What you have to understand, Sonny, is that while Sollozzo is being\n\nguarded like this, he is invulnerable. Now nobody has ever gunned down a New York police\n\ncaptain -- never. It would be disastrous. All the Five Families would come after you, Sonny.\n\nThe Corleone Family would be outcasts! Even the old man's political protection would run\n\nfor cover! So do me a favor -- take this into consideration.\n\nSONNY\n\nAlright. We'll wait.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWe can't wait.\n\nSONNY\n\nHuh?\n\nMICHAEL (who's seated with his arms on the chair's arms)\n\nWe can't wait. I don't care what Sollozzo says about a deal, he's gonna kill Pop, that's it.\n\nThat's the key for him. Gotta get Sollozzo.\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nMike is right...\n\nSONNY\n\nLemme ask you something, Professor, I mean -- what about McCluskey? Huh? What do we\n\ndo with this -- cop here?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nThey wanna have a meeting with me, right? It will be me -- McCluskey -- and Sollozzo.\n\nLet's set the meeting. Get our informers to find out where it's gonna be held. Now, we insist\n\nit's a public place -- a bar, a restaurant -- some place where there's people so I feel safe.\n\nThey're gonna search me when I first meet them, right, so I can't have a weapon on me then.\n\nBut if Clemenza can figure a way -- to have a weapon planted there for me -- then I'll kill\n\n'em both.\n\n[Clemenza, Tessio and Sonny laugh. Tom shrugs]\n\nSONNY\n\nHey, whataya gonna do, nice college boy, eh? Didn't want to get mixed up in the Family\n\nbusiness, huh? Now you wanna gun down a police captain, why, because he slapped ya in\n\nthe face a little bit? Hah? What do you think this is the Army, where you shoot'em a mile\n\naway? You've gotta get up close like this and bada-bing! you blow their brains all over your\n\nnice Ivy League suit. Come're...\n\nMICHAEL (as Sonny kisses his head)\n\nSonny...\n\nSONNY\n\nYou're taking this very personal. Tom, this is business and this man is taking it very very\n\npersonal.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWhere does it say that you can't kill a cop?\n\nHAGEN\n\nCome on, Mikey...\n\nMICHAEL\n\nTom, wait a minute. I'm talking about a cop -- that's mixed up in drugs. I'm talking about ah\n\n- ah - a dishonest cop -- a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was\n\ncoming to him. That's a terrific story. And we have newspaper people on the payroll, don't\n\nwe, Tom?\n\n[Hagen nods in the affirmative]\n\nAnd they might like a story like that.\n\nHAGEN\n\nThey might, they just might...\n\nMICHAEL (to Sonny)\n\nIt's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.\n\nCUT TO: Clemenza's Cellar. Clemenza is showing Michael the gun he's to use -day\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nIt's as cold as they come -- impossible to trace, so you don't worry about prints, Mike. I put a\n\nspecial tape on the trigger, and the butt. Here, try it...\n\n(then, after Michael tries it but doesn't shoot it)\n\nWhat's the matter, the trigger too tight?\n\nMICHAEL (after shooting the gun)\n\nMaron, my ears...\n\nCLEMENZA (laughs)\n\nYeah, I left it noisy -- that way it scares any pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders away.\n\n(then)\n\nAll right, you shot'em both -- now what do you do?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nSit down, finish my dinner...\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nCome on, kid, don't fool around. Just let your hand drop to your side, and let the gun slip\n\nout. Everybody'll still think you got it. They're gonna be staring at your face, Mike -- so walk\n\noutta the place real fast -- but you don't run. Don't look nobody directly in the eye -- but you\n\ndon't look away, either. Hey, they're gonna be scared stiff of you, believe me, so don't worry\n\nabout nothin'. You know, you're going to turn out all right. You take a long vacation --\n\nnobody knows where -- and we're gonna catch the hell.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nHow bad do you think it's gonna be?\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nPretty goddamn bad. Probably all the other Families will line up against us. That's alright --\n\nthis thing's gotta happen every five years or so -- ten years -- helps to get rid of the bad\n\nblood. Been ten years since the last one. You know you got to stop them at the beginning,\n\nlike they should have stopped Hitler at Munich, They should never've let him get away with\n\nthat. They were just asking for big trouble. You know, Mike, we was all proud of you --\n\nbeing a hero and all. Your father, too.\n\n[Clemenza hands Michael the gun after adjusting it. Michael points and fires the\n\nunloaded gun]\n\nCUT TO: The Corleone Dining Room (6:30pm). Sonny, Clemenza, Tessio and Rocco are\n\nsitting around, eating Chinese food while waiting for news about where the Sollozzo\n\nmeeting will take place. Michael smokes as the others eat. -early evening\n\nTOM (as he enters)\n\nNothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing -- even Sollozzo's people don't know where the\n\nmeeting's going to be held.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nHow much time do we have?\n\nSONNY (checking his watch)\n\nThey're gonna pick you up in front of Jack Dempsey's joint in an hour and a half. Exactly an\n\nhour and a half.\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nWe could put a tail on them and see how it turns out...\n\nSONNY\n\nSollozzo'd lose our ass going around the block!\n\nTOM\n\nWhat about the negotiator?\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nHe's over at my place playin' pinochle with a couple of my men. He's happy, they're lettin'\n\nhim win...\n\nTOM\n\nThere's too much of a risk for Mike -- maybe we outta call it off, Sonny.\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nThe negotiator keeps on playing cards until Mike comes back safe and sound.\n\nSONNY\n\nSo why don't he just blast whoever's in the goddamn car?\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nToo dangerous -- they'd be lookin' for that.\n\nTOM\n\nSollozzo might not even be in the car, Sonny!\n\n[the phone rings, Sonny gets up to get it]\n\nSONNY\n\nI'll get it.\n\n(then, into the phone)\n\nYeah -- Yeah -- Well, thanks...\n\n(then, after hanging up the phone and returning to the table)\n\nLouis' Restaurant in the Bronx.\n\nTOM\n\nWell is it reliable?\n\nSONNY\n\nThat's my man in McCluskey's precinct. A police captain's gotta be on call twenty-four hours\n\na day. He signed out at that number between eight and ten. Anybody know this joint?\n\nTESSIO\n\nYeah, sure, I do. It's perfect for us. A small family place, good food. Everyone minds his\n\nbusiness. It's perfect. Pete: they got an old-fashion' toilet -- you know, the box, and - and -\n\nand - ah the chain-thing. We might be able to tape the gun behind it.\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nAll right. Mike: you go to the restaurant, you eat, you talk for a while, you relax. You make\n\nthem relax. Then you get up and you go take a leak. No -- better still -- you ask for\n\npermission to go. Then when you come back, you come out blastin', and don't take any\n\nchances -- two shots in the head apiece.\n\nSONNY\n\nHey, listen, I want somebody good -- and I mean very good -- to plant that gun. I don't want\n\nmy brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hands, alright?\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nThe gun'll be there...\n\nSONNY\n\nAll right\n\n(then, to Tessio)\n\nListen, you drive him and you pick him up after the job, okay?\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nCome on, let's move...\n\n[as they're leaving]\n\nMICHAEL'S VOICE (OS)\n\nThank you, Tom...\n\nSONNY (to Michael)\n\nDid he - ah - tell you to drop the gun right away?\n\nMICHAEL\n\nYeah, a million times.\n\nCLEMENZA\n\nYou don't forget: two shots apiece in the head soon as you come out the door, ah? Let's go...\n\nMICHAEL (to Sonny)\n\nHow long do you think it'll be before I can come back?\n\nSONNY\n\nAt least a year, Mike. Listen - um - I'll square it with Mom, uh - you know, your not seeing\n\nher before you leave; and uh, I'll get a message to that girlfriend, when I think the time is\n\nright.\n\n(then, after he and Michael embrace)\n\nTake care, huh?\n\nTOM\n\nTake care, Mike...\n\nMICHAEL (embracing Tom)\n\nTom.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: Jack Dempsey's Restaurant (8:00pm). Michael's waiting on the sidewalk\n\nuntil Sollozzo's car pulls up and he gets in. -evening\n\nSOLLOZZO\n\nI'm glad you came, Mike. I hope we can straighten everything out. I mean, this is terrible --\n\nit's not the way I wanted things to go at all. It should've never happened.\n\nMICHAEL\n\nWe'll straighten everything out tonight. I don't want my father bothered any more...\n\nSOLLOZZO\n\nHe won't be, Mike; I swear on my children he won't be. But you gotta keep an open mind\n\nwhen we talk. I mean, I hope you're not a hothead like your brother Sonny. You -- can't talk\n\nbusiness with him... [something in Italian]\n\nMcCLUSKEY\n\nAhh, he's a good kid.\n\n(then, as he leans forward, offering his handshake)\n\nI'm sorry about the other night, Mike. I gotta frisk you, so turn around uh -- on your knees,\n\nfacing me.\n\n(then, as McCluskey frisks Michael)\n\nAh, I guess I'm gettin' too old for my job. Too grouchy -- can't stand the aggravation. You\n\nknow how it is...\n\n(then, to Sollozzo)\n\nHe's clean.\n\n[A little while later, as the car begins to cross the Triborough bridge.
