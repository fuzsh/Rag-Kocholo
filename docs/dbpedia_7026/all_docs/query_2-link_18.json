Whether it was James Caan being machine-gunned to death at the toll booth, to Moe Greene being shot in the eye in The Godfather.”\n\n—Writer/director Quentin Tarantino\n\nCinema Speculation\n\n(If Tarantino saw The Godfather on its opening weekend in 1972, he would have been eight years old.)\n\n”I think [The Godfather] is a romantic treatment of that subject matter, but I think what Coppola did was brilliant.”\n\n—Actor Robert Duvall\n\n1991 interview with Bob Costas\n\nConfession: It’s taken me a few decades to appreciate The Godfather.\n\nBut I have an excuse. I’m sure it’s an excuse many have after watching classic movies such as Casablanca, It’s a Wonderful Life, Taxi Driver, Rain Man, Pulp Fiction, Lost in Translation, etc. There’s a lot of pressure to love a movie that’s been on every MUST-WATCH MOVIE LIST.\n\nI was just a kid when The Godfather hit theaters in 1972. It was rated R, and back then (at least in my world) parents and movie theaters took seriously restricting kids under 17 from seeing R-rated movies. This was also a pre-cable and pre-internet era meaning that it would take years for an edited version to make it to television. (One sanitized TV version I read omitted the horse’s head, the strangulation at the bar, and the shootout at the toll booth. Can you even call it The Godfather without those three scenes?)\n\nAnd while early ’70s American cinema reflected the somber mood of the country with movies like The Exorcist, The Last Picture Show, and Chinatown, I was watching Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Herbie Rides Again, and What’s Up Doc? It wasn’t long before I watched edgier movies like Westworld, American Graffiti, and a re-release of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in theaters, but those were still PG rated.\n\nThe Godfather was just a distant R-rated echo. At school, I heard second-hand stories (from the Tarantino-like kids) about the horse’s head, an offer that couldn’t be refused, and sleeping with the fishes. I’m sure I saw many spoofs of The Godfather by the time I saw a sanitized version of it on TV years later.\n\nThe only thing I remember from finally watching The Godfather for the first time was thinking, “When is this wedding going to end and the story start?” Cut me a break; I was an early teenager watching a 4X3 version on a 19″ TV in an un-air-conditioned house in Florida. Compared to contemporary movies at the time (Jaws, Rocky, and Smokey and the Bandit) The Godfather on TV was boring. A 20-minute wedding?—Fuhgeddaboudit. (I don’t even think I finished The Godfather the first time I tried watching it on TV.)\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola’s Apocalypse Now—now there was a movie I could get excited about. Saw in the theaters and was hooked before the first frame with the sound design. I’d never experienced a movie like Apocalypse Now. It’s still my favorite Coppola film. The Outsiders, Rumble Fish, and Tucker: The Man and His Dreams were solid home runs. Personally, The Godfather has been an acquired taste.\n\nSomewhere along the way (after graduating from film school), I watched The Godfather on VHS, caught parts of it on cable, and watched the DVD that I own. Until last week, I’d only see The Godfather, Part II once before. (Great— another long wedding at the start.) Never saw The Godfather, Part III. But in watching all three Godfather films earlier this month, I did see the re-edited version of Part III—what Coppola calls The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone.\n\n”Art is an ever blossoming flower we’re all part of. It’s a beautiful thing, really.’\n\n—Francis Ford Coppola\n\nCBS NEWS interview on the 50th anniversary of The Godfather\n\nWatching The Godfather trilogy this time has caused me to asked when did the Mafia start in America? Why did it get a stronghold? What’s the history of the island of Sicily in Italy? Did you know that Sicily is much closer to Tunisia in North Africa than it is to Rome? That there are more Sicilians in the United States than there are in Sicily? Sicilians have had their share of power struggles. All part of the blossoming flower that adds new layers and depth to Puzo and Coppola’s masterpiece.\n\nPart of the problem of coming to the Godfather in the 2020s is there have been some great mobster movies in the last 40 years: Scarface (1983), The Untouchables (1987), Goodfellas (1990) , Casino (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997). And I’ll pick On the Waterfront (1954) against any of The Godfather movies every time. It’s one of my all-time favorites. Director Frank Darabont once said movies needed to end with at least a slight uptick at the end. I don’t need a happy ending, but a ray of light is nice. It may be buried in the Coda confession—I’ll have to watch that again. (Interestingly, at this moment, Darabont’s The Shawshank Redemption just edges The Godfather on the IMDB Top 250 movies. No Zihuatanejo—no paradise for Morgan Freeman—no topping The Godfather.)\n\nThe Godfather isn’t a perfect film. But it is the perfect film to study. It holds cultural cachet, and there is no shortage of reflections and insights on the movie. (Including the release this year of The Offer.) And because Francis Ford Coppola is the modern filmmaker’s patron saint—its Godfather. Even over 50 years after its theatrical release, it is still being talked about in a way that few films are talked about.\n\nI’m trying to understand why. Is it the craft— well written, well acted, well shot, well designed, well edited? Is it because it has so much quotable dialogue and so many memorable scenes? Is it the family aspect? The music? Is it because even though the Corleone’s are in an evil business, they seem less evil than the other bad guys? (If Vito were alive today, he’d look at opioid and fentanyl use and say in his raspy voice, “I told you drugs were a dirty business.”) Is it because we can empathize Vito and Michael’s situation? Certainly those cool black cars with thick whitewall tires from the ’40s and ’50s didn’t hurt.\n\nThe Godfather has style. Maybe too much style. A quote that’s stuck with me for years (and I can’t remember who said it) is “Movie’s reflect the culture they help produce.” The Rico Act in 1985 changed traditional organized crime. But today there is no shortage of people running around acting like gangsters. Call it unorganized crime. It’s the guy in Texas who earlier this year killed five neighbors after a noise complaint.\n\nAt one point or another, a negative view of all Italians being mobsters is why Mario Puzo was reluctant to write a book on the Mafia (that his agent thought he should write), part of why Coppola first turned down directing The Godfather, and why even mobster Joe Columbo originally tried to stop The Godfather from getting made.\n\nBut The Godfather got made, became an instant hit in 1972 , and being Italian may have been the coolest thing to be in the United States back in the ’70s. In modern cinema, what started with Pacino, De Niro, Coppola, continued with Stallone, Pesci, Travolta, Scorsese, right up to today with DiCaprio and Tarantino. A stable of thoroughbreds like Khartoum.\n\nMaybe its popularity boils down to what Coppola wrote in his production notebook in pre-production to keep him focused:\n\n“POWER, POWER, POWER, POWER—never forget that it is a fascination of the limits and manipulations of Power that keep people interested in this book.”\n\n—Francis Ford Coppola\n\nThe Godfather Notebook\n\nThe concept of power is a universal and timeless theme. There isn’t a civilization in the history of the world that hasn’t had to deal with power and the abuse of power. The struggle for power = Conflict. And The Godfather is packed with conflict.\n\nIt’s packed with fascinating characters in a fascinating world. A world audiences have been watching since at least Little Caesar (1931) when Edward G. Robinson climbed the mobster ranks dressing sharply and speaking with flair.\n\n”Listen handsome, open up or you’re telling nobody nothing no more.”\n\n”You’re through. If you ain’t out of town by tomorrow morning, you won’t never leave it except in a pine box.”\n\nFrom a screenwriting and filmmaking perspective, two of the best take aways from The Godfather are 1) Working within genre gives you a track to run on—and which you can elevate—and 2) The more specific you are in your writing the more universal its appeal. That’s why there are Godfather posters hanging today in unlikely places.\n\nP.S. Coppola said all of Puzo’s gangster knowledge came from research and he went out of his way to never met anyone in the Mafia, and he encouraged Coppola to avoid meeting them as well. Coppola said he avoided meeting John Gotti when that one time head of the Gambino family knocked on his trailer when he was on location, and said he never knowingly met anyone in the Mafia. If that’s true, then I did something that neither Coppola or Puzo did when I interviewed a former mobster with the Columbo crime family for a TV program I produced about 20 years ago. More on that—and who he thinks Brando partly patterned Vito Corleone after— in my next post."
