        "text": "Decided to start watching all of the Oscar best picture winners, in order. I hadn’t heard of some of these movies, some I love and have seen multiple times already and I actively hate others, planning to never watch them again. Fair warning, there will be spoilers in these and other reviews to help explain my point of view.\n\nOne of only two sequels to win Best Picture, The Godfather Part II is not only considered a masterpiece by many, but also superior to its predecessor. Having seen both movies several times, I have often considered the first one to be better, but during the rewatch for this series, I think I may have finally come to agree that Part II is indeed better.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Vito’s rise to Don and Michael’s behavior as he has settled into the role of Don as he moves through his middle years, is captivating. We see that even though Michael is truly scary and someone you should never cross, he doesn't have the respect that his father did; Michael is betrayed time and again by those closest to him, even when there is no real reason for the betrayal. All of those in business with him betray him in some terrible way or another, the worst of them being his brother Fredo. Kay actually hurts him in the worst way by aborting their child. She was so stupid to throw it in his face the way she did and did she really think Michael was going to let her take their kids with her when she left?\n\nVito was a man who above all else, loved his family and wanted what was best for them; his is the ultimate immigrant story, criminal activity notwithstanding. Vito didn’t let his power get the better of him, but Michael did. Even though he loved his children and his son is shown to adore him in return, we know from the third film that they don’t remain close. He does have a closeness with his daughter, but it isn’t the same type of relationship as Vito had with his kids. Imagine all of Vito’s scenes from the first film as Michael’s life; his kids wouldn’t have been around him and in his life in the same way and he didn’t have a loyal and loving wife. Honestly, the choice of wife was one of Michael’s earliest mistakes. Had he chosen better, many things about his life would have been different and better. In the end, the only one he had at his side was Connie, which I wouldn’t have guessed would be the case. She becomes his confident and one true ally. As this movie ends though, we don’t know that, but we do see Michael thinking back on the happy occasion of one of Vito’s birthdays, when the whole family, was gathered to celebrate the Don. Even then, Michael’s separateness was on display, giving a glimpse into the loneliness he would have for the remainder of his life. I think this, Michael’s inability to have a full life, is the real tragedy of the story. His future was the one that held the most promise, yet his decision to become the head of the family, rather than walking away when he could, led to him sitting alone in a garden, surrounded by no one.\n\nCompelling, layered and rich, this is truly one of the best moves ever made. No matter how many times I watch it, I discover something new every time. In a ridiculously stacked year, this film definitely deserved it’s win, as did Coppola, who saw this, as well as his The Conversation nominated for the top Oscar prize. I have to give this the same rating as part I, 4.5 out of 5 stars."
