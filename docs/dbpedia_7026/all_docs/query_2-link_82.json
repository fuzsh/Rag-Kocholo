        "text": "Ask almost any cinephile what their favorite movie is and at least one of The Godfather movies usually pop up in the top 10. It's a rare franchise where the sequel is not only brilliant, it's almost superior to the incredible predecessor. The third one is another story altogether and certainly has its merits, but was doomed from the start. Any way you look at it, The Godfather trilogy represents cinematic genius, and they're a must-have in any movie-buff's collection.\n\nThe Godfather is such an iconic piece of American cinema that its influence is still felt in everyday culture 40+ years later. The term \"Godfather\" wasn't even an expression until these films debuted, and how many times have we all heard that reference? The idea of a \"Don\" also wasn't a thing until the book that inspired these films came along. The Godfather films are near-perfect, in addition to being extremely influential.\n\nIt's hard to find a better performance than Marlon Brando as Don Vito in the first Godfather until you watch De Niro playing the very same character in its sequel. How often does that happen? Not to mention the tour de force that is Al Pacino in all three films, as well as the supporting cast that includes heavy weights like James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Andy Garcia, and countless others.\n\nThe Godfather trilogy is a timeless piece of American cinema and well worth a revisit, so we decided to dig up some fun facts about The Godfather franchise that you may not know. We figure that's an offer you can't refuse."
