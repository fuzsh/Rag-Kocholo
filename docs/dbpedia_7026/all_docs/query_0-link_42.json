        "text": "The Godfather is a 1972 American epic crime film[2] directed by Francis Ford Coppola, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mario Puzo, based on Puzo's best-selling 1969 novel of the same title. The ensemble cast includes Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. It is the first installment in The Godfather trilogy, chronicling the Corleone family under patriarch Vito Corleone (Brando) from 1945 to 1955. It focuses on the transformation of his youngest son, Michael Corleone (Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthless mafia boss.\n\nParamount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel for $80,000, before it gained popularity.[3][4] Studio executives had trouble finding a director; the first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film but disagreement followed over casting several characters, in particular, Vito (Marlon Brando) and Michael (Al Pacino). Filming took place primarily on location around New York City and in Sicily, and was completed ahead of schedule. The musical score was composed principally by Nino Rota, with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.\n\nThe Godfather premiered at the Loew's State Theatre on March 14, 1972, and was widely released in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was the highest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made, earning between $250 and $291 million at the box office. The film was acclaimed by critics and audiences, who praised its performances—particularly those of Brando and Pacino—direction, screenplay, writing, story, cinematography, editing, score, and portrayal of the mafia. The Godfather launched the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino, and other relative newcomers in the cast and crew. At the 45th Academy Awards, the film won Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan, and Duvall all for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola for Best Director.\n\nThe Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made, as well as a landmark of the gangster genre.[5] It was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in 1990, being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and The Godfather Part III (1990). Pauline Kael wrote that \"If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, The Godfather is it.\"[6]\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn 1945, the New York City Corleone family don, Vito Corleone, listens to requests during his daughter Connie's wedding to Carlo. Vito's youngest son Michael, a Marine who has thus far stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito sends his consigliere, Tom Hagen, to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part. Woltz refuses Hagen's request at first, but soon complies after finding the severed head of his prized stud horse in his bed.\n\nAs Christmas approaches, drug baron Virgil \"The Turk\" Sollozzo asks Vito to invest in his narcotics business and for police protection. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito sends his enforcer Luca Brasi to the Tattaglias on an espionage mission. Brasi is garroted to death during the initial meeting. Later, enforcers gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito's first-born Sonny now in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected after NYPD officers on Sollozzo's payroll cleared out Vito's guards. Michael thwarts the attempt on his father's life but is beaten by corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey. After the attempted hit at the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. Michael feigns interest and agrees to meet, but hatches a plan with Sonny and Corleone capo Clemenza to kill them and go into hiding. Michael meets Sollozzo and McCluskey at a Bronx restaurant; after retrieving a handgun planted in the bathroom by Clemenza, he shoots both men dead.\n\nDespite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, the Five Families erupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge in Sicily and Fredo, Vito's second son, is sheltered by Moe Greene in Las Vegas. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman, Apollonia, but she is killed shortly thereafter by a car bomb intended for him.\n\nDevastated by Sonny's death and tired of war, Vito sets a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. Kay gives birth to two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito reveals to Michael that it was Don Barzini who ordered the hit on Sonny and warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleone capo. With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a \"wartime consigliere\". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos and is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\n\nIn 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael's son Anthony. At Vito's funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the Five Families, plus Greene, and Tessio is executed for his treachery. Michael extracts Carlo's confession to playing a part in Sonny's murder. He assures Carlo that he is being exiled, not murdered, before Clemenza strangles Carlo. Connie confronts Michael about his involvement in Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if she is telling the truth and is relieved when he denies carrying out the death. As she leaves, capos enter the office and pay reverence to Michael as \"Don Corleone\".\n\nCast[]\n\nProduction[]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nThe film is based on Mario Puzo's The Godfather, which remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 67 weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years.StubStub[9] Published in 1969, it became the best selling published work in history for several years.Stub Burt Lancaster and Danny Thomas both expressed interest adapting the book.[10] Paramount Pictures originally found out about Puzo's novel in 1967 when a literary scout for the company contacted then Paramount Vice President of Production Peter Bart about Puzo's unfinished sixty-page manuscript titled Mafia.Stub Bart believed the work was \"much beyond a Mafia story\" and offered Puzo a $12,500 option for the work, with an option for $80,000 if the finished work were to be made into a film.StubStub Despite Puzo's agent telling him to turn down the offer, Puzo was desperate for money and accepted the deal.StubStub Paramount's Robert Evans relates that, when they met in early 1968, he offered Puzo the deal after the author confided in him that he urgently needed $10,000 to pay off gambling debts.Stub\n\nIn March 1967, Paramount announced that they backed Puzo's upcoming work in the hopes of making a film.Stub In 1969, Paramount confirmed their intentions to make a film out of the novel for the price of $80,000,[N 3]StubStub[11][12] with aims to have the film released on Christmas Day in 1971.[13] On March 23, 1970, Albert S. Ruddy was officially announced as the film's producer, in part because studio executives were impressed with his interview and because he was known for bringing his films in under budget.StubStubStub\n\nDirection[]\n\nEvans wanted the picture to be directed by an Italian American to make the film \"ethnic to the core\".[14]Stub Paramount's latest mafia movie, The Brotherhood, had done very poorly at the box office;[9]Stub Evans believed that the reason for its failure was its almost complete lack of cast members or creative personnel of Italian descent (the director Martin Ritt and star Kirk Douglas were not Italian).Stub Sergio Leone was Paramount's first choice to direct the film.[15][16] Leone turned down the option, in order to work on his own gangster film Once Upon a Time in America.[15][16] Peter Bogdanovich was then approached but he also declined the offer because he was not interested in the mafia.[17][18][19] In addition, Peter Yates, Richard Brooks, Arthur Penn, Franklin J. Schaffner, Costa-Gavras, and Otto Preminger were all offered the position and declined.[20][21][22] Evans' chief assistant Peter Bart suggested Francis Ford Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor reception of his latest film The Rain People.Stub[14] Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as \"pretty cheap stuff\".StubStub At the time Coppola's studio, American Zoetrope,[23] owed over $400,000 to Warner Bros. for budget overruns with the film THX 1138 and when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job.[21][24][25] Coppola was officially announced as director of the film on September 28, 1970.Stub Coppola agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent of the gross rentals.StubStub Coppola later found a deeper theme for the material and decided that the film should not be about organized crime but a family chronicle, a metaphor for capitalism in America.[14]\n\nCoppola and Paramount[]\n\nBefore The Godfather was in production, Paramount had been going through an unsuccessful period.[9] In addition to the failure of The Brotherhood, other recent films that were produced or co-produced by Paramount had greatly exceeded their budgets: Darling Lili,Stub Paint Your Wagon, and Waterloo.[9]Stub The budget for the film was originally $2.5 million but as the book grew in popularity Coppola argued for and ultimately received a larger budget.[N 1][20][26][27] Paramount executives wanted the movie to be set in contemporary Kansas City and shot in the studio backlot in order to cut down on costs.[20]Stub[26] Coppola objected and wanted to set the movie in the same time period as the novel, the 1940s and 1950s;Stub[20][25]Stub Coppola's reasons included Michael Corleone's spell in the wartime Marine Corps, the emergence of corporate America, and America in the years after World War II.Stub The novel was becoming increasingly successful and so Coppola's wishes were eventually granted.Stub[26] The studio heads subsequently let Coppola film on location in New York City and Sicily.Stub\n\nGulf+Western executive Charles Bluhdorn was frustrated with Coppola over the number of screen tests he had performed without finding a person to play the various roles.Stub Production quickly fell behind because of Coppola's indecisiveness and conflicts with Paramount, which led to costs being around $40,000 per day.Stub With costs rising, Paramount had the Vice President, Jack Ballard, keep a close eye on production expenses.Stub While filming, Coppola stated that he felt he could be fired at any point as he knew Paramount executives were not happy with many of the decisions he had made.[20] Coppola was aware that Evans had asked Elia Kazan to take over directing the film because he feared that Coppola was too inexperienced to cope with the increased size of the production.Stub Coppola was also convinced that the film editor, Aram Avakian, and the assistant director, Steve Kestner, were conspiring to get him fired. Avakian complained to Evans that he could not edit the scenes correctly because Coppola was not shooting enough footage. Evans was satisfied with the footage being sent to the West Coast and authorized Coppola to fire them both. Coppola later explained, \"Like the godfather, I fired people as a preemptory strike. The people who were angling the most to have me fired, I had fired.\"Stub Brando threatened to quit if Coppola was fired.[20]Stub\n\nParamount wanted The Godfather to appeal to a wide audience and threatened Coppola with a \"violence coach\" to make the film more exciting. Coppola added a few more violent scenes to keep the studio happy. The scene in which Connie smashes crockery after finding out Carlo has been cheating was added for this reason.[25]\n\nWriting[]\n\nOn April 14, 1970, it was revealed that Puzo was hired by Paramount for $100,000, along with a percentage of the film's profits, to work on the screenplay for the film.StubStubStub Working from the book, Coppola wanted to have the themes of culture, character, power, and family at the forefront of the film, whereas Puzo wanted to retain aspects from his novelStub and his initial draft of 150 pages was finished on August 10, 1970.StubStub After Coppola was hired as director, both Puzo and Coppola worked on the screenplay, but separately.Stub Puzo worked on his draft in Los Angeles, while Coppola wrote his version in San Francisco.Stub Coppola created a book where he tore pages out of Puzo's book and pasted them into his book.StubStub There, he made notes about each of the book's fifty scenes, which related to major themes prevalent in the scene, whether the scene should be included in the film, along with ideas and concepts that could be used when filming to make the film true to Italian culture.StubStub The two remained in contact while they wrote their respective screenplays and made decisions on what to include and what to remove for the final version.Stub A second draft was completed on March 1, 1971, and was 173 pages long.StubStub The final screenplay was finished on March 29, 1971,Stub and wound up being 163 pages long,StubStub 40 pages over what Paramount had asked for.[31] When filming, Coppola referred to the notebook he had created over the final draft of the screenplay.StubStub Screenwriter Robert Towne did uncredited work on the script, particularly on the Pacino-Brando garden scene.Stub Despite finishing the third draft, some scenes in the film were still not written yet and were written during production.Stub\n\nThe Italian-American Civil Rights League, led by mobster Joseph Colombo, maintained that the film emphasized stereotypes about Italian-Americans, and wanted all uses of the words \"mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" to be removed from the script.[32][13][33][34][35] The league also requested that all the money earned from the premiere be donated to the league's fund to build a new hospital.[34][35] Coppola claimed that Puzo's screenplay only contained two instances of the word \"mafia\" being used, while \"Cosa Nostra\" was not used at all.[34][35] They were removed and replaced with other terms, without compromising the story.[34][35] The league eventually gave its support for the script.[34][35] Earlier, the windows of producer Albert S. Ruddy's car had been shot out with a note left on the dashboard which essentially said, \"shut down the movie—or else.\"[14]\n\nCasting[]\n\nPuzo was first to show interest in having Marlon Brando portray Don Vito Corleone by sending a letter to Brando in which he stated Brando was the \"only actor who can play the Godfather\".Stub Despite Puzo's wishes, the executives at Paramount were against having Brando,[23] partly because of the poor performance of his recent films and also his short temper.[26]Stub Brando was hesitant about getting back into acting, but his secretary Alice Marchak persuaded him to audition.[36] Coppola favored Brando or Laurence Olivier for the role,Stub[37] but Olivier's agent refused the role claiming Olivier was sick;Stub however, Olivier went on to star in Sleuth later that year.[37] Evans pushed for Carlo Ponti or Ernest Borgnine to receive the part.Stub[38] Bluhdorn proposed Charles Bronson for the role.[38] Others considered were George C. Scott, Richard Conte, Anthony Quinn and Orson Welles.Stub[39][40] Welles was Paramount's preferred choice for the role.[41]\n\nAfter months of debate between Coppola and Paramount over Brando, the two finalists for the role were Borgnine and Brando;Stub Paramount president Stanley Jaffe required Brando to perform a screen test.StubStub Coppola did not want to offend Brando and stated that he needed to test equipment in order to set up the screen test at Brando's California residence.StubStub For make-up, Brando stuck cotton balls in his cheeks,Stub put shoe polish in his hair to darken it, and rolled his collar.Stub Coppola placed Brando's audition tape in the middle of the videos of the audition tapes as the Paramount executives watched them.Stub The executives were impressed with Brando's efforts and allowed Coppola to cast Brando for the role if Brando accepted a lower salary and put up a bond to ensure he would not cause any delays in production.StubStubStub Brando earned $1.6 million from a net participation deal.[42]\n\nFrom the start of production, Coppola wanted Robert Duvall to play the part of Tom Hagen.[13]StubStub After screen testing several other actors, Coppola eventually got his wish and Duvall was awarded the part.StubStub Al Martino, a then famed singer in nightclubs, was notified of the character Johnny Fontane by a friend who read the novel and felt Martino represented the character of Johnny Fontane. Martino then contacted producer Albert S. Ruddy, who gave him the part. However, Martino was stripped of the part after Coppola became director and then awarded the role to singer Vic Damone. According to Martino, after being stripped of the role, he went to Russell Bufalino, his godfather and a crime boss, who then arranged for news articles to be published that claimed Coppola was unaware of Ruddy giving Martino the part.[14] Damone eventually dropped the role because he did not want to provoke the mob, in addition to the salary being too low.[14]Stub Ultimately, the part of Johnny Fontane was given to Martino.[14]Stub Although, Frank Sinatra threatened Martino to bar him from Las Vegas if he took the role.[43]\n\nCoppola cast Diane Keaton for the role of Kay Adams owing to her reputation for being eccentric.[44] John Cazale was given the part of Fredo Corleone after Coppola saw him perform in an Off Broadway production.[44] Gianni Russo was given the role of Carlo Rizzi after he was asked to perform a screen test in which he acted out the fight between Rizzi and Connie.Stub\n\nNearing the start of filming on March 29, Michael Corleone had yet to be cast.Stub Paramount executives wanted a popular actor, either Warren Beatty or Robert Redford.StubStubStub Producer Robert Evans wanted Ryan O'Neal to receive the role, owing in part to his recent success in Love Story.Stub[45] Pacino was Coppola's favorite for the role[23] as he could picture him roaming the Sicilian countryside, and wanted an unknown actor who looked like an Italian-American.[25]Stub[45] However, Paramount executives found Pacino to be too short to play Michael.[13][14] Dustin Hoffman, Martin Sheen, Dean Stockwell, and James Caan also auditioned.[44][22] Keaton read with both Caan and Sheen.[46] Burt Reynolds was offered the role of Michael, but Brando threatened to quit if Reynolds was hired. Reynolds declined the role.[47] Jack Nicholson was also offered the role, but declined it as he felt that an Italian-American actor should play the role.[48][49] Caan was well received by the Paramount executives and was given the part of Michael initially, while the role of Sonny Corleone was awarded to Carmine Caridi.[14] Coppola still pushed for Pacino to play Michael after the fact and Evans eventually conceded, allowing Pacino to have the role of Michael as long as Caan played Sonny.Stub Evans preferred Caan over Caridi because Caan was seven inches shorter than Caridi, which was much closer to Pacino's height.[14] Despite agreeing to play Michael Corleone, Pacino was contracted to star in MGM's The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, but the two studios agreed on a settlement and Pacino was signed by Paramount three weeks before shooting began.[50]\n\nRobert De Niro originally was given the part of Paulie Gatto.StubStub A spot in The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight opened up after Al Pacino quit the project in favor of The Godfather, which led De Niro to audition for the role and leave The Godfather after receiving the part.Stub[51] De Niro also cast for the role of Sonny Corleone.[52][53][54] After De Niro quit, Johnny Martino was given the role of Gatto.[14][55][56][57][58][59][60][61]\n\nCoppola gave several roles in the film to family members.[14] He gave his sister, Talia Shire, the role of Connie Corleone.StubStub His daughter Sofia, then an infant, appeared as Michael Francis Rizzi, Connie's and Carlo's newborn son.[14][62] Carmine Coppola, his father, appeared in the film as an extra playing a piano during a scene.Stub Coppola's wife, mother, and two sons all appeared as extras in the picture.[14]\n\nSeveral smaller roles, like Luca Brasi, were cast after the filming had started.Stub\n\nFilming[]\n\nBefore the filming began, the cast received a two-week period for rehearsal, which included a dinner where each actor and actress had to assume character for its duration.Stub Filming was scheduled to begin on March 29, 1971, with the scene between Michael Corleone and Kay Adams as they leave Best & Co. in New York City after shopping for Christmas gifts.StubStub The weather on March 23 predicted snow flurries, which caused Ruddy to move the filming date forward; snow did not materialize and a snow machine was used.Stub Principal filming in New York continued until July 2, 1971.StubStub Coppola asked for a three-week break before heading overseas to film in Sicily.Stub Following the crew's departure for Sicily, Paramount announced that the release date would be moved to early 1972.Stub\n\nCinematographer Gordon Willis initially turned down the opportunity to film The Godfather because the production seemed \"chaotic\" to him.[63]Stub After Willis later accepted the offer, he and Coppola agreed to not use any modern filming devices, helicopters, or zoom lenses.Stub Willis and Coppola chose to use a \"tableau format\" of filming to make it seem as if it was viewed like a painting.Stub He made use of shadows and low light levels throughout the film to show psychological developments.Stub Willis and Coppola agreed to interplay light and dark scenes throughout the film.Stub Willis underexposed the film in order to create a \"yellow tone\".Stub The scenes in Sicily were shot to display the countryside and \"display a more romantic land,\" giving these scenes a \"softer, more romantic\" feel than the New York scenes.Stub\n\nOne of the film's most shocking moments involved an actual severed horse's head.[25]Stub The filming location for this scene is contested, as some sources indicate it was filmed at the Beverly Estate, while others indicate it was filmed at Sands Point Preserve on Long Island.[64][65][66] Coppola received some criticism for the scene, although the head was obtained from a dog-food company from a horse that was to be killed regardless of the film.Stub[67][68] On June 22, the scene where Sonny is killed was shot on a runway at Mitchel Field in Uniondale, where three tollbooths were built, along with guard rails, and billboards to set the scene.Stub Sonny's car was a 1941 Lincoln Continental with holes drilled in it to resemble bullet holes.StubStub The scene took three days to film and cost over $100,000.StubStub\n\nCoppola's request to film on location was observed; approximately 90 percent was shot in New York City and its surrounding suburbs,Stub[69] using over 120 distinct locations.[70] Several scenes were filmed at Filmways in East Harlem.Stub The remaining portions were filmed in California, or in Sicily. The scenes set in Las Vegas were not shot on location because there were insufficient funds.StubStub Savoca and Forza d'Agrò were the Sicilian towns featured in the film.[71] The opening wedding scene was shot in a Staten Island neighborhood using almost 750 locals as extras.[69]Stub The house used as the Corleone household and the wedding location was at 110 Longfellow Avenue in the Todt Hill neighborhood of Staten Island.[72]Stub[32] The wall around the Corleone compound was made from styrofoam.Stub Scenes set in and around the Corleone olive oil business were filmed on Mott Street.[70]Stub\n\nAfter filming had ended on August 7,Stub post-production efforts were focused on trimming the film to a manageable length.Stub In addition, producers and director were still including and removing different scenes from the end product, along with trimming certain sequences.Stub In September, the first rough cut of the film was viewed.Stub Many of the scenes removed from the film were centered around Sonny, which did not advance the plot.Stub By November, Coppola and Ruddy finished the semi-final cut.Stub Debates over personnel involved with the final editing remained even 25 years after the release of the film.Stub The film was shown to Paramount staff and exhibitors in late December 1971 and January 1972.Stub\n\nMusic[]\n\nMain article: The Godfather (soundtrack)Coppola hired Italian composer Nino Rota to create the underscore for the film, including \"Love Theme from The Godfather\".StubStub For the score, Rota was to relate to the situations and characters in the film.StubStub Rota synthesized new music for the film and took some parts from his 1958 Fortunella film score, in order to create an Italian feel and evoke the tragedy within the film.Stub Paramount executive Evans found the score to be too \"highbrow\" and did not want to use it; however, it was used after Coppola managed to get Evans to agree.StubStub Coppola believed that Rota's musical piece gave the film even more of an Italian feel.Stub Coppola's father, Carmine, created some additional music for the film,Stub particularly the music played by the band during the opening wedding scene.StubStub\n\nIncidental music includes \"C'è la luna mezzo mare\" and Cherubino's aria, \"Non so più cosa son\", from Le Nozze di Figaro.Stub There was a soundtrack released for the film in 1972 in vinyl form by Paramount Records, on CD in 1991 by Geffen Records, and digitally by Geffen on August 18, 2005.[73] The album contains over 31 minutes of music that was used in the film, most of which was composed by Rota, along with a song from Coppola and one by Johnny Farrow and Marty Symes.[74][75][76] AllMusic gave the album five out of five, with editor Zach Curd saying it is a \"dark, looming, and elegant soundtrack\".[74] An editor for Filmtracks believed that Rota was successful in relating the music to the film's core aspects.[76]\n\nRelease[]\n\nTheatrical[]\n\nThe world premiere for The Godfather took place at Loews's State Theatre in New York City on Tuesday, March 14, 1972, almost three months after the planned release date of Christmas Day in 1971,[77]Stub[8] with profits from the premiere donated to The Boys Club of New York.Stub Before the film premiered, the film had already made $15 million from advance rentals from over 400 theaters.[78] The following day,[79] the film opened in five theaters in New York (Loew's State I and II, Orpheum, Cine and Tower East).Stub[80][8] Next was the Imperial Theatre in Toronto[77] on March 17[81] and then Los Angeles at two theaters on March 22.[82] The Godfather was released on March 24, 1972, throughout the rest of the United StatesStub[8] reaching 316 theaters five days later.Stub\n\nHome media[]\n\nThe television rights were sold for a record $10 million to NBC for one showing over two nights.[83] The theatrical version of The Godfather debuted on American network television on NBC with only minor edits.Stub The first half of the film aired on Saturday, November 16, 1974, and the second half two days later.[84] The television airings attracted a large audience with an average Nielsen rating of 38.2 and audience share of 59% making it the eighth most-watched film on television, with the broadcast of the second half getting the third-best rating for a film on TV behind Airport and Love Story with a rating of 39.4 and 57% share.[84] The broadcast helped generate anticipation for the upcoming sequel.Stub The next year, Coppola created The Godfather Saga expressly for American television in a release that combined The Godfather and The Godfather Part II with unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for its NBC debut on November 18, 1977.Stub In 1981, Paramount released the Godfather Epic boxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities.Stub The Godfather Trilogy was released in 1992, in which the films are fundamentally in chronological order.Stub\n\nThe Godfather Family: A Look Inside was a 73-minute documentary released in 1991.[85] Directed by Jeff Warner, the film featured some behind the scenes content from all three films, interviews with the actors, and screen tests.[85] The Godfather DVD Collection was released on October 9, 2001, in a package that contained all three films—each with a commentary track by Coppola—and a bonus disc containing The Godfather Family: A Look Inside.[86] The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a \"Godfather\" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.[86]\n\nThe Godfather: The Coppola Restoration[]\n\nDuring the film's original theatrical release, the original negatives were worn down due to the reel being printed so much to meet demand.[87][88] In addition, the duplicate negative was lost in Paramount archives.[88] In 2006 Coppola contacted Steven Spielberg—whose studio DreamWorks had recently been bought out by Paramount—about restoring The Godfather.[87][88] Robert A. Harris was hired to oversee the restoration of The Godfather and its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the restoration.[89][90] Work began in November 2006 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high-resolution 4K files. If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look.[87][88] After a year and a half of working on the restoration, the project was complete.[88] Paramount called the finished product The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration and released it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc.[89][90] Dave Kehr of The New York Times believed the restoration brought back the \"golden glow of their original theatrical screenings\".[89] As a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and Coppola.[87][88][89][90][91] The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration contains several new special features that play in high definition, (including additional scenes, behind the scenes footage, etc.).[91]\n\nParamount Pictures restored and remastered The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, and The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone (a re-edited cut of the third film) for a limited theatrical run and home media release on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the premiere of The Godfather. The disc editions were released on March 22, 2022.[92]\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office[]\n\nThe Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972.[93] The film's opening day gross from five theaters was $57,829 with ticket prices increased from $3 to $3.50.[94] Prices in New York increased further at the weekend to $4, and the number of showings increased from four times a day to seven times a day.[94] The film grossed $61,615 in Toronto for the weekend[94] and $240,780 in New York,[95] for an opening weekend gross of $302,395. The film grossed $454,000 for the week in New York[94] and $115,000 in Toronto[96] for a first week gross of $568,800, which made it number one at the U.S. box office for the week.[97] In its first five days of national release, it grossed $6.8 million, taking its gross up to $7,397,164.[98] A week later its gross had reached $17,291,705[99] with the one week gross of around $10 million being an industry record.[100] It grossed another $8.7 million by April 9 to take its gross to $26,000,815.[101] After 18 weeks at number one in the United States, the film had grossed $101 million, the fastest film to reach that milestone.[102][103] Some news articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[104] but such accounts are erroneous; this record belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965.[105] It remained at number one in the US for another five weeks to bring its total to 23 consecutive weeks at number one before being unseated by Butterflies Are Free for one week before becoming number one for another three weeks.[106][107]\n\nThe film eventually earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada during its initial release,[93][108] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[109] and including a limited re-release in 1997,[110] it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million, with a production cost of $6.5 million.Stub It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner,[93] a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975.[104][111] The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.[112] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount, jumped from 77 cents per share to $3.30 a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[104] Re-released eight more times since 1997, it has grossed between $250 million and $291 million in worldwide box office receipts,[N 2] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest-grossing films.[113]\n\nCritical response[]\n\nThe Godfather has received overwhelming critical acclaim and is seen as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, particularly of the gangster genre.[114] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 9.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.\"[115] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 100 out of 100 based on 16 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[116]\n\nRoger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times praised Coppola's efforts to follow the storyline of the novel, the choice to set the film in the same time as the novel, and the film's ability to \"absorb\" the viewer over its three-hour run time.[117] Ebert named The Godfather \"The best film of 1972\".[118] The Chicago Tribune's Gene Siskel gave the film four out of four, commenting that it was \"very good\".[119]\n\nThe Village Voice's Andrew Sarris believed Brando portrayed Vito Corleone well and that his character dominated each scene it appeared in, but felt Puzo and Coppola had the character of Michael Corleone too focused on revenge.[120] In addition, Sarris stated that Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, and James Caan were good in their respective roles.[120] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote \"If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, \"The Godfather\" is it.\"[121]\n\nDesson Howe of The Washington Post called the film a \"jewel\" and wrote that Coppola deserves most of the credit for the film.[122] Writing for The New York Times, Vincent Canby felt that Coppola had created one of the \"most brutal and moving chronicles of American life\" and went on to say that it \"transcends its immediate milieu and genre\".[123][124] Director Stanley Kubrick thought the film had the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made.[125] Director Steven Spielberg listed it among his favorite films.[126] Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote negatively of the film in a contemporary review, claiming that Pacino \"rattles around in a part too demanding for him,\" while also criticizing Brando's make-up and Rota's score.[127]\n\nPrevious mafia films had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider.Stub In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society.Stub Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering.Stub George De Stefano argues that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping (such as when Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane to \"act like a man\") and is an important part of the film's appeal.Stub\n\nRemarking on the fortieth anniversary of the film's release, film critic John Podhoretz praised The Godfather as \"arguably the great American work of popular art\" and \"the summa of all great moviemaking before it\".[128] Two years before, Roger Ebert had written in his journal that it \"comes closest to being a film everyone agrees ... is unquestionably great\".[129]\n\nAccolades[]\n\nThe Godfather was nominated for seven awards at the 30th Golden Globe Awards: Best Picture – Drama, James Caan for Best Supporting Actor, Al Pacino and Marlon Brando for Best Actor – Drama, Best Score, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.[130] When the winners were announced on January 28, 1973, the film had won the categories for: Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor – Drama (Brando), Best Original Score, and Best Picture – Drama.[131][132]\n\nRota's score was also nominated for Grammy Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture or TV Special at the 15th Grammy Awards.[133][134] Rota was announced the winner of the category on March 3 at the Grammys' ceremony in Nashville, Tennessee.[133][134]\n\nWhen the nominations for the 45th Academy Awards were revealed on February 12, 1973, The Godfather was nominated for eleven awards.[135][136] The nominations were for: Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Marlon Brando for Best Actor, Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola for Best Adapted Screenplay, Pacino, Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing, Nino Rota for Best Original Score, Coppola for Best Director, and Best Sound.[135][136][137] Upon further review of Rota's love theme from The Godfather, the academy found that Rota had used a similar score in Eduardo De Filippo's 1958 comedy Fortunella.[138][139][140] This led to re-balloting, where members of the music branch chose from six films: The Godfather and the five films that had been on the shortlist for best original dramatic score but did not get nominated. John Addison's score for Sleuth won this new vote, and thus replaced Rota's score on the official list of nominees.[141] Going into the awards ceremony, The Godfather was seen as the favorite to take home the most awards.[131] From the nominations that The Godfather had remaining, it only won three of the Academy Awards: Best Actor for Brando, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture.[137][142]\n\nBrando, who did not attend the Golden Globes ceremony two months earlier,[140][143] boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony and declined the Oscar,[144] becoming the second actor to decline a Best Actor award after George C. Scott in 1971.[145][146] Brando sent American Indian Rights activist Sacheen Littlefeather in his place, to announce at the awards podium Brando's reasons for declining the award, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.[145][146][147] Pacino also boycotted the ceremony;[144] he was insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, when he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor-winner Brando, and thus should have received the nomination for Best Actor.[148]\n\nThe Godfather had five nominations for awards at the 26th British Academy Film Awards. The nominees were: Pacino for Most Promising Newcomer, Rota for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Duvall for Best Supporting Actor, and Brando for Best Actor, the film's costume designer Anna Hill Johnstone for Best Costume Design. The only nomination to win was that of Rota.[149]\n\nList of accolades[]\n\nAwards and nominations received by The Godfather Award Category Nominee Result 45th Academy Awards Best Picture Albert S.

On the same list it was ranked at number twenty one by critics.[177][178][179]\n\n2014 The Godfather was voted the greatest film in a Hollywood Reporter poll of 2120 industry members, including every studio, agency, publicity firm and production house in Hollywood in 2014.[180]\n\n2015 Second on the BBC's \"100 Greatest American Films\", voted by film critics from around the world.[181]\n\nRepresentation in other media[]\n\nThe film has been referenced and parodied in various kinds of media.[182]\n\nJohn Belushi appeared in a Saturday Night Live sketch as Vito Corleone in a therapy session; he said of the Tattaglia Family, \"Also, they shot my son Santino 56 times\".[183]\n\nIn the television show The Sopranos, Silvio Dante's topless bar is named Bada Bing!, a phrase popularized by James Caan's character Sonny Corleone in The Godfather.[184]\n\nIn the animated television series The Simpsons, there have been many references to the film. For instance, in the season 3 episode \"Lisa's Pony\", Lisa wakes up to find a horse in her bed and starts screaming, a reference to Jack finding his prize racehorse's head in his bed. In the season 4 episode \"Mr. Plow\", Bart Simpson is pelted with snowballs in mimicry of Sonny's killing.[185][186][187]\n\nThe film's baptism sequence was parodied in \"Fulgencio\", the 13th episode of season 4 of the comedy series Modern Family, with Phil Dunphy standing in for Michael. The sequence also references the horse head scene when Phil's son Luke places a severed zebra head in the bed of a boy who had been making fun of him and had a fear of zebras. Phil also references Godfather lines when he tells his wife Claire, \"Don't ask me about my business,\" and mentions an offer he can't refuse.[188]\n\nThe 2006 video game The Godfather is based upon this film and tells the story of an original character, Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions.[189][190] Duvall, Caan, and Brando supplied voiceovers and their likenesses,[191] but Pacino did not.[191] Francis Ford Coppola openly voiced his disapproval of the game.[192]\n\nOn April 28, 2022, a 10-episode drama series The Offer premiered on Paramount+, about the production told from the perspective of producer Ruddy.[193]\n\nAn episode of the animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants entitled \"The Goobfather\" from the 13th season has many scenes that directly parody this film.\n\nThe 2023 film Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, features a scene in which the characters watch The Godfather, with Ken, portrayed by Kingsley Ben-Adir, praising the film as a collective effort of Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Evans. A clip from The Godfather is also shown, showing Marlon Brando in the opening scene of the film.[194]\n\n==See also==*List of films set in Las Vegas\n\n[]\n\nWikiquote has a collection of quotations from or about:\n\nImage:Commons-logo.svg|left|50px|\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\n[http:// Official website]\n\nThe Godfather at IMDb\n\nTemplate:First word The Godfather at the American Film Institute CatalogScript error: No such module \"EditAtWikidata\".\n\nThe Godfather at Box Office Mojo\n\nThe Godfather at Rotten Tomatoes\n\nThe Godfather at Metacritic\n\nThe Godfather essay by Michael Sragow on the National Film Registry website\n\nReferences[]"
