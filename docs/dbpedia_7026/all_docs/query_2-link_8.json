        "text": "Vito & Carmela Corleone in The Godfather Saga\n\nbecause @nightclubflunkie asked for it :P\n\nhere my ‘essay’ about the Vito/Carmela Corleone relationship in THE GODFATHER universe. I exploited every media i had from it –the 3 movies, the original novel, and the PART IV screenplay unfinished by Mario Puzo but used as draft for the novel The CORLEONE FAMILY.\n\nI put into words the things i know & feel about them. it’s a bit silly, and maybe i’m wrong, but hey! I TRIED! and sorry for my english…\n\nTo start, important point: they married for love. It is not stated in the book or in the movie but when you look at facts, it seems clear. Vito was an orphan boy when he arrived in America, without money or family or any possesion. For what we know, Signore Abbandando took care of him and offered him a job in his shop. Carmela is depicted as being a traditional Sicilian woman freeshly arrived from Italy, religious, skilled cook, poor as well.\n\nMarriages, in the beginning of the 20th century were still mainly arranged or at least, about what you partenair could offer to you (a name, safety, fortune…). These two had literally nothing to offer to the other. The fact that Carmela’s parents had allowed her to marry a man without family or good prospects, proves that they have been convinced by Vito, trusting him enough with her future. Or another possibility: Carmela was an orphan as well. Both cases, it tends to support the idea that their only motivation was the affection they had for each other. When wealth is not in the balance (as it was the case here), love seems to be the only other option.\n\nVito’s courtship must have been quite something tbh. Being the quiet and silent man we know, not very talkative even with his closest friends, I imagine acts and gestures from him more than words (like some flowers, a nice Prosciutto ham, walks by the East River, even maybe one or two theatre outings…).\n\nLet’s talk about the canon universe now.\n\nMovie Part I - Vito & Carmela are both Sicilian. I will quote the movie: ‘In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns’. I wouldn’t say that she could ‘defy’ Vito. No, because she was a very traditional woman from the 1910’s and knew her place. But she had character. For example, The Godfather I is known to have many deleted scenes from the original script and Carmela’s character is much more visible in that original work:\n\nKAY : Will you give this letter to Michael.\n\n(Carmela takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved)\n\nHAGEN : Mama, no.\n\nMAMA : You tell me what to do? Even he don’t tell me what to do.\n\nKAY : Why did they blame Michael?\n\nMAMA : You listen to me, you go home to your family, and you find a good young man and get married. Forget about Mikey; he’s no good for you, anymore.\n\n(She looks directly into KAY’s eyes; and KAY understands what that means.)\n\nTwo interesting things: EVEN *HE* DOESN’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO\n\nOf course, the *HE* here is Vito and it’s the only time Carmela talks about her husband in PART I. It shows that they both -Vito & Carmela- respects each, both knowing their respective role. She doesn’t interfere in her husband’s business and he doesn’t feel any need to put her in her place or to 'educate’ her (like he does with his children for example). There are mutual trust and respect.\n\nBy the way, the only time Vito talks about his wife in PART I is after Sonny’s murder: “My wife was weeping before she fell asleep” and “I don’t want his mother to see him as he is”. A tragedy happens, and he doesn’t want Carmela to endure more of it. A paradox tho, since his life is the reason of these events, and yet, he wants to protect her and their family.\n\nThen the: FORGET ABOUT MIKEY. HE’S NO GOOD FOR YOU ANYMORE\n\nCarmela knows. Even if Vito wants to keep a separation between the family sphere and the business one, Carmela knows -about the mafia and the deads and the money and the bribery- and she knows that Michael is taking the same path, so she ask Kay to leave. Does it mean Carmela would have leaved if she had the chance? I doubt it. Again, she is sicilian and came from a place where, back then, mafia and death and men dying young were something common. You just live with it. She is probaly thinking that Kay has not strong shoulders to endure it.\n\nIn PART I, there is no real interaction between Carmela & Vito. Except for two moments: the first time at Connie’s wedding, a very happy and joyful moment, both of them dancing and smiling together ; and the second time, a hard one with Vito lying in his bed at home after an attempted murder, Carmela by his side. These two scenes, the only ones they share together in PART I, underscore very well their whole life as a couple: happy and pleasant and light moments VS dark and hard and violent ones. But always together.\n\nAgain, opposition, dark/light. Just like the opposition between their fervent catholic faith, and Vito’s & his sons’ activities. Carmela in the original script is the only one with a religious ritual: she lights candles every day and attends Mass, praying for forgiveness and mercy (as stated in the book “to keep her husband’s soul from going down there”), probably since that day Vito brought back home a beautiful rug without real explanation.\n\nNow, PART II, Vito & Carmela during their youth in Little Italy, 1910’s.\n\nA couple without money, neither with despair. A tough life with simple pleasures (Carmela’s smile when Vito brings home a beautiful pear for dessert <3 or Vito’s face lightening up every time his eyes lay on his little family <3<3). They both are devoted to each other, and always will be. As proof, the scene when one of Vito’s friends, Genzo, invites him to see a play where his new crush has a role -a beautiful italian actress- and Vito simply replies: 'For me, there is only my wife’.\n\nWith his new illegal activities, Vito changed of course. In the book, Carmela dared once to make a remark about the dangerousness of this new life, and her husband simply but firmly answered “Do you think you’ve married a fool?”. That’s the only time in the whole saga we see a tension between them, and even fear from Carmela. Vito’s motivation was and always has been his family’s safety and well-being, but his smile indeed turned into something much more sinister during this ‘era’ of big changes.\n\nYet, after a few weeks/months, she accepted completely their new way of life. She accepted it so well that she used Vito’s influence to help her friends (Signora Columbo for example). Such attitude surprised him at first but Vito seemed satisfied by his wife welcoming his new ‘position’ in the community.\n\nHe was surprised. His wife had never questioned him about the clothes he had washed the night he had murdered Fanucci. Had never asked him where all the money came from when he was not working. Even now her face was impassive. [Then, Vito accepetd to help his wife’s friend] Carmela gave him a smile which he did not acknowledge but he felt pleased. (from the novel by Mario Puzo)\n\nCarmela is slowly accepting her role and is turning into the wife of a Don. She is becoming her first and strongest support. As stated in the book, even if Vito changed and became more secretive, he remained the same to the core, the affectionate and kind husband & father she had always known (cf. the kisses and many affectionate gestures we spot in the movies and in the novels).\n\ntbh, she is the person knowing Vito the best. In the second movie, when Mickael wants to know about his father’s state of mind, wondering “What did Papa think deep in his heart?”, he goes of course to his mother, to mama-Corleone, and talks with her. Carmela was there when Vito was a 'simple’ man and turned into the 'Don’ -she is able to read him even when he tries to hide from her.\n\nThere is another scene when they visit Sicily and the whole family is around a table, enjoying a meal and offering gifts -it is safe to state that Vito didn’t say to Carmela that he was planning a vendetta, to assasinate his parents’ murderer. And yet, during that scene, the camera lingers on Carmela’s face when she is looking at Vito playing with Sonny. Her features turn down and, is2g, we can read on them 'Vito, stay with your family and do not spread death’. SPOILERS ALERT: he spread death.\n\nOr another scene from the novel 'The family Corleone’ by Edward Falco (based on Mario Puzzo’ screenplay, originally made for a PART IV movie narrating the ascension of Vito as Don), shows the support and the no-need of conversation between them: Vito sat in his study window, with his cigar and his drink, until Carmella came to the door and knocked once before opening it. When she saw Vito in the window seat, she sat alongside him. She didn’t say anything. She looked at his face, and then took his hand in hers and rubbed his fingers the way he liked, kneading the joints and knuckles one by one as the last of the daylight faded.\n\nShe knows him by heart -and know his dark 'business’. Yet, in opposition to the toxic universe surrounding her, Carmela’s attitude is not sinister at all -she smiles, she cooks happily, she sings. In PART I, older mama Corleone sings and dances at the wedding. In PART II, she is sarcastic and acerbic -she even makes Tom laugh <3. A dry sense of humor we see as well in the original script of PART I when she and Kay go to the church ans she says: “The Priest ain’t gonna bite you cause you’re not Catholic. (whispered) He’s in the back drinkin’ his wine.”\n\nSarcastic and yet, she has this warmth we expect from an italian 'mama’. She speaks with her hands, smiles easily… she represents the human aspect of the Corleone family, the last sinless piece of soul and moral in this family. Something you don’t want to corupte or hurt. Mickael postponing Fredo’s assasination as long as she is alive proves that even he considers her as the morality of the family, waiting for it to disappear to make such a vile act.\n\nIn the novel 'The family Corleone’, Vito acts the same. He wants to keeps Carmela 'safe’:\n\nVito thought about going home, but that thought was followed immediately by a picture of Carmella in the kitchen, at the stove, making dinner, and the recognition that at some point he’d have to tell her about Sonny [joining his father’s business]. The thought grieved him (…) he dreaded the look that he knew with certainty would come over her face, a look that would include at least in part an accusation.\n\nFinally, in PART III, we do not see Vito or Carmela. There are a lot of references about Vito of course, but just one of Carmela. And once more, an interesting one. When Michael confesses his sins to the cardinal, he confesses he killed his brother Fredo and says: “I killed my mother’s son. I killed my father’s son.” My Mother’s son comes first, like if Mickael felt more responsabilities toward his mother, toward the family’s moral keeper.\n\ntl;dr: Vito/Carmela dynamic changed through the years, from a 'simple’ couple without money ; to a 'shaky’ one because of the new violence in their life ; to eventually a very supportive & devoted pairing. Vito is the rock she can always count on, she can always trust him to give her and their kids love - Carmela is Vito’s lighthouse in a sea of dark water, the only haven of innocence in his life he cherishs and wants to protect. A relationship that survives many issues but based on genuine affection and love,"
