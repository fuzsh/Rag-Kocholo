This is an original, French four panel theatrical movie poster from 1975 for The Godfather Part II starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale. Francis Ford Coppola directed the Academy Award-winning sequel to The Godfather.

The billboard-style poster measures 91.25" x 122.25" (about 8 feet wide by 10 feet tall) and was printed in 4 sections designed to overlap. It is in very good to excellent, unused condition with minimal edge and fold wear from long-term storage and handling. It was folded at the time of printing. Most folds flatten out nicely for framing and are often desirable for vintage, collectible movie posters.

Please look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image.

This very rare and collectible poster, printed in 1975 to promote the initial, French theatrical release of The Godfather Part II, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
