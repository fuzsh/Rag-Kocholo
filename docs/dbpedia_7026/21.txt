This is an original, teaser one-sheet movie poster from 1974 for The Godfather Part II starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale. Francis Ford Coppola directed the Academy Award-winning sequel to The Godfather.

The Christmas advance poster measures 27" x 41" and is in very good condition. It was tri-folded at the time of printing (with no vertical fold down the middle). Someone briefly folded it vertically by hand resulting in some faint vertical fold lines. There are a few, tiny surface scuffs, creases, and some minor wear along the horizontal folds. The poster has been stored flat for many years and will be rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.

Please look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.

This extremely rare and collectible poster, printed in 1974 to tease the Christmas theatrical release of The Godfather Part II, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
