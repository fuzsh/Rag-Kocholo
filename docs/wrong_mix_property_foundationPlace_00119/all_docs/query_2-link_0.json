        "text": "This article is about the Group Leader in Breaking Bad. For the Better Call Saul character, see Group Leader (Better Call Saul).\n\nThe \"Group Leader\" is Jesse Pinkman's primary counsellor at the rehabilitation clinic where he was previously a patient.\n\nAfter Jesse was released, he began attending regular group therapy sessions in a local church which were also lead by the leader from the clinic.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nOn July 18, 1992, while drunk on vodka and high on cocaine, he killed his six-year-old daughter by accidentally hitting her with his truck.\n\nBreaking Bad[]\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nJesse first meets the Group Leader after he has been living at the facility for the past two months and attends an outdoor group therapy session at a campfire with several other recovering addicts.\n\nWhen Jesse asks the Group Leader how he has accepted himself, he reveals he hit his daughter with his car, killing her. Jesse, still reeling from Jane's death, asks the Group Leader how can he not hate himself for what happened. The Group Leader responds that self-hatred and guilt stand in the way of achieving true change. (\"No Más\")\n\nDuring the rehabilitation, the Group Leader tells an unconcentrated Jesse that his injured face is improving and asked about his life, where he describes his new workplace as a boring corporate laundromat. \"My boss is a dick,\" Jesse complains, adding that the owner is \"a super dick\" whom everyone fears. The group leader refers to Jesse's situation as \"Kafkaesque\", Jesse agrees with him while not understanding what the word means.\n\nThe following day, he gives a speech about daily lives is to help each other, what their relapse triggers, and forget their illness before it comes back. The Group Leader recalls Jesse's overwhelming job at the laundromat then asked him what would he do if he have the chance to do anything he wanted. Jesse first replied to grow more money but the Group Leader disregards it and requested him to assume what he all want. Jesse recounts being inspired by a high school woodworking teacher. At first, Jesse slacked off on in the teacher's class, but when chastised with not being able to do any better, he eventually painstakingly created an intricate box. When asked what he did with it, Jesse says he gave it to his mother. When the group leader suggests \"it's never too late\", and that Jesse should take art classes, Jesse admits that he didn't really give the box to his mother, but traded it for an ounce of weed. (\"Kafkaesque\")\n\nThe Group Leader gives a speech about urging to be yourself, and moving forward from life. He then notices newcomers such as Andrea Cantillo attending the support group; he starts by asking Andrea to introduce herself, but she gives a bit of dissatisfaction after by honestly saying \"I don't wanna be here.\" The Group Leader is adequate by her response and asked for other members. (\"Abiquiú\")\n\nSeason 4[]\n\nAfter not attending his meetings for several weeks, Jesse decides to return as he is feeling distraught about killing Gale Boetticher. However, during the session, Jesse nearly breaks down and yells at Group Leader claiming that his philosophies on \"accepting yourself\" are flawed. Jesse then mentions the death of Group Leader's daughter and admits to the whole group that the only reason he came to the group meetings is to sell meth to them. He asks Group Leader if he's okay with that, to which the group leader responds, \"No.\" Jesse then says, \"About time,\" and leaves the session (\"Problem Dog\").\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\nThe Group Leader takes a calm, non-judgmental approach to leading discussions and emphasizes that those attending his sessions are there not to improve themselves, but to learn self-acceptance.\n\nDeaths[]\n\nMurders committed by Group Leader[]\n\nHis daughter: Killed accidentally by hitting her with a truck while he was high.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nBreaking Bad[]\n\nEpisodes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Season 1 Season 2 Season 3 ✔ ✔ ✔ Season 4 ✔ Season 5A Season 5B\n\nTrivia[]"
