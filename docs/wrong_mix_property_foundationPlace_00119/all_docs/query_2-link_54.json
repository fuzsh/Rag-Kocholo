        "text": "We’ve assumed that the money in your pension account will continue to be invested in the same funds (or Multi Asset Portfolio) you invest in now and in the same proportion until your target retirement date. Please bear in mind that the actual investment returns will depend on the types of funds you invest in and may be different from the assumptions used. The assumptions we’ve used are shown in the table below.\n\nFund name Investment return (% per year) Total expense ratio Atlas Active Corporate Bond Fund s3 3.59% 0.510% Atlas Active Emerging Markets Equity Fund s3 5.83% 1.170% Atlas Active Multi Asset Fund s3 3.87% 0.600% Atlas Asia Pacific (ex Japan) Equity Index Tracker Fund s3 6.70% 0.300% Atlas Cash Fund s3 1.75% 0.250% Atlas Corporate Bond Index Tracker Fund s3 2.75% 0.250% Atlas Emerging Markets Index Tracker Fund s3 6.60% 0.400% Atlas Ethical Fund s3 4.98% 0.930% Atlas Europe (ex UK) Equity Index Tracker Fund s3 6.70% 0.300% Atlas Flexible Access Retirement Fund s3 1.66% 0.560% Atlas Flexible Pre-Retirement Fund s3 3.42% 0.350% Atlas Global Equity Index Tracker Fund s3 6.28% 0.270% Atlas Inflation-Linked Annuity Target Fund s3 2.23% 0.250% Atlas Japan Equity Index Tracker Fund s3 6.70% 0.300% Atlas Level Annuity Target Fund s3 2.40% 0.250% Atlas Multi Asset Portfolio 1 s3 5.38% 0.554% Atlas Multi Asset Portfolio 2 s3 4.48% 0.506% Atlas Multi Asset Portfolio 3 s3 3.63% 0.467% Atlas North American Equity Index Tracker Fund s3 6.78% 0.220% Atlas Over 15 Years Gilts Index Tracker Fund s3 1.75% 0.250% Atlas Over 5 Years Index-Linked Gilts Index Tracker Fund s3 1.75% 0.250% Atlas Passive Multi Asset Fund s3 4.92% 0.470% Atlas Retirement Income Drawdown Fund s3 4.15% 0.590% Atlas Shariah Compliant Fund s3 6.50% 0.450% Atlas Sustainable Equity Fund s3 6.33% 0.545% Atlas UK Direct Property Fund s3 3.12% 0.750% Atlas UK Equity Index Tracker Fund s3 5.70% 0.300% Atlas World (ex UK) Equity Index Tracker Fund s3 6.70% 0.300%\n\nIn working out the yearly income your personal account could get you, we have assumed:\n\nAn annuity rate (cost of buying each £1 per year of pension) based on your individual target retirement date, sex and date of birth.\n\nThe pension you buy will increase annually in line with increases in inflation (the Retail Prices Index), which are assumed to be 2.5% per year.\n\nThe pension will be payable monthly.\n\nThe pension will be payable for the rest of your life, for a minimum of five years.\n\n50% of the pension will continue to be paid to a person who is three years older than you (if you are a woman) or three years younger than you (if you are a man) on your death.\n\nThat you don’t take any money from your pension account as tax-free cash when you take your benefits. If you decide to take tax-free cash, your annuity will be smaller.\n\nFor the purposes of any drawdown illustration provided, we have assumed:\n\nInflation is 2.5%.\n\nAn investment growth of the Atlas Multi Asset Portfolio 3 fund.\n\nThat your drawdown income increases each year in line with inflation.\n\nThe amount of any pension payable under the Scheme for you will depend on considerations that may be different from any assumptions made by us. These include the actual performance of investments and the ultimate cost of securing an income (such as an annuity) at the time you take your benefits.\n\nThe projected benefits shown in your benefit statement are for illustrative purposes only. They’re not a guarantee.\n\nThe Trustee has taken care to ensure the accuracy of the information contained in your benefit statement. However, the Trustee can only pay benefits in accordance with the rules of the Scheme. In the case of any discrepancy between the information in this benefit statement and the rules of the Scheme, the rules of the Scheme will determine your benefit entitlement.\n\nThe information provided in your benefit statement is not individual financial advice and should not be used as the only basis on which you take any decision regarding your future pension arrangements or any other financial commitment. The Trustee of SEI will always recommend that you seek independent financial advice when reviewing your pension arrangements or other financial commitments. Neither the Trustee, SEI, nor Capita can give you financial advice. Visit www.unbiased.co.uk or www.moneyandpensionsservice.org.uk for more details on where to find an independent financial adviser."
