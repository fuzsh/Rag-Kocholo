        "text": "#DeloitteESGNow — Frequently Asked Questions About the E.U. Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive\n\nBackground\n\nQuestions and Answers\n\nQuestion 1\n\nAnswer\n\nQuestion 2\n\nAnswer\n\nThe CSRD will be applied in four stages. For the first in-scope year, 2024, only large U.S. companies that are listed on an E.U.-regulated market and have more than 500 employees will be subject to the CSRD. Starting in 2025, all U.S. companies that are large and listed on an E.U.-regulated market will be within the scope of the CSRD, and additional U.S. companies can be brought into scope if they have a large E.U.-based subsidiary (regardless of whether they are listed on an E.U.-regulated market; see Question 1 for the definition of a large undertaking/group). The timeline below describes the requirements introduced at each stage from the perspective of a U.S.-based company.\n\nQuestion 3\n\nAnswer\n\nQuestion 4\n\nAnswer\n\nBelow is a brief summary of the relationship of the CSRD to those regulations and standards:\n\nEuropean Sustainable Finance Action Plan — In recent years, the European Union has formed multiple initiatives to connect finance and sustainability through the 2018 Action Plan on Sustainable Finance; the Green Deal, which includes the EC’s renewed sustainable finance strategy; and the Sustainable Finance Package. The graphic below illustrates the timeline of the developments in recent years.\n\nNon-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) — The NFRD was adopted in 2014 and requires large public-interest companies that have more than 500 employees and are listed within the European Union to provide nonfinancial disclosures related to ESG matters along with their annual financial reports.\n\nThe CSRD replaces and expands the existing requirements of the NFRD and extends the scope of companies required to disclose sustainability information from approximately 11,700 to 50,000 companies in the European Union, with another 3,000 or more U.S.-based companies estimated to be affected. Ultimately, the scope of the CSRD may be affected by how each E.U. member state transposes it into law.\n\nEU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities — The EU Taxonomy for Sustainable Activities, also known as the “EU Taxonomy,” is a classification system that establishes a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities that are consistent with the six environmental objectives pursued in the European Union as well as minimum social and human rights safeguards. The EU Taxonomy provides entities, investors, and policymakers with appropriate definitions and criteria (including science-based technical criteria) with which to identify economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable. While aiming to create security for investors and protect private investors from greenwashing, the EU Taxonomy also (1) helps companies become more climate-friendly, (2) mitigates market fragmentation, and (3) promotes a shift in investments to where they are most needed. The EU Taxonomy allows entities to comply with the EU Taxonomy Regulation,17 which establishes six environmental objectives — climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; the transition to a circular economy; pollution prevention and control; and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nThe CSRD ties into Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation by requiring companies to report various key performance indicators, which vary on the basis of the nature of the entity, with respect to all six environmental objectives. For example, a company within the scope of the CSRD will be required to report its turnover, capital expenses, and operational expenses with respect to all six environmental objectives. As shown in the chart above and explained in Question 10, once an entity is within the scope of the CSRD, its sustainability reporting, including the EU Taxonomy information, will be subject to mandatory limited assurance.\n\nSustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) — The SFDR requires certain financial market participants and advisors to provide transparency in sustainability reporting on (1) the ESG qualities of the financial products that are offered to their clients as part of existing precontractual and periodic disclosure obligations, and subsequently reflected on their Web sites, and (2) how they incorporate sustainability matters into their investment decisions. These requirements, which are in addition to those of the CSRD, apply to financial market participants that offer investment products in the European Union, financial advisors who guide E.U. consumers, and non-E.U. financial institutions operating in the European Union or transacting with E.U.-based clients.\n\nCorporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) — Currently in development, the CSDDD is a future E.U. directive that would introduce required due diligence steps that companies must follow regarding human rights and environmental impacts. The directive would require companies to identify and remediate any negative human rights and environmental impacts within their own operations as well as those of their subsidiaries and up and down their value chains. The goal of the CSDDD is to encourage sustainable and responsible corporate behavior and operations. While these requirements would be in addition to those of the CSRD, there may be a number of synergies between the two directives, such as on the disclosure of value chain impacts and transition plans and the requirement to have a climate transition plan aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nEuropean Green Bond Standard — The European Green Bond Standard was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on November 30, 2023. It is a voluntary standard to help scale up and raise the environmental ambitions of the green bond market. Applying this standard would allow issuers to demonstrate that they are funding legitimate green projects aligned with the EU Taxonomy. The EU Green Bond Standard sets out requirements that would enable companies to claim that they are issuing an “EU green bond,” a label that is expected to be sought by the financial sector, which aims to invest in sustainable investments. Entities that do not follow the EU Green Bond Standard would not be entitled to claim that they are issuing “green bonds.” The requirements of the EU Green Bond Standard include references to the EU Taxonomy.\n\nQuestion 5\n\nAnswer\n\nThe CSRD will require disclosure and assurance on a much broader suite of ESG topics than would the SEC’s proposed rule on climate-related disclosures. The CSRD will include requirements for non-climate-related environmental topics and various social topics, while the SEC’s proposed rule18 on climate-related disclosures would only mandate disclosures specific to climate impacts and risk. The table below highlights the main differences between the SEC’s proposed regulation and the CSRD.\n\nQuestion 6\n\nAnswer\n\nQuestion 7\n\nAnswer\n\nQuestion 8\n\nAnswer\n\nThe CSRD provides three different reporting options for non-E.U. parent companies with E.U.-based subsidiaries — one global reporting route and two E.U. reporting routes — to ensure that all entities within the scope of the CSRD ultimately report the required information. The global reporting route allows a U.S. (i.e., non-E.U.) parent company to report in accordance with the CSRD for itself and for all of its subsidiaries (i.e., one report covering the entire consolidated company from the perspective of the parent). The E.U. reporting route provides two additional options. The first, which is available until 2029, allows the largest E.U. subsidiary to produce a consolidated report containing information for all E.U. subsidiaries within the scope of the CSRD. This option is not for the enterprise-wide consolidated report; rather, this “artificial consolidation” is only allowed if the E.U. subsidiaries are not held by an E.U. holding company. The second option allows each E.U. subsidiary within the scope of the CSRD to issue a separate sustainability report. The graphic below provides further information.\n\nQuestion 9\n\nAnswer\n\nThese two concepts can be interrelated, such as when an undertaking’s impact on the environment generates a financial risk. Sustainability information meets the criteria of double materiality if it is material from the impact perspective, the financial perspective, or both perspectives. The graphic below illustrates the two dimensions of double materiality: financial materiality and impact materiality.\n\nQuestion 10\n\nAnswer\n\nQuestion 11\n\nAnswer\n\nQuestion 12\n\nAnswer\n\nQuestion 13\n\nAnswer\n\nPreparing for CSRD Compliance — Important Steps\n\nThe table below assumes an inaugural reporting year of 2026 for FY 2025 data.\n\nAppendix\n\nContacts\n\nFor information about Deloitte’s service offerings related to ESG matters, please contact:\n\nEric Knachel\n\nAudit & Assurance Partner\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 203 761 3625\n\nKristen Sullivan\n\nAudit & Assurance Partner\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 203 708 4593\n\nAllie Bruflodt\n\nAudit & Assurance Senior Manager\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 612 397 4172\n\nSara Raquel Macferran\n\nAudit & Assurance Senior Manager\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 813 294 0912\n\nRagan Powell\n\nAudit & Assurance Senior Manager\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 469 417 2356\n\nMike Shonce\n\nAudit & Assurance Senior Manager\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 313 394 5694\n\nAshley Frambach Baker\n\nAudit & Assurance Manager\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 650 245 9345\n\nKyle Boyce\n\nAudit & Assurance Senior\n\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\n\n+1 415 783 4092\n\nFootnotes\n\nHeads Up is prepared by members of Deloitte's National Office as developments warrant.
