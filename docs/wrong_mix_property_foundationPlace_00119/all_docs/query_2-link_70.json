        "text": "All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received.\n\nDirectional arrows indicate changes between the current week and the previous week. Additional information on the arrows can be found at the bottom of this page.\n\nA description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page.\n\nAdditional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive.\n\nNovel Influenza A Virus:\n\nFive human infections with influenza A(H5) virus were reported by the Colorado Department of Health and Environment.\n\nFive individuals in Colorado, each aged >18 years, tested positive for influenza A(H5) virus. All five had performed disposal and culling operations prior to symptom onset at the same commercial poultry farm where highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 had been detected in poultry. All five individuals reported mild symptoms; none were hospitalized; all were offered oseltamivir for treatment; and all are recovering from their illnesses.\n\nAll five individuals reported their symptoms to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment during daily active monitoring on the farm conducted by public health staff. Specimens were collected from the individuals. Specimens were initially tested at the Colorado State Public Health Laboratory using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) influenza A(H5) assay before being sent to CDC for further testing. The specimens were received and tested at CDC. Specimens from all five individuals were positive for influenza A and A(H5) virus using diagnostic rRT-PCR at CDC. Additional analysis including genetic sequencing is underway.\n\nIn response to these detections, additional case investigation and surveillance activities are ongoing by public health officials, including additional specimen collection at this farm from symptomatic individuals. Further symptom screening will continue.\n\nA total of ten people have tested positive for A(H5) virus in the United States since 2022. The first case occurred in April 2022 in Colorado in an individual who had performed poultry culling; the next four occurred in April-June 2024 in individuals who worked with dairy cows in Texas (one case) and Michigan (two cases); followed by these five cases associated with poultry disposal and culling operations in Colorado in July 2024.\n\nInterim recommendations for Prevention, Monitoring, and Public Health Investigations are available at https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/prevention/hpai-interim-recommendations.html.\n\nInformation about avian influenza is available at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/index.htm.\n\nThe latest case reports on avian influenza outbreaks in wild birds, commercial poultry; backyard or hobbyist flocks; and mammals in the United States are available from the USDA at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.\n\nAdditional information regarding human infections with novel influenza A viruses:\n\nSurveillance Methods | FluView Interactive\n\nCDC antigenically characterizes influenza viruses by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) (H1N1pdm09, H3N2, B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata viruses) or neutralization-based HINT (H3N2 viruses) using antisera that ferrets make after being infected with reference viruses representing the 2023-2024 Northern Hemisphere recommended cell or recombinant-based vaccine viruses. Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than or equal to 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses.\n\nInfluenza A Viruses\n\nA (H1N1)pdm09: 494 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 493 (99.8%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/67/2022-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\n\nA (H3N2): 555 A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HI or HINT, and 535 (96.4%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer in HI or reacting at titers that were less than or equal to 8-fold of the homologous virus in HINT) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\n\nInfluenza B Viruses\n\nB/Victoria: 400 influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines.\n\nB/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization.\n\nFour A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses had NA-H275Y amino acid substitution and one A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-H275H/Y, conferring highly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir and peramivir. One (H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-I223V and NA-S247N amino acid substitutions and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Two B viruses had NA-A245G amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by peramivir. One B virus had NA-D197N amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by zanamivir and peramivir. One B virus had NA-H273Y amino acid substitution and showed highly reduced inhibition by zanamivir and peramivir. One A(H3N2) virus had PA-I38T amino acid substitution and showed reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.\n\nHigh levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses (the adamantanes are not effective against influenza B viruses). Therefore, use of these antivirals for treatment and prevention of influenza A virus infection is not recommended and data from adamantane resistance testing are not presented.\n\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance\n\nThe U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with pathogens that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. It is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a more complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is providing integrated information about COVID-19, influenza, and RSV activity on a website that is updated weekly. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website.\n\nOutpatient Respiratory Illness Visits\n\nNationally, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness that were reported through ILINet remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) compared to the previous week and is below the national baseline. All 10 regions are below their region-specific baselines. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location.\n\nHospitalization Surveillance\n\nFluSurv-NET\n\nThe Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations in select counties in 14 states and represents approximately 9% of the U.S. population. FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly.\n\nA total of 25,274 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2023, and July 13, 2024. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in Week 28 was 0.1 per 100,000 population. The peak weekly hospitalization rate observed this season was 9.0 per 100,000 population and occurred during Week 52.\n\nAmong 25,274 hospitalizations, 21,371 (84.6%) were associated with influenza A virus, 3,720 (14.7%) with influenza B virus, 52 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 131 (0.5%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among those with influenza A subtype information, 4,238 (67.8%) were A(H1N1) pdm09 and 2,009 (32.2%) were A(H3N2).\n\nWorld Health Organization:\n\nAdditional influenza surveillance information from participating WHO member nations is available through\n\nFluNet and the Global Epidemiology Reports.\n\nWHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza:\n\nAustralia, China, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States (CDC in Atlanta, Georgia)\n\nEurope:\n\nThe most up-to-date influenza information from Europe is available from WHO/Europe and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nPublic Health Agency of Canada:\n\nThe most up-to-date influenza information from Canada is available in Canada’s weekly FluWatch report.\n\nPublic Health England:\n\nThe most up-to-date influenza information from the United Kingdom is available from Public Health England.\n\nAny links provided to non-Federal organizations are provided solely as a service to our users.
