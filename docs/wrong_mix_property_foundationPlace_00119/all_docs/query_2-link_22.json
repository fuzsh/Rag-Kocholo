With its diverse cast and hopeful messages, the show has sailed straight into the hearts of viewers around the world and established itself as a true tour de force.\n\nExceptional Success in the US and Beyond\n\nMuch like Stede Bonnet's improbable dreams of piracy, the first season of \"Our Flag Means Death\" faced significant challenges. With limited pre-release promotion and without a pre-existing intellectual property, the show made a remarkable impact by generating 11.9 times more interest than the average US show upon its debut. By the time the final episode aired, \"Our Flag Means Death\" had achieved a 208% increase in viewership, effectively tripling its audience. Most notably, it dethroned Max's top original series, \"Euphoria,\" and maintained its position as the network's #1 show for seven consecutive weeks.\n\nAfter the season finale, \"Our Flag Means Death\" garnered 'Exceptional' interest in the United States, ranking in the top 0.2% of shows across all platforms. Peak interest surpassed the national average by a remarkable 39.7 times. Parrot Analytics, a respected authority on audience demand that represents roughly 2 billion people worldwide, recognized it as the #1 Breakout Series among American audiences.\n\nOn a global scale, the series became the 5th most sought-after show among the combined libraries of HBO and Max. It received \"Outstanding\" attention in 34 countries, placing it in the top 3% of shows in those nations. At its peak, it reached its highest ranking as the 11th most in-demand series worldwide.\n\nIndustry Recognition\n\nThe series has not only achieved commercial success but also garnered critical acclaim. It secured the top spot on Entertainment Weekly's The Must List and earned a place on the \"Best of 2022\" lineups by respected publications such as Vanity Fair, The Los Angeles Times, Forbes, The Atlantic, Rotten Tomatoes, TV Guide, and Nerdist.\n\nThanks to the unwavering dedication of the show's creators and producers, \"Our Flag Means Death'' earned two prestigious Hollywood professional guild awards: one for \"Best Period and/or Character Hair Styling for a TV Series,\" and another for \"Excellence in Production Design.\" The season also secured a GLAAD Award nomination for \"Outstanding New TV Series'' in recognition of its significant contribution to LGBTQIA+ representation and storytelling. Additionally, it received a highly-regarded Peabody Award nomination, distinguishing itself as one of only 42 finalists from a pool of 1,200 entrants.\n\nThe anticipation for the show's second season has been highlighted in the New York Times' \"44 Shows to Watch This Fall,\" TV Guide's \"The 25 Most Anticipated Shows of the Season,\" Vulture's \"37 TV Shows We Can't Wait to See This Fall,” and Buzzfeed’s “40 TV Shows That Are Premiering And Returning In Fall 2023 That Are Worth Checking Out”.\n\nDiverse Representation & Fan Engagement\n\nIt's not surprising that \"Our Flag Means Death'' has cultivated a devoted fanbase, particularly within the LGBTQIA+ community. The show's genuine, unapologetic, and nuanced exploration of identity, acceptance, and the search for belonging sets it apart from other representations of the queer experience in TV and film. For many, this series represents a watershed moment, potentially marking the first time they feel truly seen, understood, and embraced. This connection with an oft-marginalized audience offers a chance not only to empower a community but also to engage with the economic potential of this market.\n\nIn addition to the explicitly queer storyline, the show’s racial and ethnic diversity in front of and behind the cameras make it a stand-out among shows currently on air. Having reached proportionate racial representation among the main cast, “Our Flag Means Death” features in-depth storylines about People of Color from around the globe with complexity, compassion, and most importantly joy and humor. This includes Taika Waititi’s role as Blackbeard/Edward Teach, contributing to the increase of indigenous people in leading roles.\n\nBeyond its fervent following and inclusive representation, \"Our Flag Means Death '' has become a coveted commodity in the comic con circuit, where conventions are strategically capitalizing on the tremendous demand within LGBTQIA+ spaces. ReedPop, a global producer of some of the world's largest events and conventions, actively promotes \"Our Flag Means Death\" functions, leveraging the show's immense following to create profitable opportunities. The show consistently packs panels, and sells out photo ops and signings at premier events like MCM Comic Con, Florida Supercon, Emerald City Comic Con, and New York Comic Con; additionally, these conventions offer premium paid online access for those who cannot attend events in person. Fans have gone a step further by organizing their own gatherings at San Diego Comic-Con and even launching a dedicated convention, \"Our Con Means Death.\" All proceeds from this convention are channeled towards supporting LGBTQIA+ charitable initiatives.\n\nWithin 24-hours of Max releasing the Season 2 teaser, it had gained 1.8 million views, 22,000 engagements, and was actively trending on X/Twitter. On YouTube, the full trailer garnered 23,000 likes, 306,000 views, and featured as #23 on YouTube Top Trending, where the platform shares popular and currently trending topics from around the world. Our Flag Means Death currently holds the #3 spot on Google’s “most searched romcom shows on streaming,” and continues to have higher demand than 99.6% of all comedy titles in the United States.\n\nEven without new episodes for the last 18 months, \"Our Flag Means Death\" has an impressive 24.2 times more audience demand than the average US TV series in the past month of September. This rarity, seen in only 2.7% of all shows, strongly hints at a triumphant return for Season 2. Add to that a flawless 100% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes ahead of its October 5th release, and it's clear the show will once again conquer both critics and audiences alike.\n\nShowrunner's Vision for the Future and Conclusion\n\nIn an interview with Polygon, showrunner David Jenkins expressed the need for three seasons to fully explore the story of “Our Flag Means Death”. The show's critical acclaim, commercial success, and dedicated fanbase make a strong case for its renewal.\n\nAs devoted fans of “Our Flag Means Death”, we sincerely request the pick up of the show for a third season and beyond!\n\nSigned,\n\nRENEW AS A CREW\n\nwww.renewasacrew.com"
