        "text": "Our advice? Don't get too attached to any of the characters on La Casa de Papel (a.k.a. Money Heist). Every season of the popular Netflix drama so far has featured a different—but equally dangerous—heist, and not all the characters have come out alive.\n\nMoney Heist's fourth season featured the death of a beloved character—as did its fifth and final season. Nairobi (Alba Flores) and Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó) is hardly the first member of the Professor's crew to perish in the fight for, uh, whatever they're fighting for at this point—piles of cash, anarchy, the right to sing \"Bella Ciao.\" The list, unfortunately, is long.\n\nThough for all its schemes and shootouts, Money Heist has quite a bit of soap opera DNA. It's the kind of show in which characters seemingly die, only to return the next episode. For example, characters like Berlin (Pedro Alonso) rise from the dead thanks to miracles or flashbacks. So, which characters have really died? Which are just coming back in flashes of memory? Here's a list of every character death on the show so far.\n\nTokyo (Úrsula Corberó)\n\nWho is she? Tokyo is the unreliable narrator of this entire enterprise, adding her signature melancholy, dramatic perspective on the show's already high-octane events. The fifth season's mid-season finale explains how Tokyo came to be involved with the Money Heist crew. The Professor and his brother, Berlin, were impressed by Tokyo's skills as a robber. She escaped from the police after a botched heist, during which her lover, Rene, was killed.\n\nWhat happened? For two years, Tokyo had a relatively tranquil life with Rio in Panama, living off their winnings from their last heist. Then, she was roped into another one of the Professor's schemes, this time at the Bank of Spain. Unfortunately, it would prove to be her last. In season 5, the Professor is captured and the heist devolves rapidly. With the army approaching, Tokyo makes the decision to sacrifice herself and let Denver and Manila escape. She says one last goodbye to Rio.\n\nIs she really dead? Yes—which is why Corberó cried while reading the season 5 script. \"I cried. I'm a big crier. I remember that I sent a picture of me weeping to Álex Pina, and I was not so much crying because it was the last plot, but rather because I knew that that was the last script. I had been melancholic for several days, and I thought to myself that this is it, we are closing this cycle,\" she told Collider.\n\nNairobi (Alba Flores)\n\nWho is she? Counterfeit expert and total firebrand, Nairobi was beloved by her fellow crew members and by audiences. She was known for being level-headed, fair, and no-nonsense, a refreshing attitude amid her fiery team. Like all the characters, she harbors a secret about her past: Nairobi's son was taken away from her by child services, and she misses him desperately.\n\nWhat happened? Nairobi suffered a terrible fate in the show's fourth season. In the season 3 finale, Nairobi nearly dies after being shot by police—but is nursed back to health in season 4. Then, she's taken captive by Gandía (José Manuel Poga), the Bank of Spain's head of security and a former hostage who escaped the bank and then returned to get revenge on the crew. Gandía uses Nairobi as a human shield so her fellow crew members won't attack him. Ultimately, he executes Nairobi via a shot to the head.\n\nIs she really dead? Gah, yes. Nairobi's death sets up the fifth season: Her crew members vow to continue to fight in her honor.\n\nGandía (José Manuel Poga)\n\nWho is he? Gandía is the Bank of Spain's head of security. In season 4, he manages to escape thanks to advice from Palermo (Rodrigo de la Serna), a member of the crew who values creating chaos over a successful heist.\n\nWhat happened? In the season 4 finale, Gandía attempts to break free from the crew. Bogotá (Hovik Keuchkerian) ends up knocking Gandia's head on the railing and rendering him unconscious. Around him, the crew chants, \"For Nairboi,\" vowing to get revenge.\n\nIs he really dead? It's unclear whether he was killed or knocked out.\n\nOslo (Roberto García)\n\nWho is he? Oslo and Helsinki, gruff Serbian immigrants, are like two peas in a pod in season 1 of Money Heist. That's what makes their ultimate fate so tragic.\n\nWhat happened? At the end of season 1 of Money Heist, Oslo is hit over the head with a crowbar by the hostages within the Royal Mint of Spain. Officially braindead, Oslo is killed by his good friend, Helsinki, in an act of mercy.\n\nIs he really dead? Indeed, he is.\n\nMoscow (Paco Tous)\n\nWho was he? For Moscow (real name: Agustin Ramos), crime was simply the family business. His son, Denver (Jaime Lorente), is also part of the Money Heist crew. When Money Heist began, Moscow had just served prison time for robbery and was ready to give up the lifestyle–until Denver desperately needed money to pay off a debt.\n\nWhat happened? Moscow was fatally shot by police outside of the Royal Mint of Spain in season 2 of Money Heist.\n\nIs he really dead? Sadly, yes.\n\nBerlin (Pedro Alonso)\n\nWho was he? Andres de Follonosa, a.k.a. Berlin, was the Professor's older brother, and the second-in-command of the heist at the Royal Mint of Spain. Meticulous and elegant, Berlin is a counterpoint to his more introverted brother and is an integral part of Money Heist.\n\nWhat happened? Unbeknownst to his crew, Berlin had a rare degenerative disease and a life expectancy of only about seven months. In the second season, he sacrificed himself to give his crew more time to escape from the National Mint through a tunnel. He was killed by police."
