It also does not include certain investment funds and certain widely held investments which reflect a low risk of self-dealing. For more information see Income Tax Folio S3-F10-C2, Prohibited Investments – RRSPs, RESPs, RRIFs, RDSPs and TFSAs.\n\nQualified donee\n\nQualified donee – the Income Tax Act permits qualified donees to issue tax receipts for donations they receive from individuals or corporations.

Each case will depend upon its own facts. The following criteria will be used to determine if the parties to a transaction are not dealing at arm's length:\n\nwhether there is a common mind that directs the bargaining for the parties to a transaction\n\nwhether the parties to a transaction act in concert without separate interests; (\"acting in concert\" means, for example, that parties act with considerable interdependence on a transaction of common interest)\n\nwhether there is de facto control of one party by the other because of, for example, advantage, authority, or influence\n\nFor more information, see Income Tax Folio S1-F5-C1, Related Persons and Dealing at Arm's Length.\n\nUnused TFSA contribution room\n\nUnused TFSA contribution room – the amount, either positive or negative, at the end of a particular calendar year after 2008, determined by the holder's unused TFSA contribution room at the end of the year preceding the particular year.\n\nPlus:\n\nThe total amount of all withdrawals made from the holder's TFSA in the preceding calendar year, excluding a qualifying transfer or a specified distribution.\n\nThe TFSA dollar limit for the particular year if, at some point in that year, the individual is at least 18 years of age and a resident of Canada. In all other cases, the amount is nil.\n\nMinus:\n\nThe total of all TFSA contributions made by the holder in the particular year excluding a qualifying transfer or an exempt contribution.\n\nWhat is a TFSA\n\nThe TFSA program began in 2009. It is a way for individuals who are 18 years of age or older and who have a valid social insurance number (SIN) to set money aside tax-free throughout their lifetime.\n\nContributions to a TFSA are not deductible for income tax purposes. Any amount contributed as well as any income earned in the account (for example, investment income and capital gains) is generally tax-free, even when it is withdrawn.\n\nAdministrative or other fees in relation to a TFSA and any interest on money borrowed to contribute to a TFSA are not tax-deductible.\n\nTypes of TFSAs\n\nThere are three types of TFSAs that can be offered: a deposit, an annuity contract, and an arrangement in trust.\n\nBanks, insurance companies, credit unions, and trust companies can all issue TFSAs.\n\nFor more information about a certain type of TFSA, contact a TFSA issuer.\n\nWho can open a TFSA\n\nAny individual that is a resident of Canada who has a valid SIN and who is 18 years of age or older is eligible to open a TFSA.\n\nAny individual that is a non-resident of Canada who has a valid SIN and who is 18 years of age or older is also eligible to open a TFSA. However, any contributions made while a non-resident will be subject to a 1% tax for each month the contribution stays in the account. For more information, see “Non-residents of Canada”.\n\nYou cannot open a TFSA or contribute to one until you turn 18. However, when you turn 18, you will be able to contribute up to the full TFSA dollar limit for that year.\n\nExample\n\nJulie turns 18 on May 13, 2024. She will not be able to open and contribute to a TFSA until that date. However, from May 13, 2024, she can open a TFSA and contribute up to the full 2024 TFSA dollar limit.\n\nNote\n\nIn certain provinces and territories, the legal age at which an individual can enter into a contract (which includes opening a TFSA) is 19. In this case, when the individual turns 19 and is able to enter into a contract in that jurisdiction, the TFSA contribution room for the year an individual turns 18 is carried over to the following year.\n\nHow to open a TFSA\n\nYou can have more than one TFSA at any given time, but the total amount you contribute to your TFSAs cannot be more than your available TFSA contribution room for that year.\n\nTo open a TFSA, you must do both of the following:\n\nContact your financial institution, credit union, or insurance company (issuer).\n\nProvide the issuer with your SIN and date of birth so the issuer can register your qualifying arrangement as a TFSA. Your issuer could ask for supporting documents.\n\nNote\n\nIf you do not provide this information or provide incorrect information to your issuer, the registration of your TFSA can be denied. If your TFSA is not registered, any income that is earned will have to be reported on your income tax and benefit return.\n\nSelf-directed TFSA\n\nYou can set up a self-directed TFSA if you prefer to build and manage your own investment portfolio by buying and selling different types of investments. For more information, contact a TFSA issuer.\n\nContributions\n\nYou do not need to have earned income to contribute to a TFSA. The maximum amount that you can contribute to your TFSA is limited by your TFSA contribution room.\n\nAll TFSA contributions made during the year, including the replacement or re-contribution of withdrawals made from a TFSA, will count against your contribution room.\n\nNote\n\nQualifying transfers, exempt contributions and specified distributions are not considered in the calculation of contributio n room.\n\nAt any time in the year, if you contribute more than your available TFSA contribution room you will have to pay a tax equal to 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount in the month, for each month that the excess amount stays in your account. For more information, see Tax payable on excess TFSA amount.\n\nAs the account holder, you are the only person who can do the following with your TFSA:\n\nmake contributions\n\nmake withdrawals\n\ndetermine how funds are invested\n\nYou can give your spouse or common-law partner money so that they can contribute to their own TFSA, and this amount or any earned income from that amount will not be allocated back to you. The total contributions you each make to your own TFSAs cannot be more than your TFSA contribution room. For more information, see TFSA contribution room.\n\nManagement fees related to a TFSA trust and paid by the holder are not considered to be contributions to the TFSA. The payment of investment counsel, transfer, or other fees by a TFSA trust will not result in a distribution (withdrawal) from the TFSA trust.\n\nTFSA contribution room\n\nYour TFSA contribution room is the maximum amount that you can contribute to your TFSA.\n\nOnly contributions made under a valid SIN are accepted as TFSA contributions.\n\nIf you were 18 or older in 2009, your TFSA contribution room grows each year even if you do not file an income tax and benefit return or open a TFSA.\n\nIf you turned 18 after 2009, your TFSA contribution room starts in the year you turned 18 and your TFSA contribution room accumulates every year after that year.\n\nInvestment income earned by, and changes in the value of your TFSA investments will not affect your TFSA contribution room for current or future years.\n\nThe annual TFSA dollar limit for each of the years from 2009 to 2024 are:\n\nAnnual TFSA dollar limit 2009 to 2012 $ 5,000 2013 and 2014 $ 5,500 2015 $10,000 2016 to 2018 $ 5,500 2019 to 2022 $ 6,000 2023 $ 6,500 2024 $ 7,000\n\nThe TFSA annual room limit will be indexed to inflation and rounded to the nearest $500.\n\nExample\n\nBrayden was eager to open his TFSA, but he didn’t turn 18 until December 21, 2022. On January 4, 2023, he opened a TFSA and contributed $12,500 ($6,000 for 2022 plus $6,500 for 2023 – the maximum TFSA dollar limits for those years). On the advice of his broker, he had opened a self‑directed TFSA and invested in stocks that increased in value. By the end of 2023, the value in Brayden’s TFSA had increased to $12,800. Brayden was worried that for 2024, he would only be able to contribute $6,700 (the TFSA dollar limit for 2024 less the $300 increase in value in his TFSA t hrough 2023). Neither the earnings produced in the account nor the increase in its value will reduce the TFSA contribution room in the following year, so Brayden can contribute up to $7,000 in 2024 to his TFSA.\n\nWhere to find your TFSA contribution room information\n\nYour TFSA contribution room information can be found by using one of the following services:\n\nMy Account for Individuals.\n\nMyCRA at Mobile apps – Canada Revenue Agency.\n\nRepresent a Client if you have an authorized representative.\n\nTax Information Phone Service (TIPS) at 1-800-267-6999.\n\nIn addition, if you want to receive a TFSA Room Statement, call us. You can also ask for a TFSA Transaction Summary that shows the information that we received from your TFSA issuer(s) about your contributions and withdrawals.\n\nIf the information that we have about your TFSA transactions is not complete or if you have made contributions to your TFSA this year, use Form RC343, Worksheet – TFSA contribution room, to calculate your TFSA contribution room for the current year. If we have deemed your unused TFSA contribution room to be a specific amount, do not use this form; call us for more information.\n\nYou must keep records about your TFSA transactions to make sure that your contributions do not go over your TFSA contribution room. We will keep track of an individual's contribution room and determine the available TFSA contribution room for each eligible individual based on information provided annually by the TFSA issuers.\n\nHow to authorize a representative\n\nYou can authorize a representative (such as your spouse or common-law partner, tax preparer, or accountant) to get information about your tax matters and give us information on your behalf. We will accept information from and/or provide information to your representative only after we are satisfied that you have authorized us to do so through My Account for Individuals or Representative authorization.\n\nYour authorization will stay in effect until any one of the following situations applies:\n\nit is cancelled by you or your representative\n\nit reaches the expiry date you choose\n\nwe receive notification of your death\n\nYou or your representative can cancel the consent you gave by telephone or in writing.\n\nIf you were the legal representative of a deceased person, see Guide T4011, Preparing Returns for Deceased Persons, to know what documents are required.\n\nLearn more about representatives by going to Representative authorization.\n\nHow to find your online mail\n\nSome Tax-Free Savings Account letters are available for online mail. Once you are registered for online mail, the CRA will send you an email notification when you have new mail to view in your secure online account. Correspondence available through online mail will no longer be printed and mailed through Canada Post. To learn more, go to Email notifications for individuals.\n\nHow to know your TFSA contribution room\n\nThe TFSA contribution room is the total amount of all of the following:\n\nthe TFSA dollar limit of the current year\n\nany unused TFSA contribution room from previous years\n\nany withdrawals made from the TFSA in the previous year\n\nNote\n\nQualifying transfers, exempt contributions and specified distributions are not considered in the calculation of contribution room.\n\nExample\n\nFrom 2014 until the end of 2022, Josh contributed the maximum TFSA dollar limit each year. As a result, his unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2022 was zero.\n\nHis TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2023 was $6,500 (the 2023 TFSA dollar limit).\n\nOn June 15, 2023, Josh made a contribution of $1,000. On October 26, 2023, he withdrew $4,000.\n\nHis unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2023 was $5,500 ($6,500 – $1,000).\n\nJosh calculated his TFSA contribution room for the beginning of 2024 as follows:\n\nTFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2024 TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2023\n\n$ 6,500 Minus: Contributions made in 2023\n\n- $ 1,000 Unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2023\n\n$ 5,500 Plus: Total withdrawals made in 2023\n\n+ $\n\n4,000 Plus: 2024 TFSA dollar limit\n\n+ $ 7,000 TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2024\n\n$ 16,500\n\nThe TFSA contribution room will not accumulate for any year during which the individual is a non-resident of Canada throughout the entire year.\n\nThe TFSA dollar limit is not prorated in the year when an individual meets any one of the following conditions:\n\nturns 18 years of age\n\ndies\n\nbecomes a resident or a non-resident of Canada\n\nHow we receive your TFSA information\n\nBy the last day of February of the following year, all issuers are required to electronically send a TFSA record to us for each individual who has a TFSA.\n\nIf you disagree with any of the information on your TFSA Room Statement, or TFSA Transaction Summary, including dates or amounts of contributions or withdrawals which your TFSA issuer has provided to us, contact your TFSA issuer. If any information initially provided by the issuer about your account is incorrect, the issuer must send us a revised record so that we can update our records.\n\nYou can view your TFSA Transaction Summary online. Go to My Account for Individuals to see all the contributions and withdrawals made to your TFSA.\n\nTypes of permitted investments\n\nGenerally, the types of investments that are permitted in a TFSA are the same as those permitted in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP). These would include the following types:\n\ncash\n\nmutual funds\n\nsecurities listed on a designated stock exchange\n\nguaranteed investment certificates\n\nbonds\n\ncertain shares of small business corporations\n\nLosses incurred within a TFSA investment\n\nDepending on the type of investment held in your TFSA, you could incur a loss in your original investment. Any investment losses within a TFSA are not considered a withdrawal and therefore are not part of your TFSA contribution room.\n\nLosses incurred within a TFSA cannot be claimed as a capital loss on your income tax and benefit return.\n\nExample\n\nAmanda opened a TFSA on March 20, 2024, and invested $5,000 in stocks. During the year the value of her stocks decreased and on December 31, 2024, the FMV of these stocks was reduced to $1,000. As a result, Amanda decided to withdraw the $1,000 left in her investment and close her TFSA.\n\nThe $4,000 loss that Amanda incurred during the year is not considered a \"withdrawal\". The only amount that would be part of her TFSA room calculation is the $1,000 that was withdrawn when she closed her TFSA.\n\nForeign funds\n\nYou can contribute foreign funds to a TFSA. However, your issuer will convert the funds to Canadian dollars using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction when reporting this information to us. The total amount of your contribution, in Canadian dollars, cannot be more than your TFSA contribution room.\n\nIf dividend income from a foreign country is paid to a TFSA, the dividend income could be subject to foreign withholding tax.\n\n\"In kind\" contributions\n\nYou can also make \"in kind\" contributions (for example, securities you hold in a non-registered account) to your TFSA, as long as the property is a qualified investment.\n\nYou will be considered to have disposed of the property at its FMV at the time of the contribution. If the FMV is more than the cost of the property, you will have to report the capital gain on your income tax and benefit return. However, if the cost of the property is more than its FMV, you cannot claim the resulting capital loss. The amount of the contribution to your TFSA will be equal to the FMV of the property.\n\nTransfers from your RRSP\n\nIf you transfer an investment from your RRSP to your TFSA, you will be considered to have withdrawn the investment from the RRSP at its FMV. That amount will be reported as an RRSP withdrawal and must be included in your income in that year. You can claim the tax withheld on the withdrawal at line 43700 of your income tax and benefit return. If the transfer into your TFSA takes place immediately, the same value will be used as the amount of the contribution to the TFSA. If the contribution to the TFSA is deferred, the amount of the contribution will be the FMV of the investment at the time of that contribution.\n\nExcept in certain circumstances, you cannot exchange securities for cash, or other securities of equal value, between your accounts, either between two registered accounts or between a registered and a non-registered account (swap).\n\nWithdrawals from a TFSA\n\nA qualifying transfer from one TFSA to another is not considered to be a withdrawal.\n\nMaking withdrawals\n\nDepending on the type of investment held in your TFSA, you can generally withdraw any amount from the TFSA at any time. Withdrawing funds from your TFSA does not reduce the total amount of contributions you have already made for the year.\n\nWithdrawals, excluding qualifying transfers and specified distributions, made from your TFSA in the year will only be added back to your TFSA contribution room at the beginning of the following year.\n\nExample\n\nFrom 2013 until the end of 2020, Cedric contributed the maximum TFSA dollar amount each year to his TFSA. In 2021, the TFSA dollar limit is $6,000 and Cedric contributes $2,000 for that year. He now has an unused TFSA contribution room of $4,000 calculated as below:\n\nUnused TFSA contribution room available for future years 2021 TFSA dollar limit\n\n$6,000\n\n2021 contributions\n\n– $2,000 Unused TFSA contribution room available for future years = $4,000\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, Cedric does not contribute to his TFSA, but he makes a $500 withdrawal from his account in 2022. Even though he makes this withdrawal in 2022, it will not be added to his TFSA contribution room until 2023.\n\nThe calculation below shows his TFSA contribution room for 2022, 2023, and 2024: 2021 unused TFSA contribution room\n\n$ 4,000 2022 TFSA dollar limit\n\n+ $ 6,000 2022 unused TFSA contribution room available for future years\n\n= $10,000\n\nCedric’s TFSA contribution room for 2023 2022 unused TFSA contribution room\n\n$10,000\n\n2022 withdrawal\n\n+ $ 500 2023 TFSA dollar limit\n\n+ $ 6,500 TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2023 = $17,000\n\nCedric’s TFSA contribution room for 2024 2023 unused TFSA contribution room\n\n$17,000\n\n2024 TFSA dollar limit\n\n+ $ 7,000 TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2024\n\n= $24,000\n\nReplacing withdrawals\n\nIf you decide to replace or re-contribute all or a part of your withdrawals into your TFSA in the same year, you can only do so if you have available TFSA contribution room. If you re-contribute but do not have contribution room, you will have over-contributed to your TFSA in the year. You will be subject to a tax equal to 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount in the month, for each month that the excess amount stays in your account. For more information on withdrawing amounts from your TFSA, contact your TFSA issuer.\n\nExample\n\nSince opening her TFSA in 2009, Jenny has contributed the maximum TFSA dollar limit each year. At the end of 2023, she has no TFSA contribution room left. In 2024, Jenny makes a $7,000 contribution, the TFSA dollar limit for 2024. Later that year, she withdraws $3,000 for a trip. Unfortunately, her plans change and she cannot go. There are choices Jenny could make regarding her TFSA withdrawal as described below.\n\nIf Jenny wishes to re-contribute part or all of the $3,000 she withdrew, she will have to wait until the beginning of 2025 to do so. The $3,000 will be added to her TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2025.\n\nIf she re-contributes any of the withdrawn amount before 2025, she will have an excess amount in her TFSA and will be charged a tax equal to 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount for each month that the excess stays in her account.\n\nNon-residents of Canada\n\nYou may be considered a non-resident for tax purposes if you meet any of the following conditions:\n\nyou normally, customarily, or routinely live in another country and are not considered a resident of Canada\n\nyou do not have residential ties in Canada, and either one of the following situations applies:\n\nyou live outside Canada throughout the tax year\n\nyou stay in Canada for less than 183 days in the tax year\n\nEven if you no longer live in Canada, you may have residential ties in Canada that are enough for you to be considered a factual or deemed resident of Canada. In these cases, the regular rules for opening a TFSA still apply.\n\nResidential ties include:\n\na home in Canada\n\na spouse or common-law partner or dependants in Canada\n\npersonal property in Canada, such as a car or furniture\n\nsocial ties in Canada\n\nOther ties that may be relevant include:\n\nCanadian driver's license\n\nCanadian bank accounts or credit cards\n\nhospitalization and medical insurance coverage from a province or territory of Canada\n\nFor more information on residential ties, see Income Tax Folio: S5-F1-C1, Determining an Individual's Residence Status, or call the International Enquiries for Individuals and Trusts at one of the following numbers:\n\n1-800-959-8281 (from anywhere in Canada and the United States)\n\n613-940-8495 (from outside Canada and the United States)\n\nWe accept collect calls by automated response. You may hear a beep and experience a normal connection delay.\n\nIf you become a non-resident of Canada, or are considered to be a non-resident for income tax purposes:\n\nyou will be allowed to keep your TFSA and you will not be taxed in Canada on any earnings in the account or on withdrawals from it\n\nno TFSA contribution room will accrue for any year throughout which you are a non-resident of Canada\n\nany withdrawals made during the period that you were a non-resident will be added back to your TFSA contribution room in the following year, but will only be available if you re-establish your Canadian residency status for tax purposes\n\nYou can contribute to a TFSA up to the date that you become a non-resident of Canada. The annual TFSA dollar limit is not pro-rated in the year of emigration or immigration.\n\nIf you make a contribution, except for a qualifying transfer or an exempt contribution, while you are a non-resident, you will be subject to a 1% tax for each month the contribution stays in the account. You may also be liable for other taxes. For more information, see Tax payable on non-resident contributions.\n\nImpact on your government benefits and credits\n\nYour federal income-tested benefits and credits such as Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), or Employment Insurance (EI) benefits will not be reduced as a result of the income you earn in your TFSA or the amount you withdraw from your TFSA.\n\nThe income earned in the account or amounts withdrawn from a TFSA will also not affect your eligibility for federal credits, including the Canada child benefit (CCB), the Canada workers benefit (CWB), the goods and services tax/harmonized sales tax (GST/HST) credit, or the age amount. You can withdraw money from the TFSA at any time, for any reason, with no tax consequences, and without affecting your eligibility for federal income-tested benefits and credits.\n\nYou can use My Account for Individuals or the MyBenefits CRA Mobile apps to securely access your benefit information.\n\nExample\n\nDenis is retired. In addition to his pension, he receives OAS and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits. He earns $500 a year in interest income from his TFSA savings. Neither this income nor any TFSA withdrawals will affect any federal income-tested benefits or credits he receives as they do not have to be included on his income tax and benefit return. If he had earned $500 in a regular savings account instead, it would have to be included on his income tax and benefit return and he would have to pay more tax and could have to repay some of his social benefits.\n\nImpact on your income-tested benefits example Denis' income Funds in a\n\nTFSA Funds outside a\n\nTFSA Total pension income $48,250 $48,250 Total CPP benefits $12,017 $12,017 Total OAS benefits $5,933 $5,933 Interest income to be reported on the income tax and benefit return $0 $500 Total income $66,200 $66,700 Fictitious base amount for social benefits repayments $66,250 $66,250 Amount over base amount $0 $450 Multiplied by 15% × 15% × 15% Amount to be included as a social benefit repayment $0 $67.50\n\nQualifying transfers\n\nTransfers between your own TFSAs and those completed upon the breakdown of a marriage or common law partnership are considered qualifying transfers. All qualifying transfers must be completed by a financial institution.\n\nTransfers between your own TFSAs\n\nIf you want to transfer funds from one TFSA to another or from one issuer to another, there will be no tax consequences if your issuer completes a direct transfer on your behalf. For more information, contact your issuer.\n\nNotes\n\nIf you withdraw the funds yourself and contribute the same funds to another TFSA, this transaction would not be considered a direct transfer and could have tax consequences.\n\nIn this situation, the funds will be treated as a regular contribution which will reduce your TFSA contribution room for the year. If you do not have sufficient contribution room, you will have over-contributed to your TFSA and will be subject to a 1% tax on the highest excess TFSA amount in the month, for each month that the excess stays in the account.\n\nExample\n\nOn May 5, 2024, Michel contributed $7,000 to his TFSA in Bank \"A\" leaving him with a remaining TFSA contribution room of zero.\n\nIn July, he received his TFSA statement from Bank \"A\" which showed there was only a minimal growth ($25) from his investment. Michel decided to talk to other financial institutions to see if they could offer a better rate of return for his TFSA investment. Michel found a better rate offered at another financial institution and decided to transfer the funds from his TFSA account to Bank \"B\".\n\nFor Michel's TFSA contributions to be considered a qualifying transfer, with no tax consequences, Bank \"A\" must complete a direct transfer of funds to Bank \"B\".\n\nIf, instead, Michel went into Bank \"A\" in July, and withdrew the amount in his TFSA and walked into Bank \"B\" to open a new TFSA with a contribution of $7,025, the contribution would be treated as an ordinary contribution and because his unused TFSA contribution room was already zero, he would have an excess TFSA amount of $7,025 and would have to pay a 1% per month tax on the excess TFSA amount for as long as the excess TFSA amount remained in his account. The withdrawal from Bank \"A\" would be added back to his contribution room at the beginning of 2025.\n\nIn addition, if Michel left his contribution to Bank \"B\" in his TFSA for the rest of the year, his tax would be calculated as follows:\n\nhighest excess TFSA amount per month from July to December was $7,025\n\ntax of 1% per month on the highest excess TFSA amount is $421.50 ($7,025 × 1% × 6 months)\n\nTransfers upon breakdown of marriage or common-law partnership\n\nWhen there is a breakdown in a marriage or common-law partnership, an amount can be transferred directly from one individual's TFSA to the other's TFSA without affecting either individual's contribution room. The transfer must be completed directly between the TFSAs by the issuer.\n\nIf you are in this situation, you must meet both of the following conditions:\n\nyou and your current or former spouse or common-law partner were living separate and apart at the time of the transfer\n\nyou are entitled to receive, or required to pay, the amount under a decree, order, or judgement of a competent tribunal, or under a written separation agreement to settle rights arising out of your relationship on or after the breakdown of your relationship\n\nWhen these conditions are met, the transfer is a qualifying transfer and will not reduce the recipient's eligible TFSA contribution room. Since this transfer is not considered a withdrawal, the transferred amount will not be added back to the transferor's contribution room at the beginning of the following year.\n\nAlso, the transfer will not remove any excess TFSA amount, if applicable, in the payer's TFSA.\n\nNote\n\nIf, instead of choosing to have the amount directly transferred, an individual chooses to receive the settlement amount before deciding to contribute part or all of it to their own TFSA, then any such contribution is considered as a regular contribution that reduces the balance of their TFSA contribution room.\n\nDeath of a TFSA holder\n\nAfter the holder of a TFSA dies, possible tax implications can vary depending on one or more of the following factors:\n\nthe type of TFSA\n\nthe type of beneficiary(ies)\n\nwhether any income was earned after the date of death\n\nhow long, after the date of death, before amounts are distributed to beneficiaries\n\nDepending on the factors that apply, the following can be affected:\n\nwhether the deceased's TFSA continues to exist or is considered to have ceased\n\nhow income earned after the date of death can be reported and taxed\n\nwhether a beneficiary can contribute amounts received to their own TFSA, within certain limits, and whether such a contribution would affect their unused TFSA contribution room\n\nTypes of beneficiaries\n\nThe types of beneficiaries for TFSA purposes are:\n\na survivor who has been designated as a successor holder\n\ndesignated beneficiaries (for example, a survivor who has not been named as a successor holder), former spouses or common-law partners, children, and qualified donees\n\nDetermining the type of beneficiary is the first important step. The type of beneficiary can be affected by:\n\ndesignations which could have been made in the deceased holder's TFSA contract\n\nthe terms of the deceased holder's will, if there is one\n\nprovincial or territorial succession legislation\n\nNote\n\nIf you want to change a prior beneficiary designation, contact your TFSA issuer.\n\nSuccessor holder\n\nIn provinces or territories that recognize a TFSA beneficiary designation, the survivor can be designated as a successor holder in the TFSA contract or in the deceased holder's will.\n\nA survivor can be named in the deceased holder's will as a successor holder to a TFSA, if the terms of the will state that the successor holder receives all of the holder's rights including the unconditional right to revoke any beneficiary designation, or similar direction imposed by the deceased holder under the arrangement or relating to property held in connection with the arrangement.\n\nIf named as the successor holder, the survivor will become the new holder of the TFSA immediately upon the death of the original holder.\n\nExample\n\nGinette and her husband Paul lived in a province that recognizes a TFSA beneficiary designation. Ginette was the holder of a TFSA and designated Paul as the successor holder. Ginette died on February 15, 2024. The value of her TFSA on that date was $10,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in her account. Her estate was finally settled on September 1, 2024. By that time, an additional $200 of income had been earned.\n\nSince Paul met all the conditions, he became the successor holder of Ginette's TFSA as of the date of her death.\n\nThe FMV of $10,000 as of the date of death is not taxable to Paul. The $200 of income earned after the date of death (and any subsequent income earned) is also not taxable to Paul. No T4A slip would be issued and Form RC240, Designation of an Exempt Contribution – Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), is not required in this situation.\n\nThis is because Ginette was a resident, at the time of her death, in a province that recognizes TFSA beneficiary designations.\n\nThis rule applies for all three types of TFSAs: deposit, annuity contract, and trust arrangement.\n\nThe deceased holder is not considered to have received an amount from the TFSA at the time of death if the holder named their survivor as the successor holder of the TFSA. In this situation, the TFSA continues to exist and the successor holder assumes ownership of the TFSA contract and all of its contents. However, where the TFSA contract is a trust arrangement, the trust continues to be the legal owner of the property held in the TFSA.\n\nThe TFSA continues to exist and both its value, at the date of the original holder's death, and any income earned after that date continue to be sheltered from tax under the new successor holder.\n\nExcept in cases where an excess TFSA amount remained in the deceased holder's TFSA at the time of their death, the successor holder's unused TFSA contribution room is unaffected by their having assumed ownership of the deceased holder's account.\n\nThe issuer will notify us of this change in ownership.\n\nThe successor holder, after taking over ownership of the deceased holder's TFSA, can make tax-free withdrawals from that account. The successor holder can also make new contributions to that account, depending on their own unused TFSA contribution room.\n\nIf the successor holder already had their own TFSA, then they would be considered as the holder of two separate accounts. If they wish, they can directly transfer part or all of the value from one to the other (for example, to consolidate accounts). This would be considered as a qualifying transfer and would not affect available TFSA contribution room.\n\nIn certain cases, a survivor, designated as the successor holder of a TFSA, could not have a valid Canadian social insurance number (SIN), which is one of the eligibility requirements for opening a TFSA. If the survivor is a Canadian resident, they should apply to Service Canada to get a valid Canadian SIN.\n\nIf the survivor is a non-resident, they should ask for an individual tax number from the CRA by completing Form T1261, Application for a Canada Revenue Agency Individual Tax Number (ITN) for Non-Residents.\n\nExcess TFSA amount at the time of death\n\nIf, at the time of death, there is an excess TFSA amount in the deceased holder's TFSA, a tax of 1% per-month applies to the deceased holder on the highest excess TFSA amount for each month in which the excess stays in the TFSA, up to and including the month of death. The legal representative must file Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts, for that period.\n\nAlso, the successor holder is deemed to have made, at the beginning of the month following the date of death, a contribution to their TFSA equal to the amount by which the excess TFSA amount is more than the total FMV, at the date of the holder's death, of all property under any arrangements that ceased to be a TFSA because of the holder's death. If that contribution creates an excess TFSA amount in the successor holder's TFSA, they will be subject to a tax of 1% per month on the highest amount for each month they have an excess contribution.\n\nExample 1\n\nMiriam and Pauline were a married couple. Each had available TFSA contribution room of $7,000 at the beginning of 2024. Miriam initially contributed $7,000 to her TFSA, and Pauline contributed $1,500 to hers. On June 12, 2024, Miriam contributed an additional $2,000 to her TFSA, bringing her total contributions for 2024 to $9,000.\n\nAs Miriam only had contribution room of $7,000 for 2024, she had an excess TFSA amount of $2,000. Miriam passed away on September 18, 2024, and the value of her TFSA on that date was $9,000. Miriam had named Pauline as the successor holder of her TFSA if she dies. As Pauline meets all the conditions to be considered a successor holder, she becomes the holder of the TFSA from September 18, 2024.\n\nSince an excess TFSA amount remained in Miriam’s TFSA at the time of her death, Pauline is deemed to have made, on October 1, 2024, a $2,000 contribution to her TFSA (which is the excess amount in Miriam’s TFSA). As Pauline had only previously contributed $1,500 to her own TFSA, she still had unused TFSA contribution room for 2024 of $5,500. As a result, the $2,000 deemed contribution does not create an excess TFSA amount in her account.\n\nTherefore, there are no tax consequences to Pauline based on this deemed contribution. Her unused contribution room for the rest of 2024 is $3,500. However, the legal representative of Miriam’s estate must file Form RC243, Tax‑Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243‑SCH‑A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts, for the 2024 tax year reporting the excess in Miriam’s TFSA for the period from June up to and including September 2024.\n\nExample 2\n\nFrom the situation above, if Pauline had initially contributed $7,000 to her own TFSA on May 10, 2024, instead of the $1,500 previously noted, the $2,000 deemed contribution on October 1, 2024, would have resulted in total contributions to her TFSA in 2024 of $9,000.\n\nPauline’s TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2024 was $7,000. As a result of the deemed contribution, she would be considered to have an excess TFSA amount of $2,000 ($9,000-$7,000). In this situation, Pauline would be subject to a tax of 1% per month on this excess TFSA amount for as long as it remained in her account.\n\nDesignated beneficiaries\n\nDesignated beneficiaries can include a survivor who has not been named as a successor holder, former spouses or common-law partners, children, a designated subsequent survivor holder who is the new spouse or common-law partner of the successor holder, and qualified donees.\n\nA designated beneficiary will not have to pay tax on payments made out of the TFSA, as long as the total payments do not exceed the FMV of all the property held in the TFSA at the time of the holder's death.\n\nBeneficiaries (other than a survivor) can contribute any of the amounts they receive to their own TFSA as long as they have unused TFSA contribution room available.\n\nA survivor who is a beneficiary has the option to contribute and designate all or a portion of a survivor payment as an exempt contribution to their own TFSA. As long as they meet certain conditions and limits, this transaction will not affect their own unused TFSA contribution room. For more information, see Designation of an exempt contribution by a survivor.\n\nIf, at the time of death, there was an excess TFSA amount in the deceased holder’s TFSA, a tax of 1% per month is payable on the highest excess amount for each month the excess stayed, up to and including the month of death. The legal representative must file Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts.\n\nIf no successor holder or beneficiary is designated in the TFSA contract or will, the TFSA property is directed to the deceased holder's estate and distributed in accordance with the terms of the deceased holder's will.\n\nGeneral rules – Deposit or annuity contract\n\nIf there is no successor holder, the TFSA ceases to exist when the holder of a deposit or an annuity contract under a TFSA dies. The holder is considered to have disposed of the contract or the deposit immediately before the time that the TFSA ceased to exist for an amount equal to the FMV of all the property held in the TFSA at the time of death.\n\nAfter the holder's death, the deposit or annuity contract is considered to be a separate contract and is no longer considered as a TFSA. All earnings that grow after the holder's death will be taxable to the beneficiary.\n\nThe normal rules apply for reporting income or gains accrued after the date of death, depending on the specific characteristics of the deposit or annuity contract. For example, interest earned would be reported on a T5, Statement of Investment Income.\n\nGeneral rules – Arrangement in trust\n\nIf there is no successor holder, a TFSA that is an arrangement in trust is deemed to continue and it stays a non-taxable trust until the end of the exempt period.\n\nAll income earned during the exempt period and paid to the beneficiaries, will be included in their income, while earnings that accrued before death remain exempt. In other words, any amount up to the FMV of the deceased holder's TFSA as of the date of death can be paid to beneficiaries, without them having to report any amount as income. Any amount paid to beneficiaries that represents an increase in the FMV after the date of death is taxable to the beneficiaries and has to be reported by them as income. Such payments will appear in box 134, \"Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount\" in the \"Other information\" section of a T4A, Statement of Pension, Retirement, Annuity, and Other Income.\n\nThe trust has the exempt period within which to distribute both the taxable and non-taxable amounts. The trustee will assign the part of each payment that represents non-taxable FMV at the date of death with the rest being taxable.\n\nPayments of amounts earned above the FMV made by the trust to a non-resident beneficiary, including a non-resident survivor, from a deceased holder's TFSA during the exempt period are reported on an NR4 slip, Statement of Amounts Paid or Credited to Non-Residents of Canada. These payments are subject to non-resident withholding tax.\n\nIf the trust continues to exist beyond the end of the exempt period (for example, not all amounts from the deceased's TFSA have been paid to beneficiaries), it will be taxable from that point forward. It becomes a taxable inter vivos trust with a tax year beginning January 1st of the following calendar year. The trust will be treated as having disposed of and immediately reacquired its property for its FMV at that time. For as long as it continues to exist, the trust would itself be taxable on any undistributed income (including, for its first tax year, any undistributed income or gains during the exempt period) and required to annually file a T3RET, T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return. The trust will also be required to prepare a T3, Statement of Trust Income Allocations and Designations in that year or later years for any distributions of taxable amounts to beneficiaries.\n\nExample\n\nMartin's mother, who lived in a province that recognizes a TFSA beneficiary designation, passed away on January 9, 2024. The value of her TFSA on that date was $11,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in her account. In her TFSA contract, she had named Martin as the sole beneficiary. Her estate was settled on June 7, 2024. By that time, $200 in additional income had been earned, and the full amount of $11,200 was paid to Martin.\n\nThe value of Martin's late mother's TFSA as of the date of her death—$11,000, is not taxable. The income earned after the date of her death, $200, is taxable to Martin. He will receive a T4A slip showing this amount in box 134 \"Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount\" in the \"Other information\" section. Martin can contribute any of the amounts he receives to his own TFSA as long as he has unused TFSA contribution room available.\n\nDesignation of an exempt contribution by a survivor\n\nIf designated as a beneficiary, the survivor has the option to contribute and designate all or a portion of a survivor payment as an exempt contribution to their own TFSA, without affecting their own unused TFSA contribution room, subject to certain conditions and limits.\n\nBeneficiaries (other than the survivor) who receive a payment from the deceased holder's TFSA cannot contribute and designate any amount as an exempt contribution.\n\nFor the survivor to designate an exempt contribution, the amount must be received and contributed to their TFSA during the rollover period. Also, the survivor must designate their survivor payments as an exempt contribution on Form RC240, Designation of an Exempt Contribution Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), and send the designation within 30 days after the day the contribution is made or at a later time as permitted by the Minister of National Revenue.\n\nThe total exempt contributions designated during the rollover period cannot exceed the FMV of the deceased holder's TFSA at the time of death.\n\nGenerally, if the TFSA of the deceased holder includes an excess TFSA amount at the time of death, if payments are being received by more than one survivor, or if the survivor payment and/or the contribution is made after the rollover period, no amount of the survivor payment can be designated as an exempt contribution. If any of these circumstances are present, call us to find out whether a designation can still be made.\n\nExample\n\nBrian died on February 2, 2024. He was living with his common-law partner, Fred, in Ontario. The value of his trusteed TFSA on that date was $9,000. There was no excess TFSA amount in his account. In Brian's TFSA contract, he had not filled out the part about a successor holder, but he named Fred as the beneficiary. His estate was settled on August 15, 2024. By that time, an additional $150 of income had been earned, and the full amount of $9,150 was paid to Fred.\n\nThe value of Brian's TFSA as of the date of his death, $9,000, is not taxable. The additional income earned after the date of death, $150, is taxable to Fred. His T4A slip will show an amount in box 134 \"Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) taxable amount\" in the \"Other information\" section.\n\nThe amount paid to Fred, as the surviving common-law partner, is considered a survivor payment. Since the survivor payment was made during the rollover period, Fred can rollover up to $9,000 (the value of the TFSA as of the date of death) to his own TFSA, as an exempt contribution.\n\nAn exempt contribution does not affect Fred's unused TFSA contribution room. For the contribution of a survivor payment to be considered an exempt contribution during the rollover period, Fred must designate it on Form RC240, Designation of an Exempt Contribution Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), within 30 days after the contribution is made or at a later time as permitted by the Minister of National Revenue.\n\nDonation to a qualified donee\n\nIf a qualified donee was named as a beneficiary of the deceased holder's TFSA, the transfer of funds to the qualified donee must generally occur within the 36-month period after the holder's death. If necessary, once the donation has been completed, it is possible to ask to have the deceased's income tax and benefits return for the year of death changed to claim the charitable donation tax credit.\n\nManagement fees\n\nManagement fees related to a TFSA trust and paid by the holder are not considered to be contributions to the TFSA. The payment of investment counsel, transfer, or other fees by a TFSA trust will not result in a distribution (withdrawal) from the TFSA trust.\n\nTax payable on TFSAs\n\nGenerally, interest, dividends, or capital gains earned on investments in a TFSA are not taxable—either while held in the account or when withdrawn.\n\nThere are, however, certain circumstances under which one or more taxes could be payable with respect to a TFSA. The following sections provide information and examples of when and how these taxes are payable, and by whom.\n\nNormally, in most TFSA situations, there is no tax payable, and therefore, a TFSA return is not required; however, where one or more of TFSA taxes are payable, a TFSA return must be filled out and sent by June 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the tax arose.\n\nTax payable on excess TFSA amount\n\nYou have an excess TFSA amount at any time in a year as soon as the total of all TFSA contributions you made in the year (other than a qualifying transfer or an exempt contribution) exceeds the total of your TFSA contribution room at the beginning of the year, plus any qualifying portion of a withdrawal made in the year up to that time.\n\nThe qualifying portion of the withdrawal is the amount of the withdrawal or the previously determined excess TFSA amount, whichever is less.\n\nFor more information, see the definition Qualifying portion of a withdrawal.\n\nAny portion of a withdrawal that does not reduce or remove a previously determined excess TFSA amount is not a qualifying portion of the withdrawal and cannot be used to reduce or remove any future excess TFSA amount that can be created. For more information, see examples 1, 2 and 3 that follows.\n\nIf, at any time in a month, you have an excess TFSA amount, you are liable to a tax of 1% on your highest excess TFSA amount in that month. For more information, see example 4 that follows.\n\nNote\n\nIf an excess TFSA amount exists in the account as of the date of death of a TFSA holder and there is a successor holder, see Successor holder.\n\nExample 1\n\nIn 2024, Joelle begins the year with a TFSA contribution room of $7,000.\n\nJoelle's contributions and withdrawals for 2024 are the following amounts:\n\ncontribution on April 25 $3,000\n\ncontribution on May 16 $4,000\n\nwithdrawal on June 15 $2,000\n\ncontribution on August 23 $2,000\n\nwithdrawal on September 8 $1,500\n\nJoelle's first two contributions, in April and May, reduced her TFSA contribution room to zero. Since her June withdrawal does not get added back to her contribution room until the following year, her August contribution caused an excess TFSA amount of $2,000 in that month. Her September withdrawal of $1,500 would be considered a qualifying portion of the withdrawal in computing her highest excess TFSA amount for the following month, October. An excess TFSA amount of $500 stays until the end of the year and she will have to pay a 1% tax for the months of August to December.\n\nJoelle's tax would be calculated as follows:\n\nhighest excess TFSA amount per month for August and September was $2,000. Tax of 1% per month on the highest excess amount is $40 ($2,000 x 1% x 2 months).\n\nhighest excess TFSA amount per month for October to December was $500. Tax of 1% per month on the highest excess amount is $15 ($500 × 1% × 3 months).\n\nJoelle's withdrawals from her TFSA will be added to her TFSA room at the beginning of 2025.\n\nExample 2\n\nSince opening his TFSA in 2013, Gilles, who is 21 years of age and a Canadian resident, contributed the maximum amount he could contribute to his TFSA each year. On March 3, 2024, he contributed an additional $9,000. Since Gilles’ TFSA contribution room at the beginning of 2024 was only $7,000 (the TFSA dollar limit for 2024), his contribution of $9,000 on March 3rd resulted in an excess TFSA amount of $2,000.\n\nOn May 17, 2024, Gilles withdrew $3,700 from his TFSA. The qualifying portion of this withdrawal was $2,000, since this was the maximum amount that eliminated the excess TFSA amount in his account.\n\nNo part of the $1,700 portion of his withdrawal (the full amount of $3,700 less the qualifying portion of $2,000) could have been used in the year to reduce any later excess TFSA amount. In other words, if Gilles had made a new contribution of $1,000 on July 6, 2024, it would still have resulted in an excess TFSA amount of $1,000, as of that date, even though Gilles previously withdrew $1,700 more than his excess TFSA amount on May 17, 2024.\n\nExample 3\n\nFrom the situation above, if Gilles had withdrawn $1,400 on May 17, 2024 (instead of withdrawing $3,700), the qualifying portion of the withdrawal would have been the full $1,400, since the entire amount would have reduced (but not fully remove) his previously determined excess TFSA amount of $2,000.\n\nIn this case, an excess TFSA amount of $600 would remain in his account as of the May 17, 2024 withdrawal (the previously determined excess TFSA amount of $2,000 minus the $1,400 qualifying portion of the withdrawal). If, in this scenario, Gilles had made a new contribution of $1,000 on July 6, 2024, it would result in an excess TFSA amount, as of that date, of $1,600 ($600 + $1,000).\n\nIf, at any time in a month, you have an excess TFSA amount, you are subject to a tax of 1% on your highest excess TFSA amount in that month.\n\nExample 4\n\nJamal is 43 years of age and a Canadian resident. He opened his TFSA in 2009 and made the maximum contributions in each year. In 2023, Jamal made the following transactions during the year:\n\ncontribution on January 6 $5,000\n\ncontribution on March 10 $1,500\n\ncontribution on June 3 $2,700\n\nwithdrawal on October 2 $800\n\nJamal’s contribution room for 2023 was $6,500. The first contribution that created the excess TFSA amount was the $2,700 contribution on June 3rd. As of that date, his total contributions in 2023 were $9,200 ($5,000 + $1,500 + $2,700). This means that as of June 3rd, he had an excess amount in his TFSA of $2,700 ($9,200 of total contributions minus $6,500 of contribution room).\n\nJamal had to pay a tax on his excess contributions. This tax was 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount in each month and applies until Jamal either withdraws the entire excess amount or until he becomes entitled to enough unused TFSA contribution room to absorb the excess.\n\nIn this example, Jamal's tax was $173 for 2023, calculated as follows:\n\nhighest excess TFSA amount per month for January to May was $0. No tax is payable for those months.\n\nhighest excess TFSA amount per month for June to October was $2,700. Tax of 1% per month on the highest excess amount was $135 ($2,700 × 1% × 5 months).\n\nhighest excess TFSA amount per month for November and December was $1,900. Tax of 1% per month on the excess amount was $38 ($1,900 × 1% × 2 months).\n\nAlthough Jamal withdrew $800 in October, the tax was calculated based on the highest excess TFSA amount in each month. The highest excess TFSA amount in October was still $2,700.\n\nFor the months of November and December, Jamal still had an excess TFSA amount, but because of the withdrawal he made, his remaining excess TFSA amount for those last two months was $1,900 (the prior excess amount of $2,700 less the withdrawal of $800).\n\nTherefore, in total for 2023, his tax was $173 ($135 for June to October + $38 for November to December).\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, Jamal's TFSA contribution room was $5,100 which is calculated as follows:\n\nJamal's 2023 and 2024 TFSA limits ($6,500 + $7,000)\n\nless Jamal's contributions in 2023 ($9,200)\n\nplus Jamal's withdrawals from the TFSA in 2023 ($800).\n\nThe tax of 1% per month will continue to apply for each month that the excess TFSA amount stays in the TFSA. It will continue to apply until whichever of the following happens first:\n\nthe entire excess amount is withdrawn for eligible individuals\n\nthe entire excess TFSA amount is absorbed by additions to their unused TFSA contribution room in the following years\n\nExample 5\n\nFrancine is 39 years of age and a Canadian resident. She opened a TFSA in 2009 and contributed the maximum amount allowable for years 2009 to 2021. At the beginning of January 2022, she contributed $6,000. On June 18, 2022, she received a $7,500 bonus from work and decided to contribute the entire amount on June 25, 2022.\n\nAssuming Francine makes no further contributions or withdrawals, she has an excess TFSA amount of $7,500 in 2022 and $1,000 in 2023.\n\nAt the beginning of 2023, there will no longer be an excess contribution in her TFSA. The amount of tax payable for each of those years was calculated as follows:\n\n2022\n\nAfter making $7,500 contribution on June 25, 2022, Francine had an excess TFSA amount of $7,500. The highest excess TFSA amount that remained in her account was $7,500 for every month from June to December. At a rate of 1%, this means she had to pay $525 in tax on her excess for the seven months the excess remains ($7,500 × 1% × 7 months).\n\n2023\n\nFrancine’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2022 was negative (-) $7,500. On January 1, 2023, she became entitled to her 2023 TFSA dollar limit of $6,500. Although this helped to reduce the excess TFSA amount from $7,500 to $1,000, it did not completely absorb it. Francine continued to have an excess TFSA amount of $1,000 in her account through all of 2023. She had to pay a tax of $120 for the year 2023 ($1,000 × 1% × 12 months).\n\n2024\n\nFrancine’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2023 was negative (–) $1,000. As of January 1, 2024, she was entitled to a new TFSA dollar limit of $7,000. This fully removed the excess TFSA amount in her account. Francine had available contribution room of $ 6,000 and, as long as she does not contribute more than this amount to her TFSA through the remainder of 2024, she would not have to pay any tax on an excess TFSA amount for 2024.\n\nFor distributions (withdrawals) occurring after October 16, 2009, a distribution from a TFSA that is a specified distribution cannot reduce or eliminate an individual's excess TFSA amount.\n\nThis tax is similar to the tax of 1% per month on excess RRSP contributions except that in the case of a TFSA, there is no $2,000 \"grace\" amount. The tax of 1% on an excess TFSA amount applies from the first $1 of excess contributions.\n\nThis tax of 1% per month is based on the highest excess TFSA amount in your account for each month in which an excess remains. This means that the 1% tax applies for a particular month even if an excess TFSA amount was contributed and withdrawn later during the same month.\n\nExample 6\n\nRosanna is 31 years of age and a Canadian resident. She opened a TFSA on February 6, 2009, and contributed the maximum amount she could contribute for each year from 2009 to 2023. In February 2024, she contributed $4,500. Later in the year, she received a windfall of $4,600. She forgot that her contribution limit for 2024 was $7,000 and she decided to contribute the entire $4,600 to her TFSA on October 30, 2024.\n\nAfter making this contribution, Rosanna had an excess TFSA amount of $2,100 in her account. This is because her total contributions as of October 30th were $9,100 ($4,500 + $4,600 ) which exceeded her available contribution room of $7,000.\n\nAssuming Rosanna made no further TFSA contributions and no withdrawals during the remainder of 2024, she would have to pay a tax of $63 on her excess TFSA amount. This amount was calculated as 1% of the highest excess TFSA amount per month from October to December ($2,100 × 1% × 3 months = $63).\n\nIf, after making her $4,600 contribution on October 30, 2024, Rosanna had realized her mistake and had withdrawn $2,100 on October 31st, she would still have to pay the 1% tax on the excess TFSA amount of $2,100 but only for the month of October. Her tax payable would have been $21 ($2,100 × 1% × 1 month).\n\nFor any year in which tax is payable by the holder of a TFSA on an excess TFSA amount in their account, it is necessary to fill out and send Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts.\n\nFor contributions made after October 16, 2009, a benefit that is income or a capital gain, that is reasonably attributable to deliberate over contributions will be considered an advantage and treated accordingly. For more information, see Tax payable on an advantage.\n\nTax payable on non-resident contributions\n\nIf, at any time during the year, your TFSA contains contributions (other than a qualifying transfer or an exempt contribution) you made while a non-resident of Canada, you will be subject to a tax of 1% per month on these contributions.\n\nExample 1\n\nGemma is 41 years of age and a Canadian resident. At the start of 2022, her available TFSA contribution room was $6,000.\n\nIn February 2022, she contributed $5,000 into her TFSA and on September 7, 2022, she became a non‑resident. On July 12, 2023, she contributed an additional $2,500 to her TFSA. By the end of 2023, Gemma was still a non‑resident of Canada, and she had not made any withdrawals from her account.\n\nFor 2023, Gemma had to pay a tax on the contribution she made while she was a non‑resident and she was also subject to tax on the excess TFSA amount in her account.\n\nGemma’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2022 was $1,000 (the TFSA dollar limit of $6,000 less her contribution of $5,000). Gemma was not entitled to the TFSA dollar limit of $6,500 for 2023 since she was a non‑resident throughout that entire year. Gemma’s $2,500 contribution on July 12, 2023, resulted in an excess TFSA amount in her account at that time of $1,500. This is the amount by which her contribution exceeded her available room.\n\nGemma’s tax on non‑resident contributions for 2023 was $150 because the full amount of her $2,500 contribution was made while she was a non‑resident and it remained in her account until the end of the year. Since the tax is equal to 1% per month, the tax on her non‑resident contributions was $150 ($2,500 × 1% × the 6 months from July to December 2023).\n\nSince part of Gemma’s contribution while a non‑resident also created an excess TFSA amount ($1,500, as described above) in her account, she also had to pay the 1% tax per month on this amount from July to December 2023. Her tax on her excess TFSA amounts was $90 ($1,500 × 1% × 6 months).\n\nFor 2023, Gemma had to pay a total tax of $240 on her TFSA, made up of $150 in tax on her non‑resident contribution plus $90 in tax on her excess TFSA amount.\n\nGemma will not accumulate any room in 2023 unless she re‑establishes Canadian residency in that year. She will have to withdraw the entire $2,500 she contributed while she was a non‑resident to avoid an additional tax of 1% per month on the non‑resident contributions as well as on the $1,500 excess TFSA amount.\n\nThis tax, calculated on the full amount of the contribution, will apply for each month that any portion of the amount contributed while a non-resident stays in the TFSA and will continue to apply until whichever of the following happens first:\n\nthe contributions are withdrawn in full from the account and designated as a withdrawal of non-resident contributions\n\nthe individual becomes a resident of Canada\n\nAn individual is not subject to the tax of 1% on non-resident contributions for the month in which the full amount of the contribution is withdrawn or, if applicable, the month in which Canadian residency is resumed.\n\nExample 2\n\nHassan is 25 years of age and a resident of Canada. He opened a TFSA in 2021 and contributed the maximum amount he could in 2021 and 2022. His total contributions in 2023 were $1,000, and he made no withdrawals. Hassan became a non‑resident of Canada on February 17, 2024. He contributed $3,000 to his TFSA on August 9, 2024. He re‑established his Canadian residency for tax purposes on December 8, 2024.\n\nHassan’s unused TFSA contribution room at the end of 2023 was $5,500 (the $6,500 limit less the $1,000 he contributed). Hassan also gained an additional $7,000 TFSA dollar limit for 2024. This is because this amount is not pro‑rated in the year an individual becomes a non‑resident, and he was considered a Canadian resident for part of 2024. This means that as of January 1, 2024, Hassan has a total TFSA contribution room of $12,500 (the $5,500 carried over from the end of 2023 plus the annual limit of $7,000 for 2024).\n\nEven though he has unused TFSA contribution room, a tax is payable if any contributions are made while he was a non‑resident. Since he contributed $3,000 while he was a non‑resident, he would have to pay a tax of 1% of this amount for each month from August to November 2024. He is not subject to tax for December as he re‑established Canadian residency in that month.\n\nAccordingly, Hassan had to pay $120 in tax based on his non-resident contribution ($3,000 × 1% × 4 months).\n\nNote\n\nUnlike in the case of excess TFSA contributions where a partial withdrawal can reduce the tax payable, a partial withdrawal of a contribution made while a non-resident does not proportionately reduce the tax otherwise payable. It is necessary for the full amount of a non-resident contribution to be withdrawn in order for the full tax to no longer apply.\n\nFor any year in which tax is payable by the holder of a TFSA on contributions made while a non-resident, it is necessary to fill out and send Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, and Form RC243-SCH-B, Schedule B – Non-Resident Contributions to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).\n\nNote\n\nIn addition to the tax of 1% per month on the contributions made while a non-resident, you could also be subject to a separate tax of 1% per month if any of the same contributions create an excess amount in your TFSA. To determine whether you have excess TFSA amounts, you will need to fill out Form RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts.\n\nTax payable on prohibited investments\n\nIf the TFSA trust acquires a prohibited investment or if previously acquired property becomes prohibited, the investment will be subject to a special tax equal to 50% of the FMV of the investment, and the holder must file Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return.\n\nThe tax is refundable in certain circumstances. For more information, see Refund of taxes paid on non-qualified or prohibited investments.\n\nIf the prohibited investment ceases to be a prohibited investment while it is held by the TFSA trust, the TFSA trust is considered to have disposed of and immediately re-acquired the property at its FMV.\n\nThe holder is also liable for the 100% advantage tax on income earned and capital gains realized on prohibited investments.\n\nThe 100% advantage tax applies to income earned, and the portion of any realized capital gain that accrued, regardless of when the prohibited investment generating the income or gain was acquired.\n\nNote\n\nIf an investment is both a non-qualified investment and a prohibited investment, it is treated as a prohibited investment only.\n\nFor more information, see Income Tax Folio S3-F10-C2, Prohibited Investments – RRSPs, RESPs, RRIFs, RDSPs and TFSAs.\n\nTax payable on non-qualified investments\n\nIf the TFSA trust acquired a non-qualified investment, or if a previously acquired property becomes a non-qualified investment, the investment will be subject to a special tax. The tax is equal to 50% of the FMV of the property at the time that it was acquired or that it became non-qualified, and the holder must file Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return.\n\nThe tax payable on non-qualified investments is refundable in certain circumstances. For more information, see Refund of taxes paid on non-qualified or prohibited investments.\n\nEach person who is a holder is also liable for the 100% advantage tax on specified non-qualified investment income if this income is not withdrawn promptly.\n\nNote\n\nDo not report any increase in the value of a non-qualified investment at the time of disposition on the RC339 return.\n\nIncome earned and capital gains realized by a TFSA trust on non-qualified investments will continue to be taxable to the trust, regardless of when the investment was acquired. If an investment is both a non-qualified and a prohibited investment, it is treated as a prohibited investment only and the trust is not subject to tax on the investment earnings.\n\nFor more information, see Income Tax Folio S3-F10-C1, Qualified Investments – RRSPs, RESPs, RRIFs, RDSPs and TFSAs.\n\nRefund of taxes paid on non-qualified or prohibited investments\n\nYou could be entitled to a refund of the 50% tax on non-qualified or prohibited investments if the investment was disposed of, or ceased to be a non-qualified or prohibited investment, before the end of the calendar year after the year in which the tax arose (or such later time as is permitted by the Minister of National Revenue).\n\nHowever, no refund will be issued if it is reasonable to expect that the holder knew, or should have known, that the investment was or would become a non-qualified or a prohibited investment.\n\nThe refund applies to the 50% tax on non-qualified or prohibited investments but not to the 100% tax on advantages.\n\nNote\n\nIf the 50% tax on non-qualified or prohibited investments and the entitlement to the refund of that tax arose in the same calendar year, then a remittance of the tax is not required. For example, no remittance of tax would be required if a TFSA trust acquired and disposed of a non-qualified investment in the same calendar year.\n\nHow to claim a refund\n\nTo claim a refund, you must:\n\nsend your request in writing (you can attach it to Form RC243)\n\nattach the appropriate documents detailing the information relating to the acquisition and disposition of the non-qualified or prohibited property (you can attach the written request and supporting documents to Form RC243)\n\nThe documents must contain the following:\n\nname and description of the property\n\nnumber of shares or units\n\ndate the property was acquired or became non‑qualified or prohibited property\n\ndate of the disposition or the date that the property became qualified or ceased to be prohibited\n\nIf the disposition took place in the same year as the acquisition, enter the refundable amount on the line in Section 2 of the TFSA return, and attach the documents to your return. If the property disposed of was acquired in a previous year, send your request and the documents to:\n\nTFSA Processing Unit\n\nCanada Revenue Agency\n\nSudbury Tax Centre\n\nPost Office Box 20000, Station A\n\nSudbury ON P3A 5C1\n\nOr\n\nTFSA Processing Unit\n\nCanada Revenue Agency\n\nWinnipeg Tax Centre\n\nPost Office Box 14000, Station Main\n\nWinnipeg MB R3C 3M2\n\nObligations of the TFSA issuer\n\nThe issuer of a TFSA must exercise the care, diligence and skill of a reasonable prudent person to minimize the possibility that a trust governed by the arrangement holds a non-qualified investment.\n\nIf the issuer fails to comply with this obligation, the issuer is liable to a penalty under the Income Tax Act (ITA).\n\nThe issuer is also required to notify the holder of the TFSA in prescribed Form and manner before March of a calendar year, if at any time in the preceding year the TFSA trust acquired or disposed of a non-qualified investment, or if an investment became or ceased to be a non-qualified investment.\n\nTax payable on an advantage\n\nIf the holder or a person not dealing at arm’s length with the holder (including the TFSA itself) was provided with an advantage in relation to their TFSA during the year, a 100% tax is payable which is:\n\nin the case of a benefit, the FMV of the benefit\n\nin the case of a loan or a debt, the amount of the loan or debt\n\nTo calculate the taxes payable on an advantage, you must complete Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return.\n\nNote\n\nWhen an advantage is extended by the issuer of a TFSA, the issuer, and not the holder, is liable for the tax. The issuer must file Form RC298, Advantage Tax Return for RRSP, TFSA, FHSA or RDSP Issuers, RESP promoters or RRIF Carriers.\n\nFor more information, see Income Tax Folio S3-F10-C3, Advantages – RRSPs, RESPs, RRIFs RDSPs, and TFSAs.\n\nTFSA payment of taxes\n\nMost TFSA holders have no tax payable related to their TFSA investments, and no TFSA tax return has to be filed. However, when TFSA taxes are applicable for a year, Form RC243, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return, must be filed by June 30, of the following year. Any tax owing must also be paid by that date.\n\nForm RC243-SCH-A, Schedule A – Excess TFSA Amounts, and Form RC243-SCH-B, Schedule B – Non-Resident Contributions to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), will assist you in determining your tax liability.\n\nIf a TFSA return is required but has not been filed, we can use information provided by your issuers to calculate any tax payable by you.\n\nYou can view filed TFSA returns and schedules online at My Account for Individuals.\n\nExcess TFSA amount correspondence explained\n\nThe CRA can send out a letter or a proposed TFSA return to Canadians who, under certain situations, may have over contributed to their TFSA. You can also receive a proposed TFSA return if you made contributions to your TFSA while you were not a resident of Canada.\n\nExcess TFSA amount letter\n\nIf you receive an excess TFSA amount letter and you have already removed the excess TFSA amount, you do not have to do anything else. If you have not removed the excess, it should be removed immediately. For information on your current year room limit, go to My Account (for your room limit as of January 1) or complete Form RC343, Worksheet – TFSA contribution, if you have contributed to your TFSA in the current year.\n\nThe proposed TFSA return package\n\nThe proposed TFSA return package normally includes the following:\n\nCover letter – It provides general information about TFSA rules and instructions regarding what you need to do to respond to the proposed return.\n\nRC243-P, Proposed Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Return – This proposed TFSA return shows the taxes we have calculated and is based on the information we received from your issuers.
