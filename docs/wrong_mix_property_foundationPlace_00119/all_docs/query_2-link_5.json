        "text": "Actually, since Season 2, I’m kind of expecting him to die by sacrificing himself as his proof to never give up ‘til the end. Well, I don’t know about Law in South Korea. What I get from Western Procedural Series I like to watch, sometimes, killing the bad guy is necessary, didn’t OCN air Western Procedural Series, too? I’m okay if Do Kang Woo killed his evil brother, it does not automatically make him an equal evil as Kaneki too although Kaneki thanked him to murder his own brother. In moral alignment chart, I can see he is Neutral character, not really a Good one as Kang Kwon Joo nor an Evil one like all villains here. Neutral can be a dangerous alignment when it represents apathy, indifference, and a lack of conviction but Do Kang Woo didn’t represent those. I accept that his life is tragic, even more tragic because we got a hope that his mental disorder could be cured abroad but fate took him away, that he was about to save Kang Kwonjoo from being cut by Kaneki but The SWAT Team didn’t view it that way as they just arrived. They could’ve made the SWAT team arrive during the scene when Kaneki is the one who strangle him and perhaps work something from there causing both of them being shot. At least, it didn’t sound he give up of his life nor wanna kill himself because he’s kind of letting The SWAT team shoot him by ignoring their alert to make a move. I rethink about the scene that he didn’t mean to lose to his own demon, he already won it as he returned to himself while strangling to kill Kang Kwonjoo. It was him being a neutral human, but it was really a unfortunate timing that The SWAT team just arrived during his action. He even shed a tear when the lasers pointing him in the gif image above!! And if he didn’t kill Kaneki, who guarantee Kaneki wouldn’t escape from prison like Bang Je Soo did as he should have more accomplices? It was sad that only the viewers knowing his intention on strangling Kaneki at the first place while from The Police’s POV, it looks like he was about killing someone. His death is an accident, we can’t blame them not to shoot because Kang Woo looked so dangerous since Agent Park only reported Kang Center being attacked and the situation she’s laying speak it up. Even if Kang Kwon Joo believed that he made a sacrifice, she didn’t witness how he tried to save her as her last moment is she seeing him strangling her to faint. She can’t made a statement to justify his last action and clear his name accurately to perhaps get a proper burial as if he was still a police officer honorably. Double tragic and maybe not everyone get this point.\n\nI prefer the better execution of how he should die i.e the bad guy kill him unexpectedly, or the basement crashes down because Kaneki set a bomb (like he did to Kang Center in S2 final) but he already rescued Kang Center and Detective Park to go outside safely before The SWAT Team come in. I know it’s still tragic, but at least it’s more honorable and heroic. That’s what I ever imagined when I roleplayed him, an opposite ending of how Kang Kwon Joo could survive the bomb in S2 but Do Kang Woo couldn’t in S3 while saving people and die together with the villain. That’s why I was also hoping it’s Bang Je soo who infiltrate the SWAT team and shoot him when I saw the spoiler everywhere that he seems to carry the case of rifle, but I watched the full eps with subtitle and in the epilogue, Bang Je Soo just opened the case after the woman told him. Pfftttt…. My hope is definitely crushed now.\n\nWell, it is still upsetting they made the sacrifice in the form of suicide scene which to me disrespectful to the amazing character who kept fighting and then died for everyone. Or maybe, what the writer had wanted in mind about his sacrificial death since she created Do Kang Woo character wasn’t delivered well by the director and production team that they chose this worst scenario and even cut some meaningful scenes after his death from original script to relieve the viewers’ broken heart such as Kang Kwon Joo mistake someone similar to him after visiting Detective Park in hospital, showing his memorial tree she visited to remember, and showing his smile in the heaven-like scene. It’d be also nice if they filmed a scene about the little girl he has saved in gas leak or the mother wanna thank him in the end or at least has a reaction of his death news, and that was he’s remembered for, a savior, not a murderer. They kinda ruin it. So I hope when they’re filming Season 04, they put all the missing scenes from last season’s final eps to reminisce Kang Woo’s memory, at least in first eps, and that’s how they could redeem themselves. I also would like to see Detective Park visiting his grave with his wife. He’s supposed to be the 2nd person after Kwonjoo who feel very lost as they can’t finally drink together while final eps just showed how cheerful he is recovering in hospital."
