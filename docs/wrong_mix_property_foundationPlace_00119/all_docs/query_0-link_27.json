Daughter Pilkinton, born Bet. 1794 - 1800.\n\nHere is a sneak preview of what I am working on: Tidewater\n\ngenealogists have discovered a documentable naming pattern in early\n\nTidewater Virginia (tidewater is north of the James River in those\n\nthree peninsula's sticking out into the Chesapeake): the first male\n\nis usually named after the husband's father's father and the third\n\nson is usually the father's name. Names are usually Biblical or\n\nsurnames of other people. As far as we know, Nicanor's first son was\n\nWilliam and his third son was Ambrose. In 1704 William Pilkinton was\n\nclaimed as a headright (land for bringing someone over as indentured\n\nservant) by Thomas Tinsley in Essex County, Virginia. I have found\n\nseveral records for this William and know exactly where he lived. In\n\nthe mid-1700's there is an Ambrose Pilkinton born circa 1720 in the\n\nexact same area. In the late 1700's to early 1800's there is a\n\nParmenas in this same area (probably same tract of land). Now, here\n\nis the tricky part: The two names Parmenas and Nicanor are found\n\nonly one time in the protestant Bible. They are BOTH in the same\n\nverse in Acts (6:5). I do not believe this to be mere coincidence.\n\nTake this with the fact that Nicanor had a son William and a son\n\nAmbrose and couple that with the fact that a Larkin Pilkinton,\n\nRevolutionary vet of Virginia stated that he was born in Essex\n\nCounty, Virginia (Nicanor had a son Larkin probably named after this\n\nolder Larkin) and the circumstantial evidence points to Nicanor\n\noriginating from Essex County, perhaps a grandson to William of\n\nEssex and a son to Ambrose and brother to Parmenas. Still, it is\n\njust a theory and I hesitate to offer it at this time. I finally\n\nreceived the paperwork from the Library of Virginia. Like most\n\ngenealogical documents they are somewhat problematic. The first one\n\nis the estate settlement of Ambrose Pilkington (entered in court at\n\nTappahannock 15 Dec 1777 ) who died in Essex County on March 9,\n\n1774. There is no will. There were many purchasers. The only three\n\nPilkingtons named as purchasers were Sarah, Permenus, and 'Icaner'.\n\nThe latter name I have examined in detail and am positive that it is\n\nIcaner. I have to assume that this is Nicanor Pilkinton. Both\n\nPermanus and Nicanor purchased coats while Sarah purchased household\n\nitems such as bed, pans, beans, etc. I can only assume that she is\n\nmost likely Ambrose's wife but of course may be an unmarried\n\ndaughter. There are several other men who purchased items and they\n\nmay be the daughter's husbands. While this is problematic and not\n\nthe clear cut document I was hoping for, I think it lends credence\n\nto Ambrose being Nicanor's and Permanus' father. The Icaner name at\n\nfirst appears to be a capital J followed by an e or c then\n\ndefinitely \"aner\". An examination of the word \"Iron\" written nearby\n\non the same document demonstrated that the writer used the same\n\ncapital J for his I and his J. I examined the name James also on the\n\nsame document and it is definitely different than the Icaner name. I\n\ncan think of no other name that fits except Nicanor.\n\nThe other paper was the will of William Pilkinton of Essex County\n\nproved in court at Tappahannock on 21 Mar 1748. It is short and\n\nnames his \"well beloved wife\" Appalonia, and three unmarried\n\ndaughters : Appalonia, Jane, and Frances. It was proved by two\n\nwitnesses:\n\nIsaac Hawes and Ambrose Pilkinton. I am of the opinion that Isaac\n\nHawes was married to a Pilkinton and that Ambrose was William's son.\n\nAmbrose could of course be this William's brother but the wording\n\ngives me a different feeling. William is \"weak in body\" which may be\n\njust legalistic wording used in every will but William says that his\n\nthree daughters Appalonia, Jane and Frances are to stay on his\n\nplantation as long as they are single and not be \"hurried off\". This\n\nindicates to me that they are probably old enough at the writing of\n\nthe will to be of marriage age. Just speculation of course. If this\n\nis the will of the older William who was born around 1680, then it\n\nindicates a second marriage. The land transactions of William in\n\n1708 name his wife as Ann. Perhaps I will attempt to find some more\n\ninformation in Essex County.\n\nFrom aka Jamess\n\nIf you go to this fantastic website:\n\nhttp://memory.loc.gov/ammem/repehtml/repehome.html\n\nYou can browse religious petitions from the 1700's in all Virginia\n\nCounties. I browsed through two tidewater counties (King And Queen and\n\nCaroline) that were once a part of Essex County and discovered Nicanor\n\nPilkinton's signature (looks like Nicanah Pilkinton). The petition was\n\ndated October 16, 1779 and concerned the parishioners' opposition to\n\ndividing Drysdale Parrish which was in both counties. The Caroline\n\nCounty petition is just a hand written copy of the King And Queen\n\nCounty petition including the exact same names. The copy verifies that\n\nthe name on the first petition is Nicanor (although it mispells the\n\nlast name as Pilkerson). This places Nicanor in the Essex tidewater\n\narea where Ambrose was in the 1750's. I believe this helps confirm\n\nNicanor and Permenus' relationship as well as makes him the likely son\n\nof Ambrose.\n\nI found this in a genealogical publication: \"Tidewater Virginia\n\nFamilies:A Magazine of History and Genealogy\" Volume 11, number 3,\n\npage number 169. Virginia Lee Davis, Publisher:\n\n\"A Day In Court, Essex County May 1774\"\n\nIndictment Against : Nikynor Pilkenton, James Mariner, Jeffery Mariner.\n\nA Grand Jury having found a True Bill against the Defendants, it is\n\nordered that they be summoned to appear at the next Court to answer\n\nthe same and that the King's Attorney prosecute on the said Bill.\"\n\nNo charge is mentioned. I would love to get my hands on the next term\n\ncourt records! It must not be very serious as the Sheriff was not\n\nordered to arrest them. It could be sonething like not attending\n\nchurch. I noticed some other prosecutions for church attendance.\n\nAnyway this pretty much seals up Nicanor being from Essex County in my\n\nmind. It may be why he moved to next county Caroline or to Culpeper.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Ambrose died in march 1774. We might\n\nassume that Nicanor is 21 years old here as that was the legal age\n\nthen, so that might further narrow his birth date down to between 1750\n\nand 1753. Jim\n\n>\n\nYou are both very welcome. I am thrilled to find this information and\n\nhave a lot of fun doing it. Now if I can just prove that the William\n\nPilkinton who immigrated to Essex County circa 1690/1700 was the same\n\none that left Liverpool aboard the Submission for a 5 year endenture.\n\nI have not been able to find any evidence that our William in Essex is\n\nthe same one, but the William that left Liverpool in 1698 was from\n\nBrindle (in the traditional Pilkington Lancashire area)according to\n\nthe ship's manifest and at least one published book lists his parents.\n\nThat would take use across the pond so to speak.The problem is,\n\nbelieve it or not, that at least three William Pilkinton's apparently\n\nimmigrated at around 1700 to three different areas of Virginia:\n\nHenrico, Nansemond, and Essex. Add to the confusion the fact that (it\n\nis reported)a person who was already in Virginia could sell himself\n\ninto endenture. I am not sure if these latter endentures could be\n\nclaimed for the headrights. Also adding to the confusion is the fact\n\nthat headright claims were sometimes made many many years after the\n\nendenture was over or sold from one person to the other (I originally\n\nthought there were four Williams but discovered that one of them was\n\nclaimed by two men). However, William Pilkington from Brindle left\n\nLiverpool, England (about 20 miles away) in late 1698 (October as I\n\nrecall)endentured for five years and destined for Virginia. His\n\nendenture should have ended in about 1703 or so and if my memory does\n\nnot fail me, Mr. Tinsley claimed the import of William Pilkinton as\n\nwell as many others in Essex County in about 1704. It appears to fit.\n\nI am also tracing down the Isle of Wight/Brunswick/Lunenburg group\n\nthat went to Johnston/Chatham/Wilkes counties in NC, which is quite a\n\nnightmare at present. I have traced down all of the lines in Tennessee\n\nand Alabama back to at least 1800. I started doing this to keep the\n\ndifferent Pilkington clans separated. One day we'll get them all\n\nconnected somehow. I am convinced that our Essex Pilkintons and the\n\nBrunswick ones are separate groups (which connect way back in England\n\nof course), however they appear to meet in Chesterfield County,\n\nVirginia as I know for a fact that the David Pilkinton there in 1800\n\nor so is from the Brunswick line whereas Larkin is from the Essex line\n\n(in his pension application Larkin claims to have been born in Essex\n\nCounty, Virginia). So, it is somewhat difficult to divide them up. I\n\nhave alot of this information in my gedcom at Rootsweb. I will go back\n\nto digging now... Jim\n\nHere is my Pilkington line from Chesterfield and Amelia Counties, VA,\n\nand I've been in touch with James Pilkinton who has done a lot of\n\nresearch on these lines and he thinks mine is somehow connected to his\n\nand yours (Nicanor) from Essex County. My Drura (Drury) was involved\n\nin a land transaction with Micajah Pilkinton in Chesterfield County in\n\n1784 and James tells me Micajah was connected to Nicanor and Ambrose\n\nPilkinton of Essex. I've also included that old land deed for your\n\ninfo. I'd like to stay in touch just in case James is able to come up\n\nwith a definitive link, as all indications currently seem to point to\n\none between mine and his and yours. Thanks very much for responding to\n\nmy query. I just happened to stumble across your email address on one\n\nof the genie sites.\n\nBest,\n\nBill Hatchell\n\ncopy of a deed between Micajah and Drury Pilkinton (sic).

They were members of a group of\n\nmen called \"Sardis Volunteers\". Most members of the Volunteers were\n\nfrom Georgia, however there were some from other states.\n\nGeorge and Isaac were enlisted in Colonel John T. Mercer Trimble's\n\nBrigade, Ewell Division, Jackson Corps.\n\nThis company subsequently became (Old) Company E, 21st Regiment, Georgia\n\nInfantry. It was detached from the 21st Regiment, Georgia Infantry, by\n\nS.O. No. 106, A. & I.G.O., dated May 8, 1862, and subsequently became\n\nCompany G, Calvary Battalion, Smith's Georgia Legion. The 21st\n\nRegiment, Georgia Infantry, originally consisted of nine companies and\n\nwas known as the 4th Battalion (Mercer's), Georgia Infantry. Captain J.\n\nB. Akridge's Company, Georgia Volunteers, was attached to the battalion\n\nand with the nine other companies constituted a regiment by S. O. No.\n\n144, dated September 5, 1861.\n\nIsaac spent 1861 in Company G ((Old) Company E), 21st Georgia Infantry,\n\nserving under Captains Hood (June-July) and Hart (November-December),\n\nstationed in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nOn May 21, 1862, the whole of Company G was transferred to the Army of\n\nTennessee and became known as Smith's Legion on July 1, 1862 under the\n\nleadership of Colonel Sumner J. Smith. Smith's Legion was also known as\n\nGeorgia's Partisan Rangers and was made up of both calvary and infantry\n\nbattalions.\n\nIn 1863, Isaac transferred to Company G, 6th Georgia Calvary, Iverson's\n\nBrigade, Martin's Division, Wheeler's Corp, commanded by Lieutenant\n\nColonel John R. Hart and Major Benjamin F. Brown. In Company G at this\n\ntime was Isaac's brother George.\n\nWhile serving in the War, George participated in many battles, most\n\nprobably those conducted at the Battle of Seven Pines, Virginia, in\n\n1862; the Seven Days Battle, the Battle of South Mountain, Antietam and\n\nChancellorsville.\n\nIn the spring of 1863, the 23rd left Virginia for North Carolina and\n\nthen posted to Charleston, South Carolina, where it performed duty at\n\nBattery Wagner, Johns Island and Fort Sumter. The 23rd then moved south\n\nto Florida and participated in the Battle of Olustee.\n\nAfter the Battle of Olustee, the 23rd returned to South Carolina and was\n\nthen posted to Virginia in the spring of 1864 where it fought at\n\nDrewery's Bluff, Cold Harbor and Petersburg.\n\nOn the afternoon of November 10, 1864, the 23rd, under the command of\n\nGeneral Wheeler, attacked a encamped contingent of the Union Army at\n\nFrankin, Tennessee. This attack came to be known as the Battle of\n\nFranklin, Tennessee. The Battle of Franklin, Tennessee, came to be\n\nrecoginized as one of the pivotal battles that hastened the end of the\n\nwar. The losses incurred by the 23rd and the Union forces during the\n\nBattle of Franklin rendered both forces almost completely ineffective as\n\nfighting units. Several weeks later the 23rd was almost annihilated at\n\nthe Battle of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nGeorge was wounded in the Battle of Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nShortly after the Battle of Nashville, General Robert E. Lee, realized\n\nthat the Southern cause was lost and began preparations to end the war.\n\nThe 23rd surrendered to Union forces in North Carolina in February, 1865\n\nand were subsequently discharged in April, 1865, at Charleston, South\n\nCarolina.\n\nOn August 10, 1913, George filed a Soldier's Application for Pension for\n\nUse of Soldiers in Indigent Circumstances with the State of Texas. At\n\nthat time George was a resident of the Confederate Home in Austin,\n\nTravis County, Texas. He was granted a monthly pension of $50 on\n\nSeptember 1, 1913. George is buried in the Texas State Cemetery in\n\nAustin, Travis County, Texas in the section reserved for Confederate\n\nveterans. One of George's witnesses testifying on behalf of his pension\n\napplication was his former Captain of Company G, John R. Lay. The\n\nsecond of George's witnesses was Curtis Green who originally enlisted\n\nwith George and Isaac as members of Sardis Volunteers. After the war,\n\nCaptain Lay moved to Saratoga, Hardin County, Texas. Curtis Green had\n\nmoved to Oglesby, Coryell County, Texas.\n\nIssac Pilgrim's second wife, Sarah Emmaline \"Emma\" Powell Pilgrim, filed\n\na Widow's Appliation for Pension at Camp County, Texas, on July 12,\n\n1911. This application was not approved and she subsequently filed a\n\nsecond application and was granted a Veteran's Survivors pension under\n\nPension Number 28792 in the amount of $500 on August 1, 1914.\n\nTestifying for Sarah was G. R. A. Brison who was a recruit of Sardis\n\nVolunteers in 1861. Mr. Brison testified that he personnaly knew Isaac,\n\ncommenting \"I served in the same company and was in the same \"mess\" with\n\nthe said I. T. Pilgrim for two years\". Curtis Green also testified on\n\nEmma's behalf.\n\nWhen Sarah passed away, her casket, dress and burial equipment was\n\nprovided by a firm named Ellis Hardware, Furniture, Gas Stoves,\n\nUndertaker Goods and Farm Implements at Pittsburg, Camp County, Texas.\n\nHer casket cost $200, dress $12.50, hearse $10.00 and equipment $7.50\n\nfor a total of $230 which was paid out of her estate.\n\nBureau of Vital Statistics, Standard Certificate of Death, Place of deat h, Travis County, City of Austin, Confederate, 628259, Full name G.W.

Ragan's book:\n\nA letter from the Office of G. T. Ragan, Neoga, Illinois, dated\n\nSeptember 17, 1889 addressed to Hon. John H. Reagan, United States\n\nSenate.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy brother, S. R. Ragan of Greencastle, Indiana, had some\n\ncorrespondence about a year ago with you in regard to a common origin of\n\nour families. I have accidentally come into possession of a picture of\n\nyours in an old number of Frank Leslie's Magazine. The likeness is\n\nalmost a perfect one of my brother, R. S. Ragan, in every respect and\n\nhis son who left here today verifies my opinion. have you seen the\n\npicture above referred to, and is it a good likeness of yourself? If\n\nthe two families are not of the same stock we cannot explain the\n\ncoincidence.\n\nRecently I saw an article in the Philadelphia Medical Journal\n\ncontributed by J. A. Reagan, M.D. of Weaverville, North Carolina. I\n\nwrote him inquiring as to his antecedents and received a prompt answer.\n\nAnd he seems to be very intelligent man and can tell more about the\n\nfamily than anyone I have found. I will quote from his remarks:\n\n\"I too feel a great interest in knowing more of the Reagan family.\n\n>From the best information I can get, the family was called O'Ragan in\n\nIreland . . . See Irish History. After Cromwell's defeat there were two\n\nbrothers of the Reagan family, or rather O'Ragan family, that came to\n\nthe United States as they were in the rebellion. One of these brothers\n\nsettled in Pennsylvania and the other in Virginia. After the\n\nRevolutionary War . . . they were all true Whigs . . . there were four\n\nof the Reagans who left Virginia: one, my grandfather settled in Green\n\nCounty, Tenn.; one of the brothers settled in Washington County, Tenn.;\n\none in Sevier County, Tenn., from which family Judge Reagan sprung; The\n\nVirginia family dropped the O' as did the Pennsylvania family. And the\n\nyoung ones retained the 'e' and added the 'a', while many of the\n\nPennsylvania families turned the 'e' onto 'a', as they were universally\n\ncalled Ragans as well as the Virginia family. There was another\n\nbrother, a fourth one, as I said the four left Virginia, who settled on\n\nthe Savannah River in Georgia. I know very little of the Pennsylvania\n\nfamily, having never seen any of that family except W. H. Ragan of High\n\nPoint, N.C. I know very little of the Savannah branch ... never saw but\n\none of that family.\n\n\"Any information I can give you I will do at any time. I know that we\n\nall sprang from the two families who settled here many hears before the\n\nRevolution. Am next to my father's youngest child and am 64 years old.\n\nGlad you wrote me; the Reagan blood will tell.\"\n\nI quote this as it seems to be more authentic than anything from any\n\nother source and corresponds with what you wrote to R. S. Ragan. Pardon\n\nme for taking so much of your time, but the matter was brought up by\n\nmeeting my nephew from Greencastle yesterday, and I thought I would ask\n\nyou for a photograph of yourself, and as some compensation I mail one of\n\nmyself.\n\nMost respectfully,\n\nG. T. Reagan\n\nI will try to submit other information from Mrs. Ragan's book as I have\n\ntime that is not of a very personal nature.\n\nI will also share some of the other data received from Mrs. Ragan sent\n\nto me in a letter dated August 11, 1977, as I have time.

T he entire hospital of 1000 beds under canvas was set up for operation duri ng a two week period last November. More than 600 patients were receiv ed up until midnight on the first day of operation.\n\nIn the second month of the hospital's operation the Germans smashed throu gh Allied lines in their last big effort of the war and the 298th met i ts suprise test as patients poured in from the \"Battle of the Bulge\" eve ry minute of the day while the nights were made harrowing by the continueu al rain of buzz bombs. Although some 3000 V-1 bombs fell in the Liege ar ea during the siege, many of those exploding near the hospital, the 298 th lost only one man during these attacks.\n\nThe hospital's facilities were taxed to the limit at times when direct hi ts by buzz bombs temporarily put other hospitals in the area out of operat ion. During one period all water had to be hauled to the hospital d ue to a bomb hit on a water main.\n\nIn early spring when the bomb attacks ceased an air evacuation operation w as begun at the hospital air strip and in this way several hundred patien ts were evacuated every day for three months.\n\nAlthough the personnel of the 298th General Hospital are grateful for t he peaceful routine of operations in the Liege today they can look back wi th pride to their accomplishments during the days when Liege was one of t he most buzz bombed cities in the world.\n\nMembers of the Unit are:\n\nMissouri\n\nHuntsville: Lt.
