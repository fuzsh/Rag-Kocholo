        "text": "WILTON, Iowa â A major steel company is investigating after the death of a contractor in Wilton, Iowa.\n\nEric Connor, 29, was taken to the Trinity Rock Island Saturday while working at the Gerdau Wilton Ameristeel mill.\n\nHe died the next day.\n\nWe obtained a photo of him with his wife and three kids from Connorâs father. He says Connor was an âamazing young man, the son every father dreams of having.â\n\nThereâs a lot that investigators arenât releasing right now. We donât know if an accident happened or if this was a medical emergency. Rock Island County coroner Brian Gustafson says an autopsy was done today, but itâs too soon for a preliminary a cause of death.\n\nLocal 4 News reached out to Gerdau Wilton. Spokesperson Adam Parr sent us this statement:\n\nâGerdau confirms the passing of a contractor employee at the Wilton, IA steel mill. The individual was hospitalized on Saturday, June 15th, and passed away shortly thereafter. We are currently in the process of investigating, and will supply additional details when we are able.\n\nWe wish to extend our deepest condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of the deceased.â\n\nAdam Parr, Gerdau spokesperson\n\nLocal 4 News is still waiting for a response from a union representative about the investigation.\n\nPast incidents\n\nLocal 4 News investigated and found the mill has a history of workplace accidents.\n\nAn explosion two years ago injured two employees. Federal documents show both of them were burned.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration conducted two inspections this year and both were based on referrals from other organizations.\n\nInspectors were at the plant six days before Connorâs death.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaKqtnZWheqS7zKmYp7Fdnru3sdKtoKCZpJrAbq3FrZyrZZOku7W%2BwJyrqKqjYrGmrdOhZg%3D%3D"
