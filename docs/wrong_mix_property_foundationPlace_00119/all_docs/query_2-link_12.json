        "text": "Suicide is a national public health concern. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.1 Recent research indicates that suicide is at a 30-year high.2 In addition, other reports conclude that the suicide rate is rising sharply for males aged 45 to 64 (from 20.8 to 29.7 deaths per 100,000 between 1999 and 2014) and females aged 45 to 64 had the second-largest percentage increase in suicide deaths (from 6.0 to 9.8 deaths per 100,000 between 1999 and 2014) among all age groups by gender. 3,4 Â\n\nTo present a complete picture of suicidal behavior and outcomes, this issue of The CBHSQ Report uses data from two federal sources: the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)Â Mortality data file from NCHS. This report focuses on adults aged 45 to 64 because of the increase in the suicide death rateÂ for this age group.Â\n\nThe Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) within SAMHSA collects, analyzes, and disseminates NSDUH data on mental health and substance use. NSDUH is a nationally representative household survey of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population aged 12 or older. In 2009 to 2014, the number of completed interviews was 410,000, with 280,100 of those completed interviews from people aged 18 or older. NSDUH respondents aged 18 or older were asked if at any time during the past 12 months they had thought seriously about trying to kill themselves. Those who had serious thoughts of suicide were then asked whether they made a plan to kill themselves or tried to kill themselves in the past 12 months.\n\nThis report examines NSDUH and NVSS mortality data using the same time frame (2009 to 2014) as a recent NCHS publication (NCHS's Data Brief No. 241).4Â To improve statistical power for trend analysis, 2-year annual averages were used for both data files. The NVSS data were analyzed using the online Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS).\n\nAll NSDUH estimates (e.g., percentages, numbers) presented in this report are subject to sampling errors. NSDUH estimates that do not meet criteria for reliability have been suppressed and are not shown.6Â NVSS data do not have associated sampling errors because the data come from a census and are not from a random sample.\n\nTrend analyses in this report focus on percentages because the percentages take into account any changes in the size of the total population and facilitate the comparison of estimates across years.7 Statistical tests also have been conducted for comparisons that appear in the text of this report. Statistically significant differences are described using terms such as \"higher,\" \"lower,\" \"increased,\" or \"decreased.\" Statements use terms such as \"similar,\" \"remained steady,\" or \"stable\" when a difference is not statistically significant. Statistical tests, though, were not performed comparing NSDUH estimates withÂ NVSS rates. Also, suicide death rates for 1999 versus 2014 were not tested; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested only time differences for separate genders. Supporting NSDUH (including standard errors) and NVSS tables are included at the end of this report (Tables S1âS12).8\n\nAge Group Comparisons\n\nThe combined 2009 to 2014 NSDUH data indicate that young adults aged 18 to 25 areÂ at highest risk for suicidal thoughts. As Figure 1 shows, those aged 18 to 25 had a higher percentage of suicidal thoughts (6.9 percent) than other age groups (ranging from 4.6 to 1.6 percent). Overall, 3.5 percent of middle-aged adults had suicidal thoughts in the past year, ranging from 2.5 percent among those aged 60 to 64 to 4.2 percent among those aged 45 to 49. This pattern persisted for males and females.\n\nWhen the analyses were conducted by gender, young adults aged 18 to 25 had the highest percentages of suicidal thoughts compared with other age groups by gender (Figures 2 and 3).\n\nÂ\n\nTrends\n\nWhen examined over time, there does not appear to be an increase in suicidal thoughts among adults aged 45 to 64; the trend ranged from 3.3 to 3.6 percent (Figure 4). The percentage of males aged 45 to 64 who had suicidal thoughts remained stable atÂ 3.5 percent in 2009 to 2010, 3.1 percent in 2011 to 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013 to 2014. Females aged 45 to 64 also had a stable percentage of suicidal thoughts atÂ 3.6 percent in 2009 to 2010, 3.5 percent in 2011 to 2012 and 3.3 percent in 2013 to 2014.Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nAge Group Comparisons\n\nThe annual average percentage of nonfatal suicide attempts for young adults from 2009 to 2014 was 1.2 percent and was higher thanÂ percentages of other age groups (which ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 percent; Figure 5). Therefore, young adults aged 18 to 25 are likely at most risk for suicide attempt, although people aged 45 to 64 are more likely to die from a suicide attempt.4 There was no gender difference in percentages of attempts for middle-aged adults.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nTrends\n\nFor the 45 to 64 age groups, there was no significant increase in suicide attempt over time across the 2-year groupings: 0.3 percent for 2009 to 2010, 0.4 percent for 2011 to 2012, and 0.3 percent for 2013 to 2014 (Figure 6). Additionally, the data on suicide attempt by males and females aged 45 to 64 showed no significant differences over time in the past 6 years. For males aged 45 to 64, the percentage attempting suicide in the past year remained stable at 0.4 percent in 2009 to 2010, 0.3 percent in 2011 to 2012 and 0.3 percent in 2013 to 2014. The percentage of females aged 45 to 64 attempting suicide in the past year was also stable at 0.3 percent annual average in 2009 to 2010 and 0.4 percent annual average in both 2011 to 2012 and 2013 to 2014.Â\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nAge Group Comparisons for 1999 and 2014\n\nAccording to NVSS data, the suicide rate for 1999 ranged from 1.2 deaths per 100,000 for 10- to 14-year-olds to 18.4Â per 100,000Â for adults aged 75 or older (Figure 7). For 2014, the suicide rate ranged from 2.1 deaths per 100,000 for 10- to 14-year-olds to 19.5 per 100,000 for adults aged 45 to 64. The largest increase between 1999 and 2014 suicide rates was 6.3 percentage points (or a 48 percent increase) for 45- to 64-year-olds; other groups had only 0.3 to 2.2 percentage point differences over time.9\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nMales in the 45 to 64 and 75 or older age groups had significantly higher suicide death rates than males in the other age groups (but the age group of males 45 to 64 and 75 or older were not significantly different from each other; Figure 8). However, NCHS noted that the \"largest percent increase (43 percent) in rates\" between 1999 and 2014 was from the 45- to 64-year-old male age group.4 For females in 2014, the fatal suicide rate was higherÂ for those aged 45 to 64 than for other age groups (Figure 9).\n\nTwo-Year Trends\n\nAnalyses were also performed for combined data from 2 years at three timesÂ (as done for the NSDUH data previously discussed): 2009 to 2010, 2011 to 2012, and 2013 to 2014. Figures 10 and 11 show the 2-year NVSS data10 for 2009 to 2014. For males aged 45 to 64, the fatal suicide rates were 28.6 in 2009 to 2010, 29.2 in 2011 to 2012 and 29.4 in 2013 to 2014. Females showed the same trend in fatal suicide rates: 8.5 in 2009 to 2010, 9.0 in 2011 to 2012 and 9.6 in 2013 to 2014.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â\n\nYoung adults aged 18 to 25 are at higher risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts than other age groups. However, adults aged 45 to 64 have higher rates of death from suicides than other age groups. Additionally, the suicide rate (i.e., the death rate from suicide) has significantly increased over the years for those aged 45 to 64, higher than any other age group. This increase is seen for both male and female adults aged 45 to 64. The percentage of adults aged 45 to 64 who had serious thoughts of suicide and attempted suicide remained stable from 2009 to 2014. Additional research is needed to examine why there is this incongruity between risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts and death rates for suicide among middle aged persons.\n\nResearch suggests that there are more attempted suicides than there are deaths from suicide.1,11Â Out of every 31 adults who attempted suicide in the past 12 months in the United States, there was 1 death by suicide.12Â In addition, people are likely to have thought about suicide before actually attempting suicide.\n\nDeaths by suicide can be prevented; suicide awareness and interventions are keys to improving this public health issue. SAMHSA's efforts toward suicide prevention can be found at https://www.samhsa.gov/suicide-prevention/, and information on the National Suicide Hotline is at https://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/.Â\n\nBackground:Â Suicide is a public health problem. Method:Â Two federal data sources collect suicide information: the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). This issue of The CBHSQ Report uses 2009 to 2014 NSDUH and NVSS data to examine the trends in suicidal thoughts, attempts, and deaths for males and females aged 45 to 64. Results:Â Middle-aged adults have a significantly lower percentage of suicidal thoughts and attempts compared to the 18Â to 25 year olds, which is the age group with the highest percentages of suicidal thoughts and attempts. In addition to relatively low rates of suicidal thoughts and attempts, the trend for middle-aged suicidal thoughts and attempts has remained stable between 2009 and 2014 even though the death rates for suicide from the age group increased from 1999 to 2014. Conclusion:Â Knowing the differences in risk among the age groups is important for suicide prevention because young adults aged 18 to 25 have the highest rate of suicide attempts, but those aged 45 to 64 are more likely to have fatal suicide attempts.\n\nKeywords: middle-aged adults, National Survey on Drug Use and Health, NSDUH, suicideÂ"
