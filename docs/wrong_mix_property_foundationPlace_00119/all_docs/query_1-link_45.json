        "text": "Miss Martian (real name M'gann M'orzz,[1] alias Megan Morse[2]) is a Martian and a member of the Team.[14] She is the niece and former protégé of the Martian Manhunter.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWhen she first came to Earth, Miss Martian was a bubbly, exceptionally sweet, polite, and caring, although occasionally shy, \"young\" Martian girl, who longed to fit in on Earth and be a member of the Team. However, being from Mars and having never really interacted with humans before, she was frequently unfamiliar with Earth customs.[1] She felt especially uncomfortable with her telepathy, as on Mars, it is the prime form of communication.[15] She was also quite inexperienced, and eager to please.[16]\n\nBy 2016, she has become considerably more serious but still retains her caring side as well as more experienced and adept at using her powers. However, she has also begun to display a more darker side, becoming more selfish and ruthless when she begins abusing powers by ripping into the minds of enemies through extreme measures to extract information, leaving them catatonic and all down without showing any fear or remorse afterwards.[12] She sees her actions as justified and done for the greater good, therefore refuses to admit or acknowledge what she is doing is wrong. She was even willing to go so far as attempting to erase Superboy's memories over their arguments regarding the use of her powers, an act which ultimately lead to their break up.[17]\n\nThis changed after she did the procedure on Aqualad; still hating him for Artemis's murder, she used her mindblast on him, ruthlessly extracting all information from him. The discovery that he was undercover left her shocked and deeply traumatized, causing her to reconsider the use of her powers.[18] She became more timid, and reluctant to use even the most basic forms of telepathy.[19] She was filled with extreme guilt by what she had done and only after Artemis motivated her, did she begin to fix her mistakes.[20] Eventually, she comes to fully realize the error of her ways and takes full responsibility over her actions and selfishness, setting out to atone for her mistakes and mending her relationships.[21][22] By 2018, Superboy confirmed that she no longer shattered minds after seeing the error of her ways and is still afraid of crossing that line again.[23][24]\n\nPhysical appearance[]\n\nMiss Martian's true appearance is that of what most humans would consider an inhuman monster, with white skin, long limbs, and a hunchback.[25] However, as a shape-shifter, she can model her appearance to her desire, which is usually that of a green-skinned female humanoid based on Marie Logan as a teenager, with amber eyes and shoulder-length red hair, though after five years, she now keeps her hair at a shorter length, but it has since grown longer over the months. She also has freckles on her cheeks. After another two years she is now bald and no longer has freckles, but get her both hair and freckles back when posing as a human. Her skin is now white, reflecting her status as a White Martian. One year later, her hair has return and she now keeps her hair longer, past her shoulder, and she keeps the sclera of her eyes black.\n\nHer former primary outfit consists of a short-sleeved white top with a red X on it, along with a blue skirt, cape, gloves, and ankle high boots. For covert work, she dons a long-sleeved black suit with the same red X, black shoes, and her blue cape; the overall style is similar to the clothing worn by the Martian Manhunter.[26] While at Superman's Fortress of Solitude, her suit remained in the same style, except white. After five years, her covert ops costume became her primary outfit.\n\nIn casual situations, she takes the appearance of a green skinned high school student, wearing a white or light pink T-shirt under a short-sleeved crop top sweater, skirt, white knee-high socks with brown or dark blue shoes, and a headband to keep her hair back. The sweater, skirt, and headband are either red, purple, or blue. She can use her shape-shifting powers to switch from one outfit to another as needed.[1] When attending high school, she keeps her casual clothes on and merely changes her skin color to that of a Caucasian girl (her eyes, hair, and freckles remain unchanged).[2] She now wears a yellow or purple long sleeved cardigan over a white top and dark jeans or blue skirt.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nM'gann M'orzz was born 48 Earth years ago on the planet Mars.[6] Her mother is a Green Martian, the sister of J'onn J'onzz, and her father a White Martian.[27] She has eleven[9] sisters and seventeen brothers, and an extended family of 300 cousins.[15] All of her siblings are Green Martians, except one brother who is a White Martian.[27] As a White Martian,[25] M'gann suffered rejection from the predominant Green Martians.[28] She grew up watching Earth television, and following Martian Manhunter's adventures on Earth.[15] She was especially fond of Hello, Megan!, a comedy show that lasted only one season; she was drawn to the main character, Megan Wheeler, because of the similarity of their names, and because all her problems were solved in 22 minutes.[25]\n\nIn June 2010,[29] she ran away from home without saying good-bye.[30] She secretly bonded with the Bio-Ship intended for her uncle Martian Manhunter so she could stow away on one of his trips from Mars to Earth.[31] Manhunter had never met her before, but after contacting her parents and receiving their permission to let her stay on Earth,[30] he made her his protégé.[32] She lived with her uncle until July 2010.[33]\n\nJuly 2010[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in July 2010\n\nMiss Martian was introduced to Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, and Superboy on July 8,[26] and moved into the Cave.[8] She had difficulty with the new surroundings, as interaction with Earthlings was so much different from her family on Mars, or living with her uncle.[34] Her use of telepathy was especially deemed an invasion of privacy; especially Superboy was angry at her for it.[1] On their first unofficial mission, a commotion at the Happy Harbor Power Plant, she used her powers sparingly. She did not do well that day; she figured their enemy Mister Twister was a robot, and thought it was Red Tornado who was testing them. She was wrong, and again, Superboy was harsh to her. Eventually, her powers did have the key, as she impersonated Red Tornado to bait Mister Twister into a trap. She also crushed the suit's pilot and revealed that she was right: it was piloted by a robot.[1]\n\nOn the next mission, to Santa Prisca, Miss Martian figured out a way to make her powers even more useful. She established a mind link with which the members of the Team could communicate telepathically.[11]\n\nAugust 2010[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in August 2010\n\nMiss Martian, along with the rest of the Team, began taking training sessions with Black Canary. The Team was assigned to guard shipments of the disassembled Amazo. Professor Ivo was able to retrieve and reassemble the robot, but the Team defeated Amazo and captured Ivo.[35]\n\nArtemis joined the Team just before they were assigned a mission by Red Arrow: to protect Serling Roquette from the League of Shadows while she worked on a counter-weapon to the Fog she developed. Though initially put off by Artemis's outspokenness, M'gann warmed to her new teammate and welcomed her to the Team once the mission was complete.[36]\n\nThe Team took a class in espionage from Captain Atom. When the lecture proved boring, Captain Atom assigned them a cold case mission–to determine whether or not Air Force captain Nathaniel Adams was framed for the murder of his superior during the Vietnam War. The Team was ultimately successful in determining Adams' innocence.[37][38]\n\nThe Team was later sent by Red Tornado to protect the Helmet of Fate following Kent Nelson's disappearance. While the Helmet was kept safe, Kent died defending it.[13] Two days later, M'gann and the others attended Kent's funeral.[39]\n\nLater, Batman ordered the Team to track Clayface through Gotham City while he worked on a way to defeat him.[40] The Team engaged Clayface against Batman's orders–the Team was soundly defeated, but were saved by Batman at the last moment.[41] Taking the night off following their defeat, M'gann attempted some cooking with the help of Superboy.[42]\n\nSeptember 2010[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in September 2010\n\nBatman sent the Team to Bialya, where they encountered Psimon, who blocked their memories of the prior six months. Miss Martian was able to reunite with Robin, Kid Flash, and Artemis, and restore their missing memories. Sensing Superboy in pain, she went to rescue him, and found the Bialyan base. She faced off against Psimon again and won, saving Superboy and Sphere.[43]\n\nAqualad invited Superboy and Miss Martian to visit Atlantis with him. They met Kaldur's parents, then went to the capital, where they helped thwart Ocean-Master's plot to steal Queen Mera's powers.[44][45]\n\nM'gann and Superboy began school. M'gann provided Superboy with the name Conner for the occasion. On her first day she successfully tried out for the cheer squad.[2]\n\nMiss Martian and Superboy were sent on a mission to infiltrate Belle Reve Penitentiary posing as the Terror Twins. They successfully prevented the breakout attempt, and had their first kiss.[3]\n\nM'gann was present in the Cave when Red Inferno and Red Torpedo attacked. She was held captive in a cage of fire until rescued by Artemis. Like the rest of the Team, she was rendered unconscious by Red Tornado, who fled with his \"siblings\".[46] Miss Martian, like the rest of the Team, was furious to discover Aqualad had withheld information about a possible mole on the Team, and frustrated by Superboy's overprotective reaction. Batman assigned the Team to investigate reports of gorilla attacks in India. After defeating the Brain and freeing his Kobra-Venom-enhanced animal slaves, M'gann was satisfied with Aqualad's reasons for keeping the secret.[47]\n\nThe Team was then sent to investigate reports of another Kobra-Venom operation in Bwunda. The Team was ambushed and captured by the Brain's gorillas. Having gained telepathy, the enslaved gorillas sensed M'gann's power and sought out her help. Together they were able to rescue the gorillas' captive children, free M'gann's team and liberate the gorillas.[48][49]\n\nOctober 2010[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in October 2010\n\nThe Team was sent to destroy the central control system being used by the Injustice League to attack a number of cities worldwide with giant plants. They successfully destroyed the control plant, and the subsequent arrival of the Justice League was enough to force their enemies to surrender.[50]\n\nThe Team was introduced to Zatanna. They went on an unauthorized mission to find Red Tornado. They discovered the robot had not betrayed them and, together with Red Inferno and Red Torpedo, they were able to destroy Red Volcano and prevent the Yellowstone super-volcano from devastating the planet.[51]\n\nThe Team took part in a telepathic training simulation run by Martian Manhunter. It went wrong when Artemis's \"death\" caused Miss Martian to take control, causing them to forget it was not real. The simulation ended when M'gann, the last survivor, was \"killed\" by Manhunter. M'gann was riddled with guilt and, like the rest of the Team, was left devastated.[52] The Team was given therapy by Black Canary. M'gann admitted she was uncomfortable with her powers, and Canary suggested she train with her uncle to gain confidence.[16]\n\nOn Halloween, M'gann attended a party at Happy Harbor High School with Conner and Wally. They discovered Marvin was playing a prank on the guests, so came up with a counter-prank.[32]\n\nNovember 2010[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in November 2010\n\nAfter all the adults in the world disappeared, M'gann and the Team worked with Zatanna to find the cause. With help from Captain Marvel, they were able to communicate with the adults in their own separate dimension and coordinate an attack on Klarion and his group of sorcerers, merging the dimensions back into one.[53]\n\nLater, M'gann attended Kid Flash's \"surprise\" birthday party at the Cave. She then joined the joint League-Team mission to disable the ice fortresses freezing North America.[54]\n\nM'gann joined a mission to Qurac to discover why the nation's leader decided to allow Bialya to absorb Qurac. They saved Marie Logan and her son from Bialyan tanks, though Gar was injured during a reprisal attack. M'gann saved Gar's life with a blood transfusion. The Team went on to the capital, where they encountered Psimon, who was controlling Harjavti. M'gann defeated Psimon once more, but not before he and Queen Bee discovered her true form. The Team then asked M'gann about Hello, Megan! and she admitted she had based her human self on Megan/Marie when she came to Earth. She was later confronted by Queen Bee, who threatened to reveal M'gann's true form if she did not cooperate.[25]\n\nDecember 2010[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in December 2010\n\nM'gann and Conner visited the Logans before going to Dhabar[55] to protect Harjavti from a suspected attack by Queen Bee. They and Superman intervened as Deadshot apparently attempted to kill Harjavti.[56]\n\nBored while the rest of the Team was on a mission, M'gann, Conner, and Zatanna broke into Red Tornado's apartment and discovered his android alter ego.[57]\n\nM'gann joined an undercover mission to investigate tech robberies linked to Haly's Circus. They were able to capture Parasite and prevent him from using the stolen tech to create a black hole.[4]\n\nMiss Martian and the rest of the Team, now including Rocket, responded to an alert that Cheshire had been spotted. They found they had been lured into a trap, but were nonetheless successful in defeating their enemies and capturing the case that had eluded them previously. Realizing the trap meant there must really be a mole, Superboy, Artemis, and Miss Martian revealed their secret links to their enemies to the rest of the Team, and found acceptance. The Team ambushed Lex Luthor, Queen Bee and their allies on Santa Prisca and captured several villains, though Luthor and Bee escaped.[28]\n\nThey returned to the Cave triumphant, but were shocked to find Batman waiting to tell them the mole was Red Arrow. M'gann, Aqualad, Superboy, and Artemis went to find Roy, while the others investigated Red Tornado's mysterious shutdown. They found Red Arrow, who explained he had unwittingly been under the Light's control. The Team infiltrated the Watchtower and freed the League from the Light's control.[58]\n\nJanuary 2011[]\n\nMiss Martian and Superboy were locked in a passionate hug when she sensed Superman's presence. She left so her beau and the Man of Steel could talk in private.[58]\n\n2011-2015[]\n\nMiss Martian practiced on her powers, and they increased considerably.[59] She also learned density shifting.\n\nFebruary 2015[]\n\nMount Justice\n\nEST\n\nMiss Martian joined the rest of the Team for a briefing after Artemis investigated two sites in Greece for the disappeared archaeologist Helena Sandsmark.[60]\n\nAfter Superboy investigated further in Siberia, discovered the Light's involvement, and recovered two Babylonian artifacts, M'gann noted that the two fit together, and wondered why two Babylonian artifacts were buried so far away from each other.[61]\n\nMount Justice\n\nEST\n\nThe Light was stopped, but at a price; Aquagirl had to sacrifice herself. Miss Martian gathered with the rest of the Team to debrief and mourn.[62]\n\nDecember 2015[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in December 2015\n\nMiss Martian participated in a mission in Metropolis to protect a rally held by Noor Harjavti and was also dealing with her recent break up with Superboy. During the rally, the heroes spotted Devastation hiding in the crowd, but Superman, Superboy, and Devastation abruptly disappeared with a bright flash of light.[55]\n\nWhen Zeta radiation was discovered emanating from the Moon, Nightwing sent Miss Martian and Lagoon Boy to investigate aboard the Bio-Ship.[63] The pair found the culprit—an alien vessel had teleported away the missing superhumans, and it was moving away from the Earth. The Bio-Ship pursued the ship,[64][65] and Miss Martian phased inside the vessel once she was close enough.[56] Inside, Miss Martian found the abductees being held captive by crystalline orbs. She destroyed the orbs.\n\nAfter seeing the determination of his captives, the ship's owner, Kylstar, decided to free the captives. The Earth heroes and villains who were unwilling to stay were teleported away. They materialized on the Collector of Worlds's ship, and fought a pitched battle against the Collector, who had encased Metropolis in a force barrier and wanted to preserve it. Ultimately, the heroes persuaded him to put everything back to normal, and leave the Earth alone.\n\nAt some point later, Miss Martian started dating Lagoon Boy[66][67]\n\nJanuary 2016[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in January 2016\n\nMiss Martian joined Delta Squad in successfully flushing out and capturing Clayface in the Gotham City sewers. Following the revelation that aliens called Kroloteans had abducted and replaced some humans, Miss Martian joined a briefing aboard the Watchtower, where Adam Strange revealed that the Kroloteans teleported to Earth from a distant planet called Rann. Miss Martian, Superboy, Beast Boy, and Adam Strange were sent to investigate.[67]\n\nUpon arriving in Rann, they found and infiltrated the Krolotean base, and successfully destroyed all the Zeta platforms. The Kroloteans pursued them. Miss Martian and Beast Boy were captured, but were rescued by Superboy and Alanna. Miss Martian forcibly mentally interrogated the Krolotean captain, reducing him to a vegetative state.[12]\n\nUpon returning to Earth, Miss Martian shared her discoveries with the League—the reasons behind the Kroloteans' presence on Earth and why the League were wanted criminals. Miss Martian was then sent to the Hall of Justice to interrogate another Krolotean. She found the location of the remaining Kroloteans still stranded on Earth—Malina Island.\n\nAs others assaulted the island, Miss Martian and Martian Manhunter disguised themselves as Kroloteans, and successfully downloaded all the information from the Kroloteans' systems before the island was destroyed by a bomb of unknown alien origin.\n\nMiss Martian later said goodbye to J'onn outside Mount Justice, before he and the accused Leaguers left for Rimbor to stand trial for their actions.[68]\n\nFebruary 2016[]\n\nMount Justice\n\nEST\n\nM'gann and La'gaan witnessed the activation of the Zeta-Shield, before continuing with their movie night.[69]\n\nQurac\n\nUTC+2\n\nMiss Martian lead a mission to Bialya. She flew the Bio-Ship over Qurac's desert while Nightwing briefed them on their mission. They had to investigate an uptick in boom tube activity.[70]\n\nBialya\n\nUTC+2\n\nAfter they found several bases deserted, they discovered one with heavy security. Miss Martian sent Bumblebee and Batgirl to investigate a hangar each, and left Wonder Girl on lookout duty.\n\nWhile investigating, Cassie made her way to her and informed her Psimon was present, along with Devastation, Icicle Jr., Mammoth, and Shimmer. M'gann shut down the telepathic link, and they prepared to warn the others. Wonder Girl was discovered, and an alarm was sent off, forcing Miss Martian and Wonder Girl to retreat to the rendezvous point without the others. They were later joined by Bumblebee, who told them of Batgirl's capture.\n\nMiss Martian infiltrated the facility again, and took down Shimmer. Disguised as her, she locked down the hangar, and was detected by Psimon. She made no effort to hide it, and engaged Psimon in a psychic battle. Bumblebee distracted Psimon, leaving Miss Martian free to take care of Icicle. Batgirl, liberated, flew a plane full of abducted teenagers down the runway, but the plane was damaged and it fell off the cliff at the end. Neither Wonder Girl nor Miss Martian had the strength to stop its fall, so Miss Martian called in the Bio-Ship. It grabbed the fuselage, and they made it to safety.[70]\n\nMount Justice\n\nEST\n\nAt the debriefing, Miss Martian explained that when she knocked out Shimmer, she discovered Queen Bee was only working as a middle man in the abductions, but they had no idea who her partner was. Nightwing congratulated them on the successful mission.[70]\n\nMarch 2016[]\n\nMain article: Miss Martian in March 2016\n\nMiss Martian took part a mission in Cape Canaveral to protect the launch of the Earth-Mars Communication Satellite, which also saw Artemis return to the Team. During the mission, M'gann participated in a press conference disguised as Martian Manhunter.\n\nWhen Manta Troopers attacked the launch site from the sea, Miss Martian went underwater to assist Lagoon Boy. Although she was able to destroy Black Manta's underwater missile platform, she was unable to rescue La'gaan from being captured. The mission ended in disaster with the satellite destroyed, and Artemis apparently killed by Kaldur'ahm in combat.[17]\n\nA day later, Miss Martian attended Raquel Ervin's bridal shower in Dakota City. The shower was interrupted by a robbery attempt by Captain Cold, who they easily defeated.[71]\n\nAfter Kaldur'ahm destroyed Mount Justice with an alien bomb and abducted members of the Team, Miss Martian joined in the search for them, leading to a spaceship hidden in the ocean depths, Miss Martian infiltrated it and rescued the captured Beast Boy and Impulse, and while returning to the extraction point, met with Kaldur'ahm. Believing him to be a murderer, she attacked and destroyed his mind. Only belatedly did she realize that Artemis's death was a ruse. Dazed by her discovery, Miss Martian traveled with Beast Boy to the docking bay, but she was ambushed and knocked unconscious by Black Beetle. Blue Beetle's timely intervention saved the mission, and all Team members and abductees escaped aboard the Bio-ship.[18]\n\nApril 2016[]\n\nM'gann was with Mal Duncan and Superboy in the library at the Hall of Justice, gathering their belongings salvaged from Mount Justice. Captain Marvel, Zatanna, and Bumblebee were also present. Captain Marvel and Zatanna accosted L-Ron, who generated a force field around the Hall and Despero then arrived, attacking Marvel and using his powers to shut down Zatanna's mind. Superboy and Bumblebee left the library as Mal informed M'gann that communications and Zeta-Tubes were not functioning.\n\nThe two then left the library, with M'gann using her telekinesis against Despero. When that failed to contain the alien, Mal suggested M'gann brain blast Despero, but M'gann would not do it.\n\nDespero ultimately subdued Marvel—who had transformed into Billy Batson after using his transformation lightning to fry Despero—and took down Superboy, prompting Bumblebee to plead with M'gann to try a mental attack. M'gann remembered what happened when she did that to Kaldur on the Reach research ship, and refused again. Bumblebee went after Despero but was subdued and, just as Despero was about to crush Bumblebee under his foot, Mal appeared, wearing the armor that once belonged to Guardian.\n\nCommunicating telepathically, Mal told M'gann he was buying the others time to come up with a plan, so M'gann escaped with Superboy and Bumblebee. As the trio escaped on an elevator, Superboy recovered. M'gann told him she couldn't attack Despero telepathically, so Superboy told her she needed to come up with another idea before something happened to Mal.\n\nM'gann reached out to Zatanna, Batson, and Bumblebee telepathically, snapping them out of their trances. Zatanna, in possession of Mal Duncan's mind, reflected Despero's attack back at him, putting the alien in a trance. This allowed Superboy to defeat him. L-Ron was incensed at their lack of sportsmanship, and upon his destruction set off an explosion that caused the Hall of Justice to crumble. Captain Marvel safeguarded M'gann and the others from the falling debris.[19]\n\nChicago\n\nCDT\n\nPosing as John Jones, M'gann arrived at her uncle's apartment, where she received a phone call from Lagoon Boy but chose not to answer it. As she prepared to water the plants, Superboy knocked on the door and said he needed to speak with her. M'gann let Superboy into the apartment.[19]\n\nTaos\n\nMDT\n\nM'gann was with Team members, Adam Strange and Green Beetle at STAR Labs. Nightwing wanted M'gann to read Green Beetle's mind and confirm his story about coming to Earth to help. M'gann was hesitant, but Green Beetle tried to reassure her. However, his attempt at a smile startled her. Nightwing told M'gann that he was unfamiliar with the Martian etiquette, but this was the only way to confirm Green Beetle's story. As M'gann established telepathic contact with Green Beetle, he learned she was really a White Martian and that she had a previous bad experience with her powers. He thus volunteered to offer his most recent memories. After a brief period, M'gann told the others that she had confirmed Green Beetle's account.\n\nAfter Nightwing dismissed everyone, Lagoon Boy asked to speak to M'gann. After looking at Superboy, who just shrugged, M'gann said Lagoon Boy could join her in Chicago at her uncle's apartment.[72]\n\nChicago\n\nCDT\n\nAs La'gaan and M'gann arrived in Chicago, La'gaan inquired about what was going on between her and Superboy, but the two were then ambushed by Deathstroke and Tigress. Communicating telepathically, Tigress explained to M'gann that she needed her help to repair Kaldur's mind and needed to make the abduction look good to avoid raising suspicion. Deathstroke ultimately took down La'gaan, and Tigress threw several bombs that ignited flames to weaken M'gann, allowing Deathstroke to place an inhibitor collar on her. Deathstroke and Tigress then took M'gann prisoner aboard the Manta-Flyer.[72]\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nEDT\n\nMiss Martian woke up aboard the Manta-Sub, where Black Manta ordered her to help Kaldur or die. He told Miss Martian that Deathstroke was watching her on another ship, out of her telepathic range, and would selectively reactivate her telepathy. However, if Deathstroke suspected Miss Martian used her telepathy for any reason other than to help Kaldur, he would trigger a bomb on the collar. Manta left Tigress with her, and she ordered Miss Martian to get started.\n\nCommunicating telepathically, M'gann told Artemis she doubted she could fix Kaldur's mind—tearing apart someone's mind is an easy task, but piecing a mind back together is more difficult. Furthermore, her presence in Kaldur's mind might be considered a threat. Out of options, Artemis told M'gann to take her into Kaldur's mind as well.\n\nUpon entering Kaldur's mind, M'gann had to remind Artemis the two are not really underwater, but the two were attacked by a wraith of Tula. While Artemis applied what Kaldur taught her to remain safe, M'gann's lingering guilt made her susceptible to Tula's assault. M'gann only overcame her guilt when Artemis brought Aqualad to her, and allowed her to apologize. She then worked with Aqualad to begin restoring his mind\n\nSix hours later, Black Manta returned to check on Miss Martian's progress. She told him repairing Kaldur's mind would take days, if not weeks. Manta warned Miss Martian against stalling, but realized she made actual progress when Kaldur called out for his father. Pleased with her cooperation, he told her to continue working so he would spare her life.[72]\n\nMay 2016[]\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nEDT\n\nWhile M'gann was able to cure Aqualad quickly, she, Tigress, and Aqualad kept up the charade that Kaldur'ahm was still in a coma. Unfortunately, Manta became impatient and gave a 24-hour ultimatum. Fortunately, Cheshire and Sportsmaster attacked; when the guards swarmed the room, M'gann was able to use a guard's gun to destroy the security camera. She was knocked out, but was able to recover in time to force Sportsmaster and Cheshire into a shared mind link with Tigress and Aqualad, wherein they explained the truth of what had really happened. Cheshire was convinced, and though it took a little while Sportsmaster was as well. Miss Martian and Cheshire pretended that they were going to allow Miss Martian to kill Aqualad and Black Manta. Aqualad then \"miraculously\" regained consciousness and tackled her, allowing M'gann to slip away and flee the submarine. Sportsmaster destroyed all evidence of Tigress disabling the power restraints on Miss Martian, allowing Aqualad to resume his deep cover role without endangering M'gann.[73]\n\nThe Warworld\n\nUTC\n\nAs Nightwing piloted the Bio-Ship, M'gann telepathically searched for the rest of the Team but could not find them. Nightwing suggested they restart the investigation where the Team first disappeared. There, Nightwing and M'gann each blamed themselves for how events had unfolded. M'gann then realized that the two needed to stop blaming themselves, save the Team, then save Blue Beetle. The conversation was disrupted by a clanging sound, followed by a series of familiar bleeps. When they unlocked a door, they found Sphere.\n\nSphere led the two to where the Team members were being held, where they took down several Reach soldiers. When the door to the stasis chamber opened, they found that Arsenal and the four runaways had freed the Team. Everyone then fled to the Bio-Ship.[74]\n\nJune 2016[]\n\nPoseidonis\n\nUTC-2\n\nMiss Martian traveled to Atlantis to pick up Lagoon Boy, because she desperately needed to talk with him. He welcomed her with a powerful hug, but his mood soon changed when he heard she wanted to talk. They left for Blüdhaven in the Bio-Ship.[21]\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nUTC-3\n\nOn their way, Miss Martian broke up with La'gaan. She felt he would only ever be her rebound guy, and he deserved better. He was angry at it, but could do little about it.[21]\n\nBlÜdhaven\n\nEDT\n\nAfter returning to the Warehouse, Miss Martian asked Nightwing where Conner was. He told her Superboy was out with Wendy. She looked disappointed.[21]\n\nSanta Prisca\n\nECT\n\nPosing as Deathstroke at the summit between the Light and the Reach, Miss Martian \"shot\" Artemis and Aqualad after it was revealed that they were double agents. When Aqualad and Artemis were done playing dead, \"Deathstroke\" telekinetically floated a sword at Vandal Savage's neck. She explained that she was Miss Martian and the whole \"shooting\" was a result of Hollywood special effects. Aqualad then introduced the Team, who came into the cave to stop the villains. Dozens of League of Shadows agents came in, and fought the Team.\n\nVandal Savage then activated a ring from his finger, and Klarion appeared. Klarion transformed Deathstroke's sword into a fire serpent, and left through a portal with Vandal Savage. The snake wrapped around Miss Martian and was about to bite her when Lagoon Boy jumped into the serpent's mouth and transformed into a puffer fish, breaking the snake apart. He caught M'gann and she thanked him. They quickly picked new targets and resumed the fight.\n\nBlack Beetle tried to escape with the scientist through a hole in the ceiling. Miss Martian and Blue Beetle flew up to stop him, but he shot down, and they were unable to keep up with him.[75]\n\nRimbor\n\nUTC\n\nMiss Martian, Superboy, and Adam Strange arrived at the court at which the six Justice League members were standing trial. She told Icon they had evidence to clear the Leaguers but Icon told her it was too late. Miss Martian and Superboy appealed to the Tribunal, who admitted the evidence was compelling but the court had already ruled. When Icon objected, the Tribunal asked for something \"more\". Miss Martian and Superboy improvised, saying that the case was a chance for the court to demonstrate justice prevailed on Rimbor, that more cases would thus be brought to the court and thus the more \"mores\" the tribunal would receive.\n\nAs the Tribune privately discussed the matter, Miss Martian admitted to Superboy that their deteriorated relationship was her fault and that she knew he was dating Wendy Harris, but Superboy replied he was acting as a sounding board between Wendy and her real boyfriend, Marvin White. The Tribunal then exited their chambers and announced all charges against the Leaguers had been dropped. Miss Martian, Superboy and Adam Strange then teleported back to Earth.[22]\n\nMetropolis\n\nEDT\n\nWhen Magnetic Field Disruptors planted by the Reach threatened the Earth, Miss Martian joined 39 other heroes of Earth in a briefing in Metropolis. The heroes would use a computer virus provided by Lex Luthor to safely disable the disruptors. The heroes were paired off with another into twenty squads: one member would run interference against weapons guarding the disruptors, allowing the other to get close enough to plant the virus. Miss Martian was assigned to Psi Squad, and worked alongside Beast Boy.[76] Within thirty minutes, all squads had succeeded in their mission.[22]\n\nNorth Magnetic Pole\n\nUTC\n\nMiss Martian arrived with other Team members in the Bio-Ship as Flash, Kid Flash and Impulse were able to counter a disruptor that had gone chrysalis and thus stabilize Earth's magnetic field, but it came at the cost of Wally West's life. M'gann and the others grieved the loss of their friend.[22]\n\nMount Justice\n\nEDT\n\nMiss Martian and the rest of the Team met with the Justice League members that had just returned from Rimbor. Aqualad informed them that the Earth had been saved but at a cost.[22]\n\nIn late June,[77] M'gann attended Wally West's funeral.[78]\n\nJuly 2016[]\n\nMiss Martian and Superboy were in the memorial garden, observing Robin and Wonder Girl. Superboy asked how long they had been a couple and Miss Martian replied that Cassie got the courage to kiss Robin after realizing how short life was when Wally passed away. The two agreed courage could be hard to come by, but they were then summoned by Aqualad to the mission room. There, Batman informed the Team the Watchtower would serve as their headquarters because the Team earned the right to fight alongside the Justice League. Aqualad then assigned Miss Martian, Superboy and Beast Boy to Alpha Squad to go to Mars to assist B'arzz O'oomm.[22]\n\nDuring the mission, M'gann introduced Conner and Gar to her parents.[79]\n\nAugust 2016[]\n\nThe Watchtower\n\nEDT\n\nMiss Martian and Beast Boy were ready for their mission briefing, just waiting for Superboy. He immediately gave her a cold shoulder and his mood didn't clear up during the briefing. The target was her old foe Psimon, and Superboy reminded her of her previous altercations and abuse of power.[80]\n\nHollywood\n\nPDT\n\nPsimon lured them to a classic movie convention. One of the speakers was Sandra Stanyon, and Miss Martian and Beast Boy snuck off in the hopes of learning more about Marie. M'gann was hesitant to go and later hesitant to ask a question, but Superboy supported her. As a teammate, nothing more. Sandra was happy to tell them all about it and was delighted to meet Marie's children.\n\nDuring a sit down with her at the food court, Psimon trapped them all inside M'gann's mind. They were forced into a memory of Hello, Megan!.[80] Psimon had chosen this venue specifically so M'gann would be emotionally unstable, which made his part easier.[81]\n\nHollywood\n\nPDT\n\nThough she played the role of Megan Wheeler and for the most part followed the course of the source episode they were thrown in, parts of M'gann could seep through. She wanted forgiveness for her actions, and at the talent show in the episode's finale, changed the entire song for one filled with emotion. When Superboy forgave her and asked for forgiveness in turn, M'gann regained enough mental strength to get them all out.[81]\n\n2016-2018[]\n\nMiss Martian became the leader of the Team following Aqualad's ascension into the Justice League and assuming the mantle of his former mentor. After reconciling their relationship, Miss Martian and Superboy moved into a house together in Happy Harbor.[82] and she got a job as a student counselor at Happy Harbor High School.[83]\n\n2018[]\n\nAt some point, she joined with other leading members of the Justice League and the Team to form a secret group to oppose the Light. They plotted a breakaway from the League to form a new covert team which would secretly be coordinated with the League.[84]\n\nThe Watchtower\n\nEDT\n\nMiss Martian debriefed the Team after a mission, then Aquaman arrived for an emergency meeting of the Justice League. He told Miss Martian that, as Team leader, she was allowed to observe the proceedings. He said it would be a difficult discussion, but Miss Martian assured him of her support. As Miss Martian silently observed the meeting, League members debated recent events and the League's purpose, which led to multiple members resigning.[82]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann and Conner had a heart-to-heart talk, in which Conner said he felt the burden of stepping in for Superman's absence while he was in outer space. M'gann assured Conner that he would do the right thing. After Nightwing stops by to recruit Conner for a mission, M'gann raised concern, saying she needed his support. Conner assured her he would, then surprised M'gann by proposing to her. M'gann said yes.[82]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann and Conner discussed Brion Markov staying with them following the latter's mission to Markovia with Nightwing.[85]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann was scrapbooking in the Carr family yard when Bear arrived via boom tube. He asked for help investigating reports of violence between the Bugs and New Gods of New Genesis, having found human DNA at the scene. M'gann was quick to offer help, but disappointed when Conner chose to stay with Brion and Dick. M'gann messaged the members of the Team to join her.[23]\n\nThe Team gathered and went to New Genesis with Bear via boom tube. As they began their investigation, they were attacked by Mantis and a group of Bugs, until Forager intervened on their behalf. The Team hid as the Bugs met with \"Orion\", with Miss Martian taking the form of a Bug. She noted there was a psychic wave fanning the Bugs' anger, and soon recognized the mind-touch of \"Orion\". She shifted into her natural Martian form and confronted \"Orion\", before the pair went to speak privately. \"Orion\" reverted to his true form as M'gann's brother M'comm. He confessed he was working to create conflict on New Genesis in order to get support for his White Martian revolution. When M'gann refused to help him, he and his Meta-human lackeys attacked her.[23]\n\nBear and the Team soon arrived to help M'gann, and they battled M'comm's metas while she engaged with him psychically. M'gann invoked memories of their childhood and her own experiences of love and friendship on Earth, but was unable to convince M'commm to turn away from his path of violence and hatred. M'gann was forced to overpower M'comm psychically, but in revenge M'comm activated a kill command in the metas, before threatening Forager and density shifting away. With Forager now under threat from M'comm and viewed as a traitor by Mantis, M'gann offered to take him to Earth, and so they and the rest of the Team returned to Earth via boom tube.[23]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann introduced Forager to Brion and Halo, having psychically taught him English. She arranged for Brion and Forager to live in the Bio-Ship, who took the form of a recreational vehicle. M'gann listened as Dick arrived and explained about the murder of Jaqqar Marlo and its possible connection to Brion's missing sister. Later, M'gann, Conner, Dick, Artemis and Lucas discussed Brion, Halo and Forager's futures in M'gann and Conner's apartment. When they went to tell Halo about new information found about her past life, they found Halo, Brion, Forager and Sphere gone. Surmising that they had gone to Infinity Island in hopes of finding Tara, they followed in the Bio-Ship.[86]\n\nInfinity Island\n\nECT\n\nMiss Martian and the others found Brion, Halo, Forager and Sphere imprisoned and promptly freed them. On the way out, they encountered Sensei, Ubu and a Red Hooded Ninja, and fought them until Ra's al Ghul intervened and allowed them to leave, but not before revealing that he was no longer in charge of the League of Shadows or a member of the Light. On the way back in the Bio-Ship, M'gann offered Forager a place on the Team, but he preferred to be with Brion and Halo in a group of outsiders.[86]\n\nGotham City\n\nEDT\n\nMiss Martian gathered with Aquaman, Batman, Robin, Nightwing and Oracle to report to Wonder Woman about the operation to bring down the Branchwater meta-trafficking operation, and its head, Simon Stagg, whom M'gann and Conner had intercepted receiving stolen goods earlier as part of the operation. When Wonder Woman voiced reservations about the secret coordination of their teams and lying to their teammates, Miss Martian, like all the others, did not support her.[84]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nAt their apartment, M'gann was mystified why Conner watched The G. Gordon Godfrey Show, before Lucas Carr arrived and offered to carpool to work with her.[83]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann was showering while Conner was getting out of bed. Though he had planned to join Nightwing's team for training, Conner decided to join his fiancée in the shower.[87]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann and Lucas took Violet and Forager, now known as Fred Bugg and disguised with a Glamour Charm, for their first day at Happy Harbor High School. Later that day, Violet created a boom tube and went through it, prompting Fred to find Megan. They were together at the site of Violet's disappearance when a boom tube opened and she returned with Victor Stone.[88]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nOutside her apartment, M'gann gathered with Nightwing's team, Helga Jace and Vic to discuss recent events. Together, they surmised that Halo is the soul of a dissected Motherbox in Gabrielle Daou's body, and that Halo will need to stay close to Vic in order to cleanse him of the influence of the Fatherbox that has fused with his body. M'gann is less than thrilled to find Vic, another stray, staying with them, though she understands the necessity of the situation. She told Conner she was unhappy with the amount of time alone they had been able to spend together since becoming engaged. She wanted a date night to solve the problem, while Conner proposed a secret base.[89]\n\nBeverly Hills\n\nPDT\n\nHaving received a call from Perdita, M'gann and Conner arrived at Perdita's hotel room to help Garfield, who had fallen into a coma after using some Goode Goggles. M'gann entered Gar's mind, with Conner as her anchor, but found that he had resolved the psychic trauma himself and was ready to awaken. When Garfield and Perdita kissed, M'gann lamented that this was as close to date night as she and Conner got, before he kissed her in turn.[89]\n\nM'gann shared Garfield's discovery of the role of Goode Goggles in meta-human trafficking with the Team and the League. Together they formed squads to hit all depots used by the goggles, and staged simultaneous raids on October 31, 2018. M'gann led a squad to Utah on the Super-Cycle. The raids were all successful, and dozens of liberated metas were taken to the Meta-Human Youth Center.[90]\n\nThe Watchtower\n\nEST\n\nMiss Martian welcomed Geo-Force, Halo, Terra and Forager to the Team. She was particularly happy to have another alien on the Team. Shortly after, Beast Boy arrived wanting to join as well. M'gann happily welcomed her brother, but noted she may not be able to send him on certain missions due to his celebrity.[91]\n\nTaos\n\nMST\n\nMegan attended an induction meeting at the Meta-Human Youth Center in her capacity as a counselor.[92]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEST\n\nAt their home, M'gann prepared Thanksgiving dinner. Later, she enjoyed the meal with Conner, Forager, Lucas Carr, Malcolm Duncan and Karen Beecher, who were eventually joined by Victor Stone.[93]\n\nThe Watchtower\n\nEST\n\nAlong with Aquaman and Tigress, Miss Martian attended a meeting of the Team arranged by Beast Boy. Gar announced his intention to form a public team of young heroes to help inspire young people. After some objections, Gar's idea prevailed.[94]\n\nHollywood\n\nPST\n\nGarfield took Miss Martian and the others to the Premier Building penthouse, which he had converted into a headquarters and living space for the new group. M'gann was unhappy with the idea of a group of teenagers living there unsupervised, and grateful when Helga volunteered to live there as a den mother.[94]\n\nHollywood\n\nPST\n\nMiss Martian visited the Premiere Building, and pointed out a livestream of a seeming Reach attack on Brooklyn, Maine. The new team quickly jumped into action. M'gann continued to watch their progress on the stream.[94]\n\nGotham City\n\nEST\n\nMiss Martian joined a meeting of the group leaders in the Batcave to discuss the Outsiders. Aquaman asked whether Beast Boy should now be included among them, but M'gann felt he was not ready for that.[94]\n\nMiss Martian discussed the Outsiders latest mission to Santiago de Cuba with Aquaman and Zatanna. Zatanna was shocked they would allow the group to face Klarion alone, and left to help them, discreetly.[95]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEST\n\nMegan went to Happy Harbor Police Department to pick up Violet after she was arrested for drinking and firing a gun. She spoke with Bethany Carr about Harper Row, who was arrested with Violet. On the ride home, M'gann tried to get Violet to open up, to no avail.[95]\n\nBwunda\n\nCAT\n\nMiss Martian led a joint Team-Outsiders mission to prevent a Bwundan Independence Front attack on a UN climate conference. M'gann took down a meta-human telepath who was keeping Troia mentally subdued. The attack was finally stopped with the intervention of the Flash, who was called in by Lex Luthor. Though Garfield wanted to argue with Luthor, who was taking credit for the victory in front of the media, M'gann called the Team and the Outsiders away. In the Bio-Ship, M'gann comforted the telepath, Lia, who had been under the influence of a control chip.[5]\n\nTaos\n\nMST\n\nMiss Martian confronted Halo about the extreme risks she took during the Bwunda mission. When Halo failed to offer any explanation, M'gann benched her from the Team until she was willing to talk to someone.[5]\n\n2019[]\n\nDublin\n\nUTC\n\nMiss Martian posed as Moira Malone, a girl who had been kidnapped by MONQIs, in order to lure the Outsiders to a secret LexCorp Spider Bot factory. In the ensuing battle, the factory was destroyed, and Moira was then reunited with her \"father\".[5]\n\nMiss Martian joined the team leaders in the Batcave to brief Wonder Woman on their operation in Dublin. Wonder Woman was appalled that they were lying to their teammates and the public in such extreme ways, but was met with silence from M'gann and the others.[5]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEST\n\nAt her office in Happy Harbor High School, Megan met with Harper Row to discuss the bruises on her and her brother Cullen. Harper initially claimed they were only from roughhousing, but Megan was able to convince Harper to admit that their father hit them. Later, she took Harper and Cullen to Happy Harbor Child Protective Services.[96]\n\nLos Angeles\n\nPST\n\nMegan was among the friends and family gathered at the Premiere Building to see Dick as he suffered the aftereffects of exposure to Gretchen Goode's X-Pit. Bruce called her and the other team leaders aside to talk, prompting Jefferson to realize they had been secretly coordinating all the teams all along. In the aftermath of Jeff's fury, M'gann had a psychic argument with Conner, and was also confronted by Gar when he learned how she had manipulated events in Dublin. Later, after Helga's betrayal is also revealed, M'gann watched wordlessly as Jeff stormed out.[97]\n\nM'gann led the Team in conducting raids on Goode World Studios holdings in search of Halo.[98]\n\nHollywood\n\nPST\n\nM'gann and Conner argued once more about her activities with the other team leaders. Conner accused her of using lies to alter minds, like she had used her psychic powers before. They were interrupted by the arrival of Vandal Savage, who had come to provide them with Halo's coordinates. M'gann led the Team, minus Thirteen and plus Geo-Force, Nightwing and Aquaman through a boom tube to Savage's coordinates.[98]\n\nThe Orphanage\n\nUTC\n\nThe Team arrived and split into two groups, with Miss Martian, Superboy, Nightwing, Tigress and Aquaman creating a distraction to allow the others to sneak in and find Halo. When they found the Javelin, they realized they were at the site of the Justice League's raid, and that they may now have to rescue the League as well. The group was attacked by the Furies, Mantis and Parademons. During the battle, Nightwing entered into a fever dream where he saw Kid Flash join them, and they all reverted to their appearance from the first months of the Team. Thanks to M'gann's psychic link, they all shared the hallucination until it ended with the defeat of their enemies.[98]\n\nThe group then moved on to find the others, but after briefly sensing her uncle's mind, M'gann could no longer sense him or anyone else outside their group. Realizing that they may be on their own, Aquaman suggested M'gann fry the brains of everyone they encounter in the control room. Superboy strenuously objected, due to the effect it would have on M'gann, but M'gann argued the stakes were high enough for one person's soul. When they entered the control room, M'gann did as planned, but Granny Goodness was able to push Halo into the Ghost Dimension created by Overlord, activating the Anti-Life Equation and putting Miss Martian and the rest of the Team under her control as well.[98]\n\nThe Orphanage\n\nUTC\n\nMiss Martian and the others were freed from the Anti-Life Equation by Halo, who in turn had just been freed from Granny's control by Vic. They destroyed Granny's machine and Overlord, and Granny was forced to flee. With Mantis among those captured, and having intel that her brother had returned to Mars, M'gann informed Forager that it was probably safe for him to return to New Genesis now, though he still had a place on Earth if he wanted to stay.[99]\n\nHollywood\n\nPST\n\nM'gann and the others returned to the Premiere Building via boom tube. M'gann and the other original Team members watched proudly as Vic joined the Outsiders and took the name Cyborg.[99]\n\nStar City\n\nPST\n\nAfter Zatanna received a call from a distraught Artemis, pleading with her to summon Wally's ghost, Zatanna arranged for M'gann and Raquel to accompany her to meet Artemis in the park. There, Zatanna and M'gann collaborated to create an open space in Artemis's mind where she could work out her grief on her own, believing she was meeting Wally's spirit in Limbo. Artemis emerged from the illusion satisfied and ready to start moving on with her life.[100]\n\nMarkovburg\n\nEET\n\nMiss Martian led a joint Team-Outsiders Gamma Squad to prevent the murder of those loyal to Gregor Markov during Baron Bedlam's coup attempt.[14]\n\nThe Watchtower\n\nEST\n\nMiss Martian attended a meeting of the Justice League, the Team and the Outsiders. As Nightwing fully disclosed the activities of the \"Anti-Light\", M'gann resigned as leader of the Team for her part in the conspiracy, and watched as Black Lightning was elected leader and Batman's team was folded back into the League and Team.[14]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEST\n\nM'gann and Conner watched GBS as it was announced that Superboy was to be among the newest members of the Outsiders, following his public coming out as a Genomorph at the United Nations. They went on to discuss the state of their relationship. M'gann handed back her engagement ring, saying that they had no future together if he could not truly trust or forgive her. Conner apologized for dredging up old wounds and made it clear he still wanted to marry her.[14]\n\nMetropolis\n\nEST\n\nM'gann and Conner attended a private party at Bibbo's Diner along with the Team Year Zero crew and their children and significant others. They were served by a waitress with an unusual ring.[14]\n\n2020[]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEST\n\nM'gann and Conner held a farewell party, inviting the Team Year Zero crew. After all of their guests arrived and some discussion of their upcoming trip, the party was interrupted by a call from Roy Harper, who reported that his Bowhunter Security team had been hit and their new hire abducted. Will Harper revealed that the new hire is in fact a reformed Clayface, and M'gann admitted she had helped approve his release after being called in by Batman to assess whether his reformation was genuine. Kaldur realized the attack was by Task Force X and that neither the Team nor the Justice League could openly act against them. Will proposed that the heroes join Bowhunter as temps, to which all, M'gann included, agreed.[101]\n\nBayou Bartholomew\n\nCST\n\nThe team took the Bio-Ship to intercept the Manta-Flyer, which M'gann shot down on Will's order. When they confronted Task force X, Clayface was contained in a pod which was left to sink into the mud. M'gann density shifted down to retrieve him, and re-emerged to find the battle over and Task Force X defeated.\n\nThe group subsequently returned to the Carr house to finish the party, and Raquel led a toast in M'gann and Conner's honor.[101]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEST\n\nM'gann and Conner prepared for their journey to Mars for their wedding. After saying goodbye to the Carrs, Harper and Cullen Row, Violet, Tara and Wolf, they set off with Garfield and J'onn in the Bio-Ship.[79]\n\nM'arzz\n\nUTC\n\nAs they drew near to Mars, M'gann became excited to return home, though she and Conner both noted Gar's cranky mood.[79]\n\nMa'aleca'andra\n\nUTC\n\nAfter arriving, M'gann reminds her companions to watch their thoughts while on Mars, as the difference between thinking something and saying it telepathically is very small. Disembarking at the Science Center, M'gann was surprised to find that her sister M'ree was the chief scientist in charge of the Zeta-Tube project, and had changed her name to Em'ree J'onzz. M'gann was unimpressed when Em'ree took on the form of first Megan Wheeler and then Rita Lee to make her friends more comfortable. After J'onn finished unloading the Bio-Ship, M'gann sent her away to have fun, and set off for her parents' house with Conner and Gar, refusing the transportation offered by Em'ree.\n\nWhile walking through the city, the trio noted the large amount of telepathic activity, some of the hostility directed their way, and the number of Martians taking human form. They were spotted by a group of excited Outsiders fans, but then came under a psychic attack, which M'gann quickly shielded them from. They decided to suspend sightseeing and go directly to M'gann's parents' home.\n\nThe trio were warmly greeted by J'ann and M'aatt M'orzz. Conner asked for M'aatt's permission to marry M'gann, which he gladly gave after affirming M'gann had asked Conner's parents' permission, in keeping with Martian custom. Later, the house was vandalized by a group of Martians who objected to M'gann and Conner's wedding. M'gann forced the group to disperse, but not before they brain blasted Gar. M'gann demanded her parents explain why things had become so much more hostile on Mars since their last visit, and they explained that the recent, unsolved murder of King S'turnn J'axx had caused an increase in racial tensions, and that the King's projects to increase contact with Earth, including Em'ree's Zeta project, had sparked a backlash against Earthers. M'gann becomes concerned that her brother may have killed the King.\n\nLater, the whole family went to the Science Center for the first test of the Zeta-Tube. All sensed the massive mindlink R'ess E'dda took to Queen J'arlia J'axx to protest the project, but M'gann was able to shield her companions from it. M'gann sensed her brother's presence, and he was held under scramblers by the M'hontrrs. M'gann confirmed that Ma'alefa'ak had not had time to interfere with the test, which went ahead with the Queen's blessing. As J'onn entered the tube, it exploded. M'gann was unable to sense her uncle.[79]\n\nMa'aleca'andra\n\nUTC\n\nIn the wake of the explosion, M'gann defended her brother against accusations of causing the explosion.[27]\n\nM'arzz\n\nUTC\n\nMa'alefa'ak was arrested none-the-less, and M'gann and her parents went with him. At the holding cell, Ma'alefa'ak was unrepentant for his methods and hatred of G'arrunns. M'gann asked to speak to him alone. He berated her for going to Earth and leaving him behind. She confirmed that he was not responsible for the explosion or the destruction of the M'arzz-Earth Communications Satellite, but was hiding something. With no evidence of his involvement, he demanded release.[27]\n\nSacred River\n\nUTC\n\nOn the Sacred Boat, M'gann and Conner were introduced to Sorcerer-Priestess S'yraa S'mitt and arrangements were made for the wedding and construction of the altar and canopy. S'mitt then conducted the Ma'ayava'ana ceremony, as M'gann had always dreamed.\n\nLater, M'gann and Conner celebrated the coming wedding, and then went with Gar to see Bio-Ship. On the way they were caught in a cave collapse, and M'gann sensed a psychic presence at the same time. Though no one was seriously hurt, M'gann noticed Conner had been cut. M'gann was unable to find the presence she sensed, but they group was forced to conclude they had been attacked.[27]\n\nMa'aleca'andra\n\nUTC\n\nM'gann and Conner reviewed the evidence for their investigation, and noted Gar was distracted and hadn't slept.[31]\n\nM'arzz\n\nUTC\n\nPrince J'emm J'axx visited the M'orzz home after hearing about the cave in. The group discussed the possibility the attack was connected to King S'turnn J'axx's murder. S'yraa arrived, and M'gann's parents reminded M'gann and Conner of their wedding obligations. M'gann introduced the group to Bio-Ship's offspring, Baby. M'gann, J'ann, Em'ree and S'yraa took Bio-Ship to the Crystal Cave to construct the wedding canopy. En route, Bio-Ship informed M'gann of her intention to retire and stay on Mars. M'gann was upset but understood the decision.[31]\n\nCrystal Cave\n\nUTC\n\nThe group used their telekinesis to construct the canopy out of crystal shards. M'gann privately spoke with S'yraa about her prior relationship with J'emm. Once the canopy was constructed, the group began to move it, but an argument broke out between M'gann and Em'ree, leading to the shattering of the canopy. Em'ree accused M'gann of only going through with the traditional wedding to please their parents; M'gann accused Em'ree of being ashamed of her A'ashenn father and siblings. When Em'ree suggested M'gann was ashamed of even being Martian, given her preferred human form, M'gann insisted her human form was who she truly was, briefly changing into her natural Martian form in the process. J'ann noticed how false M'gann's natural form seemed, and apologized to her for not realizing it sooner. S'yraa noted that the fact they were able to have such difficult conversations proved they share a strong family bond. They began to reassemble the canopy.\n\nLater, M'gann reunited with Conner and Gar. Gar had been healed of psychic trauma by someone posing as her, but M'gann admitted it had not been her. She confirmed no nasty surprise had been left by whoever had healed Gar, and was shocked to find their mindtouch matched that the one she sensed at the cave in.[31]\n\nMa'ayava'ana Ma'akk\n\nUTC\n\nM'gann and Conner kissed under the completed wedding canopy.[31]\n\nMa'aleca'andra\n\nUTC\n\nM'gann, Conner and Garfield said a final goodbye to Bio-Ship, much to M'gann's sorrow.\n\nLater, M'gann went to see Ma'alefa'ak in his cavern. She apologized to him for leaving him behind when she went to Earth and urged him to return to his family, but it made little impact.\n\nM'gann met up with Conner and Gar the Royal Arena. She created a mind space to allow them to review the evidence relating to the king's murder. Gar notices one A'ashenn servant entered the Palace on that night, but did not leave. They identify another servant who entered with them, K'arr M'angg, and went to his home in the A'ashenn slums to question him. M'angg eventually revealed that the servant was in fact G'arrunn posing as A'ashenn and is only telling them because M'gann is A'ashenn.\n\nThe group returned to the Arena and informed Prince J'emm of their findings. J'emm rushed off. Conner then realized that Martian magic had been used at the site of the murder. This prompted M'gann to realize the killer was S'yraa, who was G'arrunn before taking the Y'ellonn and had been in a relationship with Prince J'em that had likely been ended by the King. They caught up with J'emm and S'yraa, and S'yraa confessed that she had accidentally killed the king when she went to see him to implore him to allow her and J'emm to marry. As news spread, M'gann and the others watched as J'emm made a public speech calling for an end to caste-based discrimination.\n\nM'gann, Conner and Gar then watched the rest of J'emm's birthday celebration with the royal family, when Conner heard a sound below them. They investigated and found a bomb planted by Ma'alefa'ak, which apparently targeted G'arrunns with a virus. Conner sent M'gann and Gar away, concerned since she was of mixed parentage. Moments later, the bomb went off. M'gann went to the site of the explosion and found only an ash shadow left of Conner. Superman and Martian Manhunter soon arrived, but Superman was weakened by Kryptonite in the air, and they retreated back up to the Arena. M'gann tried to reach out and contact Conner, but got no response. Em'ree comforted M'gann as she broke down.\n\nLater, a heartbroken M'gann went to Ma'ayava'ana Ma'akk and cried on her wedding altar, mourning the loss of Conner.[102]\n\nM'arzz\n\nUTC\n\nM'gann and J'onn found Ma'alefa'ak at a meeting of his supporters in a cavern. After disabling his supporters, she demanded to know why he had killed Conner. Ma'alefa'ak shows no remorse for his role in Conner's death, but reveals he didn't know about the Kryptonite. M'gann confirmed this telepathically and was left devastated, having no one to blame for Conner's death as Manhunter attempted to comfort her.[103]\n\nMa'aleca'andra\n\nUTC\n\nOn Baby, M'gann watched as J'onn conferred with Hawkwoman on the Watchtower. Hawkwoman confirmed they had accounted for all known Kryptonite, leaving them with no leads. M'gann left wordlessly.\n\nLater, M'gann said goodbye to her parents. J'ann asked her to stay and heal with her family, but M'gann said she had responsibilities on Earth. J'ann suggested M'gann never planned on returning, M'gann responded that she wasn't planning anything.\n\nOn Baby, M'gann and J'onn were finishing loading supplies for the return trip to Earth, when Em'ree boarded, asking to go with them and get to know her sister better. M'gann was indifferent and walked off. J'onn signaled Baby to leave. They traveled back to Earth in silence.[103]\n\nBaby\n\nUTC\n\nM'gann stared at Conner's wedding ring as Em'ree tried to make a joke. She paid no attention as Em'ree and J'onn left the cockpit.\n\nLater, Em'ree provoked M'gann into an argument, claiming that she was ungrateful and that nothing Em'ree did would ever be enough to forgive her. M'gann soon realized it was a ploy to vent her bottled up grief, but it worked and the pair laughed. When Em'ree noted it was the first time she had seen M'gann laugh since Conner's death, M'gann began to cry and admitted she didn't know what she was going to do without him. Em'ree told her that she didn't have to know yet and needed time. M'gann told Em'ree she was a poor counselor but a great sister. Moments later, Baby was shook by a near collision with a mysterious object, but brushed it off as a false alarm.[104]\n\nAfter arriving back on Earth, M'gann helped Em'ree move into her apartment and got her a job at the Erdel Initiative. She also began closing up Conner's affairs and received support from her and Conner's friends and family. Gar was the first person who called when she got back, but she did not see him and remained unaware of his mental health struggles.[105]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann introduced Baby to Forager. Forager asked M'gann how she was doing, and if she had seen Garfield. When she said she had not, he updated her on Gar's troubling behavior and suggested she go see him. Before she did, M'gann called Perdita Vladek.[105]\n\nHollywood\n\nPDT\n\nM'gann visited Gar at the Premiere Building. Gar was furious she had spoken to Perdita. M'gann reminded Gar that they had found out about his lingering trauma on Mars and that he had promised to get help when they got back to Earth. Gar rejected this, saying that the diagnosis from someone posing as M'gann was hardly reliable. M'gann then diagnosed Gar with depression and possible PTSD herself. Gar did not dispute the symptoms but insisted he would deal with this loss himself, just as he had so many others. M'gann told him this time was clearly different, but Gar rejected any help.[105]\n\nHollywood\n\nPDT\n\nM'gann arrived at the Premiere Building with Robotman, Cassie, Jaime and Virgil to stage an intervention for Gar. After each of the others took a turn to speak to Gar, and were coldly dismissed, M'gann asked if he was having fun. She noted it was easier to dismiss the people that loved him than deal with his problems, but pushing people away meant that not only could they not help him, he couldn't help them. She reminded him that he was not the only one in mourning and that she needed her brother. Gar told her that he didn't want to be needed any more and was going to do this by himself, and went to leave. M'gann stopped him, and reminded him that unless he was willing to leave the Outsiders and his superhero career forever, he still had to have his annual mandatory mental health check with Black Canary.[105]\n\nPoseidonis\n\nUTC-2\n\nM'gann watched in camouflage as Orin talked with the clone of Orm. Orm vehemently denied being a clone. Orin asked M'gann's opinion, and she revealed herself, confirming that the unguarded Orm believed what he said was true. M'gaan offered to help Orm recover from whatever programming he may have been subjected to, but Orm continued to deny he was a clone.[106]\n\nPoseidonis\n\nUTC-2\n\nOrm called out for Orin. M'gann de-camouflaged and told him Orin was busy elsewhere, but it was M'gann whom Orm wanted. He wanted to know the truth. M'gann immediately recognized Psimon's touch on Orm's mind, and was able to recover Orm's earliest true memories; of Vandal Savage and Ultra-Humanite creating the clone body, of Psimon confirming to Savage that the clone had been implanted with the original Ocean-Master's memory engrams, and of a clone of Arion also implanted with Ocean-Master's memories. M'gann went to inform Orin of the discovery, but it was already too late, the clone Arion had already been elected High King, and Orin did not think anyone would believe him if he told them the truth now.\n\nLater, M'gann cleared Orm's mind of all programming and outside influence.[106]\n\nThe Watchtower\n\nEDT\n\nMiss Martian arrived at Black Lightning's request to make psychic contact with the Kaizer-Thrall, who she soon discovered was a trafficked meta-human boy named Danny Chase. Soon after, J'emm J'axx contacted her to tell her he had reason to believe Superboy was still alive. J'emm and Phantom Girl Zeta'ed aboard, and after Phantom Girl explained her story, she and M'gann set out to try to find Conner in the Phantom Zone.[107]\n\nBgtzl\n\nUTC\n\nThey ended up in Phantom Girl's home dimension instead. They tried again, with M'gann psychically helping Phantom Girl to focus, but ended up back on the Watchtower. Danny told them that he knew the trans-dimensional frequency of the Zone. This was of no use to Phantom Girl, but they could try a Motherbox. Orion came with a Motherbox and a plan to open a boom tube on Trombus.[107]\n\nTrombus\n\nUTC\n\nThe group boom tubed to Trombus, and Danny and the Motherbox opened a boom tube to the Zone. M'gann reached out to Conner psychically, but he refused to come out. She went to lead the group into the Zone to get him, but Ma'alefa'ak took control of the Kaizer-Thrall and used it to subdue M'gann and the others. She was helpless as Conner and three other Kryptonians exited the boom tube, and Conner collapsed due to his injuries.[107]\n\nTrombus\n\nUTC\n\nM'gann and the others remained pinned as Lor-Zod introduced himself to his parents. Forager was able to overcome the Thrall and make a brief attack, before being taken down by Ma'alefa'ak. The Zods retreated via boom tube, taking Conner and the Thrall with them.\n\nM'gann and the others eventually recovered. M'gann was distraught by the state she had found Conner in. The group boarded Bio-Ship to head for Earth, the most likely place the Zods had gone.[108]\n\nSubspace\n\nUTC\n\nPowered by both the Cosmic Treadmill and Forager's ring, the Bio-Ship flew at incredible speed. M'gann was deeply grateful the Bio-Ship had forgone her retirement to help Conner.[108]\n\nEarth\n\nUTC\n\nThe Bio-Ship arrived, and the group quickly detected boom tube activity at the Fortress of Solitude. Superman worried the Fortress's sensors would see them coming, but M'gann had already interfaces the Bio-Ship with its systems to hide their approach. They did not count on Ursa Zod gaining the power of the Eye of Ekron, however, which detected them and allowed the new Emerald Empress to blast them out of the sky as they approached. Saturn Girl was able to get off a warning, which allowed Superman and Orion to take the brunt of the blast. Bio-Ship crashed to the ground, and M'gann and Saturn Girl created a psychic illusion to make it appear everyone but Superman had died. The Zods eventually left with Superman as their captive.[108][24]\n\nNorth Pole\n\nUTC\n\nNightwing approached the crash site, and M'gann dropped the illusion. They caught up with each other, and determined to go after Zod and his group with those heroes still standing. Baby arrived, called by her mother's psychic pain, providing them with transport.[24]\n\nEastern Seaboard\n\nEDT\n\nEn route to Metropolis, M'gann thanked Baby and promised her mother would recover. Nightwing urged M'gann not to hold back in the coming battle.[24]\n\nMetropolis\n\nEDT\n\nThey arrived at Planet Circle to find other heroes already confronting Zod. M'gann mind-linked with Conner and restored his full memories, particularly reminding him of their relationship. M'gann then took on the Emerald Empress. She created a psychic decoy of herself for Ursa to kill, allowing her to sneak behind her and brain blast her, severing her link to the Eye of Ekron. Later, she intervened when Lor-Zod was attacking Conner, brain blasting him too. When Ma'alefa'ak was pushed into a boom tube to the Phantom Zone by Danny Chase, M'gann linked with him, letting him know she knew he had been glad Conner was \"dead\", before he fell in. Ultimately Zod's forces were defeated; all were either sent to the Zone or forced to flee.\n\nM'gann and Conner decided to get married as quickly as possible before anything else went wrong. They sent out video wedding invitations by September 15 for the wedding on September 16.[24]\n\nHappy Harbor\n\nEDT\n\nM'gann arrived to the wedding in a white limousine, and was walked down the aisle by her parents. Lucas Carr officiated a quick ceremony, and Conner and M'gann exchanged rings alongside vows where they talked about how they had taught each other what it meant to love someone. They were pronounced married and kissed before their friends and family. Later, M'gann threw the bridal bouquet, which was caught by Icicle Jr., and she and Conner had their first dance 16 feet above the dancefloor.[24]\n\nMiss Martian attended a briefing for Alpha Squad about the mission to rescue Perdita Vladek. They discussed how they would overcome Queen Bee's mind control powers using Miss Martian's telepathy and garlic pills.[78]\n\nMadinat Altharwati\n\nUTC+2\n\nMiss Martian stealthed from Baby into the LexCorp Robotics factory and found Perdita's cell, where she was held under Psimon's thrall. The rest of Alpha boom tubed from Baby. Queen Bee and Count Vertigo soon arrived, and Bee used her powers. Halo, Red Arrow and Arsenal played along and \"killed\" M'gann and the others.[109][78]\n\nMadinat Altharwati\n\nUTC+2\n\nTeam Year Ten\n\nAfter Psimon woke Perdita up and Vertigo explained her captors' plans and readied to kill her, the Team revealed they had faked being under Bee's control and disabled the villains. Miss Martian and Tigress went to help Superboy, leaving the others to evacuate Perdita. They easily fought their way to Superboy, and Miss Martian disabled Metallo. M'gann began to take Metallo's Kryptonite heart, but left it after Devastation explained he would die without it. They did take Match with them, however.[78]\n\nThe Watchtower\n\nEST\n\nIn the medical bay, M'gann, Superman and Nightwing discussed the rescue mission's outcome as Superboy and Match recovered from their Kryptonite exposure in solar pods.[78]\n\nPowers and abilities[]\n\nPowers[]\n\nMartian physiology: M'gann is a Martian and she possesses their physical and mental attributes.\n\nShape-shifting: She can change her form on a cellular level,[25] completely altering her physical appearance, including her organic clothing, allowing her to mimic other people or animals[49] and other creatures.[68] At first, she found male forms more difficult,[1] but eventually mastered them.[17] Her power is not restricted to humanoid forms; in order to fight off Ivo's MONQIs, she grew several extra arms,[35] and to both survive and maneuver underwater, she grew gills and a mermaid tail.[44]\n\nMalleability: She can stretch and bend her body [36] and limbs (e.g. into large whips to grab things at great distance).[110]\n\nHealing: Her shape-shifting allows her to heal faster than a human would.[111]\n\nCamouflage: She can change the appearance of her form (and her clothes) to bend the light waves around her to match with her surroundings,[112] making her almost invisible.[43][113] Her chances of staying undetected are diminished if she is moving.[112] Her Bio-Ship also has a camouflage mode that she can activate telepathically.[1]\n\nSuper strength: Like all Martians, Miss Martian has strength above that of a typical human.[111]Martians can augment their strength by focusing their telekinesis in their body and use it in a tactile way.[114]\n\nDurability: Like all Martians M'gann's body is denser than a humans but not nearly as durable as a Kryptonian.[111] Martians are also immune to human diseases.[4]\n\nDensity shifting: An advanced technique, density shifting enables Martians to move through solid objects or become incredibly dense and difficult to damage.[114] Though she did not originally have the ability,[1] she mastered it by 2016.[12]\n\nTelepathy: Telepathy comes naturally to Martians;[15] she can read minds,[1] mentally communicate with others,[11] and project her thoughts in other people's minds.[11] She initially struggled with other people's personal boundaries on Earth.[1] She often uses a telepathic link with her teammates, which makes communications easier and untraceable.[36] Miss Martian can also telepathically connect with her Bio-Ship.[1] After a botched telepathic training simulation, J'onn revealed that in terms of raw power, her telepathy is on a level beyond any he has encountered, including himself.[52] Her psychic powers are stronger in her Martian form, because she can fully focus on them.[115]\n\nBrain blast: Miss Martian was able to project a powerful \"Mental blast\" than can hit the target mentally or leave it unconscious.[25]\n\nPsychic illusion: Miss Martian can project realistic illusions in other people's minds. She was able to project an illusion in J'onns minds to make him believe than he was burning.[25]\n\nMind control: Miss Martian can control the thoughts and actions of others. Miss Martian was able to implant words in Professor Ojo's mind before he could expose Superboy's cover.[3] She was also able to erase or restore and alter the memory of others,[43] reprogram other people's minds[28] and put others to sleep[70] or temporarily paralyze others.[73]\n\nMental detection: Miss Martian can feel and detect the mind of others, as when she detects Psimon's presence or when she felt Superboy's pain.[43][25]\n\nMultilingualism: Miss Martian can speak Martian and English.[43] She can also translate languages psychically, such as Atlantean.[44]\n\nPsychic shield: Miss Martian was able to generate \"Mental shield\" in her and other people's minds to prevent mental intrusions.[43]\n\nMemory manipulation: Miss Martian is able to cause great pain and put enemies in a catatonic state while forcefully tearing memories from their minds, like when she probed Aqualad's mind. She is also able to reverse this process by fixing lost memories.\n\nTelekinesis: Miss Martian has used telekinesis to move and manipulate many objects with her mind. However, she can lose control when moving too many objects at once or not paying enough attention.[42] Miss Martian has shown the ability to generate telekinetic shields[11][43] and shock-waves.[47][17]\n\nFlight: By telekinetically moving herself, she can simulate flight.[111]\n\nAbilities[]\n\nHand-to-hand combatant: Like all of the original members of the Team, she received hand-to-hand training from Black Canary.[35] It came in useful during a fight with Cheshire while her powers were disabled by an inhibitor collar.[73]\n\nEquipment[]\n\nOrganic Clothing: M'gann wears organic clothing that can change size, shape and colour in response to her mental commands.[1]\n\nVehicles[]\n\nBio-Ship: M'gann's personal techno-organic ship used by the Team for transportation. While on standby, it resembles a giant egg. Once a Martian initializes it with a mental command, the Bio-Ship instantly morphs. The interior and exterior can be reconfigured to accommodate the situation, such as providing seats for extra passengers. The ship can activate a camouflage mode and become practically invisible.[1] After 10 years together, Bio-Ship decided to retire and go back to Mars to live out the rest of her days.[31]\n\nBaby: Baby is Bio-Ship's offspring and M'gann's new personal ship following Bio-Ship's decision to retire. Baby has all of Bio-Ship's memories and contains weapons.[102]\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nHeat: Miss Martian can be weakened when exposed to direct heat or fire.[46][51]\n\nExtreme pressure: Miss Martian's physiology is susceptible to pressure. When she went to Atlantis, the underwater pressure caused her to shrink in size.[44]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMartian Manhunter[]\n\nMain article: Martian Manhunter\n\nMiss Martian is one of Martian Manhunter's nieces. He has many hundreds of nephews and nieces, and had not met M'gann until June, when she stowed away on his ship.[32] However, she claimed they shared a close familial bond.[15]\n\nSuperboy[]\n\nMain article: Superboy\n\nMain article: Miss Martian and Superboy\n\nMiss Martian developed a crush on Superboy during the first time they met, evidently showing it by changing her shirt to match his.[26] After several close encounters,[42][2] they eventually became a couple.[3][51]\n\nThe relationship became strained when Miss Martian started to use her telepathy to extract information from their enemies, leaving them in a catatonic state. The last straw came when she attempted to telepathically alter his memories.[81] He was still angry at her whenever she used her powers like that,[69] and was uncomfortable with seeing her with her new boyfriend, Lagoon Boy.[67]\n\nBoth still loved each other,[81] and M'gann ended her fling with Lagoon Boy, admitting he was just a rebound.[21] Seeing Superboy was right all along about using her powers, she stopped using her harsh telepathic methods[23] and was exceedingly remorseful for trying to alter his memories.[98] They grew closer, but on a mission to Mars Conner became scared and distant again. They finally mended their relationship, both apologizing and confessing their love, when Psimon trapped them inside M'gann's deeply troubled mind.[81] Two years later, Conner proposed to M'gann and she accepted.[82]\n\nThe couple finally prepared to tie the knot by travelling to Mars to hold a traditional wedding ceremony until Superboy sacrificed himself to save the Martian species, leaving Miss Martian deeply devastated and heartbroken by his loss.[79][102] However, unbeknownst to M'gann, Conner survived the explosion and was sent to the Phantom Zone in a desperate last resort to save him by Phantom Girl. Superboy suffers whilst trapped in the Zone, falling victim to Zone-Sickness and the influence of General Dru-Zod, but still retains his love for Miss Martian as his last connection.\n\nMonths later, Miss Martian finally comes to learn of Superboy's survival and sets out to rescue him from the Phantom Zone and the Zods.[107] After restoring his memories and the House of Zod are defeated, Miss Martian and Superboy are at last reunited and not long after, the couple finally get married in a private ceremony with all their friends and family present.[24]\n\nKid Flash[]\n\nMain article: Kid Flash\n\nKid Flash initially had a crush on Miss Martian. He frequently flirted with her and tried to impress her, although she had not shown much indication of returning his affection, and frequently seemed uncertain how to respond to his comments.\n\nRobin has commented that Kid Flash's attempts bordered on \"creepy\".[15] For some time, he was unaware that Miss Martian was dating Superboy,[46] and was disheartened when he found out from Artemis.[54]\n\nAqualad[]\n\nMain article: Aqualad\n\nAqualad is Miss Martian's teammate and an earnest friend. Miss Martian looked up to him like an older brother.[13]\n\nWhen Aqualad infiltrated the Light and \"killed\" Artemis, Miss Martian was saddened by his actions. She soon encountered him on the Reach's ship, where she condemned him as a murderer for his actions and used a mental blast on him. She was shocked to discover that he was really undercover and that Artemis was still alive which left her in a heartbroken state.[18]\n\nAfter her capture by Black Manta, she was forced to repair Kaldur's mind, M'gann still had lingering guilt upon entering his mind. Very soon, M'gann only overcame her guilt when Artemis brought Aqualad to her and Miss Martian apologized to him. With that she began restoring his mind, making significant progress.[72] Afterwards, she succeeded in bringing him back to his proper mindset and they worked together in escaping his father and other threats.[73]\n\nArtemis[]\n\nMain article: Artemis\n\nWhen Artemis first joined the Team, Miss Martian was eager for a \"sister\" to bond with. The two both crushed on Superboy from the start, and Artemis's openness lead to some anger on M'gann's part[36] but they soon settled the matter—though Artemis still tried to hook Miss Martian up with Aqualad to keep Superboy for herself.[13] Artemis was at first unaware M'gann and Superboy were a couple,[51] and was agitated when Zatanna clued her in.[32]\n\nThe friendship between them remained strong throughout the years, when Miss Martian happily greeted Artemis when she returned to the Team. She was devastated when believing Artemis had been killed to the point she attacked Aqualad to avenge her, only was shocked to learn her demise was staged to infiltrate the Light.[17][18] When Miss Martian was tasked to heal Aqualad's mind, Artemis helped her to come to terms and face her guilt over her actions.[20]\n\nIn the aftermath of Superboy's death after his sacrifice on Mars, Artemis was greatly saddened and sympathized for M'gann, aware of the pain and heartbreak due to her own experience in losing Wally.[116] When Artemis and the original team uncover the truth of Conner's survival and imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, Artemis had reservations about keeping the truth hidden from M'gann and not including her in the rescue mission.[117] When Superboy is saved and the couple reunited, Artemis serves as one of M'gann's bridesmaids at the wedding.[24]\n\nLagoon Boy[]\n\nMain article: Lagoon Boy\n\nMain article: Lagoon Boy and Miss Martian\n\nAfter breaking up with Superboy, she began dating Lagoon Boy. They were honest about their relationship, showing it by kissing in front of everyone, unlike M'gann's previous and private relationship with Conner.[67] Both felt comfort in each other.[65] M'gann decided to end the relationship because he could never be anything more than a rebound guy for her, and she felt he deserved better.[21]\n\nBeast Boy[]\n\nMain article: Beast Boy\n\nAfter a blood transfusion saved his life when he was eight, Garfield Logan considered M'gann his blood-sister.[25] Their bond became stronger after Marie's death, and have treated each other as siblings ever since.[12]\n\nMa'alefa'ak[]\n\nMain article: Ma'alefa'ak\n\nMa'alefa'ak is Miss Martian's younger brother. Growing up, M'gann and M'comm were constantly bullied and faced racial prejudice by the Green and Red Martians with M'gann often defending her brother, who came to see her as his rock. Due to being the only White Martians among the rest of their siblings, M'gann and M'comm were very close.[23] However, when M'gann left Mars for Earth, M'comm felt personally betrayed by his sister for leaving him behind, causing a severe strain on their relationship.[27]\n\nWhen Ma'alefa'ak began to cause havoc on New Genesis to gain favor with Apokolips to support his White Martian uprising, Miss Martian vowed to stop him if he continued down this path. Although M'gann tried to reason with M'comm by reminding him of their past bond and showing him love is stronger than hate, he refused and escaped, but not before enacting failsafes, resulting in the deaths of two meta-human teens in his care, much to M'gann's horror.[23]\n\nIn 2020, the siblings were reunited once more when Miss Martian returned to Mars to marry Superboy.[79] The relationship between them remained strained, but they briefly reconnected when M'gann began to understand M'comm's feelings of betrayal and abandonment.[27] M'gann attempted to make amends with M'comm and urged him to reconcile with their family, though he rejected her efforts.[31]\n\nFollowing the apparent death of Superboy after his sacrifice stopped Ma'alefa'ak's gene-bomb, whatever remained of the siblings relationship was destroyed. Miss Martian sought revenge against her brother, who showed no remorse over his role in Conner's death, but confessed to having no knowledge about the Kryptonite.[103] When Ma'alefa'ak came to learn the truth of Superboy's death after meeting Lor-Zod, he expressed his personal gratitude, taking pleasure over the pain and devastation it brought to his sister.[118]\n\nAfter the truth of Superboy's survival and imprisonment in the Phantom Zone was uncovered, Ma'alefa'ak interfered with Miss Martian's plan to rescue him and allied himself with the House of Zod, the ones truly responsible for the attempt on Superboy's life and the couple's separation.[107][108] In the last stand, M'comm was banished to the Phantom Zone, but not before M'gann linked with her brother and angrily revealed her awareness that he was glad Conner was \"dead\", effectively dissolving their sibling bond for good.[24]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nBackground information[]\n\nIn the comics, while Miss Martian did somewhat attempt to hide the fact that she was a White Martian from her fellow Teen Titans, she never made the claim of being the Martian Manhunter's niece. This was a plot point introduced solely for Young Justice.\n\nYoung Justice marks Miss Martian's first animated appearance."
