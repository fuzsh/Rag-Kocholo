        "text": "Hi guys!\n\nSo Im gonna shortly explain whats happening to my phone, and you all can take your conclusions about what the problem could be.\n\nMy s3 was working fine until a few hours ago, when me friend called me. When he hung up, my phone was frozen already. No response at all... I held the power button to perform a 'reset', but it is frozen now on the first splash screen. Tried removing battery, everything.\n\nAfter a few searches and few topics (http://forums.androidcentral.com/sa...alaxy-s3-frozen-start-screen-help-please.html), got a conclusion that I am another victim of the SUDDEN DEATH SYNDROME that have been affecting many users on UK.\n\nHowever... I dont think I really qualify into this category, since I can turn my phone on, and get into the Recovery mode.\n\nNow thats the funny part. My recovery mode seems very messed up.\n\nThere are many lines of code saying\n\n'E: failed to mount/\n\nE: cant mount/\n\nE:Cant open'\n\netc etc\n\nSomeone give me some instructions on what to do please!\n\nCheers\n\nHere's an overview of what to do:\n\n- if you don't already have the Kies software installed on your PC, download it (just search Google) and install it. The first time it runs it'll update itself to the latest version so make sure you run it once before proceeding.\n\n- put your phone in Download mode: with the phone completely off, press and hold the Volume Down and Home and Power buttons simultaneously, and release them all when you see the Samsung splash screen\n\n- connect the phone to your PC with the USB cable that came with the phone\n\n-- if you've never had the phone connected to your Windows-based computer before, you'll see messages about installing drivers, etc - just wait until this is done (may take 5 or 10 minutes) [I don't know what happens if you have a Mac - it probably just works]\n\n- in the Kies software, select the second item in the Tools menu and just follow the prompts to enter the model number (in CAPS) and IMEI/Serial Number (both found under the battery - it's ok to remove the battery at this point)\n\n- the Kies software should start downloading the correct firmware for your phone from the Internet; once that's done (depending on your Internet connection speed) it'll begin downloading that to the phone (this probably takes 10 minutes or so)\n\nSent from my rooted, debloated, deodexed Sinclair ZX-80 running CM 10.2 using Tapatalk 4\n\nHere's an overview of what to do:\n\n- if you don't already have the Kies software installed on your PC, download it (just search Google) and install it.

Hope it works!\n\n-------\n\nedit: it is frozen on 0% after downloading and decompressing/decrypting the firmware... has been more than 10minutes... should i be worried about???\n\nWell it won't hurt anything to try again, but it doesn't sound promising. I've done this several times to my phone just to get the process down and have never encountered an error. Of course, your phone was having problems reading from memory so something may be messed up.\n\nYou could try using Odin to load a ROM (stock; rooted; or a 3rd party ROM) but that's a bit more involved, and you HAVE TO BE SURE you select the correct file for your model/carrier. I don't want to try that route since it can lead to a totally unusable device.\n\nSo I'd suggest just contacting your carrier or Samsung to see if you can get a warranty replacement (if I'm not mistaken the warranty on the International version is two years). Sorry.\n\nSent from my rooted, debloated, deodexed Sinclair ZX-80 running CM 10.2 using Tapatalk 4\n\nJust updating you guys:\n\n-I brought my phone into Vodafone yesterday. The guy tried to fix my phone by using ODIN, but it didnt work for some reason, and he doesnt know what could be the reasons for that. Unfortunately i cant send it to Samsung because i have a cracked screen. =/ he believes that something very nasty happened to the flash.\n\n-My phone is at the moment in some repair shop, where the guy guaranteed me that he can fix it by Tuesday.\n\nLets just wait now and see what happens.\n\nFinally got a message:\n\n\"FIRMWARE EMERGENCY RECOVERY STOPPED DUE TO GALAXY S3 ERROR. IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTS, PLEASE CONTACT THE SAMSUNG SERVICE CENTRE\"\n\nWhat should i do?!\n\nShould I try one more time?\n\nI got the same problem. I try to do a factory restore using Kies, and I get the same message. My phone did an autoupdate to Android 4.3, screwed everything up, and softbricked when I tried to use Odin to downgrade, using some tutorials online. I can get to the Downloading mode screen, but that's about it.\n\nand softbricked when I tried to use Odin to downgrade, using some tutorials online.\n\nI don't know what tutorials you were looking at, but according to the folks on XDA it's not possible to downgrade once the phone has 4.3 on it.\n\nYou can try checking http://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/ to see if they've released 4.3 firmware for your model/carrier, and perhaps you can use Odin to reload that and get the phone running again.\n\nSent from my rooted, debloated, deodexed Sinclair ZX-80 running CM -0.001 using Tapatalk Pro"
