Differences in rates of death per 100 patients between covid-19 and seasonal influenza were most pronounced in people over 75 years of age with chronic kidney disease or dementia and those with black race and obesity, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease.\n\nConclusions Among people admitted to hospital, compared with seasonal influenza, covid-19 was associated with increased risk of extrapulmonary organ dysfunction, death, and increased health resource use. The findings may inform the global discussion about the comparative risks of covid-19 and seasonal influenza and may help the ongoing effort to manage the covid-19 global pandemic.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) global pandemic might be the most challenging health crisis of our lifetime. The number of infected people and number of deaths continue to grow worldwide.1 Comparisons of clinical manifestations and mortality between covid-19 and seasonal influenza have been drawn by public health officials, policy makers, and the public at large. However, these comparisons have so far relied on data and mortality statistics obtained by disparate methods and are not based on an “apples with apples” comparison.2 A robust comparative approach would allow stakeholders to develop a deeper understanding of the health risks of covid-19 (compared with the well known seasonal influenza) and to anticipate demand for healthcare services and project mortality with greater accuracy.\n\nIn this study, we leveraged the breadth and depth of the electronic healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which operates the largest nationally integrated healthcare delivery system in the US, to do a comparative evaluation of clinical manifestations and outcomes among US veterans admitted to hospital with covid-19 and seasonal influenza. This approach provides a comparative assessment between covid-19 and seasonal influenza and will inform the global discussion and effort to manage current and future waves of this global pandemic in which some waves might spatiotemporally coincide with seasonal influenza.\n\nMethods\n\nSetting\n\nWe used the electronic healthcare databases of the US Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates the largest nationally integrated healthcare system in the United States—a veteran specific national health service—to discharged veterans of the US armed forces. The US Department of Veterans Affairs provides care at 1255 healthcare facilities, including 170 VA medical centers (hospital systems) and 1074 outpatient sites of care of varying complexity (Veterans Health Administration outpatient clinics) to more than nine million veterans enrolled in the VA. All enrolled veterans have access to the Department of Veterans Affairs’ comprehensive medical benefits package including inpatient hospital care; outpatient services; preventive, primary, and specialty care; prescriptions; mental healthcare; home healthcare; geriatric and extended care; medical equipment; and prosthetics.\n\nCohort\n\nWe selected patients from the Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system with a positive laboratory test result for influenza between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019 (n=54 281) or with a positive laboratory test for covid-19 between 1 February 2020 and 17 June 2020 (n=9125). We identified patients with a hospital admission between five days before and 30 days after the positive test result (n=12 748 in seasonal influenza group; n=3641 in covid-19 group). For participants with both seasonal influenza and covid-19 hospital admission records (n=72), we used their first covid-19 admission records in the analyses. The final cohort consisted of 16 317 participants, including 12 676 participants in the seasonal influenza group and 3641 participants in the covid-19 group (supplementary figure S1). We defined time zero as the date of admission to hospital and followed participants until the first occurrence of 60 days after admission, death, or end of study follow-up (17 June 2020). After 60 days of follow-up, 168 (1.33%) patients in the seasonal influenza group and 76 (2.08%) patients in the covid-19 group remained in hospital. The probability of patients remaining in hospital in the two groups is provided in supplementary figure S2.\n\nData sources\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) provided electronic health records from participants enrolled in the VA healthcare system.3456 We used the CDW laboratory results domain to collect laboratory test information and the CDW inpatient encounters domains to collect information including diagnoses, procedures, and other aspects of healthcare use during a hospital admission.7 We used the CDW pharmacy domain and CDW bar code medication administration domain to collect medication data and the CDW vital signs domain to collect vital measurements. We collected demographic information from the CDW patient domain and VA vital status database, as well as disease history from both the CDW inpatient encounter and outpatient encounter domains.8910\n\nExposures\n\nExposures in the study were admission to hospital with seasonal influenza and admission to hospital with covid-19, defined on the basis of a positive laboratory test result for seasonal influenza or covid-19 with a hospital admission within five days before the test or within 30 days after the test.\n\nOutcomes\n\nThe primary outcome of the study was time until death since hospital admission. We defined clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury, incident renal replacement therapy, incident insulin use, severe septic shock, vasopressor use, pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis, stroke, acute myocarditis, arrythmias and sudden cardiac death, elevated troponin, elevated aspartate aminotransferase, elevated alanine aminotransferase, and rhabdomyolysis by using definitions based on laboratory data and diagnostic and procedure codes.61112131415161718 Outcomes related to healthcare use included time until mechanical ventilation, time until admission to intensive care unit (ICU), and length of stay in hospital, which we defined as days from admission until first discharge among patients discharged from hospital.\n\nCovariates\n\nCovariates in the study included demographics such as age, race (white, black, and other), and sex; history of diseases such as chronic lung disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease; history of use of drugs such as statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; smoking status (never, former, and current); and estimated glomerular filtration rate and body mass index (underweight <18.50, normal ≥18.50-<25, overweight ≥25-<30, and obese ≥30) calculated from height and weight. We ascertained disease history during the year before admission to hospital and defined outpatient drug use by a record of prescription that provided medication within the 30 days before the admission. We selected estimated glomerular filtration rate and body mass index from the measurement before and closest to the admission. When values of covariates were missing (0.18% of age, 2.56% of estimated glomerular filtration rate, and 2.02% of body mass index), we applied mean imputation.\n\nWe also collected vital signs at admission, including heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, blood oxygen concentration, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and laboratory measurements including white blood cell count, hemoglobin, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen, platelet count, bicarbonate, and lymphocyte percentage, on the basis of measurements during the hospital admission and closest to admission date and time."
