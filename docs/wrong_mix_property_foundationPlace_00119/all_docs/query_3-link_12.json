        "text": "Survival for testicular cancer is very high. Nearly all men survive their disease.\n\nSurvival depends on many factors, so no one can tell you exactly how long youâ€™ll live. It depends on your individual condition, type of cancer, treatment and level of fitness.\n\nYour doctor can give you more information about your own outlook (prognosis).\n\nYou can also talk about this to the Cancer Research UK nurses on freephone 0808 800 4040, from 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.\n\nSurvival for all stages of testicular cancer\n\nThe outlook for testicular cancer is one of the best for all cancers. Nearly all men survive their disease.\n\nGenerally in England:\n\nmore than 95 out of 100 men (more than 95%) will survive their cancer for 1 year or more after they are diagnosed\n\n95 out of 100 men (95%) will survive their cancer for 5 years or more after diagnosis\n\naround 90 out of 100 men (around 90%) will survive their cancer for 10 years or more after diagnosis\n\nSurvival if the cancer has spread\n\nResearchers and doctors use a system to try and predict your outlook. This is for testicular cancer that has spread. Your outlook might be defined as:\n\ngood prognosis\n\nintermediate prognosis\n\npoor prognosis\n\nYour prognosis is worked out slightly differently, depending on whether you have:\n\npure seminoma testicular cancer\n\nnon seminoma testicular cancer\n\nNo UK-wide survival statistics are available for testicular cancer that has spread. The survival statistics below are from a large international study.\n\nPure seminoma\n\nPure seminoma means that there are no teratoma cells in the tumour. You will have normal Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) marker levels if you have pure seminoma.\n\nThere are two categories of outlook for pure seminoma testicular cancer. These are good prognosis and intermediate prognosis. No one with pure seminoma is classified as having a poor prognosis.\n\nGood prognosis\n\n95 out of every 100 men (95%) survive for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed\n\nMost men have a good prognosis. Good prognosis means that the seminoma has spread only to the lymph nodes or the lungs. It has not spread anywhere else.\n\nIntermediate prognosis\n\nalmost 90 out of every 100 men (almost 90%) survive for 5 years or more after diagnosis\n\nIntermediate prognosis means that the seminoma has spread beyond the lung or lymph nodes. It has spread to other parts of the body, such as the brain or liver.\n\nNon seminoma\n\nThere are three categories of outlook for non seminoma testicular cancer that has spread. These are good prognosis, intermediate prognosis and poor prognosis.\n\nGood prognosis\n\naround 95 out of every 100 men (around 95%) survive for 5 years or more after they are diagnosed\n\nGood prognosis means that your primary cancer was in your testicle, or at the back of your stomach or abdomen (retroperitoneal). It may have spread to the lungs or lymph nodes, but has not spread to anywhere else in your body. Your markers are only slightly above normal (S1 in the TNM staging system).\n\nIntermediate prognosis\n\naround 90 out of every 100 men (around 90%) survive for 5 years or more after diagnosis\n\nIntermediate prognosis is the same as good prognosis. But your markers are higher. They are moderately above normal (S2 in the TNM staging system).\n\nPoor prognosis\n\nmore than 65 out of 100 men (more than 65%) will survive for 5 years or more after diagnosis\n\nPoor prognosis means that:\n\nthe primary cancer started in your chest (mediastinum) or\n\nthe cancer has spread to somewhere in your body other than the lungs or lymph nodes, such as the liver or brain\n\nYou may also be in this category if your marker levels are high (S3 in the TNM staging system).\n\nWhat affects survival\n\nYour outlook depends on the stage of the cancer when it was diagnosed. This means:\n\nwhether it has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of your body\n\nthe level of certain substances (tumour markers) in your blood\n\nThe type and size of your testicular cancer also affects your likely survival.\n\nAbout these statistics\n\nThe terms 1 year survival and 5 year survival don't mean that you will only live for 1 or 5 years.\n\nThe NHS, other health organisations, and researchers collect information. They watch what happens to people with cancer in the years after their diagnosis. 5 years is a common time point to measure survival. But some people live much longer than this.\n\n5 year survival is the number of people who have not died from their cancer within 5 years after diagnosis.\n\nClinical trials\n\nTaking part in clinical trials can help to improve the outlook for people with testicular cancer.\n\nMore statistics\n\nYou can read more statistics on survival rates and other factors for testicular cancer in our Cancer Statistics section."
