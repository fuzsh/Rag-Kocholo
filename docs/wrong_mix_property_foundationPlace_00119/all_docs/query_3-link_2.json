        "text": "S3 Replication metrics provide detailed metrics for the replication rules in your replication configuration. With replication metrics, you can monitor minute-by-minute progress by tracking bytes pending, operations pending, operations that failed replication, and replication latency.\n\nS3 Replication metrics are turned on automatically when you enable S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC). You can also enable S3 Replication metrics independently of S3 RTC while creating or editing a rule. S3 RTC includes other features, such as a service level agreement (SLA) and notifications for missed thresholds. For more information, see Meeting compliance requirements using S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).\n\nThe bytes pending, operations pending, and replication-latency metrics apply only to new objects that are replicated with S3 Cross-Region Replication (S3 CRR) or S3 Same-Region Replication (S3 SRR). The operations failing replication metric tracks both new objects that are replicated with S3 CRR or S3 SRR and existing objects that are replicated with S3 Batch Replication. To assist in troubleshooting any configuration issues, you can also set up Amazon S3 Event Notifications to receive replication-failure events.\n\nWhen enabled, S3 Replication metrics publish the following metrics to Amazon CloudWatch:\n\nIf a job fails to run at all, metrics are not sent to Amazon CloudWatch. For example, your job won't run if you don't have the necessary permissions to run an S3 Batch Replication job, or if the tags or prefix in your replication configuration don't match.\n\nEnabling S3 Replication metrics\n\nYou can start using S3 Replication metrics with a new or existing replication rule. You can choose to apply your replication rule to an entire S3 bucket, or to Amazon S3 objects with a specific prefix or tag.\n\nThis topic provides instructions for enabling S3 Replication metrics in your replication configuration when the source and destination buckets are owned by the same or different AWS accounts.\n\nTo enable replication metrics by using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), you must add a replication configuration to the source bucket with Metrics enabled. In this example configuration, objects under the prefix Tax are replicated to the destination bucket DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET, and metrics are generated for those objects.\n\n{ \"Rules\": [ { \"Status\": \"Enabled\", \"Filter\": { \"Prefix\": \"Tax\" }, \"Destination\": { \"Bucket\": \"arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET\", \"Metrics\": { \"Status\": \"Enabled\" } }, \"Priority\": 1 } ], \"Role\": \"IAM-Role-ARN\" }\n\nFor full instructions on creating replication rules, see Configuring replication for source and destination buckets owned by the same account.\n\nFor more information about viewing replication metrics in the S3 console, see Viewing replication metrics by using the Amazon S3 console.\n\nReceiving replication failure events with Amazon S3 Event Notifications\n\nS3 Event Notifications can notify you in instances when objects don't replicate to their destination AWS Region. Amazon S3 events are available through Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), or AWS Lambda. For more information, see Amazon S3 Event Notifications.\n\nFor a list of failure codes captured by S3 Event Notifications, see Amazon S3 replication failure reasons.\n\nViewing replication metrics with S3 Storage Lens"
