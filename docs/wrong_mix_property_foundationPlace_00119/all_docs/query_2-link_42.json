Last warning, there are major spoilers for the season three finale ahead!\n\nWATCH: Miss Derry Girls already? Relive the best moments of season two here\n\nAfter getting kicked out of the party, it's revealed that Claire's dad Sean, played by David Ireland, has suffered an aneurysm.

In the show's final moments, Erin, Claire, Orla, Michelle and James are seen attending Sean's funeral as a slowed-down cover of Praise You plays.\n\nMORE: Derry Girls fans react to major romantic moment between Erin and James\n\nMORE: Big Boys: everything you need to know Derry Girls star Dylan Llewellynâ€™s new show\n\nIt's an unexpected end to a show that has always found the light in the darkness of being set against the backdrop of the Troubles, but speaking at a Q&A session attended HELLO!, creator Lisa McGee revealed that the storyline was inspired by something that really happened to her and her own 'Derry Girls'.\n\nClaire's dad Sean is played by David Ireland\n\n\"The reason why I wanted to do this story is because it happened to my group of friends,\" she said. \"My friend's dad died when we were around that age suddenly and it was a shock.\"\n\nShe continued: \"The thing that really struck me was that we did grow up in this place where there was a lot of unpredictable stuff happening - you worried about a lot of violence - and this was a thing that could happen to anybody at any point - a natural cause thing. I was like 'Oh, God, no one's life's predictable, this could happen to anyone.'\"\n\nWhat did you think of the ending of the series?\n\nShe explained that \"something shifted in my wee friendship group when that happened\" and likewise wanted the death of Claire's father to mark the end of adolescence for the gang. \"It says in the stage directions when they're walking behind the coffin: 'And just like that, they grew up'\". We're not crying, you are!\n\nMORE: Nicola Coughlan gets candid about reduced role in Derry Girls season three\n\nShe added that she felt comfortable ending things on such a sombre note as \"Channel 4 reassured me that the special would go out close to it and it wasn't going to leave everyone depressed.\""
