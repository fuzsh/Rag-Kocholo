Jim Spitler, sector commander for the USCG in San Diego, said, âOur thoughts are with the family and friends of the missing passengers.â\n\nShane Garner Obituary And Death: Airplane Crash California Update\n\nDuring a U.S. Navy training exercise, a Phoenix Air Learjet 36 crashed off the coast, killing three individuals.\n\nThe deceased has been identified as Eric Tatman, Spencer Geerlings, and Shane Garner, all employed by Phoenix Air, a Georgia-based private company.\n\nSan Clemente Island, where the crash occurred, is owned and managed by the Navy.\n\nThe Phoenix Air Learjet 36 was one of two planes participating in the military training exercise.\n\nAccording to Phoenix Air, the planes were conducting a series of flight profiles to support U.S. Navy fleet preparedness as part of a carefully planned military exercise in a restricted area.\n\nThe company also stated that it has been conducting readiness training as a contractor for the Navy and the Department of Defense for over 20 years.\n\nWhile one jet landed safely, the other crashed into the ocean roughly one-mile southwest of San Clemente Island.\n\nThe Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection crews found Debris in the water.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the Learjet crashed into the Pacific Ocean approximately one mile from a Navy-owned island near San Diego.\n\nThe Coast Guard, along with the Navy, Air Force, and Customs and Border Protection, conducted a search operation covering 334 square miles in the surrounding area on Wednesday after the Phoenix Air Learjet crashed in the morning.\n\nHopefully, the reason behind the death and the crash of the Plane will be disclosed among the public who has been following the news.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board just confirmed that it is investigating the incident, but so far, there have been no more updates on the investigation.\n\nYou may be interested in: Ãngel Eduardo Maradiaga Espinoza Death And Obituary: Migrant Teen Dies In Custody In Florida\n\nncG1vNJzZmiflaO2tr%2FCnqOemqNjsLC5jqyfmqaVYrSivs2eqWankp7Btq3RsmY%3D"
