        "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for the third season of Stranger Things! Please stop reading if you haven't seen the season yet (although I'm not sure what you're waiting for at this point).\n\nStranger Things has a great roster of intriguing characters on its cast, but much to fans' chagrin, a good number of those characters tend to meet a grisly end on the show (#JusticeForBarb forever). It can be hard to keep up with who has died on which season, and with the premiere of season three last week, you might need a quick recap of the season.\n\nHere's a list of everyone who died on Stranger Things 3.\n\nBruce is one of the journalists at The Hawkins Post, and he basically spent his entire time on screen belittling Nancy for her journalistic ideas.\n\nBruce is later turned into a member of The Flayed, and when Nancy and Jonathan turn up at the Hawkins Memorial Hospital to try and find the Mind Flayer's new hideout, he tries to kill them. However, Nancy ends up victorious, and she crushes his skill with a fire extinguisher.\n\nAlexei was a man of simple needs: just a cherry Slurpee and a Whopper from Burger King. He was also a Russian scientist working on the machine below the Starcourt Mall that would create gates to the Upside Down.\n\nHopper and Joyce basically kidnapped Alexei in order to get answers about what was going on around Hawkins, and with the help of Murray, who speaks Russian, they were able to figure out a way to close the gate.\n\nUnfortunately, Alexei was killed at the Hawkins Fun Fair. Murray had left him unattended, and Grigori, one of the Russian soldiers, fatally shot Alexei."
