        "text": "When VH1 announced that Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart were teaming up for a cooking show, it sounded like something that had been dreamed up after a few too many hits of the former's cannabis products. After all what commonalities could possibly exist between the 47-year-old California-bred rapper, as well known for his rhythms as his unabashed love of weed and the Westchester-based domestic doyenne thirty years his elder?\n\nTurns out, quite a bit as the unlikely pair premiere the third season of their Emmy-nominated show tonight—a consistent perfect rating on Rotten Tomatoes—albeit in a slightly different conceit that has celebrities battling it out in the kitchen. (For the kickoff this evening at 10 p.m., Matthew McConaughey and Method Man face off to see who can craft the better 4/20-related munchies and Isla Fisher steps in as guest judge.)\n\n\"I like his laid-back energy. I like his outspokenness. I like his sense of timing,\" Stewart raved of her costar during a Today appearance yesterday to promote Martha & Snoop's Potluck Party Challenge. \"And I really, I actually like to watch him cook. I mean he's so particularly, his little tiny bits of this and that, and it all finally comes together.\"\n\nContinued the musician, \"She was loose as a goose, high as a motherf--ker, and she went up there and killed it...She came back and sat next to me, and I said, 'Martha, you see what I did for you? We need to do more things together.'\"\n\nIt was a thought that also occurred to producer SallyAnn Salsano. On the hunt for a unique half-hour cooking show heavy on the pop culture, the architect behind Jersey Shore, approached the duo's agents, certain she'd landed on a winner.\n\n\"Martha and Snoop genuinely know each other,\" she explained to Adweek. \"It wasn't like one of those crazy Hollywood random pairings where they just throw people together. They were each looking out for the other side, like a unified front.\"\n\nThe pitch was for a series that included \"lots of funny talk, silly games, and actual recipes,\" Stewart would later describe to Architectural Digest, a format that saw the twosome whipping up their own versions of a dish with help from celeb pals in between swilling cocktails (\"I feed them to Snoop, who's not really a drinker, so he gets totally drunk off of them,\" she told Town & Country) and game play.\n\nWith both halves of the duo signed on, they quickly got to work in 2016, tapping guests such as Seth Rogen, Ice Cube, Ashley Graham and Wiz Khalifia to join them for five days of shooting in L.A. before Snoop resumed his High Road Tour.\n\nDespite the scramble, Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party was a resounding success when it debuted that fall to 2.3 million viewers (the top premiere for a new cable unscripted franchise that year), earning an Emmy nod for best host for a reality or reality-competition program. (The pair lost to RuPaul.)\n\n\"I've never met anyone like Martha Stewart,\" Snoop told Rolling Stone of the bond they'd formed across years of joint appearances. \"When we come together, it's a natural combination of love, peace and harmony.\"\n\nNot to mention an interesting study in contrasts. While Stewart introduced Snoop to eclectic dishes such as cow tongue tacos and how to use a pizza oven to make a pie from scratch, he demonstrated the art of employing barbecue chips as breading for fried chicken wings.\n\nAfter all, this is a woman who's admitted to sexting and paying a visit to a nude beach, someone who's made as much effort to fit into Snoop's world as he has into hers, adding bling to her decidedly minimalist wardrobe and words like \"fo shizzle\" and \"crack-a-lackin\" to her vocabulary.\n\n\"They have the same interests,\" said Salsano, \"and they like each other.\"\n\nThe pair do employ some boundaries. As Snoop put it to Us Weekly of season one, \"We only smoked the meat!\", noting he reserved his \"pleasures\" for his trailer: \"On the set, I'm a businessman.\"\n\nAnd though Stewart has admitted to taste testing some edibles, she makes it a point to steer clear of Snoop's trailer for fear of another hot box scenario. \"I made a pact early on doing this show that I would never enter Snoop's domain, his trailer,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter. \"I've never gone as far as the first steps into his trailer.\"\n\nNot that she judges his particular predilections. \"So someone smokes marijuana? Big deal! People smoke cigarettes and die from cancer. I haven't heard of anybody dying from cannabis,\" she noted to the outlet. \"I'm quite egalitarian and liberal when it comes to stuff like that.\"\n\nSo much so that she's considered getting into the business herself, taking note of the success the From Crook to Cook author has had from his line of products."
