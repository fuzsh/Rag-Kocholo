        "text": "I never expected to enjoy a 2016 Snoop Dogg concert as much as I enjoyed his 100-minute set at Oak Mountain Amphitheater on Saturday.\n\nSnoop is 45 now, and it's been 23 years since the release of his debut, Doggystyle. The records since have been...hit or miss. There were a few released on No Limit, Master P's New Orleans based label that was as uniquely 90s as the Arch Deluxe and Sam Goody. Since, his biggest hits have come via verses on tracks by other artists - Katy Perry's \"California Gurls\" and DJ Khaled's \"All I Do Is Win\" among them.\n\nThe MERRY JANE presents The High Road Tour was glued together with DJs, and on the surface, that seems like a recipe for a bad hip-hop show. Too often, when reliant on their DJs, hip-hop artists allow prerecorded vocals to seep into the performance. And that wasn't necessarily different on this damp night in Pelham, but its potential was maximized to make a speculatively stale show into a fresh one.\n\nBecause Wiz Khalifa wasn't the opener, he shared the stage.\n\nSnoop Dogg took the stage first with his verse from Dr. Dre's \"The Next Episode\" following an animated short at 9:17 p.m. Fans filled the third tier of Oak Mountain Amphitheater nicely; roughly 85% of the venue's seats appeared to be sold.\n\nShortly after his first three numbers, Snoop Dogg departed the stage entirely to make room for Khalifa, who opened his portion of the set with \"Bake Sale.\" He added \"We Dem Boyz\" before passing the stage back to Snoop.\n\nThe back-and-forth continued for a few two or three song rounds before Snoop took his portion of the show to an unreachable high with a sampling of the aforementioned \"All I Do Is Win,\" \"Gin and Juice\" and his collaboration with Tupac, \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,\" complete with Tupac vocals on a backing track.\n\nFrom that point forward, the two men shared the stage. And Snoop did a few newer, lesser tracks, but Wiz's remaining presence gave this old Dogg a kind of credibility that he hasn't enjoyed in a while. A lot of it is Snoop's own doing - trying to figure out how to remain relevant in a profession that has not yet seen its practitioners grow old and maintain. Maybe this is that answer. With Wiz Khalifa at his side, nothing ever seemed corny or contrived. Not even the backing track from the DJ, typically a dagger into the heart of the live hip-hop show.\n\nFor a production dubbed MERRY JANE presents The High Road Tour, it was incredibly rehearsed, calculated, precise and punctual. The screens advertised an interactive phone app that could allow fans a more complete experience and the time between sets saw those screens offering marijuana-themed trivia questions. The tour announcement itself included asterisks beside the stops where medicinal and recreational marijuana was legal.\n\nBirmingham - or Pelham, as it were - was not among those.\n\nBut that didn't stop Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa from, apparently, enjoying marijuana on stage. Or from sharing it with fans on the front row. But then, every conversation that the two men had was incredibly rehearsed and they nailed all of their lines. Maybe it was part of the show, or maybe they're highly functional stoners.\n\nThe show's biggest lull came when Wiz introduced a new, unreleased track of his own before bringing out an unknown Atlanta artist named JuJu Gotti to perform. The stage was filled with the \"Taylor Gang\" or people representing the brand, Wiz's production company.\n\nThe show's most unexpected moment came when the two men ran to a small stage in front of the third tier for a performance under the cover of darkness. And seemingly, all it took was another 30 second animated short to bridge the delay. Again, this marijuana-themed tour wasn't orchestrated by slackers.\n\n\"See You Again,\" the smash-hit from Furious 7, was among the night's final songs, complete with cell phones and lighters illuminating the summer night. It came on the heels of the night's lone political sentiment, from Wiz: \"I hope that we all know that whether we're black, white, gay or straight, you've gotta take care of each other and tell each other how much you love each other. Without Snoop, I wouldn't have the confidence to be skinny as [expletive] and smoke weed and it takes people like that to let you know who you are.\"\n\nThat was what I left with on Saturday. The hip-hop world that Snoop Doggy Dogg entered in 1993 was intimidating, at least to white Southerners. It was confrontational, a world where his own mentors N.W.A. made their mark by questioning authority. But 23 years later, in the midst of the most hostile and divisive political climate that our nation has seen since the Civil Rights era, in the backyard of where many of those bridges were marched and letters were penned, an incredibly diverse audience finished its evening by singing and dancing along to the track the two men recorded together, \"Young and Wild and Free.\" Marijuana was clearly a theme on this night, and so was sex. But violence and race were never remotely a part of the conversation. In Shelby County.\n\nSnoop Dogg is Generation X's Willie Nelson. His peers that survived the East Coast/West Coast feud became actors and CEOs, but not Snoop. He stayed with the game. As he ages and his platform becomes more universally acceptable, maybe he's found a way to make a craft that once intimidated into one that can unite. And maybe that will be his legacy."
