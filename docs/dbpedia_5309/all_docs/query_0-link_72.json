        "text": "Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa have teased a sequel to their stoner comedy Mac & Devin Go to High School.\n\nSnoop signaled in an Instagram post on Thursday (February 2) that another movie was on the way this summer, more than a decade after the original flick arrived back in July 2012.\n\n“High school reunion comin summer 23 @wizkhalifa,” the West Coast rap legend wrote in his post accompanied by a photo of him and Wiz in the studio together.\n\nThe Taylor Gang boss hopped into the comments section to add more fuel to the fire, while joking about his height compared to Snoop in the picture.\n\n“I literally love this n-gga,” Wiz wrote. “I look hella short bro.”\n\nIn his own Instagram post of the photo, the Pittsburgh native declared him and Snoop “the new Cheech and Chong” while using the hashtag “#highschoolreuinion.”\n\nMac & Devin Go to High School stars Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa as high school students Mac Johnson and Devin Overstreet, who bond over their love of getting high. The movie, which went straight to DVD and Blu-Ray, also features appearances from Mike Epps, Teairra Mari, Andy Milonakis, Luenell and Mystikal.\n\nAn accompanying soundtrack was released in December 2011, and was powered by Snoop and Wiz’s smash hit “Young, Wild & Free” which featured Bruno Mars. The rebellious anthem peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since been certified 6x platinum.\n\nA Mac & Devin sequel was first teased back in 2014, with Snoop Dogg promising in an Instagram post that it would arrive in January 2015. However, that date has long since come and gone.\n\nWiz Khalifa reflected on his friendship with Snoop Dogg in 2018 by showing love to the Death Row Records icon, who he hailed as a “mentor” figure.\n\n“Snoop is my homie, my homie, my mentor, my partner, my brother. It’s always good to have him involved and coaching me on,” Wiz told Build.\n\n“The main thing he always does is just make sure that I’m being myself. He’s like, ‘Wiz, you so awesome, you so cool, people love you so much. You don’t have to be like nobody. You don’t gotta be like Snoop Dogg, you don’t gotta be like this person, just always be Wiz.’ That’s the most important thing he always tells me.”\n\nSnoop and Wiz have connected on plenty of tracks outside of the Mac & Devin soundtrack including “This Weed Iz Mine,” “You and Your Friends,” “Black and Yellow (Remix)” and more."
