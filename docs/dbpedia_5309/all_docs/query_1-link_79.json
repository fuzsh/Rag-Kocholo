Daena was as mad as a brush and had a heart of gold.\n\n“Daena was such a beautiful sister that I will always look up to and love.”\n\nPaul said he would cherish memories of his sister in his heart forever.\n\nHe promised to “be there” for Daena’s two children and to “remind them what a beautiful, loving, caring mam” they had.\n\nMourners solemnly entered McCrea's Cremation Chapel in Wicklow town to the song ‘Young, Wild and Free’ by Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa, following her funeral Mass at the Church of St Laurence O'Toole in Roundwood.\n\nMourners sat, heads bowed and shoulders slumped, in sorrow when another favourite song of Daena's, the upbeat and vivacious 'Dance Monkey' by Tones and I, was played.\n\nPeople reached out and wrapped their arms around their neighbour’s heaving shoulders, holding each other as they sobbed when Hozier’s 'Too Sweet' played as the curtains closed for the last time across Daena’s coffin.\n\nDaena is survived by her “loving sons\", her mother Caroline, brothers Paul, Robbie, Callum, and Noah, her death notice said.\n\nHer “smile would light up the darkest room\", one mourner wrote on RIP.ie.\n\nAnother wrote that she had been trying to build a better life for herself and her family.\n\n“She loved her two boys and she was a loving and caring mother,\" they wrote.\n\nShe \"always brightened the room up when she would walk in\".\n\nOn Tuesday, her former partner, who has been charged with her murder, was further remanded in custody.\n\nAdam Corcoran, aged 29, appeared via videolink from prison before Mallow District Court on Tuesday.\n\nInspector Tony O’Sullivan applied for him to be further remanded in continued custody until August 20 for directions from the Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nJudge Marie Keane remanded him to appear again via videolink on August 20.\n\nMs Walsh was found seriously injured in her flat at John Barry House in Midleton town centre shortly after 4pm on Friday. The young mother was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nMs Walsh had been living in Cork but was originally from Roundwood in Co Wicklow."
