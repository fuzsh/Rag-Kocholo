        "text": "Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa are calling for peace in the wake of Drakeo the Ruler’s death.\n\nThe West Coast rapper was fatally stabbed during an altercation at the Once Upon a Time in L.A. festival on Saturday night (Dec. 18).\n\nA grieving Snoop, who was set to close out the concert later in the evening, mourned the tragic loss and urged for unity in hip-hop.\n\n“I’m saddened by the events that took place last night at the Once Upon a Time in LA festival,” he tweeted. “My condolences go out to the family and loved ones of Drakeo the Ruler.”\n\nSnoop said he learned of the deadly incident while backstage. “I’m not with anything negative and as one of the many performers, I was there to spread positive vibes only to my city of LA. Last night I was in my dressing room when I was informed about the incident and chose to immediately leave the festival grounds.”\n\nHe continued, “My prayers go out to everyone affected by tragedy. Please take care, love one another and stay safe yall. IM PRAYING FOR PEACE IN HIP HOP.”\n\nWithout directly mentioning Drakeo, Wiz Khalifa addressed the surge of violence in hip-hop while calling for change.\n\n“As enternainers lets try some shit next year. Minding our own business. Not dis respecting each others family, dead homies, or area they come from. Stop using someone else’s significant other as a one up to the other person. Actually showing the same love you expect to get,” he wrote.\n\n“Not sayın any of these are a direct cause of violence but changin em could help,” added Wiz.\n\nMeanwhile, Drake paid tribute to his friend and “Talk to Me” collaborator with a heartfelt post. “Nah man this sh*t isn’t right for real wtf are we doing 😔😔😔,” he wrote on Instagram Stories. “Always picked my spirit up with your energy RIP Drakeo.”"
