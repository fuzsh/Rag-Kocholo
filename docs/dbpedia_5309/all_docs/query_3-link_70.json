        "text": "TEXAS â âItâs Nuthin but a âGâ Thangâ when rapper-mogul Snoop Dogg takes his 2023 High School Reunion tour to three Texas cities. Hip-hop artist Wiz Khalifa will be right alongside Snoop, joined by rap legends Too $hort, Warren G and Berner. Once August rolls around, Texans whoâve secured their tickets better get ready to âDrop it like itâs Hot.â\n\nThe tour started on July 7. Snoop and his posse will be on the road for almost two months.\n\nThe West Coast rap pioneer is celebrating a decorated music career heâs been able to keep afloat for over 30 years under Death Row Records. Snoopâs debut studio album âDoggystyleâ was released under the label in 1993. And in February 2022, it was announced that he took ownership of Death Row Records, a truly full-circle moment for the rapper-turned-businessman.\n\nSnoop has marked his territory in the world of hip-hop and his contributions will always be remembered. Although music was his claim to fame, heâs had many other opportunities to keep him busy, such as film, the cannabis industry, coaching football, manufacturing alcohol, etc. But nothing is quite like hitting the stage in front of thousands of people singing along to your songs.\n\nCatch the High School Reunion Tour 2023 in the following Texas cities:\n\nAug. 18 â Austin, Texas, at Germania Insurance Amphitheater\n\nAug. 19 â Houston, Texas, at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion\n\nAug. 20 â Dallas, Texas, at Dos Equis Pavilion"
