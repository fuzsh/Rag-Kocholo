        "text": "Bootsy Collins assembles a crew of influential artists like Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa, and Eurythmics’ Dave Stewart for the P-Funk legend’s latest single, “The Influencers.”\n\nFantaazma and Westcoast Stone, a pair of artists on Collins’ Bootzilla Records, also appear on the track, which offers a preview of what the bassist has been cooking up at his Cincinnati studio over the past year.\n\n“I am an influencer, you are an influencer,” Collins said of the track in a statement. “Together we influence change within our journey through life. So hold on tight, cause we be funkin’ through the rest of the night.”\n\nCollins dropped his new single in the midst of a handful of planned performances at this year’s SXSW, including a stop at the Pourri’s Funk Factory Experience presented by Rolling Stone.\n\nTrending\n\nLast year, Collins reflected on his own history for Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums podcast, in which he discussed the making of Parliament’s Mothership Connection LP. In the episode, which also features interviews with George Clinton, Fred Wesley, and many others, Collins unpacks the stories behind “P-Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up),” “Mothership Connection (Star Child),” and the group’s first gold single, “Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker).”\n\n“I would say everybody was so ‘on the one’ that we never even thought about it,” Collins said in the podcast. “We were just having a good time. To me, one song didn’t overcome another. So it was all to me like one big jam. Like one big jam party.”"
