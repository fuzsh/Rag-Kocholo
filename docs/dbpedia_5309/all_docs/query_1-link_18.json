        "text": "By Chyrisse Tabone, Rock At Night Tampa Correspondent\n\nVenue: MidFlorida Credit Union Amphitheatre, Tampa, Florida–July 21, 2016–Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa–The High Road Summer Tour 2016\n\nLast night in Tampa the Mid-Florida Credit Union Amphitheatre was totally owned by Snoop Dog and Wiz Khalifa. First of all, the fun started earlier in the evening with lots of hip-hop, dance entertainment provided by DJ Drama, Casey Veggies, and Jhene Aiko. Rock At Night arrived in time to see Kevin Gates, who came out to an arena filled to the top. He gazed into the audience and said, “Man, I’ve never played to an audience like this before.” He seemed a little touched and overwhelmed but then preceded into the set as the audience (who was pretty warmed up at this point) were dancing and arm-waving. In fact, there was so much pot smoking in the area, a cloud kind of hovered above the crowd. No one was sure if people had brought this in and rolled it into a spliff, or if they were using CBD vape liquid, because there are so many different ways to take it! Either way, there’s no way it wouldn’t happen at a Snoop Dogg and Wiz Kalifa concert!\n\nNext, Snoop Dogg & Wiz were up for the night long party! In between sets, there was plenty of DJ music, video screens with trivia questions about Snoop’s smoking habits, plenty of smoke machines, and lights on the stage for sensory overload. The audience appeared to be a lot of 20-something kids and couples of what I’d describe as the “suburban crowd”.\n\nThe stage filled with smoke and blue lights as Snoop sauntered out on stage, smoking what looked to be a spliff. He stopped and took long drags and artistically puffed the white billows out into the air. Those in the audience who see this may feel compelled to smoke or, at the very least, vape by purchasing the best vape juice uk. After a short time of this, he was ready to jump into hip-hop heaven as the audience went totally mental. They were arm-raising, chanting the words to all the songs, and it was hard to maintain focus on shooting photos and not bust-a-move. He moved to both sides of the stage and the show and atmosphere was wild. Then, Wiz came out smoking as well. He continued rapping, unbuttoned his shirt, and got the audience to do some jumping. Lots of fun!\n\nI guess Snoop Dogg and Wiz alternated songs during the rest of the evening. We photogs are only there a short time, but the time I spent, was exhilarating! A must see concert!\n\nEpilogue: The whole time I kept thinking of seeing Snoop Dog on the Martha Stewart Show. He was such a charming gentleman and it was fun seeing them in the kitchen. Even chatting with audience members yesterday, Snoop Dogg is really a beloved icon.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY\n\nSnoop Dogg – Evolution of a drag\n\nMore Snoop Dogg\n\nWiz Khalifa\n\nKevin Gates\n\nThe images may not be reproduced, copied, transmitted or manipulated without written permission to Rock At Night and the photographer.
