Lincoln Way Nights, a classic project I helped finance, sending Stalley on multiple trips to Columbus Ohio to cook up in Rashad's basement, brought us to Europe for a mini tour 10 months later. Somehow we booked a show in Warsaw, and Stalley was on their radar. The show December 3, 2011 show at Cafe Kulturalna (which is housed in the historic communist-era Culture Palace) is still one Stalley and I remember vividly to date. It was the tail-end of a trip where he sold out La Bellevilloise in Paris (thanks to Nadim M., we stopped at the Cellar in Oxford (shout to Move Forward Music/Alex D), and Plan B in London (shout to Mani Mani). But despite Paris being a sell out and amazing experience, London/Oxford being memorable in their own right, Warsaw was the true standout highlight. When the show started, the entire room and venue was shaking with anticipation - the Polish-speaking crowd chanting \"Stalley\" and \"330\" was not anything we expected. We were worried during the set that the stage would fall apart, it was so wobbly from the crowd and energy. And the Polish fans knew the words to Lincoln Way Night, not just the hooks either - there were people spilling out of the actual venue room into the building's concourse. We didn't have a videographer, a DJ or anything - it was just the two of us running around Europe for a few days and learning on the go. Since I had to make sure the Polish DJ was on point, you can see me in some clips on the very back of the stage, looking like a baby still. During the encore, I'd quickly run to setup the merch table, as was typical. What a beautiful, simple time it was! Big thanks to Jan Porebski, Maceo Wyro, Sebastian Jóźwiak\n\nI caught up with legendary producer Bink! on his contribution to the KD17 Producer Pack by Nike and its inspiration. Bink! is one of the most humble legends you will ever meet and certainly is a producer that has been underrated in his entire 30+ year career in music. It was honor to help shed some light on Bink!'s story and the details behind his KD17, including his Virginia roots. Like Cardo, Bink! and I first connected through Stalley in 2012 during those Garrison NY studio sessions. Thanks to my guy BJ Moore for helping to connect the dots! Also thanks to Andscape and John Gotty!\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eCyfJuR6 This interview happened back at SXSW, I hadn't seen Cardo since 2012 - a lot had changed in both of our lives and we had a great time catching up and talking about food, restaurants and snacks. Originally we met when I was managing Stalley, and Cardo flew in for some sessions at our Summer studio house in Garrison, NY. During our talk Cardo brought up some IYKYK spots in Dallas, his top wing spots nationally, put us onto Soursop, Ranch on Spaghetti, Lil Debbie's jail treats, Taffy Grapes, his love for McDonald's Sweet N Sour sauce and Dorito's purple bag (aka Sweet Chili). We had a lot of fun going back down memory lane too (though we kept that off the record). Thanks UPROXX STUDIOS!\n\nHad no idea this Funny Marco episode of The Big Podcast with Shaq would be so good, get so much earned media, get us over 200k subs and be so of \"the moment\" when we booked FM the first time. Unfortunately, FM had to cancel last minute BUT we got a date on the books a month and a half later and the rest is internet history. If you're not up on Funny Marco, it's time. The trolling in this episode reaches an all time high, not just from FM. Shaq gets in on the fun, majorly. And I guess production did too, my named is spelled \"Resnicks\" in the credits, but can't be upset about a misspelled last name in an episode that's 99% trolling and roasting. Thanks Playmaker!\n\nI worked on Mike Tyson's Hotboxin podcast for around 2 years as a Talent Booker. During that time I was in touch with hundreds of celebrity reps, but David Blaine was the only potential guest that called me personally to pitch something he wanted to do with the Champ, during one of his Vegas residencies. The collaboration didn't happen at the time, but David called me out of the blue last week to ask if Mike would be in town this past weekend - he had a few ideas of fun ways Mike could participate in his show (e.g. \"he could sew my mouth together\"). Well Mike serendipitously was in Vegas (or does David have ESP and knew already before he called?) and he was game, so Blaine ticket holders got a surprise cameo Friday night from the Champ, David got his idol involved in the show (there are photos online, video coming soon), Mike got some promo for his upcoming fight with Jake Paul, and I got the thrill of being the thread connecting Mike and David (Al Pacino between them in the photo). I probably should have gone to the show...next time... #NotAlwaysAboutTheBag #MakeMoments"
