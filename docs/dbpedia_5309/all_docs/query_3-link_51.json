        "text": "Two megastars sharing a stage and co-headlining a tour is definitely trending right now. Sting and Peter Gabrielle are touring with just such a show this summer. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Did it work with Snoop Dogg and Whiz Khalifa? Absolutely.\n\nSnoop Dogg and Whiz Khalifa are co-headlining the High Road Tour that also included rapper Kevin Gates, R&B singer Jhené Aiko and rapper Casey Veggies. The tour stopped in Phoenix at the Ak-Chin Pavilion on August 24, 2016.\n\nSnoop Dogg started the set with two songs performed solo. Snoop then relinquished the stage to Whiz Khalifa who performed three songs solo. Snoop and Whiz went back and forth like this a couple times until ultimately they took the stage together. The whole thing worked beautifully. Their music is just different enough from each other to be distinctive and carve out a place for each of them separately, but similar enough that it works together exceptionally well in a single set.\n\nIn addition to the music meshing well, the artists themselves appear to have terrific chemistry. Whether its real or just for the stage, it worked extremely well. Each of them tee’d up songs for the other, backed each other up and they both graciously shared the spotlight (literally and figuratively) with each other during the lengthy set.\n\nSnoop’s career launched with Doggystyle in 1993 and his most recent album to go gold was Ego Trippin’ in 2008. By contrast, Whiz’s career launched 13 years later with Show and Prove in 2006 and his most recent gold album was Blacc Hollywood released in 2014. The result is that these artists are almost a generation apart. The only reason to even mention this is that it was reflected in the audience, which was much more diverse age-wise than you often see at shows. In my row alone there were a couple teenagers to my left who couldn’t have been more than 18 or 19 while on my right were a couple who looked to be in their 50s. Yet despite the inter-generational age range, it worked…well.\n\nEach artist has a tremendous catalog and could play a full show of just their own hits. Individually and together they performed a nice retrospective of their respective stellar careers. Two of the highlights from the show, however, had to be Notorious B.I.G. and 2Pac covers. They were well done and, like the entire show, were extremely well received by the audience.\n\nReview and photos by Greg Cohen\n\nSnoop Dogg and Whiz Khalifa\n\nKevin Gates\n\nJhene Aiko\n\nAll photos © Greg Cohen 2016"
