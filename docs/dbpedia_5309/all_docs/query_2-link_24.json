        "text": "Wiz Khalifa enjoyed his time broadening his horizons, landing last year’s biggest-selling pop single, “See You Again,” with Charlie Puth and spending last summer touring with rockers Fall Out Boy.\n\nThis summer, he wanted to get back to his roots. And what could be more Wiz-centric than a tour with Snoop Dogg?\n\n“It was my feeling that we should have gotten on the road for a long time,” he said in a recent teleconference. “I wanted to do something that was more oriented towards my core audience, and doing something with Snoop just felt like, I mean, it just felt like the perfect opportunity to bring me and Snoop together and make it a great fan experience too.”\n\nThe Pittsburgh rapper said he was thrilled to work with Snoop, after growing up listening to his music. “We’re more like brothers than a business relationship,” Wiz says. “This is going to be cool and it’s going to be fun because we’re going to really have a dope experience behind the scenes as well as on stage.”\n\nThey first met for Snoop’s song “That Good,” which happened organically when Wiz showed up at Snoop’s house.\n\n“It took me about 10 or 15 seconds, and I wrote the hook,” Wiz recalls. “And then I went and laid the hook and he told me that it sounded like Nate Dogg singing the hook, so that really made me super confident. Then he wrote his verse. Of course, he wrote it faster than I wrote mine.”\n\nAs much as he’s enjoying “The High Road” tour, Wiz says he’s already planning something new.\n\n“I’m really happy where I’m at and being that I’ve been 10 years in the game,” he says. “My goal, since I was younger, was to always be able to reinvent myself, and I think that with the time that I’ve been doing this, I’ve done a great job of inventing and reinventing. And I still give people a lot of hope for what’s next, so I’m happy.”"
