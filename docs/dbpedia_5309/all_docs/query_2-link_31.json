        "text": "“I don’t give a fuck about that shit,” Wiz Khalifa said with Snoop Dogg‘s co-sign on his tour bus before their joint National Concert Day performance in New York City on Tuesday. The pair hit the road together for their High Road Tour this summer, the always pro-weed artists share their thoughts on weed and the upcoming election.\n\n“It doesn’t matter which one of them motherfuckers is in the office, we gonna still do what the fuck we’ve been doing ’cause that’s all we know,” Snoop said. He praised President Obama for “taking it to the max” over his last eight years in office.\n\n“He’s been really going out with a bang,” he said after referencing comedian Larry Wilmore’s controversial White House Correspondents’ Dinner speech where he used the N-word to close out his monologue. “He’s doing barbecues, basketball games. He’s in there just really livin’ it up.”\n\nThe rapper continued by directly addressing the current president. “Thank you Obama for really setting the tone for whoever the fuck comes in there next, which we don’t give a fuck about,” he said. “We just gonna live like you still up in there.”\n\nTrending\n\nThe pair’s upcoming High Road Tour follows Khalifa’s 2016 album Khalifa and is ahead of a recently announced new album from Snoop, to be released this July according to his Instagram. Khalifa recalls the two linked up after the veteran West Coast MC’s children told him about the younger star. Snoop reached out and when they met on the set of the “This Weed Iz Mine” video, collaboration ideas began to flow.\n\n“We admired each other but it was also like, we’re gonna change some shit. We’re gonna do some things differently for people so they see how it can be done,” Khalifa explained.\n\nFor the tour, Snoop is hoping to get Khalifa to perform songs he wouldn’t normally do on stage. “I’m a fan, so I wanna make sure that I’m entertained while I’m watching him perform and while I’m performing with him,” he said. “We’re doing it for the fuckin’ love and the sport of it.”"
