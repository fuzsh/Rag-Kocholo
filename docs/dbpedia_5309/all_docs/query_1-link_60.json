        "text": "There’s not one business venture Snoop Dogg or his family are scared to explore. The man is deep in the world of marijuana, owns a cereal brand, owns a restaurant and is also the owner of Death Row Records. He does it all.\n\nBut recently, the “Doggystyle” rapper’s wife, Shante Broadus, decided to start a business of her own: “The Players Club.”\n\nNo, she’s not remaking the 1998 movie, Broadus is opening a strip club.\n\nOn Wednesday night, “The Boss Lady” held a grand opening party to celebrate the opening of her first self-owned strip club. The guest list included many Black entertainers across industries, including Cedric the Entertainer, Too $hort, DJ Drama, Tiffany Haddish, DJ Quil and Wiz Khalifa, according to TMZ.\n\nWatch some of the fun some of the celebrities had the other night:\n\nIn a press release, Broadus stated, “I am thrilled to introduce the Players Club to Los Angeles. his club is more than just a venue; it’s a celebration of empowerment, beauty, and entrepreneurship, providing a space where everyone can feel like a boss.”\n\nBrandee Evans, star of the STARZ TV show “P-Valley” (which is a show about a Mississippi strip club) was among the attendees of the event and helped host a “sexiest dancer in the room” contest.”\n\nAlthough it seemed that everyone who attended the event was excited about the grand opening, others on social media were critical.\n\nIn one viral tweet on X, one user wrote, “Schools, Banks, Trade schools, Grocery stores……Nah Restaurants/Strip clubs…..Yea These people play in our faces.”\n\nThis led to a number of interesting responses in the comments with one user writing, “They don’t play in our faces. We are the people who act like they are supposed to be a role model. We don’t need them to do anything for us, we can do it ourselves.”\n\nAnother wrote, “They want consumers not thinkers.”\n\nHowever you may feel, it’s clear that this new business has people talking. But any press is good press, right?"
