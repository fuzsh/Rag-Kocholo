        "text": "Snoop Dogg & Wiz Khalifa\n\nMac & Devin Go To High School\n\nI summarily ignored Snoop and Wiz’s joint when it came out a few weeks ago. I added up all the parts in my head and came out with an opinion before ever listening to the album. Here is how my thought process went.\n\n1. I kind of like Snoop Dogg, but only in a guest verse/occasional spurt type role. Let’s admit it; no one has really wanted to listen to a complete Snoop album in a long, long time.\n\n2. I feel similarly about Wiz, although not even as strongly as I feel about Snoop Dogg. He can spice up a track every once in a while, but is limited as far as actual talent goes.\n\n3. Wiz is kind of like a younger version of Snoop lyric-wise. They are just going to spend an entire record trying to one-up each other on how much weed each smokes.\n\nWell, I feel my three preconceived notions above were all correct, but fortunately this is truly a situation where the final product is greater than the sum of its parts. Quick shout-out to my buddy Zach for telling me this is the most relevant thing Snoop has done in 10 years, and getting me to check out the album.\n\nMac & Devin Go To High School is apparently the soundtrack for an upcoming movie of the same name, starring, you guessed it, Snoop and Wiz. I am going to dismiss this movie even quicker than I dismissed the soundtrack. But let me say this: For what is sure to be a complete sh*t movie, it has a pretty dope soundtrack. Yes, the lyrics are almost completely devoted to the joys of smoking pot, with an acceptable side dish of how gangster each other are. But they do it with such light-hearted, relaxed fun, that it is impossible not to enjoy it at least a little bit. If it wasn’t January, this would be the perfect summer rap album.\n\nSo maybe Snoop and Wiz aren’t Jay-Z and Kanye. In fact, if Jay and Ye are Wade and Lebron, Snoop and Wiz are somewhere along the lines of Stephen Jackson and Brandon Jennings. They work really well together though. Neither one is vying for the lead, and they have a real knack for stepping in right at the moment when I was tiring of the other.\n\nThe lead single “Young, Wild & Free” is about as light as “gangsta” rap is going to get, with a Gershwin-style piano bit and Bruno Mars singing the hook. The hook is actually a perfect microcosm of the album as a whole; just a lot of getting drunk, high, and having fun. Another highlight is “I Get Lifted”, which is about (you guessed it) getting high. The hook screams retro Macy Gray and Wiz and Snoop trade verses with ease.\n\nI really can’t pick any obviously weak tracks on Mac & Devin, which does not necessarily mean that it is a great album. The highs are nice, but there is nothing new to blow me away. This is why this would have been the perfect summer album. Something to roll around with the windows down to…and then awkwardly roll up the windows and lock the doors when the “n” word becomes too prominent. All in all though, a pleasant surprise that I will revisit occasionally. Put it in a zag, or put it in a blunt, but either way, this is an album that has earned at least one toke.\n\n7/11\n\nCan’t Miss: “Young, Wild & Free”, “I Get Lifted”, “Talent Show”\n\nCan’t Hit: none"
