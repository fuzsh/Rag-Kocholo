        "text": "Two of the hottest players in the hip-hop gameâSnoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifaâwill perform at the WVU Coliseum on Friday, Feb. 25 at 7:30 p.m. Local Morgantown alternative hip-hop artist Huey Mack will open the show. Tickets go on sale Wednesday, Jan. 12 at 9 a.m. at the Mountainlair Box Office, ticketmaster.com and 304-293-SHOW.\n\nThe embodiment of â90s gangsta rap, Snoop Dogg has become something of a cultural phenomenon over the past two decades. With his signature drawl and ultra-smooth laid-back rhyming delivery, Snoop, a protï¿½gï¿½ of Dr. Dre, found initial success with his debut album Doggystyle. Now, on the verge of releasing his 11th studio album, (Doggumentary Music) Snoop Dogg is bringing more crisp, R&B-filled beats to the table. Fellow rapper Kool Moe Dee calls Snoop âone of the smoothest, funkiest flow-ers in the game,â â which is clearly evidenced by the starâs 14 Grammy nominations. His latest nominations come for his vocals on Katy Perryâs âCalifornia Gurls.â In addition to the Grammy nods, he has won multiple MTV Video Music Awards, an American Music Award, BET Awards, and Billboard Awards. He has appeared in numerous feature films and television series, including the Academy Award-winning Training Day, the popular HBO series Entourage and the animated series King of the Hill. Snoop is currently Creative Chairman of EMIâs reintroduced Priority Records.\n\nPittsburgh-native Wiz Khalifa has found major grassroots success since the release of his early mixtapes and his debut single âSay Yeah.â Backed by his loyal fanbaseânicknamed the Taylor Gang after his favorite Chuck Taylor shoesâKhalifa was named an Artist to Watch in 2006 by Rolling Stone magazine. The Internet release of his 2010 independent mixtape Kush and Orange Juice sent the Internet-world into a frenzy. A frequent collaborator with huge names in the hip-hop world, including Snoop Dogg, Diddy, Wale and B.o.B, Khalifa was just named MTVâs Hottest Breakthrough MC of 2010 and the 2010 Rookie of the Year by The Source magazine. His new single, âBlack and Yellowââa tribute to Pittsburgh sportsâhas helped to solidify his place as hip-hopâs newest star.\n\nMorgantownâs own Huey Mack and his band will open the concert. Mack, a 19-year-old alternative hip-hop artist and current West Virginia University student, has gained momentum in the music industry since the release of his new mixtape, Bright Lights & Long Nights. âPopular,â a single off the 21-track mixtape, is getting a lot of attention for its fresh rhyming on top of a sample from the Broadway show Wicked. With positive feedback, an upbeat sound and quirky sampling, Mack is poised to go a long way in the hip-hop world.\n\nTickets for the concert may be purchased at the Mountainlair Box Office, ticketmaster.com and by calling 304-293-SHOW or 800-745-3000 beginning at 9 a.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 12. Tickets are also available at all Ticketmaster outlets, including Giant Eagle on Greenbag Rd. and FYE in the Meadowbrook Mall. Tickets range in price from $32 to $47, depending on seat location. A limited number of floor tickets are general admission, standing-room-only. WVU Students get a $10 discount with a valid WVU Student I.D. One discount per I.D.\n\nThis event is produced by WVU Arts & Entertainment.
