        "text": "Longtime friends and hip-hop artists Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa are joining forces and hitting the road together with the High School Reunion Tour. The jaunt kicks off in July in Vancouver, British Columbia and travels throughout North America before concluding at FivePoint Amphitheatre in Irvine on Aug. 27.\n\nThe pair recently collaborated on the single, “Don’t Text, Don’t Call,” the perfect launching pad for a hip-hop tour like this, which also features Too Short, Warren G, Berner and special guest DJ Drama.\n\nTickets go on sale to the general public at 9 a.m. Friday, March 10 at Ticketmaster.com. A pre-sale for Citi card members will go on sale at 10 a.m. Tuesday, March 7 at citientertainment.com. VIP options for fans, including premium tickets, access to VIP lounges, limited edition posters, gifts and more, will be available at vipnation.com.\n\nSnoop and Khalifa’s friendship goes back more than a decade, when the two worked on the “Mac & Devin Go to High School” record, which produced the 2011 hit “Young, Wild & Free,” also featuring Bruno Mars. In 2016, the pair went on their co-headlining High Road Summer Tour, which was one of the most successful tours of that year."
