Since its October release, the track has peaked at No. 10 on the Hot 100, and currently sits at No. 57 on the chart.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe “Mac and Devin” film, which was directed by Dylan Brown and does not have a release date, is set in a Los Angeles high school and features Khalifa as a Valedictorian hopeful who learns about life from a consummate ladies man played by Snoop. “It’s a great buddy film. It’s just about — Snoop’s the cool guy in school and I’m kind of the nerd,” Khalifa told Billboard.com in June.\n\nMeanwhile, Wiz and Snoop will kick off the High School mini-tour on Dec. 5 in New York. The rappers will likely reference marijuana while on stage.\n\nHere are the dates to Wiz and Snoop’s High School Tour:"
