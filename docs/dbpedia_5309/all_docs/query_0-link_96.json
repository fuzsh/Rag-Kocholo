        "text": "PHILADELPHIA â€” Lawyers representing 17 people injured when a railing collapsed at a Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa concert in New Jersey have filed a lawsuit against the venue's operator and the performers claiming they didn't take enough precautions to ensure concertgoers would be safe.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in a Philadelphia court, doesn't specify what damages are being sought.\n\nRelated: Railing Collapses at Snoop Dogg Concert, Injuring Dozens\n\nBut attorney Robert J. Mongeluzzi said his clients want to prevent future incidents and deserve monetary compensation.\n\nThe plaintiffs include 14 concertgoers and three workers, including one who suffered a fractured spine, attorneys say.\n\nA partition separating a lawn from a secondary stage set up at the rear of the seating section collapsed shortly after the show began Aug. 5 at Camden's BB&T Pavilion, causing people to fall roughly 10 feet onto the concrete below.\n\nAuthorities have said 42 people were hurt in the collapse, which occurred as the rappers were gesturing to fans to move toward the small stage. Lawyers say concertgoers were trampled and pinned to the ground, causing some to have broken bones, torn ligaments and tendons, loss of consciousness and emotional trauma.\n\n\"I can tell you there is no doubt there was a crowd surge based upon the setup of the lawn with no chairs and no aisles, lack of security ... and then the artists telling people to come forward,\" Mongeluzzi said. \"That's the setup, and that's the failure.\"\n\nLive Nation, which operates the venue, announced after the railing collapse that it had \"secured\" the fallen section of railing. It also said in a statement at the time that it was working with authorities and structural engineers to determine the cause of the collapse. It has since set up a safety zone to block a section of space in front of the railing.\n\nMongeluzzi said Live Nation's actions were \"really a post-accident admission that this is the way it should've been set up.\"\n\nLive Nation declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nWiz Khalifa, whose real name is Cameron Thomaz, and Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr., were ushered from the stage moments after the railing collapse, and the show was canceled.\n\nCalls and emails to the artists' representatives requesting comment were not immediately returned."
