        "text": "By: Erika Minnix\n\nHigh school came, and high school went. Many students have walked the halls of N Hale High. Yet the history of N Hale High will always be commemorated by two iconic students: Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa. It’s time to bust out those old yearbooks and go through memories as the two brought the gang back together for moments of memory lane. Too $hort, Warren G, Berner, and DJ Drama made it to the high school reunion. Oh, to look back at a high-school yearbook, seeing if the superlatives held up after all these years. Why paint the town red when you can paint it black and yellow? Grab those munchies and get ready for a blast from the past.\n\nWest Coast rappers bring something different to the hip-hop game. A concert with Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa combined becomes more than a show; it becomes a theatrical production. Every little detail matters and the two of them excel with their visuals. Aside from lasers galore, watching everything they did and had in their set brought back the memories of trying to make it to class, climbing stairs and stairs, and talking with friends. High school would’ve been cooler if Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa roamed high school hallways with us.\n\nOne of the greatest artists to emerge in hip-hop was Wiz Khalifa. He has feature tracks left and right, and his work will forever impact the hip-hop community. His performance was a constant party from beginning to end. The crowd became electrified as Wiz performed banger after banger. Rarely do rappers perform more than just their feature verse. Wiz Khalifa had the audience having a karaoke dance party by singing the entirety of the songs, which is pretty dope. Despite being in a crowd, it was easy to transcend to moments of peace during Wiz Khalifa’s visuals. Wiz and the Taylor Gang define living life to the fullest, not caring about the opinions of others.\n\nThere’s a reason why Snoop Dogg is a West Coast legend and all that he has done for the hip-hop scene and music evolution. He puts on a spectacular performance no matter what. He knows how to rile up a crowd. Few can pull off cruising in on an on-stage convertible, but Snoop Dogg can with lasers beaming up and down through the amphitheater. Cruising through city streets in his convertible made the chill, relaxed life freeing and appealing. When he first took the stage, the audience went wild.\n\nNo matter how hot it may be outside, Snoop is pulling up in his blue tracksuit, reminding everyone of the G that he is. With a quick outfit switch, Snoop Dogg reassured that he was for The Valley by showing off his Kevin Durant Jersey. Being in the same desert air with a legend such as Snoop Dogg was unforgettable. Dancers improve everything, especially Snoop Dogg’s. When his dancers are upstage doing what they do best, he is a hype man like no other. Even if Snoop Dogg fan’s heads are in the clouds, there is never a dull movement.\n\nThe remembrance of hip-hop’s greatest legends was honored on the video screen as the two sang an acoustic version of ‘See You Again,’ this song already has heartwarming lyrics. Seeing this song performed live was indeed an astounding way to close a show and conclude the high school reunion. High school may not be forever; hip-hop will live on."
