        "text": "Snoop Dogg and his wife, Shante Broadus, work well together as a couple and as business partners.\n\nThe “Drop It Like It’s Hot” musician met his future wife when they were both teenagers, and she supported his music career from day one.\n\n“I was there with him when he started all this,” Broadus told W Magazine in 2021. “Even before he came out [as a musician], our friends and I were his fans. We would always listen to his songs and give our opinions. When he became popular, I was still helping them with deals and offers.”\n\nSpeaking of deals, there's one that Snoop Dogg turned down specifically because he knew that his wife wouldn't be okay with it: a collaboration with OnlyFans.\n\n\"They were like, ‘OnlyFans wants you to come on there, Snoop. You could do about $100 million. All you gotta do is pull that thang out,’ \" Snoop Dogg said on an episode of the Instagram Live series Wake & Bake With Double S Express in January 2024, adding, \"I'm like, I got a Black wife. Ain’t no way in the world she gonna allow me to go on there and pull that thang out for no amount of money.\"\n\nSo, who exactly is Shante Broadus, and how did she meet and fall in love with the famous rapper? Here is everything to know about Snoop Dogg’s wife.\n\nShe and Snoop Dogg first met as teens\n\nSnoop and Broadus first met as teenagers when they attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School in California. The couple even attended school dances and prom together before graduating in 1989.\n\nShe married Snoop Dogg in 1997\n\nOn June 14, 1997, the couple tied the knot at The Ritz Carlton Hotel in Marina Del Rey, California.\n\nOver a decade later, the husband and wife renewed their vows at singer Charlie Wilson’s ranch in front of 200 friends and family members. Snoop surprised Broadus with the ceremony, which was held on Jan. 12, 2008.\n\nSpeaking on Today in 2023, the artist opened up about why their marriage has withstood the test of time.\n\n“I think because we were both young and we were both willing to sacrifice for each other,\" he told co-hosts Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager. \"She knew what my dreams and goals was, and at the same time, I knew what hers were.\"\n\nSnoop continued: \"To have a family and to be who we are ... we both wanted to get to that goal, and when we reached it, it was hard, definitely, because you got so many different things pulling you away from marriage, and people divorcing every other day.”\n\n\"But when you truly love somebody, there ain't nothing you can do to break that up and I feel like that was true love at first sight,\" he concluded.\n\nIn June 2024, the couple celebrated 27 years of marriage. Snoop marked the special day by sharing photos of him and Broadus on Instagram.\n\nShe and Snoop Dogg are proud parents and grandparents\n\nSnoop and Broadus share three children together. The couple's first child, a son named Cordé, was born on May 20, 1994. Their second son, Cordell, joined the family on Feb. 21, 1997. Two years later, on June 22, 1999, they had a daughter named Cori.\n\n\"My relationship with my kids is more important than anything. It's a friendship relationship,\" Snoop said on Today in 2015. \"It's based on me being a father, a mentor and a friend.\"\n\nIn January 2024, their daughter, Cori, who was diagnosed with lupus at age 6, revealed that she'd suffered a \"severe stroke\" in a post on her Instagram Stories, though she didn't offer any specific details at the time.\n\nThe couple are also grandparents to Cordé’s children — sons Zion and Leo and daughter Elleven — as well as Corde's late son Kai Love, who died on Sept. 25, 2019, at 10 days old.\n\nCordell also has three daughters with his wife Phia Barragan: Cordoba, Chateau and Symphony Sol.\n\n\"My grandkids are my everything because they all individually get a piece of my heart and they're different,\" he revealed in Words + Music: From the Streets to the Suites. \"My grandpa was my best friend and for me to be that for my grandkids is showing that I actually did well and I was able to outlive the circumstances.\"\n\nSnoop continued: \"Now I can look back — I can teach those who want to get to this level. Or at least give them a blueprint and help them avoid some of the traps that had to deal with.\"\n\nShe is his manager\n\nOn June 9, 2021, Broadus officially became her husband’s manager. Her new role included expanding his various business ventures and overseeing his \"partnership deals across the cannabis, spirits, gaming, music, brand partnerships, touring, licensing and TV/film space,\" per PRNewswire. She also oversees the media arm of Snoop's gaming and animation business, diGGital doGG.\n\n\"Shante has been guiding my career behind the scenes from day one,\" Snoop said in a press release. \"She has always been my final gut check with all my decisions, and I wouldn't be where I am today without her. I am grateful to have her as my official manager, helping to build the Snoop Dogg empire together.\"\n\n\"The industry at large is seeing a major shift in more representation of Black women in key executive roles. I am excited to enter this official position, helping to further expand Snoop's wide-ranging empire,” she added.\n\nBroadus continued: \"I have been by Snoop's side for over two decades so together with the rest of the team, our goal is to strengthen Snoop's legacy as a brand with the loyalty and trust of our guidance that has made Snoop who he is today.\"\n\nShe launched an entertainment company\n\nIn 2003, Broadus founded Boss Lady Entertainment, a music management company. The business also helped produce movies and television series, including her husband’s 2012 documentary, Reincarnated. According to the Los Angeles Times, BLE oversees the Compound, an event space that features recording and dance studios. Powerhouse musicians, including Kendrick Lamar, Cardi B, Wiz Khalifa and more have used the spaces.\n\nBroadus is also set to release her first book, a memoir titled Paid the Cost to be the Boss Lady, that \"will chronicle her life in the public eye and all the lessons she has learned along the way.\"\n\nThey briefly split in 2004\n\nIn 2004, the music mogul filed for divorce from Broadus as he later revealed that fame got to his head.\n\n\"I thought I was the man, and I was willing to give up what I had at home for that, until I realized that what I had at home was irreplaceable,\" he told PEOPLE in 2007.\n\nSnoop explained that his kids motivated him to repair his relationship with Broadus.\" I had kids with my wife because I wanted to be with my wife. And those three babies are all wanted, and I wanted to be with them,\" said the rapper.\n\nThey launched a scarf brand together\n\nThe powerhouse couple created a unisex scarf line called The Broadus Collection. The inspiration for the company came from daughter Cori's Lupus diagnosis, as her Lupus made her hair fall out and she would frequently wear head scarfs. Her family also wore scarves in solidarity.\n\n“I would put a scarf on her and so she wouldn’t feel like she was the only one wearing scarves. We all, wore scarves with her to make her feel less alone,” Broadus told W Magazine. Their goal was to create a line that “was positive and a reflection of her going through all that.”\n\nShe has appeared on reality TV\n\nOver the years, she has made guest appearances on several reality television shows, including E! True Hollywood Story, HGTV's Celebrity IOU and the Steve Harvey-led game show Celebrity Family Feud.\n\nAdditionally, she was a main star in the 2007 E! series Snoop Dogg’s Father Hood, which featured their entire family. Broadus later appeared in the 2012 documentary Reincarnated, which was about her husband’s music career."
