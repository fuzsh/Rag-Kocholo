        "text": "The cold war between Jay-Z and The Game has lasted since the release of The Game’s debut album, The Documentary. Whether he was speaking about Jay-Z or not, this line from the opening track, Westside Story, is probably the reason these two MCs have never collaborated:\n\n“Payback, homie I’m bringing CA back/And I don’t do button up shirts or ride Maybachs.”\n\nThough The Game would later explain that the line was directed at Ja Rule and not Jay-Z, it didn’t matter because no one, most importantly Jay-Z, believed him. Around that time (2004), Jay-Z, had made button down dress shirts popular in hip-hop, had just dropped The Black Album, his fifth #1, and released a video that ended with him sitting in the back of a Maybach while wearing a colorful button down shirt (Dirt Off Your Shoulders). On the opposite end of the spectrum, Ja Rule was dealing with legal issues, had just had his music career destroyed by 50 Cent, and was replaced by Ludacris as the resident rapper in the Fast And Furious franchise.\n\nThe Game’s constant shade throwing is maybe the only reason this collabo doesn’t exist today. Oh, that and the Game’s song My Bitch, in which the entire second verse is dedicated to ripping Jigga. Consider this; Jay-Z was willing to get on the track and collaborated with 50 Cent for the I Get Money Remix after 50 wrote and recorded Be A Gentlemen, an entire song devoted to dissing Jay-Z. Hova even buried the hatchet with Nas after their infamously ruthless verbal war to make Black Republicans. These two must really not like each other!\n\nYoung Jeezy & Gucci Mane, (A 2nd Time)\n\nSo, this one might technically be a copout, but I don’t care. When So Icy dropped right before the summer of 2005 I remember thinking, “This duo is about to run Atlanta Trap music side-by-side for the next 10 years.” And then as quickly as the song rose up the charts, the beef between Jeezy and Gucci exploded. I say beef, and not a verbal sparing or a war of records, because this went way beyond the music. After a misunderstanding over when and on whose album Icy was to be released, shit escalated quickly, bounties were placed on chains, and Gucci Mane was being charged with murder. He would later be acquitted as the case was ruled self-defense. The timeline of their beef is a story all its own, but in an interest to keep this mainly about the music, let’s look at what could have been if these two pioneers of Trap music had risen to the top of the game together rather than constantly trying to cut the other down.\n\nFor starters, the impact both artists have had on hip-hop is undeniable, particularly on Atlanta artists. There would be no Migos or 21 Savage without Jeezy, no Future or Young Thug without Gucci Mane. Gucci and Jeezy changed the sound in hip-hop and ushered in the era of Trap, using slower beats, heavy 808s, and most distinctively, ad-libs more as an extension of the track than their actual voices. Gucci Mane can, and has, made songs infinitely better by adding a few well-placed “BRRRR’s” and “WOP’s”. Not to be outdone, Jeezy refuses to end most of his lines without punctuating them with a strong “CHHEEAH”, “THAT’S RIGHT” or my personal favorite, “HA-HA!”\n\nAdlibs aside, Gucci and Jeezy rank third and fourth all time — put them in whichever order you’d like — in influential hip-hop artist from the ATL.\n\n1. Outkast (technically two artist but y’all know the deal)\n\n2. T.I.\n\n3. Gucci Mane\n\n4. Young Jeezy\n\n5. Ludacris (almost there Future, but not quite. About 17 million records more, then…maybe. Migos, you’re next)\n\nYou can argue with my order, but not the list. Jeezy and Gucci are Atlanta, and if at the height of their run they had put their respective creative powers together to make the biggest A-Town record of all time, it could have been to Atlanta what California Love is to L.A. The one, true, unified city/state song. Too bad all we can do is dream and imagine. At this point, I don’t think I want it to happen. The moment is gone and anything they tried now would sound forced because it would be forced. You don’t beef like these two beefed and then somehow find chemistry and make music. It just seems unlikely.\n\nEminem & Nas\n\nWe finally arrive at the first pairing on our list with no known issues between the two, and therefore no theoretical reason as to why it hasn’t happened. Eminem hasn’t collaborated with many rappers, but when he does, his collabos are either artist associated with the Shady/Aftermath roster or hip-hop legends. The names he has linked up with, excluding anyone on his roster: Missy, Biggie (posthumously), Jay-Z, The L.O.X., Fat Joe, T.I., Lil Wayne, Drake, Nikki Minaj, and Big Sean. The list reads like a roll call of the biggest and best artist in hip-hop over the past 15 years. Again, excluding label mates like Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, The Game, Busta Rhymes, and Kendrick Lamar, it seems like Nas, Outkast, and maybe the Wu-Tang Clan are the only other names I’d expect to see on this list.\n\nSo, why no Nas/Em song? I present this theory. Crowned a king in hip-hop before he turned 21, Nas’ Illmatic is argued as one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever. Nas is the rapper’s rapper, and is unquestionably one of the deadliest MCs off all time. Though they would be wrong, some people believe he went toe-to-toe with the God MC, Jay Hova, and won. And even people like me who know that Nas lost the battle, know that regardless of the victor, Ether, as a term, word, and phrase specifically in hip-hop, was the lasting relic of their feud and not the superior song and the greatest diss track of all time, Jay’s Takeover.\n\nOf course, “Eminem murdered you on your own shit.” was one of the most memorable and factually accurate lines on Ether. So, what is the last thing an MC like Nas, Mr. Afrocentric, super pro-black, f — k The Yakubian Devil, can allow to happen on a track? To possibly be bodied by the greatest lyrical wordsmith hip-hop has ever known, who also happens to be a blonde haired, blue-eyed white guy. Hardcore Nas fans would refuse to recognize the songs existence if Eminem’s bars were on par with Nas’, let alone if they were better. So yes, as would be the case for any MC, getting on a track with Eminem leaves them venerable to being out-flowed by possibly the greatest rapper ever. And while there is no shame in that for 99.9% of rappers, Nas seems like the one guy who simply will not even entertain the idea of putting himself in that position for fear that Queens Bridge might disown him.\n\nKendrick Lamar & Wale\n\nOk, so this one absolutely has to happen at some point, right? In the game today, these are the two biggest poetic souls trapped inside the bodies of rappers. Wale has referred to himself as, “A poet with some hang time.” and “Michael Angelo’s portrait meets Maya Angelou’s notebook.” And Kung Fu Kenny seemingly includes at least one poem per album going all the way back to his Section.80 days, saying more than once, “Don’t mistake me for no f — ing rapper.” Now whether he means he’s a poet or a revolutionary or some other form of artist doesn’t really matter.\n\nMy point is, both of these brothers love to get deep on your ass, even to the point of sacrificing certain levels of commercial success. Even more uniquely, both artists are conscious and aware enough to understand they are sacrificing some commercial appeal for the betterment of their artistry. It’s the same kind of consciousness they both had when choosing to avoid the sadly, often traveled path of drugs, violence, and gang activity in places like Compton and Prince George County. Unlike the previous three fantasy collaborations, these two seem like a natural paring. Just get them in a room together, throw Why The Caged Bird Sings in there, close the door and let the spirits of Langston Hughes and Gil-Scot Heron do the rest. I wonder which Seinfeld references Kendrick would best appropriate.\n\nWiz Khalifa feat. Redman & Method Man\n\nCan you say “How High Part…However Many Parts of How High Red and Meth Have Already Done? This one doesn’t need much of a breakdown and frankly, “The Ultimate Weed Smoker Rap Lineup Song” is deserving of its own article. On that note, first five in would have to be Snoop, Red and Meth (together they count as one), B-Real, Wiz Khalifa, and Curren$y. right?\n\nAnyway, it seems long overdue that the smokers of this generation like Wiz, Curren$y, Kudi, and Smoke DZA do a song with the O.G. smokers like Snoop, Red, Meth, B-Real, and Devin The Dude.\n\nWiz definitely took the torch from Snoop as this generation’s stoner rapper, and since he and Snoop have already done entire projects together, next in line from the O.G.s would definitely be the Red/Meth duo. They’re arguably the best one-two team, that isn’t officially a group, in the history of hip-hop: Big Pun/Fat Joe, Jadakiss/Styles P, Jay-Z/Kanye, Ghostface/Raekwon, Nas/AZ, Mase/Puffy. They helped establish a weed culture in rap. Not that plenty of rappers didn’t smoke and use weed references, but there’s a difference between Biggie spitting “Smoking blunts was a daily routine.” amongst dozens of other references in Party and Bullshit and Method Man actually inventing different words to reference smoking weed a.k.a., “Cheebah Cheebah” All I Need-Remix.\n\nMaybe the issue is if all three of those weed powers combine, the potency would be too strong and instead of reaching the perfect level of creativity, every single person in the studio would be too high to record, master, or mix more than just a delicious pizza pie."
