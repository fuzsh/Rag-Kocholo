        "text": "SNOOP DOGG & WIZ KHALIFA\n\n“Mac & Devin Go to High School: Music From and Inspired by the Movie”\n\n(Doggy Style/Rostrum/Atlantic)\n\nLike any rebel child, hip-hop has had its drug phases: there was the weed haze of the early 1990s, various periods of cocaine obsession, the slow roll of syrup in the early 2000s, even a brief embrace with Ecstasy. In the last couple of years, though, hip-hop has come back around to a full-fledged weed high, thanks to the rise of Currensy and Wiz Khalifa.\n\nThat Wiz Khalifa would find kinship with Snoop Dogg, a survivor of marijuana’s first breakthrough, is no surprise. Their playful collaboration album, “Mac & Devin Go to High School,” plays like the late hours of a family reunion: comfortable, uncomplicated, a little blurry. This album is a companion piece to a movie of the same title that won’t be released until next year; from a hazy distance, the film bears at least some resemblance to “How High,” the Method Man and Redman stoner comedy from 2001.\n\nGetting high is the main topic here, natch. One song is “You Can Put It in a Zag, I’mma Put It in a Blunt”; another is “French Inhale,” for the mouth-to-nose technique. Neither rapper has much new to say, or new ways of saying it, like, say, Currensy, who’s made a career out of retelling the same inhale-exhale story with different fascinating details. But while Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa aren’t the most dexterous rappers, they’ve learned — the elder more than the youngster — how to get by on emphasis and slickness.\n\nIt makes for pleasant-sounding, unmemorable listening, driven primarily by the production, which is largely slow and bubbly. “Talent Show” and “6:30,” with their 1970s soundtrack soul, recall old Camp Lo songs. And “I Get Lifted” was produced by the Los Angeles veteran Warren G, who, like his hosts, remembers how weed rap used to sound — inhaling doesn’t damage every memory. JON CARAMANICA\n\nANTHONY HAMILTON\n\n“Back to Love” (RCA)\n\nAnthony Hamilton has a voice equally fit for soothing or supplication, and he finds time for both on his steadily engaging, rarely surprising new album, “Back to Love.” Which is just what you want from him, and just what he wants to give you. As an R&B singer upholding a distinctly grown-up masculine ideal — chivalry and constancy, strength and humility — he’s in the business of meeting expectations. So you’ll find him singing here in an imploringly mellow style, his tone conveying the deep-amber viscosity of something you’d pour over your pancakes.\n\nHe sounds marvelous. And it would be disingenuous to ignore the role that stability, in both the musical and personal sense, plays in his work. Mr. Hamilton is 40, married with a family; he’s also unfettered by any track record of lecherous club hits. “Back to Love” might seem to suggest a prodigal’s return to form, but it really refers to its title track, in which Mr. Hamilton, working an earthy falsetto, lays out a rich premise from the start: “Here we are, in the storm of our lives/ Both posing as strangers who never fell in love.”\n\nBehind the album’s thematic consistency is a sort of stealth eclecticism. Its 12 tracks, all partly written by Mr. Hamiton, range in tone and texture from earthy Southern soul to lissome 1990s-style R&B, with beats that nod toward hip-hop. “Sucka for You” awkwardly emulates the sort of funk-pop anthem now associated with Cee Lo Green.\n\nMr. Hamilton sounds truer to himself on “Never Let Go,” a pas de deux of domestic reassurance, featuring Keri Hilson; and “Best of Me,” his rundown of courtly attentions. But he also pulls off the lead single, “Woo,” a testimonial of the so-bad-but-feels-so-good variety, written with and mainly produced by Kenneth Edmonds, a k a Babyface.\n\nMr. Edmonds, a formalist with the insights of a humanist, is a good new partner for Mr. Hamilton. “Pray for Me,” another song bearing the Babyface imprint, finds Mr. Hamilton both pleading with an estranged lover and entreating the heavens, as if unsure which tactic will work best.\n\nIt’s a moment that rings with genuine desperation on an album that reeks of reassurances. And it has a follow-up of sorts in “Life Has a Way,” the closing track, produced by James Poyser. “There’s always room left to grow,” Mr. Hamilton sings near the song’s fade-out ending. He doesn’t make it sound like a welcome challenge, but he’s not flinching, either. NATE CHINEN\n\nCARL THOMAS\n\n“Conquer” (Verve Forecast)\n\nCarl Thomas thrives on tormented love. “I Wish,” the 1999 single that helped give him a million-selling debut album in 2000, agonized over falling for a married woman. And the grainy melancholy in his voice — which suggests John Legend and R. Kelly looking over their shoulders at Marvin Gaye — often signals deep misgivings, even when his romances are going more comfortably.\n\nMr. Thomas, a neo-soul singer who got his start in Chicago, had patchy success with his next two albums, which generally took a more optimistic tone. “Conquer” returns, wisely, to brooding, amid productions that juggle the retro and the futuristic.\n\nIts first single, “Don’t Kiss Me,” reaches directly back to plush, orchestral 1970s soul while Mr. Thomas stays wary. “Don’t you kiss me,” he sings, “unless those lips that you kiss me with will say I love you, love you for life.” Another track with cheerful vintage flourishes — scrubbing wah-wah guitar, horn-section buildups — turns out to be a breakup song: “It’s Not the Same,” about a couple growing apart.\n\nMr. Thomas and his producers don’t usually backdate the music so thoroughly. They savor the uneasiness of stranding Mr. Thomas’s old-school singing between eras and emotions. He’s involved with a straying woman (as he was in “I Wish”) in “It Is What It Is,” wrestling with temptation over a choppy programmed beat, whistling synthesizers and an uncomforting plucked harp. The album begins with “The Night Is Yours,” as Mr. Thomas urges a lover to “take this opportunity to make all your dreams come true.” But the music is a minor-key dirge, with an ominous electric lead guitar: a come-on delivered as if it were a warning. “Long Distance Love Affair,” over a boom-bap beat and ricocheting organ chords, is an affirmation of loyalty that’s still riddled with suspicion. In another gloomy melody Mr. Thomas complains “It Ain’t Fair” that a woman he has his eye on is so “perfect, flawless, gorgeous.”\n\nThe songs often mingle elements of R&B and hip-hop with a spacious, keyboard-laden sound and rock beat. Both the title song of “Conquer,” in which Mr. Thomas vows to “fight you and make you mine just to keep you alive,” and “Running,” which applies sports advice to life — “keep good form, maintain your speed/ endure the pain, believe” — have the billowing pomp of MTV anthems by Seal or Phil Collins. Those songs might have been overbearing, but instead, remembered wounds and self-doubt make them soulful. JON PARELES"
