        "text": "Say his name - Wiz Khalifa - and boatloads of indelible images come to mind. There's the skinny, Pittsburgh-native rapper whose deeply groovy, playful but poignant hits such as \"Black and Yellow\" speak to his affinity for all things related to his hometown. There's his marriage to Philly's Amber Rose, a love union that gave the pair a son as well as an impressive camaraderie even though the relationship dissolved in 2014.\n\nThen there's Khalifa's fervent love of weed, which litters some of his best slurry, dramatic tracks (e.g. 2011's Rolling Papers and the forthcoming Rolling Papers 2). Of course, that also gives rise (or highs) to his current teaming with fellow schmoke aficionado Snoop Dogg, the 33-city High Road Summer Tour that hits Camden's BB&T on Friday.\n\n\"Me and Snoop are really cool,\" Khalifa says happily of Dogg, who just released his first all-rap album in a minute, Coolaid. \"We're more like brothers than a business relationship, so this tour is going to be fun, because we're going to really have a dope experience behind the scenes as well as on stage.\"\n\nThat dope line could be a double entendre, but either way, it's cool. That's because Khalifa - whose last joint tour was a punk-pop thing with Fall Out Boy in 2015 - has been looking forward to working with Dogg ever since the red-eyed twosome recorded the toker's anthem \"That Good\" (with its infamous verse, \"No stick, no seeds, just Al Green\") in 2011.\n\n\"I just showed up to his crib ... and Snoop being awesome, he was just like, pick a beat out ... he put it on, I played it, and it took me about 10 or 15 seconds, and I wrote the hook. He told me that it sounded like [Snoop Dogg Pound member] Nate Dogg singing the hook, so that made me super-confident. Then he wrote his verse. Of course, he wrote it faster than I wrote mine, like 12 seconds.\"\n\nKhalifa, born Cameron Jibril Thomaz, concludes his discussion of Dogg - with whom he'll share more than a few moments on stage in Camden - with nods to Dogg's occasional moves toward pop-hop (\"Beautiful\" with Pharrell) and consistency of vision. \"There's nobody else in the game like Snoop, so having that history and being able to grow up listening to his music, and then being able to meet him and be an acquaintance of his is really cool, but the fact that he's still going and still adding to his legacy is super-dope.\"\n\nKhalifa has been doing a lot of collaborations in anticipation of Rolling Papers 2. There's his recent hit with clean-shaven pop dude Charlie Puth, \"See You Again,\" from the Furious 7 sound track. And there's the brand-new cut \"F- Apologies,\" with another pop singer, JoJo. Khalifa also recorded \"Satellite,\" with Kevin Gates, who just happens to be part of this High Road Tour with Khalifa and Dogg.\n\nThe most notable new duets, though, are those rap ragers with young, up-and-coming Philly rapper Lil Uzi Vert - tracks such as \"Countin'\" and \"Pull Up.\"\n\nKhalifa had been friendly with Uzi (a.k.a. Symere Woods) for ages without realizing the potential of his rap prowess.\n\n\"Uzi's tight, man,\" Khalifa says. \"We've been friends for about four years, but I didn't know that his music was as good as it was, even though he was also working on it at the same time as us becoming friends. I'm really proud of him.\"\n\nSo what does he think about the extra burden musicians carry these days, with the public wanting to know about their politics - and their personal lives?\n\n\"I wouldn't say it really affects me,\" Khalifa says quietly. \"I feel like that comes with any job with a little bit of scrutiny, so the amount that I deal with, that's just what I have on my plate. But I don't let it alter my mood or any moves that I make. I just continue to do me.\n\nThe High Road Tour, with Snoop Dog, Wiz Khalifa, Kevin Gates and more, 7 p.m. Friday at BB&T Pavilion, 1 Harbour Blvd., Camden, $26 (lawn)-$80.75, 800-745-3000, ticketmaster.com."
