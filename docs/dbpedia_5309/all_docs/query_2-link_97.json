        "text": "Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa have mapped out a massive Summer 2023 tour with Too $hort, Warren G, and Berner. DJ Drama will serve as the special guest.\n\nThe 33-city “High School Reunion Tour” kicks off on July 7th in Vancouver, and will make subsequent stops in Toronto, Brooklyn, Atlanta, and many more before wrapping up in Irvine, California on August 27th. See the full itinerary below.\n\nYou can purchase tickets via Stubhub — where orders are 100% guaranteed through Stubhub’s FanProtect program.\n\nRelated Video\n\n2022 was an especially packed year for future Songwriters Hall of Famer Snoop Dogg, who acquired his former label Death Row Records, appeared in the 2022 Super Bowl halftime show, and stayed busy with other ventures like a breakfast cereal initially called Snoop Loopz, his children’s television show Doggyland, and a role in Jamie Foxx’s vampire hunter movie Day Shift.\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, Snoop teamed up with BTS on Benny Blanco’s “Bad Decisions” and united with Too $hort, Ice Cube, and E-40 for a joint album as MOUNT WESTMORE. He also revealed plans for a Doggystyle sequel called Missionary and a biopic directed by Allen Hughes.\n\nMeanwhile, Wiz Khalifa’s most recent album was 2022’s Multiverse. He also linked up with Girl Talk, Big K.R.I.T., and Smoke DZA for a collaborative album of their own called Full Court Press. Revisit our interview with Wiz here."
