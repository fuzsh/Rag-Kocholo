        "text": "The High School Reunion Tour has officially hit the space city with star-studded acts DJ Drama, Berner, Warren G, Too Short, Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg.\n\nThe headlining tour of Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg is full of nostalgia as they run through their deep catalog. Throughout the night you could see fans of all ages enjoying themselves and having a great time enjoying legendary sets.\n\nAs the sun was setting in the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion the first act to step on stage was recent Grammy winner DJ Drama. Known for his classic mixtapes and voiceovers on albums he played a set for Houston to get the night started.DJ Drama also came out in between sets to keep the night in high spirits.\n\nThe next act on stage was Sunset District native Berner. The Taylor Gang signee came out with a white tee, shorts, and a big ‘ol “C” chain for his dispensary brand. He played some of his biggest hits like “20 Joints” and “Pass Me the Green”. Berner had great charisma on stage and even threw out a couple of joints for the crowd!\n\nLong Beach’s own Warren G was next on the Houston stage. Known for being part of the group “213” with Snoop Dogg and Nate Dogg, he brought that G-Funk sound to the south. During his set he also did a Nate Dogg tribute by playing some of his biggest hits. Warren G kept the California sound going with songs like “I want it all”, “Recognize”, and “Regulate”.\n\nThe last opener of the night was Too Short. The Los Angeles rapper brought the energy to the stage with his party hits. Especially “Blow the Whistle” where some fans even got their own whistle and began playing along. Too Short kept the party vibes going with songs like “Shake That Monkey” and “Gangsters & Strippers”. The California openers did a great job of setting the mood for the rest of the night.\n\nTwo of America’s biggest smokers clouded up the Cynthia Wood Mitchell Pavillion with a sold-out crowd cheering their lungs out. The first one on stage was Wiz Khalifa. “Yeah, uh huh, you know what it issss” rang throughout the pavilion as Khalifa performed his entrance song “Black and Yellow”. His demeanor on stage was so cheerful and bright that just seeing him bounce around made you feel good. During his solo set, he played songs like “The Thrill”, “Payphone”, and even brought out Too Short to perform their song “On My Level”.\n\nFinally, after so many great acts, the West Coast’s global superstar Snoop Dogg made his way on. The stage opened up and a blue lowrider pulled, Snoop Dogg then stood up, smiled, and began his set with “La da da da da it’s the D-O-double G, SNOOP DOGG!”. The crowd went insane as they heard the classic “The Next Episode”. During his set Snoop played tributes to legends like Eazy-E, Tupac, and The Notorious B.I.G. His solo set was filled with hits like “Nothing but a G Thang”, “California Gurls” and “Gin and Juice”."
