        "text": "Rapper/Singer-songwriter/actor SNOOP DOGG aka SNOOP LION (Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr.) is unquestionably one of the greatest and most popular rappers of all the time. He has sold over thirty million albums worldwide. He is known for his soft, smooth, laid back delivery, which journalist Peter Shapiro described as “molasses drawl.” He is also known for his gifts for free styling.\n\nHis music career began in 1992 when he collaborated on Dr. Dre’s solo debut, “The Chronic, and on the theme song to the feature film DEEP COVER.\n\nHis debut album, “Doggystyle” (1993) debuted at #1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts. Selling almost a million copies in the first week of its release, “Doggystyle” became certified 4× platinum in 1994 and spawned several hit singles, including “What's My Name” and “Gin & Juice.” In 1994, Snoop released a soundtrack for the short film “Murder Was The Case,” which he starred in.\n\nHis second album, “Tha Doggfather” (1996), also debuted at No. 1 on both charts with “Snoop’s Upside Ya Head” as the lead single. The album was certified double platinum in 1997. Snoop later told VH1 that he wanted to present a more positive image to the music industry, and said that he signs more “Doggfather” records than any other.\n\nSnoop’s other albums include “Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told” (1998), “No Limit Top Dogg” (1999), “Tha Last Meal” (2000), “Paid tha Cost to Be da Boss,” “R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece” (2004), “Tha Blue Carpet Treatment” (2006), and “Ego Trippin’” (2008), “Malice 'n Wonderland” (2009), and “Doggumentary” (2011).\n\nHe has collaborated often with other artists, memorably with Tupac Shakur on the track “2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted” (aka “Gangsta Party”) on 2Pac’s album “All Eyez on Me.” He has also released albums in collaboration with other artists: “The Eastsidaz” (2000) and “Duces ‘n Trayz: The Old Fashioned Way,” with Tray Deee and Goldie Loc as Tha Eastsidaz (2000); “The Hard Way,” with Nate Dogg and Warren G as 213 (2001); “Mac & Devin Go to High School,” with Wiz Khalifa (2004); and “7 Days of Funk,” with Dâm-Funk as 7 Days of Funk (2013).\n\nIn 2012, after a trip to Jamaica, Snoop announced that he had converted to the Rastafari movement and taken on new name, Snoop Lion, under which he released a reggae album, “Reincarnated” (2013), and a documentary film of the same title.\n\nSnoop has starred in numerous motion pictures and TV shows, and hosted several TV shows, including “Doggy Fizzle Televizzle,” “Snoop Dogg’s Father Hood,” and “Dogg After Dark.” He now has a weekly YouTube show, a top ten countdown of his favorite videos from upcoming and independent artists. Currently on a world tour, he is working on his last solo studio album under his rap moniker Snoop Dogg.\n\nFRAYSER BOY (Cedric Coleman) is a rapper from Memphis. He won the Best Original Song Academy Award® (shared with Three 6 Mafia members Juicy J and DJ Paul) for “It’s Hard to Be A Pimp,” from the movie HUSTLE & FLOW (2005).\n\nFrayser Boy began his career working in promotion for Three 6 Mafia’s Hypnotize Minds label, while working on his lyrical skills on the side. Three 6 were impressed and gave him a guest shot on La’ Chat’s 2001 album “Murder She Spoke.” Two years later, the Hypnotize Minds label released his solo, full-length debut, “Gone on That Bay,” the title of the hard-hitting album caused some confusion, as some thought “Bay” was a reference to the Bay Area and that Frayser Boy was West Coast. “Bay” is actually a nickname for the highest cocaine-trafficking area of Memphis and the sound of the album was tough Dirty South. He followed with two more albums for Hypnotize Minds, “Me Being Me” (2005) and “Da Key” (2008), after which he signed to Lil Wyte’s label Wyte Music, where he teamed with rapper Partee on the mixtape “The First 48” in 2012. This year, Frayser Boy released “B.A.R. (Bay Area Representatives),” a project with Lil Wyte that was ten years in the making.\n\nLIL’ P-NUT (Benjamin Flores, Jr.) is a 12-year-old American rapper, actor, dancer and singer from Memphis. He was nine and ten when he shot his scenes for TAKE ME TO THE RIVER. Lil’ P-Nut’s first rap, “You Might Be the One,” was released in 2010. His other raps include: “Bad Dream,” “Choosin,” “Walk This Way” (featuring Haunted by Heroes), “Get On Da Floor!” (with Lil’ Wicked and B-Team), “I Could Cry,” “Lil Mama,” among many others. He rapped and appeared in the video for Cymphonique’s “All That.”\n\nLil’ P-Nut also has a flourishing career as an actor, most notably voicing the role of “Atticus,” the rapping penguin in HAPPY FEET TWO (2011), for which he contributed to the tracks “Happy Feet Two Opening Medley” (with Common and Pink) and “Penguin’s Life” (with Ozomati). He also appeared in RIDE ALONG (2014), with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart, an episode of the sitcom “Are We There Yet,” and the upcoming TV movie “Santa Hunters.” Lil’ P-Nut currently stars in the Nickelodeon TV series “The Haunted Hathaways,” as “Louis,” a ghost who has to live with normal people."
