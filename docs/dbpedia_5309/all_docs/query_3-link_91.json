        "text": "Ahead of the release of his upcoming new album CoolAid, Snoop Dogg has given us a brand new track from the record, “Kush Ups.” It features none other than his nephew and fellow mary jane lover, Wiz Khalifa.\n\nIn the video for the track, the rappers make a change from their normal hip-hop streetwear, sporting some smart suits. However the rest of the visuals do not deviate much from their usual personalities as Snoop and Wiz spit verses from the song surrounded by one epic whip and some very beautiful ladies.\n\nWiz Khalifa features heavily on the track which is topically apt for the rappers as it talks about their love for weed. On the hook Khalifa provides some catchy lines which will no doubt make you laugh a little.\n\n‘My weed man got the hook up/Rolling up another pound every time you look up/Big a** joints, them ones that leave you shook up/So much weight that now I’m doing kush ups…’\n\nKJ Conteh is behind the production for “Kush Ups” and the visuals were created by Dan Fogler. The song contains a sample of “I Wanna Rock” by Luther Campbell. The track is the first single from Snoop’s album CoolAid which is set to be released in July. The West coast rapper will be dropping the LP through his very own label, Doggy Style Records.\n\nLast week Snoop appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! to announce the album, and also performed new tracks “Legend” and “Fireworks,” which is produced by Swizz Beats.\n\nCheck out the video to “Kush Ups” below.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nUnreleased J Dilla Track Features Snoop Dogg & Kokane\n\nWiz Khalifa Drops New Track “Pull Up” Ft.
