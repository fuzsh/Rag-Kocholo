        "text": "In honor of hip-hop's 50th anniversary, Call of Duty has added a selection of rappers to their list of characters for the fifth season of Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare 2 video games. One of the rappers just announced on Instagram that they partnered with the fast-food restaurant Jack in the Box for their very own meal. Another one of the chosen artists has confirmed their appearance in the upcoming COD game. Meanwhile, the other handpicked rhymester is currently on the It's All a Blur Tour.\n\nWhich Rappers Are in Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare 2?\n\nOn Thursday (July 27), Call of Duty announced on Twitter that they have added Nicki Minaj and Snoop Dogg as playable characters in the fifth season of Call of Duty: Warzone and Modern Warfare 2. Nicki Minaj will be making her first appearance in COD while Snoop Dogg is being added to the franchise's games for a second time. Last April, Call of Duty added Snoop Dogg as a playable character in Call of Duty: Vanguard and Call of Duty: Warzone.
