        "text": "Don’t Text Don’t Call\n\nWiz Khalifa & Snoop Dogg\n\nWiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg are still friends after high school.\n\nWiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg are on the Mount Rushmore of weed smokers. What’s dope about the two artists is that they typically infuse their love for kush into their music. Today, Wiz and Snoop decided to drop a new collaboration track called “Don’t Text Don’t Call.”\n\n[the_ad id=”102857″]\n\n“Don’t Text Don’t Call” is smoother than my left testicle. Not only does it boast a smooth, West coast-inspired beat, but you also get a subdued performance out of Wiz Khalifa. It’s actually Snoop Dogg that adds some punch to the track with a pretty aggressive verse. Whatever the case may be, based on the two rappers’ lyrics, it seems like they are both done with women who aren’t meeting their demands.\n\nGive “Don’t Text Don’t Call” by Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg a shot below."
