        "text": "You know what I do with my chicken?\n\nI drop it like it's hot.\n\nJump to Recipe\n\nDrop that chicken in the hot oil and watch the batter crisp-up to a perfect, golden brown.\n\nI just bought Snoop Dogg's cookbook, From Crook to Cook, Platinum Recipes from the Boss Dogg's Kitchen.\n\nMy friend bought Snoop's book as a mother's day present for her mother-in-law and I knew I had to get a copy.\n\nIt's a funny gift considering my friend's mother-in-law can't cook and has never heard of Snoop Dogg. (I'm pretty sure they don't play, “Nuthin’ But A G Thang”, on Christian Radio.) And in case you're wondering, G doesn't stand for God.\n\nMy friend has heard of Snoop, of course, and has a not-so-secret crush on him. She met him once at a bar in the East Village and Snoop told her that he liked her leather jacket. She's loved him ever since and tells anyone who will listen.\n\n\"Did I ever tell you that time I met Snoop at a bar?\" she asks.\n\nI have heard that story a dozen times but it never gets old.\n\n\"Tell me again,\" I say, and she does.\n\nOn house cleaning days, you can find my friend blasting the Hip Hop icon's music as she scrubs her kitchen floor, DoggyStyle.\n\nI never had a crush on Snoop, but I liked his music and danced to his hits during my clubbing days. I rediscovered him a few years ago on VH1's, \"Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party.\"\n\nI grew up on Martha too, watching her shows, making her recipes, and subscribing to her wedding magazine. Because of Martha, I bought an over-priced, designer wedding dress and searched for a florist who would make me bouquets of dark-purple anemones.\n\nThey seemed an unlikely pair, Snoop and Martha - The OG and Queen of the GT (the Good Thing), but it worked, and besides, Martha's totally gangsta.\n\nIn the first episode of \"Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party.\", They have a chicken wing battle where Seth Myers (Team Snoop) asks Martha if she's ever killed a chicken. Martha says she has and Seth asks her how she did it.\"\n\n\"Did you shoot it?\" Seth Myers asks.\n\n\"No,\" Martha says.\n\n\"You wrung his neck?\" Snoop asks.\n\n\"No, I fed it some vodka, and then I cut off its head.\"\n\nTeam Martha (Wiz Khalifa) lost the chicken wing battle to Snoop's potato chip-battered wings, so when reviewing this cookbook, it seemed only fitting to make a chicken recipe.\n\nSince my friend loves all things D-double O-G, and fries chicken weekly (it's one of three foods her daughter will eat), she seemed like the perfect participant to test Snoop's fried chicken and waffles recipe.\n\nTo make sure we had an authentic Snoop experience, I wanted to sip on some gin and juice while we cooked.\n\n\"The last time I drank gin and juice I woke-up in a bathtub,\" my friend said.\n\n\"We are going to make Gin and Juice 2.0,\" I say.\n\n\"You won't end-up in a bathtub, just on the floor, maybe.\"\n\nSnoop also has a recipe for a gin and juice remix. It is made with gin, apple vodka, pineapple juice, and a slice of lime - and it's real tasty. (Snoop has an entire chapter on adult drinks to sip on.)\n\nI was also surprised that Snoop and I have many of the same items in our pantries: soy sauce, honey, cans of tuna, hot sauce, and ketchup. Snoop says the ketchup must be Heinz, and I agree. Heinz is the best ketchup, and being that it originated in my hometown, Snoop's won more brownie points with me.\n\nSpeaking of brownies, this cookbook is filled with recipes that the whole family will enjoy, like his Bow Wow Brownies and Ice Cream (barring you omit any green stuff from the brownies and keep the gin out of the juice).\n\nSome of Snoop's other family-friendly recipes include: Mack and cheese, Baby Got Back Ribs, Spaghetti de la Hood, and he even has a recipe for Fried Bologna Sandwiches (which I grew-up eating too).\n\nNot only does Snoop give us a peek at the staples in his fridge and his pantry, but he also gives a list of his favorite restaurants, his favorite cereals and munchies, and his suggested playlist to cook by.\n\nThere are lots of luscious desserts, too, like Gimme S'more Pie and Go Shorty, It's Your Birthday Cake.\n\nAnother reason I like this book is that Snoop gives measurements in standard measuring cups and in grams. It's no surprise that Snoop likes to measure things in grams but it shows he's a real boss C to the -double O -K.\n\nBack at our OG test kitchen, I patted the chicken dry from its overnight brine. (Snoop starts with a brine of water, sugar, salt, bay leaf, hot pepper flakes, and orange peel.)\n\nMy friend dipped the chicken in a dry mix of flour, cornmeal, cayenne pepper, baking powder, pepper, and salt, dipped it in buttermilk, and got to frying.\n\nThe crust was crunchy and crisp, a little tangy from the buttermilk, a little spicy from the cayenne, and the chicken was moist and juicy. It was the first time I had chicken and waffles. I wasn't sure I would like the sweet syrup on the chicken, but man was it good.\n\nI'm not kidding when I tell you that this is the best-fried chicken I have ever eaten.\n\nMy friend and I loved it, our families loved it, and they want to know when we are making more.\n\nFrom Crook to Cook is a super fun book with legit recipes that are off the hook (see what I did there?) proving that the Boss Dogg has chops on stage and in the kitchen."
