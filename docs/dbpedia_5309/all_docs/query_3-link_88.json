        "text": "By Lucía Tedesco via El Planteo\n\nArtists Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa announced on Instagram that a new movie is coming and that it will have the two of them as the main characters. It's the sequel to the stoner comedy they made together in 2012, \"Mac & Devin Go to High School.\"\n\nThe humorous film told the story of two high school students. One was a child prodigy and the other was a senior going on his 15th year of school who spent his time smoking pot. Together they shared experiences and make mischief. Probably, something like this will be seen in the next audiovisual project.\n\nSee also: Tommy Chong & Friends Light Up The Screen In 'That 70's Show' Sequel: Are Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis And Topher Grace Stoners Too?\n\n\"We are the new Cheech and Chong,\" Wiz wrote in the post announcing the reunion. Meanwhile, Snoop anticipated that there will be more news this summer. In 2014, the sequel seemed to be on track, but for some reason that is still unknown, the project was shelved until now.\n\nEven though the first film was not very successful, it became a classic stoner movie and increased the popularity of the song \"Young, Wild And Free,\" sung by both artists along with Bruno Mars. What songs will be included in the soundtrack of this new film? Place your bets!\n\nContinue reading: Miss Representation: Why Mainstream Cinema And TV Are In Debt With Stoner Women\n\nMás contenido de El Planteo en español:"
