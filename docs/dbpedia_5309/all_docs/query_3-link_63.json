        "text": "1 / 23\n\nI am that girl on the subway, the one with her Beats headphones turned up so loud that the entire jam-packed car can hear what is on my Spotify. I do not block out the stress of the early-morning rush hour with Justin Bieber’s latest album (let’s face it, that is what you would expect a 26-year-old blonde fashion girl to be jamming out to, right?), nor with calming classical music like my adorable old-soul fiancé does—instead I’ve got “current mood,” my latest Spotify playlist, on loop.\n\nI grew up in San Diego in the 2000s, obsessed with skaters, punk, ’90s grunge, ska, surf, and hip-hop . . . all of which are essentially the DNA of SoCal youth culture, and even after nine years in New York City, my feelings have not wavered. But my wardrobe of Dickies, Vans Sk8s, and Stüssy was pushed to the back of my closet to make way for the more “of the moment” pieces of a Vogue editor—until now, that is.\n\nAs soon as I saw previews for Straight Outta Compton, the biopic about N.W.A, probably the most influential rap group ever, I texted my friend Chris, who, like me, knows almost as much, if not more, about rap than about what is happening in fashion (she is the PR director at Alexander Wang, after all), and we made a date. We both arrived straight from work—Chris, looking cool as ever in fresh Wang engineer-striped denim, and me in a Libertine slip dress, vintage Chanel jacket, and a monogrammed straw tote bag (proof, unfortunately, is on her Instagram). I looked straight outta Connecticut. Luckily, Chris snuck a bottle of twist-off red wine into the theater, which both temporarily numbed my insecurities, yet solidified the fact that I could not possibly be any further from the girl I was 10 years ago (when a 40-ounce would have been more apropos). The film was incredible—the music (obviously), the casting, the wardrobe. We left feeling blissful, so amped up we walked 10 blocks in the wrong direction to rehash the movie scene by scene with descriptors like dope, lit, and tight. I felt invigorated and nostalgic—reminiscing about my own youth in SoCal and also finding a resurrected respect for how influential and significant N.W.A was, and still is, for hip-hop. Since then, my collection of Dickies and Vans has only expanded and become, once again, my favorite uniform.\n\nFast-forward to a few months ago, at a party in Los Angeles, where I met Mike Comrie. A Canadian by way of Salt Lake City, he shares the same affinity that I have for hip-hop and fashion. After trying to impress each other with who knew more about either subject, we finally gave up and immediately became best friends. It wasn’t until many conversations later that I learned that in addition to his clothing line The/End (remember those jeans on Miguel? Yep, those are his!), he is also Ty Dolla $ign’s stylist. What?! The Ty $? Who are you?! I remember texting aggressively—almost angry that he hadn’t brought it up before. Of course, I forced him to tell me everything, right down to the 28-inch crop and 7-inch taper that he does to customize Ty’s Original Fit Dickies. Then it got me thinking: The look of SoCal hip-hop is not only distinct, it also really hasn’t changed much since the days of N.W.A cruising in their low-riders wearing coaches’ jackets, snap-backs, Dickies, Carhartt, Vans, and Converse. The only thing really different now are the cars.\n\nAnd so my mission began, to trace the look of SoCal hip-hop and discover how it’s being translated today. Now it is time for me to shut up and let the Taylor Gang crew have the floor. Check out my interview with Ty Dolla $ign and his stylist, Comrie, and Wiz Khalifa’s stylist, Lauren Matos.\n\nTy, your style is influenced by an amazing mix that includes SoCal punk, skate, and hip-hop references, and you have certainly created a signature “Ty look.” I would love to hear about how you think your style has evolved over time.\n\nTy Dolla $ign: It’s definitely evolved . . . I’m from the West Coast, you know, so that’s definitely a big part of my style: khakis, Vans, but then it’s punky, too, because I put the leather jacket [and shit] and the Germs and the Bad Brains patches. I was bandana heavy, but then everyone else started, and whenever anyone else starts doing what I’ve been doing, I always switch, you know, because I can’t just have people copying [shit].\n\nAre you still wearing that earring? With the cross? I absolutely love it.\n\nTDS: Yeah, I’m wearing that earring for sure. I’m definitely wearing this earring and no one can take that!\n\nLauren, Mike mentioned how Wiz is really into the concept of getting away from the conspicuous consumption angle, like not dropping the names of brands in his lyrics or rocking noticeable designer pieces (like head-to-toe Versace or Givenchy). There is a definite “Wiz look” that’s very organic to him. What are you thinking about when creating this with Wiz?\n\nLauren Matos: Wiz still skateboards, and I think he does an awesome mix of the skate with the high end and the vintage. He gives me an idea of what he wants to wear or a vision of Jimi Hendrix, and I tailor it so it’s within Wiz’s own style.\n\nWiz is not originally from SoCal, but he speaks to that identity, am I right?\n\nLM: He’s definitely very California; the album he’s working on now, as he’s explained it to me, is very West Coast rap—like he idolizes Snoop and it’s very much that laid-back mentality. He wears vintage clothes, he loves his Saint Laurent and his Dries, because I do, too—I dress him like I would want to dress. He has an awareness now of brands, but he loves to wear his vintage T-shirts and Levi’s as well.\n\nTy, what you wear in concerts is super-authentic to your music and vibe as a person, which is very inspiring, and I think your fans are taking notice, the mix of high and low; it’s an attainable look.\n\nTDS: How I dress for me is comfortable onstage—maybe I dress dressy for a club, but for concerts I just wear leather Vans instead of the usual fabric. I’m never trying to wear something with a logo all on it. I do have a couple Bape sweatsuits and Supreme, but I’m not really a logo man; I’m more just comfortable. It’s always been corny to me when people wear a gang of Gucci or Louis; that’s just terrible.\n\nDo you feel like your California look is influencing people?\n\nTDS: Definitely, and that part is cool. It’s not that much of a copy—khakis and Vans aren’t a look—but when you start copying my earrings or hair, I’m like, let me live . . . . But influencing, that’s what I want to do, that’s what I’m here for. Hopefully we’re giving them the right things.\n\nI think for a lot of people now on the fashion side, it’s kind of anti-trend; rather, it’s about authenticity: denim, workwear, retro sneakers, the type of clothing that we all have nostalgia for, mixed with the super-high-end stuff. West Coast hip-hop is back and people are paying attention, and that SoCal look is slowly trickling into what designers are doing, not just street and skate labels. Raf Simons, for example, is inspired by hip-hop, skate, and street.\n\nMike Comrie: Raf’s designs for men come from an authentic place—not from some obscure concept. They are hard and fast references from real places. So much of his stuff is rooted in punk and anti-establishment iconography, which directly translates to a particular creative aspect of youth, skateboarding, listening to punk and hip-hop, kids finding their identity.\n\nAny other designers or labels you are excited about?\n\nMC: It’s not so much fashion brands or items in particular I get excited about. I get excited when I go to dress Ty and put together a look, that creative process. At a certain point I don’t even care what the label is, I care about really amazing pieces. I don’t let labels dictate a look. I create a look based on what’s available, and there are certain stores or brands we go to more often, but we don’t say, “Oh, I’m going to get some Gucci.” With the Taylor Gang crew it’s about an overall aesthetic. It is more than just putting celebrities in outfits—I think it’s evident with Ty and with Wiz that it’s an evolving collaboration.\n\nLauren, what are your favorite labels to use when working with Wiz? What are his favorites?\n\nLM: The perfect fit for him is Saint Laurent. I never have to have an alteration done, everything fits him like a glove, and it looks amazing. I could see him walking Saint Laurent’s runway and killing it. I just made him a pair of bell-bottoms out of Saint Laurent jeans and he was obsessed. It’s very Jimi Hendrix, Black Panther, that Bob Marley look all mixed into one.\n\nHe has really blended the SoCal look with rock ’n’ roll and punk; he has embraced it in a very authentic way.\n\nMC: Lauren has the same philosophy as I do when it comes to styling, and that’s how our friendship came about. Working with the Taylor Gang, it’s a philosophy—a philosophy of building an authentic aesthetic over the course of time that reflects this individual and his creativity as opposed to just wearing expensive or cool shit. Ty, Wiz—they have specific styles, and a lot of it is that SoCal notion of swag. Like Snoop back in the day, cruising in a low-rider in a coach jacket, or Ice Cube in all black with a snap-back: That was fly back in the day and it was really about what you looked like cruising down the block in your hood with your friends. That translates into Taylor Gang in general: Everyone rocking the cutoff Dickies, Ty pairing his with Vans and high socks, Wiz in his Chucks—the whole squad has a vibe together, a swag look."
