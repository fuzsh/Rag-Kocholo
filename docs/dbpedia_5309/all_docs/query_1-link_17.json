        "text": "Lawyers representing 17 people injured when a railing collapsed at a Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa concert in New Jersey have filed a lawsuit against the venue’s operator and the performers claiming they didn’t take enough precautions to ensure concertgoers would be safe.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Wednesday in a Philadelphia court, doesn’t specify what damages are being sought.\n\nBut attorney Robert J. Mongeluzzi said his clients want to prevent future incidents and deserve monetary compensation. The plaintiffs include 14 concertgoers and three workers, including one who suffered a fractured spine, attorneys say.\n\nWATCH BELOW: 42 people injured when a railing collapses at Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa concert in New Jersey\n\nA partition separating a lawn from a secondary stage set up at the rear of the seating section collapsed shortly after the show began August 5 at Camden’s BB&T Pavilion, causing people to fall roughly 10 feet onto the concrete below.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAuthorities have said 42 people were hurt in the collapse, which occurred as the rappers were gesturing to fans to move toward the small stage.\n\nLawyers say concertgoers were trampled and pinned to the ground, causing some to have broken bones, torn ligaments and tendons, loss of consciousness and emotional trauma.\n\n“I can tell you there is no doubt there was a crowd surge based upon the setup of the lawn with no chairs and no aisles, lack of security … and then the artists telling people to come forward,” Mongeluzzi said. “That’s the setup, and that’s the failure.”\n\nREAD MORE: Snoop Dogg, Martha Stewart team up to host dinner parties\n\nLive Nation, which operates the venue, announced after the railing collapse that it had “secured” the fallen section of railing. It also said in a statement at the time that it was working with authorities and structural engineers to determine the cause of the collapse. It has since set up a safety zone to block a section of space in front of the railing.\n\nMongeluzzi said Live Nation’s actions were “really a post-accident admission that this is the way it should’ve been set up.”\n\nTrending Now\n\nThe economy’s fine, but you’re not getting ahead: Welcome to the ‘me-cession’\n\nWestJet warns flight cancellations following Calgary hailstorm will continue\n\nLive Nation declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nREAD MORE: Rappers The Game and Snoop Dogg hold anti-gang summit in Los Angeles\n\nWiz Khalifa, whose real name is Cameron Thomaz, and Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Cordozar Calvin Broadus Jr., were ushered from the stage moments after the railing collapse, and the show was cancelled. Calls and emails to the artists’ representatives requesting comment were not immediately returned.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nLawyers say their first step will be requesting an inspection of the area and the railing to determine the cause of the collapse.\n\nPhiladelphia-based firm Saltz, Mongeluzzi, Barrett & Bendesky PC has represented clients in similar cases, including a bleacher railing collapse at Veterans Stadium in 1998.\n\nAttorney Andrew Duffy said lawyers are “extremely confident” they met the legal requirement for having the case litigated in Philadelphia, despite the concert’s New Jersey venue. Live Nation operates venues nationally and does significant business in Philadelphia County, Duffy said."
