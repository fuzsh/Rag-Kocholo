        "text": "Wiz Khalifa, Snoop Dogg\n\nRappers Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg are seen performing during Hot 97's Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, June 1, 2014 in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\n\n(Donald Traill | Invision | AP)\n\nSnoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa kicked off the \"MERRY JANE Presents The High Road Summer Tour\" last week and, to no one's surprise, marijuana is a big theme.\n\nThe rappers have announced that 18 of their 33 joint concerts are \"approved for medicinal or recreational marijuana use,\" including two in Upstate New York. Shows on Aug. 7 at SPAC (Saratoga Performing Arts Center) and Aug. 13 at Syracuse's Lakeview Amphitheater are now being promoted as venues where medical pot is allowed.\n\nAre they high? Probably.\n\nMerryJane.com is a Snoop-owned media platform featuring weed-related news and videos, and Khalifa launched his own line of cannabis products on April 20, including his own strain called Khalifa Kush. On top of that, the two hip-hop stars have collaborated on songs like \"Kush Ups\" (\"My weed man got the hook up, rollin' up another pound e'ery time you look up\") , \"I Get Lifted\" (\"I'm just soaking up this breeze, smoking on some trees\") and \"Young, Wild & Free\" (\"Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun\").\n\nBoth also frequently light up on stage and claim to smoke as many as 81 blunts per day -- each.\n\nBut can you legally smoke up at the Lakeview Amphitheater? Bluntly speaking, no.\n\nNew York state did legalize medical marijuana this past year, but it's only allowed for patients with 10 conditions, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury with spasticity, ALS, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathy, and Huntington's disease. Patients must have registry identification cards. Recreational marijuana use is still against the law.\n\nAlso, medical marijuana is only legal in pills and liquids. Smoking it is not permitted.\n\nThe Lakeview Amphitheater is an open-air facility, but does not allow smoking within the covered pavilion area. Smoking (of tobacco cigarettes) is allowed outside the pavilion, though the venue \"kindly ask[s] that you smoke away from seating areas - especially if guests around you are complaining.\"\n\nNevertheless, don't be surprised to see Snoop and Wiz puffing some herb on stage, as they did in North Carolina, Florida and Alabama this past week -- none of which were approved for medical or recreational marijuana use.\n\nOther performers on the tour include \"2 Phones\" rapper Kevin Gates, singer Jhene Aiko (heard on Omarion's hit \"Post to Be\"), Odd Future affiliate Casey Veggies, and DJ Drama. Syracuse-based rapper Chris \"Oxburg\" Leonard, who won a SAMMY award in 2008, will also take the Lakeview Amphitheater stage.\n\nNote: Video contains explicit lyrics."
