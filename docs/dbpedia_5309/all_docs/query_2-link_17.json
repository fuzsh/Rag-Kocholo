        "text": "1. I'm an idiot? You swear at a simple argument. Is dealead a word?\n\n2. Drug dealers are losers. You said \"he dealead drugs because he was a rapper\". So wait, you are speaking for all of the rappers in the United States.\n\n3. I didn't know rappers were drug dealers, I thought it involved music.\n\n4. \"you just love to be a hater\". That's moronic. I don't hate, I dislike. So, what, I'm a disliker. \"you just love to be a dislike\".\n\n5. We are speaking about his intelligence, I proving to you he was a drug dealer and drug dealers aren't intelligent. They ruin families for money.\n\nWhen did this become about intelligence? Anyways...I don't want to get into this with you because you seem very convinced in what you believe and I'm not one to argue with stubborn people. BUT, I thought I should ask you something...you say he was a drug dealer...how long ago was that? How is it relevant when it was 20 plus years ago??\n\nBy the way...most drug dealers are smart. I'm not talking about standing on the corner, slanging rocks all day/all night long, I'm talking about drug traffickers, they are smart enough that in most cases they do not get caught.\n\n\"OMG, drugs kill and ruin families!!\" Right...because addicts don't have a choice and they are forced to shoot up heroin or smoke crack rocks by drug dealers. It's called supply and demand. There's lots of demand. So if someone decides to become a drug dealer, it's their choice, a choice that they have made to take advantage of an already corrupt and flawed system. Dealers know the potential consequences they face such as jail or getting shot/killed. They take the risks just like the addicts take the risks of getting high. Why? Because it's their choice! It's not the dealers that ruin families, it's the selfish addicts that ruin their own families. Your buddy Jim Morrison was a junkie, and I'm guessing you blame his dealer for his OD, when in reality it was his own fault that he OD'd.\n\nI still don't think you will get my point...Hip hop has evolved since the late 80's and early 90's. Just because some rappers rap about bitches, money and drugs doesn't mean that's all there is to rap music. As other members have pointed out, there is a lot of quality rap music coming from some young guys. You might want to open your eyes and not be so narrow minded, or just don't bother commenting on topics that you have no actual knowledge about because it just makes you look like the unintelligent one. Maybe stick to topics about The Doors...\n\nOT: I hope that to hear at least one track by Snoop in the game. I don't expect Wiz to be on the soundtrack."
