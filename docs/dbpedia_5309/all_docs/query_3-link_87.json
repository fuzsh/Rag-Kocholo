        "text": "Snoop Dogg is praying for peace following the death of rapper Drakeo the Ruler. The Los Angeles artist died over the weekend after being stabbed backstage at the Once Upon a Time in L.A. Fest, headlined by several other legendary artists, including the “Gin and Juice” emcee.\n\nOn Sunday, Dec. 19, Snoop, whose real name is Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr., took to his Twitter account following the devastating news of Drakeo’s death with a heartfelt message and call to action.\n\n“I’m saddened by the events that took place last night at the Once Upon a Time in LA festival. My condolences go out to the family and loved ones of Drakeo the Ruler,” the 50-year-old began. “I’m not with anything negative and as one of the many performers, I was there to spread positive vibes only to my city of LA. Last night I was in my dressing room when I was informed about the incident and chose to immediately leave the festival grounds,” he continued.\n\n“My prayers go out to everyone affected by tragedy. Please take care, love one another and stay safe ya’ll,” he added. “IM PRAYING FOR PEACE IN HIP HOP.”\n\nOther celebrities echoed Snoop’s message, including Drake. The Canadian rapper teamed up with Drakeo the Ruler for a track titled “Talk to Me” earlier this year. On his Instagram Story over the weekend, the “God’s Plan” rapper wrote, “Nah man this sh-it isn’t right for real wtf are we doing.” He added, “Always picked my spirit up with your energy. RIP Drakeo.”\n\nWiz Khalifa called on entertainers to “try some sh-t next year.” The “Black and Yellow” rapper suggested artists star “Minding our own business. Not dis respecting each others family, dead homies, or area they come from. Stop using someone else’s significant other as a one up to the other person. Actually showing the same love you expect to get.”\n\nWiz made sure to note that he was “not sayin any of these are a direct cause of violence” but suggested that “changin em could help.”\n\nMany people appeared to agree with the rap star, including one Twitter user who wrote, “This is how you properly use your platform.. much respect.”\n\nDrakeo’s death is the latest loss for hip-hop. The death of Drakeo, born Darrell Wayne Caldwell, was confirmed by his publicist. Last month, rapper Young Dolph was gunned down in his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, while he stopped to grab cookies from a local bakery.\n\nMore Stories from Our Partners:\n\n‘Rest In Melody Hub’: The Roots Founding Member Leonard ‘Hub’ Hubbard Passes Away at 62\n\nHomebuyer ‘Love Letters’ Could Result in Bias, Real Estate Firm Wants to Block New Oregon Law Banning Them"
