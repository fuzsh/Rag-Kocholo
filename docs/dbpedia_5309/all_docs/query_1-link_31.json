        "text": "Rapper and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg is at it again with another canned drink hitting the market with the launch of Cali Cocktails. In partnership with the wine brand 19 Crimes, the canned cocktails are inspired by Snoop’s “laid-back” Cali lifestyle.\n\nAccording to the news release, it’s available in two flavors: Smokin’ Strawberry Margarita and Long Beach Lemonade. The Cali Cocktails features an agave wine base. Both flavors are lightly carbonated with “bold flavors.”\n\n“We’re thrilled to continue our partnership with Snoop Dogg and celebrate another hot product launch,” explained Kris Ann Brady, vice president of marketing at 19 Crimes, in a statement. “19 Crimes has always pushed the boundaries of traditional wine culture, and together with Snoop, we’re ready to disrupt the RTD space.”\n\nCali Cocktails is Snoop Dogg’s fifth collaboration with 19 Crimes and joins his popular portfolio of wines Snoop Cali Red, Cali Rosé, Cali Gold, and Cali Blanc. Rolling out now at retailers nationwide, Cali Cocktails are packaged in 335-ml cans and available in four-packs for a suggested retail price of $14.99.\n\n“It took a while to perfect this one, but it’s just on time. California has always been home, so it only made sense to celebrate that California state of mind as my next ‘Cali’ creation,” Snoop Dogg shared. “To everyone doing their thing, in Cali, or elsewhere, this toast is for you. This coast is for you.”\n\nIn April, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg teamed up to launch their canned cocktail brand Gin & Juice. The company, of course, gets its name from Snoop Dogg’s Doggystyle track “Gin and Juice,” which was produced by Dr. Dre.\n\nAccording to FoodManufacturing.com, the Gin & Juice pre-mixed cocktail has a 5.9% ABV and four flavors. These flavors include citrus, apricot, melon, and passionfruit. The brand is sold in packs of four, one of each flavor. They can be found at participating retailers and liquor stores starting at $11.99.\n\n“Together, we always try to create magic, we’re having fun being creative, and everything about this product is really us,” Dr. Dre told the outlet. “There’s passion behind it, and friendship and love and a culture. We’re shooting to make everything we do magnificent, and fortunately, most of the time, we hit the target.”\n\nSnoop Dogg added, “A lot of times people have been in a relationship for 30 years and can’t talk to each other, can’t hang out, so it’s just fun to be in a partnership with people that you actually love.”\n\nKayla is the midday host on Detroit’s 105.1 The Bounce.
