Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa's collaboration on 'That Good' is a vibrant homage to cannabis culture, encapsulating their shared love for marijuana. The song's lyrics are a testament to their lifestyle, where smoking weed is not just a habit but a significant part of their identity. From the very beginning, Wiz Khalifa sets the tone by emphasizing the quality of the marijuana he smokes, mentioning 'no stick, no seeds, just Al Green,' which refers to high-quality, seedless cannabis. This sets the stage for a song that is as much about the act of smoking as it is about the camaraderie and lifestyle that comes with it.

Snoop Dogg's verse delves deeper into the cultivation and appreciation of marijuana. He speaks about the care and attention he gives to growing his plants, highlighting a sense of pride and dedication. The reference to 'Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong' draws a parallel to the iconic stoner duo, suggesting that they are the modern-day torchbearers of cannabis culture. The imagery of 'smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams' paints a picture of a laid-back, dreamlike state that is often associated with marijuana use. Snoop's lyrics also touch on the social aspect of smoking, where sharing a joint becomes a communal activity that brings people together.

The chorus, repeated throughout the song, reinforces the central theme of smoking high-quality marijuana. The lines 'I'm smoking everywhere I go' and 'I always gotta keep one rolled' emphasize the omnipresence of weed in their lives. Wiz Khalifa's second verse adds a layer of luxury and success to the narrative, with mentions of expensive champagne, ocean views, and financial prosperity. This juxtaposition of weed culture with elements of wealth and success challenges the stereotypical image of marijuana users, presenting them as successful, high-achieving individuals who enjoy the finer things in life. The song ultimately serves as an invitation to join their world, where smoking weed is celebrated and embraced as a way of life.
