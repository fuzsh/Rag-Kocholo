yes wiz khalifa and snoop dogg are related

no they aren't in "young wild and free" snoop dogg says "two inches to the left little nephew" but there is no relation. in the interview at the end of Mac and Devin Go To High School they asked Snoop how he heard of Wiz and he responded saying "my eldest son was listing to wiz and told me about him"

Is nipsey hussle related to snoop dogg?

That's plain to see that they're related no way they couldn't be related cause they look like identical twins, the same with Wiz Khalifa all of them look like triplettes Snoop Dogg, Nipsey Hussle &amp; Wiz Khalifa they're all related in some way I just know it. *Daz Dillinger, Nate Dogg, Ray J &amp; Brandy, RBX &amp; Lil 1/2 Dead are also Snoop Doggs real life cousins
