        "text": "Latest situation: Israel and Hizbollah’s biggest exchange of fire since the 2006 war\n\nThe Israeli military targeted rocket launcher sites in Lebanon with a wave of air strikes early on Sunday, just days after responding to a rocket barrage from Hizbollah. Hizbollah said later on Sunday it had fired more than 300 Katyusha rockets and a large number of drones at 11 military targets in Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\n\nThe two have traded fire since Hizbollah began strikes on Israel after Hamas’s October 7 attack in “solidarity” with the Palestinian militant group. The exchanges have caused evacuations and destruction in northern Israel and southern Lebanon.\n\nThe latest attacks came as Egypt was due to host talks aimed at ending the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and to prevent it escalating into a regional war. The US has sent fighter jets and additional warships to the region to help defend Israel and to further deter Hizbollah and Iran.\n\nImpact on population: Death toll in Gaza rises above 40,000; 100 hostages still in captivity\n\nThe death toll from Israel’s offensive in Gaza passed 40,000 in August, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nAccording to data from UN OCHA and Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, 594 Palestinians in the West Bank and 1,870 Israelis and foreign nationals in Israel have also been killed since October 7.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces launched air and land offensives in Gaza in response to Hamas’s cross-border assault in southern Israel. Hamas killed more than 1,200 people during the attack and seized about 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials, who say around 100 hostages remain in captivity.\n\nHumanitarian workers inside Gaza have faced significant danger during the conflict, with an unprecedented number also being killed.\n\nSeven international aid workers were killed in an April strike, with Israel later admitting that its soldiers had made errors in targeting the humanitarian convoy. More than 200 employees of UNRWA, a UN agency that provides aid and support to Palestinians, have also been killed.\n\nAfter October 7, the IDF initially moved into northern Gaza before sweeping south towards Khan Younis and then Rafah. On May 24 the International Court of Justice said conditions in Rafah were “disastrous” and ordered Israel to “immediately halt” its military offensive in the city.\n\nMore than 2mn people in Gaza have been displaced by the conflict, with many leaving Rafah and some moving to al-Mawasi or other IDF-declared “humanitarian areas”.\n\nFood and water insecurity: Israel’s allies condemn far-right minister’s Gaza starvation remarks\n\nIsrael’s European allies have condemned remarks by far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich after he said the country may be justified in starving 2mn Gazans in order to force Hamas to release hostages.\n\nAid deliveries containing urgently needed food, water and medical supplies have not been able to enter Gaza at their usual levels since the war began.\n\nThe shortages have worsened since IDF troops took “operational control” of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing on May 6.\n\nThe struggle to access food aid, which is urgently needed to prevent Gazans slipping into famine, is forecast to have reached “catastrophic” levels.\n\nThe US built a $230mn floating pier to help get more aid into Gaza, but shipments have been affected by storms and poor sea conditions, and the project was mothballed in July.\n\nSince Israel launched its Gaza offensive, damage to infrastructure and lack of fuel and electricity have also led to a severe water shortage.\n\nBefore the war, Gaza sourced most of its water from an underground aquifer or from Israeli state-owned water company Mekorot. According to an April UN OCHA report, two of the Mekorot pipelines have been closed and the third is operating at only partial capacity. Israel has recently moved towards reopening them after pressure from the US.\n\nMeanwhile, only one of the six wastewater treatment plants and two out of three desalination plants are partially working.\n\nInfrastructure damage: More than half of Gaza’s buildings damaged by fighting\n\nAccording to damage assessments from researchers at the CUNY Graduate Center and Oregon State University, more than half of all buildings across the Gaza Strip have suffered damage, rising to nearly 80 per cent in Gaza City.\n\nThe damage in Khan Younis and Rafah has also increased as Israel expanded its offensive from northern Gaza to the rest of the territory.\n\nOctober 7 2023: Hamas attacks Israel\n\nAs much of Israel slept, Hamas militants launched an multipronged dawn assault on the country from the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe assault began in the early hours of the morning on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, with thousands of rockets fired at Israeli towns and cities. Many were intercepted by Israel’s Iron Dome defence system, but satellite imagery showed fires and smoke rising from locations that were hit.\n\nHundreds of Hamas fighters simultaneously attacked by land, air and sea, breaching the fortified barrier between Gaza and Israel.\n\nMilitants used motorised paragliders to attack the Supernova music festival, which was taking place not far from the Gaza border. After flying in, they shot many Israelis and took others as hostages.\n\nAfter breaching the Gaza fence, armed Hamas fighters targeted Israeli communities and military sites at several locations, going door-to-door and performing execution-style killings as well as taking hostages.\n\nMore than 1,200 Israeli civilians and troops were killed on October 7, according to Israeli officials — making it the deadliest attack on the country since its foundation."
