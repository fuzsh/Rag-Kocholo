        "text": "The first image that rushes to one’s mind when the name of Morena is mentioned is that of turbaned dacoits on horses, clothed in black, guns in their hands, and rushing through the ravines of the Chambal valley, leaving a trail of dust behind them.\n\nMorena is a city and itself a District in northern Madhya Pradesh and once used to be called Mayuravana before the name became truncated to its present name. The place gets its name from “mor” (peacock) and “raina”- which means a place where peacocks are found in abundance and is home to the largest number of peacocks in India. Apart from its temples and archaeological finds, Morena is famous for this simple yet addictive confectionary; Gajak.\n\nThe word Gajak is onomatopoea as it is the sound made when this crusted delicacy is bit between the teeth. Gajak as a delicacy can be defined as a Layered or crusted sweet made from sugar or jaggery containing grains and dry fruits. The delicacy is prepared with sesame seeds and jaggery by a method which is time consuming. It takes about 10–15 hours to prepare 5–8 kilograms of gajak. The dough is hammered until all the sesame seeds break down and release their oils into the dough. It is believed that it is due to some components in the water of the Chambal River, that a sweet came to be developed from it. It is also said that Gajak derives its name form a Persian word “gazak” which originally is a relish (modern sense of चखना Chakhna) which was eaten while consuming wine, opium or hemp.\n\nWhile the traditional Sesame Gajak remains the most popular, with time, various regions have added their own unique twists to this delicacy. Ingredients like Groundnut, cashew, and almonds are also added sometimes to enhance the flavor and texture.\n\nAccording to a belief, in the 1930s, Sitaram Shivhare in Morena decided to give a festive twist by combining the ingredients of Gajak with spices like cardamom and cinnamon, and came up with a celebratory sweet called Khasta Gajak.\n\nIn the state of Punjab, Gajak is an integral part of the harvest Lohri festival. In Gujarat, it is often enjoyed during the kite-flying festival of Uttarayan.\n\nIn recent times, Gajak has evolved beyond its traditional roots. With the arrival of modern packaging and commercial production, the delicacy has become more accessible, impressing wider epicures across the nation. The Gajak manufacturers of Morena have united under the Morena Gajak Mandal Association (MGMA) and submitted a proposal to apply for a GI tag. The town located in the heart of the once dacoit infested Chambal valley, will now have a new identity of the dish. Morena will be renowned for not only for chaos but something sweet and crunchy as well."
