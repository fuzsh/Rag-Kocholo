        "text": "A service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural pattern in computer software design in which application components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any vendor, product or technology. A service is a self-contained unit of functionality, such as retrieving an online bank statement. By that definition, a service is an operation that may be discretely invoked. However, in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), a service is an interface definition that may list several discrete services/operations. And elsewhere, the term service is used for a component that is encapsulated behind an interface. This widespread ambiguity is reflected in what follows. Services can be combined to provide the functionality of a large software application.SOA makes it easier for software components on computers connected over a network to cooperate. Every computer can run any number of services, and each service is built in a way that ensures that the service can exchange information with any other service in the network without human interaction and without the need to make changes to the underlying program itself.\n\nFull stack web development with JavaScript has become a trend these days with number of ecommerce companies opting to implement full stack JavaScript web applications for their needs. Full stack JavaScript web applications are those that are developed with JS. Both the backend as well as the frontend of these web based applications are built with JavaScript. Execution of these JavaScript applications would require node.js. Node.js is a runtime environment on which JavaScript applications are executed. As node.js technology was put onto the server, it enabled development of scalable network applications.\n\nActually, MEAN is a good example of this full stack JavaScript technology and uses four technologies â MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js, thereby helping in development of complete web applications. Here MongoDB is a schema-less, NoSQL database which stores data in form of JSON documents. Here we can write JSON queries on ExpressJS and NodeJS server and seamlessly pass these JSOn documents to AngularJS frontend. Here AngularJS can also be replaced with other technologies like backbone.js, ember.js or any other kind of JavaScript framework. Today there are various kinds of JavaScript modules and build tools that make development and structuring of javaScript applications much easier. Itâs always preferred to use the tools based on Node.js technology like Bower or say Component for front-end management, Grunt.js or Gulp.js for automated development processes, Jasmine or Mocha.js for unit testing tasks and RequireJ or Browserify for module loading. Hence, all the web application development tasks are possible to perform with tools based on Node.JS technology. Applications can be developed with optimum utilization of network resources and file systems with full stack frameworks under use. Real time conflict resolution, shared server and client rendering, automatic data synchronization are the real time benefits of leveraging full stack MVC frameworks for web development. It is possible to develop speedy and much more interactive applications using this full stack technology. Scalable applications are possible to develop with full stack that allows for code reuse thereby cutting down the time and efforts employed in the application development process. Rendering pages in two different places with similar routes, templates and business logic will significantly reduce the load time of the pages and this is possible only with the use of full stack JavaScript technology. It automatically helps in synchronization of data from everywhere on real time basis. As it is MVC framework, just like the other Model-View-Controller based frameworks, here also the template changes will automatically update the view as the model changes and reverse is also possible. It can possibly help in data synchronization between browsers, servers and the database with the use of data sync engines."
