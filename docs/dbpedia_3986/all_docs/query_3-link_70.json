        "text": "For decades, Palestine has been facing a protracted and complex protection and humanitarian crisis. The crisis is tied to prolonged occupation, internal political divisions, and recurrent conflict that pose a threat to stability and development of the Palestinian people.\n\nHumanitarian conditions in Gaza are critical following a sharp upsurge in violence in the region in early October 2023., with 96 percent of the population facing acute food insecurity. Food and water are running out, shelters for displaced people are massively overcrowded and, without fuel, there is no electricity. Health services are collapsing. In the West Bank also, conditions are deteriorating, and food is running short.\n\nPrior to this phase of conflict, the collapse of all productive sectors, basic social services and infrastructures in Gaza was alarming.\n\nThe continuous large-scale security, political and economic unrest in the West Bank and the 15-year sea, land and air blockade on the Gaza Strip have resulted in economic stagnation, loss of land and restricted trade and access to resources, along with high unemployment and poverty rates. These circumstances continue to exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation and pose serious challenges to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 2 in regards to food security and improved nutrition.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP), through its dual mandate in humanitarian and development, provides life-saving food assistance to the most vulnerable and food insecure non-refugee Palestinians and works to safeguard livelihoods, build resilience, and reconstitute food systems in vulnerable areas. WFP also lends its technical expertise to support national institutions by strengthening their capacities in responding to shocks and building an inclusive social safety net.\n\nTo further strengthen the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, WFP is providing climate-smart agricultural assets such as hydroponics and wicking beds to households to increase their calorie intake and enable them to generate income. WFP also scaled up its resilience-building activities to include greenhouses, vegetable farms, sheep, poultry, and technical and vocational trainings for youth and people with disabilities. These projects reduce peopleâ€™s vulnerability to external shocks, serve as a safety net, and support livelihoods.\n\nIn parallel, WFP is running a social behaviour change campaign targeting school children and pregnant, lactating, and women with children under age five with awareness and cooking sessions, greenhouses, and community activities to improve nutritional health and combat food insecurity.\n\nWFP provides its robust systems to humanitarian and development partners, allowing them to reach more people faster, and at a lower cost to donors and the environment. By offering its cash-based transfer platform to the wider humanitarian and development community, coordinating logistics, and developing an inter-agency common feedback mechanism, WFP contributes to the wider efforts for humanitarian-development-peace nexus."
