        "text": "Attachments\n\nDownload Report (PDF | 4.17 MB | English version)\n\nDownload Report (PDF | 2.53 MB | Arabic version)\n\nDownload Report (PDF | 2.45 MB | Hebrew version)\n\nKey points\n\nIntense Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea continued across much of the Gaza Strip on 17 January, resulting in further civilian casualties and destruction. The indiscriminate firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups from Gaza continued. Ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups were also reported across much of Gaza. On 17 January, the UN Secretary-General repeated his call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nBetween the afternoons of 16 and 17 January, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza, 163 Palestinians were killed, and another 350 people were injured. Between 7 October 2023 and 12:00 on 17 January 2024, at least 24,448 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and 61,504 Palestinians were injured, according to the MoH.\n\nBetween 16 January and 17 January, three Israeli soldiers were reportedly killed in Gaza. Since the start of the ground operation, 191 soldiers have been killed, and 1,152 soldiers have been injured in Gaza, according to the Israeli military.\n\nAs of 17 January, telecommunication services in Gaza have remained shut down for the fifth consecutive day, since 12 January. In light of this, new information is limited in this Flash Update. This is the seventh time that communications have stopped working since 7 October. The blackout of telecommunications prevents people in Gaza from accessing lifesaving information or calling for first responders, and impedes other forms of humanitarian response.\n\nAs of 15 January, the Deir al Balah water pipeline, with a capacity of close to 17,000 cubic metres of per day, stopped functioning and is in urgent need of repairs. Water, hygiene, and sanitation (WASH) partners have estimated that repairs could take up to four weeks, even if sustained access and the necessary supplies are allowed. Only one of the three water pipelines from Israel into Gaza, located in the south, is currently functioning.\n\nBetween 16 and 17 January, the Khan Younis area was reportedly under heavy bombardment with intense fighting on the ground, with many casualties reported. Residential buildings, a cemetery (see Hostilities section for more information) and hospitals are among the civilian objects affected by the fighting.\n\nOn 16 January, at about 18:30, the vicinities of Al Amal Hospital in Khan Younis were struck, and serious damages were caused to the building, leading to panic among patients, medical teams, and internally displaced persons (IDPs). No casualties were reported. On 16 January, at about 22:20 and onwards, continuous artillery shelling struck the vicinity of An Nasser Medical Complex, with some munitions falling inside the compound and no casualties reported.\n\nOn 17 January, the Jordanian Army quoted in media stated that their field hospital in Khan Younis was heavily damaged and one of its staff members and one patient were injured, amid shelling by Israeli forces in the area. Israeli officials deny this claim and state that Palestinian were firing from within the compound.\n\nOn 17 January, 98 truckloads with food, medicine and other supplies entered the Gaza Strip through Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings. Since the opening of Kerem Shalom crossing, almost 22 per cent of aid trucks have come in through that entry point.\n\nOn 17 January, 11 Palestinians, including two children, were killed in two military operations in the Nablus and Tulkarm governorates, in the West Bank. Nine of the Palestinians, including two children, were killed in airstrikes and the other two people were killed with live ammunition. For more information, see the West Bank section.\n\nHostilities and casualties (Gaza Strip)\n\nThe communications shutdown has limited the full reporting of incidents. However, the following are among the deadliest incidents reported between 16 January and 17 January.\n\nOn 16 January, throughout the day, 23 Palestinians were reportedly killed as about 12 residential squares were struck in many locations in central, west, southeast, and east of Khan Younis.\n\nOn 16 January, at about 13:40, a woman and her daughter were reportedly killed when a group of Palestinians were struck west of Rafah.\n\nOn 16 January, in the afternoon, at least 20 bodies of killed Palestinians were reportedly recovered from under the rubble of a destroyed buildings in Al Maghazi and An Nuseirat camp areas.\n\nOn 16 January, at about 2:35, eight Palestinians, including two girls, were reportedly killed and dozens were injured when a house was struck and destroyed near Al Abrar Mosque, between Al Haboura camp and Yabna camp, in central Rafah.\n\nOn 16 January, at night, seven Palestinian were reportedly killed when a residential building was struck in An Nasmawi neighbourhood, adjacent to the Nasser Medical Complex, west of Khan Younis.\n\nOn 17 January, at about 7:00, the vicinity of Tariq bin Ziyad School, west of Khan Younis, was struck. Seven bodies of Palestinian were reportedly recovered after the attack.\n\nOn 17 January, at about 7:00, Israeli forces withdrew from the vicinity of Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis. Initial reports and video footage show that much of the Al Namsawi cemetery was destroyed and graves empty with some corpses reportedly missing.\n\nDisplacement (Gaza Strip)\n\nOn 17 January, UNRWA Commissioner-General, Philippe Lazzarini, stated: “In the south, around Rafah, makeshift structures of plastic sheeting have mushroomed everywhere, including on the streets, with people trying to protect themselves from the cold and rain. Each one of these flimsy shelters can be home to over 20 people. Rafah is so congested that one can barely drive a car amid the sea of people… In Deir al Balah, in the Middle Area… I heard stories of women foregoing food and water to avoid having to use the unsanitary toilets. Skin diseases and headlice are rife with those affected stigmatized. People were struggling for food and medicine during the day, feeling cold and damp during the night… There is very little information about the north of the Gaza Strip, as access to the area remains highly restricted.”\n\nAs of 11 January, according to UNRWA, 1.9 million people, or nearly 85 per cent of Gaza’s population, were estimated to be internally displaced, including many who have been displaced multiple times, as families are forced to move repeatedly in search of safety. Nearly 1.4 million IDPs are sheltering in 154 UNRWA facilities across all five governorates, including 160,000 in the north and Gaza city; facilities far are exceeding their intended capacity. A total of 1.78 million IDPs are receiving assistance from UNRWA. Rafah governorate is the main refuge for those displaced, with over one million people squeezed into an extremely overcrowded space, following the intensification of hostilities in Khan Younis and Deir al Balah and the Israeli military’s evacuation orders. Obtaining an accurate figure of the total number of IDPs remains challenging.\n\nElectricity\n\nSince 11 October 2023, the Gaza Strip has been under an electricity blackout, after the Israeli authorities cut off the electricity supply, and fuel reserves for Gaza’s sole power plant were depleted. The communications and industrial fuel shutdown continue to significantly hinder the aid community’s efforts to assess the full extent of needs in Gaza and to adequately respond to the deepening humanitarian crisis. For more information on electricity supply to the Gaza Strip, please see this dashboard\n\nHumanitarian Access (Gaza Strip-Northern Gaza)\n\nIn the first two weeks of January, humanitarian agencies planned 29 missions to deliver lifesaving supplies to areas to the north of Wadi Gaza. Only 7 of the 29 (24 per cent) were accomplished, either fully or partially. The remainder of the missions were denied access by the Israeli authorities. Two additional missions, originally coordinated with the Israeli authorities, could not be completed due to the non-viability of allocated routes or excessive delays at checkpoints, which did not allow the missions to succeed during the safe operating windows.\n\nThe denials of humanitarian missions’ access to areas north of Wadi Gaza over the first half of January spiked compared with the previous months; in October and December, only 14 per cent (6 out of 43) of missions planned to the north were denied, while the remaining 86 per cent (37 out of 43 missions) were facilitated. These denials prevent a scale-up in humanitarian assistance and add significant cost to the overall response. Additionally, planned missions that are denied access to areas north of Wadi Gaza represent opportunities missed for alternative missions that could be undertaken to other areas of the Gaza Strip. The capacity of humanitarian agencies to operate safely and effectively also remains heavily compromised by the long-term restrictions applied by the Israeli authorities on the import of critical humanitarian equipment into Gaza.\n\nHealth care, including attacks (Gaza Strip)\n\nInitial reports on 17 January indicate that a missile reportedly struck the UNRWA health clinic in Ad Daraj, in Gaza city. Further details on the impact of the projectile are yet to be established.\n\nAccording to WHO, only 15 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are functional, albeit partially: nine in the south and six in the north. In Deir al Balah and Khan Younis, three hospitals – Al Aqsa, Nasser, and Gaza European – are at risk of closure due to the issuance of evacuation orders in adjacent areas and the ongoing conduct of hostilities nearby. Hospitals in the north have been offering limited maternity, trauma, and emergency care services. However, they face challenges such as a shortage of medical staff, including specialized surgeons, neurosurgeons, and intensive care staff, as well as a lack of medical supplies, and have an urgent need for fuel, food, and drinking water. The nine partially functional hospitals in the south are operating at three times their capacity, while facing critical shortages of basic supplies and fuel. According to the MoH in Gaza, occupancy rates are reaching 206 per cent in inpatient departments and 250 per cent in intensive care units.\n\nOn 17 January, WHO Health Emergency Officer, Sean Casey, said: “We are working on mobilizing additional field hospitals, additional healthcare workers to backfill some of the people who have been displaced, the health workers who themselves are fearing for their lives and to meet the significantly increased burden of care that is created by injuries related to the hostilities and to the atrocious living conditions that people are under now. To summarize what I’ve seen: a rapid deterioration of the health system alongside a rapidly increasing level of humanitarian need and diminishing level of humanitarian access, particularly the areas north of Rafah. Every movement presents risks and logistical challenges.”\n\nHostilities and casualties (Israel)\n\nOver 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, including 36 children, according to the Israeli authorities, the vast majority on 7 October.\n\nAs of noon on 15 January, the Israeli authorities estimated that about 136 Israelis and foreign nationals remained captive in Gaza. During the humanitarian pause (24-30 November), 86 Israeli and 24 foreign national hostages were released.\n\nOn 15 January, the Secretary-General reiterated his call for the release of all hostages: “I once again demand the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. In the interim, they must be treated humanely and allowed to receive visits and assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross. The accounts of sexual violence committed by Hamas and others on October 7th must be rigorously investigated and prosecuted. Nothing can justify the deliberate killing, injuring, and kidnapping of civilians – or the launching of rockets towards civilian targets.”\n\nViolence and casualties (West Bank)\n\nOn 17 January, Israeli forces killed six Palestinians, including two children, in an airstrike that they carried out while operating in Tulkarm Refugee Camp. In the early morning, Israeli forces raided the camp, where clashes erupted between Israeli forces and Palestinians, including an exchange of gunfire and the use of explosive devices by the latter was reported. Subsequently, an Israeli airstrike targeted a group of Palestinians, killing four, including two children. During the operation, seven Palestinians, including two PCRS paramedics, and one Israeli soldier had been injured. An ambulance was severely damaged by shrapnel and two Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) paramedics were detained by Israeli forces. Israeli forces bulldozed several roads inside and the camp, surrounded the hospitals in Tulkarm city and obstructed the movement of medical crews. During the raid, Israeli forces opened fire at a vehicle, killing one Palestinian and injuring another. An additional Palestinian was shot with live ammunition and was later pronounced dead.\n\nOn 17 January, Israeli forces killed five Palestinian in an airstrike on a vehicle near the entrance of Balata Refugee Camp, Nablus city. Four of the bodies are being withheld by Israeli forces. The fifth body was incinerated by the airstrike. Israeli forces reportedly prevented PRCS ambulances from accessing the location and opened fire at them. According to the Israeli authorities, a vehicle that carried Palestinians accused of conducting attacks against Israelis was targeted. Two hours before the airstrike, Israeli forces conducted an operation in Balata Refugee Camp, in which they raided a number of Palestinian homes. Clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians also erupted during the operation, including the throwing of pipe bombs by the latter.\n\nSince 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024, 355 Palestinians have been killed, including 90 children, across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Additionally, two Palestinians from the West Bank were killed while carrying out an attack in Israel on 30 November. Of the fatalities in the West Bank (355), 346 were killed by Israeli forces, eight by Israeli settlers and one by either Israeli forces or settlers. So far in 2024 (as of 17 January), 46 Palestinians, including nine children, have been killed. The number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in 2023 (507) marks the highest number of Palestinians killed in the West Bank since OCHA started recording casualties in 2005.\n\nSince 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024, five Israelis, including four members of Israeli forces, have been killed in Palestinian attacks in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Four Israelis were killed in an attack carried out by Palestinians from the West Bank in West Jerusalem (one of the four was killed by Israeli forces who misidentified him) on 30 November 2023. Another Israeli woman was killed in another attack perpetrated by Palestinians in Israel on 15 January 2024. The number of Israelis killed in the West Bank and Israel in 2023 in attacks perpetrated by Palestinians from the West Bank (36) was the highest since OCHA started recording casualties in 2005.\n\nSince 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024, 4,234 Palestinians, including 643 children, have been injured in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Of them, 4,104 have been injured by Israeli forces, 109 by settlers and 21 by either Israeli forces or settlers. Of the total injuries, 53 per cent were reported in the context of search-and-arrest and other operations, 35 per cent in demonstrations and 8 per cent during settler attacks against Palestinians. Some 33 per cent of those injuries have been caused by live ammunition, compared with 9 per cent in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nSettler Violence\n\nSince 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024, OCHA recorded 431 Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians, resulting in Palestinian casualties (41 incidents), damage to Palestinian-owned property (337 incidents), or both casualties and damage to property (53 incidents). This reflects a daily average of four incidents since 7 October 2023 until 17 January 2024.\n\nOne-third of the settler attacks against Palestinians after 7 October 2023 have involved firearms, including shootings and threats of shootings. In nearly half of all recorded incidents after 7 October, Israeli forces were either accompanying or reported to be supporting the attackers.\n\nIn 2023, 1,229 incidents involving Israeli settlers in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (with or without Israeli forces), resulted in Palestinian casualties, property damage or both. Some 913 of these incidents resulted in damage, 163 resulted in casualties and 153 resulted in both. This is the highest number of settler attacks against Palestinians in any given year since OCHA started recording incidents involving settlers in 2006.\n\nDisplacement (West Bank)\n\nFrom 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024, at least 198 Palestinian households comprising 1,208 people, including 586 children, have been displaced amid settler violence and access restrictions. The displaced households are from at least 15 herding/Bedouin communities. More than half of the displacements occurred on 12, 15, and 28 October, affecting seven communities. The displacement toll since 7 October 2023, represents 78 per cent of all displacement reported due to settler violence and access restrictions since 1 January 2023 (1,539 people, including 756 children).\n\nFrom 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024, 460 Palestinians, including 227 children, have been displaced, following the demolition of their homes, due to lack of Israeli-issued building permits in Area C and East Jerusalem, which are almost impossible to obtain.\n\nA total of 19 homes have been demolished and 95 Palestinians, including 42 children, displaced due to punitive demolitions from 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024. The numbers exceed those reported in the first nine months of the same year, during which 16 homes were punitively demolished and 78 people displaced.\n\nFrom 7 October 2023 and as of 17 January 2024, 602 Palestinians, including 263 children, have been displaced, following the destruction of 94 homes during other operations carried out by Israeli forces across the West Bank. About 94 per cent of the displacement was reported in the refugee camps of Jenin, and in Nur Shams and Tulkarm, both in Tulkarm. This represents 65 per cent of all displacement reported due to the destruction of homes during Israeli military operations since January 2023 (908 people).\n\nFunding\n\nAs of 16 January, Member States have disbursed $689.8 million against the updated Flash Appeal launched by the UN and its partners to implement its response plan in support of 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 500,000 people in the West Bank. This constitutes 57 per cent of the $1.2 billion requested. Private donations are collected through the Humanitarian Fund.\n\nHUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND RESPONSES: 7-14 January\n\nHealth\n\nNeeds:\n\nAccording to WHO, only 15 of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functional - nine in the south and six in the north.\n\nAccording to the MoH in Gaza, there is a shortage of available hospital beds, as occupancy rates in these hospitals are reaching 206 per cent in inpatient departments and 250 per cent in intensive care units.\n\nFood, drinking water, fuel, medical supplies, and support to health workers through rotations and additional personnel, are urgently needed in healthcare facilities across Gaza.\n\nDuring missions to Shifa, Al Helou, Al Aqsa and Nasser hospitals to deliver supplies, fuel, and conduct assessments on 13 January, the WHO team observed the following:\n\nA drastic decrease in the number of health personnel in some of the hospitals.\n\nOnly 12 medical doctors are still working at the Al Aqsa hospital, which is about 10 per cent of the staff who operated before the start of the hostilities.\n\nThe maternity unit at Al-Aqsa Hospital is not operating and is referring all pregnant women to Al Awda Hospital, which is further away, putting patients at risks during the additional travel time, due to ongoing hostilities.\n\nPoor living conditions in shelters have resulted in a rise in water-borne diseases\n\nResponse:\n\nEleven Emergency Medical Teams (EMTs) are present in Gaza Strip and have been providing support to hospitals across the Strip.\n\nHealth and WASH partners are finalizing an inter-cluster outbreak preparedness and response plan; and are mapping out formal and informal shelters which are without access to primary healthcare services, to identify partners to cover the gaps.\n\nChallenges and Gaps:\n\nThe security situation, access, transport, and deconfliction remain extremely challenging, especially hospitals in the northern governorates.\n\nPartners’ operations continue to be adversely affected by the displacement of staff and also telecommunication challenges.\n\nThere is an urgent need to conduct assessments on the outbreak of communicable diseases, such Hepatitis A, to identify the most affected groups, hotspot locations and other key epidemiological information. This is essential to tailor a proper response plan to address identified cases and prevent the spread of disease.\n\nWASH\n\nNeeds:\n\nFlooding is being reported across different parts of the Gaza Strip due to winter weather, extensive infrastructure damage and destruction and the clogging of sewage systems and wastewater.\n\nRainwater lagoons have been contaminated by wastewater and several lagoons are at risk of flooding if the rainfall intensifies. This poses a serious environmental and public health concern.\n\nWHO reported an increase in Hepatitis A cases in the Middle Area and Rafah governorates, with the current water and sanitation conditions proving a high risk for further spread.\n\nTo manage water supply and waste-management alone, 22 generators have been requested. These items are pending entry into Gaza.\n\nOnly one of the three water pipelines from Israel is currently functioning. The Middle Area water pipeline, with a production capacity of close to 17,000 cubic metres of water per day, needs repairs. It is estimated that repairs would take up to four weeks, even given sustained access and necessary supplies.\n\nOnly two of the remaining three main low-capacity water desalination plants in Deir al Balah and southern Gaza are currently operational and are producing up to 2,400 cubic metres each day.\n\nResponse:\n\nDespite these challenges, WASH partners have undertaken the following responses since October 2023:\n\nSome 34,000 cubic metres of water have been delivered through water trucking and 2,400 metres through bottled water.\n\nMore than 53,000 jerrycans and more than 40 storage tanks have been distributed.\n\nNearly 145,000 hygiene kits and 1,800 cleaning kits have been distributed.\n\nChallenges and Gaps:\n\nHumanitarian partners have not been able to assess or resupply fuel to the Jabalya area, where sewage flooding was reported in the refugee camp on 5 January. At least 100,000 IDPs are estimated to reside in the UN and public shelters in this area.\n\nMarkets are not functioning and construction materials for latrines, desludging services and other essential supplies for sanitation are not available for purchase.\n\nImport restrictions, as well as complex and unpredictable clearance procedures for critical items considered by Israel as dual use, such as generators, pumps, and pipes are preventing a scale up of the WASH response.\n\nProtection\n\nNeeds:\n\nHundreds of detainees who have been released and returned to Gaza since December 2023, need support. Some were able to return to families while others moved to shelters.\n\nThere is a need for safe shelters for women at risk of gender-based violence (GBV).\n\nThere is still a high demand for women’s hygiene supplies across Gaza.\n\nResponse:\n\nProtection partners continue to support formerly detained Gazans released through Kerem Shalom Crossing. Partners provide a support package comprised of food, water, clothes, blankets, hygiene supplies as well as medical care and treatment. The long-term needs include advanced mental health and psychosocial support.\n\nThe GBV Sub cluster is coordinating the distribution of critical hygiene supplies for women and girls to the northern governorates, coordinating with relevant actors for distribution, procurement, and access.\n\nThe sub cluster will also review the composition of dignity kits based on changing needs and feedback from women.\n\nWomen Affairs Centre is preparing an assessment on the impact of current hostilities on women and girls, and the sub cluster will prepare for a wider scale assessment, including elements that can be used in any future intersectoral needs assessments.\n\nMine Action partners continue to conduct outreach and risk education in Rafah through in-person sessions.\n\nChallenges and Gaps:\n\nCommunication and network outages greatly curtailed the ongoing lifesaving Mine Action work, including outreach and mine risk education and conflict preparedness messages shared via SMS, radio, and social media. Partners continue to carry on outreach and risk education in Rafah through in-person sessions.\n\nShelter and Non-Food Items (NFI)\n\nNeeds:\n\nAs of 14th January, it is estimated that about 70,000 housing units across the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or rendered uninhabitable and over 290,000 housing units have been damaged, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza.\n\nIt is estimated that over 500,000 people will have no home to return to, and that many more will be unable to return immediately, due to the level of damage to surrounding infrastructure, as well as the risk posed by explosive remnant of war (ERW).\n\nResponse:\n\nDuring the reporting period, cluster partners distributed 1,000 tents and tarpaulin sheets in addition to 2,000 blankets.\n\nChallenges and Gaps:\n\nThere is a high shortage of all essential NFIs for IDPs inside and outside shelters. This includes 50,000 family winterized tents, 200,000 bedding sets (1,200,000 mattresses and blankets), 200,000 sealing-off kits, 200,000 winter clothes kits, and wooden timber to support IDPs in establishing self-built shelters.\n\nFood security\n\nNeeds:\n\nAccording to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC):\n\n2.2 million people are at imminent risk of famine.\n\n378,000 people at Phase 5 (catastrophic levels). Phase 5 refers to extreme lack of food, starvation, and exhaustion of coping capacities.\n\n939,000 people at Phase 4 (emergency levels).\n\nResponse:\n\nDuring the second week of January, 12 Food Security Sector (FSS) partners reached some 800,0000 people (considering possible duplication) with at least one type of food assistance. This does not imply sustained assistance nor the full package which people require to address their food insecurity needs. (This is a correction of a typographical error from what was reported in yesterday’s Flash Update (15 January), where it was stated that 1.8 million people were reached with one type of food assistance.)\n\nSome 13,000 people residing in UNRWA shelters and another 12,500 residing in public shelters were reached with hot meals, to alleviate the hunger and hardships faced by those displaced and in dire circumstances in the northern area.\n\nIn the south, FSS partners reached 290,000 IDPs in Rafah, Khan Younis, and the Middle areas through food parcels, bread supplies, ready-to-eat (RTE) packages and hot meals. Flour was additionally provided to some 270,000 households residing outside UNRWA shelters.\n\nChallenges and gaps:\n\nContinued hostilities, disruptions in healthcare services, lack of access to nutritious food, lack of access to clean water and poor sanitation conditions remain major challenges and contribute to the risk of famine in Gaza.\n\nDespite partners' efforts, food distribution in northern Gaza falls far below needs. The challenges faced in Gaza underscore the importance of continued coordination and support to address the pressing food security needs of the affected people.\n\nNutrition\n\nNeeds:\n\nGiven the current stock and funding situation, Nutrition partners can only meet 25 per cent of the nutritional needs of malnourished children and vulnerable mothers in the next two months. Without immediate funding and an expanded response, 375,000 individuals are at risk of severe undernourishment. Urgent action is crucial to prevent this life-threatening situation.\n\nResponse:\n\nUNICEF and other nutrition partners continued to address the nutritional needs of children and mothers through delivery of key nutrition commodities. Partners are providing therapeutic services and supplies for children with acute malnutrition, alongside preventative nutrition supplies, including High Energy Biscuits (HEBs). During the second week of January 2024, nutrition partners delivered the following:\n\nPartners distributed 5,978 Lipid Nutrient Supplement (LNS) boxes, 638 Survival food ration and 2,063 ready-to-eat (RTE) therapeutic food.\n\nOver 33,407 pregnant and nursing women and children under two received LNS supply for one month and sensitization materials in 24 UNRWA shelters in Rafah.\n\nFive nutrition staff were trained in Infant and Young Child Feeding in Emergencies\n\n(IYCF-E) and in Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) while 12 triage staff were trained in Mother-led mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) screening aiming for caregivers and health workers to screen for acute malnutrition in children.\n\nEducation\n\nNeeds:\n\nAccording to the Education Cluster, more than 625,000 students and close to 23,000 teachers in the Gaza Strip have been affected by attacks on education and school closures since 7 October 2023, and remain with no access to education or a safe place.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Education in Gaza, between 7 October 2023 and 2 January 2024, 4,119 students and 221 teachers were killed, while 7,536 students and 703 teachers injured across the Gaza Strip.\n\nSome 90 per cent of all school buildings in Gaza are being used as shelters for IDPs and have sustained varying levels of damage. Of these, 375 schools sustained damage including 12 that were fully destroyed. Combined, these schools previously served some 433,000 children and more than 16,200 teachers. The Khan Younis, North and Gaza governorates have the highest proportion (three quarters) of all damaged schools.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe Cluster’s response is guided by a three-phased response plan – supporting conflict-affected children, teachers, and caregivers in shelters and in host communities; preparing a safe learning environment and re-establishing a sense of normalcy as soon as hostilities stop; and preparing to restore the formal education system through the reconstruction of education infrastructure after a reduction in hostilities.\n\nSince October 2023, nine partners have reached close to 93,000 students and teachers with psychosocial support, emergency learning and recreational supplies and activities in the Khan Younis, Rafah, and Middle governorates. Most of the cluster responses are delivered by local partners.\n\nChallenges and Gaps:\n\nNo activities have been undertaken in the three northern governorates of Gaza, due to ongoing hostilities and access challenges.\n\nIn the first week of January, the education response remains significantly underfunded, receiving only three per cent of its requirements as articulated in the Flash Appeal. Education actors and donors are urged to mobilize rapid resources to meet immediate response requirements and start planning for reconstruction in the medium- to long- term when hostilities subside.\n\nMulti-purpose Cash Assistance (MCPA)\n\nSince the beginning of the hostilities, 118,200 households (about 787,233 people) have received emergency MPCA.\n\nAlthough cash assistance has been provided to affected people across the Gaza Strip, the vast majority of cash assistance activities are now concentrated in the southern governorates.\n\nBecause formal markets are largely depleted, informal markets are now the key sources of basics goods and services. This includes trading of personal belongings, small household-based production (bread, vegetables), humanitarian assistance, and other items.\n\nPost distribution monitoring data from recipients of cash assistance point to food, medicines, debt repayment, drinking water, and transportation as the top expenditures reported. The percentage of expenditures on food has further decreased over the past weeks, while the percentage of expenditures on medicines has doubled. Some 70 per cent of the respondents report that unrestricted cash has helped them access needed goods and services, either fully or partially, while 87 per cent preferred unrestricted cash for future assistance.\n\nLogistics\n\nOn 11 January, Logistics Cluster provided access to an additional warehouse in Rafah with a 400 square metre capacity, bringing the total space available for partners’ storage in Rafah to 1,470 square metres across three warehouses.\n\nTransport services are ongoing from the Rafah Transshipment Point to the Logistics Cluster warehouses in Rafah, as well as the cargo notification service to notify partners once their cargo arrives in Rafah.\n\nThe Logistics Cluster is engaging with partners in Amman, Jordan to initiate discussions on the Jordan Corridor. Advocacy efforts are ongoing with the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organisation (JHCO) and Jordanian and Israeli authorities to further streamline the current processes for the Jordan Corridor, to allow a larger number of convoys per week.\n\nThe IMPACCT Working Group published the updated bulletin on the process of transiting humanitarian aid items from Egypt to support the Gaza response. The live document provides the latest updates based on discussions with government entities and the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC).\n\nEmergency Telecommunications\n\nNeeds:\n\nRecurrent telecommunication shutdown in Gaza Strip. Telecommunication services in Gaza have been shut down since 12 January. This is the seventh time that communications have stopped working since 7 October.\n\nThere is an urgent need for critical telecommunications equipment into Gaza to set up services for the humanitarian response.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) and its partners continue to engage with the Israeli Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) for authorization to import telecommunications equipment and set up an independent, efficient, and reliable communications platform for humanitarian responders. On 11 January, the ETC submitted two letters with detailed specifications of the equipment to be imported into Gaza.\n\nThe ETC deployed an ICT Specialist to Gaza on 8 January for an initial technical engagement with local actors to plan an initial ICT needs assessment and to set up technical coordination processes for the response.\n\nSince 9 January, the ETC is conducting technical support to partner agencies in Rafah that include United Nations agencies and international NGOs to improve their telecommunications platforms.\n\nChallenges and Gaps:\n\nThe communications and fuel shutdown continues to significantly hinder efforts to assess the full extent of needs in Gaza and to adequately respond to the deepening humanitarian crisis.\n\nAttacks on telecommunication infrastructures and services providers remain a huge challenge to restore the telecommunication services in Gaza. On 13 January, a telecommunications company vehicle was reportedly struck in central Khan Younis, although the crew was on a repair mission and had secured security coordination. Two staff were reportedly killed.\n\nProtection against sexual abuse and exploitation (PSEA) remains a cross-cutting priority for all clusters. The SAWA helpline, reachable at 121 and through WhatsApp at +972 59-4040121 (East Jerusalem at 1-800-500-121), operates 24/7. This toll-free number is widely disseminated across all areas of intervention to report cases of SEA and to facilitate emergency counselling and referrals for affected communities to access life-saving services. The PSEA Network monitors calls daily and will increase the number of counsellors if necessary.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nUN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs\n\nTo learn more about OCHA's activities, please visit https://www.unocha.org/."
