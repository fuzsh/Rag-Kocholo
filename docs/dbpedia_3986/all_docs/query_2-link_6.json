        "text": "Lee alum Kyle Gazak will soon appear in the 20th Century Fox film, “Let’s Be Cops,” scheduled to be released in 2014.\n\n“Let’s Be Cops” is an action-comedy film directed by Luke Greenfield and co-written with Nicholas Thomas. The film stars Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans, Jr., as two friends who pretend to be police officers. Also co-starring are Andy García, Nina Dobrev, Rob Riggle, Keegan-Michael Key and James D’Arcy.\n\n“I am not just an extra or a random face in the background, but I actually interact with each of these actors in multiple scenes,” said Gazak.\n\nThough he cannot talk much about his character, Gazak did confirm he is “a bad guy,” and has been filming in the Atlanta area since May.\n\nOriginally from Charlotte, N.C., Gazak moved to Cleveland to attend Lee in 2007, and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in theatre in 2011.\n\nGazak submitted the necessary paperwork earlier this year to a casting agency for consideration as an extra, but was called just a few days later with “something bigger in mind.”\n\nWhile at Lee, Gazak starred in several Lee Theatre productions including “My Fair Lady,” “The Winter’s Tale,” “The Last Night of Ballyhoo” and “Almost, Maine.” He was also a part of the playwriting workshop Fringe Fest, the Lee University Film Festival, and many student short films. He was also a member of Alpha Phi Omega, the National Theatre Honor Society.\n\n“My time at Lee helped all the pieces come together,” continued Gazak. “I’ll even hear terms on set that other ‘newbies’ do not know, but I am familiar with because of my experience and courses at Lee.”\n\nThough he had been an extra in a commercial and a television show, along with a speaking role in a documentary airing later this year, Gazak said this is his first opportunity to work on a professional film.\n\n“It has been an amazing process,” shared Gazak. “So much hustle and bustle, people moving here and there, but it’s like controlled chaos… runs like a well-oiled machine. Being right in the middle and getting to be a part of it is humbling and amazing.”\n\nGazak’s professional goal is to have a career in film, television, and theatre. He is currently in the process of moving to Atlanta in order to make more connections and be ready for the next project.\n\n“Kyle was always passionate about theatre and film, and we were confident that he would fulfill that passion after graduation,” said Dr. Christine Williams, a theatre professor at Lee. “As a performer, he has always had the ability to connect with his audience in a unique way. We are excited to see how Kyle uses his calling in the entertainment world.”\n\nGazak added, “I’m also appreciative for the confidence I gained in regards to my size, all 6 feet 8 inches. Dr. Williams would always tell me to embrace my height and not cower from it as I tended to do. In ‘Let’s Be Cops,’ my size is actually an advantage.\n\nPhoto taken by Corey Pelton"
