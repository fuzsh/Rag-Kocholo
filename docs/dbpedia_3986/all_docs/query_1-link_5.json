        "text": "Til Gajak is what Lohris are made up of! The mixing of the sesame seeds with the jaggery with a hint of ghee makes this such an awesome dish!\n\nI remember growing up eating til gajak for every Lohri! The sesame seeds covered with jaggery and a little bit ghee seeping in made this dish a star of my childhood!\n\nIn fact, I have been in a very sad and nostalgic mood since morning… Irs been 9 years now but still every winter, my heart starts to ache for Delhi and every Lohri, this heart ache is at its peak… I have been thinking about those cold mornings and evenings and the very warming winter food. The Til Gajak!!!\n\nThough, now. one can easily get it in Bangalore,there is something about the ones from Delhi! Or may be its the heart and the the memories attached with it! So while I was in that mood today, N told me “Why don’t you make gajak.. Being in kitchen will also pep you up” (Yeah its become like a norm now, /mona is depressed make her cook/bake) ?I really liked the idea and started surfing for the recipe. I initially thought of making Varo which was the Indian Cooking Challenge couple of months back and I had missed it. But I also wanted to make something with Jaggery and not sugar. So the search continued and as usual, I picked up something from here, something from there and made my gajak and its absolutely yumm….In fact, N was not letting me take pictures at all as he wanted to eat them. I made a smaller quantity as I was making it for the first time but now I am regretting it…\n\nAnd now that I have made some gajak and eaten it too I feel better much better and I am planning on what to do in the evening!\n\nBefore jumping to the recipe, here are some more festival sweets recipes\n\nUbattu – Sankranti Special\n\nMoong Dal Ladoos – Diwali Special"
