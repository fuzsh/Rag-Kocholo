        "text": "Gajak is a dish made to commemorate Makar Sankranti. Roasted sesame seeds and cashews or groundnuts are folded in a ghee, sugar, and water mixture before being placed on a ghee-coated tray. After cooling, the sesame seed layer is broken into small pieces and served as a sweet dish. So, instead of sugar, we will make Gajak with honey.\n\nGajak 4 Serving Ingredients:\n\n● 2 cups roasted sesame seeds\n\n● 4 tbsp. honey\n\n● 2 tbsp. water\n\n● 1/4 cup halved cashews\n\n● 2 tbsp. ghee\n\nHow to Make Honey Gajak?\n\nStep 1:\n\nGrease a rectangular tray with ghee and set it aside for this simple Makar Sankranti recipe. Dry roast sesame seeds in a large heavy-bottomed kadhai over low heat until they turn brown. Set aside.\n\nStep 2:\n\nCook the ghee with two tablespoons of water over medium heat until it becomes thick and syrupy. Remove from the heat and add the roasted sesame seeds and cashew nuts. Transfer to the ghee-coated tray and level with a large flat spatula after mixing well with four tablespoons of honey.\n\nStep 3:\n\nMake cuts on it while it is still hot/warm. You can separate the pieces once it has cooled. Once completely cool, serve or store in an airtight container.\n\nNow that you know how to prepare Gajak with honey, it’s time to grab pure and organic honey from Lyfepure. Lyfepure is well-known in the market for its top-notch food quality products at an affordable cost.\n\nAnd this Makar Sankranti, enjoy your Gajak with Lyfepure honey……"
