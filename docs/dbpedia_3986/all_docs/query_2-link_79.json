Heat a frying pan on medium flame and add 2 tablespoons of ghee and 1 cup of jaggery. Cook over medium heat until the jaggery melts.\n\nStep 3.

Transfer to a greased surface.\n\nStep 4. Spread using a spatula. While it’s still warm, mark cuts using a greased knife and allow to cool completely.\n\nStep 5.
