        "text": "Israel has bulldozed large areas of Gaza — including beachfronts, farmland, forests and homes — to make fortified positions for military vehicles as they advance across the enclave.\n\nDespite Israel’s partial troop withdrawal from Gaza and a reduction in operations in the strip’s north, satellite imagery shows ongoing land clearing and military advancement in southern and central Gaza.\n\nThis pattern of clearing broad areas and building fortified positions has been repeated hundreds of times across the Gaza Strip, a New York Times analysis of commercial satellite imagery found.\n\nOften these fortified positions, shown on the map below, are occupied by Israeli forces for only a few days before they move deeper into the enclave. Wide areas surrounding the fortifications also suffered extensive damage, with farmland and roads often destroyed by the movement of heavy tracked vehicles.\n\nIsrael’s military capabilities far outmatch Hamas’s, with tanks, guided munitions and modern fighter jets, but fighting in a built-up area is still high risk. There are many locations where Hamas fighters can hide and ambush Israeli troops, including the extensive tunnel network below Gaza. Military experts say that Israeli forces build fortified positions in order to guard against the risk of infantry attacks and anti-tank weapons used by Hamas, especially at night, when fewer troops are on patrol.\n\n“Troops can move into buildings for security, but vehicles are outside. Thus, the Israelis build these berms for protection,” said Mark F. Cancian, a former White House weapons strategist who is now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nAs forces advance, they often build new fortifications each night. “The Israelis don’t want to pull their vehicles back every night and possibly lose territory,” Mr. Cancian said.\n\nA similar pattern can be seen around Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, which has been the main focus of Israel’s operations since early December.\n\n— Josh Holder and James Glanz\n\nThe United States and its allies carried out military strikes inside Yemen early Friday local time against targets linked to the Iranian-backed Houthi militia, indicating that violence in the region has escalated into a broader conflict in the Middle East.\n\nRadars, missiles and drone launch sites, and weapons storage areas were hit, according to a U.S. official.\n\nThe strikes were in response to more than two dozen attacks by Houthi militia on commercial ships in the Red Sea, including missile strikes, drone attacks and the hijacking of a cargo ship. The militia has said the attacks are in support of Palestinians under Israeli bombardment in Gaza, although not all of the targets had a clear connection to Israel.\n\nThe Houthis and their allies condemned the U.S.-led airstrikes in Yemen, vowing to retaliate. This comes after a string of attacks in the Middle East following the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 and Israel’s ensuing war in Gaza.\n\nThe military strikes came a day after the United Nations Security Council voted to condemn the Houthi attacks, which it said impeded global commerce.\n\nShipping companies operating in the region have been left with a difficult choice: either continue to use the Red Sea and face higher insurance premiums, or reroute ships around Africa and add 4,000 miles and 10 days to journeys.\n\n— Pablo Robles, Zach Levitt, Julie Walton Shaver and Josh Holder\n\nThe Israeli military advanced along a new front into central Gaza between Dec. 24 and Dec. 26, expanding its ground offensive as Israeli officials warn that war in Gaza could continue for “many more months” despite international calls for a cease-fire.\n\nA comparison of commercial satellite images taken two days apart shows clusters of armored vehicles massing on the outskirts of a densely built-up neighborhood, Al Bureij, in Deir al-Balah, about a mile from the border with Israel.\n\nThe military confirmed in a news briefing on Tuesday that it was expanding the fighting to an area it called “the central camps,” saying that it was targeting Hamas infrastructure in the area of Al Bureij and that it had discovered a tunnel shaft.\n\nUntil this week, the Israeli military had focused its ground forces on targeting what it said were Hamas operations in two primary areas: northern Gaza and Khan Younis, the largest city in the south. This latest advance opens a third major front in the military’s ground invasion.\n\nIsraeli armored vehicles have been visible across large swaths of the Gaza Strip since the ground invasion began in late October, according to commercial satellite images analyzed by The New York Times.\n\nIn the weeks since the ground invasion of Khan Younis at the beginning of December, ground fighting and airstrikes have intensified there. Israeli military vehicles in southern Gaza are most concentrated to the north and east of Khan Younis, which Israel says has become Hamas’s headquarters.\n\nSatellite imagery from this week reveals the devastation that has been wrought by the invasion in a large area northeast of the city. Demolished buildings and bulldozed farmland are visible, along with large craters scattering the landscape.\n\nThe most recent evacuation order in the central Gaza Strip comes after orders in northern Gaza and Khan Younis that have caused mass displacement into ever-shrinking pockets of southern Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans have been cornered in Rafah, where they are struggling without sanitation, food or water and where bombing is frequent.\n\n— Josh Holder, Zach Levitt and Elena Shao\n\nWhile Israel’s military has shifted focus toward Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, Israeli officials say they are still targeting Hamas strongholds in northern Gaza. Groups of Israeli armored vehicles can be seen in multiple areas of northern Gaza in commercial satellite imagery.\n\nThe imagery, which The Times obtained from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite company, is not comprehensive, but it is the clearest evidence yet that Israel is pursuing a two-pronged offensive aimed at targets in the north and south of Gaza simultaneously.\n\nIsraeli vehicles can be seen crossing the border into Gaza near Shajaiye, a neighborhood to the east of Gaza City, on Dec. 15.\n\nShajaiye has been the focus of fierce combat in the past week. Israel suffered one of its highest single-day casualty counts of the ground invasion when nine soldiers were killed there. The Israeli military has said its aim is to root out Hamas fighters in the area. It is also where Israeli troops mistakenly shot three hostages who had been held by Hamas since the group’s attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nThe imagery also shows Israeli tanks in at least two other areas where Israeli officials say there are still Hamas strongholds.\n\nTank tracks and fortifications can be seen to the north of Jabaliya, a dense neighborhood of apartment blocks that has been struck repeatedly by Israeli forces, including with at least two 2,000-pound bombs during one airstrike last month. On Dec. 15, about 40 armored vehicles could be seen in a clearing between residential buildings.\n\nThe largest clusters of tanks are in southern Gaza, to the north and northeast of Khan Younis, which the Israeli military now calls “Hamas’s military capital.”\n\nMore than 200,000 people lived in Khan Younis before the war and its population swelled as evacuation orders directed civilians to flee northern Gaza. Khan Younis has been frequently targeted by Israeli airstrikes since Oct. 7, despite its large civilian population, and satellite imagery shows that it is pockmarked with large craters.\n\nIsrael has ordered civilians to leave Khan Younis, telling them to move into ever-shrinking pockets of southern Gaza. Many have been displaced to Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost region, where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are now living in cramped, squalid conditions, with limited access to food, clean water and toilets.\n\n— Josh Holder and Leanne Abraham\n\nIsrael’s renewed offensive has reached the outskirts of Khan Younis, southern Gaza’s largest city, from which thousands of civilians are now trying to flee.\n\nSatellite imagery shows the clearest evidence so far of the extent of Israel’s ground offensive in southern Gaza, where armored vehicles can be seen moving toward Khan Younis from several directions. The Times obtained and analyzed the imagery, which was taken on Wednesday morning, from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite company.\n\nIsraeli tanks, vehicle tracks and defensive fortifications are visible in imagery taken on Sunday, showing that Israeli forces entered southern Gaza via the Kissufim crossing point sometime on Friday or Saturday. Israeli vehicles also crossed the border farther south, to the northeast of Khan Younis, according to a New York Times analysis of publicly available satellite imagery from Copernicus taken on Wednesday.\n\nThis sequence of images show how quickly the Israeli military has ramped up its operation around Khan Younis, where they believe Hamas leadership is sheltering after fleeing the northern part of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli commanders have described intense house-to-house combat with Hamas fighters in the densely populated city of Khan Younis. The city had more than 200,000 residents before the war, and has become more crowded in recent weeks as people fled the intense conflict in northern Gaza.\n\nThe military confrontations in Khan Younis are unfolding as humanitarian conditions have grown increasingly dire. Israel is ordering civilians — many who were already displaced from their homes in the north — to evacuate into ever-shrinking pockets of the coastal enclave and officials are struggling to get aid through. The United Nations has warned that shelters are far beyond capacity, forcing many people to sleep on the street or in empty lots.\n\nKhan Younis is also under heavy aerial bombardment. One neighborhood to the northeast of the city, shown below, has more than two dozen large craters and numerous destroyed buildings, mirroring the destruction in northern Gaza.\n\n— Josh Holder\n\nJust over half of the total area of the Gaza Strip was under Israeli evacuation orders as of Sunday. Israel expanded its demands for evacuation in the south, telling those staying in central and eastern Khan Younis to leave, ahead of an expected ground invasion in the area.\n\nThe Gaza Strip is home to more than two million people and is already among the most densely populated areas of the world.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people fled to Khan Younis, Gaza’s second-largest city, in the first stage of the war. The expanded orders follow earlier demands to evacuate the large area east of Khan Younis that borders Israel and encompasses the agricultural villages of Al Qarara, Bani Suheila, Abasan and Khuza’a, as well as the order Israel gave in the first week of the war to evacuate all of northern Gaza.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby and Leanne Abraham\n\nAn updated analysis of satellite imagery shows that in the month and a half since Israel’s war in Gaza started, about half of all buildings in the northern Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed. That proportion is up from roughly one-third of buildings estimated to have been damaged two weeks ago.\n\nThe destruction of buildings and other structures in northern Gaza has continued even as the Israeli military has established an increased presence there and continued its advance into Gaza City. Israeli forces have been steadily surrounding hospitals in northern Gaza, including Indonesian Hospital, which was struck early on Monday morning.\n\nIsrael says that Hamas, the armed group that rules Gaza and was responsible for the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, has concealed bases inside hospitals, and it has begun releasing videos that it says support its assertion. Hamas has denied Israeli accusations that it uses civilian infrastructure and says Israel is committing war crimes by targeting hospitals.\n\nMore than 12,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment of the strip began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThroughout the entire Gaza Strip, including southern Gaza, at least 56,000 buildings appear to be damaged, or an estimated 20 to 26 percent of all buildings, according to the analysis by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center. The assessment identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery collected on Nov. 18.\n\nAccording to the analysis, at least 13,200 structures have also been damaged in southern Gaza, below the evacuation line that Israel established on Oct. 13 when it ordered all northern Gazans to relocate to the south. In recent days, some residents in and around Khan Younis in southern Gaza have also reported seeing evacuation orders, in the form of fliers addressed to residents of agricultural villages east of the city. Some areas in those villages, including Khuza’a and Bani Suheila, have sustained significant damage.\n\n— Leanne Abraham\n\nIn Khan Younis — the largest city in southern Gaza — some residents reported seeing fliers said to have been dropped by Israeli planes warning people in outlying villages to evacuate.\n\nThe fliers, images of which have circulated online for days, were addressed to residents of four agricultural villages north and east of the city, near the border with Israel: Al Qarara, Bani Suheila, Abasan and Khuza’a. The four villages make up a large geographic area in southern Gaza.\n\nThe villages are east of Salah al-Din Road, the main north-south artery, which people have been using to flee from the north. The origin of the images was not clear and the Israeli military declined to comment on them.\n\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said early Saturday that there had been “intense strikes” by the Israelis in the south as well as “ground clashes” between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups. The agency said that clashes took place in Khan Younis and near Rafah in southern Gaza, as well as in the north during the previous 24 hours.\n\n— Karen Zraick, Lauren Leatherby and Leanne Abraham\n\nIsrael’s military and Hezbollah, an armed militant group and ally of Hamas operating in Lebanon, have continued to clash along Israel’s volatile northern border.\n\nThe escalating violence has stoked fears that Israel’s war in Gaza, which began after Hamas led sweeping attacks on Israelis on Oct. 7, could widen to another front and potentially draw in Iran, which supports both Hamas and Hezbollah. However, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, told the political leader of Hamas in early November that Iran would not enter the war on Hamas’s behalf, according to Reuters.\n\nHezbollah’s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech last week that the group would keep up pressure on Israeli forces and try to strike targets deeper into Israeli territory, but he stopped short of a war declaration.\n\nMr. Nasrallah previously described Hezbollah’s objective as exchanging fire with a portion of Israel’s military to keep it occupied along multiple fronts, reducing the burden on Hamas.\n\nThe border skirmishes have, for the most part, involved Israeli troops and Hezbollah militia members. A few civilians have been killed on either side of the border since Oct. 7, according to reports from Israel’s military and Lebanon’s state news agency, and thousands more have fled their homes in border-area villages.\n\n— Elena Shao\n\nIsraeli forces have continued to advance deep into Gaza City, fighting street battles with Hamas and surrounding battered hospitals, where conditions are increasingly dire. Tracks of Israeli military vehicles, indicating the broad outlines of the advance on the city from the north and the south, are visible in commercially available satellite imagery taken on Nov. 11.\n\nHundreds of patients and thousands of displaced people have been trapped in Al-Shifa Hospital, the Gaza Strip’s largest, as Israeli tanks and troops battle Hamas fighters nearby. The World Health Organization said on Sunday that the hospital was no longer functioning, as three days “without electricity, without water and with very poor internet” had severely hurt its ability to provide care.\n\nIsraeli officials say that Hamas uses hospitals in Gaza as shields for its fighters, and that the Israeli military is targeting an underground Hamas command center beneath the Al-Shifa complex. Hamas and hospital officials have denied the existence of such a command center.\n\nIsraeli forces have reached at least three other hospitals in northern Gaza, including Al-Rantisi and Al-Nasr, which have been evacuated, and Al-Quds, which is no longer operational. Fighting near Al-Quds on Monday disrupted efforts to evacuate patients and made it difficult for medical staff to make it in and out.\n\n— Leanne Abraham, Josh Holder and Elena Shao\n\nViolence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has escalated to nearly four times its level before the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7, leading to more than 175 deaths, almost all of them Palestinian.\n\nClashes between Palestinians and Israeli settlers and soldiers have been a longstanding issue. But the war between Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, has further stoked tensions in the West Bank. The territory is much bigger than Gaza and a more complex Palestinian-majority area, where a growing number of Israeli settlements have also taken root.\n\nMany of the confrontations have broken out either between Palestinian civilians and Israeli soldiers, often after an Israeli-led arrest or raid, or they have broken out after attacks and physical intimidation by Israeli settlers.\n\nClashes between Palestinian militants and Israeli troops have also escalated, fanning fears that war could break out on a second front.\n\nThe confrontations have also become increasingly deadly. A large proportion of the civilian deaths occurred after demonstrations or protests turned violent. These included many instances in which Palestinians threw stones at Israeli forces, who then responded with tear gas, rubber-coated bullets, stun grenades or live ammunition, or a combination of those. A number of deaths also occurred during direct attacks in which Israeli soldiers opened fire on Palestinians.\n\nThe data does not include episodes of violence that have occurred since Nov. 3, including Israeli military raids in the city of Jenin on Thursday, where 14 Palestinians were killed, according to Palestinian officials.\n\nThe data was compiled by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a crisis monitoring organization, which collected information about political violence in the West Bank by examining reports from governments, social media, and local and national news services.\n\nThe map above does not include cases of looting, land seizure or property destruction in which physical violence was not reported. But these sorts of episodes have also increased in frequency since Oct. 7, often targeting herders and Bedouin communities and destroying homes or sources of livelihood, like olive tree groves.\n\nMore than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, including entire herding communities, have been forcibly displaced from their homes since Oct. 7, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, which has also been tracking the conflict.\n\n— Elena Shao and Bora Erden\n\nIsraeli strikes have continued to batter the Gaza Strip since Israel’s ground invasion began 13 days ago. As the Israeli military has encircled Gaza City and reached deep into the city, air and ground strikes have hit locations throughout the enclave where thousands of displaced people are known to be sheltering, including hospitals and schools.\n\nAt least two strikes since the invasion have hit Al Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical complex, where the United Nations has said 60,000 people are sheltering. On Nov. 3, Israel struck near the hospital’s entrance, killing 15 people, according to Gaza’s health ministry and the Palestine Red Crescent Society. Israel has said that Hamas has a command center under the hospital and that the strike targeted an ambulance being used by a terrorist cell.\n\nOn Monday, a strike on the top floor at the same hospital killed one child, said Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the head of the hospital. Israel denied responsibility for the Monday attack.\n\nGaza’s health ministry said a strike on Saturday killed 15 people at Al Fakhura school, where 16,000 people were sheltering. Other strikes in the past 13 days have hit a medical complex that contains Al Rantisi Hospital and Al Nasr Children’s Hospital, which has been sheltering about 16,000 displaced people, as well as Al Quds Hospital, which has been sheltering 14,000.\n\nReports from Wafa, the state-run news agency of the Palestinian Authority, have additionally mentioned strikes on or in the vicinity of at least three other hospitals and five other schools in the past 13 days.\n\nMany strikes since the invasion have also hit densely populated, developed neighborhoods in Gaza that are designated as refugee camps, which are home to Palestinians and their descendants who fled or were expelled from their homes in the 1940s war that surrounded the creation of Israel.\n\nIt is unclear how many people remain in each of Gaza’s refugee camp neighborhoods, particularly in the north, since tens of thousands of residents followed Israel’s orders to evacuate to southern Gaza. What is certain is that many others have been unable to flee safely, and strikes in both the north and the south have resulted in numerous casualties.\n\nStrikes on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1 on Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip killed at least 195 people and injured hundreds more, according to Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office, and left a 40-foot-wide crater. The Israeli military said that the strike had targeted Hamas militants, including a central figure in the Hamas-led attacks in Israel on Oct. 7. Reports from Wafa have also mentioned attacks on the Jabaliya neighborhood on several other days, some with dozens of fatalities. The casualty counts could not immediately be independently confirmed.\n\nRefugee camp neighborhoods in the south, below the evacuation boundary established by Israel, have also been struck, including multiple times in Nuseirat, Bureij and Maghazi. A strike on Maghazi over the weekend killed at least 47 people, Gaza’s health ministry said, with the death toll expected to rise. A spokesperson for the Israeli military said it was looking into reports of the strike.\n\nOverall in Gaza, about 1.5 million people are internally displaced, according to a United Nations estimate.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby and Leanne Abraham\n\nThe vast devastation from Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip continues to worsen. Roughly a third of all buildings in northern Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, an analysis of satellite imagery found — with thousands of buildings showing evidence of new damage just last week.\n\nThe Israeli military has continued to pummel the Gaza Strip, and particularly northern Gaza, with strikes even as ground troops have moved toward Gaza City over the past week and a half. Israel said on Monday that it had struck about 450 targets in Gaza in the previous 24 hours. Israel has encircled Gaza City, effectively cutting northern Gaza off from the south.\n\nMore than 10,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel’s bombardment of the strip began a month ago, according to the Gaza Health Ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.\n\nThroughout the entire Gaza Strip, including southern Gaza, at least 38,000 buildings appear to be damaged, or an estimated 13 to 18 percent of all buildings, according to the analysis by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center. The assessment identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery ending on Sunday.\n\nThe Israeli military on Monday reiterated its demand that residents of northern Gaza move south, and an evacuation corridor was reopened for four hours. United Nations monitors reported about 5,000 people left the north during that window, while others were unable to make the journey. Because of heavy damage to roads, the only option was to flee on foot, according to a report from the United Nations’ humanitarian and emergency relief office.\n\nThe damage assessment shows that Israeli forces have continued to strike in southern Gaza, below the evacuation line, though damage there is less concentrated than in the north.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News that aired Monday night, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated that he expected Israel to have an “overall security responsibility” over Gaza for an “indefinite period” once the fighting there is over, though he did not say who he thought should govern the enclave if Hamas is eliminated.\n\n— Leanne Abraham and Tim Wallace\n\nIntense clashes have escalated for weeks along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, stoking fears of a war between Israel and Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militia and political party that is an ally of Hamas.\n\nOn Friday, in his first remarks since the start of Israel’s war with Hamas, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, described the group’s objective as a controlled battle along the border rather than an all-out war. But he also promised an eye for an eye on civilian deaths, raising concerns that the militia’s attacks would expand beyond military targets.\n\nLebanon’s state news agency said Sunday that four civilians, three of them children, who were traveling in a car in southern Lebanon were killed by an Israeli strike.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have clashed repeatedly since Oct. 7, the date of Hamas’s surprise attack on Israel. Mr. Nasrallah said that Hezbollah’s aim was to keep Israeli forces tied up along the northern border with Lebanon, reducing the burden on Hamas.\n\nDuring the immediate aftermath of the Hamas attack, Israel ordered evacuations of more than 150,000 residents living in villages near the border.\n\n— Malika Khurana, Zach Levitt, Elena Shao, Christine Zhang, Molly Cook Escobar and Euan Ward\n\nIsraeli ground forces have reached across the full width of the Gaza Strip, satellite imagery shows, encircling Gaza’s largest city and cutting off the roads running south.\n\nThe imagery, taken on Friday morning by Planet Labs, a commercial satellite provider, shows how far Israel has moved into Gaza and the scale of its southern line of attack, where at least five groups of armored vehicles are visible south of Gaza City.\n\nAnd the imagery confirms statements from Israel’s military on Thursday night that it had surrounded Gaza City from several directions. Armored vehicles can be seen just 300 meters from Al-Rasheed Street, a coastal road that is one of the two main north-south routes in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIt is unclear how deep Israeli forces have entered into Gaza City itself. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on social media on Thursday that Israeli forces were already “beyond the outskirts” of the city.\n\nIsrael’s recent advances have surrounded Gaza City above ground, but Hamas also relies on a network of tunnels, thought to be hundreds of miles long, to move around the enclave. Israel is targeting the tunnels with airstrikes, but it is hard to know what damage it has caused to the network so far.\n\nThe imagery also shows entire dense neighborhoods in northern Gaza that look mostly leveled, reflecting the extraordinary level of devastation from Israeli bombardment over the past several weeks. At least a quarter of all buildings in northern Gaza appear damaged or destroyed as of Sunday, an analysis of satellite imagery found.\n\nIn the small neighborhood of Izbat Beit Hanoun, shown below, dozens of craters are visible, and many buildings are completely destroyed.\n\n— Josh Holder and Bora Erden\n\nSatellite imagery taken on Wednesday indicates that Israeli ground troops are continuing to close in on Gaza City.\n\nHeavy-vehicle tracks extend deep into the Gaza Strip along three fronts, the satellite image shows: three miles past Gaza’s northern border along the coast, 1.5 miles past the border in the northeast and along a westward stretch south of Gaza City, nearly reaching the coast.\n\nIsraeli soldiers have been encroaching from the north, east and northeast in an effort to cut the northern part of the enclave off from the south. Earlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said that it had “completed the encirclement of Gaza City” and had advanced beyond the city’s outskirts.\n\nThe military wing of Hamas, Al Qassam Brigades, did not confirm the claim, but said Thursday on Telegram that it had fired on Israeli forces near the Shati area along the coast and near Juhor ad Dik, close to Gaza’s eastern border.\n\nIn the six days since Israel began its ground invasion, the Israeli military has continued its intensive aerial bombardment of northern Gaza. Several airstrikes earlier this week, which Israel said had targeted Hamas operatives, hit the densely populated Jabaliya neighborhood, leveling whole blocks.\n\n— Bora Erden, Zach Levitt, Elena Shao, Tim Wallace and Aaron Boxerman\n\nTens of thousands of buildings in Gaza, including at least a quarter of all buildings in northern Gaza, appear damaged or destroyed, according to an analysis of satellite imagery. The assessment offers a newly detailed picture of the widespread devastation caused by the Israeli bombardment of Gaza in the past several weeks.\n\nWhile only an estimate, the spatial analysis indicates the enormous destructiveness of Israel’s bombing campaign, which has become one of the most intense of the 21st century. Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 8,000 people, according to Gazan health officials.\n\nBetween 38,200 and 44,500 buildings throughout the Gaza Strip are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed since the beginning of the war, according to the analysis, by two researchers, Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University and Corey Scher of the CUNY Graduate Center.\n\nThe analysis includes damage from the beginning of the war until Sunday, before a strike hit a densely populated residential area in Jabaliya on Tuesday.\n\nWide swaths of Gaza City and the surrounding area have been damaged, with the greatest damage concentrated north of the city, according to the assessment, which identified individual building footprints that were most likely damaged based on an analysis of satellite imagery. Throughout Gaza, about 14 percent of buildings appear to be damaged or destroyed.\n\nSince Oct. 25, the Israeli military’s aerial bombardment has damaged many homes and residential buildings, as well as commercial buildings, in northern Gaza. Israeli strikes also hit near Al Quds Hospital in Gaza City, where thousands were seeking refuge.\n\nThe analysis shows that Israel has continued to strike southern Gaza even as it has renewed warnings for civilians to move there from the north.\n\nAirstrikes in southern Gaza since Oct. 25 have damaged many residences, a bakery and a mosque.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel categorically dismissed any possibility of a cease-fire in Gaza at a news conference late Monday, as Israeli troops pushed deeper into the territory and appeared to advance on densely populated Gaza City from three directions.\n\n— Scott Reinhard, Bora Erden, Lauren Leatherby and Elena Shao\n\nIsrael’s military appears to be approaching Gaza City from at least three sides. Photos, videos and satellite imagery show lines of armored vehicles advancing from Gaza’s northern border and taking up positions near a major road farther south.\n\nIsrael has provided limited details about the invasion, four days into what an Israeli official described as an “extended ground operation.” But imagery verified by The Times indicates large groups of tanks and other armored vehicles making their way deep into Gaza, as Israel’s military has continued to strike nearby buildings from the air.\n\nIn northwest Gaza, a satellite image taken on Monday morning by Planet Labs shows large groups of armored vehicles advancing about three miles south of the northern border near the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Groups of vehicles can be seen amassed in open spaces of the densely populated area of Al Karama, north of Gaza City, less than two miles north of the crowded Shati refugee camp. Many nearby buildings appear to have been heavily damaged or completely destroyed by airstrikes.\n\nPhotographs also show a second group of armored vehicles near the city of Beit Hanoun, on the northeast edge of the Gaza Strip. Beit Hanoun had already been significantly damaged by airstrikes in the past several weeks.\n\nFarther south, a video taken by Palestinian media worker Youssef Al Saifi on Monday morning, and verified by The Times, showed an Israeli armored vehicle firing on and destroying a car along Salah al-Din, Gaza’s main north-south road. The car was carrying a family, Mr. Al Saifi said. Satellite imagery from around the same time showed groups of Israeli armored vehicles positioned near the road.\n\nPalestinian health officials say more than 8,000 people have been killed in Gaza, many of them children, since Israel began launching retaliatory airstrikes in response to a Hamas attack on Oct. 7.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby, Christoph Koettl, Agnes Chang, Josh Holder and Weiyi Cai\n\nEvidence of new vehicle tracks could be seen in satellite imagery, as Israeli troops crossed the border into northern Gaza over the last few days.\n\nA screenshot from a video released by Israel’s military on Saturday shows bulldozers creating a path for tanks entering northern Gaza.\n\nInformation about Israel’s ground operations has been limited, with internet and phone service just returning to parts of the strip on Sunday after a near-total blackout.\n\n— Weiyi Cai, Lauren Leatherby, Christoph Koettl, Elena Shao and Amy Schoenfeld Walker\n\nFew details have emerged of the Israeli military advance into Gaza, where internet connections and phone lines have been almost entirely cut off. But videos released by Israel’s military and geolocated by The Times indicate at least three separate places where Israeli troops have crossed the border into northern Gaza over the past few days.\n\nIsraeli military officials said on Saturday that troops remained in northern Gaza on Saturday evening after advancing into it on Friday. This marked a departure from the military’s earlier releases, which had indicated that troops had exited the areas depicted in the videos after conducting strikes.\n\nWhile basic details of the operation remain shrouded in secrecy, video footage released by Israel’s military on Saturday showed lines of tanks operating on the Gaza side of the northern border, along with clouds of smoke rising from significant explosions.\n\nFarther south, a line of tanks can be seen in footage released by Israel on Friday traveling west toward the village of Juhor ad Dik, southeast of Gaza City.\n\nBuildings, including what appear to be houses and apartment buildings, are seen being bombarded in an area about one mile long in Juhor ad Dik. The village is just north of the evacuation line that Israel established on Oct. 13 when it ordered all northern Gazans to relocate to the south.\n\nThe ground advance on Friday was accompanied by a particularly intense round of Israeli bombardment in northern Gaza, as well as a widespread communication blackout that has made it difficult to assess the extent of the military action. So far, the maneuver appears more limited than some experts had predicted.\n\nHamas’s armed wing confirmed on Friday night and Saturday afternoon that its forces were fighting with Israeli soldiers inside Gaza.\n\n— Lazaro Gamio, Bora Erden, Scott Reinhard, Pablo Robles, Patrick Kingsley and Ronen Bergman\n\nAn analysis of satellite imagery shows the tremendous structural damage that northern Gaza has sustained since Oct. 17, adding to already significant damage from the preceding 11 days. The Israeli military said Wednesday that it had struck more than 7,000 targets inside Gaza.\n\nPhotographs taken in Gaza show the enormous range of buildings damaged by strikes in the past week, which include bakeries, a supermarket, a restaurant and many houses and residential buildings. The 19-day bombing campaign has become one of the most intense of the 21st century.\n\nThe area around Gaza City has been hit particularly hard. On the morning of Oct. 23, smoke blanketed much of that region. A soft drink manufacturing facility in an eastern area of the city, its roof covered with solar panels, was burning.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Israel has ramped up airstrikes in southern Gaza even after demanding the relocation of hundreds of thousands of residents of northern Gaza to the south. The increase in strikes in the south also coincides with the arrival of aid convoys through the Rafah crossing on the border with Egypt. These maps do not capture strikes that did not result in damage to manmade structures.\n\n— Zach Levitt, Leanne Abraham, Eleanor Lutz and Tim Wallace\n\nMore Palestinians have been killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank in the past few weeks than in any similar period in at least the past 15 years, according to Palestinian health authorities and historical data from the United Nations.\n\nIsraeli forces and settlers have killed 95 Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, health officials said, a surge in violence in what was already a particularly deadly year in the West Bank. One Israeli soldier was also killed in clashes.\n\nMost of the Palestinian deaths in the West Bank have been in clashes with Israeli forces, while others were the result of settler attacks.\n\nMasked settlers shot and killed three Palestinians in the village of Qusra on Oct. 11, according to Palestinian health officials. At a funeral procession for the victims the next day, settlers attacked again, killing two more Palestinians, a father and son.\n\nThe Israeli military carried out a rare airstrike in the West Bank on a mosque in Jenin on Saturday night, killing two. Israel’s military said it was targeting a “terror compound” beneath the mosque that it said was being used to organize an attack.\n\nA raid by Israeli forces on the Nur Shams refugee camp on Thursday ended in the deaths of 13 Palestinians, including five children, as well as an Israeli soldier. The soldier was the first Israeli to have died in the West Bank since Oct. 7, according to U.N. data.\n\n“We are extremely alarmed by the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation in the occupied West Bank and the increase in unlawful use of lethal force,” said Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby and Josh Holder\n\nAs Israeli forces prepare for a possible ground invasion of Gaza, frequent clashes along Israel’s northern border have amplified fears of a broader conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia backed by Iran.\n\nIsraeli authorities said on Sunday that they planned to evacuate 14 additional villages near the Lebanese border. The announcement was an expansion of an earlier evacuation order for communities in the area amid intensifying skirmishes between Hezbollah and Israeli troops.\n\nHezbollah has increased its attacks aimed at northern Israel in recent days, and Israel has retaliated in southern Lebanon. But it is not possible to attribute all of the reported clashes individually to one side or the other.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Sunday that he did not know whether Hezbollah would join the conflict, but said it would result in “devastating consequences to Hezbollah and the state of Lebanon” if it did.\n\nNaim Qassem, Hezbollah’s deputy chief, said on Saturday that the clashes near the border were keeping Israeli troops tied down in the north instead of leaving them free to deploy against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\n— Molly Cook Escobar, Elena Shao and Charlie Smart\n\nThe first convoy of aid trucks moved through the Rafah crossing on Saturday at Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. The convoy of 20 trucks came after days of intense negotiations.\n\nSatellite imagery from Tuesday showed crowds in Gaza waiting at the gate, aid trucks stuck in Egypt and several craters where U.N. officials said Israeli strikes had damaged the road.\n\nThe convoy of aid, which the World Health Organization warned would “barely begin to address the escalating health needs” in Gaza, comes as conditions have further deteriorated in southern Gaza. With clean drinking water in short supply, many Gazans have resorted to drinking polluted water.\n\nThe Israeli military has intensified strikes throughout the region over the past week, despite ordering the entire population of northern Gaza to relocate to the south last Friday.\n\nIsrael has hit dozens of targets in the south since Oct. 13, according to The Times’s reporting, news imagery and WAFA, the official news agency of the Palestinian Authority — a rival of Hamas that administers parts of the Israel-occupied West Bank. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said on Thursday that at least 81 Palestinians had been killed in southern Gaza in the previous 24 hours.\n\nGazan authorities also reported Israeli airstrikes throughout the week in the southern areas of Khan Younis and Rafah, as well as Deir al Balah in central Gaza, which also falls below the evacuation zone. In photos and videos, many children appeared to be among those killed. Gazan authorities have also reported that at least 21 members of the same family died in one Israeli strike.\n\nAbout one million Gazans have been displaced from their homes since the beginning of the conflict, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, some 367,500 in central and southern Gaza. While the exact number and location of internally displaced people who evacuated from the north is unclear, satellite imagery and photos show that, in at least one instance, tents were erected in the past week in the courtyard of a U.N.-run vocational training center.\n\nScores of U.S. citizens and Palestinians with foreign passports have been waiting at the border with suitcases, trash bags and other belongings in the hope of receiving permission to leave Gaza. It remains unclear if or when they will be permitted to do so.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby, Karen Yourish, Scott Reinhard, Eleanor Lutz, Agnes Chang, and Leanne Abraham\n\nThe Israeli military has outlined plans to launch a ground invasion of Gaza soon, with tens of thousands of soldiers ordered to capture Gaza City and wipe out the top leadership of Hamas. Here’s how Israel is preparing for the invasion.\n\nIsrael deployed hundreds of tanks and armored vehicles to two fields north of Gaza, which could be seen in satellite imagery captured earlier this week.\n\nThe sites are not a secret: Photographers have been allowed access to the vehicles, which arrived at the site sometime between Oct. 8 and Oct. 14, according to imagery from Planet Labs.\n\nPhotographs taken at the same location on Saturday show a range of armored vehicles, including Merkava tanks, armored personnel carriers and militarized bulldozers.\n\nThe military buildup seen in these images is about four miles north of the Erez Crossing, the primary entry point on Gaza’s northern border. The Erez Crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces recaptured it following its seizure by Hamas fighters on Oct. 7.\n\nWhile an exact accounting of every part of Israel’s buildup is not possible, Israeli tanks have also been seen in other locations. Tanks and armored vehicles were photographed on Oct. 14 at a repair center near Be’eri, about two miles north of the site of the music festival Hamas attacked.\n\nAhead of the ground invasion, Israel has demanded that the entire population of northern Gaza — some 1.1 million people — evacuate to the southern half of the territory. But many people are unable to move, and on Tuesday Israel said it had intensified its bombing in cities in southern Gaza, leading some Palestinians to consider returning home.\n\n— Josh Holder\n\nAn updated analysis of satellite imagery shows areas in Gaza that have been significantly damaged in the first 11 days of Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes.\n\nNorthern Gaza has continued to receive the brunt of the attacks in recent days, as airstrikes pummeled large parts of Beit Hanoun and the regions near Rimal and Al Jadidah. Strikes also inflicted more damage on the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, both of which were previously hit in the earliest days of the war.\n\nAreas along the Salah Al-Din Road, one of two major routes used by Gazans escaping to the southern part of the territory, were also significantly damaged. Dozens of civilians were killed by strikes as they attempted to flee south, according to the Interior Ministry in Gaza.\n\nOn Friday, Israeli officials warned 1.1 million civilians living in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south for their own safety, even as Israeli forces intensified bombings in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah. Pockets of Abasan al-Kabira and Khuza’a were also damaged, along with parts of the Nuseirat, Bureij and Rafah refugee camps.\n\nThe Israeli military has said that its airstrikes have targeted command centers, operatives and hide-outs that belong to Hamas, including “terror targets” in Khan Younis and Rafah.\n\nLiving conditions have deteriorated rapidly in southern Gaza as food, clean water and other essential supplies dwindle. On Wednesday, President Biden announced that Egypt would allow 20 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza as a test to see if a more sustained flow can begin.\n\nThe analysis does not yet show the damage to the Ahli Arab Hospital campus in Gaza City, where hundreds of people were killed in an explosion on Tuesday evening that Israeli officials and Palestinian fighters each blamed on the other.\n\n— Elena Shao and Leanne Abraham\n\nDaylight Wednesday made clear the scale of the explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital, even as the exact cause remained in dispute. Over the past week, hundreds of families, fleeing airstrikes, had sought refuge on the campus of the hospital. Photos and videos showed the extent of some of the damage.\n\nA small impact crater, caused by the munition that hit the area, was visible close to the parking lot. Damage could be seen on some of the surrounding buildings and structures: roof tiles were blown off a church, an ambulance port and a building. Windows in a building housing a cancer diagnostic center were shattered.\n\nThe imagery also showed more than a dozen vehicles in the parking lot that were burned, overturned or otherwise damaged. Parts of the parking lot were charred, and fencing was destroyed.\n\nThe hospital was also hit on Oct. 14, which damaged the diagnostic center and injured four staff members. Video and images reviewed by The Times indicate that most of the damage shown here was likely caused by Tuesday’s explosion.\n\nTwo hours before the explosion, the courtyard was filled with people singing for peace and children playing, Hosam Naoum, Jerusalem’s Anglican archbishop, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nA frame from a video taken Wednesday showed some of the personal items left by people who had been sheltering in the courtyard.\n\nGazan officials have said that hundreds of people were killed in the explosion, but the exact casualty numbers were unclear. Many of those killed were women and children, said Dr. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby, Karen Yourish, Scott Reinhard, Josh Holder, Eleanor Lutz, Hiba Yazbek and Christoph Koettl\n\nHundreds of people were killed by an explosion at a hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday, according to Gazan officials. Palestinian officials said the explosion was caused by an Israeli airstrike, while Israeli officials blamed a rocket launch by militants in Gaza.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning local time, the precise death toll was still unclear. Many civilians had been sheltering at the hospital. The Civil Defense in Gaza said medical teams were overwhelmed and unable to respond adequately because the hospital was so badly damaged.\n\nPhotos and videos from Wednesday morning showed that the courtyard area appeared to receive the most damage.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces said on Tuesday night that its intelligence indicated the Islamic Jihad was responsible for a failed rocket launch. A spokesman for the Islamic Jihad denied the assertion, saying the group’s armed wing was not operating in the area.\n\nThis video, verified by The New York Times, is the moment a munition struck the hospital in Gaza City, causing an explosion that the Gazan health ministry said killed hundreds.\n\nAhli Arab Hospital, founded in 1882, is operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem. It is the only Christian hospital in Gaza.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby, Eleanor Lutz, Scott Reinhard, Josh Holder, Aric Toler, Riley Mellen and John Ismay\n\nAnger over the hospital blast in Gaza led to a spate of protests across the Middle East and North Africa on Tuesday night, fueling tensions in a region already rocked by war.\n\nPeople took to the streets from neighboring Lebanon and Jordan to Morocco. Protests were also reported in Europe, South America and the United States.\n\nHezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that has fought escalating clashes with Israel in recent days, denounced the hospital strike as an Israeli “massacre.” The group called for a “day of rage” on Wednesday against Israel and President Biden’s visit, according to a statement.\n\nThe Israeli military and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the blast had resulted from a failed rocket launch by Islamic Jihad, a group allied with Hamas.\n\nThe cause of the blast at Ahli Arab Hospital, as well as the death toll, remained unclear as of Wednesday morning.\n\n— Agnes Chang and Karen Yourish\n\nFighting between Israel and Hezbollah intensified over the weekend along Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, fueling fears of a wider regional conflict. Civilians were killed on both sides of the border.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli military announced it would evacuate all residents who live within two kilometers of the border with Lebanon, strengthening orders from Sunday that civilians must stay close to safe rooms in their homes.\n\nHezbollah claimed responsibility for a strike that killed at least one Israeli civilian and injured three others on Sunday, saying the attack was in response to the death of a Reuters cameraman, Issam Abdallah, on Friday, as well as two other civilians killed in a separate strike on southern Lebanon on Saturday when their house was hit by shelling.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Mikati of Lebanon blamed Mr. Abdallah’s death on Israel, whose military said it was investigating.\n\nOn Sunday, a rocket hit the headquarters for U.N. peacekeeping in southern Lebanon. No injuries were reported.\n\nAttacks have been ongoing at the border since last weekend, when Hamas launched a surprise assault.\n\n– Lauren Leatherby, Ashley Wu and Agnes Chang\n\nAs attention has been focused in and around Gaza, tensions have mounted elsewhere in the region.\n\nSince Oct. 7, the Israeli military and Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party and militant group allied with Hamas, have each carried out multiple attacks along the Israel-Lebanon border. Israel has been seeking to prevent Iran from moving weapons through Syria, and attacks on Syrian airports have been reported. Egypt’s Rafah border crossing remained blocked as of Sunday, preventing Gazans as well as foreign nationals from escaping Gaza.\n\nCasualties in the West Bank have not approached the levels in Gaza. But at least 61 Palestinians have been killed with clashes with the Israeli army and settlers in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since Oct. 7, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.\n\nThe official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, reported that some of those people were shot and killed by Israeli forces during confrontations or protests, while others were civilians killed in a series of attacks by settlers. Israeli officials have not commented on specific incidents but said they were conducting raids in the West Bank to arrest people linked to Hamas.\n\n— Leanne Abraham and Ashley Wu\n\nHours after Israel ordered civilians to leave northern Gaza and designated a corridor for evacuees, at least one explosion occurred on the route. Videos taken shortly after 5 p.m. on Friday on Salah Al-Din Road show that at least nine people, some of them children, lay motionless, some maimed and bleeding, on the road near four burning cars.\n\nYusuf Al-Hindi, a medic with the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza who responded to the scene, said he saw about 30 dead bodies.\n\nThe health ministry has said at least 70 people were killed while they were attempting to follow Israel’s evacuation edict. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a reservist and spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces, said while there was no intentional targeting, he could not categorically deny that the explosion was caused by Israeli fire. The New York Times was not able to determine the cause of the explosion.\n\n— Eli Murray, Scott Reinhard, Yousur Al-Hlou, Aric Toler, Ishaan Jhaveri and Robin Stein\n\nA new analysis of satellite imagery shows an estimate of the areas in Gaza that were significantly damaged in the first six days of Israel’s retaliatory airstrikes. The Israeli Air Force said it dropped about 6,000 bombs throughout Gaza over that time.\n\nNorthern Gaza bore the brunt of the damage from the attacks, according to the analysis by satellite remote sensing scientists. Many buildings in the Rimal neighborhood were leveled by Israeli airstrikes, along with large sections of Beit Hanoun. Pockets of the Shati and Jabaliya refugee camps, where dozens were killed, also sustained damage.\n\nIsrael has said that its airstrikes have targeted centers of operations of Hamas, and that these can include mosques, houses and office buildings. Aid groups say that many innocent civilians have also been killed or injured.\n\nEarly Friday morning, the Israeli military called for the entire population of densely populated northern Gaza to evacuate to the southern half of the territory within 24 hours, in what appeared to be another step in readying for a ground invasion. The maps above show estimates of damage through Thursday evening, before the call for mass evacuation.\n\nOver the past week, about 2,228 people have been killed in Gaza, with 8,744 more injured, according to Palestinian officials.\n\n— Zach Levitt, Elena Shao and Tim Wallace\n\nIsraeli forces bombarded the Gaza Strip with an extraordinary number of airstrikes in recent days, a campaign both deadlier and more widespread than in recent conflicts. Some 6,000 bombs have been dropped since Oct. 7, the Israeli Air Force said.\n\nWhile a full accounting of the airstrikes is currently impossible, a partial record shows the wide range of the damage. The Times compiled the attacks from verified imagery, tallies from Palestinian and U.N. aid groups and statements from Israeli military officials.\n\nIsrael has said its retaliatory strikes, in response to terror attacks on Oct. 7, are focused on targets belonging to Hamas and that these can include mosques, houses and office buildings. Aid groups say many innocent civilians are also being killed or injured.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force has said the airstrikes have killed “hundreds of terrorists.” While it is impossible to verify that claim, at least seven of the houses that were destroyed belonged to leaders of Hamas, according to an analysis of on-the-ground reports from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, an independent organization based in Gaza.\n\nOverall, more than 1,500 Gazans have been killed in the current conflict, according to the Gazan Ministry of Health.\n\n— Karen Yourish, Lauren Leatherby, Eleanor Lutz, Elena Shao, Pablo Robles, Weiyi Cai and Leanne Abraham\n\nIsrael’s military issued a statement early Friday warning the entire population of northern Gaza to relocate to the southern half of the territory within 24 hours.\n\nThe statement named the marker dividing the north from south as Wadi Gaza, a strip of wetlands that curves across the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe U.N. warned that relocating over one million people would lead to “devastating humanitarian consequences.” A U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said it has “strongly appealed” for the order to be rescinded to avoid making “what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”\n\n— Weiyi Cai and Elena Shao\n\nFar more Palestinians have been killed after six days of Israeli airstrikes than in the first days of recent rounds of fighting, indicating the enormous scale of the Israeli assault on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Gazan Health Ministry said Thursday that 1,417 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli airstrikes. Those retaliatory strikes have come after attacks by Hamas in southern Israel killed more than 1,200 people, the deadliest assault in the country in more than half a century. It was not immediately clear how many of those killed in Gaza may have been militants.\n\nA U.N. official warned Gaza is “facing a huge disaster” as Israel has cut off water and electricity supplies to the territory and continues to pummel the 140-square-mile strip with strikes.\n\nOver the past 15 years, far more Palestinians have been killed than Israelis in confrontations between the two. In 2014, most of the more than 2,000 Palestinians killed in a 50-day war with Israel were civilians, according to data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The war also ended in the deaths of 73 Israelis.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby\n\nNew satellite imagery shows severe damage to residential areas in Gaza City and Beit Hanoun, a town on the northeastern edge of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn Gaza City, new imagery from Maxar Technologies shows flattened buildings in a residential area near several universities.\n\nVideo captured Thursday from the Shati refugee camp north of Gaza City showed people digging through rubble in the densely populated area.\n\nImagery from Beit Hanoun taken on Tuesday by Planet Labs shows dozens of structures flattened in residential areas.\n\nThe Health Ministry in Gaza said Beit Hanoun Hospital is now out of service because of the strikes.\n\nBeit Hanoun is about four miles from the Israeli city of Sderot, one of the towns Hamas terrorists infiltrated on Saturday and just over a mile from the Erez border crossing.\n\n— Agnes Chang and Lauren Leatherby\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli military said it had regained control of the region right outside Gaza and designated it a closed military zone.\n\nLt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a reservist in the Israel Defense Forces, said Israeli troops had plugged the holes in the barrier along the border that had been breached Saturday when Hamas terrorists crossed into Israel. “We are guarding it closely and making sure Hamas terrorists are not infiltrating again,” Mr. Conricus said.\n\nAbout 300,000 soldiers are assembling near the Gaza Strip for what could be a major ground invasion of the territory. Mr. Cornicus said their mission was to make sure that Hamas “at the end of this war won’t have any military capabilities by which they can threaten or kill Israeli civilians.”\n\n— Lauren Leatherby, Eleanor Lutz and Karen Yourish\n\nThe Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated areas of the world. More than two million people live inside the sliver of land, just 25 miles long and 7.5 miles at its widest. The confined quarters make it nearly impossible to avoid civilian casualties when airstrikes are launched against the region.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli military said its strikes against the coastal territory would be “bigger than before and more severe” because of the scale of the incursion by Hamas, which began Saturday. Israel has struck more than a thousand targets in Gaza so far, leveling apartment buildings, mosques and a marketplace.\n\nAt least 200,000 residents of Gaza have been displaced from their homes, according to the U.N.’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the scale of the humanitarian disaster is expected to get worse.\n\nSince Hamas seized control of the area in 2007, the Gaza Strip has been under a blockade that restricts the import of goods that could be used to make weapons and prevents most people from leaving.\n\nIsrael’s defense minister intensified these restrictions on Monday, cutting off flows of electricity, food, water and fuel into the area.\n\n— Scott Reinhard and Karen Yourish\n\nIsrael launched a series of retaliatory strikes against Gaza on Monday morning, hitting several mosques and a marketplace. While the death toll is not known, videos from the market, in the Jabaliya refugee camp, showed bodies on the ground and people rushing to find survivors.\n\nThe Israeli military said it struck more than 500 targets in Gaza from Sunday night and into Monday.\n\nAt least four of the destroyed mosques were in the Shati refugee camp, one of the most densely populated areas of the already densely populated Gaza strip. The Israel military has said that Hamas operates out of civilian targets, including one of the mosques it struck today.\n\nIsrael ordered a “complete siege” of the long-blockaded Gaza strip on Monday, two days after Palestinian militants launched a major attack into Israel.\n\n— Agnes Chang and Lauren Leatherby\n\nIsraeli soldiers were still fighting militants in at least six locations in southern Israel near the border with Gaza on Monday morning local time. An Israeli military spokesman said it had regained control of all the communities around 11:30 a.m., but there were still clashes on the ground after the announcement.\n\nLt. Col. Richard Hecht of the Israel Defense Forces said that not all of the breaches in the border fence had been fully closed, and more militants could still be crossing into Israeli territory from Gaza.\n\n“We are still fighting,” he said at a briefing on Monday morning. “We thought by this morning we’d be in a better place.”\n\n— Agnes Chang\n\nMore people died in Israel in a single day than any other day since Israel became a state, according to Israel’s foreign press office. Around 700 Israelis had died since attacks began on Saturday, according to Israel’s foreign ministry as of 10:20 p.m. local time on Sunday. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 413 Palestinians had been killed.\n\nBoth sides are continuing attacks, and if Israel uses the same playbook it has in recent conflicts and clashes last more than a few days, the Palestinian death toll will be disproportionate. In recent confrontations, far more Palestinians have been killed by Israelis than Israelis have been killed by Palestinians.\n\nThe U.N. reported that 11 Israelis were killed in 2021, the year of the most recent conflict that lasted longer than a week. That conflict began after the Israeli police raided the Aqsa compound in Jerusalem, prompting rocket fire from Gaza. Israel retaliated with airstrikes on Gaza, leading to 349 Palestinian casualties in 2021, including several dozen children.\n\nThe U.N. includes in its database Palestinians and Israelis who were killed or injured in conflicts since 2008 in either Israel or the Palestinian territories, which include the West Bank. Information on casualties is collected and entered by field staff and validated by multiple sources.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby and Karen Yourish\n\nRear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel’s top military spokesman, said the Israel Defense Forces were evacuating all civilians from the 24 villages near the Gaza border. The move is an indication that Israel might be preparing for an operation inside the Palestinian coastal territory.\n\nThe civilian evacuation “will be completed today,” Admiral Hagari said.\n\nAlso on Sunday, the Israeli military said fighter jets conducted an “intensive aerial strike” against Hamas military targets near the barrier dividing Israel from Beit Hanoun, a city on the northeast edge of the Gaza Strip.\n\n— Lauren Leatherby, Karen Yourish and Eli Murray\n\nIsrael and Hamas declared they were at war on Saturday after Hamas militants launched one of the largest assaults on Israel in 50 years.\n\nHamas fired thousands of rockets toward Israeli cities, and Palestinian militants crossed into southern Israel, killing civilians and holding Israelis hostage.\n\nIsrael retaliated with major strikes across the blockaded Gaza Strip, leveling multistory buildings, including a residential building with approximately 100 units.\n\nAt least 2,200 rockets were fired into Israeli airspace in the early hours of the assault, said Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, Israel’s top military spokesman. Israel’s emergency service, Magen David Adom, said it had received reports of Hamas rockets landing as far north as Tel Aviv. The exact location of many rocket strikes is unknown.\n\nPhotos showed dead bodies of civilians in their cars and at a bus stop in and around the Israeli city of Sderot. The bodies of several bloodied civilians were crumpled together in a room following an attack on the kibbutz of Kfar Azza.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Admiral Hagari said there were ongoing hostage situations in the Be’eri kibbutz and the city of Ofakim.\n\nPlumes of flames and smoke rose above Gaza City as Israel retaliated, reducing multistory buildings to rubble.\n\nThe streets of Gaza City were largely empty as residents prepared for intensified Israeli airstrikes.\n\nThe Palestinian territory of Gaza has been under an Israeli blockade, backed by Egypt, since Hamas seized control of the coastal strip in 2007. The blockade restricts the import of many goods and prevents most people from leaving the territory."
