        "text": "Description\n\nWinter Special, Fresh Til Gud Gajak (Jaggery Sesame Cakes). Gajak is a winter confection from north-central India. The sesame seeds are cooked in the raw sugarcane syrup and set in thin layers that can be stored for months. The dough is hammered until all the sesame seeds break down and release oils into the dough. Goes well with peanuts, coffee, or just for munching. According to Ayurveda, Gajak has known health benefits, thanks to all-natural and rich ingredients.\n\nWhat is Jaggery\n\nJaggery is unprocessed raw sugar, made by boiling sugarcane juice till it solidifies. The end product (gur/gud) is better than sugar in essential nutrients. It provides energy and is also rich in antioxidants and minerals such as iron, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. It also acts as a detox and helps digestion and cleansing the body by flushing out nasty toxins. Ayurveda recommends it for Vata and Kapha balancing properties.\n\nWeight\n\n200g (5-6 Pcs)\n\nSweetness\n\nModerate â€“ Depending on Jaggery. No added white sugar.\n\nIngredients\n\nSesame Seeds, Cardamom, Jaggery, Pistachio, Cashew, Walnuts, Clove, Nutmeg, Ghee.\n\nAllergen\n\nContains Sesame Seeds, and Tree Nuts (Cashews, Pistachio, Walnuts)\n\nBest Before\n\n18-20 Days. Store in a cool and dry place in an airtight container.\n\nNotes\n\nDivine Bites does not use any artificial colors or preservatives in products. The actual color might slightly vary depending on the color of Jaggery."
