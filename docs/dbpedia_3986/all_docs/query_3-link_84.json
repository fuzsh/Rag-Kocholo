In the immediate term, we are mobilizing resources through project restructurings and World Bank managed trust funds that deliver help to the poorest and most vulnerable people. The funds mobilized are being used to provide lifesaving interventions, including emergency medical supplies, food and water. These activities are being implemented through UN Agencies, including UNICEF, WHO and WFP, based upon their ability to operate on the ground during an active conflict. The World Bank grieves the tragic loss of life and devastating impact on all civilians from this conflict."
