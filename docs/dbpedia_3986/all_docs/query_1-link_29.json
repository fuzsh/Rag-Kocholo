There, every winter, the farmers combat the harsh cold by consuming the fruits of their hard labour- the Gajak. Made from home grown Til or Sesame and Gur or Jaggery, the two main ingredients of this sweet come together in a unique fusion called the MorenaGajak.\n\nAt Kabliwala, we painstakingly cook these hardened candies for hours over an open kadaai or wok before they turn into a shiny, smooth and thin texture. They are then allowed to cool into the hardened biscuit shaped candies called Morena Gajak which are so beloved across the country today."
