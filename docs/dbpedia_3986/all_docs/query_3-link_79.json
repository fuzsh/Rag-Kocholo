        "text": "Gaza is suffering. Before October 7, about 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people needed humanitarian aid. Now, almost everyone urgently needs help. Anera is providing food, water, medicine, and hygiene kits to those in Gaza affected by the war. Donate now to help innocent people in Gaza.\n\nHUMANITARIAN CRISIS\n\nGAZA PRIMER\n\nGAZA GOVERNORATES\n\nREFUGEE CAMPS\n\nIN THE NEWS\n\nStay updated on Gaza's news and track Anera's daily response log.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\nThe Situation in Gaza\n\n85%\n\nof Gaza's population is displaced.\n\nWith more than 1.8 million people forced from their homes, the humanitarian crisis is acute and only growing worse.\n\n> 50%\n\nof homes in Gaza have been completely destroyed.\n\nMany Palestinian families are now homeless or at overcrowded UN shelters with little to no resources.\n\n141 square miles\n\nis the total size of the Gaza Strip.\n\nBefore the war, Gaza's more than 2 million residents were spread out in this small strip of land.\n\nGaza War\n\nThe 2023-2024 Gaza war has been marked by tragic humanitarian crises, exacerbating the long-standing suffering of civilians in the territory. The conflict began in October 2023 and quickly escalated, leading to widespread devastation in Gaza and a severe humanitarian emergency.\n\n325\n\ndays since the war began.\n\nCasualties and Displacement\n\nThe conflict has resulted in a high number of civilian casualties, including many women and children. Tens of thousands have been killed or injured due to Israel's intense bombardment and ground offensives. The fighting has forced 80% of Gaza's population to flee their homes. Most are now living in overcrowded shelters with limited access to basic necessities.\n\nInfrastructure Damage\n\nGaza's infrastructure has been severely damaged, including hospitals, schools, and residential buildings. The destruction of essential services has badly impeded relief efforts and increased the suffering of the civilian population. The few medical facilities that are functioning are overwhelmed, struggling to treat the wounded amid shortages of supplies and staff.\n\nHumanitarian Access and Aid\n\nIsrael has restricted humanitarian access to Gaza, complicating efforts to deliver aid. Border closures and security concerns limit the flow of food, medicine, and other vital supplies. International organizations and local non-profits are working under extremely challenging conditions to provide assistance, but the needs far exceed the available resources.\n\nWater and Sanitation Crisis\n\nThe war has exacerbated Gaza's pre-existing water and sanitation crisis. Damage to water infrastructure has left many without access to clean water, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. Sanitation services are also disrupted, contributing to unsanitary living conditions in most areas.\n\nPsychological Impact\n\nThe psychological toll on Gaza's population is profound. Continuous exposure to violence, loss, and uncertainty has led to widespread trauma, particularly among children. Mental health services are limited, and the need for psychological support is immense.\n\nInternational Response\n\nThe international community has called for ceasefires and increased humanitarian aid, but efforts to secure lasting peace have been fraught with difficulties. Humanitarian organizations are advocating for sustained access to Gaza to provide relief and rebuild essential services.\n\nLong-term Consequences\n\nThe long-term consequences of the 2023-2024 Gaza war will likely include deepened poverty, prolonged displacement, and lasting psychological scars. Rebuilding efforts will require significant international support and a focus on sustainable development to address the root causes of the conflict and improve the living conditions of Gaza's residents.\n\nOverall, the humanitarian perspective of the 2023-2024 Gaza war highlights the urgent need for immediate relief, sustained support, and a comprehensive approach to peacebuilding to alleviate the suffering of civilians and prevent future crises.\n\n142\n\ncountries where our donors are from.\n\nGive today\n\nJoin our community of supporters.\n\nAnera's Gaza staff, from the very communities they serve, demonstrate extraordinary dedication in these challenging times. Their heroic efforts persist despite facing the same levels of violence and displacement as the rest of Gaza's population. Recognizing the imperative to prioritize safety, Anera emphasizes that our staff must adopt all reasonable measures to safeguard themselves and their families. This commitment extends to refraining from work or aid delivery until conditions are deemed safe. For more information about our work in Gaza, see our Gaza FAQs.\n\nWho lives in Gaza?\n\nA population of refugees and their descendants\n\nThe wars of 1948 and 1967 left hundreds of thousands of Palestinians homeless. Many ended up in Gaza and approximately 80% of the current population is not from there, but instead originated from other parts of historic Palestine. Over time, the eight Palestinian refugee camps transitioned from tents to semi-permanent housing.\n\nLearn more, read our Gaza Primer.\n\nWhat Was the Situation in the Gaza Strip Before October 7th?\n\nBetween 2007 and October 2023, a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt had stifled Gaza's economy, restricting the import and export of goods, including vital medical supplies and farmers' produce. This situation led to widespread poverty, with a shortage of medicines and medical equipment affecting Gaza's residents.\n\nHospitals in Gaza faced challenges treating patients due to outdated medical equipment and shortages of essential supplies like blood bags and medications. Individuals with disabilities encountered difficulties with inadequate care and inaccessible facilities. Water quality remained a concern, contributing to illnesses, while poor sanitation, exacerbated by the absence of sewage networks, further compounded the hardships faced by communities.\n\nCritical resources like water and electricity were in severe shortage, with daily power cuts due to inconsistent supply from fuel and electricity providers. Gaza residents grappled with a power crisis, impacting water purification, farming, and daily tasks. The unpredictable nature of electricity availability disrupted daily routines, making it challenging for residents to focus on essential activities.\n\nDespite these myriad challenges, the resilient people of Gaza had successfully built a functioning and intricate society that encompassed commerce, small businesses, education, art and culture, basic healthcare and private ownership of property and possessions. Regrettably, much of this progress was dismantled after October 7th, leaving the community devastated. In light of these dire circumstances, it becomes imperative for the international community to formulate and present a new vision for Gaza, aiming to alleviate the profound suffering experienced by the Palestinian population in the region.\n\nGAZA STORIES\n\nOur Impact\n\nstories\n\nDisplaced Family Finds Sustenance at Community Kitchen in Deir Al Balah\n\nAnera’s tekia program of community kitchens is sustaining displaced civilians across Gaza, including this one.\n\nstories\n\nThe Hidden Suffering of Displaced Women in Gaza\n\nMenstrual hygiene kits including sanitary pads and other essential items donated by UNICEF provide much needed relief in Gaza.\n\nstories\n\nA Gaza Grandfather’s Struggle and Journey Through War and Loss\n\nAbed from Gaza faces displacement and health challenges amidst conflict, relying on aid for survival.

Many Palestinian refugees also live in the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon. Before the war, Gaza's refugees lived in eight different refugee camps. Now many of these camps have been bombed, depopulated and reduced to rubble.\n\nAs its name suggests, the Beach camp, known to residents as Al Shati, was located on the coast, near Gaza City. It is the northernmost refugee camp and was one of the most densely crowded. Conditions were difficult — the once-beautiful sea teems with refuse because Gaza's minimal electricity is insufficient to run the region's sewage systems. The coastal aquifer, the only local source of drinking water, was contaminated and salty, so residents struggled to find potable water or vegetables that were safe to eat.\n\nBureij was a modest-sized camp with approximately 43,000 residents. It was located near the center of Gaza. The camp was situated close to a lake of open sewage, and sewage regularly flowed into the nearby sea. Many residents of the camp contracted gastrointestinal illnesses, and most of the water in the camp was too contaminated for residents to drink.\n\nJabalia was the largest of Gaza's refugee camps, with a refugee population of over 88,700. The camp was located in northern Gaza, close to Gaza City and near the Erez border crossing. Tens of thousands of refugees lived there in an area less than two square kilometers wide, making it one of the densest urban areas in the world.\n\nDeir Al Balah was Gaza's smallest refugee camp, with a population of about 113,000 refugees, and was located on the central coast. Its name referred to the date palms that grew abundantly in the area. Supplies of potable water were minimal. Though fishing could potentially provide a substantial livelihood for many residents, the fishing restrictions, which the Israeli navy often enforced with live ammunition, made this livelihood impracticable.\n\nThe Maghazi camp, with a population of 31,000, was located in central Gaza, not far from Bureij. This camp, with its small square footage, suffered from overcrowding and insufficient housing, as all the camps did to some degree. Poverty, unemployment, and intermittent electricity all contributed to the difficulties of day-to-day living in the camp.\n\nThe Khan Younis camp was located in southern Gaza, about a mile from the coast. It was one of Gaza's larger refugee camps, home to about 235,000 refugees. This camp, unlike some smaller camps, had multiple health centers and food distribution centers, but conditions were still difficult.\n\nNuseirat was located in a central cluster of camps, near both Bureij and Maghazi. It was one of Gaza's smaller camps, both in terms of its area and the number of its residents, about 161,000. It was nearer to the coast than its closest neighbors, so the dumping of untreated sewage into the sea and martially enforced fishing restrictions were heightened concerns.\n\nRafah was one of Gaza's larger refugee camps — it was home to about 224,000 refugees. It was located in the south of Gaza, near the border with Egypt. Rafah once engaged in a small amount of commerce with Egypt through clandestine underground tunnels and by shipping truckloads of flowers over the border. These small acts of commerce had largely been curtailed, and much of the camp struggled with unemployment.\n\nIn this log, Anera will provide updates on unfolding war in Palestine and our response.
