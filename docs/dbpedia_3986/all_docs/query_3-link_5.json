        "text": "Israeli forces have carried out a series of deadly strikes in central Gaza, including in the Bureij refugee camp and Deir el-Balah. Several children are among the victims.\n\nHere are the latest casualty figures as of 1:45pm in Gaza (10:45 GMT) on August 13:\n\nGaza\n\nKilled: at least 39,929 people, including nearly 16,500 children\n\nInjured: more than 92,240 people\n\nMissing: more than 10,000\n\nThe latest figures from the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the occupied West Bank are as follows:\n\nOccupied West Bank\n\nKilled: at least 624 people, including more than 145 children\n\nInjured: more than 5,400\n\nIn Israel, officials revised the death toll from the October 7 attacks down from 1,405 to 1,139.\n\nIsrael\n\nKilled: 1,139 people\n\nInjured: at least 8,730\n\nDevastation across Gaza\n\nAccording to the latest data from the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and the Palestinian government as of August 11, Israeli attacks have damaged:\n\nMore than half of Gaza’s homes destroyed or damaged\n\n80 percent of commercial facilities\n\n85 percent of school buildings\n\n16 out of 36 hospitals are partially functioning\n\n65 percent of road networks\n\n65 percent of cropland damaged\n\nNowhere safe to go\n\nThe Israeli army published an online map of the Gaza Strip on December 1, dividing the enclave into more than 600 numbered blocks. It asked Gaza’s civilians to identify the block corresponding with their area of residence and evacuate when ordered.\n\nHowever, leaflets ordering evacuations have been inconsistent with online warnings, which has confused residents.\n\nFurthermore, many Gaza residents have no reliable way to access the map with little access to electricity or the internet since the blockade of the 365sq-km (141sq-mile) Strip has resulted in a collapse of telecommunications infrastructure.\n\nEvery hour in Gaza:\n\n15 people are killed - six are children\n\n35 people are injured\n\n42 bombs are dropped*\n\n12 buildings are destroyed\n\n*Based on the first six days of the war, according to the Israeli army\n\nJournalists killed\n\nAs of July 31, more than 125 journalists, mostly Palestinians, have been killed since the Israel-Gaza war began on October 7. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists and the International Federation of Journalists, at least 120 Palestinian, three Lebanese and two Israeli journalists have been killed.\n\nSixteen years of Israeli blockade\n\nThe Gaza Strip has a population of about 2.3 million people living in one of the most densely populated areas in the world. It is located between Israel and Egypt on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nSince 2007, Israel has maintained strict control over Gaza's airspace and territorial waters and restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza.\n\nSince Hamas's October 7 attacks in southern Israel, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to turn Gaza into a “deserted island” and warned its residents to “leave now”.\n\nHow the Hamas attack unfolded\n\nAbout 6:30am (03:30 GMT) on October 7, Hamas fired a huge barrage of rockets into southern Israel. Sirens were heard as far away as Tel Aviv and Beersheba.\n\nThe group said it launched 5,000 rockets in the initial barrage. Israel’s military said 2,500 rockets were fired.\n\nAbout an hour later, fighters crossed into Israel in an unprecedented multipronged operation by land, air and sea. Most fighters entered through breaches in security barriers separating Gaza and Israel.\n\nHamas’s surprise attack came after Israeli settlers stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and after a record number of Palestinians had been killed by Israel at that point in 2023.\n\nAt 9:45am (06:45 GMT), blasts were heard in Gaza, and at 10am (07:00 GMT), Israel’s military spokesperson said the air force was carrying out attacks in Gaza.\n\nGun battles continued between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighters in several areas of southern Israel.\n\nIsraeli air attacks continued late into the night as did rocket fire into southern Israel.\n\nGaza's densely populated neighbourhoods\n\nThe Gaza Strip comprises five governorates: North Gaza, Gaza City, Deir el-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah.\n\nNorth Gaza extends for 10km (6 miles) and shares the only crossing into Israel through Beit Hanoon, also known as the Erez crossing.\n\nNorth Gaza is home to the Jabalia refugee camp, the largest in the Gaza Strip.\n\nGaza City is the largest and most populous city with more than 750,000 residents. Remal, Shujayea and Tal al-Hawa are among its most well-known neighbourhoods.\n\nAt the heart of the Remal neighbourhood is al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical facility in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDeir el-Balah is one of Gaza’s largest agricultural producers. It is also home to four refugee camps: Nuseirat, Bureij, Maghazi and Deir el-Balah.\n\nGaza’s only operating power plant is located along the district’s boundary with Gaza City.\n\nKhan Younis is home to about 430,000 people. At its centre is the Khan Younis refugee camp, where about 90,000 people live.\n\nRafah is the southernmost district of Gaza with a population of about 275,000. Rafah is also the name of the crossing with Egypt that is located there."
