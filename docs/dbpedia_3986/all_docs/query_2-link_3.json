I took this place fair and square... „ ~ Gazak's last words.\n\nGazak is a minor antagonist in Fire Emblem Fates. Gazak is a bandit who has a terrifying reputation all through both Hoshido and Nohr.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nGazak is a middle-aged man with dark skin, brown eyes, and a large scar around his face. Gazak wears a gray neck-brace, brown armor, a matching belt, a red piece of armor on his shoulder with some spikes on it, a golden ear piece on one of his ears, and a metal headband.\n\nBiography[]\n\nIn Paralogue 16, both Leo and Elise visited Leo's son, Forrest, in the Deeprealms. When they both see Forrest himself, Elise is first confused on his appearance, but then eventually fascinated by his clothing. However, Leo was not pleased about his appearance and his actions, with this causinh Forrest to run off to a nearby village. This ultimately led him to accidentally run into one of Gazak's brigands, who confused Forrest for a young lady and in suit, captured him. Due to this, Leo and Elise went to go save him and liberate the village from Gazak and his bandits. With the help of Corrin and their allies, they successfully protected Forrest from the bandit, and eventually confronted Gazak himself, with the player being able to spare and recruit Gazak or kill him.\n\n[]\n\nGazak on the Fire Emblem Wiki\n\nNavigation[]"
