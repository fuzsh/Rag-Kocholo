        "text": "Andrew Joseph Gazak, III (Andy) was born in Philadelphia on February 25, 1952 and raised in Woodbury, New Jersey. Andy went to be with his Lord and Savior on Sunday, December 31, 2017. He is survived by his loving wife of 40 years, Dixie Marchman Gazak, and two wonderful children, Tara Gazak and Kyle Gazak. He was preceded in death by his parents, Andrew Joseph Gazak, Jr. and Mary Lulla Gazak, and also a half-brother, Robert Gazak. Andy loved his family and more than anything wanted his children to know they were unconditionally loved. He made it a point to verbalize and show his love regularly as he was not the recipient of that when he was growing up. Andy also loved the Lord, who placed in him such a passion for music and the gift of an amazing, God-given voice. Music came into Andy's life at the age of 8 when it began with 5 years of instrument lessons and several years of choral experience through the elementary and high school grades. After graduating from high school in 1970 and then moving to central Florida to pursue his undergraduate studies in Aerospace Engineering and then medical sciences, two more decisive opportunities came along. First, Andy was in the mass choir that performed in the Grand Opening of Walt Disney World in October of 1971 and, in conjunction with that, became a performing member of the Walt Disney World Cast Choir for 3 years. Secondly and most importantly, the Holy Spirit began moving and convicting him, resulting in Andy accepting Jesus Christ as his Savior and Lord in 1974. Almost immediately, the Lord seized that momentum and began to redirect this new Christian into the realm of God's glorious music. After joining Calvary Assembly in Winter Park, FL, the church where he was saved, Andy auditioned for the church sanctuary choir in the spring of 1975 and became an active member. From that first step, God led the way and opened the doors. During the months to come his music ministry expanded from sanctuary choir to church ensemble, men's quartets, duets and finally soloist. He even met his future wife in that choir in 1976, they were married the following year, and God blessed them with a daughter in 1979 and a son in 1984. Andy was asked to be part of Festival of Praise in 1977, and he and Dixie traveled with an incredible group of people ministering in various churches all across the country. In 1978, Andy was given the opportunity to move to Charlotte, NC to become part of the original PTL Singers on the PTL Club. What an incredible opportunity where lifelong friends were made. Andy was an integral part of over 100 choral and dramatic, Christian musicals, cantatas and productions. He had the opportunity to work and appear with many of the best-known individuals in Christian music and performed on most of the major national Christian television programs. Also, as a recording artist, he recorded one solo album. Andy traveled around the country to share the love and grandeur of God through his musical artistry of song and testimony. The core of his outreach was focused on families and marriages . . . strongly experienced and witnessed by Andy & Dixie in their own lives of failure, separation, divorce . . . and then the rebuilding or their lives and remarrying each other a second time as a direct result of the miraculous, life changing power of God. God's faithfulness was proven over and over and was such a foundation of their lives. In addition to his solo concert ministry, Andy was a minister of music & worship leader at three local churches and had produced & directed various large-scale, Christian musicals and presentations. For 8+ years beginning in 2005, he founded and was executive coordinator and director of a regional, outreach ministry called Community Impact Productions. Through the help of other churches and scores of people, funds were raised from the concerts, shows and presentations that the organization's choir presented to benefit those less fortunate in our local area and beyond. Andy's spirit and dedication to the Lord allowed him to be used mightily in music ministry. Even as his health declined and he was no longer able to go out in concert ministry, he continued to serve in the sanctuary choir of Central Church until this past spring when he was given doctor's orders to stay off his feet. After a lower leg amputation in August, he kept talking about getting his prosthetic leg so he could once again sing in the choir he loved. God had other plans and now he is singing in the heavenly choir praising our Savior. In lieu of flowers, please do something to help someone in need. -\n\nVisitation Details\n\nMonday, January 8th, 2018, Central Church of God\n\nService Information\n\nMonday, January 8th, 2018 11:00am, Central Church of God\n\nDetails:\n\nService Extra Info A service in celebration of Andy's life will be held in the main sanctuary."
