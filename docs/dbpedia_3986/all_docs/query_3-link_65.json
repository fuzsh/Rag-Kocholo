        "text": "Update: 19 October\n\nApproaching two weeks since the Hamas attack on southern Israel, the war continues to rage. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) are believed to hold an estimated 200 captives inside Gaza, and they have continued to launch rocket barrages targeting south and central Israel, though no fatalities were reported from these strikes during the second week of conflict. Meanwhile, the security situation in Gaza has continued to deteriorate amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes, though the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have not yet launched an anticipated ground operation. A deadly explosion at a hospital in Gaza has resulted in a major increase in Palestinian fatalities, triggering protests and violent demonstrations across the region. Elsewhere, tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border have further intensified, with daily cross-border exchanges of fire leading to fatalities on both sides.\n\nThe Humanitarian Crisis Worsens in the Gaza Strip\n\nIsrael has continued to intensify airstrikes on Gaza (see map below), with the estimated Palestinian death toll inside the coastal enclave climbing to over 3,450 — among them more than 1,000 children, according to Save the Children. The number of Palestinian fatalities has already surpassed that of the 51-day Israel-Gaza conflict in 2014.\n\nDuring the second week of the conflict, Israel repeated orders for the forced evacuation of northern Gaza — including 22 hospitals — despite World Health Organization (WHO) warnings about its impact on thousands of patients. Over 600,000 Palestinians are believed to have already fled northern Gaza amid heavy airstrikes and the looming threat of a ground invasion.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes have also hit central and southern Gaza. Dozens of airstrikes targeted the southern governorates of Rafah and Khan Yunis and the central governorate of Dayr al-Balah during the second week of the conflict, resulting in hundreds of fatalities. On 17 October alone, these strikes killed more than 100 Palestinians in Khan Yunis — most of whom evacuated from northern Gaza — while at least 49 people died in airstrikes at the Rafah border crossing. Strikes have hit other shelters and refugee areas, including a United Nations-run school in al-Maghazi refugee camp in central Gaza on 17 October. Israel has claimed that its airstrikes in central and southern Gaza are aimed at Hamas forces hiding in the area. The regional head of Hamas’ intelligence was reportedly killed in the southern town of Khan Yunis on 16 October, while the military commander of Hamas’ central brigade was killed in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza on the same day.\n\nAmid a UN warning that no area in the Gaza Strip is safe for Palestinians to hide from airstrikes, thousands of Palestinians have remained in northern Gaza, taking shelter in schools and hospitals. In the deadliest incident in Gaza since the start of the current conflict, a blast at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City killed over 470 Palestinians and injured hundreds more. Israel has blamed the strike on misfired PIJ rockets, while Hamas has claimed that the hospital was hit by Israeli airstrikes. Hamas and PIJ rockets have fallen short in the past, with the IDF suggesting that at least 450 rockets have landed inside Gaza in this most recent round of hostilities. While some experts have noted that the lack of a visible deep crater at the hospital may support Israel’s claims, others have suggested that the scale of the explosion and the extent of destruction is beyond Hamas and PIJ capabilities.\n\nFollowing the blast at the hospital, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas backed out of a scheduled summit with Jordanian King Abdullah II, American President Joe Biden, and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, prompting King Abdullah to cancel the summit. In announcing the decision, King Abdullah accused Israel of engaging in collective punishment. The blast also prompted protests and violent demonstrations across the region. In Jordan, dozens of protesters attempted to storm the Israeli embassy in Amman. In Lebanon, following Hezbollah’s call for a day of rage, hundreds of people clashed with security forces outside the American embassy in Beirut. In Turkey, police used pepper spray to disperse protesters who attempted to enter the Israeli consulate in Istanbul. Meanwhile, protesters clashed with Palestinian police in Ramallah, Nablus, Tubas, and Jenin in the West Bank, chanting slogans against the PA leadership and in support of Hamas.\n\nThe volatile situation in Gaza is increasingly raising concerns about the region being pushed to the brink of a wider conflict with unpredictable consequences.\n\nTensions Flare Along the Israel-Lebanon Border\n\nAlong Israel’s northern border with Lebanon, violence has steadily escalated in the past few days. Following tit-for-tat exchanges of rockets and shelling in the first week of conflict, Lebanese Hezbollah and the IDF have increased their daily exchange of cross-border attacks, with the escalation of violence marking the most serious flare-up at the border since the 2006 Lebanon War. As of 18 October, ACLED records the killing of 13 Hezbollah fighters, three Hamas and two PIJ militants, five Israeli soldiers, as well as at least three Lebanese civilians (including a journalist) and one Israeli civilian in cross-border skirmishes since 7 October.\n\nOn 15 October, Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at several Israeli locations along the border, resulting in the first Israeli civilian fatality in the northern front, along with an Israeli soldier. The day after, Israel evacuated residents from 28 villages within two kilometers of the Lebanese border as it continued to reinforce its troops in the border area.\n\nOn 17 October, tensions further intensified as the IDF killed four militants who attempted to infiltrate Israel from Lebanon. Without claiming responsibility for the infiltration attempt, Hezbollah announced that five of its fighters were killed during hostilities on Tuesday – the largest number of fatalities the group has suffered in a single day during the current crisis. On the same day, Hezbollah fired several anti-tank missiles at the town of Metula and Yiftah Kibbutz, as well as two gatherings of troops on the border, injuring two soldiers and one civilian. Cross-border hostilities continued on 18 October, with three Hezbollah fighters killed and four Israeli soldiers injured.\n\nLebanese Hezbollah is believed to be a more formidable force and a greater potential danger to Israel than Palestinian militants, possessing air-defense capabilities and having amassed an arsenal of long-range rockets and precision-guided missiles since 2006. The scope of the recent round of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah has remained thus far limited, and the fighting has not spread beyond a radius of roughly four kilometers on either side of the border. However, depending on developments in Gaza, Hezbollah may become increasingly inclined to escalate the situation on the northern front to relieve pressure on Hamas and Gazan civilians. Furthermore, a miscalculation or mismanagement of the currently limited hostilities by either side has the potential to lead to inadvertent escalation. Given the severe regional implications that the widening of the conflict may have if a full-scale war were to break out between Israel and the Iranian-allied Hezbollah, the United States has been sending a message of deterrence by moving additional warships and aircraft to the region over the past two weeks."
