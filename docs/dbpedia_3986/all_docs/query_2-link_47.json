        "text": "The winters call for warming foods and amongst the wonderful range of winter foods, til (sesame) is quite a favourite and festive too.\n\nThere are so many versions of this famous winter sweet, and the best part is that it is quite healthy. Comes with the goodness of sesame and jaggery and that makes it rich in calcium. This version of the sweet is softer and hence easier to bite as compared to the ones made with sugar.\n\nGajak which is made from til and it is a North-Indian favourite, made across the region. The temperatures can really drop low in these parts of India and the people fondly make this as something to store and eat through the day. It really can be had anytime. It is fuss free and great option to carry while on travel.\n\nThe most famous Gajak can be found in these Northern cities of India – Agra, Meerut, Jaipur, Morena in Madhya Pradesh etc.\n\nOn my recent visit to Jaipur, I saw that Gajak was sold all over the city. Both in the famous sweet shops as well as on the streets. This til (sesame) and (gur) jaggery sweet is quite similar to the til laddoos or til chikkis that we famously find in Maharashtra & Karnataka – the only difference is that in Gajak the til is ground in this case.\n\nI was particularly impressed with the mawa gajak and wanted to try making it in my own kitchen and so I did. I am happy the way it turned out and so sharing the recipe with my family of readers.\n\nHappy Makar Sankrati / Lohri / Bihu / Pongal to all\n\nMawa Gajak\n\nIngredients :\n\n150 g Sesame Seeds (white til)\n\n1 tsp ghee\n\n100 g mawa / khoya\n\n100 g grated organic jaggery\n\n½ tsp Cardamom powder\n\nFor rolling the Gajak\n\nButter paper / Aluminium foil\n\n4 – 5 cashewnuts & pistachios finely chopped\n\n½ tsp roasted sesame seeds\n\nMethod :"
