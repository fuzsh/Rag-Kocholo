        "text": "Did you know- Our body is capable of getting its Vitamin D reserves full with 3 full days of sunlight and the best quality of sunlight is the end of winter and beginning of summer.? See how wise our sages were of ancient India, who introduced the concept of flying kites in winter so that sunbathing wouldnâ€™t add any kind of boredom! How exciting it is that along with the joy of flying kites, kids get direct sunlight and stock a good dose of Vitamin D for the whole year. Now you know, why weâ€™re so enthusiastic about celebrating the festival of Lohri and Sankranti?\n\nOn a religious note, the day of Sankranti is celebrated to venerate the â€˜Sunâ€™ god and the best way to do that is to rise with the morning sun and visit the 16th Century Galta Ji & the Sun temple located on the outskirts of the old city.\n\nOn this day, the devouts trek up the small hill to the temple exiting the City through Surajpol & Galtaji gate and pay homage to the deities in the temple downhill.\n\nOn Makar Sankranti, it is considered especially auspicious to take a dip in the 7 holy Kunds / water tanks located in this stunning Complex. While you are there, you might as well do some Surya Namaskars & get your quota of Vitamin D and all the other health benefits from the blessed rays of the Sun. Maybe just for today, you can go a little easy on the Sun-Block ðŸ™‚\n\nMakar Sankranti is also celebrated as the harvest festival of the country. The Rabi crop is harvested in the month of January and corn, mustard, peanuts, sesame etc. are the major crops harvested at this time. One day before Sankranti, i.e. on Lohri the new crop is offered to God through worshipping fire.\n\nLastly, how can we miss the most important thing about any festival in the city-Food? Makar Sankranti food is all about pakode, moongfali, popcorn, khichadi, gajak, feeni, ladoo and papdi-chat. Everyone loves to savour these special delicacies and the Children in the house go up and down the terrace for serving them. The youngsters become DJs playing the best songs the loudest on their rooftop.\n\nTake in the spirit of this exciting festival, Jaipurâ€™s style, this is special to hold on to in your memories forever.\n\nWinter in Jaipur is usually synonyms with loads of gajak on all those cold nights. And gajak love, for every jaipurite, is undeniably strong. But, I guess we have all faced this nightmare when mom sends us to bring some gajak, and the confusion just over boards our intelligence and wrecks our judgement. Defeated and lost, we come back home empty-handed saying the shop was closed. It doesnâ€™t have to happen ever again, we promise when visiting a gajak shop, just open up this guide and youâ€™re all set.\n\nItâ€™s a typical categorization after all?\n\nWell, not really. We too felt so, until we went ahead and researched. Well, there a lot more types than we imagined, but you know, they fell more like a parody of the few original types of gajak, so we decided and skipped them, for good.\n\n1 Tilâ€“ One of the humblest gajaks known to mankind, and itâ€™s better you know there is a til laddu in the options too. So, til, is basically a kind of Superfood, it has enormous benefits to our health and, is tasty, in gajaks to say the least.\n\nTilâ€™s most know gajak is til papdi Patti. However, it comes in a variety of til gud, til mawa, til gud khasta and what not.\n\nSweetenerâ€“ Mawa, Gud, and plain old processed Sugar\n\nShapeâ€“ Rolls(rarely), Rewdi, Patti(bar) and Ladoos.\n\n2. Mungfali (peanut)- this gajakâ€™s so popular it has its own name, itâ€™s called chikki. Itâ€™s usually made with gud and is also available with a combination of til. Itâ€™s so widely popular, we are sure itâ€™s the top-selling item at every gajak shop we came across.\n\nSweetenerâ€“ Gud, processed Sugar(rarely)\n\nShape-Patti(bar), and, you may find it in other shapes too.\n\n3. Sonâ€“ This oneâ€™s borrowed from the iconic son papdi, and yes, its one of those â€˜other typesâ€™, but, at least, itâ€™s iconic, unlike, chocolate flavored gajak. Itâ€™s mostly happened to be made with gud.\n\nSweetenerâ€“ Gud, processed Sugar\n\nShapesâ€“ Patti, Ladoo, and sometimes, Rolls too.\n\n4 Mawa (khoya)â€“ Gud mawa and til mawa remains the most common options, but thereâ€™s a simple mawa gajak all on its own too.\n\nSweetenerâ€“ Gud, and sometimes, processed Sugar is added.\n\nShapeâ€“ Patti(bar), Ladoo, and rarely Rolls.\n\n5. Dry fruitâ€“ there are a lot of different varieties in dry fruit gajaks, its range includes kaju, pista, and badam gajaks. People have a love-hate relationship with them, but you arenâ€™t short on options anyways, so we leave that up to you.\n\nSweetnerâ€“ Gud, processed Sugar, Mawa.\n\nShapesâ€“ Usually Patti(bar), oval, and what not.\n\nIf you still happen to have doubts or confusions, or a query, ask us in the comments section and we will be happy to help.\n\nJaipur is known to celebrate each and every festival with unconditional zest but the one closest to our hearts is Makar Sankranti. The kite flying festival is undoubtedly the cityâ€™s favourite. Only a true Jaipurite knows the charm of the festival. Itâ€™s not just flying a bunch of kites covering the sky on the 14th of the month but something way more than that. Thousands of bedazzling kites colour the sky, the sound of â€˜Woh kaaateâ€™ and music fills the air and the aroma of food fills the heart with joy.\n\nLetâ€™s take a look at the festival from the eyes of a true patangbaaz.\n\n1. Getting the kites\n\nJaipurites donâ€™t just buy any kite they come across, itâ€™s only after a lot of thought and calculation that they buy the kites that match with their personality. The task isnâ€™t easy. You have to check the weight, assume the wind speed on that day keeping in mind the current weather, the number of people flying it with you and in the end come the color and cost of the kite. Handipura, Kishanpol Bazar and Haldiyon Ka Rasta are the hub of these handcrafted flying beauties in the city at this time of the season. People buy around a hundred kites a few days before and itâ€™s only common to spot people holding kites with more care than while holding a baby.\n\n2. Prepping for flying\n\nWhat happens the night before is extremely important. Thereâ€™s an evening dedicated to prepare the kite for flying by putting â€˜tangâ€™ on it. All sharp, pointy objects and agarbattis come into play to punch four perfectly round holes into the kite. These are then tied precisely with a â€˜Saddaâ€™. Detonating a bomb is easier than tying proper tang. Too small, and the kite becomes heavy, too big and the kite goes out of control. Only a very few know the science behind it.\n\n3. Manjha-Sadda\n\nManjha is for the ones who have courage enough to become a part of the battle and sadda is for beginners. Every child remembers being handed over sadda and the immeasurable longing to fly kites with manjha. People fill their charkhis with the best and most trenchant of manjhas even if it leaves the user with deep cuts on their fingers. Then of course there are endless ways to cover these wounds till the doctorâ€™s tape is pierced again.\n\n4. The battlefield\n\nThe picture of the festival is no different from that of war. Thereâ€™s everyone involved, thereâ€™s blood and screaming, thereâ€™s chaos, aggression and betrayal and of course, there are weapons of war.\n\nYou can ring the bells of their homes all you want but thereâ€™ll come no response as Jaipurites remain on their terrace on the 14th. Even the ones who have trouble climbing, gather all the courage to battle the flight of stairs. Everyone sets up their music system one day before and play it at a volume slightly higher than that of their neighbour.\n\nKite flying is a constant affair, you have to keep it flying, check for nearby challengers and bring them down, soar it as far as it can go, scream your head off until your opponent feels humiliated, catch the kite that has just lost the battle and so many other tasks at a time.\n\n5. Roles of all ages\n\nWhile the older ones sit back and comment on the technique to win the fight, younger ones, sadly, are given with the responsibility of holding charkhis, rolling the manjha back into the charkhis, bringing water bottles from downstairs and the like. It is the population lying between these two that participates actively in the â€˜dangalâ€™.\n\n6. Jargons of the festival\n\nThere are certain terms used while kite flying that only a Jaipurite is familiar with. Hereâ€™s for you a few to familiarize yourself with the vocab.\n\nVo kaataa, tang dalna, pench ladana, dheel dena, lapetna , thudda/kaakh modna, dangal ladana, patang lootna, jujja daalna and anti banana.\n\n7. Festive Food\n\nDaal Ke Pakore,, Daal-Baati-Churma, Bajre Ka Khichra, Sooji Ka Sheera, Paushbara, are some of the few must have of the festival. The day is incomplete without sweets like pheeni, gajak, rewari and til ke ladoo.\n\n8. Lanterns and Firework\n\nThe city flies kites till it becomes barely visible in the night sky. To keep the festivity going, kites are replaced by paper lanterns that cover the sky beautifully like shooting starts. Fireworks mark the end of the festival and leave Jaipur with new hopes for the next Sakranti.\n\nThis is how we, in Jaipur, celebrate our favourite festival. Do join us this Makar Sakranti and add to the little colourful dots that light up our sky.\n\nBlog credits: Siddhi Modi, and intern at Jaipur Beat."
