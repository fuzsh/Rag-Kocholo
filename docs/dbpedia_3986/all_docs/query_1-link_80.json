        "text": "Peanut Gajak. This Indian style peanut brittle is a seasonal delicacy in many Indian homes during the winter months. It is delicious and very easy to make at home.\n\nWinter months in Delhi have always been so special. Just the thought of childhood back then brings a smile to my face. Each month and every season was always so special with something new to offer. We always associate food and memories, isn’t it ? Winter and peanut gajak or chikki are no different. Foods like peanut, sesame, jaggery and ghee are warming and so essential during cold months. Gajak or chikki are brittle made using peanuts, sesame and jaggery with a dash of ghee. They are made and sold a lot in North India in particular. I can still visualize street side vendors selling whole roasted peanuts and so many versions of these Chiki and gajak. The crunch and bite from these is unbeatable.\n\nBig stores and small road side vendors would sell these peanut gajak and til/ sesame chiki all through the cold months. I remember mom buying so much for us whenever she got back home. Because they were always sold everywhere and there was never any scarcity, no one made them at home. Winter months would mean sitting out on the balcony or on the terrace with a chatai or picnic mat and loads and loads of roasted whole peanuts that we would peel and munch on and so many versions of these gajak.\n\nBecause India is so diverse, every area would have their own speciality and taste for the same gajak. Now that we are in the US, we crave for authentic flavors so much. We always bring back some whenever we come back from our December trips to India. Despite the fact that most foods are available at the store here, the packaging spoils the freshness and authenticity most of the times. This is the reason that I make small portions sometimes during the winter months. You basically need only peanut and jaggery here, or some sesame added if you prefer to mix the two. The key here is to cook the jaggery well; if you do not perfect the jaggery step here, you may not get a good texture.\n\nThis time of the year is so special across the country. Lohri, Makar Sankranti, Pongal. One week and celebrations across the country. Chikki. Gajak. Til Gud. Khichdi Chokha. Each food has its own significance.\n\nI have shared a detailed recipe below with all the do’s and do nots. Hope you make a batch this week.\n\nHappy Makar Sankranti and Happy Lohri !"
