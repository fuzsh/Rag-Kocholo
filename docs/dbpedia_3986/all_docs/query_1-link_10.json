        "text": "You are here: Home / Desserts Recipes / Gajak Recipe\n\nGajak Recipe\n\nSharing is caring!\n\nSesame Seed Brittle is a nutritious dessert enjoyed traditionally in winter and is specially made for Lohri.\n\nGajak is a brittle made traditionally with peanuts, sesame seeds and jaggery. A delicious chikki is enjoyed as you bask in the winter sun or around the Lohri bonfire. Peanuts and sesame seeds are oilseeds that keep you warm.\n\nAt the arrival of spring, we celebrate with a festival called Makar Sankranti, Lohri. Also called Pongal, Sankramana is the auspicious harvest festival. Naturally, there are a lot of festivities across the country.\n\nNow a festival involves feasting and many traditional delicacies are prepared. Gajak or Til Patti.\n\nDid I say we make many mouthwatering dishes?\n\nHere are some of my favourites Sajji Rotti, Til/Sesame Seeds Chikki, Til/Sesame Seeds Laddo, Gul Poli. One recent addition to this list is the Tahini Halva recipe.\n\nContents:\n\nGajak Recipe and me\n\nWhy make MSK Gajak recipe\n\nHow to make Gajak Recipe\n\nFor Your Questions\n\nSome Makar Sankranti recipes we love\n\nRecipe card\n\nPin for later\n\nHello, and welcome! I am known as The Mad Scientist’s Kitchen, reinventing the foodie in you!\n\nTired of choosing between tasty or healthy meals? No more! Here at the Mad Scientist’s Kitchen, I experiment with flavours and cuisines that are as nutritional as they are delicious.\n\nJoin me in my lab as we cook up some treats! You can stay up-to-date with my latest culinary adventures by subscribing to my newsletter. No scam, no spam, just the clink of my pots and pans!\n\nI will love you to follow me on:\n\nGajak Recipe and me\n\nMakar Sankranti, Sesame seeds and gajak are synonyms in my books. So you will find me making some delicious recipes with til and peanuts and jaggery.\n\nJust on a lark, I used sugar in place of the jaggery once. Now I am hooked enough to make some every year. Reliving my childhood I guess!\n\nThis recipe I first posted on 01/012018 over a period I improved the recipe. So updating the recipe with my newer method this one will give consistent results.\n\nWhy make MSK Gajak recipe:\n\nMake this MSK Gajak recipe as it is\n\ncrunchy\n\neasy to bite into\n\na perfect recipe for first-timers making it\n\nHow to make Gajak Recipe:\n\nThese are the ingredients I used for the exact measures please check the recipe card.\n\nIngredients:\n\nSesame Seeds\n\nSugar\n\nCradamom powder\n\nClarified Butter\n\nMethod:(details and pics, stepwise desc)\n\nGrease your board, rolling pin and knife first and set it aside. You will not get a chance later and once the syrup is ready you can just pour the mixture.\n\nUse a thick bottomed wok and dry roast the sesame seeds on low flame. The sesame seeds crackle and turn slightly brown. Transfer to a plate, set aside.\n\nAdd the sugar to any pan. I prefer to use the non-stick pan here.\n\nKeep the flame low and stir the sugar occasionally, initially. (takes about 4-5 minutes)\n\nOnce the sugar melts stir regularly to prevent the sugar from burning. Keep the flame low.\n\nCook the sugar on low flame till all the sugar melts and there are no crystals. (about 15 minutes).\n\nFold in the roasted sesame seeds quickly. Add the clarified butter if using. Switch off the flame.\n\nTransfer the mixture to the clarified butter coated board.\n\nDip you hand in cold water and apply to the Gajak mix. (The mix is very hot. Please be careful)\n\nUse the greased rolling pin and roll the Gajak as thin as you wish.\n\nWhen the mixture is warm, make cuts. Believe me, this is easier.\n\nLet the Gajak sit for 30 minutes.\n\nOnce it has cooled down, you can separate the pieces.\n\nHow to serve:\n\nTraditionally Chikki or Til Ladoos were made for Haldi Kumkum, a time when married women visit one another. Along with a gift, grams and sesame seed, peanut and jaggery preparations are distributed. Serve Gajak this time.\n\nSubstitutes:\n\nYou can substitute sesame seeds with peanuts. Roast them well on low flame till the peanuts are crunchy.\n\nYou can use peanuts or sesame seeds too.\n\nSugar replace it with jaggery, a healthier alternative. You can use organic jaggery.\n\nIf you want to make a Vegan Gajak use oil in place of clarified butter.\n\nVariations:\n\nCalled chikki too gajak is made in plenty of variations:\n\ntil and peanut chikki\n\npeanut chikki\n\ncrushed peanut brittle. perfect for people who cannot chew hard brittle.\n\ncoconut chikki with peanut and til\n\ncashew nut chikki but it is made with sugar syrup.\n\nEquipment:\n\nThe equipment I used I am listing below\n\nDisclaimer: We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.in and affiliated sites. When you click and buy through this site, it helps us earn to keep this site running.\n\nHow to store:\n\nStore the separated pieces of the Gajak in an air-tight container. Stays fresh (if there is any left in the container for about 15-20 days).\n\nThis is my older picture which I am replacing with new images and a better method that gives consistent results. My recipe is copied from this recipe of Til Chikki using sugar.\n\nFor Your Questions:\n\nProtips:\n\nRoast the sesame seeds on the stove-top on low flame. Roasting them in the oven is not something I don't recommend.\n\nRoast the peanuts too on the stove-top on low flame.\n\nIf you are using jaggery once the jaggery is golden and you get a hardball when you drop the bit of syrup in water.\n\nAlways keep the flame on low.\n\nOnce the sugar melts do not move away from the stove.\n\nMelted sugar is very hot.
