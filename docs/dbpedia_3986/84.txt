Gazak (Japanese: ガザック Gazakku) is a Nohrian scoundrel lurking in a town near the Nohrian royal castle and the entrance to Forrest's Deeprealm, and the capturable boss of Paralogue 16 of Fire Emblem Fates. Not much is known about Gazak, as a generic Ruffian appears to take the leadership role of the chapter's ruffians, but Gazak is ultimately defeated by Corrin and his/her army. As a capturable boss, Gazak can be captured by Niles or Orochi and placed into the My Castle's prison if one is present, then recruited into the player's army as a bonus unit from there.

Gazak is also alluded to in Paralogue 19, where Percy convinces a mercenary group that his father, Arthur, is actually Gazak.
