        "text": "When Auguste Comte built upon the works of earlier philosophers to found Sociology, he probably anticipated it would be the only academic discipline through which all other disciplines would be studied.\n\nHe called it the queen of all the social sciences, and was he correct! Sociologists are scientists who study lives, communities, and institutions. They pursue scientific knowledge of practically every aspect of humanity. Today, we have:\n\nSociology of law\n\nSociology of mathematics\n\nSociology of deviance\n\nSociology of education\n\nSociology of the family\n\nSociology of race and ethnicity\n\nSociology of hip hop music\n\nSociology of cancer\n\nSociology of aging\n\nSociology of the media\n\nSociology of death and dying\n\nSociology of suicide\n\nSociology of gender\n\nSociology of work and occupation\n\nSociology of health and illness\n\nSociology of organization\n\nSociology of disaster or environmental sociology\n\nSociology of space\n\nSociology of scientific knowledge\n\nAnd many many more\n\nThese are only a few of the many concentrations and tracks within the discipline of sociology. Our students learn about philosophers whose ideological reasoning contributed to the development of sociology as an academic discipline. Some of these ideologies or philosophies predate the actual founding of sociology. Jane Addams, Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Ibn Khaldoun, Herbert Spencer, W. E. B. Dubois, C. Wright Mills, Marx Weber, Ferdinand Toennies, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Marianne Weber, and Alexis de Tocqueville are some early thinkers whose work either influenced or built upon that of August Comte.\n\nSociological perspectives thrive on the examination of the interplay of individuals and the group, namely how social groups influence individuals and vice versa. The nature, structure, and processes within which such relations emerge and their continuity are of similar interests to sociologists. Sociology, is therefore, a never boring discipline. Its broad scope encompassing every aspect of lives implies students can always identify a track to concentrate on.\n\nWhen you select this major, you will graduate not only as a scholar trained in social scientific research, sociological theory, and critical thinking skills, but also be versatile to go into many fields should you put off graduate studies. You can go into social research, health services, education, business, and the government. Other sociology related fields include demography, criminology, policy analyses, statistics, political activism, epidemiology, diplomacy, and community analyses."
