Classes: 9836060417 Herbert Spencer (1820- 1903)\n\n2. Theory of Social Evolution\n\n3. “Evolutionary Theory” or “The Laws of Evolution” is often regarded as the greatest contribution of the British sociologist Herbert Spencer to the realm of social thought. Though his social theories created many controversies, still those will not obscure the important role that he had played in enriching the field of social thought.\n\n4. Evolution – The most exciting concept of the 19th century Evolution was one of the most exciting ideas of the 19th century. It’s most influential sponsor was Charles Darwin. Darwin developed the concept of “Evolution” in his “Origin of Species- 1859”. Spencer was highly influenced by the idea of evolution. He applied the principle of evolution to the social world and called it social evolution. He saw social evolution as “a set of stages through which all the stages moved from simple to the complex and from the homogeneous to heterogeneous”.\n\n5. Meaning of the concept of “Evolution” The term “evolution” comes from the Latin word “evolvere”, which means “to develop” or to “unfold”. It closely corresponds to the Sanskrit word “Vikas”. Evolution literally means gradual “unfolding” or “unrolling”. It indicates changes from “within” and not from “without”__ it is spontaneous but not automatic. It must takes place on its own accord. It implies continuous change that takes place especially in some structure. The concept applies more precisely to the internal growth of an organism.\n\n6. Meaning of Social “Evolution” The term “evolution” is borrowed from biological science to sociology. The term “organic evolution” was replaced by “social evolution” in sociology. Where as the term “organic evolution” is used to denote the evolution of organism, the expression “social evolution” is used to explain the evolution of human society. Here the term implies the evolution of man’s social relations. It was hoped that the theory of social evolution would explain the origin and development of man. Anthropologists or Sociologists wanted to find a satisfactory explanation for social evolution rather than a description. Herbert Spencer made the concept of “evolution” and “social evolution” , the central concept of his sociological theories.\n\n7. Spencer’s Theory of Evolution As L. A. Coser pointed out the “evolutionary principle” or “the law of evolution constitutes the very basis of Spencerism. Spencerian interpretation relating to “evolution” could be two parts: A) General Theory of Evolution B) Theory of Social Evolution In his book “First Principles”(1862) we get his views about the first theory, and information and interpretations about the second theory are available in sociological treaties namely, “The Study of Sociology” and “The Principles of Sociology”.\n\n8. A. General Theory of Evolution Spencer’s “Theory of Social Evolution” is grounded in his “General Theory of Evolution”. But the evolutionary perspective as such. Spencer borrowed from Charles Darwin’s “Theory of Organic Evolution”. Spencer’s Concept of “Universal Evolution”: Spencer made “evolution” a universal principle in his treatise “First Principles”. According to Spencer, “evolution is a change from a state of relatively indefinite, incoherent homogeneity to a definite coherent heterogeneity.” For Spencer, this law of evolution is universal in character for it is applicable to the physical, organic and social world. For him, Law of evolution is supreme law of every becoming. Spencer was of the opinion that this universal process of evolution would explain the “earliest change which the universe at large is supposed to have undergone.” It also explains the law of evolution “as a master key to the riddles of the universe.”\n\n9. Three basic laws and Four propositions:- Within the framework of universal evolution, Spencer developed his “three basic laws” and “four secondary propositions”___ each building upon each and all upon the doctrine of evolution. The Three Basic Laws: 1. Law of Persistence of Energy or Force: There is a persistence of force in the world. There is the persistence of some sustaining energy in which all phenomenon rest. But this force or energy itself lies beyond our knowledge. This is a major irreducible fact which we can not explain but which we are obliged to accept. 2. The Law of indestructibility of matter: The basic elements of matter and energy neither created nor destroyed, but conserved. It means there is basic indestructibility of the elements of matter. 3. The Law of Continuity of Motion: There is a continuous motion in the world. In case of matter, motion can not be stopped. When form of matter changes, motion also changes. Energy passes from one form to another. It always persists and never disappears.\n\n10. In relation to the evolutionary process, Spencer has mentioned four secondary propositions or laws in addition to the three basic laws. The Four Secondary Propositions are:- 1. Uniformity of Law: There is a persistence of certain relationship among the forces in the world. The world is in order of elements. Recurring manifestations of events in the natural world, the forces, elements of matter, and relations of motion existing among them have a definite regularity. 2. Law of Transformation and Equivalence of Forces: The force, the elements of matter, the motion are never lost or dissipated entirely in a process of change. They are merely transformed into the manifestation of some other event or some other form of existence. 3. The Law of Least Resistance and Great Attraction: There is tendency of everything (all forces and elements) to move along the line of least resistance and of greatest attraction. 4. The Principle of Alteration or Rhythm of Motion: All phenomena in nature have their own particular rate and rhythm of movement, of duration and development. Force, matter and motion each of these has its appropriate pattern of transformation.\n\n11. Evolutionary Theory- A Joint Product of the Seven Laws:- It is significant to note that Spencer derived from these basic propositions his “law of evolution”. According to Spencer, all the phenomena of nature and all the changing psychological and sociological process of human experience and behaviour followed this pattern of change. All process of change are similar, in that they emerge out of the world.....in this condition of organised complexity; from a condition of indefiniteness to a condition of definiteness. This was how Spencer made evolution a universally applicable system of analysis. Spencer thus made applicable the law of evolution to analyse the development and evolution of the human society. In this context he gave birth to “The Theory of Evolution”.\n\n12. B. Theory of Social Evolution Two of Spencer’s main books namely, The Study of Sociology and The Principles of Sociology provide us more details about his “theory of social evolution”. Just as the “Theory of Organic Evolution” analyses the birth, development and death of the organism, in the same manner, “The Theory of Social Evolution” analyses the genesis, evolution and finally the decay of the society. Spencer’s opinion was that human society can be treated as an organism. Both the organism and the society grow from simple to complex and from homogeneous to heterogeneous. Abraham and Morgan have pointed out that Spencer’s Theory of Evolution involves two interrelated trends of thoughts. (i) Change from simplicity to complexity or movement from simple society to various levels of compound societies; and (ii) Change from military society to industrial society\n\n13. (i) Change from simplicity to complexity or movement from simple society to various levels of compound societies Spencer repeatedly argued all phenomena in all fields proceed from simplicity to complexity. Societies also undergo evolutionary stages of development. Spencer identified four types of societies in terms of stages of their evolutionary development. These stages are discussed below:- a) Simple Society:- This is the most primitive society without any complexities and consisting of several families. b) Compound Society:- A large number of above mentioned simple societies make a compound society. This is clan society. c) Doubly Compound Society:- These societies consist of several clans compounded into tribes or tribal society. d) Trebly Compound Society:- Here the tribes are organised into nation states. This is the present form of the world. The master trend in this process of universal evolution is the increased differentiation of social structures which leads inevitably to better integration and adaption to environment.\n\n14. (ii) Change from military society to industrial society According to Spencer, evolution proceeds from military society to industrial society. The types of social structure depends on the relation of a society to other societies in it’s significant characteristics. a) Thus while the military society is characterised by compulsory cooperation, industrial society is based on voluntary cooperation. b) While the military society has a centralised government, the industrial society has a decentralised government. c) Military society has economic autonomy but it is not found in industrial society. d) Domination of the state over all other social organization is found in the military society. In the industrial society the industrial society the functions of the states are very much limited. Spencer stated that societies need not necessarily pass through the identical stages of evolution or exactly become one like the other. He maintained there are differences between individual societies due to disturbances which interfered with the straight line of evolution.\n\n15. He refers to possible disturbances which are as follows:- i) Somewhat different original endowment of the races. ii) The effect due to the impact of the immediately preceding stage of evolution. iii) Peculiarities of habits. iv) The position of a given society in the framework of a larger community of socirties and v) The impact of the mixture of races.\n\n16. Some observations relating to Spencer’s “Theory of Social Evolutions”:- 1. Social Evolution is also as rigid as Organic Evolution It can be said that Spencer had a belief in the unilinear evolution of mankind. It means, “The mankind progress through stages of development is as rigidly determined as the evolution of individuals from childhood to maturity”. “As between infancy and maturity there is no short cut so there is no way from the lower forms of social life to the higher, but one passing through small successive modification. The process can not be abridged and must be gone through with due patience.”__ Spencer wrote in his “Study of sociology”.\n\n17. 2. Is Evolution Bound to move towards Progress? Spencer had claimed that the ever- present process of evolution was inevitably leading towards progress. He believed that man by nature was pre- destined to progress”. Spencer in his earlier writings describes the process of evolution as unremitting, unrelenting and ever present. “The change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous is displayed in the progress of civilisation as a whole, as well as in the progress of every nation; and it is still going on with increasing rapidity”. Though he very strongly asserted in the beginning that evolution is inevitably and unremittingly heading towards progress, the political developments that took place in England at the end of the 19th century made him suspect the power of evolution to promise progress always. He felt that evolution is not always endless progress. There is a limit to it after which disintegration and death take place. Moreover, disintegration is also gradual and involves a process of evolution in reverse. Evolution is thus cyclical in nature.\n\n18. 3. The process of Equilibrium involved in Evolution:- According to Spencer, evolution is a process leading towards equilibrium. He wrote: “A social organism like an individual organism undergoes modification until it comes into equilibrium with environing conditions; and thereupon continues without further change of structure”. The so called equilibrium will be established through what Darwin called “The struggle for existence”. Once the equilibrium is established societies will obtain greater freedom and peace. Since societies and institutions are subject to the “automatic process” of evolution, they do not have the capacity to alter the conditions but will have to adjust to the conditions.\n\n19. Critical Remarks on Spencer’s Theory of Evolution_Comments in Appreciation:- 1. As Bogardus has pointed out, “Spencer emphasized the laws of evolution and natural causation. He described social evolution as a phase of natural evolution.” 2. Spencer has made the principles of evolution universal in character. 3. Spencer’s work inspired British social thought to a great extent. 4. According to Bogardus, Spencer deserves credit, however, for developing the concept of social evolution as a phase of natural evolution and for stressing the idea of natural sequences in social matters.” 5. Abraham and Morgan have rightly commented: No one after Spencer ever matched either the sheer volume of sociological writing nor made more significant contributions to the science of human society.\n\n20. Critical Remarks on Spencer’s Theory of Evolution_Comments against Spencer’s view:- 1. No modern sociologists subscribes to the theory of social evolution. His attempt to equalise evolution with progress is totally rejected. But it’s modified form known as “Theory of Neo- Evolutionism” advocated by the anthropologists like Leslie A White, V. Gordon Childe and others are getting some publicity in anthropological circles. 2. Bogardus is unhappy with Spencer’s theory of social evolution for it underestimates the importance of man. He writes: “ the emphasis upon ‘man’ as a primary unit neglects the importance of the ‘group’ in the social evolutionary process. Moreover, Spencer underrated the intellectual nature of primitive man; he denied the early man the qualities involving exclusiveness of thought, imagination and original ideas. 3. Spencer had spoken of uniformity in the process of evolution. He did not realise that societies at the same stage of evolution do not necessarily possess identical politics, ethic, art and religion. 4. While Spencer believed that social part exists for the social whole, today, society is believed to exist for the welfare of the individuals.\n\n21. Organic Analogy\n\n22. Spencer took great pain to elaborate in great detail the organic analogy which is the identification of a society with biological organism. He regarded the recognition of the similarity between society and organism as the first step towards a general theory of evolution. In the words of Spencer, “ Society organised on the same system as an individual, that we may perceive something more than an analogy between them, the same definition of life applies to both”.\n\n23. Spencer noted several similarities between biological and social organisms:- i) Both society and organism are distinguished from inorganic matter by visible growth during the greater part of their existence. ii) As societies and organisms, grow in size, they also increase in complexity of structure. iii) Both in societies and organisms, progressive differentiation of structure is accompanied by progressive differentiations of functions. iv) Evolution establishes for both societies and organisms differences in structure and function that make each other possible. v) Just as a living organism may be regarded as a nation of units that live individually, so a nation of human beings may be regarded as an organism.\n\n24. After describing the analogy, Spencer also described the differences between the society and organism. According to him the parts of an animal form a concrete whole but the parts of society form a whole which is discrete. While the living units composing the society are free, are not in contact and are more or less dispersed. Spencer continued to use the organic analogy as a scientific premise to build his theory of evolution. Spencer tried to pinpoint the similarities and differences between organic and social life but denied that held the doctrine of organic analogy. In his words, “I have used the analogies, but only as a scaffolding to help in building up a coherent body of sociological induction. Let us take away the scaffolding: the induction will stand by themselves.” However, Spencer consistently used the terminology of organism in his writings."
