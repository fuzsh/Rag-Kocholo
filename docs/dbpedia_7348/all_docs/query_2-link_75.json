Auguste Comte is considered the founder of sociology. He advocated for sociology to be established as a separate and independent science that uses positive methods like observation, experimentation, comparison, and historical analysis. Comte divided sociology into static and dynamic components, with static focusing on the structure of society and dynamic on social development and progress over time. He is known for proposing the law of three stages of intellectual development - theological, metaphysical, and positive - and corresponding stages in societies. Comte's work laid the groundwork for establishing sociology as a respected social science.",
