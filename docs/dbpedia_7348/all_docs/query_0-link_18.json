        "text": "The research reveals the following comparisons and contrasts of August Comte and Herbert Spencer. Auguste Comte was born in the shadow of the French Revolution in 1798, as both technology and science was on the precipice of the Industrial Revolution. The world he was born into was experiencing great conflict, and people’s beliefs in prior institutions were being smashed. His focus was on a new social order and he focused on the study of this new society as opposed to the past belief in monarchism or religion. In fact, it is his work that coined the term “sociology”. August Comte believed that it was only through the methodology of observation, which could be measured and tested, that this new science of sociology would be validated. His belief is that the any study of sociology should be science-based. He was a critic of the Enlightenment, feeling its philosophy was destructive. In his book System of Positive Polity, he emphasized morality and humanity as cornerstones of political organizations in which society participated. His was a new world order and he attempted to use a scientific understanding to bring together history, psychology and economics. Above all, Comte was devoted to the idea of serving for the betterment of society. It's his belief that true knowledge is only found through science.\n\nHerbert Spencer was born in 1820 at the height of the British industrial revolution. His book entitled Social Statics achieved great acclaim when it was published in 1851. He looked at evolution as a change from being unstable (homogeneous), to one that was more stable (heterogeneous). In fact, it was Spencer who initially coined the term “evolution” and “survival of the fittest” many years before Darwin. Herbert Spen...\n\n... middle of paper ...\n\n...on the other hand, saw these laws, once discovered, as tools for social engineering. Spencer desired the people to be as free from external forces regulating them as possible. His chapter titles in Social Statics communicates his beliefs “Rights”; The Right of Life and Personal Liberty, The Right of Property, The Right of Exchange, etc.\n\nComte, on the other hand, defines religious and morality as a complete state of harmony. In his positivist view he gives priority to worship, doctrine and moral law which all have the same objective; that being that humanity is loved and served. Morality, along with religion and the sacred were subjected to research in sociological disciplines that developed. Comte was influential in playing a key role in this transformation. His intention was to replace Christianity with a system of an intellectual, moral and religious life."
