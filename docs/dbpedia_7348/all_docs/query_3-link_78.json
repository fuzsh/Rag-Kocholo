        "text": "Stanley Spencer is principally known for his imaginative paintings in which he blended the mundane and spiritual; alongside these he painted the landscapes and portraits that were always popular with his patrons. However, in addition to these two principal strands is a body of self-portraits that span Spencer’s artistic career, from his first drawings and an over-life size self-portrait begun soon after his graduation from the Slade School of Fine Art, to a final oil portrait and preparatory conté crayon drawing made in July 1959, just five months before his death from cancer. This report considers the role that self-portraiture played in Spencer's oeuvre arguing that while they were principally produced for the purposes of artistic development and commerce, they also illustrate the artist's views on the sanctity of the unidealised physical body."
