        "text": "Herbert Spencer and Social Darwinism: second father of sociology. Believed that societies go through “natural evolution”. Created a principle called “survival of the fittest”. His beliefs come from Charles Darwin Believed that sociologists should not direct society\n\nKarl Marx and class conflict: suggested revolution of social classes, where a group of people will reform their society and lead to a classless society without exploitation and class conflict\n\nGoals: to get sociology recognised as a separate academic discipline. To show how social forces affect people’s behaviour\n\nGroup behaviour cannot be comprehended only concerning their behaviour; we must always examine that social factors influence people’s lives\n\nMax Weber (Protestant Ethic): disagreed that economics is the central force in social change. Weber brought the birth of Capitalism. Believed that religion was the key factor in the rise of capitalism\n\nPositivism: the practice of the systemic method to the study of collective world\n\nProletariat: the exploited workers, who do not aims the means of production\n\nSocial integration: the degrees to which people are tied to their social group. The amount and quality to which any member of the group/society is connected by mutual values and social attachment\n\nValue free: the view that a sociologists personal values or beliefs should not influence social research"
