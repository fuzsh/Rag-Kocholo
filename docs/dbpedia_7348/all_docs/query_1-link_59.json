        "text": "Herbert Spencer (27 April 1820 – 8 December 1903) was an English philosopher, and a prominent liberal political and social theorist of the Victorian era.\n\nSpencer developed an all-embracing conception of evolution. He saw evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies.\n\nSpencer never married; he remained a bachelor. He contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, politics, philosophy, biology, sociology, and psychology.\n\nLike Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, he read Malthus' Essay on the principle of population, and was deeply impressed by its argument.[1] Malthus said that sooner or later population growth gets checked by famine and disease, and there are then many deaths.[2] So, he was prepared for Darwin's idea of natural selection, which he preferred to call \"survival of the fittest\". He did this in Principles of Biology (1864), after reading Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species.[3][4]\n\n\"This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called ‘natural selection’, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.\""
