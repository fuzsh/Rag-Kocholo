        "text": "In society, individuals view situations differently based on their own perspective. For instance, the color of the walls in a room may have different shades based on whose judging the color. One individual may view the room as aquamarine, one may see it as turquoise, and well another may just view the room as being blue. Every individual has their own way of thinking. It is believed by some philosophers that, human beings are born with the ability to think rationally. Rational thinking is intrinsic to humans. Thus, based on Comte and Spencer’s arguments, social order in modern society is possible through individual rational thought, understanding the society in which they live, and also maintaining a “social contract”. At the first glance of the words “social order”, one will notice that the phrase is about a stable society, with everyone having one common understanding of the world. However, if one must delve beneath the surface of the controversial phrase, one will notice that leaders of this concept created this system so that persons dwelling in that society would view certain situations, and the system itself, as being equal, fair and just. Traditionally, in order to have a society in which the persons are engaged in some form of order, a number of restrictions were implemented on freedom of speech and also the sharing of ideas among peers. The concept of “social order” allows persons in a particular society to have one constant cultural (religious), and political belief. Based on Comte and Spencer’s argument, social order in modern society should not be as strict as that in traditional society because of our ability as individuals to think rationally. Traditional society was a society which was mainly ruled by religion an... ... middle of paper ... ...ithin the society. Although the Enlightenment period was in support of individual rational thought, the views of the persons within the society should not interfere with the contract. To conclude, although traditional society had more control and stability, social order can exist in a modern society, even though individuals are engaged in more individualistic rational thought. Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer provide sufficient ways in which social order is possible in a more industrialized society. These scholars believe that individual thought, understanding the given society, and a social contract, can lead to some form of social order within the modern world. Nevertheless, in a modern society, there would always be chaos. Works Cited Hadden, R.W. (1997). Sociological Theory: An introduction to the Classical Tradition. Ontario, Canada. Broadview Press."
