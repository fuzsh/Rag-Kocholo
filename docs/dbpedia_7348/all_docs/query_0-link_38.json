Quite unlike other disciplines, (like economics, anthropology, human geography, political science and psychology), which are restricted to specific area(s) within the spectrum of study on human society, sociologists rather, study a vast areas of human endeavours and engagement, which are predicated on symbols and interactions (Open Stax, 2013, Bryant &Peck, 2007). Indeed, on account of different perceptions and orientations by scholars, sociology has variously been defined as the scientific study of society with underlined inquisitions of how order is maintained, as well as effects of group influences on individuals and individual on groups. Thus; sociologists are believed to study the overt and covert relationship between various social institutions in societies and how these institutions are instrumental to human actions and reactions especially in the areas of conflict and consensus (Bonilla-Silva, 1997; Zerihun, 2005). From western scholars to African perspectives and indeed, indigenous orientations, sociologists seem to generally study variety of social elements; especially those elements that cannot be separated from human survival, these include but not limited to ethnic-conflict, poverty, sport, health, drug abuse, law, war, religion, house work, technology, organizations, development and colonialism (Haralambos & Holborn, 2008). In the light of the above, sociology could be defined as a science which attempts a systematic study of different patterns of behaviour; since behaviour is an integral part of every individual, group and society, it therefore means that all behavioural patterns are shaped and reshaped by a number of complicating social elements, like our culture, values, ethnicity, aesthetics, religion and others. Partly as a result of the aforementioned and just like every other discipline across the world, classical and contemporary writers in sociology have given insights into the meanings and further denotations why sociology is universally considered as the “science of society”(Alatas, 2008). To further understand sociology and its inevitable connections to Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer in the global world, this chapter attempts to discuss the birth of sociology from its presumed founding father, August Comte (1798-1857), to Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) and Classical Theorists in the Social Sciences From Western Ideas to African Realities 138 their philosophical contributions to systemic view of the society and general understanding of their impressions on sociological development, as well as the realities in the present African sociological development. Auguste Comte (1798-1857) Philosophical Contributions to the Development of Sociology Earlier before the introduction of sociology in the mid-nineteenth century, there was an abstract view of the society and seeming haphazard interpretations of human actions. During this period, the study of society, human behaviour and general interaction were shrouded in controversies; the first social scientist to arguably use the term sociology was a Frenchman by the name Isidore Auguste Marie Francois Xavier Comte, better known as Auguste Comte, who was born in Montpellier, Herault, in Southern France on 19th January and lived from 1798 to 1857. (Although, some scholars claimed sociology was coined by Ibn Khaldun [1332-1406], 500 years earlier; a solitary intellectual of the fourteenth century Arab world, who hailed from Africa, but with a different language, colour and orientation). As posited by Comte, the term sociology is a combination of two words. The first part, which is a Latin word “socius”, means various things among society, association, togetherness or companionship; while the other, a Greek word, logos, stands for to observe, to study or to speak about (Nobbs, Hine and Flemming, 1978). The birth of Sociology was traditionally influenced by two overlapping social forces, one was Comte’s initial acquisition of knowledge in the existing sciences like mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, and biology of his time, while the other was the dominant social disorder which characterized Europe and other Third World countries. It is not surprising, however, to note that the emergence of disorder and the quest for natural laws which could guarantee social order, greatly influenced two scholarly works (Course of Positive Philosophy and System of Positive Polity between 1830-1854) by Comte, rationally written in order to address the eventual social change which characterized human social organizations. Like an eye opener, these books were used to illustrate and expose how empirical studies could be used, to reshape human organizations, movement and activities (Comte, 1875). According to Comte, who..."
