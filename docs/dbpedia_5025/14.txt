Joaquin Rafael Phoenix (born October 28, 1974) is an American actor and producer. He has received several accolades, including a Grammy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and nominations for three Academy Awards.

His first major film role was in 'SpaceCamp' (1986). During this period, he was credited as Leaf Phoenix, his self-given name. He later went back to his birth name and received positive reviews for his supporting work in the comedy-drama 'To Die For' (1995) and the period film 'Quills' (2000).

Phoenix was born Joaquin Rafael Bottom on October 28, 1974, in the Río Piedras district of San Juan, Puerto Rico, to American parents from the U.S. mainland. He is the third of five children, following River (1970–1993) and Rain (born 1972), and preceding Liberty (born 1976) and Summer (born 1978), all of whom are actors.

His mother, Arlyn (née Dunetz), was born in New York City to Jewish parents of Russian and Hungarian descent. Arlyn moved to California, meeting Phoenix's father while hitchhiking. They married in 1969, then joined a religious cult, the 'Children of God', and began traveling throughout South America.

His parents eventually became disenchanted with the 'Children of God' after they saw the sexual exploitation of women. They decided to leave the group and returned to the U.S. aboard a cargo ship from Venezuela in 1977, his third birthday.
