        "text": "His first Academy Award follows months of controversy over the arthouse origin story about Batman's nemesis, which stoked fears of inciting violence even as it hoarded awards and nominations.\n\n\"But so many of you in this room have given me a second chance and I think that's when we're at our best, when we support each other -- not when we cancel each other out for past mistakes, but when we help each other to grow,\" he said.\n\nAfter a string of television and film roles in his youth, the actor burst into Tinseltown with bad boy roles including an abusive boyfriend in Oliver Stone's crime flick U Turn (1997) and a sex shop manager in 1999 thriller 8MM.\n\nFor that film, the actor -- a strict vegetarian -- insisted that his clothes be synthetic and not made of leather, like those worn by the country legend.\n\nFive years later, Phoenix memorably threw critics and fans a curveball by making \"I'm Still Here,\" a fake documentary following his supposed mental breakdown and desire to become a rapper.\n\nA third Oscar nomination came and went in 2013 for the Scientology-inspired The Master,\"which saw Phoenix play an alcoholic veteran who becomes a disciple of a nascent 1950s cult called The Cause.\n\nIn 1986, Joaquin -- then known as Leaf -- made his feature debut in the science-fiction film SpaceCamp Three years later, he appeared in Ron Howard's comedy \"Parenthood.\"\n\nRiver Phoenix became a child star with roles in such films as the 1986 drama Stand By Me before playing the young Indiana Jones in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).\n\nJoaquin took a brief break from acting after River's death from a drug overdose in 1993 -- when a recording of Joaquin's desperate call for an ambulance was sold to the media.\n\nBut Joaquin -- who recently said he was \"indebted\" to his brother for telling him to become an actor -- landed a key role two years later in To Die For, alongside Nicole Kidman.\n\nIn addition to snatching the best actor Oscar, Phoenix also won this year's Golden Globe award for best actor in a drama for Joker, which won the Venice film festival's top prize.\n\nHe has called the role, for which he shed more than 50 pounds to bring to life Arthur Fleck's gaunt physique, \"one of the greatest experiences of my career.\"\n\n\"It seemed limitless, in how you could interpret the character and what you could do with it -- it didn't feel like there were any rules,\" said Phoenix.\n\nAlready known for his often surly and spiky interviews, Phoenix was reluctant to tackle the concern while promoting the film, famously walking out of the room when one journalist raised the topic."
