        "text": "(ran North, South editions of Pasco Times)\n\nThey came to Hernando County for the usual reasons - sunshine and to follow a family member.\n\nOtherwise, though, their stay here represents one of the most uncommon and obscure chapters in county history.\n\nThrough most of the 1970s and into the early '80s, 5 acres of pasture north of Brooksville was home to a commune bound by a religion based on strict vegetarianism.\n\nBecause they were also sun-worshiping nudists, \"they didn't like winter, still don't,\" said Herb Shapiro, a longtime friend of commune members. \"They were just a group of New Yorkers who came here to get away from winter.\"\n\nThe family member part of the story is crucial because it drew a long-overlooked candidate for Hernando County's most famous resident: Joaquin Phoenix, who recently won a Golden Globe award for his lead role in the film about Johnny Cash's life, Walk the Line.\n\n\"He was just a little bitty toddler when he lived here,\" said Al Sevier, a neighbor of the Phoenixes, who has clearer memories of Joaquin's older sister, Rain, and brother, River, who was already an acclaimed young actor when he died of a drug overdose in Los Angeles in 1993.\n\nThey displayed remarkable talent singing and playing guitar at community festivals, Sevier said, including what was once a major annual event in Spring Hill, the now-defunct Chicken Pluckin' Festival.\n\nShapiro doubts that last part.\n\n\"That doesn't sound like something they would have wanted to have anything to do with. . . . Not eating meat essentially was their sacrament,\" said Shapiro, who first met the founder, whose name he declined to reveal, in the late 1960s when they both lived in Woodstock, N.Y.\n\n\"We used to have barbecues every Friday night: I made an excellent London broil,\" Shapiro said.\n\nHis friend became a vegan - meaning he ate no animal products, not even milk or eggs - and began calling himself \"Light\" after a year spent in contemplation after leaving his job as a middle school English teacher.\n\n\"He's never really had a full-time job since, and he's immeasurably better off for it,\" said Shapiro, 66, who still lives in Hernando County.\n\nLight and his wife, \"Love,\" settled in Brooksville in the early 1970s after finding the land near Brooksville with a pasture for sunbathing and one-half of a double-wide mobile home.\n\n\"(The home) had plastic draped down the middle, just like you see them rolling down the highway,\" Shapiro said.\n\nThough the 20 or so members of the commune, then called World of God, didn't hold jobs, they had a strong belief in honest labor, Shapiro said.\n\nThey bought truckloads of avocados in South Florida and sold them to groceries and at flea markets around Brooksville; over the years, as money and supplies became available, they completed the missing half of their home, which still stands among oaks and magnolias off Lake Lindsey Road.\n\nThey painted houses, including the one owned by Melvin Kelly, who was then sheriff. Their work was of such high quality, and their terms so fair, that they earned widespread respect in the community, said Sevier, who hired a member of the group to wallpaper his kitchen.\n\n\"Whatever work they did, they guaranteed you would be happy with it,\" Sevier said. \"They wouldn't take your money unless you were happy with it.\"\n\nOther than, perhaps, \"a little vegetarian marijuana,\" Sevier said, it was clear even to an outsider that World of God was far removed from the drugs-and-free-love model of the stereotypical hippie commune. The members lived as couples and made quiet contributions to the outside community by, for example, stopping along roadsides to pick up litter and taking in stray dogs that they fed a vegan diet.\n\n\"I didn't tell anybody,\" Sevier said, \"but every once in a while I'd go down there and take (the dogs) a nice, big soup bone.\"\n\nThe only disturbance they caused was by drawing teenagers from Brooksville \"who came to look at the \"nudies,' \" Sevier said. \"Otherwise, you couldn't ask for better neighbors.\"\n\nThe Internet biographies of Joaquin Phoenix say he was born in Puerto Rico, and that his parents traveled through Central America with what is described as either a cult or a missionary group.\n\nEither way, the Phoenixes were committed vegans when they moved to Hernando County in the mid or late 1970s, encouraged by Love, who was the sister of Joaquin Phoenix's mother, Arlyn (also known as \"Heart\"). Because of their children - five of them - they did not live with the commune, but in a separate, small house that still stands around the corner from the former World of God property.\n\nShapiro didn't move permanently into the neighborhood until 1982, after the Phoenixes had departed, so he doesn't know how long the family lived in Hernando. Sevier said he remembers them living in the house for several years.\n\nThey definitely had left, though, by the early 1980s, when the children began working in Los Angeles, winning parts in commercials, television shows and eventually movies. Joaquin Phoenix's career as an adult began in 1995, when he earned good reviews as a neglected, dim-witted teenager in To Die For. He also starred in Gladiator (2000) and is considered a likely Oscar nominee on Tuesday for his role in Walk the Line. One other indication of his star status: When he rolled his car on a canyon road near Los Angeles on Friday, it was a widely reported news story.\n\nJoaquin, who has been famously skittish of the press since the death of his brother, has not made himself available for interviews, a publicist for the movie said. His mother, who lives in Alachua County, declined to talk about the family's time in Hernando.\n\nSo, other than reports that he remains a committed vegan, it is not known whether his contact with World of God left any lasting impression.\n\nBut the group itself has endured, breaking one more assumption about counterculture communes, Shapiro said. This is proof, he said, of the soundness of their principles: absolute honesty and absolute respect for other living beings.\n\nNow called Gentle World, the commune members own a house and land in a remote region of Hawaii, as well as a pristine 400-acre tract in the mountains of New Zealand, where a water-driven turbine provides them with electricity.\n\n\"They've had very good lives. They've been rewarded,\" Shapiro said.\n\nThey also regularly camp on a high plateau north of the Grand Canyon, where Shapiro joins them every summer.\n\nWhat has been their lasting effect on him?\n\nHe was an emotionally empty, overweight, Lucky Strike-smoking radio ad salesman in Woodstock when he met Light, he said. Though Shapiro did not quit eating meat until a revelation at the Woodstock music festival, Light planted the thought in his mind.\n\nShapiro found greater spiritual awareness almost immediately after changing his diet: \"When you stop putting heavy animal food into your body, you feel high,\" he said.\n\nHe has also found lasting health. At 66, he is slim and erect, with a full head of gray-black hair, and enjoys living simply on a well-tended 5 acres next to the former home of his old friends.\n\nWhen he talked to Light recently, he said, he thanked him again for helping him change his life.\n\n\"You know,\" he said last week, \"It's rare for someone to be able to thank the person who saved their life.\"Dan DeWitt can be reached at dewittsptimes.com or (352) 754-6116."
