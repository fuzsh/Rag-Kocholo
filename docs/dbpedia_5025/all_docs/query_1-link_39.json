To help out his fiancee, Kutcher has stocked their “secondary fridge” with things Kunis might want, from ice cream to anchovies.\n\n“He kind of pre-empted this. He assumed I was going to have goofy cravings,” Kunis said. “It happened last week. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I need a pickle.’ And he was like, ‘Hold on a second,’ and disappeared into the backyard and came back with the most amazing dill pickle of all time.”\n\nThat’s not the only way Kutcher’s trying to be helpful. He’s also learning Russian. Kunis, who’s from the Ukraine, already speaks the language, and he wants to be able to speak Russian to the baby, too.\n\nAs far as her birth plan, “I’m going to do it as all natural as I possibly can, unless there’s an emergency,” Kunis said, confirming that she plans to go without an epidural. “I did this to myself, I might as well do it right.”"
