        "text": "Story and photos by Tim Leffel\n\nA set of Caribbean islands known as much for its frequent hurricane hits as anything finds the best way to cope with being a quasi-state of the USA is to hit the beach, eat well, and party on.\n\nTour guides always get peppered with questions, but the ones they hear in Puerto Rico are a bit different than the norm. Do you call yourself a state, a province, or what? How long did it take for the mountains to turn green again? How long was your house without electricity? How many of your relatives have moved away?\n\nMy own views of Puerto Rico have changed many times over the years depending on where I was living and what was going on in the news. So many varied impressions and images have passed through my awareness that it’s hard to make sense of them. Islands used for military target practice, my trashy neighbors in the New York City area, piña coladas, and hurricanes all swirl around and create an image that’s hard to clarify.\n\nThen there’s the long list of who has walked across the TV or movie screen or pumped out through the stereo speakers. Puerto Ricans in entertainment include Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ricky Martin, Daddy Yankee, Bad Bunny, Benicio del Toro, Raul Julia, Joaquin Phoenix, and Rita Moreno for a start. Moreno is the third person ever to earn a PEGOT award combo: Peabody, Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.\n\nAll the while, the island has had several financial booms and busts just during my lifetime. Some were self-inflicted, but most were the result of swings in U.S. regulations, taxes, or incentives. This is because while it may feel like a foreign country and it’s an island in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico is part of the United States. Sort of…\n\nThe island hasn’t really had total control over its own destiny since Colombus landed on Borikén in 1493. That name is getting a bit of a revival now, with the Boricua word that that islanders use to refer to themselves now making its way into official tourism slogans.\n\nAfter the Europeans arrived, the local Taino population must have felt the devil’s forces had come to visit. Half the ones that didn’t die from European diseases got pushed into forced labor by the Spaniards. By the time the king emancipated them in 1520, there weren’t all that many left, so the Spanish brought in Africans to make up for the population loss they themselves had caused.\n\nPuerto Rico never had the mining riches of some mainland colonies or the vast fields of sugar cane that Cuba had, but it was an important stop on shipping routes, leading to the building of a massive walled city with stone forts in what is now Old San Juan. Even compared to Saint Augustine and Cartagena, the structures here look huge and intimidating and they did manage to stave off major attacks over the years.\n\nFast-forward to the early 1890s and the increasingly rich United States of America offered a struggling Spain $160 million for the island territories of Cuba and Puerto Rico. Spain said, “no thanks” and in the age-old plata o pluma (silver or lead) offering scheme, the U.S. then invaded in 1898 and ended up winning the short Spanish-American War, gaining not only this territory, but also Guam and the Philippines in the Pacific. While that last one eventually gained its independence, the others remain in a quasi-self-governing state with some rights that come with being under the arm of a very big brother. But that big brother is a bossy one most of the time.\n\nFor a while the island nation even lost the settled-on name it has used for so long. Puerto Rico (Beautiful Port) became Porto Rico for 33 years until a congressional resolution changed it back in 1931. Porto Rico is still how most Americans pronounce it, but maybe that just because we’re collectively lazy and monolingual.\n\nFor the past 124 years, Puerto Rico has been a limbo land. Even its local official name is wishy-washy: the “Free Associated State of Puerto Rico.\" Not an actual state, not yet anyway, but an “associated state.” Puerto Ricans can vote for president if they live in Florida or New York—more Puerto Ricans live “on the mainland” than on their native island—but they can’t vote if their home address is in the Caribbean. They elect a delegate who goes to Washington, but that person can’t vote except on procedural matters. On the plus side they are U.S. citizens with a passport, but don’t have to pay U.S. federal income tax. On the minus side, they rightfully feel like second-class citizens who don’t really have a voice. In a way they’re still living in a colony.\n\nSomeday this may change, but it would require putting a 51st star on the U.S. flag, which gets the TV anger channel crowd extra riled up every time there’s even a whisper of a bill to make that happen. The last thing one of the two political parties wants is a few more million votes that are young and progressive instead of old and regressive. So the territory stays in limbo, sort of a state but not really. Toss them some paper towels after a hurricane for a photo op and then forget about them.\n\nThe Glitz and Gutters of San Juan\n\nI see the convoluted history at the Puerto Rico Art Museum, with its weird and wonderful collections of island art through the ages, many of them either thought-provoking or head-scratching. One large mural tries to sum up what the islanders have been through over the past 500 years, which isn’t an easy job. Other exhibits go into more recent history, such as the 1950s independence movement led by Pedro Albizu Campos that put him in jail after charges of treason.\n\nOur art tour also included a stop in San Juan’s main street art district. There we strolled the blocks of powerful murals on the sides of buildings, including one titled 1492 that shows a sea of slaves in the wake of the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria that are crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Another shows a hugging lesbian couple, one red and one blue, with big curlers in their hair.\n\nThe paintings definitely outshine the neighborhood though. While this collection is admirable in its wild abandon and artistic freedom, the neighborhood itself would most charitably be described as “up and coming.” There were no street food vendors adding life to the chain-link-fence parking lots. The few bars and restaurants scattered around were filled with day drinkers who didn’t look too thrilled about the camera-toting tourists. While a few pieces conveyed a sense of hope, the streets were whispering a different story.\n\nA better bet was lunch spot Lote 23, a collection of food vendors in a downtown pocket park with picnic tables, some of the vendors set up in modified food trucks or airstream trailers. Here I had the best mofongo version I tried on the trip. This time the filling mashed plantain dish had the usual garlic, olive oil, and pork rinds, but also fried pork pieces, red onions and a nice aioli sauce. The Lote 23 project is an inspiring urban renewal project that has survived since 2016. The organizers arrange educational classes, run a community center, and sometimes host music or dance performances on the stage.\n\nI had seen Travel Channel shows about Puerto Rico that made everything look wonderful, as well as the Anthony Bourdain episode that shone a light on what a burden it could be to be chained to the USA when it comes to food regulations. But what I hadn’t realized from either point on that spectrum was that there are so many nice San Juan beaches. Really great beaches actually, the kind that most destinations can only dream about in their best resort locations, much less right in the capital city.\n\nSome of the hotels are on trendy Condado Beach, which is white-sand beautiful and lined with resorts, situated between the airport and the business district. But between there and the historic center of Old San Juan are several more beaches that are filled with locals having a picnic, with postcard-ready scenes that kept making me think, “Wait, I walked here? Why am I not staying in this city longer?”\n\nThanks to some tantalizing tax incentives, more than a few mainlanders with money have asked themselves this question and then moved to San Juan. In simplified terms, there’s a program in place where Americans can move to Puerto Rico and drastically lower their capital gains tax when selling assets or equity if they meet a few basic requirements, including sticking around for a year. When the crypto gains were flying, incentivized investors were coming by the planeload. Now that Bitcoin and Ethereum have plummeted, maybe not. The boom-and-bust cycle continues, this time roping in the mainlanders too.\n\nEastern Puerto Rico and Culebra Island\n\nWhen you ask Puerto Ricans where the best beaches are, they won’t normally mention the ones in San Juan. Those are the close ones they take for granted. The vacation spots are islands to themselves: Vieques and Culebra. Both once served as military training areas for the USA, with bombs and missiles dropping in areas just because they were close to the mainland and easy targets. This was clearly a giant waste of beautiful Caribbean beaches, so eventually Puerto Rico got its island paradises back: Culebra in 1975 and Vieques in 2003. The gunfire shots transitioned to rum shots.\n\nI boarded a Sail Getaways tourist catamaran out to the island of Culebra and got ready for a day of snorkeling, beaches, and Bacardi. I intentionally didn’t look up any photos or info on the island in advance, wanting to experience it with fresh eyes. When we pulled up to the best Culebra snorkeling stop about an hour later and dove in, it felt like this was a good day even if everything stopped here. We saw some colorful fish, a bit of coral, and gazed at a beach in front of some hills from the ship’s deck.\n\nWhen we got to Flamenco Beach further around the island, however, this Culebra day trip went from “That’s nice” to “Wow, look at that!” If someone tried to picture a perfect Caribbean beach that’s not all built-up and lined with hotels, this would be the spot in their mind. Powdery white sand, lapping waves, palm trees, and warm water. The one clue about the island’s past required a long walk from where our boat docked. Down at the end of the beach lies a rusty tank, a relic from previous U.S. military operations that was just left to greet the ocean waves every day—and serve as a strange selfie backdrop for visitors.\n\nAs we swam, walked the beach, and lazed around in the water with our drinks, I watched the crowd of mostly local tourists having a great time with their friends and families. There were troubles in the news, they had just come off of recovery from two major hurricanes a year apart, and it seemed that half of their friends were living on the mainland so they could earn more money. But there’s always a reason to laugh, the party goes on, and this island nation never has a shortage of new music to crank up. This is the birthplace of reggaeton after all.\n\nOn the boat heading back to shore, Bad Bunny came on the stereo because of course he did. These days he seems to be on every bar, boat, and restaurant stereo in the Americas. When I went to Colombia later this year, I heard more Bad Bunny music every day than I heard from all Colombian artists combined. His new album had just dropped before I arrived in Puerto Rico and it broke a whole slew of records on Spotify, including setting a new one for the most-streamed album in one day at 183 million. At one point, 23 of the top-30 songs on the Spotify chart were the 23 songs on the latest Bad Bunny album. This was after he was already the most-streamed artist on the platform in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe Jungle Bounces Back\n\nA Puerto Rico zipline experience on the tour itinerary didn’t get me too excited, but I thought it would be a good way to see how well the country’s vegetation had recovered since we’d be in the wild east where there are more trees than people. The zipline course was fun and as I’d hoped, the overlooks showed a carpet of green and it was hard to tell that hurricane-force winds had whipped through in such a devastating fashion a few years ago.\n\nAfterward we had a hearty lunch and went horseback riding in the countryside at Carabalí Rainforest Adventure Park. Then we took a ride into El Yunque National Rainforest, the only tropical rainforest under the administration of the U.S. Forest Service. Nature clearly recovers quickly in the tropics: it would be hard to look at a photo of this rainforest and one in Costa Rica or Panama and notice any difference in the thickness of the vegetation.\n\nBringing Back Farming in Puerto Rico\n\nWhen I pulled up my photos from Puerto Rico to see what I had snapped the most shots of, I found that the organic farm I visited was a close second behind Culebra island. I was fascinated by the story of Frutos del Guacabo farm, raising microgreens and edible flowers for delivery to restaurants and markets, just outside of San Juan. But it was also the passion of the owners, their deep knowledge of every plant on the property, and the amazing food they prepared. The lunch I had at their farm was easily the best meal I had in Puerto Rico.\n\nAngelie Martinez and Efren Robles started the farm in 2010 on a plot of land that seems too small to support a full-fledged farming business. They make the most of their space, however, and follow the high-margin path of growing organic vegetables, greens, herbs, and edible flowers in ways that allow them to get the most out of the room that they have. With hydroponic racks and greenhouse set-ups they harvest greens each week that go to the finest restaurants on the island. Many of the edible flowers and exotic herbs go to the top cocktail bars.\n\nEfren and one of his top workers showed off the operation with pride, pointing out the huge variety of items they grow here. Some of the plants are strategically placed to ward off insects, others because they attract pollinators. The most common planters are stacked used car tires. “They hold the compost and water well, plus they protect the plant when we are using a trimmer,” our guide explained. Passion fruit vines that cover a fence help block the wind.\n\nWe moved slowly down both sides of the entrance driveway to get an explanation of what was growing. We looked at kaffir limes, amaranth, Italian eggplant, blue Thai peas, Mexican tarragon, pomegranates, soursop, African basil, and a whole range of peppers. We passed cloves, bok choy, and trees bearing papaya and mamay fruits.\n\nSitting on covered hay bales, we sampled dishes that tasted farm-fresh and delicious, with root vegetables, green papaya, plantains, and other items that had only moved a few yards from where they were grown. The goat cheese came from the goats we petted as we arrived.\n\nRabbits are in a pen in the back of the property, but they’re not for food. “Rabbit feces is the cleanest fertilizer available,” Efren explains. “So their only job is to eat and poop.” In the water tank feeding the hydroponics system, tilapia fish and shrimp serve the same purpose, everything going in a natural cycle.\n\nThe visit gave me hope for a future recovery in Puerto Rico’s ability to feed itself. The reasons they can’t now are complicated. Those range from destructive U.S. policies that favor mainland farmers in the right congressional districts to a pervasive negative Puerto Rican view of agriculture. “Our people think that only poor people farm the land,” my city guide explained. “Everyone thinks you should aspire to work in a factory or an office. So this rich soil and great climate goes to waste.” I checked the stats later and found that his sweeping generalization is probably not far off: only 2% of Puerto Ricans work in agriculture these days.\n\nEfren noted that some competitors have popped up after seeing his success but he knows there is plenty of room for many more. “If the people living in Puerto Rico can start growing more of our own food, hopefully we’ll eat healthier and be more self-sufficient,” he says.\n\nMy short time in Eastern Puerto Rico and the San Juan area was only a taste, but it gave me hope to see such a resilient culture that was bouncing back after so much pain. More solar installations are popping up after the massive grid failure during the hurricanes. A few farms are supplying ever-improving restaurants. A craft beer scene is starting to blossom beside the big rum industry.\n\nAs this story was going to press, some 270,000 Puerto Ricans were still without power after yet another hurricane—Fiona—hit the islands as a Category 1 storm in September. Perhaps it’s not surprising that Puerto Rico is the global leader in professional boxing champions per capita. Like a fighter on the ropes, the Boricua are going to keep on swinging. And keep on dancing.\n\nEditor Tim Leffel is an award-winning travel writer and blogger who is based in Mexico.
