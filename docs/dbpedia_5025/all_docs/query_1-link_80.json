        "text": "It’s arguable that outside of the inner workings of the film world, Joaquin Phoenix isn’t the most recognizable of Hollywood’s A-list stars. However, over the last 20+ years, the Puerto Rico born Phoenix has put together one of the most impressive careers of anyone working today. He has not only been involved in some of the most well received films of the last 20 years, but also, through his performances, elevated them. So, let’s take a look at some of his best…\n\nUnless ‘Joker’ unseats it, Phoenix’s portrayal of returning Naval veteran Freddie Quell surely sits atop the list of his greatest outings. Uncertain of where he fits in the world on his return home, Freddie is lured into a cult-type group called ‘The Cause’, led by Lancaster Dodd ( the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman) who takes the short tempered and lost Quell under his wing, and begins imparting on him teachings from this religious/philosophical movement. Never has Phoenix’s raw acting ability been more laid bare than in this Paul Thomas Anderson classic. And never is it more on show here than in arguably the films best scene. Following both Hoffman’s Dodd and Phoenix’s Quell’s arrests, they go toe to toe against each other through the bars of a jail cell, launching PTA’s words at one another, with Phoenix’s powerful and emotional wailing countered by the supreme serenity of Hoffman. The film also landed Phoenix his second-Best Actor nomination.\n\nWith reviews having dropped on Saturday, its unlikely to think Phoenix’s turn as the Clown Prince of crime wouldn’t make a list of his greatest performances. Garnering Universal acclaim and what looks like a third Best Actor nomination for his role as tortured wannabe Comedian ‘Arthur Fleck’ who’s trials and tribulations lead him down the dark path to becoming Batman’s greatest nemesis. Astonishing. Mesmerising. Marvellous. Scary. Powerful. You name it, it’s been said about Phoenix in the last few days. And the world will get to see when the film hits Cinemas worldwide on October 4th.\n\nAnother of Phoenix’s collaborations with director James Gray. And another character played by Phoenix that goes on a rollercoaster of emotional discovery. Playing Leonard, a man torn between his volatile, but seductive neighbour, and the woman his parents have set him up to marry, Phoenix, as with the likes of ‘The Immigrant’, and ‘You Were Never Really Here’ portrays this character with his heart on his sleeve. It’s hard to think of another actor that can so easily exude emotion the way Phoenix does, and a film like this Romantic drama from Gray yet again gives him the vehicle to do so.\n\nHis most memorable performance, and one which earned him his first Best actor nomination. Director James Mangold once said (about Phoenix’s performance as country legend Johnny Cash) “I could shoot him from in front or behind it didn’t matter, he didn’t impersonate Johnny Cash. He became him”. Having spent six months preparing to embody one of music’s most famous sons, Phoenix learnt to not only play the guitar, but also to sing, as to add to the authenticity of his performance. His performance is wild and unstable (especially during Cash’s heavy years) but also somehow measured, in a sense that its clear Phoenix knows exactly what he is doing in every frame. From his on-screen chemistry with Reese Witherspoon’s Oscar winning performance as June Carter, to the still (somewhat) unbeatable live cinematic performances, Phoenix struts around on screen like he himself could sell out stadium tours. A truly iconic performance.\n\nOne of Phoenix’s very best. He is superb as the lonely Theodore. A lonely greetings card writer, who loses touch on reality following his emotional attachment to an operating system that is designed to meet his every need (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Phoenix takes the great Spike Jonze’s remarkably delicate script and injects life into it in almost every frame. Able to seamlessly drop moments of comedy into situations of inner conflict, Phoenix is mesmeriszng here, even more impressive when you take into account, he is the only person on screen for a large majority of the film.\n\nRealistically the film that launched him into Hollywood minds. Ridley Scott’s Roman epic was the first Best Picture winner this millennium, and it starred Phoenix as the captivating Commodus, petulant son of the Emperor, overlooked by his own father for leadership and not named heir to the throne. Phoenix is utterly hissable here, although such is his raw talent he manages to bleed through Commodus’ pain, anguish, and suffering at what he has become. The role also landed him his first Oscar nomination, for supporting actor behind Russell Crowe’s Best Actor winning turn as Maximus.\n\nSpeaking of Phoenix playing characters who are broken and torn, that is on full display here in Lynne Ramsay’s wildly underseen brutal crime drama. With Ramsay herself once describing the films lead ‘Joe’ a gun-for hire played by Phoenix as a man with a ‘head full of broken glass’, we get to see Phoenix in full flight, not only mercilessly battering down everyone and everything in his path in order to save young ‘Nina’, the daughter of a senator who was abducted and placed into the child sex trafficking system, but also see how the demons of his past are playing havoc with his present. Phoenix is stirring, towering, and outright scary here.\n\nPhoenix played Jewish-American ‘Bruno’ in James Gray’s ‘most personal film’. Somewhat based on his own grandparents, Gray’s somewhat tragic tale tells the story of ‘Ewa’ (Marion Cotillard) who is tricked by Phoenix’s character into a life of prostitution in order to secure the release of her sister from Ellis island. Phoenix delivers a reserved and contained performance as Bruno, as his character moves from loathsome to somewhat redeemed as yet another Phoenix’s character’s goes on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nThe first of two Paul Thomas Anderson films on the list. A film that polarised critics and audiences, followed Phoenix as pot-smoking, bare-foot walking, hippie PI Larry ‘Doc’ Sportello. Phoenix is utterly charismatic as the maverick detective with his reactions to the films other characters e.g. Josh Brolin’s ‘Bigfoot’ and Benicio Del Toro’s ‘Sauncho’ undoubted comedic highlights of the piece. Whilst his ‘Heroin Milk’ scene with Jenna Malone’s ‘Hope’ is Phoenix at his whacky best.\n\nThe only one of Phoenix’s supporting roles to make the list. A film rightfully so all about the pure magnetism of Nicole Kidman’s Golden Globe winning performance as Suzanne Stone. A budding television anchor who will do whatever it takes to get to the top. Phoenix plays jimmy, a member of the teenage group Suzanne is filming a documentary on, of course with the added caveat of a twisted ulterior motive. Phoenix is superbly naïve and besotted with Kidman’s Suzanne, seduced and bending to her will, ultimately to the point of no return."
