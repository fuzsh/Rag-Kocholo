        "text": "“It had the unmistakable stamp of the Brooklyn neighborhoods I’ve lived in for many years, though not in the form they take today but as they were five or ten years ago: scrappy but sophisticated, in that sweet transitional spot where it was still possible to feel in on a secret, part of something new and indisputably thrilling.”\n\nLiving in Puerto Rico for three months escaping New York winter during Covid. Run down — looks sketchy but no safety issues. Friendly people. Enough English to get by. Most things are shut Mondays. Lack of fresh vegetables, use deet to protect from mosquito bites, surprising coffee and craft beer scene, no spicy food, not much seafood (pork everywhere), scooters to get around, cars will aggressively stop for peds, not that cheap (comparable to US), legal weed, wildlife (lizards, frogs, birds, chickens), rainforests and fantastic beaches (warm water, waves).\n\nTop Pics\n\nSan Juan: Castillo San Felipe del Morro, Ron del Barrilito, El Bowl, Ocean Beach, Gustos, La Casita Blanca, Lot 23, La Preña, Vianda, JungleBird, La Factoría, La Placita, Puerta de San Juan, Isla Verde beach.\n\nElsewhere: El Yunque, Cabo Rojo, Rincón surfing, Cosecha, Uma’s, Puma 606, Finca El Girasol, Crash Boat Beach, Hacienda Tres Ángeles, Parador Bajo las Estrellas, Cueva Ventana, Hacienda Siesta Alegre, Lechonera El Mojito, Mosquito Bay.\n\nAbout\n\nThe world’s oldest colony (and oldest European city in America) translates to “rich port” and is officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It’s located in the Caribbean Sea, has over 3 million people, speaks (95%) Spanish and (10%) English (“Spanglish”), the only US territory with a non-English legal system, and is an unincorporated territory (no Congress vote, no US election vote, no federal taxes) of the United States. Comprised of several smaller islands such as Mona, Culebra, and Vieques.\n\nColumbus named the island San Juan Bautista (in honor of Saint John the Baptist), while the capital city was named Ciudad de Puerto Rico (“Rich Port City”). Over time the names switched. Often call Borinquén — a derivation of Borikén, the indigenous Taíno name meaning “Land of the Valiant Lord” — locals are known as Boricuas. Popularly known in Spanish as la isla del encanto meaning “The island of enchantment.” Puerto Ricans also go by the terms boricua and borincano.\n\nOnce one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the Spanish Caribbean, earning it the name of the “Walled City.” The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coquí — a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name.\n\nThe main drivers of Puerto Rico’s economy are manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and electronics) followed by the service industry (namely tourism and hospitality). The highest GDP per capita in Latin America, but 45% of the population is below the poverty line. After 21 consecutive years of budget deficit, Puerto Rico currently has a debt of $74 billion (73% GDP) leading to “junk status” bonds and almost 10% of its annual budget servicing debt. High cost of living due to the Marine Act of 1920, which prevents imports directly into Puerto Rico — instead they must be shipped from mainland US ports!\n\nAn archipelago in the northeastern Caribbean Sea roughly 70 miles east of the Dominican Republic, the 9,104 square kilometer island (roughly the size of Connecticut) is home to 3.2 million people — making it the third-highest density state/territory. Only the main three islands (Puerto Rico, Vieques, Culebra) are inhabited, dozens (including Gilligans Island) open for day trips, and some wildlife refuges (Desecheo, Monito, and Mona Island — the “Galapagos of the Caribbean” due to the large colony of unique iguanas). Uses the US dollar (nicknamed “dolar” or “peso”), grants a separate Puerto Rico citizenship, and uses an odd mixture of metric and imperial systems!\n\nPart of the Atlantic hurricane season. Notable hurricanes include the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (1851, only Category 5 landfall), Gilbert (1988), Irma (2017, 1 million people lost power), Maria (2017, electricity out for 4–6 months in certain areas), Dorian (2019) and Karen (2019). A 2019 report stated that Puerto Rico “is affected by climate change more than anywhere else in the world” (1° warmer since 1950, water 2° warmer since 1900, sea rising an inch every 15 years, worse storms). In 2020, a string of large earthquakes struck. Lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American tectonic plates and at risk from earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nHome to the largest cave network in the Western Hemisphere, the world’s brightest bioluminescent bay, 270 miles of beaches, and 17 lakes (all man made). Also has the highest US homicide rate (80% gang and drug related).\n\nLocal produce includes yuca, culantro (spiny leaf coriander), sarsaparilla, avocado, pimienta (allspice), achiote (annatto), ají caballero (the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico), peanuts, guavas, pineapples, jicacos (cocoplum), quenepas (mamoncillo), lerenes (Guinea arrowroot), calabazas (West Indian pumpkin), guanabanas (soursops), beans and some maíz (corn/maize). Spanish introduced wheat, chickpeas (garbanzos), black pepper, onions, garlic, cilantro (using plant and seeds in cooking), basil, sugarcane, citrus fruit, grapes, eggplant, lard, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, goat, cocoa, tomatoes, chayote, papaya, bell peppers, passion fruit, vanilla, and dairy. Olives are popular but don’t grow in the climate. Coconuts, coffee, orégano brujo, okra, tamarind, yams, sesame seeds, gandules (pigeon peas in English), banana fruit and other root vegetables all came through Africa. African slaves also introduced the deep-frying of food. Panapén (breadfruit) was first imported from the South Pacific as cheap slave food.\n\nLocal cuisine (called cocina criolla) is pork-heavy and includes mofongo, tostones (plantain chips), arroz con gandules (national dish), pasteles (tamales), pique (hot sauce) and the piña colada (claimed to be invented at Caribe Hilton in 1954; Barrachina in 1963). The only rum producing country in the world to enforce a minimum aging law. The word “barbecue” derives from the Taínos word barbacoa.\n\nLocal arts include Santos — Catholic statuettes introduced by the Spanish to convert the local Taíno population — crafted by santeros (or santeras, if female) and stored in special wooden boxes called nichos and passed down through generations, but reduced in popularity after the US took possession in 1898. Caretas — masks worn during carnivals and used by the Spanish to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church — feature several horns and fangs and are usually constructed of papier-mâché and coconut shells.\n\nUnlike in most states of the US, cockfighting was legal in Puerto Rico until 2019. It is known as the “Gentleman’s Sport” due to the common practice of verbal wagers. Incredibly popular (a million spectators annually until 2005, 83 venues) and often televised, roosters are specially bred to fight.\n\nNotable Puerto Ricans include Enrique Laguarre (novelist), Roberto Clemente (baseball), Héctor “Macho” Camacho (boxing), Julia de Burgos (poet), José Ferrer (actor), Benicio del Toro, Raúl Juliá, Joaquin Phoenix, Luis Guzmán, Bad Bunny and Ricky Martin. Competes independently in the Olympics, World Cup, and Miss Universe (won five times).\n\nHistory\n\nThe first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people migrated from the South American mainland around 4,000 years ago and were later displaced by the Saladoid, a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC. Between 120 and 400 AD the Igneri tribe arrived from northern South America, co-existing with the Arcaico from the 4th and 10th centuries. The Taíno culture developed between the 7th and 11th centuries and became dominant by around 1000 AD, calling the island Borikén. Savage cannibalistic Caribes from neighboring islands attacked Taíno villages and stole their women — and were later reduced to slavery by the Spanish.\n\nIn 1493, Christopher Columbus “discovered” and colonized the island for Spain during his second voyage; for which he arrived somewhere between Aguada and Aguadilla (disputed) and only stayed two days and brought a papal bull from King Ferdinand empowering him to use any course of action necessary for the expansion of the Spanish Empire and Christian faith. On Columbus’ arrival there were an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Taíno Amerindians, led by the cacique (chief) Agüeybaná. Despite the protection Laws of Burgos, some Taíno were forced into labor while the population suffered extremely high fatalities from European diseases. The colony relied heavily on enslaved Africans and creole blacks for the growing sugar and coffee plantations.\n\nIn 1508, the first Spanish settlement of Caparra by Ponce de León, the first governor; abandoned and relocated to 4 miles north to Old San Juan due to malaria and Taíno attacks. In 1511, chief Urayouan ordered the drowning of a Spaniard to test whether they were Gods. In 1519, Pope Leo X declared Puerto Rico the general headquarters of the Spanish Inquisition! In 1520, King Charles I of Spain issued a royal decree emancipating the remaining Taíno population. In 1523, the first sugar mill in San Germàn. In 1595, Queen Elizabeth I dispatched Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins from Plymouth, England, with 27 ships and 2,500 men to capture Puerto Rico in the Battle of San Juan; Hawkins died of fever before arriving and Drake retreated after losing around ten boats and 400 men. In 1625, a second Battle of San Juan when the Dutch attacked — setting the village on fire before withdrawing.\n\nBy the end of the 16th century, the Spanish Empire was diminishing and redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king’s fleet and West Indies convoys.\n\nIn 1797, Sir Ralph Abercromby’s fleet invaded the island with around 60 ships and 6,000–13,000 men with both sides sustaining heavy losses before a British retreat. In 1809, recognized as an overseas province of Spain. In 1821, Marcos Xiorro led an unsuccessful slave revolt — but achieved legendary folklore status. In the early 19th century, 450,000 mostly-Spanish immigrants arrived on the promise of free land while smugglers and pirates prospered. In 1873, slavery abolished. In 1890, Spain refused an offer by the US to buy Puerto Rico for $160 million.\n\nIn 1898, following the Spanish–American War, the US acquired Puerto Rico for $20 million. In 1898, cockfighting banned (lasted 34 years). In 1900, Puerto Rico recognized by Congress. From 1898 to 1932, called Porto Rico. In 1914, In 1914, voted unanimously in favor of independence from the US, but this was rejected by Congress as unconstitutional! In 1917, locals were recognized as American citizens — which was unanimously opposed as thought to be a ploy to draft citizens to fight in World War I; the Jones–Shafroth Act provided for a local senate, legislative assembly and bill of rights. In 1918, a major earthquake, tsunami and several hurricanes — as well as the Great Depression — impoverished the island for decades. In 1936, independence defeated by the local political party in charge.\n\nIn 1937, the Ponce Massacre when police opened fire on a protest killing 19 and injuring over 200; in the aftermath another independence bill that was defeated. In 1940, gambling legalized. In 1947, Congress approved a local constitution allowing locals to elect a governor. In 1948, the Olympics was the first major sporting event as the nation of Puerto Rico. From 1948 to 1957, a “gag law” made it illegal to challenge the government, sign a patriotic song, or display the Puerto Rico flag! In 1950, various revolts against the US government leading to martial law and attacks against insurgents with infantry, artillery and bombers! In 1950, Puerto Rican nationalists from New York attempted to assassinate President Truman in DC; one was killed while the other captured, sentenced to death, commuted by Truman, then released by Carter 29 years later. In 1952, the Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted.\n\nIn 1955, the maiden voyage of the world’s first nuclear submarine, the USS Nautilus, arrived in San Juan after breaking the record for longest submarine trip, time underwater, and average speed. In 1967, overwhelming vote to remain a commonwealth. In 1979, held the Pan-American Games. In 1986, visit by Pope John Paul II. In 1992, 70 sailboats arrive in San Juan to celebrate the 500th anniversary of European discovery of the Americas. In 1993, voted to retain Commonwealth by only 2.3%. In 1998, another statehood vote ended with 0.1% for commonwealth; 2.5% for independence; 46.5% for statehood; and 50.3% going to None of the Above! In 2006, first person to receive Puerto Rican citizenship. In 2012, referendum voted to become the 51st US state.\n\nMap\n\nSan Juan\n\nOld San Juan is historic but touristy (with vibrant facades); Condado is the tourist hotel and beach area; Miramar is basically Bushwick; Santurce is a cool bar area; Ocean Park has the best beach; Hato Rey is the financial district (the street is called the “Gold Bullion Mile”); and NoLo (North of Loiza Street) has the best restaurants.\n\nFeatured in the songs En mi Viejo San Juan (recorded by over 1,000 times by artists around the world) and Despacito (music video filmed La Perla); film The Rum Diary; novels The Rum Diary and United States of Banana; and music videos by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee, Ricky Martin, Bad Bunny, and Marc Anthony.\n\n* Note: An asterisk denotes a place I have yet to visit properly.\n\nCasa Blanca (1521)\n\nHouse museum of of 16th and 17th artifacts in the former residence of Juan Ponce de León and his family (although de Leon died before living in the house) until the mid-18th century. First governor’s residence until moving to Fortaleza. Disrepair following World War II. In 1967, transferred to the local government.\n\nGrounds surrounding the museum contain a secluded fountain, community garden, El Bastión cultural center, and gardens overlooking the water (all free).\n\nCastillo San Felipe del Morro (1539)\n\nEl Morro is a citadel built between 16th and 18th centuries to defend the city, and was named for King Philip II of Spain. Complimented by a smaller fortification known as El Cañuelo on the opposite side of the bay. Roughly 10% of the current structure dates to 1539. Flagpoles fly the US, Puerto Rican and Cross of Burgundy (Spanish flag between 1506 and 1785) flags. Over two million visitors a year.\n\nBy 1555, a small battery with 8 cannons. In 1593, Portuguese soldiers from Lisbon composed the first garrison. In 1595, Sir Francis Drake unsuccessfully attacked by sea. In 1598, the third Earl of Cumberland successfully attacked by land — but was forced to flee by a dysentery epidemic. In 1625, the Dutch attacked by land — managing to sneak by the castle defenses into the harbor, out of reach off the cannons, where they sacked the city but were unable to capture the fort and retreated. Between 1634 and 1650, city walls constructed to make make it “a Defense of the First Order.” In 1797, General Ralph Abercromby and Admiral Henry Harvey attacked with a force of 7,000–13,000 men but were defeated. In 1825, pirate Roberto Cofresí was jailed and later executed within the fort’s walls. In 1843, the first lighthouse in Puerto Rico built.\n\nIn 1898, bombarded by US naval forces — destroying the lighthouse. Renamed Fort Brooke under US Army command, who filled in the esplanade and filled it with baseball diamonds and a golf course! In 1908, Army rebuilt the lighthouse. In 1915, first shots fired by the US in World War I when a German supply ship was fired upon attempting to force its way through the bay to delivery supplies. During World War II, a massive concrete bunker added to the top of El Morro. In 1961, converted to a national park. In 1992, to celebrate the Quincentennial voyage of Columbus the esplanade and lighthouse was restored.\n\nConsidered by the Spanish crown as the “Key to the Antilles”; no enemy ship could navigate its waters without fear of capture. Annual artisans festival every July. Featured in the film Amistad.\n\nLa Fortaleza* (1540)\n\nThe Fortress was built as Santa Catalina’s Palace and is currently the official residence of the Governor — oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas. The first defensive fortification built for the city of San Juan. Features Homage Tower (where governors would take oaths of fidelity to the King and Queen), Austral Tower, formal living quarters, private quarters, gardens and swimming pool.\n\nIn 1598, captured by the Earl of Cumberland. In 1625, captured by Balduino Enrico — who set it ablaze when he left. During the 1640 reconstruction, the chapel of Santa Catalina, which originally stood outside the walls, was integrated into the walls of the structure, resulting in the alternate name Santa Catalina’s Castle. In 1846, reconstruction to a palatial facade. In 1950, the San Juan Nationalist revolt resulted in a five-minute shootout killing four Nationalists and injuring three guards. In 2004, a 2½ hour knife hostage standoff ended when the governor entered the building to listen to the attacker read a letter. In 2019, Telegramgate protests led to the resignation of the governor.\n\nAccording to legend, just before the US invaded during the Spanish–American War, the last Spanish governor of the island struck a longcase clock in La Fortaleza with his sword, stopping the clock and marking the time at which Spain lost control over Puerto Rico!\n\nNotable guests include President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy, King Juan Carlos of Spain, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, President Barack Obama. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain. Featured in the novel United States of Banana.\n\nMetropolitan Cathedral Basilica of Saint John the Baptist (1540)\n\nOne of the oldest buildings in San Juan, the oldest cathedral in the US, and second-oldest cathedral in the Americas. Built on the location of the first school in Puerto Rico, it is undergoing restoration for its 500th anniversary in 2021.\n\nThe original wood structure was destroyed by a hurricane and replaced with the current structure in 1540, with changes up until 1917. Contains the tomb Juan Ponce de León, a shrine to Carlos Manuel Rodríguez Santiago, the first Puerto Rican and first Caribbean-born person to be canonized.\n\nFortín San Juan de la Cruz (1630s)\n\nFort Saint John of the Cross, known locally as El Cañuelo, are the ruins of the smallest San Juan fort built on Isla de Cabras (Goat Island). The sandstone walls date back to the 1630s.\n\nThe original fort built on this site in the late 1500s was made of wood and burned to the ground in 1625 during a Dutch attack. However, the Spaniards replaced it with a stone fort between 1630 and 1660. Although the U.S. Navy bombarded the fort in 1898, the fort survived.\n\nIt is said that, at one time, there was a huge chain crossing from El Morro to El Cañuelo that was extended during attacks to provide a physical barricade across the bay entrance. No entry, but you can walk around it.\n\nSan José Church* (1735)\n\nConstructed from 1532 to 1735 as the Saint Aquinas monastery and renamed in 1865. In 1972, a 15th-century painting Our Lady of Bethlehem disappeared. In 2002, several murals were discovered during restoration. In 2018, restoration.\n\nJuan Ponce de León, the first governor of Puerto Rico, was buried in the crypt of the church from 1559 to 1836, when his remains were exhumed and later transferred to the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista; but his coat of arms is still located near the main altar. Juan Ponce de Leon II (grandson) and painter José Campeche are buried in the crypt.\n\nCapilla del Santo Cristo de la Salud (1780)\n\nThe Chapel of Christ is a small chapel and museum.

Only open Tuesdays.\n\nCastillo San Cristóbal (1783)\n\nThe largest (27 acres) fortification built by the Spanish in the New World that partly encircled the city of San Juan and sealed by double gates. In 1897, a third was demolished to allow better traffic flow.\n\nMost of the fortified walls have guerites (sentry boxes, “garitas” to the locals) — with one built in 1634 called “The Devil’s Guerite” (“La Garita del Diablo”) after a soldier disappearing (fled with his girlfriend), which is inaccessible to the public. Five water storage cisterns were used as bomb shelters during World War II.\n\nFortín de San Gerónimo* (1791)\n\nBuilt to replace the smaller battery of El Boquerón, used by the Spanish to defend the city from attacks by Sir Francis Drake in 1595 and George Clifford, the third Earl of Cumberland in 1598, who managed to destroy it during his attack.\n\nUnlike similar forts, it’s owned by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture but is managed by the Caribe Hilton. Occasionally used for private gatherings, but has fallen into disrepair and visitors are no longer allowed. The gunpowder house built in 1769 is now part of the nearby Luis Muñoz Rivera Park.\n\nIn 2007, site of a protest to allow public access. In 2018, a non-profit association created to preserve and reopen the fort.\n\nLa Mallorquina* (1848)\n\nClaimed to be the first restaurant in Puerto Rico and named after Palma de Mallorca in Spain.

The second floor features the Museo de las Américas, which contains works of Indian, African and Popular Arts.\n\nSanta María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery (1863)\n\nColonial-era cemetery located outside the walls of Fort San Felipe del Morro fortress to overlook the ocean to symbolize the spirit’s journey to the afterlife. Holds many of the most prominent natives and residents.\n\nRon del Barrilito (1880)\n\nOldest surviving Puerto Rican rum distillery continuously operated by the Fernández family. On the site of the 1787 Hacienda Santa Ana, a sugarcane plantation. Third-generation Pedro Fernández started producing rum for personal use after studying engineering in France, but it was so popular that people began asking for “rum from the small barrel” (ron del barrilito in Spanish). The star-based denomination was borrowed from French brandy making.\n\nIn 1880, started producing “Three Stars” rum (aged 6–10 years). In 1920, produced “medicinal” alcohol to continue producing during Prohibition. In 1933, released the younger “Two Stars” rum (3–5 years). In 2018, released “Five Stars” (up to 35 years). In 2019, to celebrate the new visitor’s center (incorporating wood from the previous structure destroyed by Hurricane Maria) released “Four Stars” (up to 20 years); only available on-site and you can pour and seal your own bottle!\n\nHome to some of the oldest aging rum stocks in the Caribbean (“La Doña” aging since at least 1952 and remains unopened). Aged in Spanish sherry (oloroso) oak barrels, the rum formula is a closely guarded family secret.

Tours available, bar open to the public.\n\nOur Lady of Lourdes Chapel (1908)\n\nGothic church with Celtic cross and four gargoyles that serve as a drainage for rain water. Restored various times between 1982 to 1993 — including the 24 Jesus and the Children and the Holy Spirit stained-glass windows. The furniture and the doors are mahogany, while the bell was built in Spain.\n\nPlaza del Mercado (1909)\n\nFarmers’ market surrounded by bars and restaurants within Placita de Santurce. Market location founded over 100 years ago, with current vendors selling a limited range of produce (including cigars and medicinal herbs). One of the most popular nightlife areas in San Juan.\n\nCondado Vanderbilt Hotel (1919)\n\nThe same design firm as Grand Central and built by the Vanderbilt family for $1 million ($15.7 today) and it marked the beginning of high end tourism in Puerto Rico. The original roofing featured antique Spanish tiles sourced from older buildings. Activities included golf, tennis, motoring and gambling (first hotel with a casino).\n\nSold and renamed the Condado Hotel in 1930, then the Condado Beach Hotel in the 1950s. In the 1970s, saved from demolition by an executive order from the governor, joined with the La Concha Hotel (1958, La Perla* seashell event space) and owned by the state before closing in 1997. Vacant until 2002, severed from the La Concha, then renovated for ten years (two years longer than planned) at a cost of $270 million!

The domed lobby was constructed in 1961.\n\nCasa Bacardi (1936)\n\nLargest rum distillery in the world — producing more than 100,000 liters every 24 hours — nearly 85% of Bacardi’s total rum production. Established in 1862 in Cuba, it shifted production to Puerto Rico after Prohibition to sell its rum tariff-free in the US.\n\nTour focused on drinking rather than seeing the factory. Beware expensive Uber rides there, and lack of rides back!\n\nHiram Bithorn Stadium* (1963)\n\nBaseball stadium and home to the Santurce Crabbers and named after the first Puerto Rican to play in the major leagues. The Cangrejeros are the “NY Yankees of Puerto Rico” with 12 titles and most games won — including famed 1954–55 team nicknamed “Panic Squad” that included Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays.\n\nIn 1972, hosted the first outdoor NBA game between the Suns and Bucks. In 2001, hosted the MLB Opening Day Game (4,000 ticket holders had to be turned away due to capacity!). Hosted part of the World Baseball Classic in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

Named after the Spanish for the Taíno word for “small island” and nicknamed Isla Nena (“Little Girl Island”) alluding to its perception as Puerto Rico’s little sister. During the colonial period, the British name was Crab Island.\n\nInhabited by Native Americans over many centuries, with the Saladoid (or Igneri) people arriving in the region perhaps around 200 BC. These tribes, noted for their pottery, stone carving, and other artifacts, eventually merged with groups from Hispaniola and Cuba to form what is now called the Taíno culture. This culture flourished in the region from around 1000 AD until the arrival of Europeans who sent armed forces and decimated the population (either killed, imprisoned or enslaved). Remained a lawless outpost frequented by pirates for 300 years. Attempts by the French, English and Danish to colonize the island in the 17th and 18th centuries were repulsed by the Spanish.\n\nIn 1811, settlement began with large plantations. In 1854, formally annexed to Puerto Rico. In 1816, was briefly visited by Simón Bolívar when his ship ran aground there while fleeing defeat in Venezuela. During the latter 19th century, thousands of black immigrants to work the plantations.\n\nScotland made numerous attempts to buy the island proved unsuccessful, so in 1698 landed and took short-lived possession of the island island; a Danish ship arrived shortly afterward and claimed the island. From 1689 to 1693 the island was controlled by Brandenburg-Prussia as the “Isle of Crabs.”\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the sugar industry declined due to falling prices and industrial unrest forcing many move to move elsewhere. In 1941, the US Navy purchased or seized about two thirds of the island for a base to be a safe haven for the British fleet should they fall to Nazi Germany. After the war, the US Navy continued to use the island for military exercises, and as a firing range and testing ground for munitions.\n\nIn 1999, the death of a Navy employee killed by a misfired bomb triggered international mass protests to end military exercises — culminating in the Navy withdrawing in 2003. Currently a wildlife refuge, but some parts are off-limits due to contamination and/or unexploded ordnance.\n\nSome of the most beautiful beaches on the island are on the eastern end of the island (formerly the Marine Base) that the Navy named Red Beach, Blue Beach, etc., now called Playa Caracas, Pata Prieta, Playa La Chiva, and Playa Plata. At the far western tip (formerly the Navy Base) is Punta Arenas, which the Navy named Green Beach. The beaches are commonly listed among the top beaches in the Caribbean for their azure waters and white sands. The island features several eerily abandoned WWII bunkers you can visit!\n\nIn the years following Hurricane Maria, the hospital remained closed and expectant mothers had to travel to the main island of Puerto Rico to give birth!\n\nMosquito Bay*\n\nAlso the “The Bio Bay” it was declared the “brightest bioluminescent bay” in the world by Guinness World Records in 2006. The Spanish believed that the bioluminescence they encountered there while first exploring the area was the work of the devil and tried to block ocean water from entering the bay by dropping huge boulders in the channel!
