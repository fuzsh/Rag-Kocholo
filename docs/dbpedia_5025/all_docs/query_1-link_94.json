        "text": "01 of 12\n\nDominic Purcell (Lincoln Burrows)\n\nBefore Prison Break, Dominic Purcell was already a veteran of screens big and small. He appeared in the film Equilibrium (2002), played none other than Dracula in Blade: Trinity (2004), and portrayed the titular protagonist on the short-lived television series John Doe. But Prison Break is undoubtedly the show that made him a major star as Lincoln Burrows, who is falsely accused of killing the president's brother. And this character archetype — a man with a gruff exterior but a good heart — would become a throughline for his career.\n\nPurcell likely didn't know what a life-changing opportunity starring on Prison Break would be, but he knew the series was telling an epic tale from the beginning. Looking back to his earliest time on the show, Purcell is effusive in his praise, telling EW that \"the first season of Prison Break, in my opinion, was just classic, beautiful storytelling.\" He's also sorry that the series had to come to an end, saying, \"I'd do years of Prison Break. I love the show so much.\"\n\nAfter Prison Break began, the actor went on to appear on some high-profile shows like The Flash and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. He also starred in some action films, including Killer Elite (2011) and Assault on Wall Street (2013).\n\nHe will soon lead the movie Cassino in Ischia, playing the title character who is hoping to boost his career by working with an ambitious Italian director.\n\nPurcell was married to Rebecca Williamson from 1998 to 2008. They share four children. In 2023, the actor married Tish Cyrus, Miley Cyrus' mother.\n\n02 of 12\n\nWentworth Miller (Michael Scofield)\n\nOn Prison Break, Wentworth Miller plays Lincoln Burrow's brother, and that only seemed appropriate. After all, Miller and Dominic Purcell had a similar trajectory as actors. Earlier in his career, Miller played smaller roles on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and in the 2003 film Underworld, but it was Prison Break that really put him on the map. In fact, Miller would go on to earn a Golden Globe nomination for his stunning performance.\n\nThough many fans could never imagine Prison Break without Miller, that was almost the case. In a 2006 interview with EW, Miller revealed that his would-be big breaks fizzled rather than sizzled. He hoped starring as a younger version of Anthony Hopkins in The Human Stain (2003) would put him on the map, but it instead led to almost two years of no job offers.\n\n\"It was like I stepped off the pavement and into the desert,\" he said. \"As rocky as that road was, I learned a lot about endurance and patience and discipline.\" Fortunately, he landed a last-minute audition for Prison Break, and from there, a hot new career was born.\n\nAfter Prison Break ended in 2009, Miller wrote and produced the 2013 film Stoker. He also made a splash appearing on The Flash as an ice-themed villain, a role that he reprised for the spinoff series DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Additionally, he played a prominent role in season 6 of Madam Secretary and made a few guest spots (as different characters) on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.\n\nMiller came out as gay in 2013 by declining an invitation to a Russian film festival. “As a gay man, I must decline,” he wrote in a statement. “I am deeply troubled by the current attitude toward and treatment of gay men and women by the Russian government.\n\nEventually, he took things a step further and declared he was no longer interested in playing any straight roles, even if that meant skipping out on a sixth season of Prison Break. In 2021, Miller revealed that he was diagnosed with autism.\n\n03 of 12\n\nRobin Tunney (Veronica Donovan)\n\nIn her own way, Robin Tunney arguably had a more impressive résumé going into Prison Break than many of her costars. Like Dominic Purcell and Wentworth Miller, she had starred in a smattering of television and film roles, including those in some of the most influential teen films of the '90s like Encino Man (1990), Empire Records (1995), and The Craft (1996). She also appeared in End of Days (1999) and Vertical Limit (2000). These formative early experiences certainly helped her bring her Prison Break character (Lincoln's childhood friend and current lawyer) to such vivid life.\n\nIt may have been Tunney's early career heights that helped her recognize how special the series was. In a 2006 interview with IGN, she explained, \"It's a pleasure to go to work and I feel really blessed about that... It's not derivative. You can make the comparison to 24, but it's not derivative of anything else.\" She took this as a point of pride, especially because Hollywood is so often guilty of not giving \"anything original\" the time of day.\n\nThough Tunney only appeared in the first two seasons of Prison Break, it still proved she could hold her own on big-budget ensemble series. She soon starred as Teresa Lisbon in all seven seasons of The Mentalist. Later, she had prominent roles in a handful of movies as well as television series like The Fix and Dear Edward.\n\nTunney married film producer Bob Gosse in 1997, but they divorced in 2006. Later, she got engaged to Nicky Marmet, and they have had two children together.\n\n04 of 12\n\nAmaury Nolasco (Fernando Sucre)\n\nOn Prison Break, veteran character actor Amaury Nolasco plays Fernando Sucre, a close friend of Michael's who fervently dreams of leaving Fox River Penitentiary and reuniting with his fiancée.\n\nIn the years leading up to Prison Break, Nolasco had a fairly eclectic career. He primarily acted on TV, and while he popped up on shows like Arli$$ and Early Edition, his main focus at the time was police procedurals. He made small appearances on shows like New York Undercover and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation in between minor film roles (the biggest of which was 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious). While filming Prison Break, Nolasco appeared in the first of Michael Bay's hit Transformers films (2007), followed by Street Kings in 2008 and A Good Day to Die Hard in 2013.\n\nIn an interview with PEOPLE ahead of Prison Break’s second season, Nalasco talked about how fun it was to film in Texas. \"I'm riding horses. It's Texas! You need to do those things.\" However, some aspects were harder to adapt to than others. Originally, he shrugged off warnings about the Texas heat under the assumption that his upbringing in Puerto Rico adequately prepared him. Sadly, it did not: \"Honey, it's something I've never experienced before. 115 (degrees)? 112? What is this?\" he said. \"It's unbearable. And the humidity?\"\n\nThe actor eventually left that sweltering heat, and it was his career that kept things hot from there. After Prison Break initially ended in 2009, he went on to land recurring roles on shows like Rizzoli & Isles, Deception, and Hightown. He's since reprised the role of Fernando Sucre in the 2009 TV movie Prison Break: The Final Break and the 2017 revival season.\n\nHe is slated to appear in Lights Out (about a soldier who begins a new life as an underground fighter) and on the Apple TV+ miniseries Land of Women (about a woman who has to leave town in disgrace with her mother and daughter following her husband’s disastrous financial decisions).\n\n05 of 12\n\nMarshall Allman (L.J. Burrows)\n\nBefore Prison Break, Marshall Allman made a few appearances in a handful of projects, including Little Black Book (2004), Hostage (2005), Boston Public, Malcolm in the Middle, and The Practice. Prison Break provided him with a breakout (so to speak) role as Lincoln Burrow's son, and this became the kind of acting opportunity Allman wouldn't soon forget.\n\nWith a bit of self-deprecating humor, Allman told Starry Constellation Magazine why he took the role on Prison Break: \"It is the only project that I got hired for.\" The young actor also saw this as a great learning opportunity, saying, \"I'm getting to do real acting with other actors who want to act and be real strong... I'm just enjoying the ride because it's honestly so cool.\"\n\nAllman went on to star in Blue Like Jazz (2012) and guest-starred on Justified, Longmire, Bates Motel, and so much more. Outside of Prison Break, he's best known for playing Tommy Mickens on True Blood.\n\nOffscreen, Allman's busy career still left him time to start a family. He married actress Jamie Anne Brown in 2006, and the two have three children together.\n\n06 of 12\n\nSarah Wayne Callies (Sara Tancredi)\n\nIn the years leading up to Prison Break's premiere, Sarah Wayne Callies appeared in a few episodes of Queens Supreme and had a prominent role on the short-lived WB Tarzan series. Other than that, she had only made a few guest appearances on shows like Law & Order: SVU before Prison Break. Her role as Sara, a sympathetic doctor who aids the escape, led to plenty of other opportunities.\n\n\"Prison Break was my first real job,\" Callies told EW. \"I had only been in the business a couple of years.\" As for returning for the show's 2017 revival, she was motivated by a desire to once again work with Prison Break creator Paul Scheuring. \"A huge part of wanting to come back was that Paul was the brain behind it, and this was always Paul's baby.\"\n\nDuring the Prison Break hiatus, Callies began getting beefier roles in more prominent shows, including The Walking Dead, on which she played Lori Grimes, wife to the brooding sheriff Rick Grimes. She also had major roles on series like Colony, Council of Dads, The Company You Keep, and more. In 2014, she starred in Into the Storm alongside Richard Armitage and Matt Walsh. Her next project is the spooky anthology tale Valara.\n\nCallies has two children with her husband Josh Winterhalt, whom she married in 2002.\n\n07 of 12\n\nRockmond Dunbar (Benjamin Miles Franklin)\n\nRockmond Dunbar, who plays Benjamin Miles Franklin (a fellow prisoner who gets in over his head when blackmailing Michael), had a bit more acting experience than some of his peers when Prison Break started in 2005. He previously had major roles on shows like Earth 2 and Soul Food while also appearing on The Practice and Felicity. But, like his costars, Dunbar's career got a major boost from his time on Prison Break.\n\nIn a 2017 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he spoke about appreciating the complexities of the show. \"You always have those twists and turns in Prison Break. How are they going to get out of this? How are they going to get out of that?\" he recalled. \"You turn the corner, and it's a sunny and beautiful day — and then it's absolute hell. How are they going to get out of this hell?\"\n\nSince the series began, \"hell\" is the last word we'd use to describe Dunbar’s career. His most prominent role since then has been on Sons of Anarchy, and he has also appeared extensively on The Mentalist, The Game, and 9-1-1. Filmwise, Dunbar notably appeared in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), The Family That Preys (2008), directed and acted in Pastor Brown (2009), and will be in Coke Daniels' The Waterboyz.\n\nAs for his personal life, Rockmond Dunbar married Ivy Holmes in 2003, but they got divorced three years later. In 2013, he married actress Maya Gilbert, and the two are now raising four children together.\n\n08 of 12\n\nRobert Knepper (Theodore Bagwell)\n\nRobert Knepper's Hollywood career stretches back to the '80s, and he quickly established himself as a skilled character actor thanks to roles in shows like Star Trek: The Next Generation and Law & Order. He eventually made more prominent appearances on shows like Thieves and Carnivàle, and delighted with appearances in movies like Young Guns II (1990), but Prison Break helped kick his career into high gear. On that show, he plays Theodore \"T-Bag\" Bagwell, the kind of menacing inmate who always threatens to undermine the protagonists.\n\nTo hear Knepper tell it, this is the kind of role he was born to play. In a 2005 interview with EW, he mentioned how he was surprised that fans didn't just outright hate Bagwell. \"People looove to hate me,\" he said. \"I never play him like a stereotypical racist or redneck. He's actually quite cunning and smart.\"\n\nAfter Prison Break, Knepper got bigger roles in increasingly ambitious projects. He appeared in the final season of Heroes and played a recurring character on iZombie. He also popped up on the Twin Peaks revival and in action films like Hitman (2007), Transporter 3 (2008), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1 (2014) and Part 2 (2015), and Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016). His upcoming projects include the film The Lost Princess (a fantastical story set in a haunted castle) and the series Paper Empire (on which one man's greed threatens the world with a financial apocalypse).\n\nIn 2017, a costume designer accused Knepper of sexual assault during production of the 1992 film Gas Food Lodging, although the actor denied any wrongdoing. Further sexual assault allegations were leveled against the actor later that same year.\n\n09 of 12\n\nWade Williams (Brad Bellick)\n\nSpeaking of Prison Break characters that fans love to hate, Wade Williams is Brad Bellick, a corrupt security guard at the penitentiary. Before landing that show, Williams was known as a character actor who could always make his appearances shine. Accordingly, he enjoyed brief arcs on shows like NYPD Blue and ER, a recurring role on The Bernie Mac Show, and parts in movies like Ken Park (2002). As with many of his costars, though, the sheer popularity of Prison Break helped him achieve career success like never before.\n\nWilliams has mastered the art of keeping his head down and getting the job done. In a 2006 interview with the Chicago Tribune before season 2, he was asked about the challenges of moving the shooting location from Chicago to Texas. While he said he would miss the Windy City, the actor was unphased: \"My mantra is, it's nice to have a gig.\"\n\nSince he started portraying Brad on Prison Break, things have been quite \"nice\" for Williams due to an abundance of jobs. He has since made appearances on shows like Criminal Minds, Bones, and Longmire, and he had a more extensive part on Mercy Street. He had a minor role in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and has lent his voice to numerous DC animated productions, including movies like Superman: Unbound and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 (2012). Williams was also in the 2013 crime-action film Gangster Squad alongside Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, and Emma Stone.\n\nWilliams appeared in the film The Last Manhunt (2022) and starred in Male Mail, a short film about a miserable man receiving strange instructions from none other than Pinocchio.\n\n10 of 12\n\nPaul Adelstein (Paul Kellerman)\n\nPaul Adelstein had a growing body of diverse roles going into Prison Break. Before getting cast as a Secret Service agent sent to witness Lincoln Burrows' execution, Adelstein had major parts in relatively obscure shows like Turks, Cupid, and Hack. He had occasional film roles in movies such as My Best Friend’s Wedding (1997), Bedazzled (2000), and Intolerable Cruelty (2003), but it was Prison Break that gave his career a major boost.\n\nThis is somewhat ironic because, as Adelstein told The New York Times in 2007, his initial audition went poorly, mostly because he was auditioning for the role of Burrows. After giving an overly mournful line delivery for that character, Adelstein ended up reading for Kellerman because he's \"more of a character guy.\" The vulnerability felt out of place in Lincoln Burrows was perfect for Paul Kellerman, and he ended up getting the part.\n\nAfter Prison Break became a mainstream hit, Adelstein got a long-running role on Private Practice, the show for which he is arguably best known. In 2009, he voiced an astronaut in the Will Ferrell film Land of the Lost. He would later land roles on shows like Scandal, Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce, and Chicago P.D., all while making appearances in movies like 2022's The Menu. He will soon be in the TV movie thriller The President Is Missing.\n\nAdelstein married actress Liza Weil in 2006. They had one child together before divorcing in 2017.\n\n11 of 12\n\nWilliam Fichtner (Alexander Mahone)\n\nWilliam Fichtner always seems to land very intense roles. On Prison Break, for example, he plays the relentless FBI agent Alexander Mahone who is tasked with hunting the main characters down. Despite previously making appearances on shows like As the World Turns, Grace Under Fire, and MDs, Fichtner was mostly known for playing very cut-throat characters in films like Armageddon (1998), Black Hawk Down (2001), and Crash (2005).\n\nThis kind of résumé is what made his role in Prison Break feel so natural. As he later told EW while looking back on his performance in the show, \"I love playing characters like this — everybody is afraid of me!\"\n\nHe also felt that his character was a large part of the alchemy that helped the show become a success. \"That's what makes Prison Break work — the dysfunctional, twisted folk are so real with their own problems,\" he said. \"That's certainly what attracted me to it.\"\n\nSince his time on Prison Break, Fichtner had major roles on Entourage, Crossing Lines, and Mom, and he continued making appearances in notable films such as The Dark Knight (2008), Drive Angry (2011, Elysium (2013), and even Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014). Fichtner will appear in the postapocalyptic film St. Sebastian and provide the voice of John G. Nicolay (President Lincoln's private secretary) in the historical film The Gettysburg Address.\n\n12 of 12\n\nPeter Stormare (John Abruzzi)\n\nWhen Peter Stormare joined the Prison Break cast as John Abruzzi — the head of the Chicago Mafia — he had already shocked audiences by feeding Steve Buscemi to a woodchipper in Fargo (1996). He also appeared in The Big Lebowski (1998) and big-budget films like The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Armageddon (1998) Minority Report (2002), Bad Boys II (2003), Constantine (2005), and The Brothers Grimm (2005). Still, his time on Prison Break helped him win over a new generation of fans.\n\nWhile people have theorized that the veteran character actor disliked his time on the show, Stormare has rarely commented on the matter. And when he does so, it's rather oblique. During a Reddit AMA, a fan asked what his favorite Prison Break filming memory was. Stormare responded, \"The final day, when I was shot and killed.\"\n\nWhether he loved or hated his time on Prison Break, it led to more prominent projects. He later nabbed roles on shows like The Blacklist, Black Widows, Longmire, and American Gods, all while appearing in big films like John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017). He also became a prolific voice actor, lending his talents to series such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Castlevania as well as to video games like Destiny 2: The Witch Queen. He will be reprising his fan-favorite Lucifer character for the sequel Constantine 2.\n\nIn his personal life, Stormare married actress Karen Sillas in 1989. They had one child and later divorced in 2006. The actor got married again in 2008 to Toshimi Stormare."
