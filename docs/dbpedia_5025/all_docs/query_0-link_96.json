        "text": "Halloween Is a Huge Sports Day for Me\n\nIn 2009, Halloween fell on a Saturday. So it was a full day, including a full day of sports.\n\n8:45 AM: Go to Nevada Smith's in New York and watch the North London Derby, Arsenal vs. Tottenham, at Arsenal's ground, Ashburton Grove (a.k.a. Emirates Stadium) in North Lonrdon. Two teams that really don't like each other, and 2 sets of fans who really hate each other's guts.\n\nArsenal 3, Tottenham 0. Two goals from Robin van Persie, one from Cesc Fabregas within a minute of RVP's first, and a clean sheet from the back four and the returning Manuel Almunia who made some sensational saves. Spurs were completely shut down and embarrassed, as well they deserve to be.\n\nThree-nil! We beat The Scum, three-nil! We beat The Scum, three-nil! We beat The Scum, three-nil!\n\n12:00 PM: Rutgers vs. Connecticut, at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, get back to East Brunswick to watch on TV. Didn't see most of it. Only saw the 4th quarter, with RU blowing the last 4 points of an 11-point 4th quarter lead. UConn was going to win the game. There were only 22 seconds left on the clock.\n\nAnd Tom Savage threw a fantastic pass to Tim Brown, who sped off across lots of green real estate and took it to the house. Rutgers 28, Connecticut 24.\n\nA spectacular victory for the Scarlet Knights, and finally their 1st Big East win of the season. A devastating loss for UConn, which has now lost 2 straight (the first to West Virginia) since the murder of teammate Jasper Howard -- who just so happened to be a high school teammate of the aforementioned RU hero Tim Brown. Howard's Number 6 was everywhere, including on stickers on both teams' helmets.\n\n3:00 PM: New Jersey Devils vs. Tampa Bay Lightning, in Tampa at whatever corporate name they're calling their arena. Travis Zajac scored in regulation for the Devils. Martin Brodeur stopped 18 shots, but had his bid to tie Terry Sawchuk's NHL shutout record of 103 end just under 5 minutes into the 3rd period.\n\nThe only goal scored by either team in the shooutout was by David Clarkson. Devils 2, Lightning 1. While they're just 1-4 at home, the Devils are 7-0 on the road, tying for 2nd-best in NHL history and trailing only the 2006-07 Buffalo Sabres, who won their first 10 road games.\n\n7:00 PM: New Jersey Nets vs. Washington Wizards, at the Verizon Center in Washington, D.C. Formerly known, respectively, as the New Jersey Americans and the New York Nets; vs. the Chicago Packers, the Chicago Zephyrs, the Baltimore Bullets, the Capital Bullets and the Washington Bullets; and the MCI Center; at Georgetown, Maryland.\n\nAnd the Nets will likely be moved to Brooklyn and either be called the Brooklyn Nets or go back to the old New York Nets name. They were better with that name anyway, as the Wiz made them disappear. Wizards 123, Nets 104. I know the Wiz are a much better team with a healthy Gilbert Arenas, but for the last 3 seasons and change, since winning the Atlantic Division in 2006, the Nets haven’t even been trying.\n\n7:57 PM: First pitch of Game 3 of the World Series, Yankees vs. Phillies, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. (Well, scheduled for that time. It's currently in a rain delay.) After the 1st half of Arsenal-Spurs, my voice was shot and my ears were ringing. (The sound really carries at Nevada's.) I was sure I wouldn't have any voice left. My voice has recovered.\n\nI sure hope Andy Pettitte bucks his postseason trend of one good start, one bad start, one good start, one bad start. He's due for the one bad start. With his opposite number, Cole Hamels, having been a bit supbar this season as opposed to last (when he was Series MVP after a great regular season), we need Number 46 to come through.\n\nNevada's is on 3rd Avenue between 11th and 12th Streets. That puts it in the East Village. There, as in all of Greenwich Village, in New York in general but especially in the Village, where the famed Halloween Parade is currently underway, Halloween is often redundant.\n\nI was in New York last Halloween, following watching East Brunswick beat New Brunswick. (EBHS was not scheduled to play this week, which is why I haven't mentioned them until now.) Since The Dark Knight was still recent, I saw 3 Batmen, 4 Jokers, and a Catwoman.\n\nI also saw a Superman riding a bicycle. What does Superman need with a bike? He can fly!\n\nAbout that Catwoman: I saw her on the Subway. This costume was all rubber and unbelievably tight. And to make matters worse, she... was a he. I firmly believe in condemning bigotry wherever it may be, but this was the gayest sight I have ever seen.\n\n*\n\nLast full day of \"This Day In History,\" as October is over. Wait, how can October be over, if the World Series is still being played? Curse you, Seligula!\n\nOctober 31, 1887: Edouard Charles Lalonde is born. \"Newsy\" (from working in a newspaper plant) was one of early hockey's greatest stars, winning 7 scoring titles and Captaining the Montreal Canadiens to their 1st Stanley Cup in 1916.\n\nOn December 29, 1917, in the 1st-ever NHL game, he scored a goal on route to the Canadiens' 7-4 victory over the Ottawa Senators. In 1922, the Canadiens angered him and a lot of their fans by trading him to the Pacific Coast Hockey Association's Saskatoon Sheiks, but the Habs got future Hall-of-Famer Aurel Joliat in the deal.\n\nFrom his retirement in 1927 until Maurice Richard surpassed him in 1954, his 455 goals in all leagues in which he played combined stood as a pro record. He was also the best lacrosse player of his era, and in 1950, he was named athlete of the half century in lacrosse. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950, the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame in 1965, and the Sports Hall of Fame of Canada. He had lit the torch when the Sports Hall of Fame opened in Toronto in August, 1955.\n\nIn 1998 he was ranked number 32 on The Hockey News' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players, making him the highest-ranking player on the list who had played in a professional league before the founding of the NHL. He was the 1st Canadiens player to wear Number 4, and Joliat got it after the trade, but it was retired for later star Jean Beliveau.\n\nOctober 31, 1933: Phil Goyette is born. The center won Stanley Cups with the Montreal Canadiens in 1957, '58, '59 and '60. He was the first coach of the New York Islanders in 1972-73, but was fired due to a poor record midway through the season.\n\nOctober 31, 1942: Dave McNally is born. He pitched a complete game to clinch the 1966 World Series for the Baltimore Orioles, and won another game and hit a grand slam in it to help them win it in 1970. His career won-lost record was a sterling 184-119.\n\nBut he's best known as one of the two pitchers, along with Andy Messersmith, who played the 1975 season without a contract to test the legality of the reserve clause. McNally, by then with the Montreal Expos, had been injured, had a successful ranch in his native Montana, and was ready to retire anyway, so he was an ideal player to make the test, since he didn't need the money. The clause was overturned.\n\nAlso on this day, David Ogden Stiers is born. Best known as Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, the pompous but sometimes surprisingly human surgeon on M*A*S*H, he has spent much of the last few years doing voiceovers for PBS documentaries – in his real voice, not in Charles' Boston Brahmin accent.\n\nOctober 31, 1943: Brian Piccolo is born. The All-American running back from Wake Forest overcame his natural prejudice to help Chicago Bears teammate Gale Sayers come back from a devastating knee injury, then developed lung cancer at died at age 26.\n\nShortly before Piccolo's death, Sayers was given the NFL's most courageous man award for winning the 1969 rushing title on a knee with no cartilage in it. At the award ceremony, he said he didn't deserve the award, because Piccolo was showing more courage. \"I love Brian Piccolo,\" he said, \"and tonight, when you get down on your knees to pray, I want you to ask God to love him, too.\"\n\nThe Bears retired Piccolo's Number 41. In the 1971 film Brian's Song, Piccolo was played by James Caan, and Sayers by Billy Dee Williams, career-making roles for both men.\n\nOctober 31, 1946: Stephen Rea is born. He starred in The Crying Game and was nominated for an Oscar for it. He's best known in the U.S. as Inspector Eric Finch, a good guy who figures out that he's really working for the bad guys, in V for Vendetta. It was because of that film that he was the only actor besides Colin Firth that I recognized from the original, British soccer, version of Fever Pitch.\n\nOctober 31, 1947: Frank Shorter is born. He won the Olympic marathon in 1972, and finished second in 1976. Thanks to his '72 win, the Boston Marathon was reborn as an event the whole country wanted to watch, and the New York City Marathon, which started the year before, took off.\n\nIt will be run again tomorrow, and nearly 50,000 runners will participate. Along with Jim Fixx and his Book of Running, Shorter is probably more responsible than anyone for the rise of recreational running in America. I leave it to you to decide whether that's a good thing.\n\n*\n\nOctober 31, 1950: John Candy is born. In the closing minutes of Super Bowl XXIII, when the Cincinnati Bengals had just scored to take the lead, the San Francisco 49ers were nervous, when quarterback Joe Montana, pointed out of the huddle to the stands and said, \"Isn't that John Candy?\" The question relaxed the players, and Montana drove them for the winning touchdown.\n\nCandy played the Cubs' broadcaster in Rookie of the Year, and I give him a lot of credit for playing someone similar to, but not a total caricature of, Harry Caray. On the other side of Chicago, he also shot a scene at the old Comiskey Park in its closing days for Only the Lonely.\n\nConsidering his weight, I'm not surprised that he died young (43), but I'm still sorry about it. He gave us a lot, but he had a lot more to give.\n\nAlso on this day, Jane Pauley is born. The longtime co-host of The Today Show on NBC, she is married to Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau.\n\nOctober 31, 1951: Nick Saban is born. The son of legendary coach Lou Saban, he hasn’t yet moved around to as many coaching jobs, but he has moved around with considerably less ethics than his father. He did, however, lead Louisiana State to the 2003 National Championship. He is now trying to do the same with Alabama, currently undefeated.\n\nAlso on this day, Dave Trembley is born. He is, for the moment, the manager of the struggling Baltimore Orioles.\n\nOctober 31, 1953: John Lucas is born. He played both basketball and tennis professionally, and was a member of the Houston Rockets' 1986 NBA Western Conference Champions. His overcoming of drug addiction led him to become an NBA head coach and an addiction counselor. He is currently an assistant coach under Mike Dunleavy of the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nLike Dunleavy, he has a son who played in the NBA, John Lucas III, who, unlike his father whose 1974 Maryland team was prevented under the rules of the time from playing in the NCAA Tournament due to its loss in the ACC Final, went to the 2004 Final Four with Oklahoma State. John III played in the NBA with the Rockets, was recently waived by the Miami Heat and is currently a free agent. Another son, Jai Lucas, now plays at the University of Texas.\n\nOctober 31, 1959, 50 years ago today: Mats Naslund is born. The left wing was known as Le Petit Viking (the Little Viking) when he played for the Montreal Canadiens, a tenure that included the 1986 Stanley Cup, in which he became the most recent Canadien to score 100 or more points in a season. He helped Sweden win the 1994 Olympic Gold Medal, and as general manager of the team he built their 2006 Gold Medal team.\n\n*\n\nOctober 31, 1960: Mike Gallego is born. He was the starting 2nd baseman on the Oakland Athletics' 3 straight Pennants of 1988-90. In 1993, he was voted the 2nd baseman on their 25th Anniversary team (25 years since they'd moved to Oakland). He briefly played for the Yankees in the early 1990s, and is now back with the A's as a coach.\n\nAlso on this day, Reza Pahlavi is born. He was 18 years old and the Crown Prince of Iran when his father, the Emperor, Mohammed Reza Shah, was overthrown in the Islamic Revolution of 1979. Luckily for him, he was already in the U.S., training as a fighter pilot (much as was his cousin and fellow heir to a throne, now King Abdullah II of Jordan).\n\nHe now lives in Potomac, Maryland, outside Washington. Unlike his father, who ran a brutally repressive, unofficially fascist regime, he has been an outspoken supporter of human rights, saying that in order to bring freedom to his homeland, \"Idealism and realism, behavior change and regime change do not require different policies but the same: Empowering the Iranian people.\"\n\nHis supporters have referred to him as \"His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah II\" since his father's death on July 27, 1980, but he officially calls himself \"the former Crown Prince,\" and admits he has no realistic hope of the monarchy being restored, even when the Ayatollahs are finally and rightfully toppled.\n\nOctober 31, 1961: A federal judge rules that Birmingham‚ Alabama laws against integrated playing fields are illegal‚ eliminating the last barrier against integration in the Class AA Southern Association.\n\nSo the SA team owners vote to fold the league, rather than comply with the law. Bigoted bastards. Many of their teams are started by new owners in other leagues.\n\nOctober 31, 1963: Fred McGriff is born in Tampa. In 1982, the Yankees traded 1st baseman McGriff, young pitcher Mike Morgan and outfielder Dave Collins to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Dale Murray and third baseman Tom Dodd. Dodd did play 1 year in the majors, but for Baltimore, and is not the man for whom the ballpark belonging to the Norwich Navigators, a former Yankee farm team, is named. (That was Senator Thomas Dodd of Connecticut, father of current Senator Chris Dodd.) Murray got hurt and never contributed to the Yankees, either. Collins was pretty much finished.\n\nIn 2001, 19 years later, Morgan pitched against the Yankees in the World Series for the Arizona Diamondbacks, and McGriff was also still active. By trading him, the Yankees essentially traded 493 home runs for nothing.\n\nOr did they? McGriff was 20 at the time, and did not reach the majors for another 4 years. Had he done so with the Yankees, he would have smacked right into Don Mattingly at his peak. The Yankees may not have had anyplace for him.\n\nStill, the trade looks bad. McGriff was involved in some other big trades: The Jays traded him to the San Diego Padres in 1990, a trade which brought them Joe Carter and Roberto Alomar, key figures in their 1992 and '93 World Champions; and the Padres sent him to the Atlanta Braves as part of their 1993 \"fire sale,\" a pure \"salary dump.\"\n\nMcGriff hit the 1st home run at the SkyDome in 1989. With the Jays that season and the Padres in 1982, McGriff became the 1st player in the post-1920 Lively Ball Era to lead both leagues in home runs. He helped the Braves win the World Series in 1995, and later played for his hometown Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\n\nHe now works in the Rays' front office, and as co-host for a show on Bright House Sports Network, a Tampa Bay-based outfit. He will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in its next election, this coming January. Despite falling 7 homers short of the magic 500 Club, he will probably make it, if not in his 1st year of eligibility, then within the 1st couple of years thereafter. He was always popular – ESPN's Chris Berman took the public-service-announcement character of \"McGruff the Crime Dog\" and nicknamed McGriff \"Crime Dog\" – and despite his home-run heroics, he has never been seriously suspected of steroid use. His son Erick McGriff plays football at the University of Kansas.\n\nAlso on this day, Carlos Caetano Bledorn Verri is born in Ijui, Brazil. The soccer player was nicknamed \"Dunga\" by an uncle, Portuguese for \"Dopey,\" since he was short, and was expected to stay that way. But the midfielder starred for several Brazilian teams, with his longest tenure at Internacional (like the Milan club known as \"Inter\" for short) of Porto Alegre; for Fiorentina in Italy and Stuttgart in Germany. Dunga was a member of Brazil's 1994 World Cup winners, and is now the coach of the national team as the 2010 World Cup approaches.\n\nOctober 31, 1964: Marco van Basten is born in Utrecht, the Netherlands. The striker starred for Ajax Amsterdam in his native Netherlands, winning League Championships in 1982, '83 and '85 and the Dutch Cup in '83, '86 and '87 – meaning they won \"The Double\" in 1983. He moved on to AC Milan in Italy, winning Serie A in 1988, '92 and '93, and back-to-back European Cups (now the Champions League) in 1989 and '90. He led the Netherlands to the European Championship in 1988, the country's only major trophy.\n\nThree times he was named European Player of the Year, and the magazine France Football placed him 8th in a poll of the Football Players of the Century. He has managed both Ajax and the Netherlands national team.\n\nOctober 31, 1966: Mike O'Malley is born in Boston. The comedian and actor, formerly star of Yes, Dear, is a tremendous Boston Red Sox fan. But he's funny, so I forgive him.\n\nOctober 31, 1968: Antonio Davis is born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. After going undrafted out of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), he played pro basketball in Athens and Milan before signing with the Indiana Pacers. He was an All-Star for the perennial Playoff contenders and Knick nemeses, although they didn’t reach the NBA Finals until after he left.\n\nOctober 31, 1970: Steve Trachsel is born in Oxnard, California. In 1996, the Chicago Cubs pitcher was named to the All-Star Team. In 1998,gave up Mark McGwire's steroid-aided 62nd home run, but he also won the Playoff for the NL Wild. Since the Cubs only made the Playoffs 4 times in the 62 seasons between 1945 and 2007, this makes him a Wrigleyville hero for all time.\n\nHe also pitched for the Mets, winning the NL East with them in 2006. He last pitched for the Baltimore Orioles in 2008, but has not officially retired.\n\nOctober 31, 1972: The Philadelphia Phillies trade 3rd baseman Don Money and 2 others to the Milwaukee Brewers for 4 pitchers‚ including Jim Lonborg and Ken Brett.\n\nThis was a rare good trade for both teams: Lonborg was a key cog in the Phillies developing a pitching staff that would reach the Playoffs 6 times in 8 years from 1976 to 1983 (though Lonborg retired after ’78), Money helped stabilize the Brewers and make them a contender by 1978 and a Pennant winner in 1982, and trading him allowed the Phillies to make room for the best player in the history of Philadelphia baseball, Mike Schmidt.\n\nOctober 31, 1973: David Dellucci is born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The outfielder was a member of the Arizona Diamondbacks team that beat the Yankees in the 2001 World Series, and of the Yankee team that won the 2003 American League Pennant. He was released by the Toronto Blue Jays earlier this year and is a free agent.\n\nOctober 31, 1976: José María Gutiérrez Hernández is born. Guti Hernandez (or just \"Guti\") is a midfielder who has starred for Real Madrid as they won Spain’s La Liga in 1997, 2001, '03, '07 and '08; and the Champions League in 1998, 2000 and '02.\n\nOctober 31, 1983: George Halas dies at age 88. He was the founder of the Chicago Bears, for all intents and purposes the founder of the NFL, formerly the winningest coach in NFL history (324), and no coach in the history of professional football has won as many league championships, 8: 1921, 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1963.\n\nOne of his last acts as owner was to hire former Bears star Mike Ditka as head coach, and Ditka would lead them to a 9th World Championship in 1985. When asked by Bob Costas in the locker room afterwards if he thought of \"Papa Bear,\" he said, \"I always think of Coach Halas.\"\n\nThis, despite a reputation for being cheap, which led Ditka to say, \"George Halas throws nickels around like manhole covers.\" It was also Halas' cheapness that kept the Bears in Wrigley Field, with a football capacity of just 47,000, in spite of Soldier Field having over 65,000 seats and lights, because he didn't want to pay the rent the City of Chicago was demanding. The Bears didn't move there until 1971, when the money available to teams on Monday Night Football, which couldn't be played at then-lightless Wrigley, more than offset the cost of the rent. In spite of this, when the aforementioned Brian Piccolo got sick, Halas paid all his medical expenses and for his funeral.\n\nAn NFL Films documentary from 1977, Their Deeds and Dogged Faith, showed Halas walking through the Bears' practice facility at Lake Forest, Illinois (the main building is now named Halas Hall), and announcer John Facenda said it was \"like visiting Mount Vernon and seeing George Washington still surveying the grounds.\"\n\nHe had planned to hand the team over to his son George Jr., but \"Mugs\" predeceased him. His daughter Virginia handed control to her husband, Ed McCaskey. Unfortunately, Big Ed handed a lot of control over to his and Virginia's son, George's grandson, Mike McCaskey, who ran the franchise into the ground before Big Ed took it back and handed it over to someone else prior to his own death. Virginia is still alive and the nominal owner of Da Bears.\n\nOctober 31, 1987: Nick Foligno is born in Buffalo. The center plays for the Ottawa Senators. His brother Marcus Foligno is in the minor-league system of the Buffalo Sabres, for whom their father, Mike Foligno, was an All-Star.\n\nOctober 31, 1998: Elmer Vasko dies at age 62. \"Moose\" was an All-Star defenseman for the Chicago Blackhawks, winning the Stanley Cup with them in 1961.\n\nOctober 31, 2001: Game 4 of the World Series. The Yankees trail the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-1 in the bottom of the 9th, and are about to fall behind in the World Series by the same margin of games. This is due in large part to the fine pitching of Curt Schilling, who was asked about the \"mystique\" of Yankee Stadium. He said, \"Mystique, aura, those are dancers in a nightclub.\" (Three years later, pitching for Boston, he would prove he was still not intimidated by Yankee Stadium, saying, \"There's nothing like making 55,000 Yankee fans shut up.\")\n\nByung-Hyun Kim, a \"submarine\" style pitcher from Korea, tries to close the Yankees out in the bottom of the 9th. But he lets a man on, and Tino Martinez comes to the plate. Tino electrifies the crowd but slamming a drive toward the Bleachers. On the video, a fan in the front row of the upper deck tries to catch the ball, but it bounces off his hand. Now, imagine you're that fan: Are you excited that the Yankees have come back in this World Series game, or are you mad that you were unable to catch this historic homer (and probably hurt your hand in the process)?\n\nAs the clock strikes midnight, for the 1st time ever – due to the week's delay after the 9/11 attacks – a Major League Baseball game is played in the month of November. It is the bottom of the 10th, and Derek Jeter steps to the plate against Kim. A fan holds up a sign saying, \"Mr. November.\" (It’s often been asked, \"How did he know to hold up that sign for Jeter?\" The answer is easy: He didn't hold it up specifically for Jeter. Jeter was just the batter when the clock struck 12, making him the 1st batter for whom it could be held up.)\n\nAt 12:03 came a typical Jeter hit: An inside-out swing to right-center, and it just… barely… got over the fence for a game-winning home run. Yankees 4, Diamondbacks 3. The Series was tied. The old ballyard was shaking. The \"Yankee Mystique\" had struck again. It is hits like this that have gotten Jeter the nickname \"Captain Clutch.\"\n\nThe next night, the 1st game to officially be played in the month of November, a fan made up a sign that said, \"BASEBALL HISTORY MADE HERE\" on what looked like an ancient scroll. Another fan made up a sign that said, \"MYSTIQUE AND AURA APPEARING NIGHTLY.\" (Two years later, in the Aaron Boone Game, that same fan made up one that said, \"MYSTIQUE DON'T FAIL ME NOW.\" It didn't.)\n\nOctober 31, 2002: The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association votes 9-6 to prohibit the use of metal bats in the state high school tournament in 2003. In the State, 25 of their 40 high school sports leagues will switch to wood for the regular season.\n\nMassachusetts is the 1st to outlaw metal bats. In this particular case, they are ahead of the curve in baseball.\n\nWhy Pedro Martinez Is a Loser\n\nPedro Martinez has a career regular-season won-lost record of 219-100. This gives him a .687 winning percentages, 2nd-best all-time behind Whitey Ford among pitchers with at least 200 wins. And he has reached postseason play with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, and would have done so with the Montreal Expos had it not been for the Strike of '94. And, in his 1 career World Series appearance before last night, he was the winning pitcher.\n\nNo matter: Pedro Martinez is a loser.\n\nBecause he's not a team player. It's all about him.\n\nHis pregame press conference before this World Series started has been called a tour de force by the media. Tour de farce is more like it.\n\n\"I don't know if you realize this, but because of you guys,\" he said, meaning the New York media, \"I might be, at times, the most influential player that ever stepped in Yankee Stadium. I can honestly say that.\"\n\nYeah, surrrre. Except for a guy named Babe Ruth.\n\nAnd Lou Gehrig, and Joe DiMaggio, and Mickey Mantle. And Bill Dickey, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, Whitey Ford, Roger Maris, Thurman Munson, Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Goose Gossage, Paul O'Neill, Bernie Williams, David Cone, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera.\n\nOf course, he could be talking about Yankee opponents. Fine, then, you worthless prick, you rank behind John McGraw, Rogers Hornsby, Mickey Cochrane, Stan Musial, Duke Snider, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Roberto Clemente, Frank Robinson, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Johnny Bench, Fernando Valenzuela, Greg Maddux, Ivan Rodriguez, and the three biggest \"Yankee Killers\" of them all, Curt Schilling, Manny Ramirez and David Ortiz.\n\nMost influential opposing player that ever stepped in Yankee Stadium? Have I forgotten anybody? Oh yes: Jackie Robinson.\n\nMaybe he meant just the new Stadium? Still behind his ex-teammates Schill, Manny Being Cheating and Big Cheating Papi.\n\nNo, Pedro, you cannot \"honestly say that.\" Can you honestly say a damn thing?\n\nHe certainly can't say anything honest about his vicious assault on Don Zimmer. And he brought up this disgusting criminal act, not the press:\n\n\"Zim charged me, and I think he's going to say something, but his reaction was totally the opposite. He was trying to punch my mouth and told me a couple of bad words about my mom.\"\n\nAh, the Zinedine Zidane defense. In the 2006 World Cup Final, playing for France, he head-butted Marco Materazzi of Italy, claiming later that Materazzi had called his sister a whore. How'd that work for him?\n\nAt least Zizou was properly thrown out of the game, which led directly to his team's defeat, since he was unable to score a tie-breaking, World Cup-winning goal, and was subsequently unavailable for the penalty kicks that led to Italy's win and France's defeat. (Sorry, Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira. You two deserved better. Maybe even you, William Gallas, though you were Chelsea at the time.)\n\nBy contrast, Pedro was not thrown out of the game, only fined $50,000, and was allowed to make his Game 7 start. And even then, he stayed too long -- but for competitive reasons, not disciplinary ones. (More about that in a moment.)\n\nLook, in Game 5 of the 1998 ALCS in Cleveland, David Wells claimed that the Indian fans were saying nasty things about his mother. Did he go into the stands and charge the fans? No, he got on the mound and sent the Cleveland batters down and won the game. That's what former Jets coach Herman Edwards taught us: Regardless of the sport, \"You play to win the game!\"\n\nSeriously, who believes that Zim was going to punch Pedro in the mouth? If it was me coming at him, he'd have had a case. He deserved it well before that for his thuggishness. He is the only living pitcher, as far as I know, who has ever purposely hit a Yankee with a pitch that ended up sending him to the hospital. And it was two, and it was on back-to-back at-bats in 2003: Alfonso Soriano and Derek Jeter. This guy belongs in Upstate New York, all right, but in Sing Sing or Attica, not Cooperstown.\n\nZim cursing out Pedro's mother? Who believes Zim would do that? Clearly, Pedro's mother didn't teach him not to be a goddamned liar! (I was going to say \"a motherfucking liar,\" but that would go a ways toward proving his point, wouldn't it?)\n\n\"I just had to react and defend myself. But the tweak that it took made me look like a monster.\"\n\nYou just had to react and defend yourself? Then you put your hands up and stop him. Or you grab him by the shoulders and hold him. You don't grab an old man by the head and throw him to the ground! That's a hell of a lot more than a \"tweak.\" It made you look like a monster, Pedro Jaime Martinez, because you are a monster.\n\nAbout getting knocked out by those 4 straight hits in Game 7 of that series, after being left in too long: \"I remember getting back to my dugout and seeing middle fingers.\"\n\nHey, if you can't stand the heat, get the hell out of the kitchen. Welcome to New York, sucker! As if the animals who rooted for you in that little green loony bin in the Back Bay don't treat our guys worse! Remember the way they treated Roger Clemens? And they didn't know he was going to become the Clemens of 2007-08, either. As far as we knew at the time, it was wholly undeserved. (It was still largely undeserved.)\n\n\"My mom, poor mom. I'm glad she's blessed by God because all those curses were, I mean, unbelievable.\"\n\nLook, attacking a performer's family is a long-established practice. We can say it's wrong. We can say it's over the line. We can say it needs to stop. But can he really be shocked about it? As I said, Wells dealt with it in Cleveland in 1998.\n\nAnd, as I referenced a moment ago, in soccer, I'm an Arsenal fan. They play arch-rivals Tottenham tomorrow. And a frequent Arsenal fan song always references the name of the current Tottenham manager, changing it as they change managers, which happens often:\n\nWho's that team we call The Arsenal?\n\nWho's that team we all adore?\n\nWe're the boys in red and white\n\nand we're fucking dynamite\n\nand Harry Redknapp's mother is a whore!\n\nShe's a whore!\n\nShe's a whore!\n\nIs it righteous? No. Is it funny? Yes. Is it fun? Yes. And they can shut us up by beating us.\n\nPedro has done that a times, not at others.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. If he beats us, then nothing we say will matter, because he can say, \"I won.\" In such a situation, he \"can honestly say that.\"\n\nIf we beat him, then only one thing we say will matter. And it won't be that he's a monster, or a thug, or a headhunter, or guilty of felonious assault on and attempted murder of multiple Yankees, including a senior citizen coach. Or that his mother is a (fill in your insult of choice).\n\nLast night, the Yankees beat Pedro Martinez again. No team has had the kind of success against him that we have had. Saying, \"Who's your Daddy?\" does not matter.\n\nWhat matters is that we beat him. But that, alone, is not enough to make him a \"loser.\"\n\nHe whines. And he lies. And he makes excuses. The great ones don't make excuses. Winners don't make excuses.\n\nWhen the Yankees lost the 1960 World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates, despite outscoring them 55-27 over 7 games, Yogi Berra said, \"We made too many wrong mistakes.\" It was a simple truth, however verbally convoluted.\n\nWhen a winner faces defeat, he mans up. \"We didn't get the job done.\" \"The other team was better.\" \"They wanted it more.\" \"We'll have to do better.\" That's not whining, and it's not making excuses. It's admitting defeat. That's what you do when you lose, but don't want to be perceived as a loser.\n\n\"The way people perceive me in New York... it's totally different than the way I am.\"\n\nNo, Pedro, it isn't.\n\nYou are a loser. A loser who still has exceptional talent, and was once one of the very best pitchers we will ever see, and does have a World Series ring.\n\nBut you are a loser. And you will always be a loser.\n\nAnd if the Yankees are your \"Daddy,\" then it's about time they disowned you.\n\n*\n\nA few more thoughts about Game 2:\n\nDid Charlie Manuel not review the life and career of Grady Little? He left the Punk in at least 2 batters too long. ISIBAISIA (I've said it before, and I'll say it again): Through his 100th pitch, he throws like Sandy Koufax; after his 100th pitch, he throws like Sandy Duncan. And Sandy Duncan is a much better dancer.\n\nNot that it cost the Phils the game, but it did take the score from 2-1 to 3-1, still within \"a bloop and a blast\" as John Sterling would say, but there's a huge difference in the mind of a player or a manager between a 1-run and a 2-run lead.\n\n0-for-8, 6 Ks... Uh-oh, is the real October Alex Rodriguez now standing up? So far, it's only hurt us a little. And if he goes hitless and we still somehow win this Series, I won't care what he didn't do. But this is a big worry. We had a huge hole in the lineup in Game 1, and Mark Teixeira, Hideki Matsui and Robinson Cano closed three-quarters of that hole in Game 2. One quarter remains: A-Rod's.\n\nThis time, I do NOT want to have to tell the A-Rod defenders, \"I told you so.\" I'd much rather tell them they were right, and win this thing.\n\nGame 3 in 32 hours. Look out, Philadelphia, here come the Yankees.\n\n*\n\nOctober 30, 1871: The final championship match of the season takes place on the Union Grounds in Brooklyn between the Athletics and the Chicago White Stockings. The Championship Committee decrees that today's game will decide the winner of the pennant. Chicago‚ having played all of its games on the road since the October 8 fire‚ appears in an assorted array of uniforms. Theirs were all lost during the fire. The 4-1 victory by the Athletics gives them the championship for 1871.\n\nAlso on this day, Buck Freeman is born in Catasauqua, Pennsylvania. The right fielder was the 1st man to lead both Leagues in home runs: The National in 1899 with 25 for the Washington Senators (which was about to be contracted out of the NL and are not to be confused with the AL team that started in 1901), and the American in 1903 with 13 for the Boston Pilgrims, forerunners of the Red Sox. That season, he and the Pilgrims won the 1st World Series.\n\nOctober 30, 1875: The Boston Red Stockings beat the visiting Blue Stockings of Hartford‚ 7-4‚ to finish the season without a home defeat. Boston finishes the year at 48-7. Only 7 teams finish the season with a total of 185 games played between them.\n\nThe success of the Red Stockings has led to several forfeits, and this domination and erratic scheduling is one of the reasons the National Association is abandoned and the National League established for 1876. The Red Stockings will join, eventually becoming the Beaneaters, the Rustlers, the Doves and finally the Braves, before moving to Milwaukee and later Atlanta.\n\nOctober 30, 1896: Ruth Gordon is born in Quincy, Massachusetts. She starred on Broadway and in silent films before becoming a major star in the \"talkies\" of the 1930s. She also collaborated on screenplays with her husband, Garson Kanin.\n\nBut she's best known for her role in the 1968 film Rosemary's Baby. At age 72, she got an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and said, \"I can't tell you how encouraging a thing like this is. She was still acting up to the end of her life in 1985.\n\nIn 1993, on an episode of Mad About You, Paul Reiser's character, a documentary filmmaker named Paul Buchman, told his wife Jamie, played by Helen Hunt, that he was making a movie about Yankee Stadium, using the common nickname \"The House That Ruth Built.\" Jamie: \"Ruth who?\" Paul, sarcastically: \"Gordon, honey. Ruth Gordon built Yankee Stadium.\" Unlikely, since she was, for all intents and purposes, a Bostonian.\n\nOctober 30, 1898: Bill Terry is born in Atlanta, but grows up in Memphis. The New York Giants 1st baseman helped them win Pennants in 1923 and '24, and after succeeding John McGraw as manager, led them to win the 1933 World Series and the '36 and '37 Pennants. In 1930, he batted .401, making him the last National League to date to bat .400 or higher for a season.\n\nHe is a member of the Hall of Fame, and the Giants retired his Number 3. albeit well after they had moved to San Francisco.\n\n*\n\nOctober 30, 1916: Leon Day is born outside Washington, D.C., in Alexandria, Virginia. He pitched for the Newark Eagles and the Baltimore Elite Giants in the Negro Leagues, and was also an excellent hitter. He landed on Utah Beach on D-Day. Although just 30 years old when Jackie Robinson debuted, he only played 2 seasons, 1952 and 1953, in the formerly all-white minor leagues, and was never approached by a major league team to sign. He retired in 1955.\n\nIn 1995, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame based on his Negro League service. Just 6 days later, he died, making him the only person ever to be a living Hall-of-Famer-elect, but not a living Hall-of-Famer.\n\nOctober 30, 1917: Bobby Bragan is born in Birmingham, Alabama. He was a backup catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers, but when team president Branch Rickey announced he would promote Jackie Robinson to the majors, Bragan was one of the Southern players who signed a petition opposing it, and even asked Rickey to trade him rather than make him play on a desegregated team. Rickey refused, and Bragan did not take to realize he was wrong.\n\nIn 1948, Rickey wanted to promote Roy Campanella to the Dodgers, putting Bragan out of a job. To make up for this, he offered Bragan, then just 30, the post of manager of a Dodger farm team, the Fort Worth Cats of the Texas League. In 1955, Rickey, now president of the Pittsburgh Pirates, gave Bragan his first big-league managing job, which also made him Roberto Clemente's 1rst big-league manager.\n\nWhen Rickey died in 1965, Bragan attended his funeral. He said, \"I had to go, because Branch Rickey made me a better man.\"\n\nIn 1958, he was fired as manager of the Cleveland Indians, and legend has it that he walked out to the field at Cleveland Municipal Stadium and declared that the Indians would never win another Pennant. He has denied this many times, but the Indians didn't win a Pennant from 1954 to 1995. He was manager of the Braves when they moved from Milwaukee to Atlanta in 1966, but was fired in that first season in Atlanta, and despite being only 49 he was finished as a big-league manager.\n\nBut it was in the minors that Bragan truly made his mark, gaining a reputation for winning and for fairness to nonwhite players he could not have imagined prior to 1947. He led the Fort Worth Cats to Texas League Pennants in 1948 and 1949, and the Hollywood Stars to the Pacific Coast League Pennant in 1953. As manager of the PCL's Spokane Indians, he taught Maury Wills to switch-hit, enabling him to become a big-leaguer and to revolutionize baserunning even more than Robinson had.\n\nHe was named President of the Texas League in 1969 and of the National Association, the governing body for minor league baseball, in 1975. He is a member of the Sports Halls of Fame in both Alabama and Texas.\n\nIn August 16, 2005, Bragan came out of retirement to manage the current version of the Fort Worth Cats, of the independent Central League, for one game. (The original Cats, along with their arch-rivals, the Dallas Eagles, had been replaced in 1965 by the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs, whose new Turnpike Stadium was expanded into Arlington Stadium for the arrival of the Texas Rangers in 1972.) At age 87 years, 9 months, and 16 days, Bragan broke by one week the record of Connie Mack to become the oldest manager in professional baseball annals. Always known as an innovator with a sense of humor, and an umpire-baiter, Bragan was ejected in the third inning of his \"comeback\", thus also becoming the oldest person in any capacity to be ejected from a professional baseball game. Bragan enjoyed the rest of the Cats' 11-10 victory from a more comfortable vantage point.\n\nAt age 92, he remains involved in baseball with a youth charity.\n\nOctober 30, 1927: Joe Adcock is born in Coushatta, Louisiana. The 1st baseman was an All-Star slugger for the Milwaukee Braves, hitting 4 home runs in a 1954 game, and was a member of their 1957 World Champions and 1958 Pennant winners. He also briefly managed the California Angels.\n\nOctober 30, 1935: Jim Perry is born in Williamston, North Carolina. He was an All-Star pitcher for the Minnesota Twins, helping them win the 1965 Pennant. He won 215 games in the major leagues, and took the 1970 AL Cy Young Award. Older but lesser-known than his Hall of Fame brother Gaylord Perry, they still combined for more wins and more strikeouts than any brother combination before them, and have since been surpassed in each category only by Phil and Joe Niekro.\n\nAlso on this day, Robert Caro is born in Manhattan. He won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography for The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York, in which he details both the benefits and the harm the legendary bureaucrat, builder and destroyer brought the City from the 1920s to the '60s, including standing in the way of Walter O’Malley getting a new stadium for the Brooklyn Dodgers, leading to O’Malley moving the team to Los Angeles, and building the Flushing Meadow facility that became Shea Stadium. Caro has also written a multi-volume biography of President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nOctober 30, 1945: Henry Winkler is born in Manhattan. He's had many fine roles since Happy Days went off the air, but he will always be that show's Arthur Fonzarelli. And that is so cool. Cooler than any typecasting could ever be. You don't think so? As the Fonz would say, \"Sit on it!\"\n\nOctober 30, 1956: Brooklyn Dodgers owner Walter O’Malley sells Ebbets Field to a real estate group. He agrees to stay until 1959‚ with an option to stay until 1961. Then again, as one of the most unscrupulous lawyers in New York, what the hell is a legally binding agreement to Lord Waltermort?\n\nOctober 30, 1958: Joe Delaney is born in Henderson, Texas. He was a sensational running back for the Kansas City Chiefs, but his career was cut short when he attempted to save two drowning boys in a lake near his Louisiana home, and ended up drowning as well. He was just 24. The Chiefs have removed his Number 37 from circulation, although they have not officially retired it.\n\n*\n\nOctober 30, 1960: Diego Maradona is born in Lanus, Argentina. He led Argentina to the 1986 World Cup, thanks to a two-goal game against England. The second goal has been regarded as one of the greatest goals ever scored. But the first goal was an obvious handball, or, as Maradona called it, \"The Hand of God.\"\n\nThis came just 4 years after Britain had clobbered Argentina in the Falkland Islands War, so it was a huge boost for Argentina, but it made the English really mad, and it infuriated everybody else who hates Argentina (including most of South America).\n\nHe won league titles in Argentina with his hometown club, Boca Juniors, of Buenos Aires in 1981; and in Italy with Napoli of Naples in 1987 and 1990, the only 2 Serie A titles they have ever won. However, the club narrowly missed winning in 1989, and for 20 years rumors have been floated that Maradona, already addicted to cocaine, was, shall we say, enticed to throw some matches.\n\nAfter years of dealing with drug addiction, his weight and debt from unpaid taxes during the Italian phase of his playing career, Maradona is now the manager of the Argentina team, but he is somewhat less capable there than he was as a player, just barely qualifying them for the 2010 World Cup.\n\nOctober 30, 1961: Scott Garrelts is born in Urbana, Illinois. The All-Star pitcher helped lead the San Francisco Giants to the National League Pennant in 1989. The following year, he took a no-hitter into the 9th inning against the Cincinnati Reds, but it was broken up with one out to go by future Yankee legend Paul O’Neill.\n\nOctober 30, 1974: \"The Rumble in the Jungle\" in Kinshasa, in the former colony of Belgain Congo, at this point called Zaire, and now called the Democratic Republic of the Congo. George Foreman was the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, and heavily favored to defeat former champion Muhammad Ali. Ali was talking his usual trash, but there were people who feared that Ali would not only lose, but get himself killed.\n\nAli fooled them all. People who say Ali just leaned against the ropes in his \"rope-a-dope\" strategy and let Foreman tire himself out with punches are fools. I've seen the tape of the fight: Ali got in a lot of punches, enough to win every round except for the 2nd and the 6th. Foreman would later say that, at the end of the 6th, Ali yelled at him, \"Is that all you got, George?\" And Foreman said he had to admit, \"Yup, that's about it.\"\n\nThrough a months-long psychological campaign, including practically the entire black population of the continent of Africa in his favor and against the equally black Foreman – he had done something similar to Joe Frazier, who was puzzled by it: \"I'm darker than he is!\" – Ali had gotten into Foreman's head, just as he had done to Sonny Liston, Floyd Patterson, and just about everybody else he'd ever fought.\n\nIn the 8th round, backed up against the ropes, Ali managed to turn an exhausted Foreman around, toss a few jobs, and knock him on his can. Foreman tried to get up, but he ran out of time, and Ali was the winner by a knockout.\n\nWhen David Frost went to interview him for the BBC after the fight, he pointed at the camera and said, \"Is this thing on? I told you all that I was the greatest of all time when I beat Sonny Liston! I am still the greatest of all time! Never again doubt me! Never again make me an underdog until I'm about 50 years old!\"\n\nHe was off a bit, as he probably should have quit at 36. But by far more than his boxing prowess, by the force of his personality, and by the example he set as a man of minority race and minority religion, making him, somewhat contradictorily, the champion of the underdog, he proved that he really was the greatest of all time. At age 67, he still is.\n\nOctober 30, 1975: The New York Daily News, responding to President Gerald Ford's statement that he wouldn’t allow the federal government to bail out New York City's desperate finances, prints the most famous newspaper headline ever: \"FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD.\"\n\nFord didn't actually say that, but that was the message he sent, intentionally or otherwise. Both sides compromised, as the City did a few more things to try to get its financial house in order, and this satisfied Ford to the point where he changed his mind and signed a bailout bill.\n\nBut Ford was damned when he did, and damned when he didn't. The bailout he actually did sign infuriated many conservatives, who already had a few problems with the mildly conservative Ford, and they voted for former Governor Ronald Reagan of California in the Republican primaries, and Reagan very nearly won the GOP nomination, and when Ford won the nomination anyway, many of them stayed home on Election Day, November 2, 1976.\n\nThis may have made the difference in throwing some States to the Democratic nominee, former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia. But a lot of people in New York City remembered the headline and forgot that Ford changed his mind about the bailout, and held it against him, and a lot of people in the City who might not have been comfortable with Carter either voted for Carter or stayed home, enough to throw the State of New York to Carter. Had Ford simply won the State, he would have won a full term.\n\nTrue, the Nixon pardon, lingering feelings over Watergate, the shaky economy, his debate gaffe about Eastern Europe, and conservatives issues with him over things like foreign policy and federal spending also hurt him. But the day after the '76 election, Mayor Abe Beame posed in front of City Hall with the headline, as if to say, \"City to Ford: Don't tell someone to drop dead unless you can make him drop dead. We just made your campaign drop dead.\"\n\nA year later, with the City's finances still not fully straightened out, and crime seemingly out of control, the City's voters told Beame to \"drop dead,\" and elected Congressman Ed Koch as its Mayor.\n\nOctober 30, 1979, 30 years ago today: Jason Bartlett is born outside San Francisco in Mountain View, California. He is the shortstop for the Tampa Bay Rays, and played with them in the 2008 World Series.\n\nOctober 30, 1982: Andy Greene is born outside Detroit in Trenton, Michigan. He is a defenseman for the New Jersey Devils.\n\nOctober 30, 1983: Trent Edwards is born outside San Francisco in Los Gatos, California. He is the quarterback of the Buffalo Bills.\n\nOctober 30, 1995: The Quebec sovereignty referendum fails by a razor-thin margin, with 50.58 percent voting \"Non\" and 49.42 percent voting \"Oui.\" The number of \"spoiled ballots,\" unusable for whatever reason, is said to be greater than the margin of victory.\n\nDespite the anger of the separatists, angry over their perception of victimization at the hands of the federal government in Ottawa and the English-speaking establishment – an absolutely ridiculous notion, since the Provincial government has been dominated the ethnic and linguistic French for most of the 20th Century – the Province will remain a part of Canada, but there is still bitterness on both sides.\n\nIt's just as well: Would you be the one who has to tell the Montreal Canadiens, the greatest cultural institution in Quebec, that they had to change their name?\n\n*\n\nOctober 30, 2001: Game 3 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium. The flag found at the World Trade Center on September 11, with some of the stripes having come apart, is flown at the flagpole in Monument Park. This is an honor.\n\nGeorge W. Bush throws out the ceremonial first pitch. This is not an honor, it is a desecration: By ignoring the August 6 national-security briefing that told of Osama bin Laden's plan to hijack American airliners, Bush allowed New York City to be attacked. Stand on the mound to throw out the first pitch? He shouldn't have even been allowed inside the hallowed House That Ruth Built, no matter how much he was willing to pay for a ticket. (Not that the son of a bitch would have been willing to pay. Has he ever done anything in his life, without somebody doing it for him?)\n\nThe somewhat more honest and somewhat less egotistical born-elsewhere-but-calls-himself-Texan, Roger Clemens, does some of his best postseason work, and the Yankees ride a Jorge Posada homer and a Scott Brosius single to take a 2-1 win, and close to within 2 games to 1.\n\nOctober 30, 2005: Al Lopez, not only the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame but the oldest Hall-of-Famer ever, dies at age 97. He had been an All-Star catcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates, and he caught more games in the major leagues than anyone until Bob Boone surpassed him 1987, and more than anyone in the NL until Gary Carter surpassed him in 1990. (Boone’s achievement was spread over both leagues; Boone's record was surpassed in 1993 by Carlton Fisk, and Fisk’s this past season by Ivan Rodriguez, if you cant count anything that steroid user does as legitimate.)\n\nFrom 1949 to 1964 he was the only manager to take a team other than the Yankees to an American League Pennant, in 1954 with the Cleveland Indians and in 1959 with the Chicago White Sox. He dies just 4 days after the White Sox win their 1st Pennant since '59.\n\nLike another catcher who became famous in another sphere of baseball, Tim McCarver, he had outlived a minor-league ballpark that had been built in his home town. Al Lopez Field opened in Tampa in 1954 and was demolished in 1989. It stood in what is now the south end zone at the Buccaneers' Raymond James Stadium. Just north of the stadium, Horizon Park was renamed Al Lopez Park, and a statue of him stands there.\n\nYankees, Follow the Jigga/Alicia Lead!\n\nI love Alicia Keys. And she was great in the Game 2 pregame show tonight. I am not a Jay-Z fan -- his role in trying to move my formerly beloved Nets to his native Brooklyn is part of it -- but he was on fire as well. Even Ozzie Guillen loved it, and he's a first-class grouch!\n\nWhere was his wife, Beyonce? As far as I know, she and Alicia aren't in a feud. But hip-hop isn't rock or country: Partners in love tend not to also be partners in music, and vice versa.\n\nIf the Yankee bats rock as hard as Jay-Z did, and if A.J. Burnett has as much control on the mound as Alicia did at the piano, we'll win this game easily.\n\nWe need it.\n\n*\n\nDays until the next North London Derby between Arsenal and Tottenham: 2 -- this Saturday afternoon at 1:45 their time. 8:45 AM my time. Oy.\n\nDays until Rutgers plays football again: 2, Saturday afternoon, against the University of Connecticut, at Rentschler Field in East Hartford.\n\nDays until East Brunswick plays football again: 8, a week from tomorrow night, at home against Brick Memorial, the school nearest to my late Grandma's house.\n\nDays until the Devils play another local rival: 8, also next Friday night, against the Islanders at the Prudential Center. Devils fans and Islander fans don't agree on much, but we agree on this: RANGERS SUCK!\n\nDays until the next East Brunswick-Old Bridge Thanksgiving clash: 27. Four weeks.\n\nDays until the 2010 Winter Olympics begin: 106.\n\nDays until Opening Day of the 2010 baseball season: 158.\n\nDays until the Yankees' 2010 home opener: 166.\n\nDays until the 2010 World Cup begins: 226.\n\nDays until the World Cup Final: 257.\n\nDays until the new Meadowlands Stadium (as yet unnamed) opens: 281.\n\nDays until Derek Jeter collects his 3,000th career hit: 562 (projected).\n\nDays until the Rutgers-Army football game at Yankee Stadium: 744.\n\n*\n\nOctober 29, 1860: In the match for the 1860 \"whip-pennant‚\" emblematic of the championship of the U.S.‚ the Atlantics top the Eckfords‚ 20-11. Both clubs are from Brooklyn, until 1898 a separate city from New York.\n\nWith the game tied at 5 each after 5‚ the Atlantics score 6 in the 6th‚ 5 in the 7th‚ and 4 in the 8th to win. Asa Brainard of the Excelsior club umps the game. As agreed upon‚ all umpires are players from another club. Brainard will later became the pitcher – yes, single pitcher – for the Cincinnati Red Stockings, the 1st openly professional team, and his name, Asa, will become the pitching term \"Ace.\"\n\nOctober 29, 1866: The final championship match of the season is between the Irvington club of New Jersey and the host Atlantics‚ with the 2 clubs playing a rubber match to determine the champion of 1866. The Atlantics break a 5-5 tie by scoring 7 in the 10th inning and winning‚ 12-6 to keep the Championship. This is the closest a team playing its home games in New Jersey will come to being a sport's \"world champion\" until the New York Giants win Super Bowl XXI, 120 years later.\n\nOctober 29, 1889: The Giants win their 2nd consecutive World Championship by taking this year's best-of-11 matchup in 9 games. After spotting the Bridegrooms 2 runs in the 1st‚ the Giants rally to win 3-2 behind Hank O'Day's pitching -- the same Hank O'Day who would be the umpire who ruled against them in the Fred Merkle Game 19 years later.\n\nSlattery scores the winning run in the 7th inning‚ coming in from 2nd as catcher Doc Bushing misses a 2-out 3rd strike.\n\n*\n\nOctober 29, 1920: The Yankees sign Red Sox manager Ed Barrow as business manager – the job that will, in a few years, begin to be called \"general manager\" – completing the front office team that will build the game's most successful record. Hugh Duffy, the Boston Braves star who batted a record .438 in 1894, replaces Barrow at Fenway Park.\n\nBarrow had managed the Red Sox to the 1918 World Series, and, regarding the hitting and pitching talents of Babe Ruth, said, \"I'd be a fool to turn the best lefthanded pitcher in the game into an outfielder.\" The choice had already been made for him, but he would help the Yankees win 14 Pennants and 10 World Series in his 26 seasons as Yankee GM.\n\nShortly before his death in 1953, he was elected to the Hall of Fame. At the Yankees' next home opener, a plaque was dedicated in his memory and hung on the outfield wall near the Monuments, and would later be moved to Monument Park.\n\nHe is buried in Kensico Cemetery in Valhalla, Westchester County, New York, along with several other baseball-connected personalities: The Yankee owner who hired him, Jacob Ruppert; a Yankee slugger he signed, Lou Gehrig; the Boston owner and Broadway promoter who previously hired him, Harry Frazee; the Governor of New York who sometimes threw out the first ball at big Yankee games, Herbert Lehman; the opera singer who often sang the National Anthem at Yankee games, Robert Merill; and the Brooklyn-born comedian who was a member of the first ownership group of the Seattle Mariners, Danny Kaye.\n\nOctober 29, 1921: The Harvard University football team loses to Centre College of Danville, Kentucky, ending a 25-game winning streak. This is considered one of the biggest upsets in college football, as the \"Praying Colonels\" (no, I’m not making that mascot name up) were the first team from outside the East to beat one of the old \"Big Three\" of Harvard, Yale and Princeton.\n\nToday, Harvard, like all the Ivy League teams, is Division I-AA (or whatever the NCAA calls the second level of play now), while Centre is in Division III.\n\n*\n\nOctober 29, 1950: King Gustav V of Sweden dies at age 92. As the host of the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, he presented decathlon and pentathlon champion Jim Thorpe with a laurel wreath and, according to legend, said, \"You, sir, are the greatest athlete in the world,\" coining a phrase that has become an unofficial title for the Olympic decathlon champ. Thorpe’s response is said to have been, \"Thanks, King.\" Gustav V was the great-grandfather of the current monarch, King Carl XVI Gustaf.\n\nOctober 29, 1953: Denis Potvin is born in Ottawa. One of the greatest defensemen in hockey history, he was the Captain of the New York Islanders' 4 straight Stanley Cups of 1980 to 1983. Arguably the team's greatest player ever, certainly its most important, his Number 5 has been retired, and he was the 1st Isles player elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame. His brother Jean Potvin also played for the Isles for a time, and his cousin Marc Potvin also played in the NHL.\n\nHowever, his name is best remembered for an incident in the Ranger-Islander rivalry. On February 25, 1979, the teams played at Madison Square Garden, and Potvin checked Ranger All-Star Ulf Nilsson into the boards, breaking Nilsson’s ankle. In spite of the fact that no penalty was called, and the fact that Nilsson has always maintained that it was a clean hit, and that fact that then-Ranger coach Fred Shero also said it was a clean hit, the moron Ranger fans have spent 30 years chanting, \"Potvin sucks!\" – against all opponents, not just the Islanders.\n\nThis led to some confusion, years later, when Felix Potvin (no relation) would tend goal for various teams, including the Islanders for a time. In retaliation, Islander fans have done a \"Rangers suck!\" chant for every home game, regardless of opponent, and New Jersey Devils fans do the same. Ranger fans also had a chant of \"Beat your wife, Potvin, beat your wife!\" Denis Potvin usually beat the Rangers instead.\n\nPart of Ranger mythology is that Potvin's hit knocked Nilsson out for the season, and that's why they lost the Stanley Cup Finals to the Montreal Canadiens. In fact, Nilsson returned in time for those Finals, in which the Rangers won Game 1 at the Montreal Forum, but then dropped the next 4, including all 3 at the Garden.\n\nOctober 29, 1959, 50 years ago today: Mike Gartner is born in Ottawa. The right wing starred for several hockey teams, including the Washington Capitals, who retired his Number 11. But he never appeared in the Stanley Cup Finals, being traded by the Rangers at the trading deadline in 1994, in a trade that helped them win the Cup, to the Toronto Maple Leafs, who made it to the Western Conference Finals before losing.\n\nAmong players who have never won a Cup, he is second to Phil Housley in games played and second to Marcel Dionne in goals, with 708.\n\nOctober 29, 1961: Joel Otto is born in Elk River, Minnesota. The center won a Stanley Cup with the Calgary Flames in 1989.\n\nOctober 29, 1968: Johan Olav Koss is born in Drammen, Norway. The speed skater won a Gold Medal at the Winter Olympics in 1992 and 3 more at the 1994. He and American speed skater Bonnie Blair were named Sportspeople of the Year by Sports Illustrated in 1994.\n\nOctober 29, 1969, 40 years ago today: The 1st-ever computer-to-computer link is established on ARPANET, thus making this a possible birthdate for the Internet.\n\nOctober 29, 1970: Edwin van der Sar is born in Voorhout, the Netherlands. The goalkeeper starred in his native land for Ajax Amsterdam (winning 4 league titles, 3 Dutch Cups, the domestic \"Double\" in 1998 and the Champions League in 1995), in Italy for Juventus (where he was the first non-Italian to be their starting goalie) and in England for Fulham, before going to Manchester United (where he's backstopped them to the last 3 Premiership titles and the 2008 Champions League).\n\nOctober 29, 1971: Winona Ryder is born. She recently played Amanda Grayson, Spock's mother, in J.J. Abrams' abominable re-imagining of Star Trek – very good movie, but it is no more Star Trek than an Escalade is a Cadillac – but nothing will ever top Veronica Sawyer in Heathers. You don't like that? \"Lick it up, baby, lick it up!\"\n\nOctober 29, 1972: Gabrielle Union is born. She played Alice Kramden to Cedric the Entertainer's Ralph in the 2005 film version of The Honeymooners. She was formerly married to Michigan and Jacksonville Jaguars running back Chris Howard. Recently, she was romantically linked to basketball star Dwyane Wade.\n\nAlso on this day, Tracee Ellis Ross is born. The daughter of singer Diana Ross (and sister of actress Rhonda Ross Kendrick), she starred as Joan Clayton on Girlfriends. That show has often been compared to a sitcom of the previous decade, Living Single, with Joan compared to Queen Latifah's character Khadijah James, not least because both characters' fathers were played by basketball player turned actor Michael Warren (a basketball player on the UCLA National Champions of the late 1960s, and later Officer Bobby Hill on Hill Street Blues).\n\nOctober 29, 1973: Robert Pires is born. Now playing for Villareal in Spain, he was a member of France's World Cup winners in 1998 and the Arsenal champions of 1998 (League and FA Cup \"Double\"), 2002 (another Double) and 2004 (undefeated League season).\n\nOctober 29, 1981: Bill Giles‚ the Phillies vice president for the past 11 years‚ heads a group of investors which purchases the club for just over $30 million‚ the highest price paid to date for a ML club.\n\nGiles is the son of longtime NL president Warren Giles, and is now NL president himself, although this is a powerless, purely ceremonial role, pretty much limited to awarding the trophy named for his father to the NL's Pennant winner.\n\nAlso on this day, Amanda Beard is born. The swimmer won Gold Medals at the 1996 and 2004 Olympics. She and her husband, photographer Sacha Brown, recently had their 1st child, a son named Blaise Brown.\n\nOctober 29, 1983: Maurice Clarett is born. As a freshman, the football player helped Ohio State win the 2002 National Championship. Then he tried to make himself eligible early for the NFL Draft, and racked up over $1 million in legal fees.\n\nWhen he was finally drafted, in 2005 by the Denver Broncos, he was released before ever stepping onto the field, even in an exhibition game, and remained in debt. In 2006, he was arrested for armed robbery, and plea-bargained. He will be eligible for early release in the spring of next year.\n\nOctober 29, 1984, 25 years ago today: Eric Staal is born. The All-Star centre is an Alternate Captain for the Carolina Hurricanes, with whom he won the 2006 Stanley Cup. This past May, he scored the winning goal with 31 seconds left in regulation in Game 7 to give the Canes a first-round Playoff series win against the New Jersey Devils. For this, I hate his fucking guts. Okay, it would be better to say that I strenuously dislike his fucking guts.\n\nHe has 3 brothers who play pro hockey: Marc Staal of the New York Rangers (and therefore someone who sucks!), Jordan Staal of the defending Stanley Cup Champion Pittsburgh Penguins, and Jared Staal, who is in the Phoenix Coyotes' system.\n\nOctober 29, 2008: After a 2-day delay for rain, Game 5 of the World Series is resumed at Citizens Bank Park. It begins in the bottom of the 6th, with the game tied 2-2. Geoff Jenkins doubles, is bunted to 3rd by Jimmy Rollins, and driven in by a Jayson Werth single. Rocco Baldelli ties the game with a home run in the 7th.\n\nLater in the inning, Utley fakes a throw to 1st, then throws Jason Bartlett out at home for the 3rd out in a play later described as having saved the Series for the Phillies.\n\nIn the bottom of the 7th, Pat Burrell leads off with a double. Eric Bruntlett, pinch-running for Burrell, scores on a single by Pedro Feliz to put the Phillies up by a run again, 4–3.\n\nIn the top of the 9th, Brad Lidge gives up a single and a stolen base, but faces Eric Hinske with the chance to give the city its 1st World Championship in any sport since the 1983 76ers. Harry Kalas, the Hall of Fame voice of the Phils who would die the following season, had the call:\n\nOne strike away, nothing-and-two to Hinske. Fans on their feet, Brad Lidge stretches, the 0–2 pitch! Swing and a miss! Struck him out! The Philadelphia Phillies are 2008 World Champions of baseball!\n\nBrad Lidge does it again, and stays perfect for the 2008 season, 48-for-48 in save opportunities! And let the city celebrate! Don't let the 48-hour wait diminish the euphoria of this moment and celebration! Twenty-five years in this city that a team has enjoyed a world championship and the fans are ready to celebrate.\n\nWhat a night! Phils winning, 4–3, Brad Lidge gets the job done once again!\n\nToday, 1 year later, Harry is dead, but the Phillies are 3 wins away from getting the job done again, from winning twice as many World Series in the past 2 seasons as they did in their 1st 125 (going 0-for-97 until 1980)."
