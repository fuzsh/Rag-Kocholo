She was aged 61.\n\nDúrcal, whose real name was María de los Angeles de las Heras Ortiz, had been suffering from cancer of the womb, Spanish National Radio reported, citing relatives. A star since childhood, Dúrcal acted in many films but was also famous for her singing, particularly Mexican rancheras.\n\nDúrcal was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, the national news agency Efe said. She was forced to cancel a tour of Latin America in 2004 because of her sickness, the agency added.\n\nBorn into a family of six, Dúrcal’s success in various radio shows quickly attracted film makers in the 1960s and 1970s. In all, she made some 15 films, including “Canción de Juventud,” “Rocío de La Mancha,” and “Marianela,” in which she acted sang and danced.\n\nShe made her first trip to México when she was 17 and has been popular there and throughout Latin America, as well as Spain, ever since.\n\n“She was a fabulous actress and a marvelous singer with great sensibility and I feel so sorry,” said veteran Spanish actor José Luís López Vázquez, who starred with Dúrcal in the 1963 film “La Chica del Trebol.”\n\nHer most succesful hit “Amor Eterno” was written and dedicated by Juan Gabriel to Rocío’s first daughter who died at the age of 3, after Rocío lost her daughter to strong ocean waves, which snatched her baby away from her arms while the two were vacationing. The baby was never found and was announced dead shortly after the accident, which was the most painful experience in Rocío’s life.\n\nIn the 1980s Dúrcal decided to dedicate herself almost exclusively to singing and was greatly admired for the richness of her voice and range of song, from flamenco to ballads, rock and roll and romantic songs as well as paso dobles and rancheras.\n\nDuring her career, she performed with: Julio Iglesias, Joan Manuel Serrat, Luís Miguel, Ricky Martin, and Alejandro Sanz.\n\nShe is survived by her husband Antonio “Junior” Morales and their three children.\n\nOn Sunday, she was buried at La Paz Cemetery in Madrid.\n\nLOUIS ESPINOSA\n\nLouis Espinosa, 50, of Toledo, OH, passed away suddenly Sunday, March 12, 2006, at his residence.

Alanna stole your heart as soon as she gave you her beautiful smile along with those big brown eyes and long curly black hair. She celebrated her pride for her Latino heritage by reaching out to the Latino community throughout her life. Alanna loved her music, singing, dancing, and caring for her children. But most of all she had an overwhelming love for her family. Alanna is survived by her loving mother, Nilda; loving grandparents, Santos and Gloria Rodríguez; great-grandma, Olivia Canales; loving uncle, Rick Rodríguez; uncle, Michael and aunt, Lisa Rodríguez, along with many cousins, aunts, uncles and endless friends.

He was preceded in death by his loving wife, Francisca (Maldonado); brothers, Manuel and Jesús, and sister, Paula Medina. As the patriarch of the Rodríguez-Solis family, Trinidad is survived by his children, Frances Martínez, Jesse (Connie), Fred (Dora), Carmen (Ricardo) Barbosa, and Simon (Virginia); sisters, María Mireles and Luz Gutiérrez, both of San Antonio, TX, and Guadalupe Camacho of Kettleman City, CA; seventeen grandchildren, twenty-two great-grandchildren, and eight great-great-grandchildren. In 1922, at age 14, Trinidad, along with his younger sister, María, came to the United States by way of Laredo, TX. His parents and remaining siblings followed shortly afterwards. Working in the fields in south-central Texas, the family took up sharecropping and prospered even during the lean years 1929 through 1933. Trinidad was fairly well educated for such a young man at that time. He credits his mother for urging her family to be educated, although their means were meager. In poor times, his schooling was paid with an egg a day to the schoolmaster and his daughter, at the private school he attended. As a common trait he shares with his sisters, he was always very sharp, with an excellent memory. Up to his early 90s, he remembered all his teachers’ names from the first school he attended. Of his fond memories of living in México, his favorite was that of a fast horse owned by the family. It was raced and won many races. As it gained notoriety, no one would bet against it, so the tail and mane were cut and dyed allowing it to be raced outside the locality.\n\nDue in part to the Agrarian Reform in México and the beginning of World War II, his parents and a younger sister returned to México. Trinidad married Francisca Maldonado and chose to remain in the U.S., as his education allowed him to work in skilled positions, earning the praise of fellow workmates.\n\nIn 1943, with his bride and 5 children, he migrated to Ohio. His intention was for a better life for his family. Initially living in Elmore, he commuted to his job in Toledo. The family later moved to East Toledo, settling in an area with other Latino families.\n\nTen years were spent with Langenderfers (a coal delivery company), followed by 20 years at Wonder Bread Bakery, until his retirement in 1973 at age 65.\n\nIn the 1950s, he attended night classes at Waite High School which led to him becoming a proud U.S. citizen. Along with his wife, Francisca, they provided the foundation for their family. Both were hard-working, very practical with strict morals and strong religious beliefs. Remembered as an old-country disciplinarian, he became greatly relaxed in attitude with the arrival of his grandchildren. Trinidad’s extensive family is scattered throughout the U.S. His family members have proudly and meritoriously served in all branches of the military. He was a member of the former Virgin de Guadalupe and Sts. Peter and Paul Parish. While she lived, he and Francisca were active with the church and with the senior citizen community at Aurora González Community Center, He served as treasurer of Confradia Guadalupana and participated in Cursillos. He was also well known in the community for his carpentry and construction skills.\n\nBecause of the cold winters and while experiencing good health, he often traveled to México, Texas, and California to visit his sisters and many nieces and nephews.\n\nThe sons and daughters of Trinidad extend our appreciation to Lisa Mitchell and her staff at Swanton Health Care and Retirement Center where he was well cared for in the last years of his life.\n\nMARÍA BURGOS\n\nMaría “Gela” Burgos, 72, of Lorain, OH, died Saturday, Feb. 25, 2006, at New Life Hospice Center of St. Joseph, Lorain, after a brief illness.
