        "text": "Faith: Atheist\n\nCareer: Actor\n\nBirthday: October 28, 1974\n\nJoaquin Phoenix is an actor best known for his roles as unconventional, dark, and eccentric characters in independent films, in particular, period dramas. He’s received various awards, including an Academy Award, a British Academy Film Award, a Grammy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. In 2020, The New York Times named him one of the greatest actors of the 21st century. Phoenix started his career by appearing in television series in the early 1980s with his brother River. His first significant film roles were in “Parenthood” and “SpaceCamp.” During this time, he was credited as Leaf Phoenix, a name he gave himself.\n\nHe took back his birth name in the early 1990s and received critical acclaim for his supporting roles in the comedy-drama “To Die For” and the period film “Quills.” Phoenix received further acclaim and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Commodus in the historical drama “Gladiator.” He also had success with “Signs,” “The Village,” and “Hotel Rwanda.” Phoenix won a Golden Globe Award, a Grammy, and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Johnny Cash in “Walk the Line.” After a brief sabbatical, Phoenix starred in “The Master,” winning the Volpi Cup for Best Actor and earning a third Academy Award nomination. He gained praise for his roles in “Her” and “Inherent Vice” and won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Actor for “You Were Never Really Here.”\n\nFor his performance as the titular character of “Joker,” Phoenix won the Academy Award for Best Actor. He’s since starred in “C’mon, C’mon” and “Beau Is Afraid” and played the title role in the historical drama “Napoleon.” Phoenix is an animal rights activist. He’s been vegan since he was three years old, regularly supports charitable causes, and has produced several documentaries on global meat consumption and its impact on the environment. He’s in a relationship with actress Rooney Mara, with whom he has a son. Phoenix was born at the Hospital Metropolitano San Franciso in the Rio Piedra district of San Juan, Puerto Rice, to John Lee Bottom and Arlyn Bottom. Phoenix is the third of five children, following River and Rain and preceding Liberty and Summer, all of whom have been involved in acting.\n\nWhat religion is Joaquin Phoenix?\n\nAs a child, Phoenix’s family joined the religious cult Children of God and traveled throughout South America and Puerto Rico as missionaries. They eventually became disillusioned by the group and left in 1977, being opposed to the cult’s distorted rules, particularly the practice of flirty fishing. As an adult, Phoenix became an atheist, but he discussed his upbringing, saying, “I certainly was raised with a sense of spirituality. But we didn’t follow rules in terms of belief, religion or anything. It was left up to each of us to come to terms with our own understanding of fundamental questions. I just grabbed the best aspects of all religions.”\n\nHowever, Phoenix doesn’t believe in an afterlife. He said, “There’s just nothing. We’re gone. If I do have a soul, I don’t think it’s interpreting life, feelings or experience. My brain is what’s making sense of experiences and feelings for me. So when that fucker’s cut off, how can I possibly understand or feel anything?”\n\nBack to the Celebrity Faith Database"
