        "text": "Joaquin Phoenix has embraced unconventional roles, so he’s not your usual actor. Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on October 28, 1974. He is well-known for his dynamic and passionate performances. Born into a nomadic family with strong ties to the 1960s counterculture, Phoenix started his acting career early. His breakthrough performances in films such as “Gladiator,” “Walk the Line,” and “Joker” have brought him multiple accolades, critical praise, and recognition as one of Hollywood’s most captivating actors. Phoenix is well-known for supporting environmental and animal rights concerns off-screen, reflecting a complex and socially sensitive personality. It is often fascinating to look at people life’s up close and see the personalities being reflected in their daily lives. looking into people’s homes sometimes gives us a closer look at themselves, so it is quite natural for us to wonder what an eccentric actor like Joaquin Phoenix lives like, here are homes owned by the actor to get an up-close look into his life.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix House Los Angeles (Current)\n\nSituated on Mulholland Drive, Joaquin Phoenix’s principal residence was acquired by the actor for $4.8 million in 2006. With 4,754 square feet and 5 baths, the residence is spacious. Regretfully, no interior pictures of the house are available at this time. However, given that the majority of the garden has been destroyed and the pool is empty, these satellite images of the outside seem to suggest the house may be undergoing repairs. The estate is situated directly across the street from the second house he bought in the neighborhood from a neighbor. It was acquired using a trust in his sister’s name.\n\nBy Hollywood standards, Phoenix’s long-term property is very average, as evidenced by several moments from his “mockumentary,” “I’m Still Here,” in which he notoriously misled the public and his peers into believing he was giving up acting to pursue a career as a famous rapper.\n\nIt’s unclear why he requires the residences of his next-door neighbors, but he may be adopting the celebrity practice of building a compound made up of several expensive homes As it stands, Phoenix has added “a very special charmer re-done to perfection” to his collection of Los Angeles real estate. The living and dining rooms of the gated property lead to a serene, exquisitely designed grassy yard with a stone waterfall and handcrafted outdoor fireplace.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix House Mulholland Drive (Current)\n\nOscar-winning actor Joaquin Phoenix added to his real estate holdings in the Hollywood Hills in 2013 when he paid $1.39 million for a smaller home next to his primary mansion. The 2,511 square foot home’s outside features a bright red doorway leading inside, and basic white paneling, making it both cozy and rather modest by Hollywood standards. The enormous brick fireplace, wood floors, and connected dining area are all characteristics of the roomy living area. The kitchen features stainless steel appliances, an island with bar seating, and redwood cabinetry. The house also has a den with French doors opening onto the beautiful garden with a patio and stone fireplace, as well as a beamed ceiling made of dark wood. Phoenix’s master suite has extra couch space, built-in bookshelves, and cabinetry. Phoenix’s old home next door, which he paid $4.8 million for in 2006, is now a spacious Hollywood sanctuary with lots of greenery and a hint of understated elegance.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix Apartment Tribeca (Former)\n\nAlong with his buddy and former brother-in-law Casey Affleck, Joaquin Phoenix briefly shared ownership of an industrial-style loft in this brick building on the outskirts of TriBeCa, New York. The flat was bought by the couple for $3.135 million, although they would later put it back up for sale in 2016, The flat was listed for $3.495 million at first, but it ended up selling for $3.135 million. With three distinct apartments, the expansive area has three bedrooms, three complete bathrooms, and a simple design. Concrete floors, exposed brick, and eleven-and-a-half-foot ceilings are further highlights.\n\nFrom the outside, 477 Washington is a relatively nondescript building. The Soho co-op recently received an address name change of sorts—it was previously known by the less fashionable 533 Canal. Several well-known people have lived in the building in the past or present, including Kirsten Dunst, Joaquin Phoenix, Gus Van Sant, Casey Affleck, and Michael Stipe, the former lead vocalist of R.E.M. The New York Post reports that Affleck is asking $3.9 million for the duplex he allegedly shares with his longtime friend and soon-to-be ex-brother-in-law, Phoenix. Public records show that Affleck has owned other apartments in the building, including the one he sold to Stipe. This flat seems to have been listed for sale for the first time in February 2016, right before Affleck made public his split from Phoenix, his wife’s sister.\n\nIn addition to the three L.A. area homes mentioned above, Phoenix may or may not also own a Micanopy, Florida ranch property as well as a Gainesville, Florida home which could be owned by the family so hard to verify who truly owns those properties and its current occupancy.\n\nCitations:\n\nMarty McFly – var lastDate = ’Wednesday, McFly, M. and McFly, P. byMarty (no date b) Celeb R.E.: Joaquin Phoenix Buys House next door from main home in Studio City, San Fernando Valley Blog.
