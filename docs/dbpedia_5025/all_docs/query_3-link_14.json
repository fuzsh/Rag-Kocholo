        "text": "Here are 5 things to know about Joaquin Phoenix.\n\n1. At 4 years old, he decided to change his name\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, was born on October 28, 1974 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. His parents, John Bottom and Arlyn Dunetz were then part of the Children of God sect, which they left in 1978 after its dissolution. At the age of four, the young boy decided the change his name to be more in touch with nature. He therefore called himself Leaf, a name which was credited in several of his films before he took back his birth name in 1991 at the age of 16.\n\n2. Joaquin and River\n\nThe actor began his career alongside his four-year-old brother River Phoenix, who captivated the 1980s with his piercing blue eyes and a slightly rebellious angelic face (he tragically died of an overdose on October 31, 1993, at the age of 23). They played together in the TV movie Backwards: The Riddle of Dyslexia, for which Joaquin received a Young Artist Award, given to promising young actors. It was not until 1986 that Joaquin got his first movie role in Harry Winer's SpaceCamp, a space adventure film. However, it wasn't this title that started his career. The film that springs to mind when we think of Joaquin Phoenix is To Die For by Gus Van Sant (1995), based on the novel by Joyce Maynard, itself inspired by a true story, the Pamela Smart case. He plays alongside Nicole Kidman.\n\n3. Animal rights\n\nAt three years old, young Joaquin witnessed the traumatic death of a fish on a fishing trip, which radically impacted his lifestyle. Devout vegan and spokesperson for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) association, for which he has appeared in numerous promotional videos, Joaquin Phoenix makes a point not to wear clothes made from animal skins. Even his costumes or wardrobe when filming must be vegan-friendly.\n\n4. The actor made a buzz in 2008\n\nNo one expected it but in 2008, Joaquin Phoenix announced that he would stop his acting career after shooting James Gray's film Two Lovers, in order to turn to hip hop and rap. The actor changed physically. He gained weight, he grew out his hair and beard. he made the news after appearing on television shows like David Letterman's Late Show where he was supposed to promote his latest film, but he didn't speak about it at all. His comments seemed inconsistent. But all this was actually a hoax on the actor's part in preparation for his brother-in-law, Casey Affleck's, fake documentary centered around Joaquin Phoenix. I'm Still Here was released in 2011.\n\n5. 2010, Joaquin Phoenix's come-back\n\nThe great consecration came at the beginning of 2010. The actor was followed by an army of great directors. In 2012, he appeared in James Gray's The Immigrant with Marion Cotillard before taking the lead role in Spike Jonze's dramatic comedy Her. But the one we're all waiting for is Todd Phillip's Joker, in cinemas October 9, 2019, which plunges into the origins of Batman's greatest enemy. This film, for which the actor radically transformed him appearance (he reportedly lost 52 pounds by eating only one apple a day), received a Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival on August 31, with an eight-minute standing ovation.\n\nAlso on Vogue.fr:\n\n13 vintage photos of River Phoenix\n\nThe Joker: 5 actors who brought the character to life\n\nJoaquin Phoenix to play the Joker in Martin Scorsese’s upcoming movie"
