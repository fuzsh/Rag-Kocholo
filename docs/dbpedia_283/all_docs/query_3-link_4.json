        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe structure of populations will change over time by fertility, mortality, and migration. Then, determination of birth rate, birth spacing, and its influence factors are important. WHO recommends that all countries to apply demographic information such as registration of current events and in economic planning1. Knowing the average of family size and parity progression ratios (PPRs) are the most important information on population policies2, so that rise and fall of the PPRs indicate transmission of the population. Therefore, study and continuous tracking of changes in fertility and its components is important in each geographic area.\n\nIran's strategy has focused on the prevention of pregnancy in past two decades3; but now, has been faced with reduction population growth. The fertility rate of Iranians' women in 2016 (i.e., 1.72) was approximately three times smaller than 1975 (i.e., 6.24)4. Hence, research for the fertility status of women in the past two decades and even before, could be interesting. In addition, such studies can show the impact of demographic policy of the government in reducing population growth.\n\nIn Iran, parity progression ratio from first birth to the second birth and more was relatively high, and several demographic factors have influenced on it5. Hamadan Province is ninth for total fertility rate in Iran6. Furthermore, according to the Statistical Center of Iran report, Hamadan Province was among the areas with the lowest population growth in the West of Iran7. Population growth in Hamadan Province has fluctuated over the years 2005 to 2010, and has not a clear increase or decrease trend8. However, detailed results among previous censuses show that growth of birth registered in Hamadan Province has a decreasing trend8. Continuing the downward trend in the long term may reduce population growth in this province. Total fertility rate in the province was 1.6 in 2009, smaller than a whole country8. The most influence factors in reducing fertility rate are may be birth spacing, high literacy9, 10, higher marriage age9, 11, the employment situation couples5, 12 and other demographic characteristics.\n\nTherefore, the study on the dynamics of demography in Hamadan is necessary. The purpose of this study was to model the factors related to the birth spacing in Hamadan. In this study, the dynamic demographic indicators, especially parity progression ratios (PPRs) which reflect the status of increasing/decreasing household size, were determined.\n\nResults\n\nThe parity progression ratios and influence factors on recurrent birth child were assessed for 812 women, aged 45 yr or older. The minimum and maximum number of children for the women was zero to seven, respectively. However, the study did not go beyond fifth labor due to the small sample size. Of 812 women, 770 (94.83%) had only one child, 671 (82.63%) had two children, 254 (31.28%) had three children, and 73 (8.99%) had four children. In addition, the first infertility rate was 5.17%. The mean±sd age of the women and their husbands at the first delivery was 22.36±4.58 and 27.66±5.31 yr, respectively. The sex ratio at first birth was 104. Median of birth interval at the second, the third, and the fourth children was 4.53, 4.65 and 5.27 yr, respectively. shows the frequency distribution of the women’s deliveries by demographic characteristics separately.\n\nTable 1\n\nVariables First delivery\n\n(n= 770) Second delivery\n\n(n= 671) Third delivery\n\n(n= 254) Fourth delivery\n\n(n= 73) n % n % n % n % Women's educational levelIlliterate or primary688.886810.136023.623142.47Secondary28436.8827040.2413954.723345.20High school26934.9322233.084517.7256.85Academic14919.3511116.54103.9445.48Women's employment statusEmployed13016.8810715.954316.931317.81Unemployed64083.1256484.0521183.076082.19Husband's educational levelIlliterate or primary658.41649.545421.262736.99Secondary36747.6647070.0417468.502534.25High school19925.8412017.88218.272128.76Academic18123.51172.5351.9700.00Husband's employment statusEmployed75898.4466098.3624696.856690.41Unemployed121.56121.7983.1479.59StillbirthYes303.89243.58166.2956.85No74296.3664796.4223893.716893.15First pregnancy (yr)≤1816321.1712318.3310942.914460.27>1860778.8354881.6714557.082939.73\n\nThe results of the PWP-GT model fitting revealed that maternal age, mother and father employment status were significantly effective on the birth interval from marriage to the first child, so that increased maternal age at marriage was associated with reduced child birth ratio (HR=0.96, P<0.001, ). In addition, the childbirth ratio of employed mothers was less than the unemployed ones (HR=0.685, P=0.005, ). Hazard rate of having the first child in unemployed fathers was approximately 0.88 times lower than the employed ones (P=0.039, ).\n\nTable 2\n\nVariables First delivery Second delivery Third delivery Fourth delivery HR SE P value HR SE P value HR SE P value HR SE P value Women age at marriage (yr)0.690.010.0011.010.010.2131.020.020.3180.960.030.282Women's Education:Illiterate or primary1.001.001.001.00Secondary1.240.160.1850.490.160.0010.720.200.1070.510.320.035High school1.140.510.2770.420.200.0010.340.320.0010.671.030.996Academic0.970.230.9050.420.240.0010.190.510.0010.431.170.469Women's employmentEmployed1.001.001.001.00Unemployed0.680.030.0051.050.150.7251.230.390.5861.670.880.557Husband’s agePer one yr increase1.010.010.2030.990.010.1170.980.010.1091.010.020.711Husband’s educationIlliterate or primary1.001.001.001.00Secondary0.850.180.3590.980.180.9130.640.210.0341.210.340.578High school0.700.210.0880.870.210.5160.630.330.1651.030.810.974Academic0.740.220.1830.930.220.7550.870.340.6801.050.880.955Husband’s employmentEmployed1.001.001.001.00Unemployed0.880.040.0390.590.330.1111.370.400.4230.661.030.682StillbirthYes1.001.001.001.00No1.210.190.3220.870.210.5100.690.280.1870.610.510.335Maternal age at 1st pregnancy≤18 yr1.001.001.001.00>18 yr0.930.100.4780.890.100.2900.620.150.0010.730.290.266Family income (US$)≤1351.001.001.001.00135-2700.910.120.3011.030.510.4120.980.410.3780.830.290.274≥2701.240.800.4871.660.760.5911.040.120.1850.880.760.280\n\nWomen's education was the only variable that had a significant effect on the birth interval from the first to the second delivery, so that the hazard ratio at the second birth reduced with increasing mother education. The parent’s education had significant effects on the time interval between the second and the third deliveries. The hazard ratio of the third birth decreased sharply when maternal education increased. The hazard ratio of the third delivery in women, who had age at the first pregnancy above 18 yr decreased ( ). The women's education also had a significant effect on the birth interval from the third to the fourth delivery, such that the hazard ratio of the fourth delivery decreased in accordance with levels of education increased.\n\nshows the parity progression ratios (i.e., the chance of women with a certain number of children, e.g., ith children, who go onto have another child, e.g., (i+1)th children) of childbirth among the women. The parity progression ratios were high since marriage to the first birth (0 to 1st child), while these ratios has been fallen from the third birth and more.\n\nTable 3\n\nC value Parity progression ratios (αi) 0 to 1 st child 1 st to 2 nd child 2 nd to 3 rd child 3 rd to 4 th child 5 years0.9180.8200.5570.3076 years0.9250.8320.5680.3157 years0.9440.8490.5740.3478 years0.9670.8510.5800.3519 years0.9810.8540.5960.36110 years0.9830.8610.5920.354\n\nThe study obtained estimates of the parity progression ratios (i.e., median of PPRs for different values of C) for parities one to four as 0.955, 0.838, 0.557, and 0.349, respectively.\n\nThe chance of the first to the fourth birth was decreasing, such that these chances for the third and the fourth children after 10 yr were 0.592 and 0.354, respectively ( ).\n\nDiscussion\n\nFertility status has direct association on the structure and pyramid of population6. The number of parity depends on the fertility rate and the number of women in reproductive age14, 15. In addition, the fertility rate is dependent on cultural, social and economic of societies14, 15. Therefore, knowing of fertility status and birth spacing are important for policy makers at all fields (e.g., economic, population, health, etc.). In our study, women 45 yr or older were selected because they passed their reproductive age.\n\nThe sex ratio is a useful index to family programming, and was about 104 at the first birth in Hamadan. The sex ratio in 2015 (i.e., the present study) is similar to 2010 in Hamadan, but it is higher than in Iran (i.e., approximately 103)8. One of the most important results in this study was high spacing (e.g., ≥2 yr) between deliveries among Hamadan women. The evidence has indicated that a birth interval of more than 2 yr gives a better chance of infant survival16. In this study, not only the first birth spacing was more than 2 yr, but also the median time of the second, the third and the fourth deliveries was 4.53, 4.65 and 5.27 yr, respectively. Birth interval in Hamadan was larger than WHO recommendation17. Furthermore, developing countries have shorter birth intervals, while women in Hamadan (west of Iran) had large birth intervals18. Therefore, a decline in the population growth in Hamadan may be due to the large birth intervals.\n\nIn the study, we showed that maternal age at marriage had relation with the first birth spacing the same as previous studies9, 19, but unlike them we have shown that it had a negative relationship with the first birth spacing. Because the maternal age at marriage and their education level are concordance, hence, the negative relationship between maternal age at marriage and the first birth spacing may be due to women continue education after marriage.\n\nIn addition, we showed that employment status of women and their husbands had a negative relationship with the first birth spacing, in consistent with Begna et al20. Neither employment status of maternal nor employment status of their husbands had significant effect on the second and more birth spacing. In this study, we obtained parity progression ratios. It seems that chance of parity progression of the third to the fourth child and more are relatively low, and may be due to the implementation of family planning or increasing use of contraceptives in the past few decades7, 19, 21.\n\nThe relationship between stillbirth and birth interval was observed22, while we could not found it. Ethiopian women whose previous sibling had died had twelve months shorter birth interval22.\n\nThis research shows that parity progression ratio at 5-yr period from marriage to the first birth is 0.91, which is high. Such results show a delay in childbearing after marriage, despite the family wishes to have a first child. Delay in childbearing may be due to the socioeconomic situation couples, social support, continuing education of parents, or family support of couples. Of course, we are not sure. Therefore, we suggest that a study is done on the causes and factors associated with delayed childbearing.\n\nAs shown, parity progression ratios 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd children at 5-yr period was 0.82 and 0.557, respectively and the subsequent birth had fallen. Hence, the average family size has reduced in the area. According to McDonald et al23, parity progression ratio from the third birth and more is highly reduced in Iran same the present study. Therefore, a national commitment is needed to prevent the continuation of this negative trend.\n\nDetailed results of census 2010 showed that Hamadan had the lowest average annual population growth after Ardabil, Ilam, Lorestan and Gilan over the 2005-20108. The results of this study and previous census shows that some population changes (e.g., growth of birth and family size) in Hamadan and Iran are the same during the last few decades8, 23, so that the average of family size in both Hamadan and Iran was reduced. However, it seems that Hamadan the same as Iran23 is experiencing transition and in both population growths is declining in the past few decades.\n\nThe study shows that chance of delivery at the third child and more have been declining in the past years in Hamadan. Accordingly, employment and education of parent may be affecting to the declining. This process will cause many problems such as aging population and increasing actual depending rate. In addition, the results showed that the chance of the second and the third birth, after at 10-yr period of marriage is reduced severity. With just a glance, it clearly observed that the decline in population growth occurred in Hamadan, west of Iran, and most families have been turn to one or two children.\n\nSince the number of women having five or more children was small in this study, hence we limited the analysis up to fifth birth order."
