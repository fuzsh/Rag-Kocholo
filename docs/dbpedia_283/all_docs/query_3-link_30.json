        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nRivers are one of two primary sources for supplying water to meet agricultural, domestic, industrial, and environmental demands [\n\n1\n\nPaine L.\n\nRiver cultures in world history—rescuing a neglected resource.\n\n]. However, the combined impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate change are threatening the river-connected ecosystems and societies in various regions and climate systems [\n\n2\n\nSharifi A.\n\nMirchi A.\n\nPirmoradian R.\n\nMirabbasi R.\n\nTourian M.J.\n\nHaghighi A.T.\n\nMadani K.\n\nBattling water limits to growth: lessons from water trends in the central plateau of Iran.\n\n,\n\n3\n\nHaghighi A.T.\n\nMarttila H.\n\nKløve B.\n\nDevelopment of a new index to assess river regime impacts after dam construction.\n\n,\n\n4\n\nEslamian S.\n\nReyhani M.N.\n\nSyme G.\n\nBuilding socio-hydrological resilience: from theory to practice.\n\n]. Anthropogenic activities such as land use change, urbanization, deforestation, desertification, and reservoir operation have altered rivers' flow regimes and flow characteristics. For example, hydropower activities shift peak flow timing and magnitude [\n\n5\n\nBin Ashraf F.\n\nHaghighi A.T.\n\nRiml J.\n\nAlfredsen K.\n\nKoskela J.J.\n\nKløve B.\n\nMarttila H.\n\nChanges in short term river flow regulation and hydropeaking in Nordic rivers.\n\n,\n\n6\n\nPatro E.R.\n\nde Michele C.\n\nAvanzi F.\n\nFuture perspectives of run-of-the-river hydropower and the impact of glaciers' shrinkage: the case of Italian Alps.\n\n], and overusing surface water and unsustainable development decreases the discharge [\n\n2\n\nSharifi A.\n\nMirchi A.\n\nPirmoradian R.\n\nMirabbasi R.\n\nTourian M.J.\n\nHaghighi A.T.\n\nMadani K.\n\nBattling water limits to growth: lessons from water trends in the central plateau of Iran.\n\n,\n\n7\n\nMesgaran M.B.\n\nMadani K.\n\nHashemi H.\n\nAzadi P.\n\nIran's land suitability for agriculture.\n\n,\n\n8\n\nTorabi Haghighi A.\n\nSharifi A.\n\nDarabi H.\n\nMazaheri H.\n\nMohammadpour R.\n\nGohari A.\n\nNoury M.\n\nHekmatzadeh A.\n\nPanchanathan A.\n\nHashemi H.\n\nXenarios S.\n\nKlöve B.\n\nWhen rain does not run, a fingerprint of uncoordinated water resources development.\n\n]. Moreover, these activities can influence basin characteristics, including the rate of infiltration, the balance of evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. This, in turn, increases the risk of erosion and sedimentation [\n\n9\n\nOwens P.N.\n\nSoil erosion and sediment dynamics in the Anthropocene: a review of human impacts during a period of rapid global environmental change.\n\n], negatively impacting the ecosystem [\n\n10\n\nWang H.\n\nZhou S.\n\nLi X.\n\nLiu H.\n\nChi D.\n\nXu K.\n\nThe influence of climate change and human activities on ecosystem service value.\n\n]. On the other hand, climate change, climate variability, and global warming can significantly contribute to alterations in river flow regimes by elevating temperatures and altering spatiotemporal precipitation patterns [\n\n11\n\nNazeri Tahroudi M.\n\nKhalili K.\n\nAhmadi F.\n\nMirabbasi R.\n\nJhajharia D.\n\nDevelopment and application of a new index for analyzing temperature concentration for Iran's climate.\n\n]. The distinction between climate variability and climate change lies in their temporal scales, with climate variability encompassing changes occurring within shorter timeframes. Therefore, an essential step toward enhancing, developing, and modifying sustainable watershed management, preserving the ecosystem functioning of streams, and formulating effective climate change adaptation policies is the assessment and quantification of the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate change on alterations in river flow regimes [\n\n12\n\nEbi K.L.\n\nEnvironmental health research needed to inform strategies, policies, and measures to manage the risks of anthropogenic climate change.\n\n].\n\nIn recent years, a variety of approaches have been applied to assess and quantify the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate change on river flow alteration, including empirical methods [\n\n13\n\nZhao G.\n\nTian P.\n\nMu X.\n\nJiao J.\n\nWang F.\n\nGao P.\n\nQuantifying the impact of climate variability and human activities on streamflow in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin, China.\n\n,\n\n14\n\nGao P.\n\nMu X.-M.\n\nWang F.\n\nLi R.\n\nChanges in streamflow and sediment discharge and the response to human activities in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.\n\n], elasticity-based methods [\n\n15\n\nGao G.\n\nFu B.\n\nWang S.\n\nLiang W.\n\nJiang X.\n\nDetermining the hydrological responses to climate variability and land use/cover change in the Loess Plateau with the Budyko framework.\n\n,\n\n16\n\nWu J.\n\nMiao C.\n\nZhang X.\n\nYang T.\n\nDuan Q.\n\nDetecting the quantitative hydrological response to changes in climate and human activities.\n\n], and hydrological modeling [\n\n17\n\nLafdani E.K.\n\nSaarela T.\n\nLaurén A.\n\nPumpanen J.\n\nPalviainen M.\n\nPurification of forest clear-cut runoff water using biochar: a meso-scale laboratory column experiment.\n\n,\n\n18\n\nTomer M.D.\n\nSchilling K.E.\n\nA simple approach to distinguish land-use and climate-change effects on watershed hydrology.\n\n]. Empirical methods, which are generally the most straightforward approach, have three limitations specifically: (1) the necessity of long-term hydrological and precipitation data; (2) ignoring the role of other variables in flow regime alteration such as temperature and evapotranspiration; and (3) ignoring the physical mechanism of runoff generation. Alternatively, elasticity-based methods and hydrological models have a more physically realistic basis and estimate river flow using more variables in the runoff generation process [\n\n19\n\nSharifi A.\n\nMirabbasi R.\n\nAli Nasr-Esfahani M.\n\nTorabi Haghighi A.\n\nFatahi Nafchi R.\n\nQuantify the impacts of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes in central plateau of Iran using nine methods.\n\n]. Physically-based hydrological models usually follow a time-consuming, costly, and complex approach and require a great deal of data, some of which may be difficult to obtain. Hence, elasticity-based methods are the fastest and most intuitive methods to assess the impacts of anthropogenic activities and climate changes on river flow alteration [\n\n16\n\nWu J.\n\nMiao C.\n\nZhang X.\n\nYang T.\n\nDuan Q.\n\nDetecting the quantitative hydrological response to changes in climate and human activities.\n\n].\n\nThe Caspian Sea is the largest continental water body on the earth (almost 40 % of the world's continental surface water) [\n\n20\n\nDumont H.J.\n\nThe Caspian Lake: History, Biota, Structure, and Function.\n\n] and plays an essential role in meeting environmental demands and providing ecosystem services. This water body, with a water volume of around 78,000 km3, covers an area of about 390,000 km2 in five countries Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. Nine sub-basins around the sea provide about 300 km3 of fresh water to the Sea every year [\n\n21\n\nDumont H.\n\nEcocide in the Caspian Sea.\n\n]. With about 6380 km of coastline, this Sea is receptive to about 11 million people on its coast, most of whom live in Azerbaijan and Iran [\n\n22\n\nAladin N.\n\nPlotnikov I.\n\nThe Caspian Sea.\n\n,\n\n23\n\nModabberi A.\n\nNoori R.\n\nMadani K.\n\nEhsani A.H.\n\nDanandeh Mehr A.\n\nHooshyaripor F.\n\nKløve B.\n\nCaspian Sea is eutrophying: the alarming message of satellite data.\n\n,\n\n24\n\nAkbari M.\n\nBaubekova A.\n\nRoozbahani A.\n\nGafurov A.\n\nShiklomanov A.\n\nRasouli K.\n\nIvkina N.\n\nKløve B.\n\nHaghighi A.T.\n\nVulnerability of the Caspian Sea shoreline to changes in hydrology and climate.\n\n]. Over the last decades, anthropogenic activities such as agriculture, industry, urbanization, transportation, and fishing have expanded throughout the Caspian Sea and around its coast, which has substantially affected water quality and increased environmental degradation of the Sea [\n\n23\n\nModabberi A.\n\nNoori R.\n\nMadani K.\n\nEhsani A.H.\n\nDanandeh Mehr A.\n\nHooshyaripor F.\n\nKløve B.\n\nCaspian Sea is eutrophying: the alarming message of satellite data.\n\n]. On the other hand, the Caspian Sea level has undergone dramatic fluctuations over the last decades and decreased substantially by about 6.8 cm/yr from 1996 to 2015 due to declining inflow to the Sea and increasing evaporation rate [\n\n25\n\nChen J.L.\n\nPekker T.\n\nWilson C.R.\n\nTapley B.D.\n\nKostianoy A.G.\n\nCretaux J.F.\n\nSafarov E.S.\n\nLong-term caspian Sea level change.\n\n]. By 2100, the sea level is projected to decrease by 8 and 10 m under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change emission scenarios, respectively [\n\n26\n\nKoriche S.A.\n\nSingarayer J.S.\n\nCloke H.L.\n\nThe fate of the caspian sea under projected climate change and water extraction during the 21st century.\n\n]. Consequently, reducing the Caspian Sea level can boost eutrophication conditions resulting in socioeconomic and ecological problems.\n\nThe southern Caspian Sea (SCS) in the north of Iran with relatively compact vegetation and mild weather is an attractive and beautiful region for farming, settlement, tourism, and socio-economic activities [\n\n27\n\nKamranzad B.\n\nEtemad-Shahidi A.\n\nChegini V.\n\nSustainability of wave energy resources in southern Caspian Sea.\n\n]. This region had the most rain-fed agricultural production in Iran between 2004 and 2013 [\n\n28\n\nMaghrebi M.\n\nNoori R.\n\nBhattarai R.\n\nMundher Yaseen Z.\n\nTang Q.\n\nAl-Ansari N.\n\nDanandeh Mehr A.\n\nKarbassi A.\n\nOmidvar J.\n\nFarnoush H.\n\nTorabi Haghighi A.\n\nKløve B.\n\nMadani K.\n\nIran's agriculture in the anthropocene.\n\n] and the mean annual harvest of bony fish was about 17,700 tons from 1997 to 2008 [\n\n29\n\nKarimpour M.\n\nPresent Status of Fisheries in IRAN.\n\n]. Due to the distinct climate, this region has always been exciting for investors and tourists, it attracted over 33 million tourists in 2015 [\n\n30\n\nFerdowsi S.\n\nShahmohammadi H.R.\n\nJalali M.\n\nStudy of potentials of tourism climate in the caspian southern coasts.\n\n]. In recent years, there has been an increasing rate of migration from other parts of Iran, especially Tehran (the capital of Iran) to this region, because of increasing environmental problems such as air pollution, land subsidence [\n\n31\n\nSharifi A.\n\nKhodaei B.\n\nAhrari A.\n\nHashemi H.\n\nTorabi Haghighi A.\n\nCan river flow prevent land subsidence in urban areas?.\n\n], and dust storms [\n\n32\n\nShiva M.\n\nMolana H.\n\nClimate Change Induced Inter-province Migration in Iran.\n\n]. Growing demand for housing and rapid urbanization in this region have led to farmlands transforming into urban and industrial lands, while the forests located in the middle of the region are being replaced with agricultural lands [\n\n23\n\nModabberi A.\n\nNoori R.\n\nMadani K.\n\nEhsani A.H.\n\nDanandeh Mehr A.\n\nHooshyaripor F.\n\nKløve B.\n\nCaspian Sea is eutrophying: the alarming message of satellite data.\n\n]. The SCS also is a trade window for Iran to northern neighbor countries such as Russia and Kazakhstan. Therefore, socioeconomic development in this region has been incrementally followed, especially in the last two decades. It can result in increased water withdrawal and severely affect the water supply needs of various sectors.\n\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to quantifying river flow alteration by modifying the elasticity-based methods in an extended region. For this purpose, the trend of hydro-meteorological variables in the study area, including temperature, potential evapotranspiration (PET), precipitation, and river flow, is being investigated. Additionally, due to variations in the length of river flow data, we examine different periods to identify significant change points in the time series of river flow. This approach allows for a more comprehensive comparison of human activities and the impacts of climate change across various periods. Then, the impact of anthropogenic and climate change on rivers' flow alteration is assessed using the Budyko hypotheses, and the volumetric change in the rivers is characterized. Finally, the consequences of rivers' flow alteration in the SCS and its effects on the socioeconomic development path in this region are discussed. While this study provides valuable insights into the impact of human activities and climate change on river flow alteration, it is important to acknowledge its limitations, including the type and length of data.\n\n1.1 Study area and data set\n\nThe SCS in Iran covers an area of about 159,000 km2, in six sub-basins, including Atrak, Gorgan-Rud, Haraz-Neka, Lahijan-Noor, Sefid-Rud, and Talesh. These sub-basins supply about 15 km3 of fresh water to the Caspian Sea annually (Fig. 1). The annual precipitation varies from about 250 to 1700 mm from the east to west of the region. Based on the Köppen-Geiger climate classification [\n\n33\n\nBeck H.E.\n\nZimmermann N.E.\n\nMcVicar T.R.\n\nVergopolan N.\n\nBerg A.\n\nWood E.F.\n\nPresent and future köppen-geiger climate classification maps at 1-km resolution.\n\n], this region is influenced by eight climate types, most of which are BSk (arid, steppe, cold), followed by BWk (arid, desert, cold) and Csa (temperature, dry summer, hot summer). About 117 dams have been constructed on the rivers across the SCS sub-basins, which regulate more than 5 BCM of water annually. Sefid-Rud Dam, with a capacity of 1800 million cubic meters (MCM), is the biggest dam in this region that went into operation in 1962.\n\nIn this study, monthly flow data from 40 gauges (the closest gauges to the Caspian Sea) in 40 rivers and monthly precipitation data from 36 weather stations were used (Fig. 1). The flow data were obtained from the Iran Water Resources Management Company (IWRMC), while the precipitation data were collected from IWRMC and the Iran Meteorological Organization (IRIMO). The oldest flow data in the study region has been recorded since 1950 in the Babol-Rud, Haraz, Chaloos, and Cheshmeh Kileh rivers at Babol, Karehsang, Pole Zoghal, and Haratbar gauges, respectively. Therefore, the length of flow data in selected gauges differed from 22 to 67 years because the monthly flow data were investigated from its establishment to 2017.\n\nIn addition to considering flow and precipitation, the assessment of anthropogenic activities and the contribution of climate change to river flow alteration requires the use of PET, evaluated through elasticity-based methods. Hence, the maximum and minimum temperature data from 35 stations were employed to calculate PET using the modified Hargreaves model [\n\n34\n\nHargreaves G.H.\n\nAllen R.G.\n\nHistory and evaluation of Hargreaves evapotranspiration equation.\n\n]. Monthly temperature data from these 35 stations were sourced from the IWRMC and IRIMO. Due to the limited data length in most synoptic stations within the study region and the absence of sunshine hours data in some locations, only temperature data from select synoptic stations were utilized.\n\n2. Methods\n\nIn this study, the elasticity-based methods and Budyko hypotheses were applied to assess anthropogenic activities and climate change's contribution to river flow alteration. These methods were set up for rivers' flow time series in which the Pettitt test [\n\n35\n\nPettitt A.N.\n\nA non‐parametric approach to the change‐point problem.\n\n] reveals a significant change point. One of the requirements for elasticity-based analysis is PET. The modified Hargreaves model [\n\n34\n\nHargreaves G.H.\n\nAllen R.G.\n\nHistory and evaluation of Hargreaves evapotranspiration equation.\n\n] was used to estimate PET. In addition, the overall spatial/temporal change in temperature, precipitation, PET, and flow across the region is evaluated. To assess spatial/temporal change, two non-parametric methods, including the modified Mann-Kendall method (MK3) [\n\n36\n\nHamed K.H.\n\nRao A.R.\n\nA modified Mann-Kendall trend test for autocorrelated data.\n\n] and Innovative Trend Analysis (ITA) [\n\n37\n\nŞen Z.\n\nInnovative trend analysis methodology.\n\n] were applied to analyze the trend of different parameters. Hamed and Rao [\n\n36\n\nHamed K.H.\n\nRao A.R.\n\nA modified Mann-Kendall trend test for autocorrelated data.\n\n] made modifications to the widely employed nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) method [\n\n38\n\nMann H.B.\n\nNonparametric tests against trend.\n\n,\n\n39\n\nKendall M.G.\n\nedition 4\n\nRank Correlation Methods.\n\n]. These adjustments were designed to eliminate any significant autocorrelations present in the time series data, which typically exhibit autocorrelations at different time lags. The presence of autocorrelation in hydro-meteorological data can significantly influence the results of trend analysis, necessitating its consideration for the accurate identification of a monotonic trend and its significance [\n\n40\n\nPapalexiou S.M.\n\nMontanari A.\n\nGlobal and regional increase of precipitation extremes under global warming.\n\n]. Furthermore, ITA [\n\n37\n\nŞen Z.\n\nInnovative trend analysis methodology.\n\n], a straightforward graphical approach for examining time series trends, was integrated. ITA is particularly suitable for shorter data sets and does not share the limitations of the MK method, such as assumptions about the independence of time series structure and the normality of the distribution. The different stages of the current study are shown in Fig. 2.\n\n2.1 Hargreaves model for PET analysis\n\nThe modified Hargreaves model [\n\n34\n\nHargreaves G.H.\n\nAllen R.G.\n\nHistory and evaluation of Hargreaves evapotranspiration equation.\n\n] is developed based on [\n\n41\n\nHargreaves G.H.\n\nSamani Z.A.\n\nReference crop evapotranspiration from temperature.\n\n] and is widely used in various climate regions [\n\n42\n\nTabari H.\n\nEvaluation of reference crop evapotranspiration equations in various climates.\n\n]. This model used minimum and maximum temperatures to estimate PET. The proposed form of this model is as follows [\n\n34\n\nHargreaves G.H.\n\nAllen R.G.\n\nHistory and evaluation of Hargreaves evapotranspiration equation.\n\n]:\n\nETp=0.0023Ra(Tave+17.8)(Tmax−Tmin)0.5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ETp is PET (mm day−1), Ra is the water equivalent of extraterrestrial radiation (mm day−1), Tave, Tmax, and Tmin are the mean, maximum, and minimum air temperature (°C), respectively.\n\n2.2 Modified Mann-Kendall\n\nThis approach is based on the nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) method [\n\n38\n\nMann H.B.\n\nNonparametric tests against trend.\n\n,\n\n43\n\nKendall M.G.\n\nRank Correlation Methods.\n\n], which is widely applied for the identification of trends in the hydrologic and climatologic time series [\n\n44\n\nMirabbasi R.\n\nAhmadi F.\n\nJhajharia D.\n\nComparison of parametric and non-parametric methods for trend identification in groundwater levels in Sirjan plain aquifer, Iran.\n\n]. Hamed and Rao [\n\n36\n\nHamed K.H.\n\nRao A.R.\n\nA modified Mann-Kendall trend test for autocorrelated data.\n\n] developed this approach to remove all significant autocorrelations in the time series data.\n\nAssuming that the data are independent and identically distributed, the S statistic of the MK test is computed using eq. (1) [\n\n38\n\nMann H.B.\n\nNonparametric tests against trend.\n\n,\n\n39\n\nKendall M.G.\n\nedition 4\n\nRank Correlation Methods.\n\n]:\n\nS=∑i=1n−1∑j=i+1nsgn(xj−xi)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere xi, and xj denote sequential ith and jth data points, respectively; n denotes the sample size; and sgn (.) is the sign function which can be computed as:\n\nsgn(θ)={1ifθ>∘∘ifθ=∘−1ifθ<∘,θ=(xj−xi)\n\n(3)\n\nThe mean (E(S)) and variance (Var(S)) of the S statistic in Eq. (2) are as follows [\n\n39\n\nKendall M.G.\n\nedition 4\n\nRank Correlation Methods.\n\n]:\n\nE(S)=∘\n\n(4)\n\nV(S)=n(n−1)(2n+5)−∑i=1nti(ti−1)(2ti+5)18\n\n(5)\n\nwhere ti denotes the number of data points in the tth group.\n\nIn this new approach, a modified variance of S (V(S)*) computes as follows [\n\n36\n\nHamed K.H.\n\nRao A.R.\n\nA modified Mann-Kendall trend test for autocorrelated data.\n\n]:\n\nV(S)*=V(S)nn*\n\n(6)\n\nwhere n* is the effective sample size. The nn* ratio can be calculated as follows [\n\n36\n\nHamed K.H.\n\nRao A.R.\n\nA modified Mann-Kendall trend test for autocorrelated data.\n\n]:\n\nnn*=1+2n(n−1)(n−2)∑i=1n−1(n−i)(n−i−1)(n−i−2)ri\n\n(7)\n\nwhere ri denotes the lag-i significant autocorrelation coefficient of rank i of time series.\n\nThen the standardized statistic of the S statistic i.e. Z can be computed as:\n\nZ={S−1V(S)*S>∘∘S=∘S+1V(S)*S<∘\n\n(8)\n\nIf the computed Z is greater than −Z1−α/2 or less than Z1−α/2 , there is no trend in the time series at the significance level of α. On the other hand, if Z value is positive and greater than Z1−α/2 , the trend is upward whereas if the Z value is negative and less than −Z1−α/2 , the trend is downward. The MK Z is tested for the significance of trend based on different threshold levels, i.e., 1.645 for 10 %; 1.96 for 5 %; and 2.33 for 1 % confidence level.\n\n2.3 Innovative trend analysis\n\nThe second non-parametric test, the ITA, does not have the restrictive assumptions of the MK test, such as the assumption of the independent structure of the time series and normality of the distribution [\n\n37\n\nŞen Z.\n\nInnovative trend analysis methodology.\n\n]. In this method, the data set splits into two equal parts to plot the first half of the time series against the second half [\n\n37\n\nŞen Z.\n\nInnovative trend analysis methodology.\n\n]. If all the points fall on the 1:1 line, there is no trend in the time series. Conversely, there is an increasing (decreasing) monotonic trend in the time series if all the points are located above (below) the 1:1 line. A monotonic trend means that the variable changes consistently through time (i.e., increases or decreases), but the trend may or may not be linear. The time series has nonmonotonic trends when the points do not entirely fall above (below) the line and instead intersect the 1:1 line [\n\n45\n\nSanikhani H.\n\nDeo R.C.\n\nSamui P.\n\nKisi O.\n\nMert C.\n\nMirabbasi R.\n\nGavili S.\n\nYaseen Z.M.\n\nSurvey of different data-intelligent modeling strategies for forecasting air temperature using geographic information as model predictors.\n\n].\n\n2.4 Pettitt test\n\nThe Pettitt test [\n\n35\n\nPettitt A.N.\n\nA non‐parametric approach to the change‐point problem.\n\n], as a non-parametric test, is based on the Mann-Whitney two-sample test (rank-based) that has been used to detect abrupt changes in the mean of the distribution of the variable of interest [\n\n46\n\nMallakpour I.\n\nVillarini G.\n\nA simulation study to examine the sensitivity of the Pettitt test to detect abrupt changes in mean.\n\n]. The null hypothesis H0 is no change in the distribution of a sequence of random variables when arbitrarily splitting the sample in two [\n\n47\n\nLiang W.\n\nBai D.\n\nWang F.\n\nFu B.\n\nYan J.\n\nWang S.\n\nYang Y.\n\nLong D.\n\nFeng M.\n\nQuantifying the impacts of climate change and ecological restoration on streamflow changes based on a Budyko hydrological model in China's Loess Plateau.\n\n]. The Pettitt test produces a ranked-based comparison between two observations before and after a date t through the so-called Pettitt statistic (Ut,T), which can be calculated as:\n\nUt,n=∑i=1t∑j=t+1nsgn(xj−xi)\n\n(9)\n\nwhere n is the size of the variable. The Pettitt statistic is assessed for all random variables from 1 to n. Then, the most significant abrupt change is selected where the statistic has the greatest absolute value:\n\nKn=max1≤t<n|Ut,n|\n\n(10)\n\nA change point occurs at time t when the statistic Kn is significantly different from zero at a given level. The significance probability associated with the rejection of H0 is approximated by:\n\np=2.exp(−6Kn2n2+n3)\n\n(11)\n\nOnce the p-value is less than the significance level of 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis and divide the data into two sub-series (before and after the change point time).\n\n2.5 Quantifying the impact of anthropogenic activities and climate change on river flow alteration\n\nIt is widely accepted that river flow alteration results from anthropogenic activities and climate change. Hence, the total change in annual mean flow (AMF) (ΔQ‾) can be defined as [\n\n48\n\nDestouni G.\n\nJaramillo F.\n\nPrieto C.\n\nHydroclimatic shifts driven by human water use for food and energy production.\n\n]:\n\nΔQ‾=ΔQ‾ha+ΔQ‾cc\n\n(12)\n\nwhere, ΔQ‾ha and ΔQ‾cc are the changes in AMF due to anthropogenic activities and climate change, respectively.\n\nThe change in AMF is calculated by comparing the AMF in two specific periods, before and after the time of abrupt change. These two periods were introduced as baseline and variation periods based on detected abrupt change through the Pettit test. Accordingly, the AMF change (ΔQ) is the difference between AMF in baseline and variation periods (Eq. (13)) which is equal to the sum of the contribution of anthropogenic activities and climate change (Eq. (12)).\n\nΔQ‾=Q‾var−Q‾bl=ΔQ‾ha+ΔQ‾cc\n\n(13)\n\nwhere, Q‾var and Q‾bl are the AMF in the variation and baseline periods, respectively.\n\n2.6 Elasticity-based methods and Budyko hypotheses\n\nAccording to Ref. [\n\n16\n\nWu J.\n\nMiao C.\n\nZhang X.\n\nYang T.\n\nDuan Q.\n\nDetecting the quantitative hydrological response to changes in climate and human activities.\n\n], runoff (Q) in a basin can be expressed as the following function:\n\nQ=f(P.ETp.V)\n\n(14)\n\nwhere P is precipitation, ETp is PET, and V is the characteristics of the basin. Changes in runoff (ΔQ) can be expressed as follows:\n\nΔQ=∂Q∂PΔP+∂Q∂ETpΔETp+∂Q∂VΔV\n\n(15)\n\nwhere ΔP and ΔETp, are the change in mean annual precipitation and PET, respectively, and ΔV is the change in basin characteristics. Any change in climate variables is due to the impact of climate change on precipitation and PET. Therefore, the contribution of runoff change due to climate change can be defined as follows:\n\nΔQ‾cc=∂Q∂PΔP+∂Q∂ETpΔETp\n\n(16)\n\nBy replacing the climate elasticity of runoff elasticities of runoff to precipitation (εp=∂Q/Q∂P/P) and PET (εETp=∂Q/Q∂ETp/ETp) in Eq. (16), The contribution of climate change in runoff (according to Schaake, 1990) can be expressed as:\n\nΔQ‾cc=(εPΔP/P+εETpΔETp/ETp)Q\n\n(17)\n\nwhere εP and εETp are the climate elasticities of runoff to precipitation and PET, respectively.\n\nAccording to the long-term water balance, runoff can be expressed as follows:\n\nQ=P−ETa−ΔS\n\n(18)\n\nwhere, ETa is the actual evapotranspiration, and ΔS is the change in water storage which can be assumed to be zero on a multi-year scale. Budyko (1974) defined two indexes, including the aridity index (φ), which is the ratio of the PET to the precipitation (Eq. (19)), and the evaporative index (F(φ)), which is the ratio of the actual evapotranspiration and to the precipitation (Eq. (20)). The relationship between these two indexes as known as Budyko curve. For more information about the Budyko curve, please refer to Ref. [\n\n49\n\nDey P.\n\nMishra A.\n\nSeparating the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow: a review of methodologies and critical assumptions.\n\n].\n\nφ=ETp/P\n\n(19)\n\nETa=PF(φ)\n\n(20)\n\nA combination of the climate elasticity of runoff with Eq. (18), the precipitation elasticity coefficient, and the PET elasticity coefficient for runoff can be derived as:\n\nεP=1+φF՛(φ)1−F(φ),εP+εETp=1\n\n(21)\n\nwhere, F՛(φ) represents the derived function of F(φ).

Results\n\n3.1 Hydro-meteorological variables trends\n\nThe temperature has increased almost in all the study regions, and this increase has been more significant in the west and central regions of the study area (Fig. 3a). The temperature in 19 and 4 (of 35) stations has increased substantially at 1 % and 5 % confidence levels, respectively, while for one station (Agh Ghala), it declined at a 5 % confidence level (Table 2 and Fig. 3a). Likewise, the PET has increased in all the stations in the center of the study area, and this increase has been significant. However, it displayed a negative trend in several stations in the southwest and southeast of the Caspian Sea (Fig. 3b). The PET has substantially increased in 14, 3, and 1 (of 35) stations at 1 %, 5 %, and 10 % confidence levels, respectively. In addition, it has declined significantly in two stations (Rasht and Bandar Anzali) at a 1 % confidence level (Table 2).\n\nTable 2The trend of temperature and evapotranspiration based on the Mann-Kendall.\n\nNameTemperatureEvapotranspirationTrend (+ or -)Z ValueTrend (+ or -)Z ValueRobatYes (−)−0.35Yes (−)−0.63Cheshmeh-KhanYes (+)1.87Yes (+)1.76TamorYes (+)1.52Yes (+)3.75**Bahlakeh-DashliYes (+)1.57Yes (−)−1.38ArazkosehYes (+)1.48Yes (−)−1.24RamianYes (+)3.18**Yes (+)1.44VashmgirYes (+)2.45**Yes (+)4.38**TirtashYes (+)3.67**Yes (+)2.86**Agh GhalaYes (−)−1.90*Yes (−)−2.22*ZiaratYes (+)4.17**Yes (−)−0.09Fazel AbadYes (+)2.32*Yes (+)3.15**Ghafar HajiYes (+)3.55**Yes (+)3.48**Sefid ChahYes (+)5.85**Yes (+)2.97**Nozar AbadYes (+)4.48**Yes (+)2.49**Soleiman TangehYes (+)0.44Yes (+)2.25*Kareh SangYes (+)2.72**Yes (+)4.96**ChamestanYes (+)3.43**Yes (+)1.49Pol-e-ZoghalYes (+)2.44**Yes (+)1.96Abas AbadYes (+)2.25*Yes (+)4.63**GilvanYes (+)0.58Yes (+)2.93**AstanehYes (+)5.23**Yes (+)2.31*ParodbarYes (+)2.15*Yes (−)−1.96*ManjilYes (+)0.07Yes (+)3.39**RashtYes (+)0.69Yes (−)−2.58**Ghaleh RudkhanYes (+)5.16**Yes (+)2.10*KasmaYes (+)2.60**Yes (+)1.23MasalYes (+)4.06**Yes (−)−1.50AstaraYes (+)3.80**Yes (+)3.06**MianehYes (+)1.31Yes (−)−0.32KhalkhalYes (+)5.28**Yes (+)1.61Bandar AnzaliYes (+)3.46**Yes (−)−3.67**Maraveh-TappehYes (+)1.26Yes (+)1.40ZarrinehYes (+)3.83**Yes (+)3.79**SariYes (+)2.19*Yes (+)2.35**GhorvehYes (+)4.21**Yes (+)2.07*\n\nBold: Significance at 10 % level.\n\nBold & *: Significance at 5 % level.\n\nBold & **: Significance at 1 % level.\n\nThe precipitation has increased in the center of the study area and declined in the southwest and southeast of the SCS (Fig. 3c).

While the annual mean flow in the Tirom River at the Rezapet gauge and the Kazem-Rud at the Mashallah-Abad gauge increased significantly at a 5 % confidence level. Similarly, the ITA method results indicated that more than half gauges have a downward nonmonotonic trend (23 of 40 gauges) (Table 3). The trend in all gauges was nonmonotonic because the points in all the scatter diagrams have not entirely fallen above/below the 1:1 line and have intersected the line (Fig. 4).\n\n3.2 The abrupt change in rivers’ flow and volume changes\n\nIn this study, the Pettitt test was applied to the available flow data (the whole period, which varied from 22 to 67 years (Fig. A1)) and three specific periods, including 1995–2017, 1988–2017, and 1978–2017 (Table 4).\n\nTable 4The results of the Pettitt test in various periods.

By about 11 and 8 change points, the most detected years were between 1993–1997 and 1998–2002, respectively (Fig. A2d). Of 40 rivers, a significant abrupt change year occurred in 11 rivers varied from 1979 in the Haraz River (at the Karehsang gauge) to 2005 in the Baharestan River (at the Baharestan gauge) (Table 4). The most significant abrupt changes in the flow time series were detected in 6 and 4 rivers located in the center and west of the study area, respectively (Fig. 2e). In the center of the region, the most change points were detected from 1998 to 2002 while in the west, the most changes occurred between 1993 and 1997 (Fig. A3d).\n\nFrom 1995 to 2017, the most change points were detected from 2003 to 2007, by about 18 abrupt change points of 40 rivers (Fig. A2a). In this period, the change point in three rivers was significant, including Gaz, Lavij, and Siah-Rud River at the Vatana, Tangeh Lavij, and Behdan gauges, respectively (Table 4). In the west and east of the study area, the most changes occurred between 2003 and 2007, while in the center, the most changes were detected from 1995 to 2002 (Fig. A3a).\n\nIn the other periods (1988–2017 and 1978–2017), the most detected years were between 1998 and 2002 (Figs. A2b and c). In these periods, a significant abrupt change was found in 10 (of 38) and 4 (of 27) river flow time series, most of which were detected from 1998 to 2002. The spatial distribution of the change points indicated that most of the changes in the west of the study area occurred between 1993 and 1997, while in the center, the most change points were observed between 1998 and 2002 (Figs. A3b and c).\n\nConsidering the whole period, the AMF has declined in 9 (of 11) rivers after the significant abrupt change point that caused inflow to the Caspian Sea to decrease by about 3580 MCM annually. While the AMF has increased in two rivers located in the center of the study area, leading to an increase in inflow to the Sea by about 40 MCM annually. The most decline (increase) has occurred at the Astaneh gauge in the Sefid-Rud River (at the Mashaallah Abad in the Kazem-Rud River) where AMF has declined (increased) by about 88.9 (0.98) m3/s on average after the significant abrupt change in 1996 (2001) (Fig. 5).\n\n3.3 Assessing the impacts of anthropogenic and climate change on rivers’ flow alteration\n\nThe results of elasticity-based methods on rivers with significant change points during the whole period indicate that anthropogenic activities played a dominant role in river flow alteration almost in all rivers (10 of 11 rivers), while in one river (Alish-Rud River), climate change played a key role. The relative contribution of anthropogenic activities to river flow alteration ranges from about 45.1 % (in the Alish-Rud River) to about 100 % in four rivers, including the Tajan, Talar, Lavij, and Kazem-Rud Rivers (on average of about 91.7 %). While the average relative contribution of climate change to river flow alteration was about 8.3 % (Table 5). Anthropogenic activities also played a pivotal role in river flow alteration in the other three periods, including 1995–2017, 1988–2017, and 1978–2017 by about 72.3 %, 79.5 %, and 94.3 % on average, respectively.\n\nTable 5The relative contribution of human activities and climate change on runoff change in the rivers with change point.\n\nRiver nameGauge nameSub-basinChange pointDischarge change (m3/s)Climate change (%)Anthropogenic avtivities (%)1995–2017GazVatana2006−0.130.0100LavijTangeh LavijLahijan-Noor2005−0.4174.625.4Siah-RudBehdanTalesh2003−0.688.591.51988–2017Gorgan-RudBasir AbadGorgan-Rud1998−8.7422.777.3GazVatana2006−0.130.0100.0TajanKord KhailHaraz-Neka1998−7.922.997.1Babol-RudBabol2007−5.8815.085.0LavijTangeh LavijLahijan-Noor2005−0.4261.238.8ChaloosPole ZoghalLahijan-Noor1998−5.025.494.7Cheshmeh kilehHaratbarLahijan-Noor1996−10.6212.287.8Alish-RudOskoo MahlehLahijan-Noor1998−0.2854.945.1Sefid-RudAstanehSefid-Rud1998−105.0227.172.9Siah-RudBehdanTalesh2003−0.603.496.61978–2017Gorgan-RudBasir AbadGorgan-Rud1996−8.6212.687.4TajanKord KhailHaraz-Neka1998−5.640.0100TalarKiakolaHaraz-Neka1998−3.030.0100Sefid-RudAstanehSefid-Rud1998−90.4610.389.7Whole period of recorded dataGorgan-RudBasir AbadGorgan-Rud1995−7.799.590.5TajanKord KhailHaraz-Neka1988−5.420.0100TalarKiakolaHaraz-Neka1998−3.100.0100HarazKarehsangHaraz-Neka1979−5.734.995.1LavijTangeh LavijLahijan-Noor19870.260.0100Kazem-RudMashaallah AbadLahijan-Noor20010.980.0100Alish-RudOskoo MahlehLahijan-Noor1998−0.2854.945.1Siah-RudBehdanTalesh2003−0.603.496.6Shafa-RudPoonelTalesh1994−1.270.499.6BaharestanBaharestanTalesh2005−0.459.790.3Sefid-RudAstanehSefid-Rud1996−88.868.991.1\n\nFrom a river flow decline point of view, anthropogenic activities played a dominant role in 8 rivers by about 95.4 %, on average, while in the Alish-Rud River, climate change played a pivotal role, accounting for 54.9 %. Anthropogenic activities by about 89.8 % led to inflow to the Caspian Sea decline by about 3216 MCM annually. In contrast, the mean contribution of climate change in river flow decline was approximately 10.2 %, which decreased inflow to the Sea by about 364 MCM yearly.\n\nAnthropogenic activities have dramatically affected the AMF in the Lavij, and Kazem-Rud rivers by about 100 %, which led to inflow to the Caspian Sea has increased by about 39 MCM annually. In other periods, including 1995–2017, 1988–2017, and 1978–2017 anthropogenic activities have played a dominant role in river flow decline, which led to inflow to the Caspian Sea decreased by about 27.8 MCM, 3627 MCM, and 3203 MCM, after the change point, respectively."
