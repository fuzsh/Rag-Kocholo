Studies project that Iran's rate of population growth will continue to slow until it stabilises above 100 million by 2050.[4][5] Half of Iran's population was under 35 years old in 2012.[6]\n\nIn 2009, the number of households stood at 15.3 million (4.8 persons per household).[7] Families earn some 11.8 million rials (about $960) per month on average (2012).[8]\n\nAccording to the OECD/World Bank statistics population growth in Iran from 1990 to 2008 was 17.6 million and 32%.[9] The literacy rate was 80% in 2002,[10][11] and 85% in 2016.[12] The fertility rate has fallen to 1.6, below the natural replacement rate of 2.1.[13]\n\nPopulation\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the 2016 population census the population of Iran was 79.9 million,[1] a fourfold increase since 1956. Between 1976 and 1986, an average annual population growth of almost 4% was reached, but due to decreasing fertility levels the growth decreased to 1.2% between 2011 and 2016.\n\nPopulation census results[14] Census date Population Average annual\n\ngrowth (%) Population\n\ndensity/km2 Proportion\n\nurban (%) Household size\n\n1956-11-01 18,954,704 — 12 31.4 1966-11-01 25,785,210 3.13 16 37.5 1976-11-01 33,708,744 2.71 20 47.0 5.02 1986-11-22 49,445,010 3.91 30 54.0 5.11 1996-11-01 60,055,488 2.0 37 61.0 4.84 2006-11-01 70,495,782 1.62 43 68.5 4.03 2011-11-01 75,149,669 1.29 46 71.4 3.55 2016-11-01 79,926,270 1.24 49 74.0 3.3\n\nTotal Fertility Rate\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1960, Iran's fertility rate was 7.3 children per woman. In 2021, the rate had fallen to 1.7 children per woman.[1] A rate at 1.7 may seem good, but it can actually be quite harmful, as it is below replacement rate. Replacement rate is a term that refers to levels of childbearing, and is often calculated to be 2.1 children per woman. [2] When the total fertility rate is below 2.1, this means that the country is faced with an ageing population, which can cause many problems for the country, including increased expenditure on health and long-term care, and labour-force shortages. [3]\n\nStudies show that there are several potential reasons for why Iran is facing a fertility crisis. According to a study through the Australian National University, there are both micro and macro factors affecting the fertility rate in Iran, including education, economics, and culture.[4] Micro-factors can include family income levels and individual choices, while macro-factors can include the country's economy, education, and shifting cultural values. The cross-sectional cohort study examined four provinces in Iran (Gilan, Sistan & Baluchistan, West Azerbaijan, and Yazd) and found that trends show that women in all four provinces are choosing to have fewer children compared to the women born in the earlier cohorts. The majority of women agreed with statements such as “having many children is an obstacle for the parents’ interests” and “having many children creates financial pressure for the family” (among others)[5]\n\nOther sources also suggest that delayed marriage and a tendency to limit fertility are factors affecting the decline of TFR.[6] A decline in TFR can lead to population decrease, and an ageing population, which can negatively impact the country's economy.[7] In response, Iranian policymakers have attempted to limit these factors by restricting access to contraceptives and surgeries that reduce fertility.[8]\n\nVital statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Provinces of Iran\n\nUN estimates\n\n[edit]\n\n(2022 estimates).[15]\n\nPopulation\n\n(on 1 July) Live births per year Deaths per

Tehran for 2006 and their average annual growth have been calculated based on the data of 2011.\n\nLanguages and ethnic groups\n\n[edit]\n\nThe largest linguistic group comprises speakers of Iranian languages, like modern Persian, Kurdish, Gilaki, Mazandarani, Luri, Talysh, and Balochi. Speakers of Turkic languages, most notably Azerbaijanis, which is by far the second-most spoken language in the country, but also the Turkmen, and the Qashqai peoples, comprise a substantial minority. The remainder are primarily speakers of Semitic languages such as Arabic and Assyrian. A small number of Mandaeans in Khuzestan speak Mandaic. There are small groups using other Indo-European languages such as Armenian and Russian; also, Georgian (a member of the Kartvelian language family) is spoken in a large pocket only by those Iranian Georgians that live in Fereydan, Fereydunshahr. Most of those Georgians who live in the north Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran, Isfahan, Tehran Province and the rest of Iran no longer speak the language. The Circassians in Iran, a very large minority in the past and speakers of the Circassian language, have been strongly assimilated and absorbed within the population in the past few centuries. However, significant pockets do exist spread over the country, and they are the second-largest Caucasus-derived group in the nation after the Georgians.[22][23]\n\nJews have had a continuous presence in Iran since the time of Cyrus the Great of the Achaemenid Empire. In 1948, there were approximately 140,000–150,000 Jews living in Iran. According to the Tehran Jewish Committee, the Jewish population of Iran was (more recently) estimated at 25,000 to 35,000, of which approximately 15,000 are in Tehran with the rest residing in Hamadan, Shiraz, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Yazd, Kerman, Rafsanjan, Borujerd, Sanandaj, Tabriz and Urmia. However, the official 2011 state census recorded only 8,756 Jews in Iran.[24]\n\nThe CIA World Factbook (which is based on 2013 statistics) gives the following numbers for the languages spoken in Iran today: Persian, Luri, Gilaki and Mazandarani 66%; Azerbaijani and other Turkic languages 18%; Kurdish 10%; Arabic 2%; Balochi 2%; others 2% (Armenian, Georgian, Circassian, Assyrian, etc.).[25]\n\nAccording to anthropologist Brian Spooner, around half of Iran's population uses a language other than Persian at home and in informal public situations.[26]\n\nOther sources, such as the Library of Congress, and the Encyclopedia of Islam (Leiden)[27] give Iran's ethnic groups as following: Persians 65%, Azerbaijanis 16%, Kurds 7%, Lurs 6%, Arabs 2%, Baloch 2%, Turkmens 1%, Turkic tribal groups (e.g. Qashqai) 1%, and non-Persian, non-Turkic groups (e.g. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians) less than 1%.[28] For sources prior to and after 2000, see Languages and ethnicities in Iran.\n\nUrban population\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to its international migration pattern, Iran also exhibits one of the steepest urban growth rates in the world according to the UN humanitarian information unit. According to 2015 population estimates, approximately 73.4 per cent of Iran's population lives in urban areas, up from 27 per cent in 1950.[29]\n\nThe following is a list of the eight most populous cities in the country:\n\nRank City Province population City[30] Metro[31] 1 Tehran Tehran 8,693,706 14,700,000 2 Mashhad Razavi Khorasan 3,001,184 3,100,000 3 Isfahan Isfahan 1,961,260 3,100,000 4 Karaj Alborz 1,592,492 2,500,000 5 Shiraz Fars 1,565,572 1,700,000 6 Tabriz East Azarbaijan 1,588,693 1,760,000 7 Qom Qom 1,201,158 1,240,000 8 Ahvaz Khuzestan 1,184,788 1,320,000\n\nReligious affiliations\n\n[edit]\n\nPopulation of Iran according to religion 1956–2011 per the UN[14][16] Muslims Christians Zoroastrians Jews Other Unknown # % # % # % # % # % # % census 1956 18,654,127\n\n98.4%\n\n114,528\n\n0.6%\n\n15,723\n\n0.1%\n\n65,232\n\n0.3%\n\n59,256\n\n0.3%\n\n45,838\n\n0.2%\n\ncensus 1966 24,771,922\n\n98.8%\n\n149,427\n\n0.6%\n\n19,816\n\n0.1%\n\n60,683\n\n0.2%\n\n77,075\n\n0.3%\n\ncensus 1976 33,396,908\n\n99.1%\n\n168,593\n\n0.5%\n\n21,400\n\n0.1%\n\n62,258\n\n0.2%\n\n59,583\n\n0.2%\n\ncensus 2006 70,097,741\n\n99.4%\n\n109,415\n\n0.2%\n\n19,823\n\n0.0%\n\n9,252\n\n0.0%\n\n54,234\n\n0.1%\n\n205,317\n\n0.3%\n\ncensus 2011 74,682,938\n\n99.4%\n\n117,704\n\n0.2%\n\n25,271\n\n0.0%\n\n8,756\n\n0.0%\n\n49,101\n\n0.1%\n\n265,899\n\n0.4%\n\nAbout 99% of the Iranians are Muslims; 90% belong to the Shi'a branch of Islam, the official state religion, and about 9% belong to the Sunni branch, which predominates in neighbouring Muslim countries.[11] Less than 1% non-Muslim minorities include Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews, Baháʼís, Mandaeans, and Yarsan. By far the largest group of Christians in Iran are Armenians under the Armenian Apostolic Church which has between 110,000,[32] 250,000,[33] and 300,000,[34] adherents. There are hundreds of Christian churches in Iran.[citation needed] The Baháʼí Faith, Iran's largest non-Muslim religious minority with a population around 300,000, is not officially recognised (and therefore not included in the census results), and has been persecuted since its inception in Iran. Since the 1979 revolution the persecution of Baháʼís has increased with executions, the denial of civil rights and liberties, and the denial of access to higher education and employment.[35][36] Unofficial estimates for the Assyrian Christian population range between 20,000,[37][38] and 70,000.[39][40] The number of Iranian Mandaeans is a matter of dispute. In 2009, there were an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 Mandaeans in Iran, according to the Associated Press.[41] Whereas Alarabiya has put the number of Iranian Mandaeans as high as 60,000 in 2011.[42]\n\nIranian citizens abroad\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Iranian citizens abroad\n\nThe term \"Iranian citizens abroad\" or \" Iranian/Persian diaspora\" refers to the Iranian people and their children born in Iran but living outside of Iran. Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than two billion dollars home in 2006.[43]\n\nAs of 2010, there are about four to five million Iranians living abroad, mostly in the United States, Canada, Europe, Persian Gulf States, Turkey, Australia and the broader Middle East.[29][44] According to the 2000 Census and other independent surveys, there are an estimated 1 million Iranian-Americans living in the U.S., in particular, the Los Angeles area is estimated to be host to approximately 72,000 Iranians, earning the Westwood area of LA the nickname Tehrangeles.[45] Other metropolises that have large Iranian populations include Dubai with 300,000 Iranians, Vancouver, London, Toronto, San Francisco Bay Area, Washington D.C., Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Stockholm, Berlin, Hamburg and Frankfurt. Their combined net worth is estimated to be $1.3 trillion.[46]\n\nNote that this differs from the other Iranian peoples living in other areas of Greater Iran, who are of related ethnolinguistical family, speaking languages belonging to the Iranian languages which is a branch of Indo-European languages.\n\nRefugee population\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of Iran\n\nIran hosts one of the largest refugee population in the world, with more than one million refugees, mostly from Afghanistan (80%) and Iraq (10%). Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation.[47][48] Between 1979 and 1997, UNHCR spent more than US$1 billion on Afghan refugees in Pakistan but only $150 million on those in Iran. In 1999, the Iranian government estimated the cost of maintaining its refugee population at US$10 million per day, compared with the US$18 million UNHCR allocated for all of its operations in Iran in 1999.[48] As of 2016, some 300,000 work permits have been issued for foreign nationals in Iran.[49]\n\nCIA World Factbook demographic statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[50]\n\nAge structure[51]\n\n0–14 years: 24.11% (male 10,472,844/female 10,000,028)\n\n15–24 years: 13.36% (male 5,806,034/female 5,537,561)\n\n25–54 years: 48.94% (male 21,235,038/female 20,327,384)\n\n55–64 years: 7.72% (male 3,220,074/female 3,337,420)\n\n65 years and over: 5.87% (male 2,316,677/female 2,670,254) (2020 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 31.7 years\n\nmale: 31.5 years\n\nfemale: 32 years (2020 est.)\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n1.03% (2021 est.)\n\nBirth rate\n\n15.78 births/1,000 population (2021 est.)\n\nDeath rate\n\n5.14 deaths/1,000 population (2021 est.)\n\nUrbanization\n\nurban population: 76.3% of total population (2021)\n\nrate of urbanisation: 1.32% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n\nSex ratio\n\nat birth: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n0-14 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n15-24 years: 1.05 male(s)/female\n\n25-54 years: 1.04 male(s)/female\n\n55-64 years: 0.96 male(s)/female\n\n65 years and over: 0.87 male(s)/female\n\ntotal population: 1.03 male(s)/female (2020 est.)\n\nLife expectancy at birth\n\ntotal population: 75.06 years\n\nmale: 73.71 years\n\nfemale: 76.48 years (2021 est.)\n\nTotal fertility rate\n\n1.93 children born/woman (2021 est.)\n\nLiteracy\n\ndefinition: age 15 and over can read and write\n\ntotal population: 85.5%\n\nmale: 90.4%\n\nfemale: 80.8% (2016)\n\nGenetics\n\n[edit]\n\nHaplogroups\n\n[edit]\n\nY-chromosome DNA\n\n[edit]\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, the Iranian Y-chromosome pool is as follows where haplogroups, R1 (25%), J2 (23%) G (14%), J1 (8%) E1b1b (5%), L (4%), Q (4%), comprise more than 85% of the total chromosomes.[52]\n\nHaplogroup[53] n B C E1b1a E1b1b1a2 E1b1b1a3 E1b1b1c F G H I J1 J2 K L N O P,R Q R1a R1b R1b1a R1b1b R2 T Marker M2 V13 V22 M34 M343 V88 M269 M70 Iran 566 0.53 0.18 1.41 1.77 1.8 0.88 0.35 14.00 2.65 0.8 8.13 23.86 0.71 4.00 2.12 1.41 0.71 4.01 17.49 1.24 0.35 6.18 1.41 2.12\n\nMitochondrial DNA\n\n[edit]\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) represents the female lineage. West Eurasian mtDNA makes up over 90% of the Iranian population on average. (2013).[54]\n\nAmong them, U3b3 lineages appear to be restricted to populations of Iran and the Caucasus, while the sub-cluster U3b1a is common in the whole Near East region.[54]\n\nIn Iran outliers in the Y-chromosomes and Mitochondrial DNA gene pool are consisted of the north Iranian ethnicities, such as the Gilaks and Mazandarani's, whose genetic build up including chromosomal DNA are nearly identical to the major South Caucasian ethnicities, namely the Georgians, Armenians and Azerbaijani's. Other outliers are made by the Baloch people, representing a mere 1–2% of the total Iranian population, who have more patrilinial and mitochondrial DNA lines leaning towards northwest South Asian ethnic groups.\n\nLevels of genetic variation in Iranian populations are comparable to the other groups from the Caucasus, Anatolia and Europe.[54]\n\nAutosomal DNA\n\n[edit]\n\nA large-scale genetic analyses on various ethnic groups of Iran, published in 2019, found that genetically speaking different Iranian ethnic groups, such as Persians, Kurds, Azeris, Lurs, Mazanderanis, Gilaks and Arabs, cluster tightly together, forming a single cluster known as the \"CIC\" (Central Iranian cluster). Compared with worldwide populations, Iranians (CIC) cluster in the center of the wider West Eurasian cluster, close to Europeans, Middle Easterners, and South-Central Asians. Iranian Arabs and Turkic-speaking Azeris genetically overlap with Iranian-speaking peoples such as Persians. The genetic substructure of Iranians was found to be low, compared with other \"1000G\" populations. Iranians display their highest genetic affinity with other Southwest and West Asian populations, followed by Europeans and Central Asian groups. Certain South Asians (specifically the Parsi minority) showed the highest affinity with Iranians, inline with their ethnic history. Overall, the study results suggest that the genetic makeup of the Iranian gene pool formed already about 5,000 years ago and shows high continuity since then, suggesting that they were largely unaffected by migration events from outside groups. On a global scale, Iranians display their highest affinity with other \"West Eurasian\" populations (such as Europeans or South Asians, but also Latin Americans), while Sub-Saharan Africans and East Asians showed large degrees of differentiation with Iranians.[55]\n\nPeople of Iranian ancestry\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Greater Iran\n\nTats (Caucasus)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tats (Caucasus)\n\nThe \"Tats\" are an Iranian people, presently living within Azerbaijan and Russia (mainly Southern Dagestan). The Tats are part of the indigenous peoples of Iranian origin in the Caucasus.[56][57][58]\n\nTats use the Tat language, a southwestern Iranian language and a variety of Persian[59][60][61][62][63] Azerbaijani and Russian are also spoken. Tats are mainly Shia Muslims, with a significant Sunni Muslim minority. Likely the ancestors of modern Tats settled in South Caucasus when the Sassanid Empire from the 3rd to 7th centuries built cities and founded military garrisons to strengthen their positions in this region.[64]\n\nParsis\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Parsis\n\nThe Parsis are the close-knit Zoroastrian community based primarily in India but also found in Pakistan. Parsis are descended from Persian Zoroastrians who emigrated to the Indian subcontinent over 1,000 years ago. Indian census data (2001) records 69,601 Parsis in India, with a concentration in and around the city of Mumbai (previously known as Bombay). There are approximately 8,000 Parsis elsewhere on the subcontinent, with an estimated 2,500 Parsis in the city of Karachi and approximately 50 Parsi families in Sri Lanka. The number of Parsis worldwide is estimated to be fewer than 100,000 (Eliade, 1991:254).\n\nIranis\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Iranian peoples\n\nIn Pakistan and India, the term \"Irani\" has come to denote Iranian Zoroastrians who have migrated to Pakistan and India within the last two centuries, as opposed to most Parsis who arrived in India over 1000 years ago. Many of them moved during the Qajar era, when persecution of Iranian Zoroastrians was rampant. They are culturally and linguistically closer to the Zoroastrians of Iran. Unlike the Parsis, they speak a Dari dialect, the language spoken by the Iranian Zoroastrians in Yazd and Kerman. Their last names often resemble modern Iranian names, however Irani is a common surname among them. In India they are mostly located in modern-day Mumbai while in Pakistan they are mostly located in modern-day Karachi. In both Pakistan and India, they are famous for their restaurants and tea-houses.[65] Some, such as Ardeshir Irani, have also become very famous in cinema.\n\nAjam (Bahrain)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ajam (Bahrain)\n\nThe \"Ajam\" are an ethnic community of Bahrain, of Iranian origin. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of Manama and Muharraq. The Iranians who adhere to Shiite sect of Islam are Ajam, and they are different from the Huwala. Ajams are also a large percentage of the populace in UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman.\n\nIn addition to this, many names of ancient villages in Bahrain are of Persian origin. It is believed that these names were given during the Safavid rule of Bahrain (1501–1722). i.e. Karbabad, Salmabad, Karzakan, Duraz, Barbar, which indicates that the history of Ajams is much older.\n\nHuwala\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Huwala\n\nHuwala are the descendants of Persians and Arab-Persians who belong to the Sunni sect of Islam.[66] Huwala migrated from Ahvaz in Iran to the Persian Gulf in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.[66][67]\n\nRecent immigration\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of the large Circassian migrational waves towards mainland Iran stem from the Safavid and Qajar era, however a certain amount also stem from the relatively recent arrivals that migrated as the Circassians were displaced from the Caucasus in the 19th century. A Black African population exists due to historical slavery. A substantial number of Russians arrived in the early 20th century as refugees from the Russian Revolution, but their number has dwindled following the Iran crisis of 1946 and the Iranian Revolution. In the 20th to 21st centuries, there has been limited immigration to Iran from Turkey, Iraq (especially huge numbers during the 1970s known as Moaveds), Afghanistan (mostly arriving as refugees in 1978), Lebanon (especially in Qom, though a Lebanese community has been present in the nation for centuries), India (mostly arriving temporarily during the 1950s to 1970s, typically working as doctors, engineers, and teachers), Korea (mostly in the 1970s as labour migrants), China (mostly since the 2000s working in engineering or business projects), and Pakistan, partly due to labour migrants and partly to Balochi ties across the Iranian-Pakistani border. About 200,000 Iraqis arrived as refugees in 2003,[citation needed] mostly living in refugee camps near the border; an unknown number of these has since returned to Iraq.\n\nOver the same period, there has also been substantial emigration from Iran, especially since the Iranian revolution (see Iranian diaspora, Human capital flight from Iran, Jewish exodus from Iran), especially to the United States, Canada, Germany, Israel, and Sweden.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nIran portal\n\nSociety portal\n\nCulture of Iran\n\nEconomy of Iran\n\nEducation in Iran\n\nEthnic groups in West Asia\n\nHealth care in Iran\n\nFamily planning in Iran\n\nHuman rights in Iran\n\nHuman capital flight from Iran\n\nImmigration to Iran\n\nIranian names\n\nSocial class in Iran\n\nWomen in Iran\n\nList of Iranians\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
