        "text": "Due to heavy rainfall, the Ahmad Bridge in Astara and the Sheibli Bridge in the Lavandevil District of Astara County were severely damaged.\n\nThe heavy rainfall and resulting flooding also led to injuries among the local population, prompting emergency response teams to deploy to assist the affected areas.\n\n.\n\nLocal authorities have identified three cities and villages in Astara County, requiring urgent assistance due to the flooding.\n\nThe head of Gilan's Relief and Rescue Organization Babak Mahmoudi announced the deployment of 12 operational teams, comprising 60 rescuers and relief workers, to Astara to address the flooding.\n\nMahmoudi stressed that the flooding in Gilan Province has also affected three other cities and villages, necessitating immediate assistance. He noted that seven individuals sustained minor injuries during the incident, with one person being transferred to medical facilities by rescuers.\n\nAdditionally, 18 pumping and mud-clearing vehicles, along with four boats, have been mobilized to provide assistance in the flood-affected areas.\n\nDirector General of Crisis Management in Gilan Province Afshin Azizi said that over the past 48 hours, Astara County has experienced more than 214 millimeters of rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding, particularly affecting transportation routes in Langarud, Lahijan, Talesh, and Amlash counties.\n\nGovernor of Astara County Mohammad Reza Shahabzadeh revealed that due to the heavy and continuous rainfall in the past two days, approximately 300 residential units in the western areas of Astara city have been surrounded and submerged by floodwaters. Shahabzadeh added that efforts are underway to reopen blocked roads in some rural areas of the County caused by heavy rainfall and landslides."
