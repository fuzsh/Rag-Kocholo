        "text": "The number of Iranians getting divorced are on the rise, according to the latest data from the country's Statistics Center.\n\nWhile the number of marriages in Iran, too, increased during the period between 2019 and 2020 by 4.4%, reaching 556,731 cases, the divorce rates rose by 3.6%, reaching 183,193 cases.\n\nThis means that in 2020, for every 100 registered marriages, 32.9 divorces occurred.\n\nAccording to the statistics reported in Iran's Report on the Social and Cultural Status, published in the fall of 2020, some 51,270 marriages that ended in divorce lasted between one to five years.\n\nFurthermore, 11,715 marriages ended in divorce in just one year. On the other hand, 7,809 marriages of around 29 years were terminated.\n\nIn the 2020 report, neither a complete national nor a granular provincial marriage and divorce data has been published therefore data on this topic had to be sourced from other reports.\n\nThe latest statistical report on Iran’s divorce and marriage, categorized by province, is related to the first half of last year. This information was taken from the Civil Registration Organization of Iran’s website. This article analyzes this data.\n\nThe highest number of marriages, in the first half of 2020, happened in Tehran. During this period, 34,451 marriages were recorded in this province while the lowest number of marriages, namely 1,914 marriages, was recorded in the same period in Semnan province.\n\nThe highest number of divorces, in the first half of 2020, was recorded in the Tehran province. During this period, 15,303 divorces were recorded.\n\nIlam province has the lowest number of divorces, in the same time period, which was 388 cases.\n\nThe numerical quantity of marriage and divorce cases is not a good basis for comparison because of the population differences between provinces. Accurate and proportional comparison requires careful consideration of the province’s population that are being compared.\n\nAdding the population variable to this data changes some of the provincial marriage and divorce rankings.\n\nLink\n\nFor example, when considering the population, the province with the highest number of marriages changes to North Khorasan province. Also, the province with the lowest number of marriages changes to Alborz.\n\nSemnan and Qom provinces are among the provinces that, even considering the population, still maintain their position among the lowest number of recorded marriages.\n\nWhen we consider population, the provinces of Tehran and Khorasan Razavi lose their lead, meaning that, in the first half of last year, per capita marriage in these provinces was actually lower than in other provinces.\n\nA noteworthy point is the very close similarity of provincial marriage and divorce numbers, which, sometimes, differ only by a few thousandths of a percent.\n\nLink\n\nDivorce numbers follow the same pattern as the marriage numbers when the population is considered. Ardabil province has the highest while the Sistan and Baluchestan provinces have the lowest per capita divorce numbers.\n\nThe provinces of Ilam, Semnan, and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, held their low divorce rankings even after adding the population variable.\n\nProvinces of Mazandaran and East Azerbaijan are among the provinces in which both the absolute and the relative number of divorces are high.\n\nComparing the absolute marriage and divorce numbers to the population gives us per capita quantification which provides us with a better evaluation viewpoint.\n\nAnother ratio, which provides us with a proportional, homogeneous, and meaningful comparison point, is \"the divorce to marriage ratio\" which is independent of the provincial population. This number shows that out of every 100 marriages recorded in each province, how many divorces have occurred."
