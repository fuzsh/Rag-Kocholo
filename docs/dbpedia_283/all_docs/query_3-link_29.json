Spatial epidemiology is useful to study the spatial distribution of a disease and to identify factors associated with the number of cases of such disease. By applying these methods, we aimed to identify whether there are clusters of regions in Iran with high or low number of COVID-19 cases and the association of different factors with these numbers, considering spatial relationships and maps representing these associations. Interestingly, we found regions of high number of cases and that more COVID-19 cases were present in provinces with more urbanization, aging population, number of physicians, efficient communications, and greater average temperatures, whereas less COVID-19 cases were present in provinces with more literacy. This study allowed us to understand the spatial behavior of the disease and the importance of having adequate health policies, literacy campaigns, and disseminating health information to the population.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nOn 11th March 2020, the General Director of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared the new infectious respiratory disease COVID-19, caused by the infection of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic, due to the rate of growth of new cases, the number of affected people, and the number of deaths [1]. As of the time of this writing (April 15th, 2020), the number of infected cases world-wide corresponded to more than 1 million, being the most affected countries: Italy (16,523 deaths), Spain (13,341 deaths), USA (10,792 deaths), France (8,911 deaths), United Kingdom (5,373 deaths), and Iran (3,739 deaths) [2,3].\n\nIran was among the first countries outside of China to report a rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths; its first confirmed cases were reported on 19th February 2020 in the province of Qom imported from Wuhan, China [4]. Nevertheless, some reports suggest that the outbreak may have happened two or six weeks before the government official announcement [5]. Iran had one of the highest COVID-19 mortality rates early in the pandemic, and its rate of spread has been amongst the highest. However, as with other countries, it may be a sub-estimation of cases, and there may be other cases not officially reported [6].\n\nThe large count of COVID-19 cases and mortality in Iran are multifactorial. Iran’s response to the epidemic has been highly affected by several imposed economic sanctions and armed conflicts within the last 20 years. Moreover, its difficult economic situation due to a recession, having inflation rates that are among the highest in the region, has taken a toll on its public health system [7,8]. Although there are approximately 184,000 hospitals and primary health-care staff, limitations in the availability of COVID-19 testing kits, protective equipment, and ventilators are quite important. On the other hand, over the last years, Iran has slowed the rate of mortality associated with infectious and maternal diseases. It is currently undergoing an epidemiological transition where infectious diseases interact with chronic conditions [2]. In this sense, Iran may represent other similar developing world countries with poor health systems and an increased prevalence of chronic diseases.\n\nSpatial statistics have emerged as a useful tool for the analysis of spatial epidemiology, concerning mapping and statistical analyses of spatial and spatio-temporal incidences of different pathogens. The aim of this paper is to perform spatial analyses which allow us to better understand the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran, not only in terms of the strength of its presence and socioeconomic and structural factors which facilitate the disease spread within Iranian provinces, but also in terms of how the disease is spatially distributed and which variables are spatially related with it considering the spatial effect to obtain adequate inferences. Given the role of climate and socio-economic factors in determining the distribution of cases and its impact world-wide, we also aimed to incorporate said factors as predictors of SARS-CoV-2 spread [9,10]. This could aid to understand the burden of COVID-19, its distribution in the country, and its implication on public health within Iran and similar countries [11] and could contribute to public health measures by providing insight to inform the implementation of interventions or to understand socio-demographic factors associated with the SARS-CoV-2 spread and COVID-19 heterogeneity as it has been applied to previous infectious diseases [12–16].\n\nDiscussion\n\nHere, we demonstrate that the rates of COVID-19 cases within Iranian provinces are spatially correlated. This could be due to the origin of the outbreak, which started on the north of Iran, and can be seen through an important province cluster with the highest number of COVID-19 cases that we found around Tehran and Qom. Several mathematical models have been used to model the COVID-19 outbreak, mostly focused on forecasting the number of cases and assessing the capacity of country-level healthcare systems to manage disease burden [30–32]. In the present report, we demonstrate that the spatial relationship and socio-demographic factors associated with the provinces must be considered to model the disease adequately, and this report also highlights structural factors that may lead to inequities in COVID-19 spread. Of relevance, we highlight the role of social determinants of health in sustaining SARS-CoV-2 transmission and provide additional evidence that human mobility or province interconnectedness might be associated in favoring disease spread [33].\n\nImportantly, our approach demonstrates that urbanization, aging population, education, average temperatures, number of physicians, and inter-province communications are associated with the case numbers amongst Iranian provinces. The obtained results do not consider the spatial effect, which is accumulated since the spatially lagged response is part of the explanatory variables, and they consider fixed values for all variables except the one being interpreted. Overall, these variables spatially correlate with the COVID-19 province clustering indicating a consistent association with the observed variables. The greatest increase in the number of COVID-19 cases is associated with people aged ≥60 years, urban population, and how well the provinces are communicated, with age having one of the most important associations, an increase of 1% in the corresponding rate implies a percentage increase of 46.65% over the number of cases. Of relevance, mortality attributable to COVID-19 complications is higher in this age group, and age increases the likelihood of developing the symptomatic disease and increased disease severity [34,35]. Nevertheless, the association with older age could have different meanings depending on the number of comorbidities, with some reports labeling COVID-19 as an age-related disease [36]. Our data demonstrate that the spatial spread of COVID-19 has a relationship with population aging structures, a concept that must be explored in this setting to obtain population-specific estimates and lethality and which could represent a significant structural inequality related to COVID-19 burden [37].\n\nUrbanization rates also are associated with a percentage increase over the number of COVID-19 cases; we observed a similar association regarding province interconnectedness, which goes in line with recent information on human mobility and its effect in decreasing disease spread through social distancing [33]. Urbanization, as a demographic phenomenon, leads to increased interconnectedness and human mobility as well as increased population density; these two factors facilitate disease spread. Emerging zoonotic diseases similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been linked to major structural factors that have been reported in other studies, including population growth, climate change, urbanization, and pollution [38,39]. Thus, communication and the degree of urbanity, and what this implies in terms of pollution, overcrowding, among other factors, seem to be relevant to determine the number of COVID-19 cases and should imply geographical targets for public health interventions to monitor disease spread and disease containment [40].\n\nThe only effect associated with a decrease in the number of COVID19 cases in our study was attributed to literacy, which might reflect several factors that ultimately influence disease spread. Data from several countries, including Iran, identified that higher health literacy was associated with a lower number of COVID-19 cases, probably reflecting attitudes towards public health measures including social distancing, early disease detection, and hand hygiene [41,42]. Interestingly, this poses a potential public health intervention given that individuals with reduced health literacy, not only might have higher rates of COVID-19, but also increased likelihood for depression and impaired quality of life in suspected cases. Literacy’s protective effect on disease spread also indicates a strong influence on social inequity and vulnerability as risk factors for COVID-19 spread, particularly on the influence of health equity, which will likely define the long-term impact of COVID-19 in many developing countries [43].\n\nConcerning average temperature levels, we were able to obtain information associated only with the capitals and not the provinces, being a limitation of the analyzed information, obtaining some inconclusive results. On one hand, the global spatial autocorrelation was negative, though not statistically significant, indicating that global areas with higher temperatures are spatially related to areas with lower disease rates. On the other hand, on the spatial linear model, we derived that more temperature is associated with more cases. However; the former result does not contradict the latter since the direct effect in each province of a variable over the response is different from the spatial relationship between two variables. The latter considers one of the variables as spatially lagged (COVID-19), and thus the direct effect between variables in the same province is not included. In fact, this problem occurs in all the bivariate analysis, so care should be taken in all the interpretations. Notably, our results are consistent with previous analyses which have analyzed the impact of climate on SARS-CoV-2 stability and spread [44]. However, these results should be further studied considering the climate data limitations, that we obtained mixed results, and that some studies suggest there is no evidence that spread rates of the disease decline with higher temperatures [45].\n\nOur study had some strengths and limitations. We approached COVID-19 using spatial analysis, which allowed us to identify province-level factors that are associated with the disease spread and which may be shared by other countries with similar socioeconomic or geographic structures by potentially identifying targets for country-wide public health interventions. This approach considers disease spread beyond individual-specific factors and could also be used to monitor areas of a potentially high number of undiagnosed cases that could facilitate disease spread and the surge of delayed waves of COVID-19 after initial mitigation [46,47]. Methodologically, all our analyses consider the spatial nature of the data. We identified significant spatial clustering and in terms of the spatial multivariate linear model, by including a spatial effect, we consider that the number of cases in an area is affected by those in neighboring areas. In this way, a lack of independency between spatial units is considered, being independence assumed in a usual linear model, thus obtaining more precise estimations. Of course, other statistical methods are available for this task, as generalized linear mixed models or geographically weighted regression; however, they do not use spatial weights, making our results more comparable with the Moran’s I or spatial clustering, which are based on such weights. A limitation of our approach is that most of the variables used to explain COVID-19 disease rates were taken from previous years and not updates, given the unavailability of recent estimates. Furthermore, smoothed COVID-19 rates were calculated using a projection of the population in 2020 since the most recent census corresponds to 2016, thus rates could have slightly different values. In this sense, the explanatory variables were not projected since information of previous years was not always available; however, precise projections for each variable were out of the scope of this work; and, it is also possible that some variables have a time lagged effect over the response. However; the time lagged effect we included was unintentional and dependent on the information available and not considering a lagged time effect as defined by experts; for instance, for GDP we used a time lag of 16 years, when perhaps it should have been of fewer years. When obtaining estimates using both projected and population size in 2016, we observed no significant changes in the results, which confirms the robustness of our approach. In fact, with all the mathematical projection methods similar results were obtained. However, the projections by province could be improved by considering a demographic balance equation and probabilistic projection methods as the ones obtained by country by the UN [48]. In this sense, we suspect similar results would still be obtained since our projected values by country are similar to those obtained by the UN. We also observed that the smoothed and raw rates of COVID-19 cases were similar, with an absolute difference between them of at most 0.607 (considering rates for every 1000 individuals), this was probably due to Iran not having provinces with extremely small or large population size. Future work could be focused on evaluating spatio-temporal modeling, which could be useful to monitor disease spread and identify additional factors relating not only to transmission rates but also to transmission dynamics. Since COVID-19 is currently challenging health systems all over the world, science-centered public health decisions could benefit from spatial modeling to investigate larger factors targeted for public health interventions.\n\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 spread within Iranian provinces is spatially correlated. The main factors associated with a high number of cases are older age, high degrees of urbanization, province interconnectedness, higher average temperatures, lower literacy rates, and the number of physicians. Structural determinants for the spread of emerging zoonotic diseases, including SARS-CoV-2, must be understood in order to implement evidence-based regional public health policies aimed at improving mitigation policies and diminishing the likelihood of disease re-emergence."
