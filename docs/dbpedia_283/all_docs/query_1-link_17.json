        "text": "The potential of generalized deep learning models developed for crop water estimation was examined in the current study. This study was conducted in a semiarid region of India, i.e., Karnataka, with daily climatic data (maximum and minimum air temperatures, maximum and minimum relative humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours, and rainfall) of 44 years (1976–2020) for twelve locations. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Random Forest (RF) are three ensemble deep learning models that were developed using all of the climatic data from a single location (Bengaluru) from January 1976 to December 2017 and then immediately applied at eleven different locations (Ballari, Chikmaglur, Chitradurga, Devnagiri, Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri, Koppal, Mandya, Shivmoga, and Tumkuru) without the need for any local calibration. For the test period of January 2018–June 2020, the model’s capacity to estimate the numerical values of crop water requirement (Penman-Monteith (P-M) ETo values) was assessed. The developed ensemble deep learning models were evaluated using the performance criteria of mean absolute error (MAE), average absolute relative error (AARE), coefficient of correlation (r), noise to signal ratio (NS), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (ɳ), and weighted standard error of estimate (WSEE). The results indicated that the WSEE values of RF, GB, and XGBoost models for each location were smaller than 1 mm per day, and the model’s effectiveness varied from 96% to 99% across various locations. While all of the deep learning models performed better with respect to the P-M ETo approach, the XGBoost model was able to estimate ETo with greater accuracy than the GB and RF models. The XGBoost model’s strong performance was also indicated by the decreased noise-to-signal ratio. Thus, in this study, a generalized mathematical model for short-term ETo estimates is developed using ensemble deep learning techniques. Because of this type of model’s accuracy in calculating crop water requirements and its ability for generalization, it can be effortlessly integrated with a real-time water management system or an autonomous weather station at the regional level.\n\nPrecision agriculture considers reference evapotranspiration (ETo) as a significant meteorological parameter for estimating crop water need and thus planning precision irrigation. This paper proposes a stacked bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) framework for the hourly forecasting of ETo. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) process was employed to select the optimal feature lag for the model construction. Single and multi-step ahead ETo forecasting models with stacked BLSTM and LSTM architectures were developed using RFE suggested 24 feature lags as input and the prediction horizons of 1, 6, 12, and 24. The evaluation process verified the efficiency of stacked BLSTM models over stacked LSTM models in all prediction horizons. The study reported the best accuracy for the single-step ahead ETo forecasting model, BLSTM 24-1, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.94 mm/hour, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.7 mm/hour and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.91. Though the shorter horizon improves the forecasting accuracy, the negligible variations in the performance metrics observed in the multi-step ahead models, such as 1.31-1.11 mm/hour in MAE, 2.38-2.11 mm/hour in RMSE, and 0.83-0.86 in R2, emphasized the supremacy of stacked BLSTM architecture in ETo hourly forecasting, irrespective of the prediction horizon. Hence, in addition to the most reliable one-step ahead BLSTM model, this study also recommends the 24 hours ahead BLSTM model as a daily irrigation planning tool for agriculturists by aggregating its output time series.\n\nThe aim of this study is to model Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) in Nigeria and Cyprus with Maiduguri and Larnaca as a case study region. Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) which utilized 3 membership function owing to its fine mapping capability was employed for the modeling purpose. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model was also developed. The results were compared to Penman-Monteith (FAO-56-PM) model. Monthly average of long-term climate data including minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed were used as inputs to the models. The performance of the models was evaluated by two global statistics of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Determination Coefficient (DC). The results indicated that ANFIS had better performance than MLR models. The results also showed ANFIS was capable of modeling ET0 in the study regions efficiently, but had better performance in Maiduguri than in Larnaca region. Keywords— Climate data, Cyprus, fuzzy inference system, multiple linear regression, Maiduguri.\n\nThe estimation of Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0) is crucial to estimate crop water requirements, especially in developing countries and areas with scarce water resources. In these regions, the impossibility of collecting all the required data to compute FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (FAO56-PM) make scientists search new methodologies to accurately estimate ET0 with the minimum number of climatic parameters. In this work, several neural network approaches have been evaluated for estimating ET0 using datasets from five weather stations located in Southern Spain (semiarid region of Andalusia). The assessment of statistical performance (Root Mean Square Error -RMSE-, Mean Bias Error -MBE-, coefficient of determination -R2- and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient -NSE-) of models namely Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost were carried out using different input variables configurations. Only temperature-based data were used as inputs; the calculation of new variables called EnergyT (the integral of the half hourly temperature values of a day) and Hourmin (the difference in hours between time sunset and the time when the maximum temperature occurs) had promising results for the most humid stations. The good results obtained with EnergyT when it is used as an input of the system demonstrated that the information contained on it gives detailed characterization of the daily thermic behavior at each location, resulting in a more efficient model than those using only daily maximum, minimum temperature and extraterrestrial radiation values. In general, the modelling results showed that no model firmly outperformed the others, although MLP and ELM were commonly the models that gave the best performances for all sites: mean values of R2 >0.89, mean values of NSE >0.88, mean values of RMSE <0.67 mm/day and mean values of MBE ranging from -0.17 to 0.30 mm/day. Therefore, EnergyT and Hourmin can be used to estimate ET0 more accurately in stations where data acquisition is limited, like in developing countries or at low-cost weather stations that cannot collect all the required meteorological variables used in FAO56-PM. Overall, the use of ELM is recommended due to its high performance in terms of efficiency (NSE) for all the configurations and for all locations, especially using EnergyT as an input variable.\n\nIn the present study, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Genetic Programming (GP) soft-computing models were established to estimate streamflow in Tel River Basin, Odisha, India. In most of the previous time-series soft computing models/studies, the time delay or basin lag has been considered without any physical basis for streamflow estimation/forecasting. Considering these limitations, the 02 isochrones (zones) were delineated up to Kesinga Station based on its topography for incorporating the time delay phenomenon. The monsoon rainfall of the period of 1998–2011 (14 years) in each zone was estimated and delayed as per their respective time-delay zone and fed into both the models for discharge estimation. It was observed that after incorporating the time delay factor, the accuracy of streamflow estimation increased for both the models. However, the ANNs could not map the peak discharge and the model efficiency was less as compared to the GP model. The best GP model achieved an efficiency of 74%, where ANNs could reach up to only 59%. After establishing the soft computing based discharge estimation model for the basin, the flood inundation between Kesinga and Kantamal stations was studied using the hydrodynamic model for the estimated peak discharge.\n\nPrediction of hydrological variables is a very useful tool in water resources management. The importance of the forecast in environmental issues causes to use more accurate statistical methods for studying the weather and climate change. The main objective of this study is to investigate the use of additive and multiplicative forms of Holt-Winters time series model to predict environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, and sunshine hours for one year in advance. As Holt-Winters model uses a weighted average of current and past values to provide predictions, in this study higher emphasis is placed on the recent observations by using larger weights for these data compared to the older ones. As a case study monthly environmental data (i.e., precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature and sunshine hours) collected for a span of 30 years (from 1981 to 2010) from Robat Gharah-Bil station located in Golestan, Iran was used. After modeling the data through additive and multiplicative procedures, the main three smoothing parameters of the model are optimized using a nonlinear optimization method. Based on this study using the multiplicative form of Holt-Winters time series results in an overall of 4% less mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to the additive one. The result showed that, this model is more efficient in predicting and modeling climate parameters which show stable patterns of cycle and seasonality.\n\nThis study focuses on the application of generalized wavelet neural network (GWNN) models corresponding to the FAO-56 Penman Monteith (FAO-56 PM), Turc, and Hargreaves (HG) methods for estimating daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo). The daily pooled climate data from 15 different locations under 4 different agro-ecological regions (AERs: semi-arid, arid, sub-humid, and humid) in India are used as an input to GWNN models. The inputs include three combinations of climate data (minimum and maximum air temperatures, minimum and maximum relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) and the target consists of the FAO-56 PM estimated ETo. Further, the GWNN models were applied to 15 individual model development locations and 10 different model testing locations to test the generalizing capability. Comparison of developed GWNN models was made with the classic generalized artificial neural network (GANN), generalized linear regression (GLR), generalized wavelet regression (GWR), and corresponding conventional methods to test the superiority of one model over the other. Results reveal that the GWNN models followed by GANN models performed better than GWR and GLR models for four AERs. The testing results suggest that the GWNN and GANN models have better generalizing capabilities than the GWR and GLR for almost all region locations."
