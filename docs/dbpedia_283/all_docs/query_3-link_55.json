To gain deeper insights into the epidemiological characteristics of BC in Iran, this study employs advanced geospatial techniques and feature selection methods to identify significant risk factors and spatial patterns associated with BC incidence.\n\nMethods\n\nUsing rigorous statistical methods, geospatial data from Iran, including cancer-related, sociodemographic, healthcare infrastructure, environmental, and air quality data at the provincial level, were meticulously analyzed. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) are calculated, and different regression models are used to identify significant variables associated with BC incidence. Spatial analysis techniques, including global and local Moran's index, geographically weighted regression, and Emerging hotspot analysis, were utilized to examine geospatial patterns, identify clustering and hotspots, and assess spatiotemporal distribution of BC incidence.\n\nResults\n\nThe findings reveal that BC predominantly affects women (98.03%), with higher incidence rates among those aged 50 to 79. Isfahan (ASR = 26.1) and Yazd (ASR = 25.7) exhibit the highest rates. Significant predictors of BC incidence, such as marriage, tertiary education attainment rate, physician-to-population ratio, and PM2.5 air pollution, are identified through regression models.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe study's results provide valuable information for the development of evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce the burden of BC in Iran. The findings underscore the importance of early detection, health education campaigns, and targeted interventions in high-risk clusters and adjacent regions. The geospatial insights generated by this study have implications for policy-makers, researchers, and public health practitioners, facilitating the formulation of effective BC prevention strategies tailored to the unique epidemiological patterns in Iran.\n\nHinweise\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at https://​doi.​org/​10.​1186/​s12885-023-11555-1.\n\nPublisher’s Note\n\nSpringer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.\n\nAbkürzungen\n\nBC\n\nBreast cancer\n\nSES\n\nSocioeconomic status\n\nGIS\n\nGeographical information system\n\nINPCR\n\nIran national population-based cancer registry\n\nSCI\n\nStatistical center of Iran\n\nNOCR\n\nNational office for civil registration\n\nAPMS\n\nAir pollution monitoring system of Iran\n\nICD-O\n\nInternational classification of disease for oncology\n\nCO2\n\nCarbon monoxide\n\nO3\n\nOzone\n\nNO2\n\nNitrogen dioxide\n\nSO2\n\nSulfur dioxide\n\nPM10\n\nParticulate matter of size ≤ 10 microns\n\nPM2.5\n\nParticulate matter of size ≤ 2.5 micron\n\nAQI\n\nAir quality index\n\nASR\n\nAge-standardized incidence rate\n\nVIF\n\nVariance inflation factor\n\nOLS\n\nOrdinary least squares\n\nRR\n\nRelative risks\n\nGWR\n\nGeographically weighted regression\n\nSR\n\nStandard residuals\n\nCI\n\nConfidence interval\n\nHH\n\nHigh-high\n\nLL\n\nLow-low\n\nHL\n\nHigh-low\n\nLH\n\nLow–high\n\nNS\n\nNot significant\n\nN\n\nNumber\n\nUAE\n\nUnited Arab Emirates"
