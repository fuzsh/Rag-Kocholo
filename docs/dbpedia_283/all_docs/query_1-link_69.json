        "text": "[PROVISIONAL TRANSLATION FROM Persian]\n\n[Translator’s notes appear in square brackets.]\n\n[Personal information has been redacted.]\n\n[The excerpt below is from the section of the article that pertains to the Baha’i Faith]\n\n[Newspaper:] Donya\n\n[Date:] 24 Azar 1334 [16 December 1955]\n\n[Issue No.:] 422\n\nWe publish for the first time the complete statistics of Baha’is, Jews and Iranian students living abroad and according to that, the total population of Iran is more than 20 million people.\n\nYou read the announcement of the minister of interior about the total population of Iran in the daily press.\n\nAccording to this declaration, the total population of Iran is 18,900,000 people, while, according to the offices of the General Statistics Office and the Population Office of the country, Iran’s population is more than 24 million people. This huge difference forced us to investigate the matter. It turned out that the statistics of the country’s population administration are somewhat correct, since the mentioned Office considers the identity cards as a criterion, and according to the identity cards in the hands of Iranians, the population of Iran is 24 million. But why has the population of Iran declined in the general census? That is because the statistics of Iranians living abroad have not been taken into consideration. And now we have the approximate statistics of Iranians living abroad and we mention it because all Iranians living abroad have ID cards, and the general census was conducted only inside the country. On this principle, the statistics of Iranians living abroad were not obtained….\n\n5,000 Baha’is are living in Haifa and Acre…\n\nMost interestingly, many in Tehran and other provinces identified themselves as Baha’is and in some cities, such as in Gilan Province, as statisticians did not write the name ‘Baha’i’ in the questionnaires, it led to clashes and riots. As in Rudsar, the Baha’is of that city sent a telegram with the name Baha’i to the Statistics Office and complained about the statisticians."
