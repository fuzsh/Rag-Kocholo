Main findings\n\nA severe drought in 1999 followed by an extreme drought in 2000 has proved to be a disastrous combination for the I.R. of Iran. The worst in 30 years, the drought has seriously affected 18 of the country’s 28 provinces, mostly in southern, eastern and central Iran.\n\nAccording to some estimates, all but the 3 northern provinces are experiencing a shortage of drinking water. Some 37 million people, or more than 50% of the population, are affected by the drought to varying degrees.\n\nThe drought disaster is placing an extreme strain on water resources, drinking water supply systems, livestock and agriculture. It is the cause of great hardship and human suffering, impacting vulnerable groups, particularly in rural areas, who have no alternative source of income and are still feeling the heavy losses they incurred last year.\n\nThe drought has adversely affected nearly all drinking water supply systems in both rural and urban areas. In over 70% of rural areas, the flow of water has been disrupted to varying degrees - from moderate to severe. Almost 80% of drinking-water wells suffer from low water yield, a drop in the water table, intrusion of salt water, or complete dryness.\n\nNational health authorities are carefully monitoring the health situation. Any epidemic or unusual occurrence of disease in drought-affected areas is diligently checked, particularly for cholera (Eltor). No major health concern of large proportion has thus far been detected. However, as serious water shortages and other drought-related conditions are likely to worsen, a favorable environment for sudden outbreaks of diarrhoeal and communicable diseases could be expected.\n\nAs the drought continues, affected population’s dependency on mobile and stationary water tankers will increase dramatically. In spite of efforts made by the authorities, the supply of water to open-air reservoirs by mobile-tankers increases the risk of water contamination.\n\nThe drought has caused agricultural losses of 2.8 million tons in wheat and 280,000 tons in barley, with an attendant loss of stubble as fodder resources. Areas normally sown to Alfalfa for hay for use by returning nomadic stocks are now almost non-existent.\n\nThe drought is severely impacting the number and productivity of commonly held livestock. This situation will worsen by early 2001, even with the advent of normal rain in November. Over 200,000 nomadic livestock herders have lost and are continuing to lose their only source of livelihood. Unless immediate measures are taken to arrest this loss, this population may be displaced.\n\nThe effects of drought on the livestock population will be felt beyond the immediate six months. An estimated 800,000 small animals have died already of malnutrition and disease, and further deaths from starvation and dehydration will occur during the short term. The loss in reproduction among the surviving stock this year will impact household returns. The loss of breeding females, both from private herds and the national inventory, will be felt for several years after the drought has broken.\n\nThe drought is producing a spectrum of serious negative impacts, and taking a tremendous toll on the environment. This disaster is affecting both human and natural environment. Many lakes and wetlands of international significance for waterfowl, registered sites protected by the Ramsar Convention, are severely damaged. Several of them have dried up completely.\n\nIf the current drought persists and the situation deteriorates, increased movement of displaced persons towards Iran can be expected. In particular, drought-affected populations from Afghanistan may cross the Iranian border in large numbers. These displaced villagers, who come to Iran in search of water and pasture, are considered drought victims and not refugees. This eventuality is a matter of serious concern for the Iranian authorities, a number of UN agencies, and the international community.\n\nWith the acute water shortage, it is estimated that over 60% of the rural population may be forced to migrate to cities. The migration may put city-dwellers that are susceptible to disease, especially children at much higher risk. Unable to afford the expenses associated with medical care, some people are forgoing it altogether. This forced rural-urban migration could have serious social, economic, political and environmental ramifications.\n\nThe overall drought situation in Iran may further worsen in the months to come, as summer temperatures continue to rise and rain is not expected until November. The enormous scope of the drought disaster is overwhelming the Government’s capabilities and resources, which are already over-stretched.\n\nb. Emergency Need for International Assistance\n\nImmediate donor response in the following areas will be critical to assist the most seriously affected populations.\n\nWater\n\nThe greatest need in the affected provinces is for drinking water. The magnitude of the water crisis is such that urgent donor response in support of the Government’s efforts is required. Priority needs include:\n\nA total of 10,000 mobile water tankers are required to deliver drinking water for rural, urban and nomadic populations, as well as for livestock. International assistance is requested to supply a minimum of 1,000 tankers with a capacity of 18-24 thousand litres.\n\n10,000 stationary tankers (e.g. plastic) of 5-10 thousand litres capacity.\n\n750 km of ductile iron, Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP), Heavy Duty Polyethylene (HDP), and PVC pipes for urban water supplies.\n\n1,800 km of HDP pipes for rural water supplies.\n\n2,000 chlorinators.\n\n10 tons raw material and resin to produce HDP and GRP\n\n100 chlorination gas cylinders.\n\n300 submersible electric pumps with the capacity of 40-100 litres per second and pumping head of 100-150 meters.\n\n400 submersible electric pumps with the capacity of 5-20 litres per second and pumping head of 50-100 meters.\n\n150 ultrasonic well water meters.\n\n100 leak detection instruments and accessories.\n\nChlorine powder, aluminum sulphide, ferric chloride, and poly chlorite.\n\n5 percussion well drilling machines.\n\n150 water analysis kits (chemical and biological).\n\n50 water bottling and packing units.\n\nExperts/consultants on water quality management and hydrology.\n\nLivestock/Agriculture\n\nThe second greatest need of the drought-affected population is for livestock and agricultural support. Priority needs include:\n\nWater tankers (up to 400 units. A minimum of 180 units for immediate assistance on the basis of an average of ten units for each affected province for provision of livestock water for immediate assistance)\n\n28 tons of multivitamin and mineral feed supplements on the basis of an allocation of two tons per province. The Veterinary Organization will provide specifications for these and the veterinary items (see below). The Ministry of Jihad will have responsibility for receipting them on arrival and arranging their distributing through its provincial veterinary organizations and through the livestock raisers cooperatives.\n\nUp to one million tons of grain barley to be assigned to the worst affected provinces and distributed through the cooperatives and under the administration of the Ministry of Jihad in proportion to the affected livestock units in each province.\n\nVeterinary supplies - preventive medicines (antibiotics and vaccines - 5 million doses of FMD vaccine), filaricides against TBD, and 60 tons of livestock insecticide and acaracides (Cyclometrine/Asuntol) for external parasite control.\n\nGrant assistance to provide medium-term loans to drought-affected livestock raisers.\n\nUp to 1,500 electric pumps ranging from 3-185kw for provision of water for agricultural holdings.\n\n100 electro-diesel pumps.\n\nGrant assistance to provide medium term loans to drought-affected livestock raisers.\n\nAs in any other disaster, it is understood that international assistance would not substitute the Government’s efforts, but supplement them in the most critical areas. In order to expedite delivery, local purchase of available items is recommended.\n\nMedical Supplies\n\nThe diagnostic laboratory kits for Tuberculoses, Cholera, Measles, Meningitis, Typhoid, Dysentery, Salmonelosis and Parasitic diseases;\n\nORS powder, IVFs;\n\nHypersonic Glucose Vial, Potassium Chloride and Bicarbonate Vials;\n\nPesticides and poisons for vector control;\n\nDrugs, including: Tetracycline, Doxycycline, Ciprefloxacin, TMP-SMX, Erythromicin, Furazolidone, Chloramphenicol, Ampicilin, Ceftriaxone, Cefotaxine, Ceftizoxime, Metronidazole, Iodoquinol, Diloxanidefurlate, Parmomycin, Penicillin, Diloxanidefurlate, Parmomycin, Penicillin G, Gentamycin, Chloroquine, Primaquine, Quinine, Quinidine, Permethrine, (5%, 1%), Lindane, Malathione (0.5%), Ophthalmic Ointment Tetracycline, Clootimazole cream, Miconazole cream, Immune Globulin, Vitamin A Preparation, Botulism trivalent equine antitoxin.\n\nConstraints\n\nThe greatest constraint is time. To be effective, international assistance should be provided practically immediately.\n\nDonors can make their contributions directly to the Iranian Government or to relevant UN agencies (Annex VI). The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is prepared to serve as a channel for unearmarked contributions to be used for relief assistance. These will then be allocated in consultation with the Government of Iran and relevant organizations in the United Nations system. Funds should be transferred to OCHA account No. CO-590.160.0, Swift code: UBSWCHZ12A at the UBS AG, P.O. Box 2770, CH-1211 Geneva 2, with reference: OCHA - Iran - Drought. OCHA provides donors with written confirmation and pertinent details concerning the utilization of the funds contributed. For coordination purposes, donors are requested to inform OCHA Geneva of bilateral relief missions/pledges/contributions and their corresponding values by item.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\na. Regional Context\n\nCentral and South Asia are currently suffering from severe drought. The countries most affected are Afghanistan, India, I.R. of Iran, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Additionally, Mongolia, northern and western China, Iraq, Uzbekistan, Syria and Jordan are experience drought conditions, giving the drought a regional aspect. Drought is now considered to be a recurring phenomenon in the region. Making sustainable long-term solutions and mitigation programmes a regional and country-specific requirement. Also, emergency relief operations are called for to address specific requirements of each affected country.\n\nb. Drought Situation in the I. R. of Iran\n\nA severe drought in 1999 followed by an extreme drought in 2000 has proved a disastrous combination for Iran. It has affected 18 of the country’s 28 provinces, mostly in southern, eastern and central areas. According to some estimates, all but 3 northern provinces now have a shortage of drinking water, while some 37 million people, or more than 50% of the population are affected to varying degrees.\n\nThe crisis is compounded by other factors, including population growth, an increased level of food requirements, an increase in cultivated land, and an increase in the number of livestock. Together with the present drought situation, these factors have placed an extreme strain on water resources both for potable and agricultural uses. The shortage of water is leading to human suffering and greater hardships among more of the population. In particular, it has seriously affected the most vulnerable groups, particularly the nomadic population and others living in the rural areas.\n\nAs summer temperatures continue to rise and rains are not expected until November, the situation may worsen and turn into a disaster in the months to come. Even if sporadic or regular rainfall materializes, it will only decrease the likelihood of longer-term damages, while the present situation is unlikely to change. The magnitude of the drought is overwhelming. In spite of the Government’s efforts, its resources are already over-stretched.\n\nc. Technical Mission by the United Nations\n\nSubsequent to the information provided by the Government on damages as a result of the extreme drought, the UN Resident Coordinator issued a short press release on the drought situation on 9 May 2000. In late May, two staff member from UNDP and FAO in Tehran visited four of the hardest-hit provinces (Sistan-Baluchestan, Ilam, Khuzestan and Khorasan). Their mission report and related videotapes confirmed the seriousness of the situation and indicated that the drought was intensifying. A UN Inter-Agency Task Force on Drought was established in I.R. of Iran to monitor the situation closely and to facilitate coordination among UN agencies in the I.R. of Iran. In Geneva, the UN Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) formed a Drought Task Force to monitor the drought situation in Asia. It is chaired by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) of the United Nations.\n\nRecognizing the severity of the situation, the United Nations and the Government jointly agreed to field an inter-agency needs assessment mission, as well as to provide some limited logistics support and relief items. UNDP covered part of the cost of the mission under a project that was approved on 17 July 2000 with a total UNDP contribution of US $85,000. OCHA, UNICEF, FAO, WHO and UNESCO also participated and contributed financially. It is hoped that the mission will help raise awareness of the serious situation and generate international support to complement the Government’s efforts.\n\nThe mission, which was led by a representative of OCHA and comprised of representatives from the participating agencies, visited the I.R. of Iran from 23 July to 5 August 2000 and reported its findings to the international community. The mission was comprised of Mr. Vladimir Sakharov (OCHA) team leader, Dr. Kewmars Khosh-Chasm (WHO) health expert, Dr. Mandana Askarinasab (UNICEF) Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, Dr. Frederik Hendrik Verhoog (UNESCO) hydrologist, and Mr. Rodrick Oliver Kennard (FAO) consultant livestock expert. The mission was accompanied in the field by Mr. Hassan Azadeh from the Disaster Task force of the Ministry of Interior, and Mahmoud Yazdi of the Ministry of Interior. Mr. Haoliang Xu, UNDP Deputy Resident Representative coordinated the exercise with the support of Dr. Soudabeh Amiri, UNDP Consultant. Field visits were limited by time to the three provinces of Hormozgan, Fars and Yazd. These were considered representative enough of the overall situation, and enabled the mission to obtain a reasonably representative view of the drought throughout Iran. The following main activities were carried out in a limited amount of time:\n\nreviewed the existing data and information available on the drought\n\nmet with relevant central and provincial authorities.\n\nvisited the hardest hit provinces to assess immediate requirements.\n\nanalyzed the effect of drought-related factors on relevant technical sectors.\n\nidentified needs for immediate international assistance.\n\nformulated proposals for a medium and long-term strategy to mitigate the impact of future droughts.\n\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and UNDP Office in Tehran prepared the ground for the mission and backstopped the mission. This report was prepared in close collaboration with all UN partners present in Tehran, and in consultation with relevant national authorities.\n\nII. STATUS OF THE DROUGHT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\n\na. Precipitation and Water Resources\n\nThe precipitation in Iran occurs almost exclusively in winter and early spring, the climate is thus Mediterranean rather than Central Asian. Annual rainfall is an average 252-mm annually, ranging from less than 50 mm in the deserts to more than 1600 mm on the Caspian plain. Most rivers are small and steep and those in the interior of the country end in desert depressions. The Karun River, which with a length of 890 km is the largest, is the only navigable river. Most rivers are seasonal. Approximately 90% of the country is arid to semi-arid. Summer and winter temperature ranges are extreme. The winter temperatures in the mountains are very low and precipitation there is mostly snow. The snow can and in some cases does melt very quickly, causing destructive flash floods and the disappearance of precious surface and groundwater reserves.\n\nPrecipitation has been far below average for the second consecutive year in most parts of the country. For the hydrological year 1999-2000 it was only 62% (132 mm) of the normal average (212 mm), following the already low 1998-99 figure of 81%. These figures do not fully depict the severity of the diminishing precipitation, nor within-and-between-regional discrepancies - this year, in large parts of Yazd and Sistan-Baluchestan precipitation was less than 50 mm. Within regions there were also some areas where no rain has fallen for the last 30 months. The statistical probability of such a drought occurring is once every 30 years.\n\nThe surface water flows mainly between January and mid-April. The data shows a substantial decline for this year, and depending on location of the basin measured, ranged from 40% to 92%. The river flows that were already low in 1999 have declined further in 2000. The loss of surface flow has impacted negatively on water storage in behind-dam reservoirs and in the replenishment of underground aquifers. The eastern part of the country has been most affected.\n\nGroundwater was also replenished much less in the present hydrological year, due to lower precipitation and the exceptionally quick snowmelt during a warm period in April. The worst hit regions are those in the east, south and southeast regions where reserves are at extremely low levels and in several areas are completely exhausted. In southern Fars the groundwater has become saline and in Yazd, 2500 qanats are completely dry. In these provinces there is much less water available for agriculture. The situation is also serious in the central provinces. In short, the regions most affected by water shortages are: southern Sistan-Baluchestan, western Hormozgan, eastern Fars, western Karman, most of Yazd and parts of central Isfahan. Less seriously, but still badly affected are areas around Orumieh lake, the Markazi province, and adjoining regions in the neighboring provinces of Tehran and Semnan, northeastern Iran as a whole, and Khorasan in particular.\n\nMap 2 attached depicts the present seriousness of the situation. A more complete picture of the impact of the drought from a hydrological and water resources perspective is provided in Annex 2.\n\nb. Health and Drinking Water Supply\n\nHealth\n\nAvailable data indicate that to date there is no particular epidemic as a result of the drought. However, due to the magnitude of disruption to supply systems for safe drinking water in the rural areas, the population is exposed to higher risks of enteric, diarrhoeal and water born diseases particularly in Hormozgan, Southern Fars and Yazd. Some reports indicate cases of skin and eye infections due to the lack of adequate water and consequent deterioration of sanitary conditions. The poor condition of livestock and the number of animals infected with enteric and skin parasites increase the probability of zoonotic diseases among drought-affected people. The risk of deteriorating health and increasing child and maternal morbidity and mortality is also increasing due to pre-existing malnutrition in the under-developed areas of some provinces,\n\nWith exception of diarrhoeal diseases and measles to some extent, there is no evidence of a changing pattern in other diseases such as meningitis and respiratory tract infection. In general however, the drought has adversely affected the epidemiological pattern of certain communicable and contagious disease within and outside the borders of Iran. As a regional phenomenon the drought has forced the migration of drought victims to neighboring countries. Considering this and the general weakening of natural immunity, the risk of epidemic is likely to worsen if the situation continues.\n\nDrinking Water Supply\n\nPrior to the deterioration of conditions, close to 96% of urban and 87% of the rural population had access to safe drinking water. More than 700 piped-water networks were supplying disinfected water at an average rate of 200-300 litres per person per day in the urban areas, while over 10,000 piped-water networks and individual piping systems supplied an average of 150 litres per person per day in the rural areas. There has been a severe drop in water per capita provided both through the urban and the rural water supply systems. The quantity of urban water supply has now fallen between 10-90% while on average, the quantity of water now supplied in urban areas has fallen by an estimated 30%, or a reduction of 1.8 billion cubic meters annually.\n\nBesides reduced quantity, the lack of surface water flow and ground water recharge has resulted in a deterioration in the water quality of surface and ground water and in many cities drinking water is rapidly becoming less potable. In the larger cities such as Abadan, Khoramshahr, Qom, and Zahedan, the capacity of urban water supply has been substantially lost.\n\nOut of the 700 urban water supply networks, 94 suffer from severe water shortages, and as such unable to supply sufficient water to approximately 5.6 million people. More cities are likely to fall into the water-scarce category during the 3rd quarter of 2000, and encounter water crisis. Since in all probability there will be no substantial rainfall from now until November, more than 10 million urban dwellers are expected to face some forms of water shortage by the end of September 2000. Tehran water authorities have begun issuing warnings that the city and its environs will face serious shortages starting next month.\n\nCurrently the populations of many towns and cities in the south are supplied by mobile water-tankers. The reliance on tankered water is expected to increase drastically in the next two months. In the hardest hit provinces such as Sistan-Baluchestan, there is now water rationing.\n\nIn the rural areas, many wells, springs and streams have gone completely dry and the situation there is much worse. About 4.4 million persons in 6,538 villages in 21 provinces who are served by 3,287 water systems are now affected. Due to severe water shortages, these water supply systems are no longer able to provide adequate water. If this rapid pattern continues, over 7,000 piped water systems will have failed by the end of September.\n\nConsequences of the drought on drinking water supply\n\nFalling water tables, reducing water yields from wells and failure of water supply systems have created a water crisis in many drought-affected areas. There are reduced river flows and an inability to harvest water for water supply systems has compounded the problem. The drought has affected 9,136 qanats (underground water canals), 3,721 springs and a large number of wells in Khorasan province alone. More than 475 rural water supply systems in the Fars province have also been severely affected.\n\nRivers and streams are no longer moving and the stagnant pools they have become are increasingly polluted. In the southern provinces and elsewhere, the traditional water cisterns (Berkeh) built on seasonal floodwater beds are almost dry. The residues of polluted water remaining in these cisterns are used for drinking purposes because there is no other alternative. This poses a severe health risk. Water in some aquifers has become undrinkable.\n\nLarge number of cities and villages are relying on water tankers to meet minimum water needs. More than 300 villages and approximately 140,000 people in Hormozgan province alone now rely entirely on tankers. As water shortages become more general, this reliance on tankers must increase. Sistan-Baluchestan, Khorasan, Hormozgan, Fars, and Yazd) are the provinces most severely affected by shortages of safe drinking water. Serving villagers with mobile and stationary water tankers has become arduous and expensive. It is felt that there are no alternatives for an urgent provision of potable water.\n\nTankered water is sometimes only provided at specified times or on certain days. This intermittent system of supply increases the risk of contamination. The rationing, by forcing households to store water in whatever containers are available, increases the risk that improper containers are used.\n\nDelivery by tankers increases the probability of water contamination and as a health threat, is a concern of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME). MOHME has identified deterioration in drinking water quality, for example in rural Kermanshah province, since the drought began. Out of the 757 rural drinking water samples tested there, 43% had bacteriological contamination. Similar tests conducted in Fars indicated levels of contamination as high as 33%.\n\nProvincial authorities are forced to cover the cost of water transportation by tankers and people are paying $0.75 per cubic meters, which for a drought-affected family is an exorbitant cost. The drought has demonstrated the fragility and precariousness of water resources used for water supply. Since majorities of the water networks are affected and the level of vulnerability goes across the board, there appears to be a need to review the rationale and standards for water resource planning and programming.\n\nBeing cognizant of its importance, the national authorities have already begun evaluating their present plans and programmes and are devising long-term strategies to mitigate water shortages. For instance, in some regions water is pumped from long distances away to the targeted areas sometimes from several hundred kilometers. Naturally such schemes require huge investments.\n\nA large number of such schemes are already under construction. Due to the lack of funds and required materials (e.g. pumps, pipes, fixtures, etc.), many are not progressing as planned. Presently the provincial and local authorities are severely short of budgets, credits and financial facilities to cope with the minimum needs of the drought-affected people.\n\nThe authorities are concentrating on locating tankers to augment the heavily damaged water supply systems to cope with the immediate water shortages caused by the drought. The emergency operation has forced the postponement or at least temporary shut down of long-term development of water supply projects.\n\nc. Livestock and Agriculture\n\nLivestock\n\nLivestock provide the livelihood of persons engaged in commercial sheep fattening, dairy cattle and poultry and they are the main support base for large numbers of nomadic livestock herders. The Government estimates the population of sheep and goats at 81 million heads, with nomadic sheep and goats comprising 80% of these. There are about eight million native and improved cattle. The native cattle are raised by the nomads mainly, as are camels, although some cattle (dairy and fattening) are also held by sedentary livestock raisers in the peri-urban areas. Poultry are raised commercially in specialized enterprises for meat and eggs.\n\nNomads constitute the majority of livestock raising families who rely on the rangeland entirely, occupying rangeland in twenty out of the 28 provinces in the country. An estimated 1.3 million persons in 200,000 nomadic households are dependent on the range to some extent, owning between them about 22.5 million livestock, which with the exception of some cattle, are almost entirely sheep and goats. Their flocks may have as many as 500 animals, with some seen by the mission having upwards of two thousand sheep and goats. These households rely entirely on their animals for their living, normally deriving income from the sale of milk, cheese, wool and mohair, and from the sale of fattened spring lambs. The Organization of Nomadic Affairs in the Ministry of Jihad reports 85% of these livestock to be drought affected. The other rangeland users, whose reliance on it the Ministry of Jihad reports as varying between five and 90% of feed needs, are the traditional sedentary sheep producers.\n\nThe IRI has approximately 90 million hectares of rangeland, distributed among all of the provinces. It varies considerably in quality and thus its capacity to support animals. Figures released by the Technical Bureau of Range Management within the Ministry of Jihad, show that the area, quality and productivity of the rangeland has declined substantially in recent years. Its total reported area in 1963 was 100 million hectares and it had a quality which ranged from good (450 kg. annual DM/ha/annum) to poor (30 kg. DM/ha/annum), producing an estimated 14 million tons of dry matter overall. The 1980 records, which are the most recent, show a ten percent loss in the overall rangeland area and a fall in productivity to 10 million tons of DM, as well as a per-hectare loss of productivity for all three rangeland classes since 1963. In spite of efforts to arrest this decline, the Technical Bureau estimates that poor quality rangeland has increased further to 43 percent of the total, while the area of first grade rangeland is down to just over nine million hectares, or less than half of the 1963 figure.\n\nRangeland Characteristics in Iran (1963-2000)\n\nSource: Forest and Range Organization, Technical Bureau for Range management, Ministry of Jihad.\n\nBecause it is considered by its users as a ‘free’ resource, most sheep and goats and some camels are raised on these seasonal pastures for as long as possible throughout the year. This is often year-round. In general these animals are moved between summer and winter rangeland areas for part of the year, and they are grazed on crop stubble and are hand-fed on the agricultural areas during the remainder, availability permitting. Their reliance on supplementary feeding and crop residues versus grazing varies between areas and depends on the quality of rangeland and the local availability of crop residues. Data developed in its five-province study by the Technical Institute suggest that 230 sheep units, each of 40-kg liveweight, need 530 hectares of rangeland to support them for eight months of the year. Compared with the 90-million hectares of rangeland available, the national flock requires at least 180 million hectares to support them for this period at this stocking intensity, and more than 270 million hectares if they are supported on the rangeland year-round. At these figures, and ignoring the feed demands of camels and nomadic cattle, the national rangeland in good seasons is probably overstocked by a factor of more than three hundred percent.\n\nBesides nomadic livestock production, commercial sheep and goat fattening, and dairy production, are also practiced in those provinces which have reasonable areas of irrigated agriculture. This more intensive raising of livestock relies on the locally produced alfalfa hay, wheat straw and sugar beet pulp, some of which may be imported from other provinces such as Isfahan. In Yazd province for example, the large numbers of dairy cattle and poultry there are fed with locally produced maize, wheat bran and barley, supplemented with some imported grain and concentrates. The poultry sector in Yazd is supported similarly on local and imported feed grains, but it also relies on imported Soya-bean and fishmeal.\n\nEffects of Drought on Livestock Production\n\nRainfall during the twelve months 1998-1999 was substantially less than the 30-year average. Water tables have fallen beyond the reach of pumps and bores, and wells for drinking and stock water are rapidly becoming dry. A number of streams and rivers normally providing enough summer flow for stock water and irrigation purposes have reduced to a trickle. The watering points have remained usable only by excavating the dry riverbeds. As wells are becoming brackish, further consumption of stock and irrigation water during the next three months, until the expected rains in November, will result in more of these sources of stock water failing entirely.\n\nThe present shortage is compounded by the wide geographical distribution of livestock raisers, making it impossible to supply stock water to all of the animals affected. While the provincial authorities are providing some stock by tanker now, they already have considerable logistical difficulties in supplying water in this way, and this situation will worsen as more watering points fail.\n\nThe rangeland is without most of its vegetation, in some areas is severely degraded and in general cannot sustain the livestock numbers even of two years ago. Official estimates classify all of the rangeland in the worst affected provinces (Khorasan, Sistan-Baluchestan), as poor to extremely poor, with average vegetation coverage down to as little as 12% - this comprising mainly low salt-bush and standing artemesia spp. which is dry and weathered and without nutritional value. In the higher elevation where ground cover is usually good throughout the year, it is completely non-existent. By the end of 1999, the production of dry matter (DM) on rangeland in Khorasan had reportedly fallen by two thirds to 20 kg. per hectare, down from the 63 kg per hectare production of normal years. Mission observation of rangeland vegetation in Hormozgan, Khuzestan, Fars and Yazd provinces, indicate a further loss of dry matter for the first six months of 2000. Losses of similar magnitude are likely on the rangeland of other provinces.\n\nSuch overgrazing and drought has contributed substantially to rangeland degradation. New grass cover has failed to develop and establish with the little rain that occurred in late 1999 or having developed, the new growth was grazed before it became mature. With the little vegetative cover the rangeland now has generally, it is considerably more exposed to the risk of erosion by wind and water. The reduction in rangeland grazing and the failure of stock watering points has forced livestock raisers to congregate around the watering points which are still functioning. This has further degraded localized areas of rangeland in their immediate vicinity.\n\nThere are no available data on the number of households affected by the drought, although it is clear that drought is affecting more people daily. In the areas where the drought has been most severe, it has impacted critically both on livestock and the incomes of livestock raisers, particularly those of the nomads. The mission interviewed households in Hormozgan Province which reported having lost between half and all of their livestock, while some villages in the same province even camels were dying and almost no livestock remained. Raisers in the agricultural areas of Yazd consistently report this year’s lamb crop to be down by up to fifty percent of normal production. Local government in Khuzestan estimates that five percent of surviving lambs have been sold underweight to date and have had to be disposed of well before their normal turnoff age of six months. The Government also states that liveweights among surviving animals are down by about eight percent. Where the drought has been most severe, the households already affected are in considerable difficulty, with neither agriculture nor livestock to support them.\n\nThe effect of the drought on livestock has not been uniform between provinces and between areas in the same provinces. There is little feed and water in Hormozgan, Southern Khorasan, Northern Sistan-Baluchestan provinces and elsewhere, where deaths from starvation and lack of water have been most commonly reported and raisers in some cases have lost all of their animals. In Yazd and Fars provinces however, few deaths from starvation have been reported although enforced sales have been common and production and liveweights are down. Real losses in these and the provinces where irrigated agriculture continues will be deferred until feed and water supplies for agricultural purposes fail entirely.\n\nOn government data and information the mission obtained during field interviews, it has been difficult to arrive at a fair estimate of the proportion and number of animals which have died during in the drought so far. The Government puts the national level of sheep and goat deaths at over 800,000 head, or a negligible one percent of all small ruminants. Farmer interviews on the other hand, suggest that individual flock losses lie anywhere between 20 and 100 percent, both of lambs and adults. If losses on this scale are the norm, the official figures have underestimated the real position greatly. However, while it is certainly true that some raisers have lost their flocks entirely and others have lost or sold up to half their animals, losses of this magnitude may not have been widespread and it is difficult on available evidence to form the conclusion that such whole-flock mortality has been common. It is certainly true that flocks of up to 2,000 animals are still in evidence and flocks of between two and five hundred animals are common - but this is known with certainty only in the provinces the mission visited. Against these considerations and imperfect data, and given that individual flocks have been reduced considerably over wide areas, a more appropriate provisional figure for mortality so far, probably lies between one and ten percent of all livestock.\n\nFeed supplies will disappear over the short-term and stock will have to walk longer distances to water as watering points fail, making more deaths from starvation and lack of water likely as the drought continues. These losses will accelerate now that having lost their body reserves, the survival of most animals now depends only on the feed available. The feed resources which might otherwise have carried present livestock until after the rains, will be severely tested with the influx of nomadic raisers moving down from winter to summer pasture over the next few weeks.\n\nOn the longer-term, the sector will be effected more by factors which relate to the number of breeding females remaining, and by their ability to reproduce effectively, than by the immediate loss of the animals which have already died. Of greatest significance, is that the sheep and goats are generally in poor condition and their condition is worsening by the day Depending on province, veterinary authorities in the Ministry of Jihad report having to destroy between 30 and 50 percent of sheep and goats purchased in the buyback programme, because of emaciation.. The poor condition of the breeding females means that fewer than usual will conceive in autumn, and the lamb crop the spring following will be smaller Ministry of Jihad estimates at least 20% fewer conceptions.. The ewes which lamb will do so in poor condition. They will also milk poorly and many of their lambs may starve.\n\nThe government buyback programme has absorbed 1.2 million sheep and goats thus far, while private fatteners have also taken an estimated two million head for fattening and slaughter. For the most part these animals have been the less useful aged breeders and surplus males and their removal has allowed the flocks to retain a higher than usual proportion of female breeders, while reducing pressure on the rangeland and to some extent, supporting liveweight prices. This has enabled some female to be retained, but they are now beginning to be sold, and are entering the fattening units in increasing numbers. The mission was shown units in Yazd holding as many as 800 ewes. These, and females in similar units will be slaughtered and lost the national flock, while with the increasing loss of feed, more are also likely to starve outside the units. Either way, significant numbers of breeding females are likely to have been lost to the national flock by the time the drought ends. With smaller individual flocks post-drought, livestock raisers will find it difficult to recover their livelihood for some time. From a smaller national breeding base, it will also be increasingly difficult for the country to match local production of red meat with the demand for it domestically.\n\nThe feed shortage during the last twelve months has resulted in a smaller than normal lamb crop and fewer surviving lambs in the spring. The Government provided the mission with figures suggesting that a 40% reduction in offtake had already occurred in 1999. Farmer interviews in a number of provinces also confirm losses of this magnitude. Milk production is also reported down by 70% in more than half the national flock, while rising feed prices and falling revenues have also meant that household incomes are lower. The price of grain barley has doubled to over US$130 per ton during the past year, Alfalfa hay to US$135, and wheat straw has also doubled to US$36 per ton. Livestock raisers who would normally buy grain and hay for summer and autumn feeding, now find they cannot. Some raisers interviewed have sold their stock entirely because of this, or are being forced to sell a few animals at a time to feed the remainder. The increased feed prices have also made dairy production, lamb and cattle fattening and poultry production enterprises unprofitable also. While a number of commercial production units are still operating now, at present input/output cost ratios the owners of a number the mission visited, are facing closure.\n\nNomadic livestock are reported to be moving into Iran from Pakistan and Afghanistan in large numbers. This movement has increased the risk of epidemic disease outbreaks (FMD There is concern on the part of veterinary authorities that the SAT2 viral strain of FMD may be introduced. and rinderpest in cattle, PPR and FMD in sheep and goats). The Government is confident that with the exception of PPR, the risk to Iran from most of these diseases has been largely contained as a result of its interventions. The Government considers the main threat of FMD to be from both the Arab and Kurdish areas of Iraq, although little drought-related livestock movement into Iran from Iraq has been reported to date. About half of all small ruminants are vaccinated against enterotoxaemia and significant numbers of large and small ruminants are dipped or sprayed against external parasites. The dippings are on the rise in direct response to the increased parasite burdens the weakened livestock are carrying. With ticks and tick borne diseases (TBD) increasing, government is also concerned about the developing resistance of blood parasites to the chemicals normally used in treating TBD. In respect of TBD, the Ministry of Health also reports a rise in the number of cases of Congo-Crimea-Fever.\n\nAgriculture\n\nA total of 14.3 million hectares are under cultivation. Of these, 12.7 million hectares are annual crops and 1.6 million hectares are permanent crops. Rain-fed agriculture is practiced over 6.3 million hectares, but a lack of rainfall precludes cultivation in many areas.\n\nSome 7.9 million hectares, or about half of the total arable land in I.R. of Iran is irrigated from groundwater. Water for irrigation is the single most important factor for cultivation. About 70% of landholders have less than 5.5 hectares, of which less than half on average is irrigated. Most of these small-scale farmers cultivate marginal lands limited by slope and erosion. Wheat and barley comprise about 43% and 13%, respectively, of the total irrigated and dry land arable areas, while fodder crops, particularly Alfalfa, are about seven percent. Most of the latter is based on irrigation.\n\nThe Government is pursuing policies aiming at self-sufficiency in basic foods while maintaining low consumer prices. Cropping inputs are subsidized, although the subsidies are being slowly phased out. In addition to the adverse effect of water shortage, the sector has also been hampered by other constraints including excessive bureaucracy, restrictive trade policies and lack of up to date farming techniques.\n\nEffects of Drought on Agriculture\n\nAt the outset, it is noteworthy that while the impact of the drought is greatest on the agriculture sector, the effects are generally more developmental with long-lasting adverse consequences. There are also some immediate hindrances caused by the drought.\n\nThe drought has affected both the rain-fed and irrigated areas. The most affected provinces in 1998-99 were in the west and north of the country, notably West Azerbaijan, Kurdestan, Zanjan, Ardebil, Kermanshah, Gilan, Lorestan and Markazi. Irrigated and rain-fed wheat and barley for that year were about 6 million and 2 million hectares, respectively, while production was down by 4.3 million and 0.8 million tons. Fodder crop plantings were just below one million hectares for the year. The drought was more extensive during 1999-2000. Wheat and barley plantings for the year were 4.9 million and 1.5 million hectares (80% and 75% of the previous year’s areas), while production was down by 2.8 million and 280,000 tons respectively from the 1998-99 level.\n\nWhile grain production has been lower for the last two years, the area of available crop stubble for use as fodder has also been proportionately less. Areas normally sown to Alfalfa for hay used by returning nomadic stock are smaller. Production of Alfalfa is down 38% to 4.1 million tons. The decrease of production is greatest in the hardest hit provinces. For example, the authorities in two of the provinces visited indicated that the supplies of alfalfa and wheat straw are imported into Yazd and Fars from other provinces. These factors have resulted in the price hikes as the prices of grain barley and Alfalfa hay are doubling over the last twelve months. These feedstuffs are reported to be unprocurable or too expensive in some of the affected areas. Livestock raisers in Yazd province report the areas of wheat stubble as being adequate to supply only one fifth of their requirements.\n\nd. Environment Impact\n\nThe drought is producing a spectrum of serious negative impacts and taking a tremendous toll on the human and natural environments. The most significant negative effect on the human environment is increased air pollution. Unusual high levels of total suspended particles (TSP) have covered large areas. This is considered to be a consequence of the regional drought problem and it seems that the high TSP levels are also due to winds from the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe worst damaged elements of the natural environment are the fresh water ecosystems and habitats, wetlands, vegetation and biodiversity with adverse effects on protected areas. Most rivers and lakes in the affected provinces are drying up, or have already disappeared. The impact and severity of the extremely low water flows is becoming much more apparent. Lower levels of oxygen are putting fish at risk in the water domains that still exist. Habitats are disappearing and ecosystems are becoming unhealthy. The aquatic life forming part of these ecosystems has disappeared or is under extreme stress due to the loss of habitat.\n\nMost lakes and wetlands of international significance for waterfowl, registered as protected Ramsar Sites, are severely damaged. Several have already dried up. Among them are Bakhtegan-Nairiz, Hamoun-e-Saberi, South end of Hamoun-e-puzak, and Gavkhouni.\n\nTrans-boundary rivers have also been adversely affected. In particular, the Hirmand river originating in Afghanistan has been completely dry for the past five months. Consequently, the Sistan region that depends mostly on Hirmand for its water supply has lost its primary mater source. In addition, Hamoon, a large lake in Sistan-Baluchestan that normally receives water from Hirmand has disappeared completely. This lake formerly irrigated some 650,000 hectares of agricultural land.\n\nSeveral other important ecological areas are severely damaged. An estimated 9.6 million hectares of forest and woodlands are endangered, while important afforestation programmes and projects to combat desertification, carried out by central and provincial authorities, are at risk. Another potentially harmful result of the present drought is diminished vegetation cover that could cause serious floods in many regions, when rains arrive in the spring.\n\ne. Trans-boundary migration\n\nTrans-boundary migration of population and movements of livestock have been reported. With further deterioration of the present situation, increased movement of affected people from neighboring countries towards I.R. of Iran may be expected. In particular, drought-affected populations and their livestock from Afghanistan may cross the I.R. of Iranian borders in larger numbers. This will undoubtedly exacerbate the already serious water and fodder shortages in the region and put even more pressure on the ecosystem. These displaced villagers, who come to I.R. of Iran in search of water and pasture, are considered as drought victims and not refugees. Consequently, no traditional refugee protection is provided to them. This eventuality is a matter of serious concern for the I.R. of Iranian authorities, a number of UN agencies, and the international community at large.\n\nIII. NATIONAL RESPONSES TO DATE\n\na. Institutional Set-up to Cope with the Drought\n\nNational Structure\n\nEmergency relief operations in the I.R. of Iran are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior through its national Disaster Task Force (DTF), whilst emergency relief response across sectors are the responsibility of the appropriate line ministries, coordinated by the DTF. If a disaster is classified as being of national significance, the national DTF takes control. If necessary, it can call upon other Government authorities such as the military to assist with relief operations.\n\nProvincial/Regional Structure\n\nThe national structure of the Ministry of the Interior is mirrored at provincial level. The Governor General and his heads of department comprise the provincial DTF, which coordinates disaster response and relief from within the province, as well as other aid entering it. The main activities of the post-disaster reconstruction programmes as well as the funding for them are also controlled at this level. If the magnitude of a disaster is sufficiently large, there is a formal arrangement for neighboring provinces to respond to assist an affected area. As soon as a disaster is notified, the neighboring areas are obliged to respond.\n\nLocal (District) Structure\n\nEach district in I.R. of Iran is headed by a governor, who reports to the Governor General of the province and has a number of sub-district governors. The district-level DTFs have a key role in managing the immediate search and rescue operation and the relief phase which follows. The governors play a key motivating role, mobilizing resources both within and from outside respective districts, as required.\n\nThe Red Crescent Society of the I.R. of Iran (RCSI)\n\nRCSI is one of the main implementers who carry out the relief work to provide assistance to the affected population. It is organized in a structure similar to the DTF, with national, regional and local representation.\n\nb. National Emergency Relief and Budgetary Provisions\n\nGeneral\n\nFor the current drought crisis, the Government has concentrated its efforts on providing water tankers and domestic water purifiers to meet the immediate needs of people and livestock. There are also provisions of emergency food supplies for the most seriously affected populations, especially the nomads. Emergency fodder supplies for livestock, as well as the Government’s procurement programmes to minimize livestock losses are among the other relief measures taken. The Government has also approved a US$ 290 million emergency aid package, which will be delivered primarily in the form of loans and grants. However, it may take some time for such loans/grants to reach the intended populations.\n\nHealth\n\nWhile the health sector is strengthening its water quality surveillance programme in badly affected provinces, there is still a need for additional effort to ensure the safety of drinking water. Particularly, where the community relies on rainwater collection and cisterns for drinking water supply, there is a greater need for water quality surveillance.\n\nThe MOHME has established an emergency drought committee for all health-related aspects of the drought in all provinces. They have provided special training for the health staff. Such training programmes have to be strengthened and more systematic for nationwide application.\n\nThe health sector, as a part of its expanded and effective primary health system, is diligent in its efforts to detect any cases of communicable diseases particularly Cholera (Eltor). Greater attention to drought-related diseases will strengthen the current remedial actions taken by the health authorities to improve the disease control programmes.\n\nWater Supply\n\nDue to water shortages caused by the drought, there are pressure disturbances in the urban water supply system leaving some areas without water. As an immediate remedial measure, urban water supply authorities have devised many engineering and system management techniques to ensure equitable water distribution to as many areas within each city as possible. Other measures including water rationing during the day and storing during the night. Repairing linkages in fixtures have been also adopted. Many new wells have been drilled and the existing wells have been deepened. The traditional Qanat water structures have been repaired or augmented and more water is being pumped from the rivers. Water intakes from rivers are shifted to other sections of the river to maintain water quality. Greater reliance on use of mobile and stationary water tankers is another major emergency response for water distribution in both urban and rural areas.\n\nResettlement of Nomadic Population\n\nThe local authorities are encouraging some nomadic populations to be resettled in areas closer to major roads. Such temporary settlements greatly facilitate provision of water and other essential items required by the drought-affected nomadic population. However, taking into account traditional nomadic lifestyle, customs, practices and other ethnic differences, while quite effective, such resettlement programmes can be carried out only on a limited scale. Greater sustainable incentives have to be introduced using community-based participatory approaches.\n\nLivestock\n\nThe Government has responded to the effect of the drought on livestock through:\n\nBuyback schemes for drought affected sheep and goats to a maximum of two million animals nation-wide. A total of 1.2 million animals have been purchased and killed, or fattened and slaughtered for meat production to date at a total cost of 250-300 billion Rials (US$30.5 - 36. million). In combination with private purchase and slaughter, there is a removal programme. Under this programme, it is expected that five million animals will be removed from the national flock.\n\nProvision of emergency feed. The Government normally imports 600,000 tons of grain for livestock support, in addition to local production, and has approved an additional 300,000 tons as immediate drought support. Between 250 and 300,000 tons have already been distributed and a further 300,000 tons are on order. The domestic emergency drought requirements are in the order of one million tons for 1999/2000, leaving a demand shortfall of about 700,000 tons. The Government has not yet allocated funds for the grain, which has been arranged and financed by the Livestock Support Unit of the Ministry of Jihad.\n\nProvision of drinking water by tankers to remote livestock areas.\n\nProvision of loans to livestock raisers giving them an opportunity to defer paybacks. In addition, small loans at subsidized interest rates (10%) are provided through local Ministry of Jihad offices to some livestock raisers. At the time of the mission, the loans were for one year to a to a ceiling of US$ 1,000.\n\nProvision of veterinary medicines and vaccines, acaracides for tick infestation and other insecticides for external parasites.\n\nLivestock-Rangeland balancing initiatives and greater nomadic resettlement programmes to minimize overuse of pasture.\n\nIV. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT\n\nBased on official sources, the losses caused by the drought to date are estimated at $1.7 billion. Annex I provides the breakdown of damages. The Government reports and earlier analyses indicate that in the 18 affected provinces:\n\nSome 37 million people, or more than 50% of the population, are affected by the drought to varying degrees.\n\n60% of the rural population in the farming and livestock-rearing sectors may be forced to move to cities;\n\n10 million people urban and rural areas are experiencing a shortage of potable water;\n\nAgricultural losses of 2.8 million tons in wheat and 280,000 tons in barley, with an attendant loss of stubble as fodder resources;\n\nAreas normally sown to alfalfa for hay used by returning nomadic stock are now almost nonexistent;\n\nCrops in 8.4 million hectares of orchards and irrigated and non-irrigated farms have been lost;\n\n9.6 million hectares of forests, woodlands are endangered;\n\n20% of the livestock population - 65% of which is nomadic livestock - have either died or had to be slaughtered.\n\nThe vicious circle of disruption of economic activities, curtailment of the livelihood, malnutrition and increases of the risk of water borne diseases contribute to a scenario of a critical human suffering unless urgent preventive and remedial actions are taken. Despite the I.R. of Iran’s exemplary primary health care system, disruption of agriculture, livestock farming, severe water shortage and consequent deterioration of sanitation impede human development.\n\nThe economic burden of drought on the drinking water supply sector is huge. As water is not flowing through water supply networks a considerable investment is not utilized. In the mean time, as the urgency for normal maintenance is not present, the systems rapidly fall into a state of disrepair. In addition to these, the cost of supplying water with tankers will continuously escalate. Since hauling water with tankers is a very costly operation and as its financial burdens rapidly grow, a huge resource from scarce development budget is diverted to emergency operation. The cost increase of such magnitude cannot be borne by the people and the Government is not in a position to subsidize indefinitely.\n\nAs water shortage will worsen, further affecting agriculture and livestock production and more severely impacting on some of the most vulnerable segments of the population. People in rural areas without adequate water for agriculture and livestock or without alternative means of income due to lose of livestock or crops will be forced to move to cities and create social, economic and environmental problems in urban areas. Drinking water shortage is one of the main causes of migration, especially for the poor, as they cannot afford paying for the water.\n\nV. EMERGENCY NEEDS\n\na. Drinking water\n\nProvision of drinking water is the highest priority. Based on the requirements of the three provinces visited by the mission, rough estimates suggest that only for these three provinces a minimum of 500 more mobile water tankers are urgently needed. Estimates for the country put the figure at 10,000 as the minimum.\n\nHeavy-duty, large plastic water containers mounted on ordinary trucks might be used for water delivery. These containers are urgently needed. It might also be useful to investigate the possibility of manufacturing them in the country. It is evident that a considerable number of pumps, motors, chlorinators, and pipes are required in addition to those provided so far by the Government. There is also a need for the development banks or multi/bilateral donors to grant an emergency line of credit to finance drought mitigation efforts of the provincial authorities.\n\nb. Livestock and Agriculture\n\nLivestock\n\nImmediate supply of up to one million tons of feed grain for daily maintenance rations of 150 grams of uncrushed barley per head. This figure assumes a target ruminant population of 40 million sheep and a six-month emergency-feeding regime. The shortfall between the total Government allocation and the immediate needs of livestock in the drought-affected provinces is in the order of 700,000 tons; distribution of grains through the provincial cooperative chapters and female breeding goats and sheep targeted; introduction of a subsidy on feed grain and fodder for the duration of the present crisis; provision of additional veterinary medications, mineral mixes and multivitamins; water tankers for urgent supply and distribution of livestock water; relaxation or extension of existing short-term, livestock-related loans, for small holders; provision of short-term loans at subsidized interest rates of interest and a minimum term of two years to cover household sustenance and purchase of emergency livestock feed.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe short-term agricultural needs include drought resistant planting materials for wheat and barley, enabling farmers to plant immediately when the rains break.\n\nChapter VII provides a list of urgently needed items for emergency relief.\n\nVI. MEDIUM AND LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE: NATIONAL POLICY, STRATEGY & ACTION TO COPE WITH DROUGHT\n\na. Hydrologic and Water Resources\n\nA logical response to the climatic situation in Iran is to construct water reservoirs to collect water in winter and release it when it is most needed by farmers. Larger reservoirs can keep water for some years as well as producing electricity. In Iran in 1994, a total of 27 larger storage reservoirs were in operation with a total regulation capacity of 39.2 cubic km. At that time, 24 other reservoirs were under construction with a design regulation capacity of 11.5 cubic km. These reservoirs were to have a double function - irrigation and urban water supply. In many of the rural areas, surface runoff is captured and stored in artificial depressions or cisterns. In normal years, these cisterns will contain water during the entire dry season.\n\nThe ingenious traditional Qanat water system is the ideal way to access the groundwater that is the other main source of water in Iran. Using wells that are connected by canals, the Qanats bring water from the foothills to the plane for irrigation and drinking. At present many wells are still functioning and with appropriate expansions of the Qanats greater ground water could be accessed if there is good winter precipitation.\n\nA large part of the rainwater in small and large desert depressions is lost to evaporation, while many groundwater sources in arid and semi-arid areas are saline or at least brackish. This limits their use, particularly in relatively flat areas. However, if there is sufficient precipitation at the end of the winter and spring, the soil will still be humid when the warm season starts and can support fodder crops or wheat and other food crops.\n\nArid and semi-arid areas like those in Iran are characterized by low average rainfall (below 250 or 300 mm a year), but even more by a very high variation in annual figures. This variability occurs both on the short and long term and means that it is not uncommon that there are series of years with much less than average precipitation.\n\nThe hydrological knowledge and hydro-geology of the country is well studied and documented by the Iranian meteorologists and hydrologists. As technically defined by UNESCO/WMO glossary of hydrology drought refers to a period of abnormally dry weather sufficiently prolonged for the lack of precipitation to cause a serious hydrological imbalance.\n\nThe general hydrological situation in Iran is such that there is indeed a serious hydrological imbalance due to a long period of insufficient precipitation. However, is this year’s drought 2000 abnormal? Based on reliable data, Iran had its lowest rainfall in 32 years. Considering other factors such as lack of fodder, major reduction of agricultural production and serious drinking water shortages, it is certainly a long dry period with significant consequences. In fact, Iran is affected by an extreme case of drought.\n\nRecurrence of Drought\n\nHow unusual is the situation? Drought should be considered as a recurring phenomenon in the arid and semi-arid climates like in Iran. There will be always dry periods covering several consecutive years. These periods are often so long that the normal reserve strategies in the rural areas break down unless the people move out of the area. Short-term migration might be the only practical solution, which was used in the past but might appear abnormal now. However, when the drought period is over, the ecology of the area, in particular the pastures that had time to recover will be restored encouraging the people to return. In particular, for the nomadic population, this seems to be the only feasible solution. Therefore, it is suggested that the recurring phenomenon of drought has to be accepted as part of the normal life in countries such as Iran.\n\nThe way to address this recurring phenomenon is to build much more water reserves to minimize migration. Also, drought mitigation strategies should be introduced for droughts of smaller magnitudes, say those that recur every 5 years. The local population can more easily minimize the adverse effect of such droughts. However, for a severe drought such as the present one, the Government together with the international community will have to join their efforts to avoid or mitigate the crisis.\n\nForecasting and Prediction\n\nIn the prevailing climate and, in particular, in arid and semi-arid regions like Iran, the precipitation occurs in winter. By the end of winter season in mid-April, a reliable prediction of a potential drought situation for a given year can be made and the Government can decide on its mitigation programmes with a great degree of confidence.\n\nAt the end of last winter, the figures for accumulated rainfall since November 1999 established a basis for comparative statistical situation analysis with prior years. Of course, the later the analysis, the greater will be the reliability of the forecast. The predictions should not be made earlier than February in any given year since they will not be reliable. However, due to climatic complexities, the prediction of the exact magnitude of the drought situation is not possible, as was the case this year.\n\nWhile regional forecasts that are based on long-range global climatic models are not yet operational, climatic driving forces and relationships are becoming clearer every year. It seems appropriate for Iranian meteorologists and hydrologists to further strengthen their climatic data exchange programme with other countries in the region, to enhance research for regional forecasting. Also, adaptation and testing of global meteorological models to minimize uncertainties could improve future forecasting and prediction. Such measures would be highly useful in early warning signals to prepare for emergency relief.\n\nWater Management Improvement as a Tool to Mitigate Drought\n\nIn Iran, the irrigation efficiency is generally estimated at 30%. If this figure is correct, it means that much more can be produced with the present water resources. Also, such estimates imply that there is no real water shortage but that it is mismanaged. It may also mean that if adequate water management programmes are implemented water reserves to be used for drinking, fodder and food production could be provided to sufficiently address the droughts.\n\nImproved water management programmes will only alleviate the consequences of droughts if they are used to increase water reserves. Other types of reserves such as those for food or fodder could be included under such programmes. If the improved water management is used for increasing agricultural production alone, as it seems to have been the case in Iran, there will be even a greater vulnerability to drought. As with increased production, there is a higher demand for water and greater possibility of overuse of land and pasture and thus a greater chance for drought.\n\nThe other practical strategy is to drastically reduce water use as soon as a drought situation is identified. In the case of Iran, once around mid-April a drought, irrespective of its magnitude, is predicted, irrigation of annual crops have to be prohibited in order to keep sufficient drinking water for the people, livestock and orchards. In such a case, the farmers have to be in one way or another convinced to strictly follow the regulation. Using food in reserve and money could be an incentive, if considered necessary. The role of community information dissemination systems and networking at the grassroots, particularly through village councils could facilitate greater participation by the rural population. Many drought mitigation strategies and responses derived at the local level and determined by the local communities themselves have proven to be more effective in other countries with similar situations.\n\nb. Drinking Water Supply\n\nWater scarcity has entered a new phase as droughts are now considered a recurring phenomenon, though this view is not fully shared by all. At late 1950s and early 1960s the average per capita water available to people in Iran was approximately 6,000 of cubic meter per person per year. Before the current drought, it was 2,000 of cubic meter per person per year. While in the last 40 years there is almost a 70% drop in per capita water consumption, the rate of water utilization has dramatically increased but the efficiency in water utilization has not accordingly improved.\n\nIn agriculture, for example, with exception of some horticulture, flood irrigation is still being used. For domestic water supply system, apart from the time of severe shortage, no systematic water saving and conservation is practiced. In industry the principle of \"pollute first, clean later\" is mostly followed, and there has not been any substantial effort for use of clean industries and cleaner production. In the meantime the use of water by people continues as if there is no shortage and it is business as usual.\n\nThe time has come for a critical and comprehensive action on water scarcity in relation to sustainable development. As a cross cutting issue, it should examine all sectors such as agriculture, industry, urbanization, commerce and health for better quality of life along long-term development scenarios. In such an exercise all concerned and the various stakeholders must be involved including people at the grassroots, professionals, scientists, officials and decision-makers. Some key points to be considered are:\n\nDrinking Water Security\n\nWater Conservation\n\nWater-conscious Strategy\n\nWater-conscious Attitude and Practices\n\nDrinking Water Security implies to ensure the availability and capacity for the delivery of adequate safe drinking water to safeguard health and quality of life. In water resources management, the priority should be accorded to provision of safe drinking water. This in certain areas, especially where water has to be transported from one locality to another at a long distance away, has many social and political ramifications. But, in view of prevailing drought and its impact, it seems the principle of drinking water security is necessary.\n\nWater Conservation is not something new. However, since it is not comprehensively adhered to, it is noteworthy. Water Conservation implies optimizing the use of water. In agriculture the use of drip irrigation, spray irrigation, growing crops that do not need too much water, wastewater reuse and other water saving measures may achieve water conservation. Measures such as preventing wastage in water supply, using water saving fixtures, recycling and wastewater reuse in industry, preventing the pollution of water bodies, preventing soil erosion, water dams and water harvesting are part of water conservation.\n\nWater-conscious Strategy aims at investment and development in areas that do not require too much water. For example, on priority basis the investment may be allotted to the development of industries, which have cleaner production and do not need too much water as compared to growing a crop that needs a lot of water with poor economic returns. Water-conscious Strategy should include national strategic corps, creating markets and building up skilled human resources.\n\nCreating Water-Conscious Attitude and Practices is self explanatory and implies to raise the awareness of everyone, ordinary people, professional, planners, managers, decision makers, about the water crisis and the need to use water more judiciously.\n\nc. Livestock and Agriculture\n\nThe Government planners would benefit from having a clear objective and programme of conservation and regeneration for the national rangelands. This would include some conception of what the rangeland should eventually become and support over the medium to long term. A defined objective for the rangeland would enable the Government to set development targets and make initiatives for protecting the resource and increasing its productivity over the long-term. In this regard, the movement of rural families to the cities becomes less likely if, through appropriate policy and programmes, the rangeland can be made productive enough for livestock raisers to maintain enough animals in direct association with the range to provide for their long-term household security.\n\nThe Government well recognizes the value of its rangeland as a resource upon which livestock can be produced economically and well. However, implicit in achieving sustained production from it, must be a programme of effective management, while adjusting and maintaining the balance between livestock numbers and grazing capacity. The measures taken by the Government to move nomads into sedentary agriculture/livestock activities thus far are not lively to solve this problem. On the other hand, conferring traditional rangeland users with the ownership to defined grazing areas imparts proprietary interest in, and better management of a valuable resource over which individuals formerly had no control. Such an approach has considerable long-term promise and is already being piloted in a number of areas in the country. This approach might be expanded.\n\nThere are also opportunities for the introduction of watershed management principles 55 Abkhandary - a pilot project of effective watershed management has already been established and demonstrated on over one thousand hectares in Fars province. to the same areas, both as a means of improving fodder productivity from the range itself, as well as ensuring the availability of water for a variety of purposes. National policy in respect of the rangelands might incorporate the long-term development of:\n\nLong-term, private ownership of the rangeland\n\nSoil conservation and watershed management\n\nMore appropriate rangeland management implies some de-stocking on the short-term. The movement of livestock from the range to achieve this demands some nomadic households adopt a change in livestock raising systems. There are proven opportunities for ruminant production (subject to lower input costs) by relying on hand feeding rather than grazing, in alternative livestock and livestock production systems. Logically, these might be more intensive sheep rearing and dairy production.\n\nThe Government might adopt policies which facilitate transfer of some former rangeland users into the enterprises just described, and support them with training66 For example, the Dairy Training Centre in Yazd Province which is owned jointly by the Ministry of Jihad and the local Dairy Farmers Cooperative, might be supported in providing sheep production courses to farmers, in addition to its regular dairy training programme. and technical inputs (breeds, information). In developing this policy, it might be useful to consider increasing the use of feed grains from countries having a comparative advantage in grain production. As an agricultural issue, the reallocation of marginal rain-fed agricultural land from cereals might allow Iran to develop a comparative advantage in horticultural (cashews, pistachios, dates, stone fruit) or other agricultural products. Medium term credit packages enabling livestock raisers or agriculturists to adopt alternative systems may prove essential for such a switch in production.\n\nAgriculture\n\nSome medium to long-term policy strategies could include:\n\nImproved efficiency of water use in the irrigation of cereal crops upon which livestock depend, in part, by charging for irrigation water, and use of better varieties;\n\nSubject to continuation of a policy of reliance on domestic production, increasing the overall production of cereals and fodder crops;\n\nMeasure production of all agricultural products, not in terms of production per unit of area, but in terms of water volume and cost;\n\nIncreased use of treated sewage water for irrigation.\n\nVII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\na. Conclusions\n\nThe present drought in the I.R. of Iran is a disastrous combination of an unprecedented two consecutive years of drought - a severe drought in 1999 followed by an extreme drought in 2000. It is seriously affecting 18 of the country’s 28 provinces, mostly in southern, eastern and central areas. According to some estimates, all but 3 northern provinces now have a shortage of drinking water.\n\nSome 37 million people or more than 50 % of the population are affected by the drought to varying degrees. The situation may worsen in the months to come, as summer temperatures continue to rise and rains are not expected until November.\n\nIf immediate mitigation measures are not taken, the situation could become a disaster in the months to come. The central, provincial and local authorities have identified drinking water as the most urgent priority as some 10 million people in rural and urban areas are affected by a severe water shortage. Also, the drought has seriously damaged the numbers and productivity of livestock and the situation will worsen until early in 2001 even with the advent of normal rain in November.\n\nGovernment estimates suggest that over 800,000 sheep and goats have died or had to be slaughtered. This accounts for 20% of the livestock population, 65% of which is nomadic livestock. Individual flocks have disappeared entirely in some districts. As a whole, the livestock sector is and will continue to be affected more profoundly by the drought than the immediate figures of mortality suggest. The loss of breeding animals, both from individual flocks as well as the national inventory, will be felt for several years after the drought is over.\n\nWhile the adverse impact of drought on the agricultural sector is more on the long-term, the drought has decreased both the rain-fed and irrigated crop production. For instance, wheat and barley plantings for the year were 4.9 million and 1.5 million hectares (80% and 75% of the previous year’s areas), while production was down by 2.8 million and 280,000 tons respectively. Areas normally sown to alfalfa for hay used by returning nomadic stock are now almost nonexistent. With neither agriculture nor livestock to support them, the nomadic households, as the most vulnerable segment of the population, are in grave difficulty facing an uncertain future.\n\nThe drought is producing a spectrum of serious negative impact and taking a tremendous toll on human and natural environment. The most significant negative effect on the human environment is increased air pollution.\n\nThe elements most damaged in the natural environment are the fresh water ecosystems and habitats, wetlands, vegetation and biodiversity with adverse effects on protected areas. Lower levels of oxygen are putting fish at risk in the water domains that still exist. Habitats are disappearing and the aquatic life forming part of the ecosystems have disappeared or are under extreme stress due to the loss of habitat. Many lakes and wetlands such as Bakhtegan-Nairiz, Hamoon-e-Saberi, the Southern part of the Hamoon-e-puzak and the Gavkhouni have completely dried up. As estimated 9.6 million hectares of forest and woodlands are endangered, while important afforestation programmes and projects to combat desertification are at risk. Due to diminished vegetation cover, serious floods could be expected in several regions next spring.\n\nTrans-boundary migration of population and movements of livestock have increased. With further deterioration of the present situation, increased movements of drought-affected populations, particularly from Afghanistan, may cross the I.R. of Iranian borders. These displaced Afghan villagers are considered as drought victims and not refugees. This is a matter of serious concern for the I.R. of Iranian authorities, a number of UN agencies, and the international community at large.\n\nThe Government has responded to the drought with great effort. The institutional set-up to cope with the immediate and longer-term needs is in place. Central, provincial and local authorities of the Ministry of Interior and other relevant line ministries are providing emergency relief items to the drought-affected people to the extent possible. The Government has concentrated its efforts on providing water tankers, domestic water purifiers, food supplies and fodder to meet the immediate needs of people and livestock. It has approved a US$ 290 million emergency aid package, which will be delivered primarily in the form of loans and grants. However, it may take some time for such loans/grants to reach the population intended.\n\nThe enormous scope of the drought disaster is overwhelming the Government’s capabilities and resources. A number of unmet needs and response gaps require urgent assistance for the international community.\n\nb. Recommendations for Emergency Relief\n\nNational Actions\n\nHealth and drinking water\n\nThe shortage of drinking water supply is the most severe impact of the drought and should receive the highest priority to mitigate the drought situation. In addition to what the international community can provide, the supply of mobile and stationary water tankers from Government resources should also receive the highest priority. Details on other priority items such as pumps, motors, chlorinators, and pipes have to be provided soonest.\n\nThe health sector should monitor the occurrence diseases regularly and have an active role in the drought task force. The safety of water supply through strict monitoring of water disinfection has to be the highest priority of the health workers in the field, especially for the cisterns. This is especially of high importance in the under privileged and remote areas of the drought affected provinces.\n\nAll emergency drugs and medical supplies should be accessible in the drought-affected areas. These include ORS, antibiotics, different vials and also laboratory diagnostic kits and materials. All technical health experts and staff should be prepared for the probable outbreaks.\n\nIt will be necessary to have a public education and awareness raising campaign on safe drinking water, including the distribution of chlorine to the families and give them an orientation on safe access to water.\n\nLivestock\n\nThe distribution of grain barley presently on order for importation to I.R. of Iran should be expedited. The Government should also offer grant assistance providing immediate and medium term loans to drought-affected livestock raisers and it should facilitate the provision of water for livestock as matters of urgency.\n\nInternational Assistance\n\nThe mission recommends donor countries and organizations to provide immediate assistance to mitigate the effects of the disaster on the people most seriously affected in the I.R. of Iran. As in any other disaster, international assistance is not a substitute for the Government’s responsibilities, but would supplement their efforts in the most critical areas. Assistance is required in the following areas:\n\nDrinking Water\n\nThe greatest need of the people in the affected provinces is potable water. The magnitude of the drinking water crisis is such that urgent donor response in support of the Government’s efforts is immediately required.\n\nPriority Needs\n\nA total of 10,000 mobile water tankers are required to deliver drinking water for rural, urban and nomadic population, as well as for livestock. International assistance is requested to supply a minimum of 1,000 tankers with a capacity of 18-24 thousand litres.\n\n10,000 stationary tankers (e.g. plastic) of 5-10 thousand litres capacity.\n\n750 km of ductile iron, Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP), Heavy Duty Polyethylene (HDP), and PVC pipes for urban water supplies.\n\n1,800 km of HDP pipes for rural water supplies.\n\n2,000 chlorinators.\n\n10 tons raw material and resin to produce HDP and GRP\n\n100 chlorination gas cylinders.\n\n300 submersible electric pumps with the capacity of 40-100 litres per second and pumping head of 100-150 meters.\n\n400 submersible electric pumps with the capacity of 5-20 litres per second and pumping head of 50-100 meters.\n\n150 ultrasonic well water meters.\n\n100 leak detection instruments and accessories.\n\nChlorine powder, aluminum sulphide, ferric chloride, poly chlorite.\n\n5 percussion well drilling machines.\n\n150 water analysis kits (chemical and biological).\n\n50 water bottling and packing units.\n\nExperts/consultants on water quality management and hydrology.\n\nLivestock/Agriculture\n\nThe second greatest need of the drought-affected population is livestock and agriculture support.\n\nPriority Needs\n\nWater tankers (up to 400 units. A minimum of 180 units for immediate assistance on the basis of an average of ten units for each affected province for provision of livestock water).\n\n28 tons of multivitamin and mineral feed supplements on the basis of an allocation of two tons per province. The Veterinary Organization will provide specifications for these and the veterinary items (see below). The Ministry of Jihad will have responsibility for receipting them on arrival and arranging their distribution through its provincial veterinary organizations, thence through the livestock raisers cooperatives.\n\nUp to one million tons of grain barley to be assigned to the worst affected provinces and distributed through the cooperatives and under the administration of the Ministry of Jihad in proportion to the affected livestock units in each province.\n\nVeterinary supplies - preventive medicines (antibiotics and vaccines - 5 million doses of FMD vaccine), filaricides against TBD, and 60 tons of livestock insecticide and acaracides (Cyclometrine/Asuntol) for external parasite control.\n\nGrant assistance to provide medium term loans to drought-affected livestock raisers.\n\nUp to 1,500 electric pumps ranging from 3-185kw for provision of water for agricultural holdings.\n\n100 electro-diesel pumps.\n\nHealth\n\nFor prevention of diseases the Government has supplied the necessary drugs, pesticides and diagnostic kits already as part of their routine operation. The Ministry of Health needs to constitute emergency stockpiles of the following supplies in case of a communicable disease outbreak.\n\nThe diagnostic laboratory kits for Tuberculoses, Cholera, Measles, Meningitis, Typhoid, Dysentery, Salmonelosis and Parasitic diseases;\n\nORS powder, IVFs;\n\nHypersonic Glucose Vial, Potassium Chloride and Bicarbonate Vials;\n\nPesticides and poisons for vector control;\n\nDrugs, including: Tetracycline, Doxycycline, Ciprefloxacin, TMP-SMX, Erythromicin, Furazolidone, Chloramphenicol, Ampicilin, Ceftriaxone, Cefotaxine, Ceftizoxime, Metronidazole, Iodoquinol, Diloxanidefurlate, Parmomycin, Penicillin, Diloxanidefurlate, Parmomycin, Penicillin G, Gentamycin, Chloroquine, Primaquine, Quinine, Quinidine, Permethrine, (5%, 1%), Lindane, Malathione (0.5%), Ophthalmic Ointment Tetracycline, Clootimazole cream, Miconazole cream, Immune Globulin, Vitamin A Preparation, Botulism trivalent equine antitoxin.\n\nDonors can make their contributions directly to the Iranian Government or to relevant UN agencies (Annex VI). The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is prepared to serve as a channel for unearmarked contributions to be used for relief assistance. These will then be allocated in consultation with the Government of Iran and relevant organizations in the United Nations system. Funds should be transferred to OCHA account No. CO-590.160.0, Swift code: UBSWCHZ12A at the UBS AG, P.O. Box 2770, CH-1211 Geneva 2, with reference: OCHA - Iran - Drought. OCHA provides donors with written confirmation and pertinent details concerning the utilization of the funds contributed. For coordination purposes, donors are requested to inform OCHA Geneva of bilateral relief missions/pledges/contributions and their corresponding values by item.\n\nIn order to expedite delivery, purchase of available items locally is recommended.\n\nConstraints\n\nThe greatest constraint is time. To be effective, international assistance should be provided practically immediately.\n\nc. Recommendations on Medium and Long-term Strategy\n\nNational and International Actions\n\nWater Management\n\nAn appropriate strategy providing a durable and sustainable solution is recommended to minimize the impact of the drought. Such a strategy could be developed and implemented through international technical cooperation and assistance\n\n- There is an increasing need to exchange information and know-how and become familiar with the experiences of other countries in preparing for droughts, assessing drought damage and mitigating its consequences. A 10-day workshop is proposed in which specialists from selected countries exchange information on drought management with their counterparts in I.R. of Iran. The workshop will facilitate identification of practical measures for drought preparation and mitigation\n\n- It is important that the detailed information on the present drought is compiled for each of the affected regions inclusive of rural and urban areas. Such information would enable the Government to establish a computerized drought information database. The national Drought Committee at the central level together with drought committees at the provincial and local levels should be the focal points to gather the required information and establish a data bank for national use. This information is essential for the preparation of strategies for the mitigation of drought in future. It is proposed that a special unit within the Drought Committee is established with responsibility for collecting and updating information on the present drought and its related consequences.\n\n- The drought situation provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate the national water supply programme. A rapid evaluation procedure for national water supply and sanitation in relation to drought needs to be prepared by the relevant ministries including the Ministry of Energy, Jihad and MOHME. The evaluation process can examine current policies, strategies, management, administration, design standards, planning norms, technical procedures, material, skilled human resources, etc. Help can be sought from the international community for the development of this rapid evaluation. As an outcome of such a rapid evaluation, individual action plans along with listing of the areas of needs could be identified at the central, provincial and local levels and relevant programmes could be formulated accordingly.\n\n- A Forum on Water, Drought and Sustainable Development needs to be prepared jointly by the Ministries of Interior, Energy, Jihad, Agriculture and MOHME. It is suggested that a technical advisory committee assists the forum. It is recommended that the international community is approached to financially support the Forum. The Forum should prepare a comprehensive action document on:\n\nDrinking Water Security\n\nWater Conservation\n\nWater-conscious Development\n\nCreating a Water-conscious Attitude\n\nPrediction and Forecasting\n\nBy April of each year, the development and location of a possible drought situation can be predicted. At such time, the national, regional and local authorities can decide on water restrictions to be applied to minimize future impact.\n\nEstablishment of a regional research and training centre for climatic forecasting of droughts and floods is proposed. The existing Meteorological Centre in Mashad could be a good venue for this purpose.\n\nPreparation of a drought Mitigation Plan to address both short-term and medium-term issues is proposed. For this purpose, all stakeholders, both governmental and non-governmental at various levels, should be fully involved and proactively participate in its preparation and implementation. Some considerations for the Plan are highlighted below:\n\nA comprehensive list of potential emergency and relief items is required;\n\nRegional drought vulnerability maps;\n\nEmergency measures to be taken in any given drought situation with emphasis on possible short-term and long-term scenarios;\n\nA Water Vision for I.R. of Iran with established targets and benchmarks for the next 25-30 years in order to formulate a water-crisis programme of action;\n\nTake into account the combination of recurrent droughts and floods;\n\nA regulatory policy or legislation to be approved by the Parliament for nationwide implementation of the Drought Mitigation Plan.\n\nHealth\n\nThe following actions are suggested:\n\nThe systematic exchange of information between the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) and the drought committees at the central, provincial and local levels needs to be strengthened for regular analysis and reporting on drought related diseases.\n\nSteps need to be taken by the Ministry of Jihad and MOHME to improve water quality in water cisterns (Berkehs), including the installation of floodwater inlets and nets and ventilation ports to keep debris, flies, birds and insect away.\n\nThe drought-affected population will be at risk for reduced food intake and communicable diseases. The reduced food intake will lead to protein-energy malnutrition micronutrient deficiency, especially iron and iodine. The communicable diseases include, water borne diseases such as diarrhoeal (including cholera) and typhoid fever. TB, Malaria and problems that could result to low immunization coverage.\n\nTo cope with these risks there is a need for more rigorous surveillance of communicable diseases and malnutrition. A more diligent effort should be made to ensure supply of safe water, maintain sanitation standards, food hygiene, and to adopt a nutrition strategy for access to safe nutrition. More attention to malaria and TB control is also needed.\n\nIf there is population movement and drought-affected people are displaced, then in addition to the above measures, attention should be given to reproductive health and sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Measles vaccination must be carefully controlled for children under five. Lastly, mental health needs of drought-affected patients and stress-induced conditions must be considered. The strategy to cope with health problems of the drought-affected population should include emphasis on better coordination, supply of essential drugs, targeted public health interventions (like control of cholera, meningitis, typhoid and malaria, through vaccination and health education).\n\nThe MOH and MED should take the lead in more vigorous water quality monitoring and control.\n\nLivestock and Agriculture\n\nGovernment planners would benefit from having a clear objective and programme of conservation and regeneration for the national rangelands. A defined objective for the rangeland would enable the Government to set development targets and make initiatives for protecting the resource and increasing its productivity over the long-term. A programme of effective rangeland management adjusting and maintaining the balance between livestock numbers and grazing capacity is needed.\n\nConferring traditional rangeland users with the ownership to defined grazing areas imparts proprietary interest in, and better management of a valuable resource over which individuals formerly had no control. Such an approach has considerable long-term promise and is already being piloted in a number of areas in the country. This approach might be expanded.\n\nThere are also opportunities for the introduction of watershed management principles such as Abkhandary to the same areas, both as a means of improving fodder productivity from the range itself, as well as ensuring the availability of water for a variety of purposes. National policy in respect of the rangelands might incorporate the long-term development of:\n\nLong-term, private ownership of the rangeland\n\nSoil conservation and watershed management\n\nMore appropriate rangeland management implies some de-stocking on the short-term. The movement of livestock from the range to achieve this demands some nomadic households adopt a change in livestock raising systems. There are proven opportunities for ruminant production (subject to lower input costs) by relying on hand feeding rather than grazing, in alternative livestock and livestock production systems. Logically, these might be more intensive sheep rearing and dairy production.\n\nThe Government might adopt policies to facilitate transfer of some former rangeland users into the enterprises just described, and support them with training and technical inputs (breeds, information). In developing this policy, it might be useful to consider increasing the use of feed grains from countries having a comparative"
