        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nEcosystems have specific structures and processes. The structure consists of biological, physical, and biophysical factors, such as plant and animal species and habitats, populations, their interrelationships, climate, and soil. However, the ecosystem process is associated with the characteristics of one or more ecosystems (Costanza et al., 1997). The function of any ecosystem depends on the interaction between its structure and process, comprising four main components: regulatory, habitat, production, and informational function (De Groot et al., 2002). The ecosystem function provides services such as supplying the goods needed by humans, controlling materials and energy to mitigate natural hazards, and providing opportunities for cultural experiences related to nature and landscape (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment [MEA], 2005). This concept represents a novel approach to defining human relationships with the environment and creating inclusive decision-making processes that establish integrity and balance alongside land use (LU) purposes (Kahan, 2007). Thus, mapping and analysis of the ecosystem services (ESs) facilitate business analysis (Haines-Young et al., 2012).\n\nEcosystems simultaneously provide various services that are interdependent in complexity, dynamic, and nonlinear. Thus, the changes in LU in any ecosystem can change the supply of multiple ESs in favor of services that humans require and disrupt the interaction between ESs (Rodrigues et al., 2004). Accordingly, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment warned that human activities have decreased ESs by 60% in recent years (MEA, 2005). Therefore, LU and land cover (LC) changes have been identified as the most influential factors affecting the ecosystem structure, process, and function that support ESs (Li et al., 2017).\n\nThe changing LU and LC within an ecological network (EN) significantly impacts ecosystem functioning and, consequently, the provision of ESs (Crossman et al., 2013). Ecological network analysis is an analytical method to examine the interactions and relationships between ecosystem components through ecological corridors. It identifies the inherent characteristics of an ecosystem. The study of ENs focuses on the structural characteristics and functional relationships within ecosystems (dos Santos et al., 2020). As a result, ENs are essential tools for improving the quality of natural ecosystems and enhancing their structural and functional elements (Yang et al., 2017). Therefore, the formation and optimization of ENs are effective methods for improving and enhancing ESs (Li et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2020).\n\nManagement and planning of ESs require the assessment and mapping of ESs, as this process provides critical information about areas that provide a high level of services, regions with specific ESs, and changes in ES supply over time (Maynard et al., 2010). Analysis of the spatial and temporal status of services, dynamic patterns, interactions between structures, and their trade-offs and synergies are additionally defined as situations where one ES may increase or decrease another (Raudsepp-Hearne et al., 2010).\n\nRecently, some studies have focused on investigating ES variations in LU changes (Sadat et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2022). In addition, few studies have evaluated trade-off and synergy of multiple ESs (Adelisardou et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2020) and forecast future changes in ESs according to LU simulations and scenarios (Adelisardou et al., 2021; Balist et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2021). Moreover, very few studies have determined and investigated the structural factors associated with the changes in ESs (Ahmadi Mirghaed et al., 2018; Tang et al., 2021). Furthermore, few studies have investigated specific ecological factors and their effects on ESs, such as landscape structures on pollination, pest control, water quality, flood regulation, and cultural ESs (Qiu, 2019), forest edge in carbon storage (Saeed et al., 2019), forest fragmentation in carbon sequestration (Islam et al., 2017; Shen et al., 2019), vegetation biomass, and density and height on sediment retention (Kretz et al., 2021). However, none of the studies have investigated the relationship between the main ecological indicators and the functioning of the entire ecosystem. Therefore, this study presents an integrated model to investigate process-related, structural, and functional changes caused by LU changes in the region where natural and pristine ecosystems have close and complex interactions with built-up ones. Furthermore, this study aims to evaluate the structural changes related to LU change and its role in ecosystem functioning through changes in ESs. Innovations of this study include:\n\nSimilar studies have investigated ESs that are influenced by climate and soil physical and structural conditions; however, the services selected in this study reflect other factors, such as LU, LC, vegetation, and EN change, in addition to soil conditions (Islam et al., 2017; Kretz et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2019). Therefore, such factors are suitable for investigating the effect of structure on ecosystem functions. One of the notable differences between this study and similar ones is the investigation of the role of LU in altering ESs. Whereas previous studies have primarily focused on examining LU changes over several years and subsequently modeling the services for desired periods, they have often failed to establish a logical relationship between these factors. In contrast to the studies mentioned above, this study successfully proved such a relationship. Furthermore, since past and present assessments of ESs should serve as the basis for the future, the present study also focused on future predictions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn recent years, concerns about the effects of LU and LC changes on ESs have increased. On the other hand, investigation of LU changes could predict ESs better in terms of changes and analysis of policies' output (Deng et al., 2016). Examination of the relationship between the spatial distribution pattern of Hyrcanian forests and the provision of TES in the study region indicated a strong, significant, and positive correlation. The reason for this was the high density of mature broad-leaf trees, the lower erodibility of rain compared with other lands in the watershed, low slope, local soil properties, and higher drainage power. However, there was a strong negative correlation between the presence of agricultural lands and the provision of ESs. In other words, the increase in agricultural land due to the increased demand for food production and other LU could endanger the provision of other regulatory services. As a result, deforestation and conversion of forest into agricultural land significantly impacted the desired ES provision. Furthermore, expansion of cities and lands showed a strong negative correlation with the provision of selected services.\n\nThe evaluation of the results obtained from the efficiency of different components of the forest EN in providing ESs indicated that forest cores are the most significant components in providing service. Small isolated forest patches showed a strong negative relationship with service provision. Deforestation and small isolated patches significantly reduced ESs. Furthermore, service provision and core perforations showed a moderate negative correlation. The increase of perforations inside the core due to the destruction of vegetation and deforestation decreased carbon sequestration, prevented floods, and enabled soil maintenance in the region.\n\nThe evaluation of the EN showed that the small- and medium-sized cores in the northern half of the region had been converted into agricultural and built-up land from 2000 to 2020. Consequently, the diminished area caused the core to become separate, isolated regions. Additionally, the complete removal of some small and medium cores in the south of the region led to an increase in the perforation area in the network. The erosion of the network boundaries and the presence of other uses up to the main core increased the percentage of loops, bridges, and branches, which were used to demonstrate fragmentation in the EN. Predictions indicated that changes could eliminate and fragment small and medium cores and the main core of the network by 2040. This would lead to an increase in isolated patches with a very small area, which would not only have primary patch ecological value but may also be unable to offer many ESs (Kennedy, 2003). Furthermore, changes to other parameters of the EN of the basin caused an increase in fragmentation and perforations. Additionally, more branches and islets with a minuscule area and little connection to the main core could lead to an increase in the destruction rate. These results could alert planners to the fact that destruction would increase with the current process as changes in LU penetrate the inner parts of the cores. There was an increase of approximately 10 000 ha of man-made and agricultural lands and a decrease of 3238 ha of forest area and 6% of the forest core, which led to a decrease in the amount of desired services provided in the watershed. Thus, EN modeling in the present and also in the future is necessary in the studied region. This is supported by the results reported in the studies of Scandellari et al. (2016) and Zhu et al. (2021). In addition, due to the flood-prone areas of the basin and its high water erosion potential, special planning of and attention to this basic service are necessary. Unfortunately, the results of this study show that not only has little attention been paid to this issue but also soil erosion has increased and the provision of this ES has decreased in recent years. Moreover, the forecast also indicated that the situation could worsen in the coming years; this result is in line with previous studies (Asadolahi et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the changes in this service have been less than others, since R and terrain are the most important factors in quantification of sediment retention. Moreover, these two factors had been considered to be constant due to the need for long-term evaluations of climatic statistics and absence of changes of the slope under normal conditions. Therefore, structural changes in the ecosystem affect service provision and can also alter the interactions between services.\n\nThe results of the synergy and trade-off between services also showed a strong positive correlation between the two ESs of carbon storage and flood retention, which increased over time. Since there was a significant spatial overlap between these two services, it could explain the strong correlation, as they were both dependent on soil and LU. However, there was a weak, yet positive and insignificant relationship between the soil maintenance service and the two mentioned services, despite an increase in value over time. The weak correlation between the sediment retention service and other services was due to the small role of the rain erodibility factor, oil hydrology, and the slope in carbon sequestration and preventing flood. Over time, the relationship between the types of services provided by an ecosystem can increase, which is consistent with the studies of Huang et al. (2021), Adelisardou et al. (2021), and Jiang et al. (2016). Structural changes in the ecosystem can lead to fluctuations in the relationship between LU and ESs. For example, the synergy between forest and TES reduced from 2000 to 2020 due to the decrease in forest patches, their further fragmentation, and shrinkage of cores and isolated patches in the EN. Additionally, the significant increase in built-up areas reinforced the relationship between this type of LU and the desired ESs. However, the increase in the area of urban patches reduced the provision of ESs compared with the past, owing to the negative relationship between this variable. In general, human-induced structural changes in ecosystems can cause unexpected and unpredictable changes in the services provided by the ecosystem."
