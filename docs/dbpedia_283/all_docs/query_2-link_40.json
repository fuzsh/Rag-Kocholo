        "meta_description": "The development of urbanization and urbanism in Iran has created a wide socioeconomic gap in urban areas. Rapid population growth along with the lack of socioeconomic growth programs and urban development strategies have deteriorated unemployment, inflation, housing price, traffic congestion, and marginalization in cities, particularly in metropolises of Iran. This paper, using a descriptive-analytic research method and a meta-analysis technique, addresses the urbanization and urbanism changes in Iran. Using GIS technique and CV formula, the spatial distribution of urbanization and its rapid growth in Iran are depicted. The research data was derived from a systematic review of documents and techniques over 40 years. The results of the study demonstrated that Iranian cities have undergone an unsustainable growth trend and urbanization has overtaken urbanism. Over the past 4 decades, cities have been struggling with rapid growth and development. In this regard, development-oriented governments can play a significant role in tackling growth and urbanization problems. These problems are especially evident in the socio-economic, urban planning and urban ecology. The rapid growth of urbanization (74% in 2016) has resulted in the emergence of metropolitan areas in an unstable process. Also, in metropolitan areas of Iran, environmental and ecological threats, rural–urban migration and marginalization have posed serious national–regional and local challenges. The structural–functional reforms in Iran, along with skeletal–spatial and socio-economic changes in cities, have given rise to a new social class (low-income people), which is characterized with non-formal businesses and informal settlements in the outskirts of cities, especially metropolitan areas. This has prompted unsustainability in main indicators of urban development such as security, building density, environmental threats, and centralization, among other things. This analysis is based on indicators such as density and centralization, informal settlement, and urban security.",

        "text": "Urbanization\n\nUrbanization describes the surge in the population of urban spaces compared to rural spaces (Deepika, 2020). It is also a geographical phenomenon. Urbanization is a process through which changes in the social structure of human settlements are caused by population density, concentration, and growth. Structurally, urbanization is characterized with the transformations of socio-economic structures and demographic functions, which alter the structure of urban spaces. Generally speaking, urbanization has two main features:\n\nThe flow of migrants from rural areas to cities in search of employment and non-agricultural jobs and activities, which leads to higher levels of density and land use change.\n\nThe transformation of people’s lifestyles along with changes in values and attitudes, which promotes new types of behavior (Shokuie, 1995).\n\nUrbanism\n\nUrbanism is an urban movement linked to socio-cultural development and growth (Varma, 2017). Urbanism describes citizen’s interest in the city, which is driven by social awareness and a sense of belonging to the city. In its broad sense, urbanism is the study of cultural, political, economic, social, and geographical aspects of cities (Deepika, 2020). To Louis Wirth (1938) and Theodorson and Theodorson (1969), it is a lifestyle (Agalgatti, 2008; Theodorson and Theodorson, 1969; Wirth, 1938), and in major cities and metropolises, this lifestyle has been associated with rationalization, individualism, loss of identity, and alienation (Fischer, 1982; Simmel, 1971). The urbanism theory is influenced by three approaches:\n\n1.\n\nDeterminism or the ecological approach in which population density, monetary economy, communication, etc., differentiate urban and rural spaces in term of living conditions, creating a specific lifestyle called urbanism.\n\n2.\n\nThe sub-culture approach, which has influenced the social life of cities (Sharepour, 2011) and reinforced various social groups with different sub-cultures (Sedigh Sarvestani, 2013).\n\n3.\n\nThe integrated approach, which influences urbanization through emotive connections with demographic features such as age, sex, occupation, and education (Bemanian, 2012).\n\nUrbanism is a bi-directional link that extends from villages to cities and vice versa and provokes changes in behavioral patterns and values (Anderson, 1959). Urbanism is the final phase and the outcome of urbanization (Rahmani Firuozjah et al., 2013). Therefore, a country might have a high rate of urbanization, but a low level of urbanism. Urbanism is another basic concept associated with the urban culture (Gottdiener et al., 2015) and citizenship culture, which arises from socio-cultural relations and communications (CNU, 2020). Urbanism is usually characterized with some changes in values, traditions, ethical norms, and the collective behavior of citizens (Jalalipour and Abdolahpour, 2012). Features of urbanism include contradictions of norms, cultural changes, social movement, and individualism. In the past decades, these features have been affected by globalization, modern urban spaces, ethnicity, etc. (Hooper, 2009).\n\nPopulation and urbanization in the world\n\nThe analysis of population changes and urbanization trends show four types of change:\n\n1.\n\nThe urbanization of villages, i.e. the process of transforming villages into cities, will continue along with a surge in urban population.\n\n2.\n\nThe concentration of rural population in the suburbs of major cities will aggravate in less-developed and developing countries.\n\n3.\n\nGlobalization of cities, i.e. the transformation of cities into metropolises with national and international functions (Shabirchima, 2004).\n\n4.\n\nThe global urbanization, which is marked by the alteration of settlement models from rural to urban (Pilehvar, 2019).\n\nAs shown in Table 1, these changes describe the process of urbanization in the world and changes of life patterns from non-urban to urban styles.\n\nIn 2018, the less-developed regions accounted for 76% of the world’s urban population and 83.5% of the total world population. As the developing world is becoming increasingly urbanized, the difference between these two figures declines. By 2050, with 5.6 billion urban population, the less developed regions are projected to accommodate 83% of the world’s urban population and 87% of the total world population (UN, 2018) (Table 1).\n\nUrbanization in Southwest Asia\n\nContemporary urbanization in both less-developed and developing countries of southwest Asia has been the outcome of globalization, modernization, and transition from agricultural societies to industrial and super-industrial societies. Notwithstanding the bifurcation of their socio-economic systems, the process of urbanization in these countries has followed a uniform direction, but retained its specific regional form, with the redistribution of population in these countries favoring urban societies at the cost of the abandonment of villages. The urbanization pattern in both groups of countries has followed a logarithmic curve. The processes of urbanization and urbanism in both groups are accompanied by creativity and innovation, providing a fertile ground for geographical concentration of capital, population, activities, and exchange of information. Urban population growth in south Asia and Iran is shown in Fig. 2. The prospect of urban population growth in Iran indicates that this trend will increase up to 85% by 2050. This is a considerable growth, which exhibits a prevailing gap with other Asian or south Asian countries (UN, 2018) (see Fig. 2).\n\nUrbanization and urbanism trends in Iran\n\nIn recent decades, urbanization and urbanism trends in Iran have manifested a clear disparity between the quality and the quantity of urbanization and urbanism. Political and socio-economic changes ushered in by modernism (establishment of new factories, railways, creation of oil industry, land reforms, industrialism, etc.), which began in Iran in 1922, boomed urbanization and changed the face of cities. The rate of natural population growth doubled and the pace of urban population growth was accelerated compared to natural and rural population growth. To shed further light on this issue, the historical periods of urbanization and urbanism in Iran can be described as follows:\n\nThe first period: pre-1922 era\n\nIn this period, the Iranian economy was dependent and fundamental cultural, economic, and social changes were introduced (Nazarian, 2010). Subsequently, the traditional socio-economic system and its components including cities, lost their dynamism, spurring recession in urbanization and urbanism (Soliymani, 1994). This era was coincided with the industrial growth and industrialism in western countries. As a producer of raw materials (agricultural products, oil, etc.), Iran is part of the global markets; however, this has had a slight effect on the pace of urbanization and urbanism in Iran, causing limited transformations in terms of urban, spatial and physical constructs. In this period, urbanization and urbanism remained fairly stable and urbanization was <50 percent.\n\nThe second period: from 1922 to the 1979 Revolution\n\nFrom early 1920s, oil revenues played a pivotal role in geopolitics of Iran and assisted the trend of modernism. Transitioning from workshops to factories, the growth of bureaucracy, emphasis on military power, etc., are all indicative of authoritarianism and major structural changes in the political, social, and economic systems of Iran in this period (Habibi, 1977).\n\nTherefore, more than ever, cities were considered as main centers for accumulation of capital, concentration of activities, and innovations, and for several decades, centralization policies of the government were integral to the creation of metropolis and their unseemly growth.\n\nTherefore, political, economic, and social changes along with the development of government policies, which were based on urbanization and urbanism, overshadowed other phenomenon (Saidi Rezvani, 1993). These effects, transmitted through industrialization-induced migrations, turned Tehran into the major city of Iran and contributed to the emergence of a raft of other new cities (Amir-Ahmadi, 2008). Therefore, urbanization gained prominence and the law for establishing municipalities was ratified in 1931. A focus on modern urbanization and urban development triggered formal and physical changes in cities and the enactment of the law for developing sidewalks and streets in 1934. This legislation was the onset of modern urban planning, a milestone for the transformation of urbanization and foundation of urbanism in Iran (Pilehvar, 2007). In this period, the formulation of growth and development plans along with the strategic plan of industrialization in 1960s ushered in two major waves of change in Iran: physical transformation of urban centers and mass rural–urban migrations.\n\nDuring the first wave, the introduction of new symbols of western culture such as hotels, theaters, cinemas, banks, etc., together with the advent of a new device called automobile, transformed the structure, and the function of cities. In the second wave, massive torrent of migrants from villages to cities, who were in the hope of finding better job opportunities and reaping the fruits of industrialism, along with deployment of industries in the fringes of major cities triggered major changes in urbanization and urbanism processes?\n\nThe third period: post 1979 Revolution\n\nThe 1979 Iranian Revolution was an urban event triggered by the congregation and participation of social groups, especially the emerging middle class (Movsaghi, 2007). With their political wisdom, religious beliefs, independence, Islamism, and republicanism, they strived to change the ruling government. In the wake of the Islamic revolution, the model of political, social, cultural, and economic development underwent massive changes, so that government played a more prominent role in regional-urban plans for growth and development (Haji Hashemi, 2012).\n\nThe concentration and reinforcement of migration waves increased fertility rates and altered consumption pattern of the society, with the achievements of the Revolution highlighting the lure of cities. The widespread and unbridled rush of migrants to cities coupled with the elevated rate of natural population growth, due to policies that supported population growth, led to the formulation of comprehensive plans called “Development and Construction” in 1980s. In this period, a new government agenda was planning and constructing 28 new cities to accommodate the population surplus of major cities, which began in 1990s. This plan had a substantial role in the growth of urbanization in Iran.\n\nPopulation and urbanization in Iran\n\nThe role of government in protecting, expediting, and intensifying urbanization and urbanism processes in Iran was influenced by recent changes, especially the 1979 Revolution. Accordingly, in the post-Revolution era, governments, albeit with discernible fluctuations, have continuously attempted to reinforce and promote urbanization and urbanism by adopting city-centric and city-based policies (Rahnamai, 2009). In this period, governments, whether knowingly or unknowingly, have focused on reinforcing urbanization rather than urbanism. This is provoked by factors such as the growth of semi-capitalism and the automation of the national economy along with government’s expansionary policies (Kamrava, 1995). From this perspective, the government has failed to play a systematic and influential role in the urbanization of Iran. The rapid transformation of villages into cities along with growing rural–urban migrations, which reached 25% in 2000s in Tehran (as the capital of Iran), engendered a raft of environmental (adverse consequences of fossil fuel consumption, endangered coastal cities, water supply to cities), humanitarian and social (security threats, social clashes, especially in the fringes of metropolises, inadequate health services, etc.) issues that threatened urbanization. In this process, the urban population and urbanization pace were escalated but scant attention was paid to the urban culture or urbanism.\n\nOver the past decades, urbanization policies in Iran have been driven by the importance of urbanization in the process of national growth and development at the cost of overlooking the huge potentials of rural areas. Hence, the government, as a major driver of structural and functional changes in Iranian cities, has played a pivotal role in this process. According to the Human Development Report released by the United Nations, the urban population of Iran was 64.20% in 2000, rising to 75.94% in 2019 and is expected to rise to 85.82% in 2050 when the rural population will reach its nadir (UN, 2018). The percentage of urban and rural population in Iran from 1950 to 2050 is depicted in Fig. 3.\n\nFailure to implement new population-control policies coupled with the eruption of Iran–Iraq war led to a surge in the average rate of annual population growth in the 1980s, which was estimated at 3.9% according to of 1986 Census. Since 1990s, the introduction of birth control strategies decreased the average rate of annual population growth to 1.5% from 1996 to 2006. This declining trend continued to the last national Census in 2016, when the average rate of annual population growth was reported to be 1.3% (Statistical Center of Iran, 2018). According to the results of the 1986 Census, the population growth rate of 3.9% in this year marked a historical milestone in Iran. According to urban statistics in Iran, which is based on the national census, there were 271 cities in Iran in 1966 and this figure rose to 1245 in 2016. As shown in Table 2, over a 40-year period, the urban population spiked from 53.3% in 1986 to 74% in 2016 (Table 2).\n\nChanges in the urbanization growth rate\n\nThe population growth and urbanization of Iran rates have taken an upturn in recent decades. The analysis of urban population growth shows that urbanization has nearly doubled and the urban population has witnessed a 6-fold increase. In fact, in the wake of the 1979 Revolution, Iranian governments have developed a tendency for both urbanism and city-centrism. Emergence and expansion of major cities as well as the change of rural lifestyle into urban one together with a 35% surge in the urban population over 5 decades are all evidence of this transformation in Iran.\n\nThe analysis of urbanization growth rate in Iran shows that settlement patterns have altered from rural to urban in 1980s, giving rise to a new urbanization and urbanism trend (Pilehvar, 2019). In addition to different mortality and birth rates of rural and urban areas and rural–urban migrations, some other major factors including the establishment of 28 new cities have also contributed to the transformation of villages into cities. These factors increased urbanization rate in Iran, especially in 1990s and 2000s. Figure 4 shows the population of Iranian cities by 2030. As shown in Fig. 4, Iran had a city with a population of 10 million in 2018 (Tehran). It is projected that by 2030, the number of cities with up to 5 million populations will increase. Therefore, Iranian cities manifest a rising trend in terms of population and urbanization (UN, 2018) (see Fig. 4).\n\nGeographical distribution of the urban population\n\nSince early 1920s, the urbanizing trend and urban change in Iran indicate centralization in major cities such as Tehran, Mashhad, and Tabriz. Despite the decentralization policies, which were implemented by the government in 2000s, centralization and urbanization in Iranian provinces are still on rise.\n\nThe percentages of population living in urban areas of Iran in 2000s and 2010s, based on the national censuses, are shown in Table 3.\n\nComparing the percentage of urban population in 2006 and 2016 Censuses shows provinces that are home to Iranian metropolises (such as Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, Alborz, Khuzestan, Khorasan Razavi, Fars, Gilan, East Azerbaijan) have a higher urbanization rate. In addition, provinces that are located in desert regions (such as Qom, Yazd, and Semnan), due to their specific environmental features and lack of growth opportunities (mainly water shortage) have a low level of urbanization. On the other hand, in provinces where villages have great potentials to grow, such as Mazandaran (44.2%) and Gilan (46.8%), the urbanization rate is lower. Moreover, in provinces that host nomads, the urbanization rate is low. Tehran has the highest rate of urban population followed by Khorasan Razavi. The lowest level of urban population belongs to Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province, followed by South Khorasan, Ilam, and North Khorasan, respectively.\n\nTable 3 shows huge gaps between Iranian provinces in terms of urbanization and the urban population in 2000s, which is due to economic and social differences in Iranian provinces including the levels of economic, social, and cultural development as well as sustenance diversity. The data from 2006 Census manifests the unbalanced distribution of urbanization in Iran. As can be seen, Hormozgan (47.11%), Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad (47.68%), and North Khorasan (48.36%) have the lowest while Qom (93.92%), Tehran (91.34%), and Isfahan (83.32%) have the highest levels of urbanization, respectively. Figure 5 shows the geographical distribution of urbanization in Iranian provinces based on 2006 Census (see Fig. 5).\n\nAccording to 2006 Census, Sistan and Baluchestan (48.49%), Hormozgan (54.71%), and Golestan (53.28) have the lowest rates of urbanization while Qom (95.18%), Tehran (93.85%) and Alborz (92.64) have the highest rate of urbanization. In Fig. 6, the geographical distribution of urbanization in Iranian provinces based on 2016 Census is depicted (see Fig. 6).\n\nOverall, it can be asserted that increased urbanization in Iran is triggered by factors such as rural–urban migration, which is rooted by industrial development, settlement and concentration of the nomads in new cities, and transformation of some rural areas into cities, especially villages in the vicinity of major cities. For the analysis of changes in the trend of urbanization in Iran, based on data presented in Table 3, coefficient of variation (CV) formula. Expressing the dispersion of data around the mean, this coefficient was obtained by dividing the standard deviation (σ) by mean (μ) and then multiply it by 100.\n\nThis coefficient is shown by Formula 1.\n\nTherefore, this index indicates a change relative to the raw percentage index. Formula 2 shows the coefficient of urban variation in Iran from 2006 to 2016. This coefficient is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the sample (S) by the mean (\\(\\overline {\\mathrm{X}}\\)), as shown in Formula 2.\n\nFor example, in Kermanshah and Khuzestan provinces, the percentage of urban change is higher than that of North Khorasan because their average urbanization is higher. However, they have a lower CV than North Khorasan. For the analysis of urban CV in Iran, provinces can be classified into three groups: The first group comprises the provinces of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, Kurdistan, Gilan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad, Ardabil, Hormozgan, Zanjan, North Khorasan, South Khorasan and Fars, which have the highest CV. These provinces have undergone structural changes during this period with the lifestyle of the people witnessing a change from a traditional rural pattern to an urban one. As a result of the government’s support policies for the urban system, the development of urban centers, and expansion of industrial facilities, this province has witnessed a greater rural–urban migration. In the second group, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Ilam, Markazi, Hamedan, Qazvin, West Azerbaijan, Bushehr, Lorestan, Mazandaran, and Golestan provinces have a moderate CV. This suggests that industrialization in these provinces has lasted in recent decades. In some provinces belonging to this group, including the northern provinces of Iran, people still reside in villages and earn a living in rural areas. The third group consists of industrial provinces such as East Azerbaijan, Khorasan Razavi, Yazd, Semnan, Isfahan, Alborz, Tehran, Qom and Kerman, which has the lowest CV. In these industrial provinces, which have reached a degree of stability, balanced urbanization process is evident. Sistan and Baluchestan province in the southeast is an exception. In this province, due to severe deprivation, unemployment, and limited official activities in cities and villages, the lowest CV belonged to urban population growth and migration tendency."
