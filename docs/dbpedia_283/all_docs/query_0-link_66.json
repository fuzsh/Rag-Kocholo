        "meta_description": "Background Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 (SDG 3.2) is to reduce Under-5 and neonatal mortality rates (U5MR and NMR), two major health systems’ performance indicators, globally by 2030. We aimed to report Iran’s U5MR and NMR status during 2010–2017 and its achievement of SDG 3.2 by 2030, using scenario-based projection.   Study design To estimate the national and subnational levels of U5MR and NMR, we applied an Ensemble Bayesian Model Averaging (EBMA) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Spatio_temporal models. We used all available data sources including: 12-year data from the Death Registration System (DRS), two censuses, and a demographic and health surveys (DHS). This study employed two approaches, Maternal Age Cohort (MAC) and Maternal Age Period (MAP), to analyze summary birth history data obtained from censuses and DHS. In addition, we calculated the child mortality rate directly from DHS using the complete birth history method. National and subnational NMR was projected up to 2030 with a scenario-based method using average Annual Rate of Reduction (ARR) introduced by UN-IGME.   Results In 2017, national U5MR and NMR were 15·2 (12·4–18·0) and 11·8 (10·4–13·2), with an average ARR of 5·1% (2·1–8·9) and 3·1% (0·9–5·8) during 2010–2017, respectively. According to our projection scenarios, 17 provinces have not fulfilled SDG 3.2 for NMR yet, and the current trend (the current trend of NMR improvement in Iran) will not result in reaching SDG for some provinces by 2030; However, if each province has the same neonatal mortality annual reduction rate as the best-performing province in the same region, besides achieving SDG, the national NMR will be reduced to 5·2, and almost 92,000 newborn lives will be saved.   Conclusions Iran has achieved SDG3.2 regarding U5MR and NMR; however, there are provincial inequalities. For all provinces to reach SDG3.2, health policies should focus on reducing provincial inequalities by precise planning for neonatal health care.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nWe studied Iran’s U5MR and NMR during 2010–2017 based on all available measurements to assess its achievement of SDG 3.2. Iran has significantly improved these measures, and has reduced U5MR to 15·2 and NMR to 11·8 by 2017, thus has fulfilled the target in both aspects. Nevertheless, we present two significant points that we faced: First, the discrepancy between the provinces causing an NMR range of 5·2 to 16·2 throughout the country, and second, the matter that the NMR reduction rate has not been as desirable as U5MR reduction, and consequently, the neonatal proportion of U5MR has remarkably increased to 77·7%.\n\nGlobal Burden of Diseases (GBD) and the United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimations (UN-IGME), two key resources that provide estimations on such measures globally, support our results in Iran’s achievement of SDG 3.2 and the declining trends of NMR and U5MR [6, 26]. However, UN-IGME estimates of NMRs were limited to the national level, and GBD did not consider DRS as an important dataset in its estimates of NMRs at the provincial level.\n\nMany determinants have previously been mentioned in the literature for neonatal and under-five mortalities [27, 28]. Since most (77·7%) of our U5MR is attributable to neonatal deaths, we discuss some neonatal mortality determinants here. These determinants can be classified into health-related and non-health-related factors. The most frequently mentioned non-health determinants are education and literacy (especially in women of reproductive age and mothers), mother’s age, family planning (birth interval control and lower total fertility rates), insurance coverage, and socioeconomic status, which directly or indirectly affect other determinants crucially [6, 29].\n\nRegarding the health-related determinants, Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (RMNCH continuum of care) services to reduce preterm labour (PTL), low birth weight (LBW), and congenital anomalies (the major contributors to neonatal death [30]) have been mentioned in the literature [6, 30, 31]. Examples of such services are primary health services for antenatal and newborn care, skilled birth attendants and facility delivery, life-saving interventions for mothers and children, and care for small and sick newborns. These services’ coverage, quality, and utilization are essential factors that can maximize their effectiveness [29, 32]. It is noteworthy that health and non-health determinants cannot be entirely separated since much interaction exists among these two groups. For instance, socioeconomic status can undeniably affect the access to, and the quality of health services received in many settings, or families’ higher literacy would possibly lead them to seek medical care, thus having higher utilization rates in the country.\n\nIran’s decreasing trends in NMR and U5MR, and its achievement of SDG 3.2 can be attributable to its advances in these determinants during the past decades. The total literacy rate has risen outstandingly since 2000 [33]. The number of illiterate young women (per thousand) almost halved from 2008 to 2016 [34]. Moreover, urbanization, which has been shown to improve access to healthcare and, thus, lower child mortality [33], has increased in Iran’s provinces in recent years [35]. In addition to these social improvements, health interventions have also been done. Iran has implemented many RMNCH interventions during the past two decades, namely well-baby care, integrated mother’s healthcare, baby-friendly hospitals, and Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) [36]. The rate of skilled birth attendance has increased markedly in Iran, which according to previous studies, is an important contributor to NMR improvement [36]. Another effective program that has provided better access to health services in Iran is the Family Physician Program since 2005. In this program, family physicians and midwives provide free primary reproductive, maternal, and neonatal services for the population [37]. This program has been impressively successful, although some aspects, such as the quality of the care provided, are yet to be improved [37].\n\nDespite all advances stated earlier, we encountered two noteworthy matters in our study; the remarkable rise in the neonatal proportion of U5MR, and the fact that there is inequality in NMR and U5MR among provinces, and not all of our provinces have fulfilled SDG3.2.\n\nRegarding the increase in the neonatal proportion of under-5 deaths, this pattern is not limited to Iran, and similar trends have been observed in other regions. A study mapping neonatal and child mortalities in 99 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), showed that from 2000 to 2017, this proportion rose from 37·4% to 43·7% [38]. This can probably be attributable to the fact that routine national interventions have an enormous impact on child mortality [38–40]. Improving sanitation, routine childhood vaccination, and effective treatment of infectious diseases that have been an important cause of under-5 death [27, 28], are simple and relatively low-cost though high-impact interventions [38], when compared to the interventions needed for addressing neonatal mortality contributors. According to previous estimations, Iran has succeeded in reducing U5MRs remarkably, considering the mentioned factors [10]. Thus, this can contribute to a significantly high neonatal proportion of U5MRs in Iran.\n\nMost neonatal deaths have been shown to be related to complications associated with PTL, LBW, and also intrapartum events (such as birth asphyxia) [6, 30]. Literature shows that the PTL rate is relatively high in Iran [41], and to diminish this rate, underlying causes need to be addressed. There are many underlying factors that might lead to PTL, including not receiving proper pregnancy care, unwanted pregnancy, mother’s obesity or underweight, low socioeconomic status, etc. [30]. Addressing these root causes to improve PTL rate (as the most important contributor to NMR in the last decade [6]) and thus, reducing neonatal mortality will possibly need much effort, and will be time-consuming and costly. Moreover, in a study from Lancet Every Newborn Series, the most effective interventions to reduce NMR are stated as “Care during labour and birth”, “Immediate newborn care”, and “Care for small and sick newborns” [31]. National coverage of these packages will need resources, infrastructures, and facilities (qualified hospital and delivery facility staff, Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), etc.). Additionally, many studies have shown that only the existence of these interventions would not suffice, and the care quality plays a crucial role [6, 29, 30, 42]. Lohela et al. studied neonatal mortality in 72 LMICS, and showed that facility deliveries and care for sick newborns did not alter NMRs significantly, as long as the care quality is not desirable [32]. However, quality improvement often faces challenges and lacks well-defined strategies [43]. Overall, having affordable, high-quality RMNCH services for every woman and newborn, and improving their utilization of such services is the key to more desirable decreasing trends of NMR, which requires considerable effort and time.\n\nConsidering the observed discrepancy throughout our country, despite the reduction in overall inequality, in some of the provinces, NMR was over three times more than some others. Seventeen provinces still need to achieve the neonatal part of SDG 3.2 target, and according to our projections, 3 of them will not fulfill the target by 2030, if the same trend continues. This is while some other provinces already have much lower than SDG 3.2 NMRs. This inequality has previously been observed in other studies [10, 44]. Most of the provinces with undesirable rates were lower-income provinces and were either located at the borders or were southern provinces. These provinces share similar features, such as a low Human Development Index (HDI) [45], and a lower concentration of healthcare workers [34, 46]. Urbanization is significantly lower in these provinces [35]. Moreover, a study assessing pregnant women’s health literacy manifested unfavorable health literacy levels in pregnant women in the south of Iran [47]. In order to generally reduce the discrepancy between our provinces, future attempts can possibly focus on the above-mentioned factors.\n\nAccording to our scenario-based projections, the most promising target is to improve each provincial NM-ARR to the same rate as the best-performing province in its geographical region. In order to alter the current trends more effectively, considerable effort and investment are needed to ensure every pregnant woman (and her newborn) has access to life-saving interventions, quality primary RMNCH services, and high-quality special care for small and sick newborns [6]. However, one significant matter which has recurrently been mentioned as a determinant of child and neonatal mortality is socioeconomic status and wealth index [29, 44, 48], and the factors that these indices determine, such as nutrition [30]. Poverty remarkably impacts these rates, since it affects the population’s health and non-health risk factors. Regardless of all actions taken to reduce neonatal mortality rates in Iran, the current economic status does not show promising trends. The economic burden due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the sanctions against Iran has caused inflation to surge to over 48%, and according to World Bank, poverty has reached 20% in Iran as of March 2021 [49]. These financial uncertainties might possibly slow Iran’s progression towards achieving optimal scenarios and having SDG 3.2 fulfilled for all provinces.\n\nThere are some limitations to this study. Since DRS was the only available data source for estimating the neonatal mortality rate in this period and there were no additional data sources to calculate DRS’s incompleteness on neonatal death, we had to consider DRS’s incompleteness for under-five death as a proxy of incompleteness for neonatal death. Moreover, there are limited studies in Iran investigating the factors related to neonatal health at the subnational levels during the study period. Thus, we cannot definitively compare NMR results based on neonatal health factors. Our study contains remarkable strengths: 1) we benefited from the maximum reliable data reported by responsible organizations in Iran; 2) we utilized an ensemble BMA model to outperform separate GPR and ST models in all aspects, including prediction accuracy and bias reduction. A major challenge we tried to address was that there is no standard and comprehensive neonatal and child mortality registry in Iran to cover the past 30 years; therefore, we used a variety of data sources and complex statistical methods to aggregate the data points.\n\nAdditionally, since there are many aspects to predicting future NMR trends and myriads of events can affect it, this prediction would be a complicated task. Therefore, our main goal was to provide a method for policymakers to be able to roughly predict their trends and determine which scenario they would want to base their policies on during the next few years. It is in fact necessary for anyone using this method to update the estimations on a regular basis.\n\nIran had favorable declining trends of U5MR and NMR, and has generally achieved SDG 3.2. Nonetheless, there is still inequality among different provinces. Moreover, since the neonatal proportion of U5MR has increased markedly in Iran, special attention needs to be given to NMR determinants. According to our projections, although current decreasing trends are towards NMR improvement, three provincial NMRs will still remain above SDG 3.2 target until 2030. However, if each province operates as the best-performing province in its region, the most suitable outcomes will be attained, and over 90,000 lives will potentially be saved by 2030.\n\nOther countries’ policy-makers can use the method of this study to assess their achievement of SDGs by the year 2030, evaluate their current trend, make more evidence-based alterations to their health programs if needed, and get as close as possible to attaining sustainable development for all. Future research may focus on finding the contributors to the variations we found among provinces, to help fulfilling SDGs in all areas."
