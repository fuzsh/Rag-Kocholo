This province is connected to the Caspian Sea from the north, has a water border with the coastal countries of the Caspian Sea, and has a land border with the Republic of Azerbaijan through Astara. It can be said that the dominant ethnic group in Gilan is Gilak.

The importance of trees among the Gilani is quite palpable, sometimes these same trees are considered as the survivors of the Imams, so they are called noble or elderly. The juice of these trees is considered as a sign the Imams’ blood due to their red color. Pilgrims beg, make vows, and ask God to heal the sick people under these trees. With the child's first teeth, the traditional ceremony of Dandan fashoon is held in which they spread a tablecloth with mirror, scissors, Quran, gold coins, books, pens, and needles; the first thing the child grabs indicates his fate. If he takes Qur'an, he will become a clergy, and if scissors, he will become a hairdresser. Weddings also have a special hierarchy. Even the ceremony of rice planting and harvesting is so important that it is still held during certain times of the year.\n\nHandicrafts\n\nHandicrafts produced in Gilan province embrace a wide range including wood carving, joinery, mosaic work, mat weaving, bamboo weaving, pearl weaving, pottery, ceramics, pumpkin painting, felt weaving, silk weaving, Jajim weaving, kilim weaving, chamush embroidery, crochet, Chadrshab weaving, carpet weaving.
