        "text": "Review Article Volume 1 Issue 4\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Iran, water resources management is a challenging issue due to some problems such as limited power of Iran Department of Environment (IDOE) and Ministry of Energy (MOE) in controlling water withdrawal and pollution sources especially when the pollution source is related to a governmental sector, uneven distribution of population and economic activities, inadequate monitoring of pollution sources and water bodies, lack of suitable cooperation among relevant governmental and non-governmental organizations and inadequate guidelines and standards. Also, climate change and periodic droughts can worsen the quantity and quality condition of water resources. In this paper, by using available data and information and employing a Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response-Outlook framework, general state of water resources in Iran is evaluated.\n\nMethodology (the driver-pressure-state-impact-response (dpsir) framework)\n\nState of water balance\n\nState of iran internal virtual water trade\n\nThe virtual-water content of a product (a commodity, good or service) is defined as \"the volume of freshwater used to produce the product, measured at the place where the product was actually produced. It refers to the sum of the water use in the various steps of the production chain. In Iran, the Kerman Province, which has very limited water resources, exports virtual water. On the other hand, some provinces such as Gilan, Mazandaran as well as provinces located in western part of Iran, which have plenty of water, usually import virtual water or export limited values of virtual water. It shows that uneven investment and development exist in water and agriculture sectors in Iran.\n\nMain pressures on iran water resources\n\nMain impacts\n\nResponses\n\nIn the past 20 years, some strategies have been developed and ratified for water resources management in Iran. These strategies include: Iran general strategies for water resources (2000), Strategies for water resources development in Iran (2003), Iran outlook in 2025 (2003), Iran's strategies for demand management (2010). It looks that the existing strategies can provide a very good platform for acceptable water resources management in Iran. Although the items related to water sector in the fourth and fifth 5-year development plans have been prepared considering the main attitudes presented in the above-mentioned strategies, some of them have partially been applied. Some of the rules ratified by Iran's Islamic Parliament are not in line with the strategies and have caused some problems for water resource management in Iran. For example, based on an act, which was ratified in 2010, owners of several thousand illegal wells got permission for water withdrawal from aquifers which were suffering from water overexploitation. In line with the Iran's water resources strategies, the following policies are proposed for better management of water resources.\n\nGood water governance and integrated water resources management\n\nDeveloping master and regional plans for development considering the water resources potentials.\n\nDeveloping action plans based on the existing strategies proposed for water sector.\n\nImproving the existing cooperation among different organizations and participating stakeholders in decision making process.\n\nRevising rules and developing an integrated act for water sector in Iran.\n\nInstitutional reform for integrated basin-scale management of water resources.\n\nBalancing the water supply and demand relationship with emphasis on demand management.\n\nImproving water supply condition\n\nOptimal management of trans-boundary and shared water resources considering the existing protocols and water demands of ecosystems.\n\nDesalination of sea water for encouraging people to settle near seas.\n\nUtilization of unconventional water using modern treatment and desalination technologies.\n\nRecycling of water and using treated wastewater in agriculture by taking into account hygienic and environmental considerations.\n\nEstimating and allocating environmental water rights of rivers, wetlands and lakes.\n\nRevising the required volume of under design dams considering the recent variability of hydrologic factors as well as economic and environmental criteria.\n\nImproving water use efficiency and demand management\n\nControlling water uses considering the ecological limitations of the basins.\n\nLimiting water withdrawal from aquifers to control the existing negative water balance of aquifers.\n\nReducing agricultural water demands using modern irrigation technologies.\n\nDetermining cropping patterns and cultivation area considering natural and environmental limitations.\n\nProviding food security by cultivating strategic crops and considering the concept of virtual water trading in supplying non-strategic crops.\n\nUtilizing watershed management techniques for basin-scale water and soil conservation.\n\nReducing water loss and unaccounted-for water in urban and rural water distribution systems.\n\nReducing domestic water demands using modern technologies.\n\nRevising the economic and investment structure of water sector\n\nConsidering the economic value of water in decision making and establishing water markets.\n\nRevising the current system of pricing water by taking into account the costs of water supply and treatment.\n\nIncreasing the diversity of investments sources and encouraging the private sector for investing in water sector.\n\nGiving priority to non-structural and supporting projects in investments.\n\nImproving the current system of water monitoring and conservation\n\nReducing the vulnerability of surface and groundwater resources by improving the existing monitoring systems.\n\nProviding strict supervision for water withdrawal from aquifers.\n\nCompleting existing monitoring systems for water quantity and quality.\n\nImproving the current management information systems (MISs).\n\nExtending the coverage of standards and guidelines for conservation and operation of water resources systems.\n\nUsing the capabilities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for water resources conservation.\n\nCapacity building for integrated water resources management\n\nInstitutional capacity building for managing and organizing different sectors.\n\nParticipating water users' organizations for managing water infrastructures.\n\nSupporting and strengthening NGOs.\n\nPublic awareness and participation.\n\nTraining and strengthening human resources.\n\nScientific cooperation and exchange of experiences with international organizations.\n\nConclusion: outlook of Iran water resources\n\nAs all development plans should consider the future dynamics of population, predicting the future population growth pattern and estimating future needs are important steps for planning for water quantity and quality management. In the period of 1994-2014, population growth, migration of people to large cities as well as droughts and climate change have been driving forces for putting pressures on water resources in Iran. In addition, more than 90% of the allocated water in Iran is used by the agriculture sector which has a very low water efficiency and economic productivity. In some regions in Iran, these pressures have caused water stresses as well as many social and environmental issues such as destruction of wetlands, severe drawdown of groundwater table levels and subsidence of lands. These environmental problems are mostly due to human activities and mismanagement rather than droughts and climate change. In the studied period, water resources management strategies and polices have been inefficient and have caused an unacceptable distribution of investments and development projects in water and agriculture sectors. Without revising the current approaches for water governance and management, the existing problems would be intensified in future. But by having good water governance, improving the water management strategies and participating different stakeholders, even during drought conditions, water resources management problems can be solved and a better future would be provided for the current and next generations.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis research is based on a research project entitled \"the fourth report of Iran state of environment\" in Shahid Beheshti University, funded by Iran Department of Environment, Tehran, Iran.\n\nConflict of interest\n\nAuthors declare there is no conflict of interest in publishing the article.\n\nReferences"
