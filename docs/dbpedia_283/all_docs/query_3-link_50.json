        "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nHarsh sanctions against Iran aim to put pressure on the country’s leaders by making life difficult for its citizens. So far, sanctions have succeeded in creating an economic crisis and hurting the welfare of ordinary Iranians. This paper examines the impact of sanctions since 2010 on household consumption and employment. It finds that while household incomes and consumption have taken a serious beating, employment has been more resilient.\n\nThe effect of sanctions on the economy has been twofold, to limit the government’s revenues from oil exports and to cut the country’s trade with the outside world. Reduced export earnings cause devaluation, which fuel inflation and hurt household budgets. Lower government revenues cause economic contraction, which hurts both consumption and employment. Taking advantage of survey data on household consumption, this study shows how a rising trend of per capita expenditures turned negative after 2010, and accelerated downward after the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal in 2018 and the start of the Trump “maximum pressure” campaign.\n\nEmployment took a different trajectory as devaluation increased the profitability of Iran’s non-oil tradable sectors and encouraged import substitution. In particular, employment in manufacturing continued to grow, and only stopped with the arrival of the Covid pandemic in 2020. However, because the modest increase in employment was the result of lower real wages, rising employment could not slow down the decline in living standards. The increase in employment was modest because sanctions limited the ability of Iranian exporters to take advantage of the lower cost of labor to increase their sales abroad.\n\nThe impact of the economic crisis was not distributed equally, with rural households taking the brunt of the crisis. Since 2010, poverty rates have doubled in rural areas, and increased by 60 percent in urban areas. The Islamic Republic’s previous good record of halving the poverty rate in the previous decade, from over 20 percent in 2000 to less than 10 percent in 2010, fell victim to the government’s shrinking revenue base and the speed with which Trump’s sanctions and the pandemic hit the economy.\n\nUnlike in 2011, when a newly introduced cash transfer program shielded the poor from the negative consequences of the tightening of sanctions under President Obama, in the last two years the Islamic Republic’s extensive welfare agencies and its much-weakened cash transfer program have proved ineffective in preventing a large drop in consumption across the spectrum and thus preventing poverty from increasing. Since 2011, about 8 million individuals have descended from the middle class into the lower middle-class strata, while the ranks of the poor has swelled by more than 4 million. The problem was compounded by the arrival of the Covid pandemic in 2020. In addition to lacking resources to assist those who lost their jobs, the government has not been able to easily reach the majority of Iranian workers who hold informal jobs.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSanctions imposed on the trade and finance of a country aim to influence the behavior of that country’s government, but almost always do this indirectly, through pressure that mainly affects the country’s ordinary citizens. Sanctions produce a negative macroeconomic shock that reduces the economic welfare of some or all sectors of the population. Their proponents believe that popular discontent resulting from loss of welfare puts pressure on the government of the sanctioned country to change its policies in the desired direction. Sanctions thus raise two types of questions. First, how large is their impact on average welfare, and who bears most of that impact: the officials who are formally the target of the sanctions, their support base in society or innocent by-standers? The answer determines how likely sanctions are to succeed. Secondly, sanctions raise serious normative concerns, in particular of collective punishment, which has been banned by the Geneva Conventions (Weisbrot and Sachs 2019) [1]. Measuring the impact of sanctions on the living standards of various social groups is accordingly of interest to those who impose sanctions and those who are concerned with the suffering of innocent people caught in the crossfire of international conflicts.\n\nIran has been under the harshest sanctions in modern history for several decades. These intensified after May 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) and began its “maximum pressure” campaign. Iran’s GDP, which stagnated during the first phase of sanctions under President Obama, has since been shrinking. Most recently, the Covid pandemic has added to the damage done by sanctions. This paper examines sanctions’ impact on household welfare, as measured by household consumption and employment survey data. Its estimates show a much greater impact on average consumption than previously suggested by simulations [2]. In addition, survey data make it possible to estimate the degree of setback in different parts of the distribution of consumption.\n\nThe analysis that follows describes how the outcomes of interest, consumption, poverty and employment have changed after the imposition of sanctions. It falls short of a causal analysis in which the link between specific sanctions and outcomes are established and other factors that can influence the outcomes are held constant. In this sense, the study follows others on the impact of economic crises on household welfare that do not identify the mechanisms involved [3]. As with economic crises caused by other large negative macroeconomic shocks, however, there is little doubt that sanctions, by cutting its oil exports and hindering its external trade, have dealt a serious blow to Iran’s economy and the living standards of ordinary Iranians. In the short span between 2016 when sanctions were eased and 2018 when they were reimposed, the economy switched from GDP growth of 13 percent to minus 6 percent. It is, therefore, plausible to speak of impact without implying precise causal identification, when changes in consumption or employment closely follow the economic crisis induced by the imposition of sanctions.\n\nThe study discusses changes in consumption and employment in separate but closely interconnected sections. For most people, vulnerability in consumption is a direct result of insecure access to employment. Income from work supports more than half of consumption expenditures, more so for the poor. Significantly, sanctions may have helped on the employment side, as they appear to have boosted jobs in import-competing sectors. However, because they have cut earnings, as shown in Section III, the overall impact on living standards has been negative.\n\nThe study relies heavily for the bulk of its consumption and employment analysis on micro data from two surveys collected by the Statistical Center of Iran. Household income and expenditure data are reliably reported in the Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS), collected annually for nearly five decades; its micro level data are available since 1984.\n\nEmployment analysis depends heavily on the Labor Force Survey (LFS), collected seasonally and available in micro data since 2005. Reliance on micro-level data is important because trust in Iran’s published economic statistics is low, especially in the West, where the debate on the impact of sanctions is highly contentious, and pundits cite widely divergent statistics to make their points. For example, comparisons of living standards before and after the revolution can be very different [4]. The proportion of people below the poverty line also ranges widely, from 70 percent to less than ten percent. In such a contentious atmosphere, statistics derived from micro data from household surveys are essential for arriving at a reliable picture of the economic situation.\n\nThe paper also briefly discusses how the Iranian government has responded to the shock by increasing social assistance and letting the currency depreciate as a way of stimulating employment [5].\n\nThe main conclusion from the analysis of consumption is that, at least in terms of timing, there is evidence that sanctions have reduced the living standards of the average Iranian and increased poverty. Despite attempts by the government to reach the poor with cash and in-kind transfers, poverty has grown in the last two years, especially in rural areas. During 2011-2012, cash transfers moderated the impact of the Obama sanctions, and poverty rates actually declined. But in 2018, under Trump sanctions, cash transfers were not of much help because their real value had declined due to high inflation, allowing poverty rates to increase.\n\nIn contrast, the conclusion from the analysis of employment is that sanctions may have actually promoted employment. This is because, in response to the loss of oil exports, the government allowed the currency to depreciate rapidly, which stimulated local production of import-competing goods. Employment in general does not fluctuate much in Iran because of labor market rigidities. Depreciation likewise lowered the average wage in the country relative to Iran’s trading partners, thereby increasing the competitiveness of local production.\n\nAn attempt is also made to cover pandemic-related changes in consumption, poverty and employment, but consumption data cover only one month of the pandemic. Covid hit Iran much harder than its neighbors, however, and published reports indicate severe loss of income and jobs. Micro data for the last month of the Iranian year 1398 (19 February-20 March 2020) show a much larger impact of the pandemic relative to the shock dealt by sanctions.\n\nI. HOUSEHOLD WELFARE\n\nAs a large negative shock to the economy, U.S. sanctions have naturally affected the living standards of ordinary Iranians. This is reflected in the most accessible measure of living standards, GDP per capita, as well as in survey-based measures of household consumption. Figures 1 and 2 below show that the rise and fall of GDP per capita and per capita expenditures are closely related. Therefore, the lessons from the national accounts and survey data are similar: a long period of rising living standards came to an end around 2010, when sanctions tightened during the first Obama administration, and the easing of sanction following the 2015 nuclear deal led to robust growth in 2016-2017, which ended quickly once Trump sanctions began in 2018.\n\nA noteworthy feature of Iran’s economy revealed by the national accounts is the difference between the trends in GDP and non-oil GDP, which follow the same path as the per capita values depicted in Figure 1. Non-oil GDP, which measures economic activity by 98 percent of the Iranian work-force and is therefore more closely related to employment and productivity, continued to grow when GDP began to falter after 2008. The fact that other sectors were able to increase their share of GDP following the loss of oil exports is a less appreciated feature of the economy that has played an important role in its ability to withstand sanctions [6]. However, this resilience at the macro level did not prevent a sharp decline in living standards, observed in survey data and shown below, because the increase in employment was in large part made possible by a decline in real wages.\n\nA. AVERAGE LIVING STANDARDS\n\nSurvey data tell an even more alarming story when we disaggregate average consumption by region. Figure 2 depicts average per capita expenditures for Tehran, other urban areas and rural areas deflated by the consumer price index for rural and urban areas, as well as a cost of living index derived from the poverty lines for the rural and urban areas of all provinces [9]. According to this measure, while all regions benefited from growth before 2010, mainly thanks to rising oil revenues, the contraction was not equally shared. All were hit hard initially with the temporary oil price collapse in 2008, which was quickly followed by sanctions [10]. Whereas in Tehran average consumption stayed flat after 2008, in the rest of the county it declined significantly (by 30 percent in rural areas and 11.6 percent in other urban areas). Surprisingly, Tehran residents on average did better (by 9.1 percent) in 2019 than in 2010.\n\nThe differential impact of economic contraction on average consumption in Tehran and the rest of the country could have a number of reasons. Tehran’s economy is more diversified, enabling residents to adjust more effectively to sanctions and recession. Also, the share of state and white collar jobs, which were better protected during the crisis, is higher. Rural and smaller urban areas have fared least well. They are more distant—geographically and politically—from the centers of power and the public purse, so benefit less from government social protection policies. This distance increased with the ascent of the neoliberal administration of President Hassan Rouahni, which replaced the populist government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2013.\n\nThe more pronounced decline in rural consumption is probably due to additional factors. The agrarian economy has been under stress from environmental factors, such as a decade-long drought and falling water tables [11]. Higher inflation in rural areas is another potential factor, but expenditures have been deflated using separate Consumer Price Indices (CPI’s) for rural and urban areas. Since 2011, when the divergence in poverty rates between rural and urban areas emerged, prices have risen by a factor of 3.3 in urban areas and 3.4 in rural areas. Another potential factor is selective migration. Average consumption can decline faster in rural areas if the more affluent households leave for the cities. But little evidence exists to support this conjecture. According to the Labor Force Survey, which asks if a worker has recently changed place of residence, on average 0.3 percent of the rural population moved to cities per year during 2018-2019. This was lower than the 0.5 percent migration per year averaged during 2010-2012, when rural incomes were boosted by uniform cash transfers, and poverty actually fell. Furthermore, the more educated (and therefore the more prosperous) have not especially engaged in migration in recent years [12].\n\nThese figures correct two widely held misunderstandings regarding the current state of Iran’s economy. The proponents of sanctions often point to economic stress after 2011 as evidence that it is in free fall and close to collapse, raising hopes that tighter sanctions would soon force Iran’s leaders to capitulate. Occasionally, to deflect criticism that sanctions are inhumane because they hurt ordinary Iranians during a pandemic, they blame the suffering on corruption and economic mismanagement [14]. Corruption and mismanagement no doubt play a role in the overall sluggish economic growth of the past four decades, but they do not explain changes in the growth rate from one decade to the next. The data in Figure 1 show that, first, the economy has not been in free fall; in fact, the level of economic activity, more accurately measured by the non-oil GDP, has been quite stable and rising slowly (see also Table 13 in the appendices). Secondly, the fact that incomes were rising before sanctions hit around 2010 undermines the claim that inherent factors are responsible for subsequent stagnation of living standards.\n\nDivergent paths for the three regions is another lesson derived from this Figure. After the end of the destructive war with Iraq, in 1989, spatially adjusted consumption levels were about the same in all three regions. However, by 2007, when average consumption peaked, consumption in Tehran was one-third higher than rural and 15 percent higher than other urban areas. This divergence may be in part due to the changing composition of the Iranian population by residence. Each year roughly 0.5 percent of the rural population becomes urban, some by moving to urban areas while others by having their village reclassified as urban. In Iran, villages with more than 5000 population can petition the state for reclassification. Although selection by income or education does not appear to be strong in migration to urban areas, reclassification is. More prosperous villages are more likely to expand and become urban. As a result, selection may be responsible for the faster decline in consumption in rural areas over the last decade, though not for a single year, such as 2019.\n\nB. POVERTY\n\nIn most developing countries, the poor are more vulnerable to negative external shocks, because they lack the savings to ride out a temporary shortfall in income. They also lack the political power to direct government resources toward their needs. Iran is known as a populist state with strong revolutionary rhetoric in favor of the poor.\n\nWhether it has been better able to shield its poorest citizens from the economic crisis induced by sanctions can be answered with fair precision, because Iran regularly collects income and expenditure surveys and, more importantly, releases their results in unit record for use by researchers. These micro data provide a detailed view of the distribution of household welfare since 1984 and during sanctions. While the exact causal link between sanctions and the poverty status of individuals is difficult to establish, the timing of changes in poverty are highly suggestive of such a link.\n\nPoverty is usually measured by first locating a nutritionally or socially determined threshold of income or expenditures below which people are considered poor. Iran does not publish official poverty lines, as its social protection system is not based on income data, so this paper uses a set of lines based on a methodology proposed and implemented for rural and urban areas at the province level [15]. Expenditures per capita are expressed in 2019 prices and adjusted for cost of living differences. A $5.50 poverty line (in Purchasing Power Parity dollars) that the World Bank has proposed for upper middle income countries is used to estimate the percentage of individuals below this threshold [16]. The choice of a particular line obviously matters for the estimated poverty level but not for its trend, our main concern. Some may consider $5.50 too low, but a higher level does not alter the observed pattern of change. Figure 3 shows poverty rates for the past three decades (1984-2019) for urban Tehran, other urban and rural areas. Table 12 in the appendices presents the data used to generate the graph. Because adjustment is made for the higher living cost in Tehran and other urban areas, poverty rates are not necessarily higher in rural areas, where nominal incomes are lower. In fact, until 2000, urban poverty rates were higher than rural. Over time, as the urban population’s proportion has risen, poverty has become more prevalent in cities. In 2019, of ten million individuals identified as poor in these calculations, 4.8 million lived in rural areas, 4.4 million in urban areas and less than 1 million in Tehran.\n\nIn all three regions, poverty rates follow the rise and fall of the average living standards observed in Figure 2. As expected, poverty is higher and more volatile in rural than urban areas or Tehran. All areas experienced declines in poverty rates during 2000-2007, when oil revenues were high and rising. Poverty stayed relatively stable and low until 2012, when Iran’s currency collapsed under the weight of Obama sanctions, after which they have been rising. The impact of the 2010 cash transfer program the Ahmadinejad government initiated is evident in falling poverty rates during 2011-2012, despite the tightening of sanctions and a stagnating economy [17]. After 2012, all poverty rates began to increase, rural poverty the fastest. The deepening economic crisis following the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign is evident in the sharply rising poverty rates across the country, from 8.1 percent in 2017 to 12.1 percent in 2019. The increase of four percentage points means that 3.2 million Iranians fell into poverty in two years [18]. In 40 years, poverty rates have risen twice before: in the mid-1980s as a result of the destruction due to the war with Iraq; and in the mid-1990s, when post-war restructuring caused a recession. The most obvious reason for the sharper increase in rural poverty after 2012 is the economic crisis precipitated by the tightening of sanctions.\n\nAs with the consumption decline discussed above, other factors such as drought and government policy may have contributed to the deepening rural poverty. Though sanctions in 2011-2012 were not as severe, since they did not reduce Iran’s oil income as much as in the last two years, the introduction of a large cash transfer program did much to limit rural poverty. The Rouhani government could have done the same despite the tighter budgetary situation; reducing subsidies on energy (and even taxing it) is generally a progressive type of revenue generation. It chose not to replace the subsidies with cash transfers early on since it was ideologically opposed to cash handouts. When it hiked gasoline prices in 2018, it did not offer compensating transfers until violent street protests forced its hand.\n\nC. THE MIDDLE CLASS\n\nThe economic crisis has adversely affected the welfare of individuals across the income distribution, not just the poor. Whereas the number of those below or close to the poverty line matters because they are least able to deal with a loss of income, the size of the middle income groups also deserves attention. For one thing, the poor qualify for various types of government assistance, while middle income groups do not and must depend on their own sources of income. The “lower middle class”—those not far enough above the poverty line to keep that status as the crisis deepens—are as vulnerable as the poor and need social protection in a deteriorating economy. The concern with the state of the “middle class”— those far enough above the poverty line not to be at risk of becoming poor—is damage to longer term social and economic development. The middle class is generally considered the main driving force in social and economic development, its size associated with many markers of economic growth such as better education, health and infrastructure, as well as factors associated with democracy such as inclusive growth, good governance and political stability [20]. Freed from the daily struggle with mere survival and feeding their families, it becomes interested in building institutions that promote good governance and economic growth rather than support zero-sum policies of redistribution, and believes in greater engagement with the global economy as a means to achieve these goals [21].\n\nMeasuring the size of the middle class, as in the case of the poor, involves defining income or expenditure thresholds. This paper adopts the thresholds commonly used in development economics that define the middle class as those earning (or spending) above twice the poverty line ($11 per person per day in PPP dollars for Iran) [22]. Other income groups are defined similarly: those between the poverty line and the middle class are labeled the lower middle class; those above $55 (ten times the poverty line) as upper middle class. Since Iran’s truly rich do not appear in the HEIS sample, this highest income group is labeled upper middle class. Per capita expenditures are again adjusted by cost of living differences across rural and urban areas in all provinces.\n\nThe general increase in poverty in Iran in recent years and the plight of the rural population in particular have been the focus above, but poverty is not limited to rural areas, and there are as many poor persons in urban as in rural areas (about 5 million each). If poverty is not simply a matter of geography, it is important to ask what other characteristics of individuals besides location make them more vulnerable to becoming poor. To answer this, the paper takes advantage of the 2018-2019 panel of households to estimate the probability of an individual becoming poor – that is, being above the poverty line in 2018 and below it in 2019—as a function of location (rural-urban and province), and household characteristics such as age, gender and education of the household head, household size and per capita expenditures. A simple probit function is estimated for the probability of being poor in 2019 conditional on not being poor in 2018. The results presented in Table 6 offer several interesting insights.\n\nPerhaps the most important is that during 2018-2019, conditional on household characteristics, urban residents were more likely to fall into poverty than rural residents, a finding that should be of value to Iran’s welfare organizations. This does not contradict what was observed in Figure 3, namely that rural residents on average have been at greater risk of poverty in recent years. The difference can be explained by variations in the characteristics of individuals in rural and urban areas. The probit analysis holds several of these characteristics constant, so what is compared is the probability of an individual living in a household with the average levels of household income, head’s education, etc., living in an urban area with a person with the same characteristics who lives in a rural area. These probabilities, which can be estimated from the coefficients reported in Table 6, estimate that with household characteristics constant, an urban individual was two-and-a-half times more likely to become poor in 2019 than a rural person (4.1 percent vs. 1.6 percent) [34].\n\nLiving in a family headed by a woman increases the risk of falling into poverty by 37 percent (in 2019, about 8 percent of individuals lived in such households). Predictably, health insurance reduces that risk by 35 percent. Also predictably, education is an important determinant. Those living in households whose heads have more than a high school diploma face a risk of less than 0.1 percent, compared to 7.2 percent for those in families whose head is illiterate (about 15 percent of individuals lived in such households). Those living in larger households are at greater risk of becoming poor, but risk decreases with the age of the household head. Living in households headed by older individuals decreases the likelihood of becoming poor. The oldest group (60+) has the lowest likelihood (2.3 percent) compared to the youngest (15- 29) age group (12 percent).\n\nThe coefficients of province dummies indicate that the effects of location on the likelihood of falling into poverty extend beyond the rural/urban division [35]. For example, all else equal, a resident of Tehran, the most advantaged province, is three times more likely to fall into poverty than a similar person in Sistan, the least advantaged province. This could be because, unlike in Tehran, in Sistan the characteristics that make a person poor are the same as those that determine descent into poverty. This means that the non-poor in Sistan are at a lower risk of becoming poor than the non-poor in Tehran. The lesson is that, despite the much lower poverty rate in more affluent areas such as Tehran, their residents are at a greater risk of falling into poverty. Simply put, location of residence is not a good predictor of vulnerability to the economic crisis.\n\nII. EMPLOYMENT\n\nDespite the significance of cash transfers, for most Iranians employment is still the main source of income. In 2019, the share of earnings from wage and salary work and self-employment accounted for 53.3 percent of rural and 47 percent of urban household incomes. The main sources of unearned income are retirement pay, cash transfers of various kinds and rent. Income from wage employment is more important than self-employment, accounting for 63 percent of all earnings. This suggests that any decrease in employment or wages would have a strong negative effect on average household incomes. Thus, to better understand how the negative shock of sanctions is transmitted to household budgets, it is important to understand what has happened to employment. The review of trends below suggests employment has been relatively stable compared to incomes and consumption.\n\nA. TRENDS IN EMPLOYMENT\n\nA more detailed view of the employment structure is available from Table 8. The diversity of sanctions’ impact on different sectors is seen in the divergent behavior of employment shares in manufacturing relative to other sectors in the industry group, such as construction. Whereas the share of construction in total employment was only slightly below manufacturing in the early years of the decade (16.8 vs. 15.8 percent), by 2019 it was considerably lower (17.4 vs. 12.7 percent). The difference is that construction declined as overall demand fell, but manufacturing was helped by real devaluation of the national currency, which promoted the substitution of local for foreign goods.\n\nThe large share of services, a sector not directly impacted by sanctions, explains employment’s stability in the face of sanctions. But the pandemic had the opposite effect, as services suffered the largest decline in employment. Whereas by summer 2020 the loss of industry jobs was limited to 43,000 (about 0.5 per cent of all industrial workers), the loss in services was over 800,000 (7.2 percent).\n\nD. EMPLOYMENT VULNERABILITY AND INFORMALITY\n\n1. PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE\n\nIn 2019, 13.4 percent of all workers and 21.6 percent of all wage and salaried workers were in the public sector, down from 22.7 and 43.1 percent, respectively, in 1997, when public employment peaked. Government workers have stayed relatively constant, around 3.5 million. Public sector jobs are traditionally considered more secure than private sector jobs or self-employment. However, their security has changed significantly in the last two decades, as ever more employees are hired on contracts of less than a year so as to avoid tenure. As a result, job security is no longer defined by public employment, but rather by the worker’s education and the degree of formality of employment. In 2019, 27.1 percent of the employed had a college degree or above, and another 29.5 percent had high school diplomas. These ratios are lower in the private sector, where 52.9 per cent of workers had less than high school degrees, 29.9 percent had only that degree, and 17.2 percent had at least a college degree. A large proportion of those with less than high school degrees are likely also informal workers, whose jobs can be considered vulnerable.\n\n2. INFORMALITY\n\nInformality in employment presents a serious challenge to social protection in times of economic crisis. In advanced countries, where the vast majority are registered and covered by unemployment insurance, workers are automatically protected from negative economic shocks, at least for a period. Even after unemployment insurance disappears, the fact that their previous employment status is recorded makes it easier for the government to reach them with further income assistance. Informal workers, on the other hand, lack unemployment insurance and a pension, so are not only at more risk of falling into poverty when a crisis hits, but are also harder to reach with additional help. For these reasons, the degree of informality in the labor market is an important determinant of the severity with which an economic crisis causes distress in household welfare.\n\nLike most developing countries, Iran has its share of informal employment, but its labor force surveys do not offer a ready indicator of the extent. The labor force survey does not ask if workers have a contract or are otherwise registered with the authorities, so a precise measure of informality is not available. But an estimate can be derived from some reported job characteristics. Public sector jobs are, of course, formal, as are jobs that offer health insurance or pension. The survey distinguishes private and public employment and asks if a worker receives health insurance through an employer. There is no question about enrollment in a pension or the national social security program.\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\n\nThere is no question that severe sanctions since 2011 have dealt a large blow to Iran’s economy. They have cut oil exports to a trickle and disrupted its international trade. There is also no doubt that other factors, internal and external, have also played a part in the last decade’s sluggish growth. Lower oil prices since 2014 have further reduced revenues, while economic mismanagement and corruption have prevented appropriate policy responses to the external shocks. Given the magnitude of the external shock due to sanctions, no policy could have prevented an economic crisis or fully shielded ordinary Iranians from a loss of living standards. One contribution of this paper is to measure the extent of the decline for different regions and on different income groups. How much of the decline is due to sanctions or which policies could have better limited the damage are questions that it cannot answer.\n\nWith respect to living standards, the main findings are: First, average per capita consumption has fallen significantly since U.S. sanctions tightened in 2011. In 2019, it was down by 17.7 percent from 2010 and back at the level reached in 2002. Secondly, the per capita consumption loss was not equally shared. Rural areas were worst hit,followed by urban areas excluding Tehran. Compared to 2010, average consumption was down by 30 percent in rural areas and 22.6 percent in other urban areas, but up by 9 percent in Tehran.\n\nThirdly, poverty rates increased across the three regions. Nationally, they nearly doubled, from the lowest point of 6.4 percent in 2012 to 12.1 in 2019. That is, four million more people had consumption levels below the internationally set poverty line of $5.50 PPP in 2019 than in 2012. As expected, poverty rates were the highest in rural areas (22.9 percent), followed by other urban areas (8.8 percent) and Tehran (7.5 percent). Significantly, a government cash transfers policy implemented by ex-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad prevented poverty rates from rising after the first wave of sanctions, in 2011-2012, and even lowered them. During the second phase, 2018-2019, the Rouhani administration was much less generous with cash transfers, in part because of ideological opposition and in part because it lacked the necessary resources.\n\nFourthly, taking advantage of panel data collected in 2018 and 2019, probit estimates reveal household characteristics that are most correlated with falling into poverty in 2019. The analysis shows some common patterns found elsewhere in the developing world, namely that belonging to households headed by a woman, a less-educated person and larger in size put a person at greater risk of becoming poor. But, surprisingly, urban residents were more likely to fall into poverty than a rural person with the same characteristics, though the poverty rate is higher on average in rural than in urban areas.\n\nFinally, the impact of the economic crisis has been less severe on employment than on consumption. This is in part because employment in Iran is fairly rigid and does not respond quickly to contractions in out-put. It is also because the government allowed prices to rise and the currency to depreciate rapidly, making local production more competitive in certain manufacturing sectors. While this policy made employment relatively resilient to the shock of sanctions, it was not able to protect real incomes from falling, since the depreciation that stabilized employment caused real wages to decline.\n\nAPPENDICES"
