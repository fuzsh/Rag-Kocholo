        "text": "Purpose: To report the prevalence and the associated factors leading to cataract among the Iranian population living in Gilan Province, Iran. Methods: This population-based cross-sectional study was performed from June to November 2014 on 2,975 residents aged ≥ 50 years old living in urban and rural regions of the Gilan Province in Iran. A representative sample of residents in the province was recruited into the study through door-to-door visiting, and baseline data were collected by questionnaire. All participants were referred to the medical center for comprehensive ophthalmic examination, laboratory tests, and blood pressure measurement. Results: Among the population, 2,588 (86.99%) subjects were eligible to be included in this study, categorized either into the cataract or the non-cataract group. The mean age of participants was 62.59 ± 8.92 years, and 57.5% were female. Higher prevalence of cataract was found in individuals of older ages (odds ratio (OR) = 1.13; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.10 to 1.16; P < 0.001) and a history of previous ocular surgery (OR = 5.78; 95% CI = 2.28 to 14.63; P < 0.001). At the same time, a lower prevalence of cataract was seen in patients exposed to sunlight for more than 4 h per day (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.73; P = 0.001). Conclusion: Cataract affects 50.50% of the study population, especially those over 80. The mildest form of cataract, grade zero, is the most common. Surgery for cataract has good outcomes. The risk of cataract is higher for those older or who have had eye surgeries. People not affected by cataract tend to be exposed to more sunlight.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - Prevalence of cataract and its contributing factors in Iranian elderly population\n\nT2 - the Gilan eye study\n\nAU - Ramezani, Amirreza\n\nAU - Sabbaghi, Hamideh\n\nAU - Katibeh, Marzieh\n\nAU - Ahmadieh, Hamid\n\nAU - Kheiri, Bahareh\n\nAU - Yaseri, Mehdi\n\nAU - Moradian, Siamak\n\nAU - Alizadeh, Yousef\n\nAU - Soltani Moghadam, Reza\n\nAU - Medghalchi, Abdolreza\n\nAU - Etemad, Koorosh\n\nAU - Behboudi, Hassan\n\nN1 - © 2023.
