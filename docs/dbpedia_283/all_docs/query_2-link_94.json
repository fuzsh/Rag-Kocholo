        "text": "Forests are considered complex ecosystems with high levels of biodiversity that play an important role in carbon sequestration and soil and water management. They have a critical role in economic, aesthetic and cultural values (Pourhosseini et al. 2020; Guo et al. 2023; Azizi et al. 2023). Unfortunately, human activities, such as deforestation and climate change are destroying forest ecosystems around the world. Due to these ecosystem changes, genetic diversity in natural habitats eventually decreases through adaptation to local environmental changes (Vranckx et al. 2012). Therefore, the isolation of natural populations leads to real damage to genetic diversity in tree populations, reducing gene flow, increasing levels of inbreeding, and the risk of genetic bottlenecks (Moran-Lopez et al. 2016). Among tree species, oaks (Quercus spp.) ply an important role in dealing with forest fragmentation. The Quercus genus includes between 400 and 600 species. All species can be divided into two subgenera (the cupule is imbricatescaled or lamellated), including Quercus and Cyclobalanopsis (an et al. 2017; Xiong et al. 2020). The main Quercus species are found in Europe, northern Africa, Asia, and North America (Du et al. 2007; Wronska-Pilarek et al. 2016).\n\nThe fruit of Quercus species, known as acorns, along with leaves and bark, have several nutrition and health benefits for both humans and animals. Acorns contain several phytoconstituents with significant differences between species due to their high variability. The main bioactive phytochemicals include phenolic and volatile organic compounds, sterols, aliphatic alcohols, vitamins (especially vitamin E), and fatty acids (Vinha et al. 2016; Lamke et al. 2018). Oak wood plays an important role in wine maturation in oak barrels. Moreover, its timber can be used to prepare building materials. On the other hand, this forest tree has significant roles in carbon fixation and sequestration, while soil and water conservation are other benefits of this valuable forest tree (Li et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2011). Therefore, analyzing genetic diversity in these natural populations is important in designing tree improvement programs and conservation strategies. Conservation of natural variation plays a key role in the future evolution of the species (Zhang et al. 2013; Xu et al. 2018).\n\nMolecular markers are known as powerful and reliable biotechnological tools for studying genetic diversity in plant germplasm and deciphering evolutionary relationships (Ghafoor et al. 2012). In recent decades, several types of molecular markers have been proposed and designed for genetic research. Inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers have been proposed as an alternative technique with the reliability and many advantages of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (Wang et al. 2008). This type of marker involves amplification of genomic segments flanked by inversely oriented and nearly spaced SSR sequences using a single primer or a pair of SSR–based primers anchored by 1–4 purine or pyramidine residues at the 5’ or 3’ ends. Anchor nucleates and repeat sequences can be freely selected, resulting in the amplification of a many more bands per primer than other techniques, i.e. random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Wang et al. 2008). In recent years, advances in biotechnology have resulted in development of several functional and gene-based molecular markers, such as start codon–targeted polymorphism (SCoT), CAAT-box derived polymorphism (CBDP), conserved DNA–derived polymorphism (CDDP), and etc. (Pour-Aboughadareh et al. 2017). Among gene–based markers, CBDP is a new promoter–targeted system that uses the conserved CAAT–box nucleotide sequence (GGCCAATCT) of plant promoters (Benoist et al. 1980). This system is a PCR–based DNA marker, and its primers consist of 18 nucleotides with a central CCAAT nucleotide (Singh et al. 2014). The high polymorphism rate, low cost and release of extensive genetic information, distinguish this type of marker from other dominant marker techniques (Singh et al. 2018). This marker system has been widely used for evaluate genetic diversity in many plant species (Heikrujam et al. 2015; Etminan et al. 2018, 2019; Pour-Aboughadareh et al. 2022; Bokaei et al. 2023).\n\nIn recent years, several investigations have focused on the genetic diversity and structure of Quercus species, such as Q. mongolica (Ueno et al. 2008), Q. acutissima (Zhang et al. 2013), Q. variabilis (Shi et al. 2017), Q. austrocochinchinensis (An et al. 2017), Q. fabri (Xiong et al. 2020), Q. rubra (Pettenkofer et al. 2019), Q. robur (Kesic et al. 2021), Q. liatungensis (Guo et al. 2021), Q. brantii (Alikhani et al. 2014), Q. infectoria (Rahimi et al. 2017)d ilex (Fernadez-i-Marti et al. 2018), so each recorded high levels of inter– and intra–population variability. Among Quercus species, Q. brantti and Q. infectoria are endemic to Iran (Panahi et al. 2012). The main habitats of these species are distributed in the Zagros mountains. Q. brantii Lindl. (known as Persian oak and Zagros oak) is native to Iran, Turkey, Iraq and Syria and is considered one of the most important woody species of Zagros forests (Panahi et al. 2012). The Zagros regions cover about 20% of the forests in the western part of Iran, and it has been proved that the age of this vegetation zone is about 5,500 years (Marvie-Mohajer et al. 2012; Ahmadi et al. 2014). Moreover, the region is considered a strategic ecosystem due to its various services, such as socio-economic, biological and valuable environmental factors (Mahdavi et al. 2015; Ghadirian et al. 2018). Zagros forests are highly vulnerable to various environmental stresses, such as soil erosion, rising temperatures, reduced rainfall and drought, fires, dust, human impact, and pests, which pose a serious threat to the future of the area (Hosseini et al. 2011). Oak forests are the most common forests in the western part of Iran (especially Kermanshah, Lorestan, Ilam and Kurdistan provinces), but information on their genetic diversity is limited. Hence, the main objective of the study was to assess genetic diversity and population structure in a set of Persian oak using ISSR and CBDP markers. Another goal of study was to evaluate the effectiveness of markers used in providing genetic data in this germplasm.\n\nPlant materials\n\nA total 48 individuals of Iranian oak (Quercus brantii var. persica and Q. infectoria) were sampled from different regions of Kermanshah province, located in the western part of Iran (Table 1; Fig. 1).\n\nGenomic DNA isolation and PCR amplification\n\nTotal genomic DNA for each individual tested was isolated from young leaves according to the CTAB protocol with minor modifications (Doyle and Doyle 1987). The quality of the isolated DNA was checked by electrophorese in a 0.8% agarose gel. Genotyping was carried out using 19 ISSR and 13 CBDP primers using the protocols described by Etminan et al. (2016) and Etminan et al. (2018), respectively. The repeatability of each primer was determined. Details of the primer sequences are shown in Table 2. PCR products were visualized on 1.50% agarose gels stained with Safeview II and photographed under UV light using a gel documentation device.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe banding patterns obtained by each primer were scored as 0 and 1 for the absent and presence band, respectively. The discriminatory parameters of the primers, such as the total number of amplified bands (TAB), the number of polymorphic bands (NPB), the polymorphism information content (PIC) and the marker index (MI) were computed based on the formulas described by Powell et al. (1996). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed to determine the proportion of variation between and among populations, using GenAlEx ver. 6.5. (Peakall and Smouse 2006). The level of genetic diversity determined by indicators of genetic variation, such as the number of observed and effective alleles (Na and Ne, respectively), Nei’s genetic diversity (H), Shannon’s information index (I) and percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) using GenAlEX ver. 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2006). Genetic relationships between individuals were determined by cluster analysis using the neighbor–joining (NJ) algorithm. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) was performed using GenAlEX ver. 6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 2006). Mixed–model based clustering was carried out to examine the population structure of the evaluated individuals using STRUCTURE ver. 2.3.4 software (Pritchard et al. 2000). Each K ranged from 1 to 10 and was carried out in 10 independent runs. For each run, the initial burn-in period was set to 50,000, followed by 50,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations. The online program STRUCTURE HARVESTER (Earl and von Holdt 2012) was used to estimate the number of actual subpopulations (∆K).\n\nMarkers polymorphism\n\nThe 19 ISSR primers amplified a total of 285 bands, 234 of which were polymorphic (Table 2). The number of polymorphic bands (NPB) amplified by each primer ranged from 7 (by ISSR-8 and ISSR-15) to 16 (by ISSR-3, ISSR-9, and ISSR-14) with an average of 12.3 per primer. Moreover, the percentage of polymorphic bands in all primers used ranged from 65% (for ISSR-17) to 100 (for ISSR-1 and ISSR-10) with an average of 82.1% polymorphism. PIC values ranged from 0.33 (for ISSR-5) to 0.45 (for ISSR-4) with a mean of 0.39. The mean MI was 4.9 and ranged from 2.7 (for ISSR-15) to 6.9 (for ISSR-3 and ISSR-9). In the CBDP analysis, the 13 primers used amplified a total of 125 bands, of which 108 bands were polymorphic (Table 2). The average TAB was 9.6 and ranged from 7 (for CBDP-7, CBDP-8, and CBDP-18) to 14 (for CBDP-11). TPB ranged from 5 to 12 bands with an average of 8.3, and the minimum and maximum bands were observed for CBDP-7 and CBDP-11 primers, respectively. The percentage of polymorphism bands ranged from 71% (for CBDP-7) to 100% (for CBDP-8 and CBDP-20), with an average of 86% polymorphism. The average PIC value was 0.42, with CBDP-17 and CBDP-2 primers showing the lowest (0.34) and highest (0.47) values, respectively. MI ranged from 2 to 4.7 with an average of 3.5, and the CBDP-18 and CBDP-11 primers showed minimum and maximum values, respectively.\n\nGenetic variation analysis\n\nTo determine genetic variation within and between populations, an analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was carried out using ISSR, CBDP, and ISSR + CBDP genotyping data (Table 3). The percentage of genetic variation within species (93%) was higher than between them (7%).\n\nClassification patterns\n\nGenetic distance (GD) coefficients between the pairs of oak samples studied were calculated using the binary matrices obtained for ISSR, CBDP, and ISSR + CBDP. Jaccard’s GD coefficients ranged from 0.23 to 0.89, from 0.24 to 0.86, and from 0.30 to 0.82 for ISSR, CBDP, and combined data, respectively. Based on the calculated GD coefficients, cluster analyses were conducted. For ISSR markers, all samples tested were grouped into three main clusters (Fig. 2A). The two first clusters consisted of all Q. brantii var. persica samples along with two Q. infectoria samples, while the third cluster included all Q. infectoria (except for numbers 27 and 28).\n\nThe dendrogram constructed from the CBDP markers showed a clear clustering of the samples studied into three main groups. This grouping followed a geographical distribution (Fig. 2B). The first cluster consisted of all Q. brantii var. persica samples belonging to the Dalahoo and Gilen-e-Gharb populations and two samples from Q. infectoria. The second cluster included all samples of Q. infectoria. Samples belonging to Q. brantii var. persica from the Paveh region were grouped in the third cluster. Cluster analysis using combined marker data (Fig. 2C) showed that all samples of Q. infectoria were grouped according to their geographical origin. Moreover, Q. brantii var. persica from Paveh was grouped into a separate cluster. Other accessions of this species from the Dalahoo and Gilan-e-Gharb regions were grouped into two separate clusters. The PCoA results confirmed the grouping patterns obtained using cluster analysis (Fig. 3). In all analyses (for ISSR, CBDP and combined data), the groupings were consistent with the geographical origin of the oak samples studied. For example, samples from the Dalahoo and Gilan-e-Gharb or Paveh and Javan-rood regions of each species were separated near each other.\n\nPopulation structure\n\nThe population structure of the 48 oak samples studied was analyzed based on ISSR and CBDP data. Based on ISSR data, structure analysis classified all samples into three subpopulations (K = 3). The first subpopulation consisted of all Q. brantii var. persica sampled from the Dalahoo and Gilan-e-Gharb regions and two Q. infectoria from the Dalahoo region. The second subpopulation included all Q. brantii var. persica collected from the Paveh region and one sample of this species from the Gilan-e-gharb region. All individuals of Q. infectoria from Dalahoo aand two samples from the Javanrood region were grouped into a third subpopulation. The other individuals from the Paveh and Javanrood regions were considered an admixture group (Fig. 4A). Structure analysis using CBDP markers identified four subpopulations (K = 4). All individuals of Q. brantii var. persica from the Paveh region were grouped into first subpopulation. Six individuals of Q. infecrotia from the Dalahoo region and one sample from Javanrood were grouped in the second subpopulation. The third subpopulation included all Q. infectoria samples from the Paveh and Javanrood regions. All Q. brantii var. persica from Gilan-e-Gharb and Dalahoo formed the fourth subpopulation (Fig. 4B). As a result of the structure analysis, it seems that the CBDP markers showed a clear classification pattern of the oak samples studied, consistent with their geographical distribution.\n\nBiodiversity plays a key role in the adaptation of forest tree populations to a changing climate, as well as in conservation programs in the future (Kesic et al. 2021). Based on a different number of observed traits and a wide range of quantitative and morphological traits, biodiversity was assessed for populations of: Crataegus (Betancourt-Olvera et al. 2018; Wronska-Pilarek et al. 2013), Robinia pseudoacacia (Wegiel et al. 2017; Stachowiak-Wencek et al. 2020), Abies alba (Wrońska-Pilarek et al. 2020), and Salix (Maciejewska-Rutkowska et al. 2021). Among forest trees, oak is one of the most economically and ecologically valuable woody species. The northwestern and western parts of Iran are known as one of the oak’s main places of origin. The Zagros Mountains located in these regions include extensive habitats for various oak species. Due to wide geographical distribution, complex habitat conditions, and a high degree of gene flow between oak species, there is a high degree of complexity in terms of genetic diversity and genetic structure (Xiong et al. 2020). Therefore, assessing the genetic diversity and population structure of different oak species can be considered one of the most important tasks in conservation and breeding programs. In this regard, molecular markers play a key role in determining genetic variation and structure analyses. In recent decades, numerous molecular markers have been proposed and developed for genetic research of all plant species (Poczai et al. 2013). Advances in biological tools have led to the emergence of several types of gene-based markers that they have many advantages over other earliest types. One of the new is the CAAT-box derived polymorphism (CBDP) technique. It is very useful in analyzing genetic diversity and population structure due to its high polymorphism rate in conserved regions and high reliability (Singh et al. 2014; Hamidi et al. 2014; Heikrujam et al. 2015; Etminan et al. 2019; Pour-Aboughadareh et al. 2022). In the study presented here, molecular data obtained using ISSR and CBDP markers were used on determine the genetic variation and population structure of 48 samples of Iranian oak trees of Q. infectoria and Q. brantii ver. persica species collected from different natural habitats of Kermanshah province, Iran. The results indicated that both molecular marker techniques can be successfully used to assess genetic diversity within and between oak populations. In addition, the use of these marker techniques for determine genetic diversity and structure analyses was compared.\n\nCBDP markers showed higher polymorphism and PIC values than ISSR. Hence, this type of markers is a more efficient technique for assessing molecular variation in natural populations. Similarly, Hamidi et al. (2014), Heikrujam et al. (2015), and Bokaei et al. (2023) obtained higher reliability and efficiency of CBDP markers than other types of molecular markers in studying genetic diversity in various crop plants. AMOVA showed that genetic variation within species, as well as within regions per species, was higher than between species (Table 3), suggesting that introgression is a common phenomenon in oak (Valbuena-Carabana et al. 2005; Curtu et al. 2007; Salvini et al. 2009). Oak species are known as a “worst case scenario for the biological species concepts” due to apparent local interspecific gene flow. However, they exhibit genetic consistency over a wide geographic range (An et al. 2017). Shiran et al. (2011), Alikhani et al. (2014), Lupini et al. (2019), Xiong et al. (2020), and Kesic et al. (2021) showed high levels of genetic variation within different oak species. Kesic et al. (2021) assessed the genetic diversity and population differentiation of seven Serbia oak populations using SSR markers and obtained a high level of diversity among the germplasm studied.\n\nCBDP markers showed higher values for all indicators of genetic variation than the ISSR markers (Table 3). This indicated that CBDP in effective in obtaining greater polymorphism in genetic materials. At the species level, genetic variation is dependent on geographic range, migration, mating system, balancing selection and life cycle (Guo et al. 2021). Widespread distribution and heterogeneous habitats are considered two main ecological factors that lead to high genetic variation, as numerous individuals can increase a species’ ability to respond to different environmental conditions. Moreover, a mating system with high rates of introgression and gene flow can enhance genetic diversity (Guo et al. 2021). The results showed that the species Q. brantii var. persica had higher genetic variation than Q. infrctoria as assessed using both ISRR and CBDP, as well as combined ISRR + CBDP data (Table 3). One of the main reasons for this result can be attributed to the different sampling regions and number of samples. Similarly, Shiran et al. (2011) obtained a high rate of variation within Iranian Q. brantii using morphological and AFLP markers. In addition, a high level of genetic variation has been reported in the Iranian Q. barnatii germplasm using various molecular markers (Shiran et al. 2011; Alikhani et al. 2014; Ebrahimi et al. 2017). Yang et al. (2018) found that different types of climatic factors and soil conditions can affect genetic diversity. Moreover, this result was confirmed by comparison genetic diversity indices sampling regions. Similarly, Nocchi et al. (2022) sequenced the entire genome of a core collection of British oaks, including 386 individuals from the Q. petraea and Q. robur species, and found that the genetic diversity that exists in the populations studied may provide some resistance to climate change factors. They concluded that drier and warmer climate in the future may favor the ecology of Q. petraea over Q. robur. Hence, the percentage of Q. petraea and hybrids may increase in the future.\n\nAt the regional level, Dalahoo populations in both species showed the highest genetic diversity using the ISSR markers. Moreover, this population along with Gilan-e-Gharb had the highest genetic diversity using CBDP markers. For the combined data, all samples of Q. infectoria from Dalahoo showed the highest number indicators of genetic variation. However, samples from Paveh and from Gilan-e-Gharb showed the highest level of genetic diversity for the species Q. brantii var. persica (Table 3). The grouping of the Iranian oak samples obtained from all genotypic data were similar in most cases. However, the pattern obtained for CBDP markers was more pronounced than the ISSR markers (Fig. 2). For both types of markers combined, clustering was consistent with geographical classifications. This was confirmed by results obtained using PCoA and population structure analyses (Figs. 3 and 4). In conclusion, it is proposed that the integration of gene-targeted markers with other types of molecular markers creates the best grouping of individuals based on their genetic background and geographical origin, as shown in earlier research (Pour-Aboughadareh et al. 2017; Etminan et al. 2019). SCoT and CBDP markers are widely used to study genetic diversity and population structure in various populations. Pandey et al. (2023) studied fourteen cannabis populations collected from different districts of Kumaun and Garhwal Himalaya in Uttarakhand, India. Khodaee et al. (2021) determined the relationship among 48 Aegilops triuncialis accessions using three DNA marker systems, including start codon targeted (SCoT), CAAT box-derived polymorphism (CBDP), and inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. Apana et al. (2021) analyzed genetic diversity and population structure of ninety-seven individuals of medicinally important endangered Clerodendrum serratum (L.) Moon using CBDP, iPBS and SCoT markers.\n\nThe establishment of in situ dynamic conservation units is known as one of the most important strategies for conservation the genetic diversity of forest trees. The main goal of dynamic genetic conservation is to promote continuous evolutionary processes in populations and exploit current genetic variability (Koskela et al. 2013). With declining genetic variability as the main challenge for long–term conservation of Iranian oak genetic resources, several strategies can be recommended, such as identifying and conservation the most vulnerable regions, conservation genetic diversity in marginal populations, and conservation of adaptive diversity."
