        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe current study investigated the prevalence and related factors of hypertension and its awareness, treatment and control rates among the northern Iranian population. In this study, we demonstrate that hypertension was prevalent (43.2%) in this population. Although the prevalence of hypertension in the current study population was similar to other studies in north of Iran [31], but it was more prevalent than most of the other regions of Iran and other countries [32,33]. The recent studies reported that the prevalence of hypertension overall in Iran was about 25% [34,35], and its prevalence in southern province was 27% [36]. This difference may be related to differences in demographic and lifestyle factors [37].\n\nAbout half of the hypertensive patients in the current study were aware of their disease and under treatment and about two-thirds of our treated patient were controlled. This is in line with some previous studies [32,33,36].\n\nWe found an independent correlation between age and hypertension presence, awareness, treatment, and control. Our finding revealed that the 51–70 years old participants were more likely to be hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 2.1), more likely to be aware of their diagnosis of hypertension (adjusted adds ratio = 1.8), more likely to be treated (adjusted adds ratio = 1.2), but less likely to be controlled (adjusted adds ratio = 0.6) than 35–50 years old participants. Hypertension increases with the age increasing was a well-known fact and these findings are compatible with all previously published studies [3,31,32,36].\n\nOur results demonstrated that those from urban areas were more likely to be hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 1.4) but less likely to be aware (adjusted adds ratio = 0.7) and treated (adjusted adds ratio = 0.6) than those living in rural areas. However, there was no association between residence and hypertension control in the present study. National study in Iran and WHO reports have also revealed that hypertension is more prevalent in urban areas [16,38]. In contrast with our findings, some studies report that rural residency were associated with a greater likelihood of unawareness and uncontrolled of hypertension [39,40]. It is important to note that based on the Health Department program in health networks of Iran, people living in rural areas are actively screened for non-communicable disease, while in cities they are screened passive and that’s may be the reason of more hypertension awareness and treatment in rural areas [41].\n\nOur results revealed that participants with more education than a diploma were less likely to be hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 0.8) and were more likely to be aware (adjusted adds ratio = 1.4) and controlled (adjusted adds ratio = 1.4) when compared with high school or less education level. This is consistent with results reported by other studies [32,36].\n\nWe found no independent association between sex and risk of hypertension, rate of treatment and control. However, our finding revealed that females were more likely to be aware of their diagnosis of hypertension (adjusted adds ratio = 1.3), than males. Studies reports regarding the correlation of sex with the risk of hypertension are quite controversial [36,42]. Higher levels of awareness in female may be due to their more frequent contact with health care professionals and more attention to their health status [43].\n\nOur results demonstrated that overweight and obese participant were more likely to be hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 1.2 and 1.4, respectively), more likely to be aware (adjusted adds ratio = 1.4 and 1.8, respectively) and less likely to be controlled (adjusted adds ratio = 0.6 and 0.4, respectively) than normal weights. Most studies report significant association of overweight, obese with higher risk of hypertension and poor control [44]. However, we found no independent association between abdominal obesity and risk of hypertension, rate of treatment and control. Patient with abdominal obesity had only been more likely to be aware (adjusted adds ratio = 1.5) of their diagnosis of hypertension in our study population. Higher levels of awareness in overweight and obese people may be due to the closer attention of the health system to these groups [31].\n\nOther finding of the current study was an independent correlation between physical activity and hypertension prevalence, awareness and control. Our results revealed that participants with higher physical activity were less likely to be hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 0.6), were more likely to be controlled (adjusted adds ratio = 1.6) but were less likely to be aware of the disease (adjusted adds ratio=0.6). Moderate regular physical activity can improve control of blood pressure in 75% of hypertensive patients [45]. The underlying mechanisms are probably reduction in plasma renin and norepinephrine, increased metabolic rate and fat metabolism and reduction in vascular resistance [46,47].\n\nWe found no independent association of alcohol use and smoking with risk of hypertension and rate of awareness, treatment and control. It was in contrast with the findings of some studies that showed an independent and significant effect of smoking on hypertension [48,49]. The finding of no association in the current study is maybe due to reverse causation, due to the fact that patient with hypertension are more likely to be advised by their health professions to smoking cessation [50].\n\nThe results of current study demonstrate that diabetic patient and patients suffering from CVD were more likely to be hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 2.1 and 3.1, respectively), more likely to be aware (adjusted adds ratio = 1.6 and 2, respectively) and treated (adjusted adds ratio = 1.6 and 1.8, respectively), but there was no association of diabetes and CVD with hypertension control. Evidence on the association of diabetes and CVD with hypertension is consistent [51,52]. Higher levels of hypertension awareness and treatment in diabetes and CVD patients can be justified with more frequent refer to health care professionals [36].\n\nWe found an independent association between psychiatric disorders and hypertension presence (adjusted adds ratio = 1.5) and awareness (adjusted adds ratio = 1.5). other studies showed that hypertensive patients were more likely to suffer from psychiatric disorders [53,54]. On the other hand, patients who experience stress, depression are at an increased risk of hypertension [55].\n\nOur results demonstrated that those having a family history of hypertension was more likely to be hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 1.8), more likely to be aware (adjusted adds ratio = 1.8) and controlled (adjusted adds ratio = 1.8), in line with previous studies [56,57]. This confirms the hereditary pattern of hypertension [58]. Moreover, higher levels of hypertension awareness and control in family history positive patients may be due to frequent contact with health care professionals and more attention to their health status [59].\n\nWe found no independent association of serum lipid profile with risk of hypertension and rate of awareness, treatment and control. However, our results revealed a strong correlation of serum creatinine and hypertensive (adjusted adds ratio = 5.1) in line with previous studies [60,61].\n\nThe strengths of this study are the large sample size, the population-based data and also the wide collection of information on potentially correlated factors. However, Cross-sectional design was the limitation of the current study, which did not permit us to determine the order of events. Also, we cannot completely exclude residual confounders, despite our detailed adjustment for confounding because our study was not randomized."
