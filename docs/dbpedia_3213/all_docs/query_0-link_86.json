EA does not object to fair uses of video footage or screenshots on video sharing sites, including YouTube channels that are commercialized, as long as the footage is a version of the game that we have released to the public.\n\nWe do reserve the right to address any inappropriate use of EA content. Additionally, because many EA games include content that is licensed from a third-party company or may otherwise have usage restrictions, and because of the large number of video-related questions we get from the community, we aren’t able to grant specific approvals or respond to all follow up inquiries. For additional permissions and terms of service information, read the EA Terms of Service.\n\n- https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/faq/how-to-request-permission-for-ea-games-content/\n\nTerms of Use (Crytek):\n\nhttps://www.crytek.com/video-policy\n\nGUIDE\n\nAlthough I have already provided personal extractions from the Crysis Trilogy's audio within Sound Collection: The Crysis Trilogy (with all voiced languages included except for Crysis 3), I thought it appropriate to include guides & tools for them as well as for Warface, Crytek's still maintained & updated free-to-play shooter.\n\nWhile the procedure for each game is generally the same just as similar CryEngine games such as Turtle Rock Studio's Evolve & Arkane Studio's Prey [2017], games preceding the generally easy Crysis become less convenient as Crytek introduced encryption for preceding versions of the CryEngine. So I'll be walking you through each game individually to ensure details are retained.\n\nTo make it easier to navigate this huge wall of text, I have ordered each game's step-by-step process in the following order:\n\nCRYSIS & CRYSIS WARHEAD\n\nCRYSIS 2\n\nCRYSIS 3\n\nWARFACE\n\nCRYSIS & CRYSIS: WARHEAD\n\nCrysis & it's expansion Crysis: Warhead are the easiest of the bunch to attain the audio from, due to their lack of encryption & subsequent lack of need for tools. Thus, this should be relatively painless.\n\nWhile my experience lies only within the Steam releases & their highly convenient localisation features allowing quick download of voiced languages, I hear the GOG releases also have their own options accomodating this, plus are reportedly the most up-to-date versions shipped notably including the 64bit binaries data (Where as Steam only has the 32bit data & may require outside updating). Plus, GOG's releases are completely DRM-Free (Whereas Steam's releases have DRM in addition to Steam's requirement), so whilst this is a case where GOG's releases are the most recommended (Unfortunately not a unanimous scenario as numerous games tend to get maintained treatment on Steam with their GOG releases neglected, or even vice versa), I must proceed only having worked with Steam copies. Fortunately, this should have no impact on the audio extraction procedure itself, but something to consider if you want more VO languages than your regional default.\n\nAs previously stated, my own extractions can be found here: Sound Collection: The Crysis Trilogy\n\nCRYSIS & CRYSIS: WARHEAD: STEP ONE\n\nProceed to the game files to locate the desired PAK files.\n\nFirstly, navigate to your game folders (These examples are based on installation via Steam & GOG):\n\nCrysis\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis > Game\n\n[Your GOG Library Location] Crysis > Game\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain all sound & music that you're looking for:\n\nMusic.pak\n\nSounds.pak\n\nFor voice, you'll find it in\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis > Game > Localized\n\n[Your GOG Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis > Game > Localized\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain everything that you're looking for:\n\nEnglish.pak\n\nEnglish1.pak\n\nWith the following containing voiced localisation:\n\nFrench.pak\n\nGerman.pak\n\nItalian.pak\n\nJapanese.pak (Not available for the Steam release)\n\nRussian.pak\n\nSpanish.pak\n\nTurkish.pak (Not available for the Steam release)\n\nCrysis: Warhead\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis Warhead > Game\n\n[Your GOG Library Location] > Crysis Warhead > Game\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain all sound & music that you're looking for:\n\nWarhead_Music.pak\n\nWarhead_Sounds.pak\n\nFor voice, you'll find it in\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis Warhead > Game > Localized\n\n[Your GOG Library Location] > Crysis Warhead > Game > Localized\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain everything that you're looking for:\n\nenglish.pak\n\nWith the following containing voiced localisation:\n\nfrench.pak\n\ngerman.pak\n\nhungarian.pak\n\nitalian.pak\n\njapanese.pak (Not available for the Steam release)\n\nrussian.pak\n\nspanish.pak\n\nturkish.pak (Not available for the Steam nor GOG releases)\n\nCrysis: Wars\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis Wars > Game\n\n[Your GOG Library Location] > Crysis Wars > Game\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain all sound & music that you're looking for:\n\nMusic.pak\n\nSounds.pak\n\nZPatch1.pak\n\nFor voice, you'll find it in\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis Wars > Game > Localized\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain everything that you're looking for:\n\nEnglish.pak\n\nEnglish1.pak\n\n(It appears I never located any voiced localisations for Crysis Wars, which is the companion multiplayer mode with Crysis: Warhead).\n\nSimply copy these to a convenient new location to proceed with the next step.\n\nCRYSIS & CRYSIS: WARHEAD: STEP TWO\n\nRight click you chosen PAK file and select \"Rename\", then change the file extension \".pak\" to \".zip\" to convert it into a ZIP archive.\n\nIf you are having trouble seeing \".pak\" at the end of these files, simply Google \"displaying the file extension for/in [Your Operating System]\" for instructions.\n\nCRYSIS & CRYSIS: WARHEAD: STEP THREE\n\nYou are free to explore, copy & paste, extract and/sort the files within the ZIPs to your hearts content. The Music files are in OGG format (Easily playable with such players as VLC Media Player or editors such as Audacity), the Voice files are in MP2 format, with the SFX being in FSB packages.\n\nIt's worth noting that the MP2 files will be mostly accompanied by FSQ files, which I'm lead to believe are the lip-sync data for characters. A quick way to delete them all is just use the term \".fsq\" in the Folder Search Bar, then mass delete the search results of anything in the FSQ file format.\n\nNow, regarding the FSB packages for the SFX, there are numerous tools to getting the WAV and/or MP3 files out from them. My most recommended one is Aezay's FSB Extractor[aezay.dk] as it's the most straightforward to use and works very well with the Crysis trilogy's FSBs, but I must note that most of the Crysis trilogy's WAV files are in \"IMA ADPCM\" Codec, which means they'll likely not be playable with players such as Windows Media Player, but work well with VLC Media Player, Audacity or other players/editors. There is also fsbext[aluigi.altervista.org], but it's a mostly command-based program.\n\nAlternatively, foobar2000[www.foobar2000.org] with the vgmstream[vgmstream.org] component can playback the FSB files as well as convert them to a playable format of choice. There may be other tools & options out there compatible with the FSB files within Crysis & Crysis: Warhead, but I'll have to leave that to your discretion.\n\nCRYSIS 2\n\nCrysis 2 is when the encryption began to crop up. Thankfully, the tool to bypass it remains widely available.\n\nIn my case, I used the Steam release of the game, but with no Crysis sequel yet to receive a GOG Release, Steam is your only alternative to every other release that requires EA Origin. Thankfully, all digital releases have been updated to the Maximum Edition, which includes all patches as well as the DirectX 11 upgrade, with the Solidshield DRM included in the original Steam release seemingly inert. Sadly, I have not come across any word on successful attempts to revive the Multiplayer that died with GameSpy's shutdown in 2014.\n\nAs previously stated, my own extractions can be found here: Sound Collection: The Crysis Trilogy\n\nCRYSIS 2: STEP ONE\n\nFirst, you'll need a tool. While using QuickBMS[aluigi.altervista.org] & the \"crysis2.bms\" script may remain the first & most available option, the method most if not all folks I came across use is the \"Crysis 2 PAK Utility\" by master131.\n\nOriginal download links cannot seem to be found anymore, so here's a personal MediaFire back-up link of the .RAR package containing \"Crysis 2 PAK Utility.exe\" (Edited due to Steam Filters):\n\nhttps://www[DOT]mediafire[DOT]com/file/1max276wiagpvhw/Crysis_2_PAK_Utility.rar\n\nCRYSIS 2: STEP TWO\n\nWhen loading the tool, you may be greeted with a Microsoft .NET Framework error alert reading just as I was:\n\nUnhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.\n\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object\n\nJust pressing Continue has the tool working as intended on my end, so I can only assume it will for you too. You can click Details if you want details on what's occurring, but I am not even going to try to pretend to understand any of it.\n\nIt should defaultly open on the \"Extract Files\" tab, but select it if it hasn't. From there, simply choose your Crysis 2 PAK file for your Input under \"Crysis 2 PAK File:\" & your chosen location for \"Output Folder:\".\n\nNavigate to your Crysis 2 game files to find the PAK files for Input (These examples are based on installation of Crysis 2: Maximum Edition via Steam):\n\nSound & Music:\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis 2 Game of the Year > gamecrysis2\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain all sound & music that you're looking for:\n\nMusic.pak\n\nSounds.pak\n\nVoice:\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Crysis 2 Game of the Year > gamecrysis2 > Localized\n\nIn my case, it appears as if I had all voiced localisation PAK files installed by default without needing to choose my language preference via Steam. Nevertheless, these are all of the PAK files you should be able to find:\n\nChineseT.pak\n\nCzech.pak\n\nEnglish.pak\n\nFrench.pak\n\nGerman.pak\n\nItalian.pak\n\nJapanese.pak\n\nPolish.pak\n\nRussian.pak\n\nSpanish.pak\n\nTurkish.pak\n\nThen simply hit \"Extract\" to perform the process. It may take a while depending on your chosen PAK (Particularly the Voice ones where file quantity is very high).\n\nCRYSIS 2: STEP THREE\n\nThe contents of the PAK file(s) you extracted from will be fully laid out & available to explore and/sort to your hearts content. The Music files are in OGG format (Easily playable with such players as VLC Media Player or editors such as Audacity), the Voice files are in MP2 format, with the SFX being in FSB packages.\n\nIt's worth noting that the MP2 files will be mostly accompanied by FSQ files, which I'm lead to believe are the lip-sync data for characters. A quick way to delete them all is just use the term \".fsq\" in the Folder Search Bar, then mass delete the search results of anything in the FSQ file format.\n\nNow, regarding the FSB packages for the SFX, there are numerous tools to getting the WAV and/or MP3 files out from them. My most recommended one is Aezay's FSB Extractor[aezay.dk] as it's the most straightforward to use and works very well with the Crysis trilogy's FSBs, but I must note that most of the Crysis trilogy's WAV files are in \"IMA ADPCM\" Codec, which means they'll likely not be playable with players such as Windows Media Player, but work well with VLC Media Player, Audacity or other players/editors. There is also fsbext[aluigi.altervista.org], but it's a mostly command-based program.\n\nAlternatively, foobar2000[www.foobar2000.org] with the vgmstream[vgmstream.org] component can playback the FSB files as well as convert them to a playable format of choice or be played back with FMOD Event Player (Archive.org one such place to find it: https://archive.org/details/FMODEventPlayerv4.44.63) via their accompanying FEV file. There may be other tools & options out there compatible with the FSB files within Crysis 2, but I'll have to leave that to your discretion.\n\nCRYSIS 3\n\nBy now, PAK encryption is pretty much standard for games built on CryEngine to my knowledge. Thankfully, a tool was created to bypass the encryption for Crysis 3's PAK files and remains safely available.\n\nIn regards to the game itself, Crysis 3 on PC is entirely tied to EA Origin regardless of digital provider. While the game is available physically, I cannot personally confirm if you can install the game without needing EA Origin (As I did during the 3-disc installation of Titanfall). One thing to note is that unlike the other releases, I haven't had much luck finding the ability to change my language preferences for the Origin release, so native English was all I was able to access at the time of writing. However, the Steam release allows you to freely choose all available language options regardless of your region and doesn't require Origin to be installed (It does require Origin to be played though).\n\nAnother thing to note is that EA Origin & Steam are perhaps the only digital outlets that provide the Digital Deluxe Edition (The Steam release sells Crysis 3 as the Digital Deluxe Edition), which whilst including the usual DLC nonsense (Except The Lost Island Multiplayer DLC) also is perhaps the only means to purchase a copy of the game's official soundtrack that despite the pleasant surprise of being in WAV Lossless [16bit/CD], is almost absent of tags/metadata & makes no effort to acknowledge the composer(s) nor music staff.\n\nTaking matters into my own hands, I provided the official soundtrack with every shred of verified artists details I could acquire (Which sadly doesn't appear to be beyond what the game's staff credits provide) and applied it as tags/metadata with a companion \"Full Credits\" text file (Unfortunately no cover as no official one was created), along with my own audio extraction of Crysis 3, here: Sound Collection: The Crysis Trilogy\n\nCRYSIS 3: STEP ONE\n\nFirst, you'll need a tool. Thankfully, a tool known as \"Crysis 3 .PAK Extractor\" or perhaps referred to as \"Extract Crysis 3 .PAK.jar\" (Which I presume it requires Java[java.com] to run) was created & remains available for download.\n\nIt remains available for download from GameBanana: https://gamebanana.com/tools/5416\n\nOr a MediaFire link from this post in the original XeNTaX Forum Topic: https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?p=90652#p90652\n\nhttps://www[DOT]mediafire[DOT]com/file/4sc5lkkh4a6jnph/crysis_3_pak_extractor_gui.zip\n\nCRYSIS 3: STEP TWO\n\nRun \"Extract Crysis 3 .PAK.jar\", then simply choose your Crysis 3 PAK file for your Input under \"Select .PAK File:\" & your chosen location for \"Output location:\".\n\nNavigate to your Crysis 3 game files to find the PAK files for Input (These examples are based on installation via EA Origin & Steam):\n\nSound & Music:\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > steamapps > common > Crysis 3 > C3\n\n[Your Origin Library Location] > Origin Games > Crysis 3 > C3\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain all sound & music that you're looking for:\n\nMusic.pak\n\nSounds.pak\n\nSound & Music (The Lost Island):\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > steamapps > common > Crysis 3 > dlc > dlc1\n\n[Your Origin Library Location] > Origin Games > Crysis 3 > dlc > dlc1\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain all sound & music that you're looking for:\n\ndlcdata.pak\n\nVoice:\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > steamapps > common > Crysis 3 > Localization\n\n[Your Origin Library Location] > Origin Games > Crysis 3 > Localization\n\nAs aforementioned, I couldn't find a way to change language settings for the Origin release, so I only ended up with my regional equivalent (English). But based on the options available for the Steam release, I would assume the following are also available for Origin depending on your region:\n\nEnglish.pak\n\nFrench.pak\n\nGerman.pak\n\nItalian.pak\n\nJapanese.pak\n\nPolish.pak\n\nRussian.pak\n\nSpanish.pak\n\nTurkish.pak\n\nVoice (The Lost Island):\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > steamapps > common > Crysis 3 > dlc > dlc1 > loc\n\n[Your Origin Library Location] > Origin Games > Crysis 3 > dlc > dlc1 > loc\n\nAs aforementioned, I couldn't find a way to change language settings for the Origin release, so I only ended up with my regional equivalent (English). But based on the options available for the Steam release, I would assume the following are also available for Origin depending on your region:\n\ndlc_english.pak\n\ndlc_french.pak\n\ndlc_german.pak\n\ndlc_italian.pak\n\ndlc_polish.pak\n\ndlc_russian.pak\n\ndlc_spanish.pak\n\ndlc_turkish.pak\n\nThen simply hit extract to begin the process of creating ZIP copies of the PAK files.\n\nSomething to note about the process is that while extracting from \"Music.pak\" or \"Sound.pak\", the tool had quite the amount of trouble extracting from \"English.pak\", with text not updating in the tool's GUI. I can't recall the solution or workaround I used for my own extraction, but the best advice I can offer is to keep an eye on the constructing \"[Language].zip\" file size. If it manages to build to equal size of the original PAK, maybe the tool will be able to finish the process by itself (Although it may take a very long time). If it fails or you want to cancel, but you can't close Crysis 3 .PAK Extractor down, go to your Task Manager & under Processes find \"dec.exe\" and End Process, to which then you should be able to close Crysis 3 .PAK Extractor down. Don't do anything you don't feel safe doing, but this should save you needing to restart your computer.\n\nCRYSIS 3: STEP THREE\n\nYou are free to explore, copy & paste, extract and/sort the files within the ZIPs to your hearts content. The Music files are in OGG format (Easily playable with such players as VLC Media Player or editors such as Audacity), the Voice files are in MP2 format, with the SFX being in FSB packages.\n\nIt's worth noting that the MP2 files should be mostly accompanied by FSQ files like it's predecessors, which I'm lead to believe are the lip-sync data for characters. A quick way to delete them all is just use the term \".fsq\" in the Folder Search Bar, then mass delete the search results of anything in the FSQ file format.\n\nNow, regarding the FSB packages for the SFX, there are numerous tools to getting the WAV and/or MP3 files out from them. My most recommended one is Aezay's FSB Extractor[aezay.dk] as it's the most straightforward to use and works very well with the Crysis trilogy's FSBs, but I must note that most of the Crysis trilogy's WAV files are in \"IMA ADPCM\" Codec, which means they'll likely not be playable with players such as Windows Media Player, but work well with VLC Media Player, Audacity or other players/editors. There is also fsbext[aluigi.altervista.org], but it's a mostly command-based program.\n\nAlternatively, a tool called \"fsb_aud_extr.exe\" tool can conveniently convert the FSB Files to WAV, but will often do so with Mono/1-Channel files being extracted as Stereo/2-Channel files & make such files bigger than genuinely needed. While the tool can be found here[zenhax.com], I have a MediaFire back-up with the necessary .DLL files and a 'Convert All' .BAT file to make conversion for multiple files much more convenient (More details on it's use can be found within STEP TWO of How to Acquire: The Audio of PlanetSide 2 [OUTDATED]):\n\nhttps://www[DOT]mediafire[DOT]com/file/375i5kkdgbk5xpo/fsb_aud_extr.zip\n\nAdditionally, foobar2000[www.foobar2000.org] with the vgmstream[vgmstream.org] component can playback the FSB files as well as convert them to a playable format of choice or be played back with FMOD Event Player (Archive.org one such place to find it: https://archive.org/details/FMODEventPlayerv4.44.63) via their accompanying FEV file.\n\nWhile it is worth mentioning that 'LoLFSBExtract' is also another option (LoLFSBExtract's included Readme.txt and this XeNTaX post[forum.xentax.com] will let you know how to use it), it is a command-based tool that less conveniently extracts the FSB files to WAV exactly as fsb_aud_extr.exe does when it does so successfully and may require specific adjustments on occasions when it may not, so I would still recommend fsb_aud_extr.exe instead (LoLFSBExtract can nevertheless be found here: https://wiki.spectralcoding.com/info:league_of_legends_sounds:lolfsbextract).\n\nThere may be yet more tools & options out there, but I'll have to leave that to your discretion.\n\nWARFACE\n\nYou'll need to keep in mind that despite being available on Steam, it still utilises the MY.GAMES Launcher akin to games such as PlanetSide 2 that use their own launchers nor does it update via Steam, so to update the game to it's latest version, you'll need to create a MY.GAMES account. Although it appears MY.GAMES will automatically create an account using your Steam account, I'm not well researched enough to confirm it. It is something to keep in mind if you do not currently own Warface.\n\nAlternatively, I have separate full-audio extractions from the Icebreaker & Chernobyl content updates available here: Sound Collection: Warface\n\nWARFACE: STEP ONE\n\nFirst, you'll need to acquire the necessary PakDecrypt.exe tool to decrypt the .PAK files containing the audio. Since different regions have different encryptions, you'll need to use them for which one your area is provided (\"PakDecrypt_ru.exe\" for Russian, \"PakDecrypt_en\" for English, \"PakDecrypt_br.exe\" for what I presume is Brazilian Portuguese, etc.)\n\nWhilst I originally was able to acquire them from this Facepunch Forum Post[forum.facepunch.com], the link is no longer active, so I'll provide my personal alternative via MediaFire (Edited due to Steam Filters):\n\nhttps://www[DOT]mediafire[DOT]com/file/vv2rtl5f3ttokyp/PakDecrypt.exe_(Warface,_Multiple_Regional_Versions).zip\n\nWARFACE: STEP TWO\n\nNext, you'll need to locate the Audio, Music & Voice PAK files to extract them.\n\nFirstly, navigate to your game folder (These examples are based on installation via Steam):\n\nSound & Music:\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Warface > Warface > Game\n\nWithin this folder, the following PAK files should contain everything that you're looking for:\n\nMusic.pak\n\nSounds_Ar.pak\n\nSounds_Characters.pak\n\nSounds_Environment.pak\n\nSounds_Environment_str.pak\n\nSounds_Other.pak\n\nSounds_Physics.pak\n\nSounds_Shg.pak\n\nSounds_Smg.pak\n\nSounds_Sr.pak\n\nSounds_Vo.pak\n\nVoice:\n\n[Your Steam Library Location] > Steamapps > common > Warface > Warface> Game > Localized\n\nAssuming my experience as a UK resident is shared across all regions Warface is available in, you should find the following:\n\nChinese.pak\n\nEnglish.pak\n\nFrench.pak\n\nGerman.pak\n\nPolish.pak\n\nSpanish.pak\n\nMy personal recommendation is to copy these to a convenient new location to proceed with the next step.\n\nWARFACE: STEP THREE\n\nCopy & paste the appropriate \"PakDecrypt.exe\" to your regional Warface installation (In my case, \"PakDecrypt_en.exe\") into the same location as your PAK files you're keen to extract from.\n\nSimply drag each PAK file one at a time onto the \"PakDecrypt.exe\" to provide a converted copy of the PAK as a ZIP archive.\n\nIf you're not entirely sure which region of Warface your local area uses, simply try each \"PakDecrypt.exe\" until you get successful results (I cannot personally guarantee all six PakDecrypt.exe regional variants cover all regions, but I'm lead to believe so).\n\nWARFACE: STEP FOUR\n\nYou are free to explore, copy & paste, extract and/sort the files within the ZIPs to your hearts content. The Music files are in OGG format (Easily playable with such players as VLC Media Player or editors such as Audacity), the Voice files are in MP2 format (Some of which have the left channel with the raw voice & the right channel with outdoor echo, but simple audio editing techniques can separate or combine them to your desire), with the SFX being in FSB packages.\n\nUnlike the Crysis Trilogy, I haven't had much luck in extracting the SFX files from the FSB packages using Aezay's FSB Extractor[aezay.dk] (Which according to the tool the SFX files are OGG format & are stored in FSB5 version 0.1), which whilst do extract the OGG files, they do not seem playable in Audacity (Even through Import > Raw Data), VLC Media Player nor foobar2000. I recall being equally unsuccessful with fsbext[aluigi.altervista.org] as well.\n\nInstead, a tool called \"fsb_aud_extr.exe\" tool can conveniently & successfully convert the FSB Files to WAV, but will often do so with Mono/1-Channel files being extracted as Stereo/2-Channel files & make such files bigger than genuinely needed. Nevertheless, this is the most convenient & successful tool I've tried with Warface's FSB files, so I would still recommend it most. While the tool can be found here[zenhax.com], I have a MediaFire back-up with the necessary .DLL files and a 'Convert All' .BAT file to make conversion for multiple files much more convenient (More details on it's use can be found within STEP TWO of How to Acquire: The Audio of PlanetSide 2 [OUTDATED]):\n\nhttps://www[DOT]mediafire[DOT]com/file/375i5kkdgbk5xpo/fsb_aud_extr.zip\n\nAdditionally, foobar2000[www.foobar2000.org] with the vgmstream[vgmstream.org] component can playback the FSB files as well as convert them to a playable format of choice or be played back with FMOD Event Player (Archive.org one such place to find it: https://archive.org/details/FMODEventPlayerv4.44.63) via their accompanying FEV file.\n\nWhile it is worth mentioning that 'LoLFSBExtract' is also another option (LoLFSBExtract's included Readme.txt and this XeNTaX post[forum.xentax.com] will let you know how to use it), it is a command-based tool that much less conveniently extracts the FSB files to WAV exactly as fsb_aud_extr.exe does when it does so successfully, so I would still recommend fsb_aud_extr.exe instead (LoLFSBExtract can nevertheless be found here: https://wiki.spectralcoding.com/info:league_of_legends_sounds:lolfsbextract).\n\nThere may be yet more tools & options out there, but I'll have to leave that to your discretion.\n\nCONCLUSIVE NOTES/TIPS\n\nHopefully after building this colossal wall of text, that should cover as many bases as I can. May you be able to narrow down & make use of all of the information you're after."
