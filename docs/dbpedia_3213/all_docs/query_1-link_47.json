        "text": "Crytek GmbH is a German video game development company founded by three German-Turkish brothers, Cevat, Avni and Faruk Yerli, in 1999. The company was originally located in Coburg, Germany, but relocated to Frankfurt, Germany in 2006.\n\nIn 2004, the company released its first title, Far Cry, which was published by Ubisoft. It was followed by adaptations for consoles, such as Far Cry: Instincts (2005) and Far Cry: Instincts - Predator (2006). The brand name Far Cry remained the property of Ubisoft and later games in the series were no longer developed by Crytek.\n\nIn July 2004, the company announced a partnership with Electronic Arts to create the Crysis franchise. The first-person shooter Crysis was released in November 2007. After the stand-alone expansion Crysis: Warhead (2008) the company released the sequel Crysis 2 in 2011 and Crysis 3 in 2013. The three mainline games were remastered in 2020 and 2021, without EA's involvement.\n\nNext to games, the company also created and maintains the proprietary and licensable CryEngine 3D engine. Five major engine generations have been released as of 2016:\n\n3D Engine: CryEngine 1\n\n3D Engine: CryEngine 2\n\n3D Engine: CryEngine 3\n\n3D Engine: CryEngine 4\n\n3D Engine: CryEngine 5\n\nKnown subsidiaries\n\nNames in italics used to be subsidiaries, but no longer are as they were closed or sold off."
