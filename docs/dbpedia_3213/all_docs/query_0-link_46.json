        "text": "Frankfurt, DE, June 12th, 2019 - Leaseweb, the global cloud hosting provider, has confirmed the deployment of an extra 400 high-performance dedicated servers in Europe and the US, to enhance independent video game developer Crytek’s infrastructure in preparation for its launch of Hunt: Showdown on Xbox One this spring.\n\nWorking to deliver the scalability that Crytek needed, Leaseweb quickly installed the additional servers in the locations with the highest concentration of Crytek gamers to guarantee a faultless online gameplay experience.\n\n“To launch a game like Hunt: Showdown, server infrastructure, characterized by the ability to scale worldwide with one point of contact, is vitally important. The physical proximity of servers, as well as network latency and speed, determine the quality of the online gaming experience,” explained Faruk Yerli, CEO, Crytek. “An important measure of quality online gameplay is lag, which is why, ahead of this launch, we worked with Leaseweb to help us guarantee as little lag as possible.”\n\nLeaseweb has been providing customized dedicated servers, in various global locations, to Crytek since 2015. Leaseweb also provides global connectivity to Crytek through their network, which includes multiple Tier 1 IP networks.\n\n'Gaming companies like Crytek, which regularly release big updates and new games, demand flexibility and customizations and we are expertly equipped to accommodate that,” said Marcus Busch, Managing Director, Leaseweb Germany. “We support the company strategically by planning together and having resources ready to facilitate updates and launches such as Hunt: Showdown.'\n\nYerli added: “For any game launch, or update, it’s vitally important to have a flexible infrastructure that can scale up quickly - which can involve deploying hundreds of dedicated servers with certain specifications within days. Leaseweb provides that flexibility to Crytek by being proactive and proposing infrastructure improvements based on our requirements. With Leaseweb, Crytek has achieved 100% availability and a very low average lag time.”"
