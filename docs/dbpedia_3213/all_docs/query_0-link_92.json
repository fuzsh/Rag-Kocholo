        "text": "Free to play online first person shooter Warface is one step closer to global domination, as developer Crytek has revealed that it will be launching the game across the UK and Europe on October 21st. A new trailer for the game has since been revealed, which you can check out above. Those who wish to sign up for Warface can head to Crytekâ€™s official page for the same.\n\nFirst launch in Russia, Warface has been developed using CryEngine 3 and found an immensely strong following across the continent when it first launched. Demands were made to bring the game to Western audiences, with rumours also suggesting that it would be heading to consoles. It has since been confirmed to be arriving on the Xbox 360 in 2014 with CryEngine 4 powering the game.\n\nTrion Worlds will be publishing Warface in Europe, with a release date for the United States to be revealed shortly. Stay tuned for more details."
