With Homefront 2’s 2014 release date, it is possible the Nottingham group has enough resources for both games.\n\nTimeSplitters 4 has not been officially confirmed.\n\nEarlier, THQ announced it has handed its military shooter property to Crytek, just months after it axed the game’s former developer.\n\nTHQ closed New York studio Kaos as part of a global cost-cutting operation. More than 100 jobs were affected. The studio was infamously alleged to have undergone a brutal crunch period to finish up the project.\n\nThe first Homefront made an impact at retail, topping the UK charts in its first week, despite disappointing review scores.\n\nIronically, it was Crytek’s own shooter, Crysis 2, that dislodged Homefront from its top chart position.\n\nCrytek is currently developing a military shooter of its own, called Warface.\n\nIt was originally announced that future development on the Homefront series would be handled at its new Montreal studio."
