        "text": "The BSc (Hons) Games Development course allows you to specialise in one of two key disciplines within the games industry: games software development or games design. The course will provide you with the knowledge, skills and experiences needed to excel as a graduate in the computer games field.\n\nYou will select one of two distinct paths within the course, ultimately graduating with either a BSc (Hons) Games Development (Design) or a BSc (Hons) Games Development (Software).\n\nIn Year 1 of the course, you'll study the foundations of creating games. In addition, you'll develop the skills required to prototype games using technologies such as Unity and Unreal games engines. After year one you will select your specialisation choosing between one of two streams.\n\nGames Design Stream: In Years 2-4 you'll specialise in Games Design through a series of individual and collaborative modules. Individual modules will develop your expertise in areas such as Games Narrative, Game System Design, Game User Research, User Psychology, Serious Game Design, Engine Based Development, and facilitate the development of portfolio pieces. Collaborative modules will see you work together with students from other specialised courses within the Department of Applied Computer Games such as 3D Animation and Visualisation with pathways for Games and VFX and 3D Design for Visual Environments in order to produce games to either internal or industry-specified briefs.\n\nGames Software Development Stream: In Years 2-4 you'll specialise in Games Software Development through a series of individual, and collaborative modules. Individual modules will develop your expertise in areas such; Artificial Intelligence, Mobile Game Development, C++ and OpenGL, Network Game Development, Engine Based Development, and facilitate the development of portfolio pieces. Collaborative modules will see you work together with students from other specialised courses within the Department of Applied Computer Games such as 3D Animation and Visualisation with pathways for Games and VFX and 3D Design for Visual Environments in order to produce games to either internal or industry-specified briefs.\n\nThe course offers the possibility of undertaking an industry placement in a games company or studying abroad through Erasmus exchanges.\n\nGraduate prospects\n\nGraduates have gone on to work in companies such as Crytek, Electronic Arts, No Code, King, Media Molecule, Outplay Entertainment, Rockstar North and Sony."
