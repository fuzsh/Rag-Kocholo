        "text": "The formation of a new studio under the Creative Assembly banner follows the brand’s continued expansion over the past year. Bulgaria-based Crytek Black Sea will be renamed and its 60-strong team brought into the SEGA family.\n\n“\"Now in our 30th year of games development, with an army of multi-million selling titles to our name and a history of world-renowned partnerships, Creative Assembly is proof of the UK games industry's potential for global success,” said Tim Heaton, Studio Director at Creative Assembly.\n\nCreative Assembly made it’s name with the Total War series, and with high-profile games like Total War: Warhammer and Alien: Isolation, it’s further cementing its position as a leader in the games development industry.\n\n“We’ve been working with Creative Assembly for around a year now and it’s great to see them expanding yet again,” commented Neil Parmar, Accounts Director at Escape Technology. “We wish the new studio every success and will keep an eager eye on E3 for some more announcements.”"
