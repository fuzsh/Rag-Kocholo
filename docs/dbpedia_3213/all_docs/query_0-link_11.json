Crytek entered the UK market to access the exceptional talent that exists in the UK development community.\"\n\nBy giving students access to its CryENGINE in the classroom, they will be able to \"cut their teeth\" using the latest technology, Hilton added.\n\n\"As part of our support for TIGA we will be offering a discount for existing TIGA members who wish to license CryENGINE technology.\"\n\n\"Crytek UK is a significant and very welcome addition to the UK development community and to TIGA,\" said TIGA CEO Richard Wilson.\n\n\"We hope more international companies will follow Crytek's example by investing in the UK and recognising the highly skilled and talented workforce we have here.\n\n\"TIGA also commends Crytek's commitment to work with our university members to give them access to the latest industry technology and address the skill shortage that exists in our industry.\""
