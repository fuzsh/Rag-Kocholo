        "text": "ABSTRACT: This article aims at relating a research project about locality of videogame content to the larger body of knowledge in game studies. Based on the belief that video games function as a cultural voice that is not generation-specific, in the same way films are, the research project Local Videogames seeks to create and apply a special model of building game narratives out of local experiences; stories from the collective popular memory of one region as opposed to the familiar and metropolitan narratives. The goal of our article is to place the project and its game production in the perspective of game studies. We attempt to construct this relation in the light of Melcers (2015) study and based on key concepts in game studies: gamification, textuality, flow, meaning-making, and affordance. RESUMO: Este artigo tem como objetivo fazer um relato de projeto de pesquisa sobre localização de conteúdo de video game, como parte da área de estudos de jogos eletrônicos. Com base na crença de que os jogos de video game funcionam como uma voz cultural, que não é específica de uma geração da mesma forma que os filmes são, o projeto de pesquisa Local Videogames procurou criar e aplicar um modelo especial de construção de narrativas de jogo a partir de experiências locais; histórias originárias da memória popular coletiva de uma região em oposição às narrativas familiares e metropolitanas. O objetivo de nosso artigo é situar o projeto e sua produção de jogo na perspectiva dos estudos de jogos. Nós tentar construir essa relação à luz dos estudos de Melcer (2015) e com base em conceitos chave em estudos de jogo: gamificação, textualidade, fluxo, construção de significado e permissão.\n\nVideogames have, since the beginning of game studies as a discipline, been placed at a problematic cusp between games and narratives. Stories are important in videogames, especially in those such as Grand Theft Auto IV (2008), Fallout 3 (2008), and other games with a pronounced narrative intention. However, the element of play and multiplicity of the narrative makes it difficult to analyze them with traditional critical tools: it is easy, therefore, to dismiss them from the narrative canon. Another problem that videogame research faces is that game-narratives are ephemeral and the textual artefact of the game is substantially contained in the player’s experience. However, an entire range of paratexts, such as walkthroughs and after-action reports, where players construct narratives while recording their in-game experiences, are available for analysis. This paper points towards the urgency of beginning to study ludic paratexts like walkthroughs and after-action reports to understand ...\n\nI argue that the theoretical debate between ludology and narratology concerning narrative in game spaces is too restrictive. Of course traditional narrative models don't fully apply, as ludology argues, but no reason exists to argue that narrative can only be formulated as it already has. Ludology has argued far too restrictive a sense of time and temporal perspective in games.\n\nThis article develops Kawika Guillermo&#39;s ‘machphrasis’ (2016) as a theoretical contribution to discourse considering the deployment of video games in contemporary literary culture. After presenting machphrasis’ academic stakes, I propose that machphrasis can give explanations for some techniques and images endemic to late 20th/21st century writing with regards to video games represented in prose. By appending Guillermo&#39;s conceptual work with three additions, I work towards a reproducible poetics of the video game in prose writing. I will show that machphrasis may be used to understand video games in literature as proxies for anticipated technologies, as discursive tools for reckoning with new subjectivities indebted to play, and as the means for generating new ideological positions for those who play games but are excluded from the normative ‘gamer’ group. This contribution prepares current academic discourse for a future literary landscape increasingly beholden to machphras...\n\nThis paper set out to investigate the critical environment of videogames not merely as technology but also as&lt;br&gt; art. Departing from the premise that functionalist readings of videogames say little about the evolution of the&lt;br&gt; technology in its critical environment, it applied a de Certeaurian critical paradigm and came up with certain&lt;br&gt; findings. As a digital technology, the videogame has been subject to new definitional considerations; it is a new&lt;br&gt; agency of production, consumption and distribution of digital goods and services, sharing, communication,&lt;br&gt; interaction, and socialization.&lt;br&gt; Beyond technology, the videogame has become a new experience of artistic consumption that prioritizes not&lt;br&gt; only individual participation, but also posting of video comments, blog responses, video postings as well as&lt;br&gt; conversations and texts. The videogame is an artistic way of finding new identities and freedoms that&lt;br&gt; stren...\n\nDeveloped from my MA project at the University of Saskatchewan and published in Jeu vidéo et livre / Videogame and BooK (eds. Björn-Olav Dozo and Fanny Barnabé), this paper examines the narratological function of textual objects in videogames. Included in this study are the booklets that accompanied older games, peripherals such as the art book accompanying Skyrim's Special Edition, and diegetic texts such as the Codex in Mass Effect. The paper demonstrates the important role textual objects play in bridging mechanics with narrative.\n\nThis paper (the script of my DiGRA keynote 2015 with slides) ventures some intitial steps into an unnatural narratology of videogames. It explores two core definitions of unnaturalness and argues that broad definitions of unnaturalness end in tautological paradoxes that may not yield any conclusive analytical insights. The paper showcases how a more narrow, antimimetic definition of unnaturalness may be used to study unnatural space, time and narration in literary games.\n\nSeriality in popular culture has its own specific pedigree that has evolved over time. Currently, this is characterized by a cross-media bridge formed in the popular culture of the twentieth century. Contemporary narratives now serve as an intertextual, transmedia, anchor while formerly autonomous media become attached under the umbrella of a single narrative. This phenomenon is one of the prime characteristics of one of the youngest media, video games. The usually diadic model of internal (intrinsic/inherent) seriality and external seriality stemming from substance (a string of stand-alone games genetically related by a narrative as prequels, sequels, midquels, spin-off, mash-up etc.) and form (several versions of the same game as enhanced version, collectors version, modded version, reboot, port etc.) has been transformed into a triad after transmedia storytelling became established due to a technological, economic, and social paradigm shift and the development of convergence culture. This chapter investigates both paradigm shifts of convergence and synergy and their effect on the expansion of storytelling forms that have been adapted not only by popular culture but also by the art world, marking the transformation process from seriality to a single hybrid supertext (narrative/storytelling) form."
