        "text": "Chertsey, UK - August 2, 2007 - Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ: ERTS) and Crytek, award-winning developers of Far Cry, today announced that CrysisTM, will be hitting retail stores in North America and Europe on November 16, 2007 exclusively for the PC. A technical achievement featuring stunning DirectX 10 and DirectX 9 visuals, cunning gameplay, and an epic story, Crysis is recognised as one of the most anticipated PC games and first person shooters of 2007, recently winning Best PC game from the Game Critics Awards: Best of E3 2007.\n\n\"Crytek is constantly striving to push the boundaries of both game design and technology, while maintaining quality at the highest bar,\" said Cevat Yerli, CEO and President of Crytek. \"We're thankful to our fans for their support and patience, and we're excited to bring them Crysis this year. It's going to be worth the wait.\"\n\nOffering true, open-ended gameplay, Crysis gives gamers an unparalleled amount of freedom that fosters completely unique gaming experiences. Players are outfitted with a revolutionary Nanosuit and an arsenal of fully customizable weapons, giving them a wide array of options not only in approaching the entire game, but every single objective or individual encounter. And they will need every advantage they can get going head to head against a menacing and highly intelligent alien threat amid dynamic, hostile battlefields that range from lush, tropical jungles, flash-frozen landscapes and a horrifying zero gravity environment.\n\nCrysis also breaks new ground in multiplayer with the introduction of PowerStruggle - a unique team-based strategic mode for up to 32 players, where opposing sides battle for control of advanced weaponry and vehicles to overcome their enemies. For those who prefer the pulse-pounding action of deathmatch, Crysis will also feature an Instant Action mode, with the highly adaptive Nanosuit serving as the ultimate tool to outwit your opponents.\n\nCrysis has not yet been rated by the ESRB or PEGI.
