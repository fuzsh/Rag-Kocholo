Taking place in an alternate dystopian not-so-distant future where North Korea invaded the United States forcing U.S forces back to a small guerrilla warfare group against Helghast-like enemies on American soil. While it received a bit of a mixed reception that was not totally unfounded thanks to technical issues at launch, the game has been praised for its ambitious scope and detailed setting.\n\nDead Island 2: Originally revealed in 2014, Dead Island two underwent years of rocky progress and programmer changes. Dambuster Studios was assigned to develop the game in 2019, with plans to revive and finally release this long awaited sequel of popular Dead Island series.\n\nGameplay Philosophy\n\nThe aim is a higher degree of freedom during play along the immersive feel.\n\nDesignThe Dambuster Studios game design is best described as:\n\nClick to enlargeOpen-World Exploration – Highlighting expansive, interactive environments as a vehicle for exploration and player-guided progression.\n\nEngaging Combat Mechanics: allowing for a role play experience that suits with any kind of style while building the stats and being compatible across other rivals.\n\nNarrative: Creating a narrative experience resulting in immersion and emotional impact.\n\nTechnical Aspiration High Quality Graphics Detailed Environments Visually Stunning Game\n\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\nDevelopment Roadblocks\n\nDambuster Studios wishes to do better, but has come up against some understandable issues:\n\nProblems experienced with the launch of “Homefront: The Revolution” was that it suffered quite a bit from performance, bugs and other technical issues which made its release not very well received.\n\nExpect to see more Project Transfers (us gamers are loving that phrase) like “Dead Island 2” take place where the studio is actually having to rework someone else’s game at great expense in time and resources.\n\nIndustry Impact\n\nNotable Game Creations\n\nDambuster Studios has, over the years given us:\n\nResurrecting a Franchise: Taking on Homefront: The Revolution and Dead Island 2 shows Deep Silver can manage more challenging, high-profile games.\n\nCreative gameplay: Playing with the idea of dynamic/interactive mechanics especially in large, open-world experiences\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nOngoing Innovation and Evolution\n\nIn the future, Dambuster Studios aims to build on its presence in the games industry by;\n\nDelivery of Dead Island 2: Bringing “Dead Island 2” to market was a next goal after the fist game, won over fans and stakeholders.\n\nNew Projects: Working on new developments and might try out some different genres or IPs to add diversity of titles.\n\nTechnical Enhancements – Fixing issues that have caused game performance struggles in previous games to make our future releases more polished and stable for everyone.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith Crytek UK and Free Radical Design in its lineage, Dambuster Studios has an impressive legacy as a tenacious developer with grand ambitions. The studio is famed for its past work in helping to develop Homefront: The Revolution and the eagerly-awaited Dead Island 2, now heads down determinedly creating ambitious and unforgettable new IP games. If Dambuster Studios can keep up the level of quality we saw in Dead Island 2 without sacrificing any more time to layoffs, then it could have a bright future ahead in today’s ever-changing gaming industry."
