        "text": "Frankfurt am Main (Germany) - Crytek GmbH (\"Crytek\") is proud to announce the presentation of CryENGINE 3 in stereoscopic 3D (S-3D) at this year's GDC expo in San Francisco (11–13 March). For the very first time, developers can experience the highly topical S-3D trend built with Crytek's latest development solution.\n\nOne of the key features of the third-generation CryENGINE is the \"LiveCreate\" feature, which will also be showcased at GDC. CryENGINE 3 LiveCreate allows designers to work with a single editor, but see and play the results in real-time on the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. With CryENGINE 3, scalability across multiple platforms is a revolutionary development to enable the creation of truly great-looking games – regardless of the target platform.\n\n\"After the successful introduction of CryENGINE 3 at last year's GDC, we are really excited to show the latest version of our all-in-one game development solution this year in stereoscopic 3D. Over the past few years, S-3D technology has emerged as one of the key trends both in movies and games. With CryENGINE 3, developers will have the ability to create their content in 3D on all platforms. There are basically no longer any limits to a designer's creativity. CryENGINE 3 features many innovations to accelerate development, cut production costs and ensure teams are able to maximize their own creativity without delays,\" says Carl Jones, Director of Global Business Development CryENGINE.\n\nCryENGINE 3 is the fastest and most robust high-end renderer in the world, with new features specifically designed for console platforms. Benchmark-setting graphical performance, near-photorealism rendering of indoor and wide-open outdoor environments as well as extraordinary real-time special effects are just some of the hallmarks of CryENGINE technology. It was the underlying technology for Crytek's critically acclaimed games Crysis and Crysis Warhead, and is used today not only throughout the video game industry and but also for many serious applications in fields from architecture, training and simulation to learning and development.\n\nCrytek's Engine Business Team will be available during GDC for meetings and to discuss licensing details with prospective clients. In addition, Crytek will be hosting a series of public presentations at their booth, #1414. Crytek's recruiters will also be at the show to answer questions about the company and accept resumes of interested applicants. Their booth is located at South Hall #2320 (Career Pavilion).\n\nAbout Crytek GmbH\n\nCrytek GmbH (\"Crytek\") is one of the world's leading independent development studios for interactive entertainment. It is based in Frankfurt am Main (Germany) and has additional studios in Kiev (Ukraine), Budapest (Hungary), Sofia (Bulgaria), Seoul (South Korea) and Nottingham (UK).
