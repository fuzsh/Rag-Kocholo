In our original incarnation as Free Radical Design, we developed the TimeSplitters series, Second Sight and Haze. As Crytek UK, we worked on the Crysis series, Warface and Ryse: Son of Rome. In 2014, we were acquired by world renowned publisher Deep Silver and became Deep Silver Dambuster Studios. In 2016 we released our last major project, Homefront: The Revolution. Through all of our different identities, we have continuously delivered immersive experiences for players with a focus on high quality FPS gameplay, exceptional art and narrative driven experiences. We are now developing the next instalment of the iconic zombie horror action franchise Dead Island.
