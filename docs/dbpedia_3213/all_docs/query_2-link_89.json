In a single jurisdiction, the largest number of protests were in Los Angeles County and New York City, with each reporting over 1,000 events.\n\nOf the 8,700 demonstrations, 574 were declared riots that included violence and other criminal activity. Ninety-four percent of major city police agencies dealt with a least one protest that included unlawful but non-violent acts, like disrupting a public roadway. For 79 percent of agencies, at least one demonstration involved violence, and about 72 percent reported officers harmed during protests.\n\nHouston had the largest number of people in a single event with 60,000 demonstrators. More than 62 percent of Portland, Oregon, demonstrations included violence, with more than 100 consecutive nights of riots.\n\nWhile the report concludes that just 7 percent of demonstrations were violent and that most of the violent acts were committed by individuals or small groups, the staggering number of demonstrations were a challenge for law enforcement.\n\nLooting was a common occurrence (2,385 instances), with 62% of major city law enforcement agencies indicating that at least one incident of looting occurred in their cities. This activity was primarily clustered during the first few days of protests. Of note, several agencies reported that in some instances, the looting appeared to be coordinated and organized. For example, some cities encountered \"looting caravans\" that moved throughout different neighborhoods. One agency reported 115 commercial burglaries occurred in just one day. Two other agencies reported $927,000 worth of damage as a result of looting in each of their jurisdictions, and another agency reported a single looting event at a shopping mall that resulted in over $70 million in damage. americanmillitarynews.com\n\nHomicide rate increased 34% in the fall compared to 2019,\n\nbut it's slightly better than this summer's peak violence\n\nThe homicide rate in major U.S. cities jumped by an average of 34% in September and October compared to the same period in 2019, new data shows.\n\nWhile significantly higher than 2019 homicide rates, the increase in the fall is less than the nearly 42% jump in homicides cities recorded during the summer between June and August compared to the same months in 2019, according to regularly updated data from the nonpartisan National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice.\n\nThe findings represent the most \"sizeable increase in homicide\" University of Missouri-St. Louis Professor Emeritus Richard Rosenfeld said he's seen in at least five years since the last wave of protests related to police violence took place throughout the U.S., but COVID-19 has most likely made violence worse. foxnews.com\n\nMinneapolis violence surges as police officers leave department in droves\n\nNearly six months after George Floyd's police killing sparked massive protests and left a wide swath of the city burned and destroyed, Minneapolis is grappling with dueling crises: an unprecedented wave of violence and droves of officer departures that the Minneapolis Police Department warns could soon leave the force unable to respond to emergencies.\n\nHomicides in Minneapolis are up 50 percent, with nearly 75 people killed across the city so far this year. More than 500 people have been shot, the highest number in more than a decade and twice as many as in 2019. And there have been more than 4,600 violent crimes - including hundreds of carjackings and robberies - a five-year high.\n\nMost of the violence has happened since Floyd's killing on Memorial Day, and some experts attribute it in part to the lingering anger over the slaying and the effects of the coronavirus, including job losses and the closure of community centers and other public spaces. washingtonpost.com\n\nSan Francisco police union clears way for civilians, not cops,\n\nto respond to non-violent calls for help\n\nThe president of San Francisco's police union has signed a letter of intent with the city that clears the way for non-sworn service providers - instead of police officers - to respond to calls involving mental health, homelessness and other non-violent issues. The document itemizes 17 types of calls for service in which police union officials agree civilians could be the primary responders. This list includes homelessness and quality of life calls, non-criminal mental health calls, juvenile disturbances, public health violations, traffic congestion, parking violations and dog complaints. sfchronicle.com\n\nThe Five Safest and Deadliest States for Both COVID-19 and Gun Violence\n\nThese Are the 2020 Safest and Least Safe Cities in America\n\nKenosha Protest Shooting Suspect Kyle Rittenhouse Ordered To Stand Trial\n\nCOVID Update\n\nUS: Over 14.5M Cases - 283K Dead - 8.5M Recovered\n\nWorldwide: Over 65.9M Cases - 1.5M Dead - 45.6M Recovered\n\nPrivate Industry Security Guard Deaths: 225 Law Enforcement Officer Deaths: 157\n\n*Red indicates change in total deaths\n\n'We have not yet seen the post-Thanksgiving peak,' Fauci warns as US cases soar\n\nNearly 213,000 new coronavirus cases were reported across the United States on Thursday, the highest figure yet.\n\nAnd at least 2,500 covid-19 deaths were reported for the third consecutive day, marking the deadliest stretch since the pandemic began.\n\nBut the government's top infectious-disease expert said the record-setting surge doesn't fully account for the expected increases after Americans traveled and gathered for Thanksgiving. \"We have not yet seen the post-Thanksgiving peak,\" Anthony S. Fauci said Friday. \"That's the concerning thing, because the numbers in and of themselves are alarming.\" washingtonpost.com\n\nCalifornia to impose regional stay-at-home order to ease Covid hospitalizations, governor says\n\nRetail stores could operate at 20% capacity - Restaurants only take-out and delivery\n\nCalifornia will impose a limited stay-at-home order on certain regions of the state where Covid-19 cases are placing a strain on intensive care units, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.\n\nThe state will be split into five regions - the Bay Area, Greater Sacramento, Northern California, San Joaquin Valley and Southern California. If the remaining ICU capacity in a region falls below 15%, it will trigger a three-week stay-at-home order, Newsom said.\n\nThe order would require bars, wineries, personal services, hair salons and barbershops to temporarily close. Personal services are businesses like nail salons, tattoo parlors and body waxing, according to the state's website. Schools that meet the state's health requirements and critical infrastructure would be allowed to remain open, and retail stores could operate at 20% capacity and restaurants would be allowed to offer take-out and delivery.\n\nSo far, none of the regions have triggered the stay-at-home order, though every part of the state is expected to at some point in December.

But that doesn't mean employers won't face a \"legal minefield\" if and when they decide to implement a vaccination policy.\n\nAlthough employees can be required to take a test as a precondition of their returning to work, according to trial attorney Misty Marris, \"there is no world where there is a COVID-19 mandatory vaccination policy that doesn't have exceptions to it.\"\n\nAs the U.S. waits for the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, as well as Moderna, to get emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, employers have to be ready to set up a framework for how employees will be allowed to come back safely. For both public and private employers this may mean encouraging employees to get vaccinated or implementing mandatory vaccination programs.\n\nThe Emergency Operations Center (EOC), which has issued guidance to employers throughout the pandemic, says the virus meets the standard of a \"direct threat.\" Since the virus is deemed a direct threat, employers have the ability to implement health checks in the workplace that would not normally be allowed under federal law in pre-pandemic times, according to Marris. This means employers have the ability to take someone's temperature before they come in or tell someone that they need to leave because they are exhibiting symptoms. foxbusiness.com\n\nCheesecake Factory settles with SEC over misleading Covid risk disclosures,\n\na first for a public company\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory is the first company to be charged by the SEC for misleading investors about the coronavirus pandemic's financial impacts.

The shift to online shopping was reflected in increased hiring for warehousing workers - mostly delivery couriers.
