        "text": "Accreditation\n\nThis degree has been accredited by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. Accreditation is a mark of assurance that the degree meets the standards set by BCS. An accredited degree entitles you to professional membership of BCS, which is an important part of the criteria for achieving Chartered IT Professional (CITP) status through the Institute. Some employers recruit preferentially from accredited degrees, and an accredited degree is likely to be recognised by other countries that are signatories to international accords. This degree is accredited by BCS for the purposes of fully meeting the academic requirement for registration as a Chartered IT Professional.\n\nThis degree has been accredited by BCS, on behalf of the Engineering Council for the purposes of partially meeting the academic requirement for a Chartered Engineer (CEng). Accreditation is a mark of assurance that the degree meets the standards set by the Engineering Council in the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC). An accredited degree will provide you with some or all of the underpinning knowledge, understanding and skills for eventual registration as an Incorporated (IEng) or Chartered Engineer (CEng).\n\nLinks with business and industry\n\nEvents and Lectures\n\ninKUbator\n\nThe inKUbator provides games students with the opportunity to hear and learn from a large number of industry speakers and to work together in interdisciplinary teams to create games. Past speakers have been from Sony, Splash Damage, Aardvark Swift, Interactive Selection, CryTek and Unity.\n\nGame Jams\n\nWe organise annual game jams, where students develop games over a 24 hour period in the games lab. These events, where students different courses meet and work together in a friendly and creative atmosphere, traditionally includes pizza! Students create games to a theme and in our most recent game jam the theme was \"world peace\". The most successful game was the game \"Great American Punch\" a Virtual Reality (VR) boxing game. Many of the games created in the game jam were then showcased at the PC Gamer Weekender in Kensington. This had a very positive write-up in the press (Techradar) as \"one of the top five most impressive sights\" at the event.\n\nHow we work with industry partners\n\nThe inKUbator, our game development studio, provides games students with the opportunity to hear and learn from a large number of industry speakers and to work together in interdisciplinary teams to create games. Past speakers have been from Sony, Splash Damage, Aardvark Swift, Interactive Selection, CryTek and Unity. InKUbator attracts talented students regardless of their faculty or year of study, because it provides an interdisciplinary space outside of formally taught modules.\n\nDevelop is Britain's top games industry conference at which Kingston presents an annual showcase of the top student work as part of our commitment to embed employability in the programme. One student said \"I just wanted to say a huge thank you for organising students to go to Develop in Brighton! That was a huge game changer for me trying to find somewhere to work, and I ended up getting multiple job offers from people coming and chatting to us at the Kingston stand. I will be working with an Indie game team, who were also at Develop.\"\n\nKingston University is an educational partner of Sony through PlayStation First. Through this partnership you will have the opportunity to learn how to develop games for the PlayStation 4 as part of the course, and speakers form Sony and other games companies regularly feature on our course.\n\nWe also have an industrial advisory panel which meets twice a year to ensure that the course is kept up to date.\n\nWork placement year\n\nHow you can work in industry during your course\n\nPlacements:\n\nprovide work experience that is relevant to your course and future career\n\nimprove your chances of graduating with a higher-grade degree\n\nenhance your CV\n\nlead to a graduate job\n\nenable you to earn a year's salary whilst studying (the vast majority of placements are paid)\n\nhelp you to select your final-year project.\n\n\"To be successful, tomorrow's leaders will need to be far more rounded individuals than ever before. They will collaborate in pursuit of shared goals. They will guide, challenge and support...They will have an appetite for change and a hunger for continuous improvement, and they will have an ethos of learning and development...\" Jeremy Darroch, Former Chief Executive, Sky.\n\n\"Doing a placement year effectively gives you one foot in the door of a future job and to stand out from the crowd... as well as enhancing my CV... and future interviews. It's a great motivator to be successful in my studies as it only serves to open even more doors and gain more skills.\" Placement student at Jagex Games Studios Ltd.\n\nThere is a lot of support available for students looking to secure a placement (e.g. a jobs board with placement vacancies, help with writing CVs and mock interviews). Getting a placement and passing the placement year are ultimately the student's responsibility.\n\nExamples of placements\n\nPlacements can be with large multinational companies, international companies, local companies and small start-ups; offering a diverse range of posts.
