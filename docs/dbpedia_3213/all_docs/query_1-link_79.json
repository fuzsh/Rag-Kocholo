        "text": "This was originally called Hunt: Horrors of the Gilded Age, when it was first announced back in 2014. It caught my eye because it looked like it might scratch that L4D itch I have (though this is possibly just leprosy). The game then disappeared (due to Crytek's financial woes), and re-emerged a month ago with a change of name, premise and studio; it's now being developed at Crytek HQ in Frankfurt, instead of Crytek USA. Official site.\n\nThe game is a combo of PvP and PvE, with five teams of two players competing on the same map. You're all bounty hunters searching for the same supernatural enemies in 1800s America. Find them, vanquish them back to hell, collect the bounty. Alternatively, let another team kill the creature, then you kill your rivals and steal the bounty. Or hunt down your opposition teams first, kill them, before going for the \"boss\".\n\nReports from the E3 floor have been very promising, with lots of praise given to the high risk/reward gameplay mechanics (there's some form of permadeath, and other survival RPG mechanics), as well as the tense, eerie atmosphere and visuals.\n\nFirst teaser from last month;\n\nE3 gameplay footage (complete with an irritating American dude);\n\nNot much more is known beyond a few articles. PC Gamer loved it for example, describing it as \"multiplayer Stalker-meets-Resident Evil\". No release date yet, though there'll be a chance to play it before release - that might be a closed beta, or early access.\n\nActually looks pretty cool but not sure if they can pull it off with permadeath - the novelty wears off after only a few rounds and tends to disincentivize people to play it except when they are 100% in the mood which tends to result in games become inactive very quickly.\n\nI dunno why developers tend to either run away from permadeath or go all in instead of a hybrid system of risk v reward ratio to it so people have more control over the level of risk they are prepared to play with at any one time and more likely to play."
