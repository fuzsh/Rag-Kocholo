        "text": "Speaking with Develop, Crytek co-founder, Avni Yerli confirmed that the studio will be announcing a brand new project at e3 this year, which the studio’s UK wing has been working on for quiet a while.\n\nHe said the new project will make the people and the gaming industry in UK in general, extremely happy:\n\nThe way the studio is set up means we don’t have to tell them what to do – the thinking is more about what we [Crytek management] can do to help them get on with their own work. We come to mutual conclusions on projects, and I think at E3 this year – or just after – we are going to make a big announcement that I think people will be happy about. I think the gaming scene and the UK scene are going to be very pleased with the new project they’re working on.\n\nHe also said, that Crytek UK, who’re making the game, are a group of extremely talented people right now:\n\nThe way the studio is set up means we don’t have to tell them what to do – the thinking is more about what we [Crytek management] can do to help them get on with their own work.
