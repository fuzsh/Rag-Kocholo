        "text": "A number of staff at Crytek UK have not been paid their full salary since April 21st, a source connected to the matter has told Develop.\n\nThe source, who has ties with the studio, said since April, employees had received small payments of around £700 last month. At the time they had been told a deal was being made to secure money from Deutsche Bank, but that was since delayed.\n\nA further payment was paid on June 16th, with staff then told to expect payment on Friday, June 27th. Our source claims however “this now looks like it won’t happen either”.\n\nCrytek UK is currently working on Homefront: The Revolution under what been a team of 90 developers.\n\nDevelop understands that since work on the game began, 40 staff have left, and the issues with salaries “has added to that number”. While there has been high turnover with new recruits coming in, it was said that the team cannot hire as fast as people are leaving.\n\nIt was also claimed that a number of staff have been promoted to senior roles recently, with such employees required to hand in three months notice if they choose to resign. These staff have also allegedly not been given pay rises “equivalent to the job role”, leading to suggestions it was a tactic to ensure staff stay on at the studio.\n\nAs a result of these issues, morale at the studio is said to be generally low, with unhappiness particularly directed at “differences with the creative direction of the project”, as well as pay.\n\nDespite the staff departures, our source said that following the cancellation of Ryse 2, many developers from the Frankfurt office – where the sequel to the Xbox One launch title was to be made – are now working with Crytek UK on Homefront.\n\nDevelopers at the Germany-based office have had their own problems however, with issues apparently starting as early as last year, though at that time the UK studio was unaffected. It is not currently clear however exactly what has happened in Frankfurt.\n\nA Crytek spokesperson declined to comment on the matter."
