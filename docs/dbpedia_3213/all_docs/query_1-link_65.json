After plastering America with adverts, THQ overcame tepid critical response and shipped over 2.6 million copies of Homefront by the end of March 2011.\n\nYerli suggests that Crytek has been granted a reassuring amount of \"creative freedom\" over Homefront, and aims to bring its war-ravaged world to life \"in a new and innovative way.\" It'll take some time, though -- the Homefront sequel is scheduled to launch on PC and consoles in THQ's fiscal 2014, meaning anywhere between April 2013 and March 2014.\n\nUpdate: Joystiq has confirmed that the Homefront sequel will be built by Crytek's Nottingham, UK studio on the \"latest\" CryEngine technology.",
