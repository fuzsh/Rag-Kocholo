        "text": "Best game , worst devs/support\n\nI've been playing this game for over 1 year now and I always hated fps games.. never played any for long, tried CS, CoD etc but I preferred MMORPG.\n\nThen a friend told me about this game, it mixes so many games into 1 so yeah after I bought the new Xbox series X I knew what game I wanted to try. After about 10h into it I was hooked... I loved it and hated it... When it's a bad day YOU hate it... So much... Haha but overall you can't stop play!\n\nI've meet some real nice mates over the game using the random players matchup, few of those I play daily with. Ofc I've meet some stupid ones to and trolls and even cheaters. But mostly it's a great experience. It's a game everyone should try but don't even know it exist.\n\nThis was my feeling over this game\n\nUntil now..\n\nThere's different type of strategies to go for in this game and like many others I use traps and frag bombs.\n\nIf you play 100 games i promise you will end up killing team mates with both grenades or traps (even if you ping and tell at them) never had any big issue with this but, some day ago I crossed path with a troll. He was my team mate and after our other random tema mate died I managed kill 4. I turn around and he fan me with a chain pistol.. I survive and run and he finish me with a shotgun. Laugh and leave the game. I reported this and was pissed bec I lost a good weapon and high hunter (prestige is pain)\n\n1 day later , I get a error when I try to log on game. \"You been banned because team killing\" What!?\n\nI send a ticket to the support (since they have no real chat support and need to wait on them to answer)\n\nI got answer the day after \"you been reported several times for killing members\" yeah but that's with traps I didn't shoot them or killed them it was mistake and they run into mine even tho I ping and yelled in mig\n\nTheir answer is \"we can't help you, maybe you shouldn't use traps\" WHY do you have friendly fire and traps IF you can get banned for doing so!? And this can happen again and if so... You get banned longer time!\n\nSo they tell us to NOT use all the strategies gameplay that the game offer because YOU can by mistake kill you're team and they can ban you for it!? When I ask for evidence I just got back \"we can't give that\"\n\nI invested so much time and great fun in this game.. money to... And this is what you get from the devs?\n\nTold them to delete my account and refund me. This is the best game I ever played but with the worst devs I ever meet in any game.. and I've played alot games on both pc, mobile and Xbox.\n\nSo yeah it's sad to realize you're favorite game is dead for good not because it's a bad game or that I don't like it anymore... But because you get treated like pure sh#t by the devs. And that is really something I never experienced before in any game.\n\nR I P\n\nHunt Showdown\n\n//Gamehi"
