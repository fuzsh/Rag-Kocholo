Crytek is still a seperate company. Since Crytek is small and wants to focus on development, they can use the long arms of our EA overlords to worry about all of the post-dev stuff such as packaging, distribution, sales, etc. So, the developers can continue to write code and leave all the mondane stuff to the sales weasels at EA.\n\nBut doesn't that also mean that EA could pressurise Crytek into rushing out games, making them more prone to bugs?\n\nThey can try. Crytek can say no.\n\nIf crytek says no then they severly jepordize the relationship they ahve with EA. EA is large enough to say \"F off\" and dump crytek. Once crytek begins to hurt from that happening they will be so desperate that EA may be able to outright buy them."
