        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nPaid loot boxes are products within video games that players buy to obtain randomized rewards [1,2]. Some loot boxes are ‘non-paid’ and can be obtained without spending real-world money; however, the present study focuses on paid loot boxes. Hereinafter, ‘loot boxes’ refers to all forms of randomized video game monetization methods, i.e. any ‘in-game transactions with randomized elements’ [3]. Concerns have been raised about loot boxes' similarities with gambling and the risks that consumers might overspend money and experience harm [4–9]. Children and other vulnerable consumers (e.g. people experiencing problem gambling issues) might be at particular risk of harm [10,11]. Many countries are considering imposing legal regulation, and a few countries have already taken regulatory actions [12–16]. However, in most countries at present, paid loot boxes are specifically regulated only through industry self-regulation [17]. There are two prominent loot box self-regulatory measures: probability disclosures and text-based warning labels attached to age ratings.\n\nThe Apple App Store, similar to many other hardware and software platforms [18], imposes the self-regulatory requirement that all games available on that platform ‘offering “loot boxes” or other mechanisms that provide randomized virtual items for purchase’ [19] must disclose the probabilities of obtaining those items to customers prior to purchase. Xiao et al. assessed companies' compliance with Apple's self-regulatory measure among the 100 highest-grossing iPhone games in the UK and found that only 64% of games containing loot boxes disclosed probabilities. This compliance rate was significantly lower than the 95.6% observed in Mainland China where probability disclosures were (and continue to be) required by law [20].\n\nThe second self-regulatory measure is to prewarn players about the presence of loot boxes. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), established by the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), reviews the content of video games and provides age ratings depending on the inclusion of certain material, e.g. the amount and degree of violence and sexual content [21]. The ESRB is adopted in North America. PEGI (Pan-European Game Information) performs a similar function in Europe generally [22]. Recognizing the concerns that have been raised about loot boxes, on 13 April 2020, the ESRB and PEGI announced that they will attach an additional text-based warning to the age ratings of video games containing loot boxes [23]. The ESRB uses the ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ ‘interactive element’ [3] ( ), while PEGI originally proposed to use the ‘In-game Purchases (Includes Paid Random Items)’ ‘content descriptor’ ( ) [24]. PEGI secretly changed its label to instead read ‘In-game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ ( ), which is identical to the ESRB's (except for the capitalization of the ‘G’), soon after the initial announcement (without a further announcement) by retroactively partially changing the initial announcement (see §4.3.3 for further detail). As of 16 January 2023, the PEGI announcement's text still referred to the older label, but the image accompanying has been changed to reflect the current (i.e. the ESRB's) label. These two largely identical labels are intended to cover, according to the ESRB, ‘all transactions with randomized elements’ [3]. The ESRB and PEGI both consciously chose to specifically not use the term ‘loot boxes’ to ‘avoid confusing consumers’ [3], particularly parents who might not have sufficient knowledge about video games or ‘ludoliteracy’.\n\nAccording to the ESRB, its label accounts for:\n\n‘… loot boxes and all similar mechanics that offer random items in exchange for real-world currency or in-game currency that can be purchased with real money’ [3].\n\nAccording to PEGI, its label covers:\n\n‘… all in-game offers to purchase digital goods or premiums where players don't know exactly what they are getting prior to the purchase (e.g. loot boxes, card packs, prize wheels)’ [24].\n\nThese definitions accord with the wide definition for ‘loot boxes’ adopted by the present study. These labels were intended to ‘provide the additional information if the game features paid random items’ [24], such that ‘…consumers can make more informed decisions when purchasing or downloading a game, instead of finding out after the fact’ [3]. Notably, the presence of these labels, or rather the presence of loot boxes, does not affect a game's age rating, because neither the ESRB nor PEGI recognizes loot boxes as actual ‘gambling’ or ‘simulated gambling’ [25,26]. These labels can therefore attach to games containing loot boxes but are rated suitable for young children (i.e. ESRB's ‘E’ or ‘Everyone’ rating and PEGI's ‘PEGI 3’ rating) [24]. This is unlike how other content, such as depiction of ‘realistic violence’, ‘illegal drugs, alcohol or tobacco’ or ‘simulated gambling’, would (in certain situations, automatically [27]) cause the game to attract higher age ratings [28,29]. I have previously criticized the labels for not providing sufficient information to truly help players and parents make more informed purchase decisions [23]. The labels fail to identify and explain where and how the loot boxes in a specific game can be purchased, and so players and children cannot easily actively avoid engaging with the mechanics. The labels also do not signify whether or not the relevant mechanic provides rewards that can then be transferred to other players and ‘cashed-out’ [30] (i.e. have real-world monetary value), which is a relevant consideration for many gambling regulators [9,16,17]. The labels might be of some assistance by providing information at the initial point of purchasing or downloading the game; however, once the player has begun playing the game, the labels are no longer helpful. An improvement might be to specifically describe the loot box mechanics to help players actively avoid them and to provide a choice in the options menu to turn the ability to purchase loot boxes on or off (potentially even with the default option set to ‘off’). Through experimental studies, Garrett et al. have concluded that these labels fail to adequately warn consumers about the potential risks involved with loot boxes and therefore ‘fail to adequately inform consumer spending decisions’ [31].\n\nThe ESRB's and PEGI's wide definitions for ‘in-game transactions with randomized elements’ [3] and what the present study refers to as ‘loot boxes’ are effectively identical, despite trivial variations in the wording of the definitions and of the labels. Therefore, the reasonable expectation is that a game containing loot boxes should be labelled with the ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ interactive element after being rated by the ESRB in North America and with the ‘In-game Purchases (Includes Paid Random Items)’ content descriptor or its newer variation after being rated by PEGI in Europe. The ESRB and PEGI should be consistent when deciding whether a game contains loot boxes. If one of them fails to label a game with the loot box warning when the other has done so, then the former has highly likely inaccurately rated said game's loot box presence by failing to identify it. The only highly unlikely exception being that a game potentially has separate North American and European versions and only one of which contained loot boxes: such a situation has never been popularly reported.\n\nResearch Question 1: Are video games being consistently given the loot box self-regulatory warning label by the ESRB and PEGI?\n\nHypothesis 1: All games that have been labelled with the ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ interactive element by the ESRB should also have been labelled with the ‘In-game Purchases (Includes Paid Random Items)’ content descriptor or its newer variation by PEGI and vice versa.\n\nThe ESRB and PEGI only play a direct role when rating physically published games and are only indirectly involved in the rating of each individual digitally released game. Both the ESRB and PEGI are ‘participating rating authorities’ of the IARC (International Age Rating Coalition), which is a simplified system that allows game companies to simultaneously obtain multiple age ratings for use in different territories for digitally delivered games [32]. After companies fill in a single questionnaire about their games' content, the IARC will produce age ratings that ‘also include content descriptors and interactive elements, identifying games and apps that [inter alia] offer in-app/game purchases (as well as those that are randomized)’ (emphasis added) [32]. Specifically, the IARC uses the ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ interactive element, which is the ESRB's label and whose wording differs slightly from that of the PEGI label. The IARC is not implemented on the Apple App Store (which uses its own age rating system [33]) but is adopted by the Google Play Store and other major platforms [32]. Depending on which national version of the Google Play Store is visited, the appropriate age rating for that territory is shown. For example, for the game Guns of Glory (FunPlus, 2017), the US Google Play Store displays the ESRB rating of Everyone 10+ (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diandian.gog&hl=en&gl=us), while the Danish Google Play Store displays the PEGI rating of 7 (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diandian.gog&hl=en&gl=dk). Guns of Glory has previously been identified as containing loot boxes in multiple studies [18,34,35]. Indeed, the IARC has attached the ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ label to the game on both the US and Danish Google Play Stores alongside the respective ESRB and PEGI age ratings.\n\nNotably, the IARC explains that ‘Interactive Elements are assigned universally, providing notice about the ability to make in-game purchases (including randomized ones)…’ (emphasis added) [36]. This contrasts with the IARC's assignment of ‘Age Rating and Content Descriptors’, which will differ by region [36]. In other words, a game containing loot boxes can receive different age ratings in different regions under the IARC system, but the loot box warning label, which is an interactive element, should be attached to that game regardless of region. Universal or global assignment of the label means that the IARC has effectively extended the ‘jurisdictional’ scope of the loot box self-regulatory warning label requirement to countries beyond those covered by the ESRB and PEGI. For example, Germany, despite being in Europe, does not use PEGI and instead adopts the alternative USK (Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle (USK) to provide age ratings. Up until 31 December 2022 (inclusive), the USK did not assess the presence of loot boxes and did not require the use of a label to signify their presence in relation to physical games marketed in Germany [37]. (On 14 December 2022, the USK announced that it will begin to assess the presence of loot boxes and attach the ‘In-Game-Käufe + zufällige Objekte [In-game purchases + random items]’ label accordingly to new game submissions from 1 January 2023 [38]). Notably, as of 16 December 2022, the official USK web page explaining the integration of the USK age ratings within the IARC system has not been updated to explain that the IARC will now additionally attach ‘In-Game-Käufe (zufällige Objekte möglich) [In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)]’ to games containing loot boxes and, instead, the web page still only states that games allowing for additional in-game purchases will be attached with the generic ‘In-Game-Einkäufe [In-Game Purchases]’ [39]. However, the USK is a ‘participating rating authority’ of the IARC [32], and so, even before the USK introduced its own loot box warning label, games containing loot boxes were being attached with ‘In-Game-Käufe (zufällige Objekte möglich)’ on the German Google Play Store: for example, Guns of Glory (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diandian.gog&hl=de&gl=de) as of 18 September 2022.\n\nDraft laws in the US that have failed to pass [40] tried to require games containing loot boxes to ‘prominently disclose to the consumer at the time of … purchase a bright red label that is easily legible and which reads: \"Warning: contains in-game purchases and gambling-like mechanisms which may be harmful or addictive\"’ [41,42]. Another (since died) Bill intended to require the following (arguably not entirely scientifically inaccurate) loot box warning label within the US state of Illinois:\n\n‘Attention Parents: A Loot Box System exists in this game that permits an unlimited amount of REAL MONEY to be spent without any age restriction. REAL MONEY is exchanged for random digital items. This process has been linked to REAL LIFE GAMBLING ADDICTIONS in both children and adults. Please regulate your own spending as well as your children's spending’ [43].\n\nOther countries might be considering imposing similar information-based warning labels to address the potential harms of loot boxes. Previous research has found that other industries, such as alcohol [44], tobacco [45] and gambling [46], have all taken various corporate actions that probably reduced the effectiveness of product warnings. Loot box probability disclosures are known to have been implemented suboptimally by video game companies: specifically, lacking prominence and being difficult to access [18,20]. Compliance with Belgium's ‘ban’ on loot boxes through applying pre-existing gambling law has also been poor [35].\n\nWhen filling in the content rating questionnaire, Google warns that: ‘Misrepresentation of your app's content may result in removal or suspension, so it is important to provide accurate responses to the content rating questionnaire’. The IARC also recognizes that ratings can be changed through ‘post-release modification’ [47] and states that: ‘IARC rating authorities [inter alia, the ESRB and PEGI] monitor ratings assigned to games and apps to ensure accuracy. Corrections, if needed, are implemented promptly by storefronts’. However, considering prior research, reasonable doubt must be cast on the compliance rate with the self-regulatory requirement of attaching loot box warning labels.\n\nRather than to assess the 100 presently highest-grossing Google Play Store games as to whether they contain loot boxes (as previous studies have done [18,20,34,35]) and then to check whether they are displaying the label, it is more economical and efficient to instead examine games previously known to contain loot boxes. If a game that was known to contain loot boxes is displaying the label, then it is no longer necessary to assess whether said game still contains loot boxes through gameplay, as this can be reasonably assumed. Only those games previously known to contain loot boxes but are not displaying the label need to be reassessed through gameplay. This expediency is desirable because it is hoped that the present study's results could be published promptly and thereby contribute to the efforts of the UK Government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport's technical working group that is developing industry self-regulation for loot boxes with the aim of reducing harm [48]. The sample selection (as detailed below) was based on previously highest-grossing games (many of which probably still remained high grossing and popular presently) [18,20,34,35]. This, therefore, represents a sample of particular interest for players, parents, policymakers and the age-rating organizations. However, some limitations should be noted. Firstly, the compliance rate among this sample of historically (and potentially presently) high-grossing games is not necessarily representative of that of financially worse performing games (which might be less scrutinized by players and other companies and therefore less likely to comply or, contrastingly, might be performing worse financially because they have accurately displayed the label) or the overall situation on the Google Play Store. Secondly, these games were previously highlighted in published academic work as having contained loot boxes [18,20,34,35], and, therefore, their operating companies might have since become more likely to comply (when compared with a newly published game that has not yet gained any notoriety), as companies have reportedly complied with the Belgian ‘ban’ on loot boxes only following the publication of Xiao and media reporting thereof [35,49] and 4 years after they were originally supposed to have done so.\n\nResearch Question 2: Are video games previously known to be high grossing and contain loot boxes and presently containing loot boxes on the Google Play Store accurately displaying the IARC ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ label?\n\nHypothesis 2: All titles in the present sample of video games previously known to contain loot boxes, and which are presently available on the Google Play Store and continue to contain loot boxes, will accurately display the IARC ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ label.\n\nThe present series of two studies did not seek to assess the efficacy of the loot box self-regulatory labels on consumer behaviour (see [31]) and instead sought to assess (i) whether the ESRB and PEGI have consistently applied the loot box self-regulatory warning label and (ii) whether companies have complied with this self-regulation by accurately labelling games containing loot boxes with the relevant notice.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe present study assessed compliance with the ESRB's, PEGI's and IARC's loot box presence warning label of ‘In-Game Purchases (Includes Random Items)’ through two studies. Study 1 found that, as to physical games rated by the ESRB and PEGI, there were many instances (60.6% of all games labelled by either age rating organization or 16.1% using a more equitable methodology) where the two organizations have been inconsistent and not both applied the label to the same game. The vast majority of those inconsistencies were caused by the ESRB not retroactively labelling older games, which PEGI has done with ease and at minimal costs. The ESRB has refused to emulate PEGI's better approach. Four cases where the ESRB and one case where PEGI culpably failed to label a game were identified. The ESRB admitted fault in relation to one game and refused to admit fault in relation to three other games, even though those failings arose from the same circumstances as the one case for which PEGI admitted fault and committed to improving. Overall, PEGI's implementation of the label is reasonably satisfactory given its proactive retroactive application and demonstrable willingness to do even better. By contrast, the ESRB's implementation is less satisfactory: because many older games are not, and will not, be labelled, the measure could not be relied upon by consumers and parents to provide accurate information in relation to historical games that remain popular presently. The ESRB must also be criticized for being unreceptive to practicable suggestions that would improve its procedure. However, in relation to newly released physical games for console/PC platforms, the labelling at both PEGI and the ESRB should be reasonably accurate and reliable.\n\nStudy 2 found that, as to digital games rated through the IARC, most games (71.0%) containing loot boxes on the Google Play Store did not accurately display the label. Most of the identified non-compliant games have since been labelled through rectifications at the author's request. However, the IARC generally denied liability (unconvincingly) by stating that older games submitted for rating prior to February 2022 are not required to display the label and has refused to apply the label to older games beyond the sample that the author has identified (which represents only a tiny proportion of all games containing loot boxes on the Google Play Store). At present, this self-regulatory measure cannot be treated as a trustworthy and dependable authentication of whether a game contains loot boxes on the Google Play Store. PEGI has admitted that the Google Play Store poses a ‘challenge’ that presently does not have ‘a simple solution’. Consumers, parents, regulators and all other stakeholders should rely on the label cautiously: a game marked with the label will contain loot boxes; however, a game not thusly labelled may also contain loot boxes. At present, this measure fails to provide accurate information to consumers. The mere existence of this measure cannot be used to justify the non-regulation of loot boxes, given the poor compliance and doubtful efficacy (even if the measure is complied with satisfactorily). In addition, this measure (or an equivalent) is not implemented on the Apple App Store. Currently, consumers are not being provided with adequate information about loot box presence on the two major mobile app stores and the mobile platform generally.\n\nAge rating organizations are expected to, either directly (i.e. the ESRB and PEGI in Study 1 and the IARC in Study 2) or indirectly (i.e. the ESRB and PEGI in Study 2), provide effective and accurate information and content moderation. The ESRB and PEGI promised to label games containing loot boxes on the Google Play Store by endorsing the IARC, but the IARC has demonstrably failed to do so. This ill-advised endorsement caused them to betray the trust placed in them by consumers, parents, and policymakers that rely on them to make informed purchasing decisions and self-regulate the industry. Most high-grossing games were released prior to February 2022, and this is unlikely to change for years to come. Stakeholders would naturally expect, and should demand, the measure to be applied retroactively. Otherwise, this measure would have little practical benefit (besides falsely demonstrating the industry supposedly taking action to address loot box harms). The existing system must be improved upon: loot box warning labels should be applied retroactively, as the minimal additional compliance costs are justified. Age rating organizations should collaborate and cross-check each other's labelling to correct mistakes and enhance accuracy. The IARC rating system relies solely on self-disclosure, which has demonstrably been inadequate. In relation to the highest-grossing games, the IARC ought to involve additional external scrutiny that seeks to verify the self-disclosures' accuracy and completeness. The design and consumer protection efficacy of the label in practice (e.g. whether it is well understood by parents) probably also requires improvement. Regulators should strive toward developing a uniform and effective label that provides sufficient information without overexaggerating potential harms."
