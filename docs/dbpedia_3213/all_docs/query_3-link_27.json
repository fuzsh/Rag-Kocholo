But I understand some employees of Crytek have been in other companies under similar situations and they have gone out of business,\" Yerli told Eurogamer. \"We have a lot of substance in Crytek.\"\n\nYerli rejected speculation Crytek needed to unload the Homefront intellectual property and Crytek UK to survive. Homefront was recently sold to Deep Silver, which opted to open up a new studio. He says the recent financing Crytek received will allow it to focus in the short term on Warface, Arena of Fate and Hunt.\n\n\"That transformation was painful. We paid the price. Now we come out of it much stronger. I hope people will see through our games these are not just empty words,\" said Yerli. The full interview available at Eurogamer covers a lot of ground."
