        "text": "To say the creation of Homefront: The Revolution has been tumultuous is an understatement. Announced in 2013 by THQ, publisher of the original game, development started under Crytek UK but stalled after THQ went bankrupt. The IP shifted to new owners Deep Silver, and the game resumed under the newly formed Dambuster Studios in Nottingham -- mostly made of staff from the now also-shuttered Crytek UK.\n\nThe fact that the game is playable after all that corporate hopscotch is surprising. The fact that it's shaping up to be a promising slice of urban guerilla warfare is nothing less than a miracle. WIRED.co.uk went hands on with the game at the Insomnia55 gaming festival this bank holiday weekend, finding it a strong shooter with impressive enemy AI, though not without some corrective measures needed.\n\nSet in 2029, America has been occupied by the Greater Korean Republic for four years. Players control Ethan Brady, a young recruit to a new and growing rebellion, engaging in underground warfare to take back Philadelphia and then the country. WIRED.co.uk's hands on session was centred on one of the Strike Zone areas, where revolutionaries must take control of strategic territory from the oppressive forces of the Korean People's Army.\n\nThe striking first impression is a feeling of helplessness. Wade into a shoot out with the KPA and you will not survive. The invading force is armoured, packing serious heat, has a vast fleet of armoured vehicles and utilises endless drone sweeps to monitor for seditious activity. The resistance has some cobbled-together weapons, and dress like they're going to see a Nirvana tribute band. After years of games such as Halo, Call of Duty or Battlefield, it's actually refreshing to be the underdog and really have to struggle for each victory.\n\nSubterfuge and calculated strikes are your greatest allies in Homefront. Crawling under rubble to avoid scans, sneaking up behind snipers to allow your allies safe passage, or evading an entire platoon of KPA all feel satisfying ways of out-manoeuvring a superior force. Environmental assaults, such as dropping prepared explosive barrels onto convoys, are your sole \"big gun\". Otherwise, one of the simplest but most effective tools is your own approach to \"drones\" -- RC cars with mounted cameras, packed with explosives. Sneak one under an enemy convoy and half the job is done for you, without you getting in the KPA's sights.\n\nOf course, any survivors or monitoring air drones will then call in reinforcements. Even with this early build, enemy AI seems sharp -- squads will attempt to surround you, or vary their attacks. They'll look for cover of their own, and send in their drones ahead. It leads to tense, frantic shootouts that you're desperate to escape.\n\nAvoiding direct combat altogether is better, if possible. To help with this, dirt bikes -- or at least a dirt bike, in this build -- give you an almost free run of the open world map, and not just at ground level. Dambuster says it was inspired by the vehicle movement in Trials, and so the game world is constructed to allow you to ride up and over obstacles. The Resistance has conveniently created ramps almost everywhere, and you can power up stairs too. Zooming past patrols delivers a great sense of freedom -- \"so long, suckers!\" -- while using the noise of the bike can create distractions, drawing attention from other rebels.\n\nThe open world actually seemed somewhat closed-off though. Wander too far from the mission area, and a warning flashes up to return. This was particularly frustrating when we were trying to sneak a wide berth away from KPA patrols, to then tackle the core objective from a quieter route. Conversely, keeping to a relatively linear progression at least during missions allows for some branching moments. Allies may call for help, and you have the choice to break off and assist or continue with your objectives, either option having impact.\n\nWhile the experience of pushing back against the overwhelming enemy is captivating, a lot of the actual mechanics of the game aren't as gripping. Weapon modifications, crafting of incendiary devices, the basic implementation of a flashlight -- all feel like the same sort of details we've seen elsewhere. Then again, can much be done with the \"language\" of first-person shooters at this point, when the rules and expectations of the genre are so well-entrenched in the audience's collective consciousness?\n\nAt present, Homefront's biggest problem is one of momentum. Not in the flow of action; that's pleasantly nippy throughout, the back and forth between the scrappy rebels and the KPA is regularly thrilling. It's the actual speed of movement that troubles. The run speed is about what you'd want for a walking pace, and what would constitute an actual run simply isn't on offer. Worse, actually activating a run, with another genre-standard click of the left thumbstick, feels imprecise and almost laggy. Brady will hobble along at a slightly accelerated pace for a few steps, before ending up going almost slower than before. If feels as though constantly-increasing pressure needs to be applied to keep running, which isn't what you want when running for your life from a heavily armed, technologically advanced invading army.\n\nThere's also a slightly disorienting quirk of the camera when riding a bike. Adjusting your view with the right stick has the unfortunate effect of altering the direction you're steering with to the left. This is all coming from a pre-alpha build of the game though, so hopefully these wrinkles can be ironed out before it ships next spring.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK"
