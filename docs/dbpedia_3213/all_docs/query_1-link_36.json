        "text": "Deep Silver has announced. that it has acquired the Homefront property from Crytek, including the recently-announced Homefront: The Revolution. Notably, this studio is located in Nottingham, England, the same city Crytek UK is based out of--suggesting former Crytek UK staffers will continue to work on the game, but for a new company.\n\nUpdate: Crytek has issued a statement on its status, confirming Crytek UK staff will be moved to Deep Silver's new studio. It also announced layoffs at Crytek USA.\n\nMost notably, as suspected, the Crytek UK employees who had been working on The Revolution will move to the newly founded Deep Silver Dambuster Studios which, like Crytek UK, is based out of Nottingham, England. This is according to a statement issued by Crytek, which doesn't indicate whether this means Crytek UK--formerly Free Radical Design--has been shut down. We've followed up with Crytek for clarification about whether this leaves any staff still at Crytek UK, which not long ago had talked about the prospect of making a new TimeSplitters, the series for which it is best known.\n\nAs part of Crytek's \"internal restructuring,\" staff at its Austin, Texas location (Crytek USA) will be laid off, although \"several\" employees will remain behind to assist with CryEngine support for North American developers who have licensed the game-development engine. The game that the studio had been developing, Hunt: Horrors of the Gilded Age, will now be handled by Crytek's Frankfurt studio, developer of the Crysis series and Ryse: Son of Rome.\n\nSeveral of Crytek's studios--including Budapest, Istanbul, Kiev, and Sofia--will \"continue to operate as usual,\" while a \"closer collaboration between Crytek's studios in Shanghai and Seoul is under review.\"\n\n\"As we look to cement Crytek's future, this strategic deal with [Deep Silver parent company] Koch Media would allow us to continue with our ambitious goals to become an online publisher,\" Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli said in a statement. \"With Warface, Arena of Fate, and Hunt, we believe we have the perfect portfolio and teams to make that happen. We would like to thank all our staff--past and present--in both Nottingham and Austin for their contributions to the company, and we wish all the very best to anyone who may no longer be under the Crytek banner moving forward.\""
