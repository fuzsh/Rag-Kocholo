        "text": "The deployment of negative advertising as an indispensable concept for survival in political environment has increased drastically in the past few years. Thus, many research works have focused on the assessment of the efficiency of negative advertising in any political competitions. However, the few studies that have been carried out in Nigeria did not really focus on the externality influence negative advertising tends to have on political parties’ performance at polls. Therefore, this study, which focused on Southwest electorate, examined the relationship between the use of negative advertisements and political parties’ performance at polls in Nigeria’s 2015 general elections, and the accidental effects negative advertisements have on the general elections. This study, driven by the Agenda Setting and Framing Theories, adopted Survey, Focus Group Discussion (FGD), In-depth Interview, and Content Analysis methods. While Stratified sampling technique was used to divide all the local governments in Oyo State into urban and semi-urban local governments, Simple Random technique was employed to select two local governments from each stratum and one community in each selected local government, making four communities in the state. Purposive and Convenience sampling techniques were used to select a representative sample of 280 respondents – 70 respondents from each community under each selected local government. Also, 10 political leaders and analysts were purposively selected from five political parties – Accord party, All Progressives Congress, Labour Party, Peoples Democratic Party, and Social Democratic Party – in Oyo State. For four FGD sessions, one in each community, quota sampling technique was used to select seven, which is the 10% of the respondents selected in each community. This then produced 28 discussants from all the communities. Thus, questionnaire, coding sheet, FGD and interview guides were the instruments used to collect data. The data generated from survey and content analyses were analysed using frequency count and simple percentages as well as the Pearson correlation coefficient while the data retrieved from FGD and interview were transcribed and interpreted. Then, findings were presented in tables and charts and were discussed. A political advertisement is negative when it damages the reputation of a candidate no matter how factual or subjective the message may be. The contents that dictate the negativity of an advertisment include candidate’s defamation (79.6%), false information (70.4%), and revelation of unfavourable antecedents (67.1%). Notably, true information wrongly presented had about half 49.0% of the total frequency of the respondents’ responses, and this was corroborated by the majority of the electorate in the FGD sessions, advertisements bearing true information about a candidate, but not well presented might be refuted and counted as negative. Also, APC (54.0%) and PDP (45.0%) election results revealed that negative advertising can cause negative externalities for candidates who are not object of the attack. In addition, there is significant relationship between Negative Political Advertisements and Candidate’s or Party’s Performance. However, as effective as negative advertising is in winning elections, it may have some negative or boomerang effects on the sponsor. These effects include political apathy (76.7%), electorate’s wrong voting (65.0%) and voting for the attacked candidate (83.9%). Hence, voters’ characteristics and competitive interactions, to a great extent, influence candidates’ performance when advertising is negative. Though negative advertising enhances candidate’s chance of winning in an election and positively influences the voting decision of the electorate in favour of the sponsor, meticulousness is needed in its application. It is, therefore, recommended that political parties and their candidates should be extremely careful when using negative advertisements."
