        "text": "WEEK 3 OVERVIEW OF THE PROPERTY LAW PRACTICE\n\nThe word property has a variety of meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Sometimes, it may mean ownership or title such as when it is said that property in the goods passes to the buyer immediately the contract of sale is concluded whether or not the goods have been physically transferred to him. It may mean the ‘res’ (thing) over which ownership may be exercised. It may also mean an interest in a thing less than ownership but nevertheless conferring certain rights such as when it is said that ‘B’ as pledge has ‘special property’ in the subject matter of the security. – Donald v. Suckling (1866) LR 1QB p. 585.\n\nIn whichever sense the word property is used, property law is designed to regulate the relation of persons to things thereby providing a secure foundation for the acquisition, enjoyment and disposal of things or wealth.\n\nProperty may also mean the right of a person to something tangible and physical, such as a parcel of land. It may also relate to something intangible such as a right in a work protected by copyright. This view finds support in section 2(1) of the Conveyancing Act 1881 which defines “property”, to include real and personal property, any estate or interest in any property, real or personal, any debt, anything in action, any other right or interest. Land is depicted to include land of any tenure, tenements, hereditaments, corporeal or incorporeal and houses and other buildings, also an undivided share in land – Section 2 of the CA.\n\nConveyance is the application of the law of Real Property in practice. It is not often easy to differentiate between real property law and its practice, for while the former is static, the latter is dynamic. Real property law deals with the rights and liabilities of landowners, while its practice (conveyancing) deals with the art of creating and transferring rights in land. Yet, one cannot be a good conveyance without a good grasp of real property law. Conveyancing transactions may occur in a number of situations such as sales of land, leases, and mortgages. Conveyances are described as including “assignment, appointment, lease, settlement and other assurance and convenant to surrender, made by deed, on a sale, mortgage, demise, or settlement of any property, or any other dealing with of for any property”. However, a Will is an exception to a conveyance – Section 2(1) of the PCL, 1959 because it is ambulatory (movable), which “…distinguishes a will from a conveyance…,” the latter being “inter vivos, which operates at once or at some fixed time.”\n\nAPPLICABLE LAWS\n\nThese are thus:\n\n1) Customary Law;\n\n2) Case Law;\n\n3) Received English Law; and\n\n4) Nigerian Legislation\n\nCUSTOMARY LAW\n\nThis is a set of rules of conduct applying to persons and things in a particular locality, which exist at the relevant and material time and is recognized and adhered to by the inhabitants of the community as binding on them. Custom is usually a question of fact which is required to be pleaded and proved by witnesses in any legal proceeding – Olubodun v. Lawal (2008) All FWLR (Pt. 438) p. 1468; Odutola v. Sanya (2008) All FWLR (Pt. 400) p. 780.\n\nThese rules and customs vary from one society to another. The simple requirements of payment of the purchase price; the presence of witnesses; and allowing the vendor into possession, are sufficient elements for sale under native law and custom in Nigeria. Once these 3 elements exist, a valid sale could be said to have taken place – Adesanya v. Aderonmu (2000) FWLR (Pt. 15) p. 2492. However, the provisions of the CA and PCL do not regulate customary transactions of land – olubodun v. Lawal (supra) where the SC held that the trial court erred in admitting such a document (a letter written by their ancestors tendered by the plaintiff) in evidence.\n\nCASE LAW\n\nThese are decisions of the courts and opinions expressed by jurists in respect of disputes over real property that may be brought by contending parties before and decided by the courts. Some of these courts exercise original jurisdiction in respect of certain subject matters of land. The jurisdiction of the High Court also covers land matters that are the subject of customary right of occupancy or those in non-urban areas – Adisa v. Oyinwola (2000) 10 NWLR (Pt. 674) p. 1349; Odetola v. Bamidele (2007) All FWLR (Pt. 387) p. 841.\n\nIn some States, appeals over land matters decided by the Area or Customary Courts may be dealt with on appeal by the High Court. However, customary arbitrations are accepted by higher courts as binding on the parties to the arbitration but decisions at customary arbitration is not considered as a means of proving title to land in Nigeria, although it may aid in establishing the traditional history of root of title base on the custom of the people – Nruama v. Ebuzoeme (2007) All FWLR p. 347 at 740.\n\nAppeals may lie from the decision of a lower court to a higher court. As a result of the common law principle of stare decisis, the judgment and opinions expressed by a superior court binds a lower court and the latter must follow such decision so long as the facts of the cases are similar.\n\nRECEIVED ENGLISH LAW\n\nThis is the law received from England comprising of the principles of common law, doctrines of equity and statutes of general application. These principles apply to regulate property practice in Nigeria, particularly over disputes that are tried before the High Courts and other superior courts. The statutes of general application are those enactments of the English parliament that were in existence in England as at January 1, 1900 the day in which the protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria were proclaimed e.g. Statute of fraud of fraud 1677, Conveyancing Act of 1881, and the Wills Act of 1837.\n\nThe English law applies to property transactions in Nigeria where there is no comparable local legislation or customary law that applies to such a transaction – Ude v. Nwara (1993) 2 NWLR (Pt. 278) p. 647.\n\nNIGERIAN LEGISLATION\n\nThe various laws that have direct impact on property transactions that are intended to be discussed in the module are:\n\n• The 1999 Constitution – The constitution affects property as regards to section 43 which provides for the right of every citizen to acquire and own immovable property anywhere in Nigeria. Section 44(1) also went further to enact the Common law principle that leans against the taking away of proprietary vested rights without specific legal authority and the provision of compensation. Section 44(2)(c)(d) went further to state that the power of compulsory acquisition does not affect any general law relating to leases, tenancies, mortgages, charges, bills of sale or any other rights or obligations arising out of contracts; or relating to vesting and administration of property of persons adjudged or otherwise declared bankrupt nor insolvent, of persons of unsound mind or deceased persons, and of corporate or unincorporated bodies in the course of being wound-up. Finally, section 315(5)(d) of the Constitution provides for the sanctity of the Land Use Act.\n\n• Land Use Act 1978 – An Act to Vest all Land compromised in the territory of each State (except land vested in the Federal government or its agencies) solely in the Governor of the State, who would hold such Land in trust for the people and would henceforth be responsible for allocation of land in all urban areas to individuals resident in the State and to organisations for residential, agriculture, commercial and other purposes while similar powers will with respect to non urban areas are conferred on Local Governments. Section 1 provides that the Governor of each state shall hold the land comprised in such State upon Trust and administer same for the use and common benefit of all Nigerians – Abioye v. Yakubu (1991) 5 NWLR (pt. 190) p. 130. What private individuals have on the land is a right of occupancy – Kachalla v. Banki (2006) All FWLR (Pt. 309) p. 1420. This is the greatest and highest legal interest a holder can have – Section 5(1); Ezennah v. Attah (2004) All FWLR (Pt. 202) p. 1858 at 1884. Section 4 preserves the application of the State Land Law except that they will continue to have effect with such modifications as would bring those Laws into conformity with the Act or its general intendment. Section 49 precludes the courts from questioning the Governor’s power to grant right of occupancy. Section 26 renders void any alienation of interest in land without consent.\n\n• Property and Conveyancing Law (PCL) 1959 – This is enacted by Western region of Nigeria commonly referred to as PCL. The most important features of this law is that no sale of land shall be enforced except there is a note of memorandum in writing containing the terms of the sale and signed by the person to be charged – Section 67(1) of PCL; all conveyances of land or interests in land for the purposes of creating any legal estate are void unless they are made by deed – Section 77(1) and 78(1) of PCL; where a person executes a deed, he shall either sign or place his mark on it and sealing alone is not sufficient – Section 97(1) of PCL; and the right to create leases are safeguarded so long as certain elements exist in it – Section 79(2) of PCL.\n\n• Conveyancing Acts (1881, 1882) – These are English Statute of General Application applicable to States of the old Eastern and Northern Nigeria and a part of Lagos. These statutes have been repealed and modernized in England and there is no justification for their being retained in our statute books in Nigeria – Ihekwoaba v. ACB and Ors (1998) 10 NWLR (Pt. 571) 590 at 626. However, States are advised to stop applying these English Statutes of General Application. In the case of Caribbean Trading Fidelity Corporation v. NNPC (2002) 14 NWLR (Pt. 786) page 133, Niki Tobi JCA (as he then was) held that “English is English, Nigeria is Nigeria… theirs are theirs, ours are ours… We cannot therefore continue to ‘enjoy this borrowing spree’ or merry frolic’ at the detriment of our legal system… After all, we are no more in slavery”.\n\n• Stamp Duties Act/Law 2004 – There is a Stamp Duty Act for every State and FCT which provides for the procedure for stamping of documents. Duty on land within the control of the State is paid to State Internal Revenue Service. Stamping of documents should be within 30 days of the execution of the document though it may be stamped out of time, which will attract penalty.\n\n• Illiterate Protection Laws (IPL) 1994 – This is a law made to protect illiterate persons involved in transactions generally. “It is like a very wide umbrella and covers all forms of writing or document written at the request of an illiterate person” – Lawal v. Ollivant (1972) 3 SC 124. Any person who shall write any letter or document, at the request on behalf or in the name of an illiterate person shall also write on such letter or other document his own name as the writer and his address – Section 2 of the IPL. The importance of these protection is for the benefit of the illiterate person – Fatumbi v. Olanloye (2004) All FWLR (Pt. 225) p. 150. Further, where the illiterate person is to sign or to make a mark, the document must be read over and explained to him. The object of this law is to protect an illiterate person from possible fraud\n\n• Land Instrument Registration Laws (Lagos) – These laws require that the preparation of instruments and documents on sale or transfer of land can only be done by a Legal Practitioner\n\n• Registration of Titles Law 2004 – This is under Cap. R4, Laws of Lagos State which requires titles to land to be registered as first or subsequent registrations. The principal purpose of this law is for the State to guarantee titles that have been investigated and registered by the Registrar of titles so that purchasers of land can rely on it in determining if the vendor has title to sell the property and the encumbrances that attach to the land.\n\n• Wills Act (Amendment) Act, 1852 – This has been replaced in most states by the Wills Laws.\n\n• Wills Laws of States (Lagos, Oyo, Abia, Kaduna, Jigawa) – The major aim of this law is that freedom to make Wills and dispose of estate by every person is guaranteed; the right of testation is sometimes restricted by imposing limitations on the maker of the Will in respect of the disposition of his estate; there are requirement for the validity of a Will; witnesses are required for making and revoking Wills; and there are provisions to ensure that a Will does not lapse as a result of the death of the beneficiaries.\n\n• Administration of Estates Laws of States – This law regulates the administration of the estate of a deceased person who dies intestate or testate. The law substitutes local provision on intestate succession with English law on intestate.\n\n• Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) – The Act permits registered companies under the Act to mortgage their properties by the creation of debentures over the assets of the company. Section 166 of the Act states that a company may borrow money for the purpose of its business or objects and many mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital and issue debentures, debenture stocks and other securities for any debt, liability or obligation of the company. ‘Property’ in the section includes land or any interest in land which the company has.\n\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nThe various transactions that are affecting property are:\n\n• Pledge of land – This exist where a person referred to generally as the ‘Pledgor’ gives or deposits any land or interest in land to another party, referred to as the ‘Pledgee” in which the person depositing the property binds himself to do or forbear from doing a particular thing. In this case, only possession is given as the title or the legal interest in the land is not transferred. In a pledge, land is usually put as a security to get something from the Pledgee. In an action to prove a pledge of land before a court, it is generally accepted that the person alleging pledge must establish (a) the pledge itself; (b) the parties to the pledge; (c) the witnesses, time and circumstances of the pledge; and (d) the consideration for the pledge – Anyaegbunam v. Osaka (2000) FWLR (pt. 27) p. 1942. The right of the Pledgor to recover possession of the land remains with him and is never extinguished hence the cliché: “once a pledge, always a pledge”. Finally, in a pledge, the land is redeemable however how long it might have been in possession of the Pledgee – Akuchie v. Nwamadi (1992) 8 NWLR (Pt. 258) p. 214 at 226.\n\n• Gift of land – This in property practice is the voluntary transfer or conveyance of any interest in land made gratuitously to a recipient and without any consideration paid by the recipient. The essential quality of a gift is that it lacks the element of bargain based on quid pro quo by which a sale is characterized – Dung v. Chollom (2003) FWLR (Pt. 220) p. 738 at 745. There are certain conditions which must exist to make a gift valid (a) intention of the donor to make the gift; (b) completed act of delivery to the recipient; and (c) acceptance of the gift by the beneficiary (recipient) – Achodo v. Akagha (2003) FWLR (Pt. 186) p. 612. Once a gift of land has been made and accepted, the grantor’s right over the land is destroyed and he cannot lay claim to it thereafter – Anyaegbum v. Osaka (supra) where the SC held that the donor has no right to revoke the gift once it has been accepted. However, where it is subject to forfeiture, it amounts to a tenancy not a gift.\n\n• Sale of land – A contract of sale of land is an agreement whereby the vendor promises to sell and the purchaser to buy the land in question. It is a binding agreement that the courts will enforce if necessary. The most important significance of this agreement is that it allows the purchaser ample time to investigate the title of the vendor.\n\n• Leases or leasehold – This is a written agreement under which a property owner (landlord) allows another (tenant) to use the property for a specified period of time and rent and known as a Landlord/Tenant relationship. A tenancy is a lease under 3 years while a lease is one above 3 years.\n\n• License – Permission to engage in a certain activity, granted by the appropriate authority.\n\n• Mortgage and Charge of land – This is generally the conveyance of a legal or equitable interest in a property with a provision for redemption, that is, the conveyance shall become void or the interest shall be re-conveyed upon the repayment of the loan – Per Amaizu JCA, in B.O.N Ltd v. Akintoye (1999) 12 NWLR (Pt. 392) p. 403. The borrower is called the mortgagor or charger while the lender is the mortgagee or charge. The lender may sell the security to realize the money advanced where the borrower fails to repay.\n\n• Donation of power – This is an agency relationship by which a person gives power to another so that the agent acts on behalf of the principal in respect of specific transactions affecting land, such as to let out premises and collect rent, or to sell property and execute the document of sale.\n\nADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES LAW\n\nThis law regulates the administration of the estate of a deceased person who dies intestate or testate. The law substitutes local provision on intestate succession with English law on intestate.\n\nETHICAL ISSUES\n\n1) Dealing with Client’s property – Section 23(1) of the LPA provides that a lawyer shall not do any act whereby for his personal benefit or gain he abuses or takes advantage of the confidence reposed in him by his client.\n\nSection 23(2) of the LPA provides that where a lawyer collects money for his client, he shall prompt report, and account for it, and shall not mix such money or property with, or use it as his own.\n\n2) Seal and Stamp – Section 10(1) provides that a lawyer acting in his capacity as a legal practitioner, legal officer or adviser of any Governmental department or Ministry or any corporation, shall not sign or file a legal document unless there is affixed on such document a seal and stamp approved by the NBA.\n\nSection 10(2) provides that for the purpose of this rule, “legal documents” shall include pleadings, affidavits, depositions, applications, instruments, agreements, deeds, letters, memoranda, reports, legal opinions or any similar documents.\n\nSection 10(3) provides that if, without complying with the requirements of this rule, a lawyer signs or files any legal documents as defined in sub-rule (2), and in any of the capacities mentioned in sub-rule (1), the document so signed or filed shall be deemed not to have been properly signed or filed.\n\n3) A legal practitioner has to advise his client appropriately to the applicable laws to a given situation.\n\n4) To prepare a document having regard to the applicable law to that document\n\n5) Throughout his representation of his client, a solicitor should observe and apply the relevant law to a particular situation\n\n6) Carefully make use of precedents and not to wholly adopt their contents to the document under draft.\n\nWEEK 4 DOCUMENTS OF TRANSFER 1 (DEEDS)\n\n• Generally speaking, a deed is a document which passes interest in property or which binds a person to perform or abstain from doing some action.\n\n• A duly executed deed of conveyance is sufficient evidence to support an award of title to a land to the beneficiary in the deed of conveyance.\n\n• There are two types of deeds: INDENTURE, which binds 2 or more persons, example mortgage and DEED POLL, granted by one person only, example power of attorney\n\n• Deed is binding on the maker of even though the parts have not been exchanged, as long as it has been delivered AWOJUGBAGBE LIGHT INDUSTRIES V. CHINUKWE\n\nFEATURES OF A DEED\n\n• SIGNING unless a deed is signed, it is inadmissible in evidence and is not binding on the maker of the document\n\nSection 91(4) and section 100 Evidence Act, section 97(1) PCL\n\n• Where any party to the deed is illiterate, an illiterate jurat should be inserted in the deed. (section 3 Illiterates Protection Act, EZEIGWE V. AWUDU)\n\n• A deed executed by a corporation shall have its seal affixed to it in the presence of and attested by its secretary and a member of the board of directors (section 131 Evidence Act)\n\n• SEALING is no longer a mandatory requirement for the essential and formal validity of a deed, this ancient requirement of a deed is becoming less essential to the validity of a deed. While sealing is advised on deeds, NO SEAL WILL NOT VITIATE THE DEED\n\n• The deed is presumed to be valid provided there is the intention to affix a seal, and this intention may be inferred from the act of signing and attesting the deed or the circle with the letters (L.S.) or these letters alone without the circle.\n\n• A deed signed and delivered enjoys a presumption of sealing and its absence does not invalidate the deed. (section 127 Evidence Act, section 80 Registration of Titles Law and FIRST NATIONAL SECURITIES LIMITED V. JONES)\n\n• NOTE THE PRINCIPLE OF PRESUMPTION OF SEALING DOES NOT APPLY TO DOCUMENTS EXCUTED BY COMPANIES. FOR A DEED TO BE VALIDLY EXECUTED, IT MUST BE SEALED WITH THE COMPANY’S SEAL IN THE PRESENCE OF A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR AND A SECRETARY.\n\n• DELIVERY means intention to be bound. To constitute delivery the deed must be placed in the hands of the grantee or within his control, with the intention that it becomes operative as a conveyance. AWOJUGBAGBE LIGHT INDUSTRIES V. CHINUKWE\n\n• Delivery may be absolute or conditional. An ABSOLUTE DELIVERY is one which is complete after the actual transfer of the instrument from the possession of the grantor. A CONDITIONAL DELIVERY (DELIVERY IN ESCROW) is not complete until the happening of a specified event or fulfillment of a condition.\n\n• An escrow is an instrument delivered to take effect on the happening of a specified event or upon the condition that it is not to be operative until some condition is performed. A DEED IN ESCROW CANNOT BE RECALLED UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE TIME WHEN THE CONDITION IS TO BE FULFILLED.\n\n• The effective date of delivery of deed in escrow is not the date the condition was performed but relates back to the date the deed was delivered as an escrow. The Doctrine of Relation Back, the legal consequence of the doctrine is that it invalidates dealing by the vendor with the property during the period for which the deed is an escrow. ALAN ESTATES LTD. V. W.G. STORES LTD\n\n• ATTESTATION means witnessing of the deed. A deed is valid whether or not it is attested. But it is essential that documents should be attested to show that it was duly executed.\n\n• Every instrument including a deed executed by an illiterate must be executed in the presence of a magistrate or justice of the peace (section 8(1) Land Registration Act)\n\n• CONSENT OF THE GOVERNOR is required for any deed which relates to any transfer of legal interest in land (section 22 of the Land Use Act)\n\n• Engrossment of a deed is the making of counterparts of the original deed. It is not an essential requirement for the validity of a deed.\n\nWHEN A DEED IS REQUIRED FOR PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS\n\n• Transactions lacking in consideration\n\n• Conveyance of interest in land, EXCEPT WHERE THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES OF A TESTATOR BY AN ASSENT VEST TITLE IN LAND TO A BENEFICIARY SECTION 77(1) PCL\n\n• Where an attorney is appointed to execute a deed\n\n• Vesting Declarations\n\n• Voluntary surrenders\n\n• A lease for a term exceeding 3 years\n\n• Where a deed is required to rectified, even though proceedings for rectification can be commenced\n\nPROPERTY TRANSACTIONS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE DEEDS\n\n• Section 77(2) PCL provides for most instances when property transaction are not required to be by deed\n\n• Assents\n\n• Surrenders by operation of law (implied surrenders need not be in writing to take effect)\n\n• A lease or tenancy for less than 3 years\n\n• Receipts not required by law to be under seal, example a receipt endorsed on a mortgage serves as sufficient discharge of the mortgage\n\n• Vesting orders\n\n• Conveyances taking effect by operation of law\n\n• Disclaimers\n\n• Transaction covered by the rule in WALSH V. LONSDALE. The rule is that an instrument which is void as a conveyance because it is not a deed may still operate in equity as an agreement for a conveyance.\n\nFORMAL PARTS OF A DEED OF CONVEYANCE\n\n1.

ROCKONOH PPTIES LTD a recital was defined as a formal part of a deed or writing which explains the reasons for the transaction. There are two types of recitals. Narrative/Historical and Introductory\n\n• The courts make use of recitals when interpreting deeds in order to clear any ambiguity in a deed or document.\n\n• Section 130 Evidence Act provides that recitals contained in documents that are twenty years old or more at the date of the contract are presumed sufficient evidence of the truth of facts stated in them except proved otherwise.\n\n• Recitals constitutes estoppels against the party making the statement in favour of 3rd party who are innocent and have become owners for value (including their successors) where it is clear and unambiguous.

UDE V. NWARA\n\n• It mirrors an agency relationship but it is sui generis (of its own kind). It differs from other agencies because its main aim is to satisfy 3rd parties that the agent has the authority of the donor to deal in a subject matter, rather than regulating only the relationship between the principal and the agent.\n\n• Not necessarily, but generally a registrable instrument.\n\n• It specifically states the powers exercisable by the donee and in the construction of a Power of Attorney; the Court relies strictly on the provisions of the Power of Attorney.\n\n• It is usually in writing but not necessarily by deed.\n\n• It could be for valuable consideration or coupled with interest, and could also be for a fixed period of time., not exceeding 12 months.\n\n• It is usually executed as a deed poll\n\nIMPORTANT POINTS:\n\n• WHERE AN ATTORNEY ACTS OUTSIDE HIS AUTHORITY, THE DONOR WILL NOT BE MADE LIABLE. IDOWU V. ABAYOMI\n\n• THE DONOR CANNOT APPOINT SOMEBODY TO DO WHAT HE CAN’T LAWFULLY DO. THE APPOINTMENT OF A DONEE CAN’T BE USED TO CURE THE DISABILITY SUFFERED BY THE DONOR.\n\n• THE DONOR AND THE DONEE MUST BE JURISTIC PERSONS – NATIONAL BANK OF NIGERIA LTD. V. KORBAN BROTHERS (NIG.) LTD. & ORS\n\n• WHERE THE DONEE IS TO EXECUTE A DEED ON BEHALF OF THE DONOR, THEN HIS APPOINTMENT MUST BE BY DEED. ABINA V. FARHAT\n\nTYPES OF POA\n\n• REVOCABLE POA is one that can be revoked at any time and for any reason, so long as the donee has not exercised the power.\n\n• IRREVOCABLE is one that is coupled with interest. A POA could be for a fixed period of time, not more than 12 months (whether or not coupled with interest) within which period the POA cannot be revoked – section 144(1) PCL\n\nREVOCATION OF POA\n\n• A Donor of a POA can revoke the powers conferred on the Donee if he chooses to, where the Donee has not yet exercised the power. CHIME v. CHIME (or where the POA is not coupled with interest). This is called Express Revocation.\n\n• Implied Revocation occurs where the Donor makes it impossible for the power to be realized so much so that the powers given become extinguished.\n\n• Revocation by operation of law occurs where the Donor becomes bankrupt or of unsound mind or dies. The exception to this is that where the power is coupled with interest or it is fixed for a period, these factors will not affect the power\n\nWHEN A POA IS IRREVOCABLE\n\n• WHERE THE POWER IS GIVEN FOR VALUE OR IS GIVEN AS SECURITY AND EXPRESSED TO BE IRREVOCABLE, THE POWER CANNOT BE REVOKED UNTIL THE BENFIT FOR WHICH IT WAS CONFERRED HAS BEEN REPAID – BASHIR LABADEDI V. ODULANA & ORS.\n\n• WHERE THE POWER IS EXPRESSED TO BE FOR A FIXED PERIOD (WHETHER GIVEN FOR VALUABLE CONSIDERATION OR NOT) NOT EXCEEDING A YEAT 143(1); 144 PCL.\n\nDIFF BETWEEN POA AND CONTRACT OF SALE (COS)\n\n• POA is an instrument of delegation and not an instrument of alienation. COS it s document affecting land which creates an equitable interest in a landed property in favour of the purchaser\n\n• POA does not transfer interest in land as between the donor and the donee. COS creates and transfers an equitable interest in land to the purchaser.\n\n• POA is usually executed as deed poll (executed by one party only). COS is usually executed by both parties.\n\n• Consideration not mandatory with POAs. COSs require consideration\n\nDIFF BETWEEN POA AND CONVEYANCE\n\n• POA is an instrument of delegation only (No transfer of interest). CONV is an instrument of alienation of interest in land.\n\n• POA may not require Governor’s consent. CONV requires Governor’s consent.\n\n• Deed poll generally, POA. CONV is an indenture\n\n• POA is not always made by deed. CONV is always made by deed.\n\nCIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING / IMPORTANCE POA\n\n• UNAVAILABILITY OF THE DONOR as a result of being physically away from the properties being sought to be dealt with or being engaged otherwise.\n\n• ILL HEALTH /SOME OTHER PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT making it difficult for the Donor to handle his affairs in respect of the properties.\n\n• WHERE THE EXPERT SKILLS OF THE DONEE are required such as where a Donor donates to an Estate Agent or Solicitor the responsibilities to put tenants in possession, collect rent, revise rent, sue for rent etc.\n\nFACTORS WHICH MAKE A POWER OF ATTORNEY VALID\n\n• WRITING: The requirement for attestation and registration can only be completed on a written POA (section 118 Evidence Act)\n\n• To clearly state the exact powers donated (clears ambiguity)\n\n• Where it is required to be sealed, then the existence of a written document on which the seal is to be affixed to.\n\n• The law requires POAs to be stamped.\n\n• EXECUTION: The Donee should execute the deed or doc in the name of the Donor, but he may execute it in his own name.\n\n• Where the donor is illiterate, the POA MUST comply with the provisions of the section 3, Illiterate Protection Law. EZEIGWE V. AWUDU.\n\n• SEAL OF POA: where the donee is to execute a deed on behalf of the donor, then the appointment itself (POA) must be deed that is under seal.\n\n• ATTESTATION: Important is proving validity of the document in the event that it is challenged.\n\n• Section 118 Evidence Act, makes for presumption o f due execution of POA, every document purporting to be a POA and to have been executed before and authenticated by a Notary Public or any Court, Judge, Magistrate is presumed to be so executed and authenticated. It spares the parties of proving authenticity.\n\n• REGISTRATION: Some states require registration and except where it is registered, it shall not be pleaded or given in evidence.

Section 7(b)(iii) Lagos State land Law.\n\n• A POA must be stamped within 40 days from the day of its execution and it attracts a fixed stamp duty.\n\nETHICAL ISSUES\n\n1. A SOLICITOR ACTING FOR A PURCHASER, RELYING ON A POA SHOULD INVESTIGATE TO ENSURE THAT THE POWER HAS NOT BEEN REVOKED BY THE DEATH, DISABILITY, AND BANKRUPTCY OF THE DONOR TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DONEE.\n\n2. A SOLICITOR DRAFTING A POA SHOULD ENSURE THAT SPECIFIC POWERS ARE EXPRESSLY STATED WITHOUT AMBIGUITY SINCE SUCH POWERS ARE CONSTRUED STRICTLY\n\n3. A SOLICITOR HAS A DUTY TO FOLLOW HIS CLIENT’S INSTRUCTIONS LAWFULLY. HE WILL BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS WHICH MAY ENSUE AS A RESULT OF DISOBEYING THEM\n\n4. A LAWYER SHOULD NOT MISAPPROPRIATE HIS CLIENT’S MONEY OR PROPERTY WHERE HE IS APPOINTED A DONEE RULE 23 (2) RPC 2007. CLIENT’S MONEY SHOULD BE PAID INTO CLIENT ACCOUNT.\n\n5.

The section attempts to contrast the fact of registration under the RTL and registration under the land instrument registration laws of the various States of Nigeria.\n\n• The entries in the register are conclusive proof of title and an epitome or abstract of title is not required to deduce title of the vender (section 35). Property practice under the registration of titles system does not require the production of an epitome or abstract of title by a vendor to prove his ownership of land unlike under the system of registration of instruments.\n\n• Property practice is conducted mostly through the use of forms under the titles system unlike the registration of instruments system which requires contracts and deeds. The law sets out altogether 18 forms in the schedule for use in respect of specific transactions.\n\n• The registry under the registration of titles system is a private one unlike the deeds registry.\n\n• Under registration of title, a purchaser investigating title must obtain a letter from the proprietor of the title or a sworn declaration from the court that he has the consent and authority of the proprietor to conduct a search, under the system of registration of instruments, no such authorization Is required.\n\n• Under the registration of titles system a registered proprietor is issued a Certificate of Title. The certificate names the owner of the title and he may use the certificate in any manner he deems fit. Under registration of instruments, it is registered title deeds that are issued to an owner of land that has been duly registered.\n\n• Title acquired under registration of title system is more reliable and indefeasible than title acquired under deeds. In the deeds systems, the State does not guarantee the title of the owner and it is registered subject to all defects in it but under the titles systems, the registrar investigates title before registration and moves a guarantee on them.\n\nPROCEDURE FOR INVESTIGATING TITLE\n\nWhen investigating title in the register a solicitor should approach the register of title with the following documents:\n\n• Letter of consent or authority from the proprietor to the purchaser authorizing or permitting him to conduct a search on the title. The reason for this is that the registry is a private registry not opened to the public. There must hence be authority given to an ‘outsider’ to have access to the registry.\n\n• A declaration in court by the purchaser to the effect that the proprietor of the title actually granted the permission to conduct searches of the register. This is a requirement imposed in practice to prevent fraud by those who may claim that they have consent of the proprietor when in fact they do not.\n\n• Photocopy of the land Certificate to be attached to the letter seeking for permission to conduct the search.\n\n• In conducting the search, the solicitor should pay attention to the three parts of the register, the PROPRIETORSHIP REGISTER (to determine the owner of the title); the PROPERTY REGISTER (to know the details of the property), and the CHARGES REGISTER (to identify any incumbrances created over the property) Because entries in the register are conclusive proof of the several matters contained in it, the solicitor should carefully search and deduce the items contained in the register..\n\nTHE PROCEDURE FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe procedure for registering assignments, transfers, leases, subleases or other documents conferring title under the RTL is as follows:\n\n• Applicant must obtain Governor’s consent\n\n• Document must have been stamped\n\n• The original Land Certificate must be attached to the document and endorsed at the investigation section of the registry.\n\n• Notices are issued to the parties to the transaction and the registered owner of any interest on the property.\n\n• These notices are posted by registered mail (this can be done through the internet to reduce the 14 days period of grace.)\n\n• After 14 days (in the absence of objection to the registration), a draft entry is prepared and approved by either the Deputy Registrar or the Registrar of Titles.\n\n• A new Land Certificate is typed reflecting the new transaction and this is sent to the plan section where final indexing and description of the property is reflected.\n\n• The new Land Certificate is collated and sent for signature by the Deputy Registrar of Titles and the Registrar of Titles.\n\n• The applicant collects the new Land Certificate.\n\n• The registration fee is 3% of the Capital Value. The duration for the registration is usually 21 dyas and where it is via the Internet, it is 5 days.\n\nFORMS FOR TRANSFER OF INTEREST UNDER REGISTRATION OF LAW (FORMS 4, 5, 6, 7, AND 15)\n\nFORM 4: LEASE\n\nA property registered under the law may also be let out by the proprietor of the title to a lessee for a term of years in consideration of payment of rent. In the event of such a transaction, the parties may employ Form 4 to encapsulate the terms of that lease. In completing the form, the names of the lessor and the lessee are inserted, the term of the lease and rent also.\n\nFORM 5: CHARGE AND SUB-CHARGE\n\nA proprietor of registered title may use his interest in the property to create a mortgage on it by way of a charge on the property. Where a charge is created, a subsequent charge may be created by way of a sub-charge of the property. In such event, Form 5 may be employed to create the charge or sub-charge. Some of the facts to be included in the form are: names of the chargor and charge, the amount advance, the interest accruable and a statement of application to be registered as the owner of the charge.\n\nFORM 6: RELEASE OF CHARGE\n\nFORM 7: TRANSFER\n\nA proprietor of registered land may also transfer his interest by way of sale of the property for consideration.\n\nFORM 15: NOTICE OF MORTGAGE BY DEPOSIT\n\nIn completing Form 15 only the mortgagee completes the form and signs. He is also requested to state the amount advanced to the mortgagor and also the interest on the charge.\n\nASSENTS\n\n• In States of the former Western Region of Nigeria and Lagos State, assent is an important document in vesting property of a deceased person in a beneficiary. RENNER V. RENNER\n\n• An assent is usually made in favour of a person who is entitled to the deceased’s real estate either by device, bequest, devolution or appropriation.\n\n• The effect of the assent is to activate the gift in the will.\n\n• In States of the Former Northern and Eastern regions, a formal assent is NOT required and the beneficiary takes his gift from the will.\n\n• In practice, a written assent is made under seal, though an assent need not be under seal. Where it is made by deed, it is not a registrable instrument and no stamp duties are paid.\n\nESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF AN ASSENT\n\n• MUST BE IN WRITING, this is a statutory requirement. Administration of Estate Law, Cap A3 Laws of Lagos State.\n\n• This helps to clear ambiguities and an assent which is regarded as a conveyance may be used as a document of title.\n\n• MUST BE SIGNED BY THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE, this signifies the vesting of the property in the beneficiary by the P.R. of the deceased since the benefactor is no longer alive.\n\n• MUST NAME THE PERSON IN WHOSE FAVOUR IT IS MADE, the beneficiary should be the person who is entitled to the property under the will.\n\nFORMAL PARTS OF ASSENT\n\n• COMMENCEMENT\n\n• PARTIES CLAUSE\n\n• VESTING CLAUSE\n\n• DECLARATION CLAUSE\n\n• ACKNOWLEDGEMENT CLAUSE\n\n• TESTIMONIUM\n\nDRAFTING AN ASSENT\n\nWE, AB of __________ and CD of ________________________ [address and descriptions as in probate] the personal representatives of UV (deceased) of [address and descriptions as in probate] who died on ____________ [date of death] and whose Will was proved by us on the ______________ [date of probate] in the Probate Registry of _________________________ [State probate was granted].\n\nDO hereby as personal representatives, on this ___________ day of _________20 ___ [date assent is made].\n\nVesting/Assent clause\n\n1.

PETER ADEBAYO in the presence of:\n\n[signature of witness followed by address and description].\n\nPROPERTY LAW PRACTICE – WEEK 7\n\nLEASE\n\nA lease is a document that creates an interest in a property or land for a fixed term of years usually (but not necessarily) in consideration of the payment of rent. The interest created is called a term of years, but it is also often referred to as a lease or a leasehold interest. Leases are used to describe long term grants.\n\nIn a lease, the consideration flowing from the lessor (landlord) to the lessee (tenant) is the demised premises. The consideration paid by the lessee is the rent and the observance of any condition or covenant in the lease.\n\nIt should however be noted that title to the land is not conveyed, only the use and occupation of the property is given out; the property reverts back to the lessor after the expiration of the term. The owner of the property who makes the grant is the lessor or landlord/landlady, whilst the person who takes over the exclusive use of the demise is the lessee or tenant.\n\nThe difference between a lease and a tenancy is that while the former last for a long term, the latter is for a short term.\n\nPARTIES TO A LEASE\n\nThis refers to the capacity of parties. They must be natural or juristic persons having the capability to sue or be sued.\n\nCapacity is always a key issue. A holder of a right of occupancy can create a term of years subject to conditions in the Land Use Act. Any term created under the right of occupancy is a sub-lease.\n\nAt common law, a lease created by an infant is voidable and may be avoided by the infant within a reasonable time after attaining majority. An infant may take a lease but is entitled to repudiate it on attaining majority – section 14 Edict No 4 Rivers State 1988; and section 18 Edict No. 17 Kaduna State 1990. An infant cannot create a tenancy in respect of residential premises but the parent or guardian or the High Court upon application may do so on his behalf.\n\nA registered company under CAMA may create or take a lease as authorised by its memorandum and Articles of Association.\n\nParties are to be identified by their full names, addresses and occupation. In the case of a limited liability company, it is usual to say “registered under CAMA” and then state its registered office. In the case of a natural person, you may want a reference on him from his employer or former landlord to determine if he can pay rent.\n\nA single lady letting the premises may be asked to produce a surety who will also stand as a guarantor in case of default of payment of rent. It should however be noted that a surety will be equally liable for the payment of rent. If a company, the guarantors may be the directors.\n\nThe parties to a lease can either be called a landlord/tenant; lessor/lessee and where the lessor is a lady, a landlady. You may wish to extend the meaning of the definition. But there are provisions of the law that make it unnecessary to extend the definition of the parties to include successors-in-title – section 102 and 103 PCL, and section 58 and 59 Conveyancing Act 1881. Successors-in-title can also enforce covenants in the document.\n\nTYPES OF A LEASE\n\n1. Periodic tenancy – This is created for a term renewable at the end of the term by payment of rent by the tenant and reception of rent by the landlord.\n\n2. Tenant for a fixed period – This is created to last for a fixed term and to expire at the end of such fixed term. This type of lease is not renewable.\n\n3. Lease of reversion – This is created to run concurrently with an existing lease. Lessee of reversion does not take possession unless the existing lease is brought to an end; he merely steps into the shoes of the lessor in relation to the current lease.\n\n4. Lease in reversion – This is created to take effect at the expiration of a current lease.\n\n5. Tenancy at will – This is created where the tenant holds over at the end of a current term with the consent of the lessor for an undefined term subject to termination by either of the parties.\n\n6. Tenancy at sufferance – This is created where the tenant holds over without the consent of the lessor.\n\n7. Tenancy at estoppels – This is created where tenancy is made by a grantor who has no good title.\n\n8. Statutory tenancy – This is created where a tenant’s term has expired but protected from summary eviction by the provisions of the relevant recovery of premises law.\n\nMODE OF CREATION OF LEASES\n\nThis can be done through any of the following:\n\n1) Parol/Oral lease – This is an agreement of mere words. Under section 4 of Statute of Fraud of 1677; sections 78 and 79 of the PCL, it is permissible as having of a lease at will. It must however have the following elements in order for it to be valid –\n\na) it must reserve the best rent obtainable (not premium or rack rent);\n\nb) it must be for a period not exceeding three (3) years; and\n\nc) possession must be given to the lessee – Foster v. Reeves (1892) 2 QB 255 at 257; Okoye v. Nwulu (2001) All FWLR (Pt. 350) 214.\n\nWhile parol/oral leases are permissible, they usually present difficulties in proving the essential terms agreed to by the parties; for “a party alleging an oral agreement is duty bound to prove such an agreement to the hilt – Odutola v. Papersack (Nig.) Ltd. (2007) All FWLR (Pt. 350) 1214.\n\n2) Written lease – This is a mere agreement in writing, and applicable to leases not exceeding three years. It is signed by the parties to it only, and binding on them as a contract and it is enforceable. In Odutola v. Papersack (Nig.) Ltd (supra), Niki Tobi JSC, observed that “it is generally accepted practice that tenancy agreement is made in writing; but I can say that it is mostly made in writing.” The advantage of a lease in writing over oral lease is that a lease in writing are easily ascertainable and enforceable.\n\n3) Lease by Deed or under seal – It is mandatory and not conditional for a lease above three (3) years to be by deed. And it must be Signed, Sealed and Delivered. Under section 3 of Statute Fraud Act of 1677; and section 77(1) of PCL, a lease which is required to be in writing is void for the purpose of conveying or creating a legal estate unless made by deed. In Anwasi v. Chabasaya (2000) 6 NWLR (Pt. 661) 408, the Court held that a contract under seal is a written document which is required to be signed as well as sealed by the party bound thereby and delivered by him, to or for the benefit of the person to whom the liability is incurred. However, by the rule in the old case of Walsh v. Lonsdale (1882) 21 Ch. D 9, an agreement to create a lease (with all the essential elements) will still operate as a lease, notwithstanding that it is not created under seal. This is based on the maxim that “equity looks at the intention of the parties and not the form” and “equity regards as done that which ought to be done.”\n\nESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A LEASE\n\nIn Odutola v. Papersack (Nig.) Ltd (supra), Niki Tobi JSC, stated thus:\n\n“…[For] a lease to be valid and enforceable, [it] must contain the following – the parties concerned, the property involved, the term of years, the rent payable, the commencement date, the terms as to covenants, and the mode of its determination.”\n\nFrom the above, essential element of a valid lease are:\n\n1. The parties concerned;\n\n2. The property involved;\n\n3. The term of years;\n\n4. The rent payable;\n\n5. Date of commencement;\n\n6. The terms as to covenant; and\n\n7. The mode of its determination.\n\nThe above elements are important for a valid lease which shall be discussed briefly:\n\n1. The parties concerned – Parties must be juristic persons (that is, having the capacity to sue and be sued) and adequately prescribed. There must be a lessor who is capable of creating a lease and a lessee who is capable of taking the demise.\n\n2. The property involved – The property must be in existence at the commencement date otherwise, nothing is demised and the agreement is void. In other words, the property must be described and known by both parties.\n\n3. Terms of years – There must be definite time frame. A lease to be valid must be for a definite or fixed period with a fixed or ascertainable date of commencement. In terms of duration, it must have a certain beginning and a certain end e.g. weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly. The lease cannot enure in perpetuity – U. B. A v. Tejumola & Sons Ltd (1988) 2 NWLR (Pt. 79) 662; 5 SCNJ 173. In Lace v. Chantler (1944) KB 364 at 368, the court held that a lease for the duration of the war or until cessation of hostilities did not create a good leasehold interest as the term created was uncertain.\n\n4. The rent payable – The rent (amount) to be paid must be stated, known and agreed by both parties.\n\n5. Date of commencement – The lease must take effect from a specified date or upon the happening or occurrence of an ascertainable future event or contingency which is certain in time – U. B. A v. Tejumola & Sons Ltd (supra). In Okechukwu v. Onuorah (2000) 12 SCNJ 146; (2001) FWLR (Pt. 33) 219 and Bosah v. Oji (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt. 762) 137, the question arose on whether leases that had no commencement date, but which were said to commence on “the day the Onitsha Local Government Council issued to the lessees a certificate of occupancy in respect of the premises”, were valid commencement dates? The court answered to the affirmative and concluded that the commencement date which is deponent upon the occurrence of a future contingency (issuance of a certificate of occupancy) was valid and the lease became absolute and enforceable the moment the event in question occurred.\n\n6. The terms as to covenant – There must be exclusive possession. It is the essence of a lease that a tenant should be given the right to exclusive possession. That is, the right to exclude all other persons from the premises. Where exclusive possession is not confirmed, it is called a licence. Exclusive possession connotes occupation or physical control of land either personally or through an agent, proxy or servant. It also means exclusive power of using the right given in land, retain same and be entitled to undisputed enjoyment of it against all persons except the person who can establish a better title. If one does not have exclusive possession of the property, then what one has is not a lease but licence. Lessee must therefore have exclusive use and control of premises.\n\n7. The mode of its determination – There must be the cessation of an estate or interest.\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LEASE AND A LICENCE\n\n1) A lease has an estate in the demised premises whilst a licence has no estate but only a right to do a thing on the land.\n\n2) A lease can be assigned while a licence cannot be assigned.\n\n3) In a lease, a lessee can maintain action for trespass against anybody including the lessor while in a licence, a licensee can only sue others and not the licensor for trespass because he occupies the property at the pleasure of the licensor who may come upon the land at any moment he wishes.\n\n4) A lease is inheritable while a licence cannot be assigned.\n\n5) A lease cannot be revoked while a licence is revocable either expressly by the licensor or by the death of the parties or by assignment of the property.\n\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LEASE AND AN ASSIGNMENT\n\n1) A lease is granted for a period of term while in an assignment, the assignee receives the entirety of the assignor.\n\n2) In a lease, grantor has reversionary interest while in an assignment, there is no reversionary interest retained by grantor.\n\n3) In a lease, all covenants in the head lease (express and implied) bind parties to a lease while in an assignment only covenants that touch and concern the land in the head lease binds assignees (not express covenants as there is no privity of contract between head lessor and assignee.\n\n4) In a lease, it may not require deed depending on the duration and mode of creation while in an assignment, it always require a deed for legal title to be passed to the assignee.\n\nRENT\n\nThis is the consideration (compensation) paid by the tenant to the landlord for the term granted. Payment of rent is however not a strict requirement of a valid lease. For instance, a tenant at will does not pay rent yet he is a tenant. A main feature of a lease is lawful occupation by tenant whether a person pays regular rent, subsidized rent or no rent at all is immaterial – African Petroleum Ltd. v. Owodunni (1991) 8 NWLR (Pt. 210) 391 at 419.\n\nTYPES OF RENT\n\nIn practice, there are three kinds of rent payable in lease namely:\n\n1) Ground Rent – This is the rent paid by the holder of the grant (grantee) for the use of the ground, whether the land is developed or not is immaterial. – G. B Olliviant v. Alakija (1950) 13 WACA 63. This rent is paid annually and it is subject to periodic review. For example, rent paid to the Governor of a State (Government) upon the grant of a Right of Occupancy and subsequently every year – section 5(1) of the Land Use Act, 1978. The amount payable varies depending on where the land is situated or located, and the size of the land. It is usually a small amount and it is subject to a revision period of 5 years or more.\n\n2) Rack Rent – This is the most popular type of rent also called ‘economic rent’ because it is the landlord’s returns on his investment. This rent is paid by the lessee. It is the rent for the full value of the property or a value near it. The amount payable varies depending on the location of the property and quality of the property. It may be paid monthly, annually or for a fixed sum. Though, it normally fluctuates depending on the change of circumstances in market value.\n\n3) Premium – This is a lump sum which is paid as rent in addition to the other kinds of rent. For example, the holder of a Right of Occupancy pays both ground rent and premium to Givernment. It is also payable in a long lease.\n\nA premium is regarded as a fine, and prohibited in some States – Section 4 of the Rent and Control and Recovery of Residential Premises Law of 2003 (Lagos). Where a premium is prohibited, the landlord may charge rent in advance, if that is not also prohibited – section 6(1) of Rent and Recovery of Premises Edict No. 4 of 1997 (Plateau State) prohibits rent in advance. However, where payment of premium is required or allowed, it attracts stamp duties payment and it is charged as income tax.\n\nFACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED IN FIXING RENT PAYABLE IN A LEASE\n\n1. Tax implications – This can be found under section 3(3) of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), 2004. It provides that a landlord who collects rent in advance for a period exceeding five (5) years is liable to pay higher tax than when the rent is for five years or below. It is therefore advisable that landlords should not charge rent in advance exceeding five years. This is also made available in the provisions of section 4(2)(c) of the Income Tax Management Act (ITMA), 2004\n\n2. Inflation – Where a landlord collects many years rent in advance, it may turn out to be disadvantageous because inflation may make the rent collected virtually useless.\n\nAt common law, where a lease has expired but the lessor continues to accept rent, the lessor would be deemed to have renewed the lease on the same terms and rent as the expired lease. This is because, in law, possession of an estate by a lessee and the receipt of rent by the lessor is evidence of a tenancy – Okoye v. Nwulu (supra).\n\nRENT REVIEW CLAUSE\n\nIt is important to insert a rent review clause in a lease especially if the term of years granted is a long one. In the absence of such clause, and subsequent disagreement, the court may imply fair market or reasonable rent and this would always be a matter of evidence – Unilife Dev. Co. Ltd. v. Adeshigbin (2001) FWLR (PT 42) 114. The rent review clause is usually inserted in a lease to cushion the effect of inflation and keep to the money value realisable from the demised premises.\n\nThis allows the rent to be reviewed periodically.\n\nA rent-review clause should contain the following\n\na) Method of initiating the review. For example, a notice to be given by the lessor to the lessee in writing and the time within which the notice is to be given.\n\nb) The time frame for the review. For example, after every five (5) years of the lease and the date in which the new rent will become payable.\n\nc) The method of calculating the new rent. For example, whether a valuation by experts is required before the review.\n\nd) Procedure for resolving any dispute of the new rent. For example, by the use of arbitration clause or negotiation mechanism.\n\nIt should be noted that rent is not due until the expiration of the period created. In a monthly tenancy, the rent is due on the eve of the commencement of another periodic month – Re St. Andrews Allotment Association (1969) 1 All E.R. 147 at 151.\n\nRent is still payable even if the premises cannot be used. For example, due to destruction by fire. This is because the doctrine of frustration hardly applies to leases – E. O. Araka v. Monier Construction Co (Nig) Ltd (1978) 9/10 S.C. 9.\n\nFACTS AND CASES REFERRED TO IN ACTIVITIES 2 & 3 OF LESSON NOTE\n\nBOSAH v. OJI (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt. 762) 137\n\nThis is based on a question that arose on whether leases that had no commencement date, but which were said to commence on “the day the Onitsha Local Government Council issued to the lessees a certificate of occupancy in respect of the premises”, were valid commencement dates?\n\nThe court answered to the affirmative and concluded that the commencement date which is deponent upon the occurrence of a future contingency (issuance of a certificate of occupancy) was valid and the lease became absolute and enforceable the moment the event in question occurred.\n\nOKECHUKWU v. ONUORAH (2000) 12 SCNJ 146\n\nThis is based on the question whether the essentials of a lease existed (particularly the date of commencement).\n\nThe court affirmed the essentials of a lease and held further that in the instant case, the words of demise are clearly spelt out in Exhibit 1, which is giving on lease a plot of land to be developed by the defendants to a clear specification and on a completion, to have portions of the building for the plaintiff’s use absolutely without charge.\n\nU.B.A LTD. v. TEJUMOLA & SONS LTD. (1988) 2 NWLR (Pt. 79) 662\n\nThe question for determination in this case is whether it can be said on the evidence in this case that 1st May, 1982, the day said by the Plaintiff to be the commencement of the proposed lease, which no doubt is an essential term of an agreement for the lease, has been agreed to by the parties to this case.\n\nThe Court of Appeal, the lower court, agreed with the learned trial Judge as to 1st May, 1982 being the day of the commencement of the proposed lease. In coming to its decision the Court of Appeal considered all the relevant correspondence that passed between the parties on the point including Exhibits E and F. The lower court concluded:\n\n“From these series of correspondence that I have examined, I cannot see in them where the date of 1st May as the date wherein the Appellant took physical possession as being in doubt.”\n\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court stated that neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeal, made a definite finding that the Defendant agree to 1.5.82 stated in Exh. F, the plaintiff’s letter to the defendant, as the commencement date of the proposed lease. The trial court said the Defendant did not rebut the averment. The Court of Appeal, for its part said that there was no doubt that 1.5.85 was the date of the commencement of the proposed lease. It did not say positively that the Defendant agreed to this date.\n\nNnaemeka-Agu, J.S.C. stated thus:\n\n“There is one aspect of the ultimate suggestion made in the lead judgment on which I feel quite reluctant to go along with my learned brother. He suggested that, in view of the enormous expenses which the Respondents ran at the request of the Appellants, counsel on both sides should put their heads together to see how justice could be done to them. I cannot agree to this without pointing out that the Respondents were the architects of their own misfortune. With all the clear story which the quality and language of their correspondences tell, they still elected to act for themselves, for a transaction which could have been worth several millions of naira. It was only after they had ruined their case that it dawned on them that they should brief an experienced counsel, for the court case. This is a height of indiscretion. Yet, it is said that the quality of mercy is not strained. It is only on this ground that I associate myself with the suggestion that counsel should agree on what compensation should be paid to the Respondents for the expenses they ran at the request of the Appellants, inspite of the fact that there was no binding contract between the parties.”\n\nThe Appeal was allowed.\n\nPROPERTY LAW – WEEK 8\n\nCOVENANTS\n\nA covenant is a promise under seal, enforceable according to the law of contract. That is, it is a formal promise or agreement in a contract that sets out the rights and duties of the parties to the agreement.\n\nTYPES OF COVENANTS\n\nThere are three (3) types of covenants that should be in a standard lease namely:\n\n1. Implied Covenants;\n\n2. Usual Covenants; and\n\n3. Express Covenants\n\nIMPLIED COVENANTS\n\nSubject to any contrary intention, there are certain covenants that are implied into the relationship between a lessor and a lessee, they are so essential that whether or not the lease or tenancy make provision for them (the covenants), they are implied by law.\n\nImplied terms are of two types viz:\n\ni. Implied covenants on lessee; and\n\nii. Implied covenants on lessor.\n\nIMPLIED COVENANTS ON LESSEE\n\n1) To pay rent – This is a common law obligation to pay for use and occupation of demised premises during the duration of a lease (Not necessarily an essential feature of a lease as consideration could be in things other than money).\n\n2) To pay rates and taxes – It is implied that a lessee should pay for the rates and taxes chargeable to the tenant i.e. water rate, electricity bills, telephone bills, waste disposal, security etc.\n\n3) To keep demised premises in repair – This is the tenant’s obligation not to commit waste. There are two types of waste namely Voluntary waste (positive willful destruction of property); and Permissive waste (where the lessee neglects to maintain the property).\n\nWaste is different from the effect of wear and tear arising from usual use of the premises. A lessee for a term of years is liable for both types of waste i.e. he must keep the property in the same state of repair at the commencement of the term.\n\nHowever, it is prudent in a lease with respect to a yearly tenant to insert an express covenant that the lessee must not commit waste and is bound to use the property in a tenant like manner.\n\n4) To permit the lessor to enter and view the condition of the property – This Covenant arises where it is an express term of the lease or impliedly that the landlord is bound to repair or the statute requires him to carry out certain repairs.\n\nA diligent solicitor still has to expressly reserve this right in the covenant to enter and view repair to the lessor. This is to ensure his reversionary interest is protected.\n\nIMPLIED COVENANTS ON LESSOR\n\n1) Implied covenant for quiet enjoyment – This provision is made available in section 7 of the Conveyancing Act 1881; and section 100 Property and Conveyancing Law 1959. A breach of this covenant entitles the lessee to damages from the lessor. This covenant is breached if the lessee’s enjoyment of the property is interrupted by the lessor or any person claiming through him.\n\n2) Implied convenant not to derogate from grant – The landlord should not do anything that inhibits the lessee’s enjoyment of the demised premises. That is, he should not take with the left hand that which he has granted with the right by doing things or creating situations where the lessee is unable to enjoy the easements appurtenant to the property.\n\n3) Implied covenant that the house if fit for inhabitation – The general rule is that the tenant must take the property as he finds it. The landlord is under no implied obligation to repair and he does not impliedly covenant that the property is fit for purpose for which it is required. However, where the property is to be a dwelling housing there is an implied condition that the house is fit for human habitation at the commencement of the tenancy and implied undertaking by the landlord to keep it so during the tenancy. The landlord will not be liable for a breach of this undertaking unless he has notice of the defect, whether latent or patent.\n\n4) Complying with the recovery of premises legislations – It is implied that the landlord must comply with the provisions of statutes concerning property, particularly with respect to recovery of premises.\n\nUSUAL COVENANTS\n\nUsual covenants in leases are those that are proper and common in a lease based on the facts or evidence presented before the court. What constitutes “usual” covenant in leases is a question of fact and law. In some jurisdictions what constitute usual covenants are provided by statute. Some of the covenants classified as usual covenant are often implied and in some cases expressly stated. What constitute usual covenants will depend on the custom of the locality, usage, habit in the trade, or business – Sweet & Maxwell Ltd. v. Universal Services (1964) 2 Q. B 699; Flexman v. Corbett (1930) 1 Ch. 672. What constitute usual covenants depend on how the lease agreement is drafted. One thing to note is that such covenants must be reasonable and capable of enforcement. Where they are unreasonable the court shall not enforce such covenants.\n\nExamples of what may constitute usual covenants are:\n\n1) Covenant of quiet enjoyment\n\n2) Covenant to pay rent\n\n3) To pay taxes, rates and other outgoings except those expressly payable by the landlord e.g. tenement rate, ground rent (these rates go to title and to ownership and not to possession).\n\n4) To keep the property in a reasonable state of repairs and deliver it up in such state\n\n5) To allow the landlord the right to view the state of repairs of the demised premises.\n\nEXPRESS COVENANTS\n\nExpress covenants are those terms of the lease agreement which the parties mutually agree upon as binding on them. Once these clauses are inserted in the agreement, parties are bound by them.\n\nGenerally the court will enforce all agreements entered at arms length by adults having capacity provided such agreements are not contrary to law or public policy, not scandalous and not immoral.\n\nThe draftsman needs to be very meticulous in drafting express covenants. He should exercise due care and skill for he could be liable in tort for negligent drafting. The client could claim damages against a practitioner. The court would construe express covenant in a lease as true expression of the intention of the parties. Also note the “contra proferentes rule” to the effect that “a document is construed strictly against the maker”.\n\nThere are various specific express covenant clauses viz:\n\n1) Covenant to pay rent – Though this is an implied covenant, to be noted is that where the draftsman expressly provides for the payment of rent he is able to state clearly, the amount payable, mode of payment and when payment becomes due. Also, consequence of failure to pay rent is forfeiture of the property and the landlord can exercise his right of re-entry – Yahaya v. Chukwura (2002) 3 NWLR (Pt. 753) 20.\n\nThe rent covenant is usually written thus:\n\n“in consideration of the rent of =N=250,000.00 (two hundred and fifty thousand Naira) per annum payable in advance and covenant of this lease the sum/rent of =N=500,000.00 having been paid for the first 2 years of the term granted (receipt of which the landlord acknowledges)” or paying and yielding the sum of ………. or paying the sum of……”\n\n2) Covenant to pay rates and outgoings – It is an implied covenant of the tenant to pay levies, rates and taxes payable by the tenant e.g. waste disposal levy, water rate, telephone bills, security levy, etc. some of such levies are chargeable to the building so that the parties must expressly determine who pays them e.g. tenement rate, neighbourhood improvement rate etc. It is also to be noted that the rates and taxes are created and levied by the municipal Authority where the property is located e.g. Local Government. Such authority could determine and levy some taxes and levies at anytime. A party who covenants to pay levies, rates and taxes is liable to continue to pay only existing levies, rates and taxes and not new or future levies, rates and taxes. To be sure that all such future levies and taxes are captured. The draftsman should provide for such future levies, rates and taxes.\n\nFor example:\n\n“The tenant covenants to pay and discharge from time to time and at all times during the said term all existing and future taxes, rates levies and other outgoings whatsoever imposed or charged or assessed upon the demised premises or occupier thereof.”\n\n3) Covenant against assignment subletting or parting away with possession – This is a clause to restrict the tenant from parting with possession of all or part of the premises. This clause cannot be enforced against a sublease; the courts are of the opinion that a tenant has an alienable estate in the property.\n\nThus, an unqualified covenant by the tenant not to assign amounts to an absolute prohibition. The court is usually wary about enforcing an absolute prohibition covenant because of the fact that a lease at common law cannot be frustrated. Therefore, an absolute prohibition would work hardship on the tenant. The tenant may in spite of such absolute prohibition assign or sublet where the fact and circumstance are reasonable.\n\nSuch absolute prohibition may read thus:\n\n“Not to assign underlet or part with possession of the demised premises or any part thereof without the previous written consent of the landlord. Such consent not to be unreasonably withheld in the case of a reasonable and respectable assignee or under tenant.” – Ishola-Williams v. Hammond Project (1988) NWLR (Pt. 71) 481; Inua Wada v. Thomas Byne (1973) 3 CCHCJ 59.\n\n4) Covenant to repair – In the absence of express covenant, the obligation is imposed on the tenant to repair (this is because the landlord under common law is under no liability to repair any part of the property). In practice, there is a general obligation imposed on the landlord to carry out structural repairs (repairs of main parts of the house like main walls, roof, etc.), while the tenant effect minor repairs (interiors, floors, etc.)\n\nA covenant to repair imposes an obligation on the person covenanting to put the premises into repair even if they are in a state of disrepair at the start of the lease – Payne v. Haine (1847) 16 M & W 541 at 545, and to ensure that they do not thereafter fall into a state of disrepair – Proudfoot v. Hart (1890) 25 Q. B. D 50.\n\nThe tenant is obliged to use the property in a tenant-like manner and redecorate at the expiration of the term. For example:\n\n“To keep the demised premises in good and tenantable state of repair and condition during the subsistence of the term or any extension of it and to yield up the same in a state of repairs (fair wear and tear excepted)”.\n\n5) User restriction – The general rule is that the premises can be used for any purpose as long as it is legal, even if the usage is different from the purpose originally contemplated – Dawodu v. Odulaja (1976) OYSHC (Pt. 1) 65. This clause is however inserted in a lease where the landlord wants to restrict the use of which the property is put to. The landlord could further restrict the use to which a demised premise may be put by restricting the user e.g. “for residential purpose only” or could restrict the carrying on of some trade or business on the demised premises. Where the user clause is very restrictive the value of the property may be negatively affected. The user covenant is also used where there are several users e.g. shopping malls or an estate. This is to contribute to the healthy enjoyment of individual property without any form of nuisance or annoyance coming from a neighbouring property.\n\n6) Covenant to insure – This is an undertaken by either of the parties to insure the demised premises. The importance of this clause is apparent; the landlord by this ensures that his reversionary interest in the property is protected in case of any mishap. The tenant on the other hand ensures that his interest in the property is recognized especially in cases of compensation. It should be noted that where a tenant takes a lease of a property he is obliged to pay rent on the property throughout the term granted whether or not he is able to use the property.\n\nA typical insurance clause should cover the following areas:\n\ni. Who is to insure – The property in whose name the property is to be insured should be stated.\n\nii. The risk to insure – There are many risks to insure in a property. The parties should agree on what specific risk to insure against e.g. fire. In drafting the clause, the solicitor should avoid the use of expressions such as “insurable risks” or “full & comprehensive insurable risks”, because these terms have no defined meanings.\n\niii. Amount of cover – section 50 of the Insurance Act provides that the receipt of an insurance premium shall be a condition precedent to a valid contract of insurance and there shall be no cover in respect of an insurance risk unless the premium is paid. Accordingly, a covenant on insurance should provide for the amount of the cover and this should not be less than the full cost of reinstatement.\n\niv. Application of insurance money – The lease should provide for how moneys that may be collected from the insurance company will be applied and what will happen where reinstatement of the premises is impossible.\n\n7) Abatement of rent – This often flows from the covenant to insure. It is to further protect the tenant who for no fault of his can no longer enjoy the demised premises because of some circumstances that has put the premises out of use. The tenant still remains obliged to pay rent since a lease is not frustrated at common law. Where the tenancy is for a length of time it is prudent for the tenants’ solicitor to insert a rent abatement clause. This means that where the tenant is unable to use the property due to some frustration circumstances the rent would cease from being payable.\n\n8) Option to renew – An option to renew is an irrevocable offer to the tenant. The option must be accepted as it is made otherwise a qualified acceptance of it would amount to a counter offer which would destroy the offer. The landlord’s solicitor in drafting this renewal clause has to be careful to guard against a perpetually renewable lease.\n\nThus in drafting the option to renew the lease the solicitor must exclude the option as part of the interests that would be subject to renewal. The draftsman should also draft into this clause a rent review clause otherwise the tenancy would be renewed at the prevailing rent and condition if the clause is not qualified.\n\n9) Rent review clause – A rent review clause is inserted in a lease to enable the landlord take advantage of prevailing market rates in property value. It is a hedge against the ravages of inflation on the value of money. Where it is not inserted the landlord is obliged to renew the lease at the prevailing rent.\n\nDETERMINATION OF A LEASE\n\nThe tenant is under an obligation to deliver up peaceful and quiet possession of the premises at the end of tenancy.\n\nThe following are the various methods in which a lease may be determined:\n\n1. By expiration of a term – A lease or tenancy for a fixed period is automatically determined at the end of the period. The determination may also be the happening of some events.\n\n2. By notice to quit – A lease can be terminated either by the landlord or the tenant serving notice on the other party. Where the agreement is silent on the duration of the notice, the rule of common law applies, and where the property is situate in an area governed by Rent Control and Recovery of Premises Law, then the law applies. Section 14(1) of Rent Control and Recovery of Premises Law R6 Laws of Lagos State provides that where there is no stipulation as to the notice to be given by either party to determine the tenancy, the following periods of time shall be given:\n\ni. In the case of tenancy at will or a weekly tenancy – one (1) week notice.\n\nii. In the case of a monthly tenancy – one (1) month notice\n\niii. In the case of a yearly tenancy – six (6) months notice.\n\nBut where the parties have made express agreement relating to the length of notice, the above provisions of the Law shall not apply – Chief Ikomi v. Cole (1960) 5 FSC 63.\n\nNotice to quit should be personally served on either party, but where there is evidence that the other party is evading service, then notice can be place on some conspicuous part of the premises.\n\n3. By forfeiture – The landlord may become entitled to re-take the premises before the expiration of the tenancy, where there is a breach of covenant by the tenant or by operation of law. On the other hand, the tenant can seek remedy where the landlord breaches the covenant.\n\n4. By surrender – This is applicable where a tenant surrenders to his immediate landlord. Where before the surrender, the tenant had created an encumbrance on the property, then on surrender, the landlord takes subject to it. Surrender can be express or by operation of law. It is express where it is by deed whilst it is by operation of law where it is commensurate with what is necessary to give validity to the transaction is stopped from disputing – Allen v. Roachdale B. C (1999) 3 All E. R 443 at 451 per Morritt L. J.\n\n5. By merger – This is where the tenant retains the lease and requires the reversion which makes the lease subsumed and destroyed. A merger will still operate where a third party acquires the lease and the reversion. For a merger to be operative, the person in whom the merger is vested must have acquired both the lease and the reversion in the same capacity. In Chambers v. Kingham (1878) 10 Ch. 631, the court held that where a person holds the lease as his and the reversion as an executor, it does not amount to a merger.\n\nPARTS OF A LEASE\n\n1. Commencement – THIS LEASE or THIS DEED OF LEASE\n\nWhere it is a simple tenancy, it is commenced with the words “THIS TENANCY AGREEMENT or THIS AGREEMENT”\n\n2. Date – Made this …………… day of …………. 20…..\n\nThe date is the day the lease is made. Where the lease is made by deed, the date is not an essential part of the lease since the important date is the date of the delivery of the lease. However, if it is a tenancy agreement, the important date is the date of the execution.\n\n3. Parties – BETWEEN ……………… AND ………………. (Lessor and Lessee or Landlord and Tenant).\n\nThe parties should be described in their full names, addresses and occupation.\n\n4. Recitals – BACKGROUND\n\nA recital is not an essential part of a lease. It may be useful in grants of sub-leases where the lessee is prohibited from granting a sub-lease without the consent of the head-lessor in order for the recital to show that consent had been given by the head-lessor to the sub-lease.\n\n5. Testatum – WITNESS AS FOLLOWS or IT IS AGREED AS FOLLOWS\n\nThis introduces the operative part of a lease.\n\n6. Consideration – The landlord LEASE to the tenant …\n\n7. Parcel – ALL THAT\n\nExcept in exceptional cases, it is not usual to have a plan of the premises attached to a lease. Where there are any easements, right of assess, etc. they should be included here.\n\n8. Habbendum – TO HOLD\n\nThe habbendum specifies the quantity and quality, duration and commencement of the term of the lease.\n\n9. Reddendum – YIELDING & PAYING THEREFORE\n\nThis defines the amount of rent that is payable by the lessee. The person to whom rent is payable must be stated and also the mode of payment. Generally, rent is payable in arrears; therefore, if it is to be paid in advance, it must be indicated and the date for such payment, otherwise it will be assumed as being payable in arrears.\n\n10. Covenants – THE TENANT/LANDLORD COVENANTS AS FOLLOWS\n\nThe tenant’s covenant should come first before the landlord’s covenant. The solicitor must be meticulous about the wordings of the covenants because their interpretation will depend on the language used to express the intention of the parties.\n\n11. Proviso for forfeiture and re-entry – PROVIDED THAT or PROVIDED ALWAYS\n\nWhen acting for the landlord, it is important to insert a proviso for forfeiture and re-entry for non-payment of rent and breach of other covenant, the clause should be drafted to dispense with the pre-condition that the landlord must make a formal demand.\n\n12. Testimonium – IN WITNESS OF WHICH\n\nThis is the clause that links or connects the parties with the agreement (terms) of the lease.\n\n13. Execution clause – SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED\n\nThe execution clause provides for the signature, mark or seal of the parties to the lease.\n\n14. Attestation clause – IN THE PRESENCE OF …\n\nThe attestation clause contains the witnesses to the lease and information about them as well as their signature.\n\nETHICAL ISSUES\n\n1. The draftsman needs to be very meticulous in drafting covenants. He should exercise due care and skill for he could be liable in tort for negligent drafting.\n\n2. A solicitor has to advise his client appropriately to the applicable laws to a given situation.\n\n3. Throughout his representation of his client, a solicitor should observe and apply the relevant law to a particular situation\n\n4. A solicitor should carefully make use of precedents and not to wholly adopt their contents to the document under draft.\n\nDRAFTING A LEASE (SAMPLE)\n\nTHIS LEASE is made this ……………… day of ……………. 20 ………..\n\nBETWEEN ……………………… (name) of ………………… (address) (lessor) of the first part and …………………………..

In Suberu v A. I. S. L. Ltd. (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt. 1043) 590, a mortgage was defined as “a conveyance of land or an assignment of chattels as a security for the payment of a debt or discharge of some other obligation for which it is given. The security is redeemable on payment or discharge of such debt or obligation, any provision to the contrary notwithstanding”.\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary (6th Edition, page 1009) defines a mortgage as “an interest in land created by a written instrument providing security for the performance of a duty or the payment of a debt”.\n\nIn Olowu v. Miller Bros (of Liverpool) Ltd. (1922) 3 NLR 110; Per Pennington J., the court defined a mortgage as “security created by contract for the payment of a debt already due or to become due.”\n\nSeveral efforts have been made in Nigeria to define what a mortgage is. In Intercity Bank Plc. v. Fred and Food Farms Nig. Ltd (2001) 17 NWLR (Pt. 742) 349, a mortgage is defined as a conveyance of property as security for debt which is lost or becomes dead to the debtor if the money or the interest due thereon is not paid on a certain date.\n\nThe complexity of the doctrine of mortgage was acknowledged in the old English case of Samuel v. Jarrah Timber and Wood Paving Corporation (1904) A. C. 323, that “No one by the light of nature has yet understood the nature of English mortgage”.\n\nPARTIES TO A MORTGAGE TRANSACTION\n\n1. The ‘Lender’ is called the ‘Mortgagee’.\n\n2. The ‘Borrower’ is called the ‘Mortgagor’.\n\n3. The ‘Guarantor’ (if any) who guarantees repayment of a loan e.g. insurance companies.\n\nLAWS REGULATING MORTGAGE TRANSACTIONS IN NIGERIA\n\n1. Land Use Act.\n\n2. Land Instrument Registration Law\n\n3. Registration of Titles Law (RTL).\n\n4. Conveyancing Act (CA).\n\n5. Property and Conveyancing Law (PCL).\n\n6. Stamp Duties Act.\n\n7. Illiterate Protection Act.\n\n8. Land Registration Act.\n\nMORTGAGE INSTITUTIONS\n\nA mortgage protection policy is useful to protect the borrower (and his estate) in the event of death or bankruptcy and the borrower cannot repay the loan.\n\nMortgage institutions are regulated by the provisions of the Mortgage Institutions Act, Cap. M19 LFN, 2004. The object of this is to make provisions for establishment and licensing of mortgage institutions and to accept savings and deposits from members of the public and pay interest on the deposit.\n\nThe following are examples of mortgage institutions in Nigeria:\n\n1. Federal Mortgage Bank\n\n2. Commercial Banks\n\n3. Insurance Companies also known as Life Endowment Policy\n\n4. Housing Corporations\n\n5. Staff Housing Schemes\n\n6. Private developers\n\nFEDERAL MORTGAGE BANK\n\nThis is the apex institution for mortgage business in Nigeria. It is established by section 1 of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria Act, Cap E16 LFN, 2004.\n\nSection 5 of the Act provides that the function of the Bank shall be to provide loan-term credit facilities to Primary Mortgage Institutions (PMI) in Nigeria, licence, control, and encourage the growth of Secondary Mortgage Institutions, the Bank also collect, manage and administer the National Housing Fund.\n\nThe advantages of the bank as a source of loan are:\n\n1. It gives as much as 66% of purchase price as loan;\n\n2. It gives a long term loan payable over a period of 20 years;\n\n3. It gives a low interest rate of about 6% per annum; and\n\n4. It has lots of branches across Nigeria so it is widely spread and easily accessible.\n\nCOMMERCIAL BANKS\n\nCommercial banks provide credits for financing projects including party acquisition. They are usually the last resort for mortgage loan because they prefer to give short term loans with very high interest rate. It is normally between 5 to 10 years of repayment while the interest is some times as high as 20%. Thus, it is not the best option for loan.\n\nINSURANCE COMPANIES\n\nThis is a policy of life insurance which is a form of savings. Such companies may lend or guarantee loan from a Bank with a collateral mortgage of life policy, that is, the insurance company may serve as a guarantor to a holder to borrow from a Commercial Bank. Thus, the insurance companies provide money for the purchase of a property or guarantee loan from a bank. In this type of mortgage loan, no option of the loan is repayable until the period stated in it matures or upon the death of the borrower.\n\nHOUSING CORPORATIONS\n\nAn example of this is the Federal Housing Authority established by Federal Housing Authority Act, Cap. F14 LFN, 2004, for the primary function of recommending to government a National Housing Programme and the execution of such programmes.\n\nThey provide funds for building or sometimes they build and offer them to the public for sale.\n\nThe advantages of this as a source of loan are:\n\n1. It gives low interest rate.\n\n2. Security of title in respect of party purchased from it since they are granted on state land, the granting of Certificate of Occupancy is automatic and immediate.\n\nSTAFF HOUSING SCHEME\n\nThis is a scheme made for the benefits of employees to enable them acquire their own houses. The employer gives loan on the security of the property; the practice is that the employee is required to deposit the title document with the employer until the loan is fully paid. In consideration, the banks make deductions from the salaries of the employee over a period of time. Only very few organization are still able to operate this scheme because of lack of funds.\n\nPRIVATE DEVELOPERS\n\nThis has to do with developing of estates for sale to the public. A prospective buyer is expected to pay only 50% to"
