Evan Runner*\n\nProfessor Runner is to be especially credited with introducing Reformational theory and practice into the English-speaking world by rescuing it from the confines of a little-known language, Dutch. From him it has spread throughout North America and from there to many other countries.\n\nA place to begin with Runner is: https://herunner.wordpress.com/.\n\nYou will find archives there with much information about Runners work, history including that of the (in)famous Groen Club at Calvin College. This is the place, the introduction. Go there.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed Evan Runners very lively philosophy lectures, but I was not sure what to make of his holistic gospel stuff—until I worked in Nigeria for a while and noticed the weakness of the Nigerian churches that had been saddled with a dualistic version of the Gospel. It did not prepare them for contributing to the newly developing culture or how to face a wholistic Islam. I started drawing from Runners lectures with their many resources for a broader approach. When I started applying that, I found it was deeply appreciated by Christians.\n\nDr. Jan H. Boer\n\nProprietor of website\n\nRon Roper, Runner Bibliography. A privately circulated document.

The reason for that emphasis is that Boer, the original creator of this website, spent most of his professional life in Nigeria, while much of his writings are about Nigeria.\n\nClassifying Van der Walt as a Reformational pioneer is in keeping with the above emphasis. Though Boer (myself) has done much to apply Reformational insights to Nigeria as a missionary, Van der Walt has written a dozen or so tomes applying those insights to Africa as a professional philosopher. He deserves to be included among the pioneers of the movement.\n\n----------, Thomas Aquinas and the Neo-Thomist tradition: A Christian-philosophical assessment.

Succeeding* Reformational Generations and Friends*--Generalists\n\nIntroductory Comments\n\nOriginally, the heading of this and succeeding sections was Succeeding Reformational Generations and Compatibles. The point was that not all the entries would be Reformational, but they could be considered compatible. They mostly include Evangelicals and Roman Catholics, while some align with none of these three. However, then it occurred to me that, frankly speaking, not all those are really compatible with the full Reformational smorgasbord, but they are fellow Christians with whom there is a broad compatibility but not fully so. So, instead, we welcome them as Fellow Travelers.\n\nEven some of the non-Christian items can serve as helpful supplementary resources.\n\nGeneral Topics\n\nInstitutions*, Journals, Magazines\n\neGranary Digital Library--About the eGranary | www.widernet.org\n\nDelivering digital teaching materials to practitioners and scholars in the developing world\n\nThe eGranary Digital Library -- \"The Internet in a Box\" -- is an off-line information store that provides instant access to over 35 million digital resources for those lacking adequate Internet connections.\n\nThe Neo-Calvinism Research Institute, Theological University Utrecht, The Netherlands.

Kuipers with Hendrik Hart, \"Why did I make a $100,000 end-of-life donation to ICS?\" ICS E-Newsletter, October 2020.\n\nJan H. Boer, proprietor of this website, a postscript to Hart.\n\nIn his archives above, Hart tells us of the respect, admiration and amazement Canadian universities express for that little pigmy called Institute for Christian Studies for the high quality of the publications and theses ICS faculty and graduates produce. As a missionary-scholar in Nigeria, I have received similar reactions from Nigerians and others. I refer you to Section 2 of the BOERIANA page of this website. Nigerians have asked me about the reason for what they describe as my unusually successful missionary ministry. The reason is the same as the one described by Hart in the above paragraphs. My wife and I have been motivated by the same wholistic ministry that has inspired the ICS faculty and students: a wholistic Gospel that underlies all of its endeavours and that forcefully rejects the dualism or separation between religion and culture. This wholistic approach has such wide and powerful ramifications for both scholarship and mission and, indeed, life itself, that time and again it evokes the admiration and amazement referred to above and leads to logical conclusions that its opponents can only reject on basis of their unproven worldview, beliefs or plain prejudices, but not on basis of logic or reason. Hence, my wife and I have also decided on a large gift to the ICS out of gratitude for the powerful Biblical Reformational perspective that we have inherited from the Reformational community at large, especially from the late Professor H. Evan Runner, and that has guided us throughout our Nigeria years as well as our post-Nigeria writings, including this very website.\n\nJim Olthuis, In memoriam: Hendrik Hart. ICS E-Newsletter, April 2021.\n\nResearch Portal of the Institute for Christian Studies (ICS), Toronto. research-portal.icscanada.edu\n\nICS research activities inform policy-makers, educators, citizens and leaders.

Most are of Reformational stripe, while some are at least compatible and others merely friendly, but for all there is a reason for their inclusion,\n\nIt is helpful to realize that when it comes to copyright, not all publishers are the same; some are generous, while others are downright stingy. Some declare that since no text is included, only bibliographical materials, there are no legal copyright requirements for any of this, while others insist there are.\n\nPlease remember that part of the identification of this section is General, referring to writings not easily fitting under a specific discipline. The same writers listed under General may also appear under specific disciplines either as Multiple* or Single*, but usually with different titles, though there are some intended duplications. An example is Nicholas Wolterstorff, who features under several disciplines and can thus be found in several sections, particularly this one and the one on The Arts.\n\nDo please also remember that this website concentrates on non-theological subjects, except in the section on the PIONEERS on this page and on the MEDITATION page. It is mostly devoted to Christian perspectives on life and on many academic disciplines excepting the theological. We have enough of that.\n\nYou have three helpful tools for this section and beyond. The first is the traditional alphabet: Authors of Multiple Listings are listed alphabetically. The other tool, your real digital secret weapon, is the Find function (^F). Search for any name you think might be featured among Reformationals and their friends or any broad discipline and you should be good to go. The third is the generous use of asterisks (*) behind some names and key words in headings. The combined use of ^F and * should lead you to your subject. In addition to generalists and philosophers, you will find physical and social scientists, technologists alongside art majors, economists and political scientists, historians as well as educationists.

He is the author of several books and many published articles relating to philosophy and religious studies. He has a degree in law, a graduate degree in philosophy and a doctorate in religious studies. He practiced law for many years. He has been interested in the philosophy of Herman Dooyeweerd since 1970. He has studied that philosophy at the Institute for Christian Studies (Toronto) and the Free University of Amsterdam, and has since researched early materials held by the Dooyeweerd archives in Amsterdam. The results of his research include the many papers available on this website as well as his recent book Neo-Calvinism and Christian Theosophy: Franz von Baader, Herman Dooyeweerd.\n\nFriesens setup is not altogether clear, but I believe that Christian Nondualism is meant to be the general name of his Reformational website. It is a very rich website with pages dedicated to some of the pioneers of the movement, including some surprising ones that Friesen considers contributors, as well as a few others that have piqued his interest for other reasons. Heres the entire list: Herman Dooyeweerd, Franz Von Baader, Abhishiktananda, Ramana Maharshi, C. G. Jung, D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, Frederik Van Eeden, Mennonites – and a linked glossary as a bonus. As I read him, I conclude that he is a deep Reformational philosopher but somewhat off the mainstream track, a comment not to be understood negatively but pointing to his philosophical creativity.\n\n----------, For his very useful and revealing self-introduction, including references to many works, go to https://jgfriesen....\n\n---------- and Jan H.

Without having studied this essay in detail, I wonder if Friesen forgets that truth develops over time. Earlier adherents to Reformational philosophy were also children of their time, while subsequent generations slowly allowed the leaven of Reformational thought to work its way through that community. There is such a thing as the dynamic unfolding of movement and philosophy. Does Friesen perhaps present a static picture of a movement that was dynamically emerging in the context of its times? Mine is a hesitant question. I respect Friesens detailed scholarship too much to be sure of this hesitant question, but I cannot suppress it.\n\n----------, Response to query from Jan H.

Springer, January 12, 2018 (pp. 347).\n\nThis work provides an overview of attempts to assess the current condition of the concept of creation order within reformational philosophy compared to other perspectives. Focusing on the natural and life sciences, and theology, this first volume of two examines the arguments for and against the beauty, coherence and order shown in the natural world being related to the will or nature of a Creator. It examines the decay of a Deist universe, and the idea of the pre-givenness of norms, laws and structures as challenged by evolutionary theory and social philosophy. It describes the different responses to the collapse of order: that given by Christian philosophy scholars who still argue for the idea of a pre-given world order, and that of other scholars who see this idea of stable creation order and/or natural law as redundant and in need of a thorough rethinking. It studies the particular role that reformational philosophy has played in the discussion. It shows how, ever since its inception, almost a century ago, the concepts of order and law (principle, structure) have been at the heart of this philosophy, and that one way to characterise this tradition is as a philosophy of creation order. Reformational philosophers have maintained the notion of law as 'holding' for reality. This book discusses the questions that have arisen about the nature of such law: is it a religious or philosophical concept; does law just mean 'orderliness'? How does it relate to laws of nature? Have they always existed or do they 'emerge' during the process of evolution?\n\n----------, trans. Jan H. Boer, Creation Order versus Evolutionary Chaos. Aspecten, July 2011.

Among other things, I read H. Evan Runner's Scriptural Religion and Political Task and The Relation of the Bible to Learning (See above on this page). Runner's dictum that life is religion strongly resonated with me, as did Kuyper 's commitment to the comprehensive lordship of God in Christ over the whole of life. Here was something worth celebrating. Biblical truths that had previously been in the background for me suddenly came alive and made sense in a new way.\n\nBut almost none of my Christian friends and family had heard of Kuyper or know of the vibrant intellectual tradition associated with his legacy. . But the notion of a Christian statesman seeking to honour God in concrete political service was far from view.\n\n(Much of Koyzis' article describes a library of English works on and by Kuyper already published as well as those in process.)\n\nDavid Koyzis, Gods Kingdom Will Have No End. CC, December 12, 2016. http://christiancourier.ca...\n\nMike Wagenman, Authority: Whats Love Got to Do with It? Review of We Answer to Another: Authority, Office and the Image of God by David Koyzis.

He studied Theology at Igbaja Theological Seminary, Nigeria (Th.B.); Theology and Ethics at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, USA (MATS); and Social Ethics at Boston University, USA (Ph.D.).

Revised edition, 2019.\n\nA highly respected Christian leader and social philosopher, Dr. Yusufu Turaki, has in this Book, provided a brilliant anatomy and analysis of Colonial Legacy in post-colonial Nigeria. It is a \"must read\" book not only to academic readership but also to policy makers and the clergy as well. For, this great work, from the heart of a social ethicist and theologian, has eloquently utilized great insights from many scholars and disciplines analysing Nigeria's socio-political and moral predicaments.\n\nIn summary, the author clearly asserts that (1) It is not possible for us to have proper grasp of the nature of political events, trends and patterns in Nigeria today without understanding her colonial legacies, (2) it is not possible for us to solve contemporary socio-political problems in Nigeria without correcting the inherited colonial structures and redressing the injustices generated by these colonial legacies of post-colonial Nigeria. We must do so by using the principles of Justice, Equality, Freedom and Equity in socio-political relationships and in the distribution of resources for the benefit of all.\n\n**----------, The Unique Christ for Salvation: The Challenge of the Non-Christian Religions and Cultures.

Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2005.\n\nIn this brief and straightforward examination of Christians' basic beliefs, Albert M. Wolters spells out the structure of a reformational worldview and its significance for those who seek to follow the Scriptures. Wolters begins by defining the nature and scope of a worldview, distinguishing it from philosophy or theology, and noting that the Christian community has advanced a variety of worldviews. He then outlines a Reformed analysis of the three fundamental turning points in human history – Creation, the Fall, and Redemption – concluding that while the Fall might reach into every corner of the world, Christians are called to participate in Christ's redemption of all creation.\n\nTranslations of the book in Dutch, Japanese, Afrikaans, Korean, Slovak, Russian, Portuguese, while it was republished in the UK both in 1986 and 1996.\n\nNicholas Wolterstorff: \"This is the best statement I have come across of the 'Reformational' Christian worldview.
