I ask when the black, brown and red\n\nblood of coloured martyrs becomes a bright-enough sign\n\non our doorposts to make the angels of death pass over.\n\nbut until then I sing.\n\nI sing of black boys, brown boys, sweet boys.\n\nI sing of boys who, though stretched and thorned\n\non all ends, though broken like slashed water, have\n\nforged themselves a voice from the language of fear.\n\nI sing of boys who like god, boys—gods, have\n\npainted themselves into a rainbow in the sky,\n\nthis sky, you call it your sky,\n\nto remind you that we are here, that\n\nyour hands around the neck of our voices is\n\nnot enough to tie our tongues, that\n\nyour palms slapping fire into our bones is\n\nnot death, it is a request for our singing.\n\nBy Ernest Ogunyemi\n\nBiography:\n\nErnest Ogunyemi is an eighteen year-old writer from Nigeria.
