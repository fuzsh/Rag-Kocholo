        "text": "Mercedes Benz is a world-renowned automobile company that is based in Stuttgart, Germany. Going by its slogan \"The best or nothing,\" it comes as no surprise that this company has curved a niche for itself with its vehicles that boast top-class engineering, class, comfort, elegance, mind-boggling technology and some good old-fashioned power.\n\nThe name Mercedes Benz is credited to Karl Benz; who made a Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1886 as well as Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901 Mercedes. The name was introduced to the public in 1926 under Daimler-Benz.\n\nKarl Friedrich Benz (1844-1929), was a mechanical engineer who was born in Karlsruhe, Baden in Germany. He is regarded by many as the father of the world’s first \"horseless carriage;\" an internal combustion engine-powered automobile that was patented on 29th January 1886. This project was funded by Bertha Benz.\n\nGottlieb Wilhelm Daimler (1834-1900), was a German inventor and engineer who patented one of the first internal-combustion engines. In 1882, Daimler and his long-time collaborator engineer Wilhelm Maybach established an engine-building shop. They invented a high-speed engine that was fueled by liquid petroleum.\n\nThey founded the Daimler Motors Corporation (DMG); the mother company of the Mercedes cars.\n\nDMG began the production of the first Mercedes car in 1899. The Mercedes name was introduced in 1901 by Austrian Emil Jellinek; an automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG. Inspired by his daughter Mercedes Jellinek, he named the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp in her honor. The name was also meant to appeal to the French market.\n\nREAD THIS: TOP MERCEDES-BENZ CARS TO BUY\n\nKarl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler continued to be in fierce competition and despite having similar interests, they never spoke to each other. Daimler died in 1900.\n\nAfter World War I, there was an economic depression that caused a slump for both the Benz and DMG companies. In 1926, the two companies were forced to merge as Mercedes-Benz in order to boost their chances of survival. With the above been said, below are the Profile Of Mercedes-benz And Some Of Its Models.\n\n1) 2025 – self- driving truck\n\nThe future is here….well, at least until 2025. This truck is like something out of a Science fiction movie, a glimpse into the brains of Mercedes Benz “wizards” to see their definition of a futuristic vehicle.\n\nThe truck boasts a sleek and aerodynamic look, radical LED lights and radar and camera systems. Would you like to hear the best part? The truck can move all by itself; however, a driver is still required. Ideally, the truck is meant to make the driver’s job easier—at least on highways.\n\nThis truck is as safe as they come; driving through traffic with precision. The driver can take a break by staring into his tablet. He will receive alerts every time he is needed on the wheel, yes, it is that cool!\n\n2) 1960s- 1970s, c111, experimental car\n\nNicknamed the 'laboratory on wheels,' the model was quite a spectacle, coming with a design that looked way ahead of its time.\n\nIn 1978, the C111 hit 322 km/h at Nardò and averaged 16.0 liters/100 km at 316 km/h over a 12-hour cruise. Another record was set in 1979 after a 4.8 L twin KKK-turbocharged V8 version with 500 hp, recorded an average lap-speed of 403.78 km/h.\n\n3) 2007 stirling moss\n\nThe 2007 model was introduced in honor of a 1955 Formula 1 victory by Sir Stirling Moss who was driving a Mercedes Benz 300 SLR in the Mille Miglia. This model is meant to give you that grand-prix experience every time you drive in the streets; however, the catch is that you will also need pockets that put Donald Trump to shame.\n\nSir Stirling Craufurd Moss has been referred to as \"The greatest driver who missed out on the F1 World Championship.\" This British International Motorsports hall of famer was born in 17th September 1929; he is regarded by many as one of the greatest drivers to ever grace Formula One.\n\nYes folks, he was a Formula one star long before Michael Schummacker and Lewis Hamilton could spell the words Formula one.\n\nSir Stirling Moss had a long and illustrious career in which he enjoyed a lot of succes; however, he never won the coveted championship. Between 1955 and 1961, he finished as runner-up on four occasions and third on three occasions. In 1962, Moss was involved in a near-fatal crash that he would later recover from but at the expense of his F1 career. He is a true hero of the sport who left a legacy for future F1 drivers.\n\n4) 1954 – 1960, 300sl\n\nMama mia! This model is like a gorgeous peacock, she knows she is stunning and she parades her assets for all to marvel in awe. Born in 1954, this model first came to the market as a two-seat coupe; it is indeed a sight to behold, boasting some of the coolest gull-wing doors you can ever ask for. Mercedes later re-introduced this model as an open roadster.\n\nThe booming post-war American market was the inspiration behind the introduction of this toned-down Gran Prix model. Simply put, this was the car to own for every wealthy American who was a performance enthusiast!\n\nThe 300sl was always ahead of her class; scoring “straight As” that made her the fastest production car of her time.\n\n5) 1971- 1989, Mercedes Benz R107 and C107\n\nA drive in this car is like a trip back to the 70s and 80s. These Mercedes-Benz models were in production from 1971 through 1989. After G-Class, they are the second longest single series ever produced by Mercedes. The models came with different features like 2-seats and 4-seats in order to feed the needs of the common folks in town.\n\n6) 1955–1963,190 sl\n\nIf you thought your girlfriend is beautiful, then you should take a look at this German cutie. This two-door super luxury roadster is as “cool” as the North Pole; coming with an irresistible design that allows you to remove the hardtop so that you can rock your dark sunglasses and take a drive around town.\n\n7) 1937- 1950, 170V\n\nThis model screams “vintage” right from the first time you see it. An elegant beauty that boasts of some serious German workmanship; it belonged to the class of compact/ small family cars. Between 1936 and 1939, everyone was asking for a piece of the 170V, making it Mercedes' top selling model of that time.\n\n1958, Ponton w 128\n\nThis is another artistic piece of German ingenuity that belongs in the classic era. After World War II, Mercedes began the production of the Ponton passenger vehicle model. The W128 luxury car is a 6-cylinder Mercedes-Benz model that came in body styles that varied from cabriolet, sedan to coupé. It ran from 1958 to 1960.\n\n9) 1968- 1976, E class, w 114/ 115\n\nThese models rocked a basic look for the simple folks who do not like a lot of “stuff” on their cars. The W115 came with a four-cylinder engine while the W114 boasted a six-cylinder engine. Do not take the simple design for granted, the models are still German to the bone; oozing class, style and power for days!"
