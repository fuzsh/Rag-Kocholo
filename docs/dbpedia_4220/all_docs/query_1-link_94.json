Backfire bombers have been training for months over the Norwegian Sea. They have been observed doing mid-air refueling from Midas tankers and are often escorted. About 150 Backfires are thought to be operational and based on 4 bases on the Kola peninsula. Author: Freek Schepers, Herman SUOMENLINNA War between NATO and Russia is imminent. The Russian forces on the Kola peninsula will need unhindered access to the Atlantic and have drafted a plan to deal with Finland.

Admiral Yuri Padorin has drafted an alternative plan to deal with Finland. Author: Freek Schepers STRIKE WARFARE Following the collapse of the German Uprising in 1989, Russia's military slowly gained strength while Gorbachev and Putin focused on the Economy. Now Russia is preparing for the opening salvo of WWIV. NATO doctrine predicts the presence of one or more CVBGs in the Barentz or Norwegian Seas. Author: Freek Schepers, Herman Hum WESTERN APPROACHES The war in the Atlantic has been raging for several months. Russian cooperative tactics employing Backfire bombers and submarines have proven that well defended convoys are ripe targets. NATO is now switching to smaller convoys and employing deceptive tactics. Russia is deploying her remaining submarines close to the English Channel where the likelihood of detecting convoys is greatest. The UK has defended her waters with big minefields and is careful not to communicate their location too early! Author: Freek Schepers PACIFIC The NATO-Russian war is 3 weeks old. Russia's naval aviation forces on the Kola peninsula, after being hard hit in the beginning of the war, are creating headaches for NATO in the Atlantic. The Baltic theatre of operations is quiet. Russia seems to have transferred forces to Siberia to put pressure on the Japanese and keep US carriers under attack. The Pacific, with its wide expanses to hide in, has already seen one major battle and it seems that another one is brewing around the Japanese islands.

Russia seems to have transferred forces to Siberia to put pressure on the Japanese and to keep U.S. carriers under attack.

Russia's naval aviation forces and US Carriers have fought several bloody battles around Japan. Japan has defended its islands well, but is now very vulnerable to the closure of its SLOC's. The Chinese navy has left port but has stayed out of the battle. The US losses in the Pacific and Atlantic theatres have forced it to withdraw the Seventh Fleet from the IO. Only Diego Garcia remains as a stronghold there. The task of providing security for the Malakka Strait has been handed over to India, Thailand, and Singapore. India and Thailand will use their baby-carriers to escort tankers through the IO. The War in the Pacific has interrupted oil shipments to Japan and China for several weeks now and resumption of the oil trade has now become a strategic imperative. Author: Freek Schepers INDIAN The NATO-Russian war is 4 weeks old. Russia has suffered crippling losses to its long-range naval aviation forces and to its submarines in the Atlantic and Pacific theatres. The US strategy of leaving the defence of the SLOCs in the IO to India, Thailand, and Singapore has failed when China, worried about its oil supply, claimed control over the Malakka Strait. The ensuing fight sank numerous oil tankers and crippled the Allied Navies in Southeast Asia. The White House and State Department are at odds whether the Chinese intervention signals an alliance between China, Russia, and several SE-Asia nations. The US Navy is rushing reserve forces into the IO to defend the critical approaches to the Persian Gulf oil fields. Reserve troop flown to SE-Asia and the Persian Gulf Region must be matched up with their pre-positioned equipment on Diego Garcia to stabilise the region. Author: Freek Schepers ARCTIC - The True North Strong and Free When President Gorbachev was notified in 1989 of a plot to bring down the Berlin Wall later that year, he made several crucial strategic decisions. The Russian President decided to suppress the East-German Revolt, speed up the privatisation and efficiency-focus in the Russian state industries, and invest in maintenance, spare parts, and training for the military. For President Bush and his successors, the emergence of an Eastern European market and the stabilisation of the Middle East meant they could peacefully cooperate with, though quietly dislike, Russia. However, Europe found itself more and more at odds with President Gorbachev and his direct successor Putin. At the end of 2003, NATO found itself opposing a high quality Russian military. Icelandic politicians had ended the defence pact with the US and closed Kevlavik AFB. Annual years of bumper grain crops in the mechanised Russian agricultural industry effectively competed with Canada's farmers, reducing tax income, and limiting investments in Canada's armed forces. Furthermore, Canadians increasingly resented passage of unannounced American submarines and icebreakers through the Davis Strait and Perry Channel into the Arctic Ocean. In the late 1990's Canada took over control of the Northern Warning System of radar sites in Canada, automated the stations to reduce costs, and opened the North Bay Signals Centre [operated jointly with NATO, but under Canadian authority]. Automation of the radar sites meant that their nearby airstrips were closed and only four Forward-Operating-Locations for Canada's Hornets remained. Early November, NATO detected 25 Russian Tank and Infantry Divisions moving into East-Germany on pre-announced 'Mutual friendship exercises'. Russian submarines also surged into the Atlantic one week ago, and the possibility exists that Russia is also trying to bypass the G-I-UK gap by sending subs through Canada's North. Tensions are rising and the first line of defence of North America in Canada's North seems flimsy at best. Hours ago, the UK reported torpedo attacks on patrolling submarines in the Atlantic. Casualties are unknown. The Canadian Government has announced that it will deploy the Air Force forward to the FOLs. It has asked the US to provide AEW and tanker support and authorised flights over Canada by US planes. Author: Freek Schepers NORDKAPP Prior to war breaking out, a small Dutch Task force of frigates delivered the Dutch Marines to Finnmark. Having trained there for years, several companies of Marines have joined their Norwegian and British counterparts to await the expected Russian attack into Finnmark. Author: Freek Schepers FLAMING DATUM Russia has sunk numerous tankers in the Battle for Atlantic convoys. Russian penetration bombers were repulsed over Canada and Alaskan air space remains in US hands. US has withdrawn DDGs from Pacific Fleet to serve in the Atlantic and to defend CVBGs now heading for the Barentz sea and Japan. The vital oil terminals in Alaska are defended by the USCG, USAF, and some Canadian ships under US command. Author: Freek Schepers Shadow the Boomer After several vicious carrier battles in the Barents Sea and with the ground war stalemated in the Nordic winter, negotiations started to end the war. Both parties observed a cease-fire, which held surprisingly well in the first week. However, NATO feared Putin would make use of the cease-fire to bring his boomers to bastions prepared in the Barentz Sea. USN and Royal Navy hunter-killer subs were sent to stake out Severomorsk and be prepared to shadow SSBNs exiting the harbour. Author: Freek Schepers First Blood Recent demonstration of stealth technology begs the question: Could this high-technology penetrate the equally high-technology radar and missile systems of the 21st century. NATO and PACT are again poised for combat. You are the 21st century Mission commander of project Dreamland. Bring down the Pact AEW and its bridges. Author: Freek Schepers Dreamland NATO and PACT are poised for combat in this remake of Tom Clancy's \"Red Storm Rising\". NATO has put together a small highly trained team of deep strike specialists to drop the Elbe bridges along the East German border and thereby slow down the Soviet advance. In deep secrecy, the brand new F-19A Stealth fighter has been pushed into service to perform this mission. Author: Freek Schepers Antilles Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao - three islands more known as beautiful cruise ship ports than as drug stop-overs enroute to Europe. The U.S. has made these islands their forward base for drug interdiction efforts by stationing F-15s and F-16s there (which cooperate with a permanent Dutch Navy and Marine Corps detachment) to interdict smugglers. With corruption rife both in the Antilles government and in neighbouring Venezuela and the U.S. withdrawal of combat units to fight the war on terror, these three quiet islands are very near an unpredictable neighbour and in desperate need of reinforcements. Author: Freek Schepers Beach Reconnaissance Soviet submarines have scored many successes in the Atlantic convoy lanes through the profligate expenditure of torpedoes and missiles. By the third week of the war, many submarines are suspected to be low on fuel and munitions. However, the number of submarines returning to ports in the Kola Peninsula is far lower than expected. Investigate. Author: Herman Hum Bay of Pigs On April 14th, 1961, six ships departed a Nicaraguan training camp where they had spent months training with CIA instructors. Brigade 2506 was to land at the Bay of Pigs in southern Cuba to overthrow Castro's regime. Sixteen B-26C Invader medium-range bombers were ready in Central America to support their invasion. Cuba's army and militia, while numerically strong, were thought to be poorly motivated and likely to switch sides when the invasion took place. Cuba's air force was poorly equipped, had low servicability, and would be destroyed on the ground by the rebel B-26s and by US strikes on the main airbases. After all, it was the CIA who had organised the invasion. In reality, President Kennedy had inherited the operation from his predecessors and, while unwilling to pull the plug, he severely limited the support that could be given and personally ordered a veto against air strikes on Cuban airbases. Author: Freek Schepers Cuban Missile Crisis After the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Cuba started re-arming with the most modern Soviet weapon systems. MiG-19 and -21 fighters armed with Atoll-AAM, SSM-armed missile boats, and SA-2 SAMs have been supplied to Cuba in early 1962. Training has been provided in the USSR and Soviet advisors and training units were moved to Cuba. Early 1962: US recon planes spotted construction activity of what were evaluated to be missile launch pads and fleet harbours suitable for nuclear submarines. Early October: Soviet merchant ships with covered tube-like deck cargo were spotted in the Dardanelles and in the G-I-UK gap heading southwestwardly. Submarines were also detected moving into the Atlantic by the brand-new but imperfect SOSUS sensors. At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, these ships are approaching Cuba, where Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles are thought to be near operational status...

A Russian RORSAT satellite is on a realistic Polar Low Earth Orbit and it is looking for the Enterprise. Can you navigate the Enterprise safely to England? It is a well known fact that US carrier groups can evade detection by RORSAT if they choose. Author: Freek Schepers Baltic Tide World War III has been raging across the globe for three days already. Casualties have been high on both sides. Where the Soviets expected to make rapid gains on land, they have not. And where NATO expected to quickly gain control of the skies above Europe, the Pact has made more than a fight of it. At sea, there are only the quick and the dead. What were supposed to be set piece battles turned into bloodbaths with the winner being whoever fired first. While no American carriers have been sunk, yet, three have been heavily damaged in the GIUK Gap alone. One of the few things going as planned is NATO's campaign against Soviet subs in the Atlantic and North Sea. With the combination of first-class sonar, excellent signals processing, and land and ship based aircraft, NATO has been able to smother almost any sub contact they run across. Reinforcements are being rushed into the meat grinder that is the North Atlantic. Here, at least, NATO has the advantage of unrestricted access to the sea. Any Pact units in transit to the Atlantic must pass through restricted (and often NATO-controlled) seaways. Author: Dave Steinmeyer Carrier Exercise Halfway through 2008, Europe started to realize that the Asian nations' sustained economic growth would eventually lead to a strong new powerhouse. Asian countries already built or bought several very effective carriers and, with China laying down both a 45000 ton and a 96000 ton aircraft carrier, Europe decided that carriers would become critical in the future. While England's 2 new carriers are still years away, the time was ripe for some serious exercise. Author: Freek Schepers Shetland Squabble As fish populations collapsed around the world due to overfishing, nations began to come into conflict. Some nations were not overly careful about whether or no they strayed into some other nation's fisheries or territorial waters. In the last few months, Norwegian fishing boats have violated British waters. The British government intends to send a strong message. The British task commander is ordered to capture or sink Norwegian fishing boats found north of the Shetland Islands. The task force is currently south of the Shetland Islands. Author: Herman Hum in collaboration with Mark Gellis Baltic Sea Struggle In the winter of 2011, tensions between NATO and Russia increased. A Russian strategic pipeline was cut during winter, causing a giant environmental disaster. Sweden, Finland, and Russia accused each other of negligence, terrorism, and state-initiated protectionism of their own industry. All three nations sent their ready squadrons of patrol ships into the Baltic. Author: Freek Schepers Operation Journeyman Tensions in Argentina were high throughout the 70s. Border conflicts with Chile, a poor economic situation, and a lingering dispute over the Falkland Islands made UK Prime Minister Callaghan regularly check how fast SSNs could get to the South Atlantic as a deterrent to Argentina. In November 1977, Britain announced that a nuclear submarine had arrived in the South Atlantic in response to the setting up of a naval base on South Thule by Argentina. Britain warned that the British citizens in the South Atlantic had elected to remain part of the British Empire and that its deployment of a RN SSN was aimed to deter further violence.

The Blue Crew of the SSBN Michigan won the annual Fleet Achievement Award. As a reward, the Navy paid for their family members to join them in Scotland. The homeward flight was hijacked enroute and diverted to Beida, Libya. A Marine Expeditionary Unit - Special Operations Capable - and elements of Detachment Delta is sitting offshore awaiting permission to enter Libya in order to liberate the aircraft and occupants. Meanwhile, negotiations continue and hostages are being shot every six hours. After the third hostage was murdered, an uncoded message was transmitted from the Michigan and recorded by several international agencies. \"To the President of the United States Believing the Soviet demand that negotiations at Beida be conducted only by a United Nations team to be an inhuman and criminal political manoeuvre precluding swift and safe release of our families, we, the majority of the officers and crew of the USS Michigan do hereby serve warning upon the Soviet Union.

Author: Vincenzo Beretta and Herman Hum Red Lightning 2 The coup in Russia succeeded. Not only was the President imprisoned, but also the freedom movements in Poland and the German Democratic Republic were suppressed, not with violence, but more quietly. First, they were shocked by the turmoil in the Kremlin, but soon the relations between the sides normalized because the new government in Russia seemed reasonable. They wanted a new deal with the U.S. for delivery of non-military items and US business needed new deals (under pressure from the White House to be friendlier with the East). The West German Chancellor, who was mostly a puppet for big corporations that wanted more exports to the East, met with eastern President Lisy to discuss new trade deals. He was impressed by the change of language - the new officials seemed to be more realistic and friendlier than the old guard around Honecker. They know little of what was happening. In reality, the military planned to get back the old Soviet glory and demand what was rightfully theirs. If demand wasn't working, maybe pressure would. First, the old Finnish wound should be healed. As their demand was not really bad (a 'least' of the old territories which the Generals felt belonged to Russia), the Finns caved in to avoid a second Winter War. However, the Russians did not stop there. They wanted better protection of their northern flank. Sweden was strictly neutral and too strong, so Norway was the only option.NATO was not prepared. It had been lulled into a state of calm by the new warm climate between the blocs, but the Home Guard was not. Unfortunately, they were few. Russian Spetsnaz and paratroops suddenly stormed key bases and the tanks came later. There were not many NATO forces in Norway. It was over quickly. The Norwegian government called a cease-fire with the terms offered by the Russians that only the northern half of the country to be occupied. The remainder became a Norwegian 'Vichy'. The few US Marines fled to Denmark with their surviving helicopters and Harriers as well as remnants of the Norwegian Air Force. While NATO was still discussing their reaction, the Russians made their next coup, demanding free passage for all shipping from Denmark. If this demand was met, the case would be settled and there would be peace. The Danes had a resolute Prime Minister who sent Moscow a package with a letter and a bottle: \"You can have this bottle of Danish beer for free, but not more.\" Author: Herman Hum Dawn Patrol (1975) The coast of Norway is made up of fjords and islands with high, rocky coasts. This is a perfect place for small surface craft to operate because the rock walls make them hard to spot on radar, and the short detection ranges make their smaller SSMs more useful than in the open ocean. Additionally, there are so many fjords and other places to hide such that no navy can afford enough large craft to do the job.

With the creation of the FES, it was used as a test group for integrating the operations of the ships belonging to the individual FES navies. StaNavForLant normally consists of five to six frigates, one from each NATO country, and an auxiliary ship. As the Soviets mobilized, StaNavForLant was assigned to the North Sea in search of a reported submarine.

In this engagement, a P-3 attacks a surface formation it has previously located.\" Author: Herman Hum Ambuscade for the Illustrious \"During the weeks of crisis prior to the war's outbreak, British naval forces began assembling into task groups, \"just in case the balloon goes up.\" As part of the process, intensive ASW exercises were held to shake down the units and get them used to working together. In peacetime, such surface forces are often trailed by hostile submarines. Both sides get to practice.\" Author: Herman Hum Power Sweep The war has not been kind to the Soviet navy; especially their submarine forces. In order to protect their remaining submarine units, the Soviets have been forced to begin escorting their less capable boats with first-line SSNs. In this engagement, a Soviet SSN is guarding two other units as they proceed south through the Norwegian Sea. Once the group has reached the Atlantic, the SSN will perform its own mission while the SS and SSGN attack surface shipping. First, though, NATO will try to stop them. Author: Dave Steinmeyer Whose Minefield? 'The Soviets have laid thousands of mines to protect the SSBN bastion and to attack NATO submarines trying to sink Russian ships in home waters. A few minefields are laid out as \"snorkeling-havens:\" boxes with one way in and out, known only to the Russians. Since a snorkeling sub is noisy, it can attract unwelcome attention, but this way it can proceed to one of these havens, snorkel, then proceed back to its station. Friendly fighters overhead protect against ASW aircraft and surface ships. A British submarine is going to try and make one haven a little less safe.' Author: Herman Hum Incoming Mail The Soviets have two weapons that can reach NATO convoys in the Atlantic: submarines and long-range aircraft. Long-range bombers on the Kola peninsula can easily hunt the Atlantic. With Iceland in Soviet hands, however, they can attack at will and their range would be greatly increased. A standard NATO convoy crossing the Atlantic would consist of 40-50 merchant ships. Eight to ten escorts and, if they are lucky, a helicopter carrier, will provide protection from submarine and air attack. Here, a large NATO convoy has been detected by a Soviet Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite (RORSAT) and Tu-95 Bear Ds are sent out to pinpoint their position. Following close behind the Bears are two squadrons of Backfire bombers. This could be a very bad day for NATO...

Its 20 ASW helicopters allowed it to smother any submarines it detected, and its own defenses combined with those of its escorts made it a difficult target. That didn't stop NATO from trying.\" Author: Herman Hum The Experiment \"After the first two weeks of the war, NATO planners had begun to worry about the submarine exchange ratio. It was higher than expected, and there was very little difference between the loss rates of the first- and second-line subs. No new weapons or equipment had been discovered, so the planners assumed that Soviet tactics were the cause. It has long been standard procedure for the Soviets to operate their boats in pairs. Several of the first-line boats that had been lost were last seen in an area where two Soviet boats were detected. As a test, two NATO submarines are being sent out together.\" Author: Herman Hum Lone Wolf Three NATO diesel submarines travelled north together, guarding each other during snorkelling periods. They had intended to conduct wolf pack operations near the Soviet sub base at Polyarnyy. They have been plagued by bad luck, however. First, one unit was sunk by a Tango-class SS before the other two could sink it. Then as they approached their objective, one of the remaining two boats hit a mine and was lost. The remaining ship, a Dutch Walrus-class, continued north and has run afoul of a coastal ASW group. Author: Dave Steinmeyer The Bastion 'NATO Intelligence has determined the possible locations of several Soviet SSBN patrol areas. One of the newest and best NATO submarines has been ordered to enter one zone, where a Typhoon-class SSBN is probably hiding. The patrol zone is located under the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ), in a minefield. The NATO sub is to destroy the sub and its escort, showing the Soviets that NATO is capable of beating its best in its home territory. The Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ) is an area of large ice floes covering roughly 75% of the sea surface. There is no possibility of air or surface units operating in these waters. The collision of ice chunks creates a high background noise, while their melting affects the local water salinity, which does strange things to sound beams. Additionally, the uneven underwater surface of the ice floes causes massive reverberations for active sonar.'

If the Soviet ships can get into launch position, they will conduct a coordinated strike with two regiments of Backfires flying from the Kamchatka Peninsula. The US commander must cripple the SAG before it gets within launch range and demonstrates both how the US Navy planned to deal with a Soviet SAG and how the Soviets planned to use layered defenses on their warships to defend against air attack. Author: Herman Hum The Night Before the Day After A crisis has developed between the Soviet Union and the West. The politico-military leadership of both sides is fearful of the threat posed by the other side's ballistic missile submarines.

Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"Northern Fleet headquarters had closely monitored the movements of the Forrestal task force in the Norwegian Sea. Based on the Bakan's reports, Obnorsky's fleet command post at Severomorsk (KPF) vectored two submarines -- an Oscar II-class SSGN and a Victor II-class SSN -- from positions east of Iceland into contact with the Forrestal task force.\" Author: Herman Hum Operation RINOK-CAD This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"Codenamed RINOK-CAD, the Soviet plan was designed to break the Lyngen position by preventing NATO reinforcement of the Fortress region and enveloping the left flank of the Norwegian defenses. The RINOK forces included the 76th Guards Airborne division, the Leningrad Military District's Air Assault Brigade (LAAB), and the 63rd Marine Brigade. The drop of the 76th Guards at Bodo would prevent the movement of reinforcements north along the E6 from southern Norway. The LAAB would seize the airfield at Evenes and the bridge at Skanland which connected the mainland to Hinnoy Island. The five battalions of the 63rd Marine Brigade would land on Hinnoy and capture the port of Harstad, link up with the air assault brigade, and mount a division-sized drive that would threaten both the port of Narvik and the airbase at Bardufoss. Soviet frontal aviation assets would attack northern Norwegian airbases both to reduce the sortie rate of NATO interceptors and to prevent the movement of reinforcements by air into the Fortress region. The Soviet Northern Fleet, after escorting the Marine Brigade to Harstad, would establish at least temporary control in the northern Norwegian Sea and prevent the landing of NATO amphibious forces in north Norway.\" Author: Herman Hum Knife-Fight This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"At 0315 on the 14th, after receiving a prearranged extra low frequency (ELF) radio message to begin hostilities, the Oscar fired a pair of Type-65 wake-homing torpedoes at the Forrestal at a range of forty-five miles... The Victor III evaded an attack by the John Rodger's SH-60B Seahawk LAMPS III, but was driven to the south of he American task force. Doing so put her squarely in the path of the Royal Navy SSN Talent. This Trafalgar-class nuclear attack boat had departed the 2nd Submarine Squadron base at Devonport, near Plymouth, on the morning of 11 July to reinforce NATO submarines already in the Norwegian Sea. At 0306 on the 14th, the Talent, trailing a communications buoy, had received a coded VLF message--hostilities had commenced. Aware that the course of the Forrestal task force would shortly converge with that of the Talent, Captain Alan Maunde, not eager to risk an attack by \"overanxious or jumpy American ASW types,\" decided to slow his passage north and allow the Americans to pass.\" Author: Herman Hum Bagel Station This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"Soviet anti-carrier doctrine called for coordinated strikes by surface groups, submarines, and land-based Soviet naval aviation forces. Badgers and Backfires would launch their air-to-surface missiles at maximum standoff range -- 100 to 250 miles. Soviet surface ships, in sensor contact with the American task force, would provide terminal guidance and direct the missiles to their targets. These surface ships, along with missile-armed Soviet submarines, would simultaneously launch attacks of their own. Combined action would thus flood American air, missile, and gun defenses, even the vaunted Aegis system, and destroy the targets. Unfortunately, in the Eastern Mediterranean combined action was impossible. The Soviet Defense Council had decided, at the recommendation of the Ministry of Defense, that the war would start at 0300 hours, central European time (0400 in the eastern Mediterranean).\" Author: Herman Hum Spanish Omelet This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A.

Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"As Soviet and Syrian forces battled the Americans and Israelis in the eastern Mediterranean, RADM Arkadi Filiminov's KPUG 2 initiated operations to secure the Aegean. At dawn, the Alligator-class amphibious transports Donetsky Shakhter and Alexsandr Tortsev began landing six hundred marines on the St. Barbara beach at Myrina, a small port on the west coast of Limnos. Overhead, specially modified army attack helicopters flying from the Moskva supported the invasion as the guns of the cruiser Ochakov pounded the old Genoese fort that overlooked the harbour. By noon, the island at the entrance to the Turkish Straits was in Soviet hands.\" \"As Filiminov left the bridge, he turned to CAPT Kamensky. 'We Russian officers,' he said, 'must always maintain our sense of the tragic.

Kamensky later found Filiminov's service revolver in his right hand; a small cross in his left.\" Author: Herman Hum Lock-On This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"Responsibility for the defense of western Libya-Tripolitania--rested primarily with the Libyan air arm. It was, on paper, a substantial force of more than 550 combat aircraft. But over 400 planes were in storage and many of the rest were flown by Syrian, North Korean, or Russian pilots. (The Soviets also controlled the extensive Libyan air defense system.) There were only about 75 fighters--miserable Su-20 Fitters and nearly obsolescent MiG-23 Floggers--combat ready in Tripolitania on the morning of D-Day. The Soviets promised to supply pilots and to fly in additional aircraft in the event of a crisis. But in the midst of a global war, neither the Soviet Union nor any of its surrogates could afford to send hundreds of skilled pilots to Libya. Over 200 NATO fighters and attack aircraft were available to \"take on\" the Libyans during the 14th. Rear Admiral Byrnes's Kennedy task group alone carried 86 aircraft including 20 F-14A Tomcats, 20 F/A-18 Hornets, and 20 A-6E Intruders, a force numerically equal, and qualitatively superior to the Libyan forces based around Tripoli. The dozen AV-8B Harriers on the Italian carrier Garibaldi, and the 16 Super Etendards and 10 Vought F-8E Crusaders of the French carrier Foch would be available to support the Kennedy's operations. NATO land-based air assets in Sicily included a dozen USMC F/A-18 Hornets at Sigonella, 32 F-16A Falcons of the USAF's 401 Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW), 612th Tactical Fighter Squadron, at Comiso (the wing's 613th and 614th TFSs were scheduled to arrive on the 15th and 16 respectively), 32 Italian F-104G Starfighters of 37 Stormo at Trapani, and 30 G 91Ys of 32 Stormo that had staged from their base at Brindisi to Cantania.\" Author: Herman Hum Turkey Trots to Water This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"In response, Seventh Fleet had concentrated formidable amphibious assets in WESTPAC. A sizable task force had concentrated at Okinawa -- fourteen ships capable of lifting twelve thousand marines of III MEF. Maritime Prepositioning Ships Squadron 3 lay anchored at Guam, loaded with equipment for 1 MEB, based in Hawaii (the 3rd Marines). A six-ship convoy carrying additional equipment and supplies for the marines was at sea about 750 miles south of Okinawa. If the Independence group moved north, only about a dozen frigates, an SSN, and three squadrons of patrol aircraft would remain to protect these assets. Cooper also worried that the Soviets might move their remaining surface assets from Vladivostok through the Tsushima Strait between Japan and Korea, link up with their KUG already in the East China Sea, and 'devastate our poorly screened amphibious forces as they clear Okinawa.' On the morning of 13 July, CINCPAC received a report from Japanese intelligence sources that a task force including the carrier Baku, two cruisers, a destroyer, four frigates, and several replenishment vessels would shortly depart Vladivostok. Unless the Japanese and South Koreans intervened, only limited American forces -- the four marine squadrons at Iwakuni, Japan, the SSN Tunny, and the old diesel boat Barbel -- were positioned to prevent a Soviet move through the Tsushima Strait. Despite his concerns, CINCPAC deferred to his subordinate's judgement. To Cooper's mind, Jernigan was responsible for operations in WESTPAC, and the decision was his call. Either choice involved risks, grave risks. No one knew what the Russians were going to do, or for that matter the Japanese or Koreans, north or south. But Cooper was a proponent of what he considered a cherished naval principle -- the initiative of the subordinate, trust and confidence. Cooper had no wish to overrule a subordinate's decision, especially one of his first decisions of a campaign. Cooper had known Jernigan for twenty years and had complete faith in him. So the Indy went north, not south.\" \"Shortly after 1100 Tokyo time (1500 at Pearl), reports of air battles over the Sea of Japan began to reach LTG James Bridges, Commander Fifth Air Force at his headquarters in Yokota, Japan. To the north, American F-16 Falcons of the 432nd Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW), based at Misawa in northern Honshu, and to the south, F/A-18 Hornets of Marine Aircraft Group 15, based at Iwakuni, engaged Soviet MiGs and Sukhois in aerial duels to control the air space to the west of the Japanese home islands. The marine and air force pilots found themselves outnumbered and hard pressed. At 1355, Bridges called GEN Henry Eustace, Commander, Pacific Air Forces, at Hickam AFB, Hawaii, over a secure telephone line and requested the release of the two squadrons of F-15 Eagles based at Kadena, Okinawa, which had heretofore been restricted to CAP missions between Japan and Taiwan. Bridges also recommended that Seventh Air Force assets in South Korea be fed into the battle. Eustace promptly gave Bridges complete authority over the 18th TFW at Kadena, but, fearing a North Korean attack across the DMZ, PACAIRFOR, with CINCPAC's approval, continued to hold the South Korea-based Seventh Air Force's 314th Air Division in reserve.\" \"Turkey trots to water GG From CinCPac action Com Third Fleet info ComInCh CTF Seventy-Seven X Where is RPT Where is Task Force Thirty-Four RR The world wonders\" Author: Herman Hum Operations Plan 220-90 This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"OPLAN 220-90 called for U.S. forces throughout the Pacific Command (PACOM) to initiate conventional offensive and defensive operations against Soviet units and against the Soviet Union itself. The plan assumed that neither power, at least initially, would have the assistance of its allies, other than the use of foreign facilities, such as Soviet bases in Vietnam and American bases in Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines.\" \"Thus, on D-Day the Soviets began not a military, but diplomatic and public affairs offensives in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, and Taiwan. Soviet diplomats entreated and threatened each of these countries to remain neutral and to forbid the operations of American forces from their soil. Other Soviet officials, local communists, and their supporters initiated campaigns designed to divide public opinion and to persuade East Asians that they ought not to allow themselves to be dragged into a European war by the United States.\" \"The Soviets gained even greater success on D Day in the North Pacific. Several hours before hostilities began, Bear reconnaissance aircraft located four American frigates convoying six container ships about nine hundred miles southeast of Hokkaido along the Seattle-Yokohama sealift route. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, the Pacific Fleet KPF vectored air, surface, and subsurface assets -- the Novorossiysk-Kalinin group, a Foxtrot, an Akula, and SNA Backfires and Badgers -- into strike positions. The attacks began at 1330 and lasted for three hours. All ten American ships were sunk. The Soviets lost neither a ship, a plane, nor a submarine. ADM Ushakov saw the sharp engagement as a vindication of his strategic ideas for Pacific operations. 'This battle was,' he reported to the general staff, 'a classic example of our combined naval doctrine and the most successful engagement fought by our naval forces on D Day, anywhere. For CINCPAC, the convoy debacle was one of those events in life that suddenly bring everything into sharp focus. The loss of the container ships, loaded with ordnance and spare parts for air force squadrons in Japan, placed an immediate burden on American air transport assets which had to be shifted from other missions to fly supplies to the western Pacific. The Soviet success also demonstrated the dangers of operating without air cover. ADM Cooper immediately saw the wisdom of ADM Jernigan's strategy. Allied land-based air assets in South Korea and Japan blocked the movement of Soviet strike aircraft to the south and to the east. Their only way out was to the north -- between Hokkaido and Kamchatka. The only way to plug the gap was with naval air. Fortunately, Jernigan has his carriers closing in perfectly -- the Kitty Hawk coming down from the Aleutians, and the Independence coming up from Yokosuka. But Cooper remained concerned: could two carriers fight their way into the gap and close it?\" Author: Herman Hum Hemphill's Ordeal This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"About a dozen Soviet submarines of various types, both diesel and nuclear-powered, lay athwart the sea lanes leading toward the Norwegian Sea. The Soviet Northern Fleet staff had charged its submarines with three tasks: reconnaissance for long-range SNA strikes, delaying the movement north of key American convoys and task forces, and attacking NATO ships and installations with torpedoes and missiles. The Soviets had far better success with more traditional attacks. In the first twenty-four hours of the war, Soviet submarines and strike aircraft sank nearly half of the twenty-five ships in four convoys steaming for north Norway. By the evening of the 14th, one American destroyer, five frigates, and five freighters were at the bottom of the North Atlantic.\" Author: Herman Hum Get the Tbilisi This scenario is an interpretation of the account from Michael A. Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"... A large convoy of eight Soviet cargo vessels carrying supplies and equipment had rounded the North Cape and was making its way to Harstad. Attack NATO aircraft were driven off by the Tbilisi's Flankers and Forgers. The Soviet carrier had covered the landing of the Northern Fleet's Marines at Harstad and seemed likely to safeguard the movement of the brigade's equipment and supplies to the newly established beachhead as well. Moreover, the carrier's fighters hindered movement by air of Norwegian reinforcements from the south to Bardufoss. To Sir Owen, the continued presence of the Tbilisi in the Norwegian Sea ensured early defeat for NATO in north Norway. 'I would never have believed before the war', he confided to his naval aide, 'that one relatively small carrier could cause so many large problems.' At 0430 on the fifteenth of July, a tired GEN Peirse call CINCEASTLANT Hill-Norton at his Northwood, Middlesex, headquarters and explained the situation. 'Ben, your subs have got to get that Russian carrier out of there so my air can get to their cargo ships. Otherwise, we're facing disaster up north. My Norwegian boats can't do it alone.' Hill-Norton was sympathetic. The ability of the Tbilisi's air group to fend off attacks from NATO land-based air and the Forrestal had surprised the Royal Navy's CINC, upset a variety of plans, and led to the wholesale destruction of Norwegian surface forces. 'Yes,' Hill-Norton responded, 'if we are going to get that carrier any time soon, our submarines will have to do the job. I'll talk to Dave.'\" \"... Following the successful Soviet amphibious landing at Harstad, [Dave] Livesay had directed his submarines to focus their efforts against the well-screen Soviet supply convoy making its way along the Norwegian coast. Many of his submarines had been drawn inward toward the coast in an unsuccessful last-ditch attempt to prevent the amphibious landing on Hinnoy Island. Others had sparred, with some success, throughout D day with the Russian ASW group which screened the Tbilisi force further north. Later-arriving boats had been sent toward the North Cape, to loop around the rear of the powerful Russian task forces covering the approach of the supply convoy, and to get at the freighters, the sinking of which Hill-Norton himself had assigned top priority.\" By 0600 on the fifteenth, several NATO SSNs had managed to make shallow runs and \"pick up their mail,\" as one U.S. Navy submarine commander put it.

Palmer's, \"The War that Never Was\". \"On the fifteenth, Turner used the Kennedy, supported by the French carrier Foch and NATO land-based aircraft flying from Sicily and southern Italy, to continue the aerial offensive against enemy bases along the northern coast of Libya. Italian and American ASW groups, and French, Italian, and American submarines screened the carriers and allied amphibious task forces from Soviet and Libyan submarines. A five-frigate ASW task force screening the southern flank of the NATO forces bore the brunt of Libyan and Soviet attacks during the fifteenth.\" Author: Herman Hum Act of Chapultepec Mid-April, the world was stunned by testimony before the United Nation by the Governor of the Falklands. Under questioning, he revealed that Argentina had in fact been granted a permit to land on East Falklands and dismantle the old whaling station. Argentina invoked the 1946 Act of Chapultepec, which called on all American states to jointly defend against outside aggression. Britain's declaration of an exclusion zone was said to qualify for such a case. The USA declared themselves neutral; Brazil and Venezuela quickly indicated their support for Argentina. With the Task force approaching the South Atlantic, the military situation had radically changed. Author: Freek Schepers Advance Subs After the surprise Argentine invasion of the Falklands Islands, the British Defence ministry urgently ordered available Royal Navy units to the area. As had been the case in earlier times of tensions, Britain's nuclear attack submarines, travelling continuously at high speed, would be the first warships on station. The arrival of the first submarines enabled the MoD to announce a 200nm exclusion zone around the Falkland Islands. Argentina, meanwhile, was using her navy to reinforce the garrison in the Malvinas and to establish a blocking force for any early British units. Author: Freek Schepers Advance Guards After the surprise Argentine invasion of the Falklands Islands, the British Defence ministry urgently ordered available Royal Navy units to the area. A mixed destroyer/frigate squadron with attached support ships had just finished operation Springtrain around Gibraltar.

Argentina, meanwhile, was using her navy to reinforce the garrison in the Malvinas and to establish a blocking force for any early British units. Author: Freek Schepers South Georgia One of the first tasks of the Falkland Task Force was the liberation of South Georgia. This was considered both a practice step for the Falklands liberation, and an essential first goal to secure safe anchorages for the many support ships that were needed by the Task force. Author: Freek Schepers Vulcan April 1982. Argentine forces had invaded the Falkland Islands. Britain needed an answer. And fast. The idea was simple: to destroy the vital landing strip at Port Stanley. The reality was more complicated. The only aircraft that could possibly do the job was three months from being scrapped, and the distance it had to travel was four thousand miles beyond its maximum range. It would take fifteen Victor tankers and seventeen separate in-flight refuelings to get one Avro Vulcan B2 over the target, and give the crew any chance of coming back alive.

To demonstrate the vulnerability of the UK supply line, an Argentine SAG is going to intercept a British reinforcement group en route from Ascension to the Falklands.

Author: Herman Hum Belgrano The sinking of the General Belgrano on May 2nd 1982 caused the single heaviest loss of the Falklands war. HMS Conqueror showed that Argentinean escorts could not prevent nuclear subs from killing their ships. As a direct result of this attack, the Argentine aircraft carrier 'Veinticinco de Mayo', which had successfully detected the Task Force with her Trackers and was preparing a strike with her A-4Q Skyhawks, returned to port and played no further part in the conflict. Author: Freek Schepers MayDay First of May 1982 was when hostilities finally broke out around the Falklands. South Georgia had been liberated by the British and, early in the morning, a lone Vulcan bomber cut the runway at Port Stanley in half. The Argentineans had their army dug in around the Falklands, had attack planes dispersed around the islands, and the Air force and Navy were ready to meet the British forces. In the next three days, the General Belgrano and Sheffield were lost, air attacks proved the effectiveness of the Sea Harriers and SAMs; but also demonstrated their limitations and damaged many ships in the task force. Victory could go either way. Author: Freek Schepers Pebble Island During the night of May 14th, 1982; SAS commandoes intended to attack the airfield on Pebble Island. The raid was to be carried out via helicopter from HMS Hermes, which had detached from the CVBG during the night to steam towards Pebble Island with a small escort. While the force was still 6 hours away from their attack, American SIGINT was received which indicated that the Argentinean aircraft carrier Veinticinco de Mayo had evaded British submarines and entered the 200nm exclusion zone. A unique carrier battle was now brewing.... Author: Freek Schepers Sea King to Chile Incident One of the most mysterious events of the war happened on May 16th, when a Sea King was found burning and abandoned near Punta Arenas airbase. The British claimed a 500nm navigation error but, after the war, it became clear that SAS Special Forces had been planning a raid to take out the Exocet-armed Super Etendard aircraft which had sunk Sheffield and Atlantic Conveyor. Speculation on the nature of this operation still ranges from SAS-Hercules aircraft landing on Rio Grande airbase in order to destroy the planes on the ground to the setting up of covert radar facilities to provide early warning for the fleet. Fact is that Chile felt it was the next target of the Argentine junta and, therefore, open to cooperation with the British. Author: Freek Schepers Mid-Atlantic By mid-May, frantic preparations had been made for the amphibious landings on the Falklands. 5th Infantry Brigade had left Southampton on the QEII May 11th with her equipment being carried on the Baltic Ferry. Forty RFA and merchant ships sailed south to support the fleet. The key strategic asset was Ascension Island; used to launch the Vulcan Black Buck missions, cross-deck and train troops, and to replenish ships. The ships and troops needed to sail south at maximum speed to support the fleet and the upcoming amphibious landings. Author: Freek Schepers The Supply War By the 20th of May, there were strong indications that invasion was imminent. Destroyers had shelled Argentine coastal garrisons and rumours were rampant that SAS troops were on the ground. During the night, an Argentine freighter was shelled by an unknown British warship in Falkland Sound. The success of the invasion would depend largely on the British ability to re-supply the beachhead; dependant upon a supply line stretching 8000nm between the UK and the Falklands and maintained by 50 ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and a selection of leased merchant ships whose crew were being paid 150% danger pay. San Carlos By the 20th of May, there were strong indications that invasion was imminent. Destroyers had shelled Argentine coastal garrisons and rumours were rampant that SAS troops were on the ground. During the night, an Argentine freighter was shelled by an unknown British warship in Falkland Sound. By daybreak, Argentinean observation posts saw the amphibious force steam into San Carlos waters. Author: Freek Schepers Independence Day On May 25th, Argentina's Independence day, the Argentine Air Force made another all-out attack on the amphibious ships in Falkland Sound. The near suicidal bravery of the Argentine pilots had sunk Sheffield and Ardent, and hit Argonaut, Glasgow, Antrim, Brilliant, and Broadsword with bombs that failed to explode. The BBC broadcast a review last night which included the statement that many bombs did not explode as their arming wires were too short for the altitudes from which they were dropped. Argentine armourers are sure to be resolving this problem. The British also started to realise that a great deal of planning preceded each Argentine attack and that Exocet missiles were generally aimed at Carriers while planes armed with bombs and rockets sought out Amphibs and warships. Decoy flights designed to draw CAP away from target areas are also employed by the FAA. Author: Freek Schepers Beachhead Breakout Almost a week after the initial landings on San Carlos, UK forces broke out of their beachhead. 2nd Para captured Goose Green in a daring raid and 42 Commando started moving east towards Port Stanley while 5th Infantry Brigade was being unloaded and supplied. A severe weather front forced most amphibious ships to withdraw to open seas and grounded all air operations. Most troops on the ground saw this as a much-needed interruption from the continuous Argentine air attacks. Author: Freek Schepers Bluff Cove On June 8 1982, one of the most tragic events of the Falklands war took place. Two amphibious ships embarked with the Welsh Guards were taking too long to unload at Bluff Cove and, when daylight broke, were found and bombed by the Argentine air force with heavy loss of life. Later investigations speak of inter-service rivalry between the British forces, and of a blatant disregard of the basic principles of amphibious operations. Author: Freek Schepers Parting Gift Just before the final surrender of Argentine troops in Port Stanley, Britain receives word of frantic activity at Argentina's nuclear facilities. The US Air Force Space Command reports the test firing of a Condor II Argentine Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile has taken place with the missile passing over the Argentine tracking station in Kings Bay, Antarctica. Britain decides that it must act to pre-empt desperate last-minute Argentine actions. Author: Freek Schepers Between a Rock and a Hard Place On May 1, 1982 Exocet missiles fired by Argentine Air Force Super-Etendard aircraft sank HMS Sheffield and set fire to HMS Invincible. That same afternoon, a full squadron of Mirage IIIE overwhelmed Hermes' Sea Harriers (mostly by forcing them to Bingo) and 8 Navy Skyhawks from CV Veinticinco de Mayo carried out a mission for which they had been training months prior. Flying at very low altitude and using a makeshift datalink to a Russian Tu-142 Bear MPA circling the British TF, they knew that the Type 42's Sea Dart missiles cannot lock-on. Using modified Mk83 fuses that explode when dropped from as low as 30m, eight A4s made a devastating attack and put 3x 1000lb bombs through HMS Hermes' flight deck. After burning for hours, HMS Hermes sank during the night and, with HMS Invincible damaged, the chance of a quick liberation of the Falklands was lost. Follow-up attacks by Daggers were unopposed by Sea Harriers and damaged 4 more ships the next day. The British Task Force withdrew to the safety of Ascension Island and limited itself to a blockade of the Argentine ports and preventing Argentine re-supply of the Falklands through the nuclear submarines on patrol within the TEZ. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher maintained publicly that the Falklands would never be given up and swore to avenge the hundreds of British casualties. She ordered a crash program to re-commission HMS Bulwark or commission HMS Illustrious with RAF Harriers. To provide early warning and air defense, the UK started discussions with USA, Australia, and Brazil to lease a full-sized aircraft carrier and equip it with Harriers, Phantoms, and/or Gannets if pilots could be found with recent deck landing experience. By the end of May, Britain presented evidence of the Russian Bear's role in the attack on HMS Hermes and announced the extension of the TEZ to include all Russian forces. In response, Russia started to strengthen their base in Luanda with long-range bombers and sent part of their Indian Ocean squadron to the South Atlantic Author: Freek Schepers Malvinas III (2012) After normalisation of the relationship between Argentina and Britain in the 90s, tension returned in 2012. Economic pressures and publication of 30-year old secret documents fueled nationalism in both countries. The press was rife with \"analysis\" of how the retirement of Britain's carriers and Harriers would make fighting a new Falkland war impossible. Opposing views held that the ground-based radars, Typhoons, and permanent presence of 1200 infantry and SAMs (vs 60 marines in 1982) as well as the presence of Royal Navy ships would either deter or defeat invaders until reinforcements arrived by air. Author: Freek Schepers TRADE BARRIER The rise of the European Community in the mid-1990's had a dramatic effect on the political and economic divisions in the world. Following the prolonged recessionary period which ran rampant throughout the world during the early 90's, the EC was the first economic body to rebound and the recovery was astonishing. What some felt was retribution towards the United States for \"forty years of tyranny,\" the Community took steps to ensure that the Western Hemisphere took a back seat to the new world economic superpower. Soon enough, the EC's actions against the United States and Canada led to dissension within the EC itself. Britain, still closely tied to its allies in the West, continued to ignore Continental demands to isolate the USA. Over the next several months, a new alliance slowly developed between those English-speaking nations of the world which retained close cultural links to the United Kingdom; Britain, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia, along with several smaller associates. The English Speakers Community, or ESC as it was named, thought still somewhat weaker than the overly aggressive EC, began an assertive campaign to recapture the world economic market. In the middle sat the Russian Confederation, replacing the dead Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia was a vast, untouched market for the goods of either alliance. The EC was first to initiate open trade with their one-time enemy. Unspoken agreements became the basis for the EC's demands that the ESC remain out of northern Asia. The Russians, however, began to feel trapped in bargains and understandings to which they had never given assent. Moscow, dedicated to remaining neutral in the developing struggle between Europe and the West, announced it would send a \"trade convoy\" to America as a move to open new markets for its own goods. The EC was furious and announced that such a convoy would be in violation of trade agreements. The move was seen as an affront to \"Russia's European brothers,\" and that force would be used, if necessary, to prevent the West from receiving \"European\" trade goods. Russia's only response was silence and a large military escort for the ships. Author: Herman Hum ALONE IN THE SNOW Sweden's neutrality lasted only as long as the Reformed Russian Republic had no need of anything that Sweden had and not a moment longer. The determined resistance of the United States' 1st Special Forces put the R3 theatre commander behind schedule by 36 hours. Behind schedule has never been a comfortable place for a Russian Commander and this commander was determined to be uncomfortable only for a very short period of time. His plan to get things moving again involved turning Norway's southern flank. But, in order to do that, staging bases closer than Germany were required. Unfortunately for Sweden, bases that fit the bill were Swedish. The remaining life of Sweden's neutrality was measured in hours. NATO wanted to provide assistance. The problem was, other than providing advanced warning of the attack, NATO had nothing to give. The few remaining Norwegian F-16s could not be re-oriented to cover Swedish airspace without leaving the northern FEBA vulnerable. CENTAF simply had no aircraft to spare. RAF operational reserves had been released to guard the northern approaches to the UK. The German air force ceased to exist as an effective fighting force 90 seconds after the first shots were fired. Combined chemical, biological, and conventional missile, artillery, and air attacks have a tendency to do that. Although alone in the snow, the Swedes were not without hope. Sweden had been neutral. Sweden had not been stupid. Sweden's defense expenditures had increased from 2.9% of GNP in 1987 to 4.5% of GNP in 1996. A large portion of that money was spent on the procurement of Viggens, Sweden's latest multi-role fighter aircraft. It was with the Viggens that this battle would turn. Author: Herman Hum GUARDIAN The events leading to the reformation of the old Soviet Union were numerous, anticipated by many, observed by many more, fatal for some and potentially deadly for the world. But famine, civil unrest, martial law, and dictators almost always are. The Reformed Russian Republic was neither reformed nor a republic. But it was Russian. Very Russian. Seventeen months after the Marshals dissolved the Politburo, shot the President, and invited the Supreme Soviet to reconvene in a much cooler climate; the military machine that had been built by paranoid fathers and unleashed by older, misguided brothers was freed and pointed west. The time had come for the investment in tanks, ships, and aircraft to be redeemed. Since the initiation of hostilities on 4 Feb, 1997, the R3 navy has enjoyed great success. Naval aviation attacks on Keflavik paved the way for a successful airborne assault. Andoya and Bodo in Norway soon followed. With newly liberated air bases allowing almost full coverage of the North Sea, the waters and skies north of England have become very unfriendly for Allied ships and aircraft. All of NATO's carriers and most NATO major surface combatants have been withdrawn to the North Atlantic to ensure the security of the sea lanes of communication. NATO command was willing to trade control of the North Sea for a period of time for a much better chance of getting the convoys of troops, tanks, and munitions that CENTAG would require across the grey seas from America to Europe. Protection of NATO's north-eastern flank has fallen primarily to air power. Of the northern NATO bases, only Stornoway has remained operational. NATO's other air bases have fallen victim to standoff attacks from the Keflavik Bears, Badgers, and Backfires or to R3 surface action groups. NATO command's decision to re-deploy the majority of US air assets to bases in southern England to better support CENTAG has left only the RAF. The Air Vice-Marshall released the remaining reserves of the 41st Squadron and the 12th Squadron to provide tactical flexibility. A credible strike force could be mounted from Stornoway. Original author: Delwin Hinkle\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum IN EVERY CLIME AND PLACE The war between the CIS and NATO has been raging for three weeks with the CIS gaining the upper hand with their swift conquest of the nations surrounding the Norwegian Sea. Gaining access to the Atlantic in this manner, many of their hunter-killer submarine groups have been able to sortie thus harassing NATO convoys and wreaking havoc with NATO's wartime plans. SACEur has had enough and finally convinces the USN to launch an amphibious invasion of Norway to stop the flow of subs that are sinking his supplies! In order to pull off such a daring invasion, a CVBG is pulled from escort duty and ordered to soften up the air power that the CIS has built up in Norway. The USN also pulls together all of its newest ships in the 'Gator navy. Finally, the AV-8B Harrier II+ is embarked on the Wasp-class ships. This will prove to be its debut in combat. There is little time left for NATO. At the rate the CIS subs are sinking convoys, NATO won't last another two weeks. This invasion must be successful! Author: Herman Hum PLUG THE DIKE The success of the Reformed Russian Republic in Norway increased the importance of supply interdiction in the Baltic Sea. The logistical requirements of the R3 army were enormous. Tons of supplies attempted to make transit of the shallow waters between Denmark and Norway. The threat to these small convoys was limited in scope. Because of the success of R3 airfield strikes, the NATO aircraft that remained had adopted a defensive posture, awaiting reinforcements. The few offensive missions that NATO launched were primarily offensive counter-air and aimed at the R3 air bases. Convoys of five to seven ships were just too far down the list to merit much air attention. The small missile boats of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany performed in the opening days of the war exactly as had been anticipated. They ducked out of hiding, acquired targets for their Harpoons and Otomats, launched their attacks, and died. R3 commanders used this opportunity to try and move small quantities of sensitive materials back to research installations in the East. Only submarines remain to oppose them. Quiet and small, if employed correctly, they are very hard to detect. The departure of the front-line R3 ASW units to the front as escorts for the R3 Carrier Battle Groups increased their effectiveness. Plugging the choke points out of the Denmark Sea provides the best opportunity to stop the transit of materials in this area. Original author: Delwin Hinkle\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum NAVAL INFANTRY The war between NATO and the CIS is in full swing, but neither side has gained an advantage over the other. CIS submarines have done well against NATO shipping, but CIS ground forces in Europe have not matched the successes of their naval cousins. The CIS surface fleet has been kept in reserve since the leadership knows that the NATO surface combatants are more powerful than they. Early on in the war planning, it was decided that the surface fleet would be used only on special missions and recalled as quickly as possible. While this theory goes against traditional doctrine, its advantage of keeping the fleet ready to respond to threats instead of sunk is appealing to many Admirals. Therefore, the brunt of the battle was borne initially by submarines. That is about to change. While it is true that the CIS fleet is still floating, the folly of not using it has led in many ways to the current stalemate. To break the stalemate, CIS military leaders have decided to launch a two-pronged invasion of Norway. This is called Operation Overpower. Naval air has sunk most of the Norwegian surface fleet and no large NATO surface groups are near Norway. So, the fleet assembles a huge amphibious assault force and puts to sea with a heavy escort. The amphibious invasion is to coincide with an invasion from the border area. If Bodo can be taken and held for a week, the two prongs will link up and form a new threat against mainland Europe. As for the Norwegians, they are caught in the middle. Their Air Force has been decimated and is nearly non-existent and their surface fleet is gone. All that is left are three small submarines. While not much, it is hoped that these three subs will be enough to discourage any further action from the sea. Original author: Mark R. Lam\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum LEND-LEASE 1994 The Second Russian Revolution was not the last -- most analysts knew this. The shaky economy the Yeltsin government inherited would not be easily fixed and a people with newly found rights had a tendency to complain and even defy. However, a disenchanted populace was not the major problem. When high-ranking military leaders decided that the new government could not manage the economy and ensure the survival of the Russian Federation, they acted. The Coup of 1994 was much better planned than its predecessor. There were no protests in the streets of Moscow and the propaganda campaign which the military broadcast convinced much of the citizenry that perhaps the generals were right. However, everyone did not give up and when the northern regions of Russia began open conflict with the new government, the West responded with aid. The United States sent a CV Battle Group to the region and eventually began conducting strikes in support of the growing Freedom Front. When the NSC agreed that troops should be landed to support the rebellion, the US leaders could not stop their plans with the damage of the carrier. The landing must continue.

In the confusion during the change of government from communism to democracy and back to communism controlled by military leaders, a general war is started against NATO countries. Two key naval units, though, aren't told in time. The Admiral Gorshkov and the Chernova Ukraina are still docked in the Baltic shipyards. Though the whole world is caught off guard, the German Navy puts up whatever patrols it can. Most units are sunk in the initial attack, but once the situation was stabilized, a few subs and surface groups were able to take positions in the Baltic. The two capital units of the Soviet Northern Fleet are caught between a rock and a hard place. They sail, knowing the hell that awaits them as they try to manoeuvre through the narrow straits between Denmark and Norway. Once free, though, there will be clear sailing to Murmansk as the USN and RN are not in position to do anything about it. So, the challenge is there. Are the Soviet ships up to it? Original author: Mark R. Lam\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum ANGLO-EUROPEAN WAR The EC was the first economic system to recover from the World Recession of the 90's. However, the advantage gained was short-lived, with the US economic situation strengthening rapidly. European leaders understood that if the US was to regain its advantage in economics held since the Second World War, the European nations would continue to live under the iron fist of North American dominance. They decided that things must change. When the complete ban on trade with North America was passed in several legislatures of the EC nations, the world was aghast. In effect, the EC declared Cold War on America and the results would be nothing short of destructive. The war which followed, however, originated from an unusual direction. Great Britain refused to pass the non-trade agreement and began unrestricted, even forced, trade with the United States. The US quietly rendezvoused with British shipping in the mid-Atlantic and escorted the trade ships across the sea. The Americans knew that they would be in a position of authority shortly and chose not to rustle the European feathers until such time. But, the Continental EC would have none of this. Demands for British acceptance of the trade pact were fierce, but unheeded. The French were the first to respond. If the British would not freely accept the trade pact, they would be forced to adhere. Author: Herman Hum MATRIX SHIELD Baltic Sea game of cat and mouse.

Author: Herman Hum PROJECT PENINSULA 94 Peninsula 94 is a series of 4 related scenarios (Recon, Ingress, Strike Ops, and Egress) representing different phases of a US multi-carrier battle group attack on the Kola Peninsula. From the Russian perspective, this is the mission the navy has trained for since its beginning: defense of the homeland. These scenarios are related by a common order of battle and a concurrence of mission. Any discrepancies can be attributed to poor bomb damage assessment and better than expected damage control. They should be played in order and from the same side to appreciate the developing momentum an operation of this magnitude has. Reconnaissance: From the NATO perspective, this scenario is a submariner's delight. A force of SSNs must enter Russian waters and conduct an intelligence sweep of the area prior to the arrival of the CVBG. This scenario is going to require discipline and restraint on the part of the NATO player if he hopes to be successful in the overall strategy. Many targets of opportunity may present themselves, but adherence to the Rules of Engagement is the only way to win. From the Russian perspective, it's only a matter of time. Much of the fleet has been forced to retreat out of the North Atlantic and is now trying to re-group in the Norwegian Sea. The next logical step for NATO is an attack on the Kola Peninsula by a large CVBG which would surely be preceded by a submarine force to gather intelligence. This scenario is a large-scale ASW operation with a wrinkle, that being several unescorted capital ships in transit to re-organization points. The challenge here is force allocation. With limited first-line ASW assets, hard choices will have to be made and risks taken. Original author: BI Hutchison\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum Ingress: This phase of the operation is probably the most nerve-wracking on a battle group command staff. Discovery now could mean fighting all the way to the target area and facing an alert enemy, or the cancellation of the mission, altogether. Emission control and long-range ASW operations are the order of the day. Russian search activity can be expected to increase as you close on the target. This scenario is primarily an escort mission and an exercise in staging. All capital ships must make it to their assigned operating area with time-on-station requirements. From the Russian perspective, this is an offensive submarine operation. Any battle group attempting an attack on the Kola Peninsula has to enter very heavily travelled submarine routes and should be susceptible to detection. A creditable air component will be available to prosecute any surface contacts, although particular attention should be given to support groups. This scenario is designed to illustrate that there is more than one way to skin a cat. The Russian will be tempted to attack the first contact which will be heavily defended. The key here is the support group. Get to them and the operation is over. Original author: BI Hutchison\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum Strike Operations This is pay dirt for US forces: conduct large-scale strike operations against the home of the Red Banner Fleet. While the mission is straight-forward, this scenario promises to be a case study in contingency planning as situations change quickly in a high-threat environment. Asset allocation and formation rotation is the key to survival for surface elements in this scenario. To be successful in the strike arena of this scenario, solid adherence to the fundamentals is vital. Any deviation may have catastrophic effects on the overall plan as a carrier is useless without its aircraft. From the Russian perspective, coastal defense has been the heart of fleet planning since its inception, though it was always expected that more high-value assets would be available for the task. The player will be expected to focus remaining assets in defense of land-based facilities. The nuclear option is available. Since no single group has the striking power to penetrate a CVBG defensive screen, coordination is the key in offensive operations. Original author: BI Hutchison\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum Egress For NATO, it's time to withdraw. Relentless attacks have begun to take their toll as casualties mount and magazines are down to their last reloads. Russian defenses are well aware of your approximate position and attacks are growing in size and determination. Speed is life. Return to safer waters as soon as possible. The air defense network is now operational at Keflavik, so air support will be available. This scenario will illustrate the difficulties a battle group commander will face in fighting a rear-guard action against a force receiving reinforcements. Deception should play a critical part of any strategy. Survival of the carriers is critical to future operations. From the Russian perspective, revenge is the order of the day. Attacks by US forces have done grave damage to Red Banner Fleet facilities and eliminated much of the high-level command staff in the area. The President has committed the bulk of the naval aviation reserves in an attempt to punish the Americans. A nuclear strike is authorized, though only with cruise missiles. Any use of ballistic missiles may precipitate escalation. Early destruction of the American carriers will avert escalation so time is of the essence. Original author: BI Hutchison\n\nAuthor: Herman Hum Pirates The Malakka strait, Sunda Strait, and Java Sea are notorious Pirate waters. Attacks have increased to over 200 per year. Often crews of attacked vessels are put overboard, the ship is quickly searched for valuables, and then sunk. Many pirates are individual criminals, but organised gangs have emerged who have excellent Intell, and have purchased some of the hundreds of obsolete Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Australian 1960s and 1970s gunboats. While Pirates have no chance against modern naval ships, the Navies in the region have other priorities; and rumour has it that some Pirate gangs are headed by ex-navy personnel. With over 50.000 ships passing the Malakka Strait annually of which 2000 are Ultra Large Crude Carriers, private enterprise has stepped in with the creation of the United Escort Service. Author: Freek Schepers Operation Jaya Winjaya When Indonesia became independent in 1949, The Netherlands held onto New Guinea, a vast island group in the east of the archipelago. The Netherlands maintained permanent army (KNIL), navy, and air force units on the islands. In the early 1960s, President Soekarno started guerrilla operations against the British in Malaysia and against the Dutch in New Guinea to force them to relinquish their colonies. Indonesia built up its military with modern Russian weapons and, in 1961, Indonesia had the strongest air force in the Southern Hemisphere while The Netherlands post-war economic position had allowed it only limited military investments. A visit of the Dutch aircraft carrier \"Karel Doorman\" to the region in 1961 inflamed the situation and serious incidents started the next year. In March of 1962, Dutch patrol planes sank an Indonesian Schooner and, in July, Dutch destroyers sank the Indonesian torpedo-boat Matjan Tutul carrying soldiers to New Guinea. Dutch Neptunes intercepted and shot down some of the Mitchell bombers and Dakotas dropping paras in company strength in the jungle. During the summer, a bloody guerrilla war started between these para's and Dutch Marines in the jungle of New Guinea. Politically, the Soviet Union was rattling its sabre in Cuba, Vietnam, and gave overt support to Indonesia (including supplying crews to Indonesia's newly built submarines). President Kennedy was very worried about the threat of Soviet influence in Indonesia with its strategic sea lanes. The Dutch Prime minister de Quai and his foreign minister Luns refused to negotiate with Soekarno and tried to make New Guinea a UN-protectorate only to face a Russian veto. Finally, in August of 1962, Soekarno gave orders for the liberation of New Guinea by force through operation Jaya Wijaya. Merchant ships and the Indonesian navy formed up east of the Celebes and the Indonesian Air Force was deployed to forward bases. Still, the newly formed Indonesian navy faced a small, though battle-hardened Dutch navy. The operation was by no means a sure thing. This changed when Russia deployed Badger bombers and long-range submarines and dressed up their crews as Indonesian 'volunteers'. The Netherlands had good intelligence, Dutch submarines had crossed the Pacific, and, for the first time in decades, the Netherlands sent conscript troops to defend the colonies. On August 18th, Prime Minister de Quai gave in under severe pressure from President Kennedy and agreed to hand over New Guinea to Indonesia later that year. This scenario investigates what would have happened if the Netherlands would have let the conflict erupt. Soekarno had already ordered his invasion fleet to sail from the Celebes and, although some sources maintain Soekarno had not yet achieved the 3:1 superiority in forces required, the Russian forces would have played a decisive role in the battle.

The Soviet General Staff has decided that the time is ripe for a world-wide Communist revolution. Soviet forces are inciting revolutions and conflict world-wide providing propaganda, arms, and advisers. Author: Fred Galano Siberia In the decade since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the world has occasionally heard rumours of Nukes being smuggled out of the former USSR. Most experts believe the public has only seen a fraction of what has really happened. Two month ago, officials of the PRC notified the IAEA in Vienna that they had intercepted a \"suitcase-sized nuclear device\" being smuggled out of the Far East Russian Millitary District into China. Last week, the PLAN boarded a Russian freighter which had left Vladivostock and was entering the Yellow Sea. Aboard, they discovered a 155mm nuclear artillery shell. Immediately, China demanded from the Russian government a commitment to take \"Public, Swift, and Verifiable steps to conform fully to draft resolution 3454 or face the consequences imposed by an international coalition of countries dedicated to non-proliferation of WMDs.\" Russia has publicly denounced the ultimatum as \"a declaration of war\".

Pinatubo covered Clark AFB in the Philippines, it signaled the end of US protection of this nation. By 2008, the Philippine Air Force had no operational jet fighters and its Navy had not acquired SAM- or SSM-armed ships. Insurgents and terrorist groups made good use of the stricken military and, by 2008, the Philippines opened discussions with China, Japan, and Korea on military and economic cooperation. The Philippines' closest neighbours, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei, perceived a repeat of the WWII invasion threat from the north and each decided to widen their spheres of influence.

In August 1999, the citizenry overwhelmingly voted for independence, and, almost immedately afterwards, Indonesian-backed militia bacame active. By September, 250.000 people had fled the killings. In September, President Habibi of Indonesia finally agreed to the deployment of a multinational UN-peacekeeping force in East Timor so long as it was primarily Asian troops. While US, New Zealand, Italian, Singapore, Malaysian, and Norwegian troops began the long preparations for deployment, Australia was ready and an amphibious convoy put to sea. Indonesia objected strongly to this breach of the agreement.

Author: Ryan Anderson and Herman Hum Haiphong or Bust This scenario is based upon an incident described in the book, Blind Man's Bluff, by Sontag and Drew. \"Submarine spying had received a boost in Kissinger's and Nixon's eyes in mid-1972, when U.S. surveillance subs detected one of the rare overt Soviet moves to intervene in the Vietnam War. Shortly after Nixon announced the mining of Haiphong Harbour, the Soviet Navy sent three Echo II subs toward Vietnam. After they were detected by U.S. subs, Washington sent a message to Moscow, essentially saying, send them back home or they're history. The subs left.\" Author: Herman Hum The Pueblo Incident \"A sterner test of Phase One morale occurred during the first half of March 1968. Following the seizure of the USS Pueblo, two carriers with their screens were sent far north to the Sea of Japan. A contingency plan was invoked that committed the Enterprise and Ticonderoga to launch air strikes against North Korean airfields. Air Force planes in South Korea were to have coordinated with the two navy air wings, but it was still a vastly lopsided proposition. The carriers were assigned seven airfields at which were based more than two hundred MiGs. Intelligence briefings detailed the enemy order of battle: ninety-one MiG-21s, seventy-six MiG-17s, and thirty-five MiG-19s. It was estimated that at least half the North Korean fighter force would be airborne by the time the strikes arrived. Against this, we had twenty operational Phantoms and eighteen Crusaders to escort the strike birds. The fighters were spread mighty thin. One target was to be struck by ten A-4s escorted by a pair of F-8s. Nobody slept much that night. A good many farewell letters were written in expectation of the worst, though \"the worst\" varied from one man to another, according to his outlook. If forced down alive, the pilots knew they faced brutal captivity in a land ruled by barbarians. A safe bailout into the sea was only marginally more attractive -- the water was studded with ice, and even in \"poopy suits\" survival would be measured in minutes. Yet nobody backed out. Launch was scheduled for 0600, and at 0430 aircrews were suiting up or eating breakfast. The briefings were grim. There was absolutely no joking. But sometime before 0500 word came through that the mission was scrubbed. It was never known if political considerations swayed the decision makers in Washington, or if military reality forced itself upon them. In either case, two air wings heaved a collective sigh of relief. But the point worth making is that morale held. Knowing the odds against returning were extremely slim, every pilot assigned to the strike would have manned his airplane and launched. They would rather died than looked bad.\" Excerpt from \"On Yankee Station -- The Naval Air War over Vietnam\", pp. 36-7, Barrett Tillman, John B.

In eastern Tennessee, a car accident involving two Japanese-made vehicles leads to the deaths of six people. Revelations about manufacturing and shipping errors that led to the accident stir long-standing resentment toward Japan's trade policies. As trade negotiations between the United States and Japan come to a halt, Congress passes legislation allowing the US to replicate trade practices of the countries from which it imports goods. This immediately cuts off US export markets, threatening the Japanese economy. Facing an economic crisis, Japan's ruling corporate cabal decides to take military action against the United States. Supported covertly by India and China, they plot to curtail the American presence in the Pacific. Japan launches phase one of its assault, sending Self-Defense Force units to occupy the Marianas Islands, specifically Saipan. The invasion, conducted with commercial airliners is virtually bloodless. Elsewhere, during a joint military exercise, Japanese ships \"accidentally\" launch torpedoes at the US Pacific Fleet, destroying two submarines and crippling two aircraft carriers (Enterprise and John C. Stennis). US naval capability in the western Pacific is drastically reduced. Immediate retaliation is delayed by phase two of the Japanese offensive: an economic attack. As the military offensive begins, Japan engineers the collapse of the US stock market by hiring a programmer who is also a consultant for an exchange firm, tasked with inserting a logic bomb into the system. When triggered, the computer program blocks the storage of all trade records made after noon on Friday. The Japanese also attempt to take the life of the Federal Reserve chairman, however he survives the attack with a broken back. America now faces a massive economic crisis of their own and subsequent mass panic. The Japanese hope the Americans will be too distracted to quickly respond to Japan's military actions. --Source Wikipedia: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_of_Honor Author: Ryan Anderson in collaboration with Herman Hum WATCH THAT FIRST STEP LOCATION : NW PACIFIC, COASTAL SEATTLE\n\nDATE/TIME: 12 FEBRUARY 1985, 06:00:00 ZULU With the first war shots, DEFCON ONE status was automatic.
