        "text": "SUCCESS STORY\n\nThe secret to the Fulmar’s success probably lay in its four hour endurance (plus extra time as combat reserves), its high controlled dive speed and the introduction of Carrier Air Patrols under the guidance of Fleet Fighter Direction Officers. The earlier concept of fighters launching as the enemy came into view simply didn’t cut it. But the Fulmar proved that loitering CAP fighters, at good height, could be vectored in by radar for effective interceptions.\n\nService History\n\nThe arrival of the Fulmar fighter in the Mediterranean in September 1940 was to have an immediate impact. Air superiority was now possible over the fleet. As a result, the Royal Navy could now go where it had previously only ventured at extreme risk.\n\nIllustrious’ Fulmars began shooting down “shadowers” almost as soon as the carrier arrived. And the bomber attacks that often followed were now being broken up.\n\nThe first recorded combat came on 2 September 1940, when four Savoia Marchetti SM 79s were destroyed and a Cant Z501 flying-boat was claimed later in the day.\n\nIt was a result as much due to the innovative use of radar as it was the capabilities of the Fulmar.\n\nClever direction, with the determination and bravery of its pilots, enabled the Fulmar to punch far above its weight. By January 1941, the Fulmars on Illustrious had claimed 26 Italian aircraft shot down.\n\nIts Italian opponents were within the Fulmar I’s operational parameters. It had a reasonable margin of speed over most of the bombers at interception heights needed to attack warships. And the lightly armed Italian fighters – while no racehorses themselves – were not considerably more manoeuvrable. Put one in front of even a short burst of the Fulmar I’s eight 0.303 machine guns and they had a tendency to go to pieces.\n\nBut it was not easy going. Only the Fulmar’s dive characteristics – when combined with radar direction from the Illustrious’ Fighter Direction Officers – enabled it to catch the increasingly common SM79 bombers.\n\nNevertheless, the RN Mediterranean Fleet possessed total air superiority for a full four months from September 1940 - destroying over 40 Italian aircraft.\n\nThe Fulmar’s “happy time” was to come to an abrupt halt with the arrival of X Fliegerkorps in January 1941. The faster, better armed and armoured German aircraft made the Fulmar’s limitations obvious. The fleet fighter continued to operate stoically within range of Me 109s and 110s and was never an “easy kill”. But the number of effective interceptions rapidly began to fall away as the German aircraft - if they got under a Fulmar’s guns - didn’t stay there for long.\n\nMinute from First Sea Lord to Prime Minister\n\n[CAB 120/ 295] 26 May 1941\n\nAvailability of Fulmar fighters\n\nIn recent weeks the wastage of Fulmar fighters in the Mediterranean has been high. In a telegram dated 13th May, Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, said:– ‘I must again urge the necessity of immediate increase in the supply of F.A.A. fighters. The supply at present visualised is quite inadequate. Detailed examples of air activity in weather generally unsuitable for attacking aircraft. From the 18th April to the 12th May, 18 Fulmars have made 390 sorties, 338 being fighter patrols. 25 interceptions were made, 15 plus 5 enemy aircraft were shot down, 18 enemy aircraft sighted. During this period 12 Fulmars were lost by rendering beyond repair, 4 being lost after combat. There are now 15 serviceable and 14 under repair or overhaul. The least number required to maintain fighter efforts is 3 squadrons of 12 each, and a reserve of 36.’ The situation in regard to the Fulmars in the Eastern Mediterranean is as follows:\n\nFORMIDABLE: Known to be serviceable 23.5.41. = 5Probably serviceable by 24.5.41. = 7At Malta from Operation ‘Splice’ = 5In ARGUS for Operation ‘Rocket’ =3 +3 ex ‘Splice’ At sea on passage between Cape and Suez. = 15 At sea on passage between U.K. and Cape. = 11 Packed to leave U.K. before the end of May. = 10 Packed for transit to Mediterranean = 16 En route via Takoradi = 6\n\nIn addition to the above there is a total of 63 Fulmars for ARK ROYAL, VICTORIOUS, and the fighter catapult ships, together with 13 which are in the training schools in the U.K.\n\nThe reserves for all the above are:–\n\nFirst Line. 12 Training. 10 At Contractors. 9Lent to Air Ministry for trials, modifications, etc. 6 In addition there are at least 26 Fulmars unserviceable abroad.\n\nI do not think the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean is entirely satisfactory, but in the circumstances obtaining I think it is the best that can be done. An increased production of Fulmars has been promised for the next three months."
