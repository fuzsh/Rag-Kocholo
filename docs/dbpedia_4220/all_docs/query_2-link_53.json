        "text": "Daniel Kochis\n\nThe scale, scope, and intensity of Russia’s war on Ukraine have exposed the inadequacy of allied capabilities, munitions stocks, and force posture in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe, while underscoring the need for updated regional defense plans. The U.S. has reintroduced additional manpower and capabilities into Europe since February 2022 and has built a significant footprint in places like Poland and Romania. European North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies have deployed in support of alliance deterrence efforts in eastern Europe, and many have renewed their commitment to NATO spending benchmarks and rebuilding military capabilities that have atrophied over the past 30 years. Some members—Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, and Greece, in particular—have made dramatic increases in defense spending while others—Germany, France, Spain, Norway, and Belgium, as examples—have not, in spite of pledges to do better. Still, NATO, as a whole, has demonstrated an upward trend in investing in defense, outpacing the United States in aggregate terms by nearly three-to-one over the past decade in constant 2014 dollars. To be clear, some of the largest improvements as a percentage of GDP or percentage change from one year to the next have been among smaller countries who, because of their size and the amount of money they are able to spend, cannot translate a specific increase into quantity-of-capability when it comes to armored forces, squadrons of tactical aircraft, or naval battle groups. Europe’s security condition, and with it the security of U.S. interests, would be materially improved if the larger countries spent more on collective defense capabilities. Still, European NATO partners have been improving their investments, albeit at a slower pace than is needed given the depths to which defense capabilities and readiness have fallen since the end of the Cold War.1 Interestingly, it appears that the farther away a NATO country is from Russia, the less it tends to spend on defense, implying proximity to perceived danger strongly influences such spending. The Baltic countries, Poland, and NATO members in Eastern Europe spend more on defense than those in Western and Southern Europe.2\n\nIn June 2022, NATO adopted its first new Strategic Concept in 12 years. The new concept document takes into account the comprehensive changes in the transatlantic security environment that have taken place in the past 12 years and clearly recognizes the growing threat posed by the Russia–China axis:\n\nThe Russian Federation is the most significant and direct threat to Allies’ security and to peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area. It seeks to establish spheres of influence and direct control through coercion, subversion, aggression and annexation. It uses conventional, cyber and hybrid means against us and our partners. Its coercive military posture, rhetoric and proven willingness to use force to pursue its political goals undermine the rules-based international order.3\n\nThe People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values…. The PRC’s malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target Allies and harm Alliance security. The PRC seeks to control key technological and industrial sectors, critical infrastructure, and strategic materials and supply chains. It uses its economic leverage to create strategic dependencies and enhance its influence. It strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains. The deepening strategic partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.4\n\nNATO welcomed Finland as its 31st member state in April 20235 and is expected to welcome Sweden eventually as well.6 The alliance is updating regional defense plans, is transitioning to a new force structure, and has taken some steps to bolster deterrence through a stronger, more persistent presence in eastern member states. The ability of the alliance to implement recent decisions, flesh out plans for expanded multinational deployments, and fulfill larger requirements for ready forces remains to be seen.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies also have made significant investments in arming and training the Ukrainian military. What began as individual nations supplying arms, ammunition, and supplies (often surplus) has evolved into a sustained flow of intelligence, weapons, matériel, and platforms upon which Ukrainian forces have become entirely reliant. Many supporting countries are repairing damaged Ukrainian equipment; some are aiding Ukraine with niche capabilities. While the U.S. remains the largest donor to Ukraine, many European nations are donating significant capabilities, particularly ammunition, armored vehicles, communications equipment, and medical supplies. European nations also have accepted millions of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war.7\n\nAll of this reflects a grim reality: War is still a feature of international relations that cannot be predicted or always deterred. War is costly, both in preparation and in undertaking, and also generates additional costs (such as support for refugees and disruption of economic activity) beyond the straightforward expense of equipment and training.\n\nThe 51 countries in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) area of responsibility (AOR) include approximately one-fifth of the world’s population, 10.7 million square miles of land, and 13 million square miles of ocean. Some of America’s oldest (France) and closest (the United Kingdom) allies are found in Europe. The U.S. and Europe share a strong commitment to the rule of law, human rights, free markets, and democracy. During the 20th century, millions of Americans fought alongside European allies to defend these shared ideals—the foundations on which America was built.\n\nAmerica’s economic ties to the region are likewise important. For more than 70 years, the U.S. military presence has contributed to regional security and stability, and both Europeans and Americans have benefited economically. The member states of the European Union (EU), along with the United States, account for approximately half of the global economy, and the U.S. and EU member countries are generally each other’s principal trading partners.\n\nEurope is also important to the U.S. because of its geographical proximity to some of the world’s most dangerous and contested regions. From the eastern Atlantic Ocean to the Middle East, up to the Caucasus through Russia, and into the Arctic, Europe is enveloped by an arc of instability. The European region also has some of the world’s most vital shipping lanes, energy resources, and trade choke points.\n\nEuropean basing allows U.S. forces to respond robustly and quickly to challenges to America’s economic and security interests in and near the region. Russia’s brutal effort to remake the borders of Europe by force has shocked many partners, upended the continent’s strategic picture, and caused a war with implications that are far wider than the sovereignty of Ukraine itself. Admiral Robert Burke, former Commander of U.S. Naval Forces Europe, U.S. Naval Forces Africa, and Allied Joint Forces Command Naples, has described the European and African theaters as “the forefront of great power competition.”8\n\nOther external threats to European security include Russia’s activity in the Arctic, growing presence in the Mediterranean theater, and efforts to destabilize Western cohesion in addition to the possibility that Russia might expand the scope of its aggression to include the eastern states of NATO. Added to this is the growing threat to the transatlantic alliance from Chinese investments, technology, and propaganda efforts. Russian naval activity in the North Atlantic and Arctic has led to a renewed focus on regional command and control and increased operations by U.S. and allied air and naval assets in the Arctic, and one consequence of Russia’s strengthened position in Syria has been a resurgence of Russian activity and “congested” conditions in the Mediterranean.9\n\nSpeaking at an Atlantic Council meeting in March 2019, former U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford explained that the U.S. has two key advantages over adversaries: “our network of allies and partners, and the ability to project power where and when necessary to advance our national interest.”10 Nowhere is the value of allies and U.S. basing more apparent than it is in the European operating environment.\n\nU.S. Reinforcements in Europe. Russia’s war against Ukraine greatly accelerated a trend of U.S. reinvestment in Europe that had begun following Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. In April 2014, the U.S. launched Operation Atlantic Resolve (OAR), a series of actions meant to reassure U.S. allies in Europe, particularly those bordering Russia. Under Operation Atlantic Resolve and funded through the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), the U.S. increased its forward presence in Europe; invested in European basing infrastructure and prepositioned stocks, equipment, and supplies; engaged in enhanced multinational training exercises; and negotiated agreements for increased cooperation with NATO allies.\n\nThe U.S. currently has about 100,000 troops stationed in Europe.11 In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. increased the flow of forces to Europe, and the U.S. and NATO undertook a reevaluation of long-term basing structures and force posture requirements with a view to preventing Russian aggression from spilling over into alliance member states, especially those like Poland, whose role as a staging ground for aid to Ukrainian forces has made it a Russian target.\n\nIn March 2023, the U.S. presence in Poznan, Poland, transitioned to Army Garrison Poland (USAG–P), the eighth permanent U.S. Army garrison in Europe.12 Overall, the U.S. has a presence of around 12,000 in Poland.13 The Army’s V Corps, which had been deactivated in 2013, was reactivated on November 9, 2020, and became fully operational in November 2021.14 In March 2022, the headquarters, then based in Kentucky, was largely deployed to Europe “to provide additional command and control of U.S. Army forces in Europe” and “to build readiness, improve interoperability, reinforce allies and deter further Russian aggression.”15 In June 2022, President Biden announced that the U.S. would establish the permanent V Corps headquarters in Poland.16 According to General Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and Commander, U.S. European Command, “permanently assigned forces are more operationally effective, as they remain fully oriented to the operational environment and can become interoperable with our Allies and Partners.”17\n\nDuring the June 2022 NATO Summit in Madrid, the U.S. announced additional deployments to Europe including the deployment of a new rotational brigade combat team to Romania. Today, around 4,000 U.S. troops, largely based at the Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, help to train “soldiers from NATO allies in Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Slovakia.”18 The deployment has been extended through at least the end of 2023 with a new rotation of troops from Kentucky to be joined by a two-star general and staff from Fort Drum, New York. Analysts have noted that having a major general in Romania “that close to the combat zone…would allow for quick decisions about where to position troops and weapons should Russia push the war into NATO territory.”19 Additional contributions to European security announced in June 2022 include (among others listed) enhanced rotational deployments of “armored, aviation, air defense, and special operations forces” to the Baltics; an “air defense artillery brigade headquarters, a short-range air defense battalion, a combat sustainment support battalion headquarters, and an engineer brigade headquarters” forward stationed in Germany; a “a short-range air defense battery” forward stationed in Italy.20\n\nThe U.S. has further strengthened its presence in Norway. The Supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement signed by the two nations in April 2021 and approved by the Norwegian parliament in June 2022 allows the U.S. to build additional infrastructure at Rygge and Sola Air Stations in southern Norway as well as Evenes Air Station and Ramsund Naval Station above the Arctic Circle.21 Construction at Evenes will support the monitoring of Russian submarine activity by Norwegian and allied maritime patrol aircraft. According to former Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide, “The agreement reaffirms Norway’s close relationship with the U.S. and confirms Norway’s key position on the northern flank of NATO.”22\n\nIn October 2021, the U.S. Navy deployed a mobile “Expeditionary Medical Facility to a cave system near Bogen Bay in northern Norway, some 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle.”23 According to the operations director for the U.S. Navy Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM), “Expeditionary Medical Facilities are deployable on short notice and contain many capabilities of a modern hospital.”24 In October 2020, at the behest of the United States, Norway announced the reopening of Olavsvern bunker, a mountainside submarine base near Tromsø with “32,000 square feet of deep-water docking space, including a full dry dock for maintenance,” capable of berthing and refitting American submarines. The base, which had been closed in 2002, is now open to U.S. Seawolf–class nuclear submarines.25\n\nIn August 2020, the Marine Corps announced the end of heel-to-toe rotations of 700 Marines to Norway, which began in 2017, opting for shorter, more sporadic deployments like those that occurred in 2021 and 2022 when U.S. Marines worked with Norwegian forces and utilized Norway’s ample training ranges.26 In February and March 2021, four B-1 Lancers were based out of Ørland Air Station in southern Norway, marking the first time the aircraft have been based in that country.27 The Lancers conducted training exercises with allies Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Poland while also practicing landing and refueling at Bodø Air Base above the Arctic Circle.28\n\nFrom March–April 2022, Norway hosted NATO’s Cold Response 2022, at that time the largest Norwegian-led exercise since the Cold War. Among the participants were 3,000 American Marines.29 In February and March 2023, U.S. forces took part in Arctic Forge 23, “an exercise that includes Finland’s Defense Exercise North, and exercise Joint Viking in Norway.”30 The U.S. contributed approximately 930 Marines and Army personnel to Joint Viking and 280 Army personnel to Defense Exercise North, and II Marine Expeditionary Force Commanding General David A. Ottignon assessed that the exercises made U.S. forces “more survivable and lethal in austere environments.”31 Finland, Sweden, and Norway reportedly are planning a joint exercise, Nordic Response 2024, that as currently planned would be the largest NATO exercise in the Arctic since the end of the Cold War.32\n\nIn February 2023, the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team (ABCT) of the 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood, Texas, replaced the outgoing BCT in the tenth armored rotation in support of OAR.33 Many analysts have noted the special deterrent importance of ground forces. “Land forces provide traditional ‘boots on the ground’ and a visible presence among local populations,” according to one recent analysis. “They can also enhance the credibility of deterrence through bringing to bear the heavy ground forces required to defend, seize, and hold territory in the event of conflict.”34\n\nIn addition to back-to-back rotations of armor, the U.S. has maintained a rotational aviation brigade in Europe since February 2017.35 The ninth such rotation, lasting from August 2022–April 2023, is the 1st Armored Division, Combat Aviation Brigade, from Fort Bliss, Texas, with 2,300 troops, 10 CH-47 Chinooks, 25 AH-64 Apaches, and 40 UH-60 and 15 HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.36 The tenth rotation will be carried out by the 3rd Combat Aviation Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, from Fort Stewart, Georgia, from May 2023–February 2024.37\n\nThe U.S. also continues to rotate a Sustainment Task Force “comprised of nearly 1,000 personnel and 200 pieces of equipment” from “11 active duty, U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard units.” The units that make up the task force “include ammunition, fuel, movement control, transportation, maintenance, ordnance, supply, and postal services.”38\n\nIn May 2018, the U.S. began to fly MQ-9 Reaper drones on unarmed reconnaissance flights out of Miroslawiec Air Base in Poland, which U.S. Air Force (USAF) officials stated was chosen because of its “strategic location.”39 In January 2021, the U.S. announced that 90 USAF personnel and an unspecified number of MQ-9s would be based at Campia Turzii in Romania “to conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions in support of NATO operations.”40 According to General Jeffrey Harrigian, then Commander, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, U.S. Air Forces Africa, and Allied Air Command, the base’s location approximately 300 miles from the coast “really facilitates our ability to compete in the Black Sea.”41 In late 2022, the U.S. began to deploy MQ-9s from Larissa Air Base in Greece near the Aegean Sea,42 “a strategic location, allowing the MQ-9s to easily support both the eastern and southern flanks of NATO.”43 The U.S. also operates MQ-9s out of Lask Air Base in Poland.44\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that the USAF had “moved additional fighters, tankers, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft into the European theater over the past few months, as well as bombers on a rotational basis, all to reassure NATO allies who feel threatened by the invasion of Ukraine.”45\n\nIn January 2022, as part of the ongoing U.S. commitment to NATO’s Baltic Air Policing, six F-15Es based in North Carolina deployed to Ämari Air Base in Estonia.46 That same month, U.S. F-16s based in Germany deployed to Poland to fly regional air policing missions. The day after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, six Utah-based F-35As forward deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany, periodically taking part in Baltic Air Policing missions out of Estonia and Lithuania.47 In May 2022, eight F-35As from the Vermont National Guard deployed to Spangdahlem to take part in NATO’s enhanced Air Policing (eAP) mission.48 From August–November 2022, F22s based in Alaska and F-15E Strike Eagles based in RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom (U.K.), took part in air policing flying out of Poland.49\n\nU.S. B-52H Stratofortresses based in North Dakota have periodically deployed to the European theater. In August 2022, B-52s deployed to RAF Fairford, U.K., for exercises in which “U.S., Norway and Sweden military aircraft…executed rapid, global power projection missions to support the mutual defense of NATO partners and Allies, all while achieving multi-domain effects.”50 In February 2023, two B52s conducted a low approach flyby of Estonia’s Independence Day celebrations in Tallinn having flown from North Dakota.51\n\nEuropean Deterrence Initiative. Some U.S. investments in Europe including rotations of Armored and Aviation Brigade Combat Teams are funded through the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI). The Biden Administration has requested $3,630.4 million for the EDI in fiscal year (FY) 2024, which is $637 million (15 percent) less than the enacted FY 2023 EDI budget of $4,267.4 million.52 EDI funding requests for FY 2024 include support for such activities as “rotational force deployments, infrastructure investments, and [delivery of] the right capabilities in key locations throughout Europe”;53 intelligence enhancements for special operations forces;54 exercises to “increase[] the overall readiness and interoperability of U.S. forces across all domain[s]” and “with our NATO Allies and theater partners”;55 “facilities to store prepositioned equipment, munitions and fuel”;56 and modernization of “CBRN [Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear] defenses to ensure forces are prepared to [defend] against rising threats in the AOR.”57\n\nThe EDI has supported infrastructure improvements across the region. One major EDI-funded project is a replacement hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, that will “provid[e] primary care, specialized consultative care, hospitalization and treatment for more than 200,000 U.S. military personnel, DoD and interagency civilians and dependents in Europe.”58 Landstuhl’s importance is illustrated by the fact that in early March 2020, it was one of the first two overseas U.S. laboratories to be capable of testing for coronavirus.59\n\nIn addition to the EDI, as of the end of 2021, the U.S. Department of State had awarded nearly $300 million in grants since 2018 through its European Recapitalization Incentive Program (ERIP) and repurposed funds to help U.S. allies in Europe replace Russian equipment with U.S.-made equipment: infantry fighting vehicles for Croatia, Greece, and North Macedonia; helicopters for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Lithuania, and Slovakia; and air surveillance radars and fixed-wing aircraft for Bulgaria. The program helps allies to “modernize their militaries by building NATO interoperable forces and removing Russian and Soviet-legacy equipment from their force structure.”60\n\nPrepositioned Stocks. The U.S. continues to preposition equipment in Europe across all services. In February 2022, the U.S. activated six Army Prepositioned Stock-2 sites to outfit an Armored Brigade Combat Team deploying from the U.S.61 The FY 2024 EDI budget request includes $1,246.2 million to support enhanced prepositioning for the U.S. Army, Air Force, and Special Forces.62 The U.S. Army lists storage sites in Dülmen, Germany; Eygelshoven, the Netherlands; Zutendaal, Belgium; Livorno, Italy; Mannheim, Germany; and Powidz, Poland.63 The Powidz site opened on April 5, 2023.64\n\nIn March 2022, NATO opened its first Multinational Ammunition Warehousing Initiative (MAWI) in Estonia for allies to store munitions for Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) deployments. The alliance plans further MAWI sites to support EFP deployments and the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF).65 “With Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine,” NATO’s Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment has stated, “MAWI has gained significant relevance beyond efficiency improvements only. The expansion of NATO’s multinational battlegroups on the eastern flank requires an upgrade of the logistical support infrastructure to match this scope.”66\n\nAid to Ukraine. According to the U.S. Department of State:\n\nSince January 2021, the United States has invested more than $42 billion in security assistance to demonstrate our enduring and steadfast commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. This includes more than $41.3 billion since Russia’s [sic] launched its premeditated, unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Since 2014, the United States has provided more than $44.1 billion in security assistance for training and equipment to help Ukraine preserve its territorial integrity, secure its borders, and improve interoperability with NATO.67\n\nThe U.S. is by far the largest donor to Ukraine. According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy’s Ukraine Support Tracker, the top six donors of total financial, humanitarian, and military assistance from January 24, 2022, to January 15, 2023, were the United States, “EU Institutions,” the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Poland.68 European Union aid is heavily weighted toward financial support in the form of loans.69 When aid is calculated as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), however, “[t]he United States comes in 5th, with total commitments worth around 0.37 percent of its 2021 GDP,” behind Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.70\n\nIn January 2023, Germany announced that it would be donating at least 14 Leopard 2A6 tanks to Ukraine.71 The first eight arrived in March. Germany also sent “two specialist tank-recovery vehicles and 40 Marder infantry fighting vehicles.”72 In February, Poland became the first nation to deliver tanks (the first four of a total of 14 Leopard 2A4s eventually delivered).73 In March, the U.S. announced that it would send an older Abrams tank version, the M-1A1, rather than the M-1A2 originally planned in order to advance delivery to early fall 2023. The U.S. is planning to outfit a complete tank battalion with 31 of the M-1A1s, which U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said would “make a pretty significant difference” for Ukrainian operations.74\n\nIn March 2023, Norway announced that it had delivered eight Leopard 2A4 tanks to Ukraine.75 Also in March, the United Kingdom delivered “14 UK Challenger tanks” along with “20 Bulldog armoured troop carriers and 30 AS-90 self-propelled artillery guns.”76 Canada sent four Leopard 2 tanks at the end of February, Spain sent six Leopard 2A4 tanks at the end of April,77 Finland announced at the end of March that it would soon be sending three Leopard 2 armored mine-clearing vehicles, and Sweden promised in February to “donate up to 10 Leopard 2 tanks.”78\n\nIn addition to the Abrams, U.S. aid includes such support as ammunition, anti-tank weapons, 20 Mi-17 helicopters, 154 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles, Switchblade Unmanned Aerial Systems, and air defenses including one Patriot battery and eight National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and munitions.79 Air defenses are a priority for Ukraine. Germany and the Netherlands have stated their intention to donate Patriot missile batteries, and France and Italy have donated SAMP/T Medium Range Air Defense Systems.80 Germany has sent two advanced air defense batteries to Ukraine that had been stationed to protect Berlin from incoming missiles.81\n\nLeaked U.S. Pentagon documents reportedly reveal concerns that Ukrainian air defense ammunition might be used at a high rate of expenditure as well as concerns about the need for a greater quantity of air defense systems. “While the Patriots and SAMP-T are more sophisticated than S-300,” according to the documents, “the three batteries due to arrive in Ukraine won’t be able to replace the breadth of coverage afforded by the 25 currently operating Ukrainian S-300 batteries.”82 The West’s ability to provide munitions without a major increase in production has further revealed the limitations of the Western defense industrial base. According to the Royal United Services Institute, for example, “At the height of the fighting in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas area, Russia was using more ammunition in two days than the entire stock of the British military.”83\n\nFighter jets also have begun to arrive in Ukraine. By April 17, Slovakia had delivered all 13 promised MiG-29s.84 The first Slovakian-donated MiGs saw combat by the end of March.85 Slovakia made known that Russian technicians helping to maintain the MiGs until the end of 2022 had sabotaged the jets. Slovakian Defense Minister Jaroslav Nad stated that before being fixed, the jets “were able to fly, but that doesn’t mean they were also capable of combat.”86 In April, Poland sent the first five MiG29s to Ukraine, having received export approval from Germany pursuant to the terms of a 2003 purchase agreement.87\n\nMany European nations have depleted their own stocks to equip Ukrainian forces. For instance, in addition to Harpoon anti-ship missiles, Denmark is donating all of its 19 Caesar self-propelled howitzers, some of which have been ordered by the Danes but have yet to arrive.88 In 2022, Estonia and Latvia donated one-third of their defense budgets to Ukraine.89 The expenditure rate of munitions on the battlefield, combined with Western industry’s lack of preparedness for a prolonged war, has Western officials concerned about their ability to maintain the flow of essential capabilities to Ukraine. In November 2022, one NATO official commented, “I think everyone is now sufficiently worried.”90\n\nNATO allies continue to train Ukrainian forces, sometimes on specific systems. The U.S. trained 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers between February 2022 and March 2023.91 Some have traveled to the U.S. for training on systems such as Patriot; others have taken part in combined arms, medical training, and combat casualty care at U.S. bases in Germany. With support from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden, the U.K.’s Operation Interflex trained 10,000 Ukrainian troops from June–December 2022 and plans to train 20,000 in 2023.92 In early 2023, the U.K. trained Ukrainian tank crews on the Challenger II tank at British bases.93 Germany is heading an EU mission to train 9,000 Ukrainian troops in Germany in 2023 with a goal of eventually training 30,000; the Netherlands and Norway are contributing to this training mission.94 The Czech Republic, France, Italy, Romania, Slovakia, and Spain are also training Ukrainian troops.95\n\nNATO allies are helping Ukraine to repair and maintain equipment. U.S. forces are helping Ukrainians to troubleshoot equipment issues over the phone or via video link, at times while the capability in question is engaged in battle.96 Poland maintains a large facility with 400 personnel to repair Ukrainian armor and artillery.97 In April 2023, Poland opened another facility, Bumar-Labędy, to repair and maintain donated T-72 and PT-91 main battle tanks (MBTs) and possibly Leopard IIs.98 U.S. Abrams tanks will reportedly be repaired in Poznan, Poland, where U.S. personnel are said to be assisting.99 In April 2023, Germany’s Rheinmetall opened a maintenance facility near Satu Mare, Romania, with the ability to service Leopard IIs, “self-propelled howitzers, Marder infantry fighting vehicles, Fuchs armored transport vehicles, and military trucks.”100 Bulgarian factories have repaired Ukrainian equipment including helicopters.101 In February 2023, Ukrainian “weapons and military hardware manufacturer Ukroboronprom…signed a memorandum with the Czech Republic’s VOP CZ military enterprise on repairing Ukrainian armored vehicles.” The memorandum is part of a 2022 deal “to create joint enterprises to increase military equipment production for Ukraine.”102\n\nOther nations have assisted Ukraine with niche capabilities. Estonia, for example, led an EU-funded program to help strengthen Ukraine’s cyber capabilities and in 2022 helped Ukraine’s military to set up a cyber facility.103 Also in 2022, the European Union began to reimburse member states for a portion of weapons sent to Ukraine through its European Peace Facility (EPF). In March 2023, the European Council agreed to spend $1.1 billion from the EPF to reimburse ammunition donations from the existing stocks of member states. An additional €1 billion will be drawn to fund “joint procurements through the European Defense Agency and will place new orders at the European defense industry to speed up production to replenish stockpiles.”104\n\nThe transatlantic community has also accepted large numbers of Ukrainian refugees fleeing the war. Since February 24, 2022, 10.7 million Ukrainian refugees have crossed the border into Poland, and more than 1.5 million have elected to remain rather than return to Ukraine or move elsewhere within Europe.105 Other nations have accepted numbers that are far smaller but still significant in proportion to their populations.\n\nU.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe. In his 2023 EUCOM posture statement, General Christopher Cavoli reaffirmed that:\n\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will remain a nuclear Alliance. The nuclear capability of NATO-member Nuclear Weapons States deters aggression, prevents coercion, preserves peace, and instills confidence in the Trans-Atlantic bond. The U.S. continues to make available its strategic nuclear forces to defend NATO, serving as the Alliance’s supreme guarantor of security. With key Allies, we maintain the capability to deploy strategic nuclear forces that support Alliance security.106\n\nIt is believed that until the end of the Cold War, the U.S. maintained approximately 2,500 nuclear warheads in Europe. Today, the U.S. maintains around 100 tactical nuclear warheads that are spread out across bases in Belgium, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey.107\n\nIn October 2019, reports surfaced that in light of ongoing tensions, the U.S. was considering moving the approximately 50 tactical nuclear weapons stored at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, but this has not happened. All of these weapons are free-fall, variable yield108 gravity bombs designed for use with U.S. and allied dual-capable aircraft. Although tactical nuclear weapons are forward deployed to Incirlik, “there are no aircraft capable of delivering the B-61 gravity bombs co-located at Incirlik Airbase.”109 The U.S. has agreements with Belgium, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands that allow for delivery of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons by allied aircraft, but “[t]he weapons at Incirlik…are solely for use on U.S. aircraft.”110 In October 2022, Polish President Andrzej Duda stated that Poland has raised the possibility of taking part in the nuclear sharing program.111\n\nThe B61 nuclear gravity bomb that is “deployed from U.S. Air Force and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bases” is undergoing a life extension program that is expected to add at least 20 years to its service life and “improve the B61’s safety, security, and effectiveness.”112 According to experts, “[t]he upgrades are all in the non-nuclear aspects of the unguided bomb’s design, and involve removing a parachute and installing a new tail kit and other improvements for ‘significantly greater accuracy.’”113 The first production unit was completed in February 2022, and the extension program is to be completed by 2026.114 The U.S. accelerated the fielding of the first upgraded units to Europe to December 2022 rather than Spring 2023 in a decision that was probably meant to reassure allies.115\n\nChina. As noted, NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept outlines the threat posed by the People’s Republic of China:\n\nThe People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) stated ambitions and coercive policies challenge our interests, security and values. The PRC employs a broad range of political, economic and military tools to increase its global footprint and project power, while remaining opaque about its strategy, intentions and military build-up. The PRC’s malicious hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational rhetoric and disinformation target Allies and harm Alliance security. The PRC seeks to control key technological and industrial sectors, critical infrastructure, and strategic materials and supply chains. It uses its economic leverage to create strategic dependencies and enhance its influence. It strives to subvert the rules-based international order, including in the space, cyber and maritime domains. The deepening strategic partnership between the People’s Republic of China and the Russian Federation and their mutually reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run counter to our values and interests.116\n\nThe growing nexus between Russia and China has been noted by Heritage Foundation analysts as well:\n\nJust weeks prior to Russia’s second invasion of Ukraine, Putin and [Chinese Communist Party General Secretary] Xi [Jinping] announced a strategic partnership which promised “no ‘forbidden’ areas of cooperation.” While Chinese support hasn’t quite lived up to the hype, Beijing certainly hasn’t been sitting on the sidelines. Recent analysis shows that China is shipping critical components including “navigation equipment, jamming technology and jet-fighter parts to sanctioned Russian government-owned defense companies.” While China isn’t the only nation helping Russia skirt western sanctions, it is the key enabler.117\n\nChina has significantly increased its presence in the European theater. In 2021, Admiral Burke warned that Chinese warships and investments are “increasingly present” in the Mediterranean and highlighted the potential risk to U.S. and alliance interests from Chinese infrastructure acquisitions in Europe:\n\nToday, the Chinese have a controlling interest in 12 European ports. So, are NATO countries going to be able to count on those ports for Free Trade, and if NATO has to defend Europe, will they allow us into those ports to refuel, resupply, do repairs, rearm? We don’t know if we can count on that. It’s a troubling pattern and our European partners are increasingly aware and awakened to this potential threat.118\n\nChinese investments in key European infrastructure present two serious risks. First, “port investments could be an indirect source of political leverage—the more a country’s economy benefits from the presence of Chinese port operators, the more it depends on good relations with China.”119 Second, “China’s investment in European strategic infrastructure has the potential to interfere with allied military mobility—the ability of NATO to move troops and equipment across Europe.”120\n\nThese concerns may be having some effect. In October 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government agreed to allow a Chinese company to buy a 25.9 percent stake in one of three terminals at the port of Hamburg. Former EUCOM Commander General Ben Hodges criticized the agreement, noting the critical importance of German ports in bringing American troops and equipment into Europe, especially during a crisis: “[K]nowing that the Chinese may be able to influence or disrupt activities at critical transportation infrastructure, that’s a problem.”121 Then, in 2023, Germany’s Federal Office for Information Security reclassified the terminal as “critical infrastructure,” setting off a security review that could nullify the deal.122\n\nImportant Alliances and Bilateral Relations in Europe\n\nThe United States has a number of important multilateral and bilateral relationships in Europe. First and foremost is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the world’s most important and arguably most successful defense alliance.\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. NATO is an intergovernmental, multilateral security organization that was designed originally to defend Western Europe from the Soviet Union. It anchored the U.S. firmly in Europe, solidified Western resolve during the Cold War, and rallied European support after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. NATO has been the bedrock of transatlantic security cooperation ever since its creation in 1949 and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn April 2021, following a U.S. decision to withdraw forces from Afghanistan and “recognising that there is no military solution to the challenges Afghanistan faces,” NATO ended Operation Resolute Support, a non-combat operation intended to provide “training, advice and assistance to Afghan security forces and institutions.”123 The withdrawal of alliance forces was completed in August 2021, and the mission was terminated in September 2021. Currently ongoing operations include:\n\nKosovo Force (KFOR), which involves 5,081 troops from 31 nations;124\n\nOperation Sea Guardian, which “is NATO’s maritime security operation in the Mediterranean and is presently conducting three maritime security tasks: maritime security capacity building, support to maritime situational awareness and maritime counter-terrorism”;125\n\nNATO Air Policing, “an integral part of NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) for 60 years” that covers the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania); the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg); Iceland; and the Adriatic and Western Balkans (Slovenia, Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia) in addition to “supplement[ing] the existing NATO Air Policing forces in the Baltic States, deploy[ing] additional aircraft to Poland, and augment[ing] the national air policing capabilities of the Bulgarian and Romanian air forces”;126\n\nSupport for the African Union Mission in Somalia, which includes “strategic air- and sealift” and “focused support to the African Stand-by Force Concept and its associated projects including exercises, early warning and disaster preparedness”;127 and\n\nNATO Mission Iraq (NMI), “a non-combat advisory and capacity-building mission that assists Iraq in building more sustainable, transparent, inclusive and effective armed forces and security institutions, so that Iraqis themselves are better able to stabilise their country, fight terrorism and prevent the return of ISIS/Daesh.”128\n\nUnderscoring the value of NATO air policing missions, in 2022, NATO jets scrambled 570 times to intercept Russian military aircraft.129 This was a significant increase over 2021, when NATO jets were scrambled 370 times.130\n\nIn May 2022, in a historic shift brought about by Russia’s war against Ukraine, Finland and Sweden applied for NATO membership. On April 4, 2023, Finland became the 31st NATO member state.131 Sweden, whose accession has yet to be ratified by Hungary and Turkey, is likely to become the alliance’s 32nd member state. The inclusion of Finland and Sweden brings substantial capabilities to the alliance and enhances the security of the Baltic Sea region.\n\nNATO Responses to Russia’s War in Ukraine. On February 25, 2022, for the first time in its history, NATO activated approximately one-third of its 40,000-strong NATO Response Force (NRF).132 In announcing the activation, General Tod Wolters, then NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, stated that the NRF “represent[s] a flexible, combat credible force that can be employed in multiple ways…. These deterrence measures are prudent and enhance our speed, responsiveness and capability to shield and protect the one billion citizens we swore to protect.”133\n\nIn June 2022, the alliance announced that the NRF would be increased from 40,000 to 300,000 troops.134 Secretary General Stoltenberg noted that “[f]or the first time since the Cold War, we will have pre-assigned forces to defend specific Allies. So that we can reinforce much faster if needed.”135 At the June 2022 Madrid summit, NATO agreed to a new force model that will “deliver an allied response at much greater scale and at higher readiness than the current NATO Response Force, which it will replace.”136 The new force model envisions having “well over 100,000” troops ready within 10 days, “around 200,000” ready in 10–30 days, and “at least 500,000” ready in 30–180 days.137 The force model also “involves a more focused and ambitious training and exercise programme, including larger-formation collective defence exercises.”138 Filling out and implementing the NATO force model will take time and will certainly hit snags based on the inability of some allies to generate the forces needed to fulfill their quotas.139\n\nNATO’s Strategic Concept reaffirms the vitality of the transatlantic alliance and places collective defense of the member states firmly at the heart of NATO. It also clearly identifies the main threat to member states: “The Russian Federation has violated the norms and principles that contributed to a stable and predictable European security order. We cannot discount the possibility of an attack against Allies’ sovereignty and territorial integrity.”140\n\nNATO is updating its regional defense plans pursuant to a Political Guidance for Defence Planning 2023 that was approved by NATO Defense Ministers in February 2023.141 In 2022, General Cavoli stated that “[w]e’re developing strategic, domain-specific and regional defense plans to improve our ability to respond to any contingency and to ensure timely reinforcement.”142 Some planners have concluded that 300,000 troops will be needed to defend against Russian aggression in the eastern part of the alliance. The first readiness tier of about 100,000 soldiers could come from Poland, Norway, and the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and a second tier would deploy from countries like Germany.\n\nOnce regional defense plans are finalized, “capitals will be asked to weigh in—and eventually make available troops, planes, ships and tanks for different parts of the blueprints.”143 More troops from allied nations will be placed under SACEUR’s direct command, and “under a new rubric of ‘deter and defend,’ General Cavoli is for the first time since the Cold War integrating American and allied war-fighting plans.”144 NATO defense planning will likely become “more demanding and specific,” and “[i]f the other allies all agree that a country’s plan is inadequate, they can vote to force adaptation in what is known as ‘consensus minus one.’”145\n\nNATO has eight multinational battlegroups, all of which “are integrated into NATO’s command structure to ensure the necessary readiness and responsiveness.”146 The first four (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland) were established in 2017 and the second four (Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia) in 2022. As of June 2023, the composition of these battlegroups was as follows147\n\nHost nation: Bulgaria\n\nFramework nation: Italy\n\nContributing nations: Albania, Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Turkey, and the United States\n\nHost nation: Estonia\n\nFramework nation: United Kingdom\n\nContributing nations: Denmark, France and Iceland\n\nHost nation: Hungary\n\nFramework nation: Hungary\n\nContributing nations: Croatia, Italy, Turkey, and the United States\n\nHost nation: Latvia\n\nFramework nation: Canada\n\nContributing nations: Albania, Czechia, Denmark, Iceland, Italy, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain\n\nHost nation: Lithuania\n\nFramework nation: Germany\n\nContributing nations: Belgium, Croatia, Czechia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the United States\n\nHost nation: Poland\n\nFramework nation: United States\n\nContributing nations: Croatia, Romania, and the United Kingdom\n\nHost nation: Romania\n\nFramework nation: France\n\nContributing nations: Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, North Macedonia, Poland, Portugal, and the United States\n\nHost nation: Slovakia\n\nFramework nation: Czechia\n\nContributing nations: Germany, Slovenia, and the United States\n\nAt the Madrid summit, “Allies agreed to enhance the multinational battlegroups from battalions up to brigade size, where and when required.”148 This phrasing has led to differing interpretations with host nations usually supporting a beefed-up presence on the ground and contributing nations preferring to maintain a smaller footprint. For example, while the United Kingdom briefly doubled its troop presence in Estonia in 2022, for 2023, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) decided that “[i]nstead of the additional battlegroup, the UK will hold at high readiness the ‘balance of a Brigade’ in the UK, available to deploy if needed. The UK will also ‘surge’ forces throughout the year for exercises, enhance its headquarters and provide support to Estonian armed forces.”149 Similarly, Lithuania has publicly called for a German brigade to deploy to Rukla, and German Chancellor Scholz has said that the decision on permanent deployment of a brigade is “up to NATO.”150 France deployed a Brigade Forward Command Element to Romania in November 2022151 but remains cagey about sending additional troops as it seeks to advance further French contracts with Romania.152\n\nNATO has also established eight Force Integration Units located in Sofia, Bulgaria; Tallinn, Estonia; Riga, Latvia; Vilnius, Lithuania; Bydgoszcz, Poland; Bucharest, Romania; Szekesfehervar, Hungary; and Bratislava, Slovakia. These new units “will help facilitate the rapid deployment of Allied forces to the Eastern part of the Alliance, support collective defence planning and assist in coordinating training and exercises.”153\n\nThe U.S.-led DEFENDER (Dynamic Employment of Forces to Europe for NATO Deterrence and Enhanced Readiness) exercises are some of the largest undertaken by the NATO allies. According to U.S. Army Europe and Africa, DEFENDER Europe 23, which was conducted in April, May, and June 2023, was “a U.S. European Command directed multi-national, joint exercise designed to build readiness and interoperability between U.S. and NATO allies and partners” and was intended to “include more than 7,000 U.S. and 17,000 multi-national service members from more than 20 Allied and partner nations”; “demonstrate U.S. Army Europe and Africa’s ability to quickly aggregate combat power in Eastern Europe”; increase lethality of the NATO Alliance through long-distance fires”; “build unit readiness in a complex joint, multi-national environment”; and “leverage host nation capabilities to increase operational reach.”154\n\nAs part of these exercises, in June, “250 military aircraft, including 100 from the United States,” participated in Air Defender 2023, “the biggest air defense exercise of its kind in the history of the Euro-Atlantic military alliance”155 and the U.S. Air National Guard’s “largest deployment across the Atlantic since the Gulf War.”156\n\nIn October 2019, addressing a NATO capability gap in aerial refueling, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Norway jointly procured A330 air-to-air refueling aircraft. Currently, seven aircraft are operating out of Eindhoven air base in the Netherlands and Germany’s Cologne–Wahn air base. The eighth and ninth are to be delivered in 2024 and a tenth, ordered in March 2023, in 2026. The tankers were active for the withdrawal from Kabul in 2021 and continue to aid in refueling missions along NATO’s eastern flank, having flown 500 refueling missions in 2022.157\n\nIn November 2019, NATO announced a $1 billion upgrade of its Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) planes. The upgrades “will provide AWACS with sophisticated new communications and networking capabilities, including upgrades to the NE-3A’s data link and voice communications capabilities, and enhanced Wide-Band Beyond Line-of-Sight airborne networking capability” and will extend the aircrafts’ service life to 2035.158 In February 2023, NATO began its assessment of industry bids to replace its AWACS fleet under the Allied Future Surveillance and Control (AFSC) capability program, which aims to define ‘a new generation of surveillance and control capabilities’…intended to integrate ‘multiple capabilities and platforms’ for future multidomain operations.”159 In January 2023, NATO deployed three AWACS and 180 military personnel to a Romanian air base near Otopeni where the aircraft operated for “several weeks.”160 NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance system consists of five RQ-4D Phoenix remotely piloted aircraft based out of Sigonella, Italy, along with ground command and control stations, and provides “a state-of-the-art Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) capability to NATO.”161\n\nIn 2018, NATO established two new commands with a combined total of 1,500 personnel: a Joint Force Command for the Atlantic based in Norfolk, Virginia, and a logistics and military mobility command headquartered in Ulm, Germany.162 Logistics has recently been a significant alliance focus. In November 2022, the chairman of NATO’s Military Committee stated that “[i]n many, many nations—not only the eastern flank—but in many, many nations, there are shortfalls in infrastructure.”163 Continued shortfalls in the alliance’s ability to move soldiers and equipment swiftly and efficiently include “limitations of road surface weight capacity, bridges capacity and railway traffic limits” as well as differences in rail gauges and continued legal, procedural, and regulatory slowdowns.164 In November 2022, for example, French tanks traveling through Germany to exercises in Romania were denied transit because their weight exceeded regulations and once inside Romania had to use a circuitous route to get to their base because structural deficiencies had caused a key bridge to be closed.165\n\nNATO has worked with the European Union, which retains competencies that are critical to improving military mobility, particularly with regard to overcoming legal and regulatory hurdles, to overcome these barriers. In May 2021, NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoană noted that continued improvements are needed in such areas as “regulations for swift border-crossing, close coordination between military forces and civil government bodies, access to necessary transport capabilities, and ensuring that national transport infrastructure is fit for purpose.”166 Former U.S. EUCOM Commander Hodges has described the issue facing the alliance in stark terms: “We do not have enough transport capacity, or infrastructure that enables the rapid movement of NATO forces across Europe,” adding that “[w]hat we have learned from Russia’s war against Ukraine is… that war is a test of will, and it’s a test of logistics.”167\n\nSome allies are investing heavily on their own to address infrastructure issues. Poland, or example, is building a €35 billion Solidarity Transport Hub, a project that involves building roads, rails, an airport, military infrastructure, and bridges with a completion goal of 2028. Polish officials promise that “[i]t will be a place where large tactical connections, large amounts of ammunition, supplies and logistics can be taken to Poland very quickly.”168\n\nIn April 2022, the alliance established the Defence Innovation Accelerator of the North Atlantic (DIANA). With a $1.1 billion “innovation fund” that will invest in “deep-tech startups” over a 15-year period and working through “more than 10 accelerator sites and over 50 test centers,” DIANA is “tasked to bring innovative civilian and military organizations closer together to develop cutting-edge solutions in the realms of emerging and disruptive technologies” such as artificial intelligence, autonomy, big-data processing, biotechnology, hypersonic technology, new materials, propulsion, quantum-enabled technologies, and space-related systems.169 DIANA’s charter was approved in June 2022, and in December, the board of directors “agreed that energy resilience, secure information sharing and sensing and surveillance will be the priority areas of focus for DIANA’s work on Emerging and Disrupting Technologies (EDTs) in 2023.”170\n\nCyber Capabilities. NATO’s 2022 Strategic Concept states that:\n\nMaintaining secure use of and unfettered access to space and cyberspace are key to effective deterrence and defence. We will enhance our ability to operate effectively in space and cyberspace to prevent, detect, counter and respond to the full spectrum of threats, using all available tools. A single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities; or hostile operations to, from, or within space; could reach the level of armed attack and could lead the North Atlantic Council to invoke Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.171\n\nThrough the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership, NATO has invested in a stronger relationship with industry. This partnership includes “NATO entities, national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and NATO member countries’ industry representatives” and is also relevant for small and medium enterprises, which can often provide innovative solutions in cyberspace.” Participants are “encouraged to share reports of intrusion events, participate in damage assessments with the NCI Agency and report any cyber security incident that may be of interest to NATO.”172\n\nCooperation within NATO is also facilitated by two other entities.\n\nThe NATO Intelligence on Cyberspace Community of Interest was created “to more regularly exchange information, assessments and best practices—improving NATO’s ability to prevent and respond to cyber threats.”173\n\nThe NATO Communications and Information Agency “is responsible for ensuring that the Alliance has the secure networks, communications and software it needs to guarantee peace and stability for all Allies.” It “also runs the NATO Cyber Security Centre, which is responsible for 24/7 monitoring and defending NATO’s networks from cyber attacks and malicious activity” and upon request “helps Allies and partner countries boost their capabilities in areas such as cyber defence.”174\n\nWith respect to the likely effects of Chinese 5G technology on the sharing of intelligence in Europe, U.S. officials have said that relying on Chinese state-controlled companies for next-generation wireless networks would be “nothing short of madness.”175 A Chinese presence in European telecommunications networks could decisively compromise the communications integrity of both the military and the intelligence community. The 2021 Brussels Statement notes that “NATO and Allies, within their respective authority, will maintain and enhance the security of our critical infrastructure, key industries, supply chains, and communication information networks, including 5G.”176 In April 2023, General Cavoli testified that:\n\nThe PRC’s efforts to expand Huawei 5G networks throughout Europe via PRC state-sponsored firms pose security risks to our Allies and partners. These activities allow the PRC to access and exploit intellectual property, sensitive information, technology, and private personnel information. Beyond economic impacts, these technology-related activities provide the PRC a military capacity that put U.S. national interests in the USEUCOM AOR at risk.177\n\nMany nations have decided to restrict Chinese vendors from 5G networks, but these threat perceptions are not uniform, and even within nations that have taken a more restrictive approach, implementation of decisions remains a significant variable.\n\nRecent research sheds perspective on the cascading impact on NATO member states of China’s becoming embedded in the 5G networks:\n\nHuawei’s emergence as a dominant fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications infrastructure supplier for many countries gives Beijing access to key parts of emerging communications networks, generating choke points of vulnerability for Allied nations. Within fifteen years, 5G is likely to be replaced by dual-use 6G technologies with embedded AI-enabled capabilities of military significance. China is likely to incorporate them into its civil-military fusion strategy, as it has with 5G.178\n\nThe impact of the current patchwork approach to Chinese 5G technology on the European operating environment is a risk that should not be underestimated.\n\nSpace. The most recent Secretary General’s annual report discusses NATO’s increasingly important work in the space domain:\n\nThe space security environment has become more dangerous and unpredictable. At the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies underlined that strategic competitors and potential adversaries are investing in technologies that could restrict the Alliance’s access and freedom to operate in space, degrade space capabilities, target civilian and military infrastructure, impair defence and harm security. The 2022 Strategic Concept highlights that maintaining secure use of and unfettered access to space and cyberspace is key to effective deterrence and defence. NATO Leaders have committed to enhancing the ability to operate effectively in space and cyberspace to prevent, detect, counter and respond to the full spectrum of threats, using all available tools. NATO Leaders also agreed to boost the resilience of space capabilities.179\n\nTo enhance its awareness and common understanding of the space environment, NATO announced plans in 2021 to develop a Strategic Space Situational Awareness System at its Brussels headquarters. The system is being established with funding from Luxembourg and will “allow the Alliance to better understand the space environment and space events, and their effects across all domains.”180 The NATO Space Center established in 2020 at Ramstein, Germany, continues to increase its connections with national space centers. According to the alliance, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, “NATO Space Centre continuously supported the Alliance’s situational awareness, posture management and decisionmaking. In addition, satellite images delivered by Allies were critical for timely intelligence and for monitoring the situation.”181\n\nIn addition, NATO’s military authorities have accepted an offer from France to establish a NATO Centre of Excellence devoted to space in Toulouse. In 2022, space operational activities were integrated into several exercises, including “Loyal Leda 2022, Neptune Strike 2022, Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exercise 2022 and Dynamic Mongoose 2022. These exercises help to maintain the Alliance’s advantage and agility, as well as its ability to withstand jamming and other attempts to disrupt its access to space.”182\n\nBallistic Missile Defense. NATO’s ballistic missile defense (BMD) achieved initial operational capability in July 2016, offering a stronger capability to defend alliance populations, territory, and forces across the southern portion of Europe from a potential ballistic missile attack. For example:\n\nAn Aegis Ashore site in Deveselu, Romania, became operational in May 2016, and upgrades were completed in August 2019.183\n\nAn AN/TPY-2 forward-based early warning BMD radar is located at Kürecik, Turkey, pursuant to the U.S. European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA).184\n\nBMD-capable U.S. Aegis-equipped ships are forward deployed at Rota, Spain.185 General Wolters has characterized Rota’s four current destroyers as the “workhorses of deterrence,” adding that “[w]e currently have a set number of four and the request is for two additional and we have infrastructure in place to be able to house all six in Rota, Spain.”186 In June 2022, the U.S. announced its intention to increase the number of destroyers at Rota to six.187 In January 2023, Spain approved the plan to base two new destroyers at Rota in 2024 and 2025.188\n\nA second Aegis Ashore site in Redzikowo, Poland, was commissioned in September 2020. In March 2023, officials stated that the facility would become operational by the end of the year after summer and fall testing was completed.189\n\nRamstein Air Base in Germany hosts the command center.190\n\nThe U.K. operates an early warning BMD radar at RAF Fylingdales in England. In May 2022, the U.K. announced that its Type 45 destroyers would be upgraded with BMD-capable missiles.191\n\nThe May 2023 Formidable Shield 23 exercise, which “took place over a 1,000 nautical mile area of water space, from northern Norway to the west coast of Scotland,” involved “multiple NATO Allied and partner nations, more than 20 ships and 35 aircraft, and nearly 4,000 personnel from across the NATO Alliance” who “fired 30 missiles across 23 live-fire scenarios against subsonic and supersonic targets testing capability in the air, land and maritime domains.”192\n\nIn January 2017, the Russian embassy in Norway threatened that if Norway contributed ships or radar to NATO BMD, Russia “[would] have to react to defend our security.”193 Norway operates four Fridtjof Nansen–class Aegis-equipped frigates that are not currently BMD-capable.194 A fifth Aegis-equipped frigate, the Helge Ingstad, collided with an oil tanker and sustained so much damage that the government decided to scrap it in 2021.195\n\nDenmark, which agreed in 2014 to equip at least one of its Iver Huitfeldt–class frigates with radar to contribute to NATO BMD, reaffirmed this commitment in the Defence Agreement 2018–2023.196 Russia’s ambassador in Copenhagen responded by publicly threatening Denmark: “I do not believe that Danish people fully understand the consequences of what may happen if Denmark joins the American-led missile defense system. If Denmark joins, Danish warships become targets for Russian nuclear missiles.”197\n\nIn March 2019, the first Dutch De Zeven Provinciën–class frigates received a SMART-L Multi-Mission/Naval (MM/N) D-band long-range radar upgrade that is “capable of BMD mission (surveillance and tracking of ballistic missiles) up to 2000 km while simultaneous[ly] maintaining the air defence capability.”198 In May 2022, the Netherlands announced that for budget reasons, only two of four frigates will receive the radar upgrade and missile upgrades.199 In May 2021, as part of NATO’s Formidable Shield exercise, radar aboard the HNLMS De Zeven Provinciën “was used to eliminate a ballistic missile, marking a first in Europe.”200 In December 2020, the Royal Netherlands and German navies signed an agreement to work jointly to develop a replacement for the Dutch De Zeven Provinciën–class frigate and Germany’s three F124 Sachsen–class frigates.\n\nThe Netherlands and Belgium are jointly procuring two anti–submarine warfare (ASW) frigates apiece, the first of which are to be delivered to the Royal Netherlands Navy and Belgium in 2029 and 2030, respectively.201 The vessels will be equipped with the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile.202 Belgian Admiral Jan de Beurme stated in April 2021 that “we are studying the feasibility of integrating ballistic missile defense shooter capabilities into the new frigates.”203\n\nSpain currently “operates five F-100 Alvaro de Bazan–class Aegis frigates and in 2024 will accept the first F110–class frigate.”204 Spain’s F-100 frigates are not BMD-capable.205 In April 2019, Spain signed an agreement to procure five F-110 multi-mission frigates, the first of which will likely be deployed in 2026. These frigates “will host the [Spanish Navy’s] first naval solid-state S-band radar,” which “will form part of the Aegis Weapon System of the ship’s combat management system SCOMBA.”206\n\nThe Italian Navy is procuring seven multi-role offshore patrol vessels (PPAs) that are to be delivered from 2021–2026. The first of two BMD-capable PPAs in full configuration is scheduled for delivery in 2024.207\n\nQuality of Armed Forces in the Region\n\nArticle 3 of the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty, NATO’s founding document, states that members at a minimum “will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.”208 Regrettably, only a handful of NATO members are living up to their Article 3 commitments.\n\nIn 2022, only seven NATO countries spent the required minimum of 2 percent of GDP on defense: Estonia (2.12 percent); Greece (3.54 percent); Latvia (2.07 percent); Lithuania (2.47 percent); Poland (2.42 percent); the United Kingdom (2.16 percent); and the United States (3.46 percent).209 However, NATO defense spending continues its upward trend: According to the NATO Secretary General’s annual report for 2022, “European Allies and Canada have increased defense spending for the eighth consecutive year. From 2021 to 2022, defense spending increased by 2.2% in real terms. In total, over the last eight years, this increase added USD 350 billion for defense.”210\n\nAlthough less than a third of member states are attaining the 2 percent benchmark, 24 of 30 member states attained the second benchmark by spending 20 percent of defense budgets on equipment in 2022.211\n\nGermany. In February 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz characterized Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine as a “turning point” and pledged that “from now on, we will invest more than 2% of gross domestic product in our defense year for year.”212 An immediate component of Scholz’s pledge was approval of a onetime €100 billion ($107 billion)213 procurement fund to rebuild the nation’s military forces. Germany’s Basic Law (constitution) was amended to allow for creation of the special fund, which is financed through loans.214\n\nDespite Scholz’s pledge, Germany managed to spend only 1.44 percent of GDP on defense in 2022, although it did hit the second NATO spending benchmark by spending 20.9 percent if its defense budget on equipment.215 The Ministry of Defence has stated that €30 billion of the €100 billion is already designated for specific contracts.216 However, some analysts have noted that inflation, taxes, and rising interest payments on the loan have left only €50 billion to €70 billion for actual equipment purchases.217\n\nGermany’s decision to acquire new equipment has been hampered by a sclerotic procurement bureaucracy and long delivery times once decisions are made. In addition, many important areas such as rising fuel costs are not covered by the special fund. As a result, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is reportedly seeking a €10 billion increase in the regular German defense budget.218 According to a Defence Ministry spokesperson, “it is clear that we need a constantly increasing defence budget to cover the needs of the military and to be able to react to conditions such as inflation and price increases.”219\n\nIn 2022, Germany increased the total number of its troops in Lithuania, where it serves as the framework nation for NATO’s EFP battalion, from 1,000 to 1,500.220 In September, Germany permanently deployed the command unit (100 troops plus “equipment for command and control, communications and logistics”) of a brigade with 3,000–5,000 personnel; combat units remain based in Germany and rotate to the region for exercises.221 German officials have stated that the brigade could be sent to Lithuania within 10 days in the event of conflict. Lithuanian Defense Minister Arvydas Anusauskas has said that “[t]he defence strategy of the Baltic states cannot rely only on reinforcements. It has to also rely on trustworthy in-place capabilities. Our geography demands it.”222 Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, however, has stated that the facilities in his nation will not be ready to accept a full German brigade until 2026.223\n\nGermany and Lithuania plan to spend €200 million over the next few years to upgrade facilities used in part by NATO’s EFP. This project will include “building barracks, command spaces, a canteen and training places.”224\n\nIn April 2022, Germany deployed Ozelot short-range self-propelled air defense systems with Stinger missiles to Rukla.225 In August 2022, NATO’s Allied Air Command announced that “[i]n the coming months, Germany augments NATO’s Air Policing mission with their Eurofighter jets flying out of Ämari” and that this was “the 13th time German Air Force fighters support the mission in the Baltic region; Germany led BAP five times in 2005, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012, and was the augmenting nation at Ämari—once a year since 2014.”226 In March 2023, the Luftwaffe announced the initiation of “[j]oint NATO Baltic Air Policing (BAP) missions involving German and British Eurofighter Typhoons” and that “[t]his joint detachment—the first of its kind—will operate under German command until the end of March, after which the German fighters will remain in Estonia throughout April with the mission under British command.”227\n\nGermany maintains 68 troops in Kosovo as part of NATO’s Kosovo Force.228 In February 2023, the Bundestag extended the mandate for “up to 550 soldiers” to participate in NATO’s Sea Guardian maritime security operation through March 31, 2024229 and approved a one-year extension, also through March 31, 2024, of Germany’s participation in the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).230\n\nIn May 2022, Germany announced the end of its participation in the EU Training Mission Mali (EUTM), where 300 German soldiers had served.231 In November 2022, Germany announced that it would be ending its participation in the U.N.’s Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and that all troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2023. Germany took part in MINUSMA for a decade with up to 1,400 troops but faced difficulties that included the breakdown in relations between France and the military junta in Mali, the growing regional presence of Russian mercenaries, and the frequent need to “suspend reconnaissance patrols after being denied flyover rights.”232\n\nIn the Middle East, German forces participate in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) peacekeeping mission, the mandate for which extended through June 2023.233 In October 2022, Germany extended its non-combat training mission in Iraq and its air-to-air refueling, air surveillance radar, and air transport missions in support of the counter-ISIS coalition through the end of October 2023.234\n\nGermany assumed lead authority for NATO’s VJTF in 2023 and “is providing up to 2,700 soldiers as lead nation”235 with Lithuania, Belgium, Latvia, the Netherlands, Czechia, Slovenia, Luxembourg, and Norway also contributing.236 In addition, “[f]or the first time, Germany also leads the VJTF’s designated Special Forces command.”237 In June 2022, Germany announced that it would contribute “15,000 soldiers, 65 aeroplanes, 20 navy units, and other formations to the New Force Model” that was announced at the NATO Summit in Madrid, thereby greatly increasing the strength of the NRF.238 Germany also has reportedly “agreed to provide NATO with a first operational land division in 2025 to support the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), while long-term targets of providing a modern mechanized division by 2027 and a further two divisions, to the alliance by 2031, both remain.”239\n\nAlthough Germany’s forces have taken on additional roles in recent years, its military continues to suffer serious equipment, personnel, and readiness issues. In early 2023, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius stated that decades of neglect had left Germany with “no armed forces that are capable of defending [Germany] that is, capable of defending [it] against an offensive, brutally waged aggressive war.” In February, Chief of the German Army Lieutenant General Alfons Mais noted similarly that “[t]he army that I have the duty to lead is more or less bare.” One evocative example is the reality that only 30 percent of the Army’s 300 Leopard 2 tanks are operational.240\n\nThe navy is not much better off. Problems with submarines include “long yard periods, difficulties with main batteries and the practice of ‘controlled removal’ from some submarines in order to keep others operational.”241 Reports surfaced in March 2021 that “at least 100” German vessels including submarines rely on a Russian navigation system that does not meet NATO standards and that “[d]uring a worst-case cyberattack, navigation data could be hacked and the ship could fully lose operability.”242\n\nAccording to Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces Eva Hoegl’s most recent annual report, “compensat[ing] for all shortages…would require a total of EUR 300 billion,” and it “would take around half a century to completely modernise merely the infrastructure of the Bundeswehr already in existence.”243 Among the many issues raised in the report are kit shortages; shoddy infrastructure; unprofessional and overly bureaucratic personnel management; barracks with walls propped up by sandbags; 66 parachuting accidents; clothing shortages; lack of adequate gear for protecting against biological, chemical, and nuclear attacks; tank shortages that routinely lead to training cancellations; and ammunition shortages. The report estimates that “replenish[ing] the empty ammunition storage sites” would cost “at least EUR 20 billion” but that only “EUR 1.125 billion is available for this purpose in 2023.”244\n\nA memorandum from the Inspector of the Army to the Inspector General of the Bundeswher reportedly states that “without countermeasures,” Germany will not be able to meet its commitment to field a fully equipped Army division by 2025 and calls plans for a second division by 2027 “unrealistic.” The memo reportedly states that under current conditions, “the army will not be able to hold its own in high-intensity combat and will also only be able to fulfill its obligations to NATO to a limited extent.”245\n\nChallenges to the rebuilding of Germany’s military capabilities include a lack of domestic industry capacity, a need to rely on manufacturers to repair and upgrade equipment, manpower shortages, and an outdated and slow procurement structure.246 “The first projects are on the way,” Defence Commissioner Hoegl has said, “but in 2022 our soldiers still haven’t received a single cent from special funds.”247 In January 2023, German officials announced plans to use money from the special fund to purchase “for every soldier in the German armed forces in the next three years” such items as “protective gear, helmets, night vision goggles, [and] rucksacks.”248\n\nIn March 2022, Germany announced an $8.4 billion deal to purchase 35 F-35A fighters “as replacement for the Tornado in the role of nuclear sharing.” The Tornados are to be phased out between 2025 and 2030. The Luftwaffe also announced the purchase of 15 Eurofighter Typhoons “equipped for electronic warfare.”249 German pilots will be trained on the platform in the U.S. beginning in 2026, and training will then move to Germany in 2027, and initial operational capability should be declared in 2028. The planned F-35 base at Büchel will require major upgrades to be ready by 2027.250\n\nGermany has stated that these purchases do not change its commitment to take part in the Future Combat Air System (FCAS). In December 2022, a contract was awarded to develop a flying demonstrator for the FCAS with “in flight demonstrators” sought by 2028 or 2029. This contract covers “FCAS Phase 1B. Running for around three and a half years, this phase will include broader research and technology (R&T) elements, as well as the flying demonstrators themselves and related subsystems.”251 FCAS, which is funded in equal measure by France, Germany, and Spain, has been slowed by industry “[w]orkshare-related delays.”252 After delays awaiting U.S. approval, which is needed because “the Arrow-3 includes technological components developed in the US,” Germany intends to procure the Israeli-made Arrow-3 anti-ballistic missile defense system for $3.1 billion once the Bundestag has given its required approval.253 In March 2021, the Ministry of Defence announced plans to upgrade its Patriot missiles to keep them in service until 2030 and to invest in drone technology rather than a next-generation air defense platform.254\n\nPursuant to Germany’s offer to send Poland three Patriot missile batteries to help defend against incoming missiles, the first two were sent in January 2023 along with 350 German troops.255 The batteries are stationed at Zamość, and “the system comprises more than 10 elements, including radars, guiding units and launchers, which can hold between four and sixteen missiles each.”256 The performance of the IRIS-T air defense system in Ukraine led Germany to purchase eight systems for itself in February.257\n\nGermany operates Europe’s largest fleet of heavy transport aircraft and has taken delivery of 40 of 53 A400M cargo aircraft ordered.258 France and Germany are procuring a joint transport capability with C-130J Hercules aircraft and KC-130J tankers. The French Air and Space Force and the German Luftwaffe are providing two and three of each aircraft, respectively, and all should be received by the end of 2024 with full operating capability expected by 2024–2025.259 A new joint training center for both aircraft in Normandy is scheduled to begin operations in 2024.260 The aircraft will be based at Évreux, France, where “this binational air transport squadron will have unrestricted exchange of aircraft, air crews, and maintainers, as well as technical and logistical support based on a common pool of spare parts and a common service support contract.”261\n\nGermany announced the end of its P-3C ORION maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) modernization program in June 2020. In July 2021, Germany’s Defence Ministry signed a letter of offer and acceptance to procure five P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft under the U.S. government’s Foreign Military Sales process.262 In September 2021, Boeing signed a contract with the U.S. Navy to produce the five planes at a “total price tag” of $1.6 billion with deliveries to begin in 2024.263 In April 2022, “sources confirmed that the German Navy will add 7 additional Boeing P-8A Poseidon to complete a fleet of 12 Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA).”264 In July, parliament approved a $344 million support package for things like training, future software upgrades, and spare parts.265\n\nIn June 2022, Germany announced plans to purchase 60 Block 2 CH-47F Chinook transport helicopters at a cost of $5.36 billion. Each helicopter will have “an aerial-refueling probe to enable connections with the Lockheed KC-130J Hercules and potentially the Airbus A400M airlifter configured as a tanker.”266\n\nIn April 2022, an agreement was struck for the procurement of 140 missiles for Germany’s five Heron TP unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).267 Armed drones have been a contentious political issue for years in Germany, resisted in large part by the Social Democrats. That the decision has now been taken is a significant shift. Germany, France, Italy, and Spain plan to acquire a collective fleet of Eurodrones at an estimated total cost of $7.5 billion. Germany will have seven systems, each with two ground stations and three aircraft.268\n\nIn January 2023, officials stated that all Leopard 2 main battle tanks would be upgraded to the 2A7 configuration; the upgrades, which include digitizing the tanks’ turrets, are expected to keep the Leopards in service until 2045.269 Germany continues to work with France on development of the Main Ground Combat System (MGCS), which will replace both nations’ MBTs270 and is currently projected to reach full operational capability in 2040.271 In addition, contract negotiations are “underway for 133 Boxer heavy weapon carrier (HWC) armored vehicles, which will see deliveries start in 2025 and run through to 2030.”272\n\nGermany’s troubled F-125 Baden-Württemberg–class frigate procurement has been completed. In December 2017, the frigate failed sea trials because of “software and hardware defects.”273 It reportedly had “problems with its radar, electronics and the flameproof coating on its fuel tanks,” was “found to list to the starboard,” and lacked sufficiently robust armaments as well as the ability to add them.274 In addition, the frigate’s ability to defend against aerial attack is so deficient that the ship may be fit only for “stabilization operations,” and the lack of sonar and torpedo tubes makes it vulnerable to attack by submarines.275 Germany returned the ship to the shipbuilder following delivery.276 The redesigned Baden-Württemberg was belatedly commissioned in June 2019, and Germany took delivery of the fourth and final F-125 in January 2022.277\n\nIn January 2020, Germany awarded a $6.7 billion contract to the Dutch Damen Shipyards for the next-generation F-126 frigate.278 Damen is building the frigates “together with its [German] partners Blohm+Voss and Thales,” and the first of four ordered (with the possibility of another two) is to be delivered in 2028.279 In November 2022, Damen signed an agreement with Rheinmetall to produce two MLG27-4.0 naval guns for each vessel.280\n\nIn July 2021, Germany and Norway signed an agreement for a joint program to construct six Type 212CD submarines, two for Germany and four for Norway, the first of which are to be delivered to the Norwegian Navy in 2029 with Germany taking delivery of its submarines in 2032 and 2034.281 German K130 Corvette procurement is currently at least two years behind schedule, and it is not expected that the first of five vessels will be commissioned until 2025 at the earliest.282\n\nGermany has increased its presence in the Indo-Pacific. The frigate Bayern returned in February 2022 from a seven-month deployment that included official port visits to Australia, Japan, India, Israel, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.283 In March 2022, the Luftwaffe deployed six Eurofighters, four transport aircraft, three air-to-air refueling tankers, 100 tons of matériel, and 250 soldiers to Darwin, Australia, for military exercises with allies. Transferring the deployment to Singapore en route to Darwin took place in less than 24 hours as part of a “strategic deployment capability.”284\n\nGerman Indo-Pacific deployments are visible and strategically valuable, but they also strain the military. According to one analyst, the six-month deployment of the Bayern to the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean, and Pacific theater beginning in August 2021 “came ‘at the price of gutting the fleet,’ with ship maintenance plans and training schedules altered to accommodate the Bayern mission.” Even Germany’s robust contribution to Baltic Air Policing closer to home “takes everything it has, often at the expense of training initiatives.”285\n\nGermany also suffers from a shortage of personnel. The military, which as of December 31, 2022, included “183,051 service personnel,” has “a long way to go to achieve the target figure [of 203,000 personnel] by 2031, especially with numbers of applications also declining significantly by around 11 per cent in [2022].”286\n\nGermany’s significant cultural aversion to military service remains a difficult obstacle to overcome. A survey in August 2022 found that “52 percent of Germans said the country should continue practicing restraint in international crises, and 68 percent rejected the notion that Germany should become a leading military power in Europe.”287\n\nFrance. France has one of NATO’s most capable militaries and retains an independent nuclear deterrent capability. It rejoined NATO’s Integrated Command Structure in 2009 but remains outside the alliance’s nuclear planning group.\n\nIn 2022, France spent 1.89 percent of GDP on defense and 28.55 percent of defense spending on equipment, just short of both NATO benchmarks.288 In January 2023, President Emmanuel Macron announced a major increase in defense spending: a planned $450 billion for 2024—2030 compared to $320 billion for 2019—2025, an increase of over one-third.289 The previous military program law (LPM) focused on expeditionary forces and counterterrorism; the upcoming LPM will focus largely on high-intensity state-on-state warfare.290 France is also planning to add €1.5 billion to its 2023 defense budget with increases of €3.1 billion in 2024; €3 billion each year in 2025, 2026, and 2027; and €4.3 billion each year in 2028, 2029, and 2030.291\n\nFollowing the Cold War, France drew down the capabilities needed for peer-to-peer conflict. Between 1991 and 2021, “the number of battle tanks dropped from 1,349 to 222, the number of fighters from 686 to 254, the number of large surface ships from 41 to 19 and its active-duty manpower from 453,000 to 203,000.” “Today, the French Army is beautiful,” French General Eric Laval has said, “but in a high intensity conflict, would it be able to hold beyond 48 hours? High intensity would imply potentially very tough battles which could last between 72 to 96 hours and which we are not allowed to lose.” Chief of the Army General Pierre Schill has described the current transformation process as the “most important modernization undergone since World War II.”292\n\nThe new LPM focuses on such areas as nuclear modernization, drone/anti-drone technology, air defenses, and intelligence gathering.293 “Nuclear deterrence,” according to President Macron, “is an element that makes France different from other countries in Europe. We see anew, in analysing the war in Ukraine, its vital importance.”294 French intelligence agencies will see a 60 percent increase in their budgets, although some analysts have predicted that high energy prices and inflation will reduce the value of that increase. “Capabilities in all layers of air defense will increase by at least 50 percent,” Macron has explained, “obviously including anti-drone technologies.” Long-range strike capability, the suppression of enemy air defense, and anti-submarine warfare “are all part of these priorities.”295\n\nThe LPM also calls for France to maintain a focus on its overseas territories, particularly in the Indo-Pacific,296 and to expand industrial capacity. “An issue we unfortunately rediscovered with the war in Ukraine is the issue of the ammunition stocks,” Armed Forces Minister Sébastien Lecornu has said. “We will need a ten-year period of time to upgrade all infrastructures and equipment of our military.”297\n\nAir Force procurements include an upgrade to the aerial refueling and airlift fleet. In February 2020, France received the second of two KC-130J Super Hercules.298 It also has been introducing new A330 MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker Transport) aircraft and as of April 30, 2023, had received nine of 13 ordered.299 France has received 21 of 50 A400M Atlas military transport aircraft ordered, and the “military programming law plans for a fleet of 25 A400Ms to be in service in 2025.”300 In October 2020, the government announced that the final 10 NH90 Tactical Troop Helicopters on order for delivery in 2025 and 2026 would be upgraded to meet special forces requirements.301\n\nIn January 2023, Macron announced that France would move to an “all-Rafale force” by 2035.302 France signed a $2.3 billion agreement with Dassault Aviation in January 2019 for development of the F4 Standard upgrade to the Rafale fighter aircraft, the first of which was received in March 2023. The “new standard includes upgrades to existing capabilities like the Thales AESA radar and Talios targeting pod along with the Rafale’s electronic warfare system and communications suite,” and “the Thales Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display, MBDA’s MICA NG (Next-Generation) air-to-air missile and the 1,000 kilogram variant of Safran’s AASM (armement air-sol modulaire) ‘Hammer’ precision-guided munition” are among the plane’s “new capabilities.”303 France is expecting to receive 13 Rafales during the year with deliveries of another 40 to be completed by 2025.304 Forty-two additional Rafales will be ordered in 2023, partly to backfill aircraft sold to Croatia in 2021.\n\nIntroduction of the Rafale F5 standard is planned for the 2035–2038 period. It is expected that the F5 will “further improve connectivity,” “have enhanced manned/unmanned teaming capabilities,” and “be capable of carrying the new ASN4G hypersonic ramjet missile, which will ensure the continuity of the airborne component of the French nuclear deterrent, replacing the ASMP-A missile.”305\n\nIn May 2021, France, Germany, and Spain signed an agreement to develop a flying demonstrator aircraft for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), which is to begin entering service in 2040.306 In December 2022, the governments working on FCAS awarded a $3.4 billion contract to develop flying demonstrators by 2028 or 2029.307 In March 2022, France announced that it would upgrade 42 of 67 Tiger MkIII attack helicopters at a cost of $3.06 billion with delivery expected in 2029.308 Because a lack of German interest has made the planned capability upgrades increasingly unaffordable, “the less extensive Tiger upgrade now planned may lack new missiles,” although it “retains sensors and communication enhancements that perhaps can be paired with pre-existing advanced missiles….”309\n\nFrance established a 220-person Space Command under the French Air Force in September 2019. In September 2022, Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne announced that France would increase its space investments by 25 percent ($9 billion) over the next three years with launch vehicles as “a major priority.”310 In January 2021, NATO approved a Center of Excellence for Military Space to be located alongside French Space Command in Toulouse. The first researchers arrived in 2021, and the center is to be fully staffed by 2025.311\n\nFrance intends to have a “fully capable” system to defend its space assets in place by 2030. “If our satellites are threatened,” then-Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly stated in 2019, “we intend to blind those of our adversaries. We reserve the right and the means to be able to respond: that could imply the use of powerful lasers deployed from our satellites or from patrolling nano-satellites.”312 However, in November 2022, France pledged “not to conduct destructive direct-ascent anti-satellite missile tests.”313\n\nIn March 2021, with German and U.S. space forces also participating, France launched AsterX, its first military exercise in space, “to evaluate its ability to defend its satellites and other defense equipment from an attack.”314 AsterX 23 took place in February and March 2023, again with the U.S. participating. Instead of “the time-lapse approach used in previous editions, the 2023 iteration took place “in real-time,” which “provides increased tactical realism during the phases of data processing and space situation analysis.”315 France is reportedly working on a ground-to-space laser system and planning to launch “a new orbital space surveillance project, using nanosatellites to patrol Geostationary Orbit (GEO), identify potential on-orbit threats to national assets, and if necessary, disable the threat with an on-board laser.”316\n\nArmy procurements include Kochi HK416 Assault Rifles, more than 50 percent of which had been delivered as of March 2022; 300 ANAFI USA micro-drones; and 364 Serval Armored Vehicles ordered in 2021 with the possibility of more than 900 being ordered by 2030.317 As of January 2023, the Army had received 38 JAGUAR armored reconnaissance and combat vehicles and 452 GRIFFON multi-role armored vehicles since 2019.318 In December 2022, the Army ordered 50 upgraded Leclerc tanks, 18 of which are set to be delivered in 2023.319 The upgrade includes a new fire control system as well as “enhanced protection against mines and rockets” and “a 7.62-millimeter remotely-operated turret to support urban combat.”320\n\nFrance plans to invest €58 million in the Main Ground Combat System, a next-generation tank that is being developed jointly with Germany.321 The program, however, remains stuck in study and design, a sluggish start that the French Armed Forces Minister, in February 2023 testimony before a committee of the French Senate, “appeared to attribute…largely to discord between the ambitions of the German government and its industry vendors as well as industry infighting.”322\n\nOne major project is an upgrade to the French sea-based and air-based nuclear deterrent. The French military procurement agency test-fired the M51.2, the current three-stage, sea-land strategic ballistic missile (without a warhead), in April 2021 as part of a development program for the M51.3, which is expected in 2025.323\n\nFrance’s sea-based deterrent is provided by four Le Triomphant–class ballistic missile submarines.324 In March 2022, in response to Russian aggression and threats, France reportedly had three of its four ballistic missile submarines at sea at the same time—something that has not happened in decades. Similar messaging was behind the successful test of the ASMP-A air-launched nuclear weapon in March 2022.325\n\nThe government launched France’s third-generation ballistic missile submarine program in February 2021. Delivery of the first submarine is planned for 2035 with three additional subs to be delivered every five years after that. Former Armed Forces Minister Parly has described the third-generation submarines in colorful terms as able to “hear better and defend themselves better whilst at the same time being more silent: They will not make more noise than a school of shrimp.”326\n\nOther major naval procurements include $1.09 billion through 2025 for the design phase of a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier (a model of which was unveiled in October 2022) that will deploy 32 Future Combat Aircraft Systems and is planned to enter service in 2038.327 In December 2021, the U.S. Department of State’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) cleared a potential $1.3 billion sale to France of an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS), an Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) system, and related equipment for its new carrier, which will incorporate two or three relatively new electromagnetic catapult systems. According to the DSCA, “[t]he proposed sale will result in continuation of interoperability between the United States and France.”328 In August 2022, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) awarded a contract for the development of EMALS and AAG for the French carrier.329\n\nThe Suffren, the first of six new fifth-generation Barracuda–class nuclear-powered attack submarines, was commissioned in November 2020.330 The second, the Duguay-Trouin, began sea trials in March 2023.331 The remaining four, the Tourville, De Grasse, Rubis, and Casabianca, “are scheduled for delivery no later than 2030.”332\n\nFrance is procuring five defense and intervention frigates, the first of which is due in 2024 and the second and third of which are due in 2025.333 In November 2022, the French Navy took delivery of the FREMM multi-mission frigate Lorraine, the last of eight FREMMs procured.334 The final two have enhanced air defense capabilities in addition to the focus on anti-submarine warfare that characterizes the six that were delivered between 2012 and 2019.335\n\nIn November 2020, France announced the overhaul of its mine countermeasures systems by 2029.336 In the same month, France and the U.K. signed a production contract for the joint Système de lutte anti-mines futur (SLAM-F) program, known in the U.K. as the Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) system, which “combines unmanned underwater and surface vehicles and should enable sailors to operate outside of the mine field.”337 Identical unmanned mine-hunting demonstrators were delivered to France and the U.K. in December 2021.338 The SLAM program’s first mine warfare drones are expected in 2023.339\n\nIn December 2016, France opened a cyber-operational command.340 In April 2023, the Ministry of Defense announced that among the planned investments in the government’s proposed 2024–2030 military programing law is “€4 billion for cyber defense.” Other plans outlined in the latest LPM include “€16 billion for munitions, including the modernization of long-range anti-ship missiles, as well as F321 heavy torpedoes and new surface-to-air and air-to-air interceptors (MBDA’s Aster-MICA and METEOR families, respectively);” “€10 billion for innovative technology investments, to include directed energy technology, swarming drones, and robotic capabilities;” and “€6 billion for the space domain.”341\n\nFrance, which has NATO’s third-largest complement of active-duty personnel,342 withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2014, although all of its combat troops had left in 2012. France continues to remain engaged in the fight against the Islamic State, deploying 600 troops in Operation Chammal.343 In February 2022, the Charles de Gaulle Carrier Strike Group undertook a three-month operational deployment to the Mediterranean that included support for Operation Chammal. During the deployment, the CSG took part in “‘tri carrier operations’ with the Italian Navy…Cavour CSG and the U.S. Navy’s Truman CSG” to “maintain interoperability between allied navies, and train with new assets such as Italian F-35Bs, and American E-2D Advanced Hawkeye aircraft.”344\n\nIn November 2022, the CSG left France again for a deployment to the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean in Mission Antares. “During the Mediterranean phase of the deployment, the Charles De Gaulle CSG included U.S. Navy destroyer USS Arleigh Burke (DDG-51), Italian Navy frigate ITS Virginio Fasan (F 591) and the Hellenic Navy frigate HS Adrias (F459).” In January 2023, the Charles de Gaulle and a French Maritime Patrol Aircraft took part in bilateral exercises with the Indian Navy off the western Indian coast. Simultaneously, a French A330 MRTT and three Rafales deployed to a Singaporean air force base for exercises.345\n\nFrance’s contributions to NATO deterrence missions"
