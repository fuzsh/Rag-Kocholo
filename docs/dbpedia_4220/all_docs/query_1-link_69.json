        "text": "Has anyone ever created a scenario based upon or replicating Operation Pedestal?\n\nI ask because I've just read Max Hastings latest work regarding the battle and it struck me that the story would make an excellent subject for Harpoon - lots of potential 'what ifs' available on both sides.\n\nI've had a quick look through the User Scenario database but didn't spot anything but if anyone knows better - and I'm sure someone does - I'd be grateful to be pointed in the right direction.\n\nMany thanks.\n\nTony,\n\nThanks for your reply.\n\nI hadn't looked, or thought of looking, at sources outside Harpoon to see if anyone else had made a game/scenario out of Operation Pedestal and I'm slightly surprised it hasn't been done.\n\nAs for what I had in mind, WWII or something more modern, my initial thought was tending to WWII. I'm sure a good designer could have had, indeed could still have, lots of fiendish fun versus we hapless players with the historical events. Land-based aircraft, submarines and fast-attack boats (and I didn't realise the Italian boats had wreaked such havoc). Moreover, the potential \"what ifs\" that Hastings speculated about in the book about the consequences of what might have occurred had the Italians sortied its main battleships while Force Z was still in company or, again, what the impact would have been on the outcome if Italian 7th Cruiser Sqn had not turned back when it did.\n\nI confess I did toy with idea of a later, 1970s-1980s World War III-esque type of thing, going a bit further than Malta (I had Cyprus in mind). But, my imagination running amok, I saw it involving, say, hostile Arab nations beefed-up with Russian equipment and advisors, Russia itself committing its Black Sea fleet and relevant air assets, Turkey abandoning Nato to throw its lot in with the Russians (on the promise of getting the whole of Cyprus perhaps?) while the EU remained supine in the face of Russian threats. The size and complexity of such a project would require the brains and brawn (in the form of Harpoon expertise I mean) that I simply don't possess.\n\nBut if anybody fancies the challenge...!"
