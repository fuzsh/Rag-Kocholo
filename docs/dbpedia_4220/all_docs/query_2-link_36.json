        "text": "Paper presented at inaugural Yale Naval history Conference (20-21 April 2018) The interwar period was characterised by growing multipolar rivalry and the ascendancy of new great naval powers, among them Fascist Italy. Under the dictatorship of Mussolini, Italy started a season of aggressive foreign policy, to assert its role as the dominant power in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, in contrast with the declining British and French Empires. Naval power was at the centre of this confrontation, and the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) spent over twenty years in developing strategies to face a multi-navy great power rivalry and the presence of hostile small and medium navies. Its plans covered the broad region of the “Enlarged Mediterranean”, which also encompassed the Eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Western Indian Ocean. The paper, using sources from the Italian archives, will discuss the evolution of Italian naval strategy during these period and geographical areas. The paper will start analysing the impact of the Great War on Italian naval strategy, which in the early interwar period developed around the rivalry with France, fuelled by the naval disarmament policy started by the Washington Treaty. The discussion will encompass the planning for defending Italian sea-lanes in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, and how this necessity influenced the Italian naval policy and diplomatic efforts to secure parity with France. The analysis will also discuss the role of lesser powers (Spain, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey), and their fleets in the development of Italian strategy and plans, and how this interacted with Fascist diplomacy and strategy. The second part will discuss Italian naval strategy in the ‘30, when the rise of Britain as a main naval opponent in the Mediterranean, worsened the condition of the strategic and numerical inferiority of the Italian Navy. Facing the double rivalry of France and Britain, Regia Marina was forced to develop sophisticated plans centred on the concept of naval attrition, to counter the enemy’s numerical superiority. These projects were based on the massive use of new weapons (airpower, submarines, mine warfare and special weapons) to defend the Central Mediterranean while using decoy forces to distract enemy units in the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. As the paper will show, the early failure of the Regia Marina in the Second World War was largely caused by the failure of these plans, which required a highly trained and technologically advanced fleet that Fascist Italy proved unable to build. In conclusion, the paper will discuss the case of a “small great power” and its way to face a multipolar great naval powers world.\n\nThe scuttling of the French fleet in November 1942 brought an abrupt end to a political tug of war which had been ongoing since the Italian occupation of France began in 1940. The seizure of the French fleet had been explicitly forbidden by the Italo–French armistice, which represented the cornerstone of all Italo–French diplomatic transactions. This research note seeks to demonstrate the role played by the French fleet and its use as a political pawn by both sides to change the existing political structures. For France, the overhaul of the Italo–French armistice would offer greater political power and status, whilst for Italy a more encompassing agreement would allow greater exploitation of France both in a political and an economic sense. This research note argues that the status of the French fleet represented a crucial and often overlooked aspect of this struggle.\n\nAfter the First World War, all major combatants analysed the conflict to draw lessons for the future developments of their navies. Since its origins, the Italian Navy was influenced by the British and French naval thinking, but the rise of the Fascist regime made Italy trapped in a great power competition against a possible coalition of far superior in naval powers. This change in the Italian politics induced the search for a new model for the development of the Italian strategic naval thinking and naval policy. In this shift, the works of former officers of the German Imperial Navy, translated into Italian during ‘920 and ‘930, started to grow in influence, offering a possible answer for the strategic dilemmas faced by Fascist Italy at sea. Tirpitz's theories of the Navy as deterrence instrument for the foreign policy, as well that the political leadership hampered the action of the Imperial Navy, and Raeder’s studies about cruiser warfare in the oceans, exercised a deep influence on the development of the Italian fleet. War plans, C-in-C structure and attempts to build a diversionary force to operate in the oceans, to distract British and French forces from the Mediterranean, were a consequence of this influence. Also, the strategic planning of the Italian Navy during 1930s, characterised by the will to destroy part of the enemy force in a decisive engagement in favourable conditions, become influenced by the German experience. The proposed discussed at the McMullen analysed this shift in the Italian Navy, connecting it to the problems of foreign policy and naval strategy faced by Fascist Italy. It will show how deep was the influence of the experience of the German Imperial Navy in interwar Italian naval thinking and policy, paving in part the way for the problems in the development of the Italian fleet in the years preceding the Second World War.\n\nThe 14-15 September 2017, the McMullen naval history symposium was held at the U.S. Naval Academy. The Symposium, the largest conference of naval history in the world, drawn scholars from all over the world to discuss of seapower, maritime and naval history. My paper discussed \"The maritime origins of the Italian crisis of 1917\" showing the impact of submarine warfare on Italy during the First World War. The aim of the paper was to show that for a full comprehension of the naval history of that conflict a more global approach, focused less on the Anglo-German confrontation, will be necessary to understand the maritime dimension of the conflict. In particular in reference to the European continental powers."
