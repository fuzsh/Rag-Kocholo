        "text": "They were almost identical. Both the French and Italian navies were \"35%\" navys established by the interwar treaties along with Germany(who gets added to this group by the Anglo-German naval treatys). 100% refers to the US and UK's allowance in these treaties. These 35% navies especially France and Italy were very similar in size 1-4 modern battleships, 3-4 WW1 battleships(Germany had 2 pre dreadnoughts), about 7 heavy cruisers(in germans case counting the pocket battleships) and 15 light cruisers(the germans had only 6), The Euro powers did not really build beyond the treaty framework because the war started shortly thereafter and most naval construction beyond the treaties was cancelled outside of the US and Japan. All three of these navies had small differences from that basic framework but were pretty evenly matched. The main point is none of these navies had many units and none of the navies could take heavy losses without being crippled(as demonstrated by the Norway campaign and Cape Matapan). Luck would have a lot in determing which one of these 3 surface fleets would win because any 1 battle could change the conflicts outcome. The Italians and Germans put together were a nuisance for the UK as the smaller navies of WW2 favored the smaller powers(assuming they couldn't outproduce the enemy at will like the US) as a numerical advantage because x percent advantage is less ships. If it is Germany and Italy versus France alone they win(even without factoring in subs) so I'm going to compare France, Italy and also Germany seperately.\n\nThe Italian advantage was that by 1942 they had 3 15 inch gunned capital ships with a fourth on the way. These ships also had 1 more gun than their peers and the longest range(though it's reliability varied). The French and German navies each had(or would have had) 2 modern battleships with their second pair being noticeably weaker as they were built to fight specific unique warships(Dunkerques were built to fight the German pocket battleships, Scharnhorsts were built to fight the Dunkerques). The UK was the only other European power to have a squadron(4 ships+) of modern capital ships which were limited to 14 inch guns(shells were 300-400 pounds lighter than the 15 inch guns the other Euro battleships were using) because the UK was the only one adhering to a treaty at that point everyone else expected to collapse. That oversight made the Italian navy particularly her battleships a greater threat to the RN when the RN couldn't give the Italians their full undivided attention. Another advantage is the Italians light cruisers group are the fastest and I think has the best group of 15.\n\nThe French advantage is I think the Richelieus were the best European battleship of it's generation. Not only did it have the heaviest shells and the most speed but it had all it's main guns forward which meant it could focus on it's main guns on an opponent without exposing it's side. In WW1 where there were more ships and battleships operated like armored ships of the line this made little sense as the goal was to cross the enemy's T and have many ships shoot all their guns at at the enemy columm which wouldn't be able to fire back much. The treatys meant that no navy had enough ships especially battleships to form a traditional battle line and that surface actions were more likely to be 1v1, 2v2 or a small group of ships. In that context intentionally exposing the ships to use it's power never made sense. That being said they were 2 of these ships and a third which would have been completed in mid to late WW2. But with so few modern battleships 1-2 ships and their combat ability really matters.\n\nGermany has the most differences from this group. Their advantage was the pocket battleships could defeat any cruiser. The Graf Spee more than held it's own against 3 cruisers. The British had about 68 total cruisers to hunt the pocket battleships with, the French and Italians would have 22. Graf Spee was very unlikely to run into as many opponents if Germany's fighting France or Italy. Throw in Scharnhorst and Gneisenau(not to mention the U-Boats) and they'd be 5 cruiser killers running around. The main German disadvantage is Germany has a lot fewer light cruisers and Germany doesn't have WW1 battleships except pre dreadnoughts while France and Italy do.\n\nAnother important factor is all these navies new capital ships come into service in the spring of 1940-1942. The random timing of the conflict would itself push the scales in the direction of one navy or another. If this war happens in 1939 none of these navies have modern battleships making it even more unpredictable.\n\nIndustrial naval warfare is mostly a story of mismatches. The UK v Germany and Italy in WW2 is about as even a matchup as we get between great powers surface navies and there's not much action for a variety of reasons(not many capital ships, Germany preferring merchant raiding, the rise of air power, the arrival of US etc). France v Italy would have been a very even battle. It's very hard to predict which way it would have went.\n\nI had an inkling that I had watched a rather nice video about that relatively recently. Here it is:\n\nThe Italian R.M. is very much under under-appreciated. At the beginning of the war (either 1939 or Italy's entry in June 1940) the fleet projected a very serious threat to both the French and to the Royal Navy in the Med. Its strength was quite impressive:\n\n-- Six battleships - four heavily reconstructed; two Littorio-class ready in early 1940, and two more under construction.\n\n-- Seven heavy cruisers - treaty cruisers, all completed after 1928.\n\n-- Twelve light cruisers - all completed in the 1930s, with 11 more under construction.\n\n-- Fifty-four destroyers - 14 from the 1920s and 40 large 2,500-ton ships built in the 1930s\n\nThe Italian concentration on torpedo tactics added a large number of torpedo craft to the fleet:\n\n-- Sixty-four torpedo boats.\n\n-- About 100 submarines - 36 large fleet subs, and over 60 coastal subs.\n\n-- There were, characteristic of the R.M., large numbers of MAS motor torpedo boats and midget submarines which were used very aggressively by Italy.\n\nIt was a powerful fleet. Italy gave as good as it got up until Cape Matapan and there were several surface actions involving battleships and cruisers. Google the naval actions off Calabria, at Spartivento and the first and second battles of Sirte. Also, for the ongoing defense of Malta, see Operation Vigorous. Mostly the Med was about attacking and defending convoys, but there were other naval battles.\n\nThe weaknesses of the navy were similar to those of Italy in general in 1940. There were limited natural resources and limited industrial capacity which impacted both production and logistical adequacy.\n\nTechnologically, the lack of sophisticated sonar (only hydrophones were available), and of radar, was a great disadvantage. The 'Gufo' radar arrived way too late and very few were installed.\n\nThe navy did not have its own air arm, and even the float planes operating from cruisers and battleships were piloted by air force personnel (AFAIK). There was no aircraft carrier or effective seaplane carrier with the fleet.\n\nIt is an interesting navy, however. The ships themselves were modern, well designed and fast. The photos I have seen are virtually all of very handsome ships of all types and classes."
