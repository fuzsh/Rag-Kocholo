        "text": "Best of the Best\n\n9 best craft breweries and taprooms to visit in Greater Boston\n\nBoston’s relationship with beer is a long and storied one (the Bell in Hand Tavern, said to be the oldest in America, poured its first drink in 1795). Still, some of the most inventive craft breweries here are decidedly modern, from Aeronaut’s chic industrial space to Roundhead’s inventive Peruvian flavors. As an added bonus, many offer live music, trivia nights, games, and special events. Wherever you are around the area, a locally brewed cold one is never far away.\n\nAeronaut Brewing Co.\n\nTucked into a sleepier corner of Somerville, the quirky, industrial watering hole feels more like your best friend’s backyard than the award-winning brewery that it is. Brews with whimsical names — A Year with Dr. Nandu, Mechanical Luchador — pack a unique and vibrant taste that truly can’t be found elsewhere (see: Tangerine Coriander Sour Planet). Bring your own food if you’d like, but Carolicious Venezuelan Food cooks up arepas and tequeños that should not be missed. With live music, trivia nights, and more, the place is popular, but seating is plentiful — both indoors and outside, where pets are also welcome. Aeronaut also runs an outdoor beer garden in Allston during the summer months.\n\nAddress:\n\n14 Tyler Street, Somerville\n\nPhone:\n\n617-987-4236\n\nFind online:\n\nDorchester Brewing Co.\n\nAn indoor-outdoor greenhouse/roof deck with a view of the Boston skyline is the main attraction here, but don’t be fooled into thinking the Dorchester Brewing Co. doesn’t also make some seriously delicious beer. New Moon is the wheat beer you’ll want to drink under the sun, but the must-try brew here is Cobblestone, a Boston dry stout that’s relatively low in alcohol and meant for a relaxed afternoon of kicking back.\n\nAddress:\n\n1250 Massachusetts Avenue, Dorchester\n\nPhone:\n\n617-514-0900\n\nFind online:\n\nHarpoon Brewery & Beer Hall\n\nHarpoon cofounder Dan Kenary will be the first to tell you about how rough-and-tumble the Seaport was when Harpoon began brewing there in 1986. Much has changed since then: While there are still workers packaging seafood nearby, Harpoon’s beer hall now also bustles with bartenders serving up the brewery’s eponymous IPA, as well as hazy, UFO series wheat beers. An onsite pickleball league and events such as Octoberfest draw huge crowds. While handmade pretzels and Sicilian square-cut pizza are the only regular food options here (check the schedule for periodic food truck visits), they are frankly all you need.\n\nAddress:\n\n306 Northern Avenue, Seaport\n\nPhone:\n\n617-456-2322\n\nFind online:\n\nLamplighter Brewing Co.\n\nLamplighter’s original, light-filled location on Broadway in Cambridge is part coffee shop (called Pepita Coffee Co.) and part brewery where you can, theoretically, make the switch from hot cortado to cold beer at 11 a.m. Rabbit Rabbit double IPA is the go-to here, but the brewery’s creative stylings also include a mix of sours, stouts, and saisons. A second location now serves customers (and charcuterie boards) near the Green Line’s Lechmere stop.\n\nAddress:\n\n284 Broadway, Cambridge\n\nPhone:\n\n617-945-0450\n\nWebsite:\n\nLong Live Roxbury\n\nSometimes a person doesn’t like beer. Sometimes that person finds themselves at a brewery with companions who love beer. That’s OK at Long Live, a place with highly-rated IPAs for the hopheads, and plenty of distractions for those who’d rather be anywhere but a brewery. It’s a comforting spot with excellent food (rotating trucks, as well as in-house pre-packaged picnic snacks, such as cured meats and cheese), and stouts that taste so much like chocolate, even a non-beer lover will be sated. There’s also entertainment; Long Live has been hosting jazz artists on Thursday nights, and when there’s an arts-and-craft event — like the bonsai bar — it feels like you’re at a giant birthday party. (The company’s original taproom and brewery is in Providence.)\n\nAddress:\n\n152 Hampden Street, Roxbury\n\nPhone:\n\n617-334-5633\n\nFind online:\n\nNotch Brewing\n\nFans of Czech, German, and Polish beers will love Notch, which features several offerings in the style of each country, poured properly and served in the traditional glassware. The brewery in Brighton has the feel of a biergarten, with communal benches and fare including a sausage board, soft pretzels, and tinned fish plate to match, and there’s a second location in Salem.\n\nAddress:\n\n525 Western Avenue, Brighton\n\nPhone:\n\n617-548-2947\n\nFind online:\n\nRemnant Brewing\n\nDid someone say patio beers? Remnant’s small but thoughtful taproom and patio spaces at Bow Market make for an ideal remote work outpost. But if you’re lucky enough to be off the clock, you can focus on the beer, which includes Dream Pop, a pale ale brewed with oats from Hadley’s Valley Malt. Bow Street Session is nicely balanced ale, brewed with Massachusetts-grown hops. Remnant describes itself as one of the few breweries in the world that is woman-owned and brewer-owned. The Cambridge outpost, Satellite, also offers outdoor seating.\n\nAddress:\n\nBow Market, 2 Bow Market Way, Somerville\n\nPhone:\n\n617-764-0641\n\nWebsite:\n\nRoundhead Brewing Co.\n\nIt may say something about Boston that more than one brewery here has been started by soccer dads who met on the sidelines of their kids’ games. In this case, Roundhead Brewing co-owners Luis Espinoza and Craig Panzer have been building a community since 2022, serving Peruvian-inspired beer and food in Roundhead’s Hyde Park taproom. Contigo Lager is light and refreshing, while Chimú, a Peruvian red ale, is brewed with purple corn and has notes of caramel and toffee.\n\nAddress:\n\nWestinghouse Plaza Building, Number 10, Hyde Park\n\nPhone:\n\n617-360-7070\n\nFind online:\n\nTrillium Brewing\n\nThe O.G.s remember lining up outside Trillium’s original, tiny Fort Point location to fill growlers with IPAs including Mettle and Congress Street. Those beers are still being made, and served at additional Trillium locations around the area — in the Fenway, outdoors on the Greenway in the summer (where food trucks visit), and more — where visitors can sip on styles ranging from stouts to wild farmhouse ales inside a modern glass-and-steel structure. Pro tip: Split one of Trillium’s special bottles. Trillium Fenway’s outdoor patio is key, as is proximity to the culinary options of Time Out Market next door.\n\nAddress:\n\n50 Thomson Place, Fort Point\n\nPhone:\n\n857-449-0083\n\nWebsite:\n\nBoston Globe Best of the Best winners for 2024 were selected by Globe newsroom staff and correspondents, and limited to Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline. We want to hear from you: Did your favorites make the list?\n\nAdvertisement"
