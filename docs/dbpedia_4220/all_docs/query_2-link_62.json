        "text": "Italian Carrier Strike Group Starts Five-Month Deployment To The Indo-Pacific | Naval News More European naval deployments to the Indo-Pacific. Continuing to highlight not only the connectivity between Europe and the Indo-Pacific, but also the importance of having the ability to project naval power. ' IT CSG will reach the Northern Australia area and Darwin to participate in the important biennial exercise Pitch Black, which will be conducted between mid-July and August beginning. In addition to having the opportunity to fly in a huge training area, the Italian Navy F-35Bs and AV-8Bs will operate together with assets from the Royal Australian Air Force, USMC, South-East Asia, Pacific and European air forces. They will also interact and operate alongside the Italian Air Force combat and support assets including Eurofighters and F-35A/Bs which will also participate in the Exercise Pitch Black. After the stop in Australia, the IT CSG is expected to operate with the US Armed Forces in the Central Pacific basin before reaching Japan by the end of August, Naval News understood, calling at JMSDF’s Yokosuka naval base'. https://lnkd.in/gsPjwgnn\n\nCarrier Strike Group success as task group completes UK phase of NATO exercise The Royal Navy’s Carrier Strike Group, led by HMS Prince of Wales, is now operating around the ice-cold Norwegian fjords after successfully completing Joint Warrior. The aircraft carrier was joined by more than 30 ships, four submarines, multiple aircraft from maritime patrol to F-35 Lightning jets and more than 20,000 personnel from nations including Canada, Denmark, France and Spain. Joint Warrior is one part of NATO’s biggest exercise in a generation – Steadfast Defender. It was the UK-led phase of the exercise which saw surface, air and land scenarios played out to see how NATO nations and allied partners can work closely and react to hostilities. The Royal Navy’s Joint Exercise Training and Planning Staff (JTEPS) plans, delivers and executes such training with the aim of making it as real to life as possible. Commodore Andrew Ingham, Commander Fleet Operational Standards and Training, said: “JTEPS, as the formation level training arm of FOST, deliver high end and realistic multi-domain warfare training to UK, NATO and partner nation Maritime Task groups. “By conducting large scale multinational exercises, such as Nordic Response, JTEPS are able to strive for maximum lethality and readiness.” He added: ‘’Through careful planning, effective orchestrating and detailed evaluation we are able to ensure that the alliance’s most powerful naval assets are consistently challenged against realistic and credible threat scenarios. “Their work supporting the largest NATO exercise in 50 years is absolutely crucial to ensuring that we are prepared for the challenges and threats of modern era.” #royalnavy #nato #steadfastdefender24\n\nUS Carrier and Amphibious Strike Groups Exit the Red Sea Region : **By Alexey Lenkov on April 28, 2024** In a significant strategic maneuver, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower, an aircraft carrier, alongside the USS Gravely, a destroyer, have departed the Red Sea. This move redirected these formidable naval assets through the Suez Canal, positioning them in the Eastern Mediterranean. This relocation marks a pivotal shift, leaving the US Central Command area without an aircraft carrier strike group or an amphibious ready group since last October. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and the USS Gravely have had a substantial presence in the Red Sea, participating in Operation Prosperity Guardian. Throughout their stationing, they played critical roles in intercepting threats such as Houthi drones and anti-ship missiles. Their departure raises questions about the future security dynamics of the Red Sea, especially given recent regional tensions. This redeployment could potentially alter the balance of power and operational capabilities in the region. It also highlights the flexibility and reach of US naval forces, capable of projecting power across strategic global theaters. This move has not only tactical but also significant geopolitical implications, considering the strategic importance of both the Red Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nNATO is currently conducting two major naval activities – Dynamic Mongoose 24 in the North Atlantic and Neptune Strike 24-1, which involves four large-deck strike groups and spans both the Mediterranean Sea and Adriatic Sea as well as parts of the Baltic Sea. In the North Atlantic, NATO ships, submarines and aircraft are carrying out the Dynamic Mongoose exercise, which began on Monday and ends on May 10. “Exercise Dynamic Mongoose is an annual anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare exercise designed to prepare NATO maritime crews to respond and adapt to any type of threat from seabed to space,” reads a NATO release on the exercise. Neptune Strike 24-1 began on Friday and ends on 10 May, and involves Albania, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain, Turkey, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States. NATO classes the Neptune Strike series of drills, usually held twice a year, as “enhanced vigilance activity” intended to demonstrate NATO’s capabilities and strength and enhance Allied connectivity. “Ranging from the Central Mediterranean to the Black Sea region and all the way up to the Baltic Sea, STRIKFORNATO’s execution will blanket three Joint Operations Areas and assert NATO’s capability to protect every inch of Allied territory with the naval resources that are organic to the theatre,” stated the command’s release on the exercise. #nato #exercises #northatlantic #strikeroups #capabilities\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy has achieved a major milestone in integrating enhanced lethality strike capabilities into the surface combatant fleet as directed by Government. Hobart class destroyer, HMAS Sydney, has conducted a successful firing of the Naval Strike Missile (NSM), Navy’s replacement for the ageing Harpoon weapon system. The firing was conducted during Exercise RIMPAC 2024, being hosted by the United States Navy off Hawaii, during a simulated activity which tested the sinking of Ex-USS Tarawa LHA1. This is a major milestone towards achieving the objectives of the National Defence Strategy by enhancing Defence’s integrated, focused force, and a great example of Defence’s collaboration with industry and international partners. HMAS Sydney – built at Osborne in South Australia – is a guided missile destroyer that can provide air defence and maritime protection for accompanying ships, land forces and infrastructure in coastal areas. The Naval Strike Missile (NSM) is an anti-ship and land-attack missile developed by the Norwegian company Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace (KDA). The original Norwegian name was Nytt sjømålsmissil (literally “New sea target missile”). The English marketing name Naval Strike Missile was adopted later. The state-of-the-art design and use of composite materials are meant to give the missile sophisticated stealth capabilities. The missile will weigh slightly more than 400 kg (880 lb) and have a range of more than 185 km (115 mi; 100 nmi). NSM is designed for littoral waters (“brown water”) as well as for open sea (“green water and blue water”) scenarios. According to Kongsberg the NSM/JSM had been selected by Norway, Poland, Malaysia, Germany, the United States, Japan, Romania, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Netherlands, Romania and Spain. #military #defense #defence #militaryleak https://lnkd.in/gFecwUGN\n\nUK Set To Kick Off Industry Engagement For Commando Insertion Craft The UK Ministry of Defence is planning to brief industry in early June on its plans to acquire a next-generation Commando Insertion Craft (CIC) to replace the Royal Marines’ current Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel (LCVP) MK 5. Addressing the Defence Leaders Combined Naval Event (CNE) 2024 in Farnborough on 22 May, Captain Nick Unwin, Commando Force programme director, said a CIC industry day was scheduled to take place on 4 June to outline the plan for programme delivery, and provide new clarity on requirements. The Commando Force programme is designed to transform UK amphibious forces into a more agile and lethal capability optimised for persistent forward deployment in a range of combat and non-combat roles. Key to this is a recapitalisation programme intended to bring new equipment and shipping into service in support of littoral strike operations. As part of this investment plan, the CIC programme is intended to deliver a new high-speed, low-signature craft that can deliver Royal Marine Commando teams and their equipment from ships positioned some distance offshore. The MoD’s procurement pipeline document last year indicated a requirement for around 20 CIC craft, with a budget of just over £190 million earmarked to cover design, manufacture, and support. Top-level CIC requirements previously promulgated by the MoD call for a medium-lift craft that can carry a strike team and a small vehicle to the shore from a stand-off range (circa 150 nautical miles) at high speed (25+ knots) with a low probability of detection. One major design consideration is the ability to transport marines in an environment where they land on shore ‘fit to fight’. #shipbuilding #ISeaSMEs National Shipbuilding Office #defence Royal Navy #smes https://lnkd.in/edu3yfPn\n\nWhat is a carrier strike group defined? A carrier strike group (CSG) is a type of carrier battle group of the United States Navy.[1] It is an operational formation composed of roughly 7,500 personnel, usually an aircraft carrier, at least one cruiser, a destroyer squadron of at least two destroyers or frigates,[2] and a carrier air wing of 65 to 70 aircraft. A carrier strike group also, on occasion, includes submarines, attached logistics ships and a supply ship. The carrier strike group commander operationally reports to the commander of the numbered fleet, who is operationally responsible for the area of waters in which the carrier strike group is operating. Strike groups comprise a principal element of U.S. power projection capability;[3][4] a single supercarrier holds enough firepower to rival the air forces of entire nations. Previously referred to as carrier battle groups (a term still used by other nations), they are often referred to by the carrier they are associated with (e.g., Enterprise Strike Group). As of March 2023 there are 11 carrier strike groups in the U.S. Navy.[5] The carrier strike group is a flexible naval force that can operate in confined waters or in the open ocean, during day and night, in all weather conditions. The principal role of the carrier and its air wing within the carrier strike group is to provide the primary offensive firepower, while the other ships provide defense and support. These roles are not exclusive, however. Other ships in the strike group sometimes undertake offensive operations (launching cruise missiles, for instance) and the carrier's air wing contributes to the strike group's defense (through combat air patrols and airborne anti-submarine efforts). Thus, from a command and control perspective, carrier strike groups are combat organized by mission rather than by platform. #navy #military #israel #war #government #veterans #army"
