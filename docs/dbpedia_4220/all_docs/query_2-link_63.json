        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, has sparked the most serious crisis in Europe since World War II and shattered the post-Cold War international order. It underscored that deterrence failed in the European theater, and the US-led alliance in Europe is now facing unprecedented concurrent threats from Russian imperialism and China’s rise.\n\nHowever, out of crisis comes opportunity. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has unified the transatlantic alliance and its partners — the transatlantic community is stronger than ever, and NATO’s core mission is, and remains, collective defense in Europe. The war has revolutionized NATO’s military strategy, moving the organization to a more capable war-fighting alliance and toward deterrence by denial. It has also shifted the balance of power in Europe to the east, ushering in the beginning of a strategic realignment.\n\nA simple truth has emerged since February 2022: the future of the transatlantic alliance rests on the future of Ukraine. The equation is simple. Europe is not secure if Ukraine is not secure, and the United States is not secure if Europe is not secure. Failure in Ukraine is not an option for the United States and its allies. As the United States and Ukraine’s allies and partners contemplate options for Ukraine’s long-term security, however, the bottom line is that the only lasting security guarantee for Ukraine and Europe is Ukraine’s membership in NATO. It will strengthen the alliance, improve deterrence, and boost capabilities.\n\nThis yearlong study lays out a comprehensive vision and blueprint for Europe’s security architecture anchored in eight core strategic tenets and dozens of specific and concrete recommendations.\n\nEight core strategic tenets:\n\nUkraine’s long-term security is the lynchpin of transatlantic security.\n\nEurope’s security architecture will not be complete without the integration of so-called gray zones in Europe.\n\nThe power balance in Europe has shifted east, which will require modernization of NATO’s defense posture, including a permanent presence on the eastern flank.\n\nNATO’s commitment to deterrence by denial requires a sustained and coordinated defense industrial revolution among its members.\n\nFailure in Ukraine will signal the end of US global leadership with profound and disastrous implications for US deterrence of China: the best way to deter China is by defeating Russia in Ukraine.\n\nRussia’s strategic posture of aggression is unlikely to change in the near or long term: postwar Russian leadership would not rule out military confrontation with NATO.\n\nNATO’s core mission must be to deter Russia in Europe.\n\nCountries of the so-called Global South will play a key role in determining the future of geostrategic competition: the United States and its allies must form a strategic and targeted approach to key partners in the region.\n\nSpecific Recommendations:\n\nOn securing Ukraine and the world order:\n\nUkraine’s promise of NATO membership must be honored speedily and effectively.\n\nIn the interim period prior to Ukraine’s NATO accession, the United States must institutionalize its security assistance to Ukraine, safeguarding aid from changing and uncertain domestic political dynamics.\n\nThe United States, NATO, and the European Union (EU) should launch a coordinated diplomatic and soft-power offensive in the Global South, identifying the sources of Russian and Chinese popularity and leverage, and seeing how its members can compete in countering them.\n\nWinning hearts and minds in the Global South through the best overall offering in terms of partnership and prosperity will require greater engagement, investment, and imagination by the United States, Europe, and other key Western allies and partners than has yet been shown, and a vision of the West which fully includes key leaders in the 21st century, such as India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia.\n\nThe United States and its allies should concentrate on improving and promoting democratic governance within the West, increasing support to partners, and collectively meeting universal challenges such as accelerating climate change, food insecurity, public health, and managing migration.\n\nOn strengthening NATO and European security:\n\n“Strategic autonomy” is dead: Russia’s war in Ukraine has underscored Europe’s humbling dependence on the United States for defense and security. In its place, Europe must continue to shift toward “strategic responsibility,” marked by a close but more equal partnership with the United States, prioritization of defense spending and capabilities, and playing to the EU’s nonmilitary strengths.\n\nNATO and the EU need better coordination, not necessarily increased cooperation. They are sometimes stronger when they “stick to their own swim lanes.” The EU should play to its nonmilitary strengths, including by enabling capabilities, financial support, energy system integration, and economic sanctions.\n\nFor NATO, the full implementation of the Deterrence and Defense Concept is paramount. This involves executable regional plans, domain plans, and the Area-of-Responsibility-wide plan, with a full assessment of gaps, and a clear strategy to fill those gaps.\n\nA combat-credible Allied Response Force, rapidly deployable and employable with the right enablers and capabilities, organized, trained, equipped, and sustained to deter and defend in the 21st century security environment is critical.\n\nTo provide for deterrence by denial, NATO must strike a balance between a permanent presence that provides a constant deterrence value and persistent, rotational forces that provide for readiness and lethality.\n\nA modern Integrated Air and Missile Defense capacity and capability with networked sensors to counter modern threat systems at all altitudes and in multi-domain operations is critical.\n\nInvest in a strengthened, robust indicators and warnings system. Additional resources should be specifically allocated to develop indicators and warnings capabilities in the NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre, the NATO Command Structure, and in national agencies.\n\nNATO allies should work to better align their visions and policies to emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs). NATO should also build an interoperable digital backbone, the true “glue” of 21st century deterrence.\n\nNATO member nations should prioritize investments and technology collaboration in EDTs to bridge defense innovation gaps.\n\nOn safeguarding alliance cohesion:\n\nBetter internal messaging across the alliance would address a major concern for the future cohesion of NATO.\n\nMember states should ramp up efforts to convince domestic populations of the need to invest in security. European countries are not evenly affected by the economic impact of this new threat environment, which may lead to increased frictions in the coming years.\n\nBoosting domestic support for efforts to adapt to this new threat environment may help mitigate the unpredictability of the elections taking place in 2024 in European countries and in the United States and increase domestic resilience.\n\nOn addressing Russia and China:\n\nThe United States and its allies should undertake a strategic assessment of the challenge presented by the relationship between Russia and China, of its possible trajectories, and of the scope for joint and separate policy approaches to them.\n\nTo address the “two-front” issue between Moscow and Beijing, NATO must clearly outline its role and presence in the Indo-Pacific region as well as deepen relations with the EU.\n\nResponses to Sino-Russian gambits should be concrete and issue-specific, commensurate with the level of threat. Countering Russian and Chinese malign influence will involve better defense (resilience) and offense.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, sparked the most serious crisis in Europe since World War II and shattered the post-Cold War international order. It has highlighted the price of Western complacency, with the losses being paid by Ukrainians directly in blood and tears, and by others indirectly through hunger and poverty. The hard truth is that deterrence failed in the European theater. That raises questions about its efficacy everywhere.\n\nIn repairing the damage, decision-makers face difficult choices. The United States is grappling with the costs of constraining China, while more effort, money, and risk appetite is needed in Europe, a continent where most allies have yet to grasp the cost of security. Despite transatlantic unity over Ukraine, European allies have different priorities on China. They also have increasing concerns over the dependability of the United States.\n\nThe United States and its allies were slow to see the looming systemic threats from Russian imperialism and China’s economic and military rise. The global financial crisis, handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq's distracted decision-makers. Their failures, real and perceived, also did great, mostly overlooked, damage to Western prestige and influence. Most countries of the “Global South” have remained broadly indifferent to Western concerns over Ukraine, reflecting deep-seated and long-standing alienation over political snubs, economic injustices, and other grievances.\n\nThe nature of the threats has changed too. The United States and its allies face increasing dangers from information influence operations, cyberattacks, political influence operations, weaponized finance, and economic coercion. These vectors of attack are not wholly new, but globalization and digital communications have removed friction and created new vulnerabilities. The era of Western technological dominance is over. Competitors, notably China, are gaining a strategic edge.\n\nFollowing the publication in 2022 of the NATO Strategic Concept and NATO’s 2023 Vilnius Summit, this report articulates the key short- and long-term challenges for the transatlantic alliance, and their prioritization in a five-to-ten-year time frame; it provides a cohesive strategic framework that elaborates core guiding principles and a vision for the future of European security; and it gives concrete recommendations that the United States, the European Union (EU), and NATO should implement in the short and medium term to achieve the long-term strategic vision.\n\nThis report centers on three aspects of the problem.\n\nEuropean security. The war in Ukraine has undermined fundamental assumptions about the post-Cold War European security architecture. How should the United States, the EU, and NATO strengthen their deterrence and forestall future threats?\n\nAlliance cohesion. How can the alliance mitigate disagreements on burden sharing, on the defense role of the EU, and on the scope of NATO’s mission? Russia’s immediate threat to European security competes with the longer-term challenge of China’s rise. How should the alliance balance these priorities, deterring, rather than cementing, a full-scale alliance between Moscow and Beijing?\n\nThe shape of the international order. How do these new priorities affect other regions, where security imperatives and economic self-interest may collide? What are the implications of these changing dynamics for the international order?\n\nNone of this will be easy. For three decades most decision-makers in most Western countries worked from the flawed assumption that Russia and China were converging with the West on basic questions of world order. Countries would work together on common challenges while old geopolitical rivalries would matter much less. This was most clearly represented through Germany’s “Wandel durch Handel” [change through trade] approach but was also the approach of successive US administrations. Far from wanting to fit into a US-led international order, Russian and Chinese leaders feared that it would first constrain and eventually pose an existential threat to their regimes. Western countries failed to realize the depth of this disagreement.\n\nThe 2017 US National Security Strategy (NSS) belatedly shifted the strategic focus away from global terrorism, after 16 years of the “global war on terror,” to geostrategic competition. But US policy lacked the geo-economic heft to deal with supply-chain dependence and China’s technological rise. But even the limited emphasis on China — at least in many eyes — deprioritized European security, providing a tempting opportunity for the Kremlin.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has changed this, but not necessarily permanently. Outrage at Russia’s aggression initially strengthened transatlantic cohesion. But this initial cohesion risks fraying in countries where voters and elites believe the war has become too costly or futile. Hopes that sanctions and military setbacks would force speedy political change in Moscow have proved fruitless. Other challenges, from decarbonization to migration, are crowding the political agenda. A return to “business as usual” with China and Russia would please many interested parties in countries across the West.\n\nYet out of crisis comes opportunity. Just as the destruction of World War II paved the way for reconciliation and integration, at least in the countries of Western Europe, the shock of the Russian invasion of Ukraine offers the possibility of revitalizing the Western vision and changing the post-Cold War pattern of complacency, greed, and appeasement. Success or failure in this will define not only European but US and global security for decades. At worst, defeat in Ukraine could mark the “end of the West.” At best, renewed geopolitical credibility and legitimacy of its values, norms, and institutions, extending from the “old West” to the countries of the “Global South” would mark the end of what the historian Anne Applebaum has called the “Twilight of Democracy.”\n\nNATO is both a solution and a problem here. Prior to 2022, doubts were growing about the US commitment to European security in light of its “pivot to Asia”. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the world’s biggest and most successful alliance rediscovered, and united around, its core purpose of collective defense. It is back — albeit at arm’s length — in the warfighting business, while adding new emphasis to resilience, crisis management, and cooperative security tasks. NATO’s unrivaled breadth, heft, and expertise offers European allies a framework to help the United States with its priorities in other theaters, and to build ties to allies there.\n\nBut the war has also highlighted NATO’s fragility: the US response has been so crucial that it lays bare Europe’s disproportionate dependence on US security. The questions in European minds about the sustainability of that commitment and long-term US military support to Ukraine are urgent and unanswered. For many countries of the Global South, NATO is tainted by the failed US-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and by the injustices and perceived slights experienced at Western hands over many decades.\n\nThis report is the culmination of a yearlong research effort from October 2022 to October 2023. The authors include experts and thought leaders in US and European security policy and former senior officials in the United States and European governments and NATO.\n\nThe project draws upon a variety of sources, including:\n\nAn in-depth literature review drawing on more than 200 sources from governments and multilateral organizations, policy journals, think tank reports, academic papers, and analytical articles.\n\nForty-one virtual and in-person interviews in Washington between December 2022 and June 2023 with senior government officials, politicians, former military officers, analysts, and experts from the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia, and India.\n\nConsultations with more than 70 senior government officials from the ministries of foreign affairs and defense, embassies, NATO, the EU, and leading experts from academia and the think tank community in Warsaw, Bucharest, Brussels, and London — cities where we expected the most significant policy divergences within the transatlantic alliance — over the course of a two-week research delegation in March 2023.\n\nThree virtual sessions of a cross-sector Transatlantic Working Group, which brought together more than 60 high-level experts with a mastery of defense policy, political and diplomatic analysis, and/or grand strategy, including current and former government officials, military officers, and prominent thought leaders from think tanks and academia from the United States, Europe, the EU, NATO, Asia, Australia, and India in January, March, and June 2023. The sessions focused on 1) addressing two fronts: Russia and China, 2) understanding internal threats to the transatlantic alliance, and 3) stress testing the authors’ proposed recommendations and strategic framework for this report.\n\nAs a result of the in-depth literature review, expert consultations, and cross-sector convenings, the findings in this report take a holistic look at the problems facing the transatlantic alliance and provide a comprehensive set of recommendations for policymakers. The study aims to inform and guide policymakers with rigorous, substantive, policy-relevant research at a time when governments and multilateral organizations are rethinking national strategies in this new security environment.\n\nThe report starts by addressing the immediate threat to European security posed by Russia’s war in Ukraine. It outlines the origin and nature of Russian aggression and the wider danger that it poses to European security and US transatlantic and global leadership. It highlights the need to provide lasting security for Ukraine and for other countries, including an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO at the alliance’s 75th anniversary summit in Washington next year. It outlines the steps that NATO has taken, and has yet to take, to rebuild its defense and deterrence. It outlines the failure to win support for Ukraine among countries of the “Global South.” It notes the death of European dreams of “strategic autonomy” and the resulting prospect of a productive relationship between the EU and NATO.\n\nIt then considers the seeming dilemma facing the United States: to deal with the challenge of a rising China or to counter Russian imperialism. This is also a potentially grave threat to alliance cohesion. The report argues that the dilemma is false. Abandoning Ukraine would destroy US prestige in Europe, and globally. It discounts the danger of a full-scale Russia-China alliance and argues that each threat should be considered, and countered, separately.\n\nIt then makes practical recommendations on all these fronts, on improving defense and deterrence in the nuclear, conventional, and subthreshold arenas; on strengthening alliance cohesion; and for building support for Western goals in the rest of the world. Put bluntly, to win the east-west conflicts, the world’s democracies need to fix their north-south problems. All these steps require practical and rhetorical commitments, and will come at a political and economic cost to some countries. However, seen through a national-security lens, this price is worth paying.\n\nChapter One: Ukraine, Russia, and NATO\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine will shape US and allied thinking about defense, deterrence, and alliance cohesion for a generation.\n\nThe Kremlin’s aggression in Ukraine underscored the failure of the US-led alliance over many years to understand the nature of the threat from Russia and the failure of deterrence to forestall the aggression, or to stop it when it started.\n\nPostwar Russia could reconstitute its capabilities within three to five years, while European allies need at least a decade to build their own defenses, which leaves a significant gap in NATO’s defense and deterrence.\n\nThe West should expect that the postwar Russian leadership would consider military confrontation with NATO.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has brought to the fore that agreements with Russia, notably the NATO-Russia Founding Act (NRFA), are now null and void.\n\nThe war has highlighted the widespread indifference to Ukraine’s plight and Russia’s aggression in most countries in the so-called Global South.\n\nFirst and foremost, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was a failure of deterrence. Although NATO allies were not treaty-bound to protect Ukraine, they invested in its capabilities, training, institutions, and armed forces, particularly since Russia’s initial invasion in 2014. They warned Russia against a full-blown attack, threatening sanctions and other penalties. This did not work. The result is the greatest catastrophe in Europe since 1945, with hundreds of thousands of people maimed and killed, millions of refugees, colossal environmental damage, a bill of many hundreds of billions of dollars for reconstruction, global food shortages, and the continuing danger of escalation.\n\nThat sobering failure now overshadows European security, while the war’s outcome will determine its future. Any result that leaves Russia capable of further aggression only postpones the next war. The result will also either strengthen or erode alliance cohesion, shaping the continent’s defense, deterrence, and resilience for decades to come.\n\nIn the short to medium term, both throughout the war and in the postwar period, the alliance must, therefore, ensure that Ukraine wins both the war and the peace. The sooner Ukraine wins, the less the risk of divisions in the alliance. Regardless of the timeline for allied consensus on its NATO membership aspirations, Ukraine must be given credible security guarantees. It will require assistance in institution building, defense capacity, and defense industrial base investment to promote interoperability.\n\nFor now, the alliance largely agrees on the conduct of the war and the desired outcomes:\n\na military and political victory that leaves the Kremlin incapable of launching another attack\n\na full restoration of Ukrainian territorial integrity\n\nsecurity guarantees, followed by speedy accession to NATO and then the EU\n\nThese could result from a Russian military collapse, or from a war of attrition that paves the way for negotiations with Russia from a position of Ukrainian strength. But at a minimum, the West must ensure that Russia does not “win” and that Ukraine does not “lose.” In practical terms, this means an outcome in which Ukraine is fully sovereign (able to join the EU and NATO), economically sustainable (with access to its ports), and militarily defensible (with a combination of Russian military withdrawal and Western security guarantees).\n\nHowever, the war already comes at a serious diplomatic cost. A signal feature has been the lackluster interest shown by countries of the Global South, including some of the world’s largest democracies — Brazil, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and South Africa. In many of these countries, the costs of the war, especially its effect on food supplies, are perceived sharply, whereas its outbreak is attributed to Western geopolitical adventurism that provoked Russia.\n\nFor example, in all but one of the 14 countries surveyed in a special Arab News-YouGov poll on where Arabs stand on the war in Ukraine, a majority of respondents who expressed a view believed the blame for the war lies with NATO. The only exception to this was in Syria, where blame was apportioned equally.\n\nThis was an unpleasant surprise for Ukrainians, who assumed that their struggle against a former imperial overlord would resonate in countries that had themselves experienced European colonialism. Ukraine’s ambassador to South Africa received a public rebuke after urging her host government to be “on the right side of history”in a video that would have passed without comment in much of the world. South Africa’s international relations and cooperation minister, Naledi Pandor, tweeted“Ambassador, you know this is wrong and undiplomatic,” adding that South Africa would not take sides in the conflict.\n\nUnderlying this disdain for Ukraine is the perception of Western double standards. An African delegate, speaking in an unattributable setting, summarized views of the conflict among many in the Global South with this mocking version of stereotypical Western attitudes to conflicts in Africa: “It’s just one lot of Europeans killing another lot of Europeans. They’ve been doing it for centuries and will continue to do so for decades. It’s just not our business.”\n\nDecision-makers in the Global South also contrast the uproar over Russian human rights abuses with the seemingly low-key criticism of abuses in countries that matter more to Western commercial interests. Attitudes toward NATO countries and the West in general are characterized, rightly or wrongly, by disappointment, skepticism, or outright hostility.\n\nThese arise from, but are not limited to:\n\nthe legacy of former colonial powers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America\n\nfailed wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the fallout from the “Global War on Terror\n\nthe inadequate response to climate change, especially in fulfilling climate financing commitments under the Paris Agreement\n\nthe weak response to the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of vaccine distribution\n\nlack of urgency and generosity on debt relief as well as “rich country protectionism”\n\nunderrepresentation of the Global South in international organizations, notably the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\n\nthe belief that the “rules-based international order” is a Western construct to which even its supporters sometimes only pay lip service\n\nThese criticisms, and the accompanying depth of feeling, can easily be overlooked in the backslapping and insular atmosphere of alliance decision-making. The positive side to this criticism is that it is based on disappointment rather than the belief that there is a better alternative out there. Countries of the Global South do not reject the UN Charter. They just object to the West’s à la carte view of it, and amnesiac response to past breaches.\n\nDissatisfaction with the West creates fertile ground for Russian and Chinese information operations. These propaganda efforts do not need to explicitly promote the virtues, real or otherwise, of the political systems run from Moscow and Beijing. Both Russia and China are explicitly engineering the information space to show that the West and its values are declining: they highlight Western failure and hypocrisy, especially on human rights violations, and link them to local grievances. In this, Russia and China are playing a longer game in the Global South than the West often does.\n\nThe West is in competition with Russia and China in a large part (in population terms the majority) of a world that is, if not anti-Western, increasingly de-Westernized. Countries that explicitly reject Western models of liberal economics, the rule of law, and competitive multiparty democracy include Saudi Arabia, Iran, authoritarian African countries such as the Central African Republic (CAR), and — at least in terms of some public rhetoric — Turkey. These countries align easily with Russian or Chinese interests.\n\nDiplomatic engagement allows the Kremlin to rebut the narrative that the war in Ukraine has left Russia friendless and isolated. But these alignments do not create durable alliances. Russia can count on help in sanctions-busting from countries like Venezuela, and enjoys lucrative commercial ties with regimes that it props up in places such as the CAR. It receives useful military drones from Iran — but on a strictly commercial basis. No African, Asian, or Latin American country with political ties to Russia has provided military assistance on the scale that Western allies have provided to Ukraine. Chinese influence is similarly transactional.\n\nYet the advances that China is making in the Global South risk distraction for US decision-makers when it comes to European security. China’s attempts to position itself as a European security actor may lack substance or engagement from a Ukrainian (and Western) point of view. But it is seen differently in countries suffering from the economic fallout of the war.\n\nThis is, of course, an incomplete picture. The majority of NATO members did not have overseas empires. NATO and the United States are not identical. EU priorities, particularly in development, differ strongly. Counterarguments can be made against some of the criticisms mentioned above, and they must be made.\n\nA further potential diplomatic cost is related to cohesion within the alliance. An attritional war could stoke doubts about Ukraine’s ability to withstand costs that Russia bears unflinchingly. This could divide NATO allies between those of the eastern flank who would regard the de facto partitioning of Ukraine as unacceptable, and those who would argue that the best way to deal with an unwinnable war is to end it. Similarly, some allies could find a decisive Ukraine victory uncomfortable, particularly if it is depicted as “backing Russia into a corner.” Russian threats of further escalation, including the use of nuclear weapons, play on these divisions. A related worry is that Ukraine wins the war but loses the peace. Reconstruction will be a mammoth burden on multilateral and national financial resources. Private sector involvement will be vital, but largely contingent on security guarantees. NATO’s Vilnius Summit in July 2023 failed to settle this issue.\n\nUkraine’s NATO membership (along with Georgia’s) was agreed in principle at the 2008 Bucharest Summit, and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg affirmed last April that “Ukraine’s future is in NATO.” Ukraine gained a promise at the Vilnius Summit that it will be NATO’s next, 33rd, member. But the decision on when that will happen has, in effect, been postponed to the alliance’s 75th anniversary summit in 2024 in Washington. The alliance instead introduced an upgraded partnership format via a NATO-Ukraine Council in which all members can directly engage and consult with Ukraine on “security issues of mutual concern.” The effort is meant to bring Ukraine “politically closer” to the alliance.\n\nUkraine’s future security and prosperity, and NATO’s credibility, depend on doing better than this.\n\nIt is true that NATO has never admitted a country that is at war. But if that becomes the paramount principle, then the Kremlin has an almost complete veto on Ukraine’s membership. Barring a complete Russian collapse and surrender, the Kremlin need only maintain low-level fighting to give hesitant allies an excuse to say that the war is continuing, and thus that Ukraine cannot join. NATO has extended membership to countries with contested borders (West Germany). Russian occupation of parts of Ukrainian territory run by puppet administrations could be compared to the Soviet military presence in the “German Democratic Republic” — a state that the Federal Republic never fully recognized. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, more popularly known as the Washington Treaty, is drafted with considerable wiggle room. It does not mandate NATO to respond with force to an armed attack on any member. It merely obliges each member state to react with “such action as it deems necessary.”\n\nFor now, Ukrainians and their friends believe that military success on the battlefield will bring a humbled Russia to the negotiating table. But three distinguished retired alliance officials have argued that NATO should use the prospect of membership to end the war and guarantee Ukraine’s security through deterrence.\n\nAssuming military exhaustion on both sides, this could take the form of a cease-fire, after which, pending Ukrainian admission to NATO at the Washington Summit in 2024, the main allies (the United States, the UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland) would then issue interim bilateral security guarantees of the kind offered to Finland and Sweden. These would extend only to territories controlled and administered by the Kyiv authorities, which would have to pledge not to retake Russian-occupied regions of the country by force.\n\nAny such deal would involve painful compromises for all sides. Russia would have to accept further expansion of the alliance — something which it now depicts as a huge Western infringement of its fundamental security interests. Ukraine would have to accept that it would seek recovery of its territory still occupied by Russia through diplomatic and political, rather than military, means. Western countries would have to accept that they are directly and irrevocably involved in protecting Ukrainian security. Their faith in deterrence would have to outweigh their fear of escalation.\n\nThis approach, or some version of it, might solve Ukraine’s Russia problem in the short term. More importantly, it would merely add to, rather than solve, NATO’s long-term Russia problem.\n\nThe Russia Problem\n\nAs already argued, Russia’s war in Ukraine results from 30-plus years of failure by Western decision-makers to grasp Russia’s aims and capabilities. Warnings from Russia’s neighborhood were abundant but ignored. Estonia’s then president Lennart Meri presciently explained the dangers of the “Karaganov doctrine” — that Russia has the right and duty to intervene on behalf of its “compatriots” in ex-Soviet territories. This is the wellspring of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s delegitimization of Ukraine’s identity and statehood. Meri also lamented the West’s naïveté and cynicism.\n\nInstances of Russia’s transgressive behavior before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 included:\n\nsupport for Serbian aggression in the former Yugoslavia\n\ncoercive use of gas and oil exports in countries dependent on Soviet-era pipelines\n\nthe wars in Chechnya (1994-6 and 1999-2009)\n\nelection meddling in Ukraine in 2004\n\nthe cyberattack on Estonia in 2007\n\nthe war in Georgia in 2008\n\nillegal annexation of Crimea in 2014\n\neight years of war in Donbas since 2014\n\nnumerous instances of subthreshold sabotage, assassination, subversion, and influence operations in NATO and non-NATO countries\n\nThe significance of these events, and warnings about them, were dismissed for reasons that remain deserving of scrutiny. They include a Russo-centric worldview, which ignored other countries in the region and prioritized the Kremlin’s concerns and talking points. Russia’s land mass and nuclear stockpile — in both cases the largest in the world — as well as its cultural clout rightly give it prominence. But such assessments should be coupled with recognition of Russia’s economic weakness and declining demographics, and the interests of other countries.\n\nThe combination of Russo-centrism and ignorance was the basis for arrogance and wishful thinking in the years following 1991. A further and perhaps decisive element was greed. Trade and investment with Russia were lucrative. Those who warned about the trajectory toward repression at home and aggression abroad, and the interaction between these two tendencies, were bad for business. This was particularly marked in Germany (because of the political weight of the Russia-dependent energy industries) and in the United Kingdom (financial services).\n\nFurthermore, those signals that the West did send to Russia, both verbal and practical, were muddled and lacked credibility. The Kremlin’s messaging was also ignored or misinterpreted. At every stage, Western decision-makers failed to learn lessons from experience and sought to return to “business as usual with the Kremlin”. Moscow exploited this Western weakness to its advantage.\n\nThe era of complacency is now over. The most important result of Russia’s war in Ukraine is a change in awareness. There can be no return to business as usual with Russia in the short or medium term, even when Putin is no longer in the Kremlin. But the change in Western thinking is not yet permanent. Divisions are visible within and between countries over the war. In particular, a realistic and comprehensive assessment of the threat Russia poses to NATO is still lacking. The biggest question is the timeframe in which Russia can regenerate its military power once fighting stops in Ukraine. At this point it can pose a renewed threat to Ukraine, to other neighboring countries (such as in the Caucasus or Central Asia), or to the countries of the Baltic Sea region.\n\nRussia’s Capabilities\n\nThe war in Ukraine has tested Russian military capability and operational art. After severe initial setbacks, Russia succeeded in building substantial defensive fortifications protecting its occupied territories. However, the verdict is mostly negative. So far, Russia has failed to establish air superiority. It failed to build an accurate intelligence picture of its adversary. Its command and control (C2) structures are divided and ineffective, graphically highlighted by the mutiny and subsequent demise of Yevgeny Prigozhin, former head of the Wagner Group private military company (PMC). Ukraine has learned faster and fared better. Russia’s performance has been impressive chiefly in the ability of ill-led, ill-supplied, ill-equipped, and ill-trained soldiers to withstand hardship.\n\nHowever, the current conflict is a sandbox. It involves Russia’s air force or navy only to a small extent; it takes place in limited geographical confines. It does not provide immediate lessons about how Russia would conduct military (and subthreshold) operations against NATO countries which are peer competitors, or technologically more advanced ones. More work is needed to establish common threat perceptions across the alliance and build a commensurate strategy and plan.\n\nThe authors’ discussions with intelligence analysts confirm the most pessimistic estimates in the think tank community. Answers to the reconstitution question range from “never” (if Russia sustains a catastrophic military defeat and descends into political chaos) to an alarming three to five years depending on the platforms and capabilities in question. This period would involve force reconstitution (in particular of Russia’s land forces) as well as reequipment, procurement, and overall recapitalization. Clearly, Russia has expended colossal stocks in Ukraine and suffered huge damage to its human resources. But intelligence estimates struggle to assess the effects of sanctions on the Russian military supply chain. Russia has built a war economy while NATO countries are still searching for a commercial model that corresponds to the new military necessity.\n\nThe debate about how fast Russia can rebuild its force and recapitalize its military equipment is ongoing. Whether it can reequip in a mere three to five years or up to a decade, Russia remains a threat to NATO interests. Western analysis will require more detailed and unified assessments of precisely in which domains and with what capabilities the Russian armed forces can still contest Western military superiority — whether in the conventional realm or asymmetric capabilities.\n\nThe political will to rebuild Russia’s forces appears undiminished, just as high-value capabilities — nuclear forces, integrated air defense systems, asymmetric capabilities — remain almost untouched. These, and especially long-range missile systems, are what Kremlin decision-makers would use in a conflict with NATO. In this context the key comparator is that few believe that the alliance’s European members will regain full-scale territorial defense capability, after decades of neglect, within the next 10 years.\n\nThe particular concern is Russia’s ability to threaten the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Despite the enlargement of NATO to include Finland and Sweden, the geographical position of the Baltic states creates unusually difficult problems for defense and deterrence. Longstanding shortcomings on the escalation ladder, difficulties in reinforcement, and inadequate stockpiles will not be remedied quickly. NATO must also manage the risk of potential spillover to other theaters, including the North Atlantic, Arctic, and North Pacific.\n\nGiven the restoration of capability, the next question is whether Russia has the risk appetite for a military or other confrontation with NATO. The stand-out aspects of the threat accentuated by the war are:\n\nconventional escalation (horizontal and vertical)\n\nnuclear/strategic threats\n\nsub-conventional tools/cross-domain coercion\n\nAnswers begin with an analysis of Russia’s motives. These are not mutually exclusive and can be self-reinforcing. They include:\n\na neo-imperial, post-colonial outlook, which treats neighboring countries as the “near abroad,” a predetermined sphere of influence\n\nfears, real or feigned, of a NATO military buildup on Russia’s borders\n\nan attempt to recast European security in a way more favorable to Russian interests\n\nthe desire to weaken NATO and US credibility in Europe\n\nPutin’s personal “legacy moment” as the leader who restored Russia’s great-power status\n\nan identity project for Russia, shaping the country’s self-image as a bastion of socially conservative, Orthodox Christian values, necessarily militarized in response to Western pressure\n\nDefeat or stalemate in Ukraine will not necessarily diminish any of these patriotic imperatives.\n\nFurthermore, Western frameworks of analysis may offer little help in predicting Russian behavior. NATO has greatly improved its indicators and warnings efforts focused on Russia since 2014. UK and US intelligence in particular were fully cognizant of the impending offensive against Ukraine in February 2022. Yet allies and partners were in many cases skeptical about the nature of the threat and the Kremlin’s intentions. Russian behavior often appears irrational and counterproductive from a Western mindset. For example, Swedish and Finnish NATO membership are a severe strategic setback for Russia. So are rising defense spending, the consolidation of transatlantic ties, and the end of a decades-long Kremlin effort to sell natural gas to Europe. Seen through a Kremlin lens, none of these issues matter against the factors outlined above.\n\nSome believe that the war in Ukraine has nonetheless diminished the wider threat. At the time of this study’s publication, the Kremlin has not overtly attacked supply lines through Poland and other countries. That suggests that NATO’s deterrence, at least in a narrow sense, is credible (although Poland has arrested Russian saboteurs who were allegedly tasked with blowing up railway lines carrying military shipments to Ukraine). At any rate, Russia is now arguably weaker than it was in February 2022. It failed to fulfill its prime aims of a speedy victory and regime change in Ukraine, dealing a heavy blow to Putin’s reputation for good decision-making. It incurred other diplomatic, economic, military, and political damage.\n\nBut a weaker Russia is dangerous too. Either under the current regime, or post-Putin, the Kremlin may prove to have a higher, “roll-the-dice” risk appetite. Particularly if the Kremlin senses weakness in NATO, the temptation to avenge defeat in Ukraine (or, less likely, consolidate a partial victory) will be strong. From the Kremlin’s point of view, the pluses of confrontation may outweigh the minuses. The Russian leadership finds a hostile external environment a useful backdrop to its domestic policies. An ongoing national security emergency allows the Kremlin to depict and prosecute critics as self-indulgent or outright treasonous, and to operate a lucrative war economy in which property rights and other legal protections are brushed aside. It would be rash, therefore, to believe that a postwar Russian leadership would rule out military confrontation with NATO.\n\nThis assessment is controversial. Yet it is sobering to note how wide of the mark complacent alliance predictions and assessments of Russian capabilities have been in previous years and decades. Expectations of Russian prowess and Ukrainian defeat proved equally misplaced. NATO needs a bottom-up reassessment of the Russian threat based on a deep understanding of Russia’s strategic culture and operational doctrine, and the likely trajectory postwar (and perhaps post-Putin). Views differ sharply, for example, about the likelihood and implications of a period of disorder (smuta in Russian) in a post-Putin era. Countries neighboring Russia regard these eras as broadly beneficial, with the advantages of Russian weakness outweighing the risk. “Russia is already a failed state: we shouldn’t worry about it becoming one,” a Polish interlocutor told the authors. Countries farther West prioritize stability, to the point that they might be willing to offer a new leadership in Moscow concessions in the hope of forestalling full-blown disintegration, outright dictatorship, or the capture of Russia into China’s orbit.\n\nThe main point is that NATO cannot remove these threats, it can only learn to mitigate and minimize them. Regardless of whether Russia is a “declining power,” the Kremlin remains for the foreseeable future a nuclear, conventional, and sub-conventional threat to NATO. Furthermore, existing agreements with Russia, notably the NATO-Russia Founding Act, are now null and void. They can no longer be used as an argument for reconsidering posture, resources, and alliance objectives toward the Kremlin.\n\nNATO must “get Russia right.”. How far the alliance has succeeded in that is the subject of the following chapter.\n\nChapter Two: NATO’s Response\n\nDeterrence by denial, deterrence by resilience, deterrence by direct and collective cost imposition, deterrence in the information operations domain, and tailored deterrence vis-à-vis the full range of potential threats will be critical if NATO countries are to have an edge over their competitors and enemies.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine exemplifies the importance of innovation and adaptation in developing, integrating, and using new technologies in warfare, including commercial and dual-use systems.\n\nAs a result of climate change, Russia’s remilitarization of the Arctic, and the accession of Finland and soon Sweden into NATO, the Arctic region’s impact on European security will continue to grow.\n\nThe varying prioritization between the Baltic and Black Sea regions was an asymmetrical eastern flank deterrence effort by the alliance. Russia may have perceived this as an opportunity.\n\nThe security of the Black Sea will depend heavily on the outcome of the war in Ukraine, and the alliance needs to have a proper strategy toward the region. This must include enforcing freedom of access and trade in the Black Sea, including the Sea of Azov.\n\nAs NATO adapts to the changing security environment and strengthens its defense and deterrence, it must avoid “self-deterrence.” This will require the alliance to abandon the idea that provoking the Kremlin spells disaster.\n\nFollowing Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and invasion of the Donbas in 2014, NATO at its Wales Summit in 2014 adopted the Readiness Action Plan. Adaptation measures for long-term changes to NATO force and command structure included an enhanced NATO Response Force (NRF), a new Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) under the NRF umbrella encompassing around 5,000 troops with some of its elements to be ready for deployment within 48 hours. In addition, the allies pledged to strengthen national cyber defenses, recognizing cyberspace as a new operational domain.\n\nAdditionally, allies added six multinational NATO C2 centers to facilitate the rapid deployment of the VJTF and allied follow-on forces units. At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, the allies committed to enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) with four multinational battle groups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Multinational and combat-ready in nature, these battle groups were at the time the biggest reinforcement of NATO’s collective defense in a generation and led to a significant reinvigoration of NATO’s deterrence posture. The alliance also developed a tailored Forward Presence (tFP) in Bulgaria and Romania.\n\nNone of this was enough. Four months into Russia’s full-scale invasion, NATO heads of state and government therefore endorsed a new Strategic Concept, the first since 2010, during the alliance’s summit in Madrid in June 2022. The 2022 Strategic Concept reinvigorates the strength and unity of NATO and refocuses the alliance on defense and deterrence, reaffirming its founding purpose by returning to the pre-2010 tradition of presenting the core pillar of collective defense as the key responsibility.\n\nThe right mix of both the tactical-technical (training of forces) and political-strategic (political messaging, deterrence, and defense planning) approaches is crucial for NATO to reinforce deterrence. Russia poses a military threat that cannot be defended against with the current NATO eFP in Poland and the Baltic countries. This is essentially a tripwire approach to indicate to Russia that, were it to invade alliance territory, it would be at war with NATO, and thus deter Russian land grabs. The concept behind a tripwire approach is no longer appropriate. The war in Ukraine makes clear the very high costs involved in regaining lost territory. Allies pledged to “defend every inch” of NATO territory with a shift in NATO’s military posture. No ally wants to experience the destruction and loss involved in a war of liberation on its territory.\n\nRussia’s full-scale war in Ukraine has thus revolutionized NATO military strategy, moving the organization to a more capable, war-fighting alliance. This approach calls for more troops based permanently along the Russian border; more integration of US, NATO, and other national war plans; more military spending; and more specific requirements for allies, including types of forces and equipment to fight (including pre-assigned plans).\n\nConventional deterrence measures agreed to in Vilnius included:\n\nThree new regional plans to defend NATO allies on all flanks, along with new C2 arrangements.\n\nThe eight eFP battle groups (which includes the four battle groups agreed to at the 2016 Warsaw Summit) “are now in place” and the ambition to scale up to brigade-sized units “where and when required” remains. Before the summit, Canada offered to double its contingent in Latvia, adding 1,200 troops, while Germany confirmed it would send a permanent brigade of up to 4,000 troops to Lithuania in the future.\n\nEnhancements were made to NATO’s Integrated Air and Missile Defence (IAMD) posture, including rotating modern air defense systems across the eastern flank and increasing readiness. To further strengthen air exercises and activity, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania also signed a Declaration of Cooperation on cross-border airspace management.\n\nThis marks a far stronger focus by NATO on conventional military forces at the strategic level. The alliance is strengthening its forward defense with an increase in forward-deployed combat forces. Some of the existing multinational battle groups will shift toward brigade-size units, but only “where and when required.” Those brigades are to be supported by credible rapidly available reinforcements, pre-positioned equipment, and enhanced C2. The commitment also envisages the United States increasing its forces on the eastern flank, which includes a brigade combat team in Romania and additional rotational deployments to the Baltics.\n\nSecond, the Vilnius Summit set in motion a transformation of the NRF. This includes an increase in NATO high-readiness forces from 40,000 to 300,000, an adjustment based on a new NATO Force Model (NFM). This force model consists of two tiers of high-readiness forces — 100,000 forces at 10 days or less readiness to deploy (as opposed to the previous model of 40,000 at 15 days), and a further 200,000 forces at 30 days or less. Progress on the NFM appears slow — the chair of the NATO Military Committee, Adm. Rob Bauer, cautiously admitted before the Vilnius Summit that NATO is “working towards those numbers” — and no detail is available yet on the new reaction force.\n\nFor the first time since the Cold War, NATO is planning for “forces pre-assigned to defend specific allies.” These forces will train and exercise in the countries where they are pre-assigned to be deployed in times of crisis. This will allow them to learn how to operate together with the home forces stationed in the respective member country. In the long term, allies will enhance their contingency planning and interoperability and strengthen their ability to defend and protect all allies, including those in the eastern part of the alliance.\n\nThird, allies agreed to pre-position military equipment, stockpiles of military supplies, and facilities in frontline countries and to complement this with forward-deployed capabilities, including air defense units, strengthened C2, and preassigned forces. In addition to the reinforcement boost, a new set of plans —regional, domain, and across the Supreme Allied Commander Europe’s (SACEUR’s) Area of Responsibility (AOR) — are in final development. The goal is executable plans with the appropriate forces assigned to deter and defend the depth and breadth of NATO territory.\n\nMeasures to deter nonmilitary hybrid threats included new resilience objectives; a new Maritime Centre for the Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure; a new cyber defense concept and Virtual Cyber Incident Support Capability; a NATO Space Centre of Excellence in France; and a commitment to protect energy infrastructure and secure energy supplies to military forces. NATO also opened a new Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and Security in Montreal, Canada.\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has had ripple effects across the whole of the SACEUR’s AOR.\n\nNordic-Baltic\n\nFinland and soon to be Sweden’s NATO membership is not simply a political victory, but a change to the entire framework of northeastern European security. The five Nordic-Baltic allies in Northern Europe (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden, and Finland), along with the regional defense heavyweight Poland, share broadly similar perceptions of the Russian threat. Finland and Sweden joining the alliance will allow for integrated control of the region and enhance the defense of the Baltic states. It will bring valuable new capabilities, including additional advanced aircraft and submarines. It also shapes responsibility, burden sharing, and decision-making power on future developments (enhancement of forward presence, development, and implementation of regional plans, etc.).\n\nBelarus is isolated from the European security architecture. But its role as a regional threat is increasing. Though Belarus has so far refrained from using its own forces in Russia’s war in Ukraine, Russia used its neighbor as an invasion platform, and is now starting to station nuclear weapons there. The Wagner Group mercenaries involved in the failed coup in Russia have also been reported as redeploying there.\n\nThe Arctic and the High North\n\nAs a result of climate change, Russia’s remilitarization of the Arctic, and the accession of Finland and soon Sweden into NATO, the Arctic region’s impact on European security will continue to grow. The only non-NATO Arctic country is Russia, which describes itself as an “Arctic civilization” and “hyperboreal” country. Russia continues to expand its Arctic presence. Over the past decade, Russia has increased its military presence, reopened long-closed military installations, and modernized its facilities. In 2021, the Northern Fleet was reorganized and upgraded to become Russia’s fifth military district, and in August 2022, Russia announced a new naval doctrine emphasizing the importance of the Arctic.\n\nThe future of Arctic governance remains constrained by the exclusion of Russia from the Arctic Council in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine as well as by the absence of a dedicated forum to discuss military security issues.\n\nThe Black Sea\n\nThe Black Sea is where everything is tested: freedom of navigation, hybrid threats, and attacks on democracy. At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, NATO prioritized the Baltic Sea region by deploying eFP battle groups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland while applying tFP measures for Romania and Bulgaria. The tFP included a more ad hoc approach to improving mission command, regional air policing, and exercises. This sought to strengthen coastal radar systems, establish new land force headquarters, and expand US capabilities at Romania’s Mihail Kogălniceanu air base, but the tFP was not a coherent approach.\n\nThe varying prioritization between the Baltic and Black Sea regions was an asymmetrical eastern flank deterrence effort by the alliance. Russia may have perceived this as an opportunity. One aim of Russia’s war in Ukraine is to maximize its access to and control of the Black Sea, in which Crimea is key. (Moscow’s original goal in 2022 was to take over all of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast and create a land bridge to the Russian-occupied separatist Transnistria, a territory in Moldova). Russia still constrains Ukrainian access to the Black Sea.\n\nAs Russia takes time to reconstitute its forces, NATO has the opportunity to increase its presence in the Black Sea and in the Caucasus/Central Asia region. The security of the Black Sea will depend heavily on the outcome of the war in Ukraine, and the alliance needs to have a proper strategy toward the region. This must include enforcing freedom of access and trade in the Black Sea, including the Sea of Azov.\n\nThe Mediterranean\n\nRussia has become an important player in the Eastern Mediterranean over the past 20 years, setting up a military presence in North Africa and Syria, including naval facilities and access points across the region. This presence impacts the threat perception of the southern flank of NATO. At the same time, the war in Ukraine has led the alliance to shift its primary focus to the eastern flank.\n\nDespite this, Russia continues to maintain a significant presence and influence in the Mediterranean. This is evident not least in North Africa where Russian PMCs continue to play a notable role. NATO will need to monitor looming threats on the southern flank. This should encompass improving its deterrent capabilities, including intelligence sharing, domain awareness, freedom of navigation exercises, among others. NATO also needs to maintain awareness of, and wherever possible contest and counter, Russian presence and influence in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe Best of the Rest\n\nAt NATO’s Madrid Summit in 2022, allies agreed that NATO enlargement has been a success and that the security of aspirant countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine) is closely interconnected with allied security. NATO membership is cheaper than other security guarantees. Allies agreed to maintain an interest-driven, flexible, and focused approach to this core task in order to address shared threats and challenges, and to adapt to changing geopolitical realities. NATO will struggle to promote its interests and influence in the Central Asian region, where it has at times been considered more of a problem than a solution.\n\nCritical commitments, tailored to the respective partners’ needs and aspirations, include:\n\nstrengthening political dialogue and cooperation with aspirants, assisting them with enhancing their resilience against malign interference\n\nbuilding capable and resilient institutions\n\nincreasing practical support to ensure that partners are able to defend and secure their borders\n\nestablishing economic security that enhances their ability to invest in emerging technologies and strengthen the defense industrial base\n\nThe war in Ukraine has made clear for the first time that this is about defense, rather than just European integration. “We must find a path for securing our vulnerable partners.” This pillar also envisages the alliance increasing cooperation and dialogue with countries in its broader neighborhood and across the globe, remaining open to engagement with any country or organization, when doing so could bolster mutual security.\n\nDuring the post-Cold War era, NATO’s main focus was on non-Article 5 crisis management (i.e., allies’ military engagements in the Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, the Sahel, and Syria) with collective defense and deterrence taking a back seat. The 2022 Strategic Concept sought to rebalance the three core tasks, placing defense and deterrence front and center in adapting the alliance to a new era of competition. Crisis management and prevention remain critical for the southern flank, in particular. The threats of terrorism, organized crime, proliferation of small weapons, and migration will continue to destabilize and threaten security in the region. In addition, Russia’s war in Ukraine not only threatens Eastern Europe and the Black Sea, but is having spillover effects in the Mediterranean region, including on energy prices and food security.\n\nThe alliance should, therefore, maintain its investments in crisis response, preparedness, and management through regular exercises and leveraging its ability to coordinate, conduct, sustain, and support multinational crisis response operations. The EU will continue to have an important role in civilian and small-scale military crisis response operations and is an important partner for NATO. The relationship between NATO and the EU, and need for greater alliance cohesion that it exemplifies, is considered in detail later in this report.\n\nEven if they are belated, all these measures are commendable. The question is how they match the gap outlined above between Russia’s ability to reconstitute its military in as little as three to five years and the decade or more that European allies will need to rebuild their defenses. Combined with perceived uncertainties over the US commitment to Europe, this gap offers a strategic opportunity for a ruthless and decisive Russian leadership in the years leading to 2035. Recommendations on how to deter the Kremlin from exploiting such an opportunity are listed in chapter five.\n\nAll forms of deterrence require credibility, capability, and communication. These are evidently lacking. The fact that Russia attacked Ukraine rather than (say) Latvia is a tribute to the deterrent power of Article 5 of the Washington Treaty and the US nuclear guarantee to Europe. Yet even this success is partial. Russia conducts extensive subthreshold operations in NATO countries, including lethal sabotage, assassinations, and election interference and subversion. The combination of sanctions, protests, and expulsions that some of these attacks have prompted have clearly not deterred Kremlin decision-makers from mounting new ones.\n\nUnfortunately, after more than three decades of strategic neglect, the West is not ready for a serious discussion on deterrence, nuclear and otherwise. Since the 1990s, the security focus has been on discretionary crisis responses rather than a longer-term strategic approach to an existential threat. Compounding this, allies disinvested in defense and allowed forces, capabilities, and the underlying industrial base to erode. To contain Russia and counter China (and others), the alliance now needs a coherent, comprehensive medium- and long-term strategy.\n\nDeterrence by denial, deterrence by resilience, deterrence by direct and collective cost imposition, deterrence in the information operations domain, and tailored deterrence vis-à-vis the full range of potential threats will be critical if NATO countries are to have an edge over their competitors and enemies. NATO’s current deterrence posture can be viewed in three tiers: nuclear, conventional, and hybrid. In the conventional tier, Russia’s capabilities are changing. Because Russia’s conventional land forces are so devastated and its stockpiles of missiles depleted, Moscow may pivot to an increased reliance on nuclear and hybrid threats. Changes in the character of war, regionalization, and the division of labor have become increasingly relevant.\n\nHowever the top priority is conventional deterrence against Russia, investing in military capabilities able to contest, disrupt, and disable Russian asymmetric advantages — its long-range missile systems, integrated air defense systems, electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, offensive cyber capabilities, and space-based systems. Improving technological capabilities will be key.\n\nIncreased forward defense is also necessary, notably through a further strengthening of forward presence battle groups and air forces, improved IAMD, pre-positioning of equipment, full implementation of NATO’s new set of plans and the promised new NATO Force Model of 300,000 plus high-readiness forces, and a return to more forward-based forces in Europe, including in Germany.\n\nFinally, deterrence depends on better communication, internal and external. If effective defense and deterrence is the priority, then the primary goal should be influencing the adversary’s behavior. All of this must be accomplished while avoiding “self-deterrence.” The first step in implementing this approach is to abandon the idea that provoking the Kremlin spells disaster.\n\nAmong the key lines of effort for NATO are:\n\nestablishing a robust indicators and warnings program across all elements of national power and being able to deny that situational awareness to its adversaries\n\nbuilding the demonstrated military ability and political will to impose a range of unacceptable costs on an adversary, and infrastructure, pre-positioning, stockpiles, and an industrial base able to sustain the imposition of costs longer than an adversary\n\nensuring the ability to pose to an adversary a plethora of complex dilemmas across domains and geographies simultaneously (e.g., if Russia attacked allies in the northeast of the alliance, allies could also counterattack in the southeast, or in Asia).\n\nability to make political and military decisions at a faster rate than its adversaries\n\nA conventional military attack may be backed by threats of nuclear escalation. The lack of military-to-military communication channels and hotlines, compounded by a potential Russian shift to launch-on-warning, increases the risks of this. Nuclear weapons are rarely talked about in public in NATO countries. But they are frequently discussed in Russia, not least as it deploys nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Belarus. Particular Russian sensitivities include the collapse or destruction of its multilayered air defense network.\n\nNATO countries have no ability to promote democracy directly inside Russia. What they can do is protect their own societies against attack. Western countries should be prepared for the consequences of increased isolation of Russia: that it becomes a beleaguered, disruptive but nevertheless still significant presence on the international stage. The new focus must be primarily on containment.\n\nThe strategic patience of the Cold War should be the template here. If the Kremlin is for its own reasons determined to pursue a policy of confrontation, it is futile and dangerous to promote a different future for Russia. Far better to restrain the Kremlin’s decision-makers by limiting the quantity and quality of their options.\n\nNuclear posture needs a rethink.\n\nTalking Nukes\n\nThe arms control construct established over the past 60 years, a centerpiece of European security, has largely collapsed. “Nuclear and conventional agreements on arms control, disarmament, and risk reduction have been shattered by Russia.” And the prospects for arms control in the near term are bleak. The trilateral dynamic (the United States, Russia, and China) adds another layer of complexity to the challenge. Nuclear threats by major powers are back on the map in a way they have not been for decades. The world is arguably on the cusp of a new nuclear age where reaffirming, strengthening, and, where needed, rethinking the rules of the game and how to prevent nuclear use is critical.\n\nIn the years before robust arms control with the emergence of treaties, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, and other arms control apparatus including conventional arms control, the risk of arms miscalculation and nuclear competition and threats dictated nuclear powers to invest heavily in security. As the alliance mandates base-level defense spending at 2% and higher gross domestic product (GDP) for members, the United States and other nuclear powers were spending anywhere from 6% (the United States) to 17% (the Soviet Union) of their GDP on defense prior to the implementation of bilateral and multilateral agreements.\n\nBut even as the future of arms control structures is in doubt, the foundation of the alliance’s deterrent is unchanged: a powerful and ready nuclear force; a survivable nuclear command, control, and communications system; and a responsive nuclear weapons infrastructure. Nuclear deterrence is vital to addressing strategic threats and ensuring the alliance can confront unwanted behavior with confidence and at lower levels of violence.\n\nThe alliance and partnerships remain the greatest strength. NATO’s current nuclear posture is broadly adequate but could be strengthened with better nuclear burden-sharing agreements across the alliance. Unlike the conventional security and collective defense measures of the alliance, members are not required to participate in the nuclear-sharing group. Members can opt out of the nuclear mission of NATO, exposing the alliance to not speaking with one voice on all aspects of the NATO mission, resulting in fissures of alliance unity. This line of separation between pillars of alliance strength hinders the alliance’s ability to cohesively and collaboratively integrate plans, deterrence options, exercises, etc. The strength and steadfast commitment to deterring threats, in all domains and synchronized, must be the primary focus and foundation going forward. This integration of conventional and nuclear domains by the alliance will decrease risk, increase deterrence, and be an integral basis for any future attempts to negotiate and rebuild an arms control architecture by coming from a position of strength.\n\nRegardless of distaste for the Kremlin regime’s domestic and foreign policies, alliance countries should be willing to place renewed focus on strategic arms control. Strategic stability — avoiding nuclear war by accident or miscalculation — is more than ever critical.\n\nMeasures to improve NATO’s deterrence are outlined in this report’s recommendations section. These and other measures could deter a conventional or nuclear attack from Russia. But they will not necessarily prevent attacks below the threshold of armed force. These subthreshold threats have been the hallmark of the Kremlin’s policy toward NATO countries, and it is to this topic that the report now turns.\n\nAddressing Subthreshold Threats\n\nSubthreshold threats, sometimes confusingly named “hybrid warfare,” do not sit easily in NATO’s in-basket. As well as the much talked about “fake news” or information operations, they include:\n\neconomic coercion\n\nbuying political influence through bribery and donations\n\nlegal and physical intimidation of critics\n\nassassinations and sabotage\n\nelection interference\n\ncyberattacks, particularly the hacking and leaking of private communications\n\norganized criminal activity\n\nmigration, including weaponized migration\n\npublic health crises and associated disinformation\n\npolitical polarization\n\nexploitation of ethnic, linguistic, regional, and cultural divisions\n\nNATO countries have mostly failed to deter these attacks and have been slow to deal with them. Indeed, in many countries resilience to them has mostly been deteriorating. The COVID-19 pandemic, the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the effects of climate change, and other factors have increased internal economic, political, psychological, and social stresses. Fiscal constraints, including the need for higher defense spending, have squeezed other budgets, including those for long-term infrastructure, storage and stockpiles, and public spending.\n\nNational “resilience” is already implied in the requirement of the Washington Treaty’s Article 3 for member states to “maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.” However, this requires elaboration. The concept of resilience continues to be open to differing interpretations among allies. Adding resilience as a fourth core task would emphasize the need for allies to define and improve resilience.\n\nResilience should not be seen as static. An important aspect is future-proofing, with an emphasis on flexibility, agility, and innovation. It involves whole-of-government and whole-of-society participation, including messaging, training, exercises, and gaming. Enhanced partnerships with a broad range of organizations, including the EU, are key. Seen through the prism of resilience, national security is sustained by, and contributes to, social cohesion and the democratic process. NATO’s future mission, therefore, encompasses nontraditional challenges to environmental, technological, and economic security. Energy resilience, for example, is not solely a matter of reducing dependence on Russian hydrocarbons and Chinese critical minerals. It will also help cushion the transition to net zero.\n\nHardening critical national infrastructure (energy, finance, data and telecoms, transportation networks) is not just a business continuity issue to be dealt with by managers, regulators, and insurers. As part of NATO’s defense and deterrence mission, the alliance needs deep insights into vulnerabilities that may affect individual member states, and that have cross-border implications.\n\nIt is tempting, but mistaken, to leave the response to each of these threats to the national authorities in the countries concerned. This approach has two shortcomings. One is that the visible threats are not necessarily the important ones. The other is that the threats frequently transcend national borders. To cope with subthreshold threats, the alliance needs a cross-border, whole-of-government, and whole-of-society approach, cutting across all elements of power and all civilian and military efforts. Specific recommendations are outlined in chapter five of this report.\n\nThis more holistic approach is clear from the US approach of integrated deterrence, a concept that underscores the need for all methods of deterrence on a continuum. Articulated by the 2022 US NSS, this envisions a combination of capabilities to deter potential adversaries from engaging in hostile activities. Integrated deterrence includes integration across domains (conventional, nuclear, cyber, space, informational), across regions, and across a spectrum of conflicts. It also envisages integration across national tools and instruments and integration with allies and partners (interoperability, joint capability development, competitive posture planning, coordinated diplomatic and economic approaches). Alignment on integrated deterrence will help the United States and its allies effectively counter Russia and China and the threats NATO is to face in the upcoming decade (including from countries like Iran, North Korea, etc.).\n\nA Defense Industrial Revolution\n\nFollowing the Cold War, European allies allowed their defense industries to fragment and erode, anticipating that there would be no major war on the European continent for the foreseeable future. To move toward a model of deterrence by preparedness versus deterrence by reputation now means increasing and enhancing defense capabilities, and investing in research and development for new ones. As one senior Romanian official stated, “the new world order will belong to those who master knowledge and new technology.”\n\nAfter years of neglect, European governments now broadly recognize the need for a robust defense industrial base, responsive and adequate production capacities, and resilient and secure supply chains. French President Emmanuel Macron has spoken of the need for a “wartime economy.” Allies will need to bridge the differences between their respective governments and the defense industry, and invest in capital, training, innovation, and financing. The Defense Production Action Plan agreed to at the Vilnius Summit has potential to enhance unity and foster a sustainable defense industrial capacity across the Alliance. The war in Ukraine has also shed light on Europe’s overreliance on imports of critical raw materials, which the EU began addressing by formalizing a proposal for a European Chips Act, reducing European dependence on foreign supplies.\n\nDespite the consensus within the alliance for increased defense spending to backfill stockpiles, increase capabilities, and modernize, the size and timeframe of the increased budgets is contested. The quality of spending matters too. European allies spend too much on salaries and civil servants, too little on advanced weaponry. This places great strain on interoperability.\n\nOther shortcomings abound. Production capacity and stockpiles are inadequate. Replenishing equipment that allies provided to Ukraine will take months, and in many cases years. For example, France, which sent 18 Caesar howitzers to Ukraine in the summer of 2022, will need an estimated 18 months to replenish those stocks. This competes with the priority of acquiring new and emerging defense technologies.\n\nEmerging and Disruptive Technologies\n\nIn a new era of warfare, building a competitive technological edge comes with investing in knowledge and new technology. On this score, developing and investing in NATO’s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) and the NATO Innovation Fund (launched in June 2022) “is essential as they will help us access innovation at a pace of the private sector.” It will protect innovation ecosystems, set standards, and commit to principles of responsible use. The aim is to provide deep tech, dual-use innovators with funding and a fast track to adapt their technological solutions to defense and security needs. DIANA will allow NATO to develop its technological edge in priority areas, including big-data processing, artificial intelligence (AI), autonomy, quantum, biotechnologies and human enhancement, energy and propulsion, novel materials and advanced manufacturing, hypersonics, and space. To complement this, the NATO Innovation Fund is set to invest €1 billion in early-stage start-ups and other venture capital funds developing dual-use emerging technologies of priority to NATO. Specific recommendations are outlined in chapter five of this report.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine exemplifies the importance of innovation and adaptation in developing, integrating, and using new technologies in warfare, including commercial and dual-use systems.\n\nUncrewed aerial systems (UAS) — or drones — of all kinds have become an indispensable capability for both Ukraine and Russia, performing a vast array of tasks and missions. Their high vulnerability and demand also confirm the need to establish resilient supply chains and scale up industrial production capacity across the alliance to meet future demand. This is where closer and innovative forms of collaboration between the private sector, including civilian tech companies, academia, civil society, and the broader defense environment, can provide a decisive advantage.\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, the ubiquitous and constant observation provided by UAS has significantly improved tactical situational awareness and created a “transparent battlefield,” complicating the use of maneuver tactics and limiting the ability to achieve and exploit surprise. The integration of drones and precision fires into friendly-use digital targeting applications has dramatically compressed the kill chain to a few minutes and significantly increased the threat for troops from the frontline to the deep rear. These developments offer important lessons for NATO and its members in terms of capability requirements, countermeasures, force structure, and doctrine.\n\nAt the same time, the incorporation at scale of AI is reshaping the way intelligence data are collected, processed, and exploited, expanding drones’ capabilities and making them resistant to EW, and laying the ground for the deployment of autonomous drone swarms in the near future, among many other effects. Ukraine, for example, has successfully integrated AI in its digitalized C2 architecture and targeting process, while Russia has installed AI-powered autonomous functions in its effective Lancet loitering munitions. Moscow is internalizing the lessons emerging from Ukraine and — along with other NATO competitors such as China — will likely channel more and more resources toward the development of emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs).\n\nThe war in Ukraine has also highlighted the critical role played by EW. Since the early 2010s, Russia has invested significantly in its EW capabilities, which Moscow considers a pivotal, if invisible, component of its deterrence posture vis-à-vis NATO. Indeed, EW allows Russian forces to challenge the alliance by disrupting or denying the use of its technologically superior capabilities, from long-range precision-guided munitions to airborne intelligence radars and satellite communications. Russia’s emphasis on EW already emerged during the eight years of its war in the Donbas, and is now extensively applied to its military operations across eastern and southern regions of Ukraine. As sensors, drones, space, and a broader process of digitalization reshape warfare and military capabilities, the electromagnetic spectrum will be a domain of major contestation in any conflict against a peer or near-peer adversary. Therefore, NATO and single allies should take stock of the lessons emerging from Ukraine and prepare their EW capabilities accordingly.\n\nThe defense industrial revolution will also benefit from a renewed emphasis by NATO on economic warfare. However, it and other vital elements in conventional and subthreshold defense and deterrence cannot be achieved without the enthusiastic cooperation of the EU. It is to the NATO-EU relationship, and the challenges and opportunities it presents for alliance cohesion, that this report now turns.\n\nChapter Three: Alliance Cohesion\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine has underscored Europe’s humbling dependence on the United States, ending dreams of “strategic autonomy.”\n\nIn its place, Europe must pursue “strategic responsibility,” marked by a close but more equal partnership with the United States, prioritization of defense spending and capabilities, and playing to the EU’s nonmilitary strengths.\n\nThe geopolitical heart of the European continent has moved to the east and the north, giving more influence to Central and Eastern European, Nordic, and Baltic partners — the “Crescent Coalition” — making the UK’s role in European security even more paramount.\n\nNATO and the EU need better coordination, not necessarily increased cooperation. They are sometimes stronger when they “stick to their own swim lanes.”\n\nMaintaining a shared perception of the long-term threat Russia poses to European security is vital, particularly for those in Western Europe. If Russia is not defeated in Ukraine, another European war will be imminent.\n\nEuropean dreams of “strategic autonomy” or “emancipation” from US leadership have been at the core of the EU’s much-touted Common Security and Defence Policy since the 1990s. They also have been one of the most serious obstacles to the alliance’s cohesion, the subject of this chapter. Now history has given its verdict.\n\nThe hard truth is that, despite belated increases in defense spending, Europe’s economic clout is not matched by military weight. European allies, particularly post-Brexit, could not have prevented a Ukrainian defeat without the help of the United States. The nascent European military headquarters, battle groups, and the acronym soup of other bureaucratic initiatives have been revealed as empty posturing. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has, therefore, cemented US leadership, the preeminence of NATO, and the death (at least in military terms) of European strategic autonomy. It heralds a productive and balanced division of labor between the United States and its European allies, and between the EU and NATO as institutions.\n\nEuropean allies combined are bigger in population and economic terms than the United States. Yet it is US taxpayers who continue to shoulder the biggest burden in Europe’s defense. A further threat to cohesion is interoperability. The gap between the US military — the most advanced in the world — and the obsolete and underfunded armed forces of its allies is unsustainable. And lastly, differing perceptions about the threat Russia poses to the European continent, both now and in the future, risk fracturing alliance cohesion.\n\nThis chapter starts by highlighting four big developments:\n\nNATO’s revitalization and renewed sense of purpose\n\nthe death of European strategic autonomy\n\na shifting center of power from Western Europe to the east and north — the so-called Crescent Coalition\n\nthe EU’s new role in security and its relations with NATO\n\nNATO Is Stronger and More Unified than Ever\n\nUkraine has awakened Europe to the threat posed by Russia, and, as a result, the most powerful military alliance on the planet is back — stronger and more unified than ever. Despite Russia’s expectations, member states finally realized that Russia presented a threat to the future European — and international — security order. Now, member states largely agree on the alliance’s main purpose of collective defense and how it should respond to the threat emanating from Russia.\n\nThis newfound unity stands in stark contrast to the alliance's uncertain direction and shrinking budgets in the years following the Cold War. Even the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia were considered by some member states as “out of area” issues. Not any more. NATO members no longer dispute the alliance’s relevance and US leadership. Although many Europeans feared an imminent US pivot away from Europe and toward Asia, the United States has demonstrated its commitment to European security. But the scale and sustainability of that commitment are still subject to uncertainty, and European concerns have not been fully assuaged.\n\nEuropean Strategic Autonomy Is Dead\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine not only cemented US leadership and NATO’s mission, it has confirmed that the concept of European strategic autonomy is “dead.” In 2022, it was put to the test, and it unequivocally failed, in an interview with the authors via Zoom, February 2023.)) as “strong US leadership was required to pull NATO together, keep it in line, and keep national agendas in check.” The United States, as the “only country capable of engaging in a large, long-term war,” in an interview with the authors via Zoom, February 2023.)) and thus the only country with the credibility to deter the Kremlin and other aggressors, has proven to be an indispensable leader in European security.\n\nEuropean mindsets have shifted fundamentally. Policymakers who previously focused on domestic economic and social priorities now back bigger defense budgets, with Germany, Poland, the Baltic states, and Romania promising particularly dramatic increases. Finland joined NATO and Sweden is on the cusp of doing so. Denmark ended its opt-out from the EU’s Common Security and Defence Policy. Even the Swiss and Irish are reconsidering their neutrality, leaving Austria, Cyprus, and Malta as the only remaining security laggards.\n\nThis enables a change from dreams of “strategic autonomy” toward practical “strategic responsibility.” Key features of this will be a close but more equal partnership with the United States, prioritized defense spending and capabilities, and playing to the EU’s nonmilitary strengths.\n\nThe Rise of the Crescent Coalition\n\nThe geopolitical heart of the European continent has moved to the east and the north because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, giving more influence to Central and Eastern European partners, as well as to the Baltic and Nordic states, which makes the UK even more paramount to European security. Europe has more at stake in the east now: states that were once outliers, viewed as overly emotional about the prospect of Russian aggression and longtime skeptics of European strategic autonomy, are now nearer the center of gravity. Conversely, the weight of France, Germany, and Italy, seen as foot draggers in the past, may be reduced. The United States will need to support and strengthen these “crescent” countries before they fully take the reins, by supporting capability development, supporting their candidates for leadership positions, and strengthening interoperability. Thanks to the legacy of decades of Soviet rule, these countries are poor relative to their population size; they generally have worse connectivity and infrastructure; they rely on support such as US Foreign Military Financing and other security assistance; and their defense spending choices in the past have sometimes been patchy.\n\nA New Security Role for the European Union\n\nThe war in Ukraine marks recognition of the EU as a significant and relevant security actor. This is not wholly new. Since 2008, the EU has played a major and largely successful role in bolstering European energy security, for example. The continent’s ability to withstand interruptions in Russian pipeline gas supplies stems directly from the improved storage and interconnection, and diversification of import routes, pioneered by European Energy Commissioners Andris Piebalgs (2004–10) and Günther Oettinger (2010–14), and by the antitrust proceedings brought against Gazprom from 2012 under European Competition Commissioners Joaquín Almunia and Margrethe Vestager. These efforts, often underappreciated in the United States (and the UK), can be seen as the core of the EU’s increasingly robust geopolitical outlook. This includes a newly hawkish stance toward China.\n\nThe war in Ukraine marked a change of gear. EU countries have announced around €200 billion in defense spending increases. The EU has provided substantial aid to Ukraine, amounting to €77 billion as of July 2023. This includes a previously little-known fund called the European Peace Facility that has provided €12 billion in direct military aid. More is planned. After years of European defense cuts, the European Commission is now seeking to address uncoordinated defense spending and prevent further duplication and fragmentation. The crisis also brought post-Brexit UK back into European discussions, with British ministers attending EU summits and also meetings of the European Political Community.\n\nEU-NATO Coordination and Cooperation\n\nFears that the EU sought to supplant NATO as the essential and sole provider of collective defense have in the past led the United States to try to prevent any security conversations from taking place outside the alliance. With those worries assuaged, the United States has begun to recognize the EU as a useful ally. In 2022, the Biden administration took part in the first EU-US Defense and Future Forum. The EU and NATO have identified clear avenues for complementarity and signed a declaration in January 2023 outlining expanded/deepened cooperation in several areas, including:\n\ngeostrategic competition\n\nresilience and the protection of critical infrastructure\n\nEDTs\n\nspace\n\nclimate change and its security implications\n\nforeign information manipulation and interference\n\nSignificant untapped potential for further coordination and synergy between the two organizations should be leveraged over the next several years.\n\nNATO provides to exposed eastern flank allies what the EU cannot: defense, deterrence across multiple domains, and security reassurances. The EU offers lethal equipment, but also help that NATO cannot provide: financial support, energy system integration, infrastructure, humanitarian assistance, and a future in a shared European political community. It is crucial in enabling, capabilities, and integrating neighboring partners (such as Ukraine) in the single market. The EU also has levers that NATO does not and should not have, such as economic sanctions.\n\nEU-NATO cooperation is critical when speaking of sub-conventional challenges, such as cyber and other hybrid threats where EU deterrence and resilience capabilities are particularly useful. NATO and the EU should synergize responsibilities here. Critical infrastructure is another key area of cooperation in which the EU’s financing could support NATO planning efforts. Examples of the success of this cooperation in action include the Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Fleet, based at Eindhoven and Cologne Air Bases. The fleet is owned and managed by NATO, but the initiative was led by the European Defence Agency more than 15 years ago.\n\nEU and NATO staff also maintain regular contact and information exchanges on cyber activities, including policy developments. Examples include the Solarwinds cyber operation in April 2021 and the Microsoft Exchange Server compromise in July 2021.\n\nSome concerns remain. First, neither NATO nor the EU has buy-in from all members on further cooperation or coordination. Countries that belong to one organization but not the other (non-NATO EU members Austria, Ireland, Malta, and Cyprus, and non-EU Türkiye) have sometimes strong reservations about intensified cooperation. The EU’s Joint Procurement Act may harm NATO’s ability to set demand signals for capabilities. Conflicting national and commercial interests have long hampered attempts to develop a unified defense industrial base.\n\nThe Future of EU-NATO Relations\n\nUnderstanding the future trajectory of EU-NATO relations is paramount to NATO’s future in Europe. Beyond European strategic autonomy and alliance cohesion, the EU-NATO relationship has all too often added up to less than the sum of its parts, despite ambitions to increase cooperation.\n\nThere is a good case to be made that the period since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine has been the high-water mark, if not a “honeymoon,” with NATO focusing on its core role of defending allies, and the EU focusing on making the best use of its economic instruments to sanction Russia and offer humanitarian, financial, and reconstruction assistance to Ukraine.\n\nYet the relationship becomes more complicated with regard to the EU’s limited security and defense role. The question of the respective roles and delineation of responsibilities of NATO and the EU has vexed both organizations for decades. There have been, and will in the future be, opportunities for NATO and the EU to cooperate in operational theaters both within Europe and beyond — for example, in Kosovo and Iraq currently, and in Afghanistan until the withdrawal of Western forces in the summer of 2021.\n\nBut cooperation on the ground was often less close than meets the eye, and often hampered by different mandates and command chains, different institutional imperatives, and competing ambitions. There has never been an agreed formula by which NATO and the EU, either separately or together, determine which might lead in which operational circumstances beyond the territory of NATO members, and on the division of labor in the event that both organizations choose to get involved in a particular crisis.\n\nThe situation is compounded by the fact that EU-NATO cooperation sometimes impedes progress or introduces complications, if only because their inner workings remain “hermetically sealed” to each other. Institution-building alone is not enough to address the challenges at hand, especially since the benefits of closer working relationships between the institutions has its limits. The logical assumption that a stronger relationship is an end or a “good” in itself has not yet been proven.\n\nNATO and the EU are sometimes stronger when they “stick to their own swim lanes.” The starting point to cohesion should, therefore, always be to ask “what are we trying to achieve?” The most effective way forward would seem mostly to be division of labor rather than duplication of efforts.\n\nIn this regard, policy for collective defense and larger-scale expeditionary and discretionary operations, defense spending, operational planning, force structures, readiness, capabilities, interoperability, and core military infrastructure should remain NATO leads. The EU should amplify and support the alliance using its nonmilitary toolkit.\n\nGiven this division of labor, NATO and the EU thus need better coordination, not necessarily increased cooperation. There are indeed areas where NATO and the EU can have a substantive, synergetic role. This is especially true for strengthening the resilience of critical infrastructures and supply chains — for instance, increased coordination in building resilient transnational critical infrastructure is a good step forward, as shown by the NATO-EU Task Force on the Resilience of Critical Infrastructure and the NATO-EU Structured Dialogue on Resilience.\n\nIn terms of defense procurement and capabilities, more European defense spending, improved European capabilities, more European high-readiness forces, improved infrastructure, larger stockpiles, and a much stronger European industrial base would all make critical contributions to transatlantic security.\n\nThe UK’s Role in Post-Brexit Europe\n\nA further question is therole of the UK. Post-Brexit attempts by the British government to distance the UK from the EU have halted, though the UK’s Indo-Pacific defense efforts have hampered its military commitment to Europe. Should the United States signal its approval, a future British government could decide to focus heavily on plugging gaps in European defense, perhaps in return for restoration of trade and investment ties harmed by Brexit.\n\nIn the short term, the key to success for the EU’s defense efforts will be a focus on practical cooperation on projects that also benefit military security. High on the priority list is military mobility: the creation of robust, dual-use transportation infrastructure that will enable rapid, large-scale reinforcement of Europe’s eastern flank. Securing even this modest goal will be hard, but also a springboard to more ambitious achievements.\n\nDefense Spending and Burden Sharing\n\nDisagreements about how to fairly share burdens and responsibilities in NATO date back to the founding of the alliance itself. The issue has been a political football, testing the cohesion of the alliance for the last several decades. In the United States, then presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump railed against member states for failing to pay their fair share, calling out “free riders,” a “complacent” Europe, and the “fortune” that NATO cost the United States.\n\nHowever, since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the vast majority of member states now agree that 2% of GDP should be the floor. Indeed, at the 2023 Vilnius Summit, allies agreed on \"an enduring commitment to invest at least 2%\" of their GDP into their militaries in the future. As of July 2023, about one third of member states are spending at least this amount, but In interviews with the authors in March 2023, several NATO and European officials expressed certainty that the majority of allies would meet the 2% threshold by the end of 2023. Moving beyond the 2% GDP benchmark, NATO is aligning contributions to specific capabilities. This is vital to meet the executable regional, domain, and AOR-wide defense plans discussed earlier in this report. Regionalization used to be frowned upon by NATO, because allies should be able and willing to deploy forces at scale beyond their own region"
