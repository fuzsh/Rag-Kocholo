        "text": "The Greek frigate Hydra is part of an EU naval group under the CDSP maritime security operation ASPIDES that aims to safeguard maritime security and ensure freedom of navigation, especially for merchant and commercial vessels, in the area where numerous Houthi attacks have targeted international commercial vessels since October 2023. Within its defensive mandate, the operation will provide maritime situational awareness, accompany vessels, and protect them against possible multi-domain attacks at sea.\n\nEUNAVFOR ASPIDES, a European counterpart to the American-led Operation Prosperity Guardian, was launched by the European Council on February 19, 2024 with an initial duration of one year. Operation ASPIDES will coordinate closely with the EUNAVFOR ATALANTA to contribute to maritime security in the West Indian Ocean and in the Red Sea, as well as, with like-minded partners contributing to maritime security in its area of operation.\n\nASPIDES is an operation with Greek leadership and a Greek name (“Aspides” in Greek means “Shields”). The Operation Commander is Rear Admiral Vasileios Gryparis based at the ΕU-OHQ in Larissa, Greece while the Force Commander is Rear Admiral Stefano Costantino on board the Italian Navy Andrea Doria (Orizzonte)-class AAW destroyer Caio Duilio (D-554). In the naval group is also the Sachsen-class AAW frigate Hessen (F-221) of the German Navy.\n\nGreek Defense Minister Nikolaos Dendias, in an address to the crew of the Hydra, comprised of some of the Navy’s finest personnel, underscored the significance of the operation before the ship’s departure for the Red Sea on Monday, February 24.\n\n“Greece, as a maritime power with a leading role in global shipping, attaches enormous importance to the need to ensure freedom of navigation, as well as the safety of Greek sailors. By participating in Operation ASPIDES, you are not only showcasing the Greek and European flags, but also serving the pure national interest”\n\nGreek defense minister Nikolaos Dendias\n\nUpgrades on ‘Hydra’ frigate\n\nMEKO 200HN frigates are heavily armed for their size as they are equipped with one Mk45 127mm gun, 8 x Harpoon SSM, 16 x ESSM Block 1 SAM, 2 x triple torpedo launchers for Mk46 torpedoes, 2 x Phalanx CIWS, one S70 helicopter and several machine guns. Based on the released photos, it’s evident that frigate Hydra has undergone multiple upgrades and enhancements to ensure its readiness for the operation. Such upgrades include a new R-ESM with ELINT functionality from SAAB, likely the SME-150 according to Ptisi (and by the fact that HN operates a similar sensor of the same manufacturer on some of its submarines), that has completely replaced the old AR-700, a rear RWS (we are confident that the system in question is the SHARK 12.7mm manufactured by General Robotics, a familiar asset within the Navy’s arsenal, known to be deployed on Agenor SOC) installed atop the hangar, a C-UAS system, CCTV and advanced communications and surveillance equipment including a UAS.\n\nThe above upgrades and additions attest to the great effort and attention given by the Greek government to the safety of the crew and the success of the operation. However, Hydra stands as the sole vessel in its class to have undergone these upgrades, a distinction driven by her crucial role in ASPIDES."
