        "text": "About a year ago, I suddenly got really interested in the opening months of the Pacific War–December 1941 to May 1942, approximately. In U.S. histories of the war, this era is usually skimmed over as “and then the Japanese conquered the Pacific”. The actual details of how they conquered the Pacific, however, are truly amazing. Over the course of five months, the Empire of Japan launched a dozen coordinated offenses across a theater of operations thousands of miles across, achieving victory nearly everywhere. I’m not sure if there’s any comparable operation in military history, either in terms of short-term success or utter pointlessness. Japanese tactical success merely cost them valuable and irreplaceable resources while doing nothing to damage U.S. war-making capability. We all know how that ended. Still, it got me thinking. This is the result of those thoughts.\n\nSpecifically, this is an attempt at a more-or-less plausible “best case” scenario for Japan. The point of divergence is Pearl Harbor. In my timeline, both of the U.S. Pacific Fleet’s aircraft carriers are present, and Admiral Nagumo’s decides to launch a third strike, crippling American naval operations in the Pacific, allowing the Imperial Navy to carry out it’s full strategy relatively unmolested and putting Japan in the best possible position for the war of attrition to come.\n\nBold Entries are events that occur differently from our timeline\n\nNovember 26th, 1941:\n\nJapanese Mobile Strike Force (Kidō Butai) departs from Hokkaido. Fleet includes all six fleet carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy, Kaga, Akagi, Sōryū, Hiryū, Shōkaku, and Zuikaku, along with twenty-seven auxiliaries and escorts.\n\nJapanese ambassador to the U.S is presented with Hull Note, an ultimatum demanding the full withdrawal of Japanese forces from China and Indochina.
