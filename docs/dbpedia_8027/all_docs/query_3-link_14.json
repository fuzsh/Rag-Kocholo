        "text": "The original theatrical release had Gy√∂rgy Ligeti's \"Atmospheres\" set to a black screen for roughly 8 to 10 minutes before the movie began, and Johann Strauss's \"The Blue Danube\" long after the end credits set to a black screen. This overture and exit music survived the premiere edits mentioned above. For a long while, revivals and all television and cable broadcasts would cut both, starting directly at the beginning of the credits and ending immediately after the end credits, but current revivals in such places as the Film Forum in New York City and cable channels such as the Sundance Channel, Bravo, the Independent Channel, and PBS have been restoring the pre- and post-movie music.\n\nThe DVD version from MGM omits a few seconds of dialogue from the scene in which Dave is attempting to re-enter the Discovery through the pod bay doors. Dave asks several times, \"Do you read me, HAL?\" In the original release, HAL answers, \"Affirmative, Dave. I read you.\" In the DVD version, HAL only answers \"Affirmative, Dave,\" although the English subtitles still contains \"I read you.\" The DVD release from Warner Bros. corrects this and HAL's full line of dialogue is heard."
