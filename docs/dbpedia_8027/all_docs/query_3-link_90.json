        "text": "Warner Bros has scanned the original 70mm film negatives of 2001: A Space Odyssey in 8K in order to produce the most “vivid” version of Stanley Kubrick’s epic yet.\n\nThe move came at the request of Japanese broadcaster NHK, which will show the new edition as the launch film for its new 8K television channel, which arrives on Saturday.\n\nThe 8K format has 16 times the resolution of HD TV, the picture having a width of 8000 pixels.\n\n“The many famous scenes become even more vivid, with the attention to detail of director Stanley Kubrick expressed in the exquisite images, creating the feeling of really being on a trip in space, allowing the film to be enjoyed for the first time at home,” NHK said in a statement.\n\nNHK will show Audrey Hepburn’s My Fair Lady in 8K next year, and has plans to do the same with the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nThe format is still something only the rich can enjoy, however. Samsung and LG both make 8K-capable TVs, but they cost in excess of £10,000."
