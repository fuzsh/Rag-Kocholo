        "text": "The film 2001 A Space Odyssey was directed by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C Clarke. Using the novel written by Arthur C Clarke as the basis for the cinematic masterpiece. The film is a long, boring, two-hour plus story with no clear meaning at the end but it is still hailed as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time. It is worth noticing that the film was produced in 1968 (and the years preceding) which is one year before humans reached the moon. This means that Kubrick would have had to work closely with NASA and experts on space and astronomy to be able to portray aspects of space such as the lunar surface as closely as possible. Since the film was published during the height of the space race, it sparked intrigue in as to what impact space travel and the technological advances it would bring to our lives. The film is spilt into a few defined sections: The Dawn of Man, The mission to the Moon, Intermission and a psychedelic travel through space and time.\n\nThe movie begins with two rival groups of apes competing with each other for control of a watering hole. Then one of the groups encounters a strange, perfectly rectangular, smooth object. The object emits a strange noise and it is clear that it was made by intelligent beings. After touching the strange object dubbed the monolith the apes appear to get smarter overnight prompting technological advance. This made them learn to use old bones as weapons giving them an advantage over their enemy tribe thus giving them control over the watering hole. I believe that the monolith is symbolic of god or a higher power because as soon as they came in contact with it they became smarter and were able to advance.\n\nI think that Kubric is trying to evoke thought as to whether humans would have been able to advance to the degree we have today if it wasn’t for the monolith. This idea is then accentuated when the film then cuts to a spaceship hundreds of millions of years later; this one cut from the spinning bone to the spaceship is significant because it infers all the years of technological advances in order to go from the bone being the most advanced technology to a spaceship.\n\nIt is later told that a group of scientists discover a monolith buried on the moon. A group of scientists are sent there to investigate the finding. The monolith once again is activated by touch. After a painful ordeal with high-pitched screeching from the monolith, the scientists including Dr Floyd discover that the monolith is sending a signal toward Jupiter. This part of the film was the setup of the plot but it may also symbolize man’s eternal curiosity. One can draw many similarities between the monolith and the tree of knowledge of good and evil (referenced in Genesis 2–3). They are both mysterious object that grant various powers and both are sought after by man due to curiosity.\n\nThe discovery that the monolith was sending a signal to Jupiter was inevitably followed by a mission to Jupiter. The mission was led by Frank, Dave and their HAL 9000 series computer. After this HAL determines that the humans are putting the mission at risk so it attempts to kill the conscious scientists by giving them incorrect information. This sparks conversation between Dave and Frank as to whether they should shut down HAL. They make sure HAL isn’t able to hear them but they did not think if HAL could lip read what they were saying as demonstrated in this scene.\n\nThe scene is silent and Kubrick shows HAL’s perspective. The audience can infer that Hal is lip reading even though it is not specifically told. The restricted vision (the circle of sight) further validates the fact that it is HAL’s perspective.\n\nAfter HAL kills the unconscious scientists and Frank, Dave manages to shutdown HAL and is transported to an alternate dimension where he travels through space and time and witnesses a fantastic array of colours. This scene shows colourful streaks flying past and is intended to leave the audience amazed and mind-boggled.\n\nBetween the long colourful adventure, Kubric shows flashes of Daves face getting twisted and looking grotesque. This symbolizes the shock and horror that this experience entails. It also serves as a reminder to the audience that it is Dave’s experience that we are watching. The lengths of these visuals are very short but they are long enough to be able to see the distorted face of Dave.\n\nOne of the final scenes display a ‘star baby’ on a bed. It is seen from the perspective of the monolith and I think the baby symbolises Dave transcending into an all-knowing god in the form of a baby.\n\nOverall, this movie is a cinematic masterpiece with amazing effects used and is deeply symbolic of the human race. Fifty years later, it is still discussed and referenced. It was and still is astronomical in its impact."
