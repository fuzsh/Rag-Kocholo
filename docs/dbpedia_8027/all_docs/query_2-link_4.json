        "text": "Since the 1950s, the idea of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) has captured the imagination of scientists and enthusiasts alike. Now, with the development of OpenAI's Q* project, we are at a turning point. Are we living the prequel to a reality that had only been imagined in works such as '2001: A Space Odyssey', '2001: A Space Odyssey', '2001: A Space Odyssey' and '2001: A Space Odyssey'?\n\nOpenAI's Q*: a prequel to '2001: A Space Odyssey'?\n\nThe depiction of HAL 9000 in Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's '2001: A Space Odyssey' gave us an early glimpse of what AGI might look like. Today, progress on the project Q* of OpenAI appear to be the first steps toward the realization of an artificial intelligence with human-like capabilities. This project could represent a preliminary stage toward the type of AGI that HAL 9000 embodied.\n\nTheoretical framework of AGI since 1950\n\nAspirations toward AGI began in the 1950s, with researchers such as Herbert A. Simon and Marvin Minsky, who believed in the possibility of machines capable of performing any human job within a few decades. Over the years, this theoretical framework has evolved from neural network models to formal systems for deliberative reasoning and mathematical definitions of adaptive general intelligence.\n\nCoincidences between Q* and the theoretical framework of AGI\n\nThe development of Q* in OpenAI reflects several aspects of these early visions. Although there is limited information available about Q*, its apparent ability to resolve mathematical problems at the school level with a novel approach suggests a move toward the adaptability and versatility characteristic of AGI. This focus on improving the reasoning abilities of AI models aligns with the original goals of AGI to replicate complex human cognition.\n\nQ* is a milestone\n\nThe Q* project marks a milestone in the history of artificial intelligence. Although we have not yet achieved full AGI, initiatives like Q* indicate that we are moving toward the realization of a vision that began more than half a century ago. We stand on the cusp of a new chapter in AI, one that could be remembered as the beginning of the true AGI era.\n\nThe global race for AGI and the ideologies driving it.\n\n1. The ideological struggle in the Race to the AGI:\n\nIn the current context, as in the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey', where an artificial intelligence is at the center of a human and technological drama, OpenAI finds itself in a significant internal struggle. On the one hand, effective altruists (EAs) adhere to the organization's original non-profit mission, while on the other hand, a group driven by the commercial potential of ChatGPT and other AI developments seeks to accelerate its growth and application. This division reflects an ideological war that extends beyond OpenAI, resonating in social networks, internet forums, and in the minds of founders, researchers, and policymakers shaping the future of AI.\n\n2. Security and Ethics in Artificial Intelligence:\n\nAI safety, a topic that has been of importance since the days of Isaac Asimov, has taken significant steps in the last ten years. With the rise of concerns about 'rogue' AI that could end civilization, figures such as Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky have advocated for strict regulations. In parallel, the growth of the Effective Altruism (EA) ideology has brought AI safety into focus, especially in relation to the destructive potential of AGI.\n\n3. Accelerationist Effect and Global Competition for IGA:\n\nMeanwhile, effective accelerationism (e/acc) represents an emerging philosophy that challenges security concerns in AI, focusing on accelerating technological growth and societal change. Proponents of e/acc, such as Guillaume Verdon, argue that AI should be developed in an open and accessible manner, without excessive security restrictions, believing that this would lead to emergent forms of consciousness and wider varieties of sentience. This approach clashes directly with the more cautious and regulated view of AI proposed by EAs and other proponents of AI security.\n\n4. Reflections on the Future of AI:\n\nLooking at these factions and their quasi-religious beliefs about AI and AGI, it makes for an uncertain future. No one knows how the next decade will unfold in relation to AI. This brings us to a crucial question: is it better to remain flexible and avoid dogma in a field as rapidly changing and potentially transformative as AI? History shows us that the balance between bold innovation and informed prudence has always been a fine line, especially in a field as powerful and rapidly advancing as artificial intelligence.\n\nAnalogies with the film:\n\nIn the race to AGI, we are seeing a reflection of the tensions and expectations that '2001: A Space Odyssey' raised decades ago. OpenAI's Q* could be just one step in this long odyssey, one that takes us through a maze of technological innovations, ethical dilemmas and global competition. The race to AGI is not just a race of technology; it is a race of ideas, values and visions for the future of humanity.\n\nRecent Developments in the Search for AGI\n\nOne of the most intriguing developments in the quest for AGI is OpenAI's recent Q* project. This project, unveiled after an internal controversy that led to the brief ouster of Sam Altman as CEO of OpenAI, has raised expectations of significant progress toward AGI. The concern expressed by OpenAI researchers about the potential threats of a \"powerful artificial intelligence system\" underscores the magnitude and ethical implications of this endeavor.\n\nDefining AGI has been a challenge in itself. Various experts have offered definitions, generally seeing it as artificial intelligence capable of performing a wide range of tasks, similar to the human brain. OpenAI describes AGI as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans in most economically valuable jobs.\" A team at DeepMind, in an effort to pin down these concepts, has proposed a framework for classifying the capabilities and behaviors of AGI models. Their goal is to establish a common language for measuring progress, comparing approaches, and assessing risks.\n\nIn their classification of AGI levels, the DeepMind team identified several levels, from \"Level 0, No AGI\" to \"Level 5, Superhuman\". Current models such as ChatGPT, Bard and Llama 2 have only reached \"Level 1, Emerging\". This indicates that, despite progress, we are still far from reaching full AGI. Programs such as Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant are at \"Level 2, Proficient\", while DeepMind's AlphaFold, at \"Level 5, Superhuman\", represents the most advanced on this spectrum.\n\nThese advances in defining and classifying AGI are crucial to understanding its trajectory and realistic expectations. As we move closer to achieving AGI, ethical challenges and safety considerations become increasingly important. In this race towards AGI, as in '2001: A Space Odyssey', we face not only a journey of technological discovery but also a journey of introspection and definition of our values and visions for the future.\n\nReferences:"
