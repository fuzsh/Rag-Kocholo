        "text": "As my tiny part of the world loses its mind over the impending solar eclipse this week, it seems like a great time to revisit a movie that forced us to think about the infinite cosmos. Watching Stanley Kubrick’s masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (Disc/Download) is a little like gazing at that suddenly-dark sky in the middle of the day—it makes you realize there’s a whole universe swirling around our tiny little planet, but most people never take the time to look up.\n\nBefore I get to the murderous computer, or the Eero Saarinen tables, I should mention this is a film that absolutely must be seen on the big screen at least once in your lifetime. However, home viewing does give you the option for a proper cocktail, so let’s not totally discount the small screen experience. With very little dialogue and very little plot, 2001 relies mostly on stunning visuals to convey the story of a mysterious monolith and its effect on those who encounter it. Told in four parts, the action really picks up when two astronauts head to Jupiter (and unknowingly, the monolith) with a computer that’s starting to go a little insane. When people talk about the dangers of A.I. now, a lot of it comes back to HAL. If a computer is designed to be smarter and more intuitive than the humans who control it, what’s to stop it from taking over? From the online chess match, to the tablet screens, to the seat back entertainment on the space shuttle, to the video calls, 2001 predicted a lot about how humans would one day interact with technology. Let’s just hope we don’t have more HALs coming out of the ChatGPT pipeline.\n\nBecause the film opens with an eclipse and features many beautiful shots of orbiting planets and moons, this is a great time to break out your spherical ice molds. I filled mine with fresh-squeezed orange juice, which really stands out against a dark beverage. Also, HAL’s creepy rendition of “Daisy Bell” makes me want something related to the Daisy family of cocktails. While watching 2001: A Space Odyssey, I recommend drinking this Monolith Margarita.\n\nMonolith Margarita\n\n2 oz silver tequila\n\n1 oz Cointreau\n\n1 oz fresh-squeezed lime juice\n\n1/2 oz charcoal simple syrup\n\nOrange juice ice sphere\n\nOrange twist\n\nMake simple syrup by heating 2 Tbsp suger + 2 Tbsp water + 1/2 tsp activated charcoal powder. Simmer until sugar and charcoal are dissolved, then cool. Combine tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, and charcoal syrup in a shaker with ice. Shake to chill, then strain over a glass filled with ice. Drop in orange juice ice sphere and twist of orange.\n\nThe visuals of this movie are particularly impressive when you think about the fact that computers weren’t used in the way they would have been today. Kubrick achieved his cinema magic with practical effects, and to me, those weightless astronauts and floating space shuttles look more real than anything we see in today’s science fiction landscape. Watching 2001, it’s a wonder filmmakers moved toward almost total reliance on technology, unless the unthinkable has already happened and HAL began steering Hollywood without anybody realizing. Something to think about as darkness descends… Cheers!"
