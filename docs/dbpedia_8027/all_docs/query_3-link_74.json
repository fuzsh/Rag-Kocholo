In my opinion, a large measure of this enthusiasm springs from the fact that the managers/agents and their pub/promo people have never had a picture quite like 2001 to sell before, and as such, 2001 constitutes a definite challenge to them. Full credits for \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" Anthony Frewin, who worked on the film, put together a full list of cast and crew for a special showing of \"2001\" at the National Film Theatre in London last September 1999. 2001 bit and pieces \"Originally Kubrick wanted to shoot 2001 in the wide-screen format of 1,85. \"I said, You've got to make it visceral. If you are going to put people in space there's nothing bigger than 70mm wide screen to do that and Cinerama is even better because it would be curved, and he agreed\". DOUGLAS TRUMBULL High impact immersive widescreen filmmaking with Douglas Trumbull\n\nInterviewed by Tony Earnshaw\n\nI have discovered that if you embrace digital technology from a new perspective and you say, Lets just get rid of all the historical artefacts and beliefs of what an image is or what it should look like and start over and do it all digitally and take advantage of high resolution cameras that are available and that very people use, the high resolutions projectors that are available that very people use and take advantage of the fact that the digital projectors that are in tens of thousands of movie theatres can run at 144fps and no ones using it. \"2001\" and Trumbull in London\n\nBy Mark Lyndon\n\nTrumbull showed us a tantalisingly brief excerpt of his new \"2001\" documentary and revealed that Warner was preparing a final cut of \"2001\" Douglas Trumbull - A Conversation\n\nBy Wolfram Hannemann\n\nIm absolutely confident that the digital image has caught up with film in terms of frame rate, resolution, steadiness, brightness and colour saturation. Ive gone totally digital; Im not interested in film at all.\n\n Go to Douglas Trumbull and Piers Bizony live on stage, attending \"2001\" Event in New York City WHEN IT CAME OUT When I was young and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was released, I recalled the huge number of negative reviews from the press. There were even unprecedented things like critics subsequently changing their reviews because on further viewings they came to appreciate it. I saw it in Cinerama when it came out and to this day it was the greatest cinematic experience of my life. I must have seen it 35 times in the cinema.\n\nEric Carter, 28.10.2014 2001: A Space Odyssey - The Missing Pieces\n\nBy Ken Kunkel\n\nIt is strange how the mind works. The older one gets, one can forget what happened yesterday but can remember details from decades ago. When I was a senior in high school, I took my two younger sisters to the Warner Cinerama Theatre in downtown Pittsburgh to see \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" It was the first week in town.\n\nMy 47-year Odyssey with \"2OO1\"\n\nBy Edward Oines\n\nI first saw '2OO1' as a not quite 14 year old in January 1969. It was being shown at the smallest theater in Sioux Falls, SD, and was leaving in 2 days, and I had to convince my mother to let my then 18 year old brother to take me on a school night. My memories were mainly of being struck by how realistic everything looked, when compared to Star Trek. I was hooked \"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY\" Production Information\n\nBy Warner Brothers, 2001\n\n\"2001: A Space Odyssey\" tells the story of astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole, aboard the spaceship Discovery, who are sent on an exploratory mission to a point near the outer reaches of the Solar System. The operation runs smoothly at first but then slowly, inexplicably, things begin to go wrong. The true nature of the mission is called into question and Discovery's highly sophisticated onboard computer, the HAL-9000, appears to be sabotaging the crew he was designed to assist, jeopardizing not only the mission but the lives of everyone onboard. 2OO1: A Space Odyssey Essential Presentation Procedure By METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER\n\nThe Running time of 2001: A Space Odyssey is 2 hours 20 minutes, plus 10 minutes of OVERTURE, ENTRACTE and EXIT MUSIC. Play OVERTURE music (3 minutes) with full House lights on. Dim House lights towards end of overture - allow for Censor certificate and open full screen on LION TRADE MARK THE PLOT One of the more common reactions to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is \"wait, what the hell happened exactly?\" In a 1969 interview with Joseph Gelmis, Kubrick explained the plot in a very straightforward manner:\n\nYou begin with an artifact left on earth four million years ago by extraterrestrial explorers who observed the behavior of the man-apes of the time and decided to influence their evolutionary progression. Then you have a second artifact buried deep on the lunar surface and programmed to signal word of man's first baby steps into the universe -- a kind of cosmic burglar alarm. And finally there's a third artifact placed in orbit around Jupiter and waiting for the time when man has reached the outer rim of his own solar system.\n\nWhen the surviving astronaut, Bowman, ultimately reaches Jupiter, this artifact sweeps him into a force field or star gate that hurls him on a journey through inner and outer space and finally transports him to another part of the galaxy, where he's placed in a human zoo approximating a hospital terrestrial environment drawn out of his own dreams and imagination. In a timeless state, his life passes from middle age to senescence to death. He is reborn, an enhanced being, a star child, an angel, a superman, if you like, and returns to earth prepared for the next leap forward of man's evolutionary destiny.\n\nThat is what happens on the film's simplest level. Since an encounter with an advanced interstellar intelligence would be incomprehensible within our present earthbound frames of reference, reactions to it will have elements of philosophy and metaphysics that have nothing to do with the bare plot outline itself.  Go to It's All in the Writing. Jan Harlan in Denmark Introduction to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY\n\nBy Sheldon Hall\n\nA curious thing happened during most shows at most theatres during the climactic stargate sequence, when viewers seated further back in the auditorium would move down to the area in front of the screen where they would lie flat on their backs in order to experience the episode in the most head-on manner possible Stanley and \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"\n\nBy Sir Sydney Samuelson\n\nI think they were all Panavision cameras  it was a very big assignment for us  I would think they had about five cameras. And Panavisions 65mm cameras, they even had a hand-holdable 400 foot loading version  a 65mm camera that went on your shoulder  and they had a kind of a midway camera  by that I mean it was a 1000 foot camera, but it wasnt blimped, so you couldnt use it if you wanted to get sync sound. Interview with Leon Vitali about \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"\n\nBy Thomas Hauerslev\n\nStanley Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" will hit 70mm screens in key markets around the world. The international release of the film begins in selected cinemas in London on March 7th. \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" will be \"previewed\" a bit earlier on February 18, 2001 as the closing event at the Berlin Film festival. How not to project \"2001\" in 70mm\n\nBy Frank Angel\n\nI go back to see if I could find someone, anyone who could address this problem. I am told by the kid sitting outside the projection booth door that THERE IS NO PROJECTIONIST. \"The projectionist,\" he explains to me, \"comes in only on Fridays.\" How wonderful for us. Comments to The Original Reserved Seat Engagements\n\nBy Herbert Born\n\nThere must a least have been done more than 143 initial 70mm prints, as the enclosed original leader of a German 70mm print from 1968 demonstrates. At this time the lab started counting with Nr. 1. The print itself is the Nr. 11 of the German dubbed sound prints, this may lead to the conclusion, that at least 11 70mm prints have been done for Germany in first run. DAISY, DAISY Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do.\n\nI'm half crazy all for the love of you.\n\nIt won't be a stylish marriage,\n\nI can't afford a carriage.\n\nBut you'll look sweet / upon the seat / of a bicycle built for two. Zero Gravity Toilet Instructions\n\nThe toilet is of the standard zero-gravity type. Depending on requirements, System A and/or System B can be used, details of which are clearly marked in the toilet compartment. When operating System A, depress lever and a plastic dalkron eliminator will be dispensed through the slot immediately underneath. When you have fastened the adhesive lip, attach connection marked by the large \"X\" outlet hose. Twist the silver coloured ring one inch below the connection point until you feel it lock."
