        "text": "With New Worlds magazine currently in creative limbo, I’ve found myself with time on my hands this month. The good news then is that I’ve been able to use this time in getting hold of an early copy of a book I’ve been wanting to read for ages from one of my favourite authors – 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nYou may have seen or at least heard of the movie – I still haven't seen it, sadly – but what about the book?\n\nThis one is special, as the cover clearly states. This is a novel, not a novelisation. Unlike a novelisation, which is usually based on the already-written script, the plot of this novel is a collaboration between the film director Stanley Kubrick and SF author Arthur C. Clarke.\n\nArthur C. Clarke (left) and Stanley Kubrick (right) on the set of the movie.\n\nI know that films often change between novel and script, so I’ll be interested to see how similar they are. I’ve been told that an early version of the novel was put together as long ago as 1964, before any film was in the can, but at the moment I have no idea how similar the finished novel version is to the earlier version of the novel – or indeed to the film!\n\nOK. To the book then. It begins with something that I can imagine as a voiceover in a movie, with rather attention-grabbing prose:\n\n“Behind every man now alive stand thirty ghosts, for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living. Since the dawn of time, roughly a hundred billion human beings have walked the planet Earth.”\n\nTypical Clarke – one of those ‘wow’ facts that create a sense of wonder and give a context before getting to the meat of the plot. It sets the scene for the first part of the book, where we meet Moon-Watcher, a man-ape from the ‘Dawn of Time’, thousands of years ago.\n\nMoon-Watcher’s life is pretty straightforward, then, even if life is hard – he hunts with his tribe, he eats, sleeps, and he mates, but occasionally will look up at the stars and the Moon and wonder about bigger things. Daily foraging has variable results, usually for the worst. We are never allowed to forget that Moon-Watcher can be hunted by other animals as well as hunt himself.\n\nOne night a mysterious slab of rock – the “New Rock” – appears in the group’s valley. Moon-Watcher touches it but as it is not food, it is pretty much dismissed by him and the rest of his group. However, at this point we get a glimpse of the fact that it is an alien machine. The following day the slab sends out a sound, which immobilises the group who are investigating the rock.\n\nMoon-Watcher and his tribe, from the movie.\n\nAlthough they do not realise it themselves, the monolith tests the man-apes and educates them. The effect on Moon-Watcher in particular is profound. He kills a leopard and then leads a fight against a rival group, the Others, using weapons.\n\nThe book then abruptly moves forward a few hundred thousand years and we find ourselves observing Dr. Heywood Floyd, Chairman of the National Council of Astronautics on a trip to the Moon. Journeying to the Moon seems as straightforward as me or you climbing onboard an airliner.\n\nAt this point we are in traditional Clarke-writing territory. The prose is in the usual calm, even detached manner of Clarke’s usual text. It is straightforward, direct and yet suffused with typical Clarke wry humour, such as his description on how to use a space toilet!\n\nA startlingly good image of \"Man on the Moon\". (From the movie.)\n\nFloyd is on the Moon is to see at first-hand an object known as TMA-1 discovered by the Americans in Tycho Crater. And here we seem to have a recycled idea. TMA-1 is an alien artifact that Floyd and his team are trying to determine the identity and origin of. Looking through my Clarke stories, I find that this is similar to the story Sentinel of Eternity, published in 1953, which describes a similar event on the Moon. It’s clearly an idea that appealed to both Kubrick and Clarke, as if an idea’s good, it’s worth using more than once, right?\n\nMuch is made of the point that there is clearly tension between the U.S. and the Soviet sections of the Moon base. Outposts are being denied outside communications with Earth, and political tensions mean that outside the scientific community missiles are being primed between the U.S., the Soviets, and the Chinese. (Oddly though there is no mention of British involvement. Perhaps Peter Sellers in Dr.Strangelove has put them off?)\n\nThroughout all of this part, Clarke describes the practicalities of a Moon-living lifestyle, how people travel, work and eat as this “first generation of the Spaceborn”. This sort of thing is Clarke’s bread-and-butter, and he clearly relishes spending time describing and explaining what this future Lunar lifestyle is like.\n\nFloyd’s arrival at the object leads to it reacting. A message leaves the object and travels out to the stars.\n\nThe story then leaps forward a few more years, to what is presumably the year 2001. The actions of the object have led to a galvanising of efforts from Earth. The result is the Discovery, a spaceship built and sent to Saturn after the detection of another magnetic anomaly, obviously named TMA-2.\n\nThe Discovery. From the movie.\n\nMost of the crew are in suspended animation for the journey that will take months. We focus upon the two astronauts left awake at this point in the story, Frank Poole and Dave Bowman. There is also the HAL-9000 computer, running all of the day-to-day mechanics of the ship.\n\nThe 'eye' of the ever-so-polite but flawed HAL-9000, from the movie. Are Kubrick and Clarke trying to tell us something of British manners?\n\nAll seems well. Life on board the spaceship seems actually quite boring and repetitive.\n\nThe fly in the ointment is that the never-failed supercomputer begins to act badly. Initially unbeknownst to Bowman and Frank Poole, HAL switches off the life support of the crewmembers in suspended animation, thus killing them. Eventually faults become more noticeable to the two crew, and when Poole is sent outside the ship to fix a communications antenna that doesn’t need fixing, they become aware that their infallible computer may be making errors.\n\nThe consequences of this are huge. As an artificial intelligence, HAL realises that the two men know that something is wrong and takes steps to deal with it. In the end, as Discovery approaches TMA-2 at Japetus, Bowman has to take a leap of faith and leave the ship in order to take a closer look at the anomaly. This leads to a Bowman taking a journey through the Eye of Japetus and the ambiguous ending of the novel:\n\n” Then he waited, marshaling his thoughts and brooding over his still untested powers. For though he was master of the world, he was not quite sure what to do next.\n\nBut he would think of something.“\n\nThe full wraparound dustjacket from New American Library. Artwork by Robert McColl.\n\nFirst of all, on finishing the book, I can see that this is clearly a Clarke novel. His practical descriptions of the spaceships, transport and the Moon base feel like they are straight out of his own British Interplanetary Society handbook.\n\nHowever, as much fun reading about these details is, the emphasis of the novel on the big picture is also typically Clarke-ean. It is about ‘the big picture’, to which the characters are but a minor part in a story covering millions of years.\n\nI liked the fact that HAL the computer is clearly not just a machine but also a character in the novel, but it did make me think whether HAL as a misfunctioning computer is a plea by Clarke not to blindly accept technology? Or perhaps the point is being made that for all of HAL’s sophistication and intelligence, humans are better?\n\nI understand that there has been a lot of discussion about what the end of the movie means, because this ending creates a lot of unanswered questions. It seems to have taken on an almost mystical status by film-watchers. To me, the main point of the novel 2001 seems to be about human evolution, albeit evolution uplifted by an alien (a link to Clarke’s novel Childhood’s End, perhaps?)\n\nThis sounds like perhaps this is a benevolent action. Clarke being Clarke, it seems (although that it is not clear) that it is for the greater good, some altruistic act, “passing it forward” as Robert Heinlein says.\n\n2001 may be seen as a plea for tolerance. Clarke’s distaste for war and violence is palpable throughout, although perhaps seen as a necessary evil. What the books seems to be telling me is that for all of our Earthly political and ideological divisions, the fighting and war and even the social inequality, Clarke (and presumably Kubrick) have taken what is the best of Humanity and shown us in 2001 that as a collective race we can be bigger, better and something more than what in context can be seen as our petty squabbles. There are no nasty villains here – even HAL has a twisted logic for his actions. Actually, the characters – even HAL! – are unfailingly polite to each other, even when they disagree, for we are looking at higher morals and ideas here instead.\n\nTo get there though will not be easy. Do we as a race need someone, or something, to hold our hand in order to not make mistakes and improve for the greater good? I got the feeling at the end that this was not only right but necessary for human evolution, and that Clarke (and/or Kubrick!) feels that we are on a long journey of advancement through time – an odyssey of the highest order.\n\nBut the actual reasons for these events are unknown. We do not know why the aliens are doing this – is it altruistic, or is there some other reason for it? Are we naïve to think that this is possibly good? Are such actions to enslave us or free us?\n\nClarke deliberately leaves it open for us to ponder upon, like Moon-Watcher, wondering what comes next. There is no clear, happy ending, instead the dawning of a new age. There are as many questions raised as answered. And in that respect, I think that the ending is entirely appropriate.\n\nIt is perhaps this idea that makes 2001 Clarke’s best and most ambitious work to date. This is not the mid-life crisis opinions of a venerable SF writer set in a novel. (I’m looking at you, Stranger in a Strange Land.) 2001 is definitely not New Wave, nor fancy in style, it does not test or break the boundaries of literature, science fiction or fiction.\n\nThose who dislike Clarke’s minimalist characterisation and his low-key, understated and sardonic style will not be swayed into praise by reading this book, although I loved it. The big (and frankly amazing!) images are left to the big screen via Kubrick, whilst Clarke gives us the nuts-and-bolts story, a big story told in such a matter-of-fact manner that the future seems possible and cautiously optimistic. I can accept that this view may be a little simplistic and naïve. I’m fairly sure that writers such as Samuel Delany will find little here that relates to them or their writing.\n\nBut for me 2001 (the novel, at least) is typical Clarke, in that in its own understated way it gives us a practical future against an epic timeline and at the same time has a distinctly humanitarian plot and a lot of unanswered questions."
