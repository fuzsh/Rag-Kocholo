        "text": "I thought it would be fun to talk about this forgotten gem by Jack Kirby, as I've always admired the man and he rarely did film adaptations much less original works within them. I believe this was the only one. Huge fan of Kubrick's film also, so this is like a match made in heaven. It may never be reprinted, and that's a damn shame.\n\nAfter leaving Marvel in 1970, Jack \"the King\" Kirby created several hits for DC Comics including Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth, The Demon, OMAC and his magnum opus, The Fourth World saga. When he returned to Marvel in 1975, one of the agreements made was for Kirby to do the adaptation of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Now this is strange for the fact that most comic adaptations of movies back then came out at the time of the film's release. The 2001: A Space Odyssey adaptation came out eight years after the film hit theatres. This was partly due to Marvel acquiring the rights from MGM in the mid-70's, but its also been said that Marvel only had one man in mind to do it, and only one man wanted to do it, and that was Kirby.\n\nNow if you've ever watched Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (and I hope you have), you might agree that it's a film light on dialogue yet heavy on surreal imagery just obscure enough to lend to the viewer's own interpretations. It's a journey through outer space but also cinematic space, surrounded by an orchestral boom of classical symphonies. Not really the kind of movie that would do well within a comic book setting. Marvel let Kirby not only draw the book but write it as well, a massive undertaking when considering comic panels can't even come close to conveying Kubrick's near wordless abstraction for the eyes.\n\nHowever, Kirby was in his prime and at the top of his game. He was also drawing The Eternals at the time, and his artwork was as good as its ever been. He decided to include additional dialogue from Arthur C. Clarke's original novel as well as an earlier script of the film, while also incorporating characters' own thoughts and feelings within the captions. The end result was a different kind of experience...less mystery, a more horrific HAL, and a brilliant take on the final stargate sequence, all wrapped within the psychedelic acid trip of Kirby's cosmic crackle.\n\nMarvel had decided to release their 2001 adaptation in treasury format, twice the size of a normal comic book, the artwork taking center stage. And in January of 1976, the 76-page adaptation was released to mixed reviews. The artwork was in no doubt mesmerizing, the Monolith hovering over mankind in a foreboding yet tantalizing sense of doom. Yet some readers felt the comic went against everything Kubrick had intended to do with the film. Marvel however wanted to make use of their acquired rights and therefore solicited Kirby to do an ongoing 2001 series.\n\nSeveral months after the 2001 treasury released in 1976, Kirby's 2001: A Space Odyssey #1 would hit the stands that December. Much like the first one, the new series was written and drawn all by Jack Kirby. He worked on the series at the same time he was working on The Eternals, switching between both titles. But this time, in taking concepts from the novel and movie, Kirby created his own stories within Clarke and Kubrick's space odyssey. But there was a catch -- no recurring characters could be created since it was yet to be known who would own those rights between Marvel and MGM (this wouldn't last very long).\n\nAt first, Kirby wasn't thrilled doing his own version, and the first couple issues kind of suffered with cut and paste sequences from the movie. It would take a few issues for Kirby to find his footing. The first two issues featured prehistoric characters seeking the monolith and gaining wisdom upon discovering it, with their future descendants fighting off aliens, experiencing the Star Gate and becoming reborn as New Seeds.\n\nSubsequent issues took on the same format while introducing characters such as Marak the Merciless, Norton of New York 2040 A.D., White Zero, Inter-Galactica and the Child. Marvel seemed to abandon the recurring characters problem as of issue #3, with many of these characters receiving a two-issue storyline.\n\nIssue #7 remains my favorite of the series and possibly one of Kirby's most underrated stories. In it, a man named Gordon Pruett becomes a New Seed and is thrust into a journey to explore other planets. It comes across a very violent planet where mankind is constantly at war, destroying everything around them. It watches as mankind extinguishes itself, and as the last man and woman on the planet fall it intervenes, transporting their essence to seed another uninhabited world where one day new life may begin again.\n\nThe last three issues of the series introduced X-51, otherwise known as Machine Man. Scientists have created AI robots that become destructive once sentient, much in the way that HAL 9000 discovered such in the film but this time on a larger scale. Interaction with a monolith transcends X-51 above violence against humans, and the story explores X-51's attempts to blend in with humanity while escaping certain destruction by the military. These latter issues proved successful enough to warrant a new Machine Man title in 1978.\n\nAll of these comics have never been republished and largely forgotten. And while a few people in the industry are campaigning for a massive \"Monolith Edition\" of Kirby's 2001 run, others doubt it will ever see the light of day again. Warner Bros. acquired MGM and now owns the rights to the film. Add in the Kubrick Estate, and it may prove too costly to even consider for Marvel.\n\nGoing to litter the thread with several more posts of Kirby's radiant artwork from this series, as there is no way to convey their magnificence in just one post."
