        "text": "On the 2nd episode of the special episode series called Breaking It Apart, co-host Kris Krainock and I take a look NOT at a new movie and what movies inspired it, but at a classic movie and what movies were inspired BY it… And this time we’re looking at the classic Stanley Kubrick feature 2001: A Space Odyssey. Somehow depicting outer space before we even made it out there, and with some of the most breathtaking visuals ever put to film, 2001 recently had an IMAX re-release which really let the amazingly unique and trippy views of outer space and wormholes shine. Narrowing down the influences on this one were especially difficult as the film clearly laid the groundwork for all of sci-fi from when it was released in 1968 to today. Puzzle pieces include Star Wars, The Tree of Life, Adaptation and The Simpsons.\n\nAnd for those keeping track of the Piecing It Together Podcast, just know that special series and episodes like this will continue to be a part of the future of the show, and we’ll continue figuring out the best way to brand them and tie them in to the overall puzzle theme as we continue doing them. While some special episodes will be a once in a while thing, Breaking It Apart will be a regular occurrence with its own numbering.\n\nAs always, SPOILER ALERT for 2001: A Space Odyssey (and any other movies we discussed)!\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey recently had an IMAX re-release which is now over in most markets, but you can still check the website to see if some cities still have it playing: https://www.imax.com/News/2001-A-Space-Odyssey-in-IMAX\n\nKris Krainock is a filmmaker and film fan who hosts Cinemondays, a weekly film event here in Las Vegas.
