        "text": "The greatest science fiction film of all time has finally arrived in a format befitting its grandeur and significance. Stanley Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey is available on home release this week in glorious 4K HDR and featuring the incomparable Dolby Vision. Always considered one of the most stunningly realistic sci-fi pictures ever made, the restoration and enhanced color of the new release further elevates the genius of the imagery and effects, demonstrating their parity with the finest visual effects in modern movies. The 4K version of 2001: A Space Odyssey also comes with a set of wonderful featurettes, several promotional cards from the film, and a booklet of behind-the-scenes photos, concept art, costumes, and character photos. Among the most important and iconic pictures ever produced, you can now see it in its perfected form in honor of its 50th anniversary -- and as you watch it, you'll once again wonder how such incredible visual effects could be half a century old.\n\nNo previous release of 2001: A Space Odyssey achieved the accurate aspect ratio that this 4K UHD release achieves. The new version was created by directly scanning a perfectly preserved spherical (i.e. flat) original 65mm negative of the film at 8K resolution, instead of the previously used 35 mm anamorphic version scanned for prior DVD/Blu-ray releases. The use of modern color correction techniques and color grading combined with the vastly improved 8K resolution scan has created a spectacular visual result. Everything appears more real -- many of 2001's outer space sequences look more convincing than the most expensive sci-fi VFX from recent movies -- and thus generates greater sense of awe, suspense, and reflection for the viewer.\n\nI've loved 2001: A Space Odyssey my whole life, starting at a young age. But I saw it on television, a small screen on which the images were converted into the square shape of those ancient devices we used for viewing before flatscreens existed. Later, I watched it over and over on a VHS recording, and still later on DVD. Eventually, I saw it on the big screen during a theatrical revival many years back, thrilled to be experiencing it in Cinerama at a dome theater for the first time, and yet feeling the color and visuals weren't in their best shape to create the fullest immersive experience possible. For the past several years, and especially since I first experienced the glory of Dolby Vision, I've desperately hoped some day 2001 would receive a proper restoration and color grading worthy of the film's brilliance and stature in cinema history.\n\nSo it is that this 4K UHD and Dolby Vision release of 2001: A Space Odyssey is a dream come true for me personally, and for fans worldwide who love the movie as much as I do and for cinephiles everywhere who simply care about preserving the integrity of landmark filmmaking. It is everything I'd hoped and believed it could and would be. By the way, this also comes on the coattails of the recent mindblowing 4K and Dolby Vision remastering of yet another classic lifelong favorite film, Superman: The Movie (also from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment), so I'm in home entertainment heaven lately.\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey rolls out its story slowly and methodically, with minimum dialogue (the first words aren't spoken until 25 minutes into the film, and the final words are spoken more than half an hour before the end) and a preference for long, lingering wide shots. It's a tale of human history, of human purpose, and of human potential, with many interpretations all ultimately speaking to the idea a greater power or intellect has imbued us with a knowledge and aggression capable of propelling us into the solar system and beyond, but also capable of destroying humanity just as our species learns to escape our Earthly confines to explore the stars.\n\nThe meditation on the development of human intelligence millions of years ago, and its relationship to aggression that helped humans survive in a hostile world -- changing from creatures largely controlled by their environment and fearful of it, to creatures capable of controlling their environment and getting a good nights' sleep free from constant fear of predators in the darkness -- is fascinatingly and complexly examined even while a great portion of the subtext and themes are implied rather than stated outright (the lack of dialogue during the film's depiction of early human species, and limited use of dialogue in the rest of the story, means very little is outright \"stated\" in the film anyway).\n\nIn one of the most memorable, recognizable, and perfect shots ever put to film, an ape-like human hurls a bone into the air after using it to slay an enemy, and the primitive bone-weapon spins through the clear blue sky before suddenly changing into a shot of an orbital space platform carrying nuclear warheads. The film didn't need to show us the progression of human intelligence and use of aggression to increasingly gain control over our environment and then over one another. Kubrick was wise enough to know the concept of early humans first picking up a tool and using it to strike down animals for food or kill an enemy could be juxtaposed against the image of a military weapon satellite and most viewers would instantly grasp the connection. It's perhaps the single greatest distillation of the human history of aggression and warfare ever filmed.\n\nYou can assume the monoliths are literally large black rectangular communication devices, or that they are something far more which defies human perception and conception entirely -- thus causing our comparatively simple human minds to perceive them as simple rectangular shapes without further detail, although they are actually something godlike beyond our capacity to comprehend or conjure into a proper image in our mind's eye. Is it aliens, is it inter-dimensional beings, or is it God(s)?\n\nThe answers to these and many other questions depend on how you choose to interpret the ideas and lessons of 2001: A Space Odyssey, even while the companion novel by author Arthur C. Clarke definitely takes a clear position on the matter -- aliens left the monoliths to inspire intelligence in our species and lure us into space so that we could learn to evolve further. But you needn't take the novel's interpretation at face value, if you prefer to embrace the film's original vague presentation of its themes and plotting. The film is not, as some falsely believe, an adaptation of the book; rather, both the film and the book were created in tandem, and released the same year. Kubrick and Clarke created the story, and then worked on their respective versions mostly separately, so they are overall the same but with certain key differences and degrees of explicitness regarding the nature of events.\n\nVisually, there is nothing else like 2001: A Space Odyssey. The depictions of space travel are hyper-realistic, yet also feel somewhat religious in their near-mythical reverence for the subject matter and their presentation analogous to other aspects of the natural world around us. The docking of a space plane at a space station in orbit around Earth, for example, is a beautiful dance that reminds viewers of a mating ritual, like a humming bird caught in slow-motion impression where the majesty of its flight and grace can be observed by human eyes otherwise incapable of perceiving it. The film invites us to witness events both monumental and insignificant, turning the colossal into the immediate or knowable and minutia into the epic and epiphanic, transforming all into an ambitious presentation reminding us we are small in the universe but never insignificant or truly apart from the endless scale of reality.\n\nThe featurettes include the previously released Standing On the Shoulders of Kubrick: 2001, which was part of the picture's 2007 DVD release. This short documentary examines the influence and legacy of the film on future generations of filmmakers and VFX artists, including George Lucas, Roger Ebert, Steven Spielberg, John Dykstra, Sydney Pollack, Douglas Trumbull, and many others. The 4K release also includes the featurettes Vision of a Future Passed: Prophecy of 2001, 2001: A Space Odyssey - A Look Behind the Future, and What Is Out There?\n\nOther special features in this new release are the documentary 2001: The Making of a Myth, the short 2001: FX and Early Conceptual Artwork, and Look: Stanley Kubrick, plus an audio commentary for the film and Jeremy Bernstein's 1966 audio interview with Kubrick. The theatrical trailer for 2001 is also included.\n\nFifty years later, 2001: A Space Odyssey continues to amaze and inspire. No fan of the film should be without this remarkable labor of love that is the 4K UHD and Dolby Vision release of 2001: A Space Odyssey. No fan of cinema in general, actually, should be without it. And if you've yet to discover the magic of Kubrick's greatest work, now is the perfect time to introduce yourself to the best possible version of the historic release.\n\nBox office figures and tallies based on data via Box Office Mojo , Rentrak, and TheNumbers."
