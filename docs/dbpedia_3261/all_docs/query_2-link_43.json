        "text": "The Sixties at OSU in Photos\n\nOSU Lantern and Makio photographers left a legacy of thousands of images of campus events from this eventful decade. Only a small portion of them could be reproduced in the hard copy edition of OSU in the Sixties due to cost. But thanks to the wonders of digital technology, we were able reproduce more than 150 of the most interesting of them on this web site. They are organized by school year, just like in the print edition.\n\nI’d like to thank the OSU Archives for making these photos available in an electronic format. You can find digitized Lanterns at digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/APA/Ohio and Makios at edu.arcasearch.com/usohosy. We have tried to identify the people in these photos whenever possible. If you recognize someone not identified, let us know at shkurti.1@osu.edu, and we will include that information to complete this photographic record.\n\nBill Shkurti\n\nCover. Strike! Students support the Ad Hoc Coalition protest at a spring 1970 Oval rally. (Makio, 1970, 176)\n\nChapter 1: New Frontiers (1960–61)\n\nP.1. New freshmen in the fall of 1959. This last freshman class of the 1950s was predominately male and white. Only about forty percent were expected to graduate. (Lantern, 9/25/59, 1)\n\nP.2. The Oval served as the campus town square. (Lantern, 10/4/63, 1)\n\n1.1. Freshman Clarence Anderson does not appear to be overly enthused as he is fitted for his ROTC uniform by SFC Albert Moulaison the first day of classes. (Makio, 1961, 25)\n\n1.2. After being banned from speaking on campus, William Mandel (standing right) addresses a crowd of about two hundred in the backyard of Assistant Professor Henry St. Onge (left) at 65 E. Woodruff. (Lantern, 4/14/61, 1)\n\n1.3. Council of Student Affairs served as traffic cop and court of last resort for student life issues. Note in this case, women are well represented. Top row: Larry Katz (student), Dean Conaway, Dr. Burnett (faculty), Bill Fields (student), Cora Riber (student), Dean Ross, Myron Belkind (Lantern editor).
