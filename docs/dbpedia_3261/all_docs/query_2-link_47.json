        "text": "David Lee Thomas 82, of Circleville, Ohio and Winter Haven, Florida passed away peacefully on Wednesday, January 31, 2024 with family by his side.\n\nDavid was born on September 26, 1941 to Henry and Goldie Thomas in Columbus, Ohio. He attended West High School. David had proudly driven semi-trucks and retired from both Lazarus/Macy's and Conway Central Express (CCX). In 2002, David married Susan Thomas. The love he had for Susan extended to her family of five children and their families.\n\nYou could always find David on the golf course, even on the not so warm days. When not playing golf, he was found watching Fox News for the latest political reports. And, oh how he could give a great debate! David loved his home in Florida. He especially enjoyed bowling and golfing with his friends in the Sunshine State.\n\nDavid was preceded in death by his parents, Henry and Goldie Thomas. David is survived by his loving wife, Susan Thomas and her children: Jody (Kenny) Glass, Sherry (Jack) Holbrook, Lisa (Jaime) Bowling, Angela (Nate) Copeland, and Paul (Katie) Fisher. He is also survived by his uncle Bob Sowers, his step children: Donavon Jewett, Debra (Tony) Houston, and niece: Lisa (Allen) Reese, grandchildren: Hannah (Doug), Kaylyn (David), Taylor (Paul), Ashlee, Jaili, Hunter (Hannah), Karissa, Allison, Jack, Amelia, Jenna, and Lindsey, and great grandchildren.\n\nFamily and friends are welcome to attend Visitation Monday February 5, 2024 10:00 a.m.- 12 Noon, with a service immediately following at Heritage Free Will Baptist Church 575 Obetz Rd, Columbus, Ohio. Pastor Tim Stout will be officiating. Interment following the service at Forest Cemetery in Circleville, Ohio.\n\nThose who touch our lives stay in our hearts forever."
