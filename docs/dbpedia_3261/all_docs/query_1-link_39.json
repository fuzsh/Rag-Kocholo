        "text": "The past would temporarily become the future under a proposal before the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board next week to hire former Superintendent David Fisher to fill a leadership gap.\n\nBoard President John Erwin said Fisher has agreed to serve as interim superintendent for four months after the contract of current Superintendent Jon Gurban expires June 30. That would take the district through October, when it hosts the National Recreation and Park Association annual meeting.\n\nThe proposal was greeted favorably by the five commissioners contacted by the Star Tribune Friday. They make up a majority of the nine-member board. \"I'm extremely pleased,\" said Bob Fine, who wanted Gurban to keep his job. \"I'm impressed,\" said Liz Wielinski, who voted against keeping Gurban.\n\nFisher served as superintendent from 1981 to 1999 and was the last to occupy the superintendent's house in Lyndale Farmstead park. He worked for Minneapolis parks for 29 years.\n\nThe board decided in January not to renew the contract of the controversial Gurban, who headed parks since 2003. Erwin had explored retaining him until October, but Gurban said in a letter Friday that he won't stay.\n\nErwin proposes to pay Fisher $50,000 and travel expenses. He also proposes extending Gurban's health and life insurance benefits for nine months, which along with a cash payment, would total $20,000.\n\nHe said the combined amount is about what the board would have paid Gurban for a four-month contract extension.\n\nUnder Fisher, the Park Board helped to renovate the city's central riverfront while collaborating on the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden and building the Neiman complex at Fort Snelling. It also won top honors for its parks in 1989."
