        "text": "Fact Check: Biden on the special counsel’s findings about his handling of classified docs\n\nIn an interview with NBC’s Lester Holt on Monday, President Joe Biden claimed that it was concluded he did nothing wrong in his handling of classified documents after he left the office of vice president.\n\nFacts First: This claim needs context. CNN reported that while special counsel Robert Hur’s report released earlier this year did not charge Biden with a crime, it found the president willfully retained classified information, including top-secret documents, and knew he was in possession of some documents as far back as 2017. Biden also shared some of that information with the ghostwriter of his 2017 memoir.\n\nHur decided not to charge Biden primarily because he found that nothing proved a willful intent by Biden to illegally hold on to classified information and because of his cooperation with the investigation.\n\nDuring his testimony to Congress in March, Hur was pushed by Democratic lawmakers to declare Biden’s innocence — something he refused to do.\n\nRead more fact checks of statements made at the RNC.\n\nFormer Biden supporter said she will vote for Trump in November\n\nLinda Fornos, an immigrant Latina woman from Nevada, told the crowd gathered at the Republican National Convention that she “made a mistake” in voting for Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nThe crowd booed in response and she said, “I’m sorry.”\n\n“This November my vote won’t be taken for granted. And this time, I won’t regret it. Please join me in voting for Donald J. Trump,” she concluded.\n\nLabor boss says \"the system is broken\" for American workers\n\nSean O’Brien, the general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said American families know that “the system is broken” and that “working people have no chance at winning this fight.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Donald Trump have been actively vying for the endorsement from the Teamsters, an influential union representing 1.3 million American workers.\n\nThe union traditionally withholds its endorsement until after both parties hold their conventions, and it remains unclear whether – or how – that endorsement will materialize.\n\nO’Brien said that his union is not “beholden to anyone or any party” and said that he wants to work with a bipartisan coalition to “accomplish something real.”\n\nO’Brien praised former President Trump for inviting him. “No other nominee in the race would have invited the Teamsters into this arena,” he said.\n\nHe said Trump “is a candidate who was not afraid of hearing from new, loud and often critical voices.”\n\nThis post has been updated with more remarks from O’Brien.\n\nWho is Usha Vance, the wife of Trump’s running mate?\n\nJD Vance has had several introductions to the American people: as the author of a memoir on what ails the White working class, as a newly elected Republican senator in his home state of Ohio and, on Monday, as his party’s nominee for vice president.\n\nHis wife, Usha, has been by his side through it all.\n\nAs the Ohio delegation chanted her husband’s name on the Republican convention floor in Milwaukee, Usha Vance stood beside the first-term senator and applauded as he was nominated by voice vote to be Donald Trump’s running mate.\n\nFor years, the senator has described his wife as a key part of his success, dating back to when the two attended law school together at Yale University, where Usha Vance also graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor’s degree.\n\nIn his 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” JD Vance described her as his “Yale spirit guide,” helping him navigate life at the elite university where they met.\n\nThe daughter of Indian immigrants, Usha Chilukuri grew up in a suburb of San Diego. After college – two stints at Yale and a master’s of philosophy at the University of Cambridge – she has clerked for two Supreme Court justices – Brett Kavanaugh when he served on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nRead more about Usha Vance.\n\nFact Check: Trump makes false claims about election fraud in RNC video\n\nThe Republican National Convention played a video in which former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to use “every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,” including voting by mail.\n\nTrump relentlessly disparaged mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has continued to sharply criticize it during the current campaign.\n\nTrump’s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would “once and for all secure our elections” as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying: “We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – slightly vaguer versions of his usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen and that Democrats are serial election cheaters. The 2020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump’s opponents excel.\n\nThe Trump administration’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post-election November 2020 statement:\n\nRead more fact checks of statements made at the RNC.\n\nTrump at RNC alongside running mate JD Vance after surviving assassination attempt\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is at the Republican National Convention arena alongside his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\nThis appearance comes two days after he survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nThey both were formally nominated as the GOP ticket for the 2024 presidential election earlier today.\n\nTrump and Vance were surrounded by the Trump family. The Ohio senator also sat next to House Speaker Mike Johnson who spoke at the RNC earlier this evening. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson was also seen in the box in the same row as Trump.\n\nThe crowd chanted “fight” — the word Trump had shouted several times, while pumping his fist in the air after the assassination attempt.\n\nThe crowd also cheered “USA! USA!” and “We want Trump!” as singer Lee Greenwood performed his song “God Bless the USA!”\n\nFormer White House physician says he assessed Trump's ear wound and bandaged him up\n\nFormer White House physician Ronny Jackson said he medically assessed former President Donald Trump’s wound to his ear after Saturday’s assassination attempt and bandaged Trump up earlier today.\n\nDuring an interview on “The Benny Show” podcast on Monday, the Texas congressman said he “checked out” Trump’s ear Monday morning and “there was no concussive effect from the bullet” because it was far enough from Trump’s head.\n\nJackson said that Trump’s injury is “dressed up. He’ll be okay … it’s going to granulate and heal in, and he’s not going to need anything to be done with it.”\n\nJD Vance says Trump told him, \"You're the guy who can help me in the best way\"\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance delved into the phone call he received from former President Donald Trump informing him he had been selected as his running mate.\n\nDuring the call, Trump explained why he chose Vance to run alongside him, the Ohio senator said.\n\nVance acknowledged that he wouldn’t have won his Ohio Senate race in 2022 without Trump’s endorsement and that it contributed to the closeness of their relationship.\n\n“He said rightfully that we have been very, very close for a long time, but especially since I endorsed you in 2022. And I would not have won that race without Donald Trump’s endorsement,” Vance said. “The president’s trust then and his partnership since then has been something I value a great deal.”\n\nVance, a father of three, said he became “so embarrassed” when his 7-year-old son, Ewan, began making noise in the background of the call, but Trump brought him on the line.\n\n“He actually has me put my 7-year-old son on the phone. If you think about this, everything that’s happened. The guy just got shot out a couple of days ago and he takes the time to talk to my 7-year-old. It’s a moment I’ll never forget,” Vance said.\n\nAt the time he received the call, Vance said he wasn’t sure if it was good news or bad news.\n\nAcknowledging his friend and one of the other top contenders, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Vance said that his approach to the veepstakes was to “enjoy the ride.”\n\n“What an honor to be considered. If it had been Senator Rubio – obviously, Marco’s a good guy, he’s a good friend, so I tried to just have a good attitude,” Vance said.\n\nVance, who appeared with his wife Usha in Milwaukee today, said, “My family’s very excited, obviously asking a lot of questions about it.”\n\nSen. Marsha Blackburn slams Biden administration for rising prices\n\nTennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn spoke at the Republican National Convention on Monday about how “life was good and getting better” under President Donald Trump.\n\nThe policies of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris “are destroying small businesses,” she said, also blaming them for rising gas prices.\n\nShe said that if Trump is reelected, he will make his tax cuts permanent.\n\nBlackburn also said Trump would fire 85,000 Internal Revenue Service agents.\n\nThe Tennessee senator also criticized the Democratic president and vice president for their “burdensome” regulations. Meanwhile, she said, the Republican Party’s platform “pledges seven times to cut regulations that are killing jobs and costing you thousands of dollars.”\n\nShe highlighted stories of average Americans, including the Black woman owner of a cafe in Milwaukee who voted for Biden in 2020 and now plans to vote for Trump because she believes his policies will be better for small business owners.\n\nKirk says young Americans having families \"feels farther away than ever\" under Biden\n\nCharlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, said Monday that having a family is a “dream that feels farther away than ever” for young Americans under the Biden administration.\n\nHe accused Democrats of giving “hundreds and billions of dollars to illegals and foreign nations, while Gen Z has to pinch pennies just so they can never own a home, never marry and work until they die, childless.”\n\nTurning Point USA is a nonprofit “whose mission is to identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote freedom,” according to its website.\n\nKirk said he talks to a lot of young people, especially those on college campuses. He said people he talks to are frustrated with things like home prices.\n\nThis post has been updated with remarks from Kirk.\n\nFact Check: Sen. Katie Britt on Americans working two jobs\n\nSen. Katie Britt of Alabama suggested in her Republican National Convention speech on Monday that during President Joe Biden’s term, Americans are having to take on two jobs to deal with the cost of living.\n\n“With President Trump, the tough choice was which job offer to accept, now it’s which second job to take just to pay the bills,” she said.\n\nFacts First: The number of workers who hold multiple jobs as a percentage of total employment has never gone above the highest level under Donald Trump, according to Labor Department data.\n\nWhile it’s true that the annual inflation rate reached its highest level in more than four decades under Biden (in June 2022, though it has since declined), Americans aren’t necessarily taking on two jobs more than usual to deal with it. In fact, the number of Americans holding multiple jobs as a share of all employed workers was below levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic throughout 2021 and 2022. It has increased over the past several months, reaching 5.2% in June. The share of workers with multiple jobs hasn’t gone above 5.3% since the Great Recession.\n\nVenture capitalist David Sacks warns of \"four more years of chaos\" if Democrats are elected\n\nDavid Sacks, a venture capitalist and former CEO of Yammer, said there would be “four more years of chaos and failure” if Democrats were elected and claimed that the party was “gaslighting the entire country” about President Joe Biden’s fitness to serve another term.\n\nSacks held a fundraiser for Trump alongside other Silicon Valley venture capitalists at his home last month. He described his home city of San Francisco as a “cesspool of crime, homeless encampments and open drug use.”\n\nThe tech investor slammed Biden as “the symbol of an America in decline.”\n\n“This may be our present, but it does not have to be our future.”\n\nThis post has been updated with Sacks’ remarks from the Republican National Convention.\n\nBiden not surprised by Cannon classified docs dismissal\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he was “not surprised” that Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case against former President Donald Trump but that he did not agree on the basis for the case’s dismissal.\n\nHe added, “The basis upon which the case was thrown out, I find specious, because I don’t agree with Clarence Thomas’ dissent and or the Supreme Court decision on immunity.”\n\nBiden noted to Holt that he had an independent prosecutor review his handling of classified documents, noting that he was “totally cooperative.”\n\nAnalysis: This isn’t the same Republican Party that showed up to its convention in 2016\n\nMonday night’s primetime programming is showcasing a far more professional and disciplined GOP and is helping to explain why Donald Trump is, by almost every measure, currently winning this election less than four months out.\n\nThere was a stream of Black Republican lawmakers, several of them rising stars, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Delegates then heard from a working mom with two jobs from Arizona and Alabama Sen. Katie Britt, who has a young family. Later in the evening, Sean O’Brien of the International Brotherhood of the Teamsters will become one of the few top union leaders to address an RNC.\n\nAnd then there’s the pick of vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, an Ohio senator and a clear play for the Blue Wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, without which Biden can’t win reelection.\n\nThe Trump team is therefore targeting women and suburban voters, culturally conservative union workers, minority voters and Biden’s blue-collar heartland. The president has had real problems with fraying at the edge of the traditional Democratic coalition and Monday night’s program shows the Trump campaign knows exactly what it’s doing.\n\nThe American dream is slipping away for \"too many\" under Biden's economic policies, Rep. Byron Donalds says\n\nFlorida Rep. Byron Donalds, who was once considered to be a potential running mate for Donald Trump, talked in his address at the Republican National Convention about his struggle of growing up poor and the realities of financially struggling families in America during the Biden administration.\n\nHe talked about the struggle of growing up in a poor household with just his single mother in Brooklyn, New York, who “fought for me” and provided him good education.\n\nHe said every parent deserves to choose what education their child receives. Donalds also thanked her in his speech and said he is grateful to be her son.\n\nThe post has been updated with more of Donalds’ remarks.\n\nFact Check: North Carolina gubernatorial candidate’s economic claims\n\nLt. Gov. Mark Robinson of North Carolina, now running for governor, made a series of economic claims in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Monday. One about the Biden era was misleading, while another about the Trump era touted pre-pandemic statistics without acknowledging that when Trump left office the economy was in much worse shape.\n\nRobinson said that under President Joe Biden’s administration, “grocery prices have skyrocketed, and gas has nearly doubled.”\n\nFacts First: It is true that grocery prices have jumped by over 20% since Biden was sworn in, but gas prices aren’t double what they were when he took office.\n\nThe national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.52 on Monday, according to AAA. When Biden was inaugurated, the national average was $2.39.\n\nRobinson also claimed that under former President Donald Trump, unemployment was “at a historic low.” That was certainly true prior to the pandemic. For instance, in February 2020, the nation’s unemployment rate was at 3.5%, the lowest since the late 1960s. By comparison, the average monthly unemployment rate over the past decade was 4.8%. But when Trump left office, it was at 6.4%, far from historic lows.\n\nJD Vance told CNN he was \"definitely not\" voting for Trump in 2016 election\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate JD Vance told CNN in 2016 that he was “definitely not” going to vote for Donald Trump in that year’s election.\n\nIn an interview, CNN’s Jake Tapper pressed Vance, whose 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” had catapulted him to fame as a “Trump whisperer” capable of explaining Trump’s appeal to the White working class,” on his voting plans.\n\nTrump’s vice presidential announcement Monday capped off a dramatic transformation on Vance’s part — from a key voice in the “Never Trump” movement to Trump’s running mate. While CNN’s KFILE has documented many of Vance’s criticisms of Trump during his 2016 run and early into his first term in the White House, the Ohio Republican had fully embraced Trump by 2020 and later won the former president’s endorsement in his successful 2022 bid for the US Senate.\n\nIn a statement to CNN last month, Vance cited Trump’s “many successes in office” for changing his mind on the former president.\n\n“I’m proud to be one of his strongest supporters in the Senate today and I’m going to do everything in my power to ensure President Trump wins in November — the survival of America depends on it,” he said.\n\nAnalysis: Republicans are piling on Biden, but they sure want to run against him\n\nRepublicans are delivering withering criticism against President Joe Biden in every way possible, even with delegates waving signs saying “Trump Success = Biden Failure.”\n\nBut even as Republicans are mocking, criticizing and belittling Biden, they sure would like to run against him.\n\nRepublicans believe Biden is an easier candidate to beat. Vice President Kamala Harris or someone else would be a wildcard.\n\nIt’s ironic, Biden is being booed, but Republicans hope they can keep doing so until November.\n\nWall Street Journal: Musk has plans to commit $45 million a month to super PAC supporting Trump\n\nElon Musk is planning on supporting Donald Trump’s presidential campaign by committing $45 million a month to a new super PAC backing the former president, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe super PAC, called America PAC, is also backed by the founder of Palantir Technologies and the Winklevoss twins, among others, the report said.\n\nAmerica PAC aims to help registering voters, persuade people to vote early and to ask for mail-in ballots in swing states, one person told the Journal.\n\nSome background: In May, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources, that Musk has discussed advising Trump should he win the 2024 election.\n\nMusk called Trump directly via cellphone to explore a role that could potentially give Musk significant influence over US policies. It’s not clear based on the Journal’s reporting which party initiated conversations about the potential role.\n\nBritt says Biden is \"not capable\" as president: \"Trump is the change we need\"\n\nAlabama GOP Sen. Katie Britt on Monday said President Joe Biden is “not capable” of his duties as commander in chief as she told attendees at the Republican National Convention that former President Donald Trump is “the change we need.”\n\nShe knocked the Biden administration for its handling of the economy, claiming, “Now our lives are way that much more difficult and way more expensive. Under Biden-Harris, prices are high and expectations are low.”\n\nMaking the case that a Trump administration is the better alternative, Britt said, “Biden-Harris keep making things worse and we know that the current president is not capable of turning things around.”\n\n“His weakness is costing us our opportunities, our prosperity, our security, our safety. Each diminished. All in decline, just like the man in the Oval Office and it doesn’t have to be this way,” she continued.\n\n“Let’s roll up our sleeves. Send President Trump back to the White House and get America back on track,” Britt said.\n\nJohnson delivered old version of RNC speech erroneously loaded into teleprompter\n\nSen. Ron Johnson delivered an old version of his Republican National Convention speech on Monday night in Milwaukee, calling Democratic policies a “clear and present danger to the country,” as former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies, including the Wisconsin senator himself, have called for unity in the wake of the assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nJohnson’s spokesperson confirmed to CNN that the senator delivered an old version of his remarks that had been erroneously loaded into the teleprompter, instead of the new version calling for unity.\n\nJohnson told Republican delegates that Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden have “made our lives less safe and far more expensive,” before criticizing Democrats on border security, government spending and gender policies.\n\n“Today’s Democrat agenda, their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our institutions, to our values and our people,” Johnson said.\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican told the state’s delegates on Monday morning that he was “so pleased” that Trump had decided to alter his planned convention speech to capture a unifying message.\n\nStill, Johnson told the delegation he expected Republicans to continue to draw contrasts with their political rivals.\n\nJohnson said he believes the “vast majority of Democrats” love the country, as Republicans do, adding, “we’ve got different visions, we have different policies, but they love this country.”\n\nFact Check: MTG on Transgender Day of Visibility\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said while attacking Democrats in her convention speech Monday that “the establishment in Washington” held Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter this year.\n\n“They promised normalcy and gave us Transgender Visibility Day on Easter Sunday,” the Georgia Republican said.\n\nFacts first: This claim needs context. Transgender Day of Visibility has been held annually on March 31 since it was started in 2009 as a day of awareness to celebrate the successes of transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Easter is celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the first day of spring and can change year to year. The holiday happened to fall on March 31 in 2024.\n\nResponding to Republicans criticizing President Joe Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in an April 1 briefing said she was “surprised by the misinformation” surrounding Easter and Transgender Day of Visibility falling on the same day.\n\n“Every year, for the past several years, on March 31, Transgender Day of Visibility is marked. And as we know — for folks who understand the calendar and how it works, Easter falls on different Sundays every year. And this year, it happened to coincide with Transgender Visibility Day. And so, that is the simple fact,” she said.\n\nPrivate efforts to nudge Biden to step aside continue, sources tell CNN\n\nThe public calls from Democrats asking President Joe Biden to bow out of the presidential race have quieted in recent days, but private efforts to nudge the president and his top aides continue, several Democratic sources tell CNN.\n\nAmong the efforts, these sources say, are repeated memos from a seasoned and respected Democratic pollster, Stanley Greenberg, sharing his take that Biden is on track to lose the election, and in a way that does deep damage to other Democratic candidates.\n\nThese sources said Greenberg has sent several memos over the past two weeks, since the president’s devastating debate performance, analyzing polling internals he asserts show the president’s position continues to deteriorate because Americans overwhelmingly do not see him as up to serving four more years.\n\nGreenberg has been a leading Democratic pollster for decades and his work includes advising Bill Clinton’s two winning presidential campaigns. He declined comment when contacted Monday evening.\n\nSeveral Democratic members of Congress also have continued to lobby privately, these sources said, urging top Biden advisers to consider the damage to Biden’s legacy if the president not only loses the White House but Republicans hold the House and capture the Senate majority.\n\nOne Democratic lawmaker told CNN some top Biden aides get “the depth of this” but believe it can be turned around and in any event describe the president as adamant in the belief he can win. In his NBC News interview Monday, for example, the president again made clear he has no intention of stepping aside.\n\nThe lawmaker’s view was that it was counterproductive to make additional public calls for Biden to step aside right now, because of the imperative of a unified party response to this week’s Republican convention and because of the president’s repeated public statements about staying in the race.\n\nBut this Democrat predicted that approach would change if the polling and other data after the GOP convention showed the president’s standing deteriorating more.\n\nFact Check: Marjorie Taylor Greene’s misleading claim about Biden-era job growth\n\nIn her speech at the Republican National Convention, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia claimed of Democrats: “They claim that our economy is thriving, yet hundreds of thousands of American-born workers lost their jobs these past few years.”\n\nFacts First: This is misleading at best. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that the number of American-born workers with jobs has grown significantly during President Joe Biden’s administration. About 130.9 million American-born workers were employed in June, an increase of nearly 4.7 million since June 2021, shortly after Biden took office. (This data is not seasonally adjusted, so we have to look at the same month in each year for an accurate comparison. In January 2021, the month Biden was sworn in, about 123 million American-born workers were employed.)\n\nThere is always churn in the labor market, so it’s certainly possible that hundreds of thousands of individual American-born workers lost their jobs during this period – but contrary to Greene’s insinuation, there have been far greater gains than losses under Biden for American-born workers as a group.\n\nFact Check: Republican chair falsely claims Middle East was \"at peace\" 4 years ago\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in his speech at the party’s convention on Monday: “Four years ago, Europe and the Middle East were at peace.”\n\nFacts First: Whatley’s claim is false. Whatever the merits of the Abraham Accords that Trump’s administration helped to negotiate, in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed in 2020 to normalize relations with Israel (Morocco and Sudan followed), there was still lots of unresolved armed conflict around the Middle East four years ago in mid-2020 and when Trump left office in early 2021.\n\nThe list notably included the civil war in Yemen; the civil war in Syria; and the conflicts between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, between Israel and Hezbollah on its border with Lebanon, between Israel and Syria, and what former State Department official Aaron David Miller called “the war between the wars between Israel and Iran on air, land and sea.” Also, the US, its allies and civilians continued to be attacked in an unstable Iraq.\n\n“It’s a highly inaccurate statement,” Miller, who worked on Mideast peace negotiations while in government and is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said last fall, when Trump himself made a similar claim about having achieved peace in the Middle East.\n\nDana El Kurd, senior nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC think tank, also called that claim “false” when Trump made it. She said in a November email: “The Abraham Accords did not achieve peace in the Middle East. In fact, violence escalated in Israel-Palestine in the aftermath of the Accords (using any metric you can think of – death tolls, settlement violence, etc).”\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene celebrates Trump’s nomination but says it’s a “somber moment” for the nation\n\nGeorgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene celebrated former President Donald Trump’s GOP presidential nomination but called it a somber moment for the country after the assassination attempt on the former president.\n\nShe also prayed for Corey Comperatore, the man shot and killed during the attempted assassination of Trump. “He displayed the ultimate show of life when he shielded his wife and daughter, sacrificing his own life,” she said.\n\nGreene slammed Democrats over policy issues including the border crisis and the economy, while arguing Trump “has and will make America successful again.”\n\nSen. Tim Scott attacks Biden and pitches vision of Republican policies\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott attacked President Joe Biden on topics like inflation and the border during his remarks at the Republican National Convention on Monday.\n\nScott, who was at one point a potential vice presidential pick for Donald Trump, said inflation is “crushing families” and said the border is hurting working-class families.\n\nThe senator talked about his life growing up with a single mother who “taught me to work hard, to take responsibility and reject victimhood.” He attacked cities and states run by Democratic leaders and asserted that conservative values and Republican policies are the ones that “lifts people up.”\n\n“America, we deserve better,” he said to cheers from the crowd.\n\nScott pressed on the importance of the election in November, saying voters are “not deciding simply the fate for the next four years, we’re setting a course for the next 40 years.”\n\nWoman describes being at hospital where Trump was treated after rally shooting\n\nDuring a meeting Monday evening in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, a woman said she was treated at the same hospital as former president Donald Trump after the attempted assassination.\n\nKaren, who identified herself only by her first name, said she is from Monaca, Pennsylvania, while speaking at a gathering held by Right 2 Liberty, a conservative group.\n\nShe told the group that she was at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally before she became overheated and was transported by ambulance to Butler Memorial Hospital for treatment. The high temperature in Butler on Saturday was 91 degrees Fahrenheit, according to CNN Weather.\n\nKaren said she was sitting in a wheelchair in a hospital waiting room when her husband started screaming down the hallway: “Where’s Karen? Where’s Karen? He’s been shot! He’s been shot!”\n\nPeople in the waiting room were crying as they watched the rally on the television, she described.\n\nKaren said men entered the parking lot with helmets and guns and then former president Trump exited an SUV and walked into the emergency room.\n\nShe described a small prayer patients performed in the waiting room for the former president.\n\nKaren added that her husband livestreamed Trump walking into the emergency room door on social media.\n\nCNN watched a livestream of the Right 2 Liberty event, but has not verified Karen’s account.\n\nTrump and Vance expected to appear in family box tonight at RNC, sources say\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are expected to appear together publicly for the first time tonight since Trump announced his running mate.\n\nTrump and Vance are expected to appear in the family box at tonight’s convention, two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nGoFundMe for man killed at Trump rally shooting surpasses $1 million\n\nA GoFundMe set up to support the family of Corey Comperatore, the man killed at Saturday night’s Trump rally, has surpassed $1,000,000.\n\nThe fundraiser’s original goal was only $7,000, but has raised over $1 million in just one day, according to a statement from the organizer.\n\nThe organizer of the GoFundMe, Jason Bubb, wrote that he is a neighbor, friend, and personal trainer of Comperatore’s daughter.\n\nThe fundraiser has been verified by GoFundMe’s global Trust and Safety team, according to a GoFundMe spokesperson.\n\nFact Check: RNC video attacks Biden with 2-year-old gas price figure\n\nThe Republican National Convention featured a video attacking President Joe Biden over the price of gas. But the video misleadingly deployed out-of-date figures as if they were current.\n\nA narrator claimed: “When President Trump left office, gas cost only $2.20. Under Biden and Harris, gas skyrocketed to the highest price in history, over five bucks a gallon.” Later in the video, a young man said, “Within my first year of driving, I’m having to deal with an average of $5.03 across the nation,” and a woman said, “It’s impossible to pay $5.03. We need to care about our people better than that.”\n\nFacts First: These claims about Biden-era gas prices are two years out of date. The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline was about $3.52 on Monday, according to the AAA. The national average did, under Biden, hit a record high of more than $5 per gallon – about $5.02, according to AAA data – but that happened in June 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered a global spike in oil prices. The RNC videos offered no indication that the national average has since fallen substantially.\n\nAlso, the national average on the day Trump left office in January 2021 was about $2.39 per gallon, not $2.20, though it was lower than $2.20 in some states.\n\nInternational leaders continue to respond to assassination attempt on Trump\n\nLeaders from around the world continue to respond to the attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump.\n\nThese are the latest to respond on Monday:\n\nRussia: The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin has not contacted former US President Donald Trump after his assassination attempt on Saturday and has no plans to. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also reiterated Monday his condemnation of the attack after denouncing any “violence in politics” on Sunday.\n\nSlovakia: Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who was targeted in an assassination attempt back in May, blamed “progressive and liberal media” for Saturday’s assassination attempt. The Slovakian leader was left in critical condition after he was shot from close range five times after an off-site government meeting earlier this year. A man described as a politically motivated “lone wolf” was charged with his attempted murder. Fico called the attempted assassination of Trump a “photocopy” of what happened to him.\n\nSouth Africa: In a post on X, South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa described the attempted assassination as “a stark reminder of the dangers of political extremism and intolerance.” “Political violence is the antithesis of democracy. I wish former President Trump a speedy recovery,” his post continued.\n\nKing Charles III: King Charles III wrote privately to former US President Donald Trump on Sunday through the United Kingdom’s US embassy, Buckingham Palace told CNN. A royal source told CNN the Palace is not sharing details of what was contained in the letter as it is classed as private, but they added his sentiments are in keeping with those communicated by the British Prime Minister. On Sunday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “appalled by the shocking scenes” at Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nWe will update this post with more from global leaders as we get them throughout the day.\n\nAnalysis: In the 1870s, there were 2 assassination attempts on political leaders. Here's what they warn us\n\nOn May 7, 1873, Louisiana Gov. William Pitt Kellogg made his way to his carriage following a meeting in New Orleans, when a man named Charles R. Railey confronted him. Railey told him he was frustrated with how he had been governing, as Kellogg walked away.\n\nAs Kellogg’s carriage rounded the corner one shot rang out. He raised his hand to his neck as his driver raced them away, and though early reports said Kellogg had been shot in his neck and gravely wounded, it turned out that the bullet had just missed him.\n\nIt’s one of the many often forgotten events in US history that I learned about while working on an upcoming book “America’s Deadliest Election, A Cautionary Tale of the Most Violent Election in American History,” with my coauthor David Fisher.\n\nSince the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, many have rightly pointed to the sad, bloody history of violence against American political leaders – the murders of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy, and the attempted assassinations of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford.\n\nAmerica’s story is complicated, especially when it comes to passions about our leaders and what and whom they represent. And while violence should never be the answer, it has occurred more than any of us would want to admit.\n\nRead more about the history of violence in US politics here.\n\nThere are no plans to tighten security for RNC after Trump assassination attempt, Secret Service says\n\nThe Secret Service said Sunday that there are no plans to tighten its security arrangements for the Republican National Convention, which begins Monday in Milwaukee.\n\nIt was the first on-camera appearance of a Secret Service representative since the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump on Saturday. The agency has issued a series of statements following the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania, but did not appear during a law enforcement news conference there late Saturday.\n\nThe Sunday afternoon news conference on preparations for the RNC did not address the assassination attempt, but federal officials said there were no signs of increased danger at the convention following the shooting.\n\n“Currently there are no known articulated threats against the RNC or anyone visiting the RNC,” said Michael Hensle, the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Milwaukee.\n\nFirearms will be permitted in a “soft perimeter” around the Fiserv Forum, the venue where the convention will take place, and local officials said state law does not permit them to change those plans.\n\n“Wisconsin is an open-carry state, and therefore Milwaukee and no other jurisdiction in this state can supersede state law,” said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson.\n\nTrump is set to officially become the GOP nominee this week. Here's a recap of how we got here\n\nAn incumbent Democratic president seeking reelection coupled with the unusual circumstances of a defeated one-term president seeking another term set up the 2024 primaries as both unprecedented and uncompetitive.\n\nIn the end, both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump romped through the primaries — each clinching the nomination on March 12, just a week after Super Tuesday.\n\nWhile about a dozen Republicans sought to challenge Trump, there wasn’t much of a contest. That field spent most of 2023 competing amongst itself for who would emerge as the Trump alternative, while the former president largely didn’t engage — even choosing to skip debates.\n\nBy the Iowa caucuses, it was clear that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley were the only major candidates left to challenge Trump.\n\nAfter Trump won a historic victory in Iowa, beating both DeSantis and Haley by 30 percentage points, it became even more clear that despite his 2020 loss and the January 6 insurrection, Trump remained the favorite of the Republican base. Haley stuck around with a stronger anti-Trump message and won the District of Columbia and Vermont but dropped out of the race the day after Super Tuesday.\n\nRead about Trump’s campaign promises so far here.\n\nHere's what Trump said on stage in the seconds after shots were fired at Saturday's rally\n\nMoments after he was shot at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday afternoon, Donald Trump was seen with blood on his ear and cheek as he was rushed off the stage.\n\nAudio reveals how the chaotic shooting scene played out from the view of Trump and those involved in getting him to safety. Trump was in the middle of speaking when several shots rang out. He clasps his ear and ducks as Secret Service agents surround him. “Get down, get down, get down,” one says. Another shot sounds and a woman screams.\n\nSeveral voices of Secret Service agents are heard — one says “up!” another “stairs are ready, stairs are ready.” Trump can be heard as well but his words are indistinct. More agents go on stage, some holding assault rifles. Trump’s supporters in the background look shocked, while some film with their phones.\n\nAfter hearing that the shooter is down, Trump and the agents stand up. Here’s what was said:\n\nTrump: “Let me get my shoes, let me get my shoes.”\n\nMale agent: “I got you sir, I got you sir.”\n\nTrump: “Let me get my shoes.”\n\nAnother male agent: “Hold on, your head is bloody.”\n\nMale agent: “Sir, we’ve got to move to the car sir.”\n\nTrump: “Let me get my shoes.”\n\nFemale agent says, “OK,” before saying something about the shoe.\n\nTrump: “Wait, wait, wait.” He then fist pumps to the crowd. He mouths “fight” three times — a move met with cheers by the crowd.\n\nTrump and the Secret Service team move away from the podium and head to the cars as the crowd chants, “USA. USA. USA.”\n\nYou can watch video of the scene here, and read more details from the audio here.\n\nMinute by minute: Here's a visual timeline of the Trump assassination attempt\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was injured in a shooting during his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in what the FBI says was an assassination attempt on Saturday night. One rally attendee was killed and two others were seriously injured.\n\nThe rally marked Trump’s last public appearance before the scheduled start of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where the Republican Party is set to formally select him as its presidential nominee.\n\nThrough videos, maps and photos, CNN pieced together what occurred from the start of the rally to the chaotic moments when gunshots erupted to, ultimately, when Trump landed in Newark, New Jersey, early Sunday morning.\n\nView CNN’s timeline here.\n\nWhat to watch at the Republican National Convention\n\nThe Republican National Convention will now take place under the shadow of the attempt to assassinate Donald Trump on Saturday.\n\nIt’s unclear what effect the shooting will have on what had been expected to be a week of pomp and prime-time speeches designed to make the GOP’s best case for Trump and a Republican majority on Capitol Hill.\n\nHere’s what to watch:\n\nWhat will change because of the shooting? Many of the questions that predated the assassination attempt have largely faded into the background as Trump, President Joe Biden and their respective allies rush to adapt their campaigns to the new landscape.\n\nIt’s unclear how this contest has been altered, but what begins today with the delegate roll call and concludes Thursday night with the former president’s nomination acceptance speech, clearly marks the start of something new and fraught.\n\nTrump’s return to the stage and his rhetoric at the podium will set the tone both for the final months of the presidential campaign and the near-term future of US politics. He has, so far, been restrained in his response to the attempt on his life. Other members of his party have not, with some immediately suggesting – without evidence – that the alleged gunman was driven to act by heated campaign rhetoric.\n\nWho is the VP pick going to be? The decision has been made, Trump recently said. CNN previously reported that the Trump campaign viewed today as its deadline for naming a running mate. The potential for a made-for-TV unveiling is there – and it’s likely down to three people: North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. The timeline, though, could be thrown off by the attempt on Trump’s life.\n\nFamily reunion: In 2016, Trump’s children all spoke to the convention and were viewed as bright-eyed validators for his candidacy. Four years later, they mostly took a more aggressive tone.\n\nThe public view of Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Tiffany Boulos (née Trump) has changed over the past eight years. Trump’s eldest sons have emerged as vocal supporters of his right-wing politics. His daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, is now the co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Both Ivanka and Tiffany are expected to be in Milwaukee.\n\nAs will former first lady Melania Trump, though it is unclear whether she will speak.\n\nHere’s what else to watch.\n\nWisconsin GOP chair says there are no \"major changes\" to RNC schedule and he's \"confident\" in security prep\n\nWisconsin Republican Party chairman Brian Schimming said Sunday that as of now, there are no major changes being made to the Republican National Convention schedule, including the expectation that former President Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick will speak on Wednesday, followed by Trump on Thursday.\n\nSchimming told reporters he spoke to RNC chairman Michael Whatley earlier in the day and “everything for the convention is going on as planned.”\n\n“We have dozens and dozens of speakers that will be speaking not only to the folks here, but to people across the nation and across the world about what Donald Trump’s gonna bring to this country. We want to make America great again, and the way to do it is to have a unified convention here in Milwaukee,” he continued.\n\nThough Trump has “obviously been through a lot in the last 24 hours,” Schimming said, based on his understanding, Trump is “doing well” and his thoughts are focused on the victims of the shooting.\n\nHe said he’s not anticipating any “major changes” to the existing security plan, adding “if they were to make any changes, there would be a reason for it, but we don’t see any reason for it right now.”\n\nSchimming told CNN that support from Trump in Wisconsin, a state he lost by just more than 20,000 votes in 2020, is “very, very strong” and said the former president demonstrated leadership amid tragedy on Saturday.\n\nTrump's former GOP primary rivals, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, will speak at convention\n\nFormer GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley will speak at the Republican National Convention this week, according to two sources. Haley was Trump’s chief rival in the GOP primary contests.\n\nCNN reported last week that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, another one of Trump’s primary rivals, will also speak at the convention.\n\nTrump and DeSantis, who fiercely attacked one another during the GOP presidential primary, have made an effort to put their personal history behind them in recent months.\n\nDeSantis, who ended his presidential campaign in January and immediately endorsed Trump, met with the former president in Florida in April and told donors and supporters he would help fundraise for Trump.\n\nRead more about the decision behind inviting DeSantis to speak.\n\nDelegates will also conduct other party business at this week's Republican National Convention\n\nDelegates to the Republican National Convention will choose the GOP’s official nominee for president this week in Milwaukee, but they will also conduct other party business.\n\nThe Republican delegates are divided into several convention committees: credentials, rules, platform and permanent organization.\n\nCredentials: This committee is responsible for making sure that the delegates who attend the committee are qualified under party rules to serve. In modern conventions, this committee’s work is usually non-controversial and conducted before the convention actually begins.\n\nRules: The Rules Committee is responsible for reviewing and proposing changes to the official rules that govern the national party. These rules cover everything from how the primary calendar is structured to how delegates are allocated to candidates in a primary. The committee also determines the rules that govern the convention itself. The committee meets in the week leading up to the GOP convention and must come up with a package of rules to govern convention proceedings.\n\nPlatform: The Platform Committee is responsible for drafting the party’s declaration of core principles and beliefs and its official position on a number of issues and presenting it to the convention for approval. Aside from nominating the presidential ticket, this is the other principal function of a national party convention. The presidential nominee is not bound to the platform and often breaks from it on some issues.\n\nPermanent Organization: The Committee on Permanent Organization, which functions continuously between conventions, has as its primary role the selection of convention officers. The committee only exists as part of the GOP.\n\nTrump campaign says a teacher, a veteran and a rancher among those scheduled to speak at RNC\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Convention announced more people expected to speak at next week’s convention in Milwaukee.\n\nThe convention’s Committee on Arrangements released on Friday a list of “everyday Americans” slotted to give remarks.\n\nIncluded in the list of speakers are a teacher, a veteran, a rancher who has property on the US-Mexico border, a small business owner, the head golf professional at Trump International and the golf general manager at Trump National Doral, according to a statement.\n\nAlso scheduled to speak is a sibling of Rachel Morin who was allegedly murdered by a man who illegally crossed the border in 2023."
