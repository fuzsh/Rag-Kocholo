        "text": "The top 15 dark money groups examined by Issue One’s new “Dark Money Illuminated” report have been spending millions of dollars in our elections since Citizens United without publicly disclosing their donors. Dark money groups frequently operate as attack dogs during campaigns, criticizing candidates from the shadows. Dark money groups also often push the envelope in terms of how much political spending they can engage in without running afoul of rules that prohibit them from existing primarily to influence elections. By masquerading as a trade association or “social welfare” nonprofit, dark money groups avoid the mandatory donor disclosure rules that would come with registering as a political committee whose primary purpose is to influence elections.\n\nThe 45Committee\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe 45Committee raised $49 million between April 2015 and March 2017\n\nIssue One identified 3 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 2% of its funding.\n\nIssue One found 3 donors that gave any amount since April 2015:\n\nWellspring Committee: $750,000\n\nJudicial Crisis Network: $250,000\n\nEnding Spending: $75,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nThe 45Committee self-reported to the IRS that 47% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 85% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout the 45Committee\n\nBefore the GOP selected its presidential nominee in 2016, the 45Committee was founded in April 2015 as a “social welfare” organization under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the tax code to aid whomever that person would be. According to the Washington Post, this group is “primarily funded by casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and the family of TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts.” These contributions, however, have never been publicly disclosed.\n\nTax records indicate that at least 60 percent of the money the 45Committee raised during its first two years came from four unidentified donors — who each gave $7.5 million. Seven other unknown donors contributed at least $1 million to the 45Committee during this period.\n\nBrian Baker, a longtime political adviser to the Ricketts family, serves as the chairman and president of the 45Committee. Federal campaign finance records show that both the Adelson family and Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team, have also been major donors to the 45Committee’s sister super PAC, which is called Future45. Joe Ricketts’ son Todd Ricketts — who now serves as the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee — was, according to media reports, actively involved in raising funds for both groups ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nIn its second year of operation — a period that corresponded with the 2016 presidential election — nearly 48 percent of the 45Committee’s spending went toward “direct or indirect political campaign activities,” according to documents it filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The group has continued to spend money during the 2018 election cycle, typically aiding Republican candidates.\n\n60 Plus Association\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe 60 Plus Association raised $92 million between July 2009 and June 2017\n\nIssue One identified 29 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 51% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 13 donors that gave at least $100,000 since July 2009:\n\nAmerican Encore (formerly Center to Protect Patient Rights): $16 million\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce: $16 million\n\nAmerican Future Fund: $4.6 million\n\nTC4 Trust: $4.1 million\n\nConsumer Information Council: $1.9 million\n\nVote Alabama: $1 million\n\nFree Enterprise America: $840,000\n\nPeoples Alliance for Leadership: $630,000\n\nMobile Consumers for Choice and Competition (formerly Midwest Consumers for Choice and Competition): $250,000\n\nArizona Free Enterprise Club: $200,000\n\nNext Century Fund: $140,000\n\nCitizens for a Digital Future: $100,000\n\nPolicy and Taxation Group: $100,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nThe 60 Plus Association self-reported to the IRS that 10% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 72% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout the 60 Plus Association\n\nIncorporated in Virginia in August 1990 as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization, the 60 Plus Association markets itself as a conservative alternative to AARP. The group’s founder and longtime chairman is Jim Martin, a former journalist who served as the chief of staff to a Republican senator during the 1960s. Martin is also the man who is credited as popularizing the term “death tax” for the tax paid by the wealthiest Americans when they pass their estates onto their heirs. Singer Pat Boone, who rose to fame in the 1950s for his pop and gospel songs, serves as the 60 Plus Association’s national spokesman.\n\nWhen it applied for tax-exempt status, the 60 Plus Association told the Internal Revenue Service it planned to raise money from unspecified “individuals, corporations and foundations.”\n\nIn 2016, the Federal Election Commission levied a $50,000 fine against the 60 Plus Association for failing to disclose that a nonprofit known as the Center to Protect Patient Rights — a group associated with the political network of billionaires Charles and David Koch — was a donor behind some of its political expenditures in 2010. However, according to media reports, the 60 Plus Association only paid one-tenth of this fine — and decided to contest the remaining amount.\n\nIn 2014, a liberal watchdog group asked the IRS to determine whether the 60 Plus Association had violated federal law “by intentionally failing to disclose” millions of dollars in spending on political activities in 2010 and 2012. An Issue One review of federal records shows that the 60 Plus Association told the FEC that it spent at least $2.3 million more expressly advocating for the election or defeat of candidates between July 2009 and June 2017 than the group told the IRS it spent on “direct or indirect political campaign activities” during the same period.\n\nAmerican Action Network\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe American Action Network raised $170 million between July 2009 and June 2017\n\nIssue One identified 23 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 13% of its funding.\n\nIssue One found 13 donors that gave at least $100,000 since July 2009:\n\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA): $12 million\n\nRepublican Jewish Coalition: $4 million\n\nAetna Inc.: $3.3 million\n\nCrossroads GPS: $500,000\n\nWellspring Committee: $310,000\n\nAlliance for Quality Nursing Home Care: $250,000\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute: $250,000\n\nBoeing Co. PAC: $250,000\n\nDow Chemical Co.: $250,000\n\nAssociation of American Railroads: $200,000\n\nFWD.us: $150,000\n\nOnline Consumers Network: $100,000\n\nThe Annual Fund: $100,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nThe American Action Network self-reported to the IRS that 32% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 93% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout American Action Network\n\nIncorporated in Delaware in July 2009 as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization, the American Action Network was not publicly rolled out by high-profile Republicans until February 2010 — one month after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.\n\nThe self-described “action tank” was founded by veteran Republican fundraiser Fred Malek, the former Marriott Hotels president and CEO who has helped raise campaign cash for a number of GOP presidential candidates over the years.\n\nFormer Republican Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota served as the American Action Network’s first CEO and is still the chairman of the organization’s board of directors.\n\nBrian Walsh — the former political director for the National Republican Congressional Committee who helped Republicans win control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010 — served as the president of the American Action Network between 2011 and 2015.\n\nThe group’s current executive director is Corry Bliss, who managed Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman’s successful re-election campaign in 2016.\n\nWhen it applied for tax-exempt status, the American Action Network told the Internal Revenue Service that only a “minor portion” of its activities would likely be classified as political campaign intervention — likely no more than 20 percent. Yet in the wake of Citizens United, the American Action Network emerged as a major political player, spending nearly 40 percent of its funds on “direct or indirect political campaign activities” in some years.\n\nIn June 2014, the Federal Election Commission deadlocked 3-3 in response to a complaint about whether the American Action Network should have registered as a political committee, which would have required the group to disclose its donors. The FEC again deadlocked 3-3 on the same question in October 2016, after a federal judge ordered the agency to reevaluate its decision.\n\nAmericans for Job Security\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nAmericans for Job Security $68 million between November 2009 and October 2014\n\nIssue One identified 80 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 55% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 10 donors that gave at least $1 million since November 2009:\n\nCharles Schwab: $6.7 million\n\nJohn Fisher: $5 million\n\nAmerican Encore (formerly Center to Protect Patient Rights): $4.9 million\n\nCrossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies (Crossroads GPS): $2 million\n\nDoris Fisher: $2 million\n\nWilliam Fisher: $2 million\n\nRetail Industry Leaders Association: $1.5 million\n\nInvolve America: $1.4 million\n\nEli Broad: $1 million\n\nRobert Fisher: $1 million\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nAmericans for Job Security self-reported to the IRS that 31% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 98% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout Americans for Job Security\n\nFormed in November 1997 as a 501(c)(6) trade association, Americans for Job Security ranks among the earliest political dark money groups. In recent years, however, the group has all but vanished. Stephen DeMaura, a former executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Party, served as Americans for Job Security’s president for nearly a decade, beginning in 2008. The group was founded by political operatives David Carney and Michael Dubke, who briefly served as communications director for President Donald Trump in the White House last year.\n\nIn addition to its own political spending, which has typically aided Republican candidates, Americans for Job Security also played a prominent role in funneling tens of millions of dollars to two ballot measure fights in California during the 2012 election. The California Fair Political Practices Commission later concluded this effort was designed to hide the identities of the actual donors supporting the ballot measures. As part of its investigation, the commission released a poorly redacted list of Americans for Job Security’s donors in 2012, which led media organizations and others to identify many of the group’s donors that year.\n\nIn June 2014, the Federal Election Commission deadlocked 3-3 in response to a complaint about whether Americans for Job Security should have registered as a political committee, which would have required the group to disclose its donors.\n\nIn July 2016, the FEC fined Americans for Job Security $43,000 after the agency concluded that the group should have disclosed a nonprofit known as the Center to Protect Patient Rights — a group associated with the political network of billionaires Charles and David Koch — as a donor behind some of its political expenditures in 2010.\n\nIn March 2018, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of Americans for Job Security after the group failed to file mandatory tax returns for three consecutive years. According to its most recent tax return, Americans for Job Security had about $620,000 in the bank as of October 2014. Beyond paying the FEC fine in 2016, it’s unclear how that money has been spent.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nAmericans for Prosperity raised $398 million between January 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 29 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 39% of its funding.\n\nIssue One found 9 donors that gave at least $100,000 since January 2010:\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce: $140 million\n\nAmerican Encore (formerly Center to Protect Patient Rights): $14 million\n\nTC4 Trust: $1.4 million\n\nAlliance for a Free Society: $430,000\n\nNCTA – The Internet and Television Association (formerly the National Cable and Telecommunications Association): $240,000\n\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA): $190,000\n\nCornerstone Policy Research Action (CPR Action): $150,000\n\nEducation Freedom Alliance: $120,000\n\nAmerican Energy Alliance: $100,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity self-reported to the IRS that 14% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities\n\nIt also told the FEC that 100% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout Americans for Prosperity\n\nFounded in March 2004 as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization, Americans for Prosperity is the flagship of the political network of billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch, the latter of whom was the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nominee in 1980. Americans for Prosperity grew out of another group formed by the Koch brothers, Citizens for a Sound Economy, which split due to internal disagreements.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, Americans for Prosperity was deeply involved in mobilizing voters and helping elect the wave of tea party-aligned Republicans that helped the GOP win 63 seats and control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010. Americans for Prosperity currently operates a national office as well as chapters in 36 states to promote its vision for “economic freedom.”\n\nBased on its vast resources and infrastructure, the Washington Post once referred to Americans for Prosperity as “America’s third-biggest political party.” The group hosts semi-annual, invitation-only summits for conservative political donors, which are often attended by lawmakers and candidates.\n\nTim Phillips, a veteran political strategist who once served as the chief of staff to Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), has been the president of Americans for Prosperity since 2006. In 2017, Emily Seidel, a strategist in the Koch network for years, was appointed as Americans for Prosperity’s CEO.\n\nMuch of the money known to have funded Americans for Prosperity has come from three groups that have acted as financial hubs for the Koch brothers’ political network over the years: the Freedom Partners Chambers of Commerce, TC4 Trust and the Center to Protect Patient Rights (now known as American Encore), each of which has made large grants to Americans for Prosperity, as well as a number of other politically active nonprofit groups.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform raised $67 million between January 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 23 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 58% of its funding.\n\nIssue One found 11 donors that gave at least $100,000 since January 2010:\n\nCrossroads GPS: $30 million\n\nAmerican Encore (formerly Center to Protect Patient Rights): $4.5 million\n\nFree Enterprise America: $810,000\n\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA): $730,000\n\nMotion Picture Association of America (MPAA): $600,000\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute: $380,000\n\nNCTA – The Internet and Television Association (formerly the National Cable and Telecommunications Association): $300,000\n\nReynolds American Inc.: $280,000\n\nACTwireless (formerly MyWireless.org): $170,000\n\nEdison Electric Institute: $160,000\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce: $100,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform self-reported to the IRS that 19% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 91% of its political spending was negative\n\nAbout Americans for Tax Reform\n\nOriginally founded in July 1985 to promote President Ronald Reagan’s proposal for tax reform, Americans for Tax Reform remains a powerful lobbying organization today that also frequently spends money in elections to aid Republican candidates. The group’s founder and president is Grover Norquist, a conservative activist who once boasted that his goal was to get government “down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.”\n\nIn 1994, Norquist was one of the co-authors of the “Contract with America,” the campaign platform that helped the GOP win control of the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in more than forty years and helped elevate Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-GA), another co-author, to the position of Speaker of the House.\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform’s primary advocacy tool is its “Taxpayer Protection Pledge,” which asks politicians at the local, state and national level to “make a written commitment to oppose any and all tax increases.”\n\nAmericans for Tax Reform, which is organized as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization, says that nearly 1,400 elected officials nationwide, at all levels of government, have signed its anti-tax pledge. Currently, 46 out of the 51 sitting Senate Republicans are signatories to the pledge, as are nearly 90 percent of the 235 House Republicans.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, a liberal watchdog group twice asked the Internal Revenue Service to investigate whether Americans for Tax Reform had violated federal law by failing to disclose millions of dollars in spending on political activities in 2010 and 2012. An Issue One review of federal records shows that Americans for Tax Reform told the FEC that it spent at least $8 million more expressly advocating for the election or defeat of federal candidates during those two election years than the group told the IRS it spent on “direct or indirect political campaign activities.”\n\nAmerican Future Fund\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe American Future Fund raised $137 million between January 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 27 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 64% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 7 donors that gave at least $1 million since January 2010:\n\nAmerican Encore (formerly Center to Protect Patient Rights): $62 million\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce: $14 million\n\nAmerican Justice Partnership: $2.5 million\n\nJudicial Crisis Network: $2.1 million\n\nWellspring Committee: $2.1 million\n\nCrossroads GPS: $2 million\n\nConservative Solutions Project: $1 million\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nThe American Future Fund self-reported to the IRS that 38% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 68% of its political spending was negative\n\nAbout American Future Fund\n\nThe American Future Fund, which frequently spends money in elections to aid Republican candidates, was founded in Iowa in August 2007 as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization by GOP political operative Nick Ryan. Sandy Greiner, a former Republican state legislator from Iowa, served as its president from 2009 through early 2016. Allison Kleis, a Republican political consultant who works with Ryan at the Iowa-based Concordia Group, now serves in that role.\n\nWhen the American Future Fund applied for tax-exempt status in 2008, it told the Internal Revenue Service that it did not plan to spend money on elections. That changed after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision in 2010, and the group has now spent tens of millions of dollars on ads that have expressly advocated for the election or defeat of federal candidates. The American Future Fund’s spending on “direct or indirect political campaign activities” typically spikes in election years — accounting for approximately 38 percent to 46 percent of its spending in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016, according to documents the group filed with the IRS. In non-election years, that percentage has been nearly zero.\n\nFor a period, the American Future Fund was a major player in the political network of billionaires Charles and David Koch, but following the 2012 election, it was reportedly exiled from the Koch network for its role in a scheme that regulators said was designed to conceal the identities of donors to two ballot initiative campaigns in California.\n\nIn November 2014, the Federal Election Commission deadlocked 3-2 in response to a complaint about whether the American Future Fund should have registered as a political committee, which would have required the group to disclose its donors. (Four affirmative votes are needed for the FEC to take action.)\n\nDespite the fact that it has never disclosed its donors, influential Iowa businessman Bruce Rastetter — the co-founder and CEO of Hawkeye Energy Holdings, a large ethanol company — reportedly provided “seed money” to the American Future Fund.\n\nCrossroads GPS\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nCrossroads GPS raised $349 million between June 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 10 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 2% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 7 donors that gave at least $100,000 since June 2010:\n\nRepublican Jewish Coalition: $4 million\n\nAlliance for Quality Nursing Home Care: $500,000\n\nAmerican Health Care Association: $450,000\n\nKentucky Opportunity Coalition: $350,000\n\nMain Street Advocacy Fund: $150,000\n\nProperty Casualty Insurers Association of America: $150,000\n\nAGC Construction Advocacy Fund (formerly AGC Public Awareness and Advocacy Fund): $100,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nCrossroads GPS self-reported to the IRS that 34% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 92% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout Crossroads GPS\n\nCrossroads GPS (also known as Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies) was conceived in the months following the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision by Republican operatives including GOP strategist Karl Rove, a former senior advisor to President George W. Bush. It quickly became one of the best-known political dark money groups of the post-Citizens United era.\n\nAccording to documents the group — which is organized as a “social welfare” nonprofit under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the tax code — filed with the Internal Revenue Service, its political spending typically spikes in election years. In the years featuring the 2010, 2012 and 2014 elections, for example, nearly 40 percent of Crossroads GPS’ spending went toward “direct or indirect political campaign activities.” In non-election years, that percentage has frequently been zero.\n\nIn October 2010, good-government groups urged the IRS to “investigate whether Crossroads GPS has a primary purpose of ‘participation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to’ candidates for public office.”\n\nIn December 2013, the Federal Election Commission deadlocked 3-3 in response to a complaint about whether Crossroads GPS should have registered as a political committee, which would have required the group to disclose its donors.\n\nCrossroads GPS was also the subject of a nearly five-and-a-half-year investigation by the IRS into whether its substantial political spending disqualified it from tax-exemption under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code. In September 2013, the IRS was prepared to rule against the group, but Crossroads GPS’ lawyers fought back. And in November 2015, the IRS retroactively granted Crossroads GPS tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, allowing the group to keep its donors secret.\n\nCrossroads GPS was spun off from its sister super PAC, known as American Crossroads, which was also formed in 2010. Carl Forti, a political consultant and Rove protégé who served as Crossroads GPS’ political director, once acknowledged that donors appreciated the anonymity afforded by Crossroads GPS’ tax status. “Some donors didn’t want to be disclosed,” he said at a conference in 2010. “They were more comfortable giving to a (c)(4), and so we created one.”\n\nWhen it applied for tax-exempt status, Crossroads GPS told the IRS it planned to raise money from “individuals, corporations and other organizations who support the mission of the organization.” To this day, nearly all of those donors remain anonymous, although Crossroads GPS has reportedly received substantial checks from Las Vegas casino magnates Steve Wynn and Sheldon Adelson.\n\nSteven Law is the president of Crossroads GPS. Law is a former executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and previously worked in senior roles at the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. In the 1990s, Law served as the chief of staff to Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY).\n\nLeague of Conservation Voters\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters raised $185 million between January 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 33 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 25% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 17 donors that gave at least $100,000 since January 2010:\n\nLeague of Conservation Voters Education Fund: $9.5 million\n\nThe Advocacy Fund: $8.9 million\n\nGreen Tech Action Fund: $8.4 million\n\nNEO Philanthropy Action Fund (formerly Public Interest Projects Action Fund): $5.8 million\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund: $5.5 million\n\nEnvironmental Defense Action Fund: $2.8 million\n\nPartnership Project Action Fund: $2.5 million\n\nPartnership Project: $2 million\n\nMajority Forward: $1.5 million\n\nPriorities USA: $650,000\n\nTides Foundation: $490,000\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Action Fund: $390,000\n\nAmerica Votes: $310,000\n\nNextGen Climate Action: $260,000\n\nRockefeller Philanthropy Advisors: $210,000\n\nNEO Philanthropy: $140,000\n\nRockefeller Family Fund: $130,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters self-reported to the IRS that 31% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities\n\nIt also told the FEC that 58% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout the League of Conservation Voters\n\nEstablished in 1969 by environmentalist David Brower, the League of Conservation Voters is an advocacy organization that works to elect pro-environment candidates who are typically Democrats. Boasting more than 2 million members across the country, the League of Conservation Voters claims on its website that it has “helped elect or re-elect 73 U.S. senators and 330 members of the U.S. House of Representatives” since 1994.\n\nGene Karpinski, a former executive director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, has served as the president of the League of Conservation Voters since 2006. Since 1970, the League of Conservation Voters has published a scorecard that assesses politicians on environmental issues. According to documents the group filed with the Internal Revenue Service, its spending on “direct or indirect political campaign activities” typically spikes in election years — exceeding 41 percent, for instance, in 2012 when the group endorsed President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign, among other candidates.\n\nOrganized as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization, the League of Conservation Voters is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and also works with affiliates in 31 states. In addition to its main 501(c)(4) arm, the League of Conservation Voters also operates a traditional political action committee that makes donations to candidates, a super PAC that sponsors political advertisements and a 501(c)(3) charity arm that seeks to increase voter participate and educate the public and elected officials about key environmental issues.\n\nNational Association of Realtors\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe National Association of Realtors raised $1.3 billion between January 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 0 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 0% of its funding\n\nAccording to its filings with the IRS, the National Association of Realtors has not received any contributions or grants since January 2010. The bulk of its funding comes from membership dues, program services and investments.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors self-reported to the IRS that 4% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nAtypically for a dark money group, the National Association of Realtors told the FEC that 100% of its political spending was positive.\n\nAbout the National Association of Realtors\n\nFormed in May 1908, the National Association of Realtors touts itself as the largest trade association in the country, representing more than 1.3 million members in all 50 states as well as Washington, D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The group strives to be “the leading advocate of the right to own, use and transfer real property” and to help its members “become more profitable and successful.”\n\nSince August 2017, Bob Goldberg, a 23-year veteran of the National Association of Realtors, has served as the trade association’s CEO. The group’s current president is Elizabeth Mendenhall, a realtor from Columbia, Missouri.\n\nWhile the National Association of Realtors does regularly communicate with its members about political candidates, that’s not the primary reason why the trade association ranks among the top dark money groups since Citizens United. In September 2010, the 501(c)(6) trade association formed the National Association of Realtors Congressional Fund, a super PAC that has been primarily funded by the National Associations of Realtors itself.\n\nIn fact, roughly 95 percent of the $26 million raised by this super PAC between 2010 and 2016 came from the National Association of Realtors’ own coffers. (Campaign finance records show other large donors to the Realtors’ super PAC include electronic lockbox manufacturer Sentrilock LLC and the Center for Specialized Realtor Education, a subsidiary of the National Association of Realtors that provides trainings and educational services.)\n\nAnd who funds the National Association of Realtors? According to the group’s tax filings, the trade association does not receive grants or contributions from other individuals or organizations. These forms show that the bulk of the money the National Association of Realtors collects is from membership dues, although some additional revenue comes from program services and investments. According to the National Association of Realtors’ website, its dues are currently $120 per person per year.\n\nNotably, unlike most other super PACs, fully 100 percent of the spending by the National Association of Realtors Congressional Fund has been positive, touting a mix of Democratic and Republican candidates to the general public.\n\nIn addition to advocating for policies in Washington that foster homeownership, the National Association of Realtors is also active in policy debates ranging from the National Flood Insurance Program to infrastructure spending to net neutrality.\n\nNote: According to its filings with the IRS, the National Association of Realtors has not received any contributions or grants since January 2010. The bulk of its receipts come from membership dues, program services and investments.\n\nNational Rifle Association\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe National Rifle Association raised $2.1 billion between January 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 37 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 7% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 17 donors that gave at least $100,000 since January 2010:\n\nNRA Foundation: $110 million\n\nSturm, Ruger & Co., Inc.: $12 million\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce: $8.4 million\n\nAmerican Encore (formerly Center to Protect Patient Rights): $3.2 million\n\nAmerican Future Fund: $3 million\n\nAmerican Action Network: $2.7 million\n\nMidwayUSA and its owners Larry and Brenda Potterfield: $2.1 million\n\nSmith & Wesson Corp.: $1.6 million\n\nJudicial Crisis Network: $1 million\n\nPierce Bullet Seal Target Systems: $1 million\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nThe National Rifle Association self-reported to the IRS that 2% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities.\n\nIt also told the FEC that 64% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout the National Rifle Association\n\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) was founded in 1871 by two former Union Army Civil War officers to promote marksmanship. Since then, the NRA has evolved into one of the most powerful political and lobbying forces in Washington, typically backing Republican candidates, although it occasionally supports gun-friendly Democrats as well. The organization, which is organized as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization, now touts itself as “America’s foremost defender of Second Amendment rights” and claims more than 5 million members across the country.\n\nThe NRA’s funding comes from a combination of membership dues and contributions from other sources, including gun manufacturers and executives at gun-manufacturing companies. Donors who give $1 million or more to any of the NRA’s 501(c)(4) or 501(c)(3) arms over their lifetimes are recognized as members of the “Golden Ring of Freedom.”\n\nThe NRA itself says that “gifts from companies and executives in the firearms, hunting and shooting sports industries typically comprise less than 5 percent of the NRA’s contribution revenue every year.” The organization has told the Internal Revenue Service that the “vast majority of contributions” it receives are from millions of small-dollar individual donors. Its tax returns show that membership dues, which start at $30 a year, typically comprise 40 percent to 50 percent of the NRA’s annual revenue.\n\nEarlier this year, the NRA acknowledged that it accepts contributions from “foreign individuals and entities” but said these funds have never been used to fund its electoral activities.\n\nThe National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA), which was established in 1975, acts as the group’s primary political and legislative vehicle within the NRA’s main 501(c)(4) operation. The executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action is Chris W. Cox, who served as a senior legislative aide in Congress prior to joining the NRA.\n\nMeanwhile, the NRA’s longtime leader is Wayne LaPierre, whose official title is executive vice president and CEO, and the NRA’s president, as of earlier this year, is retired Marine Corps Lt. Colonel Oliver North, who worked for President Ronald Reagan’s National Security Council and became well-known in the 1980s for his role in the Iran-Contra scandal.\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, a liberal watchdog group twice asked the Internal Revenue Service to investigate whether the NRA had violated federal law by failing to disclose millions of dollars in spending on political activities between 2008 and 2014. In 2012 alone, records show that the NRA told the Federal Election Commission that it spent more than $7 million expressly advocating for the election or defeat of federal candidates, while the group told the IRS it spent no money on “direct or indirect political campaign activities on behalf of or in opposition to candidates.” The NRA has asserted that the numbers it reports to the IRS are “not necessarily expected to tie to [FEC] reporting due to different definitions and exclusions in the different regulatory regimes.” Nevertheless, these stark differences have raised eyebrows among watchdog groups and journalists.\n\nPatriot Majority USA\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nPatriot Majority USA raised $66 million between March 2011 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 20 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 14% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 12 donors that gave at least $100,000 since March 2011:\n\nNational Education Association (NEA): $1.8 million\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME): $1.7 million\n\nAlliance for Quality Nursing Home Care: $1.3 million\n\nService Employees International Union (SEIU): $860,000\n\nFair Share: $850,000\n\nSixteen Thirty Fund: $660,000\n\nPartnership for Quality Home Healthcare: $500,000\n\nAmerican Health Care Association: $480,000\n\nAmerica Votes: $410,000\n\nNEO Philanthropy Action Fund (formerly Public Interest Projects Action Fund): $300,000\n\nSEIU Pennsylvania State Council: $280,000\n\nInternational Association of Firefighters: $100,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures.

To wit: Varoga led an independent group that helped Reid win his contentious re-election race in 2010. Varoga has long been adamant that Democrats should not “unilaterally disarm” when it comes to campaigning in the post-Citizens United era. “It does not matter whether any of us agree or disagree with current campaign finance laws, or court interpretations and FEC rulings on these laws,” Varoga wrote in Campaigns & Elections magazine in 2012. “This brave new world is here.”\n\nWhen Patriot Majority USA applied for tax-exempt status in 2011, it told the Internal Revenue Service that it planned to raise money from “individuals, corporations, partnerships, unions and other organizations.” Patriot Majority USA acknowledged to the IRS that it planned to spend money influencing elections — but stressed that it would not spend more than 40 percent of its money on such overt, electoral activities. According to its own tax filings, Patriot Majority USA has typically spent between 30 percent and 40 percent of its funds each year on “direct or indirect political campaign activities.”\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe Planned Parenthood Action Fund raised $179 million between July 2009 and June 2017\n\nIssue One identified 32 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 35% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 16 donors that gave at least $100,000 since July 2009:\n\nPlanned Parenthood Federation of America: $29 million\n\nSusan Thompson Buffett Foundation: $26 million\n\nPriorities USA: $2.3 million\n\nOpen Society Policy Center: $1.5 million\n\nAmerican Bridge 21st Century: $500,000\n\nBerger Action Fund: $500,000\n\nAmerica Votes: $480,000\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME): $450,000\n\nAtlantic Advocacy Fund: $400,000\n\nNextGen Climate Action Committee: $320,000\n\nAmerica Votes Action Fund: $300,000\n\nRockefeller Philanthropy Advisors: $300,000\n\nNEO Philanthropy: $290,000\n\nTides Foundation: $270,000\n\nThe Advocacy Fund: $170,000\n\nNEO Philanthropy Action Fund (formerly Public Interest Projects Action Fund): $100,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures.

The organization says that one in five American women have chosen Planned Parenthood for health care services at least once in their lives.\n\nFor its part, the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which operates as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization, aims to help elect politicians who support reproductive rights and to thwart anti-abortion politicians. This means it typically spends money in elections to aid Democratic candidates. It also works to educate the public and register voters. The group says it is backed by more than 10 million “activists, donors and other supporters.”\n\nIn April, Cecile Richards, who had served as the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund since 2006, stepped down from these roles. As of today, her replacement has not yet been announced.\n\nIn addition to its 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) arms, Planned Parenthood also has a traditional political action committee that makes donations to candidates and a super PAC that makes independent expenditures to aid its preferred candidates.\n\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce raised $1.3 billion between January 2010 and December 2016\n\nIssue One identified 127 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 7% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 20 donors that gave at least $1 million since January 2010:\n\nDow Chemical Co.: $13 million\n\nFreedom Partners Chamber of Commerce: $5.5 million\n\nAetna Inc.: $5.3 million\n\nCrossroads GPS: $5.3 million\n\nChevron Corp.: $4.5 million\n\nMerck & Co., Inc.: $4.4 million\n\nMicrosoft Corp.: $2.8 million\n\nQualcomm Inc.: $2.7 million\n\nPrudential Financial, Inc.: $2.3 million\n\nAmerican Electric Power Company, Inc.: $2.1 million\n\nAnthem, Inc.

The group says it represents more than 3 million businesses across the country and has a membership of approximately 300,000.\n\nWhile the U.S. Chamber of Commerce does not disclose its donors, nearly 100 blue-chip companies have voluntarily disclosed their own dues payments to the trade association, according to research by Issue One.\n\nThomas Donohue, the former president and CEO of the American Trucking Associations, has served as the president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce since 1997.\n\nDonohue — along with the heads of the Business Roundtable and National Association of Manufacturers — has urged companies to reject calls for additional transparency measures about their political spending, criticizing such efforts as plots to “name-and-shame” companies “into either curtailing or eliminating their involvement in public policy debates.”\n\nVoteVets Action Fund\n\nHere’s what Issue One’s year-long “Dark Money Illuminated” investigation revealed:\n\nThe VoteVets Action Fund raised $46 million between July 2009 and June 2017\n\nIssue One identified 42 donors to this dark money group\n\nThese donors collectively accounted for 33% of its funding\n\nIssue One found 12 donors that gave at least $500,000 since July 2009:\n\nAlliance for Climate Protection: $2.6 million\n\nFuels America: $1.4 million\n\nPartnership Project Action Fund: $1.4 million\n\nAmerican Federation of Government Employees: $1.2 million\n\nUnited Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry: $920,000\n\nAmerica Votes: $860,000\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME): $780,000\n\nPatriot Majority USA (formerly American Alliance for Economic Development): $750,000\n\nSierra Club: $670,000\n\nInternational Union of Operating Engineers: $650,000\n\nNatural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) Action Fund: $500,000\n\nUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America: $500,000\n\nNote: These numbers have been rounded to two significant figures. Click here to see more details about these contributions — and all identified donors to this group — in Issue One’s exclusive database of dark money donors, and click here to learn more about how these contributors were identified.\n\nThe VoteVets Action Fund self-reported to the IRS that 29% of its total spending was related to political campaign activities\n\nIt also told the FEC that 58% of its political spending was negative.\n\nAbout the VoteVets Action Fund\n\nThe VoteVets Action Fund, which often spends money in elections to aid Democratic candidates, has described itself as the “largest progressive organization of veterans in the United States.” It claims more than 500,000 supporters across the country.\n\nThe group was founded in August 2006 as a 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization by Jon Soltz and Jeremy Broussard, both Iraq War veterans who had grown disillusioned with President George W. Bush’s handling of the war. Broussard was only briefly involved with the group, while Soltz continues to serve as the group’s chairman. The group’s initial board of advisors included retired four-star Army General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO, among other Democrats with strong national security credentials.\n\nAccording to documents that the VoteVets Action Fund has filed with the Internal Revenue Service, its spending on “direct or indirect political campaign activities” typically spikes in election years — exceeding 48 percent, for instance, amid the 2010 election and exceeding 52 percent amid the 2012 election.\n\nAccording to a memo authored by an attorney for the VoteVets Action Fund, the group’s policy is to collect contributions from “individuals, corporations and labor unions.” An Issue One review of documents filed by unions with the Labor Department indicates that labor unions accounted for about $1 of every $8 the VoteVets Action Fund raised between July 2009 and June 2017.\n\nThe VoteVets Action Fund is affiliated with a political action committee known as VoteVets, which operates as a hybrid super PAC. This status means the PAC can donate to political candidates from one bank account funded by limited contributions and can also make independent expenditures to aid candidates from a separate bank account funded by unlimited contributions."
