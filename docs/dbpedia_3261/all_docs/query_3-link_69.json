        "text": "Assistant Chief David P. “Davey” Fischer, 43, tragically passed away doing what he loved most, being a fireman, on Friday, September 7, 2018, at the scene of a house fire.\n\nDave was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Paul and Robyn Fischer. At 18 months, Dave began his journey of military moves that started in Germany and ended in Sturgis, South Dakota.\n\nDave attended Sturgis schools and was an active member in track and cross country. He still holds a record with the Sturgis Middle School for the two-mile run, which his children, nieces, and nephews all have tried to break.\n\nDave was a member of the South Dakota National Guard for 23 years, which began with basic training between his junior and senior year of high school. At the time of his death, he was a member of the 82nd Civil Support Team.\n\nHe was a member of the Sturgis Volunteer Fire Department and Ambulance for 22 years. He got his firefighting certification at age 21 and was serving as assistant fire chief at the time of his death. He put his heart and soul into firefighting and was always on scene, day or night. In addition, Dave worked as an EMT with the Sturgis Ambulance alongside his wife, Shawn, and son, Parker. Dave received many awards and certifications throughout the years for his dedication to his firefighting career and will be remembered for being there for anyone in need.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife of five years, Shawn; his seven children, Parker, Cayden (Chelsae), Bethany, Jace, Dawson, Steven, and Hunter; his mother, Robyn; two brothers, Tim (Keri) and Eric (Mikaela); one sister, Louise (PJ); and nine nieces and nephews. Dave also leaves behind his precious farm animals, including llama and alpacas, peacocks, sheep, and exotic chickens. One of Dave’s greatest enjoyments in life was caring for and showing off his little farm.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, Paul, and a son, Mason."
