        "text": "A few dozen settlers and teamsters were killed in the massacre along the Little Blue River in August 1864, but hundreds more fled their homes in terror. Â Republic County historian Isaac Savage turned the episode into a celebration of courage when he told how settlers in northern Kansas came out of hiding in Clay County and, emboldened by the rusty antiques distributed to them at Fort Riley, nervously marched north to repel the bloodthirsty horde from their homeland. Â Savage laid it on a bit thick in his 1883 âHistory of Republic County,â and may have been halfway jesting when he recounted the story of the Salt Creek Militia in an overblown heroic style that today sounds like a collegiate lampoon of Sir Walter Scott.\n\nLike many frontier militias in 1864, the Salt Creek crew poked about the countryside anxiously, found no foe keen for battle, heaved a sigh of relief and went home. Â If there had been warfare they all most likely would have been slaughtered, many of them killed by their own weapons. Â Isaac Savage described their armaments as âsome smooth bore, some rough bore, and some with scarcely any bore at allâ¦\"\n\nI read Ronald Becherâs âMassacre Along the Medicine Road,â a painstaking investigation into the attack along the Little Blue and its aftermath, to get a grasp of the buildup to the Plains Indian War. Â Since most of the action takes place in Nebraska, the turf was less familiar to me, as was the cast of characters. Â I was surprised to find one name I recognized in Becherâs story of the blind panic that overtook citizens of Beatrice, victims of a practical joker who whipped them into a frenzy of fear. Â With the help of an item printed in the August 18, 1872 edition of the Beatrice Express, Becher unveils the culprit behind the prank.\n\nKing David Fisher was the younger brother of White Rock pioneer and legendary fabulist Samuel Martin Fisher, who came to Republic County a few years before the Lovewells and Davises arrived, but was cheated out of permanent residency when he was bamboozled by loan sharks. Â King David stood out in a crowd not only because of his distinctive name, but because he supposedly stood 6â 6â tall. Â The word âsupposedlyâ comes up often in the King David Fisher narrative. Â He was supposedly a â49âer,â supposedly married his wife, the former Sophia Pritchard, near Louisville, Kentucky, and was supposedly the namesake of Kingfisher Creek which empties into the Cimarron, and Kingfisher County, northwest of Oklahoma City. Â These are only a few of the details of his oral history that are disputed by some family researchers.\n\nAccording to one account his son Isaac died at Little Big Horn, although Isaac seems to have fallen prey to an Indian attack in Nebraska much earlier, probably in 1867. Â At any rate, he is not listed as one of his fatherâs heirs after King David died at his farm southeast of Hebron, Nebraska, in 1871 at the age of 52. Â Predictably, there is an eerie tale surrounding his death, which King David had foretold two weeks prior to the event. Â A physician summoned after Fisher made his grim announcement could find nothing seriously wrong with him, though he died nonetheless, right on schedule. Â Other, less colorful stories classify his death as a conventional frontier event, following a bout of \"lung fever\" or typhoid.\n\nOne Fisher family story which at first seems better-grounded is that a few months after Samuel Martin Fisherâs wife Euphemia died in 1885, Samuel married his younger brotherâs widow Sophia. Â She is said to have given Samuel three more children before dying in 1887. Â A family history site reports that Sophia had married King David Fisher when she was 14 or 15 and was the mother of their 12 children, or, according to a 1959 newspaper story, their 13 or 14 children, or 7 boys and 2 girls. Â Since she would have been 60 when she married Samuel, it seems entirely plausible that she gave birth to 3 more children over the course of the next 15 months.\n\nAfter all, King David Fisherâs brother Samuel Martin Fisher was that legendary White Rock pioneer who once slew 11 out of 7 Indian attackers, letting 4 get away.
