        "text": "W. L. FAY, attorney at law, as one of the influential citizens of Lorain county, deserves a place in this volume.\n\nThe first of the FAY FAMILY to land in America was John Fay who came from England, A. D. 1656 in the good ship \"Speedwell,\" and settled in Massachusetts. From him descended in a direct line the subject of this sketch, as follows: John, Jr., James, Daniel, Aaron (great-grandfather, who married Rebecca Winslow), Lyman (grandfather, born in Vermont), Winslow (father), and Winslow Lamartine (subject), the eighth of his generation in America.\n\nDr. Lyman Fay (grandfather) came to Ohio in 1815, and soon after located at Milan, Erie county. He soon gained a wide reputation as a physician and business man. In addition to his professional labors he kept a drug and general store, a large grain warehouse, and was one of the promoters of the Milan Canal which, before the days of railroads, made Milan the principal grain market of northern Ohio. He accumulated a large property, and died of cholera Sept. 2, 1854. On July 21, 1816, he married Catherine Kellogg who survived him, dying Dec. 3, 1862.\n\nJoseph Brooks (maternal grandfather) came to Ohio from eastern New York at an early day; his wife was Rachel Barnum of Danbury, Conn., related to Phineas t. Barnum, the great showman.\n\nWINSLOW LAMARATINE FAY, the subject of this sketch, was born at Clarksfield, Huron Co., Ohio, Sept. 12, 1848, a son of Winslow and Mary Ann (Brooks) Fay,the former of whom was born Apr. 21, 1817, on the Huron river, at Avery, near Milan, Erie Co., Ohio, and died Aug. 4, 1884. He (the father) was the oldest of a family of ten children. He was a merchant during the greater part of his life, but during his later years was engaged in farming. He was married Jan. 6, 1839, to Mary Ann Brooks, who was born at Florence, Ohio, Dec. 30, 1818, and died May 4, 1878. The mother was educated at the seminary conducted by Dr. Monteith of Elyria, who at that early day was widely known as a successful and thorough instructor. W. L. was the second of three sons who grew to manhood. He received a liberal education at Oberlin College, and during his vacations taught school for a number of years in Huron and Lorain counties. When just past sixteen years of age, becoming dissatisfied with farm life, he asked the consent of his father to be allowed to start out and make his own way in the world; the consent was kindly granted, and without further aid, by perseverance and hard study and close application, he provided means to secure his own education, and obtain his profession. He read law with Hon. John C. Hale, then of Elyria, where he was admitted to the bar in 1870 under twenty-two years of age; for four years thereafter he practiced his profession with his preceptor, at the end of which time he opened an office on his own account. Up to 1879 he did a successful general practice; but close confinement to office and professional work seriously affecting his health, he gradually gave his attention to other matters less confining, until now his law practice occupies only a small portion of his time. He is the inventor of the Fay Sulky Scraper for moving earth, and was engaged in its manufacture for several years. Afterward he invented the Fairy Tricycle for ladies, girls and cripples, which he manufactured in lame numbers, and which have been sold extensively all over this country, and many shipped to foreign lands. He organized the Fay Manufacturing Co., and was principal owner of same until he sold his entire interest in December, 1891. A short time previous to this he bought the controlling interest in The Elyria Stone Co., which has extensive quarries at Grafton, Ohio, and he now holds the offices of secretary, treasurer and manager of said Company. Since his connection with this Company the plant has been greatly enlarged and improved, and the business very much increased. He is also engaged in the manufacture of Babbitt metal under the firm name and style of W. L. Fay & Co., which business he has conducted since 1876. He has also been engaged in farming all his life, he now owning an interest in a large grape farm on Avon Point, Lorain county; he also has vessel interests on the lakes, and has many other investments that require more or less time. In addition to his business Mr. Fay has found leisure to travel quite extensively, he having visited and traveled over the greater portions of this country, of interest, and a considerable part of Europe.\n\nMr. Fay was first united in marriage in May, 1878, to Emma A. Vincent, who died in June, 1879, leaving to his care an infant daughter - Mary Emma. He was married, the second time, in 1886, to Ophelia Goss Lawrence, a daughter of Rev. John Lawrence, of St. Johnsbury, Vt. His present wife was the fifth of a family of eight children, and was born at Wilton, Me., during her father's pastorate at that place. Her father, Rev. John Lawrence, is a direct descendant of John Lawrence, born at Wisset, England, in 1609, and who soon afterward came to this country and settled in Watertown, Mass. Her mother was Nancy Temple Wakefield, of Reading, Mass. By his second marriage Mr. Fay has four children: Lamartine Brooks, and Lawrence Temple (twins), Rachel Charlotte, and Florence.\n\nPolitically our subject is one of the stanchest Republicans, although he has never been an office seeker. He is a member of the Masonic Lodges of his place, and in this has followed in the line of his forefathers as far back as he has any record; is also a member of a number of other secret Societies. He is the examiner of the Savings Deposit Bank of Elyria; one of the directors, secretary and attorney for the Elyria Savings and Loan Co., of which he was one of the founders; is also director in a number of other enterprises of which he is a member. Whatever business he has undertaken, he has made a success of, and those that know him best are his best friends. Mr. Fay is a thorough believer in temperance, and at all times is ready and willing to lend his aid in anything that will help remove the curse of this evil from the land, although he does not follow all the ideas that are advocated by extremists in this direction; he is also a believer in the Gospel of Christ, but has never united with any Church. He is a stockholder in the Gospel News Co., of Cleveland, Ohio, publishers of the Gospel News, a weekly religious paper which was started for the purpose of furnishing Christian reading matter to the masses, at a low price.\n\nSource: Commemorative Biographical Record of the counties of Huron and Lorain, Ohio - Illustrated_ Publ.
