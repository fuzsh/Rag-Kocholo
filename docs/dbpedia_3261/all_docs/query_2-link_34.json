        "text": "DETROIT, March 3 - Max M. Fisher, the Detroit oil and real estate magnate known for his philanthropy and for the advice he gave Republican presidents on the Middle East and Jewish issues, died on Thursday at his home in Franklin, a Detroit suburb. He was 96.\n\nThe death was announced by David Techner, funeral director at the Ira Kaufman Chapel.\n\nMr. Fisher's fortune was estimated at $775 million last year in Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the nation's 400 wealthiest individuals.\n\nMr. Fisher was particularly active in Jewish affairs, orchestrating an international campaign of support for Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nRepublican presidents starting with Dwight D. Eisenhower sought his advice on Middle Eastern affairs and Jewish issues.\n\nFormer Gov. John Engler, a Republican, said on Thursday that Mr. Fisher wielded his greatest influence behind the scenes.\n\nIn \"Quiet Diplomat: A Biography of Max M. Fisher\" (Cornwall Books, 1992), Peter Golden described how President Gerald R. Ford and his secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, asked Mr. Fisher in 1975 to help heal a diplomatic rift between the United States and Israel over relations with Egypt.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
