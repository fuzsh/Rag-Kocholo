Racine today announced that Acting Deputy Attorney General of the Commercial Division David Fisher has been promoted to the deputy position in a permanent role.\n\n“David Fisher’s deep commitment and diligent work as the Acting Deputy General for the Commercial Division made the decision clear,” Attorney General Racine said. “David is a talented attorney with a wealth of experience and the trust and respect of his colleagues here at the Office of the Attorney General and throughout the city. We are fortunate that he will continue serving the people of the District of Columbia.”\n\nAs the leader of the Office of the Attorney General’s (OAG) Commercial Division, Fisher will direct work that serves 10 District government agencies through legal advice and transactional support on real-estate transactions, bond issuances and other work. The agencies include the Office of Contracting and Procurement, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Works, the Department of General Services, the Department of Housing and Community Development, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the Department of Small and Local Business Development.\n\nThe division is made of five sections:\n\nLand Acquisition & Bankruptcy Section: Acquires property for the use of the District public and represents the District’s interests in bankruptcy cases;\n\nLand Use & Public Works Section: Counsels on issues such as zoning, preservation, and public right-of-way;\n\nProcurement Section: Evaluates the proposed and approved contracting actions of the DC Council, counsels the District’s Chief Procurement Officer, and represents District agencies in cases brought to the Contract Appeals Board;\n\nReal Estate Transactions Section: Manages the logistical activities of District-owned lands, such as negotiating and drafting transactional documents; and\n\nTax & Finance Section: Provides legal advice to agencies on bonds, notes, and governmental project funding, as well as representing the District in tax sale foreclosure action suits in DC Superior Court.\n\n“It is an honor and a privilege to serve the first elected Attorney General of the District of Columbia as the Deputy for the Commercial Division,” said Fisher. “I look forward to assisting Attorney General Racine in achieving his goals of ensuring that the interests of the citizens of the District of Columbia are well protected and that all residents are treated equitably in their dealings with the District government.”\n\nFisher, a Ward 4 resident, has previously served as Assistant Deputy Attorney General for OAG’s Commercial Section; as Senior Attorney for the Office of the Solicitor at the U.S. Department of Interior, as Counsel for the Office of General Counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation; and as Chief of OAG’s Tax, Bankruptcy & Finance Section.\n\nFisher earned his bachelor’s in management engineering from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, his J.D. from the University of Connecticut School of Law and his master of laws in taxation from Georgetown University School of Law."
