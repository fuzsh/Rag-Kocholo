        "text": "CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Ohioans will soon voice who they want to represent their political party at the federal and state levels starting as early as Wednesday in the 2024 March Primary Election. During the primary, registered Democrats and Republicans will decide on several key entities, including the President of the United States.\n\nAs Wednesday rounds the corner, there are several key dates that voters or potential new voters need to know about before hitting the polls.\n\nImportant dates to remember\n\nFeb. 2: Military and Overseas Absentee Voting begins\n\nFeb. 20: Deadline to Register to Vote. Boards open until 9:00 p.m.\n\nFeb. 21: Absentee Voting by Mail begins (Ends March 18, postmark deadline)\n\nFeb. 21: Early In-Person Voting begins\n\nMarch 12: Absentee ballot applications must be received by your board of elections by 8:30 p.m.\n\nMarch 18: Mailed absentee ballots must be postmarked by this date.\n\nMarch 19: Primary Election Day\n\nMarch 23: Last day for board of elections to receive absentee ballots that have already been postmarked.\n\nTimes to vote early and in person\n\nFeb. 21-23: 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nFeb. 26 - March 1: 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nMarch 4-8: 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nMarch 9: 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.\n\nMarch 11: 7:30 a.m. - 7:30 p.m.\n\nMarch 12: 7:30 a.m. - 8:30 p.m.\n\nMarch 13-15: 7:30 a.m. - 7:30 p.m.\n\nMarch 16: 8:00 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.\n\nMarch 17: 1:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nCandidates on the ballot\n\nU.S. President\n\nThe presidential race is left with five candidates after a slew of politicians dropped out during the first few weeks of campaigning, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Cincinnati-native Vivek Ramaswamy. The five remaining candidates are former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R), former President Donald Trump (R), incumbent President Joe Biden (D), U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minnesota) and environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (I).\n\nKennedy will not be listed on the Primary ballot because he is running on an Independent ticket.\n\nRepublican CandidatesDemocratic CandidateNikki R. HaleyJoseph R. Biden (incumbent)Donald J. TrumpDean Phillips\n\nU.S. Senator\n\nThe U.S. Senate race may be one of the biggest elections for Ohio.\n\nIncumbent U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s (D) term ends at the beginning of 2025 and is up against three Republicans to keep his seat - a seat he has held since 2007.\n\nRegistered Republican voters will choose between State Sen. Matt Dolan (R-Cuyahoga), Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R), and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno.\n\nDolan has been a senator in the General Assembly since 2017 working to create tax breaks for families in his district and preserve Lake Erie. He currently serves as the Chair of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nBuilding most of his platform on honesty, LaRose has focused much of his efforts on fair elections, especially as the Secretary of State. If elected U.S. Senator, he says he plans to put veterans first, attempt to solve the housing shortage and lower America’s spending on healthcare.\n\nMoreno, on the other hand, has the least experience in politics of all of the candidates. However, he does have major GOP endorsements, such as Trump, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance (R) and U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R).\n\nIf elected, Moreno says he wants to empower parents to make educational choices for their children, restore election integrity and energy independence, hold big tech companies accountable, and more.\n\nOne thing all three of these candidates have in common? They want to enforce more border security to stop illegal immigration in the U.S.\n\nMoving onto the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Brown has been working with Congress to obtain federal money for Ohio throughout his terms in office. One of his most prominent projects as a U.S. Senator has been his advocacy for Amtrak passenger railway expansion, something he says is needed throughout the state.\n\nThe next senator’s term will begin in January 2025 and will work alongside Sen. Vance.\n\nRepublican CandidatesDemocratic CandidateMatt DolanSherrod Brown (incumbent)Frank LaRoseBernie Moreno\n\nJustice of the Supreme Court\n\nDemocrats are looking to flip the Ohio Supreme Court as three seats are currently up for grabs.\n\nHamilton County Common Pleas Court Judge Megan Shanahan (R) will run against Justice Michael Donnelly (D), who took office in January 2019, for a six-year term starting in January 2025.\n\nJustice Joe Deters (R) was a former Hamilton County Prosecutor until he was appointed to the State Supreme Court by Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine in January 2023. Now, Deters is gunning for Justice Melody Stewart’s (D) seat to serve a full term. Stewart was elected to the court in November 2018.\n\nRegistered Democrats will get to choose one of two candidates that will go head-to-head against Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Daniel Hawkins (R) in the 2024 November General Election.\n\nThe road is a familiar one for Ohio Tenth District Court of Appeals Judge Terri Jamison (D). In 2022, Judge Jamison ran against incumbent Justice Patrick Fischer and lost by 14 points. Now, she is trying again, but will first be up against Ohio Eighth District Court of Appeals Judge Lisa Forbes (D).\n\nFor nearly four decades, Republican Justices have held the majority in the Ohio Supreme Court. This year could be a turning point for Democrats, especially as talks continue about how the court should interpret the new abortion rights amendment.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateMegan E. ShanahanMichael P. Donnelly (incumbent)\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateJoseph T. DetersMelody J. Stewart (incumbent)\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidatesDaniel R. HawkinsLisa ForbesTerri Jamison\n\nHamilton County Ballot\n\nU.S. Representative - Congressional District 1\n\nIncumbent Rep. Greg Landsman (D), a former Cincinnati City Councilmember, is running again for his seat in Congress.\n\nLandsman took office after defeating long-time former U.S. Rep. Steve Chabot, who held the position from 2011-2023.\n\nIn his first two years in D.C., Landsman has focused on several bipartisan issues, such as funds to Ukraine, Israel, and Palestinian humanitarian aid and childcare legislation.\n\nFormer Hamilton County Asst. Prosecutor Orlando Sonza (R) will run against Landsman on a three-point platform. His goals are to reconstruct the economy, deter crime and illegal immigration and protect families with school choice and parental rights.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateOrlando SonzaGreg Landsman (incumbent)\n\nU.S. Representative - Congressional District 8\n\nThe race in Congressional District 8 has five candidates on the ballot this year in the Primary Election.\n\nU.S. Rep. Warren Davidson (R), who has been serving the district since 2016, is seeking reelection and will be up against former Butler County Auditor Kay Rogers.\n\nAccording to FOX19 NOW′s previous story, Rogers resigned in March 2008 after she pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to commit bank and mail fraud and filing a false income tax return. She was sentenced to 24 months in prison.\n\nAlthough convicted of a felony crime, this does not hinder Rogers from running for Congress.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Constitution, there are only three requirements to run: The candidate must be at least 25 years old to run for the House and 30 for the Senate, they must be a U.S. Citizen for at least seven years for the House and nine years for the Senate, and they must be a resident in the state they are elected in.\n\nDemocratic voters will get to vote for one of three candidates this March: Vanessa Enoch, David Gelb and Nathaniel Hawkins.\n\nRepublican CandidatesDemocratic CandidatesWarren Davidson (incumbent)Vanessa EnochKay RogersDavid GelbNathaniel Hawkins\n\nState Senator - District 8\n\nDemocratic candidate Ty Hogan will challenge incumbent Sen. Louis Blessing III (R) in November for State Senator in Colerain Township.\n\nComing from a long line of politicians, Hogan is no stranger to the game. From Ohio Attorney General to Clermont County Commissioner, Hogan has been a recognizable last name within the Ohio Democratic Party.\n\nAfter graduating college and working on Wall Street, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hogan enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps where he moved up in the ranks. Two years later, he ended his active duty career and resumed his finance career in Cincinnati, later moving into politics.\n\nBut will Hogan’s family background and accomplishments be enough to beat Sen. Blessing in November?\n\nBlessing has served in the Ohio Senate since October 2019 after former Sen. Louis Terhar (R) resigned due to health issues. In this role, Blessing has helped bring back state funding to his district, such as the $1.2 million going toward the classroom facility project at Crosby Elementary School.\n\nCurrently, Sen. Blessing serves as the chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee and has been a primary sponsor of dozens of bills, including S.B. 217, a bill that would prohibit AI-generated material of child porn and make it illegal to use AI for identity fraud purposes.\n\nAdditionally, Blessing has been able to reach across party lines and work with Senate Democrats, such as Sen. Nickie Antonio. Both senators are currently trying to pass S.B. 76, a bill that would create a tax levy on specific high-volume landlords.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateLouis W. Blessing III (incumbent)Ty Hogan\n\nState Representative - 24th District\n\nRep. Dani Isaacsohn (D), the incumbent for the 24th district of Ohio is seeking re-election against his Democratic opponent Stephan Pryor.\n\nIsaacsohn was elected into the House of Representatives in November 2022 where he has been a member of the Finance Subcommittee on Primary and Secondary Education, Government Oversight Committee, Civil Justice Committee, and more.\n\nOne of the incumbent’s most recent sponsored bills that caught attention was H.B. 348, a bipartisan bill that would create a pilot program to increase school attendance by financially awarding students for going to school.\n\nThe only Republican candidate is John Sess who will go up against the Democratic winner in November.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateJohn SessDani Isaacsohn (incumbent)Stephan Pryor\n\nState Representative - 25th District\n\nIncumbent Rep. Cecil Thomas (D) is running for a second term against Republican candidate Jim Berns, the Executive Director and Founder of Republicans for a Greater Cincinnati.\n\nAs a representative of Cincinnati, Thomas has been an advocate for gun violence prevention by creating and co-sponsoring legislation that promotes safe storage and increases background checks. He is also a member of the following committees: State and Local Government, Criminal Justice, Homeland Security and more.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateJim BernsCecil Thomas (incumbent)\n\nState Representative - 26th District\n\nNorwood City Councilman John Breadon (R) is running for State Representative in hopes of taking Rep. Sedrick Denson’s (D) seat.\n\nRep. Denson has been vocal about his support for abortion and recreational marijuana, especially during the 2023 November Election.\n\nThroughout his two-year term, Denson currently serves as the ranking member, a key spokesperson, of the Families and Aging Committee.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateJohn BreadonSedrick Denson (incumbent)\n\nState Representative - 27th District\n\nA Tri-State lawyer is running for State Representative this election season against incumbent Rep. Rachel Baker (D) in November.\n\nCurt Hartman (R) is an attorney at Finney Law Firm where he concentrates on constitutional and commercial litigation, along with government oversight. He was also the attorney for the Ohio Ballot Board in the abortion amendment lawsuit in March 2023.\n\nIn her professional career, Rep. Baker is a nurse researcher and has a lengthy background in the healthcare system. Although this is her first term in the Ohio House, she has sponsored nearly a dozen bills, most of which revolve around healthcare practices and funding.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateCurt C. HartmanRachel Baker (incumbent)\n\nState Representative - 28th District\n\nRepresenting Forest Park, Rep. Jessica Miranda (D) is an active member of the Ohio House of Representatives and a Democratic name you may hear often.\n\nSince 2022, Miranda has served as the Ohio House Democratic Whip, to which she was nominated by her colleagues. Over the years, she has become a major legislative advocate to prevent gun violence and support the transgender community, especially after the passage of House Bill 68.\n\nNow in her third term, Miranda has already reintroduced the Ohio Anti-Corruption Act and the Ohio Equal Pay Act.\n\nIn November, Miranda will be up against Jenn Giroux, a GOP politician who has run previously for Ohio House Representative in the 27th District in 2022.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidateJenn GirouxJessica E. Miranda (incumbent)\n\nState Representative - 29th District\n\nStarting Wednesday, registered Republican voters will choose between two candidates: Incumbent Rep. Cindy Abrams or George Brunemann, a new GOP politician.\n\nA former Cincinnati Police Officer, Abrams currently serves as the chairwoman of the House Criminal Justice Committee. She was appointed as a representative in 2019.\n\nOne of the more well-known bills Rep. Abrams has sponsored is H.B. 326, which would use marijuana tax revenue money to pay for peace officer training now that marijuana is legal and could soon be sold for recreational purposes.\n\nAfter March, the winner of the GOP race will go up against Joe Salvato (D), who plans to put an end to corruption and show more democratic representation in the House if elected.\n\nRepublican CandidatesDemocratic CandidateCindy Abrams (incumbent)Joe SalvatoGeorge Brunemann\n\nState Representative - 30th District\n\nOhio Rep. Bill Seitz has fulfilled his term limit, meaning his seat is up for grabs come November.\n\nDemocrats will choose between two candidates this Spring: Cheviot City Councilwoman Stefanie Hawk or Andrew Voynovich.\n\nAfter the primaries, the candidate will campaign against Conservative Mike Odioso, who is endorsed by Rep. Seitz, Hamilton County Prosecutor Melissa Powers and former Congressman Steve Chabot.\n\nRepublican CandidateDemocratic CandidatesMike OdiosoStefanie A.
