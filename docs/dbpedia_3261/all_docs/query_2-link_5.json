        "text": "Sandy Valley has a new superintendent but the name and face will be familiar to many in the area.\n\nIn a special meeting, held Monday night, David Fischer was given a five-year contract, commencing on August 1. Fischer, as many will remember, served as junior/senior high school principal and special education director, in the Sandy Valley District, from August 2006 to July 2008. He had previously served as middle school principal and transportation and facilities director in the Osnaburg Local School District.\n\n\"I look forward to coming to Sandy Valley!\" said an excited Fischer, who stayed after the meeting to attend a school concert and meet with parents, students and staff. \"I want to continue the tradition of excellence that has been established by the staff, administration, board of education and the community. I appreciate all of the effort that David Janofa has put into the district and I hope to continue that pattern of success.\"\n\nIn an e-mail sent last Friday, David Collier, president of the board of education, informed the staff of the intent to hire Fischer.\n\n\"The board opted to complete our own search, rather than using the Educational Services Center, state associations such as the Ohio School Board Association or a private firm,\" Collier wrote. \"The board has extended an offer of employment to Mr. David J. Fischer, and Mr. Fischer has accepted our offer.\"\n\nThe letter went on to say that Fischer would officially begin working on Aug. 1, but a supplemental contract would be given to him for days worked prior to that date, to make for a smooth transition into the position.\n\n\"Please join the board in welcoming Mr. Fischer to Sandy Valley,\" said Collier. \"We feel his leadership abilities (and) diverse educational employment background will allow him to continue the success of our schools, as we keep our focus on the needs, goals and success of our students, staff, administrators and community.\"\n\nFischer said in a Tuesday morning e-mail to the Press-News: \"Although I am not completely new to the district, there will be many new faces for me to meet, and I want them to know that I will maintain an open-door policy once I officially get started. I want community members to know that I am eager to assist in making the whole Sandy Valley community a better place and that I am open to any of their comments and suggestions.\n\n\"I hope to lead the district through the uncertain times that currently exist in public education. I will ensure to be a good steward of the taxpayers' money, while still providing a quality education. I want to ensure parents that I am confident that Sandy Valley will continue to meet the challenges of a changing workforce, being an educational leader in our area, as we continue our journey into the 21st Century.\"\n\nFischer is a graduate of The University of Akron, where he earned a bachelor of arts in political science and a master of arts in secondary education. At Ashland University, Fischer completed his school superintendent licensure requirements and his administrative school certification.\n\nFischer started his educational career at Plain Local Schools as a history teacher. He also coached at the school.\n\nFrom there he went to Osnaburg Local and then to Sandy Valley. From 2008-2011, he was the director of curriculum and special programs at Southeast Local Schools, in Apple Creek. He became the superintendent of Chippewa Local Schools in Doylestown, in August of 2011, but Fischer had a desire to come back to Stark County.\n\nFischer's interests have included memberships in educational organizations, as well as in Rotary and Lions clubs, Canton Chamber of Commerce and the HOF Ribs Burn-Off and Balloon Classic.\n\nHe and his wife, Jennifer, have two children, Molly, 14, and Elizabeth, 11."
