        "text": "PASADENA, Calif. - The Institute for Portfolio Alternatives (“IPA”) has honored David Fisher, a managing partner of ExchangeRight, with its Outstanding Service Award, highlighting his work as a staunch advocate for Section 1031, real estate investors, the securitized real estate industry, and the IPA.\n\nThe award was presented to Fisher in recognition of his dedicated and ongoing efforts to educate policymakers about the devastating impact of proposed restrictions in drafts of the American Families Plan, which included significant constraints on 1031 exchanges and a prohibition against IRA investments in private and non-traded public securities.\n\nOver the past year, Fisher has driven key grassroots political outreach campaigns alongside a coalition of industry organizations and has personally met with dozens of key members of the Senate Finance and the House Ways and Means Committee to discuss the preservation of Section 1031.\n\n“Our Outstanding Service Award recognizes those in our industry who advance our objectives while representing IPA’s core values, and David continues to demonstrate excellence through providing pertinent resources in the ongoing fight to oppose undue limitations on Section 1031 and IRA securities investments,” said Anthony Chereso, president and CEO of IPA. “From meeting with policymakers one on one and producing educational content, to pioneering political action campaigns that have inspired thousands of people to write to their members of Congress, David has gone above and beyond to make our voices heard to protect American families throughout the country. He continues to collaborate tirelessly with us to preserve the benefits for investors provided by alternative investments, and we look forward to continuing the fight with him, ExchangeRight, and the rest of the IPA Community.”\n\n“We are deeply grateful for David’s leadership on behalf of ExchangeRight, our investors, and our industry in the fight to preserve the 1031 exchange and the ability for investors to access alternative investments through their IRA,” said Joshua Ungerecht, a managing partner of ExchangeRight. “As partners, we could not be prouder of David’s devotion to our industry and how he represents our company’s guiding principles of tenacity, responsibility, and servant-heartedness.”\n\nAbout IPA\n\nThrough advocacy and industry-leading education, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives (“IPA”) is committed to expanding access to real assets and creating more opportunities for retail investors to effectively balance their portfolios.
