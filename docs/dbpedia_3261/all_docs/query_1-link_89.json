        "text": "CHICAGO (January 29, 2019) â€“ Holland & Knight announced today that bankruptcy attorneys David Wirt and David Fischer have joined the firm as partners in the Chicago office. In addition, Mr. Wirt will serve as co-chair of the firm's national Bankruptcy, Restructuring and Creditors' Rights Practice Group and executive partner of the Chicago office. Both attorneys previously practiced at Locke Lord, where Mr. Wirt was national chair and Mr. Fischer co-chair of the Bankruptcy, Restructuring and Insolvency group. Mr. Wirt also previously served on the firm's executive committee.\n\n\"We are delighted to welcome these outstanding lawyers to the firm. They have handled many prominent bankruptcies, both in Chicago and nationally, and have a substantial client base,\" said Steven Sonberg, Holland & Knight managing partner. \"Not only will they have a significant positive impact on our national bankruptcy practice, they will be important contributors to the growth of our Chicago office, which Dave Wirt will now head. Dave is well-respected in the Chicago legal community, and I am confident that under his leadership our already strong local reputation will be further enhanced.\"\n\nMr. Wirt is one of the most highly regarded bankruptcy attorneys in Chicago. Over the past 25 years, he has represented numerous corporate debtors and official creditor committees, institutional lenders, trade creditors and governmental agencies throughout the United States in all aspects of insolvency workouts and litigation.\n\nWith more than 35 years of experience focused on the interplay of corporate finance and bankruptcy law, Mr. Fischer has a reputation for being a skilled strategist who is highly regarded for structuring innovative business deals and workouts. His practice spans many industry segments, with a particular emphasis on finance, real estate and private equity.\n\n\"David and I are excited about joining one of the best-managed and most successful law firms in the country,\" said Mr. Wirt. \"We see significant opportunities to grow our individual practices, particularly given the highly collaborative nature of the firm's partnership. Just as importantly, we look forward to helping our new Chicago colleagues further expand Holland & Knight's presence in one of the nation's largest legal markets.\"\n\n\"I can think of no better person to succeed me as executive partner of the Chicago office than Dave Wirt. He is an excellent lawyer and inspiring leader,\" said Steven Elrod, who has served as head of the office for 10 years. \"Dave and David are tremendous additions to our team. Their professional relationships and client contacts will help us build on our successes and become a significant force in the Chicago market.\"\n\nMr. Elrod is stepping down as Chicago office executive partner given his responsibilities as president of the Chicago Bar Association and as national co-chair of Holland & Knight's Land Use and Government Team."
