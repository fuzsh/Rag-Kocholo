Nizar Qabbani was a Syrian poet and diplomat, born to a merchant family in Damascus. He was the grand-nephew of the pioneering Arab playwright Abu Khalil Qabbani. Nizar Qabbani studied law at the University of Damascus graduating in 1945, and then entered the diplomatic corps. He represented his country in Egypt, Turkey, Lebanon, Britain, China and Spain before retiring in 1966 and moving to Beirut, Lebanon, where he founded a publishing house, Manshurat Nizar Qabbani.

His first collection of poetry is called Qalat li al samraâ€™ (The Brunette Told Me, 1942), and was published when he was just 19 years old. It was an instant success, and grew in popularity as time went on. The themes of his poems were at first strictly romantic, then grew to be outspoken criticism of Arab political and social life and the oppression to human freedom and dignity. His poetic language is simple but eloquent and noted for capturing the rhythms of everyday Syrian speech.
