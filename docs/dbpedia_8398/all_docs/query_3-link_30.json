        "text": "For Valentine’s Day, we bring you two new translations of love poems by Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani:\n\nBy Rachel Schine\n\nIn his obituary to the celebrated Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani, published a few days after his death in May 1998, Adel Darwish writes that “for Qabbani, national liberation was meaningless without sexual liberation.”\n\nQabbani, who had spent much of his life as a diplomat and ardent Arab nationalist, also spent much of his life as a romantic in more conventional terms, and through verse he brought his world and its muses into vivid, living color. Much of the way in which Qabbani achieved this was by using the language of the everyday, stripped of pretense and elitism. In the plain speech of the two poems presented in translation below (an “Ode to Sadness,” or, Qaṣīdat al-Ḥuzn, and “You Want,” or Turīdīna), one may detect a sort of plaintive hope laced with a countervailing, often tongue-in-cheek cynicism: there is a hope that the narrator can be enough for the woman he adulates, that his words can satisfy, and that she can fulfill him in turn.\n\nThere is also a hope in these poems that the landscapes the poet has traversed — the cities and communities that he has had occasion to inhabit and speak on behalf of throughout his life — might meld with, accommodate, or elucidate his love for another human being. In the first poem, we are told that his lover has taught him “how to see Beirut” (to which he migrated after ending his government career) as a harlot on promenade, bedecked with beautiful robes but also divulging pain. In the second poem, the narrator laments that he is unable to give a woman all that she dreams of because he is “A laborer from Damascus — poor,” who “soak[s his] morning loaf in blood/ [his] hair in spit.” Wrapped up in the complications of love are the complexities of the poet’s relationship with these classed geographies, lending credence to Darwish’s point that Qabbani viewed the health of the nation and the free expression of sexuality as intertwined; his humble Damascene roots are thus both a source of pride and anxiety during courtship, while his lurid portrayal of Beirut goes hand in hand with learning the art of sadness from a practiced, female teacher. Indeed, it is through these ambivalent depictions of contemporary locales and the socioeconomic realities that they intimate that the poet fashions some of the most poignant portions of the poems.\n\nIn contrast, one of the great joys of these verses is that Qabbani consciously relishes looking backward through the centuries and across a more extensive regional terrain, revivifying the clichés of classical Arabic love poetry. In the spirit of rediscovering old chestnuts anew, he tells the reader in “Ode to Sadness” (the title of which is itself a throwback to the traditional qaṣīda with its opening refrain of love lost and its peripatetic, camel-mounted middle section) that his lover teaches him to act like a child, to read stories of knighthood and gallantry, and to think of women in terms of all the visually delighting but timeworn tropes that the canon has to offer; reading across the two poems, we find a woman whose lips are like pomegranates and whose eyes are like gulf water — she is redolent with fragrance and her eyes are kohl-rimmed. With respect to imagery, this is a very back-to-basics, classicizing approach to depicting a lover, though encased in the modern structure of free verse rather than the old-school ghazal, or metered love poem. In addition to pairing himself with his beloved, Qabbani marries his Christian, Arab, and more trans-regionally Middle Eastern identities and experiences in these pieces: we find references to church bells and heaven-sent manna alongside allusions to the erstwhile courtyard of the Sasanian sovereign Khosroes (the iwān kisrā) in Ctesiphon and the Thousand and One Nights.\n\nIt seems fitting, given the date but also the times, to dive into some poetry that deals in the many and hybrid types of love described above, for women, memories, nations, cultures, and of course, for one’s own self.\n\nAn Ode to Sadness\n\nBy Nizar Qabbani, tr. Rachel Schine\n\nYour love has taught me… how to be sad.\n\nAnd I have needed, for ages\n\nA woman to make me sad\n\nA woman in whose arms I could weep\n\nLike a sparrow,\n\nA woman—to gather up my pieces—\n\nLike shards of shattered crystal\n\nYour love has taught me, my dear,\n\nThe worst of habits\n\nIt has taught me to fill up my glass\n\nA thousand times per night\n\nAnd to sample the treatment of druggists\n\nTo knock at the diviners’ door\n\nIt has taught me— I now leave my home\n\nTo comb the roadside flagstones\n\nAnd I stalk your visage\n\nIn the rain, and in the lights of cars\n\nI stalk your specter\n\nEven… even…\n\nIn sheets of advertisements…\n\nYour love has taught me…\n\nHow I’ve been love-lost in my own face—for hours\n\nSearching for a gypsy poem,\n\nThat every gypsy girl might envy\n\nSearching for a face—a voice—\n\nYour love is all the faces and all the voices.\n\nYour love has made me enter, my dear\n\nCities of sorrows\n\nBefore you, I had not entered\n\nCities of sorrows—\n\nI had never known—\n\nThat a tear was a person\n\nThat a person without sadness\n\nIs the memory of a person…\n\nYour love has taught me…\n\nTo behave like kids,\n\nTo draw your face—\n\nWith chalk upon the walls\n\nAnd on the sails of fishermen’s crafts\n\nUpon the church bells,\n\nAnd the crosses.\n\nYour love has taught me…\n\nHow love alters the turning of time—\n\nIt has taught me that when I love,\n\nThe earth holds back its spinning\n\nYour love has taught me things…\n\nThat were never part of the accounting\n\nSo I read the stories of children—\n\nI entered the palaces of the jinn kings\n\nI dreamed that the daughter of the sultan\n\nMarried me—\n\nThose eyes of hers… purer than the gulf waters\n\nThose lips of hers… more luscious than a pomegranate’s bloom\n\nAnd I dreamed that I safeguarded her\n\nLike the knights,\n\nI dreamed that I gifted her,\n\nWith strands of pearl and coral\n\nYour love has taught me, my dear, what delirium is\n\nIt has taught me how life goes on,\n\nWith the sultan’s daughter never coming.\n\nYour love has taught me…\n\nHow I love you in all things\n\nIn the naked tree\n\nIn the desiccated, yellow leaves\n\nIn the rainy weather—in the storms\n\nIn the smallest of cafes—\n\nIn which we, of an evening, drank our black coffee\n\nYour love has taught me to seek refuge\n\nIn nameless hotels\n\nIn nameless churches\n\nIn nameless cafes\n\nYour love has taught me…\n\nHow the night distends with strangers’ sorrows\n\nIt has taught me… how to see Beirut:\n\nA woman… a madame of seductions\n\nA woman, wearing each and every night\n\nThe finest garments she possesses\n\nSprinkling perfume on her breasts\n\nFor the sailors—and the princes—\n\nYour love has taught me…\n\nTo weep for lack of crying\n\nIt has taught me how sadness sleeps\n\nLike a young boy with severed feet\n\nOn the streets of Rūsha and Ḥamrā’\n\nYour love has taught me… how to be sad.\n\nAnd I have needed, for ages\n\nA woman to make me sad\n\nA woman in whose arms I could weep\n\nLike a sparrow,\n\nA woman— to gather up my pieces—\n\nLike shards of shattered crystal\n\nYou Want\n\nBy Nizar Qabbani, tr. Rachel Schine\n\nYou want, like all women do,\n\nThe treasures of Solomon\n\nLike all women…\n\nCisterns of perfume\n\nAnd combs of ivory\n\nSwarms of serving girls\n\nYou want, my Ladyship,\n\nHim to proclaim your name like a parrot\n\nTo say, “I love you” at dawn\n\nTo say, “I love you” at dusk\n\nWhile washing your legs with wine\n\nO, Shahrazad of women,\n\nYou want, like all women do…\n\nYou want the stars of the sky from me,\n\nAnd dishes of manna\n\nAnd platters of quail\n\nAnd slippers of chestnut blossoms\n\nYou want…\n\nSilks from Shanghai\n\nAnd from Isfahan—\n\nOnagers’ skins.\n\nBut I am not one of those prophets,\n\nWho casts his staff\n\nAnd splits the sea\n\nWho hews his solid stones from light…\n\nYou want, like all women do,\n\nFans of feathers\n\nAnd kohl\n\nAnd fragrance\n\nYou want a slave\n\nOf profound idiocy\n\nTo read you bedside poetry\n\nYou want…\n\nAt one and the same time,\n\nRashid’s palatial court,\n\nAnd Khosroes’ arching hall,\n\nAnd a parade of bondsmen and captives\n\nKeeping your skirts’ train in tow\n\nO Cleopatra,\n\nBut I am not\n\nSome globetrotting Sindbad,\n\nWho can make Babel appear between your hands\n\nNor the Pyramids of Egypt\n\nNor the archway of Khosroes\n\nI do not have a lofty lamp\n\nWith which to bring you sunrays through the night\n\nAs you desire… all you women…\n\nAnd what’s more,\n\nO Shahrazad of women,\n\nI am a laborer from Damascus—poor\n\nI soak my morning loaf in blood,\n\nMy hair in spit…\n\nI live simply.\n\nAnd I believe in bread and saints,\n\nAnd I dream of love like the others,\n\nAnd a partner patching up the holes\n\nIn my robes\n\nA child sleeping on my lap\n\nLike a field sparrow\n\nLike the glow on the water\n\nI think of love like the others\n\nBecause a lover is like air\n\nBecause a lover is a sun, shining\n\nUpon the dreamers behind castle walls,\n\nUpon the toiling breadwinners,\n\nUpon the wretched\n\nAnd those who lay down in beds of silk\n\nAnd those who lay down in beds of sobbing\n\nYou want, like all women do…\n\nYou want the eighth Wonder of the World,\n\nBut I have nothing,\n\nExcept my boasts.\n\n#"
