        "text": "I feel a special connection to the Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani (“Kabbani” in some cases). My wedding had two readings of Arabic poems, including one of Qabbani’s. His poetry was the perfect addition to our ceremony, as his work is full of vivid imagery and deep expressions of love. To be honest, his prolific output (over 50 collections published in his lifetime!) covers a range of subjects, from love to politics, to social issues and more. But he is best known for his love poetry, where his simple style and everyday language resonated with young and old alike.\n\nIn particular, I love how Nizar Qabbani uses natural imagery to strengthen his short phrases and stanzas. How he blends the life of a poet directly into his depictions of love. And how his poetry beautifully captured the feelings of our wedding day. In this post we’ll explore all of this, studying the different imagery in Qabbani’s love poems.\n\nNote: This post contains affiliate links.

Please check out my privacy policy and disclosure page for more information.\n\nNizar Qabbani – a Brief Biography\n\nNizar Qabbani was born in 1923 in Damascus, then part of French-controlled Syria. He grew up in a middle class family, and attended university in Damascus to study law. After graduation, Qabbani became a diplomat however, representing Syria around the world in Ankara, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, London and Madrid. He wrote during this period, but eventually retired from the diplomatic corps in 1966 to focus exclusively on his poetry.\n\nQabbani began writing poems at an early age, perhaps as young as 14, and published his first collection of love poems in 1944. His work was an instant success, garnering national attention before spreading across the Arab world. His direct, open style contrasted with the stricter, more formal nature of traditional Arabic poetry. In addition, Qabbani combined colloquial vocabulary into his poems, as well as modern issues and terminology. Renowned for his passionate poems about love and beauty, he was also a fierce defender of women’s rights and even delved into political issues.\n\nLove Through the Beauty of Nature\n\nQabbani frequently uses descriptions of nature, flowers, and animals to better illustrate his feelings. Look at the Arabic above, translated below by Bassam K. Frangieh and Clementine R. Brown in Arabian Love Poems. We start with a surprising question, since comparing one person to the enormity of the sky seems impossible… But, in the span of a few words, Qabbani eloquently turns this into a stunning profession of love.\n\nMy lover asks me:\n\n“What is the difference between me and the sky?”\n\nThe difference, my love,\n\nIs that when you laugh,\n\nI forget about the sky.\n\nIn another case (translated by Lena Jayyusi and W. S. Merwin in the collection On Entering the Sea), we delve directly into the author’s feelings. His lover’s smallest movements hit him with enormous power — shattering the moon, and pulling water from solid stone. Qabbani’s words conjure vivid images, flipping simple pictures into a brilliant illustration of a man in love.\n\nYou are no ordinary woman\n\nYou are astonishment itself … the guessing\n\nat what is to come unexpectedly\n\nHow is it that in a moment\n\nof discovery and inspiration\n\nyou extract water from the heart of a stone?\n\nHow is it that with the touch of an eyelash\n\nyou turn the solitary moon\n\ninto a thousand crescents?\n\nLove in Words and Literature\n\nQabbani also weaves the act of writing into his poetry. He narrates openly as a poet sometimes, citing how his feelings of love affect his poetic work. In the Arabic above (my translation below), Qabbani combines natural elements with the act of writing. Being in love completely changes the words and poetry in his notebooks. In this fashion, the reader sees love directly through the poet’s eyes.\n\nWhen I am in love\n\nI become a liquid light\n\ninvisible to the eye\n\nand the poems in my notebooks\n\nbecome fields of mimosas and daisies.\n\nIn another love poem, Nizar Qabbani references reading, writing, science and the arts. In a quest to define love, he looks everywhere — in popular literature and songs, scientific works, and more. See this excerpt of the longer poem:\n\nWhat is love?\n\nWe have read a thousand treatises on it\n\nand still do not know what we have read\n\nread works of interpretation, astrology, and medicine\n\nand do not know where we began\n\nwe have memorized the whole of folk literature\n\npoetry and song\n\nand remember not a single line\n\nwe have asked the sages of love about their state\n\nand discover that they knew no more than we do\n\n(excerpt of “What is Love?” translated by Lena Jayyusi and W. S. Merwin in the collection On Entering the Sea)\n\nMy Connection to Qabbani\n\nAs I mentioned above, I feel a special connection to Qabbani due to the inclusion of his poetry in our wedding ceremony. I’m especially lucky that our friend Maisa hand-wrote her reading in beautifully styled calligraphy. A small section of her work is above. Maisa’s full piece features another two stanzas, encircled by delicately sketched vines and curls.\n\nIn this poem, Nizar Qabbani uses travel imagery, a feature I particularly enjoy. Not only do I adore traveling, but I relish this metaphor about trains. Some loves are short and pass quickly, like trains that come and go. But not true love. True love is the last train, the final station.\n\nI love you\n\nI do not want to link you with any memory of the past\n\nnor with the memory of passing trains\n\nyou are the last train; night and day it travels\n\nacross the veins of my hands\n\nYou are the last train\n\nand I am your last station.\n\n(excerpt of “My Sweetheart on the New Year” translated by Lena Jayyusi and Christopher Middleton in On Entering the Sea)\n\nWhat Next?\n\nWant to read more poems by Nizar Qabbani, see other examples of his evocative imagery?
