        "text": "Wikipedia summarizes Nizar Qabbani (March 21, 1923 – April 30, 1998) as follows: he was “a Syrian diplomat, poet and publisher. His poetic style combines simplicity and elegance in exploring themes of love, eroticism, feminism, religion and Arab nationalism. He is one of the most revered contemporary poets in the Arab world.”\n\nThrough a lifetime of writing, Qabbani made women his main theme and inspiration. He earned a reputation for daringness with the publication in 1954 of his first volume of verse, “Childhood of a Breast,” whose erotic and romantic themes broke from the conservative traditions of Arab literature.\n\nThe suicide of his sister, who was unwilling to marry a man she did not love, had a profound effect on Qabbani. Thereafter, he expressed resentment of male chauvinism and often wrote from a woman’s viewpoint and advocated social freedoms for women. By profession he was a diplomat for the Syrian government through the mid 1960s. His progressive and secular politics and outlook alienated him from some conservative trends in the Arab world, awash in “blood oil” or religious extremism.\n\nYouth by the millions in every Arab country, and each generation since his fame and liberal spirit spread, still compose their declarations of love and new life in the light of Nizar Qabbani’s poetry.\n\nThe unnamed verse below, written in 1970, seems as if it could have been written yesterday in half a dozen nations – and in some U.S. states as well.\n\n1\n\nFriends\n\nThe old word is dead.\n\nThe old books are dead.\n\nOur speech with holes like worn-out shoes is dead.\n\nDead is the mind that led to defeat.\n\n2\n\nOur poetry has gone sour.\n\nWomen’s hair, nights, curtains and sofas\n\nHave gone sour.\n\nEverything has gone sour.\n\n3\n\nMy grieved country,\n\nIn a flash\n\nYou changed me from a poet who wrote love poems\n\nTo a poet who writes with a knife.\n\n4\n\nWhat we feel is beyond words:\n\nWe should be ashamed of our poems.\n\n5\n\nStirred by Oriental bombast,\n\nBy boastful swaggering that never killed a fly,\n\nBy the fiddle and the drum,\n\nWe went to war,\n\nAnd lost.\n\n6\n\nOur shouting is louder than our actions,\n\nOur swords are taller than us,\n\nThis is our tragedy.\n\n7\n\nIn short\n\nWe wear the cape of civilization\n\nBut our souls live in the stone age\n\n8\n\nYou don’t win a war\n\nWith a reed and a flute.\n\n9\n\nOur impatience\n\nCost us fifty thousand new tents.\n\n10\n\nDon’t curse heaven\n\nIf it abandons you,\n\nDon’t curse circumstances,\n\nGod gives victory to whom He wishes\n\nGod is not a blacksmith to beat swords.\n\n11\n\nIt’s painful to listen to the news in the morning\n\nIt’s painful to listen to the barking of dogs.\n\n12\n\nOur enemies did not cross our borders\n\nThey crept through our weaknesses like ants.\n\n13\n\nFive thousand years\n\nGrowing beards\n\nIn our caves.\n\nOur currency is unknown,\n\nOur eyes are a haven for flies.\n\nFriends,\n\nSmash the doors,\n\nWash your brains,\n\nWash your clothes.\n\nFriends,\n\nRead a book,\n\nWrite a book,\n\nGrow words, pomegranates and grapes,\n\nSail to the country of fog and snow.\n\nNobody knows you exist in caves.\n\nPeople take you for a breed of mongrels.\n\n14\n\nWe are a thick-skinned people\n\nWith empty souls.\n\nWe spend our days practicing witchcraft,\n\nPlaying chess and sleeping.\n\nAre we the ‘Nation by which God blessed mankind’?\n\n15\n\nOur desert oil could have become\n\nDaggers of flame and fire.\n\nWe’re a disgrace to our noble ancestors:\n\nWe let our oil flow through the toes of whores.\n\n16\n\nWe run wildly through the streets\n\nDragging people with ropes,\n\nSmashing windows and locks.\n\nWe praise like frogs,\n\nTurn midgets into heroes,\n\nAnd heroes into scum:\n\nWe never stop and think.\n\nIn mosques\n\nWe crouch idly,\n\nWrite poems,\n\nProverbs,\n\nBeg God for victory\n\nOver our enemy\n\n17\n\nIf I knew I’d come to no harm,\n\nAnd could see the Sultan,\n\nThis is what I would say:\n\n‘Sultan,\n\nYour wild dogs have torn my clothes\n\nYour spies hound me\n\nTheir eyes hound me\n\nTheir noses hound me\n\nTheir feet hound me\n\nThey hound me like Fate\n\nInterrogate my wife\n\nAnd take down the name of my friends.\n\nSultan,\n\nWhen I came close to your walls\n\nand talked about my pains,\n\nYour soldiers beat me with their boots,\n\nForced me to eat my shoes.\n\nSultan,\n\nYou lost two wars,\n\nSultan,\n\nHalf of our people are without tongues,\n\nWhat’s the use of a people without tongues?\n\nHalf of our people\n\nAre trapped like ants and rats\n\nBetween walls.’\n\nIf I knew I’d come to no harm\n\nI’d tell him:\n\n‘You lost two wars\n\nYou lost touch with children.’\n\n18\n\nIf we hadn’t buried our unity\n\nIf we hadn’t ripped its young body with bayonets\n\nIf it had stayed in our eyes\n\nThe dogs wouldn’t have savaged our flesh.\n\n19\n\nWe do not want an angry generation\n\nTo plough the sky\n\nTo blow up history\n\nTo blow up our thoughts.\n\nWe want a new generation\n\nThat does not forgive mistakes\n\nThat does not bend.\n\nWe want a generation of giants.\n\n20\n\nArab children,\n\nCorn ears of the future,\n\nYou will break our chains,\n\nKill the opium in our heads,\n\nKill the illusions.\n\nArab children,\n\nDon’t read about our suffocated generation,\n\nWe are a hopeless case.\n\nWe are as worthless as a water-melon rind.\n\nDon’t read about us,\n\nDon’t ape us,\n\nDon’t accept us,\n\nDon’t accept our ideas,\n\nWe are a nation of crooks and jugglers.\n\nArab children,\n\nSpring rain,\n\nCorn ears of the future,\n\nYou are the generation\n\nThat will overcome defeat."
