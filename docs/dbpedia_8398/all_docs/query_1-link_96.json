        "text": "Happy Birthday Nizar Qabbani!\n\nTouching on recurring themes with effortless grace, Nizar Qabbani's work transports readers to the places and people he loved most. His work is celebrated across the Arab world and beyond — and for good reason.\n\nBorn in Damascus, Syria, Qabbani was educated as a lawyer, but turned heads with his first book of poems: The Brunette Told Me. The collection focused on women, setting Qabbani apart as a one of the most prolific feminist minds of his time.\n\nEarly in his career, which he dubbed the \"Pink Era,” Qabbani traveled the world to experience the vibrancy of cultural diversity. When he moved to Iraq, he met a woman amongst the palm trees called Balqis. She would become his second wife and the great love of his life.\n\nAfter her death in 1981, Qabbani moved to Switzerland, France, and finally England. Qabbani referred to his final years in foggy London as the \"Grey Era,\" but his work from that time demonstrates the greatness that comes from a life well-lived.\n\nFor his fans, we hope today's Doodle by Alyssa Winans elicits the mood and memories sparked by Qabbani's words."
