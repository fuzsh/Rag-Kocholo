        "text": "Al Ghaf Honey\n\nThe Al Ghaf tree is a local desert tree which bears the harsh summers with drought and high temperatures. From the rich flowers, bees that pollinate this tree can produce delicious red colour honey in June and July each year\n\nSidr Honey\n\nThe Sidr tree is an evergreen tree with long and strong forked branches. The blossom from this tree is called Yabyab, which provides rich food for bees to produce honey in October and November. This honey is the most expensive, but tastiest\n\nSamar Honey\n\nThe Samar tree trunk, leaves and blossom contains Barm which is the secret of healing. You can enjoy the best types of honey from this tree every year in May and June. It is an historical witness to the life of the Emirati nation which represents the harsh desert and mountain environments\n\nSome facts about bees:\n\nThe queen bee eats only royal jelly, an extraordinary food created by worker bees so she lives much longer\n\nThe life cycle of a worker bee is from 40-60 days\n\nA queen bee lives for 3-5 years\n\nThis allows her to lay millions of eggs and allows the continuity of the bee colony\n\nAbout 20,000 honey bees and one queen populate each hive\n\nHoney is packed with vital vitamins, minerals, enzymes, water and anti-oxidants.\n\nApart from honey, five other products are royal jelly, the special food bees feed their queen\n\nPollen is their protein source, a super food that is nutritious, rich in amino acids\n\nBeewax is used to construct the combs. Due to its anti-fungal, anti-bacterial elements, it is used in skin treatments\n\nPropolis, a resin-like material produced by bees is used to make hives. It has natural antibiotic qualities so works to sterilize hive, protects from disease, keeps their home free from germs. Also used to treat sores, infection, warts\n\nBee venom is used by bees to protect themselves. Has anti-inflammatory properties, sometimes used to relieve conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, nerve and muscle pain\n\nHoney, royal jelly, pollen have health enhancing qualities\n\nThe other three products are used for therapeutic purposes\n\nIs beekeeping dangerous?\n\nAs long as you deal with bees gently, you will be safe, says Mohammed Al Najeh, who has worked with bees since he was a boy.\n\n“The biggest mistake people make is they panic when they see a bee. They are small but smart creatures. If you move your hand quickly to hit the bees, this is an aggressive action and bees will defend themselves. They can sense the adrenalin in our body. But if we are calm, they are move away.”"
