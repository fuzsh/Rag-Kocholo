        "text": "Nizar Qabbani\n\nBorn: 23 March 1923, Damascus, Syria\n\nNationality: Syrian\n\nDied: 30 April 1998, London, UK\n\nQabbani was a diplomat, poet, writer, and publisher. His poetry is best known for combining simplicity and elegance to explore the themes of love, eroticism, feminism, Arab nationalism, and religion. Qabbani is among the most revered and respected contemporary poets from the Arab world and is considered Syria’s national poet.\n\nBorn in Damascus, the capital of Syria, to a middle-class merchant family, Qabbani was raised in the neighbourhood of Mi’thnah Al-Shahm, in Old Damascus. Between 1930 and 1941 he studied at the National Scientific College School in the city. Qabbani went on to study law at Damascus University, graduating in 1945\n\nWhile a student Qabbani wrote his first collection of poems, ‘The Brunette Told Me,’ which he published in 1942. Sending shockwaves through Damascus society the collection of romantic verse made several references to a woman’s body. To give the work some acceptability Qabbani showed it to the minister of education, Munir al-Ailani, who was also a friend of his father’s and a leading nationalist. Ailani liked the poems and gave them his endorsement by writing the preface for Qabbani’s first book.\n\nQabbani worked for the Syrian Foreign Ministry after his graduation from law school. He served as Consul in several capital cities, including Cairo, Beirut, London, and Madrid. On the formation of the United Arab Republic, Qabbani was appointed Vice-Secretary of the UAR for its embassies in China. During these years he wrote extensively and his poems written in China are considered to be among his finest. Qabbani continued to work as a diplomat until 1966, by which time he had established a publishing house in Beirut.\n\nQabbani was 15 when his older sister of 25 committed suicide because she refused to marry a man she didn’t love. Whilst at her funeral he decided to fight the social conditions that caused her death. Qabbani is one of the most feminist and progressive intellectuals of his time.\n\nDamascus remained a powerful muse in Qabbani’s poetry, particularly in the “Jasmine Scent of Damascus.” The 1967 Six-Day War was also influential in his work and lament for the Arabic cause. It marked a qualitative shift in Qabbani’s writing – from erotic love poems to overly political themes of rejectionism and resistance.\n\nQabbani’s father was Syrian and his mother was of Turkish descent. A factory owner, his father helped support fighters resisting the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon, resulting in being imprisoned numerous times, greatly affecting Qabbani’s upbringing into a revolutionary in his own right.\n\nQabbani married twice. With his first wife, Zahra Aqbiq, he had two children, a daughter, Hadba, and a son, Tawfiq who died of a heart attack at aged 22. His second wife Balqis al Rawi was killed in the 1981 Iraqi embassy bombing in Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. They had a son, Omar, and a daughter, Zainab.\n\nQabbani left Beirut after the death of Balqis, moving between Geneva and Paris before settling in London, where he spent the remaining years of his life in exile. He continued to write poems and articles raising controversy and arguments. Qabbani died of a heart attack in London in 1998 and wished to be buried in Damascus. The great Arab poet was mourned by Arabs across the world.\n\nBread, Hashish and Moon by Nizar Qabbani\n\nWhen the moon is born in the east,\n\nAnd the white rooftops drift asleep\n\nUnder the heaped-up light,\n\nPeople leave their shops and march forth in groups\n\nTo meet the moon\n\nCarrying bread, and a radio, to the mountaintops,\n\nAnd their narcotics.\n\nThere they buy and sell fantasies\n\nAnd images,\n\nAnd die - as the moon comes to life.\n\nWhat does that luminous disc\n\nDo to my homeland?\n\nThe land of the prophets,\n\nThe land of the simple,\n\nThe chewers of tobacco, the dealers in drug?\n\nWhat does the moon do to us,\n\nThat we squander our valor\n\nAnd live only to beg from Heaven?\n\nWhat has the heaven\n\nFor the lazy and the weak?\n\nWhen the moon comes to life they are changed to\n\ncorpses,\n\nAnd shake the tombs of the saints,\n\nHoping to be granted some rice, some children…\n\nThey spread out their fine and elegant rugs,\n\nAnd console themselves with an opium we call fate\n\nAnd destiny.\n\nIn my land, the land of the simple\n\nWhat weakness and decay\n\nLay hold of us, when the light streams forth!\n\nRugs, thousands of baskets,\n\nGlasses of tea and children swarn over the hills.\n\nIn my land,\n\nwhere the simple weep,\n\nAnd live in the light they cannot perceive;\n\nIn my land,\n\nWhere people live without eyes,\n\nAnd pray,\n\nAnd fornicate,\n\nAnd live in resignation,\n\nAs they always have,\n\nCalling on the crescent moon:\n\n\" O Crescent Moon!\n\nO suspended God of Marble!\n\nO unbelievable object!\n\nAlways you have been for the east, for us,\n\nA cluster of diamonds,\n\nFor the millions whose senses are numbed\"\n\nOn those eastern nights when\n\nThe moon waxes full,\n\nThe east divests itself of all honor\n\nAnd vigor.\n\nThe millions who go barefoot,\n\nWho believe in four wives\n\nAnd the day of judgment;\n\nThe millions who encounter bread\n\nOnly in their dreams;\n\nWho spend the night in houses\n\nBuilt of coughs;\n\nWho have never set eyes on medicine;\n\nFall down like corpses beneath the light."
