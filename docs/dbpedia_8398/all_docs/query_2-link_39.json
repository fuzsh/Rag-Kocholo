        "text": "Dear readers,\n\nThank you for following me on this month’s journey in verse. I hope you encountered at least one poem that delighted or moved you, bewildered or emboldened you. It has truly been a pleasure sharing this range of works with you–and I hope to continue posting beyond National Poetry Month, though not quite as often!\n\nThe last words of April will come from one of the most revered contemporary Arab poets, the Syrian writer Nizar Qabbani (1923-1998). He was known for his stirring love poetry that gave expression to women’s freedom–and also for his poems of exile and elegy. He passed away 15 years today and was buried in his hometown of Damascus, which he described in his will as “the womb that taught me poetry, taught me creativity, and granted me the alphabet of Jasmine.”\n\n“A Lesson in Drawing”\n\nMy son places his paint box in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a bird for him.\n\nInto the color gray I dip the brush\n\nand draw a square with locks and bars.\n\nAstonishment fills his eyes:\n\n“… But this is a prison, Father,\n\nDon’t you know, how to draw a bird?”\n\nAnd I tell him: “Son, forgive me.\n\nI’ve forgotten the shapes of birds.”\n\n*\n\nMy son puts the drawing book in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a wheatstalk.\n\nI hold the pen\n\nand draw a gun.\n\nMy son mocks my ignorance,\n\ndemanding,\n\n“Don’t you know, Father, the difference between a\n\nwheatstalk and a gun?”\n\nI tell him, “Son,\n\nonce I used to know the shapes of wheatstalks\n\nthe shape of the loaf\n\nthe shape of the rose\n\nBut in this hardened time\n\nthe trees of the forest have joined\n\nthe militia men\n\nand the rose wears dull fatigues\n\nIn this time of armed wheatstalks\n\narmed birds\n\narmed culture\n\nand armed religion\n\nyou can’t buy a loaf\n\nwithout finding a gun inside\n\nyou can’t pluck a rose in the field\n\nwithout its raising its thorns in your face\n\nyou can’t buy a book\n\nthat doesn’t explode between your fingers.”\n\n*\n\nMy son sits at the edge of my bed\n\nand asks me to recite a poem,\n\nA tear falls from my eyes onto the pillow.\n\nMy son licks it up, astonished, saying:\n\n“But this is a tear, father, not a poem!”\n\nAnd I tell him:\n\n“When you grow up, my son,\n\nand read the diwan of Arabic poetry\n\nyou’ll discover that the word and the tear are twins\n\nand the Arabic poem\n\nis no more than a tear wept by writing fingers.”\n\n*\n\nMy son lays down his pens, his crayon box in\n\nfront of me\n\nand asks me to draw a homeland for him.\n\nThe brush trembles in my hands\n\nand I sink, weeping.\n\nThis love poem from Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani (1923-1998) stopped me in my tracks when I recently encountered it in an anthology of Arab poetry I randomly pulled out from a library shelf. Devastatingly beautiful.\n\nPoems\n\nBetween us\n\ntwenty years of age\n\nbetween your lips and my lips\n\nwhen they meet and stay\n\nthe years collapse\n\nthe glass of a whole life shatters.\n\nThe day I met you I tore up\n\nall my maps\n\nan my prophecies\n\nlike an Arab stallion I smelled the rain\n\nof you\n\nbefore it wet me\n\nheard the pulse of your voice\n\nbefore you spoke\n\nundid your hair with my hands\n\nbefore you had braided it\n\nThere is nothing I can do\n\nnothing you can do\n\nwhat can the wound do\n\nwith the knife on the way to it?\n\nYour eyes are like a night of rain\n\nin which ships are sinking\n\nand all I wrote is forgotten\n\nIn mirrors there is no memory.\n\nGod how is it that we surrender\n\nto love giving it the keys to our city\n\ncarrying candles to it and incense\n\nfalling down at its feet asking\n\nto be forgiven\n\nWhy do we look for it and endure\n\nall that it does to us\n\nall that it does to us?\n\nWoman in whose voice\n\nsilver and wine mingle\n\nin the rains\n\nFrom the mirrors of your knees\n\nthe day begins its journey\n\nlife puts out to sea\n\nI knew when I said\n\nI love you\n\nthat I was inventing a new alphabet\n\nfor a city where no one could read\n\nthat I was saying my poems\n\nin an empty theater\n\nand pouring my wine\n\nfor those who could not\n\ntaste it.\n\nWhen God gave you to me\n\nI felt that He had loaded\n\neverything my way\n\nand unsaid all His sacred books.\n\nWho are you\n\nwoman entering my life like a dagger\n\nmild as the eyes of a rabbit\n\nsoft as the skin of a plum\n\npure as strings of jasmine\n\ninnocent as children’s bibs\n\nand devouring like words?\n\nYour love threw me down\n\nin a land of wonder\n\nit ambushed me like the scent\n\nof a woman stepping into an elevator\n\nit surprised me\n\nin a coffee bar\n\nsitting over a poem\n\nI forgot the poem\n\nIt surprised me\n\nreading the lines in my palm\n\nI forgot my palm\n\nIt dropped on me like a blind deaf\n\nwildfowl\n\nits feathers became tangled with mine\n\nits cries were twisted with mine\n\nIt surprised me\n\nas I sat on my suitcase\n\nwaiting for the train of days\n\nI forgot the days\n\nI traveled with you\n\nto the land of wonder\n\nYour image is engraved\n\non the face of my watch\n\nIt is engraved on each of the hands\n\nIt is etched on the weeks\n\nmonths years\n\nMy time is no longer mine\n\nit is you\n\nTranslated by Lena Jayyusi and W. S. Merwin"
