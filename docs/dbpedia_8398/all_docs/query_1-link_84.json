        "text": "This poem, the first reading at the Hands Up flagship carol service, is by Nizar Qabbani, a Syrian diplomat and poet, born in Damascus in 1928. Qabbani moved abroad after attaining his law degree from the University of Damascus, working for the Syrian foreign office. Five of the letters he wrote to his mother back in Syria are collected here.\n\nAt St Margaret’s, they opened the service, read to the congregation by the actress Julie Christie. As Qabbani is remembered as a particularly progressive and feminist poetic voice, having Julie read the letters he wrote to his mother was a really lovely way to kick off proceedings.\n\nFive Letters To My Mother (An extract)\n\nBy Nizar Qabbani\n\nGood morning sweetheart.\n\nGood morning my Saint of a sweetheart.\n\nIt has been two years mother since the boy has sailed\n\non his mythical journey.\n\nSince he hid within his luggage\n\nthe green morning of his homeland\n\nand her stars, and her streams,\n\nand all of her red poppies.\n\nSince he hid in his clothes\n\nbunches of mint and thyme,\n\nand a Damascene Lilac.\n\n*\n\nI send my best regards\n\nto a house that taught us love and mercy.\n\nTo your white flowers,\n\nthe best in the neighbourhood.\n\nTo my bed, to my books,\n\nto all of the kids in the alley.\n\nTo all of these walls we covered\n\nwith noise from our writings.\n\nTo the lazy cat sleeping on the balcony.\n\nTo the lilac bush climbing the neighbour’s window.\n\nIt has been two long years, Mother,\n\nwith the face of Damascus being like a bird,\n\ndigging within my conscience,\n\nbiting at my curtains,\n\nand picking, with a gentle beak, at my fingers.\n\nIt has been two years Mother,\n\nsince the nights of Damascus,\n\nthe odours of Damascus,\n\nthe houses of Damascus,\n\nhave been inhabiting our imagination.\n\nThe pillar lights of her mosques,\n\nRing out, As if the pillars of the Amawi,\n\nhave been planted in our hearts.\n\nAs if the orchards are still perfuming our conscience.\n\nAs if the lights and the rocks,\n\nhave all travelled with us.\n\n*\n\nThis is September, Mother,\n\nand here is sorrow bringing me his wrapped gifts.\n\nLeaving at my window his tears and his concerns.\n\nThis is September, where is Damascus?\n\nWhere is Father and his eyes.\n\nWhere is the silk of his glances,\n\nand where is the aroma of his coffee.\n\nMay God bless his grave.\n\nAnd where is the vastness of our large house,\n\nand where is its comfort.\n\nAnd where is the stairwell laughing at the tickles of blooms,\n\nand where is my childhood.\n\nDraggling the tail of the cat,\n\nand eating from the grape vine,\n\nand snipping from the lilac.\n\n**"
