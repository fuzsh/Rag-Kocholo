        "text": "Nizar Qabbani celebrated and honored women in ways Syrian society had never dared before. He once said, “If a man is the sea then a woman is the bridge”. Some of his works incorporated eroticism, and although controversial for its time, he artfully paved the way for such literary works to be recognized as both a natural and liberating concept, receiving overwhelming positivity.\n\nDespite a lot of his work celebrating the holiness of women and his empowering writings, he also wrote many poems lusting over the female body. Such work caused a stir in a conservative society that accused him of immorality and dishonourableness. However, Nizar established himself as an icon loved by many across the Arabic-speaking world, eventually becoming internationally recognized as well.\n\n“The Evil Poem” is one of his most controversial poems which discusses a sexual relationship between two women. It was written from the perspective of one spying on two female lovers. With a lack of awareness, education, and dialogue about gay realities, let alone rights, in Syria, a poetic literary piece discussing a lesbian sexual relationship in the 70s in Syria shattered one of the country’s strictest social norms."
