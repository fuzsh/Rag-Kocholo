        "text": "Today is the final Islamic sabbath before the end of Ramadan. This weekend the Muslims of the world celebrate Eid al-Fitr. You can with them the blessings of the holiday by saying “Eid Mubarak”.\n\nAs a non-Muslim I give some casual observations of what happens during Ramadan. Every year food becomes an issue. I know that when you are fasting all the daylight hours food is going to become a very personal issue. What I mean is how food becomes an issue in the media and in national economics. As the festival of Eid approaches it seems each year that the prices of certain foods increase. Producers looking for a boost in value manipulate supply, warning of dire shortages. This leads to panic buying and stockpiling and adds anxiety in what is already a stressful time. This year with the Russian-Ukraine conflict and the rise in fossil fuel prices the circumstances are being manipulated to gouge the market. The Indonesian government has placed a ban on export of Palm Oil to guarantee domestic supply. The result is an acute shortage in India. Let’s see next week if the shortage is real.\n\nAs with any major holiday traffic becomes a key focus of the media. Golden week in China, Diwali in India, Thanksgiving in the USA, Christmas in Europe. Islamic media this weekend is reporting on the traffic snarls and airport delays as millions of people travel home for the holiday.\n\nWhat happens at Friday prayers! Not universally, but in certain areas, driven by certain Imams, crowds go into the mosque happily on a Friday and come out angry. Some of this translates into fundamentalist zeal for Islam. Several times in London I have found myself nervous of noisy crowds of clearly incited teenage boys emerging from Friday prayers. It makes me curious about what is being said to them in what is supposed to be a religious service for a faith that values peace. My brother lived in Jakarta for seven years in a Western compound. He noted that it was a feature of Friday evenings that from time to time a car would be damaged or someone would dump concrete blocks in the compound swimming pool. Always on a Friday evening and most acute towards the end of Ramadan.\n\nViolence on the Temple Mount. It is an annual ritual that tensions rise at certain times in Jerusalem. This year Easter, Pesach and Ramadan all bumped up against each other. The Christians are blessed that the Romans did not crucify Jesus on the Temple Mount. They have Golgotha to themselves. But Orthodox Jews insist on exercising their “right” to visit the Temple Mount, especially at Pesach. In response Islamic Fundamentalists exercise their “rights” to the Dome of the Rock and the Al Aqsa Mosque by lobbing rocks down onto the Jews worshipping at the Western Wall. They also lob the odd Molotov cocktail. In recent years they have succeeded in setting trees alight in the compound of the Mosques. When Jewish police attempt to keep order they are labelled as fascist oppressors. It is an annual shit show choreographed by blinkered fundamentalists of all persuasions. These are the people who give religion a bad name.\n\nA lesson in Drawing; by Nizar Qabbani\n\nMy son places his paint box in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a bird for him.\n\nInto the color gray I dip the brush\n\nand draw a square with locks and bars.\n\nAstonishment fills his eyes:\n\n‘… But this is a prison, Father,\n\nDon’t you know, how to draw a bird?’\n\nAnd I tell him: ‘Son, forgive me.\n\nI’ve forgotten the shapes of birds.’\n\nMy son puts the drawing book in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a wheatstalk.\n\nI hold the pen\n\nand draw a gun.\n\nMy son mocks my ignorance,\n\ndemanding,\n\n‘Don’t you know, Father, the difference between a\n\nwheatstalk and a gun?’\n\nI tell him, ‘Son,\n\nonce I used to know the shapes of wheatstalks\n\nthe shape of the loaf\n\nthe shape of the rose.\n\nBut in this hardened time\n\nthe trees of the forest have joined\n\nthe militia men\n\nand the rose wears dull fatigues.\n\nIn this time of armed wheatstalks\n\narmed birds\n\narmed culture\n\nand armed religion\n\nyou can’t buy a loaf\n\nwithout finding a gun inside\n\nyou can’t pluck a rose in the field\n\nwithout its raising its thorns in your face\n\nyou can’t buy a book\n\nthat doesn’t explode between your fingers.’\n\nMy son sits at the edge of my bed\n\nand asks me to recite a poem,\n\nA tear falls from my eyes onto the pillow.\n\nMy son licks it up, astonished, saying:\n\n‘But this is a tear, father, not a poem!’\n\nAnd I tell him:\n\n‘When you grow up, my son,\n\nand read the diwan of Arabic poetry\n\nyou’ll discover that the word and the tear are twins\n\nand the Arabic poem\n\nis no more than a tear wept by writing fingers.’\n\nMy son lays down his pens, his crayon box in\n\nfront of me\n\nand asks me to draw a homeland for him.\n\nThe brush trembles in my hands\n\nand I sink, weeping.\n\n-=o0o=-\n\nThis site is available for free and I make no money from any ads you see here.

In astrological terms that makes today the first day of the new astrological year. The first month of the Zodiac calendar is Aries, the Ram. We all love to make fun of horoscopes and the notion that you can predict your future from the rotation of the planet and the precession of the stars.\n\nAt the same time the human brain is pre-programmed to seek patterns in nature. Random chance is a frightening threat, so we seek solace in order and causality. Reading horoscopes is simply a manifestation of the real human need to make sense of our world.\n\nToday is also the first day of the new year in the Bahá’í calendar, a religion from Iran. Year 1 of this calendar begins in 1844 CE making this year 175BE. Though it originates in Iran it is most heavily persecuted there. It is sad that Islam, which was once renowned for its tolerance of other faiths, has become so prohibitive of other peoples beliefs.\n\nSo to poetry and today I have a poem from one of the most famous and best loved Syrian poets. Nizar Qabbani was born on March 21st 1923 in Damascus which he described in his will as “the womb that taught me poetry, taught me creativity and granted me the alphabet of Jasmine“.\n\nThe suicide of his older sister when he was aged 15 had a profound influence on the young Qabbani. She made the ultimate refusal to an arranged marriage. All his life he advocated feminism and an examination of the relationship between men and women in Arabic society.\n\nThe defeat of Syria and the Arab allies in the 6 day war by Israel also had a profound effect on his work and shifted his focus from the poetry of love to the poetry of politics.\n\nA lesson in Drawing; by Nizar Qabbani\n\nMy son places his paint box in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a bird for him.\n\nInto the color gray I dip the brush\n\nand draw a square with locks and bars.\n\nAstonishment fills his eyes:\n\n‘… But this is a prison, Father,\n\nDon’t you know, how to draw a bird?’\n\nAnd I tell him: ‘Son, forgive me.\n\nI’ve forgotten the shapes of birds.’\n\nMy son puts the drawing book in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a wheatstalk.\n\nI hold the pen\n\nand draw a gun.\n\nMy son mocks my ignorance,\n\ndemanding,\n\n‘Don’t you know, Father, the difference between a\n\nwheatstalk and a gun?’\n\nI tell him, ‘Son,\n\nonce I used to know the shapes of wheatstalks\n\nthe shape of the loaf\n\nthe shape of the rose\n\nBut in this hardened time\n\nthe trees of the forest have joined\n\nthe militia men\n\nand the rose wears dull fatigues\n\nIn this time of armed wheatstalks\n\narmed birds\n\narmed culture\n\nand armed religion\n\nyou can’t buy a loaf\n\nwithout finding a gun inside\n\nyou can’t pluck a rose in the field\n\nwithout its raising its thorns in your face\n\nyou can’t buy a book\n\nthat doesn’t explode between your fingers.’\n\nMy son sits at the edge of my bed\n\nand asks me to recite a poem,\n\nA tear falls from my eyes onto the pillow.\n\nMy son licks it up, astonished, saying:\n\n‘But this is a tear, father, not a poem!’\n\nAnd I tell him:\n\n‘When you grow up, my son,\n\nand read the diwan of Arabic poetry\n\nyou’ll discover that the word and the tear are twins\n\nand the Arabic poem\n\nis no more than a tear wept by writing fingers.’\n\nMy son lays down his pens, his crayon box in\n\nfront of me\n\nand asks me to draw a homeland for him.\n\nThe brush trembles in my hands\n\nand I sink, weeping."
