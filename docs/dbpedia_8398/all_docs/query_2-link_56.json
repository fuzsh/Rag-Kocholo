        "text": "24grammata.com/ Μέση Ανατολή\n\nQabbani was revered by generations of Arabs for his sensual and romantic verse. His work was featured not only in his two dozen volumes of poetry and in regular contributions to the Arabic-language newspaper Al Hayat, but in lyrics sung by Lebanese and Syrian vocalists who helped popularize his work.\n\nThrough a lifetime of writing, Qabbani made women his main theme and inspiration. He earned a reputation for daring with the publication in 1954 of his first volume of verse, “Childhood of a Breast,” whose erotic and romantic themes broke from the conservative traditions of Arab literature. The suicide of his sister, who was unwilling to marry a man she did not love, had a profound effect on Qabbani. Thereafter, he expressed resentment of male chauvinism and often wrote from a woman’s viewpoint and advocated social freedoms for women.\n\nHe had lived in London since 1967 but the Syrian capital remained a powerful presence in his poems, most notably in “The Jasmine Scent of Damascus.”\n\nAfter the Arab defeat in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, he founded the Nizar Qabbani publishing house in London, and his became a powerful and eloquent voice of lament for Arab causes.\n\nQabbani was a committed Arab nationalist and in recent years his poetry and other writings, including essays and journalism, had become more political. His writing also often fused themes of romantic and political despair.\n\nQabbani’s later poems included a strong strain of anti-authoritarianism. One couplet in particular — “O Sultan, my master, if my clothes are ripped and torn it is because your dogs with claws are allowed to tear me” — is sometimes quoted by Arabs as a kind of wry shorthand for their frustration with life under dictatorship.\n\nHis second wife, Balqis al-Rawi, an Iraqi teacher whom he had met at a poetry recital in Baghdad, was killed in a bomb attack by pro-Iranian guerrillas in Beirut, where she was working for the cultural section of the Iraqi Ministry.\n\nNizar Qabbani died in London of a heart attack at the age of 75.\n\nA Brief Love Letter\n\nMy darling, I have much to say\n\nWhere o precious one shall I begin ?\n\nAll that is in you is princely\n\nO you who makes of my words through their meaning\n\nCocoons of silk\n\nThese are my songs and this is me\n\nThis short book contains us\n\nTomorrow when I return its pages\n\nA lamp will lament\n\nA bed will sing\n\nIts letters from longing will turn green\n\nIts commas be on the verge of flight\n\nDo not say: why did this youth\n\nSpeak of me to the winding road and the stream\n\nThe almond tree and the tulip\n\nSo that the world escorts me wherever I go ?\n\nWhy did he sing these songs ?\n\nNow there is no star\n\nThat is not perfumed with my fragrance\n\nTomorrow people will see me in his verse\n\nA mouth the taste of wine, close-cropped hair\n\nIgnore what people say\n\nYou will be great only through my great love\n\nWhat would the world have been if we had not been\n\nIf your eyes had not been, what would the world have been?\n\nNizar Qabbani\n\nA Lesson In Drawing\n\nMy son places his paint box in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a bird for him.\n\nInto the color gray I dip the brush\n\nand draw a square with locks and bars.\n\nAstonishment fills his eyes:\n\n‘… But this is a prison, Father,\n\nDon’t you know, how to draw a bird?’\n\nAnd I tell him: ‘Son, forgive me.\n\nI’ve forgotten the shapes of birds.’\n\nMy son puts the drawing book in front of me\n\nand asks me to draw a wheatstalk.\n\nI hold the pen\n\nand draw a gun.\n\nMy son mocks my ignorance,\n\ndemanding,\n\n‘Don’t you know, Father, the difference between a\n\nwheatstalk and a gun?’\n\nI tell him, ‘Son,\n\nonce I used to know the shapes of wheatstalks\n\nthe shape of the loaf\n\nthe shape of the rose\n\nBut in this hardened time\n\nthe trees of the forest have joined\n\nthe militia men\n\nand the rose wears dull fatigues\n\nIn this time of armed wheatstalks\n\narmed birds\n\narmed culture\n\nand armed religion\n\nyou can’t buy a loaf\n\nwithout finding a gun inside\n\nyou can’t pluck a rose in the field\n\nwithout its raising its thorns in your face\n\nyou can’t buy a book\n\nthat doesn’t explode between your fingers.’\n\nMy son sits at the edge of my bed\n\nand asks me to recite a poem,\n\nA tear falls from my eyes onto the pillow.\n\nMy son licks it up, astonished, saying:\n\n‘But this is a tear, father, not a poem!’\n\nAnd I tell him:\n\n‘When you grow up, my son,\n\nand read the diwan of Arabic poetry\n\nyou’ll discover that the word and the tear are twins\n\nand the Arabic poem\n\nis no more than a tear wept by writing fingers.’\n\nMy son lays down his pens, his crayon box in\n\nfront of me\n\nand asks me to draw a homeland for him.\n\nThe brush trembles in my hands\n\nand I sink, weeping.\n\nNizar Qabbani\n\nA Damascene Moon\n\nGreen Tunisia, I have come to you as a lover\n\nOn my brow, a rose and a book\n\nFor I am the Damascene whose profession is passion\n\nWhose singing turns the herbs green\n\nA Damascene moon travels through my blood\n\nNightingales . . . and grain . . . and domes\n\nFrom Damascus, jasmine begins its whiteness\n\nAnd fragrances perfume themselves with her scent\n\nFrom Damascus, water begins . . . for wherever\n\nYou lean your head, a stream flows\n\nAnd poetry is a sparrow spreading its wings\n\nOver Sham . . . and a poet is a voyager\n\nFrom Damascus, love begins . . . for our ancestors\n\nWorshipped beauty, they dissolved it, and they melted away\n\nFrom Damascus, horses begin their journey\n\nAnd the stirrups are tightened for the great conquest\n\nFrom Damascus, eternity begins . . . and with her\n\nLanguages remain and genealogies are preserved\n\nAnd Damascus gives Arabism its form\n\nAnd on its land, epochs materialize\n\nNizar Qabbani\n\nhttp://www.poemhunter.com"
