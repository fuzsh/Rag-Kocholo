        "text": "Nizar Qabbani was a Syrian poet and diplomat who was famous for his romantic, nationalist and feminist poetry. As I have mentioned in an earlier post (Five Letters to My Mother – which is originally the title of a great poet of Qabbani), I have been looking for English translation of another masterpiece of Qabbani titled “Bilqis” . Bilqis was the name of an Iraqi woman who was his second wife. On 15th December 1981, she died in a bomb blast in the Iraqi embassy in Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War. As mentioned on a website, “her death depressed him deeply, and he spent most of his life in Europe after her death“. The following poem (English translation) was reportedly written the same day Bilqis passed away..\n\n——-\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nFor killing my Balqis(1).\n\nGo, have a drink,\n\nOn the martyr’s grave’s brink.\n\nMy poem is assassinated.\n\nFor no nation but ours\n\nHas such powers!\n\nBalqis …\n\nWas the most beautiful of Babel queens.\n\nBalqis …\n\nWas the tallest of all Iraqi palm trees.\n\nShe gracefully walks\n\nAs if followed by oryx and peacocks.\n\nBalqis … You’re my pain…\n\nThe poem’s pain when thumbed.\n\nHow can plants sprout\n\nAfter your hair’s rot?\n\nOh, green Nīnawā,\n\nMy blonde gypsy,\n\nTigris’ waves,\n\nWearing, in spring,\n\nThe best bracelets.\n\nThey killed you…\n\nWhat an Arabs nation\n\nThat enjoys\n\nThe nightingales’ assassination?!\n\nWhere’re a-Samaw’al,\n\nAnd al-Muhalhil(2),\n\nAnd early generous masters?\n\nTribes have eaten tribes.\n\nSnakes have slaughtered snakes.\n\nSpiders have killed spiders.\n\nI swear by your eyes,\n\nWhere a million planet lies.\n\nMy love, I will tell shocking tales about Arabs\n\nIs heroism an Arabs’ lie?\n\nOr, like us, does history heroism falsify?\n\nBalqis,\n\nNever finally rest,\n\nOr the sun\n\nWon’t shine over the coast.\n\nWhen investigated,\n\nI will say:\n\nThe thief takes the role of fighter.\n\nI will say:\n\nThe talented leader becomes a contractor.\n\nI will say:\n\nThe radiation’s tale is the nastiest joke.\n\nWe’re a tribe, like others, under the yoke.\n\nBalqis..\n\nThis is history’s ugly face.\n\nHow can men differentiate between\n\nA garden and a dustbin?\n\nBalqis,\n\nYou’re a martyr, a poem;\n\nChaste and righteous.\n\nQueen of Sheba people search to welcome\n\nIn return, go and hail them.\n\nYou, the greatest of all queens,\n\nA woman who incarnates, all Sumerian Ages.\n\nBalqis..\n\nOf all birds, you’re the delicious.\n\nOf all icons, the most precious.\n\nDear as tears, over Magdalene’s face.\n\nHave I done you injustice,\n\nWhen, once, I moved you from Adhamiyah(3) banks?\n\nEveryday, Beirut kills one of us.\n\nEverywhere, there is death,\n\nIn the cup of coffee,\n\nIn the door key,\n\nIn the terrace flowers,\n\nIn the papers,\n\nIn the alphabet.\n\nHere we are, Balqis\n\nBack again in Jahiliyyah(4).\n\nBack to savagery.\n\nTo backwardness, hideousness and meanness.\n\nBack again to barbarism.\n\nWhere writing is a journey\n\nBetween fragments.\n\nWhere killing a butterfly in its field\n\nIs the case.\n\nDo you know my beloved Balqis?\n\nShe is the most important in love books\n\nA wonderful mix\n\nBetween softness and hardness\n\nThe color of violet in her eyes\n\nTwinkles all times.\n\nBalqis …\n\nIn my memory, you’re the most blest\n\nA grave travelling through the mist.\n\nLike any deer in Beirut, you’re slaughtered\n\nAfter speech had been muzzled.\n\nBalqis..\n\nIt is not a dirge\n\nBut…\n\nIt is a farewell to the Arab age.\n\nBalqis..\n\nWe’re ever pining for you.\n\nAnd the little house asks\n\nAbout his perfumed princess’s whereabouts\n\nWe listen to the news, but it is mysterious\n\nIt leaves us ever curious.\n\nBalqis..\n\nWe’re suffering to the bone.\n\nThe kids don’t know what’s going on.\n\nI don’t know what to say, then?\n\nWould you shortly knock at the door?\n\nWould you take off your winter coat?\n\nWould you come smiling,\n\nAnd like field flowers shining?\n\nBalqis …\n\nThe green plants you grow\n\nAre still on the wall, making a crying show.\n\nYour face is still moving\n\nBetween the mirrors and curtains\n\nEven the cigarette you’re smoking\n\nKeeps its lights\n\nAnd its smoke is hanging.\n\nBalqis …\n\nWe’re very sad at heart,\n\nStruck dumb and shocked\n\nBalqis …\n\nHow did you take away my days, and dreams.\n\nAnd crossed off gardens and seasons?\n\nOh, my wife;\n\nMy love; my poem and my eyesight.\n\nYou were my beautiful bird.\n\nHow did you leave me without a word?\n\nBalqis..\n\nIt’s time for perfumed, well stored Iraqi tea.\n\nMy giraffe, who will serve it gracefully?\n\nWho moved Euphrates to our house?\n\nWho moved Resafa and flowers of Tigris?\n\nBalqis..\n\nGrief penetrates me.\n\nBeirut killed you,\n\nAbout its crime, it never knew.\n\nBeirut loved you; however,\n\nIt ignored killing its lover.\n\nAnd put out moonlight forever.\n\nBalqis …\n\nOh, Balqis …\n\nOh, Balqis …\n\nOver you, every cloud weeps buckets.\n\nWho will cry for me?\n\nBalqis; how did you depart with no sign,\n\nWithout putting your hand in mine?\n\nBalqis..\n\nHow could you leave us twisting in the wind,\n\nTrembling as leaves?\n\nYou left-the three of us-lost,\n\nAs a feather under the rain.\n\nDidn’t you think of me; your lover?\n\nI need your love as much as Zeinab or Omar(5).\n\nBalqis …\n\nYou’re a supernatural treasure,\n\nAn Iraqi Spear,\n\nA bamboo wood.\n\nYou defied stars in their loftiness,\n\nFrom where did you get such strength?\n\nBalqis …\n\nMy friend; my companion,\n\nDecent as a chrysanthemum.\n\nFor us, neither Beirut nor the sea has a space,\n\nNor can we find any suitable place.\n\nBalqis..\n\nYou’re unmatchable,\n\nA unique piece!\n\nBalqis..\n\nI’m tortured by our relation’s gory details.\n\nAnd time hangs heavy, as tough as nails.\n\nEvery little hairpin has a story to tell.\n\nEven your golden hairgrips,\n\nUsually overwhelm me by waves of tenderness.\n\nThe sweet Iraqi voice,\n\nOn curtains,\n\nOn chairs,\n\nOn cutlery,\n\nRests.\n\nYou show up\n\nFrom the mirrors,\n\nFrom the rings,\n\nFrom the poem,\n\nFrom the candles,\n\nFrom the cups,\n\nFrom the purple wine.\n\nBalqis …\n\nOh, Balqis…Oh, Balqis …\n\nIf only you recognized,\n\nThe pain caused by places you once occupied.\n\nIn every corner your spirit hovers as a bird,\n\nFully scented as a Balm wood.\n\nThere you used to smoke.\n\nThere you used to read.\n\nThere, as graceful as a palm tree,\n\nYou got your hair combed.\n\nTo welcome the guests you entered,\n\nAs brisk as a Yemeni sword.\n\nBalqis..\n\nWhere is the Guerlain bottle?\n\nAnd the blue light?\n\nWhere is your Kent cigarette,\n\nWhich is ever in your lips?\n\nWhere is Al Hashmey8 singing\n\nOver such a good stature?\n\nWhen combs remember you,\n\nTheir tears flow.\n\nDo they suffer\n\nAs if they missed a lover?\n\nBalqis: it is difficult to stay cold-blooded,\n\nWhile with tongues of flame\n\nAnd smoke I am surrounded.\n\nBalqis: My princess you are\n\nBurning in a tribe-against- tribe war.\n\nWhat shall I write about my queen’s assassination?\n\nMy poem is but frank self-expression.\n\nAmong piles of victims, we look for\n\nA falling star,\n\nA body shattered as a mirror.\n\nWe wonder, my love:\n\nIs it yours or Arabism’s grave?\n\nOh, Balqis:\n\nYou’re as graceful as a willow tree,\n\nResting your hair locks on me.\n\nYou walk, as a giraffe, in dignity.\n\nBalqis:\n\nIt’s the fate of Arabs\n\nTo be assassinated by Arabs,\n\nTo be gobbled by Arabs,\n\nTo be slain by Arabs,\n\nTo be exhumed by Arabs.\n\nHow can we evade such a fate?\n\nFor an Arab dagger it is all the same,\n\nKilling a gentleman or a madam.\n\nBalqis:\n\nIf they blew you up,\n\nIt’s because all funerals start in Karbala\n\nAnd end in Karbala.\n\nNo more history to read, I’m warned.\n\nMy fingers got burned\n\nAnd my clothes are blood-covered.\n\nHere we are in the Stone Age\n\nEveryday gets us back a thousand years.\n\nIn Beirut the sea\n\nCeases to be, after you did go.\n\nPoetry asks about its poem,\n\nWith incomplete words,\n\nAnd none gives answers.\n\nSadness, Balqis, makes my heart bleed\n\nAs if it were an orange squeezed.\n\nNow; I know the distress of words,\n\nThe plight of impossible language.\n\nI, who have coined letters,\n\nDon’t know how to start this one.\n\nThe sword penetrates into my waist\n\nAnd into that of the sentence.\n\nBalqis, culture in you is rated,\n\nFor a female is culture incarnated.\n\nWho has slain\n\nBalqis, my greatest good omen?\n\nYou prefigure the art of writing.\n\nYou are the island and the lighthouse.\n\nBalqis …\n\nMy lark they buried among stones.\n\nNow I break the cover,\n\nNow I break the cover.\n\nWhen under investigation, I will say:\n\nI know the name…the things…\n\nThe prisoners…\n\nThe martyrs…the poor…and the helpless…\n\nI’ll say I know the killer who put my wife to the sword…\n\nI know all the informers’ faces…\n\nI’ll say: our chastity is debauchery…\n\nAnd our piety is immorality…\n\nI’ll say: our struggle is a lie\n\nAnd there’s no difference\n\nBetween politics and prostitution!!\n\nWhen under investigation, I will say:\n\nI had known the killers.\n\nI’ll say:\n\nOur Arab time is specialized in killing\n\nJasmine,\n\nAll prophets…\n\nAnd all messengers…\n\nEven green eyes\n\nAre devoured by Arabs\n\nEven hair locks; and rings;\n\nBracelets; mirrors; and toys.\n\nEven the stars are afraid of my homeland\n\nFor a reason I can’t understand.\n\nEven the birds fly away\n\nAnd I don’t know why.\n\nEven planets; boats; and clouds,\n\nEven notebooks; and books,\n\nAnd all things of beauty\n\nAre against Arabs.\n\nWhen your seraphic body was shattered,\n\nBalqis,\n\nInto a pearl glittered .\n\nI wondered: Is killing women an Arabic hobby\n\nOr are we originally a crime lobby?\n\nBalqis,\n\nMy beautiful mare…\n\nI’m ashamed of my history, a long nightmare.\n\nIt’s a country where they kill horses.\n\nIt’s a country where they kill horses.\n\nSince you’re slaughtered,\n\nBalqis,\n\nThe sweetest homeland,\n\nOne can’t stand,\n\nLiving in such a homeland.\n\nOne can’t stand,\n\nDying in such a homeland.\n\nI’ve been sweating blood\n\nAnd paying the ultimate price.\n\nTo please the world; but God decides,\n\nTo make me alone,\n\nLike winter’s leaves.\n\nAre poets born to wail,\n\nOr is the poem a stab in the heart\n\nThat can’t heal.\n\nOr I’m the only who cries,\n\nShedding the history of tears from his eyes.\n\nWhen under investigation, I will say:\n\nHow my deer was slain by Abi Lahab(7)’s sword..\n\nAll thieves from the Gulf to the Ocean:\n\nDestroy and burn,\n\nRansack and get bribed,\n\nAnd rape women\n\nAs Abu Lahab likes…\n\nAll dogs are employed,\n\nEating,\n\nAnd getting drunk\n\nAt Abi Lahab’s treat.\n\nNo wheat grows\n\nIf Abu Lahab disapproves.\n\nNo child is born\n\nUntil his mother goes to bed\n\nWith Abi Lahab.\n\nNo prison is open\n\nWithout Abi Lahab’s opinion.\n\nNone is beheaded\n\nWithout Abi Lahab’s command.\n\nWhen under investigation, I will say:\n\nHow my princess was raped.\n\nHow they shared her turquoise -like greenish eyes\n\nAnd her wedding ring.\n\nI’ll say how they did share\n\nHer golden running hair.\n\nWhen under investigation, I will say:\n\nHow they pounced on her copy\n\nOf the Holy Qu’ran\n\nAnd set it on fire.\n\nI’ll say how they made her bleed\n\nHow they got her mouth occupied.\n\nNeither roses nor grapes were left.\n\nIs Balqis slaughter\n\nThe only victory\n\nThroughout Arabs’ history?\n\nBalqis,\n\nThe love of my life.\n\nThe prophets who lie,\n\nSquat on peoples’ head\n\nWith no message to convey.\n\nIf they could regain\n\nFrom sad Palestine\n\nA star;\n\nOr an orange.\n\nIf they could fetch\n\nFrom Gaza’s beach\n\nIn this self-centred,\n\nAmoral,\n\nCoward age.\n\nThe Arab World\n\nIs Crushed; oppressed;\n\nAnd muzzled.\n\nWe represent crime at its best,\n\nSo what’s (al-Iqd al Fareed) or (al-Aghani)?\n\nMy love they grabbed you though we held hands\n\nThey got the poem and left me speechless.\n\nThey got writing; reading;\n\nChildhood; and wishes.\n\nBalqis, oh, Balqis.\n\nYou’re tears dripping over violin’s strings.\n\nI taught your killers the secrets of love,\n\nBut before the end of the course\n\nThey killed my horse.\n\nBalqis:\n\nI ask forgiveness.\n\nMaybe your life was for mine, a sacrifice.\n\nI know well that\n\nyour killers’ aims\n\nwere to kill my words.\n\nMy beautiful, rest in peace\n\nAfter you, poetry will cease\n\nAnd womanhood is out of place.\n\nGenerations of children’s flocks\n\nWill keep asking about your long hair locks.\n\nGenerations of lovers\n\nwill read about you, the true instructor.\n\nOne day the Arabs will get it\n\nThat they killed the prophetess.\n\nThat they killed the prophetess.\n\nKilled the prophetess.\n\nKilled\n\nThe prophets.\n\nNotes:\n\n1 Bilqais is Nizar’s wife for whose tragic death, since she was bombed, he wrote this lament. Bilqais is also the name of the Queen of Sheba as mentioned in the Holy Quran and Islamic traditions.\n\n2 Samaw’al and Al-Muhalhil were two Arab histori- cal figures known for their bravery and generosity.\n\n3 Adhamiyah is a place in Iraq where Bilqais used to live before her marriage to the poet.\n\n4 Jahiliyyah is the pagan age when Arabs wor- shipped statues. The poet debunks Arabs’ complete uncivilized manners and how they behaved as if they were pagan savages.\n\n5 Zeinab and Omar are the children of Nizar and Bilqais.\n\n6 Al Hashmey is a kind of bird which sings at home (a nightingale).\n\n7 Abu Lahab is a historical figure, the prophet’s uncle. His full name was Abd-al-Uzza ibn ‘Abdul Mut- talib. He got that nickname, which literally meant in English “Father of Hell”, because he hated the Muslims and tortured any convert heartlessly. In the poem, it refers to those merciless, unscrupulous people.\n\n8 These are two of the most important books about the history of Arabic culture and literature (Al‘Aqqad Al-Fareed and Al-Aganī)."
