Qabbani is one of the most popular Arab peot in modern age:\n\nSource:\n\nhttp://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/arabic/7206\n\n((Nizar Qabbani was buried today in his hometown of Damascus. Nizar Qabbani is one of the Arab most influential poets. His poems about women and women rights in the Arab world won him both praise and condemnation. He also attacked the Arab regimes as well as the rape of Palestine.\n\nAfter the death of his wife (Balkis - a rose) in Beirut in a car bombing of the Iraqi embassy where she worked, he wrote a devastating poem that expressed his love and longing for his wife and condemnation of the state of the Arab condition. (For those of you who are Star Trek fans, do you remember that entity that was married to a human women and when aliens attacked the planet and killed his wife, in a moment of rage he destroyed them all?

Even many Arab Christian are called ''Jihad'' , ( Jihad Khazen = well known Lebanese Christian journalist). Anyway , this is will be long topic , especially the Arab/Muslims understood it in different way than American show it.\n\nI do not know what you means by the leaders of these groups, but if you mean the Islamic groups, then you are incorrect.\n\nThe main difference between Islamic groups and most of other groups, that the leaders of firs groups are willing to scarify their lives and money for their principles...\n\nFor example:\n\nHizbullah : The son of his leaders was killed in attack against the Israeli occupation army in south Lebanon.\n\nHamas : Most of its leaders were killed by Israeli. They used to be on the fire lines fighting with their soldiers.\n\nEven OBL is very rich person who can live very wealthy life n, but he decided to use his money and his life for his ''ideas''...\n\nAmericans basically translate \"Jihad\" to \"Holy war\", which is, as far as I'm concerned a contradiction in terms with no credibility, it makes no sense. Nothing \"holy\" is associated with violence according to the other religions I'm familiar with. It may not be the best translation, but it is the one that runs around.\n\nSome counter this argument with the the Crusades of the Christians, well, first I probably don't understand them fully, second, they were a failure themselves : Christians and Muslims should have learned the lesson, and third, if all Muslim/Arabs do recognize that a (Holy) \"War\" against America is actually going on (I don't think every Muslims do), then America has quite a right to defend itself in any way it can, and since Islam has no borders, then whether the US goes after Afghanistan, or Iraq or any other countries where Muslims predominate almost becomes irrelevent. Either borders between countries matter, or they don't. The \"terrorist\" groups seem to think they don't (between the arab countries).\n\nThe groups I had in mind are exactly those 3 :, Al Quaeda, Hamas, and Hisbullah.\n\n\"The main difference between Islamic groups and most of other groups, that the leaders of firs groups are willing to scarify their lives and money for their principles...\"\n\nI totally agree with that statement (except I don't think it's all Islamic groups). What I think most Americans don't agree with and frankly don't even respect much is \"sacrify their lives\". This crosses the line. I value life more than any principle. If someone suicides, it don't like it, it is sad, and I can manage to feel for that person. But if someone suicides and brings along people who wish to live, how can I possibly approve of that and admire that person? It defeats the purpose of having a principle. Even Hindus who believe in reincarnation don't do that. Those three groups cannot earn respect from the rest of the world if such actions are acceptable to them. No one wants people like that as their neighboor.\n\nI think there should be some clarification about who Qabbani was and why he should be considered in a more positive light then I see him being considered here.\n\nQabbani had spent most of his life in Lebanon to escape from Hafez Assad (Syrian) Lebanon was for a very long time the \"jewel of the middle east\" with much freedom in the arts as well as many \"western\" ideals, fashions and institutions. Many writers of political pieces found refuge in Lebanon at the time. Qabbani was a supporter of Democracy and against dictatorship, although he was bitter about syria losing the war to Israel and was very anti-Israeli.\n\nAlso, his wife was not just killed by terrorist, he was killed by Syrian supported forces conveniently called \"terrorist\" in the Arab world.\n\nHis poem written after his second wifes death is haunting and I think portrays his beliefs in a more clarifying manner.\n\n1\n\nThank you…\n\nThank you…\n\nFor my love was assassinated…\n\nYou can now have a drink over her grave.\n\nThank you…\n\nThank you…\n\nFor my poem was assassinated…\n\nAnd is there a nation on Earth…save ours…that\n\nassassinates poems?\n\n2\n\nBalqis…\n\nMost beautiful queen in the history of Babel\n\nBalqis…\n\nTallest palm in the land of Iraq\n\nWhen she walked…\n\nPeacocks wandered about her\n\nDeer followed her gait\n\nBalqis…This pain of mine…\n\nThe ache of a poem quivering at the touch of a finger\n\nPray tell…Will the wheat rise again in the fields\n\nNow that your hair in the wind no longer weaves?\n\nOh, green Nineveh...
