        "text": "Lakeview Arena is a 3,100 seat multi-purpose arena located in Marquette, Michigan. It was opened in 1974, during the Marquette Iron Rangers hockey season. The team had previously played in the historic Palestra -- a building that had moved from Laurium, Michigan in 1921 and was torn down shortly after Lakeview opened. From 1976 to 1999, it was the home of Northern Michigan University's hockey program, and it was there in 1990-91 that the Wildcats posted a perfect home record on their way to the 1991 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament.\n\nToday, the building is used for local hockey programs, as well as other events and conventions in the city. It is also home to the Marquette Rangers of the NAHL. It is owned by the city and operated by the Parks & Recreation Department.\n\n[]"
