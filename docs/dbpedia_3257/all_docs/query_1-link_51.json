        "text": "MSU and Michigan hockey face off for the 6th time – with a Frozen Four berth on the line: \"We're excited to play them again.\"\n\nMARYLAND HEIGHTS, Mo. – The most played rivalry in college hockey will get a sixth go-around this season — in an NCAA tournament regional final on Sunday night (6:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2) — after both Michigan State and Michigan won close contests in the regional semifinals on Friday in suburban St. Louis.\n\nNo. 1 seed MSU had a spirited comeback, finding the equalizing goal with less than a minute to play in regulation before MSU senior forward Jeremy Davidson sent Western Michigan home with an overtime winner. The third-seeded Wolverines came back from down 2-1 and then held off a late rally from North Dakota to advance with a 4-3 win.\n\n\"I think for both sides it's exciting and it's great for the Big Ten. And it's a rival for us,\" Michigan coach Brandon Naurato said. \"Michigan State is a really good team and they've proven that, but we're excited to play them again.\"\n\nRELATED: Couch: MSU's Trey Augustine is the youngest goalie in college hockey. He's been unflappable – ever since that first series against Michigan.\n\nStar Michigan defenseman Seamus Casey left the Wolverines' regional semifinal after the first period with an injury and did not return. Likewise, for MSU, defenseman David Gucciardi was absent in the last few minutes of the third period and overtime against Western Michigan with an injury. It's unclear if either player will play Sunday.\n\nJust a week ago, MSU was able to capture the Big Ten Tournament title in overtime against Michigan — winning against the Wolverines for the fourth time in five tries this season — and now the two sides will face off with even more at stake, a berth in the Frozen Four on the line.\n\n\"No matter what, we want to go out there and get the job done and that's what we plan on doing,\" MSU freshman forward Gavin O'Connell said before the Michigan-North Dakota game had been played. \"We've played Michigan a handful of times and I think it would be cool to play North Dakota. It's always good to beat Michigan and if they're the team, we'll go do that.\"\n\nRevisiting the rivalry this season\n\nIn five meetings this season, MSU is 4-1 against the Wolverines. Here's a look back at those matchups:\n\nJanuary 19: Michigan 7, MSU 1 at Munn Ice Arena – MSU had not lost in regulation since the end of October before Michigan came into Munn and trounced the Spartans. MSU amassed 94 total penalty minutes, including two major penalties and Michigan scored four power-play goals.\n\nJanuary 20: MSU 7, Michigan 5 at Yost Ice Arena – For the first 30 minutes, it looked like a repeat of the prior night, with Michigan leading 4-1 midway through the second period. But MSU rallied, scoring four goals in the second period to take a lead, then added insurance in the third period to complete the comeback.\n\nFebruary 9: MSU 5, Michigan 1 at Yost Ice Arena – Michigan opened the scoring in the second period, but MSU's Tanner Kelly answered less than 30 seconds later to equalize. MSU was dominant in the third period, scoring twice before adding two empty net goals.\n\nFebruary 10: MSU 3, Michigan 2 at Little Caesars Arena – MSU was able to capture its first \"Duel in the D\" trophy since 2016. Kelly opened the scoring in this one and MSU led 3-1 after two periods before holding off a late push from Michigan in the third period.\n\nMarch 23: MSU 5, Michigan 4 (OT) at Munn Ice Arena – In one of the biggest games ever played at Munn Ice Arena, MSU captured a Big Ten Tournament title when freshman defenseman Patrick Geary rang a point shot off the post and into the net in overtime.\n\nContact Nathaniel Bott at nbott@lsj.com and follow him on Twitter @Nathaniel_Bott"
