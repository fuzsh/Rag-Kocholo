        "text": "MOORHEAD, Minn. – The 2023 Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) Men's Hockey Playoffs got underway on Friday night. No. 5 St. Olaf picked up right where it left off last postseason by pulling off an upset victory, this time against No. 4 Concordia, 4-3, in Moorhead. The Oles have now won five straight MIAC Playoff games on the road as the lower seed.\n\nSt. Olaf will move on to the semifinal round where they will face No. 1 seeded St. Scholastica at Mars Lakeview Arena in Duluth on Sunday night at 7:00 p.m. The other half of the semifinal round will be played on Saturday night in Minneapolis, as No. 2 Augsburg hosts No. 3 Saint John's at 7:00 p.m.\n\nNO. 5 ST. OLAF 4, NO. 4 CONCORDIA 3 | Box Score |\n\nSt. Olaf scored two goals in the second period and two more in the third to outduel Concordia, 4-3, on the Cobbers' home ice on Friday night. Jaret Lalli got the Cobbers on the board early with an even-strength goal just past the three-minute mark. St. Olaf answered with two goals in the second, scored by Matthew Pointer and Tyler Cooper. Caden Triggs evened things up with a Concordia power-play goal five minutes into the third period, but two more St. Olaf goals by Keljah McElroy and Troy Bowditch over the next five minutes put the game out of reach. Mason Plante kept the Cobbers' hopes alive with an even-strength score at 16:26 in the third. The Oles are now semifinal-bound for the second straight season in their bid for a repeat MIAC playoff title.\n\nWEEKEND SEMIFINAL MATCHUPS SET\n\nThe 2023 MIAC Men's Hockey Playoffs will continue with two semifinal contests over the weekend.\n\nNo. 3 Saint John's at No. 2 Augsburg | Saturday, February 25 | 7:00 PM |\n\nAugsburg claimed the edge in the regular season series with Saint John's by a margin of 4-2 in the standings points thanks to a regulation win while the Johnnies picked up a victory in overtime. The Auggies have had the Johnnies' number in the postseason, earning a 5-0 record in the playoff series since 1998; however, the two teams have met in the Playoffs three times since 2016 with each game being decided by one goal, and two contests needing at least three overtimes to determine a victor.\n\nNo. 5 St. Olaf at No. 1 St. Scholastica | Sunday, February 26 | 7:00 PM |\n\nThe Saints swept the regular season series against St. Olaf with a pair of regulation victories. This will be the first-ever MIAC Playoff matchup between the two programs. The Oles are the defending MIAC playoff champions, while St. Scholastica claimed its first-ever regular season MIAC title last weekend.\n\nThe two semifinal winners will meet in the MIAC Men's Hockey Playoff Championship Game, which is tentatively set for 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 4 on the home ice of the highest remaining seed. The MIAC Playoff champion will receive the postseason championship plaque and the conference's automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA Division III Men's Hockey Tournament.\n\n2023 MIAC MEN'S HOCKEY PLAYOFF SCHEDULE\n\nQuarterfinals | Friday, Feb. 24, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nNo. 5 St. Olaf 4, No. 4 Concordia | Box Score |\n\nSemifinals | Saturday, Feb. 25, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nNo. 3 Saint John's at No. 2 Augsburg\n\nSemifinals | Sunday, Feb. 26, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nNo. 5 St. Olaf at No. 1 St. Scholastica\n\nChampionship | Saturday, Mar. 4, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nHighest remaining seed will host"
