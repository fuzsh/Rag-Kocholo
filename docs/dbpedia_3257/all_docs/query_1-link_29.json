        "text": "MEDFORD, MA (March 3, 2024) - Arguably the best season in Tufts University hockey history continues this afternoon when the Jumbos face Trinity College in the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) Championship Game at Koeppel Community Sports Center in Hartford. Face-off is at 2 PM. 2024 NESCAC MEN'S ICE HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP GAME\n\nSunday, March 3, 2024\n\nat Trinity College, 2:00 pm\n\nLocation: Hartford, CT – Koeppel Community Sports Center (175 New Britain Ave, Hartford, CT 06106)\n\nCoverage: LIVE VIDEO – LIVE STATS – CHAMPIONSHIP WEBSITE Three Jumbo teams have won as many or more than this 2023-24 group, but none have had the post-season results that these Jumbos have earned as they head into the first conference final in school history. Head coach Pat Norton's team earned a berth into the championship game with their first-ever NESCAC semifinal win, 1-0 against Hamilton College on Saturday.\n\nTufts has overcome an 0-4-1 start to the season. From there they went on an eight-game winning streak which was the longest at Tufts since the 1994-95 squad won a school-record 11 straight games. Since going winless in their first five games, the Jumbos are 14-5-2 for a .690 winning percentage. The team has only lost twice in regulation since the start of December.\n\nYesterday they defeated a Hamilton squad that had a 9-1-1 recent series advantage between the teams entering the game. Senior goalie Peyton Durand stopped 45 shots for his third shutout of he year, and junior Tyler Sedlak scored his 15th goal of the season in the second period as the Jumbos advanced.\n\nTufts will have its work cut out for them today against a Trinity squad that is ranked fourth in the U.S. College Hockey Online Division III poll. The Bantams' 22-4-1 record is tied for the third-most wins in school history and they are on a 10-game winning streak overall. Playing in their 11th conference championship game - including seven of the last eight - the Bantams are going for their seventh NESCAC title.\n\nThe weekend hosts were tied 2-2 with Middlebury College in yesterday's other semifinal before scoring three times late in the third for a 5-2 victory. Connor Sedlak - Tyler's brother - had a goal and two assists, Gerard Marretta scored twice and Bobak finished with 13 saves.\n\nTrinity won both of this year's regular-season match-ups against Tufts, 5-1 in the season-opener back on November 17 in Malden and 3-1 in Hartford on January 17. The Bantams have won 14 of the last 16 games (14-1-1) in the series.\n\nStatistically, the Jumbos rank third defensively in NESCAC allowing 2.23 goals per game and they are fourth in scoring with 2.92 goals per contest. Trinity leads the conference in both categories with 1.31 goals against and 3.46 scored.\n\nTufts' three All-Conference honorees this season - Sedlak, sophomore forward Max Resnick and senior defenseman Sam Miller - are the most ever for the Jumbos. The team is solidly built from the goal out, with senior netminder Peyton Durand bringing a .940 save percentage and 2.07 goals against average into today's game.\n\nThe Bantams had five All-Conference honorees, including the NESCAC Player of the Year Devon Bobak in goal (.937 SV% and 1.29 GAA). Senior defensemen Ned Blanchard - the league's Defensive Player of the Year - and John Campomenosi were first team selections, as was junior forward Richard Boysen. Senior forward Kyle Tomaso was second team.\n\nThe winner of the conference championship will earn the NESCAC's automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament.\n\nGet information on purchasing tickets to today's game HERE.\n\n--JUMBOS--\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
