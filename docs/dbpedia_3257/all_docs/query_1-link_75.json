Less than a week later, Penn State travels to the Duquesne Gardens once more, and falls to Pittsburgh, 2-1.\n\nJANUARY 21, 1910\n\nUniversity’s Athletic Association rejects an official bid to sponsor ice hockey as an official varsity sport. Penn State students fight to elevate the program for the next two decades.\n\nWINTER 1938\n\nEight members of the Sigma Phi fraternity form an independent hockey team.\n\nFEBRUARY 1938\n\nOn Feb. 12, the team plays an exhibition game against Lakemont, an independent amateur team, in Altoona, Pennsylvania, with Al Hook, a physical education professor, serving as team coach. Ten days later, the independent squad suits up for its first intercollegiate game against Pittsburgh at the Duquesne Gardens, losing 4-0.\n\n1938-39 SEASON\n\nPrior to the start of the 1938-39 campaign, Dr. Carl P. Schott, Dean of the School of Physical Education and Athletics, approves appropriations of $100 for the team.\n\nDr. Arthur F. Davis, who also coached the first four seasons of varsity hockey at Penn State, is named the team’s head coach. In the beginning of the season, the team practices indoors at the Armory building or outside on the pond at Whipple Dam, and plays three games.\n\n1939-40 SEASON\n\nPenn State joins the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate League with the University of Pennsylvania, Hershey Jr. Cubs, Lehigh and Lafayette.\n\nDuring the season, Rec Hall becomes the team’s indoor practice facility. The team’s “home” rink was more than 100 miles away in Hershey. Penn State plays its first true home contest Jan. 27, when the team was finally able to play on flooded tennis courts. Three hundred bleachers were also put in for the event.\n\nThe team competes in 11 games during the season and compiled a 3-8-0 record.\n\nTHE FIRST VARSITY ERA\n\nMARCH-MAY 1940\n\nHockey and skiing are put before the students at the All-College Elections. Two months later, hockey is voted as an official varsity sport as the Athletic Association approved the measure by a 651-35 majority vote.\n\nDECEMBER 6, 1940\n\nPenn State plays its first game as a varsity sport at the Shaffer Ice Palace in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. The Nittany Lions defeat Carnegie Tech, 3-1, with John Dufford scoring the first goal in Penn State varsity history.\n\nAfter the first season, the University’s Athletic Advisory Board granted hockey full status with full financial support. Up until that time, the team was able to make its own schedule and handle its own finances. The team uses Rec Hall as its practice facility as several attempts for an outdoor rink throughout the years is unsuccessful.\n\n1940-44 SEASONS\n\nAlthough there is on-ice success, the United States’ involvement in World War II, combined with the lack of availability of ice on campus, has a devastating effect on the viability of Penn State Hockey.\n\nWith many teams dropping the sport, Penn State only plays four games during the 194243 season, including just two collegiate contests.\n\nRavaged by the war, Coach Davis and Penn State prepared for the 1943-44 season with only three members from the previous year’s squad after losing most of its members to military and civilian enrollment.\n\nWith the effects of the war being felt throughout the University, the Athletic Association announces that the suspensions of six sports as a war-time economy measure: hockey, cross country, swimming, gymnastics, tennis and golf.\n\n1946-47 SEASON\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, the team returns for one final season. James O’Hora, a new addition to the football coaching staff, is selected to lead Penn State for the 194647 season. The Nittany Lions are scheduled to play seven games, but four contests are eventually cancelled due to warm weather.\n\nFollowing the season, the Athletic Association drops hockey once more, citing limited facilities.\n\nIt will be 25 years until organized hockey returns to Penn State.\n\nICERS ALL-TIME RECORD\n\nYear Record Coaches 1971-72 13-6-0 Larry Hendry\n\n1972-73 10-11-0 J.
