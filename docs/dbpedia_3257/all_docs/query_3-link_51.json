        "text": "St. Scholastica and Wisconsin-Superior renew their Twin Ports rivalry to open the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association men's playoff season Friday and Saturday at Mars Lakeview Arena. Both games are 7:05 p.m.\n\nNo. 4-ranked St. Scholastica (17-4-4) finished second among seven teams in the NCHA regular-season standings, while Superior (9-11-5) finished last. The NCHA quarterfinals are two-game series with a mini-game if necessary.\n\nSt. Norbert College of DePere, Wis., won its 11th NCHA regular-season title in 14 years and has a first-round bye. The Saints were four points behind St. Norbert in the final standings. The No. 3 Green Knights (19-3-3) have also won eight of the last nine league regular-season titles, finishing fourth in 2009 behind champion UWS.\n\nSt. Scholastica defeated UWS in all three meetings this season -- 6-3, 3-0 and 4-1 (Thursday in Superior). The rivals last met in the league playoffs in 2007, with the Saints advancing with a mini-game victory.\n\nUMD tied for ninth in PairWise\n\nThe Minnesota Duluth men, idle last weekend, are tied for ninth in the Division I PairWise Rankings, which mimic the NCAA tournament 16-team selection process. From the Western Collegiate Hockey Association, Denver is No. 2, Wisconsin No. 3, St. Cloud State No. 4 and Colorado College No. 7. Tied with UMD (18-11-1) are New Hampshire, Michigan State and Vermont.\n\nThe Bulldogs play Friday and Saturday at No. 13 North Dakota (14-11-5)."
