        "text": "Excited to dive into the fundamentals of sales! üöÄ Whether it's mastering the art of negotiation or building lasting client relationships, understanding the core principles is key. Royale Union Saint-Gilloise SCRL gave me the chance to analyse their sales department as part of my studies. It‚Äôs fantastic to be able to combine my passion for football with school and take a look behind the scenes of such an fascinating club. Ready to elevate my sales game and drive results! #SalesFundamentals #ContinuousLearning Simon Verhoeven Cas Baeten\n\nI have been following Jesse Cole and the The Savannah Bananas' road to fame for a few years. I lived in Savannah when the Sand Gnats called Grayson Stadium home and I remember being in disbelief when one of my friends told me Savannah's new baseball team had chosen to be called the Bananas. The Sand Gnats never had much of a following and I thought there was no way a Banana was doing to do any better. On Saturday, they sold-out Fenway Park and tonight they begin a 3 night stretch here in Nashville, also sold-out. If you haven't read about or watched the ESPN docuseries about the Bananas, Jesse and the team's story is pretty inspiring. In 2015 their bank account overdraft and today they generate over $10m in revenue a year, selling out every game since the inaugural season. Here are some of the takeaways as it relates to sales: ‚óæ Success is often found at the point most people would have given up. Keep pushing. ‚óæ Customer experience has the largest impact on customer retention. ‚óæ Know and believe in your value proposition. So today in the words of Mr. Cole, get out there and \"stop chasing customers and start creating fans\". Happy Thursday and Happy Hunting.... #sales #salesleadership #transportation #savannahbananas\n\nOur Employee Spotlight for March is Alexander Lessard!

I am seeing this photo posted many times as evidence that analysis can lead to better decisions. It is true that the water bottle used by England's goalkeeper correctly predicted that Pickford should dive right for Akanji's penalty and the resulting save won the game. It is, however, also true that the bottle suggested that Pickford should ‚ÄúFake Right - Dive Left‚Äù for Schar‚Äôs penalty but Pickford chose to fake left and dive right while the ball went where the bottle predicted. So is the real story that analysis can help make winning decisions or is the real story that success could be even stronger if clients fully trusted the evidence and listened to analysts!?

Inventory continues to be a struggle in Brunswick, Ohio but the news isn‚Äôt all bad! In fact just like the #1 record in all of baseball right now, The Cleveland Indians, Brunswick, Ohio sellers are #winning! Brunswick sellers are on average receiving 103% of list price! That‚Äôs right we are seeing multiple offers again! And it‚Äôs the height of selling season! Buyers want to get in their new homes before the new school year starts. Does that mean buyers are losing? Not at all! Interest rates are down and with a point paid buyers can achieve a 6.75% rate making those 103% of sale prices a bit more affordable. Curious about buying or selling and not quite sure what to do? Reach out or leave a comment and we‚Äôll get a meeting scheduled to discuss your options and put together an individualized plan! #marketupdate #brunswickmarketupdate #brunswickohio #brunswickohiorealestate #brunswickohiorealtor #brunswickrealestate #brunswickrealtor #brunswickrealtors #thersvpgroup #thersvpgrouprealtors #invitingyoutoamovingexperience #exprealty #reneethersvpgroup #reneevelasquez #reneetherealtor\n\nJust want to give a proper shout out to Blake, Alec Baldwin‚Äôs legendary character in Glengary Glen Ross! Blake appears in one scene for less than 10 minutes, but manages to leave a lasting impression. No question that Blake is brash and, just maybe, a bit of a jerk. However, Blake speaks to the soul of entrepreneurs and salespeople. If you want to survive in the business, you gotta close (i.e., produce results). No free rides jn the long run, so Blake‚Äôs throwing down of the gauntlet could indeed be seen as a ‚Äúmission of mercy‚Äù. Sales is the closest thing we have to the sports world in terms of reflecting a results-based meritocracy, and Blake lays that bare (in superlatively over the top fashion). Am I excited to be a dad? Hell yeah! But as Blake put it (and reality will reinforce): ‚ÄúGood father? F*** you! Go home and play with your kids. You wanna work here? Close!‚Äù Who doesn‚Äôt want to be judged in objective fashion (based on results) and know exactly where they stand? I appreciate Blake‚Äôs honesty, even if his bedside manner could use a little work. #sales #franchising #franchiselaw #alwaysbeclosing #abc #AIDA #coffeeisforclosersonly #missionofmercy #secondprize #boxofsteakknives #competition #results #glengaryleads #gold #sales #linkedinsports"
