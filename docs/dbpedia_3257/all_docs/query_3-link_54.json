        "text": "Follow Coach Boss on Twitter\n\nJake Boss Jr. was appointed the 16th head coach in Michigan State baseball history on July 1, 2008, and has quickly become one of the most successful coaches in the program’s 130-year history.\n\nIn 16 seasons at MSU, Boss has compiled a 440-381 (.536) record. His 440 wins are not only the most over a 16-year span in program history, but he also become the third Michigan State baseball coach to reach 400 Victories for MSU, earning his 400th win in the Spartans' 7-1 Victory for MSU over Ohio State on April 7, 2023 at Jackson Field in Lansing. Boss joined John H. Kobs (576 wins; 1935-63) and Danny Litwhiler (489 wins; 1964-82) as the only Spartan baseball head coaches with 400 wins at Michigan State.\n\nFive of the 10 winningest seasons in MSU history have come under Boss’ direction. He has guided the Spartans to 30-win seasons in eight of the last 14 completed seasons, as well as the Big Ten regular-season championship in 2011 and the NCAA Tournament in 2012.\n\nOverall, Boss collected career win No. 400 on April 24, 2022 in the Spartans' 11-7 Victory for MSU at Northwestern, and has a 465-415 (.528) record in 17 seasons as a collegiate head coach, with 440 wins in his 16 seasons at MSU (2009-pres.), and 25 wins in his lone season at Eastern Michigan (2008).\n\nDuring Boss’ tenure at Michigan State, MSU has had 38 selections in the Major League Baseball Draft, including three or more in seven of the last 12 years. Three Spartans were drafted in 2023, marking the first time that MSU had three draft selections in the same draft since 2019, with Mitch Jebb (2nd round, Pittsburgh Pirates), Brock Vradenburg (3rd round, Miami Marlins) and Bryan Broecker (13th round, Tampa Bay Rays).\n\nThe three Spartans selected in the first 13 rounds in the most since 2016 when three MSU players were selected in the first 10 rounds. Jebb's second-round selection and Vradenburg's third-round selection marked the first time that two Spartans were selected in the first three rounds of the June Amateur MLB Draft since 1969 when Rick Miller and Harry Kendrick were both chosen in the second round.\n\nOne Michigan State player was selected in the 2021 draft: Mason Erla (17th round, Los Angeles Angels). Three Spartans were selected in the 2019 draft: Mitchell Tyranski (12th round, Los Angeles Dodgers), pitcher Indigo Diaz (27th round, Atlanta Braves) and infielder Marty Bechina (32nd round, Oakland Athletics).

No awards were presented after the 2020 season was shortened due to COVID-19 pandemic. The Spartans had three all-Big Ten honorees in 2018, as freshmen Mason Erla and Zach Iverson were both named to the All-Freshman Team, with Erla earning the honors at pitcher and Iverson being tabbed to the list as both a third baseman and utility player. The 2017 season saw second baseman Dan Durkin, center fielder Brandon Hughes, designated hitter Chad Roskelly and pitcher Alex Troop all tabbed to the All-Big Ten second team list, while outfielder Bryce Kelley was named to the all-freshman team. In 2011, a school-record eight Spartans earned All-Big Ten honors. The six first-team All-Big Ten selections in 2011 were the most in program history and featured Player of the Year Jeff Holm, Pitcher of the Year Kurt Wunderlich and Big Ten batting champion Brandon Eckerle.\n\nThe Spartans have had equal success in the classroom, as MSU baseball has earned a total of 225 Academic All-Big Ten honors, with 19 players garnering recognition in 2024, along with 78 Big Ten Distinguished Scholars since the first year of presenting them in 2009, with six players honored in 2024.

He was the first since 1974 when Dale Frietch also earned Third-Team Athletic All-American accolades and First-Team Academic All-American honors.\n\nUnder Coach Boss as Spartan head coach, Michigan State has earned the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Team Academic Excellence Award in seven-straight seasons from 2017-2023.\n\nCoach Boss has also coached two Big Ten Medal of Honor recipients, with Brandon Eckerle earning the award in 2011 and Bryce Kelley collecting the accolade in 2021.\n\nKelley was a five-time letterwinner (2017-21), and became a four-time Big Ten Distinguished Scholar honoree, as well as an Academic All-Big Ten selection. He earned CoSIDA Google Cloud Academic First-Team All-District® accolades in both 2020 and 2021. Kelley also was the recipient of the MSU Student-Athlete Support Services Scholar-Athlete Award for 2021 for having the highest GPA on the baseball team, and he also is a three-time honoree of Highest Honors for MSU Athletics Honor Roll.\n\nOn the field, Kelley led MSU and ranked sixth in the B1G with 11 stolen bases. Kelley became the new MSU career stolen base king this season, as he broke the record on April 11 vs. Purdue, swiping his 80th career base, passing Anthony Cheky's previous record of 79 from 2012-15. Kelley's record-setting moment was No. 5 on NCAA Baseball's Player of the Week. Kelley padded his record and finished his Spartan career with 83 swipes. At the plate, Kelley also led the team and ranked third in the B1G with 30 walks, as well as ranking sixth in the league in walks/game (0.68). Kelley also finished third on the team in runs scored (26).\n\nIn 2024, Michigan State celebrated not only its 140th year of baseball, but also honored the 70th anniversary of the 1954 College World Series team.\n\nMSU finished with a 24-27 overall record and 11-13 ledger in B1G action, missing the Big Ten Tournament by one game. One of the highlights from the 2024 season was the Spartans' win at Georgia on Feb. 28, knocking off the Bulldogs, 19-6 in a seven-inning run-rule rout of UGA, that not only dealt the Bulldogs their first loss the season, but also dealt UGA its first home loss of the season, snapping the Bulldogs’ seven-game home win streak, and was their lone home loss until April 12, and UGA was 33-3 at home before dropping its last two games of the season at home to eventual CWS team Florida, finishing 33-5. The Spartans were the lone non-conference team to beat UGA, as their other four home losses were to SEC teams. It was the Spartans’ first win over an SEC team since beating Auburn, 3-0, on March 5, 2016. The win was also MSU’s first victory over an SEC team on their home field since March 9, 2013, winning at Kentucky.\n\nMichigan State scored 10+ runs in 14 games for the second-straight season, while also limiting the opposition to two or fewer runs in 10 games also for the second year in a row.\n\nThe 2023 season saw the Spartans post a 33-22 record, finishing eighth in the Big Ten Conference with a 12-12 league mark and qualifying for the B1G Tournament in Omaha, where the Spartans finished sixth. MSU's 33 wins were its most since 36 in 2016.\n\nThe Spartans' B1G Tournament run came to close after going 1-2 in Omaha.

The Huskers pulled away for a 4-0 win over Michigan State to eliminate MSU.\n\nThe Spartans have won at least one game in six of the eight visits to the B1G Tournament under head coach Jake Boss Jr., as Michigan State was making its first appearance in the B1G Tournament since 2018, and no player on the Spartans' 2023 roster had been to the conference tournament. Overall, MSU made its 15 appearance including its eighth under Coach Boss.\n\nMichigan State led not just the Big Ten, but also the NCAA in triples with 30, the most in the B1G in the 2000s and also leading the league in three-baggers for the second-straight season after knocking 20 triples in 2022. The Spartans also topped both the conference and the country in 2023 for triples per game with 0.55.\n\nBrock Vradenburg led MSU while ranking second in the B1G and 24th in the NCAA in batting average exactly a .400 average, becoming the first Spartan to hit .400 or better since 2002 and becoming the 28th member of MSU's \".400 Club.\" The Spartan first baseman was the first member of the club since 2002 when Brady Burrill (.414), Chris McCuiston (.404) and Bob Malek (.402) all hit over .400.\n\nBoss also specializes in coaching the Spartan catchers, and in 2022, sophomore catcher Bryan Broecker led the B1G in caught stealing for the second-straight season, throwing out 20 potential base stealers, seven more than the second spot. In conference only contests, Broecker had seven caught stealing, ranking second in the league by one. Broecker earned Second-Team All-Big Ten accolades.\n\nSix Spartans collected Big Ten accolades in 2023, as junior infielder Brock Vradenburg collected First Team All-Big Ten honors, while senior relief pitcher Wyatt Rush, junior infielder Trent Farquhar and redshirt-sophomore catcher Bryan Broecker were named to Second Team All-Big Ten. Junior infielder Mitch Jebb was tabbed to the Third Team All-Big Ten list, while pitcher Joseph Dzierwa was named to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team. Rush was also named MSU's Sportsmanship Award honoree.\n\nFollowing the season, three Spartans were drafted in 2023, marking the first time that MSU had three draft selections in the same draft since 2019, with Mitch Jebb (2nd round, Pittsburgh Pirates), Brock Vradenburg (3rd round, Miami Marlins) and Bryan Broecker (13th round, Tampa Bay Rays). Additionally, Trent Farquhar signed a non-drafted free agent contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nThe three Spartans selected in the first 13 rounds in the most since 2016 when three MSU players were selected in the first 10 rounds. Jebb's second-round selection and Vradenburg's third-round selection marked the first time that two Spartans were selected in the first three rounds of the June Amateur MLB Draft since 1969 when Rick Miller and Harry Kendrick were both chosen in the second round.\n\nIn 2022, Michigan State logged a 24-30 overall record and an 8-16 Big Ten mark. MSU had a season-long six-game win streak from April 24-May 1, which matched the Spartans' longest since a six-game win spurt April 18-27, 2018. Michigan State had nine come-from-behind wins on the season, as well as six wins in one-run contests, part of 11 total one-run games, along with eight games decided by two runs. The Spartans were also 9-0 in games scoring 10+ runs.\n\nIndividual highlights from 2022 included sophomore infielder Mitch Jebb ranking among the conference leaders in hitting, finishing the regular-season ranked ninth in the league with a .356 average. Jebb also led the B1G and ranked 17th in the NCAA in toughest to strikeout - with just one K every 13.7 ABs - on just 16 Ks in 219 ABs. Additionally, Jebb was eighth in the conference with 20 stolen bases. Junior outfielder Casey Mayes also led the Big Ten and ranked tied for third in the NCAA with seven triples. Graduate senior reliever Kyle Bischoff led the Big Ten and ranked tied for 12th in the NCAA with 12 saves. The 12 saves ranks Bischoff second on MSU's single-season saves list.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Coach Boss in 2022, along with being tabbed to the Big Ten All-Freshman Team, redshirt-freshman catcher Bryan Broecker led the B1G in caught stealing by nabbing 22 stolen base attempts, six more than the second spot. In B1G only action, Broecker threw out 11 base stealing attempts, also leading the league and posting three more than the number two spot.\n\nFive Spartans were recognized by the Big Ten Conference with postseason awards, as sophomore infielder Mitch Jebb and graduate senior relief pitcher Kyle Bischoff both garnered All-Big Ten Third Team accolades, while redshirt-freshman catcher Bryan Broecker and freshman pitcher Ryan Szczepaniak were both tabbed to the All-Freshman Team.

After opening the season in early March, MSU was in 13 games decides by two runs or less, with seven 1-run games and five other 2-run contests. Of those 13 games, four were on walk-off losses.\n\nSophomore outfielder Zaid Walker was tabbed to the All-Big Ten Third Team list, while freshman infielder Mitch Jebb and freshman pitcher Nick Powers were both named to the All-Freshman Team. Senior infielder Andrew Morrow was MSU's Sportsmanship Award honoree.\n\nFollowing the season, pitcher Mason Erla was selected in the 17th round of the 2021 Major League Baseball Draft. Erla was selected in the 17th round (pick number 501) by the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nErla posted five wins in 13 starts in the 2021 season, leading MSU in 79.2 IP, ringing up a team-leading 80 strikeouts, which ranked tied for 10th in the B1G. He also ranked 10th in the conference with a 3.50 ERA. Erla was the Robin Roberts Most Valuable Pitcher MSU team award recipient for the second-straight season.\n\nIn 2020, MSU got off to a 9-6 start after the first four weekends away from home, including opening the season 4-0 and later having another four-game win streak, before the rest of the season was canceled due to the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.\n\nDespite the shortened season, pitcher Mason Erla was named a Second-Team All-American by Collegiate Baseball. Erla posted a 2-0 record with a paltry 1.04 ERA in four starts, firing 42 strikeouts with only four overall runs allowed, with three earned, and just six walks in 26.0 IP.

The Spartans battled through and got hot in the later part of the season, winning three of its last four B1G series, including two on the road. Michigan State also had three wins over Top 25 teams down the stretch, with a pair of wins at No. 24 Iowa on May 11 and 12, and a win over No. 23 Illinois on May 17. MSU posted a record of 20-34 overall and 8-15 in Big Ten play.\n\nSenior outfielder Dan Chmielewski was named to the 2019 Google Cloud Academic All-America® Baseball Team as selected by College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA).

MSU opened the year winning 20 of its first 25 games, the best 25-game start since 1971, and racked up an 11-game winning streak during that stretch, the longest since 2004. MSU's strong start garnered national attention, as the Spartans received votes in the national polls. Although the Spartans narrowly missed a bid to the Big Ten Tournament on the last day of the regular season, MSU was rewarded with seven players on the All-Big Ten Team. Leading the way was shortstop Jonathan Roof, MSU's first All-Big Ten first-team selection since 2006. Second baseman Ryan Jones earned Big Ten Freshman of the Year honors, becoming only the second player in program history to win the award.\n\nIn addition, two Spartans - Roof (eighth round, Texas) and A.J. Achter (46th round, Minnesota) - were chosen in the 2010 MLB First-Year Player Draft in June.\n\nIn Boss' first season, he led the Green and White to its highest Big Ten finish in five years and its first trip to the Big Ten Tournament since 2004.\n\nUnder Boss' direction in 2009, the Spartans won their most games at home (15) and matched their longest conference-game winning streak (7) in the previous five seasons. The 2009 season also marked the opening of McLane Baseball Stadium at Kobs Field.\n\n\"I believe in order to be successful and develop our players throughout their careers, we will focus on four main areas in each of their lives: academics and the effort to learn and graduate; character on and off the field; team philosophy and the effort and will to win; and career goals both at Michigan State University and beyond,\" said Boss when he was hired. \"Our players will play hard, compete, and most importantly, trust each other to be successful. We will build our program on relationships and a family atmosphere throughout our team consisting of both current and former players.\"\n\nIn just one season as head coach at Eastern Michigan in 2008, Boss made an immediate impact, guiding the Eagles to their second consecutive MAC West Division crown and first NCAA Regional appearance since 2003. The Eagles swept through the MAC Tournament, winning all four games by a combined 21 runs, to notch the school's fourth tournament title. The conference title capped a remarkable turnaround, as Eastern Michigan - picked to finish fifth in the division - closed the season on a hot streak, claiming 25 of 40 games and earning a berth in the NCAA field.\n\nFor his efforts, Boss was selected the 2008 MAC Coach of the Year and made history by becoming just the second coach in league history to win the MAC Tournament and advance to the NCAA Tournament in his first season. Overall, the Eagles finished the season 15-8 in conference play and 25-34 overall.\n\nBoss was no stranger to postseason play prior to coming to East Lasing, having coached in six NCAA Tournaments. Prior to being named head coach at Eastern Michigan, he was an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Michigan from 2004-07, as the Wolverines made NCAA Regional appearances all three seasons. Boss was a member of the staff that led the Wolverines to three straight 40-win campaigns, with a 42-19 record in 2005, a 43-21 mark in 2006 and a 42-19 finish in 2007. Michigan won the 2006 and 2007 Big Ten regular-season titles, and claimed an NCAA Regional title in 2007 by upsetting top-seeded Vanderbilt to advance to the school's first-ever Super Regional.\n\nBoss was an assistant coach at Eastern Michigan for seven seasons (1997-2004) before coaching in Ann Arbor. During his stint as an assistant in Ypsilanti, Boss helped the Eagles to back-to-back MAC West Division championships in 2002 and 2003. In 2003, the Eagles also won the conference tournament title while advancing to the NCAA Regional. Working mostly with catchers, infielders and hitters, the Eagles set several team records under Boss' direction, including home runs with 95 in 2002.\n\nBoss began his collegiate coaching career in 1996 and 1997 as an assistant baseball coach at Iowa Central Community College in Ft. Dodge, Iowa. Both seasons the team advanced to the NJCAA World Series, including a runner-up finish in 1997. While at ICCC, he worked with three All-Americans, coached the catchers and outfielders and oversaw the academic services of the baseball team. He also served as an associate scout for the Atlanta Braves organization in 1996-97.\n\nBoss started his coaching career as an assistant coach at Lakeview (Mich.) High School in 1994 before being named the head coach at Webberville (Mich.) High School in 1995. Boss, who played baseball at Alma from 1989-93, earned his bachelor's degree in English in 1993. He completed his master's degree in physical education from Eastern Michigan in 2000. An accomplished writer, Boss was co-author of a book, Dare to Hit .400, in the spring of 1998. He has been a member of the American Baseball Coaches Association since 1995.\n\nBoss and his wife, Cheryl (Schiff), have two daughters, Abigail and Grace, and a son, Jacob.\n\nTHE JAKE BOSS JR.
