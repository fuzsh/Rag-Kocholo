Georgetown’s profound impact on college basketball extends beyond athletic prowess, with a reputation for fostering leaders both on and off the court. This fusion of academic and athletic discipline shapes the distinct ethos of Hoya basketball—a program that values character and education as much as victories.\n\nExploring the archives to compile Georgetown basketball’s all-time starting five highlights players who excelled in performance and leadership. These legends, clad in blue and gray, left their mark on the court. They set high standards for future generations. This exploration reveals their significant contributions, which have cemented Georgetown’s status as a mainstay of basketball excellence.\n\nGeorgetown Basketball: Hoyas All-Time Starting 5\n\nGuard: Allen Iverson\n\nAllen Iverson’s impact at Georgetown epitomizes his status as an all-time great for the Hoyas. In just two seasons, from 1994 to 1996, Iverson transformed the game with his electrifying play and tenacity. He shattered the school’s season record for steals as a freshman. Additionally, he averaged 25 points per game in his sophomore year, showcasing his elite scoring talent. Moreover, Iverson propelled Georgetown to an Elite Eight appearance. He earned Big East Defensive Player of the Year twice and All-American honors in 1996. His legacy at Georgetown is not just built on stats but on his dynamic presence and relentless spirit on the court. He was (and still is) a global icon – his influence will never be forgotten in basketball circles.\n\nGuard: Eric “Sleepy” Floyd\n\nEric “Sleepy” Floyd’s career at Georgetown firmly places him among the all-time greats for the Hoyas. Floyd was a standout guard, known for his scoring ability and leadership on the court. He led the Hoyas to an NCAA tournament appearance each year, highlighted by a Final Four run in 1982. Floyd’s accolades include being named to the All-Big East team multiple times and finishing his career as one of Georgetown’s top scorers. His presence was pivotal in elevating Georgetown’s national profile. Furthermore, he is Georgetown basketball’s all-time leading scorer with 2,304 points. He left Georgetown after playing 130 games, starting 101 of them. He averaged 17.7 points per game, 3.7 rebounds per game, and 2.7 assists per game. His legacy at Georgetown is not just defined by his impressive statistics but also by his ability to lead and perform when it mattered most. Floyd put Georgetown on the map.\n\nForward: Reggie Williams\n\nShortly after Sleepy Floyd left campus, Georgetown basketball found another running mate for big-man Patrick Ewing. Reggie Williams’ tenure at Georgetown marks him as one of the all-time greats in the program’s storied history. Playing from 1983 to 1987, Williams led the Hoyas to three NCAA Tournament appearances. This included two National Championship games, securing the title in 1984. Over his collegiate career, Williams distinguished himself not just with his scoring—where he accumulated over 2,000 points—but also with his versatile play, earning All-American honors. His senior year was particularly noteworthy as he averaged 23.6 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, leading Georgetown to another Final Four appearance. Williams’ ability to perform in crucial games, combined with his consistent all-around excellence, solidifies his legacy as a pivotal figure in Georgetown basketball.\n\nForward: Alonzo Mourning\n\nConsider it cheating if you must, but Alonzo Mourning receives the second forward slot, even though he played a lot of time at center. Mourning was a dominant force, especially noted for his defensive prowess. He led the NCAA in blocked shots during his time. His remarkable ability to alter opponents’ shots helped guide Georgetown to three NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the Elite Eight in 1989. Mourning garnered multiple accolades, including being named an All-American and the Big East Defensive Player of the Year twice. Additionally, his career statistics reflect his impact. Mourning dominated college and finished with over 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, and 453 blocks. Mourning’s leadership, coupled with his defensive skills and scoring ability, played a pivotal role in sustaining Georgetown’s presence on the national stage. He is a cornerstone for Hoya hoops.\n\nCenter: Patrick Ewing\n\nDuh. Patrick ‘Big Pat’ Ewing’s influence at Georgetown from 1981 to 1985 was marked by his remarkable contributions to the Hoyas’ success, particularly in NCAA tournaments. He led the Hoyas to three Final Four appearances and clinched the 1984 National Championship. His exceptional defensive skills played a crucial role, which was especially visible during their championship run. Notably, Ewing amassed career stats that included scoring 2,184 points and securing 1,316 rebounds, alongside a Georgetown-record 493 blocks.\n\nEwing’s comprehensive impact was not confined to defense alone; he was also a formidable force offensively. Recognized as the Naismith College Player of the Year in 1985, his dual capabilities in scoring, rebounding, and shot-blocking were pivotal. His strategic play not only secured victories but also helped maintain leads by converting defensive stops into offensive opportunities. This balanced performance on both ends of the court firmly established him as one of Georgetown’s most impactful players, leaving a lasting legacy that echoes throughout their basketball history."
