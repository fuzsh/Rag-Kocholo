        "text": "The first women's soccer national championship was awarded to North Carolina 36 years ago, in 1982, for its 2-0 win over Central Florida.\n\nSince that inaugural NCAA DI women's soccer national championship, 11 teams have finished the season at the top of the sport. The 2023 season ended with Florida State moving into second place with its fourth national championship in school history and its second in the past three years.\n\nRANKINGS: Stay update to the with the latest women's soccer rankings\n\nLet's take a look at the six teams that have won at least two titles.\n\nWomen's college soccer history: Programs with the most national championships\n\n1. North Carolina — 21\n\nChampionships: 1982, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012\n\nThere is no questioning the fact that North Carolina has been absolutely dominant in women's soccer. The Tar Heels haven't notched a national championship win since 2012, but have been national runners-up three times since 2018. They have 21 titles overall, all under coach Anson Dorrance, who retired before the 2024 season. That's over 50 percent of all DI NCAA women's soccer national championships ever played. North Carolina's 1992 national championship was the highest-scoring title game in the history of the sport, ending in a 9-1 victory over Duke.\n\n2. Florida State — 4\n\nChampionships: 2014, 2018, 2021, 2023\n\nAfter coming close twice as national runners-up in 2007 and 2013, the Seminoles finally captured their elusive national title in 2014. A mere four years later, they captured No. 2, taking down North Carolina—our winningest team on the list — 1-0 in the Women's College Cup. The Seminoles won against BYU with a 4-3 victory in penalties in 2021. They secured their fourth national championship in 2024 with a 5-1 win over Stanford.\n\nHISTORY: Women's soccer teams with the most consecutive home wins\n\n3 (tie). Stanford — 3\n\nChampionships: 2011, 2017, 2019\n\nBoth Stanford's women's and men's soccer teams won national championships in the 2017 season. The Cardinal had an almost perfect season, finishing at 23-1-0 with their 3-1 victory over UCLA. The Cardinal had another monster season just two years later, finishing 24-1-0 and defeating the winningest team in women's soccer championship history (North Carolina) for its third title. Stanford's other national championship came in 2011 with another almost perfect final record (25-0-1) with a 1-0 win over Duke.\n\n3 (tie). Notre Dame — 3\n\nChampionships: 1995, 2004, 2010\n\nAll three of Notre Dame's women's soccer national championships are pretty spread out. The Fighting Irish's 2010 victory was a seemingly simple 1-0 final over Stanford. The other two weren't so easy. During the 1995 championship, Notre Dame went into three overtime periods before beating out Portland 1-0 for the title. In the 2004 game, the Fighting Irish went into double overtime with UCLA, finally winning 1-1 on penalty kicks.\n\n4 (tie). Santa Clara — 2\n\nChampionships: 2001, 2020\n\nIn 2001, Santa Clara raised its first Women's College Cup trophy defeating North Carolina, 1-0. Almost two decades later, the Broncos reclaimed victory against upsetting No. 1 Florida State winning 1-1 on penalty kicks as a No. 11 seed.\n\n4 (tie). Southern California — 2\n\nChampionships: 2007, 2016\n\nAfter winning their first national championship in 2007, the Trojans would wait nine years to relive that glory. The second national championship came in 2016 with a 3-1 win over West Virginia. The first goal was scored in the second minute of the game, with two more following in the second half.\n\n4 (tie). Portland — 2\n\nChampionships: 2002, 2005\n\nPortland is the third women's soccer program tied for two national championships. Their 2002 championship took two extra time periods to win, but the Pilots came out with a 2-1 victory over Santa Clara. In 2005, UCLA fell to Portland 4-0 in the title game.\n\nSHOP CHAMPIONSHIP GEAR: Buy 2019 official Stanford women's soccer College Cup gear\n\nWomen's college soccer: Complete history of the championship match\n\nHere's the complete list of women's college soccer national champions:"
