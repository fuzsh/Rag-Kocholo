Meredith has coached the Blue Devils in all but their inaugural season and has built the team into a perennial contender in the SUNYAC.\n\nCoach Meredith entered the season 38th on the all-time NCAA wins list. In addition, records indicate that he was third among active Division III coaches for most games coached (938), fifth for active Division III coaches in wins (442), and 28th in total number of games coached in a career in both Division I and III.\n\nMeredith was honored with SUNYAC Coach of the Year after the 2017-18 season, his third such award (previously won in 1990-91 and 1993-94). He earned national honors with his selection as 1994 Coach of the Year by the American Hockey Coaches Association. During his tenure, his teams made post-season appearances in 19 out of the last 21 years, won three SUNYAC titles, made two NCAA Final Four appearances and the NCAA tournament again in 2007. Additionally, in 2014, he was the recipient of the Fredonia State President’s Award for Excellence along with being recognized by The American Cancer Society with the 2013 Coach of the Year Award. The award recognizes coaches across the American Cancer Society Eastern Division who make a difference in the fight against cancer through exceptional community leadership and professional excellence.\n\nIn 1994-95 -- the Blue Devil icers captured the SUNYAC tournament title for the second year in a row, thus earning a berth in the NCAA Division III playoffs. With victories over Salem State (8-2, 3-8, 3-0) and the University of Wisconsin - Superior (4-3), the Blue Devils advanced to the National Championship Game. Facing host Middlebury College, Fredonia State ultimately fell to Middlebury's Panthers, 1-0. It was the second consecutive trip to the NCAA Final Four for the team. In 1993-94, Fredonia State went 29-1-4 -- the best record of any team in any division in the nation -- and earned third-place national honors. The Blue Devils' only loss of the season came in the NCAA semifinals, 4-3, to eventual champion, the University of Wisconsin - River Falls. Additionally, the 1993-94 and 1994-95 teams were recently inducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame as Teams of Distinction.\n\n(The Leader article, April 2024, by Matt Volz)\n\n(The Leader article, Part 2, Where are they now?, April 2024, by Matt Volz)\n\nAdditional milestones under Coach Meredith's leadership include the selection of nine players as Division III All-Americans, 52 All-SUNYAC honorees, two players named as East-West Shrine All-Stars, one player named to the 2007 Frozen Four Skills Competition and the breaking of dozens of individual and team records. The most recent All-Americans were forward, Jordan Oye who was selected First Team and defenseman Steve Rizer, a two-time All American who was chosen to the Second Team honor during the 2010-2011 season.\n\nCoach Meredith has been a mentor to many of his assistant coaches and Fredonia has been a launching pad for them to get started in the coaching profession.
