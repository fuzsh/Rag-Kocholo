        "text": "ADRIAN, Mich. -- Second-ranked Adrian had to climb out of a hole for the second day on Saturday against Lawrence in a 5-3 win against the Vikings at Arrington Ice Arena. Friday, Adrian fell behind 2-0 and scored two late third period goals to force a 2-2 tie. On Saturday, the Lawrence power play once again put them ahead in the first period. Each team killed off a penalty in the first 5:39 and then Brent Sauve was hit with a five-minute major for boarding and a game misconduct at the 7:13 mark. LU scored twice at 9:16 and 10:29 as the same lineup of Ryan Rumble, Paul Zuke and Gustav Lindgren put the Vikings up 2-0. Rumble increased his season goal total to five with the pair of power play goals.\n\nLawrence added to their lead at 14:44 on an unassisted goal by Zuke who finished the period with three points. He took the puck just outside the blue line on the left wing on a breakaway and went five-hole for his third goal of the season. The Vikings outshot Adrian, 11-9, in the first and finished 2-for-4 on the power play with nine shots on net. Adrian went 0-for-2 with seven shots on goal in the period.\n\nAdrian responded quickly out of the locker room just 30 seconds into the second period. Josh Cousineau scored his sixth of the season from Chris Leone and Justin Basso. Cousineau shot from the right circle and the puck seemed to flutter into the goal to cut the deficit to 3-1. Josh Ranalli snapped an eight-game goal less draught at 15:43 for his 17th tally of the season from Cousineau and Basso. Ranalli worked behind the cage and slipped to the left post taking a pass from Cousineau to cut the lead to 3-2.\n\nThe Bulldogs entered the third period and scored at 1:07 to tie things at 3-3. Ryan Lowe notched his fourth of the season from Brett Pinkerton and Duston Hebebrand as he gathered a rebound that bounced off the boards. Hebebrand scored what appeared to be the game-winning goal minutes later, but the goal was disallowed because the whistle had blown to stop the play. Hebebrand would not be denied at 16:10 however as his 15th goal of the season on the power play proved to be the winner. The Bulldogs scored on their eighth chance of the game with goaltender Scott Shackell and Ryan Gieseler getting assists. Hebebrand carried through the neutral zone and glided to the front of the net before pushing the puck under goaltender Mattias Soderqvist. Hebebrand then added an empty-netter at 19:47 from center ice with assists from Lowe and Gieseler after Lawrence pulled Soderqvist with 42 seconds left.\n\nNo. 1 St. Norbert 2, Saint Scholastica 1\n\nDULUTH, Minn. -- Brandon Hoogenboom's goal one minute, nine seconds into overtime sent St. Norbert to a pulsating 2-1 win against St. Scholastica, giving the Green Knights a Northern Collegiate Hockey Association series sweep at Mars Lakeview Arena.\n\nSt. Norbert, which won Friday's game 3-0, took the lead when Hoogenboom scored off a long pass from Sam Higgins at 11:05 of the first period. Zach McDonald also assisted on the goal. The Green Knights outshot the Saints 13-2 in the first 20 minutes.\n\nSt. Norbert outshot the Saints 31-17, with Bruggeman keeping the host in the game with 29 saves. David Jacobson made 16 saves to improve to 16-1-1 on the season for the Green Knights. St. Norbert was 0-for-3 on the power play, while St. Scholastica was 0-for-2.\n\nNo. 5 Babson 3, Southern Maine 0\n\nABSON PARK, Mass. -- Nik Tasiopoulos scored the game-winning goal at 11:23 of the second period and sophomore goaltender Jamie Murray set a new single-season program record with his fourth shutout of the season as Babson blanked Southern Maine 3-0 in Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) East action at the Babson Skating Center on Saturday afternoon.\n\nWith the victory, Babson moves to 19-3-1 overall and 13-2-1 in the ECAC East, while Southern Maine drops to 5-13-5 overall and 4-10-2 in conference play.\n\nThe Beavers sit atop the conference standings, three points ahead of nationally-ranked Norwich with two games to go, and have locked up a top-two seed and the right to host both a quarterfinal and semifinal in the upcoming ECAC East tournament.\n\nSenior Tom Callahan and junior Andrew Bonazza each scored for Babson, which struck three times in a span of 3:43 in the second period. Sophomore Mike Vollmin and first-year Michael Phillips both had two assists, while senior Matt Furey chipped in with his sixth helper of the season.\n\nNo. 10 Oswego State 5, Morrisville 3\n\nMORRISVILLE , N.Y. -- Oswego State scored four unanswered goals to comeback and beat Morrisville State 5-3 in a SUNYAC contest Saturday night. With the win, the Lakers move to 15-4-1 overall and 8-3-1 in the SUNYAC while Morrisville falls to 5-15-2, 2-11-1.\n\nAlex Botten scored a power-play goal directly off a faceoff at the 6:55 mark of the final period to give Oswego its first lead of the game at 4-3. Botten's fifth goal of the season was the eventual game-winner and came in unassisted fashion. Six minutes later, the Lakers pushed the lead to 5-3 when Brandon Adams scored his eighth goal of the season for insurance at 12:50. He was assisted by David Titanic.\n\nKenny Neil scored the equalizer less than a minute into the third period on an assist from Matt Galati, tying the game at 3-3. It was Neil's 12th goal of the season and was scored at the end of a power-play that carried over from the second period."
