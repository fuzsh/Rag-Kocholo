        "text": "Classroom\n\nBrock Maschmeyer has excelled in the classroom during his time at Northern Michigan. A 2015 and 2016 WCHA Scholar-Athlete and all-WCHA Academic Team selection, he holds a cumulative GPA of 3.62. Maschmeyer is working toward a degree in public relations with a minor in communications and is on pace to graduate in April 2017.\n\nMaschmeyer is also involved in public relations outside of the classroom. A member of Northern Michigan’s chapter of the Public Relations Student Society of America, he has interned in the sports information office since November 2016. Among his many responsibilities, he acts as the secondary media contact for the men’s and women’s basketball teams and the lacrosse team, penning every preview that appears on NMUWildcats.com and attending home games to assist with scoring when his schedule permits. He also helps manage the NMU_Hockey Instagram account; by allowing fans to go behind the scenes with the team, he has helped double the account’s following in just over half a season.\n\nCharacter\n\nMaschmeyer has served as an alternate captain in 2015-16 and 2016-17. He has been a leader on and off the ice since arriving in Marquette in 2013. “Brock has been a leader for us since the day he got here and has played in all situations,” said Head Coach Walt Kyle. “He’s a leading candidate for all-league honors this season and is certainly one of the leaders of our team and program.”\n\nAs soon as each school year ends, Maschmeyer returns home to his family farm, which sprawls across 8,500 acres and produces canola, wheat and barley, in Bruderheim, Alberta. He is in charge of the night shift and estimates that he covers 54 miles a night in the air seeder, a tractor that spreads seeds and fertilizer. He always manages to squeeze in a two-hour workout so that he is ready for the hockey season. “Because of his farming background, he’s been working his whole life,” said Assistant Coach John Kyle. “He figured out at an early age that to be a good hockey player and person, you have to work. He leads by that example.”\n\nMaschmeyer is one of three siblings who played NCAA Division I hockey. His older brother skated in the Western Hockey League, and his younger sister is a favorite to be Canada’s Olympic goaltender. “He’s a competitor in everything he does,” said John Kyle. “He wants to do things right and never takes shortcuts.”\n\nCommunity\n\nMaschmeyer was part of Northern Michigan’s effort to clean up Lakeview Arena before its Kraft Hockeyville USA game. He also participated in the following service activities in Marquette: Wildcat Free Youth Clinic, Harbor Fest setup and take down, Hockey Day Parade, Maggie Moore Jr. Hockey Mite Learn to Skate, Readers for Redeemer Lutheran Church Elementary School and Cherry Creek Elementary School. He also is active in his native Bruderheim, where he helped organize a ball hockey tournament at the community rink and visits schools to present to the children.\n\nCompetition\n\nMaschmeyer has been a key cog in Northern Michigan’s defense and entered his senior campaign tied for ninth all-time among Wildcat defensemen with 20 career goals. Since his freshman year, he has been a contributor on special teams, quarterbacking the power play and skating on the penalty kill. He played his 100th collegiate game on Feb. 13, 2016, and was last held out of the lineup in February of his freshman season. In both 2014-15 and 2015-16, he was one of only five Wildcats to play in all 38 games. In 2014-15, he became the first defenseman in the program’s 39-year history to lead the team in goal-scoring. For being one of only two defensemen to crack the top 30 in league goal scoring, he was named to the 2015 All-WCHA Third Team."
