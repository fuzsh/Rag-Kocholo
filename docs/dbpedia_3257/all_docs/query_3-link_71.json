        "text": "The votes are in and the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association coaches have voted University of Wisconsin-Superior senior goaltender Chad Beiswenger player of the year.\n\nBeiswenger was the only goalie to play this year for the Yellowjackets, logging 1,518:49 of ice time (first in the nation by nearly two full games) and posting a sparkling 20-2-3 record. Three shutouts, seven 1-goal games and a .920 save percentage contributed to a 2.05 goals against average.\n\n\"(Beiswenger) is the biggest reason we're the No. 1 seed in the postseason,\" UWS had coach Dan Stauber said. \"Most nights we get a performance reflective of an All-American. He's only had one truly off night all year.\"\n\nBeiswenger was named to the honorable mention team last season. He grew up in Moorhead, Minn., near the North Dakota border and played junior hockey for Helena of the North American Hockey League.\n\nConference champion UWS led the way with three players named to the team. Joining Beiswenger were forward Braden Desmet and defenseman Ryan Kuntz.\n\nDesmet had 12 goals and 16 assists for 28 point while Kuntz, a converted defenseman, has four goals and 10 assists for 14 points.\n\nHonorable mention selections from Superior are forwards Talon Berlando (10-17--27); Kevin Huck (8-21--29); Logan Isley (11-15--26); and Chris Wilson (15-16--31); and defenseman Art Clark (4-10--14).\n\nNCHA coaches also voted for coach of the year, selecting Mark Wick of St. Scholastica. Wick, a native of Hermantown, Minn., led the Saints to an 18-5-2 overall record through Feb. 18 and finished the regular season ranked fourth nationally. Wick is in his fifth season behind the bench for St. Scholastica.\n\nThe Yellowjackets and St. Scholastica are ranked 1-2 in the West Region according to Division III men's rankings released Tuesday by the NCAA.\n\nUWS (20-2-3) and St. Scholastica (18-5-2) open the Northern Collegiate Hockey Association playoffs at home today and Saturday.\n\nIn the East Region, Plattsburgh (N.Y.) State (20-1-2) and Elmira (N.Y.) College (15-5-2) rank 1-2.\n\nThe field for the 11-team Division III tournament will be announced March 8.\n\nUWS and CSS begin Peters Cup play this weekend by hosting quarterfinal series.\n\nThe 'Jackets host Lake Forest, and UW-River Falls will play the Saints at Mars Lakeview Arena."
