Renamed in January 2022, MVP Arena is \"Upstate New York's Premier Sports and Entertainment Facility.\"\n\nOwned by Albany County and operated by ASM Global, the world's leading producer of entertainment experiences, MVP Arena has an adaptable seating capacity between 6,000 and 17,500. Since Frank Sinatra christened the building on January 30, 1990, more than eighteen million patrons have walked through the turnstiles.\n\nAs a multi-purpose facility, MVP Arena has hosted a variety of events, including concerts, family shows and sporting events, averaging 165 events each year.\n\nIn 2000, MVP Arena ranked 14th nationally in total concert attendance, higher than arenas in Philadelphia and other major markets.\n\nSell-out concerts at the Arena have included Fleetwood Mac, Celine Dion, Blake Shelton, Thomas Rhett, John Mayer, Jonas Brothers, Kenny Chesney, Elton John, Ariana Grande, Mumford & Sons, Panic!
