The city previously hosted the Frozen Four in 1989, 1991, 1994, 2002, 2011 and 2018.\n\nAlthough this year’s four semifinalists have combined for 28 men’s hockey national championships, none of the four have ever won it all in Saint Paul:\n\nFrozen Four Champions in St. Paul (runner-up in parentheses)\n\n1989 – Harvard (Minnesota)\n\n1991 – Northern Michigan (Boston University)\n\n1994 – Lake Superior State (Boston University)\n\n2002 – Minnesota (Maine)\n\n2011 – Minnesota Duluth (Michigan)\n\n2018 – Minnesota Duluth (Notre Dame)\n\nXcel Energy Center has already played home to NCAA hockey this year, having hosted the NCHC Frozen Faceoff in March, as well as a non-conference game between Minnesota and St. Thomas on Oct. 13.\n\nState of Hockey, Part II:\n\nEight Minnesotans are returning to their home state for this year’s Frozen Four: Boston College’s Aram Minnetian (Fr., Woodcliff Lake, N.J.) and Will Traeger (So., Mendota Heights, Minn.); Boston University’s Jack Harvey (Fr., Stacy, Minn.), Denver’s Tristan Broz (Jr., Bloomington, Minn.) and Jared Wright (Burnsville, Minn.); and Michigan’s Josh Eernisse (So., Apple Valley, Minn.), Jackson Hallum (So., Eagan, Minn.), and Garrett Schifsky (Fr., Andover, Minn.).\n\nA total of 233 Minnesotans played NCAA Division I Men’s Hockey in 2023-24, more than any other state or province. Ontario (186) and Michigan (138) ranked second and third, respectively.\n\nThe Future is Now:\n\nThis year’s Frozen Four field features a combined 51 NHL Draft picks, the most since College Hockey Inc. began tracking in 2016-17. In fact, there have been an average of 44 draft picks in the last three Frozen Fours compared to an average of 23 in the previous three.\n\nSeven of the 51 draft picks were selected in the first round:\n\nCutter Gauthier, Boston College (Anaheim, 5th, 2022)*\n\nRyan Leonard, Boston College (Washington, 8th, 2023)\n\nRutger McGroarty, Michigan (Winnipeg, 14th, 2022)\n\nFrank Nazar III, Michigan (Chicago, 13th, 2022)\n\nGabe Perreault, Boston College (NY Rangers, 23rd, 2023)\n\nWill Smith, Boston College (San Jose, 4th, 2023)\n\nTom Willander, Boston University (Vancouver, 11th, 2023)\n\n* - drafted by Philadelphia\n\nTwo of the draft picks in the Frozen Four are Minnesota Wild selections who will be playing in the home rink of the Wild: Denver F Rieger Lorenz (So., Calgary, Alberta), a second-rounder in 2022, and Michigan D Marshall Warren (Gr., Laurel Hollow, N.Y.), a sixth-rounder in 2019.\n\nHobey Hopefuls:\n\nExactly half of the 2024 Hobey Baker Memorial Award top-10 finalists will be competing in the 2024 NCAA Frozen Four: Boston University F Macklin Celebrini (Fr., Vancouver, British Columbia), Denver F Jack Devine (Jr., Glencoe, Ill.), Boston College F Cutter Gauthier (So., Scottsdale, Ariz.), Boston University D Lane Hutson (So., Chicago, Ill.), and Boston College F Will Smith (Fr., Lexington, Mass).\n\nThe Hobey Hat Trick (three finalists) will be announced April 4, and the Hobey Baker Award recipient will be announced April 12 during Frozen Four weekend.

Hockey also had the best single-year GSR (96%) among Division I men’s sports.\n\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n\nTeams scoring the first goal went just 4-8 (.333) during the NCAA Regionals last weekend … The four teams in this year’s Frozen Four are a combined 86-8-4 (.898) this season when leading after two periods … An average of 6.42 goals per game were scored during the regional round, up nearly a full goal per game from last year’s regional average of 5.58 … There are nine players in Division I men’s hockey with 50-plus points this season, the most in a single year since 2016-17 when 13 players eclipsed that mark.
