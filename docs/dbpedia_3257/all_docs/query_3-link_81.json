        "text": "In this day of social media, many people use this platform to gut and rip people. I have been doing sports radio for over 25 years and have read it all.\n\nWhen I first started in this business, it bothered me because I was not used to getting crushed on the internet. But after 25 years I’m immune to it.\n\nIn this day and age of soiled internet, anything goes. I have read some of the most bizarre, awful, crazy, unrealistic, terrible, gutless things about people that are just unbelievable. I can't believe people post some of these things.\n\nI take it with a grain of salt. I don’t chastise anyone who gets off by gassing people on the internet or social media. Because bottom line, I just consider the source. It’s not worth ripping these people. Two wrongs don’t make a right really comes into play here.\n\nI really stop caring when people would go after me in total anonymity. These people hide behind a keyboard and spew their bad thoughts and garbage. I stopped paying attention after my mother passed away in 2007.\n\nNow that’s a big thing! Caring what people think of me is wasted energy and pointless. I really feel bad for the people that are addicted to ripping people anonymously. They have no clue how these shows are put together and what goes into them. Plus, some people just rip to rip. Meaning they get off being unopposed about it. It’s really comical in the grand scheme of things.\n\nThat’s in a nutshell how I handle this part of my job! A very laughable situation. I just don’t care any more. As long as they spell my name right..."
