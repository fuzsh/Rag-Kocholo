        "text": "The team goals remain the same every season. We want to win the conference, advance to Regionals and Nationals with the goal of winning the National Championship. We believe our success has been a result of such high expectations and we challenge our players both physically and mentally to be prepared every day. It will not take very long for new players to understand what it takes to win at this level. We require our players to be successful on the ice, in the classroom and in the community.\n\nThe Men’s Club Hockey team is committed to building on its recent success by offering players one of the best college hockey experiences in the ACHA. The program is designed to replicate the operations of a successful NCAA D3 program and to offer a solid alternative to D3 hockey. The Cat’s practice 3 nights a week (4-5 hours) primarily at the BEC on campus at NMU. Practices are conducted by the Coaching Staff and will be designed to continue skill development and to teach and improve team philosophies and systems. A weight training program and access to the PEIF is strongly recommended and players can work with the coaches to formulate a program.\n\nWe feel every player should continue to grow and develop playing hockey in the program here. The program is very demanding and requires students to balance hockey and academics. We feel this is a key piece to student athlete experience and teaches skills outside of hockey such as solid study habits, responsibility and time management.​\n\nThe team plays 35 regular season games each season. This does not include the conference tournament and any ACHA Regional and National playoff games. NMU Club Hockey travels exclusively by Charter Bus and provides all overnight lodging. Travel makes up roughly 40% of the teams budget. It is our goal to provide a safe and enjoyable travel experience for our players.​\n\nThe team provides players with one of the best equipment and apparel packages in the ACHA. We provide players with gloves, pants, jerseys, apparel and even offer special ACHA pricing on equipment including sticks and skates from Warrior, Reebok, CCM and Sherwood.​"
