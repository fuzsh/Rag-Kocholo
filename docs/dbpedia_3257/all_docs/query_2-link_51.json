        "text": "Jeff Blashill was announced as the head ice hockey coach on April 6, 2010, becoming the fifth head coach in the 37-year history of the program.\n\nIn his first season, Blashill led the Broncos to a 19-13-10 record, more than doubling the win total from the previous season. WMU finished in fourth place in the CCHA with a 10-9-9 conference record, its first top four finish in the CCHA since the 1995-96 season. Blashill also led the Broncos to Joe Louis Arena for the CCHA Semifinals, where they defeated top-seeded Michigan 5-2 to earn their first berth to the CCHA Tournament Championship game for the first time since 1986. Although the Broncos fell to Miami, Western Michigan earned its first birth in the NCAA Tournament since 1996. The Broncos were awarded an at-large bid and a three seed and battled second-seeded Denver before falling to the Pioneers in double- overtime. He was named a finalist for CCHA Coach of the Year and was named National Coach of the Year by both College Hockey News, USCHO.comm and Inside College Hockey. Under Blashill defenseman Danny DeKeyser and forward Chase Balisy were named to the CCHA All-Rookie team. The Broncos maintained a national ranking in Blashill's first season for 16 weeks in the USCHO.com poll, reaching as high as 10th, and four weeks in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll.\n\nBlashill came to Western Michigan after serving as the head coach and general manager of the Indiana Ice of the United States Hockey League, the top juniors league in the United States. Under his tutelage, the Ice won the “Clark Cup” in his first season as head coach and made it to the USHL semi-finals his second season. In his championship season, Blashill led the Ice to a 39-19-2 record, tying a program mark for wins. In two seasons with Blashill at the helm the Ice were 76-48-5. Several of Blashill’s players at Indiana signed letters of intent to play college hockey or are currently playing at the college level.\n\nBefore his stop in Indianapolis, Blashill helped construct the Miami RedHawks hockey program into a national power, assisting head coach Enrico Blassi for six seasons. During his time as an assistant, the RedHawks went to the NCAA Tournament four times, including the Elite Eight during the 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons. Blashill recruits excelled at Miami with three of them being named Hobey Baker Finalists, four making the CCHA All-Rookie Team, 11 named first or second team All-CCHA, two of them competing in the World Junior Championships and six of them being honored as All-Americans. Under Blashill the RedHawks penalty-kill unit ranked in the top 10 in the nation from 2004 to 2008, including tops in the nation during 2008. Blashill also had a role in recruiting and developing many players on the Miami 2008-09 NCAA Finalist team and the 2005-06 CCHA Championship team.\n\nBlashill also spent four years as an assistant coach at Ferris State, his alma matter. At FSU he played a major role in recruiting and developing the 2002-03 CCHA Championship team.\n\nA native of Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., Blashill played goalie for Ferris State University from 1994-98. As a student athlete he was selected as FSU’s Rookie of the Year for the 1994-95 season. He was named to the CCHA All-Academic Team during the 1996-97 season. Blashill earned a bachelor’s degree in finance from Ferris State in 1998 and was honored three-straight years with the FSU President’s Award for having the team’s highest GPA.\n\nBlashill and his wife, Erica, have three kids, Teddy, Josie and Owen.\n\nThe Blashill File"
