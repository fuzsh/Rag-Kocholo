        "text": "MENOMONIE, Wis. (Blugolds.com) – The 15th ranked University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire men's hockey team played in their final regular season game on Saturday as they concluded the \"War on 94\" weekend series with UW-Stout. A goal in each period powered the Blugolds over the Blue Devils for the 3-1 win to wrap up the regular season.\n\nA physical game brought energy and pace to the arena with a 2nd seed in the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) tournament on the line, it was UW-Eau Claire finding the first tally of the night. Sammy Martel (Sr. – Bolingbrook, Ill./Nequa Valley) lit the lamp at 11:12 of the opening period on a redirection in the slot to give UWEC a 1-0 lead. Martel's fifth goal of the season was assisted by Quinn Green (Sr. – West Chicago, Ill./ St. Charles East) and Kyler Grundy (Jr. – Pleasant Prairie, Wis./Indian Trail Academy). Despite being outshot in the first period 12-5, Eau Claire hit the locker room in the first intermission with their 1-0 lead.\n\nIn the second period, UW-Stout evened the score at 9:58 of the middle frame with a shot from the left half wall to make it 1-1. Just 30 seconds later, Kyler Grundy got the Blugolds back in front with a short side shot that beat the Stout netminder under the blocker, giving UWEC a 2-1 lead. The Blugolds found their momentum in the second by out shooting the Blue Devils 13-4 as they kept their one goal lead into the second intermission.\n\nThe final period held a back-and-forth effort from both squads as battled till the very end. With the Stout net empty in the final four minutes of play, Willy Stauber (Sr. – Duluth, Minn./Marshall) found a pass from Kyler Grundy in the neutral zone and buried his second goal of the season to seal the 3-1 victory.\n\nMax Gutjahr (So. – Appleton, Wis./Kimberly) stopped 27 of the 28 shots he faced in his 15th win of the year. Gutjahr is now 15-7-2 on the season.\n\nThe Blugolds (16-7-2, WIAC 10-4-1) earn the second seed in the WIAC Commissioner's Cup and receive a bye in the first round. UWEC will take next weekend off and will host the WIAC tournament semifinals on February 23rd and 24th.\n\nScoring Summary\n\nScoring Summary Scoring Play Visiting Team Score Home Team Score 1st Period WEC UWS 11:12\n\nWEC - Martel, Sammy Assisted by Green, Quinn, Grundy, Kyler\n\n1 0 2nd Period WEC UWS 10:02\n\nUWS - McAlpine, Jake Assisted by Daikawa, Kullan\n\n1 1 10:28\n\nWEC - Grundy, Kyler Assisted by Green, Quinn, Martel, Sammy\n\n2 1 3rd Period WEC UWS 19:37.1\n\nWEC - Stauber, Willy Assisted by Grundy, Kyler\n\n3 1"
