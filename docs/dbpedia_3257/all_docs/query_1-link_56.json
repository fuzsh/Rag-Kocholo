As a regional host, the Blue Devils have gone 27-3 and own an all-time NCAA Team Championship ledger of 50-30. Duke has advanced as far as the quarterfinals, reaching the round of eight in 1993, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2012 and 2013. Duke head coach Ramsey Smith has guided the Blue Devils to the NCAA Team Championship in 13 of his 16 seasons in Durham, including back-to-back quarterfinal appearances in 2012 and 2013.\n\nINSIDE LOOK AT THE BLUE DEVILS\n\nDuke enters the NCAA Team Championship with a 18-9 overall ledger, including a 9-3 mark in ACC play. Duke has won seven of its last nine matches, with one of those losses coming at the hands of No. 2 Virginia in the ACC Semifinals.\n\nThe Blue Devils have been led by First Team All-ACC selection Garrett Johns and Second Team All-ACC honoree Pedro Rodenas. Johns, who's ranked No. 21 nationally, has played on Duke's top court in every dual singles match except three, posting a 14-4 ledger on court one. He holds a 9-4 mark against nationally ranked opponents, including a 6-2, 6-4 victory over No. 11 Cooper Williams of No. 8 Harvard. The Atlanta, Ga., native leads the team with six match-clinching wins with five of those six wins coming against nationally ranked teams.\n\nNo. 43 Rodenas leads the team with 24 overall singles wins, including a team-leading 16 dual wins. Throughout the season, he has played on Duke's top two courts and held a winning record on each, including a 13-7 mark on court two. The Madrid, Spain, native has tallied two match-clinching victory against Middle Tennessee State to win the Durham ITA Kickoff Weekend and against No. 28 North Carolina to send Duke into the ACC Championship semifinals. He holds a team-leading 11-7 ledger against nationally ranked opponents.\n\nAdditionally, Andrew Zhang (13-6) and Alexander Visser (11-11) have each reached double-digit dual wins this year.\n\nThe Blue Devils have also been strong in doubles play, recording 19 doubles victories, which has given the Blue Devils a massive advantage heading into singles action. Duke's top doubles pairing in Johns and Rodenas, who earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Doubles Championship, currently are the top doubles duo nationally after going 13-2 against nationally ranked opponents this dual season. The graduate student pairing of Michael Heller and Zhang (10-9) as well as the senior-sophomore twosome of Faris Khan and Teddy Truwit (5-3) have also been stout for the Blue Devils this season.\n\nHISTORY WITH UNC ASHEVILLE\n\nDuke and UNC Asheville have faced off on two previous occasions with the Blue Devils holding the 2-0 edge on the all-time series. The last meeting between these two programs came on February 24, 1987, with the Blue Devils securing a 7-0 win in Durham.\n\nSCOUTING THE BULLDOGS\n\nUNC Asheville claimed the Big South conference championship for the first time since 1986 to play its way into the NCAA Tournament. The Bulldogs are the winners of four of their last five matches, including a 4-1 upset win over top-seeded Gardner-Webb in the Big South championship match. Six players have double-digit dual victories, with senior Jon Brann Reid leading the team with a program-high 16-5 overall mark. Additionally, sophomore Freddy Murray is 12-2 on the Bulldogs' top court.\n\nHISTORY WITH NO. 20 ALABAMA\n\nDuke and Alabama have met five times in school history with the Crimson Tide leading the series, 4-1. Alabama is riding a two-match winning streak over the Blue Devils with the last Duke victory coming on March 17, 1994, by a 6-1 decision.\n\nSCOUTING THE CRIMSON TIDE\n\nAlabama enters the NCAA Tournament with a 17-12 ledger and this year's selection into the tournament marks the 21st NCAA postseason bid in program history, including its fifth under head coach George Husack. No. 29 Filip Planinsek and No. 106 Enzo Aguiard enter the national tournament ranked in singles, while the doubles teams of No. 34 Planinsek and Andrill Zimnokh and No. 51 Zach Foster and Aguiard secured national rankings in paired play.\n\nHISTORY WITH NO. 46 CHARLOTTE\n\nDuke and Charlotte have faced off on seven prior occasions with Duke leading the all-time series, 7-0. The last meeting between these two programs came on February 25, 2023 with the Blue Devils claiming a 7-0 decision.\n\nSCOUTING THE 49ERS\n\nCharlotte, who is listed No. 46 in the most recent ITA national rankings, earned its second NCAA Tournament appearance in school history by winning four matches in four days to claim the American Athletic Conference Championship and the automatic conference bid. Junior Matias Iturbe and redshirt sophomore Vasco Prata are the lone 49ers ranked in doubles play, securing the No. 80 spot heading into the weekend. In singles action, graduate student Spencer Gray leads the team with a 10-7 record on court one.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIf the Blue Devils beat UNC Asheville on Friday, Duke will take on the winner of the Alabama-Charlotte match on Saturday at 4 p.m., in the NCAA Second Round.\n\nThe winner of each site advances to super regional play, which is slated for May 11 or 12. Each super regional site will feature two teams playing a single-elimination format. The super regional winners advance to the Greenwood Tennis Center in Stillwater, Okla., where the eight teams will compete for the national championship, May 16-19. The event will be hosted by Oklahoma State University at the Michael and Anne Greenwood Tennis Center.\n\nNCAA SINGLES AND DOUBLES BIDS\n\nJohns and Rodenas were selected to represent Duke at the 2024 NCAA Singles and Doubles Championships, which runs May 20-25 at the Michael and Anne Greenwood Tennis Center in Stillwater, Okla.\n\nThe duo received at-large bids to compete in the 64-player singles field. Johns makes his third consecutive appearance at the singles championships, while Rodenas is set to make his second-straight trip to the top singles event.\n\nIn addition, the twosome has secured an automatic bid to the 32-team doubles championship for the second consecutive year and are the No. 1 overall seed in the national tournament. Johns and Rodenas join Carleton Reid and Henrique Cunha in 2010 as the only Blue Devil pairings in program history to enter the postseason individual championships as the No. 1 seed.\n\nIn 32 of the last 35 years, Duke has had at least one player or one doubles team selected to compete in the NCAA Individual Championships. The 2020 NCAA tournament was cancelled due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.\n\nTo stay up to date with Blue Devils men's tennis, follow the team on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook by searching \"DukeMTEN\".\n\nDuke Centennial\n\nIn 2024, Duke celebrates its Centennial, marking one hundred years since Trinity College became Duke University.
