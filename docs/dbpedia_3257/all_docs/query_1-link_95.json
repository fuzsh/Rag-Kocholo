        "text": "dramati\n\nThe University of Minnesota men's hockey team advanced to the 2005 NCAA Frozen Four with a dramatic 2-1 overtime win over Cornell in the championship game of the 2005 NCAA West Regional today at Mariucci Arena. Senior forward Barry Tallackson scored the game-winning goal at 4:31 of the extra session to push the top-seeded Golden Gophers (28-14-1) to their third NCAA Frozen Four in four years.\n\nForwards Garrett Smaagaard and Evan Kaufmann , defenseman Mike Vannelli and goaltender Kellen Briggs were named to the 2005 NCAA West Regional All-Tournament Team. Briggs earned Most Outstanding Player honors after stopping 42 of 43 shots on the weekend. Kaufmann scored the overtime game-winning goal in yesterday's 1-0 victory over Maine in the Regional Semifinal.\n\nThe 2005 NCAA Frozen Four is Thursday & Saturday, April 7 & 9, in Columbus, Ohio. Minnesota will face North Dakota on April 7 in one national semifinal, while Denver will meet Colorado College in the other. The Golden Gophers won back-to-back NCAA Championships in 2002 and 2003. The Maroon and Gold will be making their 19th NCAA Frozen Four appearance. The 19 appearances rank third behind Michigan's 22 and Boston University's 20.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period that saw the Golden Gophers out-shoot the Big Red (27-5-3), 14-3, Cornell took the game's first lead at 13:02 of the second period. With Minnesota on a power-play, Cornell pounced on loose puck in its own zone and raced up the ice on a 3- on-1 rush. Daniel Pegoraro passed across the slot for Mitch Carefoot to knock past UM goaltender Kellen Briggs on the glove side.\n\nLess than two minutes later, the Maroon and Gold knotted the game at one with Andy Sertich's sixth goal of the season. Using a nice give-and-go play, Sertich fed Garrett Smaagaard who passed back to Sertich to tuck a backhander between Cornell goaltender David McKee's legs for the game-tying goal.\n\nMinnesota thoroughly out-played the Big Red once again, out-shooting the ECAC Hockey League champions, 12-4 in the second period. The Golden Gophers held a 26-7 advantage on the shot board through two periods.\n\nCornell picked up its play in the third period, but couldn't solve Briggs. Both teams had eight shots on goal in the stanza, but neither could find a way to net the game-winner.\n\nIn the extra session, the Big Red controlled play in the early portion of the period, but Minnesota took advantage of an open opportunity to get the lamplighter. Freshman Mike Howe dug the puck out of a scrum in the corner with a deft stickhandling play and found Tallackson alone in front of McKee. Tallackson's first shot attempt hit McKee's left pad, but the senior forward got the rebound and lifted the puck over his pad and under his glove for the game-winner.\n\nThe game-winning goal was Tallackson fifth of the season, matching Ryan Potulny for the team lead. The marker was Tallackson's 11th of the year and first since March 12 vs. Minnesota State.\n\nThe Golden Gophers move on to the 2005 NCAA Frozen Four in Columbus, Ohio, where they will face North Dakota on Thursday, April 7, at 1 or 6 p.m., Central time. The 2005 NCAA Frozen Four is hosted by Ohio State University at the on-campus Schottenstein Center. All four teams in the 2005 NCAA Frozen Four - Minnesota, North Dakota, Denver and Colorado College - hail from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). It marks the first time in NCAA history that a Frozen Four has been made up of four teams from the same conference.\n\n2005 NCAA West Regional All-Tournament Team\n\nForward - Garrett Smaagaard , Minnesota\n\nForward - Matt Moulson, Cornell\n\nForward - Evan Kaufmann , Minnesota\n\nDefenseman - Mike Vannelli , Minnesota\n\nDefenseman - Doug Krantz, Cornell\n\nGoaltender - Kellen Briggs, Minnesota\n\nMost Outstanding Player - Kellen Briggs, Minnesota"
