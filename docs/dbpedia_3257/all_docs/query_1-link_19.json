At the time of his hiring, he was the youngest NCAA Ice Hockey head coach at 31 years of age. He first joined the Nanooks bench in August 2016 when former head coach Dallas Ferguson brought him on as an assistant coach. He served in that same position a year later, 2017-18, under interim head coach Lance West.\n\nWith Largen on the bench as an assistant and head coach, the Nanooks made the WCHA playoffs each season (16-20) and captured the coveted Alaska Airlines Governor's Cup each season. He now leads the team into their first independent season since the 1993-94 season.\n\nIn his first season at the helm, Largen led Alaska to a 12-21-3, 12-14-2 WCHA record that included keeping the Governor's Cup and knocking-off then-ranked #4 Minnesota State 1-0 at home in the Carlson Center. The 'Nooks traveled to Northern Michigan for the first round of the 2019 WCHA Playoffs where they fell in two games. The next season, the Nanooks returned to the Carlson Center and finished above .500 for the first time since 2014-15. With a 16-15-5, 14-9-5 WCHA record, they also hosted the first round of the 2020 WCHA Playoffs, their first time hosting since the 2013-14 season. They fell to Bowling Green in two games.\n\nLargen's second season on top led to the Nanooks first win against Michigan Tech in 16-games, a 4-0 victory over then-ranked #9/8 Penn State and their first victory in program history against Arizona State.\n\nHis third season was canceled due to COVID-19.\n\nHis fourth season, the 2021-22 season, was played as an independent. This was the Nanooks' first season in the independent Division I ranks since the 1993-94 season. Alaska went 14-18-2 in their first year out of a conference, and featured a three-game win streak against RPI to end the 2021 home-schedule before tying #8/8 Denver on the road and defeating #8/8 Minnesota on the road. The 'Nooks went 3-0-1 against independent rival Arizona State. After Dec. 10, 2021, the Nanooks finished their season 12-6-2. On July 28, 2022, Erik Largen signed a four-year extension to remain the head coach of the Nanooks hockey program through the 2025-26 season.\n\nIn the 2022-23 season, the Nanooks saw their best season since 2001-02 in terms of victories. Alaska posted a 22-10-2 Independent record and finished 17th in the PairWise rankings, missing out on the NCAA Hockey Tournament by one place. After starting 5-7-2 in the first two months, the Nanooks exploded for a 17-3-0 record from Dec. 9, 2022 on. In that span, the 'Nooks swept UAA 6-0 in the season series to grab their 12th-straight Alaska Airlines Governor's Cup, they grabbed a 3-2 win at #19/17 Notre Dame on Dec. 31, 2022 and picked up a 3-1 win at #1/2 Denver - their first-ever win in Magness Arena. In the final 12 games of the season, the Nanooks posted an 11-1-0 record to finish 22-10-2, their most wins since Guy Gadowsky led the 01-02 Nanooks to a 22-12-3, 15-10-3 CCHA record.\n\nUnder Largen this season, Matt Radomsky was named the Hockey Commissioners Association December Goaltender of the Month. Largen was also named a Spencer Penrose Award Finalist and was named the 2022-23 Everything College Hockey Coach of the Year. On April 12, 2023 Largen signed a new five-year extension to stay with the Nanooks through the 2027-28 season.\n\nPrior to joining the Alaska Nanooks hockey staff, Largen spent the 2015-16 season as head coach for the Marian University hockey team, an NCAA Division III program located in Fond du lac, Wisconsin. In his inaugural season as bench boss, Largen led the Sabres to an 18-7-3 season overall and a 15-4-1 mark in Northern Athletics Collegiate Conference play.\n\nLargen brings a variety of coaching experience to the table, with stints in the United States Hockey League, the North American Hockey League and the Minnesota Junior Hockey League. Largen also served as the assistant coach for the Fairbanks Ice Dogs from 2009-2011. During his tenure, the Ice Dogs were the Robertson Cup runners-up in 2010 and claimed the championship in 2011.\n\nLargen is also featured on the College Hockey Honor Roll in the Fairbanks Hockey Hall of Fame and has been instrumental in organizing many community events that the Alaska Nanook hockey team participates in.\n\nLargen Career Coaching Record: 54-71-15 (.439)\n\nRecord at Alaska: 36-64-12 (.375)\n\n2015-16* 18-7-3, 15-4-1 NACC 2018-19 0-21-3, 0-14-2 WCHA^ 2019-20 0-15-5, 0-9-5 WCHA^ 2020-21 Canceled due to COVID-19 2021-22 14-18-2 (Independent) 2022-23 22-10-2 (Independent)\n\n*at Marian University\n\n^ wins vacated by Committee on Infractions"
