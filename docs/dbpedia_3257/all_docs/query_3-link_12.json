The Saints (17-6-3) are currently the #21 ranked team in the nation with the Auggies (15-9-2) two spots below them at the #23 spot.\n\nSAINTS LAST TIME OUT\n\nThe St. Scholastica men's hockey team hosted the Semifinals game last Sunday night against St. Olaf College. The Saints would score two in the first and another in the second, but the Oles would add two of their own in the second period as well. Although, it would be the Saints who would hold their one-goal lead all the way until the last remaining seconds and knock off the 2022 MIAC Playoff champions, 3-2.\n\nUPCOMING MATCHUP\n\nThe Saints will see Augsburg University in the finals, the Auggies advanced with a 3-1 semifinal win over Saint John's University last weekend. These two teams saw each other last month, CSS took five of six standings points in the regular season series on February 17-18, earning a shootout victory on Friday night and a regulation win on Saturday.\n\nAfter the St. Olaf victory, Duluth New Tribune's Brandon Veale spoke with Head Coach Dave Williams and here is what he said about his upcoming opponents, \"our speed will help us against them. They're really heavy on their sticks and good in 50/50 battles, but I think we have the advantage in transition and top-end speed. It's going to be a battle. They're going to have a chip on their shoulder after last weekend, so we're ready for a good test here\".\n\nCSS LEADERS\n\nArkhip Ledenkov (Polotsk, Belarus/Ostroshitsko-Gorodokskaya (New York Aviators-USPHL)), 20G-26A-46P\n\nCarsen Richels (Ham Lake, Minn./Blaine HS(University of New Hampshire)), 19G-21A-40P\n\nFilimon Ledenkov (Polotsk, Belarus/Ostroshitsko-Gorodokskaya (New York Aviators-USPHL)), 12G-28A-40P\n\nJack Bostedt (Janesville, Wis./Janesville Craig HS (Minnesota Mullets-USPHL)), 2.58GAA-0.923SV%\n\nAUG LEADERS\n\nAustin Dollimer, 12G-18A-30P\n\nGavin Holland, 13G-11A-24P\n\nSamuel Vyletelka, 1.98 GAA, .923SV%\n\nMATCHUP HISTORY\n\nLast Matchup: CSS won 4-1, on 2/18/23\n\nOverall Series: CSS leads 18-15-4\n\nHome Record: 8-6-3 | Away Record: 6-8-1\n\nStay tuned for a full recap of tomorrow's game, keep checking csssaints.com and follow us on social media!"
