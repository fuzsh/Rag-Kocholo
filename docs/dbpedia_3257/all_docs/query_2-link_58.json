        "text": "MARQUETTE, Mich. - Former Northern Michigan University hockey player Dave Shyiak has been named his alma mater's fourth head hockey coach, announced by Athletic Director Rick Comley on Wednesday.\n\n“I’m thrilled that Dave Shyiak will be returning to campus to lead our hockey program,” Comley said. “Dave was a part of our National Championship team and helped keep our program at an extremely high level as an assistant coach for many years.”\n\nA 1991 graduate of Northern Michigan University, Shyiak played four seasons with the Wildcats (1987-91), where he helped captain the 1991 National Championship team and was a member of both the 1989 and 1991 WCHA Playoff championship teams. Shyiak returned to Northern to begin his coaching career as an assistant (1995-2002) under Comley before being promoted to associate head coach for three seasons (2002-05).\n\nAfter his time at Northern, Shyiak took over as the head coach at Alaska Anchorage for eight years, then went on to experience success at Western Michigan and St. Cloud. He has 25-plus years of coaching experience at the collegiate level, where he has been behind the bench for over 1,000 NCAA games, along with an appearance in the NCAA National Championship game and five NCAA tournament appearances.\n\nComley added, “Dave is the right person, at the right time, in the right place to lead Northern Michigan back to a national level of success.”\n\n“This is an incredible opportunity to return to my home away from home,” Shyiak said. “Northern Michigan and Marquette are really special to me and my family. We have remained close to a lot of our friends and fellow alums in the Upper Peninsula. To start as a student-athlete in 1987 and come full circle to lead the hockey program as head coach is something for which I will forever be grateful. I want to thank President Tessman and Rick Comley for believing in me. I feel honored and privileged, and I will do everything I can to make this University and community proud.”\n\nShyiak has spent the past four seasons as the associate head coach at St. Cloud State. With the Huskies, he helped lead the program to new heights with three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, including an NCAA runner-up finish in 2020-21.\n\nUnder Shyiak’s guidance, six SCSU defensemen have earned All-NCHC honors. This past season, blueliner Dylan Anhorn was named an AHCA/CCM Hockey Men's Second Team West All-American.\n\nShyiak joined SCSU’s staff after serving as an associate head coach at Western Michigan University from 2014-20. In Kalamazoo, Shyiak helped the Broncos gain an NCAA Tournament berth in 2017, along with earning home ice in the NCHC playoffs in 2017, 2019 and 2020. Prior to his tenure at WMU, Shyiak worked as an amateur hockey scout for the Toronto Maple Leafs organization from 2013-14.\n\nHis first collegiate head coach position was at the University of Alaska Anchorage from 2005-13. He ranks as the Seawolves all-time win leader as a coach during the WCHA era with 80 wins and helped UAA advance to the WCHA Final Five.\n\nIn 1994-95, Shyiak was the general manager and head coach for the Merritt Centennials of the BCJHL and his junior hockey resume includes one season as the head coach of the Kimberley Dynamiters of the RMJHL in 1993-94. Shyiak was a player/coach for one season with the Murrayfield Racers of the Super League-British Ice Hockey in 1991-92.\n\nAn evaluator for the USA Hockey selection camps in Michigan from 2015 to 2020, Shyiak served as a coach at the USA Hockey national selection camp in Buffalo, N.Y. in 2020. He has also served as a guest coach for the Washington Capitals Development Camp in 2010 and the Swedish National U20 Team Camp in 2009.\n\nDave and his wife, Lucia – a former two-time NMU All-American volleyball standout – have three children, Kristian, Sheldon, and Isabela.\n\nIntroductory Press Conference\n\nA public press conference/meet and greet with head coach Dave Shyiak and NMU athletic director Rick Comley will take place at 11 a.m. Friday, June 28, in the Wildcat Room. The public and local media are encouraged to attend.\n\nA Zoom option will be available for national media. The press conference will also be live-streamed on the NMU Wildcats YouTube page. Please reach out to Zach Nicholas (znichola@nmu.edu) for more information."
