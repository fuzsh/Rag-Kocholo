        "text": "The NCAA crowns its national champion at the culmination of the college hockey season, the Frozen Four, each spring. Held before sellout crowds at NHL arenas, the Frozen Four consists of the two semifinal games and one championship game, played over three days.\n\nIn 2023, Quinnipiac University earned its first-ever national title rallying from a two-goal deficit to earn a 3-2 overtime against Minnesota in the NCAA title game. Sophomore forward Jacob Quillan scored just 10 seconds into the extra period to give the Bobcats the title in front of a crowd of 19,444 at Amalie Arena in Tampa. It was the fastest OT goal in championship game history.\n\n2023 Championship Recap\n\nThe Frozen Four crowns the winner of the NCAA Tournament, which has been held since 1948. The tournament expanded to its current 16-team format in 2003. The tournament opens at four regional sites of four teams each, with the winners advancing to the Frozen Four.\n\nOver time, the Frozen Four has become more than just the games â€“ it's a weekend long celebration of college hockey. Thousands of fans attend year after year, regardless of the teams involved, creating crowds filled with dozens of different jerseys. On the day between games college hockey celebrates some of its best, with the presentation of the Hobey Baker Award, the Hockey Humanitarian Award, the Mike Richter Award and the AHCA All-America Teams.\n\nFuture Frozen Fours have been awarded to St. Paul (2024), St. Louis (2025) and Las Vegas (2026).\n\nAll-Time Men's Frozen Four Tournament History"
