He has led the River Hawks to six NCAA Tournament bids (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2022), in addition to three Hockey East Tournament Championships (2013, 2014, 2017), two Hockey East regular-season titles (2013, 2017) and one Frozen Four appearance (2013). He also guided the team to five consecutive Hockey East Championship Game appearances (2013-2017) and has compiled seven, 20-win seasons since taking over at the helm of the program in the fall of 2011.\n\nBazin owns a 254-145-39 record (.624 win%) in his 12 seasons as the River Hawks’ head coach. He is the second winningest coach in the program's history, behind Bill Riley with 363 wins. His .624 win percentage ranks eighth in the country among active coaches with at least 100 wins. He has posted a 149-97-30 record in Hockey East regular-season play in his time at UMass Lowell, which ranks first among active Hockey East coaches and second all-time behind only Jerry York (160-72-25). In Hockey East Tournament action, Bazin boasts a 25-14-0 mark, once again taking the top spot among active coaches in the league.\n\nThroughout his coaching career, Bazin has coached 15 All-Americans, 38 All-League Players and 30 players who have played in the National Hockey League. More recently, nine of his players at UMass Lowell have gone onto play at the top level, including Vezina Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck, Chad Ruhwedel, C.J. Smith, Michael Kapla, Christian Folin, Scott Wilson, Joe Gambardella, Kevin Boyle and Lucas Condotta. Ruhwedel, Wilson and Hainsey also have their names etched on the Stanley Cup, as part of the Pittsburgh Penguins teams that won titles in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn 2012-13, Bazin guided UMass Lowell (28-11-2 overall, 16-9-2 in Hockey East) to a historic season, which included several firsts: the Hockey East regular-season and tournament championships, the NCAA Tournament Northeast Region Championship, as well as the program's first-ever appearance in the NCAA Frozen Four. Along the way, Bazin was named the Hockey East Coach of the Year for the second straight year, as well as the recipient of the Spencer Penrose Award for Division I Men's Coach of the Year.\n\nBazin’s 19-win increase in his inaugural 2011-12 campaign from 2010-11 set an NCAA Division I record for largest turnaround by a first-year head coach.\n\nHe was named the sixth head coach in UMass Lowell’s history on April 21, 2011. His return to the university came after three successful seasons as head coach at Hamilton College, and eight years as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator at Colorado College.\n\nBazin was a forward on the hockey team at UMass Lowell from 1990-94 playing for legendary coach Bill Riley and Bruce Crowder. He also served as an assistant coach for the River Hawks from 1996-2000 under then head coach Tim Whitehead, helping to guide the River Hawks to Hockey East Tournament semifinal appearances in 1997 and 1998. He was integral in recruiting standouts, such as All-American and NHL veteran Ron Hainsey, as well as Hockey East all-star Brad Rooney (`01); Yorick Treille ('02) and Laurent Meunier ('02), both members of the French Olympic squad at the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.\n\nBazin received his bachelor's degree in criminal justice in just three and a half years at UMass Lowell and earned his master's degree in education administration in 1999. A native of Notre Dame de Lourdes, Manitoba, he played professionally for the Birmingham Bulls (ECHL) and the Cincinnati Cyclones (IHL) in 1994-95.\n\nBazin has two sons, Blake and Coleston. He resides in Windham, N.H.\n\nNORM BAZIN YEAR-BY-YEAR (2011-PRESENT) Year Position School Record Notes 1996-97 Assistant Coach UMass Lowell 15-21-2 HEA Semifinals 1997-98 Assistant Coach UMass Lowell 16-17-3 HEA Semifinals 1998-99 Assistant Coach UMass Lowell 17-19-0 HEA Tournament 1999-00 Assistant Coach UMass Lowell 9-22-3 N/A 2000-01 Assistant Coach Colorado College 27-13-1 NCAA Quarterfinal 2001-02 Assistant Coach Colorado College 27-13-3 NCAA Quarterfinal 2002-03 Assistant Coach Colorado College 30-7-5 NCAA Quarterfinal 2003-04 Assistant Coach Colorado College 20-16-3 WCHA Tournament 2004-05 Assistant Coach Colorado College 31-9-3 NCAA Frozen Four 2005-06 Assistant Coach Colorado College 24-16-2 NCAA Midwest Regional 2006-07 Assistant Coach Colorado College 18-17-4 WCHA Tournament 2007-08 Assistant Coach Colorado College 28-11-1 NCAA West Regional 2008-09 Head Coach Hamilton College 9-15-1 NESCAC Quarterfinal 2009-10 Head Coach Hamilton College 15-9-2 NESCAC Semifinal 2010-11 Head Coach Hamilton College 14-7-4 NESCAC Quarterfinal 2011-12 Head Coach UMass Lowell 24-13-1 NCAA East Regional Final 2012-13 Head Coach UMass Lowell 28-11-2 Hockey East Regular-Season and Tournament Champions\n\nFrozen Four 2013-14 Head Coach UMass Lowell 26-11-4 HEA Tournament Champions\n\nNCAA Northeast Regional Final 2014-15 Head Coach UMass Lowell 21-12-6 Hockey East Championship Game 2015-16 Head Coach UMass Lowell 25-10-5 Hockey East Championship Game\n\nNCAA East Regional Final 2016-17 Head Coach UMass Lowell 27-11-3 HEA Regular-Season Champions\n\nHEA Tournament Champions\n\nNCAA Northeast Regional Final 2017-18 Head Coach UMass Lowell 17-19-0 Hockey East First Round 2018-19 Head Coach UMass Lowell 19-13-5 Hockey East Quarterfinals 2019-20 Head Coach UMass Lowell 18-10-6 Postseason Canceled due to COVID-19 2020-21 Head Coach UMass Lowell 10-9-1 Hockey East Championship Game 2021-22 Head Coach UMass Lowell 21-11-3 NCAA Loveland Regional First Round 2022-23 Head Coach UMass Lowell 18-15-3 Hockey East Quarterfinals TOTALS 15 years as NCAA Head Coach 292-176-46 (.613) 12 years at UMass Lowell\n\n254-145-39 (.624)"
