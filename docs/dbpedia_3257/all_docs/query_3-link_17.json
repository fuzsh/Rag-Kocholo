        "text": "DULUTH, Minn. – The 2023 Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) Men's Hockey Playoffs continued on Sunday night with the second of two weekend semifinal contests. The top-seeded St. Scholastica Saints held off No. 5 St. Olaf, 3-2, to secure their first-ever berth in the MIAC Men's Hockey Playoff Championship game.\n\nWith the win, the Saints will now host No. 2 Augsburg in the MIAC Playoff title game next Saturday, March 4. The Auggies defeated No. 3 Saint John's, 3-1, in the first semifinal matchup yesterday.\n\nNO. 1 ST. SCHOLASTICA 3, NO. 5 ST. OLAF 2 | Box Score |\n\nSt. Scholastica successfully defended its home ice with a 3-2 victory over playoff road warriors and 2022 MIAC Playoff champion St. Olaf on Sunday night. The Oles entered the game having won four straight road Playoff games dating back to last season. The Brothers Ledenkov got the Saints on the board early, as Filimon Ledenkov scored the game's first goal on a power play at 6:47 in the opening period and his brother, Arkhip Ledenkov, added a second goal two minutes later. Connor Kalthoff cut the CSS lead in half with the Oles' first score of the game midway through the second period before Bryce Johnson tallied the eventual game-winner for St. Scholastica at 13:57 in the second. Tyler Cooper scored for the Oles at 17:42 in the second period to keep the game close; however, neither goaltender would allow another score in the contest. Both squads took 48 shots in the game, with the Saints narrowly placing more on-goal by a margin of 25 to 23.\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP GAME SET FOR SATURDAY\n\nThe MIAC Men's Hockey Playoffs will now will conclude the same way the regular season did - with Augsburg and St. Scholastica squaring off with the championship on the line. The Saints took five of six standings points in the regular season series on February 17-18, earning a regulation win and shootout victory versus the Auggies. This will be the first-ever MIAC Playoff matchup between the two programs.\n\nThe MIAC Men's Hockey Playoff Championship Game is tentatively set for 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 4 at Mars Lakeview Arena in Duluth. The MIAC Playoff champion will receive the postseason championship plaque and the conference's automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA Division III Men's Hockey Tournament.\n\n2023 MIAC MEN'S HOCKEY PLAYOFF SCHEDULE\n\nQuarterfinals | Friday, Feb. 24, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nNo. 5 St. Olaf 4, No. 4 Concordia | Box Score |\n\nSemifinals | Saturday, Feb. 25, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nNo. 2 Augsburg 3, No. 3 Saint John's 1 | Box Score |\n\nSemifinals | Sunday, Feb. 26, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nNo. 1 St. Scholastica 3, No. 5 St. Olaf 2 | Box Score |\n\nChampionship | Saturday, Mar. 4, 2023 | 7:00 p.m. |\n\nNo. 2 Augsburg at No. 1 St. Scholastica"
