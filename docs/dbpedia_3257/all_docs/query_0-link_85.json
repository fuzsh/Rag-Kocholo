        "text": "Chicago was a candidate city for the 2016 Summer Olympics but lost to Rio de Janeiro. Chicago also hosted the 1959 Pan American Games, the 2006 Gay Games, as well as the 1968 and 1970 Special Olympics Summer World Games. Chicago was the host of the 2017 Warrior Games.\n\nSee also: U.S. cities with teams from four major sports\n\nThe following is a list of active, professional major-league Chicago sports teams, ranked by attendance:\n\nClub League Sport Venue Attendance Founded Championships Last Championship Chicago Bears NFL Football Soldier Field 62,358 1919 1 Super Bowl, 8 prior Championships 1985 Chicago Cubs MLB Baseball Wrigley Field 41,268 1870 3 World Series wins (and 1 tie) 2016 Chicago White Sox MLB Baseball Guaranteed Rate Field 40,615 1900 3 World Series 2005 Chicago Bulls NBA Basketball United Center 21,876 1966 6 NBA Championships 1998 Chicago Blackhawks NHL Ice hockey United Center 21,775 1926 6 Stanley Cups 2015 Chicago Fire MLS Soccer Toyota Park 15,602 1997 1 MLS Cup, 1 Supporters Shield 1998 Chicago Sky WNBA Basketball Allstate Arena 5,573 2006 2014 Finals N/A Chicago Red Stars NWSL Soccer Toyota Park 3,060 2006 2015 and 2016 Semifinals N/A\n\nBaseball (MLB)\n\nChicago is one of four metro areas in the United States that has two Major League Baseball teams, the other three being Los Angeles, New York, and the San Francisco Bay Area, and is one of only two, along with New York, which has both teams in the central city. The city has two Major League Baseball (MLB) teams: the Chicago Cubs of the National League (NL), who play in Wrigley Field on the North Side; and the Chicago White Sox of the American League (AL), who play in Guaranteed Rate Field on the South Side. Chicago is the only city that has had more than one MLB franchise every year since the AL began in 1901 (New York only hosted one between 1958 and early 1962, and Los Angeles has only done so since 1961).\n\nThe Chicago Cubs of the National League play at Wrigley Field, which is located in the north side neighborhood of Lakeview, the western part of which is commonly referred to as “Wrigleyville.” The Cubs’ rivalry with the St. Louis Cardinals is one of the most bitter in North American professional sports. The Cubs are the oldest team to play continuously in the same city since the formation of the National League in 1876. The Cubs are the oldest Major League Baseball team to have never changed their city, one of nine out of the sixteen teams to predate expansion that have not changed cities. They have played in Chicago since 1871, and continuously so since 1874 due to the Great Chicago Fire. They have played more games, have more wins and scored more runs than any other team in Major League baseball since 1876. They have won three World Series titles and are fifth among National League teams with 16 pennants. In 2016, the Cubs broke the two longest droughts in professional sports: They won their sport’s title for the first time since 1908 a drought of 108 years, and participated in a World Series for the first time since 1945 a drought of 71 years, both records in their respective rights.\n\nThe Chicago White Sox of the American League play at Guaranteed Rate Field, which is located in the South Side neighborhood of Armour Square. They have played in Chicago since the formation of the American League in 1900. The White Sox have played on the South Side continuously since 1901, with all three of their home fields throughout the years being within mere blocks of one another. They have won three World Series titles (1906, 1917, 2005) and six American League pennants, including the first in 1901. The Sox are fifth in the American League in all-time wins, and sixth in pennants.\n\nBasketball (NBA, WNBA)\n\nThe Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association is a professional basketball team. Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen led the Bulls to six NBA championships in two “threepeats” from 1991–1993 and again from 1996–1998. The new generation of Bulls, known as “The Baby Bulls”, emerged in 2005. In 2007, they swept the defending champs, the Miami Heat. In 2011, led by league MVP Derrick Rose, the Bulls made it to the Eastern Finals, losing to the Miami Heat.\n\nChicago is home to the Chicago Sky of the Women’s National Basketball Association.\n\nThe Bears’ rivalry with the Green Bay Packers dates back the 1920s, and is one of the most intense in American professional sports. The Bears have other regional and divisional rivalries with the Minnesota Vikings and the Detroit Lions.\n\nThe Bears play their home games at Soldier Field, named after “The men and women of the armed forces”. It is located next to the shores of Lake Michigan, on Lake Shore Drive. Soldier Field was an aging stadium and was in dire need of renovation by the end of the 20th century. In 2003, the stadium re-opened after an extensive renovation, which increased the number of luxury boxes and dramatically improved the game day experience for Bears fans. However, because of this renovation, the stadium lost its National Historic Landmark designation on February 17, 2006.\n\nIce hockey (NHL)\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League is the city’s professional ice hockey team, and are an Original Six team. The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 1934, 1938, 1961, 2010, 2013, and again in 2015. The Blackhawks receive national attention for the intense rivalries with the Detroit Red Wings, also an Original Six team. Other rivalries include the Vancouver Canucks, St. Louis Blues (former Norris Division rivals), and the Nashville Predators. Some well-known players include: Stan Mikita, Tony Esposito, Bobby Hull, Keith Magnuson, Glenn Hall, Denis Savard, Steve Larmer, Jeremy Roenick, Chris Chelios, Ed Belfour, Patrick Kane, Patrick Sharp, Marian Hossa, Corey Crawford, and the current captain Jonathan Toews.\n\nSoccer (MLS, NWSL)\n\nSee also: Chicago Sparta and Chicago Sting\n\nSoccer in Chicago, IL can be traced back to Chicago Sparta.

The Fire won their sole MLS Cup in 1998, their inaugural season, led by head coach Bob Bradley, who later went on to coach the U.S. national soccer team. The Fire have played since 2006 at Toyota Park, a soccer-specific stadium located in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview near Midway Airport. The Fire have historically drawn an attendance average of over 15,000 fans per game. The Fire originally played at Soldier Field, also spending parts of two seasons at Cardinal Stadium in Naperville. Some notable former players include Cuauhtémoc Blanco from Mexico, Brian McBride from the USA, and Peter Nowak from Poland – a demonstration of the team’s international flavor.\n\nChicago is also home to the Chicago Red Stars, currently playing in the National Women’s Soccer League.
