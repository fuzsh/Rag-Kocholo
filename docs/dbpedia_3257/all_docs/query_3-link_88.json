He also held the school records for career rushing (1,764 yards) and single-game rushing (236 vs. Clarion in 1968) at the conclusion of his Rock career.\n\nFollowing his Rock career, Wagner received contract offers from the Buffalo Bills and New York Jets of the National Football League.\n\nWagner retired at the end of the 2004-05 academic year after 35 years as a fifth grade teacher in the Moniteau School District. During that time, he also coached football, track and field and golf at Moniteau, as well as youth basketball and baseball.\n\nA 1966 graduate of Cambria Heights High School, Wagner received both his bachelor (1970) and master (1973) degrees from SRU.\n\nWagner is a former member of the Eau Claire borough council and parks and recreation commission.\n\nFootball coaching staff 1972-74\n\nThe first-ever Special Recognition Award will be presented to the five men who comprised The Rock football coaching staff during the 1972, 1973 and 1974 seasons.\n\nDuring that three-year time span, The Rock captured three straight Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference championships and compiled a 24-5-1 won-lost record.\n\nThe induction of the Class of 2005 will increase to 144 the number of former student-athletes, coaches, administrators or supporters who have been inducted into the SRU Athletic Hall of Fame since its inception in 1984."
