        "text": "Standing before a crowd of fans, community members, local dignitaries and his championship winning team at Magness Arena, head coach David Carle uttered the words everyone was thinking.\n\nâWe are the indisputable, best program in college hockey,â he remarked. âYou could have argued it a couple of months ago, but you canât argue it anymore.â\n\nThe University of Denver hockey team has reached the mountaintop: They are the kings of college hockey. Denver defeated Boston College 2-0 on April 13 for the programâs NCAA record-breaking 10th national championship. This yearâs title run had a little bit of everythingâleaving fans and the entire hockey program with memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nâBefore we won, we were recruiting kids who wanted to come do something special, and now we're recruiting kids who want to come here because we did something special,â Carle said in an interview in his office weeks after the championship.\n\nAlthough theyâve reached the mountaintop, Carle and the team still have higher peaks in their sights.\n\nâItâs important that we continue to stay diligent in getting the right people and the winning will then continue to follow,â Carle says.\n\nLook back at the moments that made Denver the kings of college hockey.\n\n2024\n\nDenver vs. Boston College, 2-0\n\nXcel Energy Center, St. Paul, Minn.\n\nWhile Denverâs 2024 championship was largely the tale of 10, it was also the story of goalie Matt Davis. Davis, who was named the Frozen Four Most Outstanding Player, made 23 third period saves during DUâs championship win against Boston College and captured what is now affectionately called âthe save of the century.\" BC was shut out for the first time since March 11, 2023, when they lost 1-0 to Merrimack. The Eagles had the second-best offense in the countryâDUâs being the firstâduring the regular season with 4.38 goals per game. Davis finished the NCAA Tournament with 138 saves and just three goals allowed.\n\nJared Wright scored the first goal for DU in the second period, off a pass from Rieger Lorenz that ricocheted off the near post, bounced off BC goaltender Jacob Fowler's back and into the net. Lorenz then scored the second goal off a pass from Zeev Buium to make it 2-0. Buium, Lorenz, Davis, and their teammates Sean Behrens and Tristan Broz were named to the All-Tournament Team.\n\nThis was a record-breaking season for Denver in more ways than one. For the first time in program history, DU reached at least 30 wins in three straight seasons. Denver was one of two teams in college hockey to reach the 30-win threshold this yearâthe other being Boston College. The team also played its longest NCAA Tournament game ever against UMass on March 28, when they won 2-1 in double overtime. The senior class is also among the winningest group in school history with 103 victories in 149 career games.\n\nâThis community means so much to all of us, and we're just so excited to bring that 10th here and raise another banner,â Davis said ahead of the championship celebration. \"Itâs the best program in college hockey, and there's a reason for that, and I'm just so proud to be part of it.â\n\n2022\n\nDenver vs. Minnesota State, 5-1\n\nTD Garden, Boston, Mass.\n\nDUâs ninth national title was Carleâs first as head coachâjust four years after taking the helm. Carle was the youngest head coach to win a national title since 1963 and the fourth youngest ever. The 2022 championship also moved Denver ahead of North Dakota and into a tie with Michigan for the most national championships among all schools.\n\nMinnesota State started the game off strong and led 1-0 until the third period, but it was goalie Magnus Chrona that kept the Pioneers in the game. DU then had five goal scorers in the third periodâRyan Barrow, Mike Benning, Massimo Rizzo, Brett Stapley and Cameron Wright.\n\n\"I am so proud of what our team was able to accomplish this year,\" Carle said. \"I owe a lot of what I have in my life to the university. This program is very special; it means the world to me. We are all so proud to be Denver Pioneers today.\""
