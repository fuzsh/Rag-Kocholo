        "text": "The Falcon men's hockey team went unbeaten in a two game weekend road trip after dropping the Saints of the College of St. Scholastica by a score of 5-3 on Saturday night.\n\nLast night, the Falcons were victorious thanks to a stunning goal by Geoff Shewmake (Chicago, IL, Bradford, GMHL) with seven seconds remaining in overtime at Sinto S. Wessman against the Yellow Jackets of UW- Superior. Tonight, the Falcons continued their road trip as they headed to Mars Lakeview Arena in Duluth, Minn., to face off against the College of St. Scholastica. The matchup was the fourth and final consecutive away game for the Falcons in their past two weeks on the road.\n\nThe last time the Falcon's faced off against the Saints was on the 15th in the second game of a weekend series at Hunt Arena between the two teams. The Saints were victorious in the first game 3-2, but the Falcons came back the following night with a big 3-1 victory to tie the series 1-1.\n\nAt goaltender for the Falcons was Scott Lewan (Westland, MI, Alberni Valley, BCHL), who earned the second shutout of his young collegiate career last night against the Yellow Jackets. The Saints tried their luck with their junior goaltender Brennan Poderzay after the Falcons went 1-1 against Patrick Sullivan earlier this month.\n\nThe first period nearly went scoreless as the Saints outshot the Falcons 14-5. Jeremy Dawes gave the Saints a 1-0 lead after sinking a shot against Lewan at 18:57 on a power play with assists coming from Riley Riddell and Neil Sauter. The power play was the result of a cross-checking penalty on Caleb Wolfgram (White Bear Lake, MN, Topeka, NAHL).\n\nJohn Bullis (Frisco, TX, Texas, NAHL) tied the score at 2:39 in the second period with his first goal of the season. Assisting Bullis was Sean Roadhouse (Tulsa, OK, Texas, NAHL) and Martin Sundstedt (McKinney, TX, Topeka, NAHL).\n\nJustin Brossman (Littleton, CO, Sioux City, USHL) gave the Falcons the lead at with a goal at 8:49. Brossman, the Falcon's current leader in points scored this season, was assisted by Alec Hagaman (Peoria, IL, Topeka, NAHL) and Derek Kaiser (Crookston, MN, Alexandria, NAHL).\n\nThe Saints tied the score with their second goal of the game on another power play following a series of penalties at 10:27 in the second period. Andrew Harrison (Sault Ste. Marie, ONT, Fargo-Moorhead, NAHL) racked up 15 minutes in the box for checking from behind and game misconduct, while Falcons Jon Schreiner (Lakeville, MN, Fairbanks, NAHL) and Hagaman received minor penalties for roughing. Also penalized for the altercation were Saints Paul Marcoux and Daman Milsom, who received roughing penalties as well.\n\nScoring the game-tying power play goal for the Saints at 12:46 was Carter Davis, his ninth score of the season. Davis was assisted by Brendan Bradbury and Eric Kraft.\n\nRyne Bodger also capitalized on the extended power play opportunity at 14:31 by scoring his first goal of the season to give the Saints a 3-2 lead. Alex Valenti and Dawes were awarded assists on the score.\n\nNow that the Falcons were back in 5 on 5 play, Ryan Goodmanson (Clear Lake, Kenai River, NAHL) was able to come up big for his team and score at 16:47 to tie the score going into the third period. The goal was Goodmanson's first of the season, and he was assisted by Sundstedt and Roadhouse.\n\nThe Falcons outshot the Saints 13-8 in the period.\n\nGoodmanson wasn't done yet, as he nailed his second goal of the night and season at 6:39 in the third period. The goal was the game winner that would give the Falcons a lead that would not diminish for the rest of the game. Assisting Goodmanson was Jeff Burke (New Richmond, Topeka, NAHL) and Bullis. It has been a big weekend for the junior transition player Bullis, who not only tied the score in the first period with a score but has also assisted on both of the game winning scores in the past two games. Bullis leads the Falcons in assists thus far this season with 10.\n\nBrossman put the nail in the coffin after the Saints pulled Poderzay out of the net to give their team an extra forward on the ice. Brossman sunk a shot on the empty net with 20 seconds remaining in the game. The goal was Brossman's 10th of the season, and he was assisted by Roadhouse and Schreiner. Brossman's 10 goals leads the Falcons roster this season.\n\nRoadhouse proved to be a key component of the Falcon's victory against the Saints, as he tallied assists on three of the Falcon scores on the night.\n\nLewan made nine saves in the third period to Poderzay's six. Lewan totaled 28 saves in the game, while Poderzay made 21.\n\nThe Falcons are finally heading back home to Hunt Arena where they will face off against their conference rivals in the Blue Devils of UW- Stout for the third time this season next Friday night. The Falcons are 0-2 against the Blue Devils this season, but hold a cumulative series record of 59-19-1 against them. The opening faceoff for Friday night's matchup is set for 7:05 p.m."
