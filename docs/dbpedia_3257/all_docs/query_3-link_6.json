        "text": "3/18/1967 vs. Boston University | Onondaga County War Memorial, Syracuse, N.Y. | W, 4-1\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Nick Waranoff | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nSYRACUSE, N.Y. — Cornell climaxed a 27-1-1 season by capturing the National Collegiate Ice Hockey Championship with a convincing 4-1 victory over Boston University at the War Memorial before 6,571 fans.\n\nThe decisive manner in which Cornell achieved victory settled any doubts about the Red being the best in the country.\n\nCoach Ned Harkness, won won an NCAA championship in 1954 while at RPI, displayed peerless class after the game. Speaking on the public address system, he praised Boston University and coach Jack Kelley.\n\nCornell's dominance of the tournament was apparent from the awards. Four players — goalie Ken Dryden, defensemen Skip Stanowski and Harry Orr, and center Mike Doran — all were named to the All-Tournament Team. Jim Quinn of Boston University and Tom Mikkola of Michigan State rounded out the team.\n\nStanowski, in addition, was named the most valuable player in the tourney.\n\n1967-68 - National Semifinalist; ECAC Hockey Regular Season, Tournament Champions (27-2-0, 17-1-0 ECAC)\n\n3/15/1968 vs. North Dakota | Duluth Arena Auditorium, Duluth, Minn. | L, 1-3\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Malcolm I. Ross | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nDULUTH, Minn. — Cornell was eliminated from championship consideration as Ned Harkness' icemen's streak of 23 consecutive victories was snapped by an extremely hard-checking and fast-skating North Dakota team. Cornell's final record for the season is 27-2.\n\nThe Big Red came up against a rugged North Dakota team who body checked the Red into a game below its capabilities. Bill Selman's Sioux, though lacking great finesse or shooting ability, emphasized the skating aspect of the ice game and were particularly outstanding on defense.\n\nThe Nodaks constantly flew after the puck and, although their teamwork left something to be desired, kept constant pressure on the Red, much of it physical, while staving off any organized rushes across their blueline.\n\nCornell was never out of the game, however, and only some missed opportunities caused the loss. Thought North Dakota appeared better to the 3,521 in attendance, Cornell could easily have made the championship round with a break or two.\n\nBrian Cornell averted a shutout as the John Hughes-Cornell-Pete Tufford line converted a scramble at 11:09 [of the third period].\n\nKen Dryden had 30 saves for the game.\n\n3/16/1968 vs. Boston College | Duluth Arena Auditorium, Duluth, Minn. | W, 6-1\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Malcolm I. Ross | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nDULUTH, Minn. — The Big Red went on to take third place in the tourney by defeating Boston College, 6-1.\n\nA disappointed Cornell team maintained its pride before 1,811 fans against B.C. in the afternoon consolation match.\n\nBrian Cornell, Bruce Pattison, and Dick Bertrand scored within four minutes of each other in the second half of the first period to give the Red a 3-0 lead.\n\nIt was 6-0 at the end of the second, as Brian Cornell scored two more to earn his hat trick and Tufford added one.\n\nWhitey Allen scored for the losers at 5:52 of the third period to make the final score 6-1 in a game completely dominated by the Big Red.\n\n3/14/1969 vs. Michigan Tech | Broadmoor Arena, Colorado Springs, Colo. | W, 4-3 (OT)\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy David Golomb | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — The season's most bruising match for Cornell, Lowe was the unlikely hero.\n\nThe junior, who had notched just one goal this year going into the tournament and two the year before, got Cornell's second score and then went the length of the ice for the winning tally at 1:40 of the overtime period.\n\nTaking the puck at his own blueline, he carried up the left side, hesitated at the entrance to the Huskies' zone and then crossed ploddingly behind McCutcheon. His shot from a near impossible angle beat goalie Gordie McRae for the game.\n\n3/15/1969 vs. Denver | Broadmoor Arena, Colorado Springs, Colo. | L, 3-4\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy David Golomb | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — Denver University's smooth skating sextet took it all, but not before a plucky underdog squad from Cornell showed it could more than match the highly touted Westerners.\n\nMurray Armstrong's Pioneers scored twice in the last 16 minutes at shadowdy, antiquated Broadmoor World Arena, against a single Big Red tally, to edge Cornell, 4-3, and gain their second consecutive NCAA Ice Hockey Championship. It was Denver's fifth title, topped only by Michigan's seven.\n\nHarkness' squad ignored throughout the tournament by the press and rival coaches alike, skated an uphill battle all night against the Pioneers, twice rallying from a goal back to tie the score. Denver's awesome defense, paced by all-everything Keith Magnuson — the tournament's Most Valuable Player — combined with the altitude to leave the Ithacans gasping at every turn.\n\nStill, the outsized men from Cornell rallied time and again, and with goalie Ken Dryden pulled in favor of an extra skater, almost tied the contest in the last few seconds of play, keeping an overflow crowd of 4,625 on their feet and roaring.\n\n1969-70 - NCAA Champions (29-0-0, 17-0-0 ECAC)\n\n3/19/1970 vs. Wisconsin | Jack Shea Arena, Lake Placid, N.Y. | W, 2-1\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Dave Golomb | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nLAKE PLACID, N.Y. — For the second week in a row Cornell met a superb goalie, and for the second week in a row that goalie came out on the short end.\n\nWayne Thomas, Wisconsin's lean lanky copy of NHL great Terry Sawchuck, shut the Big Red out for 45 minutes and 32 seconds, but in the end Cornell's superior fire power and relentless forechecking saved the day for Ned Harkness' club.\n\nTwo third-period goals gave the Big Red a 2-1 victory in the opening game of the 23rd annual NCAA Ice Hockey Championships.\n\nIt was the same story as in Boston last week when Bruce Bullock held Cornell at bay until the final 14 seconds. Thomas was magnificent, even more so than Bullock, as he time and time against turned away perfectly set up plays. He had 36 saves while Brian Cropper, who had absolutely none in the third period, ended with 14.\n\nCornell outskated Wisconsin throughout the game, permitting only infrequent rushes by the larger, harder-hitting westerners. It was only a matter of time before Harkness's men got the disc by the 6-foot-2, 205-pound goalie, who had many of the moves by Ken Dryden and incredibly quick glove, and a great sense of mobility. When he stopped everything for those first 45 minutes, it was the longest Cornell has been blanked all season.\n\nIt is the second year in a row that Cornell has reached the finals, and the third time in the last four years.\n\nGarth Ryan finally tied it up at 5:32 slamming in a short one after missing twice. Dan Lodboa got the assist.\n\nBill Duthie, who had only four goals in the first 27 games, won the game at 11:01. Untouched 15 feet in front of Thomas, he lofted a backhander past the heroic Badger for the game and a berth in the finals.\n\n1971-72 - National Runner-Up; ECAC Hockey Regular Season Champions (23-6-0, 15-3-0 ECAC)\n\n3/17/1972 vs. Denver | Boston Garden, Boston, Mass. | W, 7-2\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Bill Howard | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBOSTON — The Big Red rode western titlist Denver out of Boston Garden, 7-2, to gain the final against Boston University, 4-1 victor over Wisconsin.\n\nWhat Cornell did to Denver was just short of miraculous. The Pioneers came roaring into the Hub as one of the most heavily favored team in the 25-year history of the playoffs. They had a 27-9-0 record and had captured the title five of those previous years, the same number as all of the East had collectively taken.\n\nDenver's plan was simply: use a highly superior size advantage to intimidate Cornell, then skate among the ruins of the Big Red and ill the net with pucks.\n\nWhile Dave Elenbaas guarded the net — and Cornell's defensemen magnificiently guarded their fragile goalkeeper — Westner rammed four shots past Denver's Ron Grahame, and Larry Fullan, Gord McCormick, and Doug Marrett added single tallies.\n\nAs expected, Denver body checked anything wearing a red jersey into the boards. Somewhere in the confusion, however, stickhandling and passing were forgotten by the Pioneers.\n\nThe Big Red taught Denver a lesson in precision hockey and forechecking. What Cornell gave up in size it gained in maneuverability.\n\nOn defense, Cornell's blue liners collapsed around the net, blocking shots and keeping the Pioneers from taking any cheap shots at Elenbaas. In addition, Ron Simpson tried Denver's style of play and dealt out a few of his own crushing body checks.\n\n3/18/1972 vs. Boston University | Boston Garden, Boston, Mass. | L, 0-4\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Bill Howard | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBOSTON — Whatever magic dust was sprinkled on the Cornell hockey team in the NCAA semifinal round game against Denver disappeared as Cornell fell 4-0 victims to Boston University for the national title.\n\nCornell was methodically dissected by a BU team that left absolutely no doubt in the minds of the 14,995 Garden fans as to who was number one.\n\nThe Terrier power play, 36.5 percent effective the past two years, was 100 percent effective the first two time it was unleashed on the Ithacans. Ron Anderson took pinpoint passes from defensemen Ric Jordan and Bob Brown and converted at 10:42 of the first period. Jordan connected from Brown at 10:51 of the second.\n\nAnderson and Jordan each added goals in the third period, but the outcome had become apparent following the second BU goal. Cornell spent the last half of the game aimlessly flipping the puck into the BU end, unable to mount an attack.\n\nBU goalie Tim Regan, tournament MVP, was highly effective in the nets as Cornell was shut out for the first time since an 8-0 drubbing by Brown in 1964.\n\n1972-73 - National Semifinalist; ECAC Hockey Regular Season, Tournament Champions (23-5-1, 14-2-1 ECAC)\n\n3/16/1973 vs. Wisconsin | Boston Garden, Boston, Mass. | L, 5-6 (OT)\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Bill Howard | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBOSTON — The jerseys, the shin pads and the skates have been packed away for another year, along with Cornell's dreams of a national hockey championship. The Big Red came close, within five seconds, but wound up fourth in the NCAA hockey tournament in Boston Garden.\n\nDean Taiafous scored the tying goal with five seconds to play and the winning goal as Wisconsin made up a 4-0 deficit to beat Cornell, 6-5, in overtime in the semifinals.\n\nForty seconds into the game Doug Marrett trickled a shot past Dick Perkins. Eight minutes later Don Cecil rifled a shot off the backboard and Paul Perras swooped in on the puck wound up, and Perkins was down 2-0.\n\nBefore a Wisconsin player ever touched the puck in the second period, George Kuzmicz had Cornell up 3-0 on a slap shot from the left point at 31 seconds.\n\nThen Mike McGuire hit from a steep angle on the right side at 4:39, and the 70-piece Wisconsin band and 2,000 Wisconsin rooters realized that the end of the trail had about been reached for the Badgers, who had squeaked into the NCAA tourney the week before.\n\nFor a few blessed moments the Badger band in the first deck was silent, but down on the ice Wisconsin kept plugging away.\n\nFinally, at 12 minutes, Norm Cherrey connected with Kuzmicz serving his second penalty of the period. Wisconsin's power play was an exercise in passing perfection — better even than the Boston University power play of last year that cost Cornell two goals in the NCAA title game.\n\nWith that, Wisconsin turned the pressure on and freshman Dennis Olmstead put in an eight-foot backhander with a minute and a half to play in the period and goalie Dave Elenbaas a bit too far out of the cage.\n\nThe third period opened as the other two had, with a Cornell goal, by Bill Murray at 40 seconds. Wisconsin still refused to die. Elenbaas stopped a point-blank shot by Stan Hinckley moments later, but a pass from Dave Pay, alone in the corner, to Gary Winchester, alone in the slot, put the deficit to 5-3 at 8:16.\n\nWith 3:12 remaining, Jim Johnston skated around a Cornell defenseman and tucked the puck between Elenbaas and the post to cut the margin to 5-4. With 42 seconds to play, Perkins was pulled for a sixth-attacked, and the man-advatnage passing was too much. John Taft hit the post with 15 seconds to play, and as the Cornell fans ticket off the seconds, Stan Hinckley passed to Talafous, who was three feet from the cage. The Cornell count stopped at five.\n\nThe overtime belonged to Cornell, except for the one fatal lapse when Talafous found the left half of the net unprotected with 33 seconds to play. Previously, Cecil and Perras had a two-on-none break, but Cecil shot wide, and Dave Peace was unable to lift the puck over Perkins' fallen body after Gord McCormick stole the puck in the Wisconsin end.\n\n3/17/1973 vs. Boston College | Boston Garden, Boston, Mass. | L, 1-3\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Bill Howard | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBOSTON — Cornell played BC in a game no Red player cared much about; they had beaten BC 3-2 for Eastern supremacy the wek before. A 25-foot slapshot by BC's Bob Reardon opened the second period, and was matched by Doug Marrett's power play rebound after Carlo Ugolini dug the puck off the boards.\n\nAt 12:25 of the second period Ed Kenty got an unassisted goal for BC. A minute later, BC goalie Neil Higgins dropped the puck between his pads and Dave Peace poked it home, but the goal was ruled no goal because the official lost sight of the puck and thought Higgins had it trapped.\n\nCornell pulled Elenbaas in the final minute for a sixth forward, but Higgins held and Jim Doyle scored an open net goal at 19:59 to close Cornell's Season That Almost Was.\n\n1985-86 - ECAC Hockey Tournament Champions (21-7-4, 13-6-2 ECAC)\n\n3/21/1986 at Denver | DU Arena, Denver, Colo. | L, 2-4\n\n3/22/1986 at Denver | DU Arena, Denver, Colo. | W, 4-3\n\nCourtesy of the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nBy Wendy Wagner | Special to the Cornell Daily Sun\n\nDENVER — Despite a 4-3 victory over the University of Denver in the second game of the NCAA quarterfinal round, the Big Red men's hockey team failed to advance to the Final Four in Providence, losing the total-goals series, 7-6.\n\nA different type of series (in the event of a split, the ECAC quarterfinals are decided by a 10-minute minigame) led to a slightly different strategy for Cornell. The chalkboard in the visitor's locker room at the Denver Arena read, “Round One, Round Two, Round Three, Round Four, Round Five, Round Six,” according to Cornell tri-captain Peter Natyshak. Six rounds — or periods — of hockey. 120 minutes in which the Big Red men's hockey team had to outscore the top-ranked Pioneers.\n\nAnd, no big surprise to Cornell fans, it all came down to the sixth and final “round” tied at six goals apiece in the series.\n\nBut, with 9:20 left in the second contest, Denver's David Hanson scored a power-play goal to lift the Pioneers to a 7-6 total-goals victory.\n\nThe Red came oh-so-close when, controlling the puck in Denver's end with 21 seconds left in the contest, head coach Lou Reycroft pulled goaltender Doug Dadswell in favor of an extra skater. The ploy almost worked as, with less than 10 seconds left, an Andy Craig slasphot missed the net by inches, and the Cornell hockey team was left a breath away from a trip to the Final Four in Providence.\n\n1990-91 (18-11-3, 14-6-3 ECAC)\n\n3/15/1991 at Michigan | Yost Ice Arena, Ann Arbor, Mich. | W, 5-4 (OT)\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. — Following a 5-4 overtime victory by Cornell in the opening game of a best-of-three first-round series, Michigan outscored Cornell by a 15-7 margin to advance to the NCAA quarterfinals.\n\nKent Manderville scored an extra-attacker goal with two seconds left to force overtime before Trent Andison netted the winning goal 21 seconds into the extra frame, giving the Big Red a 1-0 lead in the series.\n\nManderville (two goals, one assist) and Doug Derraugh (one goal, two assists) concluded the game with three points apiece.\n\nJim Crozier finished the contest with 14 saves, while Michigan's Steve Shields stopped 33 Big Red shots.\n\n3/16/1991 at Michigan | Yost Ice Arena, Ann Arbor, Mich. | L, 4-6\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. — A four-goal second period aided Michigan to a 6-4 victory over Cornell, forcing a decisive third game in the best-of-three first round series at Yost Ice Arena.\n\nMichigan scored three times in just under four minutes to leap out to a three-goal lead.\n\nDoug Derraugh trimmed the deficit to 3-2 behind a pair of power-play goals in a 49-second span.\n\n3/17/1991 at Michigan | Yost Ice Arena, Ann Arbor, Mich. | L, 3-9\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. — Michigan scored seven unanswered goals to solidify its 9-3 victory over Cornell to lift the Wolverines past the Big Red to claim the best-of-three game NCAA First Round series.\n\nAfter Doug Derraugh opened the scoring with a goal, Michigan scored twice in the first period, four more times in the second, and netted the first marker of the third period to take a six-goal advantage.\n\nBruce Frauley scored a power-play marker before Derraugh added his second goal of the day — his second consecutive multi-goal performance — to make it a 7-3 contest. Michigan tacked on two insurance markers late in the third to solidify the victory.\n\n2002-03 - National Semifinalist; ECAC Hockey Regular Season, Tournament Champions (30-5-1, 19-2-1 ECAC)\n\n3/29/2003 vs. Minnesota State | Dunkin' Donuts Center, Providence, R.I. | W, 5-2\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. — Freshman forward Shane Hynes and sophomore forward Mike Knoepfli scored two goals each, as the Big Red defeated Minnesota State Mankato 5-2 in NCAA Men's Hockey East Regional Championship action at the Dunkin' Donuts Center. Junior center Ryan Vesce also had a career moment, picking up his 100th Cornell point with an assist on the Big Red's fifth goal of the game.\n\n3/30/2005 vs. Boston College | Dunkin' Donuts Center, Providence, R.I. | W, 2-1 (2OT)\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. — Senior Matt McRae scored the game winner at 1:09 of the second overtime, as Cornell edged Boston College 2-1 in the final of the men's East regional NCAA hockey tournament at the Dunkin' Donuts Center.\n\nThe Big Red advances to the Frozen Four in Buffalo to play the University of New Hampshire on Thursday, April 10.\n\nSophomore goaltender Dave LeNeveu made 26 saves, as Cornell improved to 30-4-1. Matti Kaltiainen stopped 34 shots in a superb effort, as the Eagles finished their season at 24-11-4.\n\n4/10/2005 vs. New Hampshire | HSBC Arena, Buffalo, N.Y. | L, 2-3\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y. — Steve Saviano scored twice, including the game winner, as New Hampshire defeated Cornell 3-2 in the NCAA men's Division I semifinal at the HSBC Arena in Buffalo.\n\nJunior center Ryan Vesce and freshman Chris Abbott each scored a goal, while sophomore goaltender Dave LeNeveu made 18 saves for the Big Red, which finished its season at 30-5-1. The loss also ended a 15-game unbeaten streak for Cornell.\n\nTim Horst scored once and Nathan Martz added two assists for New Hampshire, now 28-7-6. Netminder Mike Ayers was outstanding in goal and made 19 stops.\n\n2004-05 - ECAC Hockey Regular Season, Tournament Champions (27-5-3, 18-2-2 ECAC)\n\n3/26/2005 vs. Ohio State | Mariucci Arena, Minneapolis, Minn. | W, 3-2\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — Senior assistant captain Mike Iggulden capped a comeback from a 2-0 deficit with the game-winning goal at the 8:23 mark of the third period to give No. 3/4 Cornell a 3-2 win over No. 8/9 Ohio State in the second semifinal of the NCAA West Regional at Mariucci Arena. Iggulden now has six game winners out of the career-high 10 goals he has scored.\n\nJunior assistant captain Matt Moulson tallied two assists, earning his 100th career point with the second on Iggulden's marker. Moulson now has at least one point in six straight games, five of which are playoff contests. In that stretch, he has recorded three goals and seven assists for 10 points. Sophomore goalie David McKee, one of 10 finalists for the Hobey Baker Award, stopped 34 of the 36 Buckeye shots he faced to pick up his 27th win of the season and run the team's national-best unbeaten streak to 19 games (18-0-1).\n\nOhio State outdid the Big Red in nearly every statistical category, but as has been the case all season, Cornell found a way to pull out the victory. OSU held a shots on goal advantage of 36-20 and converted on 1-of-5 power plays, while holding the Big Red scoreless in three chances.\n\n3/27/2005 at Minnesota | Mariucci Arena, Minneapolis, Minn. | L, 1-2\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — Senior Barry Tallackson scored the game-winner 4:31 into overtime as Minnesota defeated Cornell 2-1 on Easter Sunday afternoon at Mariucci Arena. The loss propelled the Gophers into the Frozen Four and ended Cornell's storybook season at 27-5-3.\n\nTallackson scored on a second effort after Minnesota won the puck in the corner and centered it to the senior. His first shot was denied by Hobey Baker finalist David McKee, his career-best 37th save, but the puck dropped right at Tallackson's stick. He popped the puck just over a sprawling McKee for the game-winner.\n\n2005-06 (22-9-4, 12-6-3 ECAC)\n\n3/25/2006 vs. Colorado College | Resch Center, Green Bay, Wis. | W, 3-2\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. — Cornell dominated the corners in the final two periods and wore down Colorado College, advancing to the NCAA Midwest Regional final with a 3-2 victory over the Tigers at Resch Arena.\n\nThe first two Big Red goals came from familiar faces, as Topher Scott and Matt Moulson got Cornell back in the game, but an unlikely hero, senior Jon Gleed, capitalized and made his first goal of the season a game-winner at 9:20 of the third to give the No. 2 seed its first lead of the contest. Moulson ended the evening with a goal and an assist. David McKee made 20 saves to pick up the victory for the Big Red in goal, stopping all 11 shots he saw in the final 40 minutes.\n\n3/26/2006 vs. Wisconsin | Resch Center, Green Bay, Wis. | L, 0-1 (3OT)\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. — Wisconsin's Jack Skille ended the longest scoreless game in NCAA tournament history at 111:13, ending the Big Red's dreams of a second Frozen Four appearance in four years with a 1-0 triple overtime victory over Cornell at the Resch Center.\n\nThe loss overshadowed a brilliant effort by junior goaltender David McKee, who obliterated his previous career high with 59 saves, which left him two short of the school record. He had turned away 39 shots in a 4-4 tie at St. Lawrence in February.\n\nSenior captain Matt Moulson and assistant captain Jon Gleed were named to the Midwest Regional All-Tournament Team. It is the second NCAA all-region team selection for Moulson, who was also on the West Regional All-Tournament Team last season."
