Bullpen. Gutty effort by everybody,” Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. “All of them did something to pick each other up. It was really a well-played game for us.”\nThe fourth set of consecutive homers for Texas this season came after Tanner Houck struck out seven in the first three innings. That included six consecutive outs on strikes, capped by a 13-pitch at-bat against Marcus Semien to end the third.\n“Two pitches, right? And it happened fairly quick against the bottom of the order,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “I think he threw it well.”\nHouck (8-8) was replaced after allowing three consecutive hits to start the sixth, and the Rangers added three more in a row against Brennan Bernardino in a three-run inning.
