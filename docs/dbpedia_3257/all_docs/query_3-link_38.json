        "text": "By Steve Kornacki\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Al Randall grew up playing hockey in Trenton, a small town along the Detroit River where the sport was so big that it seemed like it belonged on the other side of the river in Canada. The parks and recreation department constructed several outdoor hockey rinks in parks to complement one of the few indoor rinks in the Downriver area.\n\nRandall made the high school team but opted for travel league hockey, and he listened to Bruce Martyn broadcast Detroit Red Wings games as a young boy and teenager at a time when Martyn often would shriek into his microphone: \"Delvecchio to Howe ... He shoots! HE SCORES!\" And the hockey-crazy kid fell in love. He wanted to broadcast the game someday.\n\nHe studied math and physics at Eastern Michigan but attended the Specs Howard School of Broadcast Arts to follow his dream. Randall got reporter and disc jockey gigs \"Up North\" in Rogers City and Alpena while also working in sales. He called the games of the Alpena High Wildcats in an open-air rink that made it feel as if he were calling the Iditarod some nights.\n\nRandall in 1977 at Lakeview Arena in Marquette, Michigan.\n\nAnd he did that for 19 years. That's love of the craft and the game.\n\nThen, when Martyn retired in 1995, Randall applied to replace his idol. He knew it was a long shot but had to give it a shot, get the puck on net, so to speak. The Red Wings sent him a nice letter, informing him they were hiring Ken Kal, who had been doing University of Michigan ice hockey.\n\nRandall told his wife that it was time to give up his dream, that 19 years were enough, and she asked him who got the Red Wings' job. \"Why don't you apply for the job he had?\" she asked.\n\nHe was one of 55 who applied to WTKA-AM for that Michigan job, and the rest is history. Randall is in his 24th season and will call his 1,000th game Friday (March 8), when the Wolverines visit Minnesota for the opener of a best-of-three Big Ten Tournament series. He's the longest-tenured Big Ten announcer and among the nation's leaders in years calling the college game.\n\nAnd as if 19 years of calling outdoor hockey weren't sacrifice enough, Randall for eight years commuted twice weekly from Alpena to do the games on weekends and the Red Berenson coach's radio show on Tuesday nights. That came to nearly 1,000 miles each week during the season.\n\nRandall calling a game this season at Yost Ice Arena.\n\nNow, he lives only one hour north of Ann Arbor, runs his own auto windshield repair company, Century Glass Company, and the driving seems like a breeze. But he encountered another challenge unlike anything he'd faced last spring and summer. Randall was diagnosed with \"base-of-the-tongue\" cancer and underwent seven weeks of radiation treatment.\n\n\"That was the hardest thing I ever did in my life,\" said Randall, 65, whose last treatment was May 21. \"But the recovery was harder than the treatments by far. June and July, I hardly even remember because I was on so much medication.\"\n\nHe said he's been \"clear\" of cancer since testing began in September.\n\nWhat got him through it?\n\n\"Besides the good Lord,\" said Randall, \"my wife (Cindy).\"\n\nThey've been married since 2013 (Randall has two children from a previous marriage), and Cindy has been with him through good and bad times.\n\nRandall continued, \"Jim Karshner, who went to Alma with me before I went to Eastern Michigan, was the news reporter in Rogers City (located on Lake Huron between Alpena and Mackinaw City) when I was the news director at the radio station. We got reacquainted when I moved to Dewitt, where he lives, and he organized trips for all my buddies and wife to go back and forth to take me to (cancer) treatments in Detroit.\"\n\nBut through it all, in texts and phone conversations with friends and on Twitter (@AlRandall2), Randall insisted he would be ready in time for this season. And he was.\n\n\"I've only missed two games in 24 years,\" said Randall, \"and one of them was when my dad was rushed to Tampa General Hospital (six years ago). The other was the Merrimack game (Jan. 8). I was in the hospital because they had to regulate some medicine because of the cancer I had. I had blood clots in my lungs and needed tests.\"\n\nBill Trainor, his former and still occasional analyst partner, is amazed.\n\n\"There are not too many guys who have been at the helm broadcasting longer than Al,\" said Trainor, \"and players and games he's called with missing (just two) games, and you think of everything he's gone through with the cancer. And through it all, there's probably no bigger supporter of Michigan hockey than Al Randall. He bleeds maize and blue and is there through thick and thin.\"\n\nFulfilling and Enriching Career Reaches a Milestone\n\nRandall has no plans to retire.\n\n\"I'll do it as long as it keeps being fun,\" he said, adding that he doesn't have any special words planned for game 1,000.\n\nBut here is what's deep in his heart and soul:\n\n\"You know, I've met a multitude of people, and I think back to all the players and their parents. They come and go, but the players come back, and they remember you because you called their games. And somehow, I've shared a little bit of each one of their lives. It's very fulfilling, very enriching to know that people might be listening, hanging on your words: 'Three seconds left on the clock, can Michigan tie it?' And you just build it for the parents that can't get to the games, the fans who can't get to the games, and you become a part of their lives, too. It's a mutual thing that gives you a really calming sense of satisfaction, knowing you gave somebody some enjoyment.\"\n\nRandall's had three partners other than the one season when several rotated as the analyst. He started in 1995 with the late Jim Hunt, Trainor followed in 2009 and Andrew Merrick in 2016. Trainor and Merrick were young players on the 1998 national championship team.\n\n\"They had a two-on-one break in that championship game,\" recalled Randall, \"and Merrick, instead of passing to Bill, he shot it himself, and he shot right in the goalie's pads. They both tell me, 'If we'd have scored, (overtime goal-scorer Josh) Langfeld would've never seen the Red Wings!'\n\n\"Bill almost got his ear taken off in that game (by a high stick). He got like 27 or 30 stitches in the locker room and there was blood all over the ice. Andrew Merrick has his jersey from that game and it has Bill Trainor's blood on it.\"\n\nSo, Trainor was done for the title game?\n\n\"No,\" said Randall, \"he came back. Billy's line: 'They'll have to do more than cut off my ear not to play in the third period.' \"\n\nTrainor still occasionally fills in for Merrick.\n\n\"There's an excitement that Al brings,\" said Merrick. \"One of the first games I worked with him was the (2016 NCAA Midwest) Regionals in Cincinnati. I was filling in for Billy Trainor, and Tyler Motte scored the winning goal against Notre Dame in overtime. What a great call it was.\n\n\"As much as (current head coach) Mel Pearson, Red Berenson, and any of our fans, he wants this program to have success. And that's what comes through on the broadcast. I remember listening to him on tape when we played. I truly believe that Michigan hockey is very lucky to have him. He could be on any NHL TV broadcast; he's that good.\"\n\nTrainor added, \"Al knows how to build excitement and knows how to capture that through his voice and his play-by-play.\"\n\nFrom left: Merrick, former Wolverine Dylan Larkin (2014-15) and Randall\n\nWhat have they enjoyed most about working with Randall?\n\n\"He's a professional,\" said Merrick. \"He knows when to let me step up and say something and knows where the opportunities are to help me out. I came here as green as a cucumber three years ago. He knows when to pick up the intensity with his voice, when to get me involved. It's a professional atmosphere with Al. He's a pro, and that's about as big of a compliment as I can give him.\n\n\"But my favorite thing about Al is just the time we spend together on the road. He's fun to hang out with, and I've gotten to know him away from the rink. Just seeing his passion for Michigan hockey and how much he enjoys being here, 24 years going. He just bleeds maize and blue.\"\n\nTrainor said, \"We had great chemistry both on the radio and off radio and became very good friends. Al is a master storyteller, and I've always enjoyed listening to his old hockey and old broadcasting stories. The guy just makes me laugh.\n\n\"What I appreciated most was his patience. Everyone has their own style and timing as an analyst, and I didn't go to broadcasting school. I was terrible the first couple years, but he was a very good teacher. We figured out our rapport and timing -- got that chemistry and style. And then we got on a roll and really felt comfortable with one another.\"\n\nRandall reciprocates the love: \"They're great people beyond all the knowledge they have. Both are very down to earth and very loyal friends. Through thick and thin, they are with you, and they have great families.\"\n\nThey've also learned to roll with the punches. There was the game at Wisconsin when they lost connection and had to broadcast much of the first period by exchanging Randall's cell phone, and the game at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena when Randall began bleeding \"profusely\" while calling the action.\n\n\"It was like a faucet of blood coming out of his hand,\" said Trainor. \"I summoned emergency personnel to help get it stopped. They bandaged him up and there was a pool of blood underneath Al.\"\n\nRandall said, \"I was reaching for the commercials on laminated cards, and they were in a big, black paper clip. That's what I sliced my finger on. I was trying to hold it with tissues and brown paper and calling the game: 'Here they go. There's the shot!' \"\n\nHe didn't let the pain or discomfort stop him.\n\nWhen Randall was hired, his first assignment was interviewing Berenson before the intrasquad scrimmage. Someone at WTKA-AM gave him a tape recorder. When he began interviewing Berenson, it didn't work. He quickly discovered it was missing batteries. So, he went back and was given a cassette recorder with a one-minute tape that ran out shortly after they began talking. Berenson rolled his eyes.\n\n\"I don't know if it was a joke or they were getting me,\" said Randall. \"I don't know if it was my initiation or not. But I remember Red saying, 'Al, that should teach you a lesson. Never trust anybody. Do it yourself.' \"\n\nTrainor pointed out that Randall is one of the few broadcasters who also serves as the engineer, getting the equipment from town to town and setting it up before testing it prior to games. Berenson probably had a hand in that approach. Though, Randall now credits Merrick and Wolverine hockey publicist TJ Garske with doing the heavy lifting.\n\nCalling Two Overtime Game-Winners for NCAA Titles\n\nRandall's first call came on Oct. 14, 1995, in an 8-0 win over Guelph at Yost Ice Arena. That team went on to win Berenson's first national championship, and the Wolverines won it all again two years later. Both were 3-2 victories in overtime.\n\nBerenson is extremely loyal to those who have covered his teams, and he had an interesting command for Randall the day before the title game in Boston: \"You should be finding Ken Kal wherever he is and telling him that he's the one doing the broadcast and not you. Ken Kal's going to be down here to watch this game, and you ought to offer him to do the game for the championship. He never got this far.\"\n\nRandall hadn't received any warm fuzzies from the legendary coach as a rookie on the beat, and now he was challenging him. Randall called Kal and offered that game to him, but Kal also is a pro's pro and said, \"Al, there is no way on the face of the earth I'm doing this game. I'm the Red Wings' announcer; you're the Michigan announcer. Have a great call!' \"\n\nRandall informed Berenson that he'd spoken with Kal. Though, the coach didn't ask for any details.\n\n\"But from then on,\" said Randall, \"Red trusted me. I did what he asked me to do.\"\n\nThe first bouquet to Randall from Berenson came at the championship team's banquet at an Ann Arbor hotel.\n\n\"My call of the winning goal by Brendan Morrison is on the video,\" said Randall, \"and Red went up to the podium after the call and said, 'That was the greatest call I've ever heard. Even Ken Kal couldn't have done it better.' It made me feel so good. I was in.\"\n\nRandall called the dramatic scene at the Riverfront Coliseum in Cincinnati: \"(Steven) Halko from the point. He'll chip it. (Greg) Crozier shooting. Out in front is (Bill) Muckalt. Morrison scores! The Wolverines have won the national championship!\"\n\nTwenty-three years later, Randall had a thought: \"But what would've happened if we lost and Ken Kal hadn't done the game?\"\n\nRandall leaned back in his broadcast chair at Yost, roaring with laughter.\n\nThe Wolverines lost in the 1997 Frozen Four semifinals before winning it all again in 1998, when Langfeld scored the deciding goal.\n\nRandall called it this way from the FleetCenter in Boston: \"(Scott) Matzka chases it. Chips it over to the boards. Now, the cycle back for (Chris) Fox, moving in, doesn't shoot. Now he takes it low down to the left-hand corner. Nobody's watching Chris Fox. Fox is behind the goal. Now he hands it off. (Josh) Langfeld shot. HEEE SCOOORES!\n\n\"They've done it again! Michigan has won the national championship.\"\n\nThat was a truly great call -- succinct, very visual and highly dramatic all in 20 memorable seconds.\n\nMartyn did Red Wings games, 1964-95, and Randall's other favorite announcer, Bob Cole, is in his 50th season on \"Hockey Night in Canada.\" So, he's followed them into a career of note with serious longevity.\n\nTrainor said he can hear both Martyn and Cole in Randall's calls.\n\nRandall said it wasn't intentional, but his signature call on goals ends just like Martyn's: \"HE SCORES!\"\n\nThere's also a touch of Allen Higgins Jr., his father and an electric company salesman, in his calls. Randall's real name is Allen Higgins III, but instructors at Specs Howard suggested picking a different on-air last name to protect his privacy, and Randall was literally pulled out of a hat of nominations by friends and family.\n\nBack when he was a boy, Al would play a baseball board game with his younger brother, Brian, that was invented by their father. They made out batting orders by pulling players out of their bubblegum card collections and set up on their bedroom floor while Dad would sit on a chair between them. Dad leaned in and called the action as they rolled dice to determine what each hitter did.\n\n\"Dad would sit and watch us play and call the game,\" said Al. \"That was my dad's dream. He wanted to be a broadcaster. He would listen to (Baseball Hall of Famer) Harry Heilmann do the Tigers' games and even caddied for him once. Dad would say, 'Rocky Colavito coming to the plate, and heeere's the pitch. There's a BASE HIT, right field!'\n\n\"My dad said, 'When I'm not around, you guys do the play-by-play.' And then we started doing it.\"\n\nHis father passed away in 2016, along with his mother, Caroline, who was the office secretary at Trenton High. However, Al notes that they got to enjoy his broadcasts, and the father got to see and hear his son fulfill his dream.\n\nAl looked down from the broadcast perch at Yost while finishing that story, eyes twinkling."
