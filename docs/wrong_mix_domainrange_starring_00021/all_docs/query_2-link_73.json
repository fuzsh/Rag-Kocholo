        "text": "Michael Lerner, an actor featured in films like Elf and The Candidate — who also received an Oscar nomination for his role in Barton Fink — has died. He was 81.\n\nThe news of Michael’s death on Saturday night (April 8) was confirmed in a social media post made by his nephew and The Goldbergs actor Sam Lerner.\n\n“We lost a legend last night. It’s hard to put into words how brilliant my uncle Michael was, and how influential he was to me,” Sam wrote. “His stories always inspired me and made me fall in love with acting. He was the coolest, most confident, talented guy, and the fact that he was my blood will always make me feel special.”\n\nHe continued, “Everyone that knows him knows how insane he was— in the best way. I’m so lucky I got to spend so much time with him, and we’re all lucky we can continue to watch his work for the rest of time. RIP Michael, enjoy your unlimited Cuban cigars, comfy chairs, and endless movie marathon.”\n\nAn official cause of death has not yet been confirmed.\n\nMichael, who was born in Brooklyn in 1941, built a long list of credits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and made his film debut in Yoko Ono‘s 1968 experimental short, Smile. From supporting roles on TV shows like M*A*S*H and The Rockford Files to starring in movies like The Postman Always Rings Twice and Harlem Nights, he became an easily recognized face in the Hollywood industry.\n\nThe actor’s fame only grew when he garnered an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor for his role in the Coen brothers’ 1991 psychological drama Barton Fink, in which he played Jack Lipnick.\n\nMuch of the younger generation would recognize Michael from his 2003 cameo as James Caan‘s ruthless boss in the beloved Christmas movie, Elf — or his role in the 1992 Kenny Ortega-directed musical Newsies.\n\nMichael is survived by his brother, Ken, and his nephew, Sam."
