        "text": "American actor Bruce Willis began his career in 1980 with an uncredited role in The First Deadly Sin. After guest-starring in a 1984 episode of Miami Vice, he appeared in the first episode of the 1985 revival of The Twilight Zone. Willis achieved fame starring in the ABC comedy-drama series Moonlighting (1985–1989), for which he received three Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor – Television Series Musical or Comedy and two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series.[1][2] In 1988, he starred as John McClane in Die Hard (1988), a film that spawned four sequels that earned him international recognition as an action hero.[3]\n\nIn the following years, Willis lent his voice for the video game Apocalypse (1998),[4] the comedy film Look Who's Talking (1989), and its sequel Look Who's Talking Too (1990). In 1991, he conceived the story for Hudson Hawk, starred as Bo Weinberg in Billy Bathgate, and appeared in The Last Boy Scout alongside Damon Wayans, which earned a cult following and a nomination for the MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo.[5] Willis's additional credits include Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), Last Man Standing (1996), The Fifth Element (1997), and Armageddon (1998). In 1999, he starred as Dr. Malcolm Crowe in the critically acclaimed The Sixth Sense (1999), which earned six Academy Award nominations.[6] His guest appearance on Friends in 2000 earned his third Emmy nomination, this time for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[2] After appearing in Sin City (2005) and voicing the lead character in the animated film Over the Hedge (2006), he starred in Red and made a cameo appearance in The Expendables (both 2010).\n\nBy the 2010s, Willis began starring in straight-to-video films that received mostly negative reviews from critics and moviegoers.[3] From The New York Times, Elisabeth Vincentelli analyzed several of his films and found that they generally lacked substance, with action sequences replacing \"any attempts at coming up with decent plots\", and featured Willis for an average of 15 minutes.[7] Willis has also starred in the 2012 films Moonrise Kingdom, The Expendables 2, and Looper. In 2013, he made an appearance as the title character in G.I. Joe: Retaliation and hosted Saturday Night Live. Willis is also known for collaborating with writer and director M. Night Shyamalan in several of his films including the Eastrail 177 Trilogy consisting of Unbreakable (2000), Split (2016), and Glass (2019). In March 2022, Willis's family announced he was retiring from acting after he was diagnosed with aphasia, a diagnosis almost a year later revised to frontotemporal dementia.[8][9] By the end of his career, the films he starred in had grossed over US$5 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors in the world.[10]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nBruce Willis' film credits Year Title Role Notes Ref(s) 1980 The First Deadly Sin Man entering diner Uncredited [11] 1982 The Verdict Courtroom observer Uncredited [12] 1987 Blind Date Walter Davis [13] 1988 Sunset Tom Mix [14] Die Hard John McClane [15] 1989 In Country Emmett Smith [16] Look Who's Talking Mikey Ubriacco Voice role [17] 1990 That's Adequate Himself [18] Die Hard 2 John McClane [19] Look Who's Talking Too Mikey Ubriacco Voice role [20] The Bonfire of the Vanities Peter Fallow [21] 1991 Mortal Thoughts James \"Jimmy\" Urbanski [22] Hudson Hawk Hudson Hawk Also credited with \"story by\" [23] Billy Bathgate Bo Weinberg [24] The Last Boy Scout Joe Hallenbeck [25] 1992 The Player Himself Cameo [26] Death Becomes Her Dr. Ernest Menville [27] 1993 Loaded Weapon 1 John McClane Uncredited cameo [28] Striking Distance Thomas \"Tom\" Hardy [29] 1994 Pulp Fiction Butch Coolidge [30] North Narrator and benevolent advisors [31] Color of Night Dr. Bill Capa [32] Nobody's Fool Carl Roebuck [33] 1995 Die Hard with a Vengeance John McClane [34] Four Rooms Leo Uncredited; segment: \"The Man from Hollywood\" [35] 12 Monkeys James Cole [36] 1996 Last Man Standing John Smith [37] Beavis and Butt-Head Do America Muddy Grimes Voice role [38] 1997 The Fifth Element Korben Dallas [39] The Jackal The Jackal [40] Broadway Brawler Eddie Kapinsky Also producer; cancelled in production [41][42] 1998 Mercury Rising Art Jeffries [43] Armageddon Harry S.
