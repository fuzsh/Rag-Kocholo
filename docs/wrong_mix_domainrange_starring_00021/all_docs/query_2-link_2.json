        "text": "The Resurrection\n\nEric and Vince are determined to get 'Medellin' off the ground, but the rights to the script stand in their way. Feeling tense the day of the 'Five Towns' premiere, Drama seeks relief at a massage parlor, but can't avoid 'Daily Variety.' Turtle meets a girl in the auto-body shop who shares his love of limited-edition sneakers, but her overbearing father hampers his game.\n\nFallacy\n\nA party is out of control and after a loud crash in the bathroom, the hostess finds Cheryl (Katherine Moenning) beaten and bloody, and Joe with his head crushed. Paramedics arrive, and the story seems pretty cut and dried. Cheryl claims Joe tried to rape her and she hit him over the head with a vase in self-defense. Joe dies shortly after arriving at the hospital, and Detectives Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) question his brother, Eddie (Chad Lindberg) who is Cheryl's boyfriend. Eddie has a heart condition and had been at the party but left early to get his meds. They discover he had returned and figure he caught Cheryl and Joe together and perhaps in a jealous rage, killed his brother. But Cheryl sticks to her story.\n\nSweet Dreams\n\nWhen the members of New Directions learn that the theme of this yearâs Regionals is âDreams,â everyone has his/her own opinion as to what they should sing. Meanwhile, the day has finally come for Rachel to audition for the Broadway revival of âFunny Girlâ. Musical performances include \"Movin' On Up\", \"Next To Me\", \"Fight For Your Right (To Party)\", \"You Have More Friends Than You Know\" and \"Don't Stop Believin'\"."
