        "text": "American actor (1941–2023)\n\nNot to be confused with Michael Learned.\n\nThis article is about the actor. For other people named Michael Lerner, see Michael Lerner (disambiguation).\n\nMichael Charles Lerner (June 22, 1941 – April 8, 2023) was an American actor. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Jack Lipnick in Barton Fink (1991). Lerner also played Arnold Rothstein in Eight Men Out (1988), Phil Gillman in Amos & Andrew (1993), The Warden in No Escape (1994), Mel Horowitz on the television series Clueless, Jerry Miller in The Beautician and the Beast (1997), Mayor Ebert in Roland Emmerich's Godzilla (1998), Mr. Greenway in Elf (2003), and Senator Brickman in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMichael Charles Lerner was born on June 22, 1941,[1] in Brooklyn, New York City, of Romanian-Jewish descent, the second of three sons to Blanche and George Lerner; according to Lerner, his father \"liked to think he was an antiques dealer, but in all actuality he was a junk dealer.\"[2][3] He was raised in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and in Solon, Ohio. His younger brother Ken, nephew Sam, and niece Jenny are also actors.[3][4] His older brother, Arnold, died in 2004.[1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLerner made his first television appearance at the age of 13, as a \"quiz kid\" on a television program hosted by a local sportscaster. He played Willy Loman in a production of Death of a Salesman at Brooklyn College, where Joel Zwick was a classmate. The experience convinced him that he wanted to be an actor, rather than an English professor. He also appeared as Sir Toby Belch in a production of Twelfth Night directed by David Mamet in Greenwich Village; William H. Macy was also in that production.[5] After graduating from Brooklyn College, where he studied acting, he received a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a master's degree in English drama.[1] Although his then-wife still thought he should become an English professor, Lerner still wanted to be an actor;[5] he received a Fulbright Scholarship to study theater in London for two years, at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. While there, he lived in a flat with Yoko Ono and John Lennon. In 1968, he appeared in Ono's short experimental film Smile, among other projects.[citation needed] \"She made a movie comprised of bare asses walking on a treadmill\", he once said. \"I’m in it and so is Paul McCartney. Plus I’m doing narration about censorship and all that crap.\"[3]\n\nIn 1968, Lerner returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and joined the American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.).[3] At the age of 24 he appeared as \"Hieronymous the Miser\" in a KPFA radio production of Michel de Ghelderode's Breugelesque play, Red Magic.[citation needed]\n\nLerner moved to Los Angeles in 1969, where he appeared in a production of Little Murders, a play by Jules Feiffer that was later adapted into a film by Alan Arkin. He also began making guest appearances in television shows such as The Brady Bunch, The Odd Couple, M*A*S*H, Banacek and The Rockford Files. In 1974, he appeared in the teleplay The Missiles of October, playing Pierre Salinger.[3]\n\nIn 1970, Lerner made his film debut in Alex in Wonderland; director Paul Mazursky had seen his production of Little Murders and enjoyed his performance.[3] He then went on to appear in supporting roles in various Hollywood movies such as The Candidate, St. Ives and the 1981 remake of The Postman Always Rings Twice. In 1991, after co-starring in Harlem Nights, Lerner played film producer Jack Lipnick in Barton Fink, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. He based the character in part on legendary film mogul Louis B. Mayer; according to his brother Ken, he was working on a screenplay about Mayer when he died.[1][3]\n\nFrom 1996 to 1997, Lerner played Mel Horowitz on the television series Clueless. In 1997, he would play Joy Miller's father Jerry in The Beautician and the Beast. Lerner's later projects include the Christmas comedy Elf (2003) and Poster Boy (2004), as well as television programs such as Law and Order: Special Victims Unit and Entourage.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2010, he appeared in the West End production of Up for Grabs with Madonna. He also appeared on BBC Radio Four in 2008 as a member of the cast of David Quantick's Radio Four's series One. He portrayed Senator Brickman in the Marvel Comics/Twentieth Century Fox film, X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). In 2013, Lerner appeared in a Season 4 episode of Glee as Sidney Greene, an investor in the revival of Broadway musical Funny Girl. His character is on the panel of judges, watching the Rachel Berry character audition for the lead role. He reprised his role as Sidney in Season 5 in several New York-based episodes of the series, as Funny Girl opens on Broadway.[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to his acting career, Lerner was a collector of rare books, an aficionado of Cuban cigars, and—by his own account—a very good poker player.[3][5] He was missing the tip of one index finger, due to an injury suffered while cutting a tongue sandwich while working at a deli in New York City.[1]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nLerner died of complications from brain seizures at a hospital in Burbank, California, on April 8, 2023, at the age of 81.[1][3]\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1968 Smile Short experimental film directed by Yoko Ono 1970 Alex in Wonderland Leo 1971 The Ski Bum Rod 1972 The Candidate Paul Corliss 1974 Busting Marvin Royce Newman's Law Frank Acker Hangup Fred Richards 1976 St. Ives Myron Green 1977 The Other Side of Midnight Barbet Outlaw Blues Hatch 1979 Goldengirl Sternberg 1980 The Baltimore Bullet Paulie Coast to Coast Dr. Frederick Froll Borderline Henry Lydell 1981 The Postman Always Rings Twice Mr. Katz Threshold Henry de Vici 1982 National Lampoon's Class Reunion Dr. Robert Young 1983 Strange Invaders Willie Collings 1985 Movers & Shakers Arnie 1987 Anguish John Pressman 1988 Vibes Burt Wilder Eight Men Out Arnold Rothstein 1989 Harlem Nights Bugsy Calhoune 1990 Maniac Cop 2 Deputy Commissioner Edward Doyle Any Man's Death Herb Denner 1991 Omen IV: The Awakening Earl Knight 1991 Barton Fink Jack Lipnick Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nNominated—Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nNominated—Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor[citation needed] 1992 Newsies Weasel The Comrades of Summer George 1993 Amos & Andrew Phil Gillman 1994 Blank Check Biderman Radioland Murders Lieutenant Cross The Road to Wellville Goodloe Bender No Escape The Warden 1995 No Way Back Frank Serlano A Pyromaniac's Love Story Perry Girl in the Cadillac Pal 1997 The Beautician and the Beast Jerry Miller For Richer or Poorer Phillip Kleinman 1998 Godzilla Mayor Ebert Safe Men Big Fat Bernie Gayle Celebrity Dr. Lupus Tale of the Mummy Professor Marcus Desperation Boulevard Manny Green 1999 The Mod Squad Howard My Favorite Martian Mr. Channing 2001 Mockingbird Don't Sing Dr. Stan York 2002 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure Producer Voice 2003 Elf Mr. Greenway 2004 The Calcium Kid Artie Cohen Larceny Pete Poster Boy Jack Kray 2005 When Do We Eat?
