        "text": "American actress (born 1939)\n\nNot to be confused with Michael Lerner (actor).\n\nMichael Learned (born April 9, 1939) is an American actress, known for her role as Olivia Walton in the long-running CBS drama series The Waltons (1972–1981). She has won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series four times, which is tied for the record of most wins with Tyne Daly. Three of the wins were for The Waltons (1973, 1974, 1976), while the other was for Nurse (1982).[1]\n\nLearned was born in Washington, D.C., the eldest daughter of Elizabeth Duane \"Betti\" (née Hooper) and Bruce Learned, a diplomat.[2] Her maternal grandfather was an attaché for the United States Embassy in Rome.[3] She has five younger sisters: Gretl, Susan, Sabra, Dorit and Philippa.[4]\n\nShe lived on a Connecticut farm for the first 10 years of her life. Learned said that her parents never explained why she received a masculine first name, once saying of her father: \"All he told me was that if I had been a boy, I would have been named Caleb, but I was a girl, so I was called Michael.\"[5]\n\nWhen she was 11, Learned moved to Austria, where her father worked for the U.S. State Department. At this time, she attended Arts Educational School, Tring, now Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Tring, Hertfordshire, England. During this time, she discovered the theater and decided to make acting her life's work.[6]\n\nHer first substantial role in either film or television was as Olivia Walton on The Waltons, which ran for nine seasons from 1972 to 1981. For the first five seasons of the show she was billed as \"Miss Michael Learned\" because she was relatively unknown at the time and producers wished to avoid confusion among viewers about her gender. By the sixth season, as the show continued its success after the departure of co-star Richard Thomas, these fears of confusion about her sex had been alleviated and the \"Miss\" was dropped from Learned's billing. She was nominated for six Emmy Awards as Lead Actress in a Drama, winning three times. After the end of the sixth season, she agreed to appear for one more season on the condition that she would not have to work the full nine months. After the seventh season she left the show.[7]\n\nHer character's abrupt disappearance in Season 7 was explained by Olivia developing tuberculosis and entering a sanatorium in Arizona. She returned in Season 8 and later appeared in four of the six Waltons reunion movies made during the 1980s and 1990s. For her portrayal of Olivia Walton, Learned was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards. During her run as Olivia Walton, Learned and The Waltons co-star, Will Geer, appeared together in the 1974 made-for-TV movie Hurricane.\n\nLearned made her big screen debut in 1980, playing the supporting role in the drama film Touched by Love. She later appeared in Power (1986) and Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story (1993), and well as number of made-for-television movies.\n\nLearned starred as Nurse Mary Benjamin in the hospital drama Nurse, which ran on CBS for six episodes in spring 1981 and then for the 1981–1982 seasons. Though the series was well received critically, it was not a ratings success and lasted only two partial seasons. Nevertheless, Learned was nominated for two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress and won yet another Emmy for this role in 1982. She later had starring roles in the unsuccessful 1988 drama Hothouse and 1989 sitcom Living Dolls and reprised her Waltons role for a number of television movies and reunions in the 1990s.\n\nIn 2005, Learned played Judge Helen Turner on the ABC soap operas All My Children and One Life to Live as part of the \"baby switch\" storyline on both shows. In the second season of The Secret World of Alex Mack, she guest-starred as a ghost who regretted the decisions of her long-estranged granddaughter, revealed at the end to be the show's main villain, Danielle Atron (Louan Gideon). She guest-starred in Scrubs as Mrs. Wilk in five episodes from the show's fifth season. She played Shirley Smith on ABC's General Hospital in 2010. In late 2011, Learned played Katherine Chancellor on the CBS daytime soap opera, The Young and the Restless, filling in for Jeanne Cooper, who was on extended medical leave from the series.[8]\n\nIn 2022, Learned made her return to television with starring role in the Netflix limited series, Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story playing Catherine Dahmer, Jeffrey Dahmer's grandmother.[9][10]\n\nIn the late 1960s, Learned and her husband Peter Donat appeared in various roles with the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. She has appeared in many stage productions on Broadway, off Broadway, and elsewhere, including the 2006–2007 national touring production of On Golden Pond. In the fall of 2008, she starred in Innovation Theatre Works' production of Driving Miss Daisy, playing the title role of Daisy Werthen opposite Willis Burks II as Hoke and Dirk Blocker as Daisy's son Boolie. She reprised the role opposite Lance E. Nichols as Hoke at Judson Theatre Company in March 2013.[11]\n\nLearned has been married four times. Her first husband was Canadian-American actor Peter Donat, whom she married in 1956 when she was 17 years old. The marriage was dissolved in 1972. She had three sons by the marriage, one of whom is actor and business executive Lucas Donat.[12]\n\nHer second marriage, to Glen Chadwick, lasted from 1974 to 1977 and ended in divorce. In 1979, she married actor-screenwriter William Parker.[12] That marriage ended in divorce as well. Since 1991, she has been married to lawyer John Doherty; the couple resides in California.[13][14]\n\nIn a 2002 article she wrote for Daily Word, a publication of the Unity Church, Learned states that at the time she was cast in The Waltons, she had \"hit rock bottom\". Then, at age 32, Learned realized she was an alcoholic. Taking herself to former husband Peter Donat's cabin on the California coast, she decided to \"get sober\" and that her time there was the beginning of a spiritual journey. Learned further stated in the article that she has been sober since 1977.[15]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1980 Touched by Love Dr. Bell 1986 Power Governor Andrea Stannard 1993 Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story Vivian Emery 1997 Life During Wartime — 2000 For the Love of May Mary Lou Short film 2005 Lethal Eviction Elsa Loggerheads Sheridan Bellamy 2007 The Killer The Innkeeper Short film 2009 An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong Nana Louis Hanlon 2014 Unplugged Grandma Katie Short film The Parcel Beverly After Life Gloria 2018 Second Acts Lee Marston Short film\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1963 The Other Man — 1974 Hurricane Lee Jackson It Couldn't Happen to a Nicer Guy Janet Walters 1978 Little Mo Eleanor Tennant 1980 Nurse Mary Benjamin A Christmas Without Snow Zoe Jenson 1982 Mother's Day on Waltons Mountain Olivia Walton 1984 The Parade Rachel Kirby 1986 A Deadly Business Ann Picnic Rosemary Sidney 1986 All My Sons Kate Keller American Playhouse 1987 Mercy or Murder?
