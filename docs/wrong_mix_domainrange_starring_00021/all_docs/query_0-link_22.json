        "text": "Every Best Actor Oscar Winner\n\nThe first Academy Awards ceremony in 1929 had 13 categories. Now there are 24, and while the categories have changed over time, the honors for best actor and actress have remained steady for 90 years. Some of the actors’ wins were groundbreaking, while others are mystifying. But all are interesting. Here are all the best actor winners since the beginning.\n\nWill Smith\n\n“King Richard”\n\nFew best actor winners had an evening as memorable as Will Smith’s. Less than an hour before winning for “King Richard” (his third acting nomination), he set off one of Oscars’ all-time jaw-dropping moments. When presenter Chris Rock joked about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, the actor strode onstage and smacked the comic, then returned to his seat and twice shouted, “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth!” When Smith’s name was announced as the winner, he got a standing ovation and, in a tearful speech, said he was “overwhelmed by what God is calling me to do and be in this world.” Social media exploded over the event, while generally ignoring other aspects of the overlong and awkward Oscar show. After five days of Academy meetings, rumors, speculation, theories and gossip, Smith resigned from the Academy — a first for a brand-new winner.\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\n“The Father”\n\nWhen Sony Pictures Classics’ “The Father” debuted at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival, critics predicted Anthony Hopkins would win the Oscar. During the next 15 months, the competition became more intense and he seemed a probable also-ran to the late Chadwick Boseman. But Hopkins’ depiction of dementia proved unforgettable, giving him a second best actor win after 1991’s “The Silence of the Lambs,” and making him the oldest acting winner at age 83. The film marked Florian Zeller’s directing debut, an adaptation of his own play.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix (2019)\n\n“Joker”\n\n“Joker,” directed by Todd Phillips, is an origin story about how the Batman villain came to be. The film could only be described as a comic-book movie in the broadest sense, as director and co-writer Phillips made it a tale of people who suffer from mental illness and feel alienated. Though expectations were low before it caused a sensation at the Venice Film Festival, it earned more than $1 billion at the box office and universal praise for star Joaquin Phoenix, who made Joker/Arthur Fleck into a character who was sympathetic, yet scary.\n\nGary Oldman (2017)\n\n“Darkest Hour”\n\nAnother British WWII drama? Another depiction of Winston Churchill? Over the years, there have been a flood of both, but “Darkest Hour” seemed smart and fresh, thanks in large part to Gary Oldman. The actor has elevated many movies over the decades, but this was only his second Oscar nomination. And ever since the film first screened at the Telluride and Toronto festivals in September 2017, Oldman was correctly predicted to be the Oscar front-runner.\n\nCasey Affleck (2016)\n\n“Manchester by the Sea”\n\nCasey Affleck played an inarticulate man haunted by his past in “Manchester by the Sea.” The wins for Affleck and for screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan were Hollywood validations of Amazon, which had expanded from selling online books to becoming a giant powerhouse in entertainment and other industries. Affleck bowed out of presenting best actress of 2017 (a longtime Oscar tradition) due to renewed attention around a 2010 legal settlement.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (2015)\n\n“The Revenant”\n\nFrontiersman Hugh Glass survives a brutal bear attack, is left for dead, then exacts revenge on those who abandoned him. The big prize every year is best picture, but the no. 1 question for 2015 Oscar mavens was: Is this finally Leo’s year? It was. He became the ninth person in 12 years to win best actor for playing a real person and the fifth best actor winner for a western, after Warner Baxter, Gary Cooper, Lee Marvin and John Wayne. (Robert Duvall and Jeff Bridges get honorable mention here.)\n\nEddie Redmayne (2014)\n\n“The Theory of Everything”\n\nIt was considered a neck-and-neck race between Michael Keaton (“Birdman”) and Eddie Redmayne, though there were three other great performances nominated that year (including Benedict Cumberbatch for “The Imitation Game”). But Redmayne won for his portrayal of Stephen Hawking, in the biopic that spans 25 years in Hawking’s unorthodox but touching relationship with his wife (Felicity Jones).\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis (2012)\n\n“Lincoln”\n\nMany actors have been nominated for playing kings, but not so many as U.S. Presidents, and Day-Lewis was the first to win. He also became the first person to win three best actor Oscars. Only 23 individuals so far have won two leading actor/actress trophies; that includes Day-Lewis and Katharine Hepburn, who lead the pack with three and four, respectively, while Jack Nicholson, Ingrid Bergman and Meryl Streep have each won two leads and one supporting.\n\nJean Dujardin (2011)\n\n“The Artist”\n\nHollywood (and the rest of the world) was charmed by the offbeat daring of “The Artist,” a black-and-white silent film about an actor in the early days of moviemaking, written and directed by the little-known French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius. Star Jean Dujardin won over audiences with his funny-sad portrayal of the struggling former star.\n\nColin Firth (2010)\n\n“The King’s Speech”\n\nColin Firth had a breakthrough role in the play “Another Country” and its 1984 film adaptation. He became a sexy leading man with TV’s “Pride and Prejudice” and worked for two decades, including roles in best picture winners “The English Patient” and “Shakespeare in Love.” He entered a new realm in the 2009 Tom Ford film “A Single Man,” followed by his knockout work in “The King’s Speech” as England’s King George VI. The film was directed by Tom Hooper, who steered actors to seven Oscar nominations and three wins in only five films.\n\nForest Whitaker (2006)\n\n“The Last King of Scotland”\n\nThis was an often-fictionalized account of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin in the 1970s, and his relationship with his physician (James McAvoy). Forest Whitaker had played dozens of roles in TV and film, but this established him as an actor of great range, in his best role since the Clint Eastwood-directed “Bird,” about jazz musician Charlie Parker.\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman (2005)\n\n“Capote”\n\nThis was one of two films about Truman Capote writing his true-crime book “In Cold Blood” in Kansas. (Toby Jones starred in the other film, “Infamous”). Capote, who also wrote “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” was well known from TV talk show appearances; while Hoffman didn’t resemble him, Oscar voters were wowed by his multi-layered performance.\n\nJamie Foxx (2004)\n\n“Ray”\n\nIt’s not easy to play a personality as well-known as Ray Charles, but Jamie Foxx won every award possible that year for his work as the influential musician. Foxx got his big break on the sketch-comedy TV series “In Living Color” and proved his versatility in 2004, also earning a supporting actor Oscar nomination for “Collateral” with Tom Cruise.\n\nSean Penn (2003)\n\n“Mystic River”\n\nSean Penn won as a man grieving the murder of his daughter in the Clint Eastwood-directed film, from a Dennis Lehane novel. The film was nominated for six Oscars and Tim Robbins also won for his supporting turn as a childhood friend of Penn’s character, who becomes a suspect.\n\nAdrien Brody (2002)\n\n“The Pianist”\n\nAt 29 (22 days before his 30th birthday), Adrien Brody became the youngest best actor winner ever. Pundits declared that the best actor prize that year was a contest between Jack Nicholson (“About Schmidt”) and Daniel Day-Lewis (“Gangs of New York”), but Brody and director Roman Polanski pulled off major upsets by winning for the widely admired “The Pianist.”\n\nDenzel Washington (2001)\n\n“Training Day”\n\nDenzel Washington became the 11th actor to win in both the lead and supporting categories. The actor had won a supporting Oscar for the 1989 “Glory.” “Training Day” was a change of pace for the charismatic actor: A villainous role as a corrupt cop. This was the fifth of his eight acting noms (with another as a producer of the 2016 “Fences”).\n\nKevin Spacey (1999)\n\n“American Beauty”\n\nLong before his 2017 scandal and banishment from Hollywood, Kevin Spacey won two Oscars. The first was supporting actor for “The Usual Suspects,” and the second was for his work in the best picture winner “American Beauty,” a dark satire of suburbia. The 1999 contest seemed to be a tight race for best actor between Denzel Washington of “The Hurricane” and Spacey, but the latter won, possibly because of mudslinging that questioned the accuracy of biopic “Hurricane.”\n\nJack Nicholson (1997)\n\n“As Good as it Gets”\n\nJack Nicholson earned his third Oscar, and his second under the direction of James L. Brooks (after a supporting win for “Terms of Endearment”) as an obsessive-compulsive man who falls in love with a waitress (Helen Hunt, who also won an Oscar that year). Nicholson has won three Academy Awards — and in each case, his female costar also won.\n\nNicolas Cage (1995)\n\n“Leaving Las Vegas”\n\nPart of the Coppola family, Nicolas Cage won an Oscar as a down-on-his luck alcoholic. Mike Figgis wrote (from a story by John O’Brien) and directed the tale. The film earned four key nominations: two for Figgis, plus Cage and best actress contender Elisabeth Shue. Like the 1971 “Sunday, Bloody Sunday,” it earned all of those key noms, but surprisingly no best picture bid.\n\nTom Hanks (1993)\n\n“Philadelphia”\n\nThough TV movies had addressed AIDS many years earlier, this was the first bigscreen movie from a major studio to tackle the issue. Tom Hanks was considered brave for playing the role of a gay man who hires an attorney (Denzel Washington) after he is terminated from his white-collar job.\n\nAl Pacino (1992)\n\n“The Scent of a Woman”\n\nAl Pacino was a double nominee that year, also as supporting actor for “Glengarry Glen Ross.” These were his seventh and eighth nominations, but his first win. After “The Godfather” movies and “Dog Day Afternoon,” among many others, “The Scent of a Woman” was not his most admired performance, but the general feeling was that he was overdue.\n\nAnthony Hopkins (1991)\n\n“The Silence of the Lambs”\n\nSome people think the supporting actor category should be defined by a character’s time onscreen, but Anthony Hopkins disproves that theory. Though he is onscreen for less than 20 minutes, Hannibal Lecter is the movie’s most vivid character and remains indelible decades later. This was the third film to win the top five awards of picture, director (Jonathan Demme), actress (Jodie Foster), actor, and screenplay (Ted Tally), following “It Happened One Night” and “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”\n\nWilliam Hurt (1985)\n\n“The Kiss of the Spider Woman”\n\nIn the five years before his Oscar win, William Hurt appeared in a series of high-profile films such as “Altered States” (1980), “Body Heat” (1981), and “The Big Chill.” In “The Kiss of the Spider Woman,” he plays an effeminate gay man sharing a cell with a political prisoner.\n\nF. Murray Abraham (1984)\n\n“Amadeus”\n\nF. Murray Abraham was known and respected in the industry, but mostly for stage work. One of the many examples of an unpredictable actor’s life: Not long before winning the Oscar, Abraham supported himself by appearing in commercials for such products such as Listerine and Fruit of the Loom.\n\nRobert Duvall (1983)\n\n“Tender Mercies”\n\nRobert Duvall had made his film debut as Boo Radley in “To Kill a Mockingbird” (1962) and starred in films for Francis Coppola, George Lucas, Sidney Lumet, Sam Peckinpah, Robert Altman, and Arthur Penn, among others. He won as a country singer in the film written by Horton Foote (who had also scripted “Mockingbird”) and directed by Bruce Beresford.\n\nBen Kingsley (1982)\n\n“Gandhi”\n\nThe actor, born in England of Indian descent, had done 15 years in TV and many years with the Royal Shakespeare Company before becoming a movie star in Richard Attenborough’s epic biopic about Mahatma Gandhi. The other nominees were strong that year, with Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman, Jack Lemmon, and Peter O’Toole, but Ben Kingsley took top honors for his memorable performance.\n\nHenry Fonda (1981)\n\n“On Golden Pond”\n\nHenry Fonda became the oldest best actor winner at 76 years, 317 days. He won a year after being given an honorary Oscar, in recognition of his great work over the decades. He and Katharine Hepburn both won as a retired couple in a film produced by (and co-starring) his daughter Jane Fonda.\n\nRobert De Niro (1980)\n\n“Raging Bull”\n\nRobert De Niro had won as supporting actor for “The Godfather Part II.” His work in the 1980 “Raging Bull” seemed like a gimmick — mid-production, filming was delayed so he could gain weight to depict boxer Jake LaMotta in his later years — but De Niro and director Martin Scorsese pulled it off.\n\nDustin Hoffman (1979)\n\n“Kramer vs. Kramer”\n\nThis was Dustin Hoffman’s fourth Oscar nom, and his first win. Backstage after his Golden Globes victory a few weeks before the Academy Awards, Hoffman told the press, “I think that awards are very silly. I think they pit very talented and good people against each other and they hurt the hell out of the ones that lose.”\n\nJon Voight (1978)\n\n“Coming Home”\n\nThough Hollywood made many war films during WWII, it ignored the Vietnam war until after it ended. The Hal Ashby-directed “Coming Home” earned Oscars for Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, a post-Vietnam version of “The Best Years of Our Lives,” showing the difficulty of veterans readjusting. Voight played a paraplegic veteran who falls in love with a married woman.\n\nJack Nicholson (1975)\n\n“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”\n\nJack Nicholson built a career under legendary indie-genre maestro Roger Corman in the 1950s, and had a breakthrough role in “Easy Rider” (1969). After a string of hits and Oscar nominations (“Seven Easy Pieces,” “The Last Detail,” “Chinatown”), Nicholson won Oscar gold for this adaptation of the Ken Kesey novel and Dale Wasserman play. It was the first of Nicholson’s three Oscar wins. And the film became the second of three films to win the top five awards.\n\nArt Carney (1974)\n\n“Harry and Tonto”\n\nArt Carney, a veteran of showbiz more than 50 years, was best known as the comic sewer worker Ed Norton in the TV series “The Honeymooners.” But he won for his serio-comic turn as a retired schoolteacher, beating tough competition, including Jack Nicholson for “Chinatown” and Al Pacino for “The Godfather, Part II.”\n\nMarlon Brando (1972)\n\n“The Godfather”\n\nThe Francis Coppola-directed movie, adapted from Mario Puzo’s best-selling novel, became a mega-hit. Marlon Brando, only 48 when the film opened, created a classic performance as the Mafia chief. Brando also created a classic non-acceptance speech; he refused to attend the Oscars and sent Sacheen Littlefeather instead, where she read Brando’s refusal, due to Hollywood’s shoddy treatment of Native Americans.\n\nGeorge C. Scott (1970)\n\n“Patton”\n\nGeorge C. Scott’s towering performance as Gen. George Patton made him the clear front-runner, but he had criticized the entire Oscar process in his two previous nominations. And before Academy Awards day, he told “60 Minutes,” that the ceremony was a “meat parade … I resent being put on a show like a buffoon” and vowed that if he won the Oscar, he would return it. Could Academy voters overlook this? The answer was clearly yes.\n\nJohn Wayne (1969)\n\n“True Grit”\n\nJohn Wayne had been a movie star for nearly 40 years, the symbol of American soldiers during WWII (even though he never served in the military), and a symbol of U.S. conservative values during the Hollywood blacklist and Vietnam War. He won as the ultimate cowboy, Rooster Cogburn, who is both a spoof of, and a salute to, his earlier Western roles.\n\nCliff Robertson (1968)\n\n“Charly”\n\nCliff Robertson had starred in a 1961 TV adaptation of “Flowers for Algernon” by Daniel Keyes and the actor fought to get a big-screen version made, which resulted in his sole Oscar nomination. The work centers on a developmentally disabled man who partakes in a science experiment that triples his IQ.\n\nRod Steiger (1967)\n\n“In the Heat of the Night”\n\nIt was a strong year for actors (Dustin Hoffman in “The Graduate,” Warren Beatty in “Bonnie & Clyde”), but Rod Steiger was a popular winner on his third nomination. He plays racist Southern sheriff who has to work with a black detective (Sidney Poitier) from the North to solve a murder.\n\nPaul Scofield (1966)\n\n“A Man for All Seasons”\n\nPaul Scofield had a distinguished stage career, and performed less often in films, but won by playing Sir Thomas More, re-creating his stage performance in Robert Bolt’s adaptation of his play. The film was directed by c (“From Here to Eternity,” “Julia”).\n\nRex Harrison (1964)\n\n“My Fair Lady”\n\nRex Harrison re-created his stage role as Professor Henry Higgins in this Lerner & Loewe musical, based on Shaw’s “Pygmalion.” There was tough competition that year, including Anthony Quinn in “Zorba the Greek” and Peter Sellers in “Dr. Strangelove,” two memorable performances. Harrison was yet another actor to win under director George Cukor, who was responsible for 21 acting nominations and five wins for Oscar.\n\nSidney Poitier (1963)\n\n“Lilies of the Field”\n\nActors want to believe they can change the world, but Sidney Poitier actually did. By carefully choosing his roles, he created a positive image of a black man for audiences around the world who didn’t personally know any blacks. Poitier became one of the biggest box office draws of the 1960s in films like this, where he displayed common sense, charm, and integrity, often against difficult odds, as he helps nuns build a church.\n\nBurt Lancaster (1960)\n\n“Elmer Gantry”\n\nThe former circus acrobat turned into a charismatic star (“The Crimson Pirate”) who proved to have serious acting chops as well. He won on the second of his four nominations, as the preacher-evangelist in writer-director Richard Brooks’ adaptation of the Sinclair Lewis novel about an evangelist. Lancaster was also the producer, usually uncredited, of many classy and serious films, like “Sweet Smell of Success.”\n\nCharlton Heston (1959)\n\n“Ben-Hur”\n\nThis was a big-screen remake of a silent film (1925) based on the successful novel written by Lew Wallace. The movie had a huge budget ($15 million) and was directed by William Wyler, whose films earned a record 14 Oscar wins for their actors. Heston was the star of many classic films, but this was his only Oscar nomination.\n\nDavid Niven (1958)\n\n“Separate Tables”\n\nDavid Niven was onscreen less than 25 minutes (including appearing wordlessly in some group scenes). The film is an ensemble, but he was considered a lead. After Ernest Borgnine, this was the second time in four years that an actor won the top prize under director Delbert Mann.\n\nAlec Guinness (1957)\n\n“The Bridge on the River Kwai”\n\nTo some, he is best known as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Alec Guinness has an amazing roster of film, TV, and stage work in his 50-year-plus career. This was the third of his six collaborations with the great filmmaker David Lean. Guinness made his film debut in Lean’s 1946 “Great Expectations” and among the actor’s many achievements are the 1979 miniseries “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” as George Smiley.\n\nYul Brynner (1956)\n\n“The King & I”\n\nYul Brynner had a great year in 1956, also starring in two other big hits, “The Ten Commandments” and “Anastasia.” Brynner had won a Tony as supporting actor in the Broadway production of the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical, but he was moved up to the lead category for the film.\n\nJose Ferrer (1950)\n\n“Cyrano de Bergerac”\n\nJose Ferrer, born in Puerto Rico, became the first Latino/Hispanic acting winner. He won in his flashy role as the big-nosed poet-swordsman in the film adaptation of Edmond Rostand’s play. Ferrer had also won a Tony Award for his performance. (He had tied with Fredric March of “Years Ago” to take home the first Tony for best actor, in the 1946/47 season).\n\nLaurence Olivier (1948)\n\n“Hamlet”\n\nLaurence Olivier, one of the world’s great actors, won in one of the greatest roles of all time. He became the first of only two actors to direct himself to a best-actor win. The film won three other Oscars, including best picture.\n\nFredric March (1946)\n\n“The Best Years of Our Lives”\n\nFredric March was the second actor (after Spencer Tracy) to become a repeat winner in the best-actor category. March’s win was one of eight Oscars awarded to the William Wyler-directed film about WWII vets trying to adjust to life after the war.\n\nRay Milland (1945)\n\n“The Lost Weekend”\n\nHollywood had been portraying alcoholics for laughs or for pathos, but never really explored how heavy drinking affects daily life. This is a Hollywood “serious issue” film but it holds up well, thanks to director Billy Wilder and to the performance of Ray Milland, who’d been in a lot of films but never had never had a role so gritty and demanding.\n\nBing Crosby (1944)\n\n“Going My Way”\n\nBing Crosby was the king of crooners in the 1930s, and appeared in various musicals and several “Road” movies with Bob Hope. But he found the perfect musical-dramatic role for his velvet-voiced charm as the unconventional Father Chuck O’Malley, assigned to a poor parish where he butts heads with his superior (Barry Fitzgerald).\n\nJames Cagney (1942)\n\n“Yankee Doodle Dandy”\n\nAfter a decade of success in gangster roles (e.g., the 1931 “The Public Enemy”) James Cagney reminded Hollywood of his unique song-and-dance style in this bio of vaudeville-stage actor-writer George M. Cohan. (Variety is featured prominently in the backstage musical; in one scene, Cohan explains the classic 1935 headline “Sticks Nix Hick Pix” to some students.) Cagney was the fourth actor in seven years to win for playing a real person.\n\nGary Cooper (1941)\n\n“Sergeant York”\n\nWith his good looks and down-to-earth quality, Gary Cooper was a beloved Hollywood star. He again proved that he was also a good actor as Alvin York, a real-life WWI pacifist who becomes a war hero. It’s one of many Hollywood films of the era designed to persuade Americans of the importance of joining the war.\n\nRobert Donat (1939)\n\n“Goodbye, Mr. Chips”\n\nThe Canadian actor Robert Donat was the surprise winner, with pundits predicting James Stewart for “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” or maybe Clark Gable as part of a “Gone With the Wind” sweep. But Donat’s award was well-deserved for his work as a shy professor at an English boys school who slowly falls in love and learns his value as a teacher.\n\nSpencer Tracy (1938)\n\n“Boys Town”\n\nSpencer Tracy became the second of five back-to-back acting Oscar winners. Luise Rainer was first (1936-37); she and Tracy were followed by Katharine Hepburn, Jason Robards, then Tom Hanks. In “Boys Town” (made in an era when members of the clergy were depicted positively in Hollywood films), Tracy played the real-life Father Flanagan, a priest who created a refuge near Omaha for boys who were homeless or abused.\n\nPaul Muni (1936)\n\n“The Story of Louis Pasteur”\n\nPaul Muni was the Meryl Streep of his generation, displaying a great range of looks and voices in his film career. He was born in Europe (in an area that’s now the Ukraine), and became a member of Yiddish Art Theatre in New York. His work as the 19th century French scientist resulted in the fourth of his six Oscar noms.\n\nCharles Laughton (1932/33)\n\n“The Private Life of Henry VIII”\n\nCharles Laughton marked the first win for a non-Hollywood production. The actor is best remembered for this role, the 1935 “Mutiny on the Bounty,” the 1939 “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” and the Agatha Christie drama “Witness for the Prosecution” (1957). Billy Wilder, who directed “Witness,” hailed Laughton as one of the all-time great actors.\n\nFredric March (1931/32)\n\n“Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde”\n\n(Tie, with one more vote than Wallace Beery, which the Academy decided was close enough to honor both of them)\n\nThe Robert Lewis Stevenson tale had been filmed several times before. This was the first of two best-actor wins for March, a stage actor who later was cited by Marlon Brando and William Holden as an inspiration.\n\nLionel Barrymore (1930/31)\n\n“A Free Soul”\n\nLionel Barrymore was the older brother of Ethel and John, part of the esteemed family that reigned over Broadway and Hollywood in the early 20th century. He won for his role as an alcoholic lawyer whose life is complicated when his daughter falls in love with his client.\n\nEmil Jannings (1927/28)\n\n“The Last Command” and “The Way of All Flesh”\n\nEmil Jannings was the first winner in this category, when actors could be nominated for multiple performances. Winners were announced in advance, and he requested his award before his departure for Germany, which makes him the first person ever to be handed an Oscar. Jannings won for “Last Command,” as a former Russian general who finds himself in Hollywood. In “Flesh,” he was an upstanding businessman whose life declines. But he is best remembered as the professor who is obsessed with cabaret singer Lola (Marlene Dietrich) in “The Blue Angel.”"
