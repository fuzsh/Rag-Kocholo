        "text": "The 1990s is when all the pieces came together for Austin film. After spending most of the '80s building a local film community through Austin Film Society screenings, Richard Linklater made the film \"Slacker.\" Not only did \"Slacker\" light a fire within Austin but its release is often noted as the starting point, along with \"Do the Right Thing\" and \"Sex, Lies and Videotape,\" for the American independent film movement of the 1990s. Throughout the decade, Linklater would make a series of highly personal films with bigger budgets including \"Dazed and Confused,\" \"SubUrbia\" and \"The Newton Boys.\"\n\nThe build up of production in Austin from the '80s really hit in the '90s. Hollywood was comfortable shooting productions in Austin; they knew they could rely on the local talent, and that the regional crew base could make it happen regardless of material or budget. You know this is true when the hardest working man in the business, Clint Eastwood, comes to town… and he did for two films: \"A Perfect World\" (as director/star) and \"The Stars Fell on Henrietta\" (as producer). Disney also took note, producing two of their biggest live action family films of the era in Austin: \"Blank Check\" and \"The Big Green.\" Hollywood also discovered some of the brightest new talent in Austin like Matthew McConaughey and Renée Zellweger. Both had worked the indies scene here for a few years before catapulting to bigger and bigger films.\n\nPart of what sets Austin apart as a location are the terrain and small communities surrounding the city that add to a filmmaker’s pallet when shooting on location. It’s the rich farmland to the east and the wild hill country, twisting waterways, rocky ridges and beautiful ranches to the west. In all directions are Americana towns like: Bartlett, Driftwood, Elgin, Georgetown, Lockhart, Manor, Martindale and more. There is no better film that showcases these treasures more than 1993’s \"What’s Eating Gilbert Grape\" - a small American epic about family, community and the profound strangeness that is life. Something many of us can really appreciate now, more than ever.\n\nThere have been around 300 films and television series produced in Austin over the past 50 years. In this series, we will look back decade-by-decade and explore those classic #MadeInAustin productions that are available to stream from the comfort of home. Here is a fact to blow some minds: \"What’s Eating Gilbert Grape,\" \"Dazed and Confused\" and \"A Perfect World\" were all released within a half year of each other - proof that production grew exponentially during the period. So, the 1990s will be split into two entries. This entry covers 1990-1995, while the second piece coming next week will hit 1996-1999!\n\nSlacker (1991)\n\nDirected by: Richard Linklater\n\nStarring: Richard Linklater, Kim Krizan, Mark James, Stella Weir, John Slate, Louis Mackey, Teresa Taylor\n\nOrion Pictures\n\nRated R / 97 minutes / Comedy\n\nMany consider \"Slacker\" to be the definitive Austin and Gen X film. As Chris Walters with the Austin Chronicle wrote, \"Few of the many films shot in Austin over the past 10 or 15 years even attempt to make something of the way its citizens live. \"Slacker\" is the only one that claims this city's version of life on the margins of the working world as its whole subject.\" \"Slacker\" presents a meandering day in Austin as the camera roams from place to place and provides a brief look at the overeducated, the social misfits, the outcasts and the oddballs. Shot in 1989 on a budget of $23,000, \"Slacker\" premiered at Austin’s Dobie Theater in July 1990. After playing the festival circuit for a year, \"Slacker\" found a distributor and was released into select theaters nationwide in July 1991. Though it found a small audience at first, \"Slacker\" became a huge cult film, kickstarting Richard Linklater’s career and the burgeoning indie film scene not only in Austin but in the United States."
