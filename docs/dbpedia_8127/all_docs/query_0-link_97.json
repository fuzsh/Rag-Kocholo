Among the hundreds of Motown recordings he played on are \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" by Marvin Gaye, \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch)\" by Four Tops, and \"Stop! In the Name of Love\" by The Supremes\n\nin 2002 - Keyboard player Johnny Griffith died. Had been a member of the Motown records house band, played on Marvin Gaye's 'Heard It Through The Grapevine.'\n\nin 2002 - Westlife went to No.1 on the UK singles chart with 'Unbreakable' the Irish boy bands record breaking 11th UK No.1.\n\nin 2002 - Eminem was at No.1 on the US album chart with the '8 Mile Soundtrack.'\n\nin 2004 - Katy de la Cruz dies at age 97. Leading Filipino singer born in Intramuros, Manila, she specialized in jazz vocals and torch songs in a performing career that lasted eight decades. Hailed as \"The Queen of Filipino Jazz\" and as \"The Queen of Bodabil\", she was, by the age of 18, the highest paid entertainer in the Philippines. She also appeared in films and received a FAMAS Best Supporting Actress Award in 1953., ill health caused her to retire from public life in the 1990s .\n\nVideo Notes: Katy De la Cruz was born on February 13, 1907, in Intramuros, Manila. Even as a young child, Katy would be hired to sing at town fiestas, and at intermissions during cockfights and boxing matches. Her formal schooling ended at the third grade.\n\nIn 1914, when Katy was seven, she was hired by the owner of a Manila film theater to sing to the audiences in between movie screenings. Such performances were typical in Manila theaters during that period, and from those routines would emerge a distinct genre eventually known as 'Bodabil'. Katy learned her songs through listening to phonograph records, and mastered the English language with the help of her brother.\n\nBy the age of thirteen, Katy was a rising star in the 'bodabil' circuit, performing alongside other leading stage performers such as Atang de la Rama. She soon became a solo headliner, performing in Manila's largest theaters such as the Savoy, the Palace, and the Lux. By 1925, Katy was the highest paid entertainer in the Philippines. She fell in love, and later married, the piano player of her stage show. Some of the chorus ..... who performed alongside her onstage, such as Chichay, Etang Discher, Patsy, and Mary Walter, later become prominent entertainers in their own right.\n\nKaty was acknowledged as a proficient performer of torch songs who drew comparisons to Sophie Tucker. Initially, her signature tune was the bluesy ballad St. Louis Blues. After jazz became popular in the Philippines in the 1920s, Katy adapted her singing style and soon mastered the art of scat singing, which became a trademark of hers. By the 1930s, Katy would be most identified with the song 'Balut', a fast-paced jazzy tune written by Jerry Brandy. Katy's take on the song, which afforded her to showcase her scatting ability, has been described as impish and rustic, rounded out by her low, playfully dragging key. A slightly bawdy take on the notorious Filipino culinary delicacy, 'Balut' remains popular to date, with versions performed by the Mabuhay Singers, New Minstrels, Pilita Corrales etc.\n\nKaty occasionally acted in films, most prominently in Inspirasyon (1953), for which she received the FAMAS Best Supporting Actress Award in 1953.Many of her films were for Sampaguita Pictures.\n\nAs 'bodabil' slowly declined, Katy concentrated on concert performances and international tours. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, she was a top-billed performer at the famed Forbidden City nightclub in San Francisco. In 1961, she starred in her own stage show in Las Vegas. Katy also performed concert tours in Thailand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and Hawaii.\n\nKaty eventually retired to San Francisco, California,though she would occasionally perform until the late 1980s. In 1989, she visited the Philippines to attend the premiere at the Cultural Center of the Philippines of 'Katy!', a highly-publicized stage musical based on her life. Ill health caused Katy to retire from public life in the 1990s.

He is considered one of the most important figures in Dutch popular music, and \"defied the notion that early rock and roll was a phenomenon of white and black musicians from America\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was known for his wide vocal range (5 octaves) and virtuoso guitar playing as well as his showmanship. Many Dutch musicians, including Jan Akkerman, Barry Hay, and Herman Brood have cited him as major influences.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Tielman is credited with releasing the first Dutch rock and roll single, in 1958, and led the first Dutch rock band with international appeal, the Tielman Brothers, in a career that spanned seven decades, from the mid 1950s to his death in 2011. During Tielman's heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, the Tielman Brothers were hailed as the best live act in Europe and received the highest fees.[citation needed] In 2005 he was awarded a Royal decoration in the Order of Orange Nassau. In 2011 Tielman died of gastric cancer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Andy Tielman was born in Makassar, Celebes, Dutch East Indies on 30 May 1936. Both his father, a KNIL captain named Herman Tielman, and his mother, Flora Laurentine Hess, were Indo-European. Aside from Andy, the couple had 5 children: Reggy, Phonton, Loulou (Lawrence), and Jane (Janette Loraine). When the Japanese invaded the Indies, the elder Tielman was imprisoned; Andy and his siblings were taken care of by his mother. He later recalled \"When war came the world was broken. My whole world just fell apart.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the family was reunited. By that time, Andy and his siblings were performing jazz standards at private functions using the musical training their father had given them. Within half a year they were performing throughout nascent Indonesia, which had proclaimed its independence after the Japanese surrender. The siblings' repertoire included both American and traditional Indonesian music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]By the time the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesia's independence in 1949, the Tielman siblings had become a household name; they even performed for President Sukarno at his palace in Jakarta. In 1951 they were introduced to the song \"Guitar Boogie\" by Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith. In an interview Tielman recalled: \"This was the first song which my brothers and I converted into rock 'n roll by adding drums to it.\" The band began playing rock and roll music by Les Paul, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Bill Haley, Fats Domino, Chuck Berry and Gene Vincent. Aside from the family band, Andy also played with Dolf de Vries' band The Starlights in Jakarta, as well as Freddy Wehner's Hawaiian band in Sumatra.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the late 1950s anti-Dutch rules and regulations increased, leading up to an escalation of the Dutch New Guinea conflict; it was feared that the Bersiap violence would be repeated. Dutch businesses and other properties were seized, Dutch social services were stopped, Dutch schools were banned and the last Dutch nationals were expelled. Anti-Dutch sentiments also affected Indo celebrities, including the Tielman siblings, and when they were pressured into forgoing their Dutch nationality the family repatriated to the Netherlands.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1957 the Tielman family moved to the Netherlands, first to a boarding house in Breda and later to The Hague. Their initial years in the Netherlands were difficult. Tielman later recalled that their first boarding house was \"really sad\" and said that music was the only thing that kept them going. The siblings, who required new instruments, went into a music shop to replace Andy's broken guitar. The owner forbid him to touch anything, until the siblings played some Elvis tunes for the owner and his family. Afterwards, Tielman received a guitar at a discount and only a small down payment.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Andy and his brothers began playing at a hotel for only 2,50 guilders a week. They were able to slowly acquire a fan base among rebellious youth and fellow musicians; however, they were not appreciated by the Dutch establishment or mainstream press. On national radio and television influential opinion makers such as Mies Bouwman and Willem Duys criticised and dismissed the brothers' music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After a successful show at the World Exhibition in Brussels, Belgium, in 1958, the Tielman Brothers were signed by a Belgian company to record the first Dutch rock 'n' roll single, \"Rock Little Baby Of Mine\". The band's flamboyant showmanship, acrobatic stage antics and rowdy sound were unheard of in the Netherlands. The band soon began performing internationally.[13] Tielman later recalled that though they were referred to as \"music rapists\", the Dutch kids knew exactly what was going on. The Tielman brothers were also the first to play Gibson Les Paul guitars in Europe.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In Germany the band found popularity and recorded some German-language songs. They played many live venues in the Reeperbahn area of Hamburg, a city with many American GIs and a lively music scene. Andy Tielman made an impression on both the German and British musicians playing there. In a later interview with Rolling Stone, George Harrison reflected on his Hamburg period, enthusiastically referring to \"Andy, the Indo man\". Tielman and his band enjoyed a successful musical career throughout Europe until the emergence of British beat music headed by The Beatles.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Although he enjoyed success in Europe, Tielman became upset over hysterical actions by fans, which included cases where women slit their wrists in front of the stage to get his attention. In the 1990 TV interview with Sonja Barend Tielman said: \"That's nothing to be proud of. [...] It's just very, very sad. [...] I just could not stand it anymore. [...] Maybe the Beatles could deal with that kind of thing. Not me.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the late 1970s Tielman abruptly ended his music career and left his family and property to live as a hermit in the jungles of Kalimantan among the Dayak people. In the TV interview with Sonja Barend he recalls: \"The Dayak hunted monkeys for food. I just hunted wild chicken.\" For over 2 years he lived a low profile and meditated until a female fan tracked him down in the Bali backwoods. For over a year the young German woman, who later became his wife, Carmen Tielman, stayed with him there until he decided to return to the \"civilised\" world and resume his career.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Tielman then moved to Australia and lived there for 5 years. In the 1980s he toured Asia, Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. Occasionally he would return to the Netherlands, where he gradually restarted his recording career. After the influential book Rockin Ramona was published in 1989, the Netherlands was re-discovering and rehabilitating its musical pioneers and Tielman was getting more and more recognition as a founding father of Dutch pop music.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Tielman eventually returned to the Netherlands full-time. In 1990 he played in a reunion concert with the Tielman Brothers. The same year he releases a solo album, entitled Now And Forever, followed in 1994 and 1995 by tours to the Caribbean and North America. In 1997 he released the album Loraine Jane, named after his only daughter. That year he also headlined a festival commemorating Elvis Presley at the Amsterdam RAI Convention Centre.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1998 the album Loraine Jane was presented at the Pasar Malam Besar in the Hague. On 31 October 1998 Tielman celebrated his 50th anniversary as an artist with a show at The Hague Houtrusthallen. Leading up to this anniversary Andy Tielman received much publicity in the Dutch media; Established Dutch artists like Herman Brood and Wally Tax expressed their admiration for his musical legacy. In 1999 Andy Tielman toured the United States.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2003 Andy Tielman recorded a new album in Amsterdam. In 2004 he recorded a live DVD at the Kurhaus in Scheveningen called It's My Life. In 2005 the DVD was officially presented at the Pasar Malam Besar in The Hague.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2005 Tielman was named to the Order of Orange-Nassau. Following the tsunami off Aceh in 2004, he made an appearance at the Dutch national benefit for the victims with two other Indo artists, Dinand Woesthoff (of Kane) and René van Barneveld (formerly of Urban Dance Squad), performing the traditional Indonesian songs \"Rayuan Pulau Kelapa\" and \"Ole sio sayang e\". In 2007 Tielman played with Chris Latul (formerly of Massada) in Utrecht, celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Pelita Foundation, the longest running social service organisation for Dutch Indos.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For the 50th anniversary of the single \"Rock Little Baby Of Mine\" in 2008, the 50 Years of Nederpop Foundation in Groningen held a weekend long festival. On 3 October he performed at the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam during the 50 Years of Nederpop Live festival. He headlined the national 5 May Liberation Day celebrations in The Hague in 2008. With Indorock band Tjendol Sunrise, he recorded the album 21st Century Rock, which includes new versions of hits from the Tielman Brothers, several new songs, as well as a new version of \"Rock Little Baby of Mine\". At the Tong Tong Fair, he teamed with guitarist Jan Akkerman for a one off concert.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]By the fall of 2009, Tielman had fallen ill and canceled a scheduled tour when he was diagnosed with cancer. In November he was operated on. By 19 December he had recovered enough to give a short performance in Drachten, and in March 2010 played a show at the Benidorm Palace in Spain, supported by other acts, such as Riem de Wolff of the Blue Diamonds. During the 2011 edition of Indo festival the Tong Tong Fair, Tielman celebrated his 75th birthday and held a sold-out farewell concert at the Bintang Theatre. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 - Allen Toussaint (/[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ˈ[/FONT][FONT=&quot]tu[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ː[/FONT][FONT=&quot]s[/FONT][FONT=&quot]ɑː[/FONT][FONT=&quot]nt/) American musician, songwriter, arranger and record producer, who was an influential figure in New Orleans R&B from the 1950s to the end of the century, described as \"one of popular music's great backroom figures.\" Many musicians recorded Toussaint's compositions, including \"Java\", \"Mother-in-Law\", \"I Like It Like That\", \"Fortune Teller\", \"Ride Your Pony\", \"Get Out of My Life, Woman\", \"Working in the Coal Mine\", \"Everything I Do Gonna Be Funky\", \"Here Come the .....\", \"Yes We Can Can\", \"Play Something Sweet\", and \"Southern Nights\". He was a producer for hundreds of recordings, among the best known of which are \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", by his longtime friend Dr. John (\"Mac\" Rebennack), and \".... Marmalade\", by Labelle.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The youngest of three children, Toussaint was born in 1938 in New Orleans and grew up in a shotgun house in the Gert Town neighborhood, where his mother, Naomi Neville (whose name he later adopted pseudonymously for some of his works), welcomed and fed all manner of musicians as they practiced and recorded with her son. His father, Clarence, worked on the railway and played trumpet. Allen Toussaint learned piano as a child and took informal music lessons from an elderly neighbor, Ernest Pinn. In his teens he played in a band, the Flamingos, with the guitarist Snooks Eaglin, before dropping out of school. A significant early influence on Toussaint was the syncopated \"second-line\" piano style of Professor Longhair.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After a lucky break at age 17, in which he stood in for Huey \"Piano\" Smith at a performance with Earl King's band in Prichard, Alabama, Toussaint was introduced to a group of local musicians led by Dave Bartholomew, who performed regularly at the Dew Drop Inn, a nightclub on Lasalle Street in Uptown New Orleans. His first recording was in 1957 as a stand-in for Fats Domino on Domino's record \"I Want You to Know\", on which Toussaint played piano and Domino overdubbed his vocals. His first success as a producer also came in 1957 with Lee Allen's \"Walking with Mr. Lee\". He began performing regularly in Bartholomew's band, and he recorded with Fats Domino, Smiley Lewis, Lee Allen and other leading New Orleans performers.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After being spotted as a sideman by the A&R man Danny Kessler, he initially recorded for RCA Records as Al Tousan. In early 1958 he recorded an album of instrumentals, The Wild Sound of New Orleans, with a band including Alvin \"Red\" Tyler (baritone sax), either Nat Perrilliat or Lee Allen (tenor sax), either Justin Adams or Roy Montrell (guitar), Frank Fields (bass), and Charles \"Hungry\" Williams (drums). The recordings included Toussaint and Tyler's composition \"Java\", which first charted for Floyd Cramer in 1962 and became a number 4 pop hit for Al Hirt (also on RCA) in 1964. Toussaint also recorded and co-wrote songs with Allen Orange in the early 1960s.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1960, Joe Banashak, of Minit Records and later Instant Records, hired Toussaint as an A&R man and record producer. He also did freelance work for other labels, such as Fury. Toussaint played piano, wrote, arranged and produced a string of hits in the early and mid-1960s for New Orleans R&B artists such as Ernie K-Doe, Chris Kenner, Irma Thomas, Art and Aaron Neville, the Showmen, and Lee Dorsey, whose first hit \"Ya Ya\" he produced in 1961.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The early to mid-1960s are regarded as Toussaint's most creatively successful period. Notable examples of his work are Jessie Hill's \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\" (written by Hill and arranged and produced by Toussaint), Ernie K-Doe's \"Mother-in-Law\", and Chris Kenner's \"I Like It Like That\". A two-sided 1962 hit by Benny Spellman comprised \"Lipstick Traces (on a Cigarette)\" (covered by the O'Jays, Ringo Starr, and Alex Chilton) and the simple but effective \"Fortune Teller\" (covered by various 1960s rock groups, including the Rolling Stones, the Nashville Teens, the Who, the Hollies, the Throb, and ex-Searchers founder Tony Jackson). \"Ruler of My Heart\", written under his pseudonym Naomi Neville, first recorded by Irma Thomas for the Minit label in 1963, was adapted by Otis Redding under the title \"Pain in My Heart\" later that year, prompting Toussaint to file a lawsuit against Redding and his record company, Stax (the claim was settled out of court, with Stax agreeing to credit Naomi Neville as the songwriter). Redding's version of the song was also recorded by the Rolling Stones on their second album. In 1964, \"A Certain ....\" (originally by Ernie K-Doe) was the B-side of the first single release by the Yardbirds. The song was released again in 1980 by Warren Zevon and (as \"A Certain Guy\") in 2007 by Mary Weiss, the former lead singer of the Shangri-Las.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Toussaint credited about twenty songs to his parents, Clarence and Naomi, sometimes using the pseudonym \"Naomi Neville\". These include \"Fortune Teller\", first recorded by Benny Spellman in 1961, and \"Work, Work, Work\", recorded by the Artwoods in 1966. Alison Krauss and Robert Plant covered \"Fortune Teller\" on their 2007 album Raising Sand.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Toussaint was drafted into the US Army in 1963 but continued to record when on leave. After his discharge in 1965, he joined forces with Marshall Sehorn to form Sansu Enterprises, which included a record label, Sansu, variously known as Tou-Sea, Deesu, or Kansu, and recorded Lee Dorsey, Chris Kenner, Betty Harris, and others. Dorsey had hits with several of Toussaint's songs, including \"Ride Your Pony\" (1965), \"Working in the Coal Mine\" (1966), and \"Holy Cow\" (1966). The core players of the rhythm section used on many of the Sansu recordings from the mid- to late 1960s, Art Neville and the Sounds, consisted of Art Neville on keyboards, Leo Nocentelli on guitar, George Porter on bass, and Zigaboo Modeliste on drums. They later became known as the Meters. Their backing can be heard in songs such as Dorsey's \"Ride Your Pony\" and \"Working in the Coal Mine\", sometimes augmented by horns, which were usually arranged by Toussaint. The Toussaint-produced records of these years backed by the members of the Meters, with their increasing use of syncopation and electric instrumentation, built on the influences of Professor Longhair and others before them, but updated these strands, effectively paving the way for the development of a modern New Orleans funk sound. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Toussaint continued to produce the Meters when they began releasing records under their own name in 1969. As part of a process begun at Sansu and reaching fruition in the 1970s, he developed a funkier sound, writing and producing for a host of artists, such as Dr. John (backed by the Meters, on the 1973 album In the Right Place, which contained the hit \"Right Place, Wrong Time\") and an album by the Wild Tchoupitoulas, a New Orleans Mardi Gras Indians tribe led by \"Big Chief Jolly\" (George Landry) (backed by the Meters and several of his nephews, including Art and Cyril Neville of the Meters and their brothers Charles and Aaron, who later performed and recorded as the Neville Brothers). One of his compositions, \"Here Come the .....\", recorded by Ernie K-Doe in 1970, formed the basis of the Sugababes' 2008 hit \".....\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the 1970s Toussaint began to work with artists from beyond New Orleans artists, such as B. J. Thomas, Robert Palmer, Willy DeVille, Sandy Denny, Elkie Brooks, Solomon Burke, Scottish soul singer Frankie Miller (High Life), and southern rocker Mylon LeFevre. He arranged horn music for the Band's albums Cahoots (1971) and Rock of Ages (1972) and for the documentary film The Last Waltz (1978). Boz Scaggs recorded Toussaint's \"What Do You Want the .... to Do?\" on his 1976 album Silk Degrees, which reached number 2 on the U.S. pop albums chart. The song was also recorded by Bonnie Raitt for her 1975 album Home Plate and by Geoff Muldaur (1976), Lowell George (1979), Vince Gill (1993), and Elvis Costello (2005). In 1976 he also collaborated with John Mayall on the album Notice to Appear.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1973 Toussaint and Sehorn created the Sea-Saint recording studio in the Gentilly section of eastern New Orleans. Toussaint also began recording under his own name, contributing vocals as well as piano. His solo career peaked in the mid-1970s with the albums From a Whisper to a Scream and Southern Nights. During this time he teamed with Labelle and produced their acclaimed 1975 album Nightbirds, which contained the number one hit \".... Marmalade\". The same year, Toussaint collaborated with Paul McCartney and Wings for their hit album Venus and Mars and played on the song \"Rock Show\". Also in 1973, his \"Yes We Can Can\" was covered by The Pointer Sisters for their self-titled debut album; released as a single, it became both a pop and R&B hit and served as the group's introduction to popular culture. Two years later, Glen Campbell covered Toussaint's \"Southern Nights\" and carried the song to number one on the pop, country and adult contemporary charts.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1987, he was the musical director of an off-Broadway show, Staggerlee, which ran for 150 performances. Like many of his contemporaries, Toussaint found that interest in his compositions was rekindled when his work began to be sampled by hip hop artists in the 1980s and 1990s.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Most of Toussaint's possessions, including his home and recording studio, Sea Saint, were lost during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He initially sought shelter at the Astor Crowne Plaza Hotel on Canal Street. Following the hurricane, whose aftermath left most of the city flooded, he left New Orleans for Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and for several years settled in New York City. His first television appearance after the hurricane was on the September 7, 2005, episode of the Late Show with David Letterman, sitting in with Paul Shaffer and his CBS Orchestra. Toussaint performed regularly at Joe's Pub in New York City through 2009. He eventually returned to New Orleans and lived there for the rest of his life.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The River in Reverse, Toussaint's collaborative album with Elvis Costello, was released on May 29, 2006, in the UK on Verve Records by Universal Classics and Jazz UCJ. It was recorded in Hollywood and, more notably, at the Piety Street Studio in the Bywater section Toussaint's native New Orleans, as the first major studio session to take place after Hurricane Katrina. In 2007, Toussaint performed a duet with Paul McCartney of a song by New Orleans musician and resident Fats Domino, \"I Want to Walk You Home\", as their contribution to Goin' Home: A Tribute to Fats Domino (Vanguard Records).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2008, Toussaint's song \"Sweet Touch of Love\" was used in a deodorant commercial for the Axe (Lynx) brand. The commercial won a Gold Lion at the 2008 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival. In February 2008, Toussaint appeared on Le Show, the Harry Shearer show broadcast on KCRW. He appeared in London in August 2008, where he performed at the Roundhouse. In October 2008 he performed at Festival New Orleans at The O2 alongside acts such as Dr. John and Buckwheat Zydeco. Sponsored by Quint Davis of the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Philip Anschutz, the event was intended to promote New Orleans music and culture and to revive the once lucrative tourist trade that had been almost completely lost following the flooding that came with Hurricane Katrina. After his second performance at the festival, Toussaint appeared alongside Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Toussaint performed instrumentals from his album The Bright Mississippi and many of his older songs for a taping of the PBS series Austin City Limits, which aired on January 9, 2015. In December 2009, he was featured on Elvis Costello's Spectacle program on the Sundance Channel, singing \"A Certain ....\". Toussaint appeared on Eric Clapton's 2010 album, Clapton, in two Fats Waller covers, \"My Very Good Friend the Milkman\" and \"When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His late-blooming career as a performer began when he accepted an offer to play a regular Sunday brunch session at an East Village pub. Interviewed in 2014 by The Guardian′s Richard Williams, Toussaint said, \"I never thought of myself as a performer.... My comfort zone is behind the scenes.\" In 2013 he collaborated on a ballet with the choreographer Twyla Tharp. Toussaint was a musical mentor to Swedish-born New Orleans songwriter and performer Theresa Andersson.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Toussaint was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame in 2009, and the Blues Hall of Fame in 2011. In 2013 he was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama. In 2016, he posthumously won the 'Pinetop Perkins Piano Player' title at the Blues Music Awards.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Toussaint died in the early hours of November 10, 2015, in Madrid, Spain, while on tour. Following a concert at the Teatro Lara on Calle Corredera Baja de San Pablo, he had a heart attack at his hotel and was pronounced dead on his arrival at hospital. He was 77. He had been due to perform a sold-out concert at the EFG London Jazz Festival at The Barbican on November 15 with his band and Theo Croker. He was also scheduled to play with Paul Simon at a benefit concert in New Orleans on 8 December. His final recording, American Tunes, titled after the Paul Simon song, which he sings on the album, was scheduled to be released by Nonesuch Records on June 10, 2016.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Toussaint's one marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his two children, Clarence (better known as Reginald) and Alison, and several grandchildren. His children had managed his career in his last years.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Writing in the New York Times, Ben Sisario quoted Quint Davis, producer of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival: \"In the pantheon of New Orleans music people, from Jelly Roll Morton to Mahalia Jackson to Fats—that's the place where Allen Toussaint is in\". Paul Simon said, \"We were friends and colleagues for almost 40 years.... We played together at the New Orleans jazz festival. We played the benefits for Katrina relief. We were about to perform together on December 8. I was just beginning to think about it; now I'll have to think about his memorial. I am so sad.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Daily Telegraph described Toussaint as \"a master of New Orleans soul and R&B, and one of America's most successful songwriters and producers\", adding that \"self-effacing Toussaint played a crucial role in countless classic songs popularised by other artists\". He had written so many songs, over more than five decades, that he admitted to forgetting quite a few.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 – Robert Lawson Craft, American conductor and writer, dies at age 92 in Gulf Stream, Florida. He is best known for his intimate working friendship with Igor Stravinsky, on which Craft drew in producing numerous recordings and books.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Craft was born in Kingston, New York to Raymond and Arpha Craft and studied music at the Juilliard School. He became particularly interested in early music and the music of Claudio Monteverdi, Carlo Gesualdo, and Heinrich Schütz, and in contemporary music by the composers of the Second Viennese School and others.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Craft met Stravinsky in 1948, and from then until the composer's death in 1971, Craft continued to work alongside Stravinsky in a variety of roles. A relationship that started out with Craft in a rather modest role eventually evolved into a full artistic partnership. Craft compiled the libretti for Stravinsky's The Flood and A Sermon, a Narrative and a Prayer, and lived with Igor and Vera Stravinsky in Hollywood and later in New York City. Craft remained close to the composer's widow until her death in 1982.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After Stravinsky's death, Craft continued to concertize and to write. His 2002 book, An Improbable Life, details his life before, during, and after his friendship with Stravinsky. The memoir elaborates on the impact that Igor Stravinsky had on his life.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Shortly after Stravinsky's death, Craft married the composer's longtime nurse, Rita Christiansen, though the marriage did not endure. His survivors include a son from that marriage, Alexander; a sister, Phyllis Crawford; his second wife, the former Alva Celauro Minoff, a singer and actress; two stepchildren, Edward Minoff and Melissa Minoff; and four grandchildren.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Craft collaborated with Stravinsky on a series of books that covered various musical and non-musical subjects: Conversations with Igor Stravinsky (1959); Memories and Commentaries (1960); Expositions and Developments (1962); Dialogues and a Diary (1963); Themes and Episodes (1967); Retrospectives and Conclusions (1969). They include transcribed conversations between the two men, interviews culled from various published sources, essays, diary entries, and the like, all with the professed aim of presenting Stravinsky's views on music and culture.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Conducting[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Craft was an award-winning conductor who led most of the major orchestras in the United States (New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic, St. Louis Symphony, and Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra), as well as international engagements in Canada, Europe, Russia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. He was the first American to conduct Alban Berg's Wozzeck and Lulu, and Hindemith's Cardillac. Craft also led the world premieres of Stravinsky's later, dodecaphonic works: Vom Himmel hoch, Agon, The Flood, Abraham and Isaac, Variations, Introitus, and Requiem Canticles.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Besides recording virtually all of Stravinsky's music, Craft conducted pioneering recordings of Schoenberg, Varèse, Webern and other works of then contemporary composers. While not a flamboyant conductor, Craft was known for his technically and musically precise interpretations.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was a two-time recipient of the Grand Prix du Disque, as well as the Edison Prize for his recordings of music by Varèse and Stravinsky. His recordings of the music of Stravinsky with the Orchestra of St. Luke's were originally available on eleven now out-of-print releases from MusicMasters and seven volumes from Koch. Since early 2005, these recordings have been gradually re-released by Naxos Records.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Craft remained in a vanguard position in relation to 20th-century art music throughout his life as a conductor and musicologist. Besides working closely with one of the greats from the 20th century, Craft produced volumes of academic and personal writings on Stravinsky and on other composers.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2002, Robert Craft was awarded the International Prix du Disque at the Cannes Music Festival.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]10 November[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2of 2[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]11 November[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 1 of 2\n\nin 1688 - Lorenzo Somis composer is born.\n\nin 1690 - Gerhard Hoffmann composer is born.\n\nin 1696 - Andrea Zani composer is born.\n\nin 1722 - Johann Philipp Sack composer is born.\n\nin 1725 - Georg F Handel's opera \"Tamerlano,\" premieres in London.\n\nin 1731 - Carl Joseph Toeschi composer is born.\n\nin 1750 - Apostolo Zeno, famous Italian opera librettist; dies at Venice.\n\nIn 1710 he founded the Giornale dei Letterati d'Italia, and in 1718 he was appointed court poet at Vienna; returned to Venice in 1729. The total number of librettos written by him (some in collaboration with Pietro Pariati) is 71; they were collected and ed. by Gasparo Gozzi as Poesie drammatiche di Apostolo Zeno (10 vols., Venice, 1744; reprinted in 11 vols., Orleans, 1785-86).

He studied piano with C. A. Hoffmann and Aloys Schmitt in Frankfurt am Main, and with J. A. Andre and J. G. Vollweiler in Offenbach. Following tours in Germany, Poland, and Russia as a concert artist, he went to Berlin in 1824. His opera Irene was premiered there in 1832, but it was not a success. In 1835 he became music director in Miinster. In 1847 he went to Christiania as director of the Philharmonic Society, and also became organist at Holy Trinity Church in 1857. His son, Karl Arnold (b. Berlin, June 8, 1824; d. Oslo, Aug. 9, 1867), was also a cellist who was a member of the royal chapel in Stockholm. – Born at Neukirchen, May 6, 1794,\n\nin 1883 - Ernest Ansermet is born.\n\nAnsermet was born in Vevey, Switzerland. Although he was a contemporary of Wilhelm Furtwängler and Otto Klemperer, Ansermet represents in most ways a very different tradition and approach from those two musicians. Originally he was a mathematics professor, teaching at the University of Lausanne. He began conducting at the Casino in Montreux in 1912, and from 1915 to 1923 was the conductor for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Traveling in France for this, he met both Debussy and Ravel, and consulted them on the performance of their works. During World War I, he met Stravinsky, who was exiled in Switzerland, and from this meeting began the conductor's lifelong association with Russian music.\n\nIn 1918, Ansermet founded his own orchestra, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (OSR). He toured widely in Europe and America and became famous for accurate performances of difficult modern music, making first recordings of works such as Stravinsky's Capriccio with the composer as soloist. Also, Ansermet was one of the first in the field of classical music to take jazz seriously, and in 1919 he wrote an article praising Sidney Bechet.[1]\n\nAfter World War II, Ansermet and his orchestra rose to international prominence through a long-term contract with Decca Records. From that time until his death, he recorded most of his repertoire, often two or three times. His interpretations were widely regarded as admirably clear and authoritative, though the orchestral playing did not always reach the highest international standards, and they differed notably from those of other famous 20th-century specialists, notably Pierre Monteux and Stravinsky himself. Ansermet disapproved of Stravinsky's practice of revising his works, and always played the original versions. Although famous for performing much modern music by other composers such as Arthur Honegger and Frank Martin, he avoided altogether the music of Arnold Schoenberg and his associates, even criticizing Stravinsky when he began to use twelve-tone techniques in his compositions.[2] In Ansermet's book, Les fondements de la musique dans la conscience humaine (1961), he sought to prove, using Husserlian phenomenology and partly his own mathematical studies, that Schoenberg's idiom was false and irrational.\n\nIn his last years, he and his ensemble surprised many by issuing discs devoted to Haydn, Beethoven and Brahms. These performances were not at all conventionally Germanic, and were much criticized at the time of their appearance, but during recent years their vivacity has come to be appreciated more.[citation needed]\n\nIn May 1954, Decca recorded Ansermet and the orchestra in Europe's first commercial stereophonic recordings. They went on to record the first stereo performance of the complete The Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky on LP (Artur Rodziński had already recorded a stereo performance on magnetic tape, but this had been released on LP only in mono). Ansermet also conducted early stereo recordings of Debussy's Nocturnes and the Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune.\n\nAnsermet was an ardent man who argued his opinions vehemently. He was notable in Britain for his argumentative rehearsals with British orchestras, who were used to the more jovial style of Sir Thomas Beecham or the more restrained manner of Sir Adrian Boult. His last recording, of Stravinsky's The Firebird, was made in London with the New Philharmonia Orchestra, which included a recording of the rehearsal sessions made as a memorial to him. Another late recording for Decca, also issued as a memorial album, was with L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, and was devoted to Albéric Magnard's Symphony No. 3 and Édouard Lalo's Scherzo for Orchestra.\n\nAnsermet composed some piano pieces and compositions for orchestra, among them a symphonic poem entitled Feuilles de Printemps (Leaves of Spring). He also orchestrated Debussy's Six épigraphes antiques in 1939.\n\nHe died on 20 February 1969 in Geneva at the age of 85.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCvE2Qg3ofw\"]Brahms - Ernest Ansermet - Symphony No.3 Mvt.4 - YouTube[/ame][/FONT]​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1894 - Aaron Avshalomov, Russian-born American composer, father of Jacob (David) Avshalomov, is born at Nikolayevsk, Siberia. He studied at the Zurich Conservatpru. In 1914 he went to China, where he wrote a number of works on Chinese subjects, making use of authentic Chinese themes. On April 24, 1925, he conducted the first performance in Beijing of his first opera, on a Chinese subject, Kuan Yin; his 2nd opera, also on a Chinese subject, The Great Wall, was staged in Shanghai on Nov. 26, 1945, as were The Soul of the Ch'in, ballet (May 21, 1933); Incense Shadows, pantomime (March 13, 1935); Piano Concerto (Jan. 19, 1936); Violin Concerto (Jan. 16, 1938); 1st Symphony (March 17, 1940, composer conducting); and Buddha and the 5 Planetary Deities, choreographic tableau (April 18,1942).

He toured Russia with his brother (1851-53), then was awarded a scholarship from the Czar for study with Liszt in Weimar (1855-56); he received training in theory from A.B. Marx in Berlin (1856--58). Wieniawski taught piano at the Russian Musical Soc. in Moscow (1864--65), then taught piano for one term at the Moscow Cons. before resuming private teaching. In 1875-76 he was director of the Warsaw Musical Soc., with which he appeared as a chamber music artist and as a choral conductor. He then was prof. of piano at the Brussels Cons. (1878-1912). – Born at Lublin, May 23, 1837.\n\nin 1913 - German Leont'yevich Zhukovsky composer is born.\n\nin 1914 - Hansje Toussaint [Hermina A Schenk], singer (Sing of the Cross) is born.\n\nin 1917 - Julien-Francois Zbinden, Swiss composer, pianist, and administrator, born at Rolle.\n\nHe began piano lessons at the age of 8 and later attended the Lausanne Conservatory. He also studied at the teacher's training college in the canton of Vaud (1934-38; graduated, 1938), and then was active as a pianist. After teaching himself harmony, form, and composition, he pursued training in counterpoint and orchestration with Gerber.\n\nIn 1947 he joined Radio Lausanne as a pianist and music producer, becoming head of the music dept. in 1956. From 1965 to 1982 he was deputy director of musical broadcasts of the Radio-Television Suisse Romande. He served as president of the Swiss Musicians Assn. (1973-79) and of SUISA (the Swiss music copyright society; 1987-91).\n\nIn 1978 the French government made him an Officier de l'ordre des Arts et des Lettres. His early love of jazz, as well as the influence of Ravel, Stravinsky, and Honegger, were important factors in the development of his own musical style. Among his works were La Pantoufle, farce-ballet (1958), Fait divers, opera (1960), radiophonic scores, Piano Concerto (1944), Concerto da camera for piano and strings (1950-51), 4 syms., Suite francoise for strings (1954), Rhapsodie for violin and orch.

Mose heard blues on the jukebox in a gas station. He took piano lessons from the age of five until his early teens, when he taught himself trumpet, which he played in the high school band of nearby Charleston, Miss. He also played piano on weekends in a band at a honkytonk near Greenwood. In 1945 Allison enrolled at the Univ. of Miss, in Oxford to study chemical engineering, but soon began playing and writing for the band.\n\nDuring 1946-47 he spent 18 months in army bands, then returned to college in 1950, when he decided to pursue music full time, at first in Lake Charles and then in other towns in La. On a summer job in St. Louis he met Audre Schwartz, whom he married in 1951. (That summer he also visited N.Y.C. for the first time.) They moved to Baton Rouge where he completed his B.A. in English at La. State Univ. in 1952, while continuing to perform locally.\n\nAfter several more years freelancing in the Southeast and in Tex. and Colo., often with bassist Taylor La Fargue, the Allisons moved to N.Y. in 1956; by 1959 they had four children. Allison worked with Al Cohn, Zoot Sims, Stan Getz (1957), and Gerry Mulligan. During 1957 he also formed his own trio and soon achieved success in this format, performing in N.Y, Paris, Stockholm, and Copenhagen, sometimes with the addition of local musicians. Allison reached the height of his popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when his clever blues influenced- but-very-contemporary songs caught on with a college-age audience. For a while, he was a popular touring act, and his songs were covered by artists such as Bonnie Raitt. He has continued to record and tour sporadically into the 1990s. Allison's daughter Amy is an acclaimed singer and songwriter with the country-influenced band Parlor James, whose first release was in 1996. Some of his discs are: Back Country Suite (1957); The Transfiguration of Hiram Brown (1959); I Love the Life I Live (1960); Don't Worn/ About a Thing (1962); The Word from Mose (1964); Western Man (1971); Your Mind Is on Vacation (1976); Middle Class White Boy (1982); Ever Since the World Ended (1987); Earth Wants You (1993 ).\n\nin 1928 - Arthur Cunningham composer is born.\n\nin 1928 - Ernestine Anderson jazz vocalist is born.\n\nin 1929 - Delores Williams/Delores LaVern Baker (US R&B singer) is born.\n\nin 1929 - Lavern Baker, (Dolores Williams), big-lunged R&B star of the 1950s (I Cried a Tear), is born at Chicago.\n\nDolores Williams began singing in church at the age of 12, and started performing professionally at Chicago's Club DeLisa in 1946, billed as 'Little Miss Sharecropper'. Spotted by bandleader Fletcher Henderson, she initially recorded for the OKeh subsidiary of Columbia Records in 1948, subsequently recording for RCA-Victor in 1949.\n\nAdopting the name Lavern Baker, she performed and recorded for King Records with Todd Rhodes's band in 1952-53, and signed with Atlantic Records in 1953 upon her return from a solo European tour. Her third release, Winfield Scott's novelty song \"Tweedle Dee/7 became a smash R&B and major pop hit in early 1955. However, white artist Georgia Gibbs quickly covered the song for Mercury and scored an even bigger pop hit.\n\nThrough 1956 Baker scored smash R&B hits with \"Bop-Ting-ALing' 7 \"That's All I Need\" and the ballads \"Play It Fair\" and \"Still\" (covered by The Commodores in 1979), backed with \"I Can't Love You Enough,\" a major pop hit.

Subsequent hits included \"I Waited Too Long\" (written by Neil Sedaka), the rave-up \"Saved\" (written and produced by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller), and blues legend Ma Rainey's \"See See Rider/' By 1964 Baker had left Atlantic, managing her final, albeit minor, hit with \"Think Twice,\" recorded with Jackie Wilson, on Brunswick Records in 1966.\n\nWhile touring Asia in 1969 she became seriously ill and moved to the Philippines, where she managed and occasionally performed at a Marine NCO club on Subic Bay for over 20 years.

Tracy, but suffered two strokes, as well as diabetes.\n\nShe died at a N.Y. hospital on March 10, 1997. A major R&B artist of the 1950s, Lavern Baker scored some of the earliest crossover hits onto the pop charts, including \"Tweedle Dee\" and \"Jim Dandy.\" However, cover versions of several of her hits, primarily by white artist Georgia Gibbs, kept her from achieving as large a sales success as she might otherwise have accomplished. Performing in early rock 'n' roll movies and tours, Baker's career went into eclipse in the mid-1960s with the rise of soul music. She eventually re-emerged in the 1990s, performing on the cabaret and nightclub circuit, as well as in blues and rock-revival festivals, until her death in 1997.\n\nin 1929 - Mieczyslaw Soltys composer, dies at 66.\n\nin 1930 - Walter Louis \"Hank\" Garland (US session guitarist) is born.\n\nin 1932 - Al Levitt drummer is born.\n\nin 1936 - Opal Courtney Jr (American doo-... singer; The Spaniels) is born.\n\nin 1936 - Welsh composer, conductor and violinist Sir Edward German, died at the age of 74, in London.\n\nin 1937 - Buddy Jimmy Lee Land Ace, singer is born.\n\nin 1936 - Jack Keller (US songwriter) is born.\n\nin 1936 - Edward German composer, dies at 74.\n\nin 1938 - Roger Lavern (UK keyboards; English instrumental group The Tornados) is born.\n\nin 1941 - Jesse Colin Young (US singer, songwriter; The Youngbloods).\n\nin 1943 - Mac Kissoon (singer; Mac & Katie/freelance/sessionist) is born.\n\nin 1943 - Chas Hodges rocker is born.\n\nin 1943 - Karin Kent [Janneke Kanteman], Dutch singer is born.\n\nin 1944 - Jesse Colin Young NYC, rock vocalist (Youngbloods-Soul of a City Boy) is born.\n\nin 1945 - Vince Martell (US guitar, Vanilla Fudge) is born.\n\nin 1945 - Chris Dreja (UK rhythm guitarist, bass, photographer; Yardbirds/Led Zeppelin) is born.\n\nIn 1945 - Jerome David Kern dies at age 60.American composer of musical theatre and popular music.

As a student there he formed his first quartet, featuring vibraphonist Peter Shade. Recordings of this are on HEP (Chronos and Silhouette, released on Gearbox vinyl). Aside from some lessons at the Ivor Mairants School of Dance Music, Garrick was \"an entirely self-taught musician\" (he had been expelled from Eleanor B. Franklin-Pike's piano lessons for quoting from \"In the Mood\" at a pupils' concert), though he attended Berklee College, Boston, as a mature student in the 1970s.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Soon after graduating, Garrick became the musical director of \"Poetry & Jazz in Concert\", a roadshow devised by poet and publisher Jeremy Robson, and involving writers as diverse as Laurie Lee, Adrian Mitchell, Vernon Scannell, Spike Milligan, Dannie Abse, and John Smith. Garrick's quintet at this time included Joe Harriott and Shake Keane. Garrick came to special prominence in the British contemporary jazz world initially as the pianist with the Don Rendell–Ian Carr quintet from 1965 to 1969, and led his own sextet from 1966.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Garrick is perhaps best known for his jazz-choral works, the first of which he started in 1967. Jazz Praises, an extended religious work for his sextet and a large choir, was performed at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, and elsewhere. With poet John Smith he produced a series of such works, starting in 1969 with Mr Smith's Apocalypse for sextet, speakers, and chorus, which had its premiere at the Farnham Festival. The culmination of this partnership was A Zodiac of Angels, a choral jazz ballet performed opposite Carmina Burana under the innovative baton of Victor Fox in the Opera Theatre Manchester in January 1988 and utilising symphony orchestra, seven jazz soloists including Norma Winstone, full choir and a dance company. Indian classical music has influenced many of his compositions.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Aside from his performing, recording, and composing, Garrick was heavily involved in jazz education, and held teaching posts at the Royal Academy of Music and at Trinity College of Music, London; he continued to teach at summer schools, both for the Guildhall School of Music and on his own Jazz Academy Vacation Courses, from 1989 at Beechwood in Tunbridge Wells.

In 2010 Garrick began a collaboration with vocalist Nette Robinson. At the time of his death he had also begun to develop work with a quartet including vibraphonist Jim Hart, which would have reworked some of the music of the Modern Jazz Quartet and would have provided an echo of his own first quartet, half a century earlier. That year, he also participated in the release of a 1964 recording, The .... with Brown Hair, featuring his trio (with Colin Barnes on drums and Dave Green on bass) backing ....

He later became the owner of Combine Records.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2014 – James \"Jim\" Brian Erb, American composer, arranger, musicologist, and conductor dies at age 88. The founding conductor of the Richmond Symphony Chorus, Erb led that chorus from 1971 to 2007 while also directing chorus activities at the University of Richmond, where he was for a while chair of the music department. Erb is most broadly known for his arrangement of the folk song \"Shenandoah\", and among musicologists of the Renaissance for his work on the magnificats of Orlando di Lasso published by Bärenreiter.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Erb was born in La Junta, Colorado. After serving in the United States Army during World War II, Erb completed his undergraduate education in music at Colorado College. He also studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. He later earned a masters in voice at Indiana University and a doctorate from Harvard University.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He began teaching music at a junior high school in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Beginning in 1954 he taught music and conducted the choirs and glee clubs at the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia, where he taught until his retirement in 1994. While teaching at Richmond, he was a three-time winner of the University's Distinguished Educator Award. It was during this period that he composed his arrangement of the folk tune \"Shenandoah\", for a tour of Europe by the University of Richmond Choir.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In addition to the Richmond Symphony Chorus, Erb also conducted the group Chorus of Alumni and Friends of the University of Richmond (CAFUR), which was originally associated with the University of Richmond. CAFUR's final concert was in 1994 with the singing of Rachmaninoff's Vespers. In 2014, he died at the age of 88 in Richmond.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Erb's published arrangements include sources from classical, liturgical, and folk music. Among the better known arrangements is Erb's version of \"Shenandoah\", called \"one of the classic arrangements sung by high school and college choirs across the country.\" The arrangement has been performed by numerous choirs, including the Virginia Glee Club (who commissioned the TTBB version), the Chanticleer ensemble in an arrangement that combines it with the Marshall Bartholomew version, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, whose performance of it appeared on the soundtrack to the 1995 film Nixon.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2014 – Johnny Dyer, American electric blues harmonicist and singer dies at age 75. He received a nomination for a Blues Music Award, and was involved in a number of recordings, both as a solo performer and with other musicians.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dyer grew up on the Stovall Plantation in Rolling Fork, Mississippi, United States, and learnt to play the harmonica from the age of seven. His initial inspiration came from hearing Little Walter on a Nashville, Tennessee, based radio station, and by his teenage years Dyer was playing acoustic harmonica and had formed his own band. He started playing amplified harmonica in the early 1950s, when he first performed alongside Smokey Wilson.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dyer relocated to Los Angeles, California in January 1958, where he met George \"Harmonica\" Smith. Together they played concerts with a \"father and son\" billing. Dyer commented on that time stating, \"Smith was the hottest thing around and the blues was really swinging! He taught me a lot. Everybody loved George.\" Following this Dyer set up his own combo, Johnny Dyer and the Blue Notes, and played with Jimmy Reed, J.B. Hutto, and Jimmy Rogers.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Times took a downturn for Dyer in the 1960s, and he stepped away from the music industry for some while. Finally appearing again in the 1980s, Dyer found work with other harmonica players, such as Shakey Jake Harris, Harmonica Fats (pseudonym for Harvey Blackston; 1927–2000), and Rod Piazza. Dyer released a couple of singles including \"Overdose of Love\" and, in 1983, issued the Johnny Dyer and the LA Jukes album. The Netherlands record label, Black Magic featured Dyer on their Hard Times: L.A. Blues Anthology compilation album.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dyer later collaborated with guitarist Rick Holmstrom, and together they issued two albums on Black Top Records: Listen Up (1994) and Shake It! (1995). Listen Up included Dyer's cover version of the blues standard, \"Driftin' Blues\". The album, Jukin', also released in 1995, was a re-issue of Dyer's debut LP with additional tracks. It contained Dyer's version of \"Baby What You Want Me to Do\".[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He appeared on the bill at the Long Beach Blues Festival in 2000, where he sang alongside James Cotton. Over the years he was a featured performer on Mark Hummel's annual Blues Harmonica Blowout tours.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Dyer received a Blues Music Award nomination in 2004, in the 'Blues Song Of The Year' category, for the track \"Hard Times Won.\" He has also spent time playing with The Mannish Boys, and has appeared on a number of their album releases.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His final album was Rolling Fork Revisited (2004), recorded with Mark Hummel. The album contained reworkings of songs by another Rolling Fork native, Muddy Waters.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2015 – Philip John Taylor better known as Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, was an English rock drummer in the English rock band Motörhead from 1975–1984 and 1987–1992 recording eleven studio albums and four live albums, including No Sleep 'til Hammersmith and Nö Sleep at All, between them. The Motörhead line-up consisting of Lemmy, \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke and Taylor are considered the 'classic' line-up of the band.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born on 21 September 1954, in Hasland, Chesterfield, England, Taylor grew up in Leeds and was a Leeds United hooligan. He took up drum lessons at Leeds College of Music on advice from his father. He replaced Motörhead's first drummer, Lucas Fox, during the recording of the band's first album On Parole in 1975. Lemmy explains choosing him to play in Motörhead 'because he had a car and could give us a lift back down to the studio, the drummer we had wasn't working out very well and Phil kept saying that he could play'. Taylor introduced the band to \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, having worked with him while painting a houseboat. Taylor was unable to overdub the drumming on the \"Lost Johnny\" track as he was arrested for being drunk and disorderly. Also, the studio time had run out by the time he was released.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1978, Taylor, Lemmy and Clarke interrupted one of The Damned's Chiswick album sessions, turning it into a recorded 'jam session'. One track from this – \"Ballroom Blitz\" – appeared as the B-side of I Just Can't Be Happy Today. Shortly after recording the classic Ace of Spades album in 1980, Taylor broke his neck after being lifted above the head of a friend in a test of strength, only to be dropped upon his head. Taylor continued to play in Motörhead with the aid of a neck brace, as is visible in the music video for \"Ace of Spades\". As a result, Taylor had a prominent lump located on the back of his neck (affectionately referred to as his \"knob\"), thought to be a calcium deposit caused by his previous spinal trauma. Tour-disrupting injuries were not unfamiliar to Taylor at the time, as he had previously broken his hand whilst punching a man outside his flat in London. In typical uncompromising Motörhead style, Taylor continued to drum by using gaffer tape to attach his drum stick into his hand until it had sufficiently healed.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After a 'final' appearance on The Young Ones in 1984, Taylor left Motörhead. The following year, he made appearances with Waysted, and joined another ex-Motörhead man, Brian Robertson (from Thin Lizzy), to form the band Operator. In 1986, he was part of Frankie Miller's touring band.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Taylor returned to Motörhead in 1987. He said \"I always regretted leaving. Let's just say I took a three-year holiday.\" He continued playing in the group until 1992. After having been warned three times in the previous two years \"to get his act together\", he was fired after recording \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\", because of his poor performance.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]From 2005 to 2008 Taylor played and recorded in a group called The Web of Spider with ...... Kirst (Iggy Pop) on guitar and Max Noce on bass. In 2007 Taylor briefly worked on a project called Capricorn with former Danzig guitarist Todd Youth, former Monster Magnet guitarist/vocalist Phil Caivano and former Nashville ..... bassist Corey Parks. After playing in The Web of Spider, Taylor began work on a project with guitarist Chris Holmes, formerly of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P., and in 2009, Taylor joined American thrash metal band Overkill for a set at the Islington Academy. The set included a cover of the Motörhead song from which Overkill took their name.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He sporadically played drums for Mick Farren and The Deviants, featuring on Dr. Crow (2002), Sheep in Wolves' Clothing (2008),[5] and Portobello Shuffle (2009).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Taylor has, on a somewhat regular and obviously incorrect basis, been reported as having died in a spectacular or horrible fashion. An example took place in 2001, when Taylor was allegedly to have died from AIDS. This was disproved by Taylor's appearance on the 2005 documentary Ace Of Spades: Classic Albums, alongside Lemmy and former members of Motörhead, frequently joking about his supposed demise.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Taylor reunited with Lemmy and Clarke on 6 November 2014 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, England on stage for Motörhead's classic \"Ace of Spades\" only to come on to wave to the crowd and leave.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Death[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Phil Taylor died on 11 November 2015 at the age of 61 after an illness. \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke said of his former bandmate via Facebook:[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] My dear friend and brother passed away last night.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] He had been ill for sometime but that does not make it any easier when the time finally comes. I have known Phil since he was 21 and he was one hell of a character. Fortunately we made some fantastic music together and I have many many fond memories of our time together. Rest in Peace, Phil!\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Lemmy told Classic Rock that he was \"devastated\" to have lost one of his best friends as he also remembered former Motörhead guitarist Michael \"Würzel\" Burston, who died in 2011.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] I'm feeling very sad at the moment, in fact devastated because one of my best friends died yesterday. I miss him already. His name was Phil Taylor, or Philthy Animal, and he was our drummer twice in our career. Now he's died and it really pisses me off that they take somebody like him and leave George Bush alive. So muse on that. We're still going, we're still going strong, it's just first Wurzel and now Philthy, it's a shame man. I think this rock'n'roll business might be bad for the human life.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Lemmy himself died less than seven weeks after Taylor, on 28 December 2015.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Later it was revealed that liver failure was cited as the cause of Taylor's death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]11 November[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2 of 2[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]12 November[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 1 of 2\n\nin 1606 - Matthaus Ludecus composer, dies at 79.\n\nin 1676 - Giovanni Antonio Pollarolo composer is born.\n\nin 1730 - Caterina Gabrielli, famous Italian soprano, is born at Rome. Her father served as a cook to Prince Gabrielli, and the prince made it possible for her to pursue vocal training. She thus took his name in appreciation; her nickname \"La Coghetta\" (\"Little Cook\") derives from her father's position. She most likely studied with Porpora in Venice (1744-47), then sang throughout Italy with notable success. She subsequently went to Vienna, where she made her concert debut at the Burgtheater on Feb. 16, 1755. She found a friend and mentor in Metastasio, and quickly established herself as one of the leading singers of the day. In 1758 she went to Milan, where she found another mentor in the castrato Gaetano Guadagni. That same year she was in Padua and Lucca, and later appeared in Parma (1759-60). She then returned to Vienna, where she created the title roles in Gluck's Tetide (Oct. 8, 1760)and Traetta's Armide(jan. 3, 1761). Following further appearances in Italy, she sang in St. Petersburg (1772-75) and in London (1775-76); she then returned to Italy, singing in Naples, Venice, Lucca, and Milan until her 1780retirement. Her reputed beauty and scandalous liaisons made her a legendary figure in operatic lore. - Died at Rome, Feb. 16, 1796.\n\nin 1739 - Ludwig Ernst composer, dies at 71.\n\nin 1742 - Francesco Antonio Calegari, Italian composer, music theorist, and teacher, died at Venice.\n\nAfter taking his vows as a Franciscan at the Palma del Friuli convent in Venice, he obtained his bachelor's degree at the Franciscan seminary in Assisi and then studied counterpoint with Lotti. He was maestro di cappella at S. Francesco in Bologna (1700-01), S. maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice (1701-03; 1727-42), and the basilica of S. Antonio in Padua (1703-27). Calegari wrote much sacred music and several treatises, the most important being Ampla dimonstrazione degli armoniali musicali tuoni (1732), which concerns dissonance in figured basses. – Born at Venice, 1656.\n\nin 1817 - Carlo Pedrotti composer is born.\n\nin 1817 - Martin Gustav Nottebohm composer is born.\n\nin 1823 - Emmanuel Aloys Forster composer, dies at 75.\n\nin 1827 - Gustav Adolf Merkel composer is born.\n\nTODAY'S MUSICAL SPOTLIGHT SHINES ON . . .\n\nin 1833 - Alexander Borodin (Russian composer;vocal/opera/chamber/symphonic) is born.\n\nHe was the illegitimate son of a Georgian prince, Gedianov; his mother was the wife of an army doctor. In accordance with customary procedure in such cases, the child was registered as the lawful son of one of Gedianov's serfs, Porfiry Borodin; hence, the patronymic, Alexander Porfirievich.\n\nHe was given an excellent education; learned several foreign languages, and was taught to play the flute. He played four-hand arrangements of Haydn's and Beethoven's syms. with his musical friend M. Shchiglev. At the age of 14, he tried his hand at composition; wrote a piece for flute and piano and a String Trio on themes from Robert Le Diable.\n\nIn 1850 he became a student of the Academy of Medicine in St. Petersburg, and developed a great interest in chemistry; he graduated in 1856 with honors, and joined the staff as asst. prof.; in 1858 he received his doctorate in chemistry; contributed several important scientific papers to the bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences; traveled in Europe on a scientific mission (1859-62).\n\nAlthough mainly preoccupied with his scientific pursuits, Borodin continued to compose. In 1863 he married Catherine Protopopova, who was an accomplished pianist; she remained his faithful companion and musical partner; together they attended concerts and operas in Russia and abroad; his letters to her from Germany (1877), describing his visit to Liszt in Weimar, are of great interest. Of a decisive influence on Borodin's progress as a composer was his meeting with Balakirev in 1862; later he formed friendships with the critic Stasov, who named Borodin as one of the \"mighty 5\" (actually, Stasov used the expression \"mighty group\" or \"handful\"), with Mussorgsky and other musicians of the Russian national school.\n\nHe adopted a style of composition in conformity with their new ideas; he particularly excelled in a type of Russian orientalism which had a great attraction for Russian musicians at the time. He never became a consummate craftsman, like Rimsky-Korsakov; although quite proficient in counterpoint, he avoided purely contrapuntal writing; his feeling for rhythm and orch. color was extraordinary, and his evocation of exotic scenes in his orch. works and in his opera Knyaz' Igor' (Prince Igor) is superb. Composition was a very slow process for Borodin; several of his works remained incomplete, and were ed. after his death by Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov. – Died at St. Petersburn, Feb. 27, 1887.

He then was a principal singer with the Old Vic and the Sadler's Wells Opera (1931-41); was a member of the Carl Rosa Opera Co.

Not only that, but the passion[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT][FONT=&quot] in the voice is heartbreaking and thrilling and can even be heard on this low-tech recording. Modern tenors tend to sing quite a bit further \"back,\" less supported, and don't know how to sing pure vowels. The production, as a result, is thick, muddled, and lacks brilliance. I think quite a few people mistake this modern \"dark\" and muddy sound as being chesty or heavy...to me it's just bad technique. MrCafiero is correct about Caruso's voice as being dark and heavy, but it is supported and forward, with bite and brilliance[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT][FONT=&quot] (squillo). No modern tenor comes close to this sound.
