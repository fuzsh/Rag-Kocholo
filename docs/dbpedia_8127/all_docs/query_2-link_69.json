        "text": "DO YOU FALL SEVEN TIMES AND STAND UP EIGHT? Came across this post and absolutely 💓 the sentiment. In a world that complains CONSTANTLY about the new generation not having enough resilience 💪🏾, I think this sums up my mentality to BOTH Business AND Life, something that I preach to my children daily. E.G. Globalising a new business like Hegenberger Medical - Transforming postpartum suturing outcomes by improving Visibility and Access., always has challenges BUT My simple view, 👍🏾 Nothing is insurmountable 👍🏾 What doesn't kill you makes you stronger 👍🏾 Falling down leads to progress, (if you get up😁) 👍🏾 All successful people have failed a bunch of times, what separates them from the rest is that they keep getting up. Do you get up every time you fall down? #getup #success #LONov23 #business\n\nOne of the most valuable lessons that I was glad to learn early on. Fail fast, win big! And even better if you can fail for free and still get the learnings. BIG NEWS TO ANNOUNCE SOON! But for now, check out episode 3 of STEMinism: The Equity In STEM Podcast on your favourite podcast app 😉 or below 👇🏾 https://lnkd.in/gmpPGd7k\n\nYou will never be good enough. Constantly comparing yourself to others will do nothing but exhaust you. Comparison is the thief of joy for a reason. The only people you should ever be trying to impress are 8-year-old you and 80-year-old you. Those are people worth getting it right for. Measure your success by growth, not directly compared to others. Because you are good enough. #MattsMinute\n\n\"Stop letting others define your worth! Remember, opinions are not facts. What people think about you doesn't have to become your reality. You are more than the sum of others' opinions. Your worth comes from within. Your strengths, skills, and values make you unique and valuable. Don't let fear of judgment hold you back. Embrace your individuality and don't be afraid to stand out. You are capable of achieving great things. Believe in yourself and your abilities. So, let's make a conscious decision to focus on our own growth and progress, rather than trying to impress others. You got this! #SelfBelief #Confidence #PersonalGrowth #Aritraa #ZetaCapital #BlazexLogistic\"\n\nNever prove people right. Never prove them wrong. Prove instead that you make your own path in life. These are wise words to live and grow from, shared by @dialacontractor. It's important to remember that we are in control of our own destiny and have the power to create our own success. Let's focus on carving our own unique path and proving ourselves to no one but ourselves. #quotes #sorted"
